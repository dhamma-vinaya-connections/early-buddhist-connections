## 1. Getting Started
Click in any box to expand it.

> [!NOTE]- Setup
> 1. **Download & Open:** Clone this repository or download the ZIP, then open the folder as a Vault in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
> 2. **Offline Access:** All texts and indexes are stored locally, making this suitable for use in monasteries or off-grid environments.

> [!NOTE]- The Basics (Quick Guide)
> If this is your first time using Obsidian, it works like a personal Wikipedia on your computer.
> * **Links:** Any text in [[Purple]] or [[Blue]] is a clickable link.
> * **Back / Forward:** Use the arrows `<-` `->` in the top-left corner to go back (like a web browser).
> * **Search:** Click the magnifying glass icon (🔍) in the top left to search the entire library.

> [!INFO]- Viewing Modes (If the page looks weird)
> If you see code symbols (like `##` or `[[`) mixed with text:
> 1. Click the **Book Icon** (Reading View) or **Pencil Icon** at the top right of the note.
> 2. Select **"Reading View"**.

> [!INFO]- Viewing Side-by-Side (Split Window and tabs)
> This is very useful for comparing a Pāli text with an English translation.
> 
> **Method 1: Drag and Drop (Easiest)**
> 1. Open your first note (e.g., a Pāli text).
> 2. **Open a second note in a new tab.** You can do this in three ways:
>    * **Keyboard:** Hold **Ctrl** (Windows) or **Cmd** (Mac) and click a link.
>    * **Mouse:** Click the **Scroll Wheel** on a link.
>    * **Menu:** Right-click a link and select **"Open in new tab"**.
>    * **Search:** Click the **+** icon in the tab bar to open a blank tab, then search for a file.
> 3. You should now see two tabs at the top of the window.
> 4. Click and hold the **Tab** of the second note.
> 5. Drag it to the **far right** of the screen until a highlighted box appears, then release.
>
> **Method 2: Right-Click**
> 6. Right-click on the **Tab** of the file you are reading.
> 7. Select **"Split right"**.
> 8. This creates a duplicate window. Click a link in the new window to change the text while keeping the original open.

## 2. Navigation
### Ways to Find a Text
> There are 4 main ways to locate a specific Sutta or Vinaya rule in this library. 
> Choose the one that fits your style.

> [!tip] 1. The Master Indexes (Nikayas & Topics)
> Best for: Browsing a specific collection or subject, like a Table of Contents.
> #### Nikaya Indexes:
> 
> | Nikaya | KN       | Āgama    |
> | ------ | -------- | -------- |
> | [[AN]] | [[DHP]]  | [[DA]]   |
> | [[DN]] | [[UD]]   | [[MA]]   |
> | [[MN]] | [[ITI]]  | [[EA]]   |
> | [[SN]] | [[SNP]]  | [[SA]]   |
> |        | [[THAG]] | [[T]]    |
> |        | [[THIG]] | [[PDHP]] |
> #### Topic Indexes: 
>  Navigate to the Subjects folder to browse by Dhamma topic.
> - [[✅Suttafriends Topics Index]]
> - [[ATI INDEX/✅ ATI Similes Index]]
> - [[ATI INDEX/✅ATI General Index]]
> - [[ATI INDEX/✅ATI Index by Number]]
> - [[✅Readingfaithfully.org Sutta Index]]
> - [[✅Suttafriends Simile Index]]
> - [[✅Gradual Training Outline 1.4]]

> [!summary]- 2. The File Explorer
> Think of it as the "Bookshelf"
> Best for: When you know exactly which folder a text is in.
> * Look at the Left Sidebar. If you don't see it, click the Folder Icon (🗂️) in the top-left corner.
> * Click the small arrow > next to a folder (e.g., Suttas -> SN -> SN1-11) to expand it. Then click the file name to open it.

> [!tip]- 3. The Catalogue (Database)
> Best for: Filtering by specific criteria.
> * Filters: Use the "Filter" icon (\triangledown) in the table header to narrow down results (e.g., by Translator, Nikaya, or Root Text).
> * Result Limits: To keep the vault fast, large tables may limit the number of results shown per page (e.g., 100 rows). Use the pagination arrows (< >) at the bottom of the table to see more.
> * Views: You can switch between different layouts (e.g., "Table" vs. "List") using the view tabs at the top of the database block.

> [!tip]- 4. The Graph View (Visual Connections)
> Best for: Exploring how texts are connected to each other.
> * How: Click the Graph Icon (molecule symbol) in the left ribbon menu.
> * Explore: Every dot is a note; every line is a link. Hover over a dot to see its name. The bigger the dot, the more connections it has!

> [!WARNING] Important
> **Do not move the +Suttas nor +Vinaya  folders.**
> This library relies on the files staying in their correct folders. If you move them, the links might break.
