Effort - one sexual organ enters the other, even to the extent of a sesame seed. 2. Objects - human, as well as non-human (deva, yakkha or peta) and animal. 3. Knowledge - knowledge that the act is occuring (i.e. not asleep). 4.

Object - anything belonging to a human being or a group of them. 2. Perception - one percieves that it belongs to someone else. 3. Intention - one decides to steal it. 4. Effort - one makes some kind of effort to take it. 5. Value - the object's value should be more than five màsakas	Only if the owner abandons all sense of ownership would it genuinely count as abandoned. A bhikkhu can commit an offense not only if he himself steals an object, but also if he incites another to steal. Group of bhikkhus steal valuables worth collectively more than five māsakas but which when divided among them yield shares worth less than five māsakas each, all incur a pārājika. A bhikkhu who takes things from the Community’s common stores, assuming he has the right to help himself, commits no offense even if the assumption proves false. A wise policy when one is in doubt about an item’s ownership would be not to take the item for one’s own, or at most to take it on loan. When a bhikkhu steals an item worth 1/24 troy ounce of gold or more, is full offense. When the item is of lesser value, there will be doubt—and when concerning a pārājika, the tradition of the Vinaya consistently gives the bhikkhu the benefit of the doubt. Special cases from commentaries: Smuggling: A bhikkhu carrying items subject to an import duty hides them as he goes through customs. Destruction of property False dealing: A bhikkhu makes counterfeit money or uses counterfeit weights. Shifting a boundary marker.

The Buddha would never say such a thing. In many discourses the Buddha has declared the obstacles to be obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them.” If that monk continues as before, the monks should press him up to three times to make him give up that view. If he then gives it up, all is well. If he does not, he commits an offense entailing confession	If he is not admonished; if he gives it up; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer	Simply holding such a view is not enough to bring a bhikkhu under the purview of this rule, but if he asserts it to others, the Vibhaṅga states that other bhikkhus have the duty of reprimanding him up to three times in the manner described in the rule. If, having learned of his assertion, they do not reprimand him, they each incur a dukkaṭa, for if he goes unreprimanded, he may continue with his assertions as he likes without incurring a penalty. A Community preparing to impose this rule on a stubborn bhikkhu should also be prepared to impose a suspension transaction on him immediately in case he refuses to respond to the formal rebuke	If, after being reprimanded, he relinquishes his view, he incurs no penalty. But if he doesn’t, he incurs a dukkaṭa. He should then be taken into the midst of the Community to be admonished and rebuked as described under Sg 10, the only difference here being that the penalty is a dukkaṭa in each of the preliminary stages, and a pācittiya after the third formal rebuke. (The formula for the rebuke is given in Appendix VIII BMC 1) If a bhikkhu penalized under this rule persists in asserting his evil view, he is subject to an act of suspension, under which he is not allowed to commune or affiliate with bhikkhus in any Community until he sees the error of his ways and relinquishes his view (see BMC2, Chapter 20	Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me. An evil viewpoint of this sort has arisen in Bhikkhu (name): “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive, when engaged in are not genuine obstructions.” He does not relinquish that view. If the Community is ready, it should rebuke Bhikkhu (name) for the sake of relinquishing that view. This is the motion. 3 times Bhikkhu (name) has been rebuked by the Community for the sake of relinquishing that view. This is agreeable to the Community, therefore it is silent. Thus do I hold it.

The Buddha would never say such a thing. In many discourses the Buddha has declared the obstacles to be obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them.” If that novice monastic continues as before, he should be told: “From today on you may not refer to the Buddha as your teacher. And you can no longer share a sleeping place with the monks for two or three nights, as can other novice monastics. Go! Away with you!” If a monk befriends that novice monastic, or he is attended on by him, lives with him, or shares a sleeping place with him, even though he knows that he has been expelled in this way, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”	If he knows, “He is not expelled”; if he knows, “He has given up that view”; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer	1) Object: a novice who has been expelled and has not relinquished his evil view. 2) Perception: One perceives that he has been expelled and has not relinquished his evil view—either from knowing on one’s own, from having been told by him (§), or from having been told by others. 3) Effort: One befriends him, receives services from him, communes with him, or lies down in the same dwelling with him	A novice comes to think that there is nothing wrong with any novice’s having sexual intercourse or breaking any of his other precepts. This form of expulsion lasts as long as he has yet to relinquish his view. If and when he does relinquish it, he is to be reinstated.

As the non-offense clauses to Pc 54 make clear, though, if one has been admonished with any interpretation of a rule that differs from one’s teachers’, one may avoid an offense simply by stating that one’s teachers taught differently	1) Object: One has been admonished by a fellow bhikkhu who cites a rule formulated in the Vinaya. 2) Intention: One does not want to train oneself in line with the rule. 3) Effort: As a ploy to excuse oneself, one says something to the effect that one will not train in line with the rule	This rule deals with cases where a bhikkhu tries to excuse himself from following any of the training rules without showing out-and-out disrespect for the rule or the person admonishing him.

Further, he should be charged with deception: “It’s a loss for you that you don’t pay proper attention during the recitation of the Monastic Code.” And for the act of deception, he commits an offense entailing confession	If he is not heard in detail; if he is heard in detail (but) less than two or three times; if he does not desire to deceive; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer	1) Object: a rule in the Pāṭimokkha. 2) Intention: One wants to deceive the bhikkhus into believing that one is ignorant of the rule one has broken. 3) Effort: One has heard the Pāṭimokkha in full for at least three times, yet one persists in saying half-truths to feign ignorance after the bhikkhus have enacted a Community transaction exposing one’s deceit. (Out-and-out lies would come under Pc 1.)	This rule covers the use of a half-truth to feign ignorance of the rules at any time. No exceptions for bhikkhus whose native language is not Pali. Nevertheless, as the Pāṭimokkha is available in a number of translations, the grace period in which one is expected to be ignorant—three recitations covers at least a month to a month and a half—is not too short a time for a new bhikkhu to read and remember the rules in translation. If the transaction exposing one’s deceit has been properly carried out, then regardless of whether one perceives it as valid, one incurs a pācittiya for trying to deceive the bhikkhus any further. If it has been improperly carried out, one incurs a dukkaṭa for trying to deceive them further,	Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho.

Effort - one makes some kind of effort to take it. 5. Value - the object's value should be more than five màsakas	Only if the owner abandons all sense of ownership would it genuinely count as abandoned. A bhikkhu can commit an offense not only if he himself steals an object, but also if he incites another to steal. Group of bhikkhus steal valuables worth collectively more than five māsakas but which when divided among them yield shares worth less than five māsakas each, all incur a pārājika. A bhikkhu who takes things from the Community’s common stores, assuming he has the right to help himself, commits no offense even if the assumption proves false. A wise policy when one is in doubt about an item’s ownership would be not to take the item for one’s own, or at most to take it on loan. When a bhikkhu steals an item worth 1/24 troy ounce of gold or more, is full offense. When the item is of lesser value, there will be doubt—and when concerning a pārājika, the tradition of the Vinaya consistently gives the bhikkhu the benefit of the doubt. Special cases from commentaries: Smuggling: A bhikkhu carrying items subject to an import duty hides them as he goes through customs.

Effort - an action is done to bring about its death. 5.

Evil View: Should any bhikkhunī hold an evil view... (refusing to give it up), it is to be confessed.	If he is not admonished; if he gives it up; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer	Simply holding such a view is not enough to bring a bhikkhu under the purview of this rule, but if he asserts it to others, the Vibhaṅga states that other bhikkhus have the duty of reprimanding him up to three times in the manner described in the rule. If, having learned of his assertion, they do not reprimand him, they each incur a dukkaṭa, for if he goes unreprimanded, he may continue with his assertions as he likes without incurring a penalty. A Community preparing to impose this rule on a stubborn bhikkhu should also be prepared to impose a suspension transaction on him immediately in case he refuses to respond to the formal rebuke	If, after being reprimanded, he relinquishes his view, he incurs no penalty. But if he doesn’t, he incurs a dukkaṭa. He should then be taken into the midst of the Community to be admonished and rebuked as described under Sg 10, the only difference here being that the penalty is a dukkaṭa in each of the preliminary stages, and a pācittiya after the third formal rebuke. (The formula for the rebuke is given in Appendix VIII BMC 1) If a bhikkhu penalized under this rule persists in asserting his evil view, he is subject to an act of suspension, under which he is not allowed to commune or affiliate with bhikkhus in any Community until he sees the error of his ways and relinquishes his view (see BMC2, Chapter 20	Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me. An evil viewpoint of this sort has arisen in Bhikkhu (name): “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive, when engaged in are not genuine obstructions.” He does not relinquish that view. If the Community is ready, it should rebuke Bhikkhu (name) for the sake of relinquishing that view. This is the motion. 3 times Bhikkhu (name) has been rebuked by the Community for the sake of relinquishing that view. This is agreeable to the Community, therefore it is silent. Thus do I hold it.

This form of expulsion lasts as long as he has yet to relinquish his view. If and when he does relinquish it, he is to be reinstated.
