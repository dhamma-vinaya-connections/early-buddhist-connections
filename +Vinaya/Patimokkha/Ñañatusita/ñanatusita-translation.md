**Preface**

This book contains an abridged, concise edition of _Analysis of the  
Bhikkhu Pātimokkha_ , an in depth study and word by word translation  
of the _Bhikkhupātimokkha,_ the Code of Discipline of Buddhist monks.  
It is intended for Buddhist monks, but it could also be of interest of  
those who are studying Pali or Buddhist monastic law.  
The main part of this book is the word by word translation of  
the Pali text of the Pātimokkha. Also included are an edition of the  
Pali text, a translation, and, in the Introduction, discussions of a few  
important Pali terms such as _pātimokkha_ and discussions of  
procedures such as confession, etc. The complete work is quite wide  
in scope, and often going into more detail than is necessary for the  
average student, who could be put off by the detailed analyses.  
Therefore two books were made: _Analysis of the Bhikkhu Pātimokkha_ ,  
intended for those who wish to study the _Pātimokkha_ in depth, and  
this book, _The Bhikkhu Pātimokkha_ : _a Word by Word Translation,_ as a  
companion volume intended for the average student.  
The English translations of the Pātimokkha rules are an  
accompaniment to the analysis of the words and their function is to  
show the meaning of the rule as a whole. The emphasis tends to be  
more on the side of literalness than on fluency.  
There are some differences among the various editions of the  
Pātimokkha as to the spelling of words, etc., and these are noted in  
footnotes. For the Pali text of the Pātimokkha, I have chosen the  
readings that I think are the authentic ones (although sometimes it is  
not possible to be sure) and this Pali text is therefore not identical  
with any other edition. In this concise edition only the readings of the  
main editions have been taken.  
Several bhikkhus helped with this book in the form of proof-  
reading, giving suggestions, and helping with the formatting, etc. In  
particular I would like to thank Venerables Anālayo, Ānandajoti,  
Brahmāli, Damita, Dhīravaṃso, and Visārado.  
May this work help to further the understanding and practice of  
the Pātimokkha rules.

**Pātimokkha Editions Consulted**

### Printed Sinhalese Editions

UP: _Ubhaya Pratimokṣaya_ ; G. Sorata & K. Ratanavaṃsi; Pokuṇuwita,

1956. A Sri Lankan edition in use by the Amarapura Nikāya.  
    Influenced by Burmese texts.

Several other printed editions were consulted, which are not named in  
the footnotes in this abridged edition, but are referred to as “Sinhalese  
eds.’’ The main one is _Bhikkhupātimokkhaṃ_ , Colombo 1875. This is  
the oldest printed Pātimokkha edition in Sinhala script and is based  
on Siyam Nikāya manuscripts as the readings more often agree with  
the Thai readings (Mi and Mm Se) than with the Burmese edition  
(Dm) or Amarapura Nikāya edition (UP).

### Burmese and Thai

Dm: _Dve Mātikāpā¿i_. Burmese edition of both the _Bhikkhu-_ and the  
_Bhikkhunī-pātimokkha_ found preceding the text of the  
_Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī_ in the Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana ed. (As given in  
CSCD.) Unlike other editions, there are no v.l. given in the Be  
Pātimokkha.  
Mi Se: Mahidon Siam edition. The Pātimokkha version used by the  
Thai Mahānikāya that is found preceding the _Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī_  
in the Mahidon University Thai edition, 1997. (BUDSIR CD-  
ROM.)  
Mm Se: Maha Makuṭ Siam edition of the Pātimokkha as given in  
Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu; _The Pāṭimokkha,_ Bangkok, 1966. This is the  
version recited in the Thai Dhammayuttika-nikāya.

### Sinhalese Manuscripts

For this edition several handwritten Sinhalese palm-leaf manuscripts

were consulted. They date from later than the mid 18th century, when  
the _upasampadā_ was reinstated with the help of Siamese bhikkhus.

Also one Khom script Siamese manuscript was consulted, but no  
manuscripts in other scripts. In this abrided edition, they are referred

to as Sinhalese MSS.

x _Arrangement and Translation_

**Arrangement and Translation**

The Pali text of the rule is given first, and then each Pali word in the  
rule is listed with a translation. Sometimes alternative translations of  
words or phrases are given, and also the translations of other  
translators. After the word-translation the case, number, and gender  
of nouns are given; for verbs the person, number, and tense are given.  
The Pali verbal root system as given in Buddhadatta’s _Concise Pali  
English Dictionary_ has usually been followed in this work, rather than  
the Sanskrit system as given in PED and A.K. Warder’s _Introduction to  
Pali_. However, Warder’s system (see IP pp.11 + 216) of showing  
bracketed twins of the initial consonant of roots liable to doubling  
when compounded with a prefix, e.g. _(s)su_ , has also been used.  
The analysis of junctions, _sandhi_ , as given in Geiger’s _Pāli  
Grammar_ has generally been followed. Other additional information,  
such as extracts from the Pali commentaries etc., is also given if it  
sheds light on the meaning of the words discussed. The terms used for  
the classification of compounds are in Pali because no adequate  
equivalents exist in English (see IP pp.77f).  
“See above: ...” refers back to the translation and explanation of  
a word that has occurred earlier. When a word is given several times  
in a rule, or in a sequence of rules, it is not listed after the first few  
times it has occurred.  
The Pali titles to sections and rules are not recited. Only text in  
italics is recited. In the translation, words in square brackets are not  
found in the Pali. They are supplied to make the translation more  
readable.

**INTRODUCTION**

**1. The Pātimokkha and its Meaning**

The Bhikkhu-pātimokkha, or Code of Discipline for Buddhist monks,  
consists of two hundred and twenty training precepts ( _sikkhāpada_ )  
divided into seven classes or groups: 4 _pārājika_ , 13 _saṅghādisesa_ , 2 _aniy-  
ata_ , 30 _nissaggiya pācittiya_ , 92 _pācittiya_ , 4 _pāṭidesanīya_ , and 75 _sekhiya_.  
The number of two hundred and twenty seven training precepts  
or rules, which some modern scholars give, is, strictly speaking,  
incorrect as the group of seven _adhikaraṇasamatha-dhammas,_ which  
follow the _sekhiyas,_ are procedures for settling legal issues, and  
therefore cannot be counted as training precept. The Suttavibhaṅga  
contains no word commentary ( _padabhājana_ ) on the  
_adhikaraṇasamatha_ , which indicates that they originally were not  
counted as training precepts and perhaps also that they were not even  
included in the Pātimokkha. According to the Dīgha Nikāya  
commentary the seven _adhikaranasamatha-dhammas_ are not included  
in the Mahāvibhaṅga or Bhikkhuvibhaṅga: “Thus the Mahāvibhaṅga is  
two hundred and twenty training training rules ....” (D-a I 13). The  
exact meaning and derivation of the word _pātimokkha_ is uncertain. It  
might have more than one meaning. Several meanings, etymologies  
and word-plays are given by the ancient commentators and by modern  
translators and scholars. The _pātimokkha_ as a word, and a code of  
discipline which is recitated, is unique to the Buddhist tradition.  
The Padabhājana gives an etymology of _pātimokkha_ based on the  
word _mukha_ : entrance or front: “ _Pātimokkha_ : this is the start, this is  
the entrance, this is the forerunner of good states.” ( _Pātimokkhan-ti  
ādiṃ etaṃ mukhaṃ etaṃ pamukhaṃ etaṃ kusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ_ .)  
This is more a word-play than an etymology. The same goes for the  
following commentarial etymologies.  
In the Dīgha Nikāya Commentary three etymologies are given.  
The first one is based on the word _mukha_ : entrance, and the next two  
on the root ƒ _muc_ : “releases”: _“_ That which is the very front, the very  
foremost _,_ the highest virtue; or it protects one from ( _pāti_ : ƒ _pā_ + _a_ ) the  
fears of good bourns [and] delivers one from the fears of bad bourns; or  
it delivers the one who protects it, thus it is called ‘ _pātimokkha_ .’”  
Other commentarial etymologies & word-plays are: “Restrained  
with the Pātimokkha-restraint ( _pātimokkhasaṃvarasaṃvuto_ ): here  
_pātimokkhaṃ_ is the virtue of the training precept, for it delivers that  
one who protects ( _pāti_ ) and guards it, it delivers one from the  
sufferings starting with hell.^1 Therefore it is said ‘ _pātimokkhaṃ.’_  
Restraining ( _saṃvaraṇa_ = action-noun), is restraint ( _saṃvara_ ); this is

xii _Introduction_

the designation for physical and verbal non-transgression. Therefore  
_Pātimokkha-_ restraint. _Pātimokkhasamvarasaṃvuta_ is being restrained  
with the _Pātimokkha-_ restraint, undertaken, endowed with, is the  
meaning.” (Vism 16, Vibh-a 330)  
_“Pātimokkhaṃ_ : that which is the most very front, the very most  
foremost, the very best, the very highest.” (Kkh 2). _“Pātimokkhaṃ:_  
the base founded on virtue, conduct, control, restraint, front,  
forerunner for the attainment of wholesome states.” (Vibh 511, Sp  
787 ).  
These commentarial etymologies indicate that Buddhaghosa  
made use of manuscripts with the reading _pātimokkha,_ rather than the  
Thai reading _pāṭimokkha_. They also indicate is that traditionally the  
word _pātimokkha_ is regarded as a neuter noun, not a masculine noun.  
This is the reason for the neuter form _bhikkhupātimokkhaṃ_ in the  
titles and the conclusion of Pātimokkha editions and manuscripts.  
The other early Buddhist schools use the term _prātimokṣa_ (as  
part of the compound _prātimokṣasūtra_ ) and, except for one school,  
derive it from the root ƒ _muc,_ “deliver, frees.” This derivation based  
on the root ƒ _muc_ resonates with the last line of the Nidāna where it  
is said that there is ease for one who has revealed his offences.  
Horner ( _Book of the Discipline_ I xii–xiv) thinks that the meaning of  
being bound by the restraint of the Pātimokkha, _Pātimokkhasaṃvara-  
saṃvuta_ (Vin IV 51, D I 62 etc.), was originally of more importance  
than the meaning of freeing from remorse through confession. She  
quotes the _Pali English Dictionary_ , according to which _pātimokkha_ is  
said to have the same meaning as _paṭimokkha_ at J V 25: “that promise to  
be obliged has not been released” ( _taṃ saṅgaraṃ paṭimokkhaṃ na mut-  
taṃ_ ). A few other references also support the future passive participle  
etymology: J V 166: _Yaṃ (bandhanaṃ) natthuto paṭimokkh’assa pāse_ :  
“(the bondage) which was tied through his nose (of the _nāga_ ) in a  
noose” and D I 12 & 181: _osadhīnaṃ paṭimokkho_ : “the binding on of  
medicinal herbs” or, in accordance with the commentarial explanation  
of this, “removal of/releasing from [caustic] medicinal herbs.” Some  
additional support for the meaning of binding could be found in the  
simile in which the disciples of previous Buddhas who let the _brah-  
macariya_ disappear are likened to loose flowers on a board that are scat-  
tered by the wind since they are “not tied together by a thread” ( _suttena  
asaṃgahitattā_ ); see Vin I 8.  
It is possible that the term _pātimokkha_ has more than one  
meaning as wordplays are not uncommon in Pali. For example, it

1. This etymology might have given rise to the belief in Thailand that a bhikkhu  
    who has learnt the Pātimokkha by heart will be reborn in heaven.

_2. The Purpose of the Pátimokkha Recitation_ xiii

might convey the idea that confession frees ( _muccati_ ) one from  
remorse, thus opening up the entrance ( _mukha_ ) to wholesome states.  
The Pātimokkha is referred to by way of synonyms in the rules  
and section introduction and conclusions contained in the  
Pātimokkha, i.e., _sutta_ (Pāc 73, Vin V 123: _suttuddesa_ ), _uddesa_ (section  
introductions and conclusions, Sd 12, Pāc 73. Cf. Vin III 26 and A I  
230). In the _Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī_ it is referred to as _mātikā_.

**2. The Purpose of the Pātimokkha Recitation**

Some purposes of the Pātimokkha recitation are stated or implied in the  
Pātimokkha itself, i.e., remembering the rules and learning about them:  
Nid & Pāc 73; the unity and ease of bhikkhus: Sd 10–11 ( _... samaggo
phāsu viharati_ .), Concl.; bringing bhikkhus together regularly: Sd 10 (
_ekuddeso_ ...), Concl. (... _anvaddhamāsa_ ...); mutual trust: Pāc 73 (
_mohanake ..._ ) and section-endings (... _parisuddh’etthāyasmanto
dhārayāmi_ .); causing shame in offenders due to having to confess, and  
causing fear of wrong doing in potential offenders: Nid, section- end-  
ings ( _Kacci’ttha_ ...); freeing offenders from guilt and remorse: Nid (
_avikatā hissa phāsu hoti_ .); purity: Nid, section-endings ( _parisuddhā_ ).  
The Buddha declared the standard ten reasons ( _atthavasa_ ) for  
establishing the Pātimokkha and the training precepts as follows:  
“Therefore, bhikkhus, I make known a training precept  
dependent on ten reasons: for the well-being of the community, for the  
comfort of the community, for the control of shameless persons, for  
the dwelling in comfort of well-behaved bhikkhus, for the restraining  
of taints here and now, for the repelling of taints in the hereafter, for  
the belief of those who are not believing, for the increase of those that  
are believing, for the persistence of the True Teaching, for the  
supporting of the Discipline.”^2  
In the introduction to the Suttavibhaṅga (Vin III 8 f.) the Buddha  
said that the _brahmacariya_ under some of the previous Buddhas did not  
last long because these Buddhas “were idle in teaching Dhamma in  
detail to disciples; and they had little _sutta_ , verse, ..., the training rule for  
their disciples was not made known, the Pātimokkha was not recited.”  
Ven. Sāriputta therefore requested the Buddha to declare the training  
and to recite the Pātimokkha. The Buddha, however, declined saying  
that he would not do so until the conditions causing taints ( _āsavā_ )

2. A I 98, Vin III 20, etc.: _saṅghasuṭṭhutāya, saṅghaphāsutāya, dummaṅkunaṃ  
    puggalānaṃ niggahāya, pesalānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ phāsuvihārāya, diṭṭhadhammikānaṃ  
    āsavānaṃ saṃvarāya, samparāyikānaṃ āsavānaṃ paṭighātāya, appasannānaṃ  
    pasādāya, pasannānaṃ bhiyyobhāvāya, saddhammaṭṭhitiyā, vinayānuggahāya_.

xiv _Introduction_

appeared in the Saṅgha. When these conditions appeared, he would  
recite the Pātimokkha for the purpose of repelling of those taints.  
Ven. Bhaddāli once asked the Buddha why there more rules than  
before while there were fewer bhikkhus established in wisdom. The  
Buddha answered that more things that are the basis for taints appear  
when the Saṅgha has come to greatness, gain, fame, great learning and  
long-standing, and these things need to be checked by laying down  
training precepts. See Bhaddālisutta, M I 445.  
These two passages show that the main purposes of reciting the  
Pātimokkha every fortnight, and observing the rules it contains, are  
uniting the Saṅgha and preserving the Dhamma for future  
generations. In the Gopakamoggalānasutta Ven. Ānanda explains that  
the cause for unity ( _sāmaggī_ ) in the Saṅgha when there is no personal  
replacement for the Buddha after his _parinibbāna_ is the refuge of  
Dhamma in the form of the Pātimokkha-recitation (M II 250). One  
can thus say that the Pātimokkha is the collective body of rules that  
bhikkhus are obliged to train in, and are obliged to recite every two  
weeks, when living in communities, for the sake of unity, harmony,  
continuity, and the various other reasons mentioned above.

**3. The** **_Pātimokkha_** **as** **_Sutta_** **in the** **_Suttavibhaṅga_**

The Pātimokkha, also called the Sutta (see § 16), is the only canonical  
text that, besides being transmitted as an independent text, is also  
transmitted by being embedded in another canonical text, the  
Suttavibhaṅga or “Analysis of the Sutta.”  
The Pali commentarial tradition places the Pātimokkhas in the  
Vinayapiṭaka, that is, as canonical texts: “Having collected all that was  
recited or not recited at the First Council, the two Pātimokkhas, the  
two Vibhaṅgas, the twelve Khandhakas, the sixteen _Parivāra_ s: this is  
the Basket of Discipline.” (Sp 18 & D-a I 17)  
In the Suttanta and Vinaya Piṭakas, the Bhikkhu- and Bhikkhunī-  
pātimokkhas are the only texts mentioned by name besides the  
Aṭṭhakavagga of the Suttanipāta; see Vin I 65, II 95.  
Probably the reason for the Pātimokkha being embedded in the  
Suttavibhaṅga is that after the passing away of the Buddha the elders  
felt that the Pātimokkha should be strictly interpreted according to the  
explanation and analysis given in the Suttavibhaṅga so that no devious  
interpretations would arise. Misinterpretations could happen if it were  
not embedded in the Suttavibhaṅga and was just transmitted as a  
separate text. This would accord with the reasons that Mahākassapa  
Thera gave for the recitation of the Vinaya at the first council.  
An independent Bhikkhu Pātimokkha text would have been  
recited at the Uposatha and served as a basic guidance in conduct for

_4. The Recitation of the Pátimokkha_ xv

bhikkhus. The Vinaya-experts and admonishers of bhikkhunīs  
( _vinayadhara_ s and _bhikkhunovādaka_ s) as law-experts and law-enforcers  
needed to be very familiar with the details concerning regulations that  
are given in the Suttavibhaṅga; see A IV 140 & 279 and also Vin II 96f.  
Such bhikkhus were supposed to learn both Pātimokkhas in full extent,  
the _sutta_ s with the details connected with them, _suttaso anubyañjanaso_.  
That the Pātimokkha was an independent text all along is also  
confirmed by its “word-analysis,” the Padabhājana or Padabhājanīya,  
which is now contained in the Suttavibhaṅga but originally would  
have been transmitted as an independent text, just as the Niddesa is  
transmitted as a commentary on the Aṭṭhakavagga of the Suttanipāta.

**4. The Recitation of the Pātimokkha**

The rules and regulations regarding the recitation of the Pātimokkha  
are given in the Uposathakkhandhaka of the Mahāvagga, Mv II/Vin I  
101–136. (They are all listed in _Buddhist Monastic Code_ II chapter 15.)  
Many of these regulations are included in the _pubbakaraṇa-pubbakicca_  
summary recited before the Pātimokkha recitation; see § 6.  
The Buddha allowed bhikkhus to gather together on the  
fourteenth or fifteenth, and the eighth day of the half-month to speak  
Dhamma, but later amended this to a legal act of Uposatha consisting  
of the recitation of the Pātimokkha; Mv II 2,1/Vin I 102.  
The Pātimokkha may not be formally recited on any day but  
only on the Uposatha-day once in a half-month; Mv II 4,2/Vin I 104.  
There are two types of Uposatha days: the fourteenth and the fif-  
teenth; Mv II 14,1/Vin I 111. The Uposatha should not be done on a  
non-Uposatha day unless it for the sake of unity of the community  
( _saṅghasāmaggī_ ); Mv II 36.4/Vin I 136, Mv X 5,14/Vin I 357. This type  
of Uposatha is called “unity-uposatha” ( _sāmaggi-uposatha_ ) in the  
_Parivāra_ ; Vin V 123.  
There are five ways of reciting the Pātimokkha; Mv II 15,1/Vin I  
112 and Kkh 3/Sp 1057. The fifth one, the recitation in breadth (or  
extensive-recitation) ( _vitthāruddesa_ ), in which all the rule-sections are  
recited is the normal one. The other four are recitations in brief that  
can be done in exceptional cases of danger; Mv II 15, 3–4.^3 In the first  
way of recitating only the Nidāna is recited and the other sections are  
just announced, _anussāvita_ ; the second way includes the Pārājika  
section; the third includes the Saṅghādisesa section; and the fourth  
includes the Aniya section. It is an offence of wrong doing, _dukkaṭa_ , to  
recite the Pātimokkha in brief when there is no danger; Mv II 15, 4/Vin  
I 112–113.  
Recitation in brief is also allowed when none of the bhikkhus in  
a monastery knows the Pātimokkha and a bhikkhu has been sent to

xvi _Introduction_

another monastery to learn the Pātimokkha but is unable to learn it  
in full before returning; Mv II 17,5/Vin 116 & Mv II 21,3–4/119–20.  
The Pātimokkha is recited by one bhikkhu, the  
_pātimokkhuddesaka_ : the “reciter of the Pātimokkha,” who has been  
appointed by the senior bhikkhu, Mv II 16,9/Vin I 115. The reciter is  
preferably the most senior bhikkhu, but if he is unable to recite it,  
then another competent bhikkhu can be appointed by him to recite.  
If there is no bhikkhu who can recite the Pātimokkha in a residence,  
then one bhikkhu should be sent elsewhere to master it from a  
Pātimokkha reciter; Mv II 17,5/Vin 116.  
Before the motion ( _ñatti_ ) the reciter recites three times: _Namo  
tassa bhagavato arahato sammāsambuddhassa_.  
While the Pātimokkha is recited meticulous attention is paid to  
the recitation by the reciter as well as the other bhikkhus who are  
present so that no word is omitted and that the pronunciation of  
every word and syllable is correct. In Thai monasteries one bhikkhu  
is appointed to check the recitation with the help of a textbook. The  
bhikkhu who checks tells the reciter when he makes a mistake or  
forgets something, so that he recites correctly. In Burma and Sri  
Lanka any of the participating bhikkhus can correct the reciter and  
usually no bhikkhu is appointed to check.  
The recitation can take less than forty-five minutes if it is  
chanted very fast, but a slower recitation of about one hour is easier  
to follow. The Pātimokkha reciter should make himself audible to the  
other participating bhikkhus and it is a wrong-doing to deliberately  
make himself not heard; Mv II 16,6/Vin I 115. The Pātimokkha  
should not be recited to an assembly that contains householders, or to  
any other type of person not fully admitted into the Saṅgha, i.e. any  
non-bhikkhu; Mv II 16,8/Vin I 115. Doing so entails an offence of  
wrong-doing ( _dukkaṭa_ ); Mv II 36/Vin I 135–36.  
There is no group-recitation of the Pātimokkha at the Uposatha  
during which all bhikkhus recite the Pātimokkha together; see the  
Nidāna “I shall recite the Pātimokkha” ( _pātimokkhaṃ uddisissāmi_ ).

3. (1) A king obstruction [Commentary: a king arrives], (2) a robber obstruction  
    [C: robbers come], (3) a fire obstruction [C: a forest fire approaches from outside  
    the monastery or a fire breaks out in the monastery], (4) a water obstruction [C:  
    heavy rain, a flood], (5) a human obstruction [C: large numbers of people come],  
    (6) a non-human obstruction [C: a spirit takes possession of a bhikkhu], (7) a beast  
    obstruction [C: a fierce beast, such as a tiger, comes], (8) a serpent obstruction [C:  
    a poisonous animal bites a bhikkhu], (9) a life obstruction [C: a bhikkhu falls ill or  
    dies; hostile people come with the intent of killing or grabbing hold of a  
    bhikkhu], (10) a celibacy obstruction [C: people catch hold of bhikkhu(s) to make  
    him fall from celibacy].

_5. Chapter Titles_ xvii  
**5. Chapter Titles**

The Nissaggiya Pācittiya, Pācittiya, and Sekhiya offence-sections are  
divided into chapters, _vagga_ s, usually of ten rules. The chapters have  
titles which, together with the number of the chapter, are given at the  
end of the chapters and they are—with a few exceptions—named in  
accordance with a key-word from the first rule of the chapter. The  
chapter-title does not define the common topic of offences for the  
chapter. The few exceptions are discussed below.  
The chapter-division and end-of-chapter remarks in the various  
Pātimokkha editions are usually the same as in the Suttavibhaṅga,  
however, the Thai Dhammayuttika Nikāya Pātimokkha version  
(Mm Se) has the Sekhiya chapter-division as in the _Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī_ ,  
while the Thai Mahā Nikāya version (Mi Se) gives both the  
Suttavibhaṅga and the _Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī_ chapter-divisions.

**6. Summary of Preparations and Preliminary Duties**

When the Pātimokkha is recited it is preceded by a summary of the  
preparations and preliminary duties called _pubbakaraṇapubbakicca_.  
The _pubbakaraṇa_ preparations are concerned with the preparing of  
the place where the Uposatha meeting is held. The _pubbakicca_ prelim-  
inary duties are the duties which are to be done when the bhikkhus  
have assembled and the Uposatha meeting is about to start. Possibly  
every monastic group ( _nikāya_ ) in the Theravāda tradition has its own  
Pali version of this summary, but all of the versions are based on the  
three verses found in the _Kaṅkhāvitaranī_. These three verses summa-  
rise the various duties and observances related to the Uposatha and  
the factors of suitability. According to the _Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī_ this sum-  
mary was compiled by the Commentary-teachers ( _aṭṭhakathācariyā_ ).  
The duties are found in various places in the Vinaya-piṭaka and the  
Commentary teachers would have collected and summarised them for  
the sake of convenience and clarity.  
The modern versions, see pp. 1–14, are of various lengths and are  
also recited in different ways:  
The Thai Dhammayuttikanikāya version is recited by a single  
reciter. The version of the Thai Mahānikāya is recited by two  
bhikkhus: one bhikkhu who questions and one bhikkhu who  
answers. A version that is almost identical with the Thai Mahānikāya  
version, and is also performed by one bhikkhu asking and one  
bhikkhu answering, is the Sri Lankan version used by the Siyām-  
nikāya, the Rāmañña Nikāya and the Amarapura Nikāya.

xviii _Introduction_

In Burma the preliminary dialogue is recited in Burmese rather  
than in Pali. However, the two summary verses from the  
_Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī_ are recited in Pali.  
There is no indication in the Vinaya and Pātimokkha  
commentaries that the summary is to be recited before the Nidāna  
and this would be a later development. Originally the summary  
would have been a memory aid. There is also no mention of formally  
questioning and answering about the duties etc. in the commentaries.  
The exact source of the question and answer versions of the  
_pubbakaraṇapubbakicca_ can not be traced_._


The summary of the commentary-teachers is:
The broom and the lamp, the water with the seat
these are called: “the preparation for the observance.”
The consent and purity, the telling of the season, the counting of
the bhikkhus and the instruction [of the bhikkhunīs],
these are called: “the preliminary duty for the observance.”
The observance, whatever bhikkhus are entitled [to carry out
the legal] act.
Common offences are not found,
there are no persons to be excluded in there,
this is called: “reached suitability.” (Kkh 6, Sp 1063)


The following sections refer to this summary.

**7. Preparations**

The preparations of the place where the Uposatha is done are given in  
the Mahāvagga. A junior bhikkhu who, although being requested by a  
senior bhikkhu to prepare the place, does not carry out the request  
commits an offence of wrong doing. A bhikkhu living alone should also  
make preparations on Uposatha days in case other bhikkhus arrive; Mv  
II 26,10.

**8. Preliminary Duties:** **_Pārisuddhi_** **and** **_Chanda_**

The first of the preliminary duties is the conveying of consent and  
purity, _chandapārisuddhi_ , on behalf of a bhikkhu who is not able to  
attend the Uposatha.^4  
The Buddha declared that a sick bhikkhu who is unable to come  
to the Uposatha should make known his purity, _pārisuddhi_ , through  
another bhikkhu to all the bhikkhus who are attending the Uposatha  
by saying: “Announce my purity” ( _pārisuddhiṃ me ārocehi_ ). It is an

_9. Confession_ xix

offence of wrong-doing to knowingly do an _uposathakamma_ with an  
divided/incomplete community_._ ”^5  
The Pātimokkha commentary (Kkh 21) explains _pārisuddhi_ as  
one’s own purity ( _attano parisuddhibhāvaṃ ārocetha_ ), i.e., freedom  
from offences. It refers to the rule: “By one with an offence the  
Pātimokkha is not to be listened to. If he should listen, there is an  
offence of wrong-doing for him.” The Mahāvagga gives the  
confession-procedure for a bhikkhu who falls into offence on the  
Uposatha-day itself; Mv II 27,1/Vin I 125–26. There is no mention of  
what should happen on normal days, but the Buddha says that it is a  
quality of one endowed with right view that when he commits an  
offence he quickly shows and reveals it to the teacher or to other wise  
companions in the holy life and then practises restraint in the future;  
M I 324; cf. M I 417 f., Sn 232.  
A bhikkhu who remembers an offence during the Pātimokkha  
recitation should inform a bhikkhu near to him and mention that he  
will make amends after the recitation. According to Dhirasekera, a  
bhikkhu does not declare purity through confessing before the  
Pātimokkha recitation, but rather declares it through remaining silent  
during recitation when the reciter asks about purity.  
The giving of consent ( _chanda_ ), by a sick bhikkhu through  
another bhikkhu is the same as for any other community-business  
( _saṅghakamma_ ); Mv II 23/Vin I 121–122.

**9. Confession**

One of the purposes of the Pātimokkha recitation is the control of  
shameless persons. One way this control or restraint is effected is  
through the obligatory confession of offences. This confession to  
another bhikkhu, or more than one bhikkhu, brings up shame and fear  
of future wrong-doing in the offender. Bhikkhus confessing various  
types of offences (Pār, Sd, Pāc, Pd) are likened to criminals undergoing  
public punishment and penance; A II 240–42. In the Anaṅganasutta (M  
I 27) there is a bhikkhu who wishes that he will not be reproved in the  
midst of the community for an offence he has committed.  
The procedure for the confession of light offences ( _lahuka āpatti—_  
denoting all offences except the Pār and Sd offences, which are called

4.^ In order for any _saṅghakamma_ to be valid the motion ( _ñatti_ ) and proclamation  
( _anussāvana_ ) have to be in the right order, all bhikkhus entitled to participate in the  
legal act must have come, bhikkhus who cannot participate must have conveyed  
their consent to the legal act, and those present must not protest (against the act);  
see Mv IX 14, 1–3/Vin I 316–19 and Mv II 14, 1–3/Vin I 111.

5. Mv II 22,2/Vin I 120. See the note on _samagga_ at Sd 10.

xx _Introduction_

heavy offences, _garuka āpatti_ .) is described in Mv II 27/Vin I 125–28, Cv  
IV 14, 30–32/Vin II 102–03. The procedure for the confession and  
forfeiture needed for Nissaggiya Pācittiyā offences is described in the  
Padabhājana to each NP rule. The _pāṭidesanīya_ procedure is given in the  
Pāṭidesanīya rules themselves. The _saṅghādisesa_ procedure is given at  
the end of the Sd section and in Cv II & III.  
Nowadays, bhikkhus usually do a general all inclusive  
confession in Pali that does not explicitly specify each light offence  
committed. However, in the Vinaya-piṭaka, and also in the  
commentaries, there is no mention of such a general confession. Each  
offence remembered had to be specifically confessed and mentioned  
by a bhikkhu.  
The way general confessions are done differs from _nikāya_ to  
_nikāya_. In the forest sub-sect of the Rāmañña Nikāya in Sri Lanka a  
very general confession is done that includes all classes of confessable  
offences: “many offences of various classes” ( _sambahulā nānāvatthukāyo  
āpattiyo_ ). In the Thai Dhammayuttikanikāya, and also in some  
traditions within the Mahānikāya, each class of confessable offences is  
confessed separately, but specific offences that a bhikkhu remembers  
are mentioned in his own language to the bhikkhu he confesses with  
before the formal confession. In the Thai Mahānikāya at least two  
versions of the general confession are done. In Burma there is at least  
one version which slightly differs from the one given in Ñd.  
According to the Padabhājana an offence can be revealed in the  
middle of the community, in the middle of a group, or to one person;  
Mv II 3,8/Vin I 104. In the context of Mv II 27,1/Vin I 125–26 the  
confession is done to one person.

**10. Other Uposatha Regulations**

The Buddha initially allowed bhikkhus to gather together on the  
fourteenth or fifteenth, and eighth day of the half-month to speak on  
Dhamma, but then amended this to a legal act of Uposatha carried out  
by reciting the Pātimokkha; Mv II 3,2/Vin I 102.  
The Pātimokkha should not be formally recited on any day  
except on the Uposatha-day once in a half-month, _pakkha_ ; Mv II 4,1/  
Vin I 104. There are two Uposatha days: the fourteenth and the  
fifteenth day of the month; Mv II 14,1/Vin I 111. The Vinaya and  
Pātimokkha commentaries state that the fourteen day Uposatha falls  
on the 3rd and 7th Uposatha of a season.^6 Uposathas fall on the day  
preceding the moon’s waxing and waning and the two days in the  
middle of these phases, i.e., the 8th, 15th, 23th, and 30th night of the  
lunar month in the case of 15th day Uposathas, and on the 8th, 14th,  
22nd, and 29th night in the case of 14th day Uposathas. The Uposatha

_10. Other Uposatha Regulations_ xxi

should not be done on a non-Uposatha day, an exception being for  
the sake of unity/unanimity/harmony ( _sāmaggī)_ of the Community;  
Mv X 5,14/Vin I 357_._ This type of Uposatha is called a _sāmaggi-  
uposatha_ in the _Parivāra_ (Vin V 123) and the commentaries.  
The Buddha recommended that all bhikkhus learn to count the  
moon-phase/fort-night ( _sabbeh’eva pakkha-gaṇanaṃ uggahetuṃ_ ) after  
laypeople criticised the bhikkhus for not knowing it; Mv II 18,1–2/  
Vin I 117. To avoid monks not knowing that it is the Uposatha, a  
senior monk should announce it at any time during the day; Mv 19.1.  
An explicit rule about telling the season in which the Uposatha  
takes place can not be found, but in the Mv it is said that the  
measuring of the season ( _utuppamānam_ ) should be told at an  
( _upasampadākamma_ ); Mv I 77,1/Vin I 95. It is explained in the  
commentary (Sp 1033) as the mentioning of the season, i.e., one of  
the three Indian seasons (cold, hot, or rainy season).  
Laypeople criticised bhikkhus who did not know the number of  
bhikkhus [in a community] and therefore the Buddha recommended  
counting the bhikkhus. This is to be done on the day of Uposatha. If  
there are a large number of bhikkhus, the counting can be done by way  
of dividing the bhikkhus into batches ( _gaṇa_ - _maggena gaṇetuṃ_ ), or  
counting by way of taking tickets ( _salākaṃ gahetuṃ_ ); Mv II 18,3–4/Vin  
I 117.  
A bhikkhu who does not undertake the exhortation of  
bhikkhunīs after having been authorised by the Bhikkhusaṅgha  
incurs an offence of wrong-doing; Cv X 9,4–5/Vin II 263–64.  
Bhikkhunīs are to ask two things from the Bhikkhusaṅgha every half  
month: the questioning about the Uposatha, and the coming for the  
instruction^7 according to their _pācittiya_ rule no. 59.  
According to the Pātimokkha Commentary (Kkh 6),  
“whatever” ( _yāvatikā_ ) refers to at least four bhikkhus being within  
armslength in a _sīmā_. There is only one canonical reference to  
bhikkhus having to be within armslength during a _saṅghakamma—_ in  
the Padabhājana on Pāc 80, Vin IV 154—and it can be taken to apply  
for all _saṅghakamma_ s. The Padabhājana states that a bhikkhu

6. Kkh 2 (Be): “Herein, two times in the third and the seventh forthnights of the 3  
    seasons of summer, winter, and the rains, [gives] six fourteen day [uposathas],  
    remaining are 18 fifteen day [uposathas], thus in one year there are 24 uposathas. So  
    far, this is the normal practice. But due to the saying: ‘Once on the fourteenth or  
    fifteenth of the forthnight’ (Mv II 4.2/Vin I 104) and due to the saying ‘the visitors  
    have to follow the residents’ (Mv II 34.1/Vin I 132), etc., when there is a cause like  
    that or when there is another, it is proper to do the Uposatha on the fourteenth.”
7. _Uposathapucchakañ-ca ovādupasaṃkamañ-ca;_ Mv II 26,1/Vin I 124. Cf. M III 270.

xxii _Introduction_

commits the _pācittiya_ offence when he goes away more than one  
armslength [-distance] from the assembly.

**11. Boundary (** **_Sīmā_** **)**

The validity of the legal act of Uposatha ( _uposathakamma_ ) is  
dependent on the coming together in one appointed place of all the  
bhikkhus living in one residence (that is surrounded by a formally  
authorised boundary). The rules found in the Uposathakkhandhaka  
regarding the place where the Uposatha is held are as follows:  
In order to prevent bhikkhus from breaking up into groups the  
Buddha forbade bhikkhus to recite the Pātimokkha to their own  
companies ( _parisā_ ) and prescribed a legal act of Uposatha for united  
ones^8 ( _samaggānaṃ);_ Mv II 5,1/Vin I 105. This unity is limited to  
one residence ( _ekāvāsa_ ); Mv II 5,2/Vin I 105.  
A residence is limited by a boundary ( _sīmā_ ) that is to be formally  
authorised through a legal act ( _saṅghakamma_ ). Preceding this legal act  
the [boundary-] markers ( _nimitta_ ) are announced or pointed out  
( _kitteti_ ). There are eight kinds of boundary markers: hills/mountains,  
rocks, forests, [individual] trees, roads, termite-mounds, rivers, (areas  
covered with) water [such as lakes]. After this pointing out of the  
markers, one competent bhikkhu is to make a formal announcement  
followed by a motion ( _ñattidutiyakamma_ ) through which a boundary  
is authorised as far as the markers (extend) all around, for the single  
Uposatha for the same communion; Mv II 6,1–2/Vin I 106.  
The boundary can be three _yojana_ s in diameter at the most; Mv  
II 7,1/Vin I 106. (Sp 1046: One and a half _yojana_ from the centre of  
the residence in each direction.)  
To avoid confusion with regards the place where the Uposatha is  
held, an Uposatha-hall ( _uposathāgāra_ ) i.e., a building or a cave, should  
be formally appointed through an announcement followed by a  
motion; Mv II 8,1/Vin I 107.  
No more than one Uposatha-hall can be formally authorised in  
one residence. If there is more than one Uposatha-hall in one  
residence, then the extra one(s) have to be withdrawn by a formal  
announcement followed by a motion; Mv II 8,3–4/Vin I 107.  
If there are too many bhikkhus to fit into the Uposatha-hall,  
then it is allowable that bhikkhus sit outside and listen to the  
Pātimokkha from there; Mv II 9,1/Vin I 108. An area around the  
Uposatha-hall can be formally authorised for this purpose through  
first mentioning the markers (delimiting the area) and then having

8. BD IV 136: “all together”; see the note on _samagga_ at Sd 10.

_11. Boundary (Sìmá)_ xxiii

one bhikkhu make a formal announcement followed by a motion;  
Mv II 8,4/Vin I 107.  
Senior bhikkhus ( _thera_ s) are to gather together before the junior  
bhikkhus on the Uposatha-day; Mv II 10,1/Vin I 108.  
If there are several residences ( _vihāra_ ) sharing the same _sīmā_ then  
the Uposatha is to be held by all the bhikkhus together after having  
gathered in one [agreed upon] residence or in the residence where the  
most senior bhikkhu lives; Mv II 11,1/Vin I 108.  
The Uposatha should not be done by a non-united ( _vagga_ )  
community; Mv II 11,1/Vin I 108. When there is no formally  
authorised and established boundary ( _asammatasīmā_ ) _,_ then the  
boundary of the village or town depending on which a bhikkhu lives is  
[the boundary for] the same communion and the single Uposatha; Mv  
II 12,7/Vin I 111.  
If a bhikkhu lives in a non-village area, a wilderness ( _arañña_ ),  
[the boundary for] the same communion and single Uposatha is seven  
_abbhantara_^9 all around; Mv II 12,7/Vin I 111.  
All [the area in] a river, sea or lake is without boundary. In a  
river, sea, or lake [the boundary for] the same communion is [the area]  
that a man of average height can throw water all around [i.e., the area  
he can throw water around when standing in one place]; Mv II 12,7/  
Vin I 111.^10  
Boundaries may not be connected or made to overlap. When  
authorising a _sīmā,_ an interspace [between the _sīmās_ ] is to be set aside;  
Mv II 13,1–2/Vin I 111.  
In the Vinaya-commentaries the original regulations regarding  
_sīmās_ are clarified, refined, and also expanded upon. Furthermore, new  
methods are laid down, e.g., the method for describing boundary  
markers. While there is some flexibility in the original regulations, i.e.,  
they can be open to different interpretations, the commentaries try to  
eliminate these grey areas and instead regulate, define, and elucidate  
everything. For example, in the last regulation the exact size of the  
interspace between two _sīmās_ is not defined and is left open for the  
bhikkhus to decide what is suitable, but the commentary states it is to  
be another 7 _abbhantara_ s when the _sīmās_ are between not formally

9. According to Sp 654 one _abbhantara_ is 28 forearm lengths, _hattha_ (the length  
    from the elbow to the fingertip). Taking a _hattha_ to be about 40 cm this gives a  
    length of about 80 m for 7 _abbhantaras_. The Thai interpretation as given in the  
    _Entrance to the Vinaya_ III 44 is that an _abbhantara_ is 14 m., giving a length of  
    about 100 m.
10. This _asammatasīmā_ is important, for example, when bhikkhus are visiting a  
    village or town where there is no monastery, when travelling, when staying in a  
    wilderness or forest, or when travelling on a ship.

xxiv _Introduction_

authorised wilderness _sīmās_ and another space a man can throw water  
around when the _sīmās_ are in water; see Kkh 10–11.  
New terminology is also used in the commentaries, e.g. the for-  
mally authorised boundary ( _sammatasīmā_ ) is renamed “bound-bound-  
ary” ( _baddhasīmā_ ) and the non-authorised boundary ( _asammatasīmā_ )  
is called “non-bound-boundary” _abaddhasīmā._ This terminology is  
due to the new procedure of connecting or binding ( _bandhana_ ) _sīmā_  
markers instead of the original procedure of simply mentioning them_._  
Nowadays, the Uposatha is usually held in an Uposatha-hall in a  
_khaṇḍasīmā,_ which literally means a “broken off boundary,” i.e., a  
subsidiary boundary. This too is a commentarial introduction and the  
_khaṇḍasīmā_ is authorised in order to avoid bhikkhus unknowingly  
entering a large _sīmā_ while a _saṅghakamma_ is going on and thus  
invalidating it.^11  
The _khaṇḍasīmā_ is thus a small _sīmā_ within a larger _sīmā,_ which is  
therefore called a _mahāsīmā_ , “greater boundary,” in the commentaries.  
According to the Uposathakkhandhaka, an interspace has to be set  
aside between different _sīmās_ (see above), and according to the  
commentarial regulations, in the same manner an interspace (of about  
60 cm) is to be made between the _khaṇḍasīmā_ and the _mahāsīmā._ For  
more information on the complex, controversial subject of _sīmā,_ see  
Kkh ch. 1, Sp 1035–1056, Kieffer-Pülz’s works on _sīmās_ , and _Buddhist  
Monastic Code_ II ch. 13.

**12. Common Offences**

The term “common offences” ( _sabhāgāpattiyā_ ) refers to an offence,  
which two or more bhikkhus, or all of the bhikkhus in a community,  
have fallen into. It is an offence of wrong-doing ( _dukkaṭa_ ) to confess  
an offence to another bhikkhu with the same offence and it is also a  
wrong-doing for the bhikkhu who acknowledges/accepts the  
common offence. Instead, such an offence common to both bhikkhus  
has to be confessed to a bhikkhu who has not fallen into the offence;  
Vin I 126/Mv II 27,3.  
If all the bhikkhus in one monastery have fallen into the same  
offence, then this confession can be done by sending one of the  
bhikkhus to another community to confess the offence before  
returning. If that is not possible, then an announcement may be made  
that the community has fallen into a common offence and shall confess

11. _Anupasampanna_ persons can enter a _sīmā_ without invalidating a  
    _saṅghakamma_ , however they shouldn’t be within _hatthapāsa_. The only exception  
    is someone who receives _upasampadā_ and therefore _should_ be within _hatthapāsa_.

_13. Unqualified Persons_ xxv

it when a pure bhikkhu visits. After this announcement the  
Pātimokkha may be carried out.

**13. Unqualified Persons**

The “persons to be excluded” ( _vajjanīyā ca puggalā_ ) in the  
_pubbakaraṇapubbakicca_ refers to the Buddha’s stipulation that the  
Pātimokkha should not be recited in the presence of any persons who  
are not in communion ( _asaṃvāsa_ ) with the Bhikkhusaṅgha, such as  
sāmaṇeras, bhikkhunīs, etc.  
The Buddha regulated that the Pātimokkha is not be recited to an  
assembly where persons who are not in communion are seated within  
armslength ( _hatthapāsa_ ).^12 The persons are: householders (Mv II 16,8/  
Vin I 115), bhikkhunīs; male and female novices; persons who have left  
the training; those who have committed an offence involving defeat;  
those who have been suspended/taken out^13 for not seeing an offence,  
and are not yet restored ( _anosārita_ ) by the community; those who have  
been suspended for not making amends ( _appaṭikata_ ) for their offences,  
etc.; those who have been suspended for not giving up their bad  
views,^14 etc.; those living in communion by stealth;^15 those who have  
departed to another [non-Buddhist] sect; animals, matricides, parricides,  
and killers of arahants, those who have raped or seduced bhikkhunīs,^16  
schismatics, shedders of blood [of the Buddha], hermaphrodites, and  
eunuchs_._  
A novice who has raped or seduced a bhikkhunī is to be expelled  
( _nāsetum_ ); Mv I 60/Vin I 85.  
Persons not to be admitted into the Bhikkhusaṅgha, and who, if  
admitted, are to be expelled are: eunuchs, those who associate by  
stealth, animals, matricides and patricides, killers of arahants, those  
who have raped bhikkhunīs, and hermaphrodites; Mv I 61–68/Vin I  
85–89.

    contexts, but _dūsaka_ also seems to include voluntary intercourse.

xxvi _Introduction_

**14. Suspending the Pātimokkha**

The Buddha, not wishing to recite the Pātimokkha in the presence of  
a bhikkhu who presumably (judging from the terms which the person  
is described) had committed a pārājika offence, ordered that no one  
who has committed an offence should listen to the Pātimokkha-  
recitation, and that the Pātimokkha-recitation can be suspended for a  
bhikkhu who has fallen into an offence; Vin II 240. If a bhikkhu sees,  
hears, or suspects that another bhikkhu has committed an offence, he  
can in the midst of the assembly at the Uposathakamma, announce  
that the bhikkhu has committed an offence, and suspend him from  
attending the Pātimokkha recitation; Vin II 240. The Pātimokkha  
may not then be recited in that bhikkhu’s presence, i.e., the bhikkhu  
has to go away out of _hatthapāsa._

**15. The Invitation by the Elder**

When the bhikkhu(s) have gone through the preliminary duties the  
senior bhikkhu makes a formal invitation to recite the Pātimokkha_._  
This invitation is based on a regulation that one who recites the  
_Pātimokkha_ uninvited incurs a _dukkaṭa_ offence (Mv II 16, 8/Vin I 115).  
The Pātimokkha is the responsibility of the (most) senior  
bhikkhu ( _therādheyyaṃ_ ), if the thera is not able to take it on because  
he is ignorant and unlearned, and does not know the Uposatha or the  
Pātimokkha, then the Buddha allowed the Pātimokkha be taken on  
by another competent bhikkhu; Mv II 17,2/Vin I 116.  
A simple request would to have been made originally, as it is  
mentioned (Mv II 17/ Vin I 116) that monks invited the senior or  
another bhikkhu to recite the Pātimokkha by saying: “Let the  
Venerable Sir recite the Pātimokkha.”  
The formal invitation as given in modern Pātimokkha manuals  
is first found in the medieval Vinaya summary-manual _Mūlasikkhā_ :  
“Having made to undertake the preparations and preliminary duties  
we make the invitation to recite the Disciplinary Code with the  
approval of the united community whose offences have been  
confessed.”^17

**16. The Meaning of** **_Sutta_** **in** **_Suttāgata_** **and** **_Suttavibhaṅga_**

_Sutta_ can mean both “rule” as well as “string” or “sequence” and, as it is  
not really possible to give an adequate as well as elegant translation into

17. _Pubbakaraṇapubbakiccāni samādapetvā desitāpattikassa samaggassa bhikkhu-  
    saṅghassa anumatiyā pātimokkhaṃ uddisituṃ ārādhanaṃ karoma;_ JPTS I 129.

_16. The Meaning of Sutta in Suttágata and Suttavibhaòga_ xxvii

English. The Pātimokkha is also called _Sutta_ , but not a _sutta_ in the sense  
it is used nowadays, i.e. a discourse contained in the Nikāyas, which  
originally was called a _suttanta_ (see below). There are two usages of the  
Sanskrit word _sūtra_. The first is used in the brahmanical tradition to  
denote the collections of brief rules or aphorisms called _sūtras_. This  
usage is because these collections are like strings or threads of short  
rules joined together. The second usage, only found in Buddhist and  
Jaina literature, and sometimes for quite long discourses, is _sūtra_ as  
sanskritization of _sutta_ or _suttanta,_ which is the Pali or Prakrit version  
of the Vedic _sūkta_ “well-spoken,” “good speech,” in the sense of well-  
spoken words of the Buddha. The simile of the flowers tied by a string  
(see below) suggests that _sutta_ as Pātimokkha is derived from the  
brahmanical usage of _sūtra_ as “string,” while _suttanta_ as used for the  
Buddha’s discourses is derived from _sūkta.  
Sutta_ in _suttāgata_ , as used in Pāc 73 and the Pātimokkha  
conclusion and also in Suttavibhaṅga, is a synonym for the  
Pātimokkha since the structure of the Pātimokkha is one of being  
made up of brief rules ( _sutta_ ) strung together into one string. (In a  
similar way the “Rule” of Saint Benedict consists of individual rules.)  
The individual rules in the Pātimokkha are referred to as _sutta_ in the  
phrase used to describe a Vinaya master ( _vinayadhara_ ): “Both  
pātimokkhas are well handed down in breadth to him, well analysed,  
well set forth, well investigated, as to rule, as to detail ( _suttaso  
anubyañjanaso_ )”; Vin I 65, II 95. Sutta refers to both the Bhikkhu and  
Bhikkhunī-pātimokkha rules as contained in the Suttavibhaṅga, while  
“detail” refers to the analysis as given the Suttavibhaṅga.  
The Kkh commentary explains _suttāgataṃ_ in the Pātimokkha  
conclusion as: “ _Suttāgataṃ_ : handed down in the Sutta, in the  
Pātimokkha.” ( _Suttāgatan-ti: sutte pāṭimokkhe āgato_ .)  
Another interpretation is that _sutta_ (also in the enumeration of  
the nine factors of the Dhamma, _navaṅga_ ) is a synonym for the  
_Pātimokkhasutta_. Although the term _Prātimokṣasūtra_ is used in the  
other Buddhist traditions to denote the text corresponding to the  
_Pātimokkha_ in the Theravāda or Pali tradition, there is not one single  
reference to a _Pātimokkhasutta_  
in the entire Pali Canon and its commentaries, etc. The use of  
_Prātimokṣasūtra_ might have originated from a misunderstanding on  
the part of those who translated the Pātimokkha into Sanskrit, of  
_sutta_ as found in Pāc 73, in the Pātimokkha conclusion, and in the  
Suttavibhaṅga.  
In the Pali Canon, the term _sutta_ does not refer to a discourse by  
the Buddha. What is usually called a _sutta_ nowadays is referred to as a  
_suttanta_ in canonical and commentarial Pali texts. For example, the

xxviii _Introduction_

word _Suttapiṭaka_ is not found anywhere in Pali texts; only  
_suttantapiṭaka_ is used.  
In Vin III 8 f., it is said that the _brahmacariya_ under some of the  
previous Buddhas did not last long because these had little “ _sutta_ ,”  
etc., and the training precepts for disciples had not been made known  
and the Pātimokkha had not been recited. The Buddha likened  
disciples of those Buddhas who let the _brahmacariya_ disappear to  
loose flowers on a board that are scattered by the wind since they are  
not tied together by a string ( _suttena_ ).  
This simile shows the meaning of _sutta_ as something that  
preserves the tradition, a concise text consisting of a string or thread of  
aphorisms to hold the tradition together. The Vinaya context of this  
simile indicates that _sutta_ here is the Pātimokkha, or rather the  
individual rules contained therein.

**17. The Term** **_Pārājika_**

The term _pārājika_ denotes the first class of offences in the  
Pātimokkha. This class is also first in gravity as those who commit  
this type of offence also suffer the gravest consequences, i.e., the  
immediate loss of the state of being a bhikkhu and being debarred  
from becoming a bhikkhu again in this life. The meaning of this term  
is somewhat obscure.  
The similes given in the Padabhājana (Vin III 28) emphasize the  
gravity of the four pārājika rules:  
“... like a man who has the head cut off is not able to live with(-  
out) that physical connection, just so a bhikkhu who has engaged in  
the sexual act is (one who is) non-ascetic, not a son of the Sakyan.
(like) a withered leaf freed from its connection (to the tree) is  
incapable of becoming green ... (like) a flat rock broken in two is one  
that cannot be reconnected ... (like) a Palmyra-palm cut off at the  
crown is incapable of growing again ...”  
These four similes are also found with the four “things not to be  
done” ( _akaraṇīya_ ) that are to be explained to newly admitted  
bhikkhus (Vin I 96–97). In the Aṅguttara Nikāya a similar simile is  
given in which a bhikkhu who has fallen into a _pārājika_ offence is  
likened to a criminal punished by public decapitation (A II 240f).  
The Vinaya commentary gives the following explanation:  
“ _Pārājika_ [means] disqualified, fallen into disqualification. This  
word _pārājika_ is usyed in connection with training precepts,  
offences, and persons. Herein, ‘It is impossible, not possible, that  
the Tathāgata, because of some action of the Vajjis or the sons of  
Vajjis, would abolish a training precept involving

_17. The Term Párájika_ xxix

disqualification,’ thus the using in connection with a training  
precept is to be understood. ‘Bhikkhus, you have fallen into an  
offence which is involving disqualification.’ Thus in connection  
with an offence. ‘We are not ones who have been disqualified’  
[and] ‘Whoever has taken away/stolen is one who has been  
disqualified,’ thus the using in connection with a person is to be  
understood. In what starts with: ‘should accuse with a case  
involving disqualification’ (= Sd 9) it is used with a case/rule  
( _dhamma_ ), but because here [with] ‘case’ any offence [and] any  
training precept is understood, it cannot be used independently.  
Regarding the training precept ( _sikkhāpadaṃ_ ): [it]  
disqualifies him ( _parājeti_ ) whoever transgresses it, therefore it is  
said _pārājikaṃ_ [i.e., an adjective qualifying _sikkhāpadaṃ_ ]; the  
offence ( _āpatti_ ), [it] disqualifies him whoever falls into it,  
therefore it is said _pārājikā_ [agreeing with _āpatti_ ); the person  
( _puggalo_ ), because he has been disqualified, fallen into  
disqualification, therefore _pārājiko_ [agreeing with _puggalo_ ] is said.  
In connection with this meaning, it is said in the _Parivāra_  
(Vin V 148): ‘What is called _pārājikaṃ_ , listen to it as it is: [He] has  
fallen away from/is deprived of ( _cuto_ ), fallen short of ( _paraddho_ ),  
and dropped out ( _bhaṭṭho_ ), he has indeed been rejected  
( _niraṅkato_ ) from the True Teaching ( _saddhammā),_ therefore there  
is no communion too, because of that it has been said so.’ For the  
meaning herein is: “the person who is transgressing the training  
precept and has fallen into the offence is one who has fallen  
away” [and thus] is to be interpreted everything_._  
‘Therefore it has been said,’ because of which reason he is a  
non-ascetic, not a son of the Sakyan, is one who has dropped out  
_(paribhaṭṭho_ ), fallen away ( _cuto_ ), has been disqualified ( _parājito_ )  
from the Institution ( _sāsanato_ ), therefore it has been said. What  
[is he]? He is one who has been disqualified.” (Sp 259–60)  
Ann Heirmann^18 discusses the various Pārājika etymologies and  
compares them with the explanations found in the Vinayas of the  
various Buddhist schools extant in Chinese and Sanskrit. She notes  
that the various Vinayas support the etymology based on _parā_ ( _ñ_ ) _c_ :  
_“_ turned away,” “separated,” “disconnected.” The meanings attributed  
to _parāñc_ (cpd form = _parāṅ_ -) in Monier Williams’ _Sanskrit English  
Dictionary_ , “... turned away, averted ... being beyond or outside of  
(abl.),” suggest that this word can have the sense of “disqualifying” and  
“excluding.” This sense of “excluding” is also suggested by the verb  
used in the Pali Vinaya to indicate the course of action other

18. Ann Heirmann, “On Pārājika,” _Buddhist Studies Review_ , 1999: 51–59.

xxx _Introduction_

bhikkhus must take when a bhikkhu has committed _pārājika,_ i.e.,  
_nāseti:_ “one expels,” the causative of _nassati_ (see Pāc 70) _;_ see Vin III 33,  
40, and Vin I 173.  
The first synonym given in the _Parivāra_ verse, _cuta,_ is the  
Sanskrit _cyuta,_ which can mean “fallen away from,” but also “expelled  
from, deprived of (abl.),” e.g. _cyutādhikāra_ means “dismissed from an  
office”; see _Sanskrit English Dictionary_.  
Thus the explanations given in the _Parivāra_ and the similes in  
the Suttavibhaṅga, suggest that the meaning of _pārājika_ is “one who is  
disqualified,” or “... excluded/barred/deprived of/deposed of.” The  
most specific meaning corresponding to _pārājika_ is “deprivation” in  
the archaic sense of removing or deposing someone from an office,  
especially an ecclesiastical one. “Disqualification” and “exclusion” are  
probably the best fits.  
As _pārājika_ occurs together with the adjective _asaṃvāsa_ (“not in  
communion”) in the rules themselves, with _asamaṇa_ : “non-ascetic” in  
the Padabhājana, with the verb _nāseti,_ “expels,” in the Suttavibhaṅga  
to indicate the course of action other monks have to take with a  
monk who fell into a Pārājika offence, and with the similes indicating  
the non-possibility of being re-connected or living again, a rendering  
of _pārājika_ that more or less fits all the etymologies and explanations  
would be “involving disqualification” when it is qualifying _dhamma,_  
and “(one) who is disqualified” when it is qualifying _bhikkhu_.

**18. The Term** **_Saṅghādisesa_**

The meaning and etymology of the word _saṅghādisesa_ is not clearly  
defined in the Suttavibhaṅga and there has been a lot of speculation  
about its meaning by modern as well as ancient scholars. The meaning  
given in the translation in this work is in accordance with the  
Padabhājana and _Samantapāsādikā_ explanations, which are to be  
preferred to the ones of modern scholars.  
The traditional Theravāda Commentarial etymology as given in  
the _Samantapāsādikā_ (see below) is: _saṅgha_ : community + _ādi_ : start,  
commencement, beginning; a masculine noun. + _sesa_ : rest, remainder,  
left-over; neuter noun from _seseti_ ( _ƒsis + e_ ). The compound can be  
resolved in different ways. It could be a tappurisa compound  
involving an instrumental of accompaniment: “the beginning and rest  
(of the legal procedures is to be done) with the Community” or, more  
in accordance with the Padabhājana, an instrumental of means: “the  
beginning and rest (is done) by the Community,” or it could be a  
genitive or dative tappurisa: “the beginning and rest is of/for the  
Community,” or, in accordance with the Sp, an inverted locative

_18. The Term Saòghádisesa_ xxxi

tappurisa compound: “the Community (is required) in the beginning  
and in the rest.”  
The Padabhājana at Vin III 112 explains: “ _Saṅghādiseso_ : only the  
community gives the probation for that offence, throws back to the  
start, gives the deference, reinstates; not a number (of persons), not one  
person, therefore it is called “the community in the beginning and in  
the rest.” It is the naming, the designation, for that very group of  
offences, therefore too it is called “the community in the beginning and  
in the rest.”^19  
The Padabhājana’s _saṅgho va ... na sambahula, na ekapuggalo_ refers  
to the three ways of doing a legal act; see Vin I 323–25 & II 82: “The  
Saṅgha or a number (of persons) or one person admonishes him.” ( _taṃ  
enaṃ codeti saṅgho vā sambahulā vā ekapuggalo vā_ .) A saṅghādisesa  
offence can only be made up for with the co-operation of a Saṅgha, not  
with a number of persons less than a Saṅgha; i.e., at least four for the  
_parivāsadāna_ and _mānattadāna_ and twenty for the _abbhāna_.  
The _Samantapāsādikā_ explains the term as: “The meaning of the  
word here is that a Community is required (lit. to be wanted/wished:  
_icchitabba_ ) for it in the beginning ( _ādimhi_ ) as well as in the rest ( _sese_ ).  
Why is this said? By one who has fallen into this offence and is desir-  
ing to emerge (from it) for those (procedures) that are emergences  
from the offences, a Community is to be required by him at the start  
for the purpose of giving the probation, as well as from (this) start  
onward in the rest (of the procedure, i.e.) in the middle for the pur-  
pose of giving deference, or for the purpose of giving deference  
together with the throwing back to the beginning, and in the end for  
the purpose of the reinstatement. For herein not even one single  
(legal) act can be done without a Community.” (p. 522)  
The Commentary thus takes _ādi_ to mean the start of the proce-  
dure to make up for a Sd offence and _sesa_ to mean the rest or remaining  
part that comes after the start of the procedure i.e., the middle and the  
end of the procedure. This gives the translation: “The community in  
the beginning and in the rest.” This explanation and rendering fits the  
Padabhājana’s explanation since the Padabhājana indicates that only the  
Saṅgha can do the legal actions for the offence. The procedure of  
_parivāsa-dāna_ mentioned in the Padabhājana is the beginning ( _ādi)_ while  
the three procedures of _mūlāya paṭikassana_ , _mānatta-dāna_ , and _abbhāna_  
are the rest ( _sesa)_. The first two procedures of the four are not required  
in all cases and the _sesa_ part may consist of one, two, or three proce-  
dures. “Remainder” or “rest” for _sesa_ will cover all cases.

**SUMMARY OF UPOSATHA PREPARATIONS**

**AND PRELIMINARY DUTIES**

**Burmese Tradition**

The verses with the preparations and preliminary duties  
( _pubbakaraṇapubbakiccāni_ ) are an introduction to the Burmese  
Pātimokkha text _Dvemātikāpā¿i_ (“the Text of the Two Mātikās,” =  
Dm). They are also an introduction to the Sri Lankan _Ubhaya Mātikā_  
(“Both Mātikās” = Um), which is probably used in both the Nikāyas  
(monastic sects) originating in Burma, i.e., the Amarapura and  
Rāmañña Nikāya.

_Pubbakaraṇaṃ_ :  
_Sammajjanī padīpo ca, udakaṃ āsanena ca;  
Uposathassa etāni, pubbakaraṇan-ti vuccati.  
Pubbakiccaṃ_ :  
_Chandapārisuddhi, utukkhānaṃ, bhikkhugaṇanā ca ovādo;  
Uposathassa etāni, pubbakiccan-ti vuccati.  
Pattakalla-aṅgā_ :  
_Uposatho yāvatikā ca bhikkhū kammappattā;  
Sabhāgāpattiyo ca na vijjanti;  
Vajjanīyā ca puggalā tasmiṃ na honti, pattakallan-ti vuccati.  
Pubbakaraṇapubbakiccāni samāpetvā desitāpattikassa samaggassa  
bhikkhusaṅghassa anumatiyā pātimokkhaṃ uddisituṃ ārādhanaṃ  
karoma._  
The broom and the lamp, the water with the seat  
these are called: “the preparation for the observance.”  
The consent and purity, the telling of the season,  
the counting of the bhikkhus and the instruction [of the  
bhikkhunīs],  
these are called: “the preliminary duty for the observance.”  
The observance, whatever bhikkhus are entitled [to carry out  
the legal] act,  
common offences are not found,  
there are no persons to be excluded in there,  
this is called: “reached suitability.”  
Having made to undertake the preparations and preliminary  
duties we make the invitation to recite the Disciplinary Code with the  
approval of the united community whose offences have been confessed.

2 _Bhikkhupátimokkha_

**Siyam Nikāya, Amarapura Nikāya and Mahānikāya**

In the Sri Lankan Siam Nikāya and in the Thai Mahā Nikāya an  
almost identical version of the _pubbakaraṇapubbakiccāni_ is used.  
There are only some small differences between the editions. This ver-  
sion is the source for both of the modern versions as used by the  
Dhammayuttika Nikāya and by the Rāmañña Nikāya; see below.

### Texts Consulted

looks like an ola-leaf manuscript, published by the Sri Vajirañāṇa-  
dhammāyatana, Mahāragama, Sri Lanka. Year not given (1960s). Used  
in the Amarapura Nikāya.

Ra: version given in the _Ratanārtha-sūdani-namvu-bhikṣu-bhikṣuṇī-  
prātimokṣa-varṇanāva,_ edited by Soṇuttara Jinaratana thera and

### The Preliminary Duty^22

Before doing the Uposatha the ninefold duty should be done:

The sweeping of that place; the lighting of the lamp there; the  
spreading of the sitting mats; the preparing of the sitting mats; the  
bringing of the consent of the bhikkhus who are deserving [to give  
their] consent; and of those bhikkhus who do not participate in the  
Uposatha the bringing of the purity too; the telling of the season; the  
counting of the bhikkhus, and the instructing of the bhikkhunīs.

Herein the first four [duties] have been done and completed by  
monastery-attendants who know the bhikkhus’ protocol and by  
bhikkhus.

[Or when there is daylight:] Herein with regards the first four duties  
there is no duty of [lighting] the lamp because of the state of there

22. Cf. the translation in ñm 1966: 6–10, 1969: 53–58.


Summary of Uposatha Preparations and Preliminary Duties 13


being sunlight now, the three other ones have been done and  
completed by monastery-attendants who know the bhikkhus’  
protocol and by bhikkhus.

There is no bringing of consent [and] bringing of purity because of  
the absence in this boundary of seated bhikkhus who have left arm’s  
length.

The so-called “telling the season” is declaring the season thus: this  
number [of Uposathas] have passed, this number [of Uposathas] are  
left.

In this dispensation there are three seasons, [namely] winter, summer,  
and rains.

This is the winter season, and in this season there are eight Uposathas.

With this fortnight one Uposatha has arrived, two Uposathas have  
past, five Uposathas are left.

Thus the telling of the season is to be borne in mind by all the  
venerables.

[So it is, Venerable Sir! (To be said by all bhikkhus participating in the  
Uposatha. The word “sir” should be omitted by bhikkhus more  
senior than the reciter.)]

The so-called “counting of the bhikkhus” is the counting of the  
bhikkhus [thus]: “In this Uposatha-hall so many bhikkhus have  
gathered for the purpose of [performing] the Uposatha.”

In this Uposatha-hall four bhikkhus have gathered.

[So it is, Venerable Sir!]

There is no instruction of the bhikkhunīs now because of their non-  
existence.

Thus, because of the state of having been done of the preliminary  
duties, which had an opportunity of doing (them), and because of the  
naturalness of the preliminary duties which had no opportunity of  
doing (them), the nine-fold Preliminary Function has been completed.

When the preliminary duty is finished:

If the day is a certain one of the fourteenth [day Uposathas], fifteenth  
[day Uposathas], or the Unity [Uposathas], as today is the fifteenth  
day/fourteenth day/Unity Uposatha.

Whatever bhikkhus are entitled (to carry out the legal) act, who are  
qualified for the Uposatha of the Community, four or more than that,  
regular, who have not committed an offence of pārājika, who have not  
been suspended by the Community, and they, not having left arms-  
length, remain in one boundary, and if among them common offences,  
founded on eating at the wrong time and so on, are not found, and if

14 _Bhikkhupátimokkha_

among them within arms-length there is no person fit to be excluded,  
who is to be excluded from arms-length by making [him go] outside,  
then that [legal] act of Uposatha endowed with these four  
characteristics is called “[one that] has reached suitability,” [and is] fit to  
be performed.

Having known the state of reached suitability of the [legal] act of  
Uposatha, it is to be approved of by the Community [that] the  
Uposatha is being done now.

(If junior:) Good, Venerable Sir! / (If Senior:) Good, Friend!

(Senior monk): Having concluded the preparations and preliminary  
duties, I make the invitation to recite the Disciplinary Code with the  
approval of the seated Community.”

Whoever may have an offence, he should disclose [it]. When there is  
no offence, [then it] is to be silent. By the silence I shall know the  
Venerables [with the thought]: “[They are] pure.” As an answer  
occurs to [a bhikkhu] who is asked individually, just so in such an  
assembly [as this one] there is the announcement up to the third time.  
But if any bhikkhu, [who is] remembering [an offence] when the  
announcement is being made up to the third time, should not disclose  
the existing offence, there is [a further offence of] deliberate false  
speech for him. Now, venerables, deliberate false speech has been  
called an obstructive act by the Fortunate One. Therefore, by a  
bhikkhu who is remembering, who has committed [an offence], who  
is desiring purification, an existing offence is to be disclosed; because,  
[after] having disclosed [it], there is comfort for him.

Venerables, the four cases involving disqualification have been recited, a  
bhikkhu who has committed any one of them, does not obtain the  
communion with bhikkhus. As [he was] before, so [he is] after  
[committing it]: he is one who is disqualified, not in communion.

Concerning that I ask the Venerables: [Are you] pure in this?  
A second time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?

Saṅghādisesuddeso niṭṭhito.^46


Venerables, the thirteen cases involving the community in the  
beginning and in the rest have been recited, nine [cases] are of the  
offence-at-once [-class], four [cases] are of the up-to-the-third [time  
admonition-class]. A bhikkhu who has committed any one of [these  
offenses], has to stay on probation with no choice [in the matter] for  
as many days as he knowingly conceals [it]. Moreover, by a bhikkhu  
who has stayed on the probation, a six-night state of deference to  
[other] bhikkhus has to be entered upon. [When] the bhikkhu [is one  
by whom] the deference has been performed: wherever there may be  
a community of bhikkhus, which is a group of twenty [or more  
bhikkhus], there that bhikkhu should be reinstated. If a community  
of bhikkhus, which is a group of twenty deficient by even one  
[bhikkhu], should reinstate that bhikkhu [then] that bhikkhu is not  
reinstated, and those monks are blameworthy. This is the proper  
procedure here.

Concerning that I ask the venerables: [Are you] pure in this?  
A second time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?  
A third time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?  
The venerables are pure in this, therefore there is silence, so do I bear  
this [in mind].

The recitation involving the community in the beginning and the rest  
is finished.

Now, if a king or a kings’ official or a brahmin or a male householder  
should convey by messenger a robe-fund for a bhikkhu [saying]:  
“Having traded this robe-fund for a robe, clothe the bhikkhu named  
so and so with a robe,” and if that messenger, having approached that  
bhikkhu, should say so: “Venerable Sir, this robe-fund has been  
brought for the venerable one. Let the venerable one accept the robe-  
fund!” [then] that messenger should be spoken to thus by that  
bhikkhu: “Friend, we do not accept a robe-fund, but we do accept a  
robe at the right time [when it is] allowable.” If that messenger should  
say thus to that bhikkhu: “Is there, perhaps, someone who is the  
steward of the venerable one?” [then,] bhikkhus, by a bhikkhu who is  
in need of a robe, a steward can be appointed: a monastery attendant  
or a male lay-follower [saying]: “Sir, this is the bhikkhus’ steward.” If  
that messenger having instructed that steward, having approached  
that bhikkhu, should say so: “Venerable Sir, the steward whom the  
venerable one has appointed has been instructed by me. Let the  
venerable one approach [him] at the right time [and] he will clothe  
you with a robe,” [then] bhikkhus, having approached the steward,  
[the steward] can be prompted [and] can be reminded two or three  
times by the bhikkhu who is in need of a robe [saying]: “Friend, I am  
in need of a robe.” [If through] prompting [and] reminding [him] two  
or three times, he should have [him] bring forth that robe, it is good.  
If he should not have [him] bring [it] forth, [then] four times, five  
times, six times at the most, [it] can be stood [for] by [a bhikkhu] who  
has become silent. [If through] standing silently for [it] four times,  
five times, six times at the most, he should have [him] bring forth that  
robe, it is good; if [through] making effort more than that, he should  
have [him] produce that robe, [this is a case] involving expiation with  
forfeiture.  
If he should not have [him] produce [it], [then] from wherever  
the robe-fund may have been brought, there [he] himself can go, or a  
messenger can be sent [saying]: “Sirs, that robe-fund which you

Let the sirs endeavour for [what is their] own. Let not [what is their]  
own get lost.” This is the proper procedure here.

Recited, Venerables, have been the seven cases that are settlements of

Concerning that I ask the Venerables: [Are you] pure in this?  
A second time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?  
A third time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?

The venerables are pure in this, therefore there is silence, thus I keep  
this [in mind].
