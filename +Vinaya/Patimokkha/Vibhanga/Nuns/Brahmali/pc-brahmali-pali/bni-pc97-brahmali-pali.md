## Vinaya Piṭaka - Monastic Rules

## Bhikkhunī Vibhaṅga
### B. Brahmali

#### Pācittiya 97:  i.e. The bhikkhus' Pācittiya 1 The Training Rule on Lying.

- Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Brahmali.   

1Venerables, these ninety-two rules on confession come up for recitation.

2Homage to the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One

#### Origin

3At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, Hatthaka the Sakyan had been beaten in debate. While talking with the monastics of other religions, he would assert things after denying them, and he would deny things after asserting them. He evaded the issues, lied, and made sham appointments. The monastics of other religions complained and criticized him, “When Hatthaka talks with us, how can he assert things after denying them, deny things after asserting them, evade the issues, lie, and make sham appointments?”

4The monks heard the complaints of those monastics of other religions. They then went to Hatthaka and said, “Is it true, Hatthaka, that you’re doing this?”

“These monastics of other religions should be beaten, whatever it takes! They shouldn’t be allowed to win.”

The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “When Hatthaka talks with the monastics of other religions, how can he assert things after denying them, deny things after asserting them, evade the issues, lie, and make sham appointments?”

5After rebuking Hatthaka in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Hatthaka: “Is it true, Hatthaka, that you’re doing this?”


“It’s true, Sir.”

The Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

#### Final ruling

6‘If a monk lies in full awareness, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”

#### Definitions

7**Lies in full awareness:** the speech of one who is aiming to deceive—his words, his way of speaking, his breaking into speech, his verbal expression, his eight kinds of ignoble speech: he says that he has seen what he has not seen; he says that he has heard what he has not heard; he says that he has sensed what he has not sensed; he says that he has mentally experienced what he has not mentally experienced; he says that he has not seen what he has seen; he says that he has not heard what he has heard; he says that he has not sensed what he has sensed; he says that he has not mentally experienced what he has mentally experienced.

#### Permutations

#### Definitions

8**Not seen:** not seen with the eye. **Not heard:** not heard with the ear. **Not sensed:** not smelled with the nose, not tasted with the tongue, not touched with the body. **Not mentally experienced:** not mentally experienced with the mind. **Seen:** seen with the eye. **Heard:** heard with the ear. **Sensed:** smelled with the nose, tasted with the tongue, touched with the body. **Mentally experienced:** mentally experienced with the mind.

#### Exposition

#### Falsely claiming to have experienced what he has not experienced: a single sense door

15… when four conditions are fulfilled … when five conditions are fulfilled … when six conditions are fulfilled … If he lies in full awareness, saying that he has mentally experienced what he has not mentally experienced, he commits an offense entailing confession when seven conditions are fulfilled: before he has lied, he knows he is going to lie; while lying, he knows he is lying; after he has lied, he knows he has lied; he misrepresents his view of what is true; he misrepresents his belief of what is true; he misrepresents his acceptance of what is true; he misrepresents his sentiment of what is true.
