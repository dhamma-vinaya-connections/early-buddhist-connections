## Vinaya Piṭaka - Monastic Rules

## Bhikkhunī Vibhaṅga
### B. Brahmali

#### Pācittiya 155:  i.e. The bhikkhus' Pācittiya 77 Not To Arouse Remorse, Doubts Or Anguish In Another Bhikkhunī's Mind.

- Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Brahmali.   

#### Origin

1At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, the monks from the group of six intentionally made the monks from the group of seventeen anxious. They said:

“The Buddha has laid down a rule that a person who is less than twenty years old shouldn’t be given the full ordination. And you were less than twenty when you got the full ordination. Could it be that you’re not fully ordained?” They cried.


Other monks asked them why, and they said:

“The monks from the group of six intentionally make us anxious.”

2The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can the monks from the group of six do this?” …

“Is it true, monks, that you do this?”


“It’s true, Sir.”

The Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

#### Final ruling

3‘If a monk intentionally makes a monk anxious, thinking, “In this way he will be ill at ease at least for a moment,” and he does so only for this reason and no other, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”

#### Definitions

4**A:** whoever … **Monk:** … The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.


5**A monk:** another monk.

6**Intentionally:** knowing, perceiving, having intended, having decided, he transgresses.


7**Makes anxious:** if he makes him anxious, saying, “It would seem that you were less than twenty years old when you were given the full ordination,” “It would seem that you have eaten at the wrong time,” “It would seem that you have drunk alcohol,” “It would seem that you have been sitting in private with a woman,” he commits an offense entailing confession.

8**He does so only for this reason and no other:** there is no other reason for making him anxious.

#### Permutations

9If it is one who is fully ordained, and he perceives him as such, and he intentionally makes him anxious, he commits an offense entailing confession. If it is one who is fully ordained, but he is unsure of it, and he intentionally makes him anxious, he commits an offense entailing confession. If it is one who is fully ordained, but he does not perceive him as such, and he intentionally makes him anxious, he commits an offense entailing confession.

10If he intentionally makes one who is not fully ordained anxious, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is one who is not fully ordained, but he perceives them as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is one who is not fully ordained, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is one who is not fully ordained, and he does not perceive them as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

#### Non-offenses

11There is no offense: if, not wanting to make him anxious, he says, “It would seem that you were less than twenty years old when you were given the full ordination,” “It would seem that you have eaten at the wrong time,” “It would seem that you have drunk alcohol,” “It would seem that you have been sitting in private with a woman,” and then “Find out about it, so that you don’t get anxious later;” if he is insane; if he is the first offender.

12The training rule on intentionally, the seventh, is finished.
