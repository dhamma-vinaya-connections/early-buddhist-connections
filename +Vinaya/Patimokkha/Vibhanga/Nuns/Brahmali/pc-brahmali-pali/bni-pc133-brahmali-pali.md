## Vinaya Piṭaka - Monastic Rules

## Bhikkhunī Vibhaṅga
### B. Brahmali

#### Pācittiya 133:  i.e. The bhikkhus' Pācittiya 52 Not To Tickle Abother Bhikkhunī.

- Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Brahmali.   

#### Origin

1On one occasion when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, the monks from the group of six tickled one of the monks from the group of seventeen to make him laugh. Not being able to catch his breath, he died.

2The monks of few desires complained and criticized them:

“How could the monks from the group of six tickle a monk to make him laugh?” …

“Is it true, monks, that you did this?”


“It’s true, Sir.”

The Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

#### Final ruling

3‘If a monk tickles someone, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”

#### Definitions

4**Tickles another:** if one who is fully ordained touches another who is fully ordained, body to body, with the aim of making him laugh, he commits an offense entailing confession.

#### Permutations

If the other person is fully ordained, and he perceives him as such, and he tickles him to make him laugh, he commits an offense entailing confession. If the other person is fully ordained, but he is unsure of it, and he tickles him to make him laugh, he commits an offense entailing confession. If the other person is fully ordained, but he does not perceive him as such, and he tickles him to make him laugh, he commits an offense entailing confession.

5If, with his own body, he touches what is connected to the other monk’s body, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If, with what is connected to his own body, he touches the other monk’s body, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If, with what is connected to his own body, he touches what is connected to the other monk’s body, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

If, by releasing something, he touches the other monk’s body, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If, by releasing something, he touches what is connected to the other monk’s body, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If, by releasing something, he touches what is released by the other monk, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

6If, with his own body, he touches the body of someone who is not fully ordained, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If, with his own body, he touches what is connected to the body of someone who is not fully ordained, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If, with what is connected to his own body, he touches the body of someone who is not fully ordained, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If, with what is connected to his own body, he touches what is connected to the body of someone who is not fully ordained, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

If, by releasing something, he touches the body of someone who is not fully ordained, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If, by releasing something, he touches what is connected to the body of someone who is not fully ordained, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If, by releasing something, he touches what is released by the someone who is not fully ordained, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

If the other person is not fully ordained, but he perceives them as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If the other person is not fully ordained, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If the other person is not fully ordained, and he does not perceive them as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

#### Non-offenses

7There is no offense: if he is not aiming to make him laugh; if he touches him when there is a need; if he is insane; if he is the first offender.

8The training rule on tickling, the second, is finished.
