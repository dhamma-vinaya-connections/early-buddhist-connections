## Vinaya Piṭaka - Monastic Rules

## Nissaggiya Pācittiya 7: After Having Asked for a Fund for a Particular Purpose, Diverting it to Another Purpose.
### B. Brahmali

- Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Brahmali.   

#### Origin

1At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the lay followers collected voluntary contributions to supply the Sangha of nuns with robes. They stored the requisites in a cloth merchant’s shop, and then went to the nuns and said, “Venerables, requisites to be used for robes are stored in such-and-such a cloth merchant’s shop. Please have someone get cloth from that and share it out.”

2But even though they had asked for them, the nuns exchanged those requisites for tonics, which they then used. When the lay followers found out about this, they complained and criticized them, “When requisites belonging to the Sangha are designated for a specific purpose and were asked for, how could the nuns exchange them for something else?” …

“Is it true, monks, that the nuns did this?”


“It’s true, Sir.”

The Buddha rebuked them …

“When requisites belonging to the Sangha are designated for a specific purpose and were asked for, how could the nuns exchange them for something else? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

#### Final ruling

3‘When a requisite belonging to the Sangha is designated for a specific purpose and was asked for, if a nun exchanges it for something else, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”

#### Definitions

4**A:** whoever … **Nun:** … The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.


5**A requisite is designated for a specific purpose:** it was given for a specific purpose.

6**Belonging to the Sangha:** belonging to the Sangha, not to a group, not to an individual nun.

7**Was asked for:** that she herself had asked for.

8**Exchanges it for something else:** if, apart from the purpose for which it was given, she exchanges it for something else, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct. When she gets it, it becomes subject to relinquishment.

It is to be relinquished to a saṅgha, a group, or an individual nun. “And, monks, it’s to be relinquished like this. To be expanded as in [[bi-vb-np1#relinquishing|Nissaggiya Pācittiya 1, paragraph 8]] with appropriate substitutions.

‘Venerables, this thing, which I got in exchange for a requisite belonging to the Sangha that was designated for a specific purpose and had been asked for, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ … the Sangha should give … you should give … ‘I give this back to you.’”

#### Permutations

9If it is for a specific purpose and she perceives that it is, and she exchanges it for something else, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is for a specific purpose, but she is unsure of it, and she exchanges it for something else, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is for a specific purpose, but she does not perceive that it is, and she exchanges it for something else, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. When she receives in return what had been relinquished, it is to be used in accordance with the intention of the donors.

10If it is not for a specific purpose, but she perceives that it is, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is not for a specific purpose, but she is unsure of it, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is not for a specific purpose, and she does not perceive that it is, there is no offense.

#### Non-offenses

11There is no offense: if she uses the remainder; if she uses it after getting permission from the owners; if there is an emergency; if she is insane; if she is the first offender.

12The seventh training rule is finished.
