## Vinaya Piṭaka - Monastic Rules

## Bhikkhunī Vibhaṅga
### B. Brahmali

#### Nissaggiya Pācittiya 9: After Having Asked for a Fund for a Particular Purpose, Using it for a Different Purpose.

- Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Brahmali.   

#### Origin

1At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the nuns staying in the yard belonging to a certain association were weak because of a lack of congee. Then, after collecting voluntary contributions to supply the nuns with congee, that association stored the ingredients in a shop. They then went to the nuns and said, “Venerables, congee ingredients are stored in such-and-such a shop. Please have someone get rice from that, have congee cooked, and then eat it.” But even though they had asked for them, the nuns exchanged those ingredients for tonics, which they then used.

2When that association found out about this, they complained and criticized them, “When collective ingredients are designated for a specific purpose and were asked for, how could the nuns exchange them for something else?” … “Is it true, monks, that the nuns did this?”

“It’s true, Sir.”

The Buddha rebuked them … “When collective ingredients are designated for a specific purpose and were asked for, how could the nuns exchange them for something else? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

#### Final ruling

3‘When a collective requisite is designated for a specific purpose and was asked for, if a nun exchanges it for something else, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”

#### Definitions

4**A:** whoever … **Nun:** … The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.


5**A requisite is designated for a specific purpose:** it was given for a specific purpose.

6**Collective:** belonging to a group, not to the Sangha, not to an individual nun.

7**Was asked for:** that she herself had asked for.


8**Exchanges it for something else:** if, apart from the purpose for which it was given, she exchanges it for something else, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct. When she gets it, it becomes subject to relinquishment.


It is to be relinquished to a saṅgha, a group, or an individual nun. “And, monks, it’s to be relinquished like this. To be expanded as in [[bi-vb-np1#relinquishing|Nissaggiya Pācittiya 1, paragraph 8]] with appropriate substitutions.

‘Venerables, this thing, which I got in exchange for a collective requisite that was designated for a specific purpose and had been asked for, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ … the Sangha should give … you should give … ‘I give this back to you.’”

#### Permutations

9If it is for a specific purpose and she perceives that it is, and she exchanges it for something else, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is for a specific purpose, but she is unsure of it, and she exchanges it for something else, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is for a specific purpose, but she does not perceive that it is, and she exchanges it for something else, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. When she receives in return what had been relinquished, it is to be used in accordance with the intention of the donors.

10If it is not for a specific purpose, but she perceives that it is, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is not for a specific purpose, but she is unsure of it, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is not for a specific purpose, and she does not perceive that it is, there is no offense.

#### Non-offenses

11There is no offense: if she uses the remainder; if she uses it after getting permission from the owners; if there is an emergency; if she is insane; if she is the first offender.

12The ninth training rule is finished.
