## Vinaya Piṭaka - Monastic Rules

## Nissaggiya Pācittiya 14:  i.e. The bhikkhus' Nissaggiya Pācittiya 2  Not to spend the night apart from one of her robes.
### B. Brahmali

- Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Brahmali.   

#### Origin

#### First sub-story

1At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the monks stored one of their robes with other monks and then left to wander the country in a sarong and an upper robe. Because they were stored for a long time, the robes became mouldy. The monks put them out in the sun.

Then, while walking about the dwellings, Venerable Ānanda noticed that the monks were sunning those robes. He asked them, “Whose mouldy robes are these?” And they told him what had happened. Venerable Ānanda complained and criticized them, “How can those monks store a robe with other monks and then leave to wander the country in a sarong and an upper robe?”

2After rebuking those monks in many ways, Venerable Ānanda told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that there are monks who do this?”


“It’s true, Sir.”

The Buddha rebuked them … “How can those foolish men do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

#### Preliminary ruling

3“When her robe is finished and the robe season has ended, if a nun stays apart from her five robes even for a single day, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.”

4In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.

#### Second sub-story

5At one time a certain monk at Kosambī was sick. His relatives sent him a message, saying, “Come, Venerable, we’ll nurse you.” The monks urged him to go, but he said, “The Buddha has laid down a training rule that you can’t be apart from your three robes. Now because I’m sick, I’m unable to travel with my three robes. So I can’t go.”

They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“Monks, I allow you to give permission to a sick nun to stay apart from her five robes.


And it should be given like this. After approaching the Sangha, the sick monk should arrange his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, ‘Venerables, I’m sick. I’m unable to travel with my three robes. I ask the Sangha for permission to stay apart from my three robes.’ And he should ask a second and a third time. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:

6‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The monk so-and-so is sick. He is unable to travel with his three robes. He is asking the Sangha for permission to stay apart from his three robes. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes. This is the motion.

7Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The monk so-and-so is sick. He is unable to travel with his three robes. He is asking the Sangha for permission to stay apart from his three robes. The Sangha gives permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes. Any monk who approves of giving permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.

8The Sangha has given permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’

9And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

#### Final ruling

10‘When her robe is finished and the robe season has ended, if a nun stays apart from her five robes even for a single day, except if the nuns have agreed, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’

#### Definitions

11**When his robe is finished:** the monk has made a robe; or the robe-cloth has been lost, destroyed, or burned; or his expectation of receiving further robe-cloth is disappointed.

13**The robe season has ended:** it has ended according to one of the eight key phrases or the Sangha has ended it.

13**If a monk stays apart from his three robes even for a single day:** from the outer robe, the upper robe, or the sarong.

14**Except if the monks have agreed:** unless the monks have agreed.


15**Entailing relinquishment:** it becomes subject to relinquishment at dawn.

The robe should be relinquished to a saṅgha, a group, or an individual. “And, monks, it should be relinquished like this. To be expanded as in [[bi-vb-np1#relinquishing|Nissaggiya Pacittiya 1, paragraph 8]] with appropriate substitutions.

‘Venerables, this robe, which I have stayed apart from for one day without the agreement of the monks, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ … the Sangha should give … you should give … ‘I give this robe back to you.’”
