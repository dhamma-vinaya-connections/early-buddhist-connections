# Nuns’ Deciding of Legal Questions (_Adhikaraṇasamatha_)

*BD.3.426* These seven rules,[^1] ladies, for the deciding of legal questions come up for recitation. For the deciding, for the settlement of legal questions arising from time to time:

1.  *Bi-As.1*A verdict in the presence of may be given.

6.  *Bi-As.6*The decision for specific depravity.
7.  *Bi-As.*The covering up (as) with grass.

* * *

Recited, ladies, are the seven rules for the deciding of legal questions. Concerning them I ask the ladies … thus do I understand this.

## Nuns’ Conclusion

Recited, ladies, is the occasion, recited are the eight rules for offences involving defeat, recited are the seventeen rules for offences entailing a formal meeting of the Order, recited are the thirty rules for offences of expiation involving forfeiture, recited are the hundred and sixty-six rules for offences of expiation, recited are the eight rules for offences which ought to be confessed, recited are the rules for training, recited are the seven rules for the deciding of legal questions. So much (of the sayings) of the lord, handed down in clauses, contained in clauses, comes up for recitation every half month. All should train therein in harmony, on friendly terms, without contention.
