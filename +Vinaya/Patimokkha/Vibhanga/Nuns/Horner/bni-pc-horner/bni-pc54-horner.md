# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 54

*Bi-Pc.54.1.1* *BD.3.348* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a certain brahmin, having invited nuns, *Vin.4.311* offered them food[^1] …” …

“Whatever nun, being invited or being satisfied,[^2] should eat or partake of solid food or soft food, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.54.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Being invited means: being invited to any one meal of the five (kinds of) meals.

Being satisfied means: eating is to be seen, a meal is to be seen, standing within a reach of the hand, she asks (her), a refusal is to be seen.[^3]

Solid food means: setting aside the five (kinds of) meals, conjey,[^4] food (that may be eaten) during a watch of the night, during seven days, during life, the rest means solid food.[^5]

Soft food means: the five (kinds of) meals: … meat.[^6]

If she accepts, thinking: “I will eat, I will partake of,” there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful, there is an offence of expiation.[^7] If she *BD.3.349* accepts for the sake of nutriment (food to be eaten) during a watch of the night, during seven days, during life, there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful, there is an offence of wrong-doing.[^8]

* * *

*Bi-Pc.54.2.2* There is no offence if, being invited (but) not being satisfied, she drinks conjey; if she eats having asked the owner (for permission); if when there is a reason she makes use of (food to be eaten) during a watch of the night, during seven days, during life[^9]; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer. *Vin.4.312*
