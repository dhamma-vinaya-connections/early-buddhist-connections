# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 81

*Bi-Pc.81.1.1* *BD.3.396* … at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding place. Now at that time the nun Thullanandā thinking: “I will ordain a probationer,” having had monks who were elders convened, having seen sumptuous solid foods and soft foods, saying: “Masters, I will not ordain the probationer yet,” having dismissed the monks who were elders, having had Devadatta, Kokālika, Kaṭamorakatissaka, the son of the lady Khaṇḍā and Samuddadatta[^1] convened, she ordained the probationer. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā ordain a probationer by showing[^2] favouritism[^3] to (monks) placed on probation[^4]?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā ordained a probationer by showing favouritism to (monks) placed on probation?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … (monks) placed on probation? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should ordain a probationer by showing favouritism to (monks) placed on probation, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.81.2.1* *BD.3.397* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case. *Vin.4.336*

By showing favouritism to (monks) placed on probation means: to a company that has risen.[^5]

* * *

Probationer means: … *Bi-Pc.80.2* … and an offence of wrong-doing for the group and for the woman teacher.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.81.2.2* There is no offence if she ordains her if the company has not risen; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
