# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 56

*Bi-Pc.56.1.1* *BD.3.352* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time several nuns, having spent the rains in a village residence, went to Sāvatthī. Nuns spoke thus to these nuns: “Where did the ladies spend the rains? We hope that the exhortation was effective?”[^1]

“There were no monks there, ladies; how could the exhortation be effective?” Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:

“How can these nuns spend the rains in a residence where there is no monk?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nuns … where there was no monk?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can the nuns … where there is no monk? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should spend the rains in a residence where there is no monk, there is an offence of expiation.”[^2]

* * *

*Bi-Pc.56.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

A residence where there is no monk means: it is not possible to go for exhortation[^3] or for communion.[^4] *BD.3.353* If she thinks, “I will spend the rains,” (and) prepares a lodging, provides drinking water and water for washing, sweeps a cell, there is an offence of wrong-doing. With sunrise, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.56.2.2* There is no offence if monks, having entered on the rains-settlement, come to have gone away or left the Order or done their time or gone over to (another) side; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.[^5]
