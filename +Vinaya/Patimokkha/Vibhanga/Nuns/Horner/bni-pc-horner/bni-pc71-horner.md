# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 71

*Bi-Pc.71.1.1* *BD.3.381* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns ordained a maiden[^1] who was under twenty years of age. These were unable to endure cold … *Bi-Pc.65*. _Instead of_ a girl married for less than full twelve years _read_ a maiden who is under twenty years of age; _instead of_ for full twelve years _read_ twenty years of age. … “… this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should ordain a maiden under twenty years of age, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.71.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Under twenty years of age means: not attained to twenty years of age.[^2]

Maiden means: she is called a female novice.

Should ordain means: … *Bi-Pc.65.2*. _Read_ who is under twenty years of age, who has completed twenty years of age. … if she is the first wrong-doer.
