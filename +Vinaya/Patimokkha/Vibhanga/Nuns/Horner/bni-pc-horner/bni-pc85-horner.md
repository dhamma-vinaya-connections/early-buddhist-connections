# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 85

*Bi-Pc.85.1.1* *BD.3.402* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six nuns went[^1] in a vehicle.[^2] People … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns go in a vehicle, like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six nuns go in a vehicle?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six nuns went in a vehicle?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can this group of six nuns go in a vehicle? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training: *Vin.4.339*

“Whatever nun should go in a vehicle, there is an offence of expiation.”[^3]

And thus this rule of training for nuns came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.85.1.2* Now at that time a certain nun came to be ill. She was not able to go on foot. They told this matter to the lord. He said: “I allow, monks, a vehicle for a nun who is ill.[^4] And thus, monks … this rule of training:

*BD.3.403*“Whatever nun who is not ill should go in a vehicle, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.85.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Not ill means: she is able to go on foot.

Ill means: she is not able to go on foot.

Vehicle[^5] means: a cart,[^6] a carriage, a waggon, a chariot, a palanquin,[^7] or a sedan chair.[^8]

Should go means: if she goes even once, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.85.2.2* If she thinks that she is not ill when she is not ill (and) goes in a vehicle, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether she is not ill … If she thinks that she is ill when she is not ill … offence of expiation. If she thinks that she is not ill when she is ill, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether she is ill, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is ill when she is ill, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.85.2.3* There is no offence if she is ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
