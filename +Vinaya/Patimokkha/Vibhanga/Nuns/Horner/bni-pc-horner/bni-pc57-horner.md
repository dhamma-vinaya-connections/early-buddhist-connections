# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 57

*Bi-Pc.57.1.1* *BD.3.354* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time several nuns, having kept the rains in a village residence, went to Sāvatthī. Nuns spoke thus to these nuns: “Where did the ladies keep the rains? Was an Order of monks *Vin.4.314* ‘invited’[^1]?”

“Ladies, we did not ‘invite’ an Order of monks.” Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns, having spent the rains, not ‘invite’ an Order of monks?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns … did not ‘invite’ an Order of monks?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can nuns … not ‘invite’ an Order of monks? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun, having kept the rains, should not ‘invite’ both Orders in respect of three matters: what was seen or heard or suspected, there is an offence of expiation.”[^2]

* * *

*Bi-Pc.57.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Having kept the rains means: having kept the first three months or the last three months.[^3]

If she thinks, “I will not ‘invite’ both Orders in respect of three matters: what was seen or heard or *BD.3.355* suspected,” in throwing off the responsibility, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.57.2.2* There is no offence if there is an obstacle; if, having looked about, she does not get the chance; if she is ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.[^4]
