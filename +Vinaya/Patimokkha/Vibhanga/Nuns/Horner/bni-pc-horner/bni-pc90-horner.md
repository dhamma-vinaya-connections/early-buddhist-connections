# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 90

*Bi-Pc.90.1.1* *BD.3.409* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns caused (themselves) to be rubbed (with ointment)[^1] and also caused (themselves) to be massaged[^2] by a nun. People, engaged in touring the dwelling-place, having seen (them), … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns cause (themselves) to be rubbed (with ointment) and also cause (themselves) to be massaged by a nun, just like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns cause (themselves) to be rubbed … by a nun?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns caused (themselves) to be rubbed … by a nun?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can nuns cause (themselves) to be rubbed (with ointment) and also cause themselves to be massaged by a nun? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should cause (herself) to be rubbed (with ointment) or should cause (herself) to be massaged by a nun, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.90.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

By a nun means: by another nun.

Should cause (herself) to be rubbed (with ointment) *BD.3.410* means: if she makes (another) rub (her with ointment),[^3] there is an offence of expiation.

Should cause (herself) to be massaged means: if she makes (another) rub[^4] (her), there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.90.2.2* There is no offence if she is ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
