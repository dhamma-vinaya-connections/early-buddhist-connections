# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 12

*Bi-Pc.12.1.1* *BD.3.265* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a man, a relative of a nun who was a pupil of Bhaddā Kāpilānī,[^1] set out from a village for Sāvatthī on some business. Then that nun, thinking: “It is forbidden by the lord to stand together with (or) talk with a man, the one with the other, in the dark of the night when there is no light,”[^2] stood together with and talked with that very man, the one with the other, in a secluded place. Those who were modest nuns … *Bi-Pc.11.1*. _Instead of_ in the dark of the night when there is no light _read_ in a secluded place … “… this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should stand together with or should talk with a man, the one with the other, in a secluded place, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.12.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.,

A secluded place means: it is secluded by a wall built of wattle and daub or by a door or by a screen or by a screen wall or by a tree or by a pillar or by a sack or it is secluded by anything whatever.[^3]

Man means: a human man … *Bi-Pc.11.2* … if she is the first wrong-doer. *Vin.4.270*
