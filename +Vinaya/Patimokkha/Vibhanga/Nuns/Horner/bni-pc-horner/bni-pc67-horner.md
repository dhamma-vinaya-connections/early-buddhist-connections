# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 67

*Bi-Pc.67.1.1* *BD.3.373* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns ordained a girl married for full twelve years and who had trained for two years in the six rules, but who was not agreed upon by the Order. Nuns spoke thus: “Come, probationers, … *Bi-Pc.64.1* …” … “How can these nuns ordain a girl married for full twelve years and who has trained for two years in the six rules, but who is not agreed upon by the Order?” … he addressed the monks, saying:

“I allow you, monks, to give the agreement as to ordination to a girl married for full twelve years and who has trained for two years in the six rules. And thus, monks, should it be given: That girl married for full twelve years *Vin.4.324* and who has trained for two years in the six rules, having approached the Order … *Bi-Pc.63.1* … should speak thus: ‘Ladies, I, so and so, a girl married for full twelve years and who has trained under the lady so and so for two years in the six rules, request the Order for the agreement as to ordination.’ And a second time … *Bi-Pc.63.1*. _Instead of_ probationer _read_ girl married for full twelve years and who has trained for two years in the six rules; _instead of_ agreement as to training for two years in the six rules _read_ agreement as to ordination … ‘So do I understand this.’”

Then the lord, having rebuked these nuns in many a figure for their weakness in maintaining themselves … “… this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should ordain a girl married for full twelve years and who has trained for two years in the six rules (but) who is not agreed upon by the Order, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.67.2.1* *BD.3.374* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Full twelve years means: attained to twelve years.[^1]

Girl married means: one cohabiting with a man.[^2]

Two years means: two years.[^3]

Has trained means: has trained in the six rules.[^4]

Not agreed upon means: the agreement as to ordination is not given by a (formal) act at which the motion is followed by one proclamation.[^5]

Should ordain means: … *Bi-Pc.61.2.1* …

There is no offence if she ordains a girl married for full twelve years who has trained for two years in the six rules and who is agreed upon by the Order; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
