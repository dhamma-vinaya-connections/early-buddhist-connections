# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 91–93

*Bi-Pc.91.1.1* *BD.3.411* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns caused (themselves) to be rubbed (with ointment) and also caused (themselves) to be massaged by a probationer … by a female novice … by a woman householder. People, engaged in touring the dwelling-place, having seen (them), … spread it about, saying: “How can *Vin.4.343* these nuns cause (themselves) to be rubbed (with ointment) and also cause (themselves) to be massaged by a probationer … by a female novice … by a woman householder, just like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Nuns heard … see *Bi-Pc.90.1* … “… this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should cause (herself) to be rubbed (with ointment) or should cause (herself) to be massaged by a probationer … by a female novice … by a woman householder, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.91.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Probationer means: one who has trained for two years in the six rules.[^1]

Female novice means: one conforming to the ten rules of training.[^2]

Woman householder means: she is called a housewife.[^3]

Should cause (herself) to be rubbed (with ointment) means: if she makes (another) rub (her with ointment), there is an offence of expiation.

*BD.3.412* Should cause (herself) to be massaged means: if she makes (another) rub (her), there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.91.2.2* There is no offence if it is on account of illness; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
