# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 88

*Bi-Pc.88.1.1* *BD.3.407* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six nuns bathed with perfume and paint.[^1] People … see *Bi-Pc.87.1*; _read_ bathed with perfume and paint, etc. … “… this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should bathe with perfume and paint, there is an offence of expiation[^2].”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.88.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Perfume means: whatever is a perfume.

Paint means: whatever is a paint.

Should bathe means: if she bathes, in the business there is an offence of wrong-doing; at the end of the bathing there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.88.2.2* There is no offence if it is on account of illness; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
