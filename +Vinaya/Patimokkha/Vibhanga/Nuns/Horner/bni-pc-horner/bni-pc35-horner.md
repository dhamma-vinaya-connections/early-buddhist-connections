# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 35

*Bi-Pc.35.1.1* *BD.3.311* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time Bhaddā Kāpilānī had spent the rains in Saketa. As she had some business to do, she sent a messenger to the nun Thullanandā, saying: “If the lady Thullanandā would give me quarters, I would come to Sāvatthī.” The nun Thullanandā spoke thus: “Let her come, I will give it.” Then Bhaddā Kāpilānī went from Saketa to Sāvatthī. The nun Thullanandā gave quarters to Bhaddā Kāpilānī. Now at that time the nun Thullanandā was very learned, she was a repeater … see *Bi-Pc.33.1* … she was skilled in giving _dhamma_\-talk. The nun Thullanandā, thinking: “Those who are said to have few wants … see *Bi-Pc.33.1* … intent on hinting,” angry, displeased threw Bhaddā Kāpilānī out of her quarters. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:

“How can the lady Thullanandā, angry, displeased, having given quarters to the lady Bhaddā Kāpilānī, throw her out?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … threw her out?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … throw her out? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun, having given quarters to a nun, should, angry, displeased, throw her out or have her thrown out, there is an offence of expiation.”[^1]

* * *

*Bi-Pc.35.2.1* *BD.3.312* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

A nun[^2] means: another nun.

Quarters means: it is called fastened by a door.[^3]

Having given means: oneself having given.

Angry, displeased means: dissatisfied, the mind worsened, stubborn.[^4]

Should throw out means: if, having taken (her) in a room, she throws her out on to the verandah, there is an offence of expiation. If, having taken her on the verandah, she throws her outside, *Vin.4.293* there is an offence of expiation. If, with one effort, she makes her pass through many doors, there is an offence of expiation.[^5]

Should have her thrown out means: if she commands another, there is an offence of wrong-doing. When once commanded, if she makes her pass through many doors, there is an offence of expiation.[^6]

* * *

*Bi-Pc.35.2.2* If she thinks that she is ordained when she is ordained (and) having given her quarters, angry, displeased, throws her out or has her thrown out, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether she is ordained … If she thinks that she is not ordained when she is ordained … offence of expiation. If she throws out or has her requisites thrown out, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she throws out or has her thrown out from what is not fastened by a door … If she throws out or has her requisites thrown out … If she throws out or has one who is not ordained thrown out from what is or from what is not fastened by a door … If she throws out or has her requisites thrown out … If she thinks that she is ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she *BD.3.313* thinks that she is not ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.[^7]

* * *

*Bi-Pc.35.2.3* There is no offence if she throws out or has one who is shameless thrown out, if she throws out or has her requisites thrown out; if she throws out or has one who is mad thrown out, if she throws out or has her requisites thrown out; if she throws out or has one who makes strife … quarrels … contention … brawls … who makes disputes in the Order thrown out, if she throws out or has her requisites thrown out; if she throws out or has a pupil or one who shares a cell or one who is not proceeding fitly thrown out, if she throws out or has her requisites thrown out; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.[^8]
