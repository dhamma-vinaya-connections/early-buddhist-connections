# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 83

*Bi-Pc.83.1.1* *BD.3.399* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns ordained two (probationers) in the one year.[^1] As before,[^2] there were not sufficent dwellings. As before[^3] people … *Vin.4.337* spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns ordain two (probationers) in one year? As before, there are not sufficient dwellings.” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: … _cf._ *Bi-Pc.82.1* “… this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should ordain two (probationers) in one year, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.83.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

One year means: one year.[^4]

Should ordain two (probationers) means: should confer the _upasampadā_ ordination on two (probationers).

If she thinks: “I will ordain two (probationers),” and looks about for a group or … *Bi-Pc.61.2* … there is an offence of wrong-doing for the group and for the woman teacher.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.83.2.2* There is no offence is she ordains in alternate years[^5]; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.

The Eighth Division: that on a maiden.[^6]
