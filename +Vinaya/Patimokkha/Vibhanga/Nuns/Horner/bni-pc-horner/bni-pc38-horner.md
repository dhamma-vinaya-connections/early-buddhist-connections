# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 38

*Bi-Pc.38.1.1* *BD.3.319* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns walked without a weapon on almstour outside (their own) region[^1] (when this was) agreed upon as dangerous, frightening. Bad men … see *Bi-Pc.37.1*. _Instead of_ within (her own) region _read_ outside (her own) region …” … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should walk without a weapon outside (her own) region (when this is) agreed upon as dangerous, frightening, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.38.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Outside (her own) region means: setting aside that country in which she lives, in another’s region.

Dangerous means: … see *Bi-Pc.37.2* … if she is the first wrong-doer.
