# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 25

*Bi-Pc.25.1.1* *BD.3.292* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a certain nun having walked for alms, having spread out a damp robe,[^1] entered a dwelling-place. A certain nun, having put on that robe, entered a village for almsfood. She, having come out,[^2] asked the nuns: “Ladies, have you not seen my robe?” The nuns told this matter to that nun. Then that nun … spread it about, saying:

“How can this nun, without asking (for permission) put on my robe?” Then this nun told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this nun put on a nun’s robe without asking (for permission)?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun … without asking (for permission)?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can a nun … without asking (for permission)? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should wear a robe that should be handed back,[^3] there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.25.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

A robe that should be handed back means: if she dresses in or puts on any one robe of the five (kinds of) robes of *BD.3.293* one who is ordained, either if it was not given to her or without asking (permission) for it, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.25.2.2* If she thinks that she is ordained when she is ordained (and) wears a robe that should be handed back, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether she is ordained … If she thinks that she is not ordained when she is ordained … offence of expiation. *Vin.4.283* If she wears a robe of one who is not ordained and that should be handed back, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is not ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.[^4]

* * *

*Bi-Pc.25.2.3* There is no offence if she gives it or, if asking (permission) for it, she dresses in it or puts it on; if she is one whose robe is stolen,[^5] if she is one whose robe is destroyed[^6]; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
