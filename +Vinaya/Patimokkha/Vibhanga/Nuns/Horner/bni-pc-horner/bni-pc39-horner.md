# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 39

*Bi-Pc.39.1.1* *BD.3.320* … at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding place. Now at that time nuns walked on alms-tour during the rains. People … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns walk on almstour during the rains, trampling down the crops and grasses, injuring life that is one-facultied, bringing many small creatures to destruction?”[^1] Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:

“How can these nuns … during the rains … bringing many small creatures to destruction?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns … during the rains … bringing many small creatures to destruction?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can nuns walk on almstour during the rains … bringing many small creatures to destruction? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should walk on almstour during the rains, there is an offence of expiation.” *Vin.4.297*

* * *

*Bi-Pc.39.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

*BD.3.321* During the rains means: not having spent the first three months or the last three months.[^2]

Should walk on almstour means: in a village close enough for a cock (to walk) … see *Bi-Pc.37.2.1* … in what is not a village, in the jungle, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.39.2.2* There is no offence if she goes away for seven days because there is something to be done; if she goes away because she is troubled about something; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
