# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 53

*Bi-Pc.53.1.1* *BD.3.346* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time[^1] the nun Caṇḍakālī was one who made strife, who made quarrels, who made contention, who made brawls, who made disputes in the Order … see *Bi-Ss.4* *Vin.4.310* … The nun Thullanandā, saying: “These are ignorant, these are inexperienced, they do not even know a (formal) act or the defect of a (formal) act or the failure of a (formal) act or the success of a (formal) act,” and being quick tempered,[^2] she abused[^3] a group. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:

“How can the lady Thullanandā, being quick tempered, abuse a group?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā, being quick tempered, abused a group?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … abuse a group? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun, being quick tempered, should abuse a group, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.53.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Being quick tempered means: she is called angry.[^4]

Group means: it is called an Order of nuns.[^5]

*BD.3.347* Should abuse[^6] means: if she abuses, saying: “These are ignorant, these are inexperienced, they do not even know a (formal) act … or the success of a (formal) act,” there is an offence of expiation. If she abuses several nuns or one nun or one who is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

There is no offence if she is aiming at (explaining) the goal … see *Bi-Pc.52.2.3* … if she is the first wrong-doer.
