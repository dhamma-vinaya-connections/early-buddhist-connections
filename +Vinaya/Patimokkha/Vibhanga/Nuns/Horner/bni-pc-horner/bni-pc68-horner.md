# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 68

*Bi-Pc.68.1.1* *BD.3.375* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Thullanandā, having ordained the woman who lived with her,[^1] for two years neither helped her nor had her helped. These[^2] were ignorant, inexperienced, they did not know what was allowable or what was not allowable. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā, having ordained the woman who lives with her, for two years neither *Vin.4.325* help her nor have her helped?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … nor had her helped?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … nor have her helped? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun, having ordained the woman who lives with her, for two years should neither help her nor have her helped, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.68.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Woman who lives with her means: she is called the one who shares her cell.[^3]

Having ordained means: having conferred the _upasampada_ ordination.

Two years means: two years.[^4]

*BD.3.376* Should neither help her means: should not herself help her in regard to the exposition, the interrogation,[^5] the exhortation, the instruction.[^6]

Nor should have her helped means: should not command another.

If for two years she thinks: “I will neither help her nor have her helped,” in throwing off the responsibility, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.68.2.2* There is no offence if there is an obstacle; if having looked about she does not get the chance; if she is ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.[^7]
