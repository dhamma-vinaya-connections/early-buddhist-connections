# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 13

*Bi-Pc.13.1.1* *BD.3.266* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a man, a relative of a nun who was a pupil of Bhaddā Kāpilānī,[^1] set out from a village for Sāvatthī on some business. Then that nun, thinking: “It is forbidden by the lord to stand together with (or) talk with a man, the one with the other, in a secluded place,”[^2] stood together with and talked with that very man in an open place. Those who were modest nuns … *Bi-Pc.11.1*. _Instead of_ in the dark of the night when there is no light _read_ in an open place … “… this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should stand together with or should talk with a man, the one with the other, in an open place, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.13.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Open place means: what is not secluded by a wall built of wattle and daub … or by a sack or what is not secluded by anything whatever.

Man means: a human man … *Bi-Pc.11.2* … if she is the first wrong-doer.
