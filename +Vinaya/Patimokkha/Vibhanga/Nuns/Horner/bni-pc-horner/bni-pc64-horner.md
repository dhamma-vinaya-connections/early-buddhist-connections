# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 64

*Bi-Pc.64.1.1* *BD.3.367* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns ordained a probationer who had trained for two years in the six rules (but) who was not agreed upon by the Order.[^1] Nuns spoke thus: “Come, probationers,[^2] find out about this, give this, convey this, make this allowable.” These spoke thus: “Ladies, we are not probationers, we are nuns.” Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns ordain a probationer who has trained for two years in the six rules (but) who is not agreed upon by the Order?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns ordained … not agreed upon by the Order?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can nuns ordain … not agreed upon by the Order? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … and having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:

“I allow you, monks, to give the agreement as to ordination[^3] to a probationer who has trained for two years in the six rules. And thus, monks, should it be given: That probationer who has trained for two years in the six rules, having approached the Order … *Bi-Pc.63.1* … should speak thus: *Vin.4.321* ‘Ladies, I, so and so, a probationer who has trained for two years in the six rules under the lady so and so, request the Order *BD.3.368* for the agreement as to ordination.’ And a second time … *Bi-Pc.63.1* _instead of_ probationer _read_ probationer who has trained for two years in the six rules _instead of_ agreement as to training for two years in the six rules _read_ agreement as to ordination. … So do I understand this.’”

Then the lord, having rebuked the nuns in many a figure for their weakness in maintaining themselves … “… this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should ordain a probationer who has trained for two years in the six rules (but) who is not agreed upon by the Order,[^4] there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.64.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Two years means: two years.[^5]

Has trained means: has trained in the six rules.[^6]

Not agreed upon means: the agreement as to ordination is not given by a (formal) act at which the motion is followed by one proclamation.[^7]

Should ordain means: … *Bi-Pc.61.2.1* …

There is no offence if she ordains a probationer who has trained for two years in the six rules and who is agreed upon by the Order; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
