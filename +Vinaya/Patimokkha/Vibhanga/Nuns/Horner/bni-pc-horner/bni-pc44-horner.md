# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 44

*Bi-Pc.44.1.1* *BD.3.329* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns did household work. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns do household work?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns do household work?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can nuns do household work? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should do household work, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.44.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Household work means: if she cooks conjey or rice or *Vin.4.301* solid food for a layman,[^1] if she washes a cloak or a turban, there is an offence of expiation

* * *

*Bi-Pc.44.2.2* There is no offence if it is a drink of conjey,[^2] if it is for the Order; if it is for worship at a shrine; if in doing household work for herself she cooks conjey or rice or solid food, washes a cloak or a turban; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
