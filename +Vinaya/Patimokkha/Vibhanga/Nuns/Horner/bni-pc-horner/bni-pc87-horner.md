# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 87

*Bi-Pc.87.1.1* *BD.3.406* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six nuns wore women’s ornaments. People … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns wear women’s ornaments, like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six nuns wear women’s ornaments?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that … women’s ornaments?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can … women’s ornaments? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should wear women’s ornaments, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.87.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Women’s ornaments mean: they go on the head, round the neck, on the hands,[^1] on the feet, round the hips.[^2]

Should wear means: if she wears them even once, there is an offence of expiation.*Vin.3.341*

* * *

*Bi-Pc.87.2.2* There is no offence if it is on account of illness[^3]; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
