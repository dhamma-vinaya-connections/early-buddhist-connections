# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 6

*Bi-Pc.6.1.1* *BD.3.252* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time Ārohanta, a chief minister,[^1] had gone forth among the monks (and) his former wife had gone forth among the nuns. Now at that time that monk participated in a meal in the presence of that nun. Then that nun enticed[^2] that monk, standing near him with drinking water and with a fan as he was eating.[^3] Then that monk upbraided that nun, saying: “Do not, sister, do this, it is not allowable.”

“Formerly you did this and that to me, now you do not put up with this much,” and having thrown down the drinking cup on his head, she struck him with the fan. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:

“How can this nun strike a monk?’ …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun struck a monk?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can a nun strike a monk? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should stand with drinking water or *BD.3.253* with a fan close to a monk while he is eating, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.6.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

To a monk means: to one who is ordained.

Is eating means: is eating any one meal of the five (kinds of) meals.[^4]

Drinking water means: whatever is drinkable.[^5]

Fans means: whatever is a fan.[^6]

Should stand close means: if she stands within a reach of the hand, there is an offence of expiation. *Vin.4.264*

* * *

*Bi-Pc.6.2.2* If she thinks that he is ordained when he is ordained (and) stands close with drinking water or with a fan, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether he is ordained … If she thinks that he is not ordained when he is ordained … there is an offence of expiation. If she stands close having left a reach of the hand, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she stands close while he is eating solid food, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she stands close to one who is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that he is ordained when he is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether he is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that he is not ordained when he is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.[^7]

* * *

*Bi-Pc.6.2.3* *BD.3.254* There is no offence if she gives[^8]; if she causes (another) to give; if she commands one who is not ordained[^9]; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
