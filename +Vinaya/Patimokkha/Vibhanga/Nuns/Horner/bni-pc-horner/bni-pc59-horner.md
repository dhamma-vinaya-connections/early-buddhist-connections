# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 59

*Bi-Pc.59.1.1* *BD.3.358* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns neither asked (the date of) the Observance day[^1] nor did they ask for exhortation. Monks … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns neither ask (the date of) the Observance day nor ask for exhortation?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns neither … nor ask for exhortation?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can nuns neither … nor ask for exhortation? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Every half month a nun should desire two things from the Order of monks: the asking as to (the date of) the Observance day and the approaching for exhortation.[^2] For her who transgresses this, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.59.2.1* Every half month means: every Observance day.[^3]

Observance day means: the two Observance days, that on the fourteenth day and that on the fifteenth day.[^4]

Exhortation means: the eight important rules.

If she thinks, “I will neither ask (the date of) the Observance day nor ask for exhortation,” in throwing off the responsibility, … see *Bi-Pc.58.2.1*–*Bi-Pc.58.2.2* … if she is the first wrong-doer. *Vin.4.316*
