# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 95

*Bi-Pc.95.1.1* *BD.3.415* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns asked a question of a monk who had not given leave.[^1] Monks … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns ask a question of a monk who has not given leave?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks … see *Bi-Pc.94.1* … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should ask a question of a monk who has not given leave, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.95.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Not given leave means: without asking (for permission).[^2]

Should ask a question means: if, having asked for leave[^3] in regard to Suttanta, she asks about Discipline or about Abhidhamma,[^4] there is an offence of expiation. If, having asked for leave in regard to Discipline, she asks about Suttanta or about Abhidhamma, there is an offence of expiation. If, having asked for leave in regard to Abhidhamma, she asks about Suttanta or about Discipline, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.95.2.2* If she thinks that she has not asked (for permission) when she has not asked (for permission and) asks a *BD.3.416* question … *Bi-Pc.94.2.2* … there is no offence.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.95.2.3* There is no offence if she asks, having asked for leave; if having asked for leave in general, she asks concerning whatever she likes[^5]; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
