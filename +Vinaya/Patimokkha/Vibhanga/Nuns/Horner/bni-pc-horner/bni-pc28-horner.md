# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 28

*Bi-Pc.28.1.1* *BD.3.298* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Thullanandā gave[^1] recluses’ robe-material to players[^2] and to dancers[^3] and to female tumblers[^4] and to female conjurors[^5] and to drummers,[^6] saying: “Do praise me in public.”[^7] The players and the dancers and the tumblers and the conjurors and the drummers praised the nun Thullanandā in public, saying: “The lady Thullanandā is very learned, she is a repeater, she is wise, she is skilled in giving talk on _dhamma_.[^8] Give for the lady, make for the lady.” Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:

*BD.3.299* “How can the lady Thullanandā give recluses’ robe-material to a householder?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā gave recluses’ robe-material to a householder?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā give recluses’ robe-material to a householder? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should give recluses’ robe-material to a householder or to a wanderer or to a female wanderer, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.28.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Householder means: he who inhabits a house.[^9]

Wanderer means: excluding monk and novice, he who has reached (the stage of a) wanderer.[^10]

Female wanderer means: excluding nun and probationer and female novice, she who has reached (the stage of a) female wanderer.[^11] *Vin.4.286*

Recluses’ robe-material means: it is called made allowable.[^12] If she gives, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.28.2.2* There is no offence if she gives to (her) parents; if she gives for the time being[^13]; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
