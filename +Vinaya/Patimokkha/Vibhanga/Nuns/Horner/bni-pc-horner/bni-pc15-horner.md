# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 15

*Bi-Pc.15.1.1* *BD.3.270* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a certain nun frequented a certain family as a regular diner. Then that nun, having dressed in the morning, taking her bowl and robe, approached that family; having approached, having sat down on a seat, she departed without asking the owner (for permission). The family’s slave-woman, while sweeping the house, *Vin.4.272* placed that seat inside a dish.[^1] The people, not seeing that seat, spoke thus to that nun: “Lady, where is that seat?”

“I, sirs, did not see that seat.”

Saying, “Lady, give back that seat,” having scolded her, they stopped (her as) a regular diner. Then these people, searching[^2] the house, having seen that seat inside the dish, having apologised to that nun, (re-) established her as a regular diner. Then that nun told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:

“How can this nun, having approached families before a meal, having sat down on a seat, depart without asking the owner (for permission)?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun … the owner (for permission)?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can a nun … depart without asking the owner (for permission)? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

*BD.3.271* “Whatever nun, having approached families before a meal, having sat down on a seat, should depart without asking the owner (for permission), there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.15.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Before a meal means: from sunrise until midday.[^3]

Family means: there are four (kinds of) families: a noble family, a brahmin family, a merchant family, a low-caste family.[^4]

Having approached means: having gone there.

A seat means: it is called a place for sitting cross-legged.[^5]

Having sat down means: having sat down on this.

Should depart without asking the owner (for permission) means: whatever man in that family is learned, without asking him (for permission but) in letting herself pass a place that is sheltered from the rain,[^6] there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.15.2.2* If she thinks that she has not asked (for permission) when she has not asked (for permission) and departs, *BD.3.272* there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether she has not asked (for permission) … If she thinks that she has asked (for permission) when she has not asked (for permission) … there is an offence of expiation. If it is not for a place for sitting cross-legged, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she has not asked (for permission) when she has asked (for permission), there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether she has asked (for permission), there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she has asked (for permission) when she has asked (for permission), there is no offence.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.15.2.3* There is no offence if she goes away asking (for permission); if it is one that is not movable[^7]; if she is ill; if there are accidents[^8]; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer. *Vin.4.273*
