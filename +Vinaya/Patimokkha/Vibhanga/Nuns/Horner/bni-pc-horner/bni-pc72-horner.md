# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 72

*Bi-Pc.72.1.1* *BD.3.382* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns ordained a maiden who had completed twenty years of age (but) who had not trained for two years in the six rules. *Vin.4.328* These were ignorant, inexperienced … *Bi-Pc.66.1*. _Instead of_ a girl married for full twelve years _read_ a maiden who has completed twenty years of age. … he addressed the monks, saying:

“I allow you, monks, to give a maiden of eighteen years of age the agreement as to training for two years in the six rules. And thus, monks, should it be given: That maiden of eighteen years of age having approached the Order …” *Bi-Pc.66.1*. _Instead of_ a girl married for full twelve years _read_ a maiden of eighteen years of age. … “… this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should ordain a maiden who has completed twenty years of age (but) who has not trained for two years in the six rules, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.72.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Has completed twenty years of age means: has attained to twenty years of age.

Maiden means: she is called a female novice.

Two years means: … *Bi-Pc.63.2* …

There is no offence if she ordains a maiden who has completed twenty years of age and who has trained for two years in the six rules; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
