# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 78

*Bi-Pc.78.1.1* *BD.3.391* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a certain probationer, having approached the nun Thullanandā, asked for the _upasampadā_, ordination. The nun Thullanandā spoke thus to that probationer: “If you, lady, will wait upon me for two years, then will I ordain you,” and having said (this) … see *Bi-Pc.77.1* … “… this rule of training:

“Whatever nun, having said to a probationer: ‘If you, lady, will wait upon me for two years, then will I ordain you,’ (yet) if she is not afterwards prevented, should neither ordain her nor should make an effort to get her ordained, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.78.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Probationer means: one who has trained for two years in the six rules.

‘If you, lady, will wait upon me for two years’ means: if you will attend upon me for two years.[^1]

‘Then will I ordain you,’ means: then will I confer the _upasampada_, ordination on you.

If she is not afterwards prevented means: … see *Bi-Pc.77.2* … if she is the first wrong-doer.
