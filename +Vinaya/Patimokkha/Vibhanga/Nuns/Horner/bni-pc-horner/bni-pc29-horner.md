# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 29

*Bi-Pc.29.1.1* *BD.3.300* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the family who supported the nun Thullanandā spoke thus to the nun Thullanandā: “If we, lady, are able, we will give robe-material for the Order of nuns.” Now at that time nuns, having kept the rains-retreat, collected together wishing to distribute robe-material. The nun Thullanandā spoke thus to these nuns: “Wait, ladies, there is for the Order of nuns an expectation of robe-material.” The nuns spoke thus to the nun Thullanandā: “Do go, lady, and find out about this robe-material.” The nun Thullanandā approached that family; having approached she spoke thus to the people: “Sirs, do give robe-material for the Order of nuns.” They said: “Lady, we are not able to give robe-material for the Order of nuns.” The nun Thullanandā told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:

“How can the lady Thullanandā, when an expectation of robe-material is not sure,[^1] let the robe-season[^2] pass?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … let the robe-season pass?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … let the robe-season pass? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun, when an expectation of robe-material is not sure, should let the robe-season pass, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.29.2.1* *BD.3.301* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

When an expectation of robe-material is not sure means: if they say, “If we are able, we will give, we will make,” (but their) word becomes broken.

Robe-season means: the last month of the rainy season when the _kaṭhina_ cloth is not (formally) made, *Vin.4.287* the five months when it is (formally) made.[^3]

Should let the robe-season pass means: if she lets pass the last day of the rainy season when the _kaṭhina_ cloth is not (formally) made, there is an offence of expiation. If she lets the day pass for removing the _kaṭhina_ (privileges),[^4] there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.29.2.2* If she thinks that the robe-material is not sure when it is not sure (and) lets the robe-season pass, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether the robe-material is not sure … offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that the robe-material is sure[^5] when it is not sure … no offence. If she thinks that the robe-material is not sure when it is sure, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether the robe-material is sure, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that the robe-material is sure when it is sure, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.29.2.3* There is no offence if she hinders having pointed out an advantage[^6]; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
