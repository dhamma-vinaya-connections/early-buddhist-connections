# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 73

*Bi-Pc.73.1.1* *BD.3.383* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns ordained a maiden who had completed twenty years of age and who had trained for two years in the six rules (but) who was not agreed upon by the Order. Nuns spoke thus: “Come, probationers, find out about this, give this, convey this, this is needed, make this allowable.” These spoke thus: “Ladies, we are not probationers, we are nuns.” Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns …” *Bi-Pc.67.1*. _Instead of_ a girl married for full twelve years _read_ a maiden who has completed twenty years of age. … “… this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should ordain a maiden who has completed twenty years of age and who has trained for two years in the six rules (but) who is not agreed upon by the Order, there is an offence of expiation.” *Vin.4.329*

* * *

*Bi-Pc.73.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Completed twenty years of age means: attained to twenty years of age.

Maiden means: she is called a female novice.[^1]

Two years means: two years.[^2]

Has trained means: has trained in the six rules.[^3]

Not agreed upon means: the agreement as to ordination is not given by a (formal) act at which the motion is followed by one proclamation.[^4]

Should ordain means: … *Bi-Pc.63.2* …

There is no offence if she ordains a maiden who has completed twenty years of age, who has trained for two years in the six rules and who is agreed upon by the Order; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
