# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 42

*Bi-Pc.42.1.1* *BD.3.326* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns made use of a sofa[^1] and of a divan.[^2] People, engaged in touring the dwelling place, having seen (them) … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns make use of a sofa and of a divan, like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns make use of a sofa and of a divan?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns made use of a … divan?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can nuns make use of a sofa and of *BD.3.327* a divan? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should make use of a sofa or of a divan, there is an offence of expiation.”[^3]

* * *

*Bi-Pc.42.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Sofa means: it is called of exceeding measure.

Divan means: it is made having brought hair (stuffing).[^4]

Should make use of means: if she sits down on it or lies down on it, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.42.2.2* There is no offence if, having cut down the legs of the sofa, she makes use of it; if, having cut out the hair (stuffing) from the divan, she makes use of it[^5]; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
