# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 55

*Bi-Pc.55.1.1* *BD.3.350* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a certain nun, walking for alms along a certain road in Sāvatthī, approached a certain family; having approached, she sat down on an appointed seat. Then these people, having offered food to this nun, spoke thus: “Lady, other nuns may also come.” Then this nun, thinking: “How may these nuns not come?” having approached the nuns, spoke thus: “Ladies, in such and such a place there are fierce dogs, a wild bull, the place is a swamp, do not go there.” But a certain nun, walking for alms along that road, approached that family; having approached, she sat down on an appointed seat. Then these people, having offered food to that nun, spoke thus: “Why do not the other nuns come, lady?” Then this nun told this matter to those people. The people … spread it about, saying: “How can that nun be grudging as to families?”[^1] …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun was grudging as to families?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can a nun be grudging as to families? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should be one who is grudging as to families, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.55.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

*BD.3.351* Family means: … low caste family.[^2]

Should be one who is grudging as to families means: if they say, “Why do the nuns not come?” (and) she speaks dispraise of a family in front of nuns, there is an offence of expiation. Or if she speaks dispraise of nuns in front of a family, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.55.2.2* There is no offence if, not being grudging as to families, she merely explains that there is a danger[^3]; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer. *Vin.4.313*
