# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 20

*Bi-Pc.20.1.1* *BD.3.281* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Caṇḍakalī, having quarrelled with the nuns, wept having struck[^1] herself again and again. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Caṇḍakalī weep, having struck herself again and again?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Caṇḍakalī wept, having struck herself again and again?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can the nun Caṇḍakalī weep, having struck herself again and again? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should weep, having struck herself again and again, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.20.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Herself means: herself (individually).[^2]

If she weeps, having struck herself again and again, there is an offence of expiation. If she strikes, (but) does not weep, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she weeps, (but) does not strike, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.20.2.2* There is no offence if, smitten by loss of relations or by *BD.3.282* loss of possessions[^3] or by loss of health,[^4] she weeps (but) does not strike; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.

The Second Division: that on the dark *Vin.4.278*
