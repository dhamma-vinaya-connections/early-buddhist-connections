# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 31

*Bi-Pc.31.1.1* *BD.3.304* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time two nuns shared[^1] one couch.[^2] People, engaged in touring the dwelling-place, having seen (them) … spread it about, saying: “How can two nuns share one couch, like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can two nuns share one couch?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that two nuns shared one couch?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can two nuns share one couch? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training: *Vin.4.289*

“Whatever two nuns should share one couch, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.31.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Nuns mean: they are called ordained.

Two should share one couch means: if one is lying down and the other lies down, there is an offence of expiation. Or if both are lying down, there is an offence of expiation. If having got up, they lie down again, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.31.2.2* There is no offence if one is lying down and the other sits down, or if both are sitting down; if they are mad, if they are the first wrong-doers.
