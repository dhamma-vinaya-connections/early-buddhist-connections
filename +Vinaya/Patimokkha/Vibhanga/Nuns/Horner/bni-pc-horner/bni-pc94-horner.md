# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 94

*Bi-Pc.94.1.1* *BD.3.413* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns sat down on a seat in front of a monk[^1] without asking (for permission). Monks … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns … without asking (for permission)?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns … without asking (for permission)?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can nuns … without asking (for permission)? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should sit down on a seat in front of a monk without asking (for permission), there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.94.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

In front of a monk means: in front of one who is ordained.

Without asking (for permission) means: not having obtained permission.

Should sit down on a seat means: if she sits down even on the ground, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.94.2.2* If she thinks that she has not asked (for permission) when she has not asked (for permission and) sits down on a seat, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether she has not asked (for permission) … If she thinks that she has asked (for permission) when she has not asked (for permission) *Vin.4.344* … there is an offence of expiation. If she thinks that she *BD.3.414* has not asked (for permission) when she has asked (for permission), there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether she has asked (for permission), there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she has asked (for permission) when she has asked (for permission), there is no offence.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.94.2.3* There is no offence if, having asked (for permission), she sits down on a seat; if she is ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
