# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 49

*Bi-Pc.49.1.1* *BD.3.337* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six nuns learnt worldly knowledge.[^1] People … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns learn worldly knowledge, like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six nuns learn worldly knowledge?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six nuns learn worldly knowledge?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them saying:

“How, monks, can this group of six nuns learn worldly knowledge? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should learn worldly knowledge, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.49.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Worldly knowledge means: whatever is secular,[^2] not connected with the goal.

Should learn means: if she learns by line,[^3] for every line there is an offence of expiation. If she learns by *BD.3.338* syllable, for every syllable there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.49.2.2* There is no offence if she learns writing[^4]; if she learns what is memorised[^5]; if she learns a spell[^6] for protection; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
