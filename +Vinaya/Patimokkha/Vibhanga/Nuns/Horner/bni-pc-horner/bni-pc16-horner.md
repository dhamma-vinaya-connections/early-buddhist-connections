# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 16

*Bi-Pc.16.1.1* *BD.3.273* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Thullanandā, having approached families after a meal, sat down on[^1] a seat without having asked the owner (for permission) and moreover lay down on it. People, being shy of the nun Thullanandā, neither sat down on that seat nor lay down on it. The people … spread it about, saying: “How can the nun Thullanandā, having approached families after a meal, sit down on a seat without asking the owner (for permission) and moreover lie down on it?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā … and moreover lie down on it?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … and moreover lay down on it?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … and moreover lie down on it? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun, having approached families after a meal, should sit down on or should lie down on a seat without asking the owner (for permission), there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.16.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

After a meal means: after midday has passed until the sun has set.

*BD.3.274* Family means: …[^2]

Having approached means: having gone there.[^3]

Without asking the owner (for permission) means: whatever man in that family is the owner, without asking him to give (permission).

A seat means: ….[^4]

Should sit down on means: if she sits down on it, there is an offence of expiation.

Should lie down on means: if she lies down on it, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.16.2.2* If she thinks that she has not asked (for permission) when she has not asked (for permission) and sits down on or lies down on (a seat), there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether she has not asked (for permission) … see *Bi-Pc.15.2* … there is no offence. *Vin.4.274*

* * *

*Bi-Pc.16.2.3* There is no offence if she, asking (for permission), sits down on or lies down on a seat; if it is a permanently appointed (seat); if she is ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
