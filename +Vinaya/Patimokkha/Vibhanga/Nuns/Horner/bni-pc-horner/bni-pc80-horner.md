# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 80

*Bi-Pc.80.1.1* *BD.3.394* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Thullanandā ordained a probationer without the consent of the parents and husband. The parents and the husband … spread it about, saying : “How can the lady Thullanandā ordain the probationer without our consent?” Nuns heard the parents and the husband who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying : “How can the lady Thullanandā ordain a probationer without the consent of the parents and husband?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā ordained … and husband?” “It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā ordain a probationer … and husband? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training: *Vin.4.335*

“Whatever nun should ordain a probationer without the consent of the parents and husband, there is an offence of expiation.”[^1]

* * *

*Bi-Pc.80.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Parents means: they are called the progenitors.

Husband means: he to whom she is married.[^2]

Without the consent means: not asking (for permission).

*BD.3.395* Probationer means: one who has trained for two years in the six rules.

Should ordain means: … see *Bi-Pc.61.2* … and an offence of wrong-doing for the group and for the woman teacher.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.80.2.2* There is no offence if she ordains her not knowing; if she ordains her, (she) having obtained permission; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
