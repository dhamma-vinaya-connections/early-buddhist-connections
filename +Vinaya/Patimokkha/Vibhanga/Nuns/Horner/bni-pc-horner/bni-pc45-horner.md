# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 45

*Bi-Pc.45.1.1* *BD.3.330* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a certain nun, having approached the nun Thullanandā, spoke thus: “Do come, lady, and settle this legal question.” The nun Thullanandā, having answered, “Very good,” neither settled it nor made an effort to get it settled.[^1] Then that nun told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā, being spoken to by a nun, saying: ‘Do come, lady, and settle this legal question,’ and having answered, ‘Very good,’ neither settle it nor make an effort to get it settled?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … to get it settled?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … nor make an effort to get it settled? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun, being spoken to by a nun, saying: ‘Do come, lady, and settle this legal question,’ and having answered: ‘Very good,’ (yet) if she is not afterwards prevented, should neither settle it nor should make an effort to get it settled, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.45.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

By a nun means: by another nun.

Legal question means: there are four (kinds of) legal questions: legal questions arising out of disputes, legal *BD.3.331* questions arising out of censure, legal questions arising out of transgressions, legal questions arising out of obligations.[^2]

Do come, lady, and settle this legal question means: Do come, lady, and decide this legal question. *Vin.4.302*

If she is not afterwards prevented means: if there is not an obstacle.[^3]

Should neither settle it means: should not herself settle it.[^4]

Nor should make an effort to get it settled means: should not command another.[^5]

If she thinks, “I will neither settle it nor make an effort to get it settled,” in throwing off the responsibility, there is an offence of expiation.[^6]

* * *

*Bi-Pc.45.2.2* If she thinks that she is ordained when she is ordained (and) neither settles a legal question nor makes an effort to get it settled, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether she is ordained … If she thinks that she is not ordained when she is ordained … offence of expiation. If she neither settles a legal question nor makes an effort to get it settled for one who is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether she is not ordained … If she thinks that she is not ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.[^7]

* * *

*Bi-Pc.45.2.3* There is no offence if there is an obstacle; if having looked about, she does not get the chance[^8]; if she is ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
