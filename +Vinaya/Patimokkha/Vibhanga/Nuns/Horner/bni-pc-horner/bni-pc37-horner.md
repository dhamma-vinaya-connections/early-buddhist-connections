# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 37

*Bi-Pc.37.1.1* *BD.3.317* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns walked without a weapon[^1] on almstour within (their own) region[^2] (when this was) agreed upon as dangerous, frightening.[^3] Bad men assaulted them. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns … dangerous, frightening?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns … dangerous, frightening?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can nuns … dangerous, frightening? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should walk without a weapon on alms-tour within (her own) region (when this is) agreed upon as dangerous, frightening, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.37.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Within (her own) region means: in a region of that country[^4] in which she lives.

*BD.3.318* Dangerous means: if on this road a place where thieves are halting is seen, a place where they are eating is seen, a place where they are resting is seen, a place where they are sitting down is seen, a place where they are lying down is seen.[^5]

Frightening means: if on this road people injured by thieves are seen, (people) plundered are seen, (people) beaten down are seen.[^6]

Without a weapon[^7] means: without a weapon.[^8]

Should walk on almstour means: in a village close enough for a cock (to walk), among every (such) village, there is an offence of expiation. For every half _yojana_ in what is not a village, in a jungle, there is an offence of expiation.[^9]

* * *

*Bi-Pc.37.2.2* There is no offence if she goes with a weapon; if she goes in a place of security[^10] that is not frightening; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer. *Vin.4.296*
