# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 69

*Bi-Pc.69.1.1* *BD.3.377* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns for two years did not wait upon an ordained woman instructor.[^1] These[^2] were ignorant, inexperienced, they did not know what was allowable or what was not allowable. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns for two years not wait upon an ordained woman instructor?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns … woman instructor

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can nuns … ordained woman instructor? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training: *Vin.4.326*

“Whatever nun for two years should not wait upon an ordained woman instructor, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.69.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Ordained means: the _upasampadā_, ordination conferred.

Woman instructor means: she is called a woman preceptor.[^3]

*BD.3.378* Two years means: two years.

Should not wait upon means: should not herself attend upon.[^4]

If she thinks: “I will not wait upon her for two years,” in throwing off the responsibility, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.69.2.2* There is no offence if the woman preceptor is ignorant or shameless; if he is ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
