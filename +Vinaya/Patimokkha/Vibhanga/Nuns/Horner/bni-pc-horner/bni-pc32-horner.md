# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 32

*Bi-Pc.32.1.1* *BD.3.305* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time two nuns shared one covering-cloth.[^1] People, engaged in touring the dwelling-place … see *Bi-Pc.31.1*. _Instead of_ one couch _read_ one covering-cloth … “… this rule of training:

“Whatever two nuns should share one covering-cloth, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.32.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Nuns mean: they are called ordained.

Two should share one covering-cloth means: if having covered themselves with that,[^2] they put that[^3] on, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.32.2.2* If they think that it is one covering-cloth when it is one covering-cloth (and) share it, there is an offence of expiation. If they are in doubt as to whether it is one covering-cloth … If they think they are different covering-cloths when it is one covering-cloth … offence of expiation. If they think that they are different cloths when it is one covering, *BD.3.306* there is an offence of wrong-doing. If they think that it is one covering-cloth when they are different coverings, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If they think that it is one covering-cloth when they are different covering-cloths, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If they are in doubt as to whether they are different covering-cloths, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If they think that they are different covering-cloths when they are different covering-cloths, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.32.2.3* There is no offence if they lie down having pointed out an arrangement[^4]; if they are mad, if they are the first wrong-doers. *Vin.4.290*
