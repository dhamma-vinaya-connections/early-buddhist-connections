# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 82

*Bi-Pc.82.1.1* *BD.3.398* … At Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns ordained every year; there were not sufficient dwellings. People … spread it about saying: “How can these nuns ordain every year? There are not sufficient dwellings.” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns ordain every year?” …

“Is it true, as it is said, monks, that nuns ordain every year?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can nuns ordain every year? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of raining:

“Whatever nun should ordain every year, there is an offence of expiation.”[^1]

* * *

*Bi-Pc.82.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Every year means: annually.[^2]

Should ordain means: … and an offence of wrong-doing for the group and for the woman teacher.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.82.2.2* There is no offence if she ordains in the alternate (years); if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
