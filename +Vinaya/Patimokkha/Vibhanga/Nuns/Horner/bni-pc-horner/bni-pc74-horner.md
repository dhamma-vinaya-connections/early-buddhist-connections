# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 74

*Bi-Pc.74.1.1* *BD.3.384* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns ordained while they were less than twelve years (of standing).[^1] They were ignorant, inexperienced, they did not know what was allowable or what was not allowable; moreover, the women who’ shared their cells were ignorant, inexperienced, they did not know what was allowable or what was not allowable. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns ordain while they are less than twelve years (of standing)?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns … less than twelve years (of standing)?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can nuns … less than twelve years (of standing)? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should ordain while she is less than twelve years (of standing) there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.74.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Less than twelve years means: not attained to twelve years.

Should ordain means: … *Bi-Pc.61.2.1* … offence of wrong-doing for the group and for the woman teacher.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.74.2.2* There is no offence if she ordains when she has completed twelve years (of standing); if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer. *Vin.4.330*
