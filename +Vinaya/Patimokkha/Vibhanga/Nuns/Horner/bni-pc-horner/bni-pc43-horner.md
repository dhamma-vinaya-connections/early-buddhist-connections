# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 43

*Bi-Pc.43.1.1* *BD.3.328* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six nuns spun yarn. *Vin.4.300* People, engaged in touring the dwelling place, having seen (them) … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns spin yarn, like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six nuns spin yarn?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six nuns spin yarn?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can the group of six nuns spin yarn? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should spin yarn, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.43.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Yarn means: the six (kinds of) yarn: linen, cotton, silk, wool, coarse hempen cloth, canvas.[^1]

Should spin means: if she herself spins, in the action there is an offence of wrong-doing; for every running up[^2] there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.43.2.2* There is no offence if she spins spun yarn[^3]; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
