# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 79

*Bi-Pc.79.1.1* *BD.3.392* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Thullanandā ordained the probationer Caṇḍakalī who kept company with men, who kept company with youths, who was violent,[^1] a dwelling-place of grief.[^2] Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:

“How can the lady Thullanandā ordain … grief?”

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā ordained … grief?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā *Vin.4.334* ordain … grief? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should ordain a probationer who keeps company with men, who keeps company with youths, who is violent, a dwelling-place of grief, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bi-Pc.79.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Man means: one attained to twenty years of age.

Youth means: one not attained to twenty years of age.

Keeps company means: keeps company unbecomingly as to body and speech.[^3]

Violent[^4] means: she is called angry.

Dwelling-place of grief means: she arouses sorrow in others, she enters upon grief.

Probationer means: one who has trained for two years in the six rules.

*BD.3.393* Should ordain means: … see *Bi-Pc.61.2* … and an offence of wrong-doing for the group and for the woman teacher.[^5]

* * *

*Bi-Pc.79.2.2* There is no offence if she ordains her not knowing; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
