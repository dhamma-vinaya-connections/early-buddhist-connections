# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 46

*Bi-Pc.46.1.1* *BD.3.332* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Thullanandā gave with her own hand solid food and soft food to players and dancers … see *Bi-Pc.28.1* … “… this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should give with her own hand solid food or soft food to a householder or to a wanderer or to a female wanderer, there is an offence of expiation.”[^1]

* * *

*Bi-Pc.46.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Householder means: … see *Bi-Pc.28.2* … she who has reached (the stage of a) female wanderer.

Solid food means: excluding the five (kinds of) meals and water for cleansing the teeth, the rest is called solid food.[^2]

Soft food means: the five (kinds of) meals: cooked rice, food made with flour, barley-meal, fish, meat.[^3]

Should give means: if she gives by means of the body or by means of something attached to the body or by means of something that may be cast, *Vin.4.303* there is an offence of expiation.[^4] If she gives water for cleansing the teeth, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.46.2.2* There is no offence if she gets (someone) to give (but) does not (herself) give; if she gives depositing it near; if she gives ointment for external (use); if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.[^5]
