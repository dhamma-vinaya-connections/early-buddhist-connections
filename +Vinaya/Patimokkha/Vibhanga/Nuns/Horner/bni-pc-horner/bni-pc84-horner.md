# Nuns’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 84

*Bi-Pc.84.1.1* *BD.3.400* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six nuns used sunshades and sandals. People … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns use sunshades and sandals, like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six nuns use sunshades and sandals?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks … and sandals?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can … and sandals? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should use a sunshade and sandals, there is an offence of expiation.”

And thus this rule of training for nuns came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.84.1.2* At that time a certain nun came to be ill; *Vin.4.338* there was no comfort for her without a sunshade and sandals. They told this matter to the lord. He said: “Monks, I allow a sunshade and sandals to a nun who is ill. And thus, monks, let the nuns set forth this rule of training:

“Whatever nun who is not ill should use a sunshade and sandals, there is an offence of expiation.”[^1]

* * *

*Bi-Pc.84.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Who is not ill means: for whom there is comfort without a sunshade and sandals.

*BD.3.401* Who is ill means: for whom there is not comfort without a sunshade and sandals.

Sunshade means: there are three (kinds of) sunshade: white sunshade, sunshade of rushes, sunshade of leaves, fastened at the middle, fastened to the rim.[^2]

Should use means: if she uses (them) even once, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.84.2.2* If she thinks that she is not ill when she is not ill (and) uses a sunshade and sandals, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether she is not ill … If she thinks that she is ill when she is not ill … offence of expiation. If she uses a sunshade (but) not sandals, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she uses sandals (but) not a sunshade, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is not ill when she is ill … If she is in doubt as to whether she is ill, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is ill when she is ill, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bi-Pc.84.2.3* There is no offence if she is ill; if she uses (them) in a monastery, in monastery precincts[^3]; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.
