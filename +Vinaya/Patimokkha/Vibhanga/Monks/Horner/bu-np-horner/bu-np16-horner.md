# Monks’ Forfeiture (_Nissaggiya_) 16

*Bu-NP.16.1.1* *BD.2.90* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time as a certain monk was in the country of the Kosalas[^1] going to Sāvatthī, (some) sheep’s wool[^2] accrued[^3] (to him) on the way. Then that monk went along tying up that sheep’s wool into a bundle with his upper robe.[^4] People, seeing this monk, made fun of him, saying: “For how much have you bought (it), honoured sir, how great will the profit become?”

This monk, being made fun of by these people, became ashamed.[^5] Then that monk, going to Sāvatthī, threw down[^6] the sheep’s wool even as he was standing.[^7] Monks said to this monk: “Why do you, your reverence, throw down this sheep’s wool even as you are standing?”

“Because I, your reverences, was made fun of by (some) people on account of this sheep’s wool.”

“But from how far have you, your reverence, conveyed this sheep’s wool?”

“For more than three _yojanas_,[^8] your reverences,” he *BD.2.91* said. Then those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can this monk convey sheep’s wool for more than three _yojanas_?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, conveyed sheep’s wool for more than three _yojanas_?”

“It is true, lord,” he said.

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:

“How can you, foolish man, convey sheep’s wool for more than three _yojanas_? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Sheep’s wool may accrue to a monk as he is going along a road. It may be accepted by that monk, if he likes; but having accepted it, it should be conveyed in his (own) hands for three _yojanas_ at the utmost, if there are no carriers. If he should convey it further than that, even if there are no carriers, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.” *Vin.3.234*

* * *

*Bu-NP.16.2.1* To a monk as he is going along a road means: as he is going on a roadway.[^9]

Sheep’s wool may accrue means: it may accrue from the Order or from a group or from a relation or from a friend or as rag-robes or by means of his own property.[^10]

If he likes means: if he wishes.

It may be accepted … but having accepted it, it should be conveyed in his (own) hands for three _yojanas_ at the utmost means: it should be conveyed in his (own) hands for three _yojanas_ at the maximum.

If there are no carriers means: if there is no one who is a carrier, neither a woman nor a man, nor a householder nor one who has gone forth.

If he should convey it further than that, even if there are no carriers means: if he makes the first foot go beyond three _yojanas_, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he makes the second foot go beyond, there is an *BD.2.92* offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If standing within three _yojanas_ he lets it drop beyond the three _yojanas_, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he makes it go beyond three _yojanas_, placing it in a vehicle or a bundle of another (person) without (his) knowing it, it is to be forfeited. It should be forfeited … to an individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: ‘Honoured sirs, this sheep’s wool, made by me to go beyond three _yojanas_, is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order.’ … ‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give back this sheep’s wool to the venerable one.’

If he makes it go beyond more than three _yojanas_ thinking them to be more, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If, being in doubt, he makes it go beyond more than three _yojanas_, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he makes it go beyond more than three _yojanas_ thinking them to be less, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that it is less than three _yojanas_ when it is more, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is less than three _yojanas_, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is less than three _yojanas_ when it is less, there is no offence.

There is no offence if he conveys it for three _yojanas_; if he conveys it for less than three _yojanas_; if he conveys it for three _yojanas_ and conveys it back; if desiring a habitation, going three _yojanas_, he conveys it beyond that[^11]; if he conveys something stolen that he has got back[^12]; if he conveys something destroyed that he has *BD.2.93* got back; if he makes another convey goods tied up in a bundle[^13]; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.
