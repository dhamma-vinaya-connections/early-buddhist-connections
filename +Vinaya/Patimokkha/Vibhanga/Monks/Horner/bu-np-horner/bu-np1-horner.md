# Monks’ Forfeiture (_Nissaggiya_) 1

*Bu-NP.1.1.1* *Vin.3.195* *BD.2.1* At one time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Vesālī in the Gotamaka shrine.[^1] At that time three robes were allowed to monks by the lord.[^2] The *BD.2.2* group[^3] of six monks, thinking: “Three robes are allowed by the lord,” entered a village in one set of robes, remained in the monastery[^4] in another set of three robes, went down to bathe in another set of three robes. Those who were modest monks looked down upon,[^5] criticised,[^6] spread it about,[^7] saying: “How can the group of six monks wear an extra robe?”[^8] Then these monks told this matter to the lord.

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that you wear an extra robe?”

“It is true, lord,” they said.

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

*BD.2.3* “How can you, foolish men, wear an extra robe? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased[^9] … And thus, monks, this rule of training[^10] should be set forth:

Whatever monk should wear an extra robe, there is an offence[^11] of expiation[^12] involving forfeiture.”[^13]

*BD.2.4* Thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down[^14] by the lord.

* * *

*Bu-NP.1.2.1* At that time[^15] an extra robe accrued to[^16] the venerable Ānanda; and the venerable Ānanda was desirous of giving that robe to the venerable Sāriputta, but the venerable Sāriputta was staying at Sāketa. Then it occurred to the venerable Ānanda: “A rule of training laid down by the lord is that an extra robe should not be worn. And this extra robe has accrued to me, and I am desirous of giving this robe to the venerable Sāriputta, but the venerable *Vin.3.196* Sāriputta is staying at Sāketa. Now what line of conduct should be followed by me?” Then the venerable Ānanda told this matter to the lord. He said:

“But, Ānanda, how long before Sāriputta will come (here)?”

“Lord, on the ninth or tenth day,” he said.

Then the lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk,[^17] addressed the monks, saying:

“Monks, I allow you to wear an extra robe for at most ten days. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“When the robe-material is settled,[^18] when a monk’s[^19] *BD.2.5* _kaṭhina_[^20] (privileges)[^21] have been removed,[^22] an extra robe may be worn for at most ten days. For him who exceeds that (period), there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”

* * *

*Bu-NP.1.3.1* *BD.2.6* When the robe-material is settled means: the robe-material is made up[^23] for a monk, or lost[^24] or destroyed[^25] or burnt, or an expectation of robe-material is disappointed.[^26]

When the _kaṭhina_ (privileges) have been removed means: they come to be removed because of a certain one of eight grounds,[^27] or they come to be removed before the time by the Order.

For at most ten days means: it may be worn for ten days at the maximum.

*BD.2.7* An extra robe means: one that is not allotted,[^28] not assigned.[^29]

Robe-material means: any one robe-material of the six (kinds of) robe-materials[^30] (including) the least one fit for assignment.[^31]

* * *

*Bu-NP.1.3.2* For him who exceeds that period there is an offence involving forfeiture means: it is to be forfeited on the eleventh day at sunrise; it should be forfeited to the Order,[^32] or to a group[^33] or to an individual. And thus, monks, it should be forfeited: That monk, approaching the Order, arranging his upper robe over one shoulder, honouring the feet of the senior monks, sitting down on his haunches, saluting with joined palms, should *BD.2.8* speak[^34] thus: ‘Honoured sirs, this robe is to be forfeited by me, the ten days having elapsed. I forfeit it to the Order.’ Having forfeited it, the offence should be confessed.[^35] The offence should be acknowledged by an experienced, competent monk; the robe forfeited[^36] should be given back[^37] (with the words): ‘Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This robe of the monk so and so, which had to be forfeited, is forfeited (by him) to the Order. If it seems right[^38] to the Order, the Order should give back this robe to the monk so and so.’

That monk, approaching two or three[^39] monks, arranging his upper robe over one shoulder … joined palms, should speak thus: ‘Honoured sirs, this robe *Vin.3.197* is to be forfeited by me, the ten days having elapsed. I forfeit it to the venerable ones.’ Having forfeited it, the offence should be confessed. The offence should be acknowledged by an experienced, competent monk; the robe forfeited should be given back (with the words): ‘Let the venerable ones listen to me. This robe of the monk so and so, which had to be forfeited, is forfeited (by him) to the venerable ones. If it seems right to the venerable ones, let the *BD.2.9* venerable ones give back this robe to the monk so and so.’

That monk, approaching one monk, arranging his upper robe over one shoulder, sitting down on his haunches, saluting with joined palms, should speak thus to him: ‘Your reverence,[^40] this robe is to be forfeited by me, the ten days having elapsed. I forfeit it to the venerable one.’ Having forfeited it, the offence should be confessed. The offence should be acknowledged by this monk; the robe forfeited should be given back (with the words): ‘I will give back this robe to the venerable one.’

* * *

*Bu-NP.1.4.1* If he[^41] thinks[^42] that ten days have elapsed when they have done so, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he is in doubt as to whether ten days have elapsed, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he does not think that ten days have elapsed when they have done so, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that one[^43] is allotted[^44] when it is not allotted, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that one is assigned when it is not assigned, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that one is bestowed when it is not bestowed, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that one is lost when it is not lost, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that one is destroyed when it is not destroyed, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that one is burnt *BD.2.10* when it is not burnt, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that one is stolen when it is not stolen, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. Not forfeiting the robe which had to be forfeited, if he makes use of it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.[^45] If he thinks that the ten days have elapsed when they have not elapsed, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether the ten days have not elapsed, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that the ten days have not elapsed when they have not elapsed, there is no offence.

* * *

There is no offence if, within ten days, it is allotted,[^46] assigned, bestowed, lost, destroyed, burnt,[^47] if they tear it from him,[^48] if they take it on trust[^49]; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.[^50]

* * *

*Bu-NP.1.5.1* Then[^51] the group of six monks did not give back a robe that had been forfeited. They told this matter to the lord. He said: “Monks, a robe that has been forfeited *BD.2.11* is not not to be given back.[^52] Whosoever should not give it back, there is an offence of wrong-doing.” *Vin.3.198*
