# Monks’ Forfeiture (_Nissaggiya_) 28

*Bu-NP.28.1.1* *BD.2.151* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a certain chief minister, going on a journey, sent a messenger to the monks, saying: “Let the revered sirs come, I will give a rains-residence (gift).”[^1] The monks, thinking: “A rains-residence (gift) at the end of the rains is allowed by the lord,”[^2] being scrupulous, did not go.[^3] The chief minister … spread it about, saying:

“How can the revered ones not come[^4] when a messenger was sent by me? Well, I am going with the army, life is uncertain, death is uncertain.”[^5]

Monks heard that chief minister who … spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:

“I allow you, monks, having accepted a special robe,[^6] to lay it aside.”

* * *

*Bu-NP.28.1.2* *BD.2.152* Now at that time monks said: “It is allowed by the lord, accepting a special robe, to lay it aside.” *Vin.3.261* These accepting special robes, let the robe-season[^7] pass. These robes tied up in bundles, remained on a bamboo for hanging up robes.[^8] Then the venerable Ānanda, as he was engaged in touring the lodgings, saw these robes tied up in bundles, that remained on the bamboo for hanging up robes; seeing them he said to the monks:

“Your reverences, whose are these robes, tied up in bundles, that remain on the bamboo for hanging up robes?”

“Your reverence, they are our special robes,” they said.

“But for how long, your reverences, have these robes been laid aside?”

Then these monks told the venerable Ānanda when they had been laid aside. The venerable Ānanda … spread it about, saying:

“How can these monks, having accepted a special robe, let the robe-season pass?” Then the venerable Ānanda told this matter to the lord. He said:

*BD.2.153* “Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks, having accepted a special robe, let the robe-season pass?”

“It is true, lord,” they said.

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

How, monks, can these foolish men, having accepted a special robe, let the robe-season pass? Monks, it is not for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“If a special robe should accrue[^9] to a monk ten days before the full moon of the (first) Kattika, three months (of the rains having passed),[^10] it may be accepted by that monk if he thinks of it (as something) special[^11]; having accepted it, it should be laid aside until the robe-season. But if he should lay it aside for longer than that, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”

* * *

*Bu-NP.28.2.1* Ten days before means: ten days before the ceremony held at the end of the rains.[^12]

The full moon of Kattika, three months (of the rains having passed) means: the ceremony held at the end of the rains is called Kattika.

A special robe means: one is desirous of going with *BD.2.154* the army, or one comes to be going on a journey, or one comes to be ill, or a woman becomes pregnant, or faith comes to be arisen in one who was without faith, or pleasing comes to be arisen for one who was not pleased.[^13] If such a one should send a messenger to the monks saying: ‘Let the revered sirs come, I will give a rains-residence (gift),’ this means a special robe.

It may be accepted by that monk if he thinks of it (as something) special; having accepted it, it should be laid aside until the robe-season means: making a sign,[^14] it must be laid aside; this is a special robe.

The robe-season means: if the _kaṭhina_ cloth has not been (formally) made then the last month of the rains; if it has been (formally) made, it is five months.[^15] *Vin.3.262*

If he should lay it aside for longer than that means: if the _kaṭhina_ cloth has not been (formally) made, and he lets the last day of the rains pass, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If the _kaṭhina_ cloth has been (formally) made and he lets the day for removing the _kaṭhina_ (privileges)[^16] pass, it is to be forfeited. It should be forfeited … to an individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: ‘Honoured sirs, letting pass the robe-season, this special robe of mine is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order.’ … ‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give back this special robe to the venerable one.’

If he thinks that it is a special robe when it is a special robe, and lets the robe-season pass, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he is in doubt as to whether it is a special robe and lets the robe season pass, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that it is not a special robe when it is a *BD.2.155* special robe and lets the robe-season pass, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that one is allotted when it is not allotted,[^17] there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that one is assigned when it is not assigned … If he thinks that one is bestowed when it is not bestowed … If he thinks that one is lost when it is not lost … If he thinks that one is destroyed when it is not destroyed … If he thinks that one is burnt when it is not burnt … If he thinks that one is stolen when it is not stolen and lets the robe-season pass, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. Not forfeiting the robe which had to be forfeited, if he makes use of it, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is a special robe when it is not a special robe, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not a special robe, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not a special robe when it is not a special robe, there is no offence.

There is no offence if, within the season, it is allotted, assigned, bestowed, lost, destroyed, burnt, if they tear it (from him), if they take it on trust; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.[^18]
