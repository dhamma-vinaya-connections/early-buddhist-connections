# Monks’ Forfeiture (_Nissaggiya_) 6

*Bu-NP.6.1.1* *BD.2.42* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans,[^1] came to be skilled[^2] in giving _dhamma_\-talk.[^3] Now at that time a certain son of a (great) merchant[^4] approached the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, and having approached and greeted the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, he sat down at a respectful distance.[^5] As he was sitting at a respectful distance, the venerable Upananda, the *BD.2.43* son of the Sakyans, gladdened … and delighted that son of a (great) merchant with _dhamma_\-talk. And then the son of the (great) merchant, having been gladdened … and delighted by the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, with _dhamma_\-talk, said to the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans:

“Honoured sir, do let me know what will be of use.[^6] We are able to *Vin.3.211* give to the master, that is to say of the requisites of robes, alms-food, lodgings and medicine for the sick.”[^7]

“If you, sir, are desirous of giving something to me, give (me) one cloth from these,”[^8] he said.

“Wait, honoured sir, until I go to the house; having gone to the house I will send either one cloth from these or something better than these.”

A second time the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, said to the son of the (great) merchant … A third time the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, said to the son of the (great) merchant: “If you, sir, are desirous of giving something to me, give (me) one cloth from these.”

“Now, honoured sir, for us who are sons of respectable families, it is awkward[^9] to go out with (only) one piece of cloth. Wait, honoured sir, until I go to the house; having gone to the house I will send either one cloth from these or something better than these.”

*BD.2.44* “What is the good, sir, of your offering without desire to give, because even after you have offered you do not give?”

Then that son of the (great) merchant, being pressed by the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, giving one cloth, went away.

* * *

*Bu-NP.6.1.2* People, seeing the son of a (great) merchant, spoke thus:

“Why do you, master, come with (only) one cloth?” Then this son of a (great) merchant told this matter to these people. The people looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:

“These recluses, sons of the Sakyans, have great desires, they are not contented; among them it is not easy to make reasonable requests.[^10] How can they take a cloth when a reasonable request was made by the son of a (great) merchant?”

Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:

“How can the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, ask the son of a (great) merchant for a robe?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:

“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, asked the son of the (great) merchant for a robe?”

“It is true, lord,” he said.

“Is he a relation of yours, Upananda, or not a relation?”

“He is not a relation, lord,” he said.

“Foolish man, one who is not a relation does not know what is suitable or what is unsuitable, or what is right or what is wrong for one who is not a relation.[^11] Thus you, foolish man, will ask a son of a (great) merchant for a robe. It is not, foolish man, for pleasing *BD.2.45* those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk should ask a man or a woman householder who is not a relation (of his) for a robe, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”

And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bu-NP.6.2.1* Now at that time several monks[^12] *Vin.3.212* were going along the high-road from Sāketa to Sāvatthī. Midway on the road, thieves issuing forth, plundered these monks.[^13] Then these monks said:

“It is forbidden by the lord to ask a man or woman householder who is not a relation for a robe.” And being scrupulous, they did not ask, (but) going naked as they were to Sāvatthī, they saluted the monks respectfully. The monks said:

“Your reverences, these Naked Ascetics[^14] are very good because they respectfully salute these monks.”[^15]

They said: “Your reverences, we are not Naked Ascetics, we are monks.”

The monks said to the venerable Upāli: “If so,[^16] reverend Upāli, question these.”[^17]

Then the venerable Upāli, having questioned these monks,[^18] said to the monks: “These are monks, your reverences; give them robes.”

Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can monks come naked? Should they not come covered up with grass or leaves?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on *BD.2.46* that occasion, in that connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:

“I allow, monks, one whose robe is stolen or one whose robe is destroyed, to ask a man or woman householder who is not a relation (of his) for a robe. If there is for the Order at the first residence[^19] which he approaches either a robe in the dwelling-place[^20] or a bed-cover[^21] or a ground-covering[^22] or a mattress- *BD.2.47* cover,[^23] (I allow) him to take it to put on, if he says, ‘Getting (a robe), I will replace[^24] it.’ But if there is not for the Order either a robe in the dwelling-place or a bed-cover or a ground-covering or a mattress-cover, then he should come covered up with grass or leaves; but he should not come naked. Who should so come, there is an offence of wrong-doing.[^25] And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk should ask a man or woman householder who is not a relation (of his) for a robe, except at the right time, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. This is the right time in this case: if a monk becomes one whose robe is stolen or whose robe is destroyed; in this case this is the right time.”

* * *

*Bu-NP.6.3.1* Whatever means: he who …

Monk means: … is monk to be understood in this case.

Not a relation means: one who is not related on the mother’s side or on the father’s side back through seven generations.[^26]

A householder means: he who lives in a house.[^27]

A woman householder means: she who lives in a house.[^28] *Vin.3.213*

*BD.2.48* A robe means: any one robe of the six (kinds of) robes (including) the least one fit for assignment.[^29]

Except at the right time means: setting the right time to one side.

One whose robe is stolen means: a monk’s robe becomes stolen[^30] by kings or by thieves or by rogues, or it becomes stolen by anyone whatsoever.

One whose robe is destroyed means: a monk’s robe becomes burnt by fire, or it becomes carried away by water,[^31] or it becomes eaten by rats and white ants, or it becomes worn by use.

* * *

*Bu-NP.6.3.2* If he asks, except at the right time, there is an offence of wrong-doing in the action; it is to be forfeited on acquisition. It should be forfeited to the Order, or to a group, or to an individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: ‘This robe, honoured sirs, asked for by me from a householder who is not a relation, except at the right time, is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order.’ … ‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give back this robe to the venerable one.’

* * *

*Bu-NP.6.3.3* If he thinks that a man (or woman) is not a relation when he is not a relation, (and) asks for a robe except at the right time, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he is in doubt as to whether a man is not a relation (and) asks for a robe except at the right time, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that a man is a relation when he is not a relation, (and) asks for a robe except at the right time, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that a man is not a relation when he is a relation, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether a man is a relation, *BD.2.49* there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that a man is a relation when he is a relation, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-NP.6.3.4* There is no offence if it is at the right time; if they belong to relations; if they are invited[^32]; if it is for another; if it is by means of his own property[^33]; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.
