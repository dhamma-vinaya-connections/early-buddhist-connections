# Monks’ Forfeiture (_Nissaggiya_) 26

*Bu-NP.26.1.1* *BD.2.142* … at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding-place. At that time the group of six monks, at the time of robe-making, asked for much yarn,[^1] so that when the robe-material was made much yarn came to be over. Then it occurred to the group of six monks: “Now then, your reverences, let us, asking for more yarn, have robe-material woven by weavers.” Then the group of six monks, asking for more yarn, had robe-material woven by weavers, but when the robe-material was woven much yarn came to be over. A second time did the group of six monks, asking for more yarn, have robe-material woven by weavers, but when the robe-material was woven much yarn came to be over. A third time did the group of six monks, asking for more yarn, have robe-material woven by weavers. People … spread it about, saying:

“How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, themselves asking for yarn, have robe-material woven by weavers?”

Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:

“How can the group of six monks, themselves asking for yarn, have robe-material woven by weavers?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, yourselves asking for yarn, had robe-material woven by weavers?”

“It is true, lord,” they said.

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How can you, foolish men, yourselves asking for *BD.2.143* yarn, have robe-material woven by weavers? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk, himself asking for yarn, should have robe-material woven by weavers, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”

* * *

*Bu-NP.26.2.1* Whatever means: … is monk to be understood in this case.

Himself means: himself asking.

Yarn means: the six (kinds of) yarn[^2]: linen, cotton, silk, wool,[^3] coarse hempen cloth,[^4] canvas.[^5]

By weavers[^6] means: if he has it woven by weavers[^7] there is an offence of wrong-doing in the action. It is *BD.2.144* to be forfeited on acquisition; it should be forfeited to … an individual. *Vin.3.257* And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: ‘Honoured sirs, this robe caused by me to be woven by weavers, having myself asked for the yarn, is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order.’ … ‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give back this robe to the venerable one.’

If he thinks that it was caused to be woven when it was caused to be woven, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he is in doubt as to whether it was caused to be woven, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that it was not caused to be woven when it was caused to be woven, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that it was caused to be woven when it was not caused to be woven, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it was not caused to be woven, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it was not caused to be woven when it was not caused to be woven, there is no offence.

* * *

It is no offence to sew a robe[^8] to a binding,[^9] to a belt,[^10] to a shoulder-strap,[^11] to a bag for carrying the bowl in,[^12] to a water-strainer[^13]; if it belongs to relations; if they are invited; if it is for another; if it is by means of his own property[^14]; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.
