# Monks’ Forfeiture (_Nissaggiya_) 12

*Bu-NP.12.1.1* *BD.2.74* … at Vesālī in the Great Grove in the Hall of the Peaked Roof. At that time the group of six monks had a rug[^1] made of pure black sheep’s[^2] wool. People, engaged in touring the dwelling-place, seeing them … spread it about, saying: “How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, have a rug made of pure black sheep’s wool, like householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:

“How can the group of six monks have a rug made of pure black sheep’s wool?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, had a rug made of pure black sheep’s wool?”

“It is true, lord,” they said.

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How can you, foolish men, have a rug made of pure black sheep’s wool? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk should cause a rug to be made of pure black sheep’s wool, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”

* * *

*Bu-NP.12.2.1* *BD.2.75* Whatever means: … is monk to be understood in this case.

Black means: there are two (kinds of) black: black by nature or dyed black.

A rug means: it is made “having spread,” not woven. *Vin.3.226*

Should cause to be made means: if he makes it or causes it to be made, there is an offence of wrong-doing in the action. It is to be forfeited … to an individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: … ‘… this rug which I, honoured sirs, had made of pure black sheep’s wool …’ … if he is the first wrong-doer.[^3]
