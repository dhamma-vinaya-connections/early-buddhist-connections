# Monks’ Forfeiture (_Nissaggiya_) 10

*Bu-NP.10.1.1* *BD.2.62* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a chief minister,[^1] the supporter of the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, sent a robe-fund[^2] by a messenger to the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, saying: “Having got a robe in exchange for this robe-fund, present master Upananda with a robe.”

Then that messenger approached the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, and having approached, he said to the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans: “Honoured sir, this robe-fund was brought for the venerable one; let the venerable one accept this robe-fund.” *Vin.3.220*

When he had spoken thus, the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, said to that messenger: “Sir, we do not accept a robe-fund; but we accept a robe if it is at the right time and if it is allowable.”[^3]

When he had spoken thus, that messenger said to the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans: “But is there someone who is the venerable one’s attendant[^4]?”

At that time a certain lay-follower went to the monastery on some business or other. Then the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, said to that messenger: “Sir, this lay-follower is the monks’ attendant.”

Then that messenger, informing[^5] that lay-follower, *BD.2.63* approached the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, and having approached, he said to the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans:

“Honoured sir, the person whom the venerable one has pointed out as an attendant has been instructed[^6] by me; let the venerable one approach (him) at the right time (and) he will present you with a robe.”

Then the chief minister sent a messenger to the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, to say: “Let the master make use of this robe; we want this robe made use of by the master.”

Then the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, did not say anything to that lay-follower. A second time the chief minister sent a messenger to the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, to say: “Let the master make use of … by the master. “A second time the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, did not say anything to that lay-follower. A third time the chief minister sent a messenger to the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, to say: “Let the master make use of … by the master.”

* * *

*Bu-NP.10.1.2* Now at that time there came to be a meeting-day for the townspeople,[^7] and an agreement was made by the townspeople that: Whoever comes the last pays fifty.[^8] Then the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, approached that lay-follower, and having approached, he said to that lay-follower:

*BD.2.64* “Sir, I want the robe.”

“Honoured sir, wait this day[^9] (only). Today there comes to be a meeting-day for the townspeople, and an agreement was made by the townspeople that: Whoever comes last pays fifty.”

“Sir, give me the robe this very day,”[^10] he said, and he took hold of his waist-band.[^11] Then that lay-follower, being pressed by the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, having got a robe in exchange for the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, went the last. People said to this lay-follower: “Why do you, master, come the last? You have lost fifty.”[^12] Then that lay-follower told this matter to those people. The people … spread it about, saying:

“These recluses, sons of the Sakyans, have great desires, they are not contented; *Vin.3.221* amongst them it is not easy to render a service. How can they, being told by a lay-follower: ‘Honoured sir, wait this day (only),’ not wait?” Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, being told by a lay-follower: ‘Honoured sir, wait this day (only),’ not wait?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:

“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, being *BD.2.65* told by a lay-follower: ‘Honoured sir, wait this day (only),’ did not wait?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:

“How can you, foolish man, being told by a lay-follower: ‘Honoured sir, wait this day (only),’ not wait? Foolish man, it is not for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

*Bu-NP.10.1.3*“In case a king or one in the service of a king[^13] or a brahmin or a householder should send a robe-fund for a monk by a messenger, saying: ‘Having got a robe in exchange for this robe-fund, present the monk so and so with a robe’; then if this messenger, approaching that monk, should say: ‘Honoured sir, this robe-fund was brought for the venerable one; let the venerable one accept this robe-fund,’ then the messenger should be spoken to thus by this monk: ‘Sir, we do not accept a robe-fund, but we accept a robe if it is at the right time and if it is allowable.’ If this messenger should say to the monk: ‘But is there someone who is the venerable one’s attendant?’, then, monks,[^14] an attendant should be pointed out by the monk in need of a robe—either one who is engaged in the monastery[^15] or a lay-follower—saying: ‘This is the monks’ attendant.’ If this messenger, instructing this attendant, approaching that monk, should speak thus: ‘Honoured *BD.2.66* sir, I have instructed the person whom the venerable one pointed out as an attendant; let the venerable one approach at the right time, (and) he will present you with a robe’; then, monks, if that monk is in need of a robe, approaching that attendant, he should state[^16] and remind him two or three times, saying: ‘Sir, I am in need of a robe.’ If while stating and reminding two or three times, he succeeds in obtaining[^17] that robe, that is good. If he does not succeed in obtaining it, he should stand silently[^18] for it four times, five times, six times at the utmost. If he succeeds in obtaining that robe, standing silently for it, four times, five times, six times at the utmost, *Vin.3.222* that is good. If he, exerting himself[^19] further than that, succeeds in obtaining that robe, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he does not succeed in obtaining it, he should either go himself to where the robe-fund was brought from for him,[^20] or a messenger should be sent to say: ‘That robe-fund which you, sirs, sent for a monk, is not of any use to that monk.[^21] Let the gentlemen make use of their own,[^22] let your own things be not lost.’[^23] This is the proper course in this case.”

* * *

*Bu-NP.10.2.1* For a monk means: for the good of a monk, making a monk his object, being desirous of presenting to a monk.

A king means: he who rules a kingdom.

*BD.2.67* One in the king’s service means: whoever is in the king’s pay.[^24]

A brahmin means: a brahmin by birth.

A householder means: excepting the king and he who is in the king’s service and the brahmin, he who remains is called a householder.[^25]

A robe-fund means: gold or a gold coin or a pearl or a jewel.[^26]

For this robe-fund means: for what is present.

Having got in exchange means: having bartered.

Present means: give.

If that messenger, approaching that monk, should say : ‘Honoured sir, this robe-fund was brought for the venerable one, let the venerable one accept this robe-fund,’ then this messenger should be spoken to thus by this monk: … ‘… is the monks’ attendant.’ He should not say: ‘Give it to him,’ or ‘He will deposit it,’ or ‘He will barter it,’ or ‘He will get it in exchange.’

If this messenger, instructing this attendant, approaching that monk, should speak thus: ‘Honoured sir, I have instructed the person whom the venerable one pointed out as an attendant; let the venerable one approach at the right time (and) he will present you with a robe’; then, monks, if that monk is in need of a robe, approaching that attendant, he should state and remind him two or three times, saying: ‘Sir, I am in need of a robe.’ He should not say: ‘Give me a robe,’ ‘Fetch me a robe,’ ‘Barter a robe for me,’ ‘Get a robe in exchange for me.’ A second time he should say … A third time he should say …

If … he succeeds in obtaining (that robe), that is good. If he does not succeed in obtaining it, going there, he should stand silently for it; he should not sit down on a seat, he should not accept food, he should not *BD.2.68* teach dhamma[^27]; being asked, ‘Why did you come?’ he should say: ‘You know it, sir.’ If he either sits down on a seat *Vin.3.223* or accepts food or teaches _dhamma_, he loses an opportunity.[^28] A second time he may stand. A third time he may stand. Having stated four times, he may stand four times. Having stated five times, he may stand twice. Having stated six times, he may not stand.[^29]

* * *

*Bu-NP.10.2.2* If he, exerting himself further than that, succeeds in obtaining that robe, there is an offence of wrong-doing in the action. It is to be forfeited on acquisition; it should be forfeited to the Order, or to a group, or to an *BD.2.69* individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: ‘Honoured sirs, this robe obtained by me, by stating more than three times, by standing more than six times, is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order.’ … ‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give back this robe to the monk so and so.’

If he does not succeed in obtaining it, he should either go himself to where the robe-fund was brought from for him, or a messenger should be sent to say: ‘That robe-fund which you, sirs, sent for a monk, is not of any use to that monk. Let the gentlemen make use of their own, let your own things be not lost.’

This is the proper course[^30] in this case means: this is the appropriate course[^31] in this case.

* * *

*Bu-NP.10.2.3* If he succeeds in obtaining it by stating more than three times, by standing more than six times, thinking that they are more, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he succeeds in obtaining it by stating more than three times, by standing more than six times, but is in doubt (as to the number of times), there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he succeeds in obtaining it by stating more than three times, by standing more than six times, thinking them to be less, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If, stating less than three times, standing less than six times, he thinks them to be more, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If stating less than three times, standing less than six times, he is in doubt (as to the number), there is an offence of wrong-doing. If, stating less than three times, standing less than six times, he thinks them to be less, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-NP.10.2.4* There is no offence in stating three times, in standing six times; in stating less than three times, in standing *BD.2.70* less than six times; if himself not stating, he gives; if stating, the owners give; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.

* * *

The First Division: that on Kaṭhina-cloth[^32]

##### This is its key:[^33]

Ten (nights), one night, and a month,  
and washing, acceptance,  
Three about those who are not relations, of two,  
and by means of a messenger. *Vin.3.224*
