# Monks’ Forfeiture (_Nissaggiya_) 7

*Bu-NP.7.1.1* *BD.2.50* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. At that time the group of six monks having come up to monks whose robes had been stolen, said: “Your reverences, one whose robe has been stolen or one whose robe has been destroyed is allowed by the lord to ask for a robe from a man or woman householder who is not a relation[^1]; your reverences, ask (them) for a robe.”

They said: “No, we don’t want[^2] (one), your reverences, a robe has been obtained by us.”

“We are asking for the venerable ones,” they said.

“Do ask (them), your reverences.”

Then the group of six monks, having approached householders, said:

“Sirs, monks are coming whose robes have been stolen; give them robes,” (and) they asked for many robes. At that *Vin.3.214* time a certain man who was sitting in a village assembly hall[^3] said to another man:

“Master,[^4] monks are coming whose robes have been stolen; I gave them a robe.”

Then he said: “I also gave (to them).”

Then another man said: “I also gave (to them).”

These men … spread it about, saying: “How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, not knowing moderation,[^5] ask for many robes? Will the recluses, sons of the Sakyans, deal in the cloth trade[^6] or will they set up a shop[^7]?”

The monks heard these men who … spread it about.

*BD.2.51* Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can the group of six monks, not knowing moderation, ask for many robes?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, not knowing moderation, asked for many robes?”

“It is true, lord,” they said.

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How can you, foolish men, not knowing moderation, ask for many robes? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“If a man or a woman householder who is not a relation, asking (a monk), should invite[^8] him (to take material for) many robes, then at most (material for) an inner and an upper robe[^9] should be accepted as robe-material by that monk; if he should accept more than that, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”

* * *

*Bu-NP.7.2.1* Him means: the monk whose robe has been stolen.

A man who is not a relation means: … See *Bu-NP.6.3.1* … she who lives in a house.

(For) many robes[^10] means: (for) abundant robes.[^11]

Asking, should invite means: he says, “Take just as much as you want.”

At most (material for) an inner and an upper robe *BD.2.52* should be accepted as robe-material by that monk means: if the three (robes) come to be destroyed, two may be accepted; if two are destroyed, one may be accepted; if one is destroyed nothing may be accepted.

If he should accept more than that means: if he asks for more than that there is an offence of wrong-domg in the action. It is to be forfeited on acquisition; it should be forfeited to the Order, or to a group, or to an individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: ‘Honoured sirs, having gone up to a householder who is not a relation, this robe material asked for by me more than that (which I should ask for), *Vin.3.215* is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order.’ … ‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give back this robe to the venerable one.’

* * *

*Bu-NP.7.2.2* If he thinks that a man is not a relation when is he not a relation (and) asks for robe-material more than that (which he should ask for), there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he is in doubt as to whether he is not a relation … See *Bu-NP.6.2* … is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-NP.7.2.3* There is no offence if, saying: ‘I will take the remainder,’ taking it he goes away; if they give the remainder, saying: ‘Let it be only for you’; if they do not give because (a robe was) stolen[^12]; if they do not give because (a robe was) destroyed; if they belong to relations[^13]; if they are invited; if it is by means of his own property[^14]; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.
