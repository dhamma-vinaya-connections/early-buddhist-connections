# Monks’ Forfeiture (_Nissaggiya_) 5

*Bu-NP.5.1.1* *BD.2.36* … at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding-place. At that time the nun Uppalavaṇṇā[^1] was staying at Sāvatthī. Then the nun Uppalavaṇṇā, dressing in the morning *Vin.3.208* and taking her bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms-food. Having wandered about Sāvatthī for alms-food, returning from her alms-gathering after her meal,[^2] she approached the Blind Men’s Grove[^3] for the mid-day rest; having plunged into the Blind Men’s Grove she sat down at the foot of a tree for the mid-day rest. Now at that time some thieves, having done their deeds,[^4] having killed a cow[^5] and taken the flesh, entered the Blind Men’s Grove. Then the robber-chief saw the nun Uppalavaṇṇā as she was sitting at the foot of the tree for the mid-day rest, and seeing her, it occurred to him: *BD.2.37* “If my sons and brothers see this nun they will trouble her,” and he went by a different way.[^6]

Then that robber-chief, taking the best meats of the cooked meat, tying (them up) in a leaf-packet, and hanging it up on a tree near the nun Uppalavaṇṇā, said: “Whatever recluse or brahmin sees it, it is given (to him), let him take it,”[^7] and having spoken thus, he departed. Then the nun Uppalavaṇṇā, arising from contemplation,[^8] heard these words of that robber-chief as he was speaking.[^9] Then the nun Uppalavaṇṇā, taking that meat, went to the nunnery. Then the nun Uppalavaṇṇā, having prepared[^10] that meat at the end of that night, tying it up into a bundle with her upper robe,[^11] rising in the air,[^12] reappeared in the Bamboo Grove.

* * *

*Bu-NP.5.1.2* Now at that time the lord was visiting the village for alms-food, and the venerable Udāyin came to be the one left behind as guardian of the dwelling. Then the nun Uppalavaṇṇā approached the venerable Udāyin, and having approached, she said to the venerable Udāyin:

“Where, honoured sir, is the lord?”

*BD.2.38* He said, “Sister, the lord has entered the village for alms-food.”

“Give this meat to the lord, honoured sir,” she said.

“You, sister, have pleased the lord with this meat; if you were to give me your inner robe, likewise would I become pleased with the inner robe.”[^13]

“But we women, honoured sir, get things with difficulty. This is my last, (my) fifth robe.[^14] I shall not give it to you,” she said.

“It is as if, sister, a man giving an elephant should caparison[^15] its girth,[^16] yet even so do you, sister, (though) giving meat to the lord, not give[^17] me your inner robe.”[^18]

Then the nun Uppalavaṇṇā, being pressed by the venerable Udāyin, giving him her inner robe, went to the nunnery. The nuns, taking the nun Uppalavaṇṇā’s bowl and robe, said to the nun Uppalavaṇṇā:

“Lady, where is your inner robe?”

The nun Uppalavaṇṇā told this matter to the nuns. The nuns *Vin.3.209* looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:

“How can the venerable Udāyin accept a robe from a nun? Women come by things with difficulty.” And *BD.2.39* then these nuns told this matter to the monks. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:

“How can the venerable Udāyin accept a robe from a nun?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:

“Is it true, as is said, that you, Udāyin, accepted a robe from a nun?”

“It is true, lord.”

“Is she a relation of yours, Udāyin, or not a relation?”

“She is not a relation, lord,” he said.

“Foolish man, one who is not a relation does not know what is suitable or what is unsuitable, or what is right[^19] or what is wrong for a woman who is not a relation.[^20] Thus you, foolish man, will accept a robe from the hand of a nun who is not a relation. It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk should accept a robe from the hand of a nun who is not a relation, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”

And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bu-NP.5.2.1* Then scrupulous monks did not accept exchange of robes[^21] with nuns. The nuns … spread it about, saying:

“How can the masters not accept exchange of robes with us?”

Monks heard these nuns who looked down upon, criticised, spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:

“Monks, I allow you to accept exchange among these *BD.2.40* five (classes of people)[^22]: a monk, a nun, a female probationer, a male novice, a female novice. I allow you, monks, to accept exchange among these five (classes of people). And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk should accept a robe from the hand of a nun who is not a relation, except in exchange, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”[^23]

* * *

*Bu-NP.5.3.1* Whatever means: … See *Bu-NP.4.2.1* …

Nun means: one ordained by both Orders.[^24] *Vin.3.210*

A robe means: any one robe of the six (kinds of) robes (including) the least one fit for assignment.[^25]

Except in exchange means: without an exchange.

He accepts: in the action there is an offence of wrong-doing; it should be forfeited on acquisition; it should be forfeited to the Order, or to a group, or to an individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: ‘Honoured sirs, this robe, accepted from the hand of a nun who is not a relation, is to be forfeited by me. I forfeit it to the Order.’ … ‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give back this robe to the venerable one.’

* * *

*Bu-NP.5.3.2* If he thinks that a woman is not a relation when she is not a relation, (and) accepts a robe, except in exchange, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he is in doubt as to whether the woman is not a relation, (and) accepts a robe, except in exchange, there is an offence of expiation invoking forfeiture. If he thinks that a woman is a relation when she is not a relation, (and) accepts a robe, except *BD.2.41* in exchange, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he accepts a robe, except in exchange, from the hand of a woman ordained by one (Order only),[^26] there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that a woman is not a relation when she is a relation, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether a woman is a relation, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that a woman is a relation when she is a relation, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-NP.5.3.3* There is no offence if she is a relation; if there is an exchange; if there is a large thing for a small thing, or a small thing for a large thing[^27]; if a monk takes it on trust[^28]; if he takes it for the time being; if he takes another requisite, except the robe; if she is a female probationer, a female novice; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.
