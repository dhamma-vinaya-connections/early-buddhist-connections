# Monks’ Formal Meeting (_Saṅghādisesa_) 3

*BD.1.214* *Bu-Ss.3.1.1* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. At that time the venerable Udāyin lived in the jungle. The venerable one’s dwelling was lovely, good to look upon, beautiful. At that time many women came to the park[^1] in order to see the dwelling. Then those women approached the venerable Udāyin, and having approached him, they said to the venerable Udāyin:

“Honoured sir, we want to see the master’s dwelling.”

Then the venerable Udāyin, showing these women his dwelling and pointing out[^2] the privies to them, spoke in praise, spoke in blame and begged and implored and asked and questioned and described and exhorted and abused. Those *Vin.3.128* women who had little fear of blame,[^3] who were sly and who had no shame mocked at the venerable Udāyin, called out to him, laughed at him, made fun of him.[^4] But those women who had shame, upon departing complained to the monks, saying:

“Honoured sirs, this is not suitable, it is not fitting, we should not wish this spoken about even by our husbands, to say nothing of master Udāyin.”[^5]

* * *

*Bu-Ss.3.1.2* Then those who were modest monks became annoyed, vexed and angry and said:

*BD.1.215* “How can the venerable Udāyin offend women with lewd words?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion and in this connection had the company of monks convened and questioned the venerable Udāyin, saying:

“Is it true as is said, Udāyin, that you offended women with lewd words?”

“It is true, lord,” he said.

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:

“It is not suitable, foolish man, it is not proper, it is not becoming, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is out of place, it is not to be done. How can you, foolish man, offend women with lewd words? Foolish man, is not _dhamma_ uttered in various ways by me for the sake of passionlessness, not for the sake of passion … proclaimed for the allaying of the flames of pleasures of the senses? It is not, foolish man, for the benefit of unbelievers … and thus, monks, this course of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk, affected by desire[^6], with perverted heart,[^7] should offend a woman with lewd words concerned with unchastity, as, for example, a youth to a young woman, it is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.”

* * *

*Bu-Ss.3.2.1* Whatever means: he who …

Monk means: … this is how monk is to be understood in this meaning.

Affected by desire means: infatuated, full of desire, physically in love with.[^8]

Perverted means: the perverted heart is impassioned, the perverted heart is corrupt, the perverted heart is erring. And in this meaning it is understood that the perverted heart is impassioned.[^9]

Woman means: a human woman, not a female _yakkha_, not a female departed one, not a female animal[^10]; she is *BD.1.216* intelligent, competent to know good and bad speech, what is lewd and what is not lewd.[^11]

Lewd speech means: speech connected with privies and with unchastity.

Should offend[^12] means: it is called a transgression.[^13]

As, for example, a youth to a young woman means: a lad to a young girl, a boy of tender age to a girl of tender age, a male enjoying sense-pleasures to a female enjoying sense-pleasures. *Vin.3.129*

Concerned with unchastity means: connected with unchaste things.[^14]

A formal meeting of the Order means: … because of this it is called a formal meeting of the Order.

He asks means: he says, “How do you give to your husband? How do you give to a paramour?”

*BD.1.217* He questions means: he says, “They say that as you give to your husband so you give to your paramour.”

He describes means: having asked, he says: “Give thus, giving thus you will become dear and beloved to your husband.”

He exhorts means: not having asked, he says: “Give thus, giving thus you will become dear and beloved to your husband.”
