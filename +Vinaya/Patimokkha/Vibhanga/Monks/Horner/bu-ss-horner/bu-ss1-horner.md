# Monks’ Formal Meeting (_Saṅghādisesa_) 1

*BD.1.192* *Bu-Ss.1.1.1* At one time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Now at that time the venerable Seyyasaka[^1] led the Brahma-life, dissatisfied.[^2] Because of this he was thin, wretched, his colour bad, yellowish, the veins showing all over his body.[^3] The venerable Udāyin saw the venerable Seyyasaka thin, wretched, his colour bad, yellowish, his veins showing all over his body. Seeing him thus, he said to the venerable Seyyasaka: “Reverend Seyyasaka, why are you thin, wretched … the veins showing all over your body? Perhaps it is that you, reverend Seyyasaka, lead the Brahma-life, dissatisfied?”

“It is so, your reverence,” he said.

“Now then, you, reverend Seyyasaka, eat as much as you like, sleep as much as you like, bath[^4] as much as you like: eating as much as you like, sleeping as much as you like, bathing as much as you like, if dissatisfaction arises in you and passion assails[^5] your heart, then emit semen using your hand.”[^6]

*BD.1.193* “But, your reverence, are you sure that it is suitable to act like this?”

“Yes, your reverence, I do this.”

Then the venerable Seyyasaka ate as much as he liked, slept as much as he liked, bathed as much as he liked; but having eaten as much as he liked, slept as much as he liked, bathed as much as he liked, dissatisfaction arose, and passion assailed his heart, so he emitted semen using his hand. Then in a short time the venerable Seyyasaka was nice-looking with rounded features, of a bright complexion and a clear skin. So the monks who were the friends of the venerable Seyyasaka spoke thus to the venerable Seyyasaka:

“Formerly, reverend Seyyasaka, you were thin, wretched, of a bad colour, yellowish, with the veins showing all over your body. But now, at present, you are nice-looking with rounded features, *Vin.3.111* of a bright complexion and a clear skin. Why now, do you take medicine,[^7] reverend Seyyasaka?”

“I do not take medicine, your reverences, but I am eating as much as I like, I am sleeping as much as I like, I am bathing as much as I like; then eating as much as I like, sleeping as much as I like, bathing as much as I like, if dissatisfaction arises in me and passion assails the heart, I emit semen using my hand.”

* * *

*Bu-Ss.1.1.2* “But do you, reverend Seyyasaka, eat the gifts of faith[^8] with the very same hand as that which you use to emit semen?”

“Yes, your reverences,” he said.

Those who were modest monks became annoyed, vexed and angry, saying:

*BD.1.194* “How can the venerable Seyyasaka emit semen in this way?”

Then these monks, having rebuked the venerable Seyyasaka in various ways, told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion, in this connection, having had the order of monks convened, asked the venerable Seyyasaka:

“Is it true, as is said, that you, Seyyasaka, using your hand, emit semen?”

“It is true, lord,” he said.

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying: “It is not fit, foolish man, it is not becoming, it is not suitable, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not right, it is not to be done. How can you, foolish man, emit semen using your hand? Foolish man, have I not uttered _dhamma_ in many ways for the stilling of passion,[^9] and not for the sake of passion, taught _dhamma_ for the sake of being devoid of the fetters, and not for the sake of being bound, taught _dhamma_ for the sake of being without grasping,[^10] and not for the sake of grasping? How can you, foolish man, while _dhamma_ is taught by me for the sake of passionlessness, strive after passion? How can you, while _dhamma_ is taught for the sake of being devoid of the fetters, strive after being bound? How can you, while _dhamma_ is taught for the sake of being without grasping, strive after grasping? Foolish man, have I not taught _dhamma_ in various ways for the stilling of passion, taught _dhamma_ for the subduing of conceit, for the restraint of thirst, for the elimination of attachment, for the cutting through the round of becomings, for the destruction of craving, for passionlessness, for stopping, for waning? Foolish man, have I not declared in various ways the destruction of the pleasures of the senses, declared the full understanding of ideas of the pleasures of the senses, declared the restraint *BD.1.195* of the thirst for pleasures of the senses, declared the elimination of thoughts of pleasures of the senses, declared the allaying of the fever of pleasures of the senses? Foolish man, it is not for the benefit of unbelievers, nor for increase in the number of believers, but it is, foolish man, to the detriment of unbelievers as well as of believers, and it causes wavering in some.”

Then the lord having rebuked the venerable Seyyasaka *Vin.3.112* in various ways on account of his difficulty in maintaining his state … said:

“… Thus, monks, this course of training should be set forth:

Intentional emission of semen is a matter entailing a formal meeting of the Order.”[^11]

Thus this course of training for monks was made known to the lord.

* * *

*Bu-Ss.1.2.1* Now at that time, monks, having eaten abundant food, went to sleep, thoughtless and careless. While they were sleeping, thoughtless and careless, one of them emitted semen as the result of a dream. These were remorseful and said[^12]: “The course of training made *BD.1.196* known by the lord says that intentional emission of semen is a matter requiring a formal meeting of the Order; and because of a dream one of us (did this). Now is this intention permitted? What now if we have fallen into an offence requiring a formal meeting of the Order?” They told this matter to the lord. He said:

“Monks, this was the intention, but it does not apply.[^13] monks, this course of training should be set forth:

Intentional emission of semen except during a dream is an offence requiring a formal meeting of the Order.”

* * *

*Bu-Ss.1.2.2* Intentional means: a transgression committed knowingly, consciously, deliberately.[^14]

Semen means: there are\* ten kinds of semen …

Emission means: the removal from the place is called emission.

Except during a dream means: setting the dream aside.

Offence requiring a formal meeting of the Order means: the Order places him on probation[^15] on account of the offence, it sends him back to the beginning,[^16] it inflicts the _mānatta_ discipline;[^17] it rehabilitates[^18]; it is not many *BD.1.197* people, it is not one man; therefore it is called an offence which in the earlier as well as the later stages (requires) a formal meeting of the Order. A synonym for this class of offence is a work;[^19] therefore, again, it is called (an offence which in the earlier as well as the later stages requires) a formal meeting of the Order.[^20]

* * *

*Bu-Ss.1.3* The whole of *Bu-Ss.1.3*, Vin.3.112–Vin.3.115, because of the outspokenness and crudeness which it contains, and which seems to be inseperable from early literatures, appears unsuitable for incorporation in a translation designed principally for Western readers.

*Vin.3.116*He aims at it, makes the effort, it is emitted—an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. He aims at it, makes the effort, it is not emitted—a grave offence. He aims at it, does not make the effort, it is emitted—not an offence. He aims at it, does not make the effort, it is not emitted—not an offence. He does not aim at it, he makes the effort, it is emitted—not an offence. He does not aim at it, does not make the effort, it is emitted—not an offence. He does not aim at it, does not make the effort, it is not emitted—not an offence.

* * *

There is no offence if he was dreaming, if there was no intentional emission, if he was mad, unhinged, in pain, a beginner.

*Bu-Ss.1.4.1* A dream, excrement and urine, reflection, and about hot water,  
Medicine, itching, the way, the bladder, a hot room for bathing-purposes, making an effort,  
*BD.1.198* And a novice, and asleep, the thigh, he pressed with the fists,  
In the air, firmness, he meditated on, an aperture, he hit with a stick, /  
In the stream, muddy water, running, a twist of flowers, a lotus,  
Sand, mud, water, lying down, and with the thumbs.

At one time while a certain monk was dreaming he emitted semen. He was remorseful and said: “What now if I have fallen into an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order?” That monk told this matter to the lord. He said: “There is no offence for the monk because he was dreaming.”

* * *

*Bu-Ss.1.5* The reasons for not including the remainder of *BD.1.5* in this translation are the same as those for not including *BD.1.3* above.

Told is the First Offence entailing a formal Meeting of the Order
