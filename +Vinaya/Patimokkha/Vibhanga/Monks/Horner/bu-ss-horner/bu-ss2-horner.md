# Monks’ Formal Meeting (_Saṅghādisesa_) 2

*BD.1.199* *Bu-Ss.2.1.1* *Vin.3.119* At one time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇdika’s park. At that time the venerable Udāyin lived in the jungle. The dwelling[^1] of the venerable one was lovely, good to look upon, beautiful, the inner chamber in the middle was entirely surrounded by the house; the couch and chair, the bolster and pillow were well designed, the water used for drinking and that used for washing were well placed; the cell[^2] was well swept. Many people came to look at the dwelling of the venerable Udāyin, and a certain brahmin together with his wife approached the venerable Udāyin, and having approached the venerable Udāyin, he said: “We want to see the dwelling of the good Udāyin.”

“Do look at it, brahmin,” he said, and taking the key, unfastening the bolt, and opening the door,[^3] he entered the dwelling. The brahmin entered after the venerable Udāyin, and the brahmin lady entered behind the brahmin. Then the venerable. Udāyin, opening some windows and closing others, going round about the inner room, and coming up from behind, rubbed up against[^4] the brahmin lady limb by limb. Then the *BD.1.200* brahmin, having exchanged greetings with the venerable Udāyin, went away. Then the brahmin, who was pleased, burst out with a cry of pleasure:[^5] “Superb are these recluses, sons of the Sakyans; who dwell in such a jungle, superb is the revered Udāyin who dwells in such a jungle.”

Having spoken thus, the brahmin lady said to the brahmin: *Vin.3.120*

“What is there superb about him? Even as you rubbed up against me limb by limb, so did this recluse Udāyin rub up against me limb by limb.”

Then the brahmin became annoyed, vexed, angry and said:

“These recluses, sons of the Sakyans,[^6] are shameless, of low morality, liars. And they pretend to be walking by _dhamma_, walking by right, leading the Brahma-life, speaking truth, virtuous, of good conduct. Among these there is no recluseship, among these there is no brahminhood. Perished is recluseship among these, perished is brahminhood among these. Where is recluseship among these? Where is brahminhood among these? Fallen from recluseship are these, fallen from brahminhood are these. How can this recluse Udāyin rub up against my wife limb by limb? It is not possible to go to the park or dwelling with wives of respectable families, with daughters of respectable families, with girls of respectable families,[^7] with daughters-in-law[^8] of respectable families, with women-slaves of respectable *BD.1.201* families. If wives of respectable families, daughters of respectable families, girls of respectable families, daughters-in-law of respectable families, women-slaves of respectable families should go to a park or dwelling, the recluses, sons of the Sakyans, may assault them.”

* * *

*Bu-Ss.2.1.2* The monks heard this brahmin as he was grumbling, murmuring, and becoming angry. Those who were modest monks became annoyed, vexed, angry and said: “How can the reverend Udāyin come into bodily contact with women-kind?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion, for this reason, causing the Order of monks to be convened, asked the reverend Udāyin:

“Is it true as they say, Udāyin, that you came into bodily contact with a woman?”

“It is true, lord,” he said.

Then the enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:

“It is not right, foolish man, it is not becoming, it is not suitable, it is not fit in a recluse, it is not proper, it is not to be done. How can you, foolish man, come into bodily contact with a woman? Foolish man, is not _dhamma_ uttered by me in various ways for the sake of stilling passion, and not for the sake of passion … declared the allaying of the flames of the pleasures of the senses? It is not, foolish man, for the benefit of unbelievers … Thus, monks, this course of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk, affected by desire,[^9] with perverted[^10] heart, should come into[^11] physical contact with a woman, *BD.1.202* holding her hand, or holding a braid of her hair, or rubbing against any one or other of her limbs: this is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.”

* * *

*Bu-Ss.2.2.1* Whatever means: he who …

Monk means: … this is how monk is to be understood in this sense. *Vin.3.121*

Affected by desire means: infatuated, full of desire, physically in love with.[^12]

Perverted means: the perverted heart is impassioned, the perverted heart is corrupt, the perverted heart is erring. And in this meaning it is to be understood that the perverted heart is impassioned.[^13]

Woman means: a human woman, not a female _yakkha_, not a female departed one, not a female animal,[^14] even a girl born on this very day, all the more an older one.[^15]

Together with means: together.

Should come into physical contact means: it is called a transgression.[^16]

*BD.1.203* The hand means: going up from the tip of the nail as far as the elbow.

Braid of hair means: nothing but hair,[^17] or mixed with threads,[^18] or mixed with garlands,[^19] or mixed with gold coins,[^20] or mixed with gold,[^21] or mixed with pearls, or mixed with jewels.[^22]

A limb means: setting to one side a hand and a braid of hair, what remains is called a limb.

* * *

*Bu-Ss.2.2.2* Rubbing, rubbing up against, rubbing downwards, rubbing upwards,[^23] bending down, raising up, drawing to, pushing back, holding back hard, taking hard hold of, the grasp, the touch.

Rubbing is called merely rubbed. Rubbing up *BD.1.204* against is called moving from here and there. Rubbing downwards is called bringing down low. Rubbing upwards is called raising up high. Bending down is called lowering. Bending up is called raising up high. Drawing to is called pulling. Pushing back is called sending back. Holding back hard[^24] is called holding back having taken hold of a limb. Taking hard hold of is called taking hold together with someone. Grasp is called merely taken. Touch means merely contact.

Offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order means: … therefore it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.
