# Monks’ Formal Meeting (_Saṅghādisesa_) 7

*BD.1.266* *Bu-Ss.7.1.1* … at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Park.[^1] At that time a householder, the supporter[^2] of the venerable Channa,[^3] said to the venerable Channa:

“Do find out a site for a _vihāra_,[^4] honoured sir. I will have a _vihāra_ built for the master.”

Then the venerable Channa, clearing a site for the _vihāra_, had a tree cut down that was used as a shrine,[^5] revered by village, revered by little town, revered by town, revered by the country-side, revered by the kingdom. People became vexed, annoyed, angry, saying: “How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, have a tree cut down that is used as a shrine *Vin.3.156* revered by village … revered by the kingdom? The recluses, sons of the Sakyans, are depriving a one-facultied thing[^6] of life.” The monks heard these people who were vexed, annoyed, angry. Those who were modest monks became vexed, annoyed, angry and said:

*BD.1.267* “How can the venerable Channa have a tree cut down that was used as a shrine, revered by village … revered by the kingdom?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:

“Is it true, as is said, Channa, that you had a tree cut down that was used as a shrine, revered by village … revered by the kingdom?”

“It is true, lord,” he said.

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:

“How can you, foolish man, have a tree cut down that was used as a shrine, revered by village … revered by the kingdom? For, foolish man, in a tree are people having consciousness as living beings. This is not, foolish man, for the benefit of unbelievers … Thus, monks, this course of training should be set forth:

“If there is a monk building a large[^7] _vihāra_ for his own advantage, having a benefactor, monks should be brought for marking out a site. A site should be marked out by these monks, not involving destruction, with an open space round it. If a monk should build a large _vihāra_ on a site involving destruction, not with an open space round it, or if he should not bring monks to mark out a site, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.”

* * *

*Bu-Ss.7.2.1* Large means: it is called a _vihāra_ having a benefactor.[^8]

Vihāra means: it is smeared inside or it is smeared outside or it is smeared inside and outside.[^9]

*BD.1.268* Building means: building or causing to be built.

Having a benefactor means: a certain person is the benefactor: a woman or a man or a householder or one who has gone forth.[^10]

For his own advantage means: for his own good.[^11]

Monks should be brought for marking out a site means: that monk building a _vihāra_, clearing the site for a _vihāra_ … see *Bu-Ss.6.2.2* … should say: ‘I, honoured sirs, am desirous of building a large _vihāra_, having a benefactor, for my own advantage; honoured sirs, I beg the Order to inspect the site for a _vihāra_ … this is called having an open space round it.

Large means: it is called a _vihāra_ having a benefector.

Vihāra means: it is smeared inside or it is smeared outside or it is smeared inside and outside.

Should build means: he builds or he causes to be built.

If he should not bring monks to mark out the site means: not having caused the site for a _vihāra_ to be marked out by a vote following directly upon the motion, he builds or causes to be built, *Vin.3.157* in each operation there is an offence of wrong-doing. If one lump (of plaster) is (still) to come, there is a grave offence; when that lump has come there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.[^12]

Offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order means: … on account of this it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.

* * *

*Bu-Ss.7.3.1* If a monk builds a _vihāra_, the site not having been marked out, involving destruction, not with an open space round it … _see_ *Bu-Ss.6.3.1*. _The sections which contain_ “exceeding the measure” _and_ “to (the right) measure” _are not repeated here_ … the site having been marked out, involving no destruction, with an open space round it, there is no offence.

* * *

*BD.1.269* *Bu-Ss.7.3.2* A monk commanded: “Build a _vihāra_ for me.” They built a _vihāra_ for him, the site not having been marked out, involving destruction, not with an open space round it … the site not having been marked out, not involving destruction, with an open space round it, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Ss.7.3.3* A monk having commanded: “Build a _vihāra_ for me,” went away. And he did not command: “Let there be marking out of the site, and let it not involve destruction, and let it have an open space round it.” They built a _vihāra_ for him, the site not having been marked out, involving destruction, not with an open space round it … the site having been marked out, not involving destruction, with an open space round it, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Ss.7.3.4* A monk having commanded: “Build a _vihāra_ for me,” went away. And he commanded: “Let there be marking out of the site, and not involving destruction, and with an open space round it.” They built the _vihāra_ for him, the site not having been marked out, involving destruction, not with an open space round it. He heard and said: “They say that a _vihāra_ was built for me, the site not having been marked out, involving destruction, not with an open space round it.” If this monk should go himself … there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Ss.7.3.5* A monk having commanded: “Build a _vihāra_ for me,” went away. And he commanded: “Let there be marking out of the site, and let it not involve destruction, and let there be an open space round it.” They built a _vihāra_ for him, the site not having been marked out, involving destruction, not with an open space round it. For the builders there are three offences of wrong-doing … the site marked out, not involving destruction, with an open space round it, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Ss.7.3.6* A monk having commanded: “Build a _vihāra_ for me,” went away. They built a _vihāra_ for him, the site *BD.1.270* not having been marked out, involving destruction, not with an open space round it. If he comes back there (and finds that it is) imperfectly executed … the site having been marked out, not involving destruction, with an open space round it, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Ss.7.3.7* If he finishes by himself what was imperfectly executed by himself … \= *Bu-Ss.6.3.15*–*Bu-Ss.6.3.16* … if he is a beginner.

Told is the Seventh Offence entailing a Formal Meeting of the Order: that of building a _vihāra_
