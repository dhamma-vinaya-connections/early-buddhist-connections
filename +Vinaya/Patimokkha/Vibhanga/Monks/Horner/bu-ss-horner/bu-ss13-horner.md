# Monks’ Formal Meeting (_Saṅghādisesa_) 13

*BD.1.314* *Bu-Ss.13.1.1* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Now at that time,[^1] unscrupulous, depraved monks who were the followers of Assaji and Punabbasu[^2] were in residence[^3] at Kiṭāgiri.[^4] They indulged in the following kinds of bad habits: they planted and caused to be planted small flowering trees; they watered them *Vin.3.180* and caused them to be watered; they plucked them and caused them to be plucked; they tied them up into (garlands) and caused them to be tied up; they made and caused to be made garlands having a stalk on one side[^5]; they made and caused to be made garlands having a stalk on both sides[^6]; they made and caused to be made a branching flower-stalk[^7]; they made and caused to be *BD.1.315* made a wreath[^8]; they made and caused to be made a garland worn round the forehead[^9]; they made and caused to be made an ear-ornament; they made and caused to be made a breast-plate.[^10] These (monks) take or send garlands having a stalk on one side to wives of reputable families, to daughters of reputable families, to girls of reputable families, to daughters-in-law of reputable families, to female slaves of reputable families. They take or send garlands having a stalk on both sides; they take or send a branching flower-stalk; they take or send a wreath; they take or send a garland worn round the forehead; they take or send an ear-ornament; they take or send a breast-plate. These eat from one dish together with wives of reputable families, with daughters of reputable families, with girls of reputable families, with daughters-in-law of reputable families, with female slaves of reputable families. They drink from one beaker; they sit down on one seat; they share[^11] one couch; they share one mat[^12]; they share one coverlet; they share one mat and coverlet. They eat at the wrong time; they drink intoxicants; they wear garlands, (use) perfumes and cosmetics; they dance and sing and play musical instruments, and they sport. They dance when she dances,[^13] they sing when she dances, they play musical instruments when she dances, they sport when she dances; they dance when she sings … they dance when she plays musical instruments … they dance when she sports … they sport when she sports.

* * *

*Bu-Ss.13.1.2* *BD.1.316* They play[^14] on a chequered board for gambling[^15]; they play on a draught-board[^16]; they play with imagining such boards in the air[^17]; they play a game of keeping stepping on to diagrams[^18]; they play with spillikans[^19]; they play at dice; they play tip-cat[^20]; they play brush-hand[^21]; they play with a ball[^22]; they play at blowing through toy-pipes made of leaves[^23]; they play with a toy plough[^24]; they play at turning somersaults[^25]; they play with a toy windmill[^26]; they play with a toy measures *BD.1.317* of leaves[^27]; they play with a toy cart[^28]; they play with a toy bow[^29]; they play a game of guessing at letters[^30]; they play a mind-reading game[^31]; they play a game of mimicking deformities[^32]; they train themselves in elephant lore[^33]; they train themselves in horse lore[^34]; they train themselves in cart lore; they train themselves in archery; they train themselves in swordsmanship; then they run in front of an elephant, they run in front of a horse and they run in front of a chariot; now they run backwards, now they run forwards,[^35] and they whistle,[^36] and they snap their fingers,[^37] and they wrestle,[^38] and they fight with fists, and having spread out their upper robes as *BD.1.318* a stage,[^39] they say to a dancing girl: “Dance here, sister,” and they applaud,[^40] and indulge in various bad habits.

* * *

*Bu-Ss.13.1.3* At one time a certain monk, rising up from spending the rains among the people of Kāsī, and going to Sāvatthī for the sake of seeing the lord, *Vin.3.181* arrived at Kiṭāgiri. Then this monk getting up early and taking his bowl and robe entered Kiṭāgiri for alms-food. He was pleasing whether he was approaching or departing, whether he was looking before or looking behind, whether he was drawing in or stretching out (his arm),[^41] his eyes were cast down, he was possessed of pleasant behaviour.[^42]

People seeing this monk, spoke thus:

“Who can this be like an idiot of idiots, like a fool of fools, like a very supercilious person?[^43] Who will go up to him and give him alms? Our masters, the followers of Assaji and Punabbasu are polite,[^44] genial, pleasant of speech, beaming with smiles, saying: ‘Come, you are welcome.’ They are not supercilious, they are easily accessible, they are the first to speak.[^45] Therefore alms should be given to these.”

A certain lay follower saw that monk wandering in Kiṭāgiri for alms; seeing that monk he approached him, and having approached and greeted him, he said:

“Honoured sir, are alms obtainable?”

*BD.1.319* “Alms are not obtainable, your reverence,” he said.

“Come, honoured sir, we will go to my house.”

*Bu-Ss.13.1.4* Then the lay follower having taken this monk to his house and made him eat, said:

“Where, honoured sir, will the master go?”

“I will go to Sāvatthī, your reverence, to see the lord,” he said.

“Then, honoured sir, in my name salute the lord’s feet with your head and say: ‘Lord, the residence at Kiṭāgiri has been corrupted. At Kiṭāgiri are residing unscrupulous, depraved monks who are the followers of Assaji and Punabbasu. These indulge in the following bad habits … they indulge in a variety of bad habits. Lord, those men who formerly had faith and were virtuous now have no faith and are not virtuous. Those who formerly were chaṇṇels for gifts[^46] to the Order are now cut off; they neglect the well-behaved monks, and the depraved monks stay on. It were good, lord, if the lord would send monks to Kiṭāgiri, so that this residence in Kiṭāgiri may be settled.”[^47]

* * *

*Bu-Ss.13.1.5* “Very well, your reverence,” and that monk having answered and rising up from his seat, departed for Sāvatthī. In due course he approached Sāvatthī, the Jeta Grove and Anāthapindika’s park and the lord; and having approached and greeted the lord, he sat down to one side. It is usual for enlightened ones, for lords, to exchange greetings with in-coming monks. So the lord said to this monk:

“I hope, monk, that it is going well with you, I hope that you are keeping going, I hope that you have accomplished your journey with but little fatigue. And where do you come from, monk?”

“Things go well, lord, I am keeping going, lord, and I, lord, *Vin.3.182* accomplished my journey with but little *BD.1.320* fatigue. Now, I, lord, having spent the rains among the people of Kāsī, and coming to Sāvatthī for the sake of seeing the lord, arrived at Kitāgiri. Then I, lord, rising up early, and taking my bowl and robe, entered Kitāgiri for alms-food. Then, lord, a certain lay follower saw me as I was wandering in Kitāgiri for alms-food, and seeing me he approached, and having approached and greeted me, he said: ‘Are alms obtainable, honoured sir?’ ‘No, your reverence, alms are not obtainable,’ I said. ‘Come, honoured sir, we will go to my house,’ he said. Then, lord, that lay follower, taking me to his house and feeding me, said: ‘Where, honoured sir, will the master go?’ I said: ‘Your reverence, I will go to Sāvatthī for the sake of seeing the lord.’ Then he said … ‘may be settled.’ Therefore, lord, do I come.”

* * *

*Bu-Ss.13.1.6* Then the lord, on that occasion, in that connection, having had the Order of monks convened, asked the monks:

“Monks, is it true as is said, that the monks who are followers of Assaji and Punabbasu, residing in Kitāgiri, are unscrupulous and depraved and indulge in the following bad habits: they plant small flowering trees … indulge in a variety of bad habits … and those men, monks … and the depraved monks stay on?”

“It is true, lord,” they said.

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can these foolish men indulge in this kind of bad habit, how can they plant small flowering trees or cause them to be planted? How can they water them or cause them to be watered? How can they pluck them or cause them to be plucked? How can they tie up garlands or cause them to be tied up? How can they make or cause to be made … How can they take or send … How can they eat … How can they drink … sit … stand … eat … drink … run … dance and sing and play musical *BD.1.321* instruments and sport … play … train themselves … run … run round facing … how can they whistle and snap their fingers and wrestle and fight with fists, and having spread out their upper robes as a stage, say to a nautch girl: ‘Dance here, sister,’ and applaud and indulge in a variety of bad habits? It is not, monks, for the benefit of unbelievers …” and having rebuked them and given them talk on _dhamma_, he addressed Sāriputta and Moggallāna:

“You go, Sāriputta[^48] and Moggallāna; and having gone to Kitāgiri make an act of banishment[^49] from Kiṭāgiri against those monks who are followers of Assaji and Punabbasu; these are fellow monks of yours.”[^50]

They said: “Lord, how can we *Vin.3.183* make an act of banishment from Kitāgiri against the monks who are followers of Assaji and Punabbasu? These monks are violent and rough.”

“Then, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, go together with many monks.”

“Very well, lord,” Sāriputta and Moggallāna answered the lord.

* * *

*Bu-Ss.13.1.7* “And this, monks, is how it should be done. First, the monks who are the followers of Assaji and Punabbasu should be reproved; having been reproved they should be reminded; having been reminded they should be accused of the offence; having been accused of the offence, the Order should be informed through an experienced, competent monk: ‘Let the Order listen to me, honoured sirs. These monks who are followers of *BD.1.322* Assaji and Punabbasu are those who bring a family into disrepute, they are of evil conduct; their evil conduct is seen and also heard, and respectable families corrupted by them are seen and also heard. If it seems the right time for the Order, let the Order make an act of banishment from Kiṭāgiri against the monks who are the followers of Assaji and Punabbasu, so that the monks who are the followers of Assaji and Punabbasu may not be in Kiṭāgiri. This is the motion. Let the Order listen to me, honoured sirs. These monks who are … seen and also heard. The Order issues an act of banishment from Kiṭāgiri against the monks who are followers of Assaji and Punabbasu so that the monks who are followers of Assaji and Punabbasu may not be in Kiṭāgiri. If it seems good to the venerable ones to make an act of banishment from Kiṭāgiri against the monks who are followers of Assaji and Punabbasu so that the monks who are the followers of Assaji and Punabbasu may not be in Kiṭāgiri, then be silent; if it does not seem good (to you) then you should speak. A second time I speak forth this matter … And a third time do I speak forth this matter: Let the Order listen to me … should speak. By the Order there has been made an act of banishment from Kiṭāgiri against the monks who are followers of Assaji and Punabbasu so that the monks who are followers of Assaji and Punabbasu may not be in Kiṭāgiri. If it seems good to the Order, then be silent; so do I understand.’”

* * *

*Bu-Ss.13.1.8* Then[^51] Sāriputta and Moggallāna, at the head of a company of monks, having gone to Kiṭāgiri made an act of banishment from Kiṭāgiri against the monks who were followers of Assaji and Punabbasu, so that the monks who were followers of Assaji and Punabbasu might not be in Kiṭāgiri. The act of banishment having been made by the Order, these did not conduct them *BD.1.323* selves properly,[^52] nor did they become subdued,[^53] nor did they mend their ways,[^54] they did not ask the monks for forgiveness,[^55] they cursed them,[^56] they reviled them,[^57] they offended by following a wrong course through desire, by following a wrong course through hatred, by following a wrong course through stupidity, by following a wrong course through fear[^58]; and they went away, and they left the Order.[^59]

Those who were modest monks became angry … and annoyed, and said: “How can the monks who are followers of Assaji and Punabbasu, banished by the *BD.1.324* Order, not conduct themselves properly, not become subdued, not mend their ways? *Vin.3.184* Why do they not ask for forgiveness from the monks? Why do they curse and revile them? Why do they, following a wrong course through desire, hatred, stupidity and fear, go away and leave the Order?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord.[^60]

He asked: “Is it true as is said, monks, that the monks who are the followers of Assaji and Punabbasu, having been banished by the Order, do not conduct themselves properly … leave the Order?”

“It is true, lord,” they said.

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying …“And thus, monks, this course of training should be set forth:

If a monk lives depending on a certain village or little town, and is one who brings a family into disrepute and is of depraved conduct, and if his evil conduct is seen and heard, and families corrupted by him are seen and also heard, let that monk be spoken to thus by the monks: ‘The venerable one is one who brings families into disrepute, and is of depraved conduct. The venerable one’s depraved doings are seen and heard, and families corrupted by the venerable one are seen and also heard. Let the venerable one depart from this residence; you have lived here long enough.’ And if this monk having been spoken to thus by the monks should say to these monks: ‘The monks are followers of desire and the monks are followers of hatred and the monks are followers of stupidity and the monks are followers of fear; they banish some for such an offence, they do not banish others’—this monk should be spoken to thus by the monks: ‘Venerable one, do not speak thus. The monks are not followers of desire and the monks are not followers of hatred and the monks are not followers of stupidity and the monks are not followers *BD.1.325* of fear. The venerable one is one who brings families into disrepute and is of depraved conduct. The depraved doings of the venerable one are seen and heard, and families corrupted by the venerable one are seen and also heard. Let the venerable one depart from this residence; the venerable one has dwelt in this residence long enough.’ If this monk, when spoken to thus by the monks, should persist as before, that monk should be admonished up to three times by the monks for giving up his course. If after being admonished up to three times, he gives up that course, it is good. If he does not give it up, it is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.”

* * *

*Bu-Ss.13.2.1* A monk (is dependent on) a certain village or a little town means: a village and a little town and a city, and thus a village and a little town.

Lives depending on means: there they are dependent for the requisites of robes, alms-food, lodgings and medicine for the sick.

A family means: there are four kinds of families: a noble family, a brahmin *Vin.3.185* family, a merchant family, a low-caste family.[^61]

One who brings a family into disrepute means: he brings families into disrepute by means of a flower[^62] or a fruit[^63] or with chunam or clay or with a toothpick or with bamboo or with medical treatment[^64] or with going messages on foot.[^65]

*BD.1.326* Of depraved conduct means: he plants or causes to be planted a little flowering tree; he waters it and causes it to be watered; he plucks it and causes it to be plucked; he ties up garlands and causes them to be tied up.

Are seen and also heard means: those who are face to face with them see; those who are absent hear.

Families corrupted by him means: formerly they had faith, now thanks to him they are without faith; having been virtuous, now they are without virtue.

Are seen and also heard means: those who are face to face with them see; those who are absent hear.

That monk means: that monk who brings a family into disrepute.

By the monks means: by other monks; these see, these hear; it should be said by these: ‘The venerable one is one who brings families into disrepute and is of depraved conduct; the venerable one’s depraved conduct … has lived here long enough.’ And if the monk being spoken to thus by the monks should say: ‘… they do not banish others’.

This monk means: this monk against whom proceedings have been taken.

By the monks means: by other monks; these see, these hear; it should be said by these: ‘Do not, venerable one, speak thus … the venerable one has lived here long enough.’ A second time should they say … A third time should they say … if he gives up the course that is good; if he does not give it up it is an offence of wrong-doing. If, having heard, they do not speak, there is an offence of wrong-doing. That monk having been drawn into the middle of the Order, should be told: ‘Do not, venerable one, speak thus … you have lived here long enough.’ A second time he should be told … A third time he should be told … if he gives up his course it is good, but if he does not give it up there is an offence of wrong-doing.

That monk should be admonished. The Order should be informed through an experienced, competent monk: ‘Let the Order listen to me, honoured sirs. This monk, *BD.1.327* so and so banished by an act of the order, makes the monks fall into wrong courses by following desire, by following hatred, by following confusion, by following fear; and he does not give up his course. If it seems the right time to the Order, let the Order admonish this monk for the sake of giving up his course. This is the motion. Let the Order listen to me … Thus do I understand.’

According to the motion there is an offence of wrong-doing … grave offences subside.

An offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order means: the Order places him on probation on account of his offence, it sends him back to the beginning, it inflicts the _mānatta_ discipline, it rehabilitates; it is not many people, it is not *Vin.3.186* one man, therefore it is called an offence which in the earlier as well as in the later stages requires a formal meeting of the Order. A synonym for this class of offence is a work; therefore, again, it is called an offence which in the earlier as well as in the later stages entails a formal meeting of the Order.[^66]

* * *

*Bu-Ss.13.3.1* Thinking a legally valid act to be a legally valid act, he does not give it up—there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. Being in doubt as to whether it is a legally valid act … Not thinking an act which is legally valid to be an act which is not legally valid, is an offence of wrong-doing.[^67]

* * *

*Bu-Ss.13.3.2* It is not an offence if he is not admonished, if he gives it up, if he is mad, if he is a beginner.

* * *

Told is the Thirteenth Offence entailing a Formal meeting of the Order: that of bringing families into disrepute

* * *

*BD.1.328* The thirteen matters which require a formal meeting of the Order have been set down, venerable ones—nine which become offences at once,[^68] and four which are not completed until the third admonition.[^69]

If a monk offends against one or other of these, for as many days as he knowingly conceals his offence,[^70] for so many days should probation be spent by this monk, even against his will.[^71] When this monk has spent his probation, a further six days are to be allowed for the monk’s _mānatta_ discipline. If, when the monk has performed the _mānatta_ discipline, the company of monks numbers twenty, that monk may be rehabilitated.[^72] But if the Order of monks should rehabilitate that monk when numbering less than twenty even by one, that monk is not rehabilitated and these monks are blameworthy. This is the proper course there. Now I ask the venerable ones: I hope that you are pure in this matter?[^73] A second time I ask: I hope that you are pure in this matter? A third time I ask: I hope that you are pure in this matter? The venerable ones are pure in this matter, therefore they are silent. Thus do I understand.[^74]

* * *

Told are the thirteen.

##### The summary of this is:

Emission and bodily contact;  
lewd talk and one’s own pleasure,  
Acting as a go-between; and a hut, and a _vihāra_;  
without foundation,  
*BD.1.329* And some point, and a schism, even siding in with,  
Difficult to speak to, and bringing a family into disrepute—  
these are the thirteen offences entailing a formal meeting of the Order.

Told are the thirteen sections *Vin.3.187*
