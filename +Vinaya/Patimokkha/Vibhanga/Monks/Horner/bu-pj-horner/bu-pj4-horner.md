# Monks’ Expulsion (_Pārājika_) 4

## Origin story

### First sub-story

*BD.1.151* *Bu-Pj.4.1.1* *Vin.3.87* *MS.534* At one time[^1] the Buddha, the Master, was staying near Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. At that time a number of monks who were friends had entered the rains on the banks of the river Vaggumudā.[^2] Just then Vajjī was short of food[^3] and stricken by hunger, with crops blighted and turned to straw, and it was not easy to keep oneself going by collecting alms. Then those monks thought this:

“At present Vajjī is short of food and stricken by hunger, with crops blighted and turned to straw, and it is not easy to keep oneself going by collecting alms. By what means might we, united and in harmony, have a comfortable rains and get almsfood without problems?”

*MS.535* Some said, “Well, friends, we could undertake work for the householders, and they will give something in return. In this way, being united and in harmony, we will spend the rains in comfort and have no problems getting almsfood.”

*MS.536* Some said, “Friends, there is no need to undertake work for the householders. Let us instead act as messengers for them,[^4] *BD.1.152* and they will give something in return. In this way, being united and in harmony, we will spend the rains in comfort and have no problems getting almsfood.”

*MS.537* Some said, “Friends, there is no need to undertake work for the householders, nor to act as messengers for them. Let us instead praise one anotherʼs super-human achievements[^5] to the householders: ʻSuch a monk obtains the first _jhāna_, such a monk the second _jhāna_, such a monk the third, such a monk the fourth; such a monk is stream-enterer, such a monk a once-returner, such a non-returner, such an _arahant_; such a monk has the three true knowledges,[^6] and such the six direct knowledges.ʼ[^7] Then they will give to us. In this way, being united *Vin.3.88* and in harmony, we will spend the rains in comfort and have no problems getting almsfood. Indeed, friends, this is the better way, that we praise one anotherʼs super-human achievements to the householders.”

*MS.538* Then those monks praised one anotherʼs super-human achievements to the householders: “Such a monk obtains the first _jhāna_ … such a monk has the six direct knowledges.” And those people thought: “It is a gain for us, it is well-gained, that such monks have come to us for the rains. Such monks as these, who are virtuous *BD.1.153* and of good character, have never before entered the rains with us.” Then they gave such food and drink to those monks that they did not even eat and drink themselves, or give to their parents, to their wives and children, to their slaves, servants and workers, to their friends and companions, or to their relatives. In this way those monks were handsome, with rounded features, bright faces and clear skin.[^8]

*Bu-Pj.4.1.2* *MS.539* Now it was the custom[^9] for monks who had finished keeping the rains to go and see the Master. So when the rains was finished and the three months had elapsed, those monks put their lodging in order,[^10] took their bowls and robes and departed for Vesālī. Walking by stages, they arrived at Vesālī and went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. There they approached the Master, paid homage to him and sat down to one side.

*MS.540* At that time the monks who had spent the rains in that region were thin, *BD.1.154* haggard[^11] and pale,[^12] their veins protruding all over their limbs.[^13] But the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā were handsome, with rounded features, bright faces and clear skin. It is the custom for Buddhas, for Masters, to exchange friendly greetings with incoming monks.[^14] And so the Master said to them:

“I hope you are keeping well,[^15] monks, I hope you are comfortable; I hope you spent the rains at ease, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and that you had no trouble getting almsfood?”

“We are keeping well, Master,[^16] we are comfortable; we spent the rains at ease, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and we had no trouble getting alsmfood.”

Tathāgatas sometimes ask knowing, *Vin.3.89* and knowing sometimes do not ask … Buddhas, Masters, question the monks for two reasons, thinking, “we shall teach the _Dhamma_ or lay down a training rule for the disciples.”[^17] Then the Master said to those monks:

*MS.541* “In what way, monks, did you spent the rains at ease, without having any trouble getting almsfood?” Then those monks informed the Master.

“But had you really obtained those super-human achievements?”[^18]

“No, Master.”

The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them:

“It is unsuitable, foolish men, it is not becoming, *BD.1.155* it is not proper, it is not fitting for a recluse, it is unallowable, it is not to be done. How could you for the sake of your stomachs praise one anotherʼs super-human achievements to householders? It would be better for your bellies to be cut open with a sharp butcherʼs knife than for you to praise one anotherʼs super-human achievements to householders. Why is that? For _that_ reason, foolish men, you may incur death or death-like suffering, but not on that account would you at the breaking up of the body after death be reborn in the plane of misery, a bad destination, the abyss, hell.[^19] But for _this_ reason you might. This is not for the benefit of non-believers …” and having thus rebuked them and given a talk on the _Dhamma_, he addressed the monks:

*Bu-Pj.4.1.3* *MS.542* “Monks, there are these five great gangsters to be found in the world.[^20] What five? A[^21] certain great gangster thinks like this: ʻWhen indeed will I, with a following of a hundred or a thousand men, wander among villages, towns and the seats of kings, killing and making others kill, destroying and making others destroy, tormenting and making others torment;ʼ and after some time he does just that. Just so, monks, a certain bad monk thinks like this: ʻWhen indeed will I, with a following of a hundred or a thousand people, go on tour among villages, towns and the seats of kings, being honoured, respected, revered and worshipped by both householders and those *BD.1.156* gone forth, and obtain robes, almsfood, lodgings and medicines;ʼ and after some time he does *Vin.3.90* just that. This is the first great gangster found existing in the world.

*MS.543* Again, a certain bad monk learns the _Dhamma_ and training proclaimed by the Tathāgata and takes it as his own. This is the second great gangster found existing in the world.

*MS.544* Again, a certain bad monk groundlessly accuses someone who lives the spiritual life in purity of not being celibate.[^22] This is the third great gangster found existing in the world.

*MS.545* Again, a certain bad monk takes valuable goods and requisites belonging to the Sangha—a monastery, the land of a monastery, a dwelling, the land for a dwelling, a bed, a bench, a cushion, a pillow, a brass vessel, a brass jar, a brass pot, a brass receptacle, an adze, a hatchet, an axe, a spade, a chisel, a creeper, bamboo, _muñja_\-grass, _babbaja_\-grass, _tiṇa_\-grass, clay, wooden articles, earthenware articles[^23]—and uses these to win over and create a following among householders. This is the fourth great gangster found existing in the world.

*BD.1.157* *MS.546* But in this world with its gods, its lords of death and its supreme beings, among this population with its recluses and brahmins, its gods and humans, this the greatest gangster: he who untruthfully[^24] and groundlessly[^25] boasts about a super-human achievement. Why is that? Monks, you have eaten the countryʼs almsfood by theft.”

> *MS.547* Whoever should declare himself to be other than he truly is,  
>   
> Has eaten this by theft, like a cheater who has deceived,
> 
> *MS.548* Many[^26] yellow-necks of bad qualities, uncontrolled and  
>   
> Wicked, by their wicked deeds, in hell they are reborn.
> 
> *MS.549* Better to eat an iron ball heated like a blazing fire,  
>   
> Than for the immoral and uncontrolled to eat the countryʼs alms.

*MS.550* Then the Master, having rebuked the monks from the banks of the Yaggumudā in various ways for being difficult to maintain, difficult to support … “… And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:

### Preliminary ruling

*MS.551* If a monk falsely claims for himself a super-human achievement, knowledge *BD.1.158* and vision[^27] worthy of the noble ones, saying: “this I know, this I see”, but after some time—whether examined or not, but having committed the offence[^28] and desiring purification—should say, ʻfriends, not knowing I said that I know, *Vin.3.91* not seeing that I see; what I said was empty and false,ʼ he too is expelled and not in communion.”

*MS.552* Thus the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.

### Second sub-story

*Bu-Pj.4.2.1* *MS.553* At one time a number of monks, thinking they had seen what they had not, attained what they had not, achieved what they had not, realised what they had not, declared final knowledge[^29] based on overestimation.[^30] After some time their minds inclined[^31] to sense desire, anger and confusion. They became anxious, thinking, “The Master has laid down a training rule; yet we … declared final knowledge based on overestimation. Could it be that we have fallen into an offence entailing expulsion? They informed Venerable Ānanda, who informed the Master. He said: “Ānanda, these monks declared final knowledge *BD.1.159* based on overestimation, thinking they had seen what they had not … but this is negligible.[^32]

*MS.554* And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:

## Final ruling

*MS.555* If a monk falsely claims for himself a super-human achievement, knowledge and insight worthy of the noble ones, saying: “This I know, this I see,” but after some time—whether examined or not, but having committed the offence and desiring purification—should say, ʻfriends, not knowing I said that I know, not seeing that I see; what I said was empty and false,ʼ except if it is through overestimation, he too is expelled and not in communion.”

## Definitions

*MS.556* *Bu-Pj.4.3.1* A means: whoever, of such kind …

Monk means: … this sort of monk is meant in this case.

*MS.557* Falsely means: although a certain wholesome quality is non-existent, not factual, not to be found in himself, and he does not see it or know it, he says, “I have this wholesome quality.”

*MS.558* A super-human achievement means: _jhāna_, emancipation, _samādhi_, attainment, knowledge and insight, development of the path,[^33] realisation of the fruits, abandoning the defilements, a mind without hindrances, delighting in solitude.

*MS.559* For himself means: either he presents these good qualities as in himself, or he presents himself as among these good qualities.

*MS.560* Knowledge means: the three true knowledges.

Insight means: knowledge and insight are equivalent.[^34]

*Vin.3.92* *MS.561* If (he) claims means: if he proclaims to a woman or a man, to a householder or one gone forth.

*MS.562* This I know, this I see means: “I know these qualities, *BD.1.160* I see these qualities; these qualities are in me, and I conform to these qualities.”

*MS.563* After some time means: the moment, the second, the instant when the claim is completed.

*MS.564* Examined means: he is examined in regard to what he has acknowledged: “What was attained by you, how was it attained by you, when was it attained by you, where was it attained by you? Which defilements have you destroyed? Which qualities did you gain?”

*MS.565* Not means: nothing being said.

*MS.566* Having committed the offence means: having bad desires, being habitually desirous, claiming a non-existent, non-factual super-human achievement, he has committed an offence entailing expulsion.

*MS.567* Desiring purification means: he desires to be a householder, a lay follower, a monastery attendant or a _sāmaṇera_.[^35]

*MS.568* Friends, not knowing I said that I know, not seeing that I see means: “I do not know these qualities, I do not see these qualities; these qualities are not found in me, and I do not conform to these qualities.”

*MS.569* What I said was empty and false, means: what I said was empty, what I said was false, what I said was untruthful;[^36] I said it without knowing.

*MS.570* Except if it is through overestimation means: setting aside overestimaton of oneself.

*MS.571* He too means: this is said with reference to the preceding offences entailing expulsion.

*MS.572* Is expelled means: just as a palm tree with the crown cut off is incapable[^37] of further growth, *BD.1.161* just so a monk with bad desires, who is habitually desirous, having claimed a non-existent, non-factual super-human achievement, is not a recluse, not a son of the Sakyan[^38]—he is therefore called one who is expelled.

*MS.573* Not in communion means: communion means: a common official action, the same recital, the same training—this is called communion. He does not take part in this—he is therefore called not in communion.

“Yes, friend,” Venerable Lakkhaṇa replied.

*MS.743* Then, *Vin.3.105* as he was descending from Mount Vultureʼs Peak, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna smiled at a certain place. Venerable Lakkhaṇa said to him: “Friend, why are you smiling?”

“This is not the right time, friend, for this question. Ask me in the presence of the Master.”

*Bu-Pj.4.9.2* *MS.744* Then, after their meal and after returning from alms-round, Venerable Lakkhaṇa and Venerable Mahāmoggallāna approached the Master and sat down to one side. Venerable Lakkhaṇa then said to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna:

“Just now, as the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was descending from Mount Vultureʼs Peak, he smiled at a certain place. Why, friend, did you smile?”

“As I was coming down from *BD.1.182* Mount Vultureʼs Peak, I saw a skeleton flying through the air,[^77] and vultures, crows and hawks[^78] were in close pursuit, striking it[^79] between the ribs,[^80] while it uttered cries of distress. Then, friend, I thought how amazing and astounding it is that such a being should exist, such a spirit, such a state of existence.”[^81]

The monks criticized and denounced him: “Venerable Mahāmoggallāna is claiming a super-human achievement.”[^82]

*MS.745* Then the Master addressed the monks:

Monks, there are disciples who possess vision and knowledge,[^83] such that they can see, know and witness such a thing. Previously I too have seen that being, but I didnʼt speak about it. If I had, others would not have believed me and that would have been for their harm and suffering for long time. *BD.1.183* That being, monks, was a cattle butcher[^84] in this very Rājagaha. As a result of his deeds he was tormented[^85] in hell for many years, for many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years, for many hundreds of thousands of years. And now, because of the remaining result of his actions, he is experiencing such a state of existence. Moggallāna spoke truly. There is no offence for Moggallāna.”[^86]

“Monks, that being was a slanderer in this very Rājagaha. …”

* * *

*MS.754* “As I was coming down … I saw a man who had testicles like pots[^94] flying through the air.

* * *

*MS.757* “As I was coming down … I saw a flayed woman flying through the air. Vultures … were pulling her to pieces, while she uttered cries of distress …”

Then, friend, I thought how amazing and astounding it is that such a being should exist, such a spirit, such a state of existence.”

The monks criticised and denounced him: “Venerable Moggallāna is claiming a super-human achievement.”[^103]

*MS.763* Then the Master addressed the monks:

“Monks, there are disciples who possess *BD.1.188* vision and knowledge *Vin.3.108* such that they can see, know and witness such a thing. Previously, monks, I too have seen this novice nun, but I did not speak about it. If I had, others would not have believed me and that would have been for their harm and suffering for long time. During the time of Buddha Kassapaʼs dispensation, that novice nun was a bad novice nun. As a result of her deeds, she was tormented in hell for many years, for many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years, for many hundreds of thousands of years. And now, because of the remaining result of her actions, she is experiencing such a state of existence. Moggallāna spoke truly. There is no offence for Moggallāna.”

*Bu-Pj.4.9.4* Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the monks:

*MS.764* “Friends, this stream the Tapodā flows from a lake with beautiful water—cool, sweat and pure—with lovely and charming fords, with an abundance of fishes and turtles, and with blooming lotuses the size of wheels. And yet the Tapodā is hot.”

The monks criticised and denounced him: “How can the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna say, ʻFriends, this stream the Tapodā flows from a lake of beautiful water … And yet this Tapodā is hot.ʼ Venerable Mahāmoggallāna is claiming a super-human achievement.” And they informed the Master.

“Monks, the Tapodā flows from a lake of beautiful water … with blooming lotuses the size of wheels. But the Tapodā runs between the two great hells,[^104] that is why it is *BD.1.189* hot. Moggallāna spoke truly. There is no offence for Moggallāna.”

Then the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the monks: “Friends, the king was defeated by the Licchavis.”

The monks criticised and denounced him: “How can Venerable Moggallāna say, ʻFriends, the king was defeated by the Licchavis,ʼ when delight about the battle is spreading about thus: ʻThe Licchavis were defeated by the king!ʼ The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna is claiming a super-human achievement.” They informed the Master.

The monks criticised and denounced him: “How can Venerable Mahāmoggallāna say *BD.1.190* such a thing. He is claiming a super-human achievement.” They informed the Master.

“Monks, there is such a _samādhi_, but it is not wholly purified.[^107] Moggallāna spoke truly. There is no offence for Moggallāna.”

* * *

*Bu-Pj.4.9.7* *MS.767* Then the Venerable Sobhita[^108] addressed the monks: “Friends, I can recall five hundred eons.”

The monks criticised and denounced him: “How can Venerable Sobhita say, ʻI can recall five hundred eonsʼ? He is claiming a super-human achievement.” They informed the Master.

“Monks, Sobhita has this ability, and that was just one birth. Sobhita spoke truly. There is no offence for Sobhita.”

*MS.768* The fourth offence entailing expulsion is finished.

*MS.769* Venerables, the four rules entailing expulsion have been recited. If a monk commits any one of them, he is no longer in communion with the monks. As before,[^109] so after, he is expelled and not *BD.1.191* in communion. In regard to this I ask the Venerable ones: are you pure in this? A second time I ask: are you pure in this? A third time I ask: are you pure in this? The Venerable ones are pure in this and therefore silent. I will remember it thus.

*MS.772* Sexual intercourse, stealing, person, super,  
  
the four offences entailing expulsion, the foundation is cut[^110] without a doubt.

*MS.7730* The chapter on offences entailing expulsion is finished. *Vin.3.110*
