# Monks’ Expulsion (_Pārājika_) 1

Homage to the Master, the _Arahant_, the truly Awakened One

## The origin of the Vinaya

*BD.1.1* *Bu-Pj.1.1.1* *Vin.3.1* *MS.2* At one time the[^1] Buddha, the Master, was staying at Verañjā[^2] near Naḷeruʼs Nimba tree[^3] with a great Sangha of five hundred monks. Now a brahmin[^4] of Verañjā was told:

“Sir[^5], the recluse[^6] Gotama, the Sakyan,*†* having gone forth from the Sakyan clan, is staying at Verañjā near Naleruʼs Nimba tree with a great Sangha of five hundred monks. That Master Gotama has acquired a good reputaton,[^8] thus:

ʻHe is indeed a Master, an _arahant_, fully awakened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the worlds, unrivalled trainer of tamable people, teacher of gods and humans, the Awakened *BD.1.2* One, the Master. Having realised with his own direct knowledge this world with its gods, its lords of death and its supreme beings, this population with its recluses and brahmins, its gods and humans, he makes it known to others. He teaches a _Dhamma_ that is good in the beginning, good in the middle and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals a perfectly complete and pure spiritual life.ʼ Good indeed it is to see such _arahants_.”[^9]

*Bu-Pj.1.1.2* *MS.3* Then the brahmin of Verañjā approached the Master, exchanged friendly greetings with him and sat down *Vin.3.2* to one side.*†* He then said this to the Master:

“I have heard, good[^11] Gotama, that the recluse Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are worn, old, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage;[^12] nor that he stands up for them or offers them a seat. This is indeed so, for the good[^13] Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are worn, old, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat. This, good Gotama, is not proper.”[^14]

*MS.4* “Brahmin, in the world with its gods, its lords of death and its supreme beings, in this population with its recluses and brahmins, its gods and humans, I do not see one to whom I should pay homage, for whom I should rise up or to whom I should offer a seat. For if the Tathāgata *BD.1.3* should pay homage to anyone, rise up for him or offer him a seat, his head might even split asunder.”[^15]

*Bu-Pj.1.1.3* *MS.5* “The revered[^16] Gotama lacks taste.”[^17]

“There is indeed, brahmin, a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama lacks taste.ʼ For tastes for forms, sounds, scents, flavours, and tangible objects—these have been destroyed by the Tathāgata, cut off at the root, made like a palm-stump, so utterly done away with that they are incapable of future arising. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama lacks taste.ʼ But that is not what you meant.”

*MS.6* “The revered Gotama is without enjoyment.”[^18]

“There is indeed, brahmin, a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is without enjoyment.ʼ For enjoyments of forms, sounds, scents, flavours, and tangible objects—these have been destroyed by the Tathāgata, cut off at the root, made like a palm-stump, so utterly done away with that they are incapable of future arising. *BD.1.4* This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is without enjoyment.ʼ But that is not what you meant.”

*MS.7* “The revered Gotama professes the doctrine of non-action.”[^19]

“There is indeed, brahmin, a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama professes the doctrine of non-action.ʼ For I teach the non-doing of misconduct by body, speech and mind. I teach the non-doing of manifold bad unwholesome actions. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama professes the doctrine of non-action.ʼ But that is not what you meant.”

*MS.8* “The revered Gotama professes the doctrine of annihilation.”[^20]

“There is indeed, brahmin, a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama professes the doctrine of annihilation.ʼ For I speak of the annihilation of sense desire, anger and confusion;[^21] I speak of the annihilation of manifold bad unwholesome qualities. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama professes the doctrine of annihilation.ʼ *Vin.3.3* But that is not what you meant.”

*MS.9* “The revered Gotama is one who detests.”[^22]

“There is indeed, brahmin, a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is one who detests.ʼ For I detest misconduct by *BD.1.5* body, speech and mind, and the acquisition[^23] of manifold bad unwholesome qualities. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is one who detests.ʼ But that is not what you meant.”

*MS.10* “The revered Gotama is a disciplinarian.”[^24]

“There is indeed, brahmin, a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is a disciplinarian.ʼ For I teach the _Dhamma_ for the disciplining of sense desire, anger and confusion; I teach the _Dhamma_ for the disciplining of manifold bad unwholesome qualities. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is a disciplinarian.ʼ But that is not what you meant.”

*MS.11* “The revered Gotama is one who practises austerities.”[^25]

“There is indeed, brahmin, a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is one who practises austerities.ʼ For I say that bad unwholesome qualities—misconduct by body, speech and mind—are to be burned up.[^26] He who has destroyed the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be burned up, who has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm-stump, done away with them so utterly that they are incapable of future arising—him I call one who practises austerities. The Tathāgata has destroyed the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be burned up, *BD.1.6* has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm tree, done away with them so utterly that they are incapable of future arising. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is one who practises austerities.ʼ But that is not what you meant.”

*MS.12* “The revered Gotama is withdrawn.”*†*[^28]

“There is indeed, brahmin, a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is withdrawn.ʼ He whose future conception in a womb, whose rebirth in a future life, is destroyed and cut off at the root, made like a palm-stump, so utterly done away with that it is incapable of future arising—him I call one who is withdrawn. The Tathāgataʼs future conception in a womb, his rebirth in a future life, is destroyed and cut off at the root, made like a palm-stump, so utterly done away with that he is incapable of future arising. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is withdrawn.ʼ But that is not what you meant.”

*Bu-Pj.1.1.4* *MS.13* “Brahmin, suppose there was a hen[^29] with eight or ten or twelve eggs, which she had properly covered, properly warmed and properly incubated. Is the first chick that hatches safely—having pierced through the egg-shell with the point of the claw on its foot, or with its beak—to be called the eldest or the youngest?”

“He is to be called the eldest, good Gotama, for he is the eldest of those.”

“Even so, brahmin, in this generation without understanding, being like an egg, *Vin.3.4* covered over, I *BD.1.7* alone[^30] in the world have split the eggshell of ignorance and reached the unsurpassed full awakening. I, brahmin, am the worldʼs eldest[^31] and best.[^32]

*Bu-Pj.1.1.5* *MS.14* “Brahmin,[^33] I was firmly energetic and had clarity of mindfulness; my body was tranquil and my mind unified. Fully secluded from the five senses, secluded from unwholesome mental qualities, I entered and remained in the first _jhāna_, which consists of rapture and happiness born of seclusion, accompanied by movement of the mind. Through the stilling of the movement of the mind, I entered and remained in the second _jhāna_, which has internal confidence and unification of mind[^34] and consists of rapture and happiness born of _samādhi_. Through the fading away of rapture, I remained even-minded, mindful and clearly comprehending, experiencing happiness directly, and I entered and remained in the third _jhāna_ of which the noble one declare, ʻhe is even-minded, mindful, and abides in happiness.ʼ Through the abandoning of happiness and suffering and the earlier ending of joy and displeasure,[^35] I entered and remained in the fourth _jhāna_, which has neither suffering nor happiness and consists of purity of mindfulness and even-mindedness.[^36]

*Bu-Pj.1.1.6* *MS.15* Then with the mind collected, clarified, purified, flawless, void of taints, grown soft and pliable, steady and *BD.1.8* imperturbable,[^37] I directed it[^38] to the knowledge of the memory of former lives. I recollected many past lives, that is to say, one birth,[^39] two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, and many eons of world dissolution, many eons of world evolution,[^40] and many eons of both dissolution and evolution: “There I had such a name, such a family, such appearance,[^41] such food, such experience of happiness and suffering, and such a life-span. Passing away from there I was reborn elsewhere, and there I had such a name … and such a life-span. Passing away from there I was reborn here. Thus I recollected many past lives with their characteristics and particulars.” This was the first knowledge attained by me in the first watch of that night;[^42] ignorance was dispelled, understanding arose, darkness was dispelled, light arose, as it is for one who remains heedful, ardent and energetic.[^43] This, brahmin, was my first *BD.1.9* successful breaking forth like a chickʼs from the eggshell.

*Bu-Pj.1.1.7* *MS.16* Then with the mind collected, clarified, purified, flawless, void of taints, grown soft and pliable, steady and imperturbable, I directed it to the knowledge of the arising and passing away of beings. *Vin.3.5* With the purified divine eye surpassing that of humans, I saw beings passing away and getting reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, gone to good destinations[^44] and bad destinations,[^45] and I understood how beings fare according to their kamma: ʻThese beings[^46] who engaged in misconduct by body, speech and mind, who abused the noble ones, held wrong view and acted accordingly,[^47] at the breaking up of the body after death, have arisen in the plane of misery, a bad destination, the abyss, hell. But these beings who engaged in good conduct of body, speech and mind, who did not abuse the noble ones, held right view and acted accordingly, at the breaking up of the body after death, have arisen in a good destination, a heaven world. Thus with the purified divine eye surpassing that of humans, I saw beings passing away and getting reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, gone to good destinations and bad destinations, and I understood how beings fare according to their kamma.[^48] This was the second knowledge attained by me in the middle watch of that night. Ignorance was dispelled, understanding arose, darkness was dispelled, light arose, as it is for one who remains heedful, ardent and energetic. This, brahmin, was my second successful breaking forth, like a chickʼs from the eggshell.

*Bu-Pj.1.1.8* *MS.17* Then[^49] with the mind collected, clarified, purified, *BD.1.10* flawless, void of taints, grown soft and pliable, steady and imperturbable, I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the corruptions. I knew according to reality: This is suffering, this is the arising of suffering, this is the ending of suffering, this is the course leading to the ending of suffering. I knew according to reality: These are the corruptions, this is the arising of the corruptions, this is the ending of the corruptions, this is the course leading to the ending of the corruptions. When I knew and saw this, my mind was freed from the corruption of sense desire, my mind was freed from the corruption of existence, my mind was freed from the corruption of false views, my mind was freed from the corruption of ignorance.[^50] When it was freed, I knew,[^51] “It is freed,” and I understood that birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, the job has been done, there is no further state of existence.[^52] This was the third knowledge attained by me in the third watch of that night. Ignorance was dispelled, understanding arose, darkness was dispelled, light arose, as it is for one who remains heedful, ardent and energetic.[^53] This, brahmin, was *Vin.3.6* my third successful breaking forth, like a chickʼs from the eggshell.”

*Bu-Pj.1.1.9* *MS.18* When this had been said, the brahmin of Verañjā said to the Master:

“Good Gotama is the eldest; good Gotama is the best. Wonderful, good Gotama, wonderful. As one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what had been hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes might see forms—even so has the good *BD.1.11* Gotama made the _Dhamma_ clear in many ways. To good[^54] Gotama I go for refuge, and to the _Dhamma_ and to the Sangha of monks. May the good Gotama accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.[^55] May the good Gotama consent to spend the rains at Verañjā together with the Sangha of monks.” The Master consented by silence. Then the brahmin of Verañjā, understanding that the Master had consented, rose from his seat, paid homage to him and departed, keeping his right side towards him.

* * *

*Bu-Pj.1.2.1* *MS.19* At that time Verañjā[^56] was short of food[^57] and stricken by hunger, with crops blighted and turned to straw. It was not easy to keep oneself going[^58] by collecting alms. Just then some horse-dealers from Uttarāpathaka[^59] entered *BD.1.12* the rains residence at Verañjā with five hundred horses. In the horse-pen[^60] they prepared _pattha_ measure after _pattha_ measure of steamed grain [^61] for the monks. The monks, having dressed in the morning, took their bowls and robes and entered Verañjā for alms. Being unable to obtain anything, they went to the horse-pen. Having brought the _pattha_ measures of steamed grain back to the monastery, they pounded them and ate them. Venerable Ānanda, having crushed a _pattha_ measure of the steamed grain on a stone, took it to the Master, and the Master ate it.

*MS.20* Now the Master had heard the sound of the mortar. Tathāgatas sometimes ask knowing,[^62] and knowing sometimes do not ask; they ask knowing the right time to ask, and they do not ask knowing the right time when not to ask. Tathāgatas *BD.1.13* ask when it is beneficial,[^63] not when it is unbeneficial; in regard to what is unbeneficial, the Tathāgatas have destroyed the bridge.*†*[^65] The Buddhas, the Masters, question the monks for two reasons: “We shall teach the _Dhamma_ or lay down a training rule for the disciples.”

*MS.21* Then the Master addressed Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, what is this sound of a mortar?”

Then Venerable Ānanda informed the Master. *Vin.3.7*

“Good, good, Ānanda, you who are superior people[^66] have conquered[^67] the problems of famine;*†* later generations[^69] will despise even rice and meat.”

*Bu-Pj.1.2.2* *MS.22* Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna[^70] approached the Master, paid homage to him and sat down to one side. He then said to him:

“At present, Master, Verañjā is short of food *BD.1.14* and stricken by hunger, with crops blighted and turned to straw. It is not easy to keep oneself going by collecting alms. Master, the under-surface of this great earth is abounding with food,*†* and its taste is just like pure honey.[^72] It would be good, Master, if I inverted the earth,[^73] so that the monks might enjoy the nutritive essence of the water-plants.”

“But what will you do with those creatures, Moggallāna, who are supported by the earth?”

“Master, I will make one of my hands broad, like the great earth, and I will make those creatures who are supported by the earth go there. Then with the other hand I will invert the earth.”

“Enough, Moggallāna, please do not invert the earth, or beings may become deranged.”[^74]

“It would be good, Master, if the whole Sangha of monks could go to Uttarakuru[^75] for alms.”

“Enough, Moggallāna, do not pursue this idea.”

* * *

*Bu-Pj.1.3.1* *MS.23* Now while Venerable Sāriputta[^76] was in seclusion, he thought this: “For which Buddhas, for which Masters, did the spiritual life not last long? For which Buddhas, for which Masters, did the spiritual life last long?”

*MS.24* Then, in the evening, Venerable Sāriputta came out of seclusion and approached the Master. He paid homage to him, sat down to one side and said this: *BD.1.15* “Just now, Master, as I was in seclusion, I thought this: ʻFor which Buddhas … last long?ʼ”

*MS.25* “Sāriputta, the spiritual life established by Master Vipassī,[^77] Master Sikhī and Master Vesabhū did not last long. But the spiritual life established by Master Kakusandha,[^78] Master Konāgamana and Master Kassapa did last long.”

*Bu-Pj.1.3.2* *MS.26* “And what, Master, is the reason why the spiritual life established by Master Vipassī, Master Sikhī and Master Vesabhū did not last long?”

“Sāriputta, Master Vipassī, Master Sikhī and Master Vessabhū were disinclined to teach the _Dhamma_ in detail to their disciples. They had few discourses[^79] in prose and in prose and verse, few expositions, verses, inspired utterances,[^80] quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts and analyses*†*[^82]; and training rules were not laid down and a Pātimokkha was not recited. After the disappearance of those Buddhas, those Masters, after the disappearance[^83] of the disciples enlightened under those Buddhas,[^84] those who were the last disciples—of various *BD.1.16* names, clans,[^85] and social strata,[^86] who had gone forth from various families—caused that spiritual life rapidly to disappear. It is just like various flowers, lying on a flat piece of wood[^87] without being tied together by a thread, are scattered about, whirled about and destroyed by the wind. Why is that? Because they are not held together by a thread. Even so, at the disappearance of those Buddhas, those Masters, at the disappearance of the disciples enlightened under those Buddhas, those who were the last disciples—of various names, clans and social strata, who had gone forth from various families—caused that spiritual life rapidly to disappear. *MS.27* Instead those Masters were untiring in exhorting their disciples, after reading their minds with their own.[^88]

Formerly, Sāriputta, while staying in a certain frightening jungle thicket, Master Vessabhū, the _arahant_, the fully Awakened One, exhorted and admonished a Sangha of a thousand monks, reading their minds with his own, saying: ʻThink like this,[^89] not like this;[^90] pay attention like this,[^91] not like this;[^92] forsake this;[^93] having attained this,[^94] abide in it.ʼ Then, when those thousand monks had been exhorted and admonished by Master Vessabhū, the _arahant_, the fully Awakened One, their minds were freed from the corruptions without grasping.[^95] But if anyone not devoid of desire should enter that frightening jungle- *BD.1.17* thicket, usually their hair would stand on end. This is the reason why the spiritual life established by Master Vipassī, Master Sikhī and Master Vesabhū did not last long.”

*Bu-Pj.1.3.3* *MS.28* “But what, Master, is the reason why the spiritual life established by Master Kakusandha, Master Konāgamana and Master Kassapa lasted long?”

*Vin.3.9* “Sāriputta, Master Kakusandha, Master Konāgamana and Master Kassapa were diligent in teaching the _Dhamma_ in detail to their disciples. They had many discourses in prose and in prose and in verse, many expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts and analyses; and training rules for their disciples were laid down and a Pātimokkha was recited. At the disappearance of those Buddhas, those Masters, at the disappearance of the disciples who were enlightened under those Buddhas, those who were the last disciples—of various names, clans and social strata, who had gone forth from various families—established that spiritual life for a long time. It is just like various flowers, lying on a piece of wood but being well tied together by a thread, are not scattered about, whirled about or destroyed by the wind. Why is that? Because they are well tied together by the thread. Even so, at the disappearance of those Buddhas, those Masters, at the disappearance of the disciples who were enlightened under those Buddhas, those who were the last disciples—of various names, clans and social strata, who had gone forth from various families—established that spiritual life for a long time. This is the reason why the spiritual life established by Master Kakusandha, Master Konāgamana and Master Kassapa lasted long.”

*Bu-Pj.1.3.4* *MS.29* Then Venerable Sāriputta got up from his seat, put his robe over one shoulder, *BD.1.18* put the palms of his hands together and said to the Master:

“This is the right time, Master,[^96] to lay down training rules and recite a Pātimokkha, so that this spiritual life may persist and last for a long time.”

“Hold on, Sāriputta, the Tathāgata will know the right time for that. The teacher does not lay down training rules for his disciples and recite a Pātimokkha until the causes of corruption appear in the Sangha.[^97] And they do not appear until the Sangha has attained long standing,[^98] *BD.1.19* great size[^99][^100][^101] or great learning.[^102] But when this happens, then the Teacher lays down training rules for his disciples *Vin.3.10* and recites a Pātimokkha in order to ward off those causes of corruptions. Sāriputta, the Sangha of monks is devoid of immorality,[^103] devoid of danger, stainless, purified, established in the essence.[^104] The most backward[^105] of these five hundred monks is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in any state of misery, assured, bound for awakening.[^106]

* * *

*BD.1.20* *Bu-Pj.1.4* *MS.35* Then the Master addressed Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, it is the custom for Tathāgatas not to tour the country without having taken leave of those who invited them to spend the rains. Let us go to the brahmin of Verañjā and take leave.”

“Yes, Master.”

*MS.36* Then the Master dressed, took his bowl and robe and, with Venerable Ānanda as his attendant,[^107] went to the dwelling of the brahmin of Verañjā and sat down on the prepared seat. Then the brahmin of Verañjā approached the Master, paid homage to him and sat down to one side. The Master then said to the brahmin of Verañjā:

*Vin.3.11* “Brahmin, having stayed for the rainy season according to your invitation, we are taking leave of you. We wish to depart for a tour of the country.”

“It is true, good Gotama, that you have stayed for the rainy season according to my invitation, but a gift has not been given. That is not good, nor is it because we did not want to give. It happened because household life is busy and there is much to do. May the good Gotama consent to a meal tomorrow together with the Sangha of monks.”

The Master consented by keeping silence. Then the Master, having taught, roused, gladdened and delighted the brahmin of Verañjā with a talk on the _Dhamma_, rose from his seat and went away. *MS.37* Then, when the night was over, the brahmin of Verañjā prepared various kinds of delicious food[^108] in his own home, and then informed the Master:

“It is time, good Gotama, the meal is ready.”

*MS.38* Then the Master, having dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe and, together with the Sangha of monks, he went to the dwelling of the brahmin of Verañjā and *BD.1.21* sat down on the prepared seat. Then, with his own hands, the brahmin of Verañjā served various kinds of delicious food to the Sangha of monks with the Buddha at its head. When they were satisfied and the Master had eaten and finished his meal, he gave the Master a set of three robes and a pair of robes to each monk.[^109] The Master instructed, roused, gladdened and delighted the brahmin of Verañjā with talk on the _Dhamma_, and then rose from his seat and departed.

*MS.39* The Master, having remained at Verañjā for as long as he liked, went to Payāgapatiṭṭhāna via Soreyya,[^110] Saṅkassa[^111] and Kaṇṇakujja.[^112] There he crossed the river Ganges and proceeded to Benares. Having remained at Benares for as long as he liked, he set out for Vesālī on tour. Wandering on tour by stages, he arrived at Vesālī.[^113] There he stayed in the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.

*MS.40* The chapter on Verañjā is finished.

## Origin story

### First sub-story

*Bu-Pj.1.5.1* *MS.41* At that time not far from Vesālī was a village called Kalandaka. There lived Sudinna, the son of a prominent merchant.[^114] *BD.1.22* Now Sudinna the Kalandaka[^115] went to Vesālī on some *Vin.3.12* business together with many friends. At that time the Master was seated, surrounded by a great assembly of people, teaching the _Dhamma_. When Sudinna saw this he thought:[^116] “Perhaps I should listen to the Dhamma?”[^117] Then Sudinna approached the assembly and sat down to one side.

As he was sitting there, Sudinna thought: “So far as I understand the _Dhamma_ taught by the Master, it is no easy matter for one who lives in a house to lead the spiritual life that is utterly perfect and pure as a polished conch shell. Perhaps I should cut off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robes and go forth from home into homelessness?”

When the crowd had been taught, roused, gladdened and delighted by the Master with talk on the _Dhamma_, they rose from their seats, paid homage to the Master, circumambulated him with their right side towards him and departed. *MS.42* When the crowd had departed, Sudinna approached the Master, paid homage to him and sat down to one side. He then said to the Master:

“Master, so far as I understand the _Dhamma_ taught by the Master, it is not an easy matter for one who lives in a house to lead the spiritual life that is utterly perfect and pure as a polished conch shell. Master, I wish to cut off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robes and go forth from home into homelessness. May the Master let me go forth.”

*BD.1.23* “But, Sudinna, do you have your parentsʼ permission?”

“No, Master.”

“Sudinna, Tathāgatas do not ordain a child without the parentsʼ permission.”

“I will do whatever is necessary, Master, to get my parentsʼ permission.”

*Bu-Pj.1.5.2* *MS.43* Then Sudinna, having finished his business in Vesālī, returned to Kalandaka. There he approached his parents and said:

“Mother and father, in so far as I understand the _Dhamma_ taught by the Master, it is no easy matter for one who lives in a house to lead the spiritual life that is utterly perfect and pure as a polished conch shell. I wish to cut off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robes and go forth from home *Vin.3.13* into homelessness. Give me your permission to go forth.”

His parents replied:

“But, Sudinna, you are our only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for. Sudinna, you have no experience of suffering. Even if you died, we would not willingly be without you. How can we, while you are still living, permit you to go forth from home into homelessness?”

*MS.44* A second time Sudinna said to his parents: “Mother and father …” “… into homelessness?” A third time Sudinna said to his parents: “Mother and father …” “… into homelessness?”

*MS.46* Thinking, “My parents do not permit me to go forth,” he lay down on the bare ground and said: “I will either die right here or go forth.” And he stopped eating and did not eat *BD.1.24* at the next seven meals.[^118]

*MS.47* Then his parents said: “Dear Sudinna, you are our only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for; you have no experience of suffering. Even if you died, we would not willingly be without you. How can we, while you are still living, permit you to go forth? Get up, Sudinna, eat, drink and amuse yourself. Find delight[^119] in sensual pleasures and in doing meritorious actions.[^120] We do not allow you to go forth.” When they had said this, Sudinna was silent.

*MS.48* A second time and a third time the parents of Sudinna said: “… We do not permit you to go forth.”A third time Sudinna was silent.

*Bu-Pj.1.5.3* *MS.49* Then the friends of Sudinna approached him and said: “Sudinna, you are your *Vin.3.14* parentsʼ only child, dear and beloved. You live in comfort and are well cared for; you have no experience of suffering. Even if you died, your parents would not willingly be without you. How can they, while you are still living, allow you to go forth? Get up, Sudinna, eat, drink and amuse yourself. Find delight in sensual pleasures and in doing meritorious actions. Your parents *BD.1.25* will not allow you to go forth.”

When they had said this, Sudinna was silent. A second and a third time the friends of Sudinna said: “Sudinna, you are …” and a third time Sudinna was silent.

*Bu-Pj.1.5.4* *MS.50* Then the friends of Sudinna approached his parents and said: “Mother and father, Sudinna says that he will either die right there on the bare ground or go forth. If you do not allow Sudinna to go forth, he will die there. But if you allow him to go forth, you will see him again afterwards. And if he does not enjoy the going forth, what alternative[^121] will he have but to come back here? Allow Sudinna to go forth.”

“We allow him,” they said.

Then the friends of Sudinna approached him and said: “Get up, Sudinna, your parents allow you to go forth from home into homelessness.”

*MS.51* Then Sudinna thought: “They say that my parents will allow me to go forth from home into homelessness.” And he rose, joyful, delighted and elated, stroking his limbs with his hands. Then Sudinna, having spent a few days regaining his strength, approached the Master, paid homage to him and sat down at one side. He then said to the Master:

“I am permitted by my parents, Master, to go forth from home into homelessness. May the Master allow me to go forth.” *Vin.3.15*

*BD.1.26* Then Sudinna received the going forth in the presence of the Master, and he received the full ordination. And not long afterwards Venerable Sudinna practised these kinds of ascetic practises:[^122] living in the wilderness, going on alms-round, wearing rags, going on continuous alms-round; and he dwelt depending on a certain village of the Vajjians.

*Bu-Pj.1.5.5* *MS.52* At that time the Vajjians[^123] were short of food[^124] and stricken by hunger, with crops blighted and turned to straw, and it was not easy to keep oneself going by collecting alms. Now Venerable Sudinna thought to himself: “At present the Vajjians are short of food and stricken by hunger, with crops blighted and turned to straw, and it is not easy to keep oneself going by collecting alms. But I have many relations in Vesālī who are rich, have great wealth and property, much gold and silver,[^125] many resources and requisites, much wealth in grain.[^126] Perhaps I should live in dependence on my relatives? Because of me my relations will be able to make offerings and make merit, the monks will obtain requisites and I will not go short of almsfood.”

*MS.53* Then Venerable Sudinna, having put his lodging in order, took his bowl and robe and set out for Vesālī, where he arrived by travelling in stages. There the Venerable Sudinna stayed in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. The relations of Venerable Sudinna heard that he *BD.1.27* had arrived in Vesālī and they brought him sixty offerings of barley as a gift of food.[^127] Then Venerable Sudinna, having given these sixty offerings of barley to the monks, dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe and entered the village of Kalandaka for alms. As he was going about Kalandaka on a continuous alms-tour, he came to his own fatherʼs house.

*Bu-Pj.1.5.6* *MS.54* At that time the female slave of Venerable Sudinnaʼs relations wanted to throw away the previous eveningʼs porridge. But Venerable Sudinna said to her:

“If that is to be thrown away, sister, put it here in my bowl.”

As the slave-girl of Venerable Sudinnaʼs relations was putting the previous eveningʼs porridge into his bowl, she recognised his hands, feet and voice.[^128] She then went to his mother and said:

“Please know,[^129] madam, that the young master Sudinna is back.”

“If you speak the truth, I will make you a freed woman.”

*MS.55* Just then Venerable Sudinna was eating the previous eveningʼs porridge at the base of a certain wall.[^130] The *Vin.3.16* Venerable Sudinnaʼs father, coming from work, saw him *BD.1.28* there. He approached him and said:

“But, Sudinna, isnʼt there … and you are eating old porridge! Isnʼt there your own home to go to?”

“We went to your house, householder. Thatʼs where we received this porridge.”

Then Venerable Sudinnaʼs father took him by the arm and said: “Come, Sudinna, letʼs go to the house.”

Then Venerable Sudinna went to his own fatherʼs house and sat down on a prepared seat. And his father said to him: “Eat, dear Sudinna.”

“There is no need, householder, I have finished eating for today.”

“Then please come back for the meal tomorrow.”

Venerable Sudinna consented by keeping silent. He then rose from his seat and departed.

*MS.56* Then Venerable Sudinnaʼs mother had the ground smeared with fresh cow-dung, had two heaps made, one of gold coins[^131] and the other *BD.1.29* of gold. The heaps were so large that a man standing on one side could not see a man standing on the other. Hiding these heaps with screens and preparing a seat between them surrounded by a curtain, she addressed Venerable Sudinnaʼs former wife:

“Daughter-in-law, adorn yourself in the way *BD.1.30* that our son Sudinna found you especially attractive.”

“Yes, madam,” she responded.

*Bu-Pj.1.5.7* *MS.57* Then, in the morning, Venerable Sudinna dressed, took his bowl and robe and went to his fatherʼs house, where he sat down on the prepared seat. His father approached him, uncovered the heaps and said:

“This dowry, dear Sudinna, the fortune from your mother, is yours. Another is the fortune from your father and another from your ancestors.[^132] It is possible, Sudinna, to return to the low life, enjoy wealth and make merit. Come, Sudinna, please *Vin.3.17* do so.”

“I am not able to do so, father, I cannot. I am enjoying[^133] the spiritual life.”

A second and a third time Venerable Sudinnaʼs father repeated his request. Venerable Sudinna replied:

“If you would not get offended, householder, we could tell you what to do.”

“Speak, Sudinna.”

“Well then, householder, make some large bags of hemp-cloth, fill them with the coins and the gold, take them away *BD.1.31* in carts and dump them in the middle of the Ganges. And why? Because you would avoid the danger, fear,[^134] terror, and (trouble with) protection that they will cause you.”

When he had said this, his father became displeased and thought, “How could our son Sudinna speak like this.”

*MS.58* Then he addressed Venerable Sudinnaʼs former wife: “Well now, daughter-in-law, as you were dear and beloved by him, perhaps our son Sudinna will listen to you.”

Then the former wife of Venerable Sudinna took hold of his feet and said: “What are these nymphs like, my lordʼs son, for whose sake you lead the spiritual life?”

“I do not lead the spiritual life, sister, for the sake of nymphs.”

Then the former wife of Venerable Sudinna thought:

“From today my lordʼs son calls me ʻsisterʼ” and she fainted on the spot.

*Bu-Pj.1.5.8* *MS.59* Then Venerable Sudinna said to his father: “If, householder, there is food to be given, give it, but do not annoy me.”

“Eat, Sudinna,” he said.

Then, with their own hands, Venerable Sudinnaʼs mother and father served and satisfied him with various kinds of delicious food.

Then, when Venerable Sudinna had finished his meal, his mother said to him:

“This family, dear Sudinna, is rich, has great wealth and property, much gold and silver, many resources and requisites, much wealth in grain. It is possible, dear Sudinna, to return to the low life, enjoy wealth and make *BD.1.32* merit. Come, Sudinna, please do so.”

“Mother, I am not able to do so, *Vin.3.18* I cannot. I am enjoying[^135] the spiritual life.”

*MS.60* A second time … a third time Venerable Sudinnaʼs mother said: “This family, Sudinna, is rich … much wealth in grain. For this reason, dear Sudinna, beget offspring; do not let the Licchavis[^136] take over our heirless property.”

“It is possible for me to do this,[^137] mother.”

“Where are you staying at present?”

“In the Great Wood,” he said. Then Venerable Sudinna rose from his seat and departed.

*Bu-Pj.1.5.9* *MS.61* Then the mother of Venerable Sudinna addressed his former wife: “Daughter-in-law, as soon as you menstruate, please tell me.”

“Very well, madam,” she replied. Not long afterwards Venerable Sudinnaʼs former wife menstruated, and she reported it to Venerable Sudinnaʼs mother.

“Daughter-in-law, adorn yourself in the way that our son Sudinna found you especially attractive.”

“Very well, madam,” she replied.

*BD.1.33* Then Venerable Sudinnaʼs mother, together with his former wife, approached Venerable Sudinna in the Great Wood. There she said to him:

“This family, dear Sudinna, is rich, has great wealth and property, much gold and silver, many resources and requisites, much wealth in grain. For this reason, Sudinna, beget offspring; do not let the Licchavis take over our heirless property.”

“It is possible for me to do this, mother,” he said. He then took his former wife by the arm, plunged into the Great Wood and—there being no training rule and he seeing no danger—had sexual intercourse with his former wife three times. As a result she conceived.

*MS.63* The earth-gods cried out: “Good sirs, the Sangha of monks has been healthy[^138] and free from danger. But Sudinna the Kalandaka has produced a tumour, has produced danger.”

The gods belonging to the heaven of the four great kings hearing the cry of the earth-gods in turn cried out … the Tāvatiṁsa gods … the Yāma gods … the Tusita gods … the gods who delight in creation … *Vin.3.19* the gods who control the creation of others … the gods belonging to the retinue of the supreme beings in turn cried out:

“Good sirs, the Sangha of monks has been healthy and free from danger. But Sudinna the Kalandaka has produced a tumour, has produced danger.” Thus in that moment, in that instance, the report spread as far as the Brahmā-world.[^139]

*MS.64* Then the pregnancy of Venerable Sudinnaʼs wife developed and she eventually gave birth to a son. Now the friends of Venerable Sudinna called this boy Bījaka*†*; they called Venerable Sudinnaʼs former wife Bījakaʼs mother; they called Venerable *BD.1.34* Sudinna Bījakaʼs father. After some time they both[^141] went forth from home into homelessness, and they realised _arahantship_.

*Bu-Pj.1.5.10* *MS.65* But Venerable Sudinna was anxious and remorseful, and he thought: “Indeed, itʼs a loss for me, itʼs no gain; indeed, itʼs badly gained by me, not well-gained: having gone forth in such a well-proclaimed _Dhamma_ and training, I was not able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life.” And because of his anxiety and remorse, he became thin, haggard and pale, his veins protruding all over his limbs; he became sad, of sluggish mind, miserable, depressed, remorseful, weighed down with grief.[^142]

*MS.66* Then the monks who were Venerable Sudinnaʼs friends said to him: “Formerly, friend Sudinna, you were handsome, your features rounded, your face a good colour, your skin clear. But now you are thin, haggard and pale, your veins protruding all over your limbs; and you are sad, of sluggish mind, miserable, depressed, remorseful, weighed down with grief. Could it be, friend Sudinna, that you lead the spiritual life dissatisfied?”[^143]

*MS.67* “I do not, friends, lead the spiritual life dissatisfied. I have done an bad deed. I have had sexual intercourse with my former wife. That is why I am anxious … I was not able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life.”

*MS.68* “Friend Sudinna, no wonder you are anxious,[^144] no wonder you feel remorse, in that, having gone forth in such a well-proclaimed _Dhamma_ and training, you were not able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life. *BD.1.35* Is not, friend, the _Dhamma_ taught by the Master in various ways for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion; for the sake of freedom from bondage, not for the sake of bondage; for the sake of non-grasping, not for the sake of grasping? When the _Dhamma_ is taught by the Master for the sake of dispassion, how can you be intent upon passion? When the _Dhamma_ is taught by the Master for the sake of freedom from bondage, *Vin.3.20* how can you be intent upon bondage? When the _Dhamma_ is taught by the Master for the sake of non-grasping, how can you be intent upon grasping? Friend, has not the _Dhamma_ been taught in many ways by the Master for the waning of passion, for the subduing of intoxication, for the restraint of desire, for the abolition of clinging, for the annihilation of the round of existence,[^145] for the destruction of craving, for fading away, for cessation, for extinguishment?[^146] Has not the abandoning of sense pleasures been declared in many ways by the Master, the full understanding of the perception of sense pleasures, the abolishing of thirst for sense pleasures, the elimination of thoughts of sense pleasures, the stilling of the fever of sense pleasures? It will not, friend, give rise to confidence in those without it, nor increase the confidence of those who have it, but it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.”

*Bu-Pj.1.5.11* *MS.69* Having rebuked Venerable Sudinna in various way, those monks told this matter to the Master. And in this connection the Master convened the Sangha of monks and questioned Venerable Sudinna:

*BD.1.36* “Is it true, Sudinna, that you had sexual intercourse with your former wife?”

“It is true, Master.”

*MS.70* The Buddha, the Master, rebuked him: “Foolish man, it is not suitable it is not becoming, it is not proper, it is unworthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it is not to be done. How could you go forth in such a well-proclaimed _Dhamma_ and training and not be able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life? Have I not taught the _Dhamma_ in many ways for the sake of dispassion … When the _Dhamma_ has been taught by me for the sake of dispassion, how can you be intent upon passion? … Have I not in many ways declared the abandoning of sense pleasures … the stilling of the fever of sense pleasures? It would be better, foolish man, for your male organ to enter the mouth of a terrible and poisonous snake than to enter a woman. It would be better for your male organ to enter the mouth of a black snake than to enter a woman. It would be better for your male organ to enter a charcoal pit, burning, ablaze, afire, than to enter a woman. Why is that? Because for that reason you might die or experience deadly suffering, but you would not on that account, at the breaking up of the body after death, be reborn in the plane of misery, a bad destination, the abyss, hell. But for this reason, at the breaking up of the body after death, you might be reborn in the plane of misery, *Vin.3.21* a bad destination, the abyss, hell.[^147] Foolish man, you have practised what is contrary to the true _Dhamma_,[^148] the common *BD.1.37* practice, the low practice,[^149] the coarse practice, that which ends with a wash,[^150] that which is done in private, that which is done wherever there are couples. You are the forerunner, the first performer of many unwholesome things. It will not give rise to confidence in those without it, nor increase the confidence of those who have it, but it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.”

*MS.71* Then the Master, having rebuked Venerable Sudinna in various ways, spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain, in dispraise of great desires, lack of contentment, socialising[^151] and laziness, but he spoke in praise in various ways of being easy to support and maintain, of desiring little, contentment, self-effacement,[^152] ascetic practices, serenity, decrease of defilements,[^153] and of the putting forth of energy.[^154] Having given a _Dhamma_ talk on what was right and seemly, he addressed the monks:

“On account of this,[^155] monks, I will lay down a training rule for the monks for the following ten reasons: for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of recalcitrant people, for the ease *BD.1.38* of well-behaved monks, for the restraint of corruptions that pertain to the present life and for warding off corruptions that pertain to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it and to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the continuation of the true Dhamma[^156] and for supporting the training.[^157] And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:

### First preliminary ruling

*MS.72* If a monk has sexual intercourse, he is expelled[^158] and not in communion.”

*MS.73* Thus the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.

*MS.74* The section on Sudinna is finished.

### Second sub-story

*MS.75* At one time a certain monk in the Great Wood near Vesālī won over a female monkey with food and had sexual intercourse with her. Then, in the morning, he dressed, took his bowl and robe and entered Vesālī for alms. Now at that time a number of monks who were engaged in touring the lodgings came to this monkʼs dwelling. The female monkey, seeing those monks coming, went up to them and shook her buttocks in front of them, wagged her tail, presented her buttocks and made a gesture. *Vin.3.22* Then the *BD.1.39* monks thought: “Undoubtedly this monk is having sexual intercourse with this monkey,” and they hid to one side. Then, when that monk had gone for alms in Vesālī and had returned with his almsfood, he ate one part himself and gave the rest to the female monkey. Having eaten the food, the monkey presented her buttocks to the monk. He then had sexual intercourse with her.

*MS.77* Then those monks said to that monk: “Friend, hasnʼt a training rule been laid down by the Master? Why then do you have sexual intercourse with a monkey?”

“It is true, friends, that a training rule has been laid down by the Master, but it refers to human women, not to animals.”

“But, friend, that is just the same. It is not suitable, it is not becoming, it is not proper, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it ought not to be done. How could you go forth in this well-proclaimed _Dhamma_ and training and not be able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life? Has not the _Dhamma_ been taught in various ways by the Master for the sake of dispassion and not for the sake of passion[^159] … for the stilling of the fever of sense pleasures? Friend, it will not give rise to confidence in those without it … and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.”

Having rebuked that monk in various ways, they told this matter to the Master. *MS.78* The Master then had the Sangha of monks convened, and questioned that monk:

“Is it true, monk, that you had sexual intercourse with a monkey?”

“It is true, Master.”

Then the Master rebuked him, saying: \= *Bu-Pj.1.5.11* above. _Instead of_ of a woman, _read_ of a monkey “… Foolish *BD.1.40* man, it will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:

### Second preliminary ruling

*MS.79* “If a monk has sexual intercourse, even with an animal,[^160] he is expelled and not in communion.”

*MS.80* Thus the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.

*MS.81* The story of the female monkey is finished.

### Third sub-story

*Bu-Pj.1.7.1* *Vin.3.23* *MS.82* At that time a number of Vajjian monks from Vesālī ate, slept and bathed as much as they liked. Doing so and not paying proper attention, they had sexual intercourse, without first renouncing the training[^161] and disclosing their weakness. After some time they were affected by loss of relatives, by loss of property and by illness. They then approached Venerable Ānanda and said:

“Bhante Ānanda, we do not blame the Buddha, the _Dhamma_ or the Sangha; we *BD.1.41* only blame ourselves. We were unfortunate, we had little merit: having gone forth in such a well-proclaimed _Dhamma_ and training, we were unable for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life. If, bhante Ānanda, we were now to obtain the going forth and the full ordination in the presence of the Master, we would have clarity about wholesome qualities and be devoted day after day to developing the aids to awakening.[^162] Bhante Ānanda, please inform the Master of this matter.”

“Yes, friends,” he replied. He then went to the Master and informed him of this matter.

*MS.83* “It is impossible, Ānanda, it cannot happen,[^163] that the Tathāgata should abolish a training rule that entails expulsion because of the Vajjians.”

*MS.84* The Master then gave a _Dhamma_ talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, if a monk, without first renouncing the training and disclosing his weakness, has sexual intercourse, he may not receive the full ordination. But, monks, if someone has sexual intercourse after first renouncing the training and disclosing his weakness, he may receive the full ordination.

“And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:

## Final ruling

*MS.85* “If a monk, having entered upon the monksʼ training and way *BD.1.42* of life, without first renouncing the training and disclosing his weakness, has sexual intercourse, even with an animal, he is expelled and not in communion.”

## Definitions

*Bu-Pj.1.8.1* *MS.86* A means: whoever, of such a kind, of such activity, of such social standing, of such name, *Vin.3.24* of such family, of such conduct, of such behaviour, of such association,[^164] who is an elder,[^165] one who is new or one of middle standing:—this is called a monk.

*MS.87* Monk means: he is a monk because he lives on alms; a monk because he has gone over to living on alms; a monk because he is one who wears the patchwork cloth; a monk by convention; a monk on account of his acknowledgement; a “come, monk” monk; a monk because he was ordained by going to the three refuges; a good monk; a monk of substance; a trainee monk; a monk beyond training; a monk who is ordained by a complete Sangha through a procedure[^166] of one motion and three announcements,[^167] which is unchallengeable and fit to stand. The monk who is ordained by a complete Sangha through a procedure of one motion and three announcements, which is unchallengeable and fit to stand,[^168] this sort of monk is meant in this case.

*MS.88* Training means: the three trainings are—training in the higher morality, training in the higher mind, *BD.1.43* training in the higher wisdom. The training in the higher morality is the training meant in this case.

*MS.89* Way of life means: whatever training rule is laid down by the Master: this is called _way of life._ One trains in this, and thereby one is called possessed of the mode of life.

*Bu-Pj.1.8.2* *MS.90* Without first renouncing the training and disclosing his weakness means:

There is, monks, a disclosure of weakness without the training being renounced; and there is, monks, a disclosure of weakness together with the training being renounced.

*MS.91* “And how, monks, is there a disclosure of weakness without the training being renounced? Here, monks, a monk who is discontent, dissatisfied, desirous of abandoning the state of a recluse, disgusted, troubled and repelled[^169] by monkhood, longing to be a householder, longing to be a lay-follower, longing to be a monastery attendant, longing to be a novice, longing to belong to another sect, longing to be a disciple of another sect, longing not to be a recluse, longing not to be a son of the Sakyan—he says and declares: ʻPerhaps I should renounce the Buddha?ʼ In this was, monks, there is a disclosure of weakness without the training being renounced.

*MS.92* Then further, discontent, dissatisfied … longing not to be a son of the Sakyan, he says and declares: ʻPerhaps I should renounce the Dhamma?ʼ … the Sangha … the training … the discipline … the Pātimokkha … the recital … *Vin.3.25* my preceptor … my teacher … being a disciple … being a pupil … our common preceptor … our common teacher … he says and declares: ʻPerhaps *BD.1.44* I should renounce my fellow monks?ʼ … he says and declares: ʻPerhaps I should be a householder?ʼ … ʻPerhaps I should be a lay-follower?ʼ … ʻPerhaps I should be a monastery attendant?ʼ … ʻPerhaps I should be a novice?ʼ … ʻPerhaps I should be an adherent of another sect?ʼ … ʻPerhaps I should be a disciple of another sect?ʼ … ʻPerhaps I should not be a recluse?ʼ … ʻPerhaps I should not be a son of the Sakyan?ʼ In this way, monks, there is a disclosure of weakness without the training being renounced.

*MS.93* “Then further, discontent, dissatisfied … longing not to be a son of the Sakyan, he says and declares: ʻBut if I renounced the Buddhaʼ … he says and declares: ʻBut if I were not a son of the Sakyanʼ … he says and declares: ʻPerhaps I should renounce the Buddha?ʼ … he says and declares: ʻPerhaps I should not be a son of the Sakyan?ʼ … he says and declares: ʻWell then, I should renounce the Buddhaʼ … he says and declares: ʻWell then, I should not be a son of the Sakyanʼ … he says and declares: ʻI think I should renounce the Buddhaʼ … he says and declares: ʻI think I should not be a son of the Sakyan.ʼ In this way, monks, there is a disclosure of weakness without the training being renounced.

*MS.94* “Then further, discontent, dissatisfied … longing not to be a son of the Sakyan, he says and declares: ʻI remember my motherʼ … ʻI remember my fatherʼ … ʻI remember my brotherʼ … ʻI remember my sisterʼ … ʻI remember my sonʼ … ʻI remember my daughterʼ … ʻI remember my wifeʼ … ʻI remember my relationsʼ … ʻI remember my friendsʼ … ʻI remember my villageʼ … ʻI remember my townʼ … ʻI remember my fieldsʼ … ʻI remember my landʼ … ʻI remember my gold coinsʼ … ʻI remember my goldʼ … ʻI remember my professionʼ … he says and declares: ʻI remember my former laughter, chatter and amusement.ʼ In this way, monks, *Vin.3.26* there is a disclosure of weakness without the training being renounced.

*MS.95* “Then further, discontent, dissatisfied … longing not to be a son of the Sakyan, he says and declares: ʻI have a mother, she ought to be supported by meʼ … ʻI have *BD.1.45* a father, he ought to be supported by meʼ … ʻI have a brother … ʻI have a sister … ʻI have a son … ʻI have a daughter … ʻI have a wife … ʻI have relations … he says and declares: ʻI have friends, they ought to be supported by me.ʼ In this way, monks, there is a disclosure of weakness without the training being renounced.

*MS.96* “Then further, discontent, dissatisfied … longing not to be a son of the Sakyan, he says and declares: ʻI have a mother, she will support meʼ … ʻI have a father, he will support meʼ … as above … ʻI have friends, they will support meʼ … ʻI have a village, I will live by means of itʼ … ʻI have a town, I will live by means of itʼ … fields … land … gold coins … gold … he says and declares: ʻI have a profession, I will live by means of it.ʼ In this way, monks, there is a disclosure of weakness without the training being renounced.

*MS.97* “Then further, discontent, dissatisfied … longing not to be a son of the Sakyan, he says and declares: ʻThis is difficult to doʼ … ʻthis is not easy to doʼ … ʻthis is difficultʼ … ʻthis is not easyʼ … ʻI cannot endureʼ … ʻI am unableʼ … ʻI do not enjoy myselfʼ … ʻI take no delight.ʼ[^170] In this way, monks, there is a disclosure of weakness without the training being renounced.

*Bu-Pj.1.8.3* *MS.98* “And how, monks, is there a disclosure of weakness together with the training being renounced? Here, monks, a monk who is discontent, dissatisfied … longing not to be a son of the Sakyan, says and declares: ʻI renounce the Buddha.ʼ In this way, monks, there is a disclosure of weakness together with the training being renounced.

*MS.99* “Then further, discontent, dissatisfied … longing not to be a son of the Sakyan, he says and declares: ʻI renounce the Dhammaʼ … *Vin.3.27* ʻI renounce the Sanghaʼ … the training … the discipline … the Pātimokkha … the recital … my preceptor … my teacher … being a disciple … being a pupil … our common preceptor *BD.1.46* … our common teacher … he says and declares: ʻI renounce my fellow monksʼ … he says and declares: ʻConsider me a householderʼ … ʻConsider me a lay-followerʼ … a monastery attendant … a novice … an adherent of another sect … a disciple of another sect … not a recluse … ʻConsider me not a son of the Sakyan.ʼ In this way too, monks, there is a disclosure of weakness together with the training being renounced.

*MS.100* “Then further, discontent, dissatisfied … longing not to be a son of the Sakyan, he says and declares: ʻI have no need of the Buddhaʼ … ʻI have no need of my fellow monks.ʼ In this way too, monks …

“Then further … he says and declares: ʻNo more of the Buddha for meʼ … ʻNo more of my fellow monks for me.ʼ In this way too, monks …

“Then further … he says and declares: ʻThe Buddha is no of use to meʼ … ʻMy fellow monks are of no use to me.ʼ In this way too, monks …

“Then further … he says and declares: ʻI am well freed from the Buddha.ʼ … I am well freed from my fellow monks.ʼ In this way too, monks … being renounced.

*MS.101* “Or whatever other synonyms there are for the Buddha, for the _Dhamma_, for the Sangha, for the training … for oneʼs fellow monks, for householders … or for not being a son of the Sakyan; he speaks and declares by way of these indications, by way of these marks, by way of these signs. In this way, monks, there is a disclosure of weakness together with the training being renounced.

*Bu-Pj.1.8.4* *MS.102* “And how, monks, is the training not renounced? Here, monks, if one renounces the training by way of these indications, by way of these marks, by way of these signs, but one is insane, then the training is not renounced. If one renounces the training in the presence of one who is insane, the training is not renounced. If one who is deranged renounces *BD.1.47* the training … if one renounces the training in the presence of one who is deranged … if one is overwhelmed by pain … if one renounces the training in the presence of one who is overwhelmed by pain … if one renounces the training in the presence of gods[^171] … if one renounces the training in the presence of an animal, the training is not renounced. If an Indian[^172] renounces the training in the presence of a foreigner[^173] and he does not understand, the training is not renounced. If a foreigner renounces the training in the presence of an Indian … if an Indian renounces the training in the presence of an Indian … if a foreigner renounces *Vin.3.28* the training in the presence of a foreigner and he does not understand, the training is not renounced. If he renounces the training as a joke … he renounces the training by speaking too fast … if he announces what he does not wish to announce … if he does not announce what he wishes to announce … if he announces to one who does not understand … if he does not announce to one who understands … or if he does not make a full announcement, the training is not renounced. In this way, monks, the training is not renounced.”

*Bu-Pj.1.8.5* *MS.103* Sexual intercourse means: what is contrary to the true _Dhamma_, the common practice, the low practice, the coarse practice, that which ends with a wash, that which is done in private, that which is done wherever there are couples: this is called sexual intercourse.

*MS.104* Has means: organ with organ, genital with genital, even to the depth of a sesame seed, this is called has.

*MS.105* Even with an animal means: even having sexual intercourse with a female animal,[^174] he is *BD.1.48* not a recluse, not a son of the Sakyan; how much less so with a woman: therefore it is called even with an animal.

*MS.106* He is expelled means: as a man with his head cut off is incapable[^175] of living by (re-establishing) that bodily connection, so is a monk who has had sexual intercourse not a recluse, not a son of the Sakyan[^176]: therefore it is said that he is expelled.

*MS.107* Not in communion means: communion[^177] means: a common official action, the same recital, the same training—this is called communion. He does not take part in this—he is therefore called not in communion.
