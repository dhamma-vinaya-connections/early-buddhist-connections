# Monks’ Undetermined (_Aniyata_) 2

*BD.1.336* *Bu-An.2.1.1* At one time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. At that time the venerable Udāyin said: “It has been forbidden by the lord to sit together with womenfolk, a man and a woman, in a secret place on a secluded, convenient seat,” but he sat together with that young girl, the one with the other, in a secret place, conversing at the right time, talking _dhamma_ at the right time. A second time did Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, being invited, come to that family. Visākhā saw the venerable Udāyin sitting together with that girl, the one with the other, in a secret place, and seeing them she said to the venerable Udāyin:

“This, honoured sir, is not right, it is not suitable for the master to sit together with womenfolk, a man and a woman, in a secret place. Although, honoured sir, the master has no desire for that thing, unbelieving people are difficult to convince.”

But the venerable Udāyin took no heed after he had been spoken to thus by Visākhā. Then Visākhā, when she had departed, told this matter to the monks. Those who were modest monks … \= *Bu-An.1.1*; _the words_ on a secluded, convenient seat _are omitted here_ …“And thus, monks, this course of training should be set forth:

“And furthermore, if there is not a seat which is secluded and convenient, but sufficiently so[^1] for speaking to a woman with lewd words,[^2] then whatever monk should sit down on such a seat together with a woman, *BD.1.337* the one with the other, in a secret place, and a trustworthy woman lay-follower seeing him should speak concerning a certain one of two matters: either one entailing a formal meeting of the Order, or one involving expiation, and the monk himself acknowledging that he was sitting down, should be dealt with according to a certain one of two matters: as to whether it is one entailing a formal meeting of the Order, or as to whether it is one involving expiation. Or *Vin.3.192* that monk should be dealt with according to what that trustworthy woman lay-follower should say. This again is an undetermined matter.”

* * *

*Bu-An.2.2.1* And furthermore, if there is not a seat which is secluded means: it is not secluded by a wall built of wattle and daub or by a door or by a screen or by a screen wall or by a tree or by a pillar or by a sack, or it is not secluded by anything whatever.[^3]

Not convenient means: it is not possible to indulge in sexual intercourse.[^4]

But sufficiently so for speaking to a woman with lewd words means: it is possible to speak to a woman with lewd words.

Whatever means: he who.

Monk means: … this is the sense in which monk is to be understood.

On such a seat means: on a seat like that.

Woman means: a human woman, not a female _yakkha_, not a female departed one, not a female animal,[^5] one who is learned and competent to know good and bad speech, and what is lewd and what is not lewd.[^6]

Together with means: together.[^7]

Should sit down means: when the woman is sitting …[^8]

Seeing means: seeing.[^9]

* * *

*Bu-An.2.2.2* *BD.1.338* Should speak concerning a certain one of two matters:

Either one entailing a formal meeting of the Order, or one involving expiation, and the monk himself acknowledging that he was sitting down, should be dealt with according to a certain one of two matters: as to whether it is one entailing a formal meeting of the Order, or as to whether it is one involving expiation. Or that monk should be dealt with according to what that trustworthy woman lay-follower should say.

If she should say this: “The master was seen by me when he was sitting down and coming into[^10] physical contact with a woman,” if he acknowledges this he should be dealt with for an offence.

If she should say this: “The master was seen by me … physical contact,” and if he should say: “It is true that I was sitting, but I did not come into physical contact,” be should be dealt with for sitting … “I was not sitting, but I was lying down,” he should be dealt with for lying down … “I was not sitting, but I was standing,” he should not be dealt with.

If she should say this: “The master was seen by me lying down, and coming into physical contact with a woman,” if he acknowledges this he should be dealt with for an offence … “It is true that I was lying down, but I did not come into physical contact,” he should be dealt with for lying down … “I was not lying down, but I was sitting down,” *Vin.3.193* he should be dealt with for sitting down … “I was not lying down, but I was standing,” he should not be dealt with.

If she should say this: “The master was heard by me when he was sitting down and speaking lewd words to a woman,” if he acknowledges this he should be dealt with for an offence.

If she should say this: “The master … to a woman,” and if he should say: “It is true that I was sitting down but I did not speak lewd words to a woman,” he should be dealt with for sitting down … “I was not sitting down but I was lying down,” he should be dealt with for lying down … “I was not sitting down but I was standing,” he should not be dealt with.

*BD.1.339* If she should say this. “The master was heard as he was lying down and speaking lewd words to a woman” … “but I was standing,” he should not be dealt with.

If she should say this: “The master was seen by me sitting together with a woman, the one with the other, in a secret place,” and if he acknowledges this he should be dealt with for sitting down … “I was not sitting down, but I was lying down,” he should be dealt with for lying down … “I was not sitting down, but I was standing,” he should not be dealt with.

If she should say this: “The master was seen by me lying down together with a woman, the one with the other, in a secret place,” and if he acknowledges this, he should be dealt with for lying down … “I was not lying down, but I was sitting down,” he should be dealt with for sitting down … “I was not sitting down, but I was standing,” he should not be dealt with.

This again means: it is called so with reference to the former.

Undetermined means: not determined as to whether it involves a formal meeting of the Order, or expiation.

* * *

*Bu-An.2.3.1* He acknowledges going, he acknowledges sitting down, he acknowledges an offence, he should be dealt with for an offence. He acknowledges going, he does not acknowledge sitting down, he acknowledges an offence, he should be dealt with for an offence. He acknowledges going, he acknowledges sitting down, he does not acknowledge an offence, he should be dealt with for sitting down. He acknowledges going, he does not acknowledge sitting down, he does not acknowledge an offence, he should not be dealt with. He does not acknowledge going, he acknowledges sitting down, he acknowledges an offence, he should be dealt with for an offence. He does not acknowledge going, he does not acknowledge sitting down, but he acknowledges an offence, he should be dealt with for an offence. He does not acknowledge going, he acknowledges sitting, he does not acknowledge an offence, he should be dealt with for sitting down. He does not acknowledge going, he does not acknowledge sitting down, he does not acknowledge an offence, he should not be dealt with.[^11]

Told is the Second Undetermined Offence

* * *

*Vin.3.194* *BD.1.340* Set forth, venerable ones, are the two undetermined matters. In this connection I ask the venerable ones: I hope that you are pure in this matter? A second time I ask: I hope that you are pure in this matter? A third time I ask: I hope that you are pure in this matter? The venerable ones are pure in this matter, therefore they are silent. Thus do I understand.

##### Its summary:

Convenient and so and likewise, but not thus,  
such undetermined matters are well pointed out by the best of Buddhas.

Told is the Undetermined
