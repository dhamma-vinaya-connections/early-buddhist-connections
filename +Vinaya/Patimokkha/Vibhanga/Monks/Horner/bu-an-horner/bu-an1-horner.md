# Monks’ Undetermined (_Aniyata_) 1

*BD.1.330* *Bu-An.1.1.1* At one time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s park in the Jeta Grove. At that time the venerable Udāyin was dependent on families in Sāvatthī and approached many families. Now at that time the young girl of a family who was supporting the venerable Udāyin had been given (in marriage) to a boy of a certain family. Then the venerable Udāyin, getting up early and taking his bowl and robe; approached that family, and having approached them he asked the people:

“Where is (the girl) called so and so?” They said:

“Honoured sir, she was given to a boy of a certain family.” Now this family supported the venerable Udāyin. Then the venerable Udāyin approached this family, and having approached them he asked the people:

“Where is (the girl) called so and so?” They said:

“Master, she is sitting in the inner room.”

Then the venerable Udāyin approached this girl, and having approached her, he sat down together with that girl, a man and a woman, in a secret place on a secluded, convenient seat,[^1] conversing at the right time, speaking _dhamma_ at the right time.[^2]

Now at that time Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, had many children and many grandchildren.[^3] The children were *BD.1.331* healthy and the grandchildren were healthy and she was considered to be auspicious.[^4] People used to regale Visākhā first at sacrifices, festivals[^5] and feasts.[^6] So Visākhā, being invited, went to that family. Visākhā saw the venerable Udāyin sitting together with that girl, a man and a woman,[^7] in a secret place on a secluded, convenient seat. Seeing this, she said to the venerable Udāyin:

“This is not proper, honoured sir, it is not suitable that the master should sit together with women-folk, a man and a woman, in a secret place on a secluded, convenient seat. *Vin.3.188* Although, honoured sir, the master has no desire for that thing,[^8] unbelieving people are difficult to convince.”[^9]

But the venerable Udāyin took no heed after he had been spoken to thus by Visākhā. Then Visākhā, when she had departed, told this matter to the monks. Those who were modest monks became annoyed, vexed, angry and said:

“How can the venerable Udāyin sit together with womenfolk, a man and a woman, in a secret place on a secluded, convenient seat?” And these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:

“Is it true, as is said, Udāyin, that you sat together with womenfolk, a man and a woman, in a secret place on a secluded, convenient seat?”

“It is true, lord,” he said.

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying: “How can you, foolish man, sit together with womenfolk, a man with a woman, in a secret place on a secluded, convenient seat? It is not, foolish man, for the benefit of unbelievers … And thus, monks, this course of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk should sit down together with a *BD.1.332* woman, the one with the other, in a secret place on a secluded, convenient seat, and if a trustworthy[^10] woman lay-follower seeing him should speak concerning a certain one of three matters: either one involving defeat,[^11] or one entailing a formal meeting of the Order,[^12] or one involving expiation,[^13] and the monk himself acknowledging that he was sitting down, should be dealt with according to a certain one of three matters: as to whether it is one involving defeat, or as to whether it is one entailing a formal meeting of the Order, or as to whether it is one involving expiation. Or that monk should be dealt with according to what that trustworthy woman lay-follower should say. This is an undetermined matter.”[^14]
