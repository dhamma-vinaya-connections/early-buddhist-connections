# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 2

*Bu-Pc.2.1.1* *BD.2.171* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time, the group of six monks, quarrelling with well behaved monks, insulted the well behaved monks; they jeered at them, they scoffed at them about birth and name and clan and work and craft and disease and distinguishing mark and passion[^1] and attainment[^2] and low mode of address.[^3] Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:

“How can this group of six monks, quarrelling with well behaved monks, *Vin.4.5* insult the well behaved monks? How can they jeer at them, scoff at them about birth … low mode of address?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, quarrelling with well behaved monks, insulted the well behaved monks, jeered at them … about low mode of address?”

“It is true, lord,” they said.

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How can you, foolish men, quarrelling with well behaved monks, insult the well behaved monks, jeer *BD.2.172* at them, scoff at them about … low mode of address? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” And having rebuked them and given _dhamma_\-talk, he addressed the monks, saying:

* * *

*Bu-Pc.2.1.2* “Formerly, monks, at Takkasilā,[^4] Nandivisāla was the name of an ox belonging to a certain brahmin. Then, monks, Nandivisāla, the ox, spoke thus to the brahmin: ‘Brahmin, you go, bet a thousand[^5] with the great merchant,[^6] saying: “My ox will draw a hundred carts tied together.”’ Then, monks, that brahmin made a bet of a thousand with the great merchant, saying: ‘My ox will draw a hundred carts tied together.’ Then, monks, that brahmin having tied together a hundred carts, having yoked Nandivisāla, the ox, spoke thus: ‘Go, hornless one,[^7] let the hornless one pull them along.’[^8] Then, monks, Nandivisāla, the ox, stood just where he was. Then, monks, that brahmin, having suffered the loss[^9] of a thousand, was overcome by grief.[^10] Then, monks, Nandivisāla, the ox, spoke thus to the brahmin: ‘Why are you, brahmin, overcome by grief?’

‘Because I, good sir,[^11] suffered the loss of a thousand through you.’

‘But why do you, brahmin, bring me, who am not hornless, into disgrace with words of deceit?[^12] Brahmin, you go, bet two thousand with the great merchant, saying: “My ox will draw a hundred carts tied together,” but do not bring me, who am not hornless, into disgrace with words of deceit.’

Then, monks, that brahmin bet two thousand with the great merchant, saying: ‘My ox will draw a hundred carts tied together.’ Then, monks, that brahmin having *BD.2.173* tied together a hundred carts, having yoked Nandivisala, the ox, spoke thus: ‘Go, good creature,[^13] let the good creature pull them along.’ Then, monks, Nandivisala, the ox, drew the hundred carts tied together.

> Speak only words of kindness,[^14]  
> never words unkind.  
> For him who spoke him fair, he moved  
> A heavy load, and brought him wealth, for love. *Vin.4.6*

At that time, monks, jeering and scoffing were not liked by me, so however could jeering and scoffing become liked now? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“In insulting speech[^15] there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bu-Pc.2.2.1* Insulting speech means: he insults in ten ways: about birth and name and clan and work and craft and disease find distinguishing mark and passion and attainment and mode of address.

Birth means: there are two kinds of birth: low birth and high birth. Low birth means: birth as (a member of) a despised class,[^16] birth as a bamboo-plaiter,[^17] birth as a hunter,[^18] birth as a cartwright,[^19] birth as a refuse- *BD.2.174* scavenger[^20]—this means low birth. High birth means: birth as a noble, birth as a brahmin—this means high birth.

Name means: there are two (kinds of) name: low name and high name. Low name means: Avakaṇṇaka,[^21] Javakaṇṇaka, Dhaniṭṭhaka, Saviṭṭhaka, Kulavaḍḍhaka, or what is disdained,[^22] disregarded,[^23] scorned,[^24] treated with contempt,[^25] despised[^26] in these districts—this means low name. High name means: connected with the enlightened one,[^27] connected with _dhamma_, connected with the Order, or what is not disdained, not disregarded, not scorned, not treated with contempt, what is esteemed in these districts—this means high name.

Clan[^28] means: there are two (kinds of) clan: low clan *BD.2.175* and high clan. Low clan means: a Kosiya clan,[^29] a Bharadvāja clan,[^30] or what is disdained, disregarded, scorned, treated with contempt, despised in these districts—this means low clan. High clan means: a Gotama[^31] clan, a Moggallāna clan, a Kaccāyana clan,[^32] a Vāsiṭṭha clan,[^33] or what is not disdained … what is esteemed in these districts—this means high clan.

Work means: there are two (kinds of) work: low work and high work. Low work means: work of a store-room (keeper),[^34] work of a flower-scavenger,[^35] or what is disdained … despised in these districts—this means low work. High work means: agriculture,[^36] trade,[^37] cattle-keeping,[^38] or what is not disdained … what is esteemed in these districts[^39]—this means high work.

*BD.2.176* Craft[^40] means: there are two (kinds of) craft: low craft and high *Vin.4.7* craft. Low craft means: the craft of the basket-maker,[^41] the potter’s craft, the weaver’s craft, the leather-worker’s[^42] craft, the barber’s craft, or what is disdained … despised in these districts—this means low craft. High craft means: reckoning on the fingers,[^43] calculation,[^44] *BD.2.177* writing,[^45] what is not disdained … what is esteemed in these districts—this means high craft.

All diseases are low, except that diabetes[^46] is a high (kind of) disease.

Distinguishing mark[^47] means: there are two (kinds of) distinguishing mark: low distinguishing mark and high distinguishing mark. Low distinguishing mark means: (being) very tall, very short, very dark, very fair—this means low distinguishing mark. High distinguishing mark means: not (being) very tall, very short, very dark, very fair—this means high distinguishing mark.

All passions[^48] are low.

All attainments[^49] are low, except that stream-attainment and higher attainment[^50] are high.

Mode of address[^51] means: there are two modes of *BD.2.178* address: low mode of address and high mode of address. Low mode of address means: he says, “You are a camel, you are a ram, you are an ox, you are an ass, you are an animal, you are (destined) for a state of woe,[^52] a good bourn is not for you, but a bad bourn is to be expected for you,” or by adding _ya_ or _bha_ (to the end of his name),[^53] or by calling him male and female[^54]—this means low mode of address. High mode of address means: he says, “You are learned, you are experienced, you are wise, you are clever, you are a speaker of _dhamma_,[^55] a bad bourn is not for you, but a good bourn is to be expected for you”—this means high mode of address.
