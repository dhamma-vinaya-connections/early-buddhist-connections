# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 18

*Bu-Pc.18.1.1* *BD.2.254* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that *Vin.4.46* time two monks (were) in a lofty cell with an upper part,[^1] in a dwelling-place belonging to the Order; one lived below, one above. The monk above sat down suddenly on a couch with removable feet.[^2] The foot of the couch, falling off,[^3] hit[^4] the lower monk on the head, (and) this monk uttered a cry of distress. Monks, running up, said to this monk:

“Why do you, your reverence, utter a cry of distress?”

Then that monk told this matter to the monks. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:

“How can a monk, in a lofty cell with an upper part, in a dwelling-place belonging to the Order, sit down suddenly on a couch with removable feet?”

Then these monks told this matter to the lord…

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, in a lofty cell with an upper part, in a dwelling-place belonging to the Order, sat down suddenly on a couch with removable feet?” …

*BD.2.255* “… It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk, in a lofty cell with an upper part, in a dwelling-place belonging to the Order, should sit down[^5] or lie down on a couch or chair with removable feet, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bu-Pc.18.2.1* Whatever means: … is monk to be understood in this case.

Dwelling-place belonging to the Order means: it comes to be given to the Order, handed over to it.[^6]

Lofty cell means: it does not touch the head[^7] of a man of medium height.

Couch with removable feet means: having perforated[^8] the legs, it stands.

Chair with removable feet means: having perforated the legs, it stands.

Should sit down on means: if he sits down on it, there is an offence of expiation.

Should lie down on means: if he lies down on it, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.18.2.2* If he thinks that it belongs to the Order when it belongs to the Order, (and) sits down on or lies down on a couch or a chair with removable feet in a lofty cell with an upper part, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it belongs to the Order … If he thinks that it belongs to an individual *BD.2.256* when it belongs to the Order … with an upper part, there is an offence of expiation. If he thinks that it belongs to the Order when it belongs to an individual, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it belongs to an individual, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it belongs to an individual when it belongs to an individual (but) to another individual, there is an offence of wrong-doing; if it belongs to the individual himself, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.18.2.3* There is no offence if he is in a cell that is not lofty[^9]; if he is in one that touches the head; if the one below comes to be not in use; if there comes to be an accumulation of boards[^10]; if a pin is provided[^11]; if standing on it he takes down from or hangs up on[^12]; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.
