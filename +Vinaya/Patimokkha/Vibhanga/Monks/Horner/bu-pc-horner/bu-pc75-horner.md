# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 75

*Bu-Pc.75.1.1* *BD.3.49* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks, angry, displeased, *Vin.4.147* raised the palm of the hand[^1] against the group of seventeen monks.[^2] These, frightened of a blow,[^3] cried out. Monks spoke thus: “Why do you, your reverences, cry out?”

“Your reverences, this group of six monks, angry, displeased, raised the palm of the hand against us.” Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six monks, angry, displeased, raise the palm of the hand against the group of seventeen monks?” …

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, angry, displeased, raised the palm of the hand against the group of seventeen monks?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How can you, foolish men, angry, displeased, raise the palm of the hand against the group of seventeen monks? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth: *BD.3.50* Whatever monk, angry, displeased, should raise the palm of the hand against a monk, there is an offence of expiation.”[^4]

* * *

*Bu-Pc.75.2.1* Whatever means: … monk is to be understood in this case.

Against a monk means: against another monk.

Angry, displeased means: … stubborn.[^5]

Should raise the palm of the hand means: if he lifts up[^6] the body or something attached to the body, and even at most a lotus-leaf,[^7] there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.75.2.2* If he thinks that one is ordained when he is ordained, (and) angry, displeased, raises the palm of the hand … see *Bu-Pc.74.2*… There is no offence if, being in some difficulty, he raises the palm of the hand desiring freedom; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.
