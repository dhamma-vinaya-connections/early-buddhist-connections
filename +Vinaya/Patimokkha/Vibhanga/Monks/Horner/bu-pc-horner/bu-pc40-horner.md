# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 40

*Bu-Pc.40.1.1* *BD.2.344* … at Vesālī in the Great Grove in the Hall of the Gabled Pillars. Now at that time a certain monk, wearing robes made entirely of rags, was staying in a cemetery. He did not want to accept gifts[^1] from people. And himself taking (food) put down for the departed masters[^2] in a cemetery and at the foot of a tree and on a threshold,[^3] he ate it. People … spread it about, saying:

“How can this monk, himself taking (food) put down for our departed masters, eat it? This monk is strong,[^4] he is fat,[^5] for certain he eats meat (belonging to) people.”[^6]

Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:

“How can a monk convey to his mouth[^7] nutriment not given?” …

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, conveyed to your mouth nutriment not given?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:

“How can you, foolish man, convey to your mouth nutriment not given? It is not, foolish man, for *BD.2.345* pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth: *Vin.4.90*

“Whatever monk should convey to his mouth nutriment not given, there is an offence of expiation.”

And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.40.2.1* Now at that time monks were scrupulous in regard to water for cleansing the teeth.[^8] They told this matter to the lord. He said:

“I allow you, monks, yourselves having taken water for cleansing the teeth, to partake of it. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk should convey to his mouth nutriment not given, except water for cleansing the teeth, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bu-Pc.40.3.1* Whatever means: … is monk to be understood in this case.

Not given means: it is called not accepted.[^9]

Given means: if in giving by means of the body or by means of something attached to the body[^10] or by means of something that may be cast,[^11] standing within a reach of the hand, if he accepts by means of the body or by means of something attached to the body,[^12] this is called given.

Nutriment means: setting aside water for cleansing the teeth, whatever is fit to eat, this is called nutriment.

Except water for cleansing the teeth means: setting aside water for cleansing the teeth.

If he takes it, thinking: ‘I will eat, I will partake of,’ *BD.2.346* there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.40.3.2* If he thinks that it is not accepted when it is not accepted (and) conveys to his mouth nutriment that is not given, except water for cleansing the teeth, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not accepted … If he thinks that it is accepted when it is not accepted … offence of expiation. If he thinks that it is not accepted when it is accepted, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is accepted, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is accepted when it is accepted, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.40.3.3* There is no offence in regard to water for cleansing the teeth; if himself, having taken the four foul things,[^13] he makes use of them when there is a reason (and if) there is no one to make them allowable[^14]; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.

The Tenth

##### This is its key:

A meal, a joint (meal), an out-of-turn (meal),[^15]  
a cake, and two on having eaten, being satisfied,  
At the wrong time, storing, milk,  
with water for cleansing the teeth—these ten.

The Fourth Division: that on Food *Vin.4.91*
