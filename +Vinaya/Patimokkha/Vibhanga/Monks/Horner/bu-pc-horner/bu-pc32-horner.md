# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 32

*Bu-Pc.32.1.1* *BD.2.306* … at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding-place. Now at that time[^1] Devadatta, gain and honour lost,[^2] ate with his friends, having asked and asked[^3] among households. People … spread it about, saying:

“How can the recluses, sons of the Sakyans, eat, having asked and asked among households? Who is not fond of well-cooked things? Who does not like sweet things?”[^4]

Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:

“How can Devadatta eat with his friends, having asked and asked among households?” …

“Is it true, as is said, that you, Devadatta, ate with your friends, having asked and asked among households?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:

“How can you, foolish man, eat with your friends, having asked and asked among households? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

*BD.2.307* In a group-meal,[^5] there is an offence of expiation.”

And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord. *Vin.4.72*

* * *

*Bu-Pc.32.2.1* Now at that time people invited ill monks to a meal. The monks, being scrupulous, did not consent, saying: “A group-meal is forbidden by the lord.” They told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:

“I allow you, monks, when a monk is ill to eat a group-meal. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

In a group-meal, except at a right time, there is an offence of expiation. In this case a right time is a time of illness; this is a right time in this case.”

And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.32.3.1* Now at that time people, at the time of giving robes, having prepared a meal with the robes, invited monks, saying: “Having offered food, we will clothe (you) with robes.” The monks, being scrupulous, did not consent, saying: “A group-meal is forbidden by the lord.” *BD.2.308* Little robe-material accrued (to them).[^6] They told this matter to the lord. He said:

“I allow you, monks, at a time of giving robes, to eat a group-meal.[^7] And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

In a group-meal, except at a right time, there is an offence of expiation. In this case a right time is a time of illness, a time of giving robes; this is a right time in this case.”

And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.32.4.1* Now at that time people, at the (time of) making robes,[^8] invited monks to a meal. The monks, being scrupulous, did not consent, saying: “A group-meal is forbidden by the lord.” They told this matter to the lord. He said:

“I allow you, monks, at a time of making robes, to eat a group-meal. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

In a group-meal, except at a right time, there is an offence of expiation. In this case a right time is a time of illness, a time of giving robes, a time of making robes; this is a right time in this case.”

And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.32.5.1* Now at one time monks *Vin.4.73* were going on a journey together with (some) men. Then these monks said to these men:

“Sirs, wait a moment, we will go for alms-food.” These said:

“Honoured sirs, eat just here.” The monks, being *BD.2.309* scrupulous, did not accept (food), saying: “A group-meal is forbidden by the lord.” They told this matter to the lord. He said:

“I allow you, monks, at a time of going on a journey, to eat a group-meal. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

In a group-meal, except at a right time, there is an offence of expiation. In this case a right time is a time of illness, a time of giving robes, a time of making robes, a time of going on a journey; this is a right time in this case.”

And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.32.6.1* Now at that time monks were going in a boat together with (some) men. Then these monks said to these men:

“Sirs, take us to the bank for a moment, we will go for alms-food.” These said:

“Honoured sirs, eat just here.” The monks, being scrupulous, did not accept (food), saying: “A group-meal is forbidden by the lord.” …

“I allow you, monks, at a time of being embarked in a boat, to eat a group-meal. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

In a group-meal, except at a right time, there is an offence of expiation. In this case a right time is a time of illness, a time of giving robes, a time of making robes, a time of going on a journey, a time of being embarked in a boat; this is a right time in this case.”

And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.32.7.1* Now at that time, monks having spent the rains in (various) districts,[^9] came to Rājagaha to see the lord. People, having seen the monks from various parts of *BD.2.310* the country,[^10] invited them to a meal. The monks, being scrupulous, did not consent.

“I allow you, monks, to eat a group-meal when there is a great scarcity.[^11] And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

In a group-meal, except at a right time, there is an offence of expiation. In this case a right time is a time of illness … a time of embarking in a boat, when there is a great scarcity; this is a right time in this case.”

And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord. *Vin.4.74*

* * *

*Bu-Pc.32.8.1* Now at one time a blood-relation of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha had gone forth among the Naked Ascetics. Then that Naked Ascetic approached King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, and having approached, he spoke thus to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha:

“I, sire, wish to make a meal for all heretics.”[^12]

“If, you, honoured sir, would first entertain the Order of monks with the enlightened one at their head, you might do this.”

Then that Naked Ascetic sent a messenger to the monks, saying:

“Let the monks consent to (take) a meal with me on the morrow.”

The monks, being scrupulous, did not consent, saying: “A group-meal is forbidden by the lord.” Then that Naked Ascetic approached the lord, and having approached he exchanged friendly greetings with the lord, and having exchanged greetings of friendliness *BD.2.311* and courtesy, he stood at a respectful distance. As he was standing at a respectful distance, that Naked Ascetic spoke thus to the lord:

“The revered Gotama is gone forth; I, too, am gone forth. One who has gone forth is worthy to accept the alms-food of one who has gone forth. Let the revered Gotama consent to (take) a meal with me on the morrow together with the Order of monks.”

The lord consented by becoming silent. Then that Naked Ascetic, having obtained the lord’s consent, departed. Then the lord, on that occasion, in that connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:

“I allow you, monks, to eat a group-meal at a meal-time of recluses.[^13] And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“In a group-meal, except at a right time, there is an offence of expiation. In this case, a right time is a time of illness, a time of giving robes, a time of making robes, a time of going on a journey, a time of being embarked in a boat, when there is a great scarcity, a meal-time of recluses; this is a right time in this case.”

* * *

*Bu-Pc.32.9.1* Group-meal means: when four monks eat, invited to any one meal of the five (kinds of) meals, this is called a group-meal.

Except at a right time means: setting a right time to one side.

Time of illness means: even when the feet become split[^14]; this means that at a time of illness (a group-meal) may be eaten.

Time of giving robes means: the last month of the rainy season when the _kaṭhina_ cloth is not (formally) *BD.2.312* made, the five months when the _kaṭhina_ cloth is (formally) made[^15]; this means that at the time of giving robes (a group-meal) may be eaten.

Time of making robes means: when the robes are being made; this means that at the time of making robes (a group-meal) may be eaten. *Vin.4.75*

Time of going on a journey means: if he thinks: “I will go for half a _yojana_,” (a group-meal) may be eaten, it may be eaten by him going out, it may be eaten by him coming in.[^16]

Time of being embarked in a boat means: if he thinks: “I will embark in a boat,” (a group-meal) may be eaten, it may be eaten by him embarking, it may be eaten by him disembarking.

A great scarcity means: when two or three monks, walking for alms-food, keep themselves going, (but) when a fourth has come they do not keep themselves going; this means that when there is a great scarcity (a group-meal) may be eaten.

Meal-time of recluses means: whoever makes a meal, being one who has attained (to the stage of) a wanderer,[^17] this means that at the meal-time of recluses (a group-meal) may be eaten.

If, except at the right time, he accepts (food), thinking, “I will eat,” there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.32.9.2* If he thinks that it is a group-meal when it is a group-meal, (and) eats, except at a right time, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it is a group-meal … If he thinks that it is not a group-meal when it is a group-meal … offence of expiation. If he thinks that it is a group-meal when it is not a group-meal, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not a group-meal, *BD.2.313* there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not a group-meal when it is not a group-meal, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.32.9.3* There is no offence if it is at a right time; if two or three eat together[^18]; if having walked one by one for alms, they eat having assembled together; if it is the regular supply of food; if it is food (allowed by) ticket[^19]; if it is (food given) on a day of the waxing or waning of the moon,[^20] if it is (given) on an Observance day,[^21] if *BD.2.314* it is (given) on the day after an Observance day[^22]; setting aside the five (kinds of) meals, there is no offence in (eating) any other[^23]; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.
