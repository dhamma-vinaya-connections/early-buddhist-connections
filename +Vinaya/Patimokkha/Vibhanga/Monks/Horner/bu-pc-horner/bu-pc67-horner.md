# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 67

*Bu-Pc.67.1.1* *BD.3.18* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a certain monk, going to Sāvatthī through the Kosalan districts, passed by a certain village-gate. A certain woman, having quarrelled with her husband, having departed from the village, having seen that monk, spoke thus: “Where, honoured sir, will the master go?”

“I, sister, will go to Sāvatthī.”

“I will go together with the master.”

“If you wish to,[^1] sister,” he said.

Then that woman’s husband, having departed from the village, asked people: “Have the masters seen such and such a woman?”[^2]

“She, master, is going along with one who has gone forth.” Then that man, having followed after, having seized that monk, having thrashed him, set him free. Then that monk, incensed,[^3] sat down at the foot of a certain tree. Then that woman spoke thus to that man:

“Master, that monk did not make me come out[^4]; but it is I myself who am going along together with this monk. This monk is innocent[^5]; go along, apologise to him.” Then that man apologised to that monk. Then that monk, having arrived at Sāvatthī, told this matter to the monks. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:

*BD.3.19* “How can a monk, having arranged together with a woman, go along the same high road?” …

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, *Vin.4.133* having arranged together with a woman, went along the same high road?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:

“How can you, foolish man, having arranged together with a woman, go along the same high road? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk, having arranged together with a woman, should go along the same high road, even among villages, there is an offence of expiation.”[^6]

* * *

*Bu-Pc.67.2.1* Whatever means: … monk is to be understood in this case.

Woman means: a human woman, not a female _yakkha_, not a female departed one, not a female animal; she is intelligent, competent to know good speech, bad speech, what is lewd, what is not lewd.[^7]

Together with means: together.[^8]

Having arranged means: if one arranges, saying, ‘We are going, sister, we are going, master, we are going, master, we are going, sister, we are going either today or … see *Bu-Pc.27.3.1*; *Bu-Pc.66.2.1*.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.67.2.2* If he thinks that it is a woman when it is a woman, (and) having arranged, goes along the same high road, even among villages, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it is a woman … If he thinks that it is not a woman when it is a woman … offence of expiation. If the monk arranges (and) the woman does not arrange, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If, having arranged, he goes along the same *BD.3.20* high road together with a female _yakkha_ or a female departed one or with a eunuch or with an animal in the form of a human woman,[^9] even among villages, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is a woman when it is not a woman, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not a woman, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not a woman when it is not a woman there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.67.2.3* There is no offence if he goes not having arranged; if the woman arranges (and) the monk does not arrange; if he goes without (making) a rendezvous; if there are accidents; if he is mad, if he is the first wrongdoer.[^10]
