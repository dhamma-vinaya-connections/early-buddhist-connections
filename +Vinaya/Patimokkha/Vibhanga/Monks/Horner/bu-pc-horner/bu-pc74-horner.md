# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 74

*Bu-Pc.74.1.1* *BD.3.47* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that *Vin.4.146* time the group of six monks, angry, displeased, gave the group of seventeen monks[^1] a blow; these cried out. Monks spoke thus: “Why do you, your reverences, cry out?”

“Your reverences, this group of six monks, angry, displeased, gave us a blow.” Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six monks, angry, displeased, give monks a blow?” …

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, angry, displeased, gave monks a blow?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How can you, foolish men, angry, displeased, give monks a blow? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk, angry, displeased, should give a monk a blow, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bu-Pc.74.2.1* Whatever means: … monk is to be understood in this case.

A monk means: another monk.

Angry, displeased means: dissatisfied, the mind worsened, stubborn.[^2]

Should give a blow means: if he gives a blow with the body or with something attached to the body or with *BD.3.48* something that may be cast,[^3] and even with a lotus-leaf,[^4] there is an offence of expiation.[^5]

* * *

*Bu-Pc.74.2.2* If he thinks that one is ordained when he is ordained, (and) angry, displeased, gives a blow, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether one is ordained … If he thinks that one is not ordained when he is ordained, (and) angry, displeased … offence of expiation. If angry, displeased, he gives a blow to one who is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that one is ordained when he is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether one is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that one is not ordained when he is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.[^6]

* * *

*Bu-Pc.74.2.3* There is no offence if, being in some difficulty, he gives a blow desiring freedom[^7]; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.

The Fourth
