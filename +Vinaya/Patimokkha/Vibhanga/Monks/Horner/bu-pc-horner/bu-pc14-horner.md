# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 14

*Bu-Pc.14.1.1* *BD.2.238* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time, monks preparing lodgings[^1] in winter-time in the open air, drying their bodies in the sun, when the time was announced,[^2] setting forth neither removed[^3] them nor had them removed, (but) set forth without having asked (for permission).[^4] The lodgings became damp.[^5] Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:

“How can monks, preparing lodgings in the open air, setting forth, neither remove them nor have them removed, (but) set forth without having asked (for permission, so that) the lodgings are (left) damp?”

Then these monks told this matter to the lord …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks preparing lodgings in the open air … (left) damp? … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk, spreading[^6] or having spread in the *BD.2.239* open air a couch or a chair or a mattress or a stool[^7] belonging to the Order, setting forth, should neither remove it nor have it removed, or should go away without asking (for permission), there is an offence of expiation.”

And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.14.1.2* Now at that time monks, staying in the open air, were bringing back[^8] lodgings early in the morning. Now the lord saw these monks bringing back lodgings early in the morning, and seeing them, in this connection, on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:

“I allow you, monks, for the eight months (of the time) not appointed for keeping the rains[^9] *Vin.4.40* to put aside lodgings in a hut[^10] or at the foot of a tree, wherever crows or vultures do not leave droppings.”[^11]

* * *

*Bu-Pc.14.2.1* Whatever means: … is monk to be understood in this case.

Belonging to the Order means: it comes to be given to the Order, handed over to it.[^12]

*BD.2.240* Couch means:[^13] there are four (kinds of) couch: a long one,[^14] one with slats,[^15] one with curved legs,[^16] one with removable legs.[^17]

Chair means: there are four (kinds of) chair: a long one, one with slats, one with curved legs, one with removable legs.[^18]

Mattress means: there are five (kinds of) mattress: a mattress (made) of wool, a mattress (made) of cotton-cloth, a mattress (made) of bark, a mattress (made) of tina-grass, a mattress (made) of leaves.[^19]

Stool means: made of bark or made of khus-khus[^20] or made of _muñja_\-grass or made of reeds[^21]; it is bound, having tucked them in.[^22]

Spreading means: himself spreading.

*BD.2.241* Having spread[^23] means: making another spread. If he makes one who is not ordained spread (it), it is an impediment[^24] for him.[^25] If he makes one who is ordained spread it, there is an impediment for the one who spreads (it).[^26]

Setting forth, should neither remove it means: should not himself remove it.

Nor have it removed means: should not make another remove it.

Or should go away without asking (for permission) means: not asking a monk or a novice or a monastery attendant (for permission),[^27] if he goes further than the outward stone-throw of a man of average height,[^28] there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.14.2.2* If he thinks that it belongs to the Order[^29] when it belongs to the Order, spreading it or having it spread in the open, setting forth should neither remove it nor have it removed, or should go away without asking (for permission), there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it belongs to the Order … there is an offence of expiation. If he thinks that it belongs to an individual when it belongs to the Order, spreading it or … in the open air … without having asked (for permission), there is an offence of expiation. If it is a carpet[^30] or a bed-cover[^31] or a ground- *BD.2.242* covering[^32] or a straw-mat[^33] or an animal’s skin[^34] or a mat for the feet[^35] or a wooden chair,[^36] spreading it or having it spread in the open air, setting forth should neither remove it nor have it removed, or should go away without having asked (for permission), there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it belongs to the Order when it belongs to an individual, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it belongs to an individual, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it belongs to an individual when it belongs to an individual (but) to another individual, there is an offence of wrong-doing; if it belongs to the individual himself, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.14.2.3* There is no offence if, having removed it, he goes away; if, having caused it to be removed, he goes away; if, having asked (for permission), he goes away; if, drying himself in the sun, he goes away[^37]; if it comes to be taken possession of by something[^38]; if there are accidents[^39]; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.
