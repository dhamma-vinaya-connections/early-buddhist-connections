# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 8

*Bu-Pc.8.1.1* *BD.2.208* … at Vesālī in the pavilion of the Gabled Hall in the Great Grove. Now at that time[^1] many monks who were friends and companions went for the rains to the banks of the river Vaggumudā. At that time Vajji was short of alms-food, which was difficult to obtain; it was suffering from a famine, and food-tickets were being issued. Nor was it easy to keep oneself going by gleaning or by favour. Then these monks said to one another:

“At present Vajjī is short of alms-food … Nor is it easy to keep oneself going by gleaning or by favour. What now if we, by some strategem, all together, being on friendly terms and harmonious, should spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of alms-food?”

Some spoke thus: “Look, your reverences, we could superintend the business of householders, thus they will think to give to us; thus we, all together, being on friendly terms and harmonious, will spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of alms-food.”

Some spoke thus: “Enough, your reverences, of super-intending the business of householders. Look, your reverences, we will execute householders’ commissions, thus they will think to give to us; thus we, all together, being on friendly terms and harmonious, will spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of alms-food.”

Some spoke thus: “Enough, your reverences, of super-intending the business of householders and of executing householders’ commissions. Look, your reverences, we will speak praise to householders concerning this or that *BD.2.209* condition of further-men, saying: ‘Such a monk is possessed of the first *Vin.4.24* musing, such a monk is possessed of the second musing, such a monk is possessed of the third musing, such a monk is possessed of the fourth musing, such a monk is a stream-attainer, such a monk is a once-returner, such a monk is a non-returner, such a monk is man perfected, such a monk is a three-fold wisdom man, such a monk is a sixfold super-knowledge man.’ Thus these (householders) will think to give to us; thus we, all together, being on friendly terms and harmonious, will spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of alms-food. It is better, your reverences, to speak praise to householders concerning this or that condition of further-men.”

Then these monks spoke praise to householders concerning this or that condition of further-men, saying, “Such a monk is possessed of the first musing … such a monk is a sixfold super-knowledge man.” Then these (men) thought: “Surely we have gained, surely there is a profit for us that such monks have come to us for the rains. Surely such monks as these monks, virtuous and of good character, never came to us for the rains before.” Accordingly these did not on their own account eat meals—they gave not to parents, they gave not to wife and children, they gave not to slave or servant, they gave not to friend or colleague, they gave not to blood-relations, as they gave to the monks. Accordingly these did not on their own account take savoury solid foods or drinks—they gave not to parents, they gave not to wife and children, they gave not to slave or servant, they gave not to friend or colleague, they gave not to blood-relations, as they gave to the monks. Thus these monks became handsome, of rounded features, their complexions bright, their skins clear.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.8.1.2* Now it was the custom for monks who had finished keeping the rains to go and see the lord. Then these monks who had finished keeping the rains, the three months having elapsed, packing away their bedding *BD.2.210* taking their bowls and robes, went up to Vesālī. In the course of time they came up to Vesālī, the Great Grove, the pavilion of the Gabled Hall, and to the lord, and having approached the lord, they greeted him and sat down at a respectful distance. At that time the monks who had spent the rains in those regions had become lean, wretched, of a bad colour, having become very yellow, their veins standing out all over their bodies; but the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā had become handsome, of rounded features, their complexions bright, their skins clear. Now it was the custom for enlightened ones, for lords, to exchange friendly greetings with in-coming monks. So the lord said to the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā: *Vin.4.25*

“I hope, monks, that things went well with you, I hope that you had enough to support life, I hope that, all together, being on friendly terms and harmonious, you spent a comfortable rainy season and did not go short of alms-food?”

“Things did go well with us, lord, we had enough to support life, lord, and all together we, lord, being on friendly terms and harmonious, spent a comfortable rainy season and did not go short of alms-food.”

Tathāgatas knowing (sometimes) ask; knowing (sometimes) do not ask; they ask, knowing the right time (to ask), and they do not ask, knowing the right time (when not to ask). Tathāgatas ask about what belongs to the goal, not about what does not belong to the goal; the breaking of the bridge of the Tathāgatas is among what does not belong to the goal. Enlightened ones, lords, question monks concerning two matters, either: “Shall we teach _dhamma_?” or, “Shall we make known a rule of training for disciples?”

Then the lord spoke thus to the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā:

“In what way did you, monks, all together, being on friendly terms and harmonious, spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of alms-food?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord.

*BD.2.211* “Indeed, monks, I wonder if that is a fact?”

“It is a fact,[^2] lord,” they said.

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How can you, monks, for the sake of your stomachs, speak praise to householders concerning this or that condition of further-men? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk should speak of a condition of further-men to one who is not ordained—if it is a fact,[^3] there is an offence of expiation.”
