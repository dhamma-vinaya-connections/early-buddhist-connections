# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 56

*Bu-Pc.56.1.1* *BD.2.398* … was staying in the Bhagga country at Crocodile Hill[^1] in Bhesakala grove[^2] in the deer-park. Now at that time monks, kindling in the winter time a fire of large hollow logs, warmed themselves.[^3] And in that hollow a dark poisonous snake[^4] was scorched by the fire; issuing forth, he pursued the monks. The monks ran about here and there.[^5] Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:

“How can these monks, kindling a fire, warm themselves?” …

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, kindling a fire, warmed yourselves?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can these foolish men, kindling a fire, warm themselves? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk, desirous of warming himself, should kindle or should cause a fire to be kindled, there is an offence of expiation.”

*BD.2.399* And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.56.1.2* Now at that time monks became ill. Monks, inquiring after the ill ones, spoke thus to the ill monks: “We hope that your reverences are better, we hope that you are keeping going.”

“Formerly, your reverences, we, kindling a fire, used to warm ourselves; thus there came to be comfort for us. But now it is forbidden by the lord, (and) being scrupulous, we do not warm ourselves; thus there comes to be no comfort for us.”[^6]

They told this matter to the lord. He said:

“I allow you, monks, when a monk is ill, kindling or causing a fire to be kindled, to warm yourselves. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk, not being ill, desirous of warming himself, should kindle *Vin.4.116* or should cause a fire to be kindled, there is an offence of expiation.”

And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.56.2.1* Now at that time monks, being scrupulous, did not light a lamp in the fire-room[^7] or in the bath-room.[^8] They told this matter to the lord. He said:

“I allow you, monks, to kindle or to cause a fire to be kindled when there is a sufficient reason for it.[^9] And thus … should be set forth:

“Whatever monk, not being ill, desirous of warming himself, should kindle or should cause a fire to be kindled, unless there is sufficient reason for it, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bu-Pc.56.3.1* Whatever means: … is monk to be understood in this case.

*BD.2.400* Not being ill means: he for whom there comes to be comfort without a fire.

Ill means: he for whom there does not come to be comfort without a fire.

Desirous of warming himself means: wishing to heat himself.[^10]

A fire[^11] means: what is called a fire.[^12]

Should kindle means: if he himself kindles, there is an offence of expiation.

Should cause to be kindled means: if he commands another, there is an offence of expiation. When once commanded, if he kindles much, there is an offence of expiation.

Unless there is a sufficient reason for it means: setting aside a sufficient reason for it.[^13]

* * *

*Bu-Pc.56.3.2* If he thinks that he is not ill when he is not ill, (and) desirous of warming himself, kindles or causes a fire to be kindled, unless there is a sufficient reason for it, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether he is not ill … If he thinks that he is ill when he is not ill … offence of expiation. If he picks up a fallen fire-brand,[^14] there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that he is not ill when he is ill, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that he is ill when he is ill, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.56.3.3* There is no offence if he is ill; if he warms himself at one made by another; if he warms himself over raked-out embers[^15]; if at a lamp, in a fire-room, in a bath-room; if there is a sufficient reason for it; if there are dangers[^16]; if he is mad; if he is the first wrong-doer.
