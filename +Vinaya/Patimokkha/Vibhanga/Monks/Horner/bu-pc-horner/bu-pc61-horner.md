# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 61

*Bu-Pc.61.1.1* *Vin.4.124* *BD.3.1* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at one time the venerable Udāyin[^1] was an archer,[^2] and crows were unpleasant to him. He, having shot crows, having cut off their heads, put them in a row on a stake. Monks spoke thus:

“By whom, your reverence, were these crows deprived of life?’”

“By me, your reverences; crows are unpleasant to me.” Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:

“How can the venerable Udāyin intentionally deprive a living thing of life?” …

“Is it true, as is said, that you, Udāyin, intentionally deprived a living thing of life?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:

“How can you, foolish man, intentionally deprive a living thing of life? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk should intentionally deprive a living thing of life, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bu-Pc.61.2.1* Whatever means: … monk is to be understood in this case.

*BD.3.2* Intentionally means: a transgression committed knowingly, consciously, deliberately.[^3]

Living thing means: it is called a living thing that is an animal.[^4]

Should deprive of life means: if he cuts off the faculty of life, destroys it, harms its duration,[^5] there is an offence of expiation. *Vin.4.125*

* * *

*Bu-Pc.61.2.2* If he thinks that it is a living thing when it is a living thing, (and) deprives it of life, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it is a living thing, (and) deprives it of life, there is an offence of wrong-doing.[^6] If he thinks that it is not a living thing when it is a living thing, there is no offence. If he thinks that it is a living thing when it is not a living thing, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not a living thing, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not a living thing when it is not a living thing, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.61.2.3* There is no offence if it is unintentional; if (he is) not thinking; if he does not know; if he is not meaning death[^7]; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.
