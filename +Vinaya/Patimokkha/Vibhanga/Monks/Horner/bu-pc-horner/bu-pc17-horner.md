# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 17

*Vin.4.44* *Bu-Pc.17.1.1* *BD.2.250* … at Sāvatthī[^1] in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. At that time the group of seventeen monks were repairing a large dwelling-place in the neighbourhood,[^2] thinking: “We will spend the rains here.”

The group of six monks saw the group of seventeen monks as they were repairing the dwelling-place, and seeing them, they said:

“Your reverences, this group of seventeen monks are repairing a dwelling-place. Come, we will turn them away.”

Some spoke thus: “Wait, your reverences, until they have repaired it; when it is repaired, we will turn them away.”

Then the group of six monks said to the group of seventeen monks: “Go away,[^3] your reverences, the dwelling-place belongs to[^4] us.”

“Your reverences, should not this have been explained before, and we would have repaired another?”

“Your reverences, does not the dwelling-place belong to the Order?”

“Yes, your reverences, the dwelling-place belongs to the Order.”

“Go away, your reverences, the dwelling-place belongs to us.”

“Your reverences, the dwelling-place is big[^5]; you stay, and we too will stay.”

*BD.2.251* “Go away, your reverences, the dwelling-place belongs to us,” and angry, displeased, taking them by the throat they threw them out. These being thrown out, wept. Monks said (to them):

“Why do you, your reverences, weep?”

“Your reverences, this group of six monks, angry, displeased threw us out of a dwelling-place belonging to the Order.”

Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:

“How can this group of six monks, angry, displeased, throw out monks from a dwelling-place belonging to the Order?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord…

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that you, angry and displeased … to the Order?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How can you, foolish men, angry … belonging to the Order? Foolish men, it is not for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk, angry, displeased, should throw out a monk or cause him to be thrown out from a dwelling-place belonging to the Order, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bu-Pc.17.2.1* Whatever means: … is monk to be understood in this case. *Vin.4.45*

Monk[^6] means: another monk.

Angry, displeased[^7] means: dissatisfied, the mind worsened, stubborn.

A dwelling-place belonging to the Order means: it comes to be given to the Order, handed over to it.[^8]

Should throw out means: if, taking (him) in the room[^9] he throws him out on to the verandah,[^10] there is an *BD.2.252* offence of expiation. If, taking him on the verandah, he throws him outside,[^11] there is an offence of expiation. If, with one effort[^12] he makes him pass through many doors, there is an offence of expiation.

Should cause him to be thrown out means: if he commands another, there is an offence of wrong-doing. When once commanded, if he makes him pass through many doors, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.17.2.2* If he thinks that it belongs to the Order[^13] when it belongs to the Order, (and) angry, displeased, throws him out or causes him to be thrown out, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it belongs to the Order, (and) angry … causes him to be thrown out, there is an offence of expiation. If he thinks that it belongs to an individual when it belongs to the Order, (and) angry … to be thrown out, there is an offence of expiation. If he throws out or causes his requisites to be thrown out, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he throws (a monk) out or causes (him) to be thrown out from the precincts of a dwelling-place or from an assembly-room or from a hut or from the foot of a tree or from the open air, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he throws out or causes his requisites to be thrown out, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he throws out or causes one who is not ordained to be thrown out from a dwelling-place or from the precincts of a dwelling-place … or from the open air, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he throws out or causes his requisites to be thrown out, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it belongs to the Order when it belongs to an individual, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is doubtful as to whether it belongs to an individual, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it belongs to an individual when it belongs to an individual, (but) to another individual, there is an offence of wrong- *BD.2.253* doing; if it belongs to the individual himself, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.17.2.3* There is no offence if he throws out or causes one who is not scrupulous to be thrown out, if he throws out or causes his requisites to be thrown out; if he throws out or causes to be thrown out one who is mad, if he throws out or causes his requisites to be thrown out; if he throws out or causes to be thrown out one who makes strife, one who makes quarrels, one who makes contention, one who makes brawls, one who makes disputes in the Order,[^14] if he throws out or causes his requisites to be thrown out; if he throws out or causes to be thrown out a novice or one who shares a cell or one who is not proceeding fitly,[^15] if he throws out or causes his requisites to be thrown out; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.
