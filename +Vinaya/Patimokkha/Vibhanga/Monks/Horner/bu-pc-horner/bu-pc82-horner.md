# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 82

*Bu-Pc.82.1.1* *BD.3.67* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.[^1] Now at that time at Sāvatthī food with robe-material was prepared for the Order by a certain guild, saying: “Having offered food, we will present them with robe-material.” Then the group of six monks approached that guild, and having approached, they said to that guild: “Sirs, give these robes to these monks.”

“Honoured sirs, we will not give; almsfood with robes are made ready by us every year for the Order.”

“Sirs, many are the Order’s benefactors, many are the Order’s devotees. These (monks) are here depending on you, looking to you, but if you will not give to them, then *Vin.4.156* who is there who will give to them? Sirs, give these robes to these monks.”

Then that guild, being pressed by the group of six monks, giving the group of six monks as much robe-material as was prepared, served the Order with a meal. Those monks who knew that robe-material with a meal[^2] was prepared for the Order and did not know that it was given to the group of six monks, spoke thus:

“Sirs, dedicate robe-material to the Order.”

“Honoured sirs, there is none; the masters, the group of six monks appropriated to the masters, the group of six monks, as much robe-material as was prepared.”

Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:

“How can the group of six monks knowingly appropriate to an individual an apportioned benefit belonging to the Order?” …

*BD.3.68* “Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, knowingly appropriated to an individual an apportioned benefit belonging to the Order?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How can you, foolish men, knowingly appropriate to an individual an apportioned benefit belonging to the Order? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk should knowingly appropriate to an individual an apportioned benefit belonging to the Order, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bu-Pc.82.2.1* Whatever means: … monk is to be understood in this case.

He knows means: either he knows by himself or others tell him or (someone) tells him.

Belonging to the Order means: it comes to be given to the Order, handed over to it.

A benefit means: the requisites of robes, almsfood, lodgings, medicines for the sick, and even a lump of chunam and a toothpick and unwoven thread.

Apportioned means: if it has been expressly said: “We will give, we will make,” (and) he appropriates it to an individual, there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.82.2.2* If[^3] he thinks that it is apportioned when it is apportioned (and) appropriates it to an individual, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it is apportioned (and) appropriates it to an individual, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not apportioned when it is apportioned (and) appropriates it to an individual, there is no offence. If he appropriates what is apportioned to the Order for another (part of the) Order or for a shrine, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he appropriates what is *BD.3.69* apportioned to a shrine for another shrine or for the Order or for an individual, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he appropriates what is apportioned to an individual for another individual or for an Order or for a shrine, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is apportioned when it is not apportioned, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not apportioned, *Vin.4.157* there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not apportioned when it is not apportioned, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.82.2.3* There is no offence if he himself being asked, ‘Where do we give?’ says, ‘Give wherever your gift could be used or could be mended or should be for a long time or when for you the mind is peaceful;’ if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.

The Twelfth

##### This is its key:

Regarding a rule, and disparagement,  
causing confusion, striking a blow,[^4]  
The palm of the hand, and unfounded,  
intentionally, and overhearing,  
And preventing and consent,[^5] and on Dabba, appropriating.

The Eighth Division: that on regarding a rule.
