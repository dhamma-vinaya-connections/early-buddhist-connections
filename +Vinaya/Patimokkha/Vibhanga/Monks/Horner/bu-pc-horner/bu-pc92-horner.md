# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 92

*Bu-Pc.92.1.1* *BD.3.100* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the venerable Nanda,[^1] the son of the lord’s aunt, was beautiful, good to look upon, charming, four finger-breadths less (in height[^2]) than the lord. He wore a robe the measure of a well-farer’s robe.[^3] Monks who were elders saw the venerable Nanda coming from afar; seeing him, saying: “The lord is coming,” they rose from their seats. These, recognising him when he had come, looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:

“How can the venerable Nanda wear a robe the measure of a well-farer’s robe?” They told this matter to the lord. Then the lord questioned the venerable Nanda, saying:

“Is it true, as is said, that you, Nanda, wore a robe the measure of a well-farer’s robe?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:

“How can you, Nanda, wear a robe the measure of a well-farer’s robe? It is not, Nanda, for pleasing *BD.3.101* those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk should have a robe made the measure of a well-farer’s robe, or more, there is an offence of expiation involving cutting down. This is the (proper) measure here of a well-farer’s robe for a well-farer: in length nine spans of the accepted span, in breadth six spans; this is the (proper) measure of a well-farer’s robe for a well-farer.”

* * *

*Bu-Pc.92.2.1* Whatever means: … monk is to be understood in this case.

Well-farer’s robe means: in length it is nine spans of the accepted span, in breadth six spans.

Should have made means: if he makes it or causes it to be made, in the business … see *Bu-Pc.89* … If, having acquired what was made for another, he makes use of it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.92.2.2* There is no offence if he makes it less; if having acquired what was made for another, *Vin.4.174* having cut it clown, he makes use of it; if he makes a canopy … or a squatting-mat; if he is mad, if he is the first wrongdoer.[^4]

The Tenth rule of training: that on Nanda

The Ninth Division: that on treasure[^5]

Concluded is the Minor (Class)[^6]

##### This is its key:

And of a king, treasure, if he be there,  
a needle, and a couch, on cotton,  
And a piece of cloth to sit upon,  
and the itch, for the rains, and on a well-farer.

*BD.3.102* Venerable ones, recited are the ninety-two rules for offences of expiation. Concerning them, I ask the venerable ones: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a second time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a third time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? The venerable ones are quite pure in this matter, therefore they are silent, thus do I understand this. *Vin.4.175*

# Monks’ Confession (_Pāṭidesaniya_) 1

*Bu-Pd.1.1.1* *BD.3.103* At that time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a certain nun, having walked for alms in Sāvatthī, having seen a certain monk at the time of going back, spoke thus: “Come, master, accept alms.”

“Very well, sister,” and he took everything. She, at the approach of (meal)-time, was not able to walk for alms;[^1] she became famished.[^2] Then that nun on the second day … on the third day, having walked for alms in Sāvatthī, having seen that monk at the time of going back, spoke thus: “Come, master, accept alms “… she became famished. Then that nun on the fourth day went trembling along a carriage road. A householder who was a merchant, coming along in a chariot the opposite way, spoke thus to the nun:

“Get out of the way, lady.” She, turning aside, fell down just there. The householder who was a merchant apologised to that nun, saying:

“Forgive me, lady, that I was the cause of your fall.”[^3]

“I, householder, did not fall because of you, but I am simply very weak.”

“But why, lady, are you very weak?” Then this nun told this matter to the householder who was a merchant. The householder who was a merchant, having taken this nun to his house, looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:

*BD.3.104* “How can these revered sirs accept food from the hand of a nun? Women obtain things with difficulty.”[^4] Monks heard this householder who was a merchant who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can this monk accept food from the hand of a nun?”

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, accepted food from the hand of a nun?” *Vin.4.176*

“It is true, lord.”

“Was she a relation of yours, monk, or not a relation?”

“She was not a relation, lord.”

“Foolish man, one who is not a relation does not know what is suitable or what is unsuitable, or what is right or what is wrong for a woman who is not a relation. How can you, foolish man, accept food from the hand of a nun who is not a relation? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk should eat or partake of solid food or soft food, having accepted it with his own hand from the hand of a nun who is not a relation (and) who has entered among the houses,[^5] it should be confessed[^6] by that monk, saying: ‘I have fallen, your reverences, into a blameworthy matter,[^7] unbecoming, which ought to be confessed[^8]; I confess it.’”

* * *

*Bu-Pd.1.2.1* Whatever means: … monk is to be understood in this case.

(Nun) who is not a relation means: one who is not related on the mother’s side or on the father’s side back through seven generations.

Nun means: one ordained by both Orders.

*BD.3.105* Among the houses means: a carriage road,[^9] a cul-de-sac,[^10] cross-roads,[^11] a house.

Solid food means: setting aside the five (kinds of) meals, and (food that may be eaten) during a watch of the night, during seven days, during life,[^12] the rest means solid food.[^13]

Soft food means: the five (kinds of) meals: cooked rice, food made with flour, barley-meal, fish, meat.

If he says, “I will eat, I will partake of,” (and) accepts, there is an offence of wrong-doing; for every mouthful there is an offence which ought to be confessed.

* * *

*Bu-Pd.1.2.2* If he thinks that she is not a relation when she is not a relation, (and) having accepted with his own hand solid food or soft food from the hand of her who has entered among the houses, if he eats it or partakes of it, there is an offence which ought to be confessed. If he is in doubt as to whether she is not a relation … If he thinks that she is a relation when she is not a relation … offence which ought to be confessed. If he accepts[^14] for the sake of nutriment (food that may be eaten) during a watch of the night, during seven days, during life, there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he accepts solid food or soft food from the hand of one ordained by one (Order only), thinking, “I will eat, I will partake of,” there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that she is not a relation when she is a relation, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is *BD.3.106* in doubt as to whether she is a relation, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that she is a relation when, she is a relation, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Pd.1.2.3* There is no offence if she is a relation; if she[^15] makes (another) give but does not (herself) give; if having put it down nearby, she gives[^16]; if it is within a monastery[^17]; if it is in the nuns’ quarters[^18]; if it is at the sleeping-place of members of other sects[^19]; if it is on the way back[^20]; *Vin.4.177* if, having taken it back[^21] from the village, she gives; if, when there is a reason, she gives (food that may be eaten) during a watch of the night, during seven days, during life[^22] and he makes use of it; if it is from a female probationer, a female novice; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.

*Bu-Pd.2.1.1* *BD.3.107* … at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrel’s feeding-place. Now at that time monks ate, invited by families. The group of six nuns came to be standing, giving directions for the group of six monks, saying: “Here give curry, give cooked rice here.” The group of six monks ate as much as they pleased, other monks did not eat as much as expected. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:

“How can this group of six monks, when the nuns are giving directions, not restrain[^1] (them)?” …

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, when nuns were giving directions, did not restrain (them)?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How can you, foolish men … not restrain (them)? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Now, monks eat, invited by families. If a nun comes to be standing as though giving directions,[^2] saying: ‘Here give curry, give cooked rice here,’ that nun should be rebuked by those monks, saying: ‘Stand aside,[^3] sister, while the monks eat.’ But if it should not occur to a single monk to dismiss that nun, saying: ‘Stand aside, sister, while the monks eat,’ it should be confessed by those monks, saying: ‘We have fallen, your reverences, into a blameworthy matter, unbecoming, which ought to be confessed; we confess it.’”

* * *

*Bu-Pd.2.2.1* Now monks eat, invited by families means: a family means there are four (kinds of) family: noble family, brahmin family, merchant family, low-class family.[^4]

*BD.3.108* Eat, invited, means: they eat, invited to any one meal of the five (kinds of) meals.

Nun means: one ordained by both Orders. *Vin.4.178*

Giving directions[^5] means: if according to friendship, according to comradeship, according to intimacy, according as one has the same preceptor, according as one has the same teacher,[^6] she says: ‘Here give curry, give cooked rice here,’ this means giving directions.

By those monks means: by the monks who are eating.

That nun means: the nun who is giving directions.

That nun should be dismissed by those monks, saying: ‘Stand aside, sister, while the monks eat.’ But if she is not dismissed by a single monk (and) he accepts (food), saying: ‘I will eat, I will partake of,’ there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful there is an offence which ought to be confessed.

* * *

*Bu-Pd.2.2.2* If he thinks that she is ordained when she is ordained (and) does not restrain her when she is giving directions, there is an offence which ought to be confessed. If he is in doubt as to whether she is ordained … If he thinks that she is not ordained when she is ordained … offence which ought to be confessed. If he does not restrain one ordained by one (Order only) who is giving directions, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that she is ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that she is not ordained when she is not ordained, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Pd.2.2.3* There is no offence if she makes (another) give her own meal, (but) does not (herself) give; if she gives a meal to others (but) does not make (them) give; if she makes (another) give what was not given; if she makes (another) give where it was not given; if she makes (another) give the same to everybody; if a female *BD.3.109* probationer gives directions; if a female novice gives directions; setting aside the five (kinds of) meals, there is no offence in (eating) any others[^7]; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.

*Bu-Pd.3.1.1* *BD.3.110* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time there was in Sāvatthī a certain family which on both sides came to be pleased,[^1] it grew in faith, it decreased in wealth; whatever solid food or soft food accrued to that family before a meal, having given it all away to monks, sometimes they went without food.[^2] People … spread it about, saying:

“How can the recluses, sons of the Sakyans, not knowing moderation, accept? These (people), having given to these (monks), sometimes go without food.” Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this *Vin.4.179* occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:

“I allow you, monks, when a family is growing in faith, is decreasing in wealth, to give such a family an agreement as to learners[^3] by a (formal) act at which the motion is followed by one proclamation.[^4] And thus, monks, should it be given: The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. Such and such a family is growing in faith, is decreasing in wealth. If it seems right to the Order, let the Order give the agreement as to learners to such and such a family. This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. Such and such a family … in wealth. The Order *BD.3.111* gives the agreement as to learners to such and such a family. If the giving of the agreement as to learners to such and such a family is pleasing to the venerable ones, let them be silent; if it is not pleasing, they should speak. The agreement as to learners is given by the Order to such and such a family, and it is right … So do I understand this.’ And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

Whatever are those families that are agreed upon as learners, whatever monk having accepted among such families as are agreed upon as learners solid food or soft food with his own hand, should eat it or partake of it, it should be confessed by that monk, saying: ‘I have fallen, your reverences, into a blameworthy matter, unbecoming, which ought to be confessed; I confess it.’”

And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bu-Pd.3.2.1* Now at that time there came to be a festival at Sāvatthī. People, having invited monks, offered them food. The monks, being scrupulous, did not consent, thinking: “It is forbidden by the lord, having accepted among families that are agreed upon as learners solid food or soft food with one’s own hand, to eat it, to partake of it.” These looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “But how is it that because of our way of living, the masters do not accept from us?” Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:

“I allow you, monks, when invited, having accepted among families agreed upon as learners solid food or soft food with your own hand, to eat it, to partake of it. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever are those families that are agreed upon as learners, whatever monk if he is not invited beforehand, *Vin.4.180* having accepted among such families as are agreed upon as learners solid food or soft food with his *BD.3.112* own hand, should eat it or partake of it, it should be confessed by that monk, saying: ‘I have fallen, your reverences, into a blameworthy matter, unbecoming, which ought to be confessed; I confess it.’”

And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bu-Pd.3.3.1* Now at that time a certain monk came to frequent that family. Then that monk, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, approached that family, and having approached he sat down on the appointed seat. At that time this monk came to be ill. Then these people spoke thus to this monk: “Eat, honoured sir.” Then that monk, thinking: “It is forbidden by the lord, not being invited, having accepted among families agreed upon as learners solid food or soft food with one’s own hand, to eat it, to partake of it,” and being scrupulous, he did not accept; he was not able to walk for alms, he became famished. Then that monk, having gone to the monastery, told this matter to the monks. The monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:

“I allow you, monks, when a monk is ill, having accepted among families agreed upon as learners solid food or soft food with his own hand, to eat it, to partake of it. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever are those families that are agreed upon as learners, whatever monk, if he is not invited beforehand (and) not ill, having accepted among such families as are agreed upon as learners solid food or soft food with his own hand, should eat it or partake of it, it should be confessed by that monk, saying: ‘Your reverences, I have fallen into a blameworthy matter, unbecoming, which ought to be confessed; I confess it.’”

* * *

*Bu-Pd.3.4.1* Whatever are those families that are agreed upon as learners means: a family agreed upon as learners is *BD.3.113* called that family which is growing in faith, decreasing in wealth; for such a family an agreement as to learners comes to be given by a (formal) act at which the motion is followed by one proclamation.

Whatever means: … monk is to be understood in this case.

Among such families as are agreed, upon as learners means: among families like these agreed upon as learners.

Not invited means: not invited for today or tomorrow. If he invites him as he is entering the precincts of the house, this means not invited. *Vin.4.181* Invited means: invited for today or tomorrow. If he invites him not as he is entering the precincts of the house, this means invited.

Not ill means: he is able to walk for alms. Ill means: he is not able to walk for alms.

Solid food means: setting aside the five (kinds of) meals, (food that may be eaten) during a watch of the night, during seven days, during life, the rest means solid food.[^5]

Soft food means: the five kinds of meals: cooked rice, food made with flour, barley-meal, fish, meat.[^6]

If he is not invited, not ill, (and) accepts, thinking: “I will eat, I will partake of,” there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful there is an offence which ought to be confessed.

* * *

*Bu-Pd.3.4.2* If he thinks that they are agreed upon as learners when they are agreed upon as learners, (and) not invited, not ill, having accepted with his own hand solid food or soft food, eats it or partakes of it, there is an offence which ought to be confessed. If he is in doubt as to whether they are agreed upon as learners … If he thinks that they are not agreed upon as learners when they are agreed upon as learners … offence which ought to be confessed. If he accepts for the sake of nutriment (food that may be eaten) during a watch of the night, during seven days, during life, there is an *BD.3.114* offence of wrong-doing.[^7] For every mouthful there is an offence of wrong-doing.[^8] If he thinks that they are agreed upon as learners when they are not agreed upon as learners, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether they are not agreed upon as learners, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that they are not agreed upon as learners when they are not agreed upon as learners, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Pd.3.4.3* There is no offence if he is invited; if he is ill; if he eats the remainder (of a meal) of one who was invited, or one who is ill; if there come to be alms there prepared for others; if having taken it out from the house, they give[^9]; if he is a regular diner; if it is (food allowed) by ticket; if it is food (given on) a day of the waxing or waning of the moon, on an Observance day, on the day after an Observance day[^10]; if, when there is a reason, he gives (food that may be eaten) during a watch of the night, during seven days, during life,[^11] and he makes use of it;[^12] if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.

# Monks’ Confession (_Pāṭidesaniya_) 4

*Bu-Pd.4.1.1* *BD.3.115* … among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan monastery. Now at that time the slaves of the Sakyans came to be out of hand.[^1] Sakyan women wanted to make a meal in jungle lodgings. The slaves of the Sakyans heard that Sakyan women were desirous of making a meal in jungle lodgings. They infested[^2] the way. *Vin.4.182* Sakyan women, taking sumptuous solid food, soft food, went off to a jungle lodging. The slaves of the Sakyans, having issued forth, robbed the Sakyan women and violated them. The Sakyans, having issued forth, having seized these thieves together with the goods, looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:

“How can these revered sirs not announce that thieves are living in the monastery?” Monks heard the Sakyans who … spread it about … Then these monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:

On account of this, monks, I will lay down a rule of training founded on ten reasons: for the excellence of the Order … for following the rules of restraint.[^3] And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever are those jungle lodgings that are held to be dangerous, frightening,[^4] whatever monk in such lodgings, not announced beforehand,[^5] having accepted solid food or soft food within a monastery with his own *BD.3.116* hand, should eat it or partake of it, it should be confessed by that monk, saying: ‘I have fallen, your reverences, into a blameworthy matter, unbecoming, which ought to be confessed; I confess it.’”

And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bu-Pd.4.2.1* Now at that time a certain monk came to be ill in a jungle lodging. People, taking solid food or soft food set out for the jungle lodging. Then these people spoke thus to this monk: “Eat, honoured sir.” Then that monk, thinking: “It is forbidden by the lord, having accepted in a jungle lodging solid food or soft food with one’s own hand, to eat it, to partake of it,” being scrupulous, did not accept it; he was unable to enter[^6] for almsfood, he became famished. Then this monk told this matter to the monks. The monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:

“I allow, monks, an ill monk, having accepted in a jungle lodging solid food or soft food with his own hand, to eat it, to partake of it. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever are those jungle lodgings that are held to be dangerous, frightening, whatever monk in such *Vin.4.183* lodgings, not announced beforehand, having accepted solid food or soft food within a monastery with his own hand, should eat it or partake of it if he is not ill, it should be confessed by that monk, saying: ‘I have fallen, your reverences, into a blameworthy matter, unbecoming, which ought to be confessed; I confess it.’”

* * *

*Bu-Pd.4.3.1* Those jungle lodgings means: the last lodging called “jungle” is five hundred _dhanus_ measures (away from the village).[^7]

*BD.3.117* Dangerous means: if, in a monastery, in the precincts of a monastery, a place where thieves are halting is seen, a place where they are eating is seen,[^8] a place where they are resting is seen, a place where they are sitting down is seen, a place where they are lying down is seen.[^9]

Frightening means: if, in a monastery, in the precincts of a monastery, people injured by thieves are seen, (people) plundered are seen, (people) beaten down are seen.[^10]

Whatever means: monk is to be understood in this case.

In such lodgings as those means: in lodgings like those.

Not announced means: there is “announced” in five (ways but) this means not announced. Setting aside a monastery, the precincts of a monastery (as) announced, this is called not announced.

Announced means: whatever woman or man having come to a monastery, to the precincts of a monastery, declares: ‘Honoured sirs, they will convey solid food, soft food for so and so,’ if it becomes dangerous it should be pointed out that it is dangerous, if it becomes frightening it should be pointed out that it is frightening. If he speaks, saying: ‘Let him be, honoured sir, he will convey it,’ the thieves should be told:’ People are serving here, go away.’

If it is announced in regard to conjey that the ingredients[^11] may be conveyed for that, this is called announced. If it is announced in regard to a meal that the ingredients may be conveyed for that, this is called announced. If it is announced in regard to solid food that the ingredients may be conveyed for that, this is called announced. If it is announced in regard to a family, the person who of *BD.3.118* that family conveys solid food or soft food, this is called announced. If it is announced in regard to a village, the person who in that village conveys solid food or soft food, this is called announced. If it is announced in regard to a guild, the person who in that guild conveys solid food or soft food, this is called announced.

Solid food means: … soft food means: … meat.

Within a monastery means: when a monastery is fenced in, inside a monastery; the precincts when it is not fenced in.[^12]

Not ill means: he is able to walk for almsfood.

Ill means: he is not able to walk for almsfood. *Vin.4.184*

If it is not announced, if he is not ill (and) accepts it, thinking: “I will eat, I will partake of,” there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful there is an offence which ought to be confessed.

If he thinks that it is not announced when it is not announced (and) having accepted solid food or soft food with his own hand within the monastery when he is not ill, eats it or partakes of it, there is an offence which ought to be confessed. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not announced … If he thinks that it is announced when it is not announced … ought to be confessed. If he accepts for the sake of nutriment (food to be eaten) during a watch of the night, during seven days, during life, there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not announced when it is announced, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is announced, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is announced when it is announced, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Pd.4.3.2* There is no offence if it is announced, if he is ill; if he eats the remainder of (a meal) if it was announced or of one who was ill; if having accepted it outside the monastery he makes use of it inside the monastery; if he makes use of a root or bark, or a leaf or a flower or a *BD.3.119* fruit growing there; if when there is a reason he makes use of (food to be eaten) during a watch of the night, during seven days, during life[^13]; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.

The Fourth

Venerable ones, recited are the four rules for offences which ought to be confessed. Concerning them, I ask the venerable ones: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a second time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a third time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? The venerable ones are quite pure in this matter, therefore they are silent; thus do I understand this.

Told are the offences which ought to be confessed. *Vin.4.185*

Monks’ rules and their analysis

# Monks’ Training (_Sekhiya_) 1

*Bu-Sk.1.1.1* *BD.3.120* These rules for training,[^1] venerable ones, come up for recitation.

At that time the enlightened one, the lord was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks dressed with the inner robe[^2] hanging down in front and behind. People … spread it about, saying:

“How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, dress with the inner robe hanging down in front and behind, just like householders who enjoy the pleasures of the senses?”

Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:

“How can this group of six monks dress with the inner robe hanging down in front and behind?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion in this connection, \[having given reasoned talk[^3]\], having had the Order of monks convened, questioned the group of six monks, saying:

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, dressed with the inner robe hanging down in front and behind?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How can you, foolish men, dress with the inner robe hanging down in front and behind? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

*BD.3.121* “‘I will dress with the inner robe all round (me),’[^4] is a training to be observed.”[^5]

The inner robe should be dressed in (going) all round one for covering the circle of the navel, the circles of the knees.[^6] Whoever out of disrespect dresses with an inner robe hanging down in front or behind, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

There is no offence if it is unintentional, if he is not thinking, if he does not know,[^7] if he is ill, if there are accidents, if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.

*Bu-Sk.51.1.1* At one time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s monastery. Now at that time a milk drink[^1] had been prepared for the Order by a certain brahmin. The monks drank the milk[^2] making a hissing sound.[^3] A certain monk who had formerly been an actor spoke thus: “It seems that this whole Order is cooled.”[^4] Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can this monk make a joke about the Order?” …

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, made a joke about the Order?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:

“How can you, foolish man, make a joke about the Order? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who *BD.3.138* are not (yet) pleased …” … and having rebuked him, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:

“Monks, a joke should not be made about the enlightened one or _dhamma_ or the Order. Whoever should make (one), there is an offence of wrong-doing.”

Then the lord, having rebuked that monk in many a figure for his difficulty in maintaining himself … “… And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

‘I will not eat making a hissing sound,’ is a training to be observed.” *Vin.4.198*

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, accepted a drinking cup, your hands (soiled) with food?”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How can you, foolish men, accept a drinking cup, your hands (soiled) with food? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

One should not accept a drinking cup, the hands (soiled) with food. Whoever out of disrespect accepts a drinking cup, the hands (soiled) with food, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

There is no offence if it is unintentional, if he is not thinking, if he does not know, if he is ill, if he accepts it, thinking, ‘I will wash’ or ‘I will get (someone) to wash (my hand),’ if there are accidents, if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, … taught _dhamma_ to (someone) sitting on a high seat?”

How can you, foolish men, … teach _dhamma_ to (someone) sitting on a high seat? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” And having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:

* * *

“Formerly, monks, in Benares, the wife of a certain low class man[^2] came to be pregnant. Then, monks, this low class woman spoke thus to this low class man: ‘Sir,[^3] I am pregnant; I want to eat a mango.’

‘There are no mangoes, it is not the mango season,’ he said.

Now at that time the king had a mango tree with a perpetual crop of fruit. Then, monks, that low class man approached that mango tree; having approached, having climbed up that mango tree, he remained hidden. Then, monks, the king together with the brahmin priest, approached that mango tree; having approached, having sat down on a high seat, he learnt a mantra. *Vin.4.204* Then, monks, it occurred to that low class man:

‘How unrighteous[^4] is this king, inasmuch as he learns a mantra, having sat down on a high seat. This brahmin also is unrighteous, inasmuch as he, having sat down on a low seat, teaches a mantra to (someone) sitting on a high seat. I too am unrighteous, I who for the sake of a woman, steal the king’s mangoes. But all this is quite gone,’[^5] (and) he fell down just there.

> *BD.3.148* Neither knows the goal,[^6]  
> neither sees _dhamma_,[^7]  
> Neither he who teaches the mantra,  
> nor he who learns according to what is not the rule.[^8]  
> 
> My food[^9] is pure conjey  
> of rice flavoured with meat,[^10]  
> I do not therefore fare on _dhamma_,[^11]  
> _dhamma_ praised by the noble.

> Brahmin,[^12] shame on that gain of wealth,  
> (that) gain of fame;  
> That conduct (leads) to falling away[^13]  
> or to walking by what is not the rule.[^14]
> 
> Go forth,[^15] great brahmin,  
> for other creatures boil,[^16]  
> Do not you, following what is not the rule,  
> from that break like a pot.[^17]

At that time,[^18] monks,[^19] to teach[^20] a mantra, having sat down on a low seat, to (someone) sitting on a high *BD.3.149* seat, was not liked by me. So, however could it now be not not[^21] liked to teach[^22] _dhamma_, having sat down on a low seat, to (someone) sitting on a high seat? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

‘I will not teach _dhamma_, having sat down on a low seat, to (someone) sitting on a high seat (and) who is not ill,’ is a training to be observed.”

Dhamma should not be taught, having sat down on a low seat, to (someone) sitting on a high seat (and) who is not ill. Whoever out of disrespect, having sat down on a low seat, teaches _dhamma_ to someone sitting on a high seat (and) who is not ill, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

Nuns’ rules and their analysis

# Nuns’ Defeat (_Pārājika_) 5

*Bi-Pj.5.1.1* *BD.3.156* *Vin.4.211* [^1] At that time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Sāḷha,[^2] Migāra’s grandson,[^3] became desirous of building a dwelling-house for the Order of nuns. Then Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, having approached the nuns, spoke thus:

“Ladies, I want to build a dwelling-place for the Order of nuns; give me a nun who is an overseer of repairs.”[^4]

At that time four sisters had gone forth among the nuns: Nandā, Nandavatī, Sundarīnandā, Thullanandā.[^5] Among these, the nun Sundarīnandā[^6] had gone forth when she was young; she was beautiful, good to look upon, charming, she was clever, experienced, wise, she was skilled, energetic, she was possessed of consideration for those kinds of things,[^7] she was able to build, able to make arrangements.[^8] Then the nuns, having chosen the nun Sundarīnandā, gave (her) as overseer of repairs to Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson.

*BD.3.157* Now at that time the nun Sundarīnandā constantly went to the dwelling of Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, saying: “Give a knife, give a hatchet, give an axe, give a spade, give a chisel.”[^9] And Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, constantly went to the nunnery to learn what was built and what was not built. These,[^10] through constantly seeing (one another), came to be in love. Then Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, through not getting an opportunity to seduce the nun Sundarīnandā, for this purpose gave a meal for the Order of nuns. Then Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, having appointed a seat in the refectory, thinking: “Some nuns are senior to the lady Sundarīnandā,” appointed a seat to one side, and thinking: “Some are junior,” appointed a seat to the other side.[^11] He appointed a seat for the nun Sundarīnandā in a concealed place, in a corner, *Vin.4.212* so that the nuns who were elders might conclude, “She is sitting with the junior nuns,” and the junior nuns might conclude, “She is sitting with the nuns who are elders.”

Then Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, had the time announced to the Order of nuns, saying: “It is time, ladies, the meal is ready.” The nun Sundarīnandā, having realised (what was happening), thinking: “Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, is not benevolent (although) he gave a meal for the Order of nuns; he wants to seduce me. If I go, there will be trouble for me,”[^12] ordered her pupil, saying: “Go, bring back almsfood for me, and if anyone asks for me, let it be known that I am ill.”

“Very well, lady,” the nun answered the nun Sundariīnandā.

At that time Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, came to be standing outside the porch of the door, asking for the nun Sundarīnandā, saying: “Where, lady, is the lady Sundarīnandā; where, lady, is the lady Sundarīnandā?”

When he had spoken thus, the pupil of the nun Sundarīnandā spoke thus to Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson: *BD.3.158* “She is ill, sir; I will take back her almsfood.” Then Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, thinking: “This meal which I gave for the sake of the nuns was on purpose for the lady Sundarīnandā,” and having commanded the people, having said: “Offer the meal for the Order of nuns,” he approached the nunnery.

At that time the nun Sundarīnandā came to be standing outside the porch of the monastery waiting for Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson. Then the nun Sundarīnandā saw Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, coming from afar; seeing him, having entered the dwelling,[^13] having put on her upper robe including over her head,[^14] she lay down on a couch. Then Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, approached the nun Sundarīnandā; having approached, lie spoke thus to the nun Sundarīnandā: “What is your discomfort, lady? Why are you lying down?”

“Surely it is this, sir: she who desires is not desired.”

“How can I, lady, not desire you? But I did not get an opportunity to seduce you,” and filled with desire he came into physical contact[^15] with the nun Sundarīnandā, also filled with desire.

Now at that time a nun, weakened by age, her feet affected,[^16] came to be sitting down not far from the nun Sundarīnandā. That nun saw Sāḷha, Migara’s grandson, filled with desire, coming into physical contact with the nun Sundarīnandā, (also) filled with desire; seeing them, she looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Sundarīnandā, filled with desire, consent to physical contact with a male person[^17] who is filled with desire?” *Vin.4.213* Then this nun told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns, contented, conscientious, scrupulous, desirous of training, these looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Sundarīnandā, filled with desire … with a male person who is filled with desire?” Then these nuns told this matter to the *BD.3.159* monks. These monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can the nun Sundarīnandā, filled with desire … with a male person who is filled with desire?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of monks convened, questioned the monks, saying:

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Sundarīnandā, filled with desire … with a male person filled with desire?”

“It is true, lord,” they said.

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“It is not fitting, monks, in the nun Sundarīnandā, it is not suitable, it is not becoming, it is unworthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it is not to be done. How, monks, can the nun Sundarīnandā, filled with desire, consent to physical contact with a male person who is filled with desire? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased, nor for increasing (the number of) those who are pleased, but, monks, it is both for displeasing those who are not (yet) pleased and those who are pleased, and for causing wavering in some.”

Then the lord, having in many a figure rebuked the nun Sundarīnandā for her difficulty in supporting[^18] herself, for her difficulty in maintaining herself, having spoken in dispraise of great desires, of discontent, of clinging (to the obstructions[^19]), of sloth; having in many a figure spoken in praise of ease in supporting oneself, of ease in maintaining oneself, of desiring little, of contentment, of expunging (evil), of punctiliousness, of graciousness, of decreasing (the obstructions),[^20] of putting forth energy[^21]; having given reasoned talk to the monks on what is fitting, on what is suitable,[^22] he addressed the monks, saying:

*BD.3.160* “On account of this, monks, I will lay down a rule of training for nuns founded on ten reasons: for the excellence of the Order, for the comfort of the Order, for the restraint of evil-minded nuns, for the ease of well-behaved nuns, for the restraint of cankers belonging to the here and now, for the combating of cankers belonging to other worlds, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased, for increasing (the number of) those who are pleased, for establishing what is verily _dhamma_, for following the rules of restraint.[^23] And thus, monks, let the nuns set forth this rule of training:

“Whatever nun, filled with desire, should consent to rubbing,[^24] or rubbing up against, or taking hold of or touching or pressing against a male person below the collar-bone, above the circle[^25] of the knees, if he is filled with desire, she also becomes one who is defeated, she is not in communion, she is one who touches above the circle of the knees.”[^26] *Vin.4.214*

* * *

*Bi-Pj.5.2.1* Whatever[^27] means: she who is an elder or a junior or one of middle standing, this one, on account of relations, on account of birth, on account of name, on account of clan, on account of virtue, on account of the way of living, on account of the field of activity, is called whatever.

Nun means: she is a nun because she is a beggar for alms, she is a nun because she submits to walking for alms, she is a nun because she is one who wears the patch-work robes, she is a nun by the designation (of others), a nun because of her acknowledgement, a nun (to whom it was) said, ‘Come, nun,’ a nun is one ordained by the three goings to a refuge, a nun is auspicious, a nun is the essential, a nun is a learner, a nun is an adept, a nun is ordained by both complete Orders by means of *BD.3.161* a (formal) act at which the motion is put and followed by three proclamations, irreversible and fit to stand.[^28] In this way is this nun one who is ordained by both complete Orders by means of a (formal) act at which the motion was put and followed by three proclamations, irreversible, fit to stand, and this is how nun is to be understood in this case.[^29]

Filled with desire[^30] means: infatuated, full of desire, physically in love with.

Filled with desire[^31] means: infatuated, full of desire, physically in love with.[^32]

A male person means: a human man, not a _yakkha_, not a departed one, not an animal; he is learned, competent[^33] to come into physical contact.

Touching means: merely contact.[^39]

Or should consent to pressing against means: having taken hold of a limb she consents to pressing against.

She also means: she is so called in reference to the preceding.[^40]

Becomes one who is defeated means: as a man with his head cut off cannot become one to live by attaching it to his body, so a nun, filled with desire, consenting to *BD.3.162* rubbing or to rubbing up against or to taking hold of or to touching or to pressing a man who is filled with desire below the collar-bone, above the circle of the knees, becomes one who is not a recluse, not a daughter of the Sakyans; therefore she is called, she becomes one who is defeated.[^41]

Is not in communion means: communion is called one (formal) act, one recital, an equal training; this is called communion. If it is not together with her, she is therefore called not in communion.[^42]

* * *

*Bi-Pj.5.2.2* If both are filled with desire (and) she rubs the body[^43] below the collar-bone, above the circle of the knees with the body, there is an offence involving defeat. If she rubs something attached to the body with the body, there is a grave offence. If she rubs the body with something attached to the body, there is a grave offence.

If she rubs something attached to the body with something that may be cast, there is an *BD.3.163* offence of wrong-doing. If she rubs something that may be cast with something that may be cast, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

If one is filled with desire, and she rubs the body below the collar-bone, above the circle of the knees with the body, there is a grave offence. If she rubs the body with something attached to the body … If she rubs something that may be cast with something that may be cast, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

If both are filled with desire, and she rubs the body of a _yakkha_ or of a departed one or of a eunuch or of an animal in human form, below the collar-bone, above the circle of the knees with the body, there is a grave offence. If she rubs something attached to the body with the body … If she rubs something that may be cast with something that may be cast, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

If she rubs something attached to the body with the body … If she rubs something that *BD.3.164* may be cast with something that may be cast, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

* * *

*Bi-Pj.5.2.3* There is no offence if it is unintentional; if she is not thinking; if she does not know; if she does not consent; if she is mad, if her mind is unhinged, if she is in pain, if she is the first wrong-doer.[^44]

Nuns’ rules and their analysis

# Nuns’ Defeat (_Pārājika_) 6

[^1] *Bi-Pj.6.1.1* *BD.3.165* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Sundarīnandā became pregnant by Saḷhā, Migāra’s grandson. Until the embryo quickened she concealed it; when the embryo was matured, having left the Order, she gave birth. Nuns spoke thus to the nun Thullanandā: “Lady, Sundarīnandā not long after leaving the Order gave birth. We wonder if she was pregnant when she was a nun?”

“Yes, ladies.”

“But how is it that you, lady, knowing that a nun had fallen into a matter involving defeat,[^2] neither reproved her yourself, nor spoke to a group?”

“Whatever is blame for her, that is blame for me; whatever is disgrace for her, that is disgrace for me; whatever is dishonour for her, that is dishonour for me; whatever is loss for her, that is loss for me. How can I, ladies, speak to others of my own blame, my own disgrace, my own dishonour, my own loss?”

Those who were modest nuns looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā, knowing that a nun had fallen into a matter involving defeat, neither reprove her herself, nor speak to a group?” Then these nuns told this matter to the monks. The monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of monks convened, having given reasoned talk, questioned the monks, saying:

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā, knowing that a nun … neither reproved her herself, nor spoke to a group?”

*BD.3.166* “It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā, knowing that a nun … neither reprove her herself, nor speak to a group? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, let the nuns set forth this rule of training:

“Whatever nun, knowing that a nun has fallen into a matter involving defeat, should neither herself reprove her, nor speak to a group, but when she may be remaining or deceased or expelled or withdrawn,[^3] should afterwards speak thus: ‘Ladies, before I knew this nun, she was a sister like this and like that,’ *Vin.4.217* and should neither herself reprove her nor should speak to a group, she also becomes one who is defeated, she is not in communion, she is one who conceals a fault.”[^4]

* * *

*Bi-Pj.6.2.1* Whatever means: she who …

Nun means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

She knows means: either she knows by herself or others tell her or she[^5] tells (her).

Has fallen into a matter involving defeat means: of the eight offences involving defeat[^6] (she) has fallen into a certain offence involving defeat.

Should neither herself[^7] reprove her means: should neither herself reprimand her.

Nor should speak to a group means: nor should speak to other nuns.

*BD.3.167* But when she may be remaining or deceased means: Remaining means she is called remaining in her own characteristic.[^8] Deceased means she is called one who has passed away. Expelled means she herself comes to be leaving the Order or she is expelled by others. Withdrawn means she is called one who has gone over to the fold of a sect.[^9]

Should afterwards speak thus: ‘Ladies, before I knew this nun, she was a sister like this and like that,’ and should neither herself reprove her means: should neither herself reprimand her; _nor speak to a group_ means: nor should speak to other nuns.

She also means: she is so called in reference to the former.

Becomes one who is defeated means: as a withered leaf freed from the stalk cannot become green again,[^10] so a nun, knowing that a nun has fallen into a matter involving defeat (and) thinking, ‘I will neither myself reprove her, nor speak to a group,’ in throwing off the responsibility,[^11] becomes one who is not a recluse, not a daughter of the Sakyans; therefore she is called, she becomes one who is defeated.

Is not in communion means: communion … is therefore called not in communion.

* * *

*Bi-Pj.6.2.2* There is no offence if she does not speak, thinking ‘There will come to be quarrel or dispute or strife or contention for the Order’; if she does not speak, thinking ‘There will come to be a schism in the Order or dissension in the Order’[^12]; if she does not speak, thinking *BD.3.168* ‘This one, harsh, rough, will bring[^13] danger to life or danger to the Brahma-life if she does not speak not seeing other suitable nuns; if she does not speak (though) not desiring to conceal; if she does not speak, thinking: ‘It will be evident from her own action’; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.[^14]

Told is the Second Offence involving Defeat *Vin.4.218*

Nuns’ rules and their analysis

# Nuns’ Defeat (_Pārājika_) 7

[^1] *Bi-Pj.7.1.1* *BD.3.169* *Vin.4.218* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Thullanandā imitated the monk Ariṭṭha who had formerly been a vulture-trainer,[^2] and who was suspended by a complete Order.[^3] Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:

“How can the lady Thullanandā imitate the monk … suspended by a complete Order?” … “It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā imitate the monk … suspended by a complete Order? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, let the nuns set forth this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should imitate him—a monk suspended by a complete Order, one who is disrespectful towards, who does not make amends towards,[^4] one who is unfriendly towards[^5] the rule,[^6] the discipline, the teacher’s instruction—that nun should be spoken to thus by the nuns: ‘Lady, this monk, suspended by a complete Order, is disrespectful towards, he does not make amends towards, he is unfriendly towards the rule, the discipline, the teacher’s instruction. Do not imitate this monk, lady.’ And if this nun, being spoken to thus by *BD.3.170* these nuns, should persist as before, that nun should be admonished by the nuns up to the third time for giving up this (course). If, being admonished up to the third time, she should give it up, that is good. But if she should not give it up, she also becomes one who is defeated, she is not in communion, she is an imitator of one who is suspended.”[^7]

* * *

*Bi-Pj.7.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Complete Order means: belonging to the same communion, staying within the same boundary.[^8]

Suspended means: suspended for not seeing or for not making amends for or for not giving up an offence.[^9]

Towards the rule, the discipline means: towards whatever is the rule, whatever is the discipline.[^10]

Towards the teacher’s instruction means: towards the conqueror’s instruction, the enlightened one’s instruction.[^11]

Disrespectful means: he does not heed an Order or a group or an individual or a (formal) act.

Does not make amends towards means: he is suspended, not restored.[^12]

Unfriendly towards means: monks belonging to the same communion are called friends. He who is not together with these is therefore called unfriendly.

Should imitate him means: if he becomes one of such views, of such indulgence, of such pleasures, she too becomes one of those views, of that indulgence, of those pleasures.

That nun means: whatever nun is an imitator of one who is suspended.

By the nuns[^13] means: by other nuns: these sec, these *BD.3.171* hear; she should be told by these saying: ‘Lady, this monk, suspended by a complete Order, … do not imitate this monk, lady.’ And a second time she should be told … And a third time she should be told … If she gives it up, that is good; if she does not give it up, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If, having heard, they do not speak, there is an offence of wrong-doing. That nun, having been pulled into the midst of the Order, should be told: ‘Lady, this monk, suspended by a complete Order, … do not imitate this monk, lady.’ And a second time … And a third time she should be told … If she gives it up, that is good; if she does not give it up, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

That nun should be admonished. And thus, monks, should she be admonished: the Order should be informed by an experienced, competent nun, saying: ‘Ladies, let the Order listen to me. This nun so and so imitated a monk suspended by a complete Order, one who is disrespectful towards, who does not make amends towards, who is unfriendly towards the rule, the discipline, the teacher’s instruction. She does not give up this course. If it seems right to the Order, let the Order admonish the nun so and so in order that she may give up this course. This is the motion. Ladies, let the Order listen to me. This nun so and so … She does not give up this course. The Order admonishes the nun so and so in order that she may give up this course. If the admonishing of the nun so and so in order that she may give up this course is pleasing to the ladies, let them be silent; if it is not pleasing, then you should speak. And a second time I speak forth this matter … And a third time I speak forth this matter … The nun so and so is admonished by the Order for giving up this course. It is pleasing to the Order … So do I understand this.’

As a result of the motion there is an offence of wrong-doing; as a result of two proclamations there are grave offences; at the end of the proclamations, there is an offence involving defeat.

*BD.3.172* She also means: she is so called in reference to the former.

She becomes one who is defeated means: as a flat stone broken in half cannot be put together again,[^14] so a nun, being admonished up to the third time, *Vin.4.220* not giving it up, becomes one who is not a (true) recluse, not a daughter of the Sakyans; therefore she is called she becomes one who is defeated.

Not in communion means: communion … is therefore called not in communion.

* * *

*Bi-Pj.7.2.2* If she thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act (and) does not give it up, there is an offence involving defeat. If she is in doubt as to whether it is a legally valid act (and) does not give it up, there is an offence involving defeat. If she thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act (and) does not give it up, there is an offence involving defeat. If she thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is not a legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether it is not a legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is not a legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing.[^15]

* * *

*Bi-Pj.7.2.3* There is no offence if she is not admonished; if she gives it up, if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.[^16]

# Nuns’ Defeat (_Pārājika_) 8

[^1] *Bi-Pj.8.1.1* *BD.3.173* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six nuns, filled with desire, for the sake of following what was verily not the rule,[^2] consented to taking hold of the hand of a male person who was filled with desire, and they consented to taking hold of the edge of (his) outer robe, and they stood and they talked and they went to a rendezvous and they consented to a man’s approaching (them) and they entered into a covered place and they disposed the body for such a purpose.[^3] Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:

“How can the group of six nuns, filled with desire, for the sake of following what is verily not the rule, consent to … and stand and talk and go to a rendezvous … and enter … and dispose …?” “It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the group of six nuns … consent to … dispose the body for such a purpose? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, let the nuns set forth this rule of training:

“Whatever nun, filled with desire, for the sake of following what is verily not the rule, should consent to taking hold of the hand of a male person who is filled with desire or should consent to taking hold of the edge of (his) outer cloak or should stand or should talk or should go to a rendezvous *Vin.4.221* or should consent to a man’s approaching (her) or should enter into a covered place or should dispose the body for such a purpose, she *BD.3.174* also becomes one who is defeated, she is not in communion, she is a doer of eight things.”[^4]

*Bi-Pj.8.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Filled with desire means: infatuated, full of desire, physically in love with.[^5]

Or should consent to taking hold of the edge of (his) outer cloak means: if for the sake of following what is verily not the rule, she consents to take hold of what he is clothed in[^9] or of what he has put on,[^10] there is a grave offence.

Or should talk means: if for the sake of following what is verily not the rule, she talks standing within the reach of a man’s hand, there is a grave offence.

Or should go to a rendezvous means: if for the sake of following what is verily not the rule, she, being told by a man, ‘Come to such and such a place,’ goes (there), for every step there is an offence of wrong-doing. In merely approaching the reach of a man’s hand, there is a grave offence.

*Bi-Pj.8.2.2* There is no offence if it is not intentional; if she is not thinking; if she does not know; if she does not consent: if she is mad, her mind unhinged, afflicted with pain, if she is the first wrong-doer.

Told is the Fourth Offence involving Defeat

Recited, ladies, are the eight offences[^14] involving defeat; a nun having fallen into one or other of these does not receive communion together with the nuns; *BD.3.176* as before, so after, she becomes one who is defeated, she is not in communion. Concerning them, I ask the ladies: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a second time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a third time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? The ladies are quite pure in this matter, therefore they are silent; thus do I understand this.[^15]

Told is the Portion on Defeat *Vin.4.223*

Nuns’ rules and their analysis

# Nuns’ Formal Meeting (_Saṅghādisesa_) 1

*Bi-Ss.1.1.1* *BD.3.177* These seventeen[^1] things, venerable ones, entailing formal meetings of the Order, come for exposition.

At one time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a certain lay-follower, having given a store-room[^2] to an Order of nuns, passed away. He had two sons, one of no faith, not believing,[^3] the other with faith, believing. Then he of no faith, not believing, spoke thus to him with faith, believing: “The store-room is ours, let us deal it out.”[^4] When he had spoken thus, the one with faith, believing, spoke thus to him of no faith, not believing: “Do not, sir, speak thus; it was given to the Order of nuns by our father.” And a second time he of no faith, not believing, spoke thus to him with faith, believing: “The storeroom is ours, let us deal it out.” Then the one with faith, believing, spoke thus to him of no faith, not believing: “Do not, sir, speak thus; it was given to the Order of nuns by our father.” And a third time he of no faith … “… let us deal it out.” Then the one with faith, believing, thinking,” If it became mine, I also would give it to an Order of nuns,” spoke thus to the one of no faith, not believing: “Let us deal it out.” Then that store-room being dealt out by these, *BD.3.178* fell to[^5] him of no faith, not believing. Then the one of no faith, not believing, having approached the nuns, spoke thus: “You must depart, ladies, the store-room is ours.” When he had spoken thus, the nun Thullanandā spoke thus to that man:

“Do not, sir, speak thus; the store-room was given to the Order of nuns by your father.”

Saying: “Was it given[^6] (or) not given?” they asked the chief ministers of justice. The chief ministers spoke thus:

“Who knows, ladies, if it was given to the Order of nuns?” When they had spoken thus, the nun Thullanandā spoke thus to these chief ministers: *Vin.4.224*

“But, masters, was not the gift seen or heard of by you as it was being given, eye-witnesses having been arranged?” Then the chief ministers, saying: “What the lady says is true,” made over the store-room to the Order of nuns. Then that man, defeated, looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:

“These shaven-headed (women) are not (true) recluses, they are strumpets.[^7] How can they have the store-room taken away from us?” The nun Thullanandā told this matter to the chief ministers. The chief ministers had that man punished.[^8] Then that man, punished,[^9] having had a sleeping-place made for Naked Ascetics not far from the nunnery, instigated the Naked Ascetics, saying: “Talk down[^10] these nuns.” The nun Thullanandā told this matter to the chief ministers. The chief ministers had that man fettered. People looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns have a store-room taken away (from him) and secondly have him punished and *BD.3.179* thirdly have him fettered? Now they will have him killed.”

Nuns heard these people as they … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā be one who speaks in envy?”[^11] Then these nuns told this matter to the monks …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā is one who speaks in envy?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā be one who speaks in envy? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, let the nuns set forth this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should be one who speaks in envy concerning a householder or a householder’s sons (or brothers[^12]) or a slave or a workman[^13] and even concerning a wanderer who is a recluse,[^14] that nun has fallen into a matter that is an offence at once,[^15] entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent away.”[^16]

* * *

*Bi-Ss.1.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

One who speaks in envy means: she is called a bringer of law-suits.[^17]

Householder means: he who lives in a house.[^18]

Householder’s sons (or brothers) means: whoever are sons and brothers.[^19]

*BD.3.180* Slave means: born within, bought for money, taken in a raid.[^20]

Workman[^21] means: a hireling, a worker.[^22]

Wanderer who is a recluse means: setting aside monk and nun and probationer and novice and female novice, he who is endowed with (the status of) wanderer.[^23] *Vin.4.225*

If she thinks, “I will bring a law-suit,” or looks about for a companion or goes herself,[^24] there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she announces it to one (person), there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she announces it to a second, there is a grave offence. At the end of the law-suit, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.

An offence at once means: she falls through transgression of a course,[^25] not after admonition.[^26]

Involving being sent away means: she is caused to be sent away from the Order.[^27]

Offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order means: the Order inflicts the _mānatta_ discipline on account of her offence, it sends back to the beginning, it rehabilitates; it is not several (nuns), it is not one nun, therefore it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. A synonym for this class of offence is (formal) *BD.3.181* act, therefore again it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.[^28]

* * *

*Bi-Ss.1.2.2* There is no offence if she goes being dragged along by people; if she asks for protection; if she explains without reference (to a particular person); if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.

*Bi-Ss.2.1.1* *BD.3.182* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time in Vesālī, the wife of a certain Licchavi came to be an adulteress. Then that Licchavi spoke thus to that woman: “Please desist, else will we do you harm.” But being spoken to thus, she paid no heed. Now at that time a group of Licchavis were assembled in Vesālī on some business. Then that Licchavi spoke thus to those Licchavis: “Let the masters allow me power over one woman.”[^1]

“What is her name?”

“My wife commits adultery, I will kill her.”

“Take your right,”[^2] they said. Then that woman heard: “My husband wants to kill me,” and taking precious belongings, having gone to Sāvatthī, having approached members of other sects, she asked for the going forth.[^3] The members of other sects did not wish to let her go forth.[^4] Having approached nuns, she asked for the going forth. Neither did the nuns wish to let her go forth. Having approached the nun Thullanandā, having shown (her) the belongings, she asked for the going forth. The nun Thullanandā, having taken the belongings, let her go forth. Then that Licchavi, searching for that woman, having gone to Sāvatthī, seeing her gone forth among the nuns, approached King Pasenadi of Kosala; *Vin.4.226* having approached, he spoke thus to King Pasenadi of Kosala:

“Sire, my wife, taking precious belongings, has reached Sāvatthī; let the king[^5] allow me power over her.”

“Well now, good sir, having examined[^6] (her), explain.”

“Sire, she was seen gone forth among the nuns.”

“If, good sir, she has gone forth among the nuns, *BD.3.183* there is nothing to do against her.[^7] Well preached by the lord is _dhamma_; let her lead the Brahma-life for the utter ending of ill.”[^8]

Then that Licchavi, looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns let a woman thief go forth?”[^9]

Nuns heard that Licchavi who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā let a woman thief go forth?” Then these nuns told this matter to the monks …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā let a thief go forth?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā let a woman thief go forth? It is not monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … let the nuns set forth this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should knowingly receive[^10] a woman thief found to merit death,[^11] without having obtained permission[^12] from a king or an Order or a group[^13] or a guild[^14] or a company,[^15] unless she is allowable,[^16] that nun *BD.3.184* also has fallen into a matter that is an offence at once, entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent away.”

* * *

*Bi-Ss.2.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood.

She knows means: either she knows by herself or others tell her or she tells her.

Woman thief[^17] means: she who takes by means of theft (anything) having the value of five _māsakas_ or more than five _māsakas_ that has not been given—she is called a woman thief.

To merit death means: having done that for which she is condemned to death.

Found[^18] means: she becomes known[^19] by other people, thinking, ‘This one merits death.’

Without having obtained permission means: not asking (for permission).[^20]

King means: where a king governs,[^21] the king’s permission should be obtained.[^22]

Order means: it is called an Order of nuns; the permission of the Order of nuns should be obtained.

Group means: where a group governs, the group’s permission should be obtained.

Company means: where a company governs, the company’s permission should be obtained. *Vin.4.227*

Unless she is allowable means: having set aside one who is allowable. Allowable means: there are two who are allowable: either she who has gone forth among members of other sects, or she who has gone forth among other nuns.[^23]

If she thinks, “I will receive one, unless she is allowable,” and looks about for a group or for a female teacher or for a bowl or for a robe or if she determines a *BD.3.185* boundary,[^24] there is an offence of wrong-doing. As a result of the motion, there is an offence of wrong-doing. As a result of two proclamations, there are grave offences. At the end of the proclamations, there is an offence involving a formal meeting of the Order for the female preceptor, an offence of wrong-doing for the group and for the female teacher.[^25]

She also means: she is so called in reference to the former.

Offence at once means: … therefore again it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.

* * *

*Bi-Ss.2.2.2* If she thinks that she is a thief when she is a thief (and) receives her, unless she is allowable, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. If she is in doubt … offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is not a thief when she is a thief … no offence. If she thinks that she is a thief when she is not a thief, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether she is not a thief, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is not a thief when she is not a thief, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bi-Ss.2.2.3* There is no offence if she receives her, not knowing; if she receives one, she having obtained permission; if she receives one who is made allowable; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.

# Nuns’ Formal Meeting (_Saṅghādisesa_) 3

*Bi-Ss.3.1.1* *BD.3.186* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a nun who was a pupil of Bhaddā Kāpilānī,[^1] having quarrelled with nuns, went to a family of (her) relations[^2] in a village. Bhaddā Kāpilānī, not seeing that nun, asked the nuns, saying: “Where is so and so? She is not to be seen.”

“Lady, she is not to be seen (because) she has quarrelled with nuns.”

“My dears,[^3] a family of her relations are in such and such a village; having gone there, look for her.”

The nuns, having gone there, having seen that nun, spoke thus: “Why did you, lady, come alone? We hope that you were not violated?”

“I was not violated, ladies,” she said. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can a nun go among villages[^4] alone?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun went among villages alone?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, *Vin.4.228* can a nun go among villages alone? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … let the nuns set forth this rule of training:

*BD.3.187*“Whatever nun should go among villages alone, that nun also has fallen into a matter that is an offence at once, entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent away.”

And thus this rule of training for nuns came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bi-Ss.3.2.1* At that time two nuns were going along the high-road from Sāketa to Sāvatthī. On the way there was a river to be crossed.[^5] Then these nuns, having approached a boatman, spoke thus:

“Please, sir, take us across.”

Saying, “I am not able, ladies, to take both across at once,” he made one cross alone with him[^6]; one who was across seduced the one who was across, one who was not across seduced the one who was not across. These, having met afterwards, asked (one another): “I hope that you, lady, were not violated?”

“I was violated, lady. But were you violated, lady?”

“I was violated, lady.” Then these nuns, having arrived at Sāvatthī, told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying :

“How can a nun go to the other side of a river alone?” Then these nuns told this matter to the monks. The monks told this matter to the lord. He said:

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun went to the other side of a river alone?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can a nun go to the other side of a river alone? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … let the nuns set forth this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should go among villages alone, or *BD.3.188* should go to the other side of a river alone, that nun also has fallen into a matter that is an offence at once, entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent away.”

And thus this rule of training for nuns came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bi-Ss.3.3.1* At that time several nuns, going to Sāvatthī through the country of Kosala, arrived in the evening at a certain village. A certain nun there was beautiful, good to look upon, charming. A certain man came to be in love with that nun on account of her appearance. Then that man, appointing a sleeping-place for those nuns, *Vin.4.229* appointed a sleeping-place at one side for this nun. Then this nun, having realised, “This man is obsessed[^7]; if I come at night there will be trouble for me,”[^8] not asking the nuns (for permission), having gone to a certain family, lay down in the sleeping-place. Then that man, having come during the night, searching for that nun, knocked against the nuns. The nuns, not seeing this nun, spoke thus: “Doubtless this nun has gone out together with the man.”

Then this nun, at the end of that night, approached those nuns. The nuns spoke thus to that nun: “Why did you, lady, go out together with the man?”

Saying: “Ladies, I did not go out together with the man,” she told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can a nun be away for a night alone …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun was away for a night alone? … let the nuns set forth this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should go among villages alone, or should go to the other side of a river alone, or should be away for a night alone, that nun also has fallen into a matter that is an offence at once, entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent away.”

And thus this rule of training for nuns came to be laid down by the lord.

* * *

*Bi-Ss.3.4.1* *BD.3.189* At that time several nuns were going along the highroad to Sāvatthī through the country of Kosala. A certain nun there, wanting to relieve herself, having stayed behind alone, went on afterwards. People, having seen that nun, seduced her. Then that nun approached those nuns. The nuns spoke thus to that nun: “Why did you, lady, stay behind alone? We hope that you were not violated?”

“I was violated, ladies.”

Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can a nun stay behind a group alone?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun stayed behind a group alone?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can a nun stay behind a group alone? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not” (yet) pleased … let the nuns set forth this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should go among villages alone, or should go to the other side of a river alone, or should be away for a night alone, or should stay behind a group alone, that nun also *Vin.4.230* has fallen into a matter that is an offence at once, entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent away.”

* * *

*Bi-Ss.3.5.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Should go among villages alone means: in making the first foot cross[^9] the enclosure of a village that is fenced in, there is a grave offence. In making the second foot cross, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.[^10] In making the first foot cross the precincts of a village that is not fenced in, there is a grave offence. In making the second foot cross, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.

Or should go to the other side of a river alone means: having covered up the three circles,[^11] it is called a river *BD.3.190* there wherever, as a nun is crossing over, the inner robe is made wet. In making the first foot cross over,[^12] there is a grave offence. In making the second foot cross over, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.

Or should be away for a night alone means: at sunrise, if leaving a hand’s reach of a nun who is a companion, there is a grave offence. When she has left it, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.

Or should stay behind a group alone means: if she, in what is not a village, in what is jungle, is leaving the range[^13] of sight or the range of hearing of a nun who is a companion, there is a grave offence. When she has left it, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.

She also means: she is so called in reference to the former.

Offence at once means: … therefore again it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.

* * *

*Bi-Ss.3.5.2* There is no offence if the nun who is the companion has gone away or has left the Order or has passed away or has gone over to (another) side[^14]; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.[^15]

*Bi-Ss.4.1.1* *BD.3.191* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time[^1] the nun Caṇḍakālī[^2] was one who made strife, who made quarrels, who made contention, who made brawls, who made disputes in the Order.[^3] The nun Thullanandā protested when a (formal) act was being carried out against her.[^4] At that time the nun Thullanandā went to a village on some business. Then the Order of nuns, thinking: “The nun Thullanandā has gone away,” *Vin.4.231* suspended[^5] the nun Caṇḍakālī for not seeing an offence. The nun Thullanandā having concluded that business in the village, returned again to Sāvatthī. When the nun Thullanandā was coming, the nun Caṇḍakālī neither made ready a seat, nor put out[^6] water for washing her feet, a foot-stool,[^7] a foot-stand,[^8] nor having gone out to meet her did she take her bowl and robe, nor did she offer her drinking-water. The nun Thullanandā spoke thus to the nun Caṇḍakālī:

“Why did you, lady, when I was coming, neither make ready a seat for me nor put out water for washing *BD.3.192* the feet, a foot-stool, a foot-stand, nor having gone out to meet me, take my howl and robe, nor offer me drinking-water?”

“Surely it is this, lady, that I am without a mistress[^9] in regard to this.”

“But why are you, lady, without a mistress?”

“Lady, these nuns, saying of me, ‘She is without a mistress, she is not esteemed, there is no one who can answer for[^10] her,’ suspended me for not seeing an offence.”

The nun Thullanandā, saying, “These are ignorant, these are inexperienced, they do not (even) know a (formal) act or the defect of a (formal) act[^11] or the failure of a (formal) act[^12] or the success of a (formal) act[^13]; but we know a (formal) act and the defect of a (formal) act and the failure of a (formal) act and the success of a (formal) act, and we may make them carry out a (formal) act that was not carried out or we may find fault with[^14] a (formal) act that was carried out,” and having very quickly convened an Order of nuns, she restored[^15] the nun Caṇḍakalī. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:

“How can the lady Thullanandā, without having obtained permission from the Order which carried out the proceedings[^16] in accordance with the rule, the discipline, the teacher’s instruction,[^17] not having learnt the desire[^18] of a group, restore a nun suspended by a complete Order?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā, without having obtained permission … restored a nun suspended by a complete Order?”

“It is true, lord.”

*BD.3.193* The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā, without having obtained permission … restore a nun suspended by a complete Order? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased. And thus, monks, let the nuns set forth this rule of training:

“Whatever nun, without having obtained permission from the Order which carried out the proceedings in accordance with the rule, the discipline, the teacher’s instruction, not having learnt the group’s desire, should restore a nun suspended by a complete Order, that nun also has fallen into a matter that is an offence at once, entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent away.”

* * *

*Bi-Ss.4.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Complete Order means: belonging to the same communion, staying within the same boundary.[^19] *Vin.4.232*

Suspended means: suspended for not seeing or for not making amends for or for not giving up an offence.[^20]

In accordance with the rule, the discipline means: according to whatever is the rule, according to whatever is the discipline.[^21]

(In accordance with) the teacher’s instruction means: in accordance with the conqueror’s instruction, the enlightened one’s instruction.[^22]

Without having obtained permission from the Order which carried out the proceedings means: not having asked (the permission) of the Order which carried out the (formal) act.

Not having learnt[^23] the desire means: not having known the desire of a group.

If she thinks, “I will restore (her),” (and) looks about for a group or determines a boundary, there is an offence of wrong-doing. As a result of the motion, there is an offence of wrong-doing. As a result of two proclamations, *BD.3.194* there are grave offences. At the end of the proclamations, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.

She also means: she is so called in reference to the former.

Offence at once means: … therefore again it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.

* * *

*Bi-Ss.4.2.2* If she thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act (and) restores her, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. If she is in doubt as to whether it is a legally valid act … If she thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act (and) restores her, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. If she thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is not a legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether it is not a legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is not a legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

* * *

*Bi-Ss.4.2.3* There is no offence if, having obtained permission from, the Order which carried out the (formal) act, she restores (her); if she restores (her) having known that it is the desire of the group; if she restores one who is behaving so as to get rid of the fault[^24]; if she restores (her), there being no Order which carried out the (formal) act; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.

*Bi-Ss.5.1.1* *BD.3.195* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Sundarīnanda was beautiful, good to look upon, charming.[^1] People, having seen the nun Sundarīnanda in the refectory, were filled with desire (and) gave the very best meals to the nun Sundarīnanda[^2] who was filled with desire. The nun Sundarīnanda ate as much as she pleased; other nuns did not obtain as much as expected. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Sundarīnanda, filled with desire, having accepted with her own hand from the hand of a man who is filled with desire, solid food, *Vin.4.233* soft food, eat it, partake of it?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Sundarīnanda, filled with desire … ate it, partook of it?’

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the nun Sundarīnanda, filled with desire, having accepted with her own hand … solid food or soft food, eat it, partake of it? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun, filled with desire, having accepted with her own hand from the hand of a man who is filled with desire, solid food or soft food, should eat it or partake of it, that nun also has fallen into a matter that is an offence at once, entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent away.”

* * *

*Bi-Ss.5.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

*BD.3.196* Filled with desire[^3] means: infatuated, full of desire, physically in love with.

Filled with desire[^4] means: infatuated, full of desire, physically in love with.

Man means: a human man, not a _yakkha_, not a departed one, not an animal[^5]; he is learned, competent to be infatuated.

Solid food means: having set aside the five (kinds of) meals[^6] (and) water for cleansing the teeth,[^7] the rest is called solid food.

Soft food means: the five kinds (of) meals: conjey, barley-meal, food made with flour, fish, meat.[^8]

If, thinking, “I will eat, I will partake of,” she accepts, there is a grave offence. For every mouthful there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.

She also means: she is so called in reference to the former.

Offence at once means: … therefore again it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.

* * *

*Bi-Ss.5.2.2* If she accepts water for cleansing the teeth, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

If one is filled with desire (and) she accepts, thinking, “I will eat, I will partake of,” there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful, there is a grave offence. If she accepts water for cleansing the teeth, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

If both are filled with desire (and) thinking, “I will eat, I will partake of,” she accepts from the hand of a _yakkha_ or of a departed one or of a eunuch or of an animal in human form, there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful there is a grave offence. If she accepts water for cleansing the teeth, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

If one is filled with desire (and) she accepts, thinking, “I will eat, I will partake of,” there is an offence of *BD.3.197* wrong-doing. For every mouthful, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she accepts water for cleansing the teeth, there is an offence of wrong-doing. *Vin.4.234*

*Bi-Ss.5.2.3* There is no offence if neither comes to be filled with desire; if she accepts, knowing, “He is not filled with desire”; if he is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.

*Bi-Ss.6.1.1* *BD.3.198* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Sundarīnandā was beautiful, good to look upon, charming. People, having seen the nun Sundarīnandā in the refectory, were filled with desire (and) gave the very best meals to the nun Sundarīnandā.[^1] The nun Sundarīnandā, being scrupulous, did not accept. The nun immediately following her[^2] spoke thus to the nun Sundarīnandā: “Why do you, lady, not accept?”

“He is filled with desire, lady.”

“But are you, lady, filled with desire?”

“I am not filled with desire.”

“What can this man,[^3] whether he is filled with desire or not filled with desire, do to you, lady, since you are not filled with desire? Please, lady, eat or partake of the solid food or the soft food which this man is giving to you, you having accepted it with your own hand.”

Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this nun speak thus: ‘What can this man … Please, lady, eat or partake of … having accepted it with your own hand’?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun spoke thus: ‘What can this man … Please, lady, eat or partake of … having accepted it with your own hand’?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can a nun speak thus: ‘What can this man … Please, lady, eat or partake of … having accepted it with your own hand’? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

*BD.3.199* “Whatever nun should speak thus: ‘What can this man, whether he is filled with desire or not filled with desire, do to you, lady, since you are not filled with desire? Please, lady, eat or partake of the solid food or the soft food which this man is giving to you, you having accepted it with your own hand,’ that nun also has fallen into a matter that is an offence at once, entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent away.”

* * *

*Bi-Ss.6.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Should speak thus: ‘What can this man … with your own hand’ (and) instigates[^4] her, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If, at her bidding she accepts, thinking, “I will eat, I will partake of,” there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every *Vin.4.235* mouthful, there is a grave offence. At the end of the meal, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.

She also means: she is so called in reference to the former.

Offence at once means: … therefore again it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.

* * *

*Bi-Ss.6.2.2* If she instigates her, saying: “Accept water for cleansing the teeth,” there is an offence of wrong-doing. If, at her bidding she accepts, thinking, “I will eat, I will partake of,” there is an offence of wrong-doing.

If one is filled with desire (and) she instigates her saying: “Eat or partake of solid food or soft food from the hand of a _yakkha_ or of a departed one or of a enunch or of an animal in human form,” there is an offence of wrong-doing. If, at her bidding she accepts, thinking: “I will eat, I will partake of,” there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful, there is an offence of wrong-doing. At the end of the meal, there is a grave offence. If she instigates her, saying: “Accept water for cleansing the teeth,” there is an *BD.3.200* offence of wrong-doing. If at her bidding she accepts, thinking: “I will eat, I will partake of,” there is an offence of wrong-doing,

* * *

*Bi-Ss.6.2.3* There is no offence if she instigates her knowing that he is not filled with desire; if she instigates her, thinking: “Being angry, she does not accept”; if she instigates her, thinking: “She does not accept out of compassion for a family”; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.

[^1] *Bi-Ss.10.1.1* *BD.3.201* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Caṇḍakālī, having quarrelled with nuns,[^2] angry, displeased, spoke thus: “I repudiate[^3] the enlightened one, I repudiate _dhamma_, I repudiate the Order, I repudiate the training. What indeed are these recluses who are recluses, daughters of the Sakyans? For there are other recluses, conscientious, scrupulous, desirous of training; I will lead the Brahma-life among these.” Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Caṇḍakālī, a nun, angry, displeased, speak thus: ‘I repudiate … I will lead the Brahma-life among these’?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Caṇḍakālī, angry, displeased, spoke thus: ‘I repudiate … I will lead the Brahma-life among these’?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can the nun Caṇḍakālī, angry, displeased, *Vin.4.236* speak thus: ‘I repudiate … I will lead the Brahma-life among these’? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun, angry, displeased, should speak thus: ‘I repudiate the enlightened one … I repudiate the training. What indeed are these recluses who are recluses, daughters of the Sakyans? For there are other recluses, conscientious, scrupulous,’ desirous of training; I will lead the Brahma-life among these,’ that nun should be spoken to thus by the nuns: ‘Do *BD.3.202* not, lady, angry, displeased, speak thus: “I repudiate the enlightened one … I will lead the Brahma-life among these.” Be satisfied, lady, _dhamma_ is well preached, lead the Brahma-life for the utter ending of ill.’ And if that nun, being spoken to thus by the nuns, persists as before, that nun should be admonished by the nuns up to a third time[^4] for giving up that (course). If, being admonished up to a third time, she should give it up, that is good. If she should not give it up, that nun also has fallen into a matter that is an offence on the third (admonition),[^5] entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent away.”

* * *

*Bi-Ss.10.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Angry, displeased means: dissatisfied, the mind worsened, stubborn.[^6]

Should speak thus means: ‘I repudiate … I will lead the Brahma-life among these.’

That nun means: whatever nun speaks thus.

By the nuns means: by other nuns who see, who hear; she should be told by these[^7]: “Do not, lady, angry, displeased … for the utter ending of ill.” And a second time she should be told, and a third time she should be told. If she gives it up, that is good. If she does not give it up, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If, having heard, they do not speak, there is an offence of wrong-doing. And that nun, having been pulled into the midst of the Order, should be told: “Do not, lady, angry, displeased, speak thus: ‘I repudiate the enlightened one, I repudiate, _dhamma_, I repudiate the Order, I repudiate the training … I will lead the Brahma-life among these.’ Be satisfied, lady, … lead the Brahma-life for the utter ending of ill.” And a second time she should be told, and a third time she *BD.3.203* should be told. If she gives it up, that is good. If she does not give it up, there is an offence of wrong-doing. That nun should be admonished. And thus, monks should she be admonished: the Order should be informed by an experienced, competent nun, saying: “Ladies, let the Order listen to me. This nun so and so, angry, displeased, spoke thus: ‘I repudiate … I will lead the Brahma-life among these.’ She does not give up this course. If it seems right to the Order, let the Order admonish the nun so and so *Vin.4.237* for giving up this course. This is the motion. Ladies, let the Order listen to me. This nun so and so … She does not give up this course. The Order admonishes the nun so and so for the giving up of this course. If the admonition of the mm so and so for the giving up of this course is pleasing to the ladies, let them be silent. If it is not pleasing, then you should speak. And a second time I speak forth this matter … And a third time I speak forth this matter … The nun so and so is admonished by the Order for the giving up of this course. It is pleasing … Thus do I understand this.”

As a result of the motion, there is an offence of wrong-doing; as a result of two proclamations, there are grave offences. At the end of the proclamations, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. If she is committing an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order, the offence of wrong-doing according to the motion and the grave offences according to the two proclamations, subside.[^8]

She also means: she is so called in reference to the former.

Up to the third time means: she falls on the third admonition, not through transgression of a course.[^9]

Involving being sent away means: she is caused to be sent away by the Order.

Offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order means: *BD.3.204* … therefore again it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.

* * *

*Bi-Ss.10.2.2* If she thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act (and) does not give it up, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. If she is in doubt as to whether it is a legally valid act … If she thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act (and) does not give it up, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. If she thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is not a legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether it is not a legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is not a legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing.[^10]

* * *

*Bi-Ss.10.2.3* There is no offence if she is not admonished, if she gives it up; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.[^11]

[^1] *Bi-Ss.11.1.1* *BD.3.205* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Caṇḍakālī,[^2] overthrown[^3] in some legal question, angry, displeased, spoke thus: “The nuns are following a wrong course through desire *Vin.4.238* and the nuns are following a wrong course through hatred and the nuns are following a wrong course through stupidity and the nuns are following a wrong course through fear.” Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady, the nun Caṇḍakālī … displeased, speak thus: ‘… and the nuns are following a wrong course through fear’?” …

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can the nun Caṇḍakālī, … displeased, speak thus: ‘… and the nuns are following a wrong course through fear’? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … set forth this rule of training:

“Whatever nun, overthrown in some legal question, angry, displeased, should speak thus: ‘The nuns are following a wrong course through desire … and the nuns are following a wrong course through fear,’ that nun should be spoken to thus by the nuns: ‘Do not, lady, overthrown in some legal question, angry, displeased, speak thus: “The nuns are following a wrong course through desire … and the nuns are following a wrong course through fear.” The lady herself[^4] may go (wrong)[^5] from desire, and she may go (wrong) from hatred and she may go (wrong) from stupidity and she may go (wrong) from fear.’ And if this nun, being *BD.3.206* spoken to thus by the nuns, persists as before, she should be admonished up to a third time for giving up that (course). If, being admonished up to a third time, she should give it up, that is good. If she should not give it up, that nun also has fallen into a matter that is an offence on the third (admonition), entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent away.”

* * *

*Bi-Ss.11.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

In some legal question means: legal question means, there are four (kinds of) legal questions: legal questions arising out of disputes, legal questions arising out of censure, legal questions arising out of transgressions, legal questions arising out of obligations.[^6]

Overthrown means: she is called defeated.[^7]

Angry, displeased means: dissatisfied, the mind worsened, stubborn.[^8]

Should speak thus means: saying, “The nuns are following a wrong course through desire … and the nuns are following a wrong course through fear.”

That nun means: whatever nun speaks thus.

By the nuns means: by other nuns who see, who hear; she should be told by these: “Do not, lady, overthrown … and she may go (wrong) from fear.” And a second time she should be told. And a third time she should be told … see *Bi-Ss.10.2.1*–*Bi-Ss.10.2.3*. _Instead of_ Do not, lady, angry, etc., _read_ Do not, lady, *Vin.4.239* overthrown, etc.; _instead of_ this nun so and so, angry, etc., _read_ this nun so and so, overthrown, etc. … if she is the first wrong-doer.

[^1] *Bi-Ss.12.1.1* *BD.3.207* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns who were pupils of the nun Thullanandā lived in company,[^2] they were of evil habits, of evil repute, of evil ways of living,[^3] vexing[^4] the Order of nuns, concealing one another’s sins.[^5] Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns live in company … concealing one another’s sins?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns live in company … concealing one another’s sins?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can nuns live in company … concealing one another’s sins?

It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … let the nuns set forth this rule of training:

“In case nuns live in company, of evil habits, of evil repute, of evil ways of living, vexing the Order of nuns, concealing one another’s sins, those nuns should be spoken to thus by the nuns: ‘Sisters are living in company … *BD.3.208* concealing one another’s sins. Let the ladies desist[^6]; the Order praises this detachment in sisters.’ But if these nuns, being spoken to thus by the nuns, should persist as before, these nuns should be admonished by the nuns up to the third time for giving up that (course). If, being admonished up to the third time they should give it up, that is good. If they should not give it up, these nuns also have fallen into a matter that is an offence on the third (admonition), entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent away.”

* * *

*Bi-Ss.12.2.1* In case nuns means: they are called ordained.

Are living in company means: in company means that they are living in company unbecomingly in regard to body and speech.

Of evil habits means: they are possessed of depraved habits.

Of evil report means: they are notorious[^7] because of (their)[^8] bad reputation.[^9]

Of evil ways of living means: they lead life by means of an evil, wrong mode of livelihood.

Vexing the Order of nuns means: *Vin.4.240* they protest when a (formal) act is being carried out against each other.

Concealing one another’s sins means: they reciprocally conceal a sin.

Those nuns means: those nuns who live in company.

By the nuns means: by other nuns who see, who hear; they should be told by these: “Sisters are living in company … detachment in sisters.” And a second time they should be told. And a third time they should be told … see *Bi-Ss.10.2.1*. _Instead of_ Do not, ladies, angry, _etc., read_ Sisters are living in company, _etc.; instead of_ that nun … does not give up that course _read_ those nuns … do not give up that course; _instead of_ *BD.3.209* this nun so and so _read_ these nuns so and so and so and so are living in company … they do not give up that course … the nuns so and so and so and so should be admonished … are admonished for giving up that course … If they are committing an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order, the offence of wrong-doing according to the motion and the grave offences according to the two proclamations, subside.

Two or three should be admonished together. More than that should not be admonished together.

These nuns also means: they are so called in reference to the former.

Up to the third time means: they fall on the third admonition, not through transgression of a course.

Involving being sent away means: they are caused to be sent away[^10] from the Order,

Offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order means: … therefore again it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.

[^1] *Bi-Ss.13.1.1* *BD.3.210* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Thullanandā, admonished by the Order, spoke thus to the nuns: “Ladies, live you as though in company, do not you live otherwise. For there are in the Order other nuns of such habits, of such repute, of such ways of living, *Vin.4.241* vexing the Order of nuns, concealing one another’s sins[^2]; the Order does not say anything to these. It is to you yourselves that the Order, out of disrespect, out of contempt, out of impatience,[^3] in gossiping, on poor evidence,[^4] says this: ‘Sisters are living in company, of evil habits, of evil repute, of evil ways of living, vexing the Order of nuns, concealing one another’s sins. Let the ladies desist; the Order praises this detachment in sisters.’” Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:

“How can the lady Thullanandā, admonished by the Order, speak thus to nuns: ‘Ladies, live you as though in company … detachment in sisters” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā, admonished by the Order, spoke thus to nuns: ‘Ladies, live you … detachment in sisters’?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā, admonished by the Order, speak thus to nuns:’ Ladies, live you … praises this detachment in sisters’? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should speak thus: ‘Ladies, live you as *BD.3.211* though in company, do not you live otherwise. For there are in the Order other nuns of such habits, of such repute, of such ways of living, vexing the Order of nuns, concealing one another’s sins; the Order does not say anything to these. It is to you yourselves that the Order, out of disrespect, out of contempt, out of impatience, in gossiping, on poor evidence, says this: “Sisters are living in company, of evil habits, of evil repute, of evil ways of living, vexing the Order of nuns, concealing one another’s sins. Let the ladies desist, the Order praises this detachment in sisters,”’—that nun should be spoken to thus by the nuns: ‘Do not, lady, speak thus: “Sisters are living in company … detachment in sisters.”’ And if that nun, being spoken to thus by the nuns, should persist as before, that nun should be admonished by the nuns up to a third time for giving up that (course). If, being admonished up to a third time, she should give it up, that is good. If she should not give it up, this nun also has fallen into a matter that is an offence on the third (admonition), entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent away.”

* * *

*Bi-Ss.13.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Should speak thus means: ‘Ladies, live you as though in company … It is to you yourselves that the Order, out of disrespect means: out of disesteem.

Out of contempt[^5] means: out of disdain.

Out of impatience means: out of ill-temper.[^6]

In gossiping means: made into talk.[^7]

On poor evidence *Vin.4.242* means: not having partisans.[^8]

Says this means: it says, ‘Sisters are living in company … detachment in sisters.’

By the nuns means: by other nuns who see, who hear; she should be told by these: “Do not, lady, speak thus: *BD.3.212* ‘Ladies, live you as though in company … detachment in sisters.’” And a second time she should be told. And a third time she should be told … see *Bi-Ss.10.2.1*–*Bi-Ss.10.2.3*. _Instead of_ do not, lady, angry, etc. _read_ do not, lady, speak thus, etc. _Read_: Ladies, let the Order listen to me. This nun so and so, admonished by the Order, speaks thus to the nuns: ‘Ladies, live you as though in company,’ etc. … if she is the first wrong-doer.

* * *

*Bi-Ss.13.3.1* Recited, ladies, are the seventeen matters that are offences entailing a formal meeting of the Order—nine which are offences at once, eight[^9] on the third (admonition). A nun having fallen into one or other of these shall spend a fortnight in _mānatta_ discipline[^10] before both Orders. If, when the nun has performed the _mānatta_ discipline, the Order of nuns should number twenty, then that nun may be rehabilitated. But if the Order of nuns, numbering less than twenty even by one, should rehabilitate that nun, that nun is not rehabilitated, and those nuns are blameworthy; this is the proper course there. Concerning this, I ask the ladies: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a second time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a third time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? The ladies are quite pure in this matter, therefore they are silent; thus do I understand this.

Nuns’ rules and their analysis

# Nuns’ Forfeiture (_Nissaggiya_) 1

*Bi-NP.1.1.1* *BD.3.213* These thirty rules, ladies, for offences of expiation involving forfeiture come up for recitation.

At that time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time[^1] the group of six nuns made a hoard of many bowls. People, engaged in touring the dwelling-place and seeing (this hoard), looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns make a hoard of many bowls? Will these nuns do a trade in bowls or will they set up an earthenware shop?”

Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six nuns make a hoard of bowls?” …

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six nuns made a hoard of bowls?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the group of six nuns make a hoard of bowls? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun should make a hoard of bowls, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”

* * *

*Bi-NP.1.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Bowl[^2] means: there are two (kinds of) bowls: an iron bowl, a clay bowl. There are three sizes for a bowl: a *BD.3.214* large bowl, a medium-sized bowl, a small bowl. A large bowl means that it takes half an _āḷhaka_ measure of boiled rice, or[^3] a quarter of that quantity of uncooked rice or a suitable curry. A medium-sized bowl means that it, takes a _nāḷika_ measure of boiled rice, a quarter of that quantity of uncooked rice, a suitable curry. *Vin.4.244* A small bowl means that it takes a _pattha_ measure of boiled rice, a quarter of that quantity of uncooked rice, a suitable curry. (A bowl) greater than that is not a bowl, (a bowl) smaller (than that) is not a bowl.

Should make a hoard means: what is not allotted, not assigned.[^4]

It is to be forfeited means: it should be forfeited at sunrise. It should be forfeited to an Order or to a group or to one nun.[^5] And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: That nun, having approached an Order, having arranged her upper robe over one shoulder, having honoured the feet of the senior nuns, having sat down on her haunches, having saluted with joined palms, should speak thus: ‘Ladies, this bowl is to be forfeited by me, a night having elapsed. I forfeit it to the Order.’ Having forfeited it, the offence should be confessed. The offence should be acknowledged by an experienced, competent nun; the bowl forfeited should be given back (with the words): ‘Ladies, let the Order listen to me. This bowl of the nun so and so which had to be forfeited is forfeited (by her) to the Order. If it seems right to the Order, let the Order give back this bowl to the nun so and so.’

That nun, having approached several[^6] nuns, having arranged her upper robe over one shoulder … having saluted with joined palms, should speak thus: ‘Ladies, this bowl is to be forfeited by me, a night having elapsed. *BD.3.215* I forfeit it to the ladies.’ Having forfeited it, the offence should be confessed. The offence should be acknowledged by an experienced, competent nun; the bowl forfeited should be given back (with the words): ‘Let the ladies listen to me. This bowl of the nun so and so which had to be forfeited is forfeited (by her) to the ladies. If it seems right to the ladies, let the ladies give back this bowl to the nun so and so.’

That nun, having approached one nun, having arranged her upper robe over one shoulder, having sat down on her haunches, having saluted with joined palms, should speak thus: ‘Lady, this bowl is to be forfeited by me, a night having elapsed. I forfeit it to the lady.’ Having forfeited it, the offence should be confessed. The offence should be acknowledged by this nun; the bowl forfeited should be given back (with the words): ‘I will give back this bowl to the lady.’

* * *

*Bi-NP.1.2.2* If she thinks that a night has elapsed when it has elapsed, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If she is in doubt as to whether a night has elapsed … If she thinks that a night has not elapsed when it has elapsed, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If she thinks that it is allotted when it is not allotted … If she thinks that it is assigned when it is not assigned *Vin.4.245* … If she thinks that it is bestowed when it is not bestowed … If she thinks that it is lost when it is not lost … If she thinks that it is destroyed when it is not destroyed … If she thinks that it is broken when it is not broken … If she thinks that it is stolen when it is not stolen, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If, not having forfeited the bowl which had to be forfeited, she makes use of it, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that a night has elapsed when it has not elapsed, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether a night has not elapsed, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that a night has not elapsed when it has not elapsed, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bi-NP.1.2.3* *BD.3.216* There is no offence if before sunrise it is allotted, assigned, bestowed, lost, destroyed, broken, if they tear it from her, if they take it on trust; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.[^7]

* * *

*Bi-NP.1.3.1* Then the group of six nuns did not give back a bowl that was forfeited. They told this matter … to the lord. He said: “Monks, a bowl that is forfeited is not to be given back. Whosoever should not give it back, there is an offence of wrong-doing.”[^8]

*Bi-NP.2.1.1* *BD.3.217* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time several nuns, having spent the rains in a village-residence, went to Sāvatthī keeping the customs,[^1] dignified in deportment, badly dressed, wearing shabby robes. Lay-followers having seen these nuns, thinking, “These nuns are keeping the customs … wearing shabby robes, these nuns will have been robbed,” gave robe-material to the Order of nuns not at the right time.[^2] The nun Thullanandā, saying, “Our _kaṭhina_\-cloth is (formally) made,[^3] it was robe-material given at the right time,” having allotted it, had it distributed.[^4] The lay-followers having seen those nuns, spoke thus: “Was not the robe-material received by the ladies?”

“We did not receive robe-material, sirs. The lady Thullanandā, saying, ‘Our _kaṭhina_\-cloth is (formally) made; it was robe-material given at the right time,’ having allotted it, had it distributed.”

*BD.3.218* The lay-followers … spread it about, saying:

“How can the lady Thullanandā, thinking that robe-material (given) not at the right time was robe-material (given) at the right time, having allotted it, have it distributed?”

Nuns heard these lay-followers who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā thinking … have it distributed?”

Then these nuns told this matter to the monks. The monks … to the lord. *Vin.4.246* He said:

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … had it distributed?”

*Bi-NP.2.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Robe-material (given) not at the right time[^5] means: some that has accrued during the eleven months when the _kaṭhina_ cloth is not (formally) made; some that has accrued during the seven months when the _kaṭhina_ cloth is (formally) made; a gift (of material) offered[^6] even at the right time; this means robe-material (given) not at the right time.

If thinking, “It is robe-material (given) at the right *BD.3.219* time,” having allotted it, she has it distributed, in the action there is an offence of wrong-doing; on acquisition it is to be forfeited. It should be forfeited to an Order or to a group or to one nun. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: “Ladies, I, thinking that this robe-material (given) not at the right time was robe-material (given) at the right time, having allotted it, caused it to be distributed; it is to be forfeited by me.

If she is in doubt as to whether it is robe-material (given) not at the right time … there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that it is robe-material (given) at the right time when it is robe-material (given) not at the right time … there is no offence. If she thinks that it is robe-material (given) not at the right time when it is robe-material (given) at the right time, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

*Bi-NP.3.1.1* *BD.3.220* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Thullanandā, having exchanged[^1] a robe with a certain nun, made use of it. Then that nun, having folded up that robe, laid it aside.[^2] The nun Thullanandā spoke thus to that nun: “Lady, that robe *Vin.4.247* which was exchanged by you with me, where is that robe?” Then that nun, having taken out that robe, showed it to the nun Thullanandā. The nun Thullanandā spoke thus to that nun: “Lady, take back[^3] your robe, give[^4] me this robe. That which is yours is yours, that which is mine is mine. Give this to me, take away your own,” and she tore it away.[^5] Then that nun told this matter to the nuns … to the monks. The monks … to the lord. He said:

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … tore it away?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … tear it away? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun, having exchanged a robe with a nun, should afterwards speak thus: ‘Lady, take your robe, give this robe to me. That which is yours is yours, that which is mine is mine. Give this to me, take away *BD.3.221* your own,’ (and) should tear it away or should cause (another) to tear it away, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”[^6]

* * *

*Bi-NP.3.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

With a nun means: with another nun.

Robe means: any one robe of the six (kinds of) robes (including) the least one fit for assignment.[^7]

Having exchanged means: something large for something small or something small for something large.

Should tear it away means[^8]: if she tears it away herself, there is an offence of’ expiation involving forfeiture.

Should cause (another) to tear it away means: if she commands another, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If having commanded once, she then tears many away, it is to be forfeited. It should be forfeited to an Order or to a group or to one nun. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: ‘Ladies, having exchanged this robe with a nun, it was torn away by me; it is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order’ … ‘the Order should give back … let the ladies give back … I will give back (this robe) to the lady.’

* * *

*Bi-NP.3.2.2* If she thinks that she is ordained when she is ordained, (and) having exchanged a robe, tears it away or causes (another) to tear it away, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. *Vin.4.248* If she is in doubt as to whether she is ordained … If she thinks that she is not ordained when she is ordained … involving forfeiture. Having exchanged another requisite, if she tears it away or causes (another) to tear it away, there is an offence of wrong-doing. Having exchanged a robe or another requisite with one who is not ordained, if she tears it away or causes (another) to tear it away, there *BD.3.222* is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is not ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

* * *

*Bi-NP.3.2.3* There is no offence if she gives it or takes it from her in a friendly manner; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.

Then a certain lay-follower approached the nun Thullanandā, and having approached he spoke thus to the nun Thullanandā: “What, lady, is your discomfort? What may be brought (for you)?”

“Sir, I am in need of ghee.”

Then that lay-follower, having for a _kahāpaṇa_ brought ghee from the house of a certain shopkeeper, gave it to the nun Thullanandā. The nun Thullanandā said: “I am not in need of ghee, sir, I am in need of oil.” Then that lay-follower approached that shopkeeper, and having approached he spoke thus to that shopkeeper:

“The lady says that she does not need ghee, master, she needs oil. You take[^1] the ghee (and) give me the oil.”

“If we, master, take back again goods that were bought, when will our goods be sold? Ghee was taken owing to the purchase of ghee; give for[^2] the purchase of oil (and) you shall take oil”

“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thulla *BD.3.224* nandā, having had one thing asked for, had another thing asked for?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, *Vin.4.249* the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … have another thing asked for? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:

“Whatever nun, having had one thing asked for, should have another thing asked for, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”

* * *

*Bi-NP.4.2.1* Nun means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

Having had one thing asked for means: having had anything whatever asked for.

Should have another asked for means: excepting that (thing), if she has another asked for, in the request[^4] there is an offence of wrong-doing. It is to be forfeited on acquisition. It should be forfeited to an Order or to a group or to one nun. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: “Ladies, having had this thing asked for, the other thing asked for is to be forfeited by me. I forfeit it to the Order.” … “… the Order should give back … let the ladies give back … I will give back (this thing) to the lady.”

* * *

*Bi-NP.4.2.2* If she thinks that one thing is another thing and has the other thing asked for, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If she is in doubt as to whether one thing … If she thinks that an identical thing[^5] is another thing … offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If she thinks that another thing is an identical thing (and) has the identical thing asked for, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether it is an identical thing (and) has an identical thing asked for, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that it is an identical thing when it is an identical thing, there is no offence.

* * *

*BD.3.225* *Bi-NP.4.2.3* There is no offence if she has that thing asked for and also has another thing asked for[^6]; if having pointed out the advantage, she has it asked for; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.

“Sir, I am not better, I am not keeping going.”

“Lady, I will deposit a _kahāpaṇa_ in the house of such and such a shopkeeper; you can have whatever you want brought from there.”

The nun Thullanandā enjoined a certain probationer, saying: “Go, probationer, fetch oil for the _kahāpaṇa_ from the house of such and such a shopkeeper.”

Then that probationer, *Vin.4.250* having for the _kahāpaṇa_ fetched oil from the house of that shopkeeper, gave it to the nun Thullanandā. The nun Thullanandā said: “I do not need oil, probationer, I need ghee.” Then that probationer approached that shopkeeper; having approached, she spoke thus to that shopkeeper:

“The lady says that she does not need oil, sir, she needs ghee. You take the oil (and) give me the ghee.”

“If we, lady, take back again goods that were bought, when will our goods be sold? Oil was taken owing to the purchase of oil; give for the purchase of ghee (and) you shall take ghee.”

*Bi-NP.6.2.1* Whatever means: … nun is to be understood in this case.

For what was necessary (and) appointed for another thing, destined for another thing means: for what was given for another thing.

Belonging to an Order[^7] means: it is for an Order, not for a group, not for one nun.

Should get something in exchange means: having set aside that for which it was given, if she gets another thing in exchange, there is an offence of wrong-doing in the action; it is to be forfeited on acquisition. It should be forfeited to an Order or to a group or to one nun. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: ‘Ladies, this thing got in exchange for that which was necessary (and) appointed for another thing, destined for another thing, (and) belonging to an Order, *BD.3.230* is to be forfeited by me.

Having acquired what was forfeited, it may be taken as, so to speak, a gift.[^8] If she thinks that it was appointed for another thing when it was not appointed for another thing, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

If she thinks that it was not appointed for another thing when it was not appointed for another thing, there is no offence.

*Bi-NP.6.2.3* There is no offence if she takes[^9] a remainder; if she takes having obtained the owner’s permission[^10]; if there are’ accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.

Is bargaining for means: is asking for. *Vin.4.256*

She may bargain for one (worth) at most four “bronzes” means: she may bargain for one worth sixteen _kahāpaṇas_.

If she should bargain for one (worth) more than that means: if she asks for one (worth) more than that, in the request there is an offence of wrong-doing. It is to be forfeited on acquisition.

*Bi-NP.12.3.1* Recited, ladies, are the thirty rules[^2] for offences of *BD.3.242* expiation involving forfeiture. Concerning them, I ask the ladies: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a second time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a third time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? The ladies are quite pure in this matter; therefore are they silent. Thus do I understand this.

Told are the thirty offences of expiation involving forfeiture *Vin.4.258*
