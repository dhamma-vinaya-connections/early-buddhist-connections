# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 69

*Vin.4.137* *Bu-Pc.69.1.1* *BD.3.27* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks knowingly used to eat together with and be in communion with[^1] and lie down in a sleeping place with Ariṭṭha, the monk who talked thus,[^2] who had not acted according to the rule,[^3] who had got given up that view. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:

“How can the group of six monks knowingly eat together with and be in communion with and lie down in a sleeping place with Ariṭṭha … who has not given up that view?” …

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, knowingly eat together with and are in communion with and lie down in a sleeping place with Ariṭṭha … who has not given up that view?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How can you, foolish men, knowingly eat together with and be in communion with and lie down in a sleeping place with Ariṭṭha … who has not given up that view? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk should knowingly eat together with or be in communion with or lie down in a sleeping place *BD.3.28* with a monk who talks thus, who has not acted according to the rule, who has not given up that view, there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bu-Pc.69.2.1* Whatever means: … monk is to be understood in this case.

He knows means: either he knows by himself or others tell him or (someone) tells him.[^4]

Talks thus means: talks so,[^5] saying: ‘In so far as I understand _dhamma_ taught by the lord, it is that in following those things called stumbling-blocks by the lord there is no stumbling-block at all.’[^6]

Has not acted according to the rule means: he is suspended, not restored.[^7]

*BD.3.29* Together with (to monk) who has not given up that[^8] view means: together with (a monk) who has not given up this[^9] view.

Or should eat with means: there are two (kinds of) eating, eating food and eating _dhamma_. Eating food[^10] means, if he gives or accepts food, there is an offence of expiation. Eating _dhamma_ means, he recites or causes to recite. If he recites or causes a line to be recited, for every line there is an offence of expiation; if he recites or causes a syllable to be recited, for every syllable there is an offence of expiation.[^11] *Vin.4.138*

Or should be in communion with means: if he performs the Observance day (ceremony) or the Invitation ceremony or a (formal) act of the Order[^12] together with one who is suspended, there is an offence of expiation.

Or should lie down in a sleeping place with means: if one who is suspended is lying down and a monk lies down in a sleeping place under the same roof,[^13] there is an offence of expiation. If a monk is lying down and one who is suspended lies down, there is an offence of expiation. Or, if both are lying down, there is an offence of expiation. If, getting up, they lie down again and again, there is an offence of expiation.[^14]

* * *

*Bu-Pc.69.2.2* If he thinks that one is suspended when he is suspended, (and) eats together with or is in communion *BD.3.30* with or lies down in a sleeping place with (him), there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether one is suspended … offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that one is not suspended when he is suspended … no offence. If he thinks that one is suspended when he is not suspended, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether one is not suspended, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that one is not suspended when he is not suspended, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.69.2.3* There is no offence if he knows, “He is not suspended”; if he knows, “He was suspended, he is restored”; if he knows, “He has given up that view”; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.
