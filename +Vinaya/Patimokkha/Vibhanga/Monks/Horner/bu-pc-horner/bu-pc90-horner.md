# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 90

*Bu-Pc.90.1.1* *BD.3.97* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time an itch-cloth[^1] was allowed to the monks by the lord. *Vin.4.172* The group of six monks, thinking: “An itch-cloth is allowed by the lord,” used itch-cloths that were not of a (proper) measure; they went about trailing (these) along[^2] in front as well as behind.[^3] Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six monks use itch-cloths that are not of a (proper) measure” …

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How can you, foolish men, use itch-cloths that are not of a (proper) measure? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“When an itch-cloth is being made for a monk, it must be made to a (proper) measure. This is the (proper) measure here: in length four spans of the accepted span, in breadth two spans. In exceeding this (measure), there is an offence of expiation involving cutting down.”

* * *

*Bu-Pc.90.2.1* Itch-cloth means: it is for covering him who has itch[^4] *BD.3.98* or a small boil[^5] or a running sore[^6] or a thick scab disease[^7] from below the navel to above the knee.

Is being made means: … see *Bu-Pc.89.3* …

_it should be made to a (proper) measure … in breadth two spans (*Bu-Pc.89.3*)_ …

… if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.

The Eighth
