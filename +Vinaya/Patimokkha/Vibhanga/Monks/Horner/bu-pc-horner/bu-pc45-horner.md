# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 45

*Bu-Pc.45.1.1* *BD.2.360* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, having gone to the house of a friend, sat down in a private place together with his wife, the one with the other. Then that man … spread it about, saying:

“How can master Upananda sit down in a private place together with a woman, the one with the other?”

Monks heard this man who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saving:

“How can the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, sit down in a private place together with a woman, the one with the other?” …

“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, sat down … the one with the other?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:

“How can you, foolish man, sit down … the one with the other? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk should sit down in a private place together with a woman, the one with the other, there is an offence of expiation.”[^1]

* * *

*Bu-Pc.45.2.1* Whatever means: … is monk to be understood in this case.

Woman means: a human woman, not a female _yakkha_, not a female departed one, not a female animal, one who is learned, competent to know good speech and bad speech, what is lewd and what is not lewd.[^2]

*BD.2.361* Together with means: together.[^3]

The one with, the other means: there is a monk and also a woman.[^4]

A private place means: … private from the eye … ordinary talk.[^5]

*Bu-Pc.45.3.1* Should sit down means: … see *Bu-Pc.44.2.1*. _Instead of_ in a private place on a secluded seat _read_ in a private place, the one with the other … if he is the first wrong-doer.

The Fifth *Vin.4.98*
