# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 91

*Bu-Pc.91.1.1* *BD.3.99* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a cloth for the rains[^1] was allowed to monks by the lord.[^2] The group of six monks, thinking: “A cloth for the rains is allowed by the lord,” wore cloths for the rains that were not of a (proper) measure; they went about trailing (these) along in front as well as behind.[^3] Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: see *Bu-Pc.90.1* … “… should be set forth:

“When a cloth for the rains is being made for a monk, it must be made to a (proper) measure. This is the (proper) measure here: in length six spans of the accepted span, in breadth two and a half spans.[^4] In exceeding this (measure), there is an offence of expiation involving cutting down.” *Vin.4.173*

* * *

*Bu-Pc.91.2.1* Cloth for the rains means: it is for the four months of the rainy season.

Is being made means: … _it must be made to a (proper) measure_ … if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.
