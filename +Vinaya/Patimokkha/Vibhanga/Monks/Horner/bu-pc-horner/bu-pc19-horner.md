# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 19

*Bu-Pc.19.1.1* *BD.2.257* *Vin.4.47* … at Kosambī in Ghosita’s monastery. Now at that time a chief minister, the venerable Channa’s supporter, was having a dwelling-place built for the venerable Channa.[^1] Then the venerable Channa again and again had the finished dwelling-place roofed, again and again had it plastered. The overloaded dwelling-place fell down. Then the venerable Channa, collecting grass and sticks, despoiled the cornfield of a certain brahmin. Then that brahmin looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:

“How can the revered ones despoil our cornfields?” Monks heard this brahmin who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:

“How can the venerable Channa again and again have a finished dwelling-place roofed, again and again have it plastered (so that) the overloaded dwelling-place falls down?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord…

“Is it true, as is said, that you, Channa, again and again had a finished dwelling-place roofed … so that the overloaded dwelling-place fell down?”

“It is true, lord,” he said.

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:

“How can you, foolish man, again and again have a finished dwelling-place roofed, again and again have it plastered, (so that) the overloaded dwelling-place falls down? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“When a large dwelling-place is being built for a monk, *BD.2.258* an enclosure[^2] of two or three roofings may be determined upon for placing the door-bolts, for making the window-holes[^3] as far as the door-way,[^4] in establishing it where there are no crops.[^5] If, though established where there are no crops, he should determine upon (something) more than that, there is an offence of expiation.”[^6]

* * *

*Bu-Pc.19.2.1* Large means: it is so called if it is a dwelling-place having a benefactor.[^7]

Dwelling-place means: it comes to be smeared inside or smeared outside or smeared inside and outside.

Is being made means: making or causing to be made.[^8]

As far as the door-way[^9] means: a reach of the hand from all round the door-posts and lintel.[^10]

For placing the door-bolts means: for placing the door-way.

For making the window-holes means: for making *BD.2.259* windows[^11]: whitewash,[^12] black colouring, the use of red chalk,[^13] wreath-work,[^14] creeper-work, sword-fish design,[^15] cupboards.[^16] *Vin.4.48*

An enclosure of two or three roofings should be determined upon, in establishing it where there are no crops means: crops mean: grain and pulses.[^17] If it is established where there are crops (and) he determines upon (some alteration), there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is roofing with a way, having determined upon two ways, commanding a third way, he may depart.[^18] If he is roofing with an enclosure, having determined upon two enclosures, commanding a third enclosure, he may depart.

If, though established where there are no crops, he should determine upon (something) more than that[^19] means: if he is roofing with tiles, for every tile there is an offence of expiation. If he is roofing with stones, for every stone there is an offence of expiation. If he is roofing with plaster, for every lump there is an offence of expiation. If he is roofing with grass, for every wisp there is an *BD.2.260* offence of expiation. If he is roofing with leaves, for every leaf there is an offence of expiation.[^20]

* * *

*Bu-Pc.19.2.2* If he thinks that it is more when it is more than two or three enclosures (and) determines upon,[^21] there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it is more than two or three enclosures (and) determines upon, there is an offence of expiation. If he thinks that it is less when it is more than two or three enclosures (and) determines upon, there is an offence of expiation. If he thinks that it is more when it is less than two or three enclosures, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is less than two or three enclosures, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is less when it is less than two or three enclosures, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.19.2.3* There is no offence if there are two or three enclosures; if there are less than two or three enclosures; if it is in a cave, if it is in a hut, if it is in a _tiṇa_\-grass hut; if it is for another; if it is by means of his own property[^22]; except it be as a house there is no offence in any other circumstances; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.[^23]
