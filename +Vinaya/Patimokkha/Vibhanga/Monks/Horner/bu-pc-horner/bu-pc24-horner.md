# Monks’ Expiation (_Pācittiya_) 24

*Bu-Pc.24.1.1* *BD.2.279* … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time monks who were elders, exhorting nuns, came to receive requisites of robes, alms-food, lodgings, medicines for the sick.[^1] The group of six monks spoke thus:

“The monks who are elders are not doing a service[^2] in exhorting nuns; the monks who are elders *Vin.4.58* are exhorting nuns for the sake of gain.”

Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:

“How can this group of six monks speak thus: ‘The monks who are elders … for the sake of gain’?” …

“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, spoke thus: ‘The monks who are elders … for the sake of gain’?”

“It is true, lord.”

The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:

“How can you, foolish men, speak thus: ‘The monks who are elders … for the sake of gain’? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing, those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:

“Whatever monk should speak thus: ‘The monks who are elders are exhorting nuns for the sake of gain,’ there is an offence of expiation.”

* * *

*Bu-Pc.24.2.1* Whatever means: … is monk to be understood in this case.

*BD.2.280* For the sake of gain means: for the sake of robes, for the sake of alms-food, for the sake of lodgings, for the sake of the requisite of medicines for the sick, for the sake of honour, for the sake of respect, for the sake of reverence, for the sake of homage, for the sake of veneration.

Should speak thus means: if desiring to bring blame,[^3] desiring to bring discredit, desiring to bring shame[^4] to one who is ordained (and) agreed upon by the Order as exhorter of nuns, he speaks thus, saying: ‘He is exhorting for the sake of robes … for the sake of veneration,’ there is an offence of expiation.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.24.2.2* If he thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act, (and) speaks thus, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it is a legally valid act, (and) speaks thus, there is an offence of expiation. If he thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act, (and) speaks thus, there is an offence of expiation. If, desiring to bring blame, desiring to bring discredit, desiring to bring shame to one who is ordained (but) not agreed upon by the Order as exhorter of nuns, he speaks thus, saying: ‘He is exhorting for the sake of robes … for the sake of veneration,’ there is an offence of wrong-doing. If, desiring to bring blame … to bring shame to one not ordained,[^5] agreed upon or not agreed upon by the Order as exhorter of nuns, he speaks thus, saying, ‘He is exhorting … for the sake of veneration,’ there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is not a legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not a legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is not a legally valid act, there is no offence.

* * *

*Bu-Pc.24.2.3* *BD.2.281* There is no offence if he usually speaks exhorting for the sake of robes … for the sake of veneration; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.

The Fourth *Vin.4.59*
