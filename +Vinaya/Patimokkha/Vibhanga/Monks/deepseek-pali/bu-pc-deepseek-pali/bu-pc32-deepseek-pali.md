## 2. Gaṇabhojanasikkhāpadaṃ

## 2.The training rule concerning group meals.

209. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā rājagahe viharati veḷuvane kalandakanivāpe. Tena kho pana samayena devadatto parihīnalābhasakkāro sapariso kulesu viññāpetvā viññāpetvā bhuñjati. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma samaṇā sakyaputtiyā kulesu viññāpetvā viññāpetvā bhuñjissanti! Kassa sampannaṃ na manāpaṃ, kassa sāduṃ na ruccatī’’ti! Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū tesaṃ manussānaṃ ujjhāyantānaṃ khiyyantānaṃ vipācentānaṃ. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma devadatto sapariso kulesu viññāpetvā viññāpetvā bhuñjissatī’’ti…pe… saccaṃ kira tvaṃ, devadatta, sapariso kulesu viññāpetvā viññāpetvā bhuñjasīti? ‘‘Saccaṃ, bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… kathañhi nāma tvaṃ, moghapurisa, sapariso kulesu viññāpetvā viññāpetvā bhuñjissasi! Netaṃ, moghapurisa, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

209.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Now at that time, Devadatta, having lost his gains and honor, was going from family to family with his retinue, soliciting and eating food. People complained, criticized, and spread it about: "How can these Sakyan ascetics go from family to family soliciting and eating food? Who doesn’t like what is plentiful? Who doesn’t enjoy what is tasty?" The monks heard these people complaining, criticizing, and spreading it about. Those monks who were of few desires… they complained, criticized, and spread it about: "How can Devadatta with his retinue go from family to family soliciting and eating food?" … "Is it true, Devadatta, that you with your retinue go from family to family soliciting and eating food?" "It is true, Blessed One." The Blessed One rebuked him: "… Foolish man, how can you with your retinue go from family to family soliciting and eating food? This will not lead to confidence in the unconvinced…" "Therefore, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:"

‘‘Gaṇabhojane pācittiya’’nti.

"Eating in a group is a pācittiya offense."

Evañcidaṃ bhagavatā bhikkhūnaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ paññattaṃ hoti.

Thus was this training rule laid down for the monks by the Blessed One.

210. Tena kho pana samayena manussā gilāne bhikkhū bhattena nimantenti. Bhikkhū kukkuccāyantā nādhivāsenti – ‘‘paṭikkhittaṃ bhagavatā gaṇabhojana’’nti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, gilānena bhikkhunā gaṇabhojanaṃ bhuñjituṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

210.Now at that time people invited sick monks for a meal. The monks, being scrupulous, did not consent, thinking, "The Blessed One has prohibited group meals." They reported this matter to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, in this connection, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: "Monks, I allow a sick monk to partake of a group meal. And thus, monks, you should recite this training rule:

‘‘Gaṇabhojane, aññatra samayā, pācittiyaṃ. Tatthāyaṃ samayo. Gilānasamayo – ayaṃ tattha samayo’’ti.

"Eating in a group, except at the proper time, is a pācittiya offense. Herein, this is the proper time: the time of sickness—this is the proper time herein."

Evañcidaṃ bhagavatā bhikkhūnaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ paññattaṃ hoti.

Thus was this training rule laid down for the monks by the Blessed One.

211. Tena kho pana samayena manussā cīvaradānasamaye sacīvarabhattaṃ paṭiyādetvā bhikkhū nimantenti – ‘‘bhojetvā cīvarena acchādessāmā’’ti. Bhikkhū kukkuccāyantā nādhivāsenti – ‘‘paṭikkhittaṃ bhagavatā gaṇabhojana’’nti. Cīvaraṃ parittaṃ uppajjati. Bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… anujānāmi, bhikkhave, cīvaradānasamaye gaṇabhojanaṃ bhuñjituṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

211.Now at that time, people, on the occasion of giving robes, having prepared food with robes, invited the monks, saying, "Having fed you, we will clothe you with robes." The monks, being scrupulous, did not accept, thinking, "The Blessed One has prohibited group meals." Robes arose in small quantity. The monks reported this matter to the Blessed One… "Monks, I allow a group meal to be partaken of on the occasion of giving robes. And thus, monks, you should recite this training rule:

‘‘Gaṇabhojane, aññatra samayā, pācittiyaṃ. Tatthāyaṃ samayo. Gilānasamayo, cīvaradānasamayo – ayaṃ tattha samayo’’ti.

"Eating in a group, except at the proper time, is a pācittiya offense. Herein, this is the proper time: the time of sickness, the time of robe-giving—this is the proper time herein."

Evañcidaṃ bhagavatā bhikkhūnaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ paññattaṃ hoti.

Thus was this training rule laid down for the monks by the Blessed One.

212.Now at that time, people invited monks who were making robes for a meal. The monks, being scrupulous, did not accept, thinking, "The Blessed One has prohibited group meals." They reported this matter to the Blessed One… "Monks, I allow a group meal to be partaken of during the time of robe-making. And thus, monks, you should recite this training rule:

‘‘Gaṇabhojane, aññatra samayā, pācittiyaṃ. Tatthāyaṃ samayo. Gilānasamayo, cīvaradānasamayo, cīvarakārasamayo – ayaṃ tattha samayo’’ti.

"Eating in a group, except at the proper time, is a pācittiya offense. Herein, this is the proper time: the time of sickness, the time of robe-giving, the time of robe-making—this is the proper time herein."

Evañcidaṃ bhagavatā bhikkhūnaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ paññattaṃ hoti.

Thus was this training rule laid down for the monks by the Blessed One.

Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… anujānāmi, bhikkhave, addhānagamanasamaye gaṇabhojanaṃ bhuñjituṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

213.Now at that time, monks were traveling a road with some people. Then those monks said to those people: "Friends, wait a moment; we will go for alms." They replied: "Venerable sirs, please eat right here." The monks, being scrupulous, did not accept, thinking: "The Blessed One has prohibited group meals." They reported this matter to the Blessed One… "Monks, I allow a group meal to be partaken of during the time of traveling a road. And thus, monks, you should recite this training rule:

‘‘Gaṇabhojane, aññatra samayā, pācittiyaṃ. Tatthāyaṃ samayo. Gilānasamayo, cīvaradānasamayo, cīvarakārasamayo, addhānagamanasamayo – ayaṃ tattha samayo’’ti.

"Eating in a group, except at the proper time, is a pācittiya offense. Herein, this is the proper time: the time of sickness, the time of robe-giving, the time of robe-making, the time of traveling a road—this is the proper time herein."

214.Now at that time, monks were traveling by boat with some people. Then those monks said to those people: "Friends, bring the boat to shore for a moment; we will go for alms." They replied: "Venerable sirs, please eat right here." The monks, being scrupulous, did not accept, thinking: "The Blessed One has prohibited group meals." They reported this matter to the Blessed One… "Monks, I allow a group meal to be partaken of during the time of embarking on a boat. And thus, monks, you should recite this training rule:

‘‘Gaṇabhojane, aññatra samayā, pācittiyaṃ. Tatthāyaṃ samayo. Gilānasamayo, cīvaradānasamayo, cīvarakārasamayo, addhānagamanasamayo, nāvābhiruhanasamayo – ayaṃ tattha samayo’’ti.

215.Now at that time, monks who had spent the rains in various regions came to Rājagaha to see the Blessed One. People, seeing monks from various districts, invited them for a meal. The monks, being scrupulous, did not consent, thinking, "The Blessed One has prohibited group meals." They reported this matter to the Blessed One… "Monks, I allow a group meal to be partaken of during a great occasion. And thus, monks, you should recite this training rule:

‘‘Gaṇabhojane, aññatra samayā, pācittiyaṃ. Tatthāyaṃ samayo. Gilānasamayo, cīvaradānasamayo, cīvarakārasamayo, addhānagamanasamayo, nāvābhiruhanasamayo, mahāsamayo – ayaṃ tattha samayo’’ti.

Evañcidaṃ bhagavatā bhikkhūnaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ paññattaṃ hoti.

Thus was this training rule laid down for the monks by the Blessed One.

Atha kho so ājīvako bhikkhūnaṃ santike dūtaṃ pāhesi – ‘‘adhivāsentu me bhikkhū svātanāya bhatta’’nti. Bhikkhū kukkuccāyantā nādhivāsenti – ‘‘paṭikkhittaṃ bhagavatā gaṇabhojana’’nti. Atha kho so ājīvako yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavatā saddhiṃ sammodi, sammodanīyaṃ kathaṃ sāraṇīyaṃ vītisāretvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi. Ekamantaṃ ṭhito kho so ājīvako bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘bhavampi gotamo pabbajito, ahampi pabbajito; arahati pabbajito pabbajitassa piṇḍaṃ paṭiggahetuṃ. Adhivāsetu me bhavaṃ gotamo svātanāya bhattaṃ saddhiṃ bhikkhusaṅghenā’’ti. Adhivāsesi bhagavā tuṇhībhāvena. Atha kho so ājīvako bhagavato adhivāsanaṃ viditvā pakkāmi. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, samaṇabhattasamaye gaṇabhojanaṃ bhuñjituṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

216.Now at that time, a blood relative of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha had gone forth among the Ājīvakas. Then that Ājīvaka approached King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and said to him: "Great king, I wish to prepare a meal for all the ascetic groups." [The king replied:] "Venerable sir, if you would first feed the community of monks headed by the Buddha." [The Ājīvaka replied:] "I will do so." Then that Ājīvaka sent a messenger to the monks: "May the monks accept my meal for tomorrow." The monks, being scrupulous, did not accept, thinking: "The Blessed One has prohibited group meals." Then that Ājīvaka approached the Blessed One, exchanged greetings, and after an exchange of friendly and courteous conversation, stood to one side. Standing there, he said to the Blessed One: "The venerable Gotama is a renunciant, and I am a renunciant. It is fitting for a renunciant to accept alms from another renunciant. May the venerable Gotama accept tomorrow's meal together with the community of monks." The Blessed One consented by remaining silent. Understanding the Blessed One's consent, the Ājīvaka departed. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, in this connection, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: "Monks, I allow a group meal to be partaken of during the time of a meal for ascetics. And thus, monks, you should recite this training rule:

217. Gaṇabhojane , aññatra samayā, pācittiyaṃ. Tatthāyaṃ samayo. Gilānasamayo, cīvaradānasamayo, cīvarakārasamayo, addhānagamanasamayo, nāvābhiruhanasamayo, mahāsamayo, samaṇabhattasamayo – ayaṃ tattha samayo’’ti.

217.Eating in a group, except at the proper time, is a pācittiya offense. Herein, this is the proper time: the time of sickness, the time of robe-giving, the time of robe-making, the time of traveling a road, the time of embarking on a boat, a great occasion, the time of a meal for ascetics—this is the proper time herein.

218. Gaṇabhojanaṃ nāma yattha cattāro bhikkhū pañcannaṃ bhojanānaṃ aññatarena bhojanena nimantitā bhuñjanti. Etaṃ gaṇabhojanaṃ nāma.

219.If, perceiving it as a group meal, he eats at other than the proper time, there is an offense entailing confession. If, being uncertain about a group meal, he eats at other than the proper time, there is an offense entailing confession. If, perceiving it as not a group meal, he eats at other than the proper time, there is an offense entailing confession.

220.There is no offense at the proper time, that is, in any of the seven proper times. There is no offense for those who, even having accepted an improper invitation, eat two or three together. There is no offense for those who, having gone for alms, gather together to eat; for regular meals, ticket meals, fortnightly meals, Uposatha meals, the day-after-Uposatha meals; and setting aside the five foods; and in all cases, there is no offense for one who is insane or is a beginner.
