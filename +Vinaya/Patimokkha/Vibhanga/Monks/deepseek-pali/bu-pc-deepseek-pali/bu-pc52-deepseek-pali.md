## 2. Aṅgulipatodakasikkhāpadaṃ

## 2.The Training Rule on Poking with a Finger.

330. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū sattarasavaggiyaṃ bhikkhuṃ aṅgulipatodakena hāsesuṃ. So bhikkhu uttanto anassāsako kālamakāsi. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma chabbaggiyā bhikkhū bhikkhuṃ aṅgulipatodakena hāsessantī’’ti…pe… saccaṃ kira tumhe, bhikkhave, bhikkhuṃ aṅgulipatodakena hāsethāti? ‘‘Saccaṃ, bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… kathañhi nāma tumhe, moghapurisā, bhikkhuṃ aṅgulipatodakena hāsessatha! Netaṃ, moghapurisā, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

330.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time, the group-of-six bhikkhus made a bhikkhu of the group of seventeen laugh by poking him with a finger. That bhikkhu, exhausted and unable to breathe, died. Those bhikkhus of few desires… complained and criticized them: “How could the group-of-six bhikkhus make a bhikkhu laugh by poking him with a finger?”… “Is it true, bhikkhus, that you made a bhikkhu laugh by poking him with a finger?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One rebuked them… “Foolish men, how could you make a bhikkhu laugh by poking him with a finger! This, foolish men, is not for the confidence of those who are not yet confident… And thus, bhikkhus, you should recite this training rule:

331. ‘‘Aṅgulipatodake pācittiya’’nti.

331.There is a pācittiya for poking with a finger.

332. Aṅgulipatodako nāma [aṅgulipatodako nāma aṅguliyāpi tudanti (syā.)] upasampanno upasampannaṃ hasādhippāyo [hassādhippāyo (sī. syā.)] kāyena kāyaṃ āmasati, āpatti pācittiyassa. Upasampanne upasampannasaññī aṅgulipatodakena hāseti, āpatti pācittiyassa. Upasampanne vematiko aṅgulipatodakena hāseti, āpatti pācittiyassa. Upasampanne anupasampannasaññī aṅgulipatodakena hāseti, āpatti pācittiyassa.

332.“Poking with a finger” means: a fully ordained bhikkhu, intending to make another fully ordained bhikkhu laugh, touches body to body—there is a pācittiya offense. If he perceives the other as fully ordained and pokes him with a finger, there is a pācittiya offense. If he is uncertain about the other, whether he is fully ordained, and pokes him with a finger, there is a pācittiya offense. If he perceives the other as not fully ordained and pokes him with a finger, there is a pācittiya offense.

If he perceives an unordained person as unordained, there is an offense of wrong-doing.

334. Anāpatti na hasādhippāyo, sati karaṇīye āmasati, ummattakassa, ādikammikassāti.

334.There is no offense if he does not intend to make (another) laugh, if he touches for a necessary reason, if he is insane, or if he is the first offender.

Aṅgulipatodakasikkhāpadaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ dutiyaṃ.
