## 4. Padasodhammasikkhāpadaṃ

## 4.The training rule concerning teaching the Dhamma word by word.

44. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū upāsake padaso dhammaṃ vācenti. Upāsakā bhikkhūsu agāravā appatissā asabhāgavuttikā viharanti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma chabbaggiyā bhikkhū upāsake padaso dhammaṃ vācessanti! Upāsakā bhikkhūsu agāravā appatissā asabhāgavuttikā viharantī’’ti. Atha kho te bhikkhū chabbaggiye bhikkhū anekapariyāyena vigarahitvā bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ kira tumhe, bhikkhave, upāsake padaso dhammaṃ vācetha; upāsakā bhikkhūsu agāravā appatissā asabhāgavuttikā viharantī’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ, bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… kathañhi nāma tumhe, moghapurisā, upāsake padaso dhammaṃ vācessatha! Upāsakā bhikkhūsu agāravā appatissā asabhāgavuttikā viharanti! Netaṃ, moghapurisā, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya pasannānaṃ vā bhiyyobhāvāya…pe… evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

44.At that time the Blessed One, the Buddha, was staying at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. Now at that time, the group-of-six monks were teaching the Dhamma to lay followers word by word. The lay followers became disrespectful, irreverent, and behaved improperly towards the monks. Those monks who were modest… criticized and complained: "How can the group-of-six monks teach the Dhamma to lay followers word by word! The lay followers have become disrespectful, irreverent, and behaved improperly towards the monks!" Then those monks, having rebuked the group-of-six monks in many ways, reported the matter to the Blessed One… "Is it true, monks, that you teach the Dhamma to lay followers word by word, and that the lay followers have become disrespectful, irreverent, and behaved improperly towards the monks?" "It is true, Blessed One." The Buddha rebuked them… "How can you, foolish men, teach the Dhamma to lay followers word by word! The lay followers have become disrespectful, irreverent, and behaved improperly towards the monks! This will not lead to faith in those without it or increase it in those who have it…" And then, monks, this training rule should be recited:

45. ‘‘Yo pana bhikkhu anupasampannaṃ padaso dhammaṃ vāceyya pācittiya’’nti.

45."If a bhikkhu teaches the Dhamma word by word to one who is not fully ordained, he commits an offense of expiation."

46. Yo panāti yo yādiso…pe… bhikkhūti…pe… ayaṃ imasmiṃ atthe adhippeto bhikkhūti.

46."Yo pana": whoever; "bhikkhu": the bhikkhu intended in this matter.

Anupasampanno nāma bhikkhuñca bhikkhuniñca ṭhapetvā avaseso anupasampanno nāma.

"Not fully ordained" means anyone apart from a bhikkhu (monk) or a bhikkhuni (nun); all others are called "not fully ordained."

Padaso nāma padaṃ, anupadaṃ, anvakkharaṃ, anubyañjanaṃ.

"Padaso" means a word, a subsequent word, a letter, a subsequent letter.

Padaṃ nāma ekato paṭṭhapetvā ekato osāpenti. Anupadaṃ nāma pāṭekkaṃ paṭṭhapetvā ekato osāpenti. Anvakkharaṃ nāma ‘‘rūpaṃ anicca’’nti vuccamāno, ‘‘ru’’nti opāteti. Anubyañjanaṃ nāma ‘‘rūpaṃ anicca’’nti vuccamāno, ‘‘vedanā aniccā’’ti saddaṃ nicchāreti.

Teaching 'word by word' (pada) means beginning a word together and ending it together. Teaching 'subsequent word by subsequent word' (anupada) means beginning each word individually and ending it together. Teaching 'letter by letter' (anvakkhara) means, when 'form is impermanent' is being said, one prompts with 'ru.' Teaching 'subsequent letter by subsequent letter' (anubyañjana) means, when 'form is impermanent' is being said, one utters the sound 'feeling is impermanent.'

Yañca padaṃ, yañca anupadaṃ, yañca anvakkharaṃ, yañca anubyañjanaṃ – sabbametaṃ padaso [padaso dhammo (itipi)] nāma.

Whatever is a word, a subsequent word, a letter, or a subsequent letter—all this is called “word by word.”

Dhammo nāma buddhabhāsito, sāvakabhāsito, isibhāsito, devatābhāsito, atthūpasañhito, dhammūpasañhito.

“Dhamma” means spoken by the Buddha, spoken by a disciple, spoken by a sage, spoken by a deity, based on the commentaries, based on the Pāli text.

Vāceyyāti padena vāceti, pade pade āpatti pācittiyassa. Akkharāya vāceti, akkharakkharāya āpatti pācittiyassa.

“Causes to recite” means if he teaches word by word, for each word there is an offense of expiation. If he teaches letter by letter, for each letter there is an offense of expiation.

47. Anupasampanne anupasampannasaññī padaso dhammaṃ vāceti, āpatti pācittiyassa. Anupasampanne vematiko padaso dhammaṃ vāceti, āpatti pācittiyassa. Anupasampanne upasampannasaññī padaso dhammaṃ vāceti, āpatti pācittiyassa.

47.If he teaches the Dhamma word by word to one who is not fully ordained, perceiving them as not fully ordained, there is an offense of expiation. If he teaches the Dhamma word by word to one who is not fully ordained, being uncertain of their status, there is an offense of expiation. If he teaches the Dhamma word by word to one who is not fully ordained, perceiving them as fully ordained, there is an offense of expiation.

Upasampanne anupasampannasaññī, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Upasampanne vematiko, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Upasampanne upasampannasaññī, anāpatti.

If he teaches to one who is fully ordained, perceiving them as not fully ordained, there is an offense of wrong-doing. If he teaches to one who is fully ordained, being uncertain of their status, there is an offense of wrong-doing. If he teaches to one who is fully ordained, perceiving them as fully ordained, there is no offense.

48. Anāpatti ekato uddisāpento, ekato sajjhāyaṃ karonto, yebhuyyena paguṇaṃ ganthaṃ bhaṇantaṃ opāteti, osārentaṃ opāteti, ummattakassa, ādikammikassāti.

48.There is no offense if he causes (them) to recite together, if he studies together, if he prompts one who is reciting a text that is mostly fluent, if he prompts one who is finishing, for one who is insane, or for the first offender.

Padasodhammasikkhāpadaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ catutthaṃ.

The fourth training rule concerning teaching the Dhamma word by word is finished.
