## 10. Dantaponasikkhāpadaṃ

## 10.The Tooth-cleaning Training Rule

263. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā vesāliyaṃ viharati mahāvane kūṭāgārasālāyaṃ. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu sabbapaṃsukūliko susāne viharati. So manussehi diyyamānaṃ na icchati paṭiggahetuṃ, susānepi rukkhamūlepi ummārepi ayyavosāṭitakāni sāmaṃ gahetvā paribhuñjati [bhuñjati (syā.)]. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma ayaṃ bhikkhu amhākaṃ ayyavosāṭitakāni sāmaṃ gahetvā paribhuñjissati! Theroyaṃ bhikkhu vaṭharo manussamaṃsaṃ maññe khādatī’’ti! Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū tesaṃ manussānaṃ ujjhāyantānaṃ khiyyantānaṃ vipācentānaṃ. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma bhikkhu adinnaṃ mukhadvāraṃ āhāraṃ āharissatī’’ti…pe… saccaṃ kira tvaṃ, bhikkhu, adinnaṃ mukhadvāraṃ āhāraṃ āharasīti? ‘‘Saccaṃ, bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… kathañhi nāma tvaṃ, moghapurisa, adinnaṃ mukhadvāraṃ āhāraṃ āharissasi! Netaṃ, moghapurisa, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

263.At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the Great Wood, at the hall with the peaked roof. Now at that time, a certain bhikkhu who was a ‘universal scavenger’ (sabbapaṃsukūlika) was dwelling in a charnel ground. He did not wish to accept what was given to him by people. Instead, he took for himself offerings discarded for ancestors from the charnel ground, from the foot of trees, or from rubbish heaps, and used them. People complained, criticized, and spread it about: “How can this bhikkhu take our ancestors’ discarded offerings for himself and use them? This bhikkhu is stout and sturdy; it seems he eats human flesh!” The bhikkhus heard these people complaining, criticizing, and spreading it about. Those bhikkhus who were modest… criticized him: “How can this bhikkhu consume food not given through the mouth-door?”… “Is it true, bhikkhu, that you consume food not given through the mouth-door?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One rebuked him… “Foolish man, how can you consume food not given through the mouth-door? This is not for the confidence of the unconfident… And thus, bhikkhus, this training rule should be recited:

‘‘Yo pana bhikkhu adinnaṃ mukhadvāraṃ āhāraṃ āhareyya, pācittiya’’nti.

“Whatever bhikkhu should consume food not given through the mouth-door, there is an offense entailing confession.”

Evañcidaṃ bhagavatā bhikkhūnaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ paññattaṃ hoti.

Thus this training rule was laid down for the bhikkhus by the Blessed One.

264. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū udakadantapone [udakadantapoṇe (syā. ka.)] kukkuccāyanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, udakadantaponaṃ sāmaṃ gahetvā paribhuñjituṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

264.At that time, the bhikkhus were anxious about water for tooth-cleaning. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, I allow you to take and use water for tooth-cleaning yourselves. And thus, bhikkhus, you should recite this training rule:

265. ‘‘Yo pana bhikkhu adinnaṃ mukhadvāraṃ āhāraṃ āhareyya, aññatra udakadantaponā, pācittiya’’nti.

265.“Whatever bhikkhu should consume food not given through the mouth-door, except for water for tooth-cleaning, there is an offense entailing confession.”

266. Yo panāti yo yādiso…pe… bhikkhūti…pe… ayaṃ imasmiṃ atthe adhippeto bhikkhūti.

266.‘Whatever’ means whoever, of whatever sort… ‘Bhikkhu’ means… in this context, ‘bhikkhu’ is intended in this sense.

Adinnaṃ nāma appaṭiggahitakaṃ vuccati.

‘Not given’ means what has not been received.

Dinnaṃ nāma kāyena vā kāyapaṭibaddhena vā nissaggiyena vā dente hatthapāse ṭhito kāyena vā kāyapaṭibaddhena vā paṭiggaṇhāti, etaṃ dinnaṃ nāma.

‘Given’ means when a person, standing within arm’s reach, gives something with the body, or with something connected to the body, or by relinquishing it, and one accepts it with the body or with something connected to the body. This is called ‘given’.

Āhāro nāma udakadantaponaṃ ṭhapetvā yaṃkiñci ajjhoharaṇīyaṃ, eso āhāro nāma.

‘Food’ means anything ingestible, except water for tooth-cleaning. This is called ‘food’.

Aññatra udakadantaponāti ṭhapetvā udakadantaponaṃ.

‘Except for water for tooth-cleaning’ means excluding water for tooth-cleaning.

‘‘Khādissāmi bhuñjissāmī’’ti gaṇhāti, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Ajjhohāre ajjhohāre āpatti pācittiyassa.

If one takes it with the thought, ‘I will chew and swallow,’ there is an offense of wrong doing. For each act of swallowing, there is an offense entailing confession.

267. Appaṭiggahitake appaṭiggahitakasaññī adinnaṃ mukhadvāraṃ āhāraṃ āhāreti, aññatra udakadantaponā, āpatti pācittiyassa. Appaṭiggahitake vematiko adinnaṃ mukhadvāraṃ āhāraṃ āhāreti, aññatra udakadantaponā, āpatti pācittiyassa. Appaṭiggahitake paṭiggahitakasaññī adinnaṃ mukhadvāraṃ āhāraṃ āhāreti, aññatra udakadantaponā, āpatti pācittiyassa.

267.If, perceiving something unreceived as unreceived, one consumes food not given through the mouth-door, except for water for tooth-cleaning, there is an offense entailing confession. If, being doubtful about something unreceived, one consumes food not given through the mouth-door, except for water for tooth-cleaning, there is an offense entailing confession. If, perceiving something unreceived as received, one consumes food not given through the mouth-door, except for water for tooth-cleaning, there is an offense entailing confession.

Paṭiggahitake appaṭiggahitakasaññī, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Paṭiggahitake vematiko, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Paṭiggahitake paṭiggahitakasaññī, anāpatti.

If one perceives what has been received as unreceived, there is an offense of wrong doing. If one is doubtful about what has been received, there is an offense of wrong doing. If one perceives what has been received as received, there is no offense.

268. Anāpatti udakadantapone, cattāri mahāvikatāni sati paccaye asati kappiyakārake sāmaṃ gahetvā paribhuñjati, ummattakassa, ādikammikassāti.

268.There is no offense regarding water for tooth-cleaning; regarding the four great corrupting foods when there is a reason and no one to make them allowable, if one takes them oneself and uses them; for one who is insane; or for the first offender.

Dantaponasikkhāpadaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ dasamaṃ.

The Tooth-cleaning Training Rule, the tenth, is concluded.
