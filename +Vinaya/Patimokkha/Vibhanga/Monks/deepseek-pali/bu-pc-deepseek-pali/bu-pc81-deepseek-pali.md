## 11.The Training Rule Concerning Weakness

484. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā rājagahe viharati veḷuvane kalandakanivāpe. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā dabbo mallaputto saṅghassa senāsanañca paññapeti bhattāni ca uddisati. So cāyasmā dubbalacīvaro hoti. Tena kho pana samayena saṅghassa ekaṃ cīvaraṃ uppannaṃ hoti. Atha kho saṅgho taṃ cīvaraṃ āyasmato dabbassa mallaputtassa adāsi. Chabbaggiyā bhikkhū ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘yathāsanthutaṃ bhikkhū saṅghikaṃ lābhaṃ pariṇāmentī’’ti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma chabbaggiyā bhikkhū samaggena saṅghena cīvaraṃ datvā pacchā khīyanadhammaṃ āpajjissantī’’ti…pe… saccaṃ kira tumhe, bhikkhave, samaggena saṅghena cīvaraṃ datvā pacchā khīyanadhammaṃ āpajjathāti? ‘‘Saccaṃ, bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… kathañhi nāma tumhe, moghapurisā, samaggena saṅghena cīvaraṃ datvā pacchā khīyanadhammaṃ āpajjissatha! Netaṃ, moghapurisā, appasannānaṃ, vā pasādāya…pe… evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

484.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. At that time, the venerable Dabba the Mallian was arranging lodgings and distributing meals for the Saṅgha. That venerable one had worn-out robes. At that time, a robe had accrued to the Saṅgha. Then the Saṅgha gave that robe to the venerable Dabba the Mallian. The Group of Six monks complained, grumbled, and protested, “The monks are diverting the Saṅgha’s gains according to their intimacy!” Those monks who were modest… complained, grumbled, and protested, “How could the Group of Six monks, after a robe was given by the united Saṅgha, later become displeased?”… “Is it true, monks, that after a robe was given by the united Saṅgha, you later became displeased?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One rebuked them… “How could you, foolish men, after a robe was given by the united Saṅgha, later become displeased! This will not inspire confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it… And thus, monks, this training rule should be recited:

485. ‘‘Yo pana bhikkhu samaggena saṅghena cīvaraṃ datvā pacchā khīyanadhammaṃ āpajjeyya ‘yathāsanthutaṃ bhikkhū saṅghikaṃ lābhaṃ pariṇāmentī’ti, pācittiya’’nti.

485.“If a monk, having given a robe by the united Saṅgha, should afterwards become displeased, saying: ‘The monks divert the Saṅgha’s gains according to their intimacy,’ it is a Pācittiya.”

486. Yo panāti yo yādiso…pe… bhikkhūti…pe… ayaṃ imasmiṃ atthe adhippeto bhikkhūti.

486.“Any monk who” (yo pana) means any monk of whatever kind… “monk” (bhikkhu) means… in this context, “monk” is the monk intended here.

Samaggo nāma saṅgho samānasaṃvāsako samānasīmāyaṃ ṭhito.

A united Saṅgha is one living in concord, staying within the same boundary.

Cīvaraṃ nāma channaṃ cīvarānaṃ aññataraṃ cīvaraṃ vikappanupagaṃ pacchimaṃ.

‘A robe’ means any one of the six kinds of robes, the last of which is subject to determination.

Datvāti sayaṃ datvā.

“Having given” means having given personally.

Yathāsanthutaṃ nāma yathāmittatā yathāsandiṭṭhatā yathāsambhattatā yathāsamānupajjhāyakatā yathāsamānācariyakatā.

“According to intimacy” means according to friendship, according to familiarity, according to close association, according to having the same preceptor, according to having the same teacher.

Saṅghikaṃ nāma saṅghassa dinnaṃ hoti pariccattaṃ.

“Belonging to the Saṅgha” means it has been given to the Saṅgha, relinquished or dedicated to it.

Lābho nāma cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhārā, antamaso cuṇṇapiṇḍopi, dantakaṭṭhampi, dasikasuttampi.

“Gains” means robes, almsfood, lodgings, medicinal requisites for the sick; even as much as a lump of powder, a tooth cleaner, or a piece of string.

Pacchā khīyanadhammaṃ āpajjeyyāti upasampannassa saṅghena sammatassa senāsanapaññāpakassa vā bhattuddesakassa vā yāgubhājakassa vā phalabhājakassa vā khajjabhājakassa vā appamattakavissajjakassa vā cīvaraṃ dinne khiyyati, āpatti pācittiyassa.

“Should afterwards become displeased” means if, after a robe has been given to a fully ordained monk who has been approved by the Saṅgha as an arranger of lodgings, a distributor of food, a distributor of rice-gruel, a distributor of fruit, a distributor of cakes, or a distributor of small items, he becomes displeased, there is an offense entailing confession.

487. Dhammakamme dhammakammasaññī cīvaraṃ dinne khiyyati, āpatti pācittiyassa. Dhammakamme vematiko cīvaraṃ dinne khiyyati, āpatti pācittiyassa. Dhammakamme adhammakammasaññī cīvaraṃ dinne khiyyati, āpatti pācittiyassa.

487.If it is a legitimate transaction, and he perceives it as such, and he becomes displeased after giving the robe, he commits an offense entailing confession. If it is a legitimate transaction, but he is unsure, and he becomes displeased after giving the robe, he commits an offense entailing confession. If it is a legitimate transaction, but he perceives it as illegitimate, and he becomes displeased after giving the robe, he commits an offense entailing confession.

Aññaṃ parikkhāraṃ dinne khiyyati, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Upasampannassa saṅghena asammatassa senāsanapaññāpakassa vā bhattuddesakassa vā yāgubhājakassa vā phalabhājakassa vā khajjabhājakassa vā appamattakavissajjakassa vā cīvaraṃ vā aññaṃ vā parikkhāraṃ dinne khiyyati, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anupasampannassa saṅghena sammatassa vā asammatassa vā senāsanapaññāpakassa vā bhattuddesakassa vā yāgubhājakassa vā phalabhājakassa vā khajjabhājakassa vā appamattakavissajjakassa vā cīvaraṃ vā aññaṃ vā parikkhāraṃ dinne khiyyati, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Adhammakamme dhammakammasaññī, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Adhammakamme vematiko, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Adhammakamme adhammakammasaññī, anāpatti.

If another requisite is given, and he becomes displeased, there is an offense of wrong-doing. If a robe or another requisite is given to an ordained monk, not approved by the Saṅgha, who is a lodging arranger, or a meal distributor, or a rice-gruel distributor, or a fruit distributor, or a snack distributor, or a minor requisite distributor—and he becomes displeased—there is an offense of wrong-doing. If a robe or another requisite is given to one unordained, whether approved or not approved by the Saṅgha, who is a lodging arranger, or a meal distributor, or a rice-gruel distributor, or a fruit distributor, or a snack distributor, or a minor requisite distributor—and he becomes displeased—there is an offense of wrong-doing. Regarding an unlawful act, perceiving it as a lawful act, there is an offense of wrong-doing. Regarding an unlawful act, being doubtful, there is an offense of wrong-doing. Regarding an unlawful act, perceiving it as an unlawful act, there is no offense.

488. Anāpatti – pakatiyā chandā dosā mohā bhayā karontaṃ ‘‘kvattho tassa dinnena laddhāpi vinipātessati na sammā upanessatī’’ti khiyyati, ummattakassa, ādikammikassāti.

488.No offense: for one who acts through natural inclination, hatred, delusion, or fear; for one who becomes displeased (thinking), “What is the use of giving to him? Even if he receives something, he will ruin it and not apply it properly”; for one who is insane; for the first offender.

Dubbalasikkhāpadaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ ekādasamaṃ.

The eleventh training rule, concerning weakness, is concluded.
