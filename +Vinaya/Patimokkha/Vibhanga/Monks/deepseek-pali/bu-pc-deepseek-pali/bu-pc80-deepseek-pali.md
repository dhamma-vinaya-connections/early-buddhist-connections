## 10.The Training Rule on Going Without Giving Consent.

479. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena saṅgho sannipatito hoti kenacideva karaṇīyena. Chabbaggiyā bhikkhū cīvarakammaṃ karontā ekassa chandaṃ adaṃsu. Atha kho saṅgho ‘‘yassatthāya sannipatito taṃ kammaṃ karissāmī’’ti ñattiṃ ṭhapesi. Atha kho so bhikkhu – ‘‘evamevime ekamekassa kammaṃ karonti, kassa tumhe kammaṃ karissathā’’ti chandaṃ adatvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkāmi. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma bhikkhu saṅghe vinicchayakathāya vattamānāya chandaṃ adatvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkamissatī’’ti…pe… saccaṃ kira tvaṃ, bhikkhu, saṅghe vinicchayakathāya vattamānāya chandaṃ adatvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkamasīti? ‘‘Saccaṃ, bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… kathañhi nāma tvaṃ, moghapurisa, saṅghe vinicchayakathāya vattamānāya chandaṃ adatvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkamissasi! Netaṃ, moghapurisa, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

479.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time, the Sangha had gathered for some business. The bhikkhus from the group of six, while engaged in robe-making, gave their consent to one of them. Then the Sangha, intending to carry out the business for which they had gathered, established a motion. Then that bhikkhu—thinking, “They are doing the work for each one individually; for whom will you do the work?”—without giving his consent, got up from his seat and left. Those bhikkhus who were of few desires… complained, grumbled, and criticized him: “How could a bhikkhu, while a discussion on a judgment was being conducted in the Sangha, get up from his seat and leave without giving his consent?”… “Is it true, bhikkhu, that you got up from your seat and left without giving your consent while a discussion on a judgment was being conducted in the Sangha?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One rebuked him: “…Foolish man, how could you get up from your seat and leave without giving your consent while a discussion on a judgment was being conducted in the Sangha? This is not for the confidence of those who are not yet confident, nor for the increase of confidence in those who are confident… Therefore, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:

480. ‘‘Yo pana bhikkhu saṅghe vinicchayakathāya vattamānāya chandaṃ adatvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkameyya, pācittiya’’nti.

480.“If a bhikkhu, while a discussion on a judgment is being conducted in the Sangha, leaves without giving his consent, he commits an offense entailing confession.”

481. Yo panāti yo yādiso…pe… bhikkhūti…pe… ayaṃ imasmiṃ atthe adhippeto bhikkhūti.

481.‘Yo pana’ means: whoever, of whatever sort… ‘bhikkhu’ means… in this context, the bhikkhu intended is this one.

Saṅghe vinicchayakathā nāma vatthu vā ārocitaṃ hoti avinicchitaṃ, ñatti vā ṭhapitā hoti, kammavācā vā vippakatā hoti.

‘A discussion on a judgment’ means: a matter has been announced but is undecided, or a motion has been introduced, or a formal act has been started but not completed.

Chandaṃ adatvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkameyyāti – ‘‘kathaṃ idaṃ kammaṃ kuppaṃ assa vaggaṃ assa na kareyyā’’ti gacchati, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Parisāya hatthapāsaṃ vijahantassa āpatti dukkaṭassa. Vijahite āpatti pācittiyassa.

‘Without giving his consent, gets up from his seat and leaves’: if he leaves thinking, “How can this act be ruined, be a factional act, or not be done?” there is a dukkaṭa offense. For one abandoning the assembly’s reach, there is a dukkaṭa offense. When he has abandoned it, there is an offense entailing confession.

482. Dhammakamme dhammakammasaññī chandaṃ adatvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkamati, āpatti pācittiyassa. Dhammakamme vematiko chandaṃ adatvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkamati, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Dhammakamme adhammakammasaññī chandaṃ adatvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkamati, anāpatti. Adhammakamme dhammakammasaññī, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Adhammakamme vematiko, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Adhammakamme adhammakammasaññī, anāpatti.

482.In a legitimate act, perceiving it as legitimate, if one gets up from his seat and leaves without giving consent, there is an offense entailing confession. In a legitimate act, being uncertain, if one gets up from his seat and leaves without giving consent, there is a dukkaṭa offense. In a legitimate act, perceiving it as illegitimate, if one gets up from his seat and leaves without giving consent, there is no offense. In an illegitimate act, perceiving it as legitimate, there is a dukkaṭa offense. In an illegitimate act, being uncertain, there is a dukkaṭa offense. In an illegitimate act, perceiving it as illegitimate, there is no offense.

483. Anāpatti – ‘‘saṅghassa bhaṇḍanaṃ vā kalaho vā viggaho vā vivādo vā bhavissatī’’ti gacchati, ‘‘saṅghabhedo vā saṅgharāji vā bhavissatī’’ti gacchati, ‘‘adhammena vā vaggena vā na kammārahassa vā kammaṃ karissatī’’ti gacchati, gilāno gacchati, gilānassa karaṇīyena gacchati, uccārena vā passāvena vā pīḷito gacchati, ‘‘na kammaṃ kopetukāmo puna paccāgamissāmī’’ti gacchati, ummattakassa, ādikammikassāti.

483.No offense: if one goes thinking, “Contention, quarrel, dispute, or argument will arise in the Sangha”; if one goes thinking, “A schism or a split in the Sangha will arise”; if one goes thinking, “An unlawful act or a factional act or an act by those unfit for the act will be performed”; if one goes being sick; if one goes for the sake of a sick person; if one goes oppressed by urine or feces; if one goes thinking, “Not wishing to spoil the act, I will return”; for one who is insane; for the first offender.

Chandaṃ adatvā gamanasikkhāpadaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ dasamaṃ.

The Tenth Training Rule on Going Without Giving Consent is finished.
