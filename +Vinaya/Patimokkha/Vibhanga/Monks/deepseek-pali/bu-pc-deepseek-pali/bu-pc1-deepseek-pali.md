## 1. Musāvādasikkhāpadaṃ

## 1. The training rule regarding false speech.

Ime kho panāyasmanto dvenavuti pācittiyā

Venerables, these are the ninety-two offenses entailing confession.

Dhammā uddesaṃ āgacchanti.

The training rules are to be recited.

1. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena hatthako sakyaputto vādakkhitto hoti. So titthiyehi saddhiṃ sallapanto avajānitvā paṭijānāti, paṭijānitvā avajānāti, aññenaññaṃ paṭicarati, sampajānamusā bhāsati, saṅketaṃ katvā visaṃvādeti. Titthiyā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma hatthako sakyaputto amhehi saddhiṃ sallapanto avajānitvā paṭijānissati, paṭijānitvā avajānissati, aññenaññaṃ paṭicarissati, sampajānamusā bhāsissati, saṅketaṃ katvā visaṃvādessatī’’ti!

1. At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. Now at that time Hatthaka the Sakyan was engaged in debate. While conversing with the sectarians, he would deny something and then admit it, and admit something and then deny it; he would speak contradictorily; he would knowingly speak falsehoods; and he would make agreements only to deceive. The sectarians complained, criticized, and protested: "How can Hatthaka the Sakyan, while conversing with us, deny something and then admit it, and admit something and then deny it; speak contradictorily; knowingly speak falsehoods; and make agreements only to deceive?"

Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū tesaṃ titthiyānaṃ ujjhāyantānaṃ khiyyantānaṃ vipācentānaṃ. Atha kho te bhikkhū yena hatthako sakyaputto tenupasaṅkamiṃsu; upasaṅkamitvā hatthakaṃ sakyaputtaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘saccaṃ kira tvaṃ, āvuso hatthaka, titthiyehi saddhiṃ sallapanto avajānitvā paṭijānāsi, paṭijānitvā avajānāsi, aññenaññaṃ paṭicarasi, sampajānamusā bhāsasi, saṅketaṃ katvā visaṃvādesī’’ti? ‘‘Ete kho, āvuso, titthiyā nāma yena kenaci jetabbā; neva tesaṃ jayo dātabbo’’ti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma hatthako sakyaputto titthiyehi saddhiṃ sallapanto avajānitvā paṭijānissati, paṭijānitvā avajānissati, aññenaññaṃ paṭicarissati, sampajānamusā bhāsissati, saṅketaṃ katvā visaṃvādessatī’’ti!

The monks heard those sectarians complaining, criticizing, and protesting. Then those monks approached Hatthaka the Sakyan; having approached, they said to Hatthaka the Sakyan: “Is it true, friend Hatthaka, that while conversing with the sectarians, you deny something and then admit it, and admit something and then deny it; you speak contradictorily; you knowingly speak falsehoods; and you make agreements only to deceive?” “These sectarians, friends, must be defeated by any means; no victory should be conceded to them.” Those monks who were modest… complained, criticized, and protested: “How could Hatthaka the Sakyan, while conversing with the sectarians, deny something and then admit it, and admit something and then deny it; speak contradictorily; knowingly speak falsehoods; and make agreements only to deceive?”

Atha kho te bhikkhū hatthakaṃ sakyaputtaṃ anekapariyāyena vigarahitvā bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā hatthakaṃ sakyaputtaṃ paṭipucchi – ‘‘saccaṃ kira tvaṃ, hatthaka, titthiyehi saddhiṃ sallapanto avajānitvā paṭijānāsi, paṭijānitvā avajānāsi, aññenaññaṃ paṭicarasi, sampajānamusā bhāsasi, saṅketaṃ katvā visaṃvādesī’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ, bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… kathañhi nāma tvaṃ, moghapurisa, titthiyehi saddhiṃ sallapanto avajānitvā paṭijānissasi, paṭijānitvā avajānissasi, aññenaññaṃ paṭicarissasi, sampajānamusā bhāsissasi, saṅketaṃ katvā visaṃvādessasi! Netaṃ, moghapurisa, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

Then those monks reproved Hatthaka the Sakyan in many ways and reported the matter to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, regarding this incident and occasion, convened the Sangha of monks, questioned Hatthaka the Sakyan: "Is it true, Hatthaka, that while conversing with the sectarians, you deny something and then admit it, and admit something and then deny it; you speak contradictorily; you knowingly speak falsehoods; and you make agreements only to deceive?" "It is true, Blessed One." The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked him... "How could you, foolish man, while conversing with the sectarians, deny something and then admit it, and admit something and then deny it; speak contradictorily; knowingly speak falsehoods; and make agreements only to deceive! This is not, foolish man, for inspiring confidence in those without it... And thus, monks, this training rule should be recited:"

2. ‘‘Sampajānamusāvāde pācittiya’’nti.

2. To intentionally lie is a pācittiya offense.

3. Sampajānamusāvādo nāma visaṃvādanapurekkhārassa vācā, girā, byappatho, vacībhedo, vācasikā viññatti, aṭṭha anariyavohārā – adiṭṭhaṃ diṭṭhaṃ meti, assutaṃ sutaṃ meti, amutaṃ mutaṃ meti, aviññātaṃ viññātaṃ meti, diṭṭhaṃ adiṭṭhaṃ meti, sutaṃ assutaṃ meti, mutaṃ amutaṃ meti, viññātaṃ aviññātaṃ meti.

3. Intentional false speech is defined as speech with the intention to deceive, words, utterance, expression, verbal differentiation, and verbal intimation, as well as these eight ignoble modes of expression—saying 'I saw' when one did not see, 'I heard' when one did not hear, 'I sensed' when one did not sense, 'I knew' when one did not know; saying 'I did not see' when one did see, 'I did not hear' when one did hear, 'I did not sense' when one did sense, and 'I did not know' when one did know.

Adiṭṭhaṃ nāma na cakkhunā diṭṭhaṃ. Assutaṃ nāma na sotena sutaṃ. Amutaṃ nāma na ghānena ghāyitaṃ, na jivhāya sāyitaṃ, na kāyena phuṭṭhaṃ. Aviññātaṃ nāma na manasā viññātaṃ. Diṭṭhaṃ nāma cakkhunā diṭṭhaṃ. Sutaṃ nāma sotena sutaṃ. Mutaṃ nāma ghānena ghāyitaṃ, jivhāya sāyitaṃ, kāyena phuṭṭhaṃ. Viññātaṃ nāma manasā viññātaṃ.

"Unseen" means not seen with the eye. "Unheard" means not heard with the ear. "Unsensed" means not smelled with the nose, not tasted with the tongue, not touched with the body. "Uncognized" means not cognized with the mind. "Seen" means seen with the eye. "Heard" means heard with the ear. "Sensed" means smelled with the nose, tasted with the tongue, touched with the body. "Cognized" means cognized with the mind.

10. Through four modes...pe... through five modes...pe... through six modes...pe... through seven modes...pe... is forgetful of what was cognized, saying, "I have cognized, seen, heard, and sensed"—intentionally speaking falsely, there is an offense entailing confession. Before speaking, there is the thought, "I will speak falsely"; while speaking, there is the thought, "I am speaking falsely"; after speaking, there is the thought, "I have spoken falsely"—having rejected view, rejected acceptance, rejected inclination, rejected the truth.

11. Anāpatti davā bhaṇati, ravā bhaṇati [davāya bhaṇati, ravāya bhaṇati (syā.)]. ‘‘Davā bhaṇati nāma sahasā bhaṇati. Ravā bhaṇati nāma ‘aññaṃ bhaṇissāmī’ti aññaṃ bhaṇati’’. Ummattakassa, ādikammikassāti.

11. There is no offense for one who speaks impulsively, for one who speaks mistakenly. "Speaking impulsively means speaking hastily. Speaking mistakenly means intending to say one thing but saying another." For one who is insane, for one who is a first offender.

Musāvādasikkhāpadaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ paṭhamaṃ.

The first training rule on false speech is concluded.
