## 3. Ukkoṭanasikkhāpadaṃ

## 3.The training rule on re-agitation.

392. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū jānaṃ yathādhammaṃ nihatādhikaraṇaṃ punakammāya ukkoṭenti – ‘‘akataṃ kammaṃ dukkaṭaṃ kammaṃ puna kātabbaṃ kammaṃ anihataṃ dunnihataṃ puna nihanitabba’’nti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma chabbaggiyā bhikkhū jānaṃ yathādhammaṃ nihatādhikaraṇaṃ punakammāya ukkoṭessantī’’ti …pe… saccaṃ kira tumhe, bhikkhave, jānaṃ yathādhammaṃ nihatādhikaraṇaṃ punakammāya ukkoṭethā’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ, bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… kathañhi nāma tumhe, moghapurisā, jānaṃ yathādhammaṃ nihatādhikaraṇaṃ punakammāya ukkoṭessatha! Netaṃ, moghapurisā, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

392.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park, Jeta’s Grove. Now at that time the group-of-six monks, knowing that a legal issue had been settled according to the Dhamma, re-agitated it for re-action, saying, “The action was not done, the action was badly done, the action must be done again, the issue was not settled, it was badly settled, it must be settled again.” Those monks who were modest… complained, grumbled, and criticized: “How can the group-of-six monks, knowing that a legal issue had been settled according to the Dhamma, re-agitate it for re-action?”… “Is it true, monks, that you, knowing that a legal issue had been settled according to the Dhamma, re-agitated it for re-action?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One rebuked them… “How can you, worthless men, knowing that a legal issue had been settled according to the Dhamma, re-agitate it for re-action? This does not inspire confidence in the unconfident… And thus, monks, this training rule is to be recited:

393. ‘‘Yo pana bhikkhu jānaṃ yathādhammaṃ nihatādhikaraṇaṃ punakammāya ukkoṭeyya, pācittiya’’nti.

393.“If any bhikkhu, knowing that a legal issue has been settled according to the Dhamma, should re-agitate it for re-action, it is a pācittiya offense.”

394. Yo panāti yo yādiso…pe… bhikkhūti…pe… ayaṃ imasmiṃ atthe adhippeto bhikkhūti.

394.“Any” means any such person as… “Bhikkhu” means… the bhikkhu intended in this case.

Jānāti nāma sāmaṃ vā jānāti, aññe vā tassa ārocenti, so vā āroceti.

“Knowing” means he knows himself, or others inform him, or he informs others.

Yathādhammaṃ nāma dhammena vinayena satthusāsanena kataṃ, etaṃ yathādhammaṃ nāma.

“According to the Dhamma” means done in accordance with the Dhamma, the Discipline, and the Teacher’s Dispensation. This is what is called “according to the Dhamma.”

Adhikaraṇaṃ nāma cattāri adhikaraṇāni – vivādādhikaraṇaṃ, anuvādādhikaraṇaṃ, āpattādhikaraṇaṃ, kiccādhikaraṇaṃ.

“Legal issue” means four legal issues: disputes, accusations, offenses, and duties.

Punakammāya ukkoṭeyyāti ‘‘akataṃ kammaṃ dukkaṭaṃ kammaṃ punakātabbaṃ kammaṃ anihataṃ dunnihataṃ puna nihanitabbaṃ’’ti ukkoṭeti, āpatti pācittiyassa.

“Re-agitate for re-action” means he re-agitates, saying, “The action was not done, the action was badly done, the action must be done again, the issue was not settled, it was badly settled, it must be settled again.” It is a pācittiya offense.

395. Dhammakamme dhammakammasaññī ukkoṭeti, āpatti pācittiyassa. Dhammakamme vematiko ukkoṭeti, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Dhammakamme adhammakammasaññī ukkoṭeti, anāpatti. Adhammakamme dhammakammasaññī, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Adhammakamme vematiko, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Adhammakamme adhammakammasaññī, anāpatti.

395.If, regarding a proper action, he perceives it as a proper action and re-agitates, it is a pācittiya offense. If, regarding a proper action, he is doubtful and re-agitates, it is a dukkaṭa offense. If, regarding a proper action, he perceives it as an improper action and re-agitates, there is no offense. If, regarding an improper action, he perceives it as a proper action, it is a dukkaṭa offense. If, regarding an improper action, he is doubtful, it is a dukkaṭa offense. If, regarding an improper action, he perceives it as an improper action, there is no offense.

396. Anāpatti ‘‘adhammena vā vaggena vā na kammārahassa vā kammaṃ kata’’nti jānanto ukkoṭeti, ummattakassa, ādikammikassāti.

396.There is no offense if he re-agitates, knowing, “The action was done improperly, or by a faction, or for one who is unworthy of the action”; for one who is insane; for the first offender.

Ukkoṭanasikkhāpadaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ tatiyaṃ.

The third training rule on re-agitation is concluded.
