## 5. Talasattikasikkhāpadaṃ

## 5.The training rule on striking with the flat of the hand.

454. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū kupitā anattamanā sattarasavaggiyānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ talasattikaṃ uggiranti. Te pahārasamuccitā rodanti. Bhikkhū evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘kissa tumhe, āvuso, rodathā’’ti? ‘‘Ime, āvuso, chabbaggiyā bhikkhū kupitā anattamanā amhākaṃ talasattikaṃ uggirantī’’ti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma chabbaggiyā bhikkhū kupitā anattamanā sattarasavaggiyānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ talasattikaṃ uggirissantī’’ti…pe… saccaṃ kira tumhe, bhikkhave, kupitā anattamanā sattarasavaggiyānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ talasattikaṃ uggirathāti? ‘‘Saccaṃ, bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… kathañhi nāma tumhe, moghapurisā, kupitā anattamanā sattarasavaggiyānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ talasattikaṃ uggirissatha! Netaṃ, moghapurisā, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

454.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta Grove, Anathapindika's Monastery. At that time, the group-of-six monks, angry and displeased, raised their hand to strike the group-of-seventeen monks. Struck repeatedly, they wept. The monks asked them, “Friends, why are you weeping?” “These group-of-six monks, angry and displeased, raised their hand to strike us.” Those monks of few desires… complained and criticized, “How can the group-of-six monks, angry and displeased, raise their hand to strike the group-of-seventeen monks?”… “Is it true, monks, that you, angry and displeased, raised your hand to strike the group-of-seventeen monks?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One rebuked them… “How can you, foolish men, being angry and displeased, raise your hand to strike the group-of-seventeen monks! This will not lead to confidence in the unconvinced… And so, monks, this training rule should be recited:

455. ‘‘Yo pana bhikkhu bhikkhussa kupito anattamano talasattikaṃ uggireyya, pācittiya’’nti.

455.“Whatever monk, being angry and displeased, raises his hand to strike another monk, he commits a pācittiya offense.”

456. Yo panāti yo yādiso…pe… bhikkhūti…pe… ayaṃ imasmiṃ atthe adhippeto bhikkhūti.

456.“Now, whoever” means: whoever of such a description… “monk” means… In this context, this is the monk intended.

Bhikkhussāti aññassa bhikkhussa.

“A monk” means another monk.

Kupito anattamanoti anabhiraddho āhatacitto khilajāto.

“Angry and displeased” means dissatisfied, unhappy, with a mind struck by aversion, obstructed.

Talasattikaṃ uggireyyāti kāyaṃ vā kāyapaṭibaddhaṃ vā antamaso uppalapattampi uccāreti, āpatti pācittiyassa.

“Raises his hand to strike” means he raises his body or anything connected with his body, even a lotus petal, he commits a pācittiya offense.

457. Upasampanne upasampannasaññī kupito anattamano talasattikaṃ uggirati, āpatti pācittiyassa. Upasampanne vematiko kupito anattamano talasattikaṃ uggirati, āpatti pācittiyassa. Upasampanne anupasampannasaññī kupito anattamano talasattikaṃ uggirati, āpatti pācittiyassa.

457.If, perceiving him as fully ordained, he raises his hand to strike out of anger and displeasure, he commits a pācittiya offense. If, being in doubt about him, he raises his hand to strike out of anger and displeasure, he commits a pācittiya offense. If, perceiving him as not fully ordained, he raises his hand to strike out of anger and displeasure, he commits a pācittiya offense.

Anupasampannassa kupito anattamano talasattikaṃ uggirati, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anupasampanne upasampannasaññī, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anupasampanne vematiko, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anupasampanne anupasampannasaññī, āpatti dukkaṭassa.

If, being angry and displeased, he raises his hand to strike one who is not fully ordained, there is an offense of wrong-doing. If, perceiving one who is not fully ordained as fully ordained, he raises his hand to strike him, there is an offense of wrong-doing. If, being in doubt about one who is not fully ordained, he raises his hand to strike him, there is an offense of wrong-doing. If, perceiving one who is not fully ordained as not fully ordained, he raises his hand to strike him, there is an offense of wrong-doing.

458. Anāpatti kenaci viheṭhīyamāno mokkhādhippāyo talasattikaṃ uggirati, ummattakassa, ādikammikassāti.

458.There is no offense if, being harassed by someone, he raises his hand to strike with the intention of escaping; for one who is insane; for the first offender.

Talasattikasikkhāpadaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ pañcamaṃ.

The fifth training rule on striking with the flat of the hand is concluded.
