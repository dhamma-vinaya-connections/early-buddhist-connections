## 9.The Training Rule on Associating with One Who Has Been Suspended

423. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū jānaṃ tathāvādinā ariṭṭhena bhikkhunā [bhikkhunā gaddhabādhipubbena (?)] akaṭānudhammena taṃ diṭṭhiṃ appaṭinissaṭṭhena saddhiṃ sambhuñjantipi saṃvasantipi sahāpi seyyaṃ kappenti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – kathañhi nāma chabbaggiyā bhikkhū jānaṃ tathāvādinā ariṭṭhena bhikkhunā [bhikkhunā gaddhabādhipubbena (?)] akaṭānudhammena taṃ diṭṭhiṃ appaṭinissaṭṭhena saddhiṃ sambhuñjissantipi saṃvasissantipi sahāpi seyyaṃ kappessantīti…pe… saccaṃ kira tumhe, bhikkhave, jānaṃ tathāvādinā ariṭṭhena bhikkhunā [bhikkhunā gaddhabādhipubbena (?)] akaṭānudhammena taṃ diṭṭhiṃ appaṭinissaṭṭhena saddhiṃ sambhuñjathāpi saṃvasathāpi sahāpi seyyaṃ kappethāti? ‘‘Saccaṃ, bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… kathañhi nāma tumhe, moghapurisā, jānaṃ tathāvādinā ariṭṭhena bhikkhunā [bhikkhunā gaddhabādhipubbane (?)] akaṭānudhammena taṃ diṭṭhiṃ appaṭinissaṭṭhena saddhiṃ sambhuñjissathāpi saṃvasissathāpi sahāpi seyyaṃ kappessatha! Netaṃ, moghapurisā, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

423.At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the group-of-six monks were eating together, living together, and sharing a bed with the monk Ariṭṭha, knowing that he was speaking thus, that he had not been dealt with according to the Dhamma, and that he had not relinquished that view. Those monks of few desires… complained, grumbled, and criticized them: ‘How can the group-of-six monks, knowing that the monk Ariṭṭha was speaking thus, that he had not been dealt with according to the Dhamma, and that he had not relinquished that view, eat together, live together, and share a bed with him?’… ‘Is it true, monks, that you, knowing that the monk Ariṭṭha was speaking thus, that he had not been dealt with according to the Dhamma, and that he had not relinquished that view, eat together, live together, and share a bed with him?’ ‘It is true, Blessed One.’ The Blessed One rebuked them… ‘How can you, foolish men, knowing that the monk Ariṭṭha was speaking thus, that he had not been dealt with according to the Dhamma, and that he had not relinquished that view, eat together, live together, and share a bed with him! This, foolish men, is not for the confidence of those who are not confident… And thus, monks, you should recite this training rule:

424. ‘‘Yo pana bhikkhu jānaṃ tathāvādinā bhikkhunā akaṭānudhammena taṃ diṭṭhiṃ appaṭinissaṭṭhena saddhiṃ sambhuñjeyya vā saṃvaseyya vā saha vā seyyaṃ kappeyya, pācittiya’’nti.

424.“If a monk knowingly eats together, lives together, or shares a bed with a monk who speaks thus, who has not been dealt with according to the Dhamma, and who has not relinquished that view, he incurs an offense of expiation.”

425. Yo panāti yo yādiso…pe… bhikkhūti…pe… ayaṃ imasmiṃ atthe adhippeto bhikkhūti.

425.“If any”: whoever, of whatever sort… “monk”:… this monk is intended in this context.

Jānāti nāma sāmaṃ vā jānāti, aññe vā tassa ārocenti, so vā āroceti.

‘Knowingly’ means he knows himself, or others inform him, or he informs others.

Tathāvādināti – ‘‘tathāhaṃ bhagavatā dhammaṃ desitaṃ ājānāmi, yathā yeme antarāyikā dhammā vuttā bhagavatā, te paṭisevato nālaṃ antarāyāyā’’ti evaṃ vādinā.

‘Who speaks thus’ means: ‘As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things declared by the Blessed One to be obstructive are not capable of obstructing one who engages in them’—one who speaks thus.

Akaṭānudhammo nāma ukkhitto anosārito.

‘One who has not been dealt with according to the Dhamma’ means he is suspended and not reinstated.

Taṃ diṭṭhiṃ appaṭinissaṭṭhena saddhinti etaṃ diṭṭhiṃ appaṭinissaṭṭhena saddhiṃ.

‘Together with one who has not relinquished that view’ means together with one who has not relinquished that view.

Sambhuñjeyya vāti sambhogo nāma dve sambhogā – āmisasambhogo ca dhammasambhogo ca. Āmisasambhogo nāma āmisaṃ deti vā paṭiggaṇhāti vā, āpatti pācittiyassa. Dhammasambhogo nāma uddisati vā uddisāpeti vā, padena uddisati vā uddisāpeti vā, pade pade āpatti pācittiyassa. Akkharāya uddisati vā uddisāpeti vā, akkharakkharāya āpatti pācittiyassa.

‘Or eats together’ means ‘eating together,’ which means there are two kinds of eating together: eating together materially and eating together in Dhamma. ‘Eating together materially’ means one gives or receives material things; there is an offense of expiation. ‘Eating together in Dhamma’ means one recites or has someone else recite; one recites a word or has someone else recite a word, for each word there is an offense of expiation; one recites a syllable or has someone else recite a syllable, for each syllable there is an offense of expiation.

Saṃvaseyya vāti ukkhittakena saddhiṃ uposathaṃ vā pavāraṇaṃ vā saṅghakammaṃ vā karoti, āpatti pācittiyassa.

‘Or lives together’ means one performs an Uposatha, or a Pavāraṇā, or a Sangha act with one who has been suspended; there is an offense of expiation.

Saha vā seyyaṃ kappeyyāti ekacchanne ukkhittake nipanne bhikkhu nipajjati, āpatti pācittiyassa. Bhikkhu nipanne ukkhittako nipajjati, āpatti pācittiyassa. Ubho vā nipajjanti, āpatti pācittiyassa. Uṭṭhahitvā punappunaṃ nipajjanti, āpatti pācittiyassa.

‘Or shares a bed’ means: if a suspended monk is lying down under the same roof and a bhikkhu lies down, there is an offense of expiation. If a bhikkhu is lying down and a suspended monk lies down, there is an offense of expiation. If both lie down, there is an offense of expiation. If they get up and lie down again repeatedly, there is an offense of expiation.

426. Ukkhittake ukkhittakasaññī sambhuñjati vā saṃvasati vā saha vā seyyaṃ kappeti, āpatti pācittiyassa. Ukkhittake vematiko sambhuñjati vā saṃvasati vā saha vā seyyaṃ kappeti, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Ukkhittake anukkhittakasaññī sambhuñjati vā saṃvasati vā saha vā seyyaṃ kappeti, anāpatti. Anukkhittake ukkhittakasaññī, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anukkhittake vematiko, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anukkhittake anukkhittakasaññī, anāpatti.

426.If, regarding a suspended monk, one perceives him as suspended and eats together, lives together, or shares a bed with him, there is an offense of expiation. If, regarding a suspended monk, one is doubtful and eats together, lives together, or shares a bed with him, there is an offense of wrong-doing. If, regarding a suspended monk, one perceives him as not suspended and eats together, lives together, or shares a bed with him, there is no offense. If, regarding a non-suspended monk, one perceives him as suspended, there is an offense of wrong-doing. If, regarding a non-suspended monk, one is doubtful, there is an offense of wrong-doing. If, regarding a non-suspended monk, one perceives him as not suspended, there is no offense.

427. Anāpatti anukkhittoti jānāti, ukkhitto osāritoti jānāti, ukkhitto taṃ diṭṭhiṃ paṭinissaṭṭhoti jānāti, ummattakassa, ādikammikassāti.

427.There is no offense if one knows he is not suspended, if one knows he is suspended but has been reinstated, if one knows the suspended monk has relinquished that view; for one who is insane; or for the first offender.

Ukkhittasambhogasikkhāpadaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ navamaṃ.

The ninth training rule on associating with one who has been suspended is finished.
