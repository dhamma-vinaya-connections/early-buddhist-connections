## 3.The Third Pāṭidesanīya Training Rule

562. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena sāvatthiyaṃ aññataraṃ kulaṃ ubhatopasannaṃ hoti. Saddhāya vaḍḍhati, bhogena hāyati, yaṃ tasmiṃ kule uppajjati purebhattaṃ khādanīyaṃ vā bhojanīyaṃ vā taṃ sabbaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ vissajjetvā appekadā anasitā acchanti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma samaṇā sakyaputtiyā na mattaṃ jānitvā paṭiggahessanti! Ime imesaṃ datvā appekadā anasitā acchantī’’ti!! Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū tesaṃ manussānaṃ ujjhāyantānaṃ khiyyantānaṃ vipācentānaṃ. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, yaṃ kulaṃ saddhāya vaḍḍhati, bhogena hāyati evarūpassa kulassa ñattidutiyena kammena sekkhasammutiṃ dātuṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, dātabbā. Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

562.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. Now at that time, a certain family in Sāvatthī was devoted in both ways. Their faith grew, but their wealth declined. Whatever chewable food or edible food arose in that household before noon, they gave it all to the bhikkhus, and sometimes they themselves went without eating. People complained, criticized, and grumbled: “How can these Sakyan ascetics accept without knowing moderation? After giving to them, sometimes these people themselves go without food!” The bhikkhus heard the complaints of those people. Then those bhikkhus reported the matter to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the bhikkhus: “Monks, I allow that when a family grows in faith but declines in wealth, the Saṅgha may grant them the designation as a family in training by means of a motion and one announcement. And it should be done like this: A competent and capable bhikkhu should inform the Saṅgha—

563. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Itthannāmaṃ kulaṃ saddhāya vaḍḍhati, bhogena hāyati. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmassa kulassa sekkhasammutiṃ dadeyya. Esā ñatti.

563.“Venerable Sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. The family of so-and-so prospers in faith but declines in wealth. If it seems fitting to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should grant the designation as a family in training to the family of so-and-so. This is the motion.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Itthannāmaṃ kulaṃ saddhāya vaḍḍhati, bhogena hāyati. Saṅgho itthannāmassa kulassa sekkhasammutiṃ deti. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa kulassa sekkhasammutiyā dānaṃ, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“Venerable Sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. The family of so-and-so grows in faith but declines in wealth. The Saṅgha is granting the designation as a family in training to the family of so-and-so. If it is agreeable to any venerable one that the designation as a family in training be granted to the family of so-and-so, he should remain silent; whoever does not approve should speak.”

‘‘Dinnā saṅghena itthannāmassa kulassa sekkhasammuti. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

“The Saṅgha has granted the designation as a family in training to the family of so-and-so. The Saṅgha approves of it, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.”

Evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

And in this way, monks, this training rule should be recited:

‘‘Yāni kho pana tāni sekkhasammatāni kulāni, yo pana bhikkhu tathārūpesu sekkhasammatesu kulesu khādanīyaṃ vā bhojanīyaṃ vā sahatthā paṭiggahetvā khādeyya vā bhuñjeyya vā, paṭidesetabbaṃ tena bhikkhunā – ‘gārayhaṃ, āvuso, dhammaṃ āpajjiṃ asappāyaṃ pāṭidesanīyaṃ taṃ paṭidesemī’’’ti.

“Now, concerning those families designated as families in training, if a bhikkhu, in such families designated as families in training, should receive chewable food or edible food with his own hand and eat or consume it, that bhikkhu should confess it thus: ‘Friends, I have committed a blameworthy, unsuitable act that requires confession; I confess it.’”

Evañcidaṃ bhagavatā bhikkhūnaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ paññattaṃ hoti.

Thus was this training rule laid down for the bhikkhus by the Blessed One.

564. Tena kho pana samayena sāvatthiyaṃ ussavo hoti. Manussā bhikkhū nimantetvā bhojenti. Tampi kho kulaṃ bhikkhū nimantesi. Bhikkhū kukkuccāyantā nādhivāsenti – ‘‘paṭikkhittaṃ bhagavatā sekkhasammatesu kulesu khādanīyaṃ vā bhojanīyaṃ vā sahatthā paṭiggahetvā khādituṃ bhuñjitu’’nti. Te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kiṃ nu kho nāma amhākaṃ jīvitena yaṃ ayyā amhākaṃ na paṭiggaṇhantī’’ti! Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū tesaṃ manussānaṃ ujjhāyantānaṃ khiyyantānaṃ vipācentānaṃ. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, nimantitena sekkhasammatesu kulesu khādanīyaṃ vā bhojanīyaṃ vā sahatthā paṭiggahetvā khādituṃ bhuñjituṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

564.At that time, there was a festival in Sāvatthī. People invited bhikkhus and offered them food. That family also invited the bhikkhus. The bhikkhus, being scrupulous, did not accept, saying: “The Blessed One has prohibited accepting chewable food or edible food with one’s own hand from families designated as families in training and eating or consuming it.” They complained, grumbled, and protested, saying: “What is the use of our lives if the venerables do not accept from us?” The bhikkhus heard these people complaining, grumbling, and protesting. Then those bhikkhus reported the matter to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, concerning this matter, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the bhikkhus: “Monks, I allow, when invited, accepting chewable food or edible food with one’s own hand from families designated as families in training, and eating or consuming it. And thus, monks, this training rule should be recited—

‘‘Yāni kho pana tāni sekkhasammatāni kulāni, yo pana bhikkhu tathārūpesu sekkhasammatesu kulesu pubbe animantito khādanīyaṃ vā bhojanīyaṃ vā sahatthā paṭiggahetvā khādeyya vā bhuñjeyya vā, paṭidesetabbaṃ tena bhikkhunā – ‘gārayhaṃ, āvuso, dhammaṃ āpajjiṃ asappāyaṃ pāṭidesanīyaṃ, taṃ paṭidesemī’’’ti.

“Now, concerning those families designated as families in training, if a bhikkhu, in such families designated as families in training, without being previously invited, should receive chewable food or edible food with his own hand and eat or consume it, that bhikkhu should confess it thus: ‘Friends, I have committed a blameworthy, unsuitable act that requires confession; I confess it.’”

Evañcidaṃ bhagavatā bhikkhūnaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ paññattaṃ hoti.

Thus was this training rule laid down for the bhikkhus by the Blessed One.

565. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu tassa kulassa kulūpako hoti. Atha kho so bhikkhu pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena taṃ kulaṃ tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi. Tena kho pana samayena so bhikkhu gilāno hoti. Atha kho te manussā taṃ bhikkhuṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘bhuñjatha, bhante’’ti. Atha kho so bhikkhu – ‘‘bhagavatā paṭikkhittaṃ animantitena sekkhasammatesu kulesu khādanīyaṃ vā bhojanīyaṃ vā sahatthā paṭiggahetvā khādituṃ bhuñjitu’’nti kukkuccāyanto na paṭiggahesi; nāsakkhi piṇḍāya carituṃ; chinnabhatto ahosi. Atha kho so bhikkhu ārāmaṃ gantvā bhikkhūnaṃ etamatthaṃ ārocesi. Bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, gilānena bhikkhunā sekkhasammatesu kulesu khādanīyaṃ vā bhojanīyaṃ vā sahatthā paṭiggahetvā khādituṃ bhuñjituṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

565.At that time, a certain bhikkhu was a frequent visitor to that family. Then, in the morning, that bhikkhu dressed, and taking his bowl and robe, went to that family; having approached, he sat down on the seat made ready. Now at that time, that bhikkhu was sick. Then those people said to that bhikkhu, “Please eat, Venerable Sir.” Then that bhikkhu, scrupulous and thinking, “The Blessed One has prohibited eating or consuming chewable food or edible food received with one’s own hand in families designated as families in training when not invited,” did not accept it. He was unable to go for alms and remained without a meal. Then that bhikkhu went to the monastery and informed the bhikkhus about this matter. The bhikkhus informed the Blessed One about this matter. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, concerning this matter, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the bhikkhus: “Monks, I allow a sick bhikkhu to eat or consume chewable food or edible food received with his own hand in families designated as families in training. And thus, monks, this training rule should be recited:

566. ‘‘Yāni kho pana tāni sekkhasammatāni kulāni, yo pana bhikkhu tathārūpesu sekkhasammatesu kulesu pubbe animantito agilāno khādanīyaṃ vā bhojanīyaṃ vā sahatthā paṭiggahetvā khādeyya vā bhuñjeyya vā, paṭidesetabbaṃ tena bhikkhunā – ‘gārayhaṃ, āvuso, dhammaṃ āpajjiṃ asappāyaṃ pāṭidesanīyaṃ, taṃ paṭidesemī’’ti.

566.“Now, concerning those families designated as families in training, if a bhikkhu, in such families designated as families in training, without being previously invited, not being ill, should receive chewable food or edible food with his own hand and eat or consume it, that bhikkhu should confess it thus: ‘Friends, I have committed a blameworthy, unsuitable act that requires confession; I confess it.’”

567. Yāni kho pana tāni sekkhasammatāni kulānīti sekkhasammataṃ nāma kulaṃ yaṃ kulaṃ saddhāya vaḍḍhati, bhogena hāyati. Evarūpassa kulassa ñattidutiyena kammena sekkhasammuti dinnā hoti.

567.Now, those families designated as families in training: A family designated as a family in training is one that grows in faith but declines in wealth. To such a family, the designation as a family in training has been granted by means of a motion and one announcement.

Yo panāti yo yādiso…pe… bhikkhūti…pe… ayaṃ imasmiṃ atthe adhippeto bhikkhūti.

“Whoever” means whoever… (as in the previous cases)… “bhikkhu” means a bhikkhu intended in this sense.

Tathārūpesu sekkhasammatesu kulesūti evarūpesu sekkhasammatesu kulesu.

“In such families designated as families in training” means in such families designated as families in training.

Animantito nāma ajjatanāya vā svātanāya vā animantito, gharūpacāraṃ okkamante nimanteti, eso animantito nāma.

“Uninvited” means not invited for today or for tomorrow. If one is invited while entering the precincts of a house, this is called “uninvited.”

Nimantito nāma ajjatanāya vā svātanāya vā nimantito, gharūpacāraṃ anokkamante nimanteti, eso nimantito nāma.

“Invited” means invited for today or for tomorrow. If one is invited without entering the precincts of a house, this is called “invited.”

Agilāno nāma sakkoti piṇḍāya carituṃ.

“Not being ill” means one is capable of going for alms.

Gilāno nāma na sakkoti piṇḍāya carituṃ.

“Ill” means one is not able to go for alms.

Khādanīyaṃ nāma pañca bhojanāni – yāmakālikaṃ sattāhakālikaṃ yāvajīvikaṃ ṭhapetvā avasesaṃ khādanīyaṃ nāma.

“Chewable food” means, apart from the five staple foods, and apart from what is allowable for a day, for seven days, or for life, the remainder is called “chewable food.”

Bhojanīyaṃ nāma pañca bhojanāni – odano, kummāso, sattu, maccho, maṃsaṃ.

“Edible food” means the five staple foods: cooked rice, dry grain food, meal of roasted grain, fish, and meat.

Animantito agilāno ‘‘khādissāmi bhuñjissāmī’’ti paṭiggaṇhāti, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Ajjhohāre ajjhohāre āpatti pāṭidesanīyassa.

If an uninvited, not ill bhikkhu receives [food], thinking, “I will eat, I will consume,” there is an offense of wrong-doing. For each mouthful swallowed, there is an offense requiring confession.

568. Sekkhasammate sekkhasammatasaññī animantito agilāno khādanīyaṃ vā bhojanīyaṃva sahatthā paṭiggahetvā khādati vā bhuñjati vā, āpatti pāṭidesanīyassa. Sekkhasammate vematiko…pe… sekkhasammate asekkhasammatasaññī animantito agilāno khādanīyaṃ vā bhojanīyaṃ vā sahatthā paṭiggahetvā khādati vā bhuñjati vā, āpatti pāṭidesanīyassa.

568.If, in a family designated as a family in training, one perceives it as a family designated as a family in training, and being uninvited and not ill, receives chewable food or edible food with one’s own hand and eats or consumes it, there is an offense requiring confession. If one is in doubt about a family designated as a family in training… (as in the previous cases)… if, in a family designated as a family in training, one perceives it as not designated as a family in training, and being uninvited and not ill, receives chewable food or edible food with one’s own hand and eats or consumes it, there is an offense requiring confession.

Yāmakālikaṃ sattāhakālikaṃ yāvajīvikaṃ āhāratthāya paṭiggaṇhāti, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Ajjhohāre ajjhohāre āpatti dukkaṭassa. Asekkhasammate sekkhasammatasaññī, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Asekkhasammate vematiko, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Asekkhasammate asekkhasammatasaññī, anāpatti.

If one receives what is allowable for a day, for seven days, or for life, for the purpose of food, there is an offense of wrong-doing. For each mouthful swallowed, there is an offense of wrong-doing. If, in a family not designated as a family in training, one perceives it as a family designated as a family in training, there is an offense of wrong-doing. If one is in doubt about a family not designated as a family in training, there is an offense of wrong-doing. If, in a family not designated as a family in training, one perceives it as not designated as a family in training, there is no offense.

569. Anāpatti nimantitassa, gilānassa, nimantitassa vā gilānassa vā sesakaṃ bhuñjati, aññesaṃ bhikkhā tattha paññattā hoti, gharato nīharitvā denti, niccabhatte, salākabhatte, pakkhike, uposathike, pāṭipadike, yāmakālikaṃ sattāhakālikaṃ yāvajīvikaṃ – ‘‘sati paccaye paribhuñjā’’ti deti, ummattakassa, ādikammikassāti.

569.There is no offense for one who is invited; for one who is ill; for one who eats the leftovers of one invited or ill; where alms are designated for others there; when food is brought out from the house and given; for regular meals; for meals distributed by lot; for fortnightly meals; for Uposatha meals; for the day after the new moon; for food allowable for a watch-period, for seven days, or for a lifetime—if given with the thought, ‘Consume it when there is a reason’; for one who is insane; or for a beginner.

Tatiyapāṭidesanīyasikkhāpadaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ.
