## 4.The Training Rule Concerning Six Years

557. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū anuvassaṃ santhataṃ kārāpenti. Te yācanabahulā viññattibahulā viharanti – ‘‘eḷakalomāni detha. Eḷakalomehi attho’’ti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma samaṇā sakyaputtiyā anuvassaṃ santhataṃ kārāpessanti, yācanabahulā viññattibahulā viharissanti – ‘eḷakalomāni detha, eḷakalomehi attho’’’ti! Amhākaṃ pana sakiṃ katāni santhatāni pañcapi chapi vassāni honti, yesaṃ no dārakā uhadantipi ummihantipi undūrehipi khajjanti. Ime pana samaṇā sakyaputtiyā anuvassaṃ santhataṃ kārāpenti, yācanabahulā viññattibahulā viharanti – ‘‘eḷakalomāni detha, eḷakalomehi attho’’ti!

557.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time, monks were having felt rugs made every year. They were constantly begging and requesting: “Give us sheep’s wool. We need sheep’s wool.” People complained, criticized, and spread it about: “How can these Sakyan ascetics have felt rugs made every year, constantly begging and requesting, ‘Give us sheep’s wool, we need sheep’s wool’? For us, felt rugs made once last five or six years, even though our children defecate and urinate on them, and they get eaten by rats. But these Sakyan ascetics have felt rugs made every year, constantly begging and requesting, ‘Give us sheep’s wool, we need sheep’s wool’!”

Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū tesaṃ manussānaṃ ujjhāyantānaṃ khiyyantānaṃ vipācentānaṃ. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma bhikkhū anuvassaṃ santhataṃ kārāpessanti, yācanabahulā viññattibahulā viharissanti – ‘eḷakalomāni detha, eḷakalomehi attho’’’ti! Atha kho te bhikkhū te anekapariyāyena vigarahitvā bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, bhikkhū anuvassaṃ santhataṃ kārāpenti, yācanabahulā viññattibahulā viharanti – ‘eḷakalomāni detha, eḷakalomehi attho’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ, bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… kathañhi nāma te, bhikkhave, moghapurisā anuvassaṃ santhataṃ kārāpessanti, yācanabahulā viññattibahulā viharissanti – ‘eḷakalomāni detha, eḷakalomehi attho’ti! Netaṃ, bhikkhave, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

The monks heard these people complaining, criticizing, and spreading it about. Those monks who were modest… complained, criticized, and spoke up: “How can monks have a felt rug made every year, constantly begging and requesting—‘Give us sheep’s wool, we need sheep’s wool’?” Then those monks, after rebuking them in many ways, reported the matter to the Blessed One… “Is it true, monks, that monks have a felt rug made every year, constantly begging and requesting—‘Give us sheep’s wool, we need sheep’s wool’?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One rebuked them… “How can you, foolish men, have a felt rug made every year, constantly begging and requesting—‘Give us sheep’s wool, we need sheep’s wool’? This is not for the confidence of those without confidence…” And, monks, you should recite this training rule thus:

558. ‘‘Navaṃ pana bhikkhunā santhataṃ kārāpetvā chabbassāni dhāretabbaṃ. Orena ce channaṃ vassānaṃ taṃ santhataṃ vissajjetvā vā avissajjetvā vā aññaṃ navaṃ santhataṃ kārāpeyya, nissaggiyaṃ pācittiya’’nti.

558.“If a monk has a new felt rug made, it should be kept for six years. If, within six years, having discarded that felt rug or not discarded it, he has another new felt rug made, it is to be forfeited and confessed.”

Evañcidaṃ bhagavatā bhikkhūnaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ paññattaṃ hoti.

Thus was this training rule laid down by the Blessed One for the monks.

559. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu kosambiyaṃ gilāno hoti. Ñātakā tassa bhikkhuno santike dūtaṃ pāhesuṃ – ‘‘āgacchatu, bhadanto mayaṃ upaṭṭhahissāmā’’ti. Bhikkhūpi evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘gacchāvuso, ñātakā taṃ upaṭṭhahissantī’’ti. So evamāha – ‘‘bhagavatā, āvuso, sikkhāpadaṃ paññattaṃ – ‘navaṃ pana bhikkhunā santhataṃ kārāpetvā chabbassāni dhāretabba’nti. Ahañcamhi gilāno, na sakkomi santhataṃ ādāya pakkamituṃ. Mayhañca vinā santhatā na phāsu hoti. Nāhaṃ gamissāmī’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, gilānassa bhikkhuno santhatasammutiṃ dātuṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, dātabbā. Tena gilānena bhikkhunā saṅghaṃ upasaṅkamitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā vuḍḍhānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ pāde vanditvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā evamassa vacanīyo – ‘ahaṃ, bhante, gilāno. Na sakkomi santhataṃ ādāya pakkamituṃ. Sohaṃ, bhante, saṅghaṃ santhatasammutiṃ yācāmī’ti. Dutiyampi yācitabbā. Tatiyampi yācitabbā. Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

559.At that time, a certain monk in Kosambī was sick. His relatives sent a messenger to that monk, saying: “Come, Venerable, we will look after you.” The monks also said to him, “Go, friend, your relatives will look after you.” He replied, “The Blessed One has laid down a training rule: ‘A monk who has had a new felt rug made should keep it for six years.’ I am sick and cannot take the felt rug with me. And without the felt rug, I am not comfortable. I will not go.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, in this connection, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow a sick monk to be given permission concerning a felt rug. And, monks, it should be given thus: The sick monk should approach the Saṅgha, adjust his upper robe over one shoulder, venerate the feet of the senior monks, sit squatting, raise his joined hands, and say: ‘Venerable sirs, I am sick. I cannot take the felt rug with me. I ask the Saṅgha for permission concerning a felt rug.’ He should ask a second time, and a third time. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha thus:

560. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo bhikkhu gilāno. Na sakkoti santhataṃ ādāya pakkamituṃ. So saṅghaṃ santhatasammutiṃ yācati. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmassa bhikkhuno santhatasammutiṃ dadeyya. Esā ñatti.

560.“Venerable sirs, let the Saṅgha hear me. This monk, named so-and-so, is ill. He is unable to depart taking his felt rug with him. He requests the Saṅgha’s permission concerning a felt rug. If the Saṅgha is ready, the Saṅgha should grant the monk, named so-and-so, permission concerning a felt rug. This is the announcement.”

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo bhikkhu gilāno. Na sakkoti santhataṃ ādāya pakkamituṃ. So saṅghaṃ santhatasammutiṃ yācati. Saṅgho itthannāmassa bhikkhuno santhatasammutiṃ deti. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa bhikkhuno santhatasammutiyā dānaṃ, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. This monk, named so-and-so, is sick. He is unable to depart carrying his felt rug. He requests the Saṅgha’s permission concerning a felt rug. The Saṅgha grants permission concerning a felt rug to the monk, named so-and-so. If granting permission concerning a felt rug to the monk, named so-and-so, is agreeable to the venerable one, he should be silent; whoever is not agreeable should speak.

‘‘Dinnā saṅghena itthannāmassa bhikkhuno santhatasammuti. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

“Permission concerning a felt rug has been granted by the Saṅgha to the monk named so-and-so. The Saṅgha is agreeable, therefore it is silent. I shall remember it thus.”

Evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

And, monks, you should recite this training rule thus:

561. ‘‘Navaṃ pana bhikkhunā santhataṃ kārāpetvā chabbassāni dhāretabbaṃ. Orena ce channaṃ vassānaṃ taṃ santhataṃ vissajjetvā vā avissajjetvā vā aññaṃ navaṃ santhataṃ kārāpeyya, aññatra bhikkhusammutiyā, nissaggiyaṃ pācittiya’’nti.

561.“If a monk gets a new felt rug made, it should be kept for six years. If, within six years, having discarded that felt rug or not discarded it, he has another new felt rug made, unless with the permission of the Saṅgha, it is to be forfeited and confessed.”

562. Navaṃ nāma karaṇaṃ upādāya vuccati.

562.New means it is so called with reference to its making.

Santhataṃ nāma santharitvā kataṃ hoti avāyimaṃ.

A felt rug means something made by spreading out, not woven.

Kārāpetvāti karitvā vā kārāpetvā vā.

Has made means having made it oneself or having had it made.

Chabbassāni dhāretabbanti chabbassaparamatā dhāretabbaṃ.

To be kept for six years means it should be kept for a maximum of six years.

Orena ce channaṃ vassānanti ūnakachabbassāni.

Within six years means less than six years.

Taṃ santhataṃ vissajjetvāti aññesaṃ datvā.

Having discarded that felt rug means having given it to others.

Avissajjetvāti na kassaci datvā.

Not having discarded means not having given it to anyone.

Aññatra bhikkhusammutiyāti ṭhapetvā bhikkhusammutiṃ aññaṃ navaṃ santhataṃ karoti vā kārāpeti vā, payoge dukkaṭaṃ. Paṭilābhena nissaggiyaṃ hoti. Nissajjitabbaṃ saṅghassa vā gaṇassa vā puggalassa vā. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, nissajjitabbaṃ…pe… idaṃ me, bhante, santhataṃ ūnakachabbassāni kārāpitaṃ, aññatra bhikkhusammutiyā, nissaggiyaṃ. Imāhaṃ saṅghassa nissajjāmīti…pe… dadeyyāti…pe… dadeyyunti…pe… āyasmato dammīti.

Unless with the permission of the Saṅgha means that except with the permission of the Saṅgha, if he makes or has another new felt rug made, there is an offence of wrong doing at the commencement. Upon acquisition, it is to be forfeited. It is to be forfeited to the Saṅgha, or to a group, or to an individual. And, monks, it should be forfeited thus: … “Venerable sir, this felt rug was made by me within less than six years, without the permission of the Saṅgha; it is to be forfeited. I forfeit this to the Saṅgha.” … (and so on, for the formal act of forfeiture and redistribution) … “I give this to the venerable one.”

563. Attanā vippakataṃ attanā pariyosāpeti, nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ. Attanā vippakataṃ parehi pariyosāpeti, nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ. Parehi vippakataṃ attanā pariyosāpeti, nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ. Parehi vippakataṃ parehi pariyosāpeti, nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ.

563.If he himself begins and himself finishes it, it is to be forfeited and confessed. If he himself begins and others finish it, it is to be forfeited and confessed. If others begin and he himself finishes it, it is to be forfeited and confessed. If others begin and others finish it, it is to be forfeited and confessed.

564. Anāpatti chabbassāni karoti, atirekachabbassāni karoti, aññassatthāya karoti vā kārāpeti vā, aññena kataṃ paṭilabhitvā paribhuñjati, vitānaṃ vā bhūmattharaṇaṃ vā sāṇipākāraṃ vā bhisiṃ vā bibbohanaṃ vā karoti, bhikkhusammutiyā, ummattakassa, ādikammikassāti.

564.There is no offence if he makes it after six years, if he makes it after more than six years, if he makes it or has it made for another person, if he uses what was obtained from another, if he makes a canopy, a floor covering, a screen, a cushion, or a pillow, if it is with the permission of the Saṅgha, if he is insane, or if he is the first wrongdoer.

Chabbassasikkhāpadaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ catutthaṃ.

The training rule concerning six years, the fourth, is concluded.
