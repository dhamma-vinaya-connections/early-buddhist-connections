## 2.The training rule concerning a bowl with fewer than five bindings.

609. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sakkesu viharati kapilavatthusmiṃ nigrodhārāme. Tena kho pana samayena aññatarena kumbhakārena bhikkhū pavāritā honti – ‘‘yesaṃ ayyānaṃ pattena attho ahaṃ pattenā’’ti. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū na mattaṃ jānitvā bahū patte viññāpenti. Yesaṃ khuddakā pattā te mahante patte viññāpenti. Yesaṃ mahantā pattā te khuddake patte viññāpenti. Atha kho so kumbhakāro bhikkhūnaṃ bahū patte karonto na sakkoti aññaṃ vikkāyikaṃ bhaṇḍaṃ kātuṃ, attanāpi na yāpeti, puttadārāpissa kilamanti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma samaṇā sakyaputtiyā na mattaṃ jānitvā bahū patte viññāpessanti! Ayaṃ imesaṃ bahū patte karonto na sakkoti aññaṃ vikkāyikaṃ bhaṇḍaṃ kātuṃ, attanāpi na yāpeti, puttadārāpissa kilamantī’’ti.

609.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Park. At that time, a certain potter had invited the monks, saying: “Whatever bowls the venerable ones need, I will provide bowls.” But at that time, the monks, not knowing the proper measure, requested many bowls. Those who had small bowls requested large bowls. Those who had large bowls requested small bowls. Then that potter, making many bowls for the monks, was unable to make other merchandise for sale; he could not even support himself, and his children and wife were suffering hardship. People complained, grumbled, and criticized: “How can these Sakyan recluses, not knowing the proper measure, request so many bowls? This potter, making many bowls for them, is unable to make other merchandise for sale; he cannot even support himself, and his children and wife are suffering hardship!”

Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū tesaṃ manussānaṃ ujjhāyantānaṃ khiyyantānaṃ vipācentānaṃ. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma bhikkhū na mattaṃ jānitvā bahū patte viññāpessantī’’ti! Atha kho te bhikkhū te anekapariyāyena vigarahitvā bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, bhikkhū na mattaṃ jānitvā bahū patte viññāpentīti? ‘‘Saccaṃ, bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… kathañhi nāma te, bhikkhave, moghapurisā na mattaṃ jānitvā bahū patte viññāpessanti! Netaṃ, bhikkhave, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… vigarahitvā dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, patto viññāpetabbo. Yo viññāpeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

The monks heard those people complaining, grumbling, and criticizing. Those monks of few desires… complained, grumbled, and criticized: “How indeed can monks, not knowing the proper measure, request many bowls?” Then those monks, having rebuked them in many ways, reported this matter to the Blessed One… “Is it true, monks, that monks, not knowing the proper measure, request many bowls?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One, the Buddha, rebuked them… “How indeed can those foolish men, monks, not knowing the proper measure, request many bowls? This is not for the confidence of the unconfident…” Having rebuked them and given a Dhamma talk, he addressed the monks: “Monks, a bowl should not be requested. Whoever requests one incurs an offense of wrong-doing.”

610. Tena kho pana samayena aññatarassa bhikkhuno patto bhinno hoti. Atha kho so bhikkhu – ‘‘bhagavatā paṭikkhittaṃ pattaṃ viññāpetu’’nti kukkuccāyanto na viññāpeti. Hatthesu piṇḍāya carati. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma samaṇā sakyaputtiyā hatthesu piṇḍāya carissanti, seyyathāpi titthiyā’’ti! Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū tesaṃ manussānaṃ ujjhāyantānaṃ khiyyantānaṃ vipācentānaṃ. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, naṭṭhapattassa vā bhinnapattassa vā pattaṃ viññāpetu’’nti.

610.At that time, a certain monk’s bowl was broken. Then that monk, being scrupulous and thinking, “The Blessed One has prohibited requesting a bowl,” did not request one. He went for alms with his hands. People complained, grumbled, and criticized: “How can these Sakyan recluses go for alms with their hands, just like the sectarians?” The monks heard those people complaining, grumbling, and criticizing. Then those monks reported this matter to the Blessed One. Then, on this occasion, in this connection, the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow requesting a bowl for one whose bowl is lost or broken.”

611. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū – ‘‘bhagavatā anuññātaṃ naṭṭhapattassa vā bhinnapattassa vā pattaṃ viññāpetu’’nti appamattakenapi bhinnena appamattakenapi khaṇḍena vilikhitamattenapi bahū patte viññāpenti. Atha kho so kumbhakāro bhikkhūnaṃ tatheva bahū patte karonto na sakkoti aññaṃ vikkāyikaṃ bhaṇḍaṃ kātuṃ, attanāpi na yāpeti, puttadārāpissa kilamanti. Manussā tatheva ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma samaṇā sakyaputtiyā na mattaṃ jānitvā bahū patte viññāpessanti! Ayaṃ imesaṃ bahū patte karonto na sakkoti aññaṃ vikkāyikaṃ bhaṇḍaṃ kātuṃ, attanāpi na yāpeti, puttadārāpissa kilamantī’’ti.

611.At that time the group of six monks, thinking, “The Blessed One has allowed requesting a bowl for one whose bowl is lost or broken,” requested many bowls even if only slightly broken, or slightly chipped, or merely scratched. Then that potter, making many bowls for the monks, just as before, was unable to make other merchandise for sale; he could not even support himself, and his children and wife were suffering hardship. People complained, grumbled, and criticized: “How can these Sakyan recluses, not knowing the proper measure, request so many bowls? This potter, making many bowls for them, is unable to make other merchandise for sale; he cannot even support himself, and his children and wife are suffering hardship!”

Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū tesaṃ manussānaṃ ujjhāyantānaṃ khiyyantānaṃ vipācentānaṃ. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma chabbaggiyā bhikkhū appamattakenapi bhinnena appamattakenapi khaṇḍena vilikhitamattenapi bahū patte viññāpessantī’’ti! Atha kho te bhikkhū chabbaggiye bhikkhū anekapariyāyena vigarahitvā bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ kira tumhe, bhikkhave, appamattakenapi bhinnena appamattakenapi khaṇḍena vilikhitamattenapi bahū patte viññāpethā’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ, bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… kathañhi nāma tumhe, moghapurisā, appamattakenapi bhinnena appamattakenapi khaṇḍena vilikhitamattenapi bahū patte viññāpessatha! Netaṃ, moghapurisā, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

The monks heard those people complaining, grumbling, and criticizing. Those monks of few desires… complained, grumbled, and criticized: “How indeed can the group of six monks request so many bowls even if only slightly broken, or slightly chipped, or merely scratched?” Then those monks, having rebuked the group of six monks in many ways, reported this matter to the Blessed One… “Is it true, monks, that you request many bowls even if only slightly broken, or slightly chipped, or merely scratched?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One, the Buddha, rebuked them… “How indeed can you, foolish men, request so many bowls even if only slightly broken, or slightly chipped, or merely scratched? This is not for the confidence of the unconfident…” And thus, monks, you should recite this training rule:

612. ‘‘Yo pana bhikkhu ūnapañcabandhanena pattena aññaṃ navaṃ pattaṃ cetāpeyya, nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ. Tena bhikkhunā so patto bhikkhuparisāya nissajjitabbo. Yo ca tassā bhikkhuparisāya pattapariyanto so tassa bhikkhuno padātabbo – ‘ayaṃ te, bhikkhu, patto yāva bhedanāya dhāretabbo’ti. Ayaṃ tattha sāmīcī’’ti.

612.“If a monk, whose bowl has fewer than five bindings, should have another new bowl obtained, it entails forfeiture and is to be confessed. That monk must forfeit that bowl to the community of monks. And whatever bowl is the last of that community of monks should be given to that monk with the words: ‘This bowl, monk, is to be kept by you until it breaks.’ This is the proper course of action here.”

613. Yo panāti yo yādiso…pe… bhikkhūti…pe… ayaṃ imasmiṃ atthe adhippeto bhikkhūti.

613.“Now whoever” means whoever, of whatever sort… “Monk” means… in this context, a monk is intended.

Ūnapañcabandhano nāma patto abandhano vā ekabandhano vā dvibandhano vā tibandhano vā catubandhano vā. Abandhanokāso nāma patto yassa dvaṅgulā rāji na hoti. Bandhanokāso nāma patto yassa dvaṅgulā rāji hoti. Navo nāma patto viññattiṃ upādāya vuccati.

A bowl with fewer than five bindings is called a bowl with no binding, or one binding, or two bindings, or three bindings, or four bindings. A bowl without a place for a binding is one where there is no two-finger-breadth line. A bowl with a place for a binding is one where there is a two-finger-breadth line. A new bowl is so called by way of the request.

Cetāpeyyāti viññāpeti, payoge dukkaṭaṃ. Paṭilābhena nissaggiyo hoti. Saṅghamajjhe nissajjitabbo. Sabbeheva adhiṭṭhitapattaṃ gahetvā sannipatitabbaṃ. Na lāmako patto adhiṭṭhātabbo – ‘‘mahagghaṃ pattaṃ gahessāmī’’ti. Sace lāmakaṃ pattaṃ adhiṭṭheti – ‘‘mahagghaṃ pattaṃ gahessāmī’’ti, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, nissajjitabbo. Tena bhikkhunā saṅghaṃ upasaṅkamitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā vuḍḍhānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ pāde vanditvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘ayaṃ me, bhante, patto ūnapañcabandhanena pattena cetāpito nissaggiyo. Imāhaṃ saṅghassa nissajjāmī’’ti. Nissajjitvā āpatti desetabbā. Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena āpatti paṭiggahetabbā. Pañcahaṅgehi samannāgato bhikkhu pattaggāhāpako sammannitabbo – yo na chandāgatiṃ gaccheyya, na dosāgatiṃ gaccheyya, na mohāgatiṃ gaccheyya, na bhayāgatiṃ gaccheyya, gāhitāgāhitañca jāneyya. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, sammannitabbo. Paṭhamaṃ bhikkhu yācitabbo. Yācitvā byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

“‘He should have it obtained’ means he requests it; at the attempt, an offense of wrong-doing is incurred. Upon obtaining it, it is subject to forfeiture. It must be forfeited in the midst of the Community. All should gather, having taken a bowl that has been designated. A worthless bowl should not be designated, thinking: “I will take an expensive bowl.” If one designates a worthless bowl, thinking: “I will take an expensive bowl,” an offense of wrong-doing is incurred. And thus, monks, it should be forfeited. That monk, having approached the Community, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, having paid homage at the feet of the elder monks, sitting in a squatting position, having raised his hands in reverence, should say this: “Venerable sirs, this bowl of mine, obtained by means of a bowl with fewer than five bindings, is subject to forfeiture. I forfeit it to the Community.” Having forfeited it, the offense should be confessed. The offense should be accepted by a capable monk. A monk endowed with five factors should be appointed as the bowl-receiver: one who does not go by way for desire, does not go by way for aversion, does not go by way for delusion, does not go by way for fear, and who knows what has been taken and what has not been taken. And thus, monks, he should be appointed. First, a monk should be requested. Having been requested, the Community should be informed by a capable monk:

614. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ pattaggāhāpakaṃ sammanneyya. Esā ñatti.

614.“Venerable sirs, may the Community hear me. If it is agreeable to the Community, the Community should appoint the monk of such-and-such a name as the bowl-taker. This is the motion.”

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ pattaggāhāpakaṃ sammannati. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa bhikkhuno pattaggāhāpakassa sammuti, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“Venerable sirs, may the Community hear me. The Community appoints the monk of such-and-such a name as the bowl-taker. If the appointment of the monk of such-and-such a name as the bowl-taker is agreeable to any venerable one, he should remain silent; whoever is not agreeable should speak.”

‘‘Sammato saṅghena itthannāmo bhikkhu pattaggāhāpako. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

“The monk of such-and-such a name has been appointed as the bowl-taker by the Community. It is agreeable to the Community, therefore it is silent. Thus do I understand it.”

615. Tena sammatena bhikkhunā patto gāhetabbo. Thero vattabbo – ‘‘gaṇhātu, bhante, thero patta’’nti. Sace thero gaṇhāti, therassa patto dutiyassa gāhetabbo. Na ca tassa anuddayatāya na gahetabbo. Yo na gaṇheyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Apattakassa na gāhetabbo. Eteneva upāyena yāva saṅghanavakā gāhetabbā. Yo ca tassā bhikkhuparisāya pattapariyanto, so tassa bhikkhuno padātabbo – ‘‘ayaṃ te, bhikkhu, patto yāva bhedanāya dhāretabbo’’ti.

615.The bowl should be taken by that appointed monk. The elder should be addressed: “Venerable elder, please take the bowl.” If the elder takes it, the bowl should then be given to the second. And one should not fail to take it out of compassion for him. Whoever does not take it incurs an offense of wrong-doing. It should not be taken from one who is without a bowl. In this way, bowls should be given up to the most junior of the Community. And whatever bowl is the last of that community of monks, that bowl should be given to that monk with the words: “This bowl, monk, is to be kept by you until it breaks.”

Tena bhikkhunā so patto na adese nikkhipitabbo, na abhogena bhuñjitabbo, na vissajjetabbo – ‘‘kathāyaṃ patto nasseyya vā vinasseyya vā bhijjeyya vā’’ti? Sace adese vā nikkhipati abhogena vā bhuñjati vissajjeti vā, āpatti dukkaṭassa.

That bhikkhu should not place that bowl in an improper place, nor use it improperly, nor give it away—thinking, “How might this bowl be lost, destroyed, or broken?” If he places it in an improper place, or uses it improperly, or gives it away, he commits an offense of wrongdoing.

Ayaṃ tattha sāmīcīti ayaṃ tattha anudhammatā.

This is the proper procedure there.
