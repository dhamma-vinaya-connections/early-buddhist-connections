## 5. Cīvaraacchindanasikkhāpadaṃ

## 5.The training rule on snatching a robe.

631. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā upanando sakyaputto bhātuno saddhivihārikaṃ bhikkhuṃ etadavoca – ‘‘ehāvuso, janapadacārikaṃ pakkamissāmā’’ti. ‘‘Nāhaṃ, bhante, gamissāmi; dubbalacīvaromhī’’ti. ‘‘Ehāvuso, ahaṃ te cīvaraṃ dassāmī’’ti tassa cīvaraṃ adāsi. Assosi kho so bhikkhu – ‘‘bhagavā kira janapadacārikaṃ pakkamissatī’’ti. Atha kho tassa bhikkhuno etadahosi – ‘‘na dānāhaṃ āyasmatā upanandena sakyaputtena saddhiṃ janapadacārikaṃ pakkamissāmi, bhagavatā saddhiṃ janapadacārikaṃ pakkamissāmī’’ti. Atha kho āyasmā upanando sakyaputto taṃ bhikkhuṃ etadavoca – ‘‘ehi dāni, āvuso, janapadacārikaṃ pakkamissāmā’’ti. ‘‘Nāhaṃ, bhante, tayā saddhiṃ janapadacārikaṃ pakkamissāmi, bhagavatā saddhiṃ janapadacārikaṃ pakkamissāmī’’ti. ‘‘Yampi tyāhaṃ, āvuso, cīvaraṃ adāsiṃ, mayā saddhiṃ janapadacārikaṃ pakkamissatī’’ti, kupito anattamano acchindi.

631.At that time the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Now at that time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan said to a bhikkhu who was his brother's co-resident, "Come, friend, let's go wandering in the countryside." "I won't go, Venerable, my robe is too worn." "Come, friend, I'll give you a robe," and he gave him a robe. That bhikkhu heard, "The Blessed One is about to go wandering in the countryside." Then that bhikkhu thought, "I won't go wandering in the countryside with Venerable Upananda the Sakyan; I'll go wandering in the countryside with the Blessed One." Then Venerable Upananda the Sakyan said to that bhikkhu, "Come now, friend, let's go wandering in the countryside." "I won't go, Venerable, wandering in the countryside with you; I'll go wandering in the countryside with the Blessed One." "Even though I gave you a robe, friend, you are to go wandering in the countryside with me!" Angry and displeased, he snatched it away.

Atha kho so bhikkhu bhikkhūnaṃ etamatthaṃ ārocesi. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma āyasmā upanando sakyaputto bhikkhussa sāmaṃ cīvaraṃ datvā kupito anattamano acchindissatī’’ti! Atha kho te bhikkhū āyasmantaṃ upanandaṃ sakyaputtaṃ anekapariyāyena vigarahitvā bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ kira tvaṃ, upananda, bhikkhussa sāmaṃ cīvaraṃ datvā kupito anattamano acchindī’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ, bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… kathañhi nāma tvaṃ, moghapurisa, bhikkhussa sāmaṃ cīvaraṃ datvā kupito anattamano acchindissasi! Netaṃ, moghapurisa, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

Then that bhikkhu informed the bhikkhus about the matter. Those bhikkhus who were modest…pe…criticized, complained, and protested: “How could Venerable Upananda the Sakyan, after personally giving a robe to a bhikkhu, become angry and displeased and snatch it away?” Then those bhikkhus, having rebuked Venerable Upananda the Sakyan in many ways, informed the Blessed One about the matter… “Is it true, Upananda, that after personally giving a robe to a bhikkhu, you became angry and displeased and snatched it away?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked him… “Foolish man, how could you, after personally giving a robe to a bhikkhu, become angry and displeased and snatch it away? This will not inspire confidence in those who are without it… And so, bhikkhus, this training rule should be announced like this:

632. ‘‘Yo pana bhikkhu bhikkhussa sāmaṃ cīvaraṃ datvā kupito anattamano acchindeyya vā acchindāpeyya vā, nissaggiyaṃ pācittiya’’nti.

632."If any bhikkhu, having personally given a robe to another bhikkhu, should then become angry or displeased and snatch it away himself or cause another to snatch it away, it is to be forfeited and confessed."

633. Yo panāti yo yādiso…pe… bhikkhūti…pe… ayaṃ imasmiṃ atthe adhippeto bhikkhūti.

633."Yo panāti" means whoever, of whatever sort... "bhikkhūti"... in this connection, the bhikkhu intended.

Bhikkhussāti aññassa bhikkhussa.

"Bhikkhussa" means another bhikkhu.

Sāmanti sayaṃ datvā.

"Sāmaṃ" means having personally given.

Cīvaraṃ nāma channaṃ cīvarānaṃ aññataraṃ cīvaraṃ, vikappanupagaṃ pacchimaṃ.

"A robe" means one of the six kinds of robe-cloth, eligible for determination, the last robe.

Kupito anattamanoti anabhiraddho āhatacitto khilajāto.

"Angry and displeased" means not delighted, with a smitten mind, with stubbornness arisen.

Acchindeyyāti sayaṃ acchindati, nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ [nissaggiyaṃ hoti (syā.)].

"He should snatch away" means he himself snatches away; it entails expiation with forfeiture.

Acchindāpeyyāti aññaṃ āṇāpeti, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Sakiṃ āṇatto bahukampi acchindati, nissaggiyaṃ hoti. Nissajjitabbaṃ saṅghassa vā gaṇassa vā puggalassa vā. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, nissajjitabbaṃ…pe… idaṃ me, bhante, cīvaraṃ bhikkhussa sāmaṃ datvā acchinnaṃ nissaggiyaṃ imāhaṃ saṅghassa nissajjāmīti…pe… dadeyyāti …pe… dadeyyunti…pe… āyasmato dammīti.

"To have (it) snatched away" means he orders another to snatch it away; there is an offense of wrong-doing. If, having been ordered once, [the other person] snatches away many, it becomes subject to forfeiture. It should be forfeited to the Sangha, a group, or an individual. And thus, bhikkhus, it should be forfeited… "Venerable sirs, this robe, having been personally given by me to a bhikkhu and then snatched away, is subject to forfeiture. I forfeit it to the Sangha."… "…should give…" "…should give…" "…I give (it) to the venerable."

634. Upasampanne upasampannasaññī cīvaraṃ datvā kupito anattamano acchindati vā acchindāpeti vā, nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ. Upasampanne vematiko cīvaraṃ datvā kupito anattamano acchindati vā acchindāpeti vā, nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ. Upasampanne anupasampannasaññī cīvaraṃ datvā kupito anattamano acchindati vā acchindāpeti vā, nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ.

634.If, having given a robe to one who is fully ordained, perceiving him as fully ordained, one becomes angry and displeased and snatches it away or has it snatched away, it is to be relinquished and confessed. If, having given a robe to one who is fully ordained, being uncertain about his status, one becomes angry and displeased and snatches it away or has it snatched away, it is to be relinquished and confessed. If, having given a robe to one who is fully ordained, perceiving him as not fully ordained, one becomes angry and displeased and snatches it away or has it snatched away, it is to be relinquished and confessed.

Aññaṃ parikkhāraṃ datvā kupito anattamano acchindati vā acchindāpeti vā, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anupasampannassa cīvaraṃ vā aññaṃ vā parikkhāraṃ datvā kupito anattamano acchindati vā acchindāpeti vā, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anupasampanne upasampannasaññī, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anupasampanne vematiko, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anupasampanne anupasampannasaññī, āpatti dukkaṭassa.

Having given another requisite, being angry and displeased, one snatches it away or has it snatched away, there is an offense of wrong-doing. Having given a robe or another requisite to one who is not fully ordained, being angry and displeased, one snatches it away or has it snatched away, there is an offense of wrong-doing. Perceiving one who is not fully ordained as fully ordained, there is an offense of wrong-doing. Being in doubt about one who is not fully ordained, there is an offense of wrong-doing. Perceiving one who is not fully ordained as not fully ordained, there is an offense of wrong-doing.

635. Anāpatti – so vā deti, tassa vā vissasanto gaṇhāti, ummattakassa ādikammikassāti.

635.No offense – he gives it back, or he takes it back with the recipient's consent; for an insane person, for a first offender.

Cīvaraacchindanasikkhāpadaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ pañcamaṃ.

The fifth training rule on snatching a robe is finished.
