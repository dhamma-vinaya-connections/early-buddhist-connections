## 6.The Training Rule concerning Goat Hair.

571. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena aññatarassa bhikkhuno kosalesu janapade sāvatthiṃ gacchantassa antarāmagge eḷakalomāni uppajjiṃsu. Atha kho so bhikkhu tāni eḷakalomāni uttarāsaṅgena bhaṇḍikaṃ bandhitvā agamāsi. Manussā taṃ bhikkhuṃ passitvā uppaṇḍesuṃ – ‘‘kittakena te, bhante, kītāni? Kittako udayo bhavissatī’’ti? So bhikkhu tehi manussehi uppaṇḍiyamāno maṅku ahosi. Atha kho so bhikkhu sāvatthiṃ gantvā tāni eḷakalomāni ṭhitakova āsumbhi. Bhikkhū taṃ bhikkhuṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘kissa tvaṃ, āvuso, imāni eḷakalomāni ṭhitakova āsumbhasī’’ti? ‘‘Tathā hi panāhaṃ, āvuso, imesaṃ eḷakalomānaṃ kāraṇā manussehi uppaṇḍito’’ti. ‘‘Kīva dūrato pana tvaṃ, āvuso, imāni eḷakalomāni āharī’’ti? ‘‘Atirekatiyojanaṃ, āvuso’’ti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma bhikkhu atirekatiyojanaṃ eḷakalomāni āharissatī’’ti! Atha kho te bhikkhū taṃ bhikkhuṃ anekapariyāyena vigarahitvā bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… saccaṃ kira tvaṃ, bhikkhu, atirekatiyojanaṃ eḷakalomāni āharīti? ‘‘Saccaṃ, bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… kathañhi nāma tvaṃ, moghapurisa, atirekatiyojanaṃ eḷakalomāni āharissasi! Netaṃ moghapurisa, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ uddiseyyātha –

571.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now on that occasion, a certain bhikkhu traveling through the Kosala countryside on his way to Sāvatthī came across some goat hair. Then that bhikkhu tied the goat hair into a bundle with his outer robe and went on. People who saw that bhikkhu mocked him, saying, “Venerable, for how much were these bought? How much profit will there be?” That bhikkhu, being mocked by those people, was embarrassed. Then that bhikkhu, having gone to Sāvatthī, dropped that goat hair while standing. The bhikkhus said to that bhikkhu, “Friend, why are you dropping this goat hair while standing?” “Because, friends, I was mocked by people on account of this goat hair.” “But how far did you bring this goat hair, friend?” “More than three leagues, friend.” Those bhikkhus who were of few desires… complained, criticized, and spread it about: “How can a bhikkhu bring goat hair more than three leagues?” Then those bhikkhus, having rebuked that bhikkhu in many ways, informed the Blessed One of this matter… “Is it true, as is said, bhikkhu, that you brought goat hair more than three leagues?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked him… “How can you, foolish man, bring goat hair more than three leagues? This, foolish man, is not for the confidence of the unconfident… And thus, bhikkhus, this training rule should be recited:

572. ‘‘Bhikkhuno paneva addhānamaggappaṭipannassa eḷakalomāni uppajjayyuṃ. Ākaṅkhamānena bhikkhunā paṭiggahetabbāni. Paṭiggahetvā tiyojanaparamaṃ sahatthā haritabbāni nti.

572.“If goat hair should come into the possession of a bhikkhu traveling along a road, if he wishes, it should be accepted by him. Having accepted it, it should be carried by himself for at most three leagues, if there is no carrier. If he should carry it beyond that, even if there is no carrier, it is subject to forfeiture and requires confession.”

573. Bhikkhuno paneva addhānamaggappaṭipannassāti panthaṃ gacchantassa.

573.A bhikkhu traveling along a road: that is, one going on a journey.

Eḷakalomāni uppajjeyyunti uppajjeyyuṃ saṅghato vā gaṇato vā ñātito vā mittato vā paṃsukūlaṃ vā attano vā dhanena.

Goat hair should come into his possession: that is, goat hair that comes into his possession from the Sangha, or from a group, or from relatives, or from friends, or as discarded rags, or with his own wealth.

Ākaṅkhamānenāti icchamānena paṭiggahetabbāni.

If he wishes: that is, desiring, he should accept them.

Paṭiggahetvā tiyojanaparamaṃ sahatthā haritabbānīti tiyojanaparamatā sahatthā haritabbāni.

Having accepted it, it should be carried by himself for at most three leagues: that is, it should be carried by himself for at most three leagues.

Asante hāraketi nāñño koci hārako hoti itthī vā puriso vā gahaṭṭho vā pabbajito vā.

If there is no carrier: that is, there is no other carrier, whether a woman or a man, a layperson or a renunciate.

Tato ce uttari hareyya, asantepi hāraketi paṭhamaṃ pādaṃ tiyojanaṃ atikkāmeti, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Dutiyaṃ pādaṃ atikkāmeti, nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ [nissaggiyāni honti (syā.)]. Antotiyojane ṭhito bahitiyojanaṃ pāteti, nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ [nissaggiyāni honti (syā.)]. Aññassa yāne vā bhaṇḍe vā ajānantassa pakkhipitvā tiyojanaṃ atikkāmeti, nissaggiyāni honti. Nissajjitabbāni saṅghassa vā gaṇassa vā puggalassa vā. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, nissajjitabbāni…pe… imāni me, bhante, eḷakalomāni tiyojanaṃ atikkāmitāni nissaggiyāni. Imānāhaṃ saṅghassa nissajjāmīti…pe… dadeyyāti…pe… dadeyyunti…pe… āyasmato dammīti.

If he should carry it beyond that, even if there is no carrier: if he crosses the three-league mark with the first step, there is an offense of wrongdoing. If he crosses it with the second step, it is subject to forfeiture and requires confession. If, standing within three leagues, he casts it beyond three leagues, it is subject to forfeiture and requires confession. If, having placed it in another’s vehicle or goods without their knowledge, he crosses three leagues, they become subject to forfeiture. They are to be forfeited to the Sangha, to a group, or to an individual. And thus, bhikkhus, they should be forfeited… “Venerable sirs, these goat hairs of mine, having been carried beyond three leagues, are subject to forfeiture. I forfeit them to the Sangha.” … It may be given… “I give this to the venerable one.”

574. Atirekatiyojane atirekasaññī atikkāmeti [tiyojanaṃ atikkāmeti (syā.)], nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ. Atirekatiyojane vematiko atikkāmeti [tiyojanaṃ atikkāmeti (syā.)], nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ. Atirekatiyojane ūnakasaññī atikkāmeti [tiyojanaṃ atikkāmeti (syā.)], nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ.

574.If, when it is beyond three leagues, one perceives it as beyond and crosses it, it is subject to forfeiture and requires confession. If, when it is beyond three leagues, one is uncertain and crosses it, it is subject to forfeiture and requires confession. If, when it is beyond three leagues, one perceives it as less and crosses it, it is subject to forfeiture and requires confession.

Ūnakatiyojane atirekasaññī, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Ūnakatiyojane vematiko, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Ūnakatiyojane ūnakasaññī, anāpatti.

If, when it is less than three leagues, one perceives it as more, there is an offense of wrongdoing. If, when it is less than three leagues, one is uncertain, there is an offense of wrongdoing. If, when it is less than three leagues, one perceives it as less, there is no offense.

575. Anāpatti tiyojanaṃ harati, ūnakatiyojanaṃ harati, tiyojanaṃ haratipi, paccāharatipi, tiyojanaṃ vāsādhippāyo gantvā tato paraṃ harati, acchinnaṃ paṭilabhitvā harati, nissaṭṭhaṃ paṭilabhitvā harati, aññaṃ harāpeti katabhaṇḍaṃ, ummattakassa, ādikammikassāti.

575.There is no offense if one carries it for three leagues; if one carries it for less than three leagues; if one carries it for three leagues or carries it back; if, having gone with the intention to stay for three leagues, one carries it beyond that (due to not finding requisites, etc.); if one carries it after recovering what was seized (by thieves) and returned; if one carries it after recovering what was relinquished; if one has another carry a prepared item; for an insane person; for the first offender.

Eḷakalomasikkhāpadaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ chaṭṭhaṃ.

The sixth training rule concerning goat hair is concluded.
