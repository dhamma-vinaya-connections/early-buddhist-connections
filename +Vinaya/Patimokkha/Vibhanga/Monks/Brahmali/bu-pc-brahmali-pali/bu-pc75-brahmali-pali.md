## Vinaya Piṭaka - Monastic Rules

## Bhikkhu Vibhaṅga - Pācittiya 75: Not to make a threatening gesture to a fellow bhikkhu.
### B. Brahmali

- Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Brahmali.   

#### Origin

1At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, the monks from the group of six raised their hands in anger against the monks from the group of seventeen. Expecting to be hit, they cried.


Other monks asked them why, and they told them what had happened.


2The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How could the monks from the group of six do this?” …

“Is it true, monks, that you did this?”


“It’s true, Sir.”

The Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

#### Final ruling

3‘If a monk raises a hand in anger against a monk, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”

#### Definitions

4**A:** whoever … **Monk:** … The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.


5**Against a monk:** against another monk.

6**In anger:** discontent, having hatred, hostile.

7**Raises a hand:** if he raises any part of his body or anything connected to his body, even if just a lotus leaf, he commits an offense entailing confession.

#### Permutations

8If it is one who is fully ordained, and he perceives him as such, and he raises a hand against him in anger, he commits an offense entailing confession. If it is one who is fully ordained, but he is unsure of it, and he raises a hand against him in anger, he commits an offense entailing confession. If it is one who is fully ordained, but he does not perceive him as such, and he raises a hand against him in anger, he commits an offense entailing confession.

9If he raises a hand in anger against one who is not fully ordained, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is one who is not fully ordained, but he perceives them as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is one who is not fully ordained, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is one who is not fully ordained, and he does not perceive them as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

#### Non-offenses

10There is no offense: if he raises his hand in self-defence; if he is insane; if he is the first offender.

116The training rule on raising a hand, the fifth, is finished.
