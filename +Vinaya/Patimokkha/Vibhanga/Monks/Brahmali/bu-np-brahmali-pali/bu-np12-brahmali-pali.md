## Vinaya Piṭaka - Monastic Rules

## Bhikkhu Vibhaṅga - Nissaggiya Pācittiya 12: Not to accept a rug only made of black sheep wool.
### B. Brahmali

- Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Brahmali.   

#### Origin

1At one time when the Buddha was staying in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood near Vesālī, the monks from the group of six were having blankets made entirely of black wool. People who were walking about the dwellings complained and criticized them:

“How could the Sakyan monastics have blankets made entirely of black wool? They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”

2The monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks:

“How could the monks from the group of six have blankets made entirely of black wool?”

3After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:

“Is it true, monks, that you do this?”


“It’s true, Sir.”

The Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

#### Final ruling

4‘If a monk has a blanket made entirely of black wool, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”

#### Definitions

5**A:** whoever … **Monk:** … The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.


6**Black:** there are two kinds of black: natural black and dyed black.


7**A blanket:** it is made by strewing, not by weaving.

8**Has made:** If he makes the blanket, or has it made, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct. When he gets the blanket, it becomes subject to relinquishment.


The blanket should be relinquished to a saṅgha, a group, or an individual. “And, monks, it should be relinquished like this. To be expanded as in [[bu-np1#p17|Nissaggiya Pācittiya 1 verse 17]] with appropriate substitutions.


‘Venerables, this blanket, which I got made entirely of black wool, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ … the Sangha should give … you should give … ‘I give this blanket back to you.’”

#### Permutations

9If he finishes what he began himself, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If he has others finish what he began himself, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If he finishes himself what was begun by others, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If he has others finish what was begun by others, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.

10If he makes one, or has one made, for someone else, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If he gets one that was made by someone else and then uses it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

#### Non-offenses

11There is no offense: if he makes a canopy, a floor cover, a cloth screen, a mattress, or a pillow; if he is insane; if he is the first offender.

12The training rule on entirely black, the second, is finished.
