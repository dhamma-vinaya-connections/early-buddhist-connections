## Vinaya Piṭaka - Monastic Rules

## Bhikkhu Vibhaṅga - Sekhiya 64: Not to teach the dhamma to someone who is lying down unless they are ill.
### B. Brahmali

- Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Brahmali.   

#### Origin

1At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the monks from the group of six gave teachings to people who were lying down. …

#### Final ruling

2“‘I will not give a teaching to anyone lying down who is not sick,’ this is how you should train.”

3One should not give a teaching to anyone lying down who is not sick. If a monk, out of disrespect, gives a teaching to someone who is lying down and who is not sick, even if they are just lying on the ground, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

#### Non-offenses

4There is no offense: if it is unintentional; if he is not mindful; if he does not know; if he is sick; if there are dangers; if he is insane; if he is the first offender.


5The fourth training rule is finished.
