## Vinaya Piṭaka - Monastic Rules

## Bhikkhu Vibhaṅga - Saṅghādisesa 7: Having A Sponsored Hut Built Wrongly
### B. Brahmali

- Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Brahmali.   

#### Origin

1At one time when the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Monastery, a householder who was a supporter of Venerable Channa said to him, “I’ll have a dwelling built for you, Venerable, if you would find a site for it.”

While Venerable Channa was clearing a site for that dwelling, he felled a tree that served as a shrine and was revered by village, town, district, and kingdom. People complained and criticized him, “How could the Sakyan monastics fell a tree that serves as a shrine and is revered by village, town, district, and kingdom? They are hurting one-sensed life.”

2The monks heard the criticism of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Venerable Channa in the same way.

3After rebuking Venerable Channa in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Channa: “Is it true, Channa, that you did this?”

“It’s true, Sir.”


The Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? People perceive trees as conscious. This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

#### Final ruling

4‘When a monk builds a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself, he must have monks approve a site where no harm will be done and which has space on all sides. If a monk builds a large dwelling on a site where harm will be done and which lacks space on all sides, or he does not have monks approve the site, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”

#### Definitions

5**A large dwelling:** one with a sponsoring owner is what is meant.

6**Dwelling:** plastered inside or plastered outside or plastered both inside and outside.

7**Builds:** building it himself or having it built.

8**With a sponsoring owner:** there is another owner, either a woman or a man, either a lay person or one gone forth.

9**Intended for himself:** for his own use.

10**He must have monks approve a site:** The monk who is building a dwelling should clear a site, then approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:

“Venerables, I want to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for myself. I request the Sangha to inspect the site for the dwelling.”

He should make his request a second and a third time. If the whole Sangha is able to inspect the site, they should all go. If the whole Sangha is unable to inspect the site, then those monks there who are competent and capable—who know where harm will be done and where no harm will be done, and who understands the meaning of having space on all sides and lacking space on all sides—should be asked and then appointed.

“And, monks, they should be appointed like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:


11‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. Monk so-and-so wants to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself. He is requesting the Sangha to inspect the site for that dwelling. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site for the dwelling of monk-so-and-so. This is the motion.

12Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. Monk so-and-so wants to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself. He is requesting the Sangha to inspect the site for that dwelling. The Sangha is appointing monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site for the dwelling of monk-so-and-so. Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site for the dwelling of monk-so-and-so should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.

13The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site for the dwelling of monk so-and-so. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’

14The appointed monks should go and inspect the site for the dwelling to find out if any harm will be done and if it has space on all sides. If harm will be done and it lacks space on all sides, they should say, ‘Don’t build here.’ If no harm will be done and it has space on all sides, they should inform the Sangha: ‘No harm will be done and it has space on all sides.’ The monk who is building the dwelling should then approach the Sangha, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:

‘Venerables, I want to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for myself. I request the Sangha to approve the site for the dwelling.’

He should make his request a second and a third time. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:

15‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. Monk so-and-so wants to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself. He is requesting the Sangha to approve the site for the dwelling. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should approve the site for the dwelling of monk-so-and-so. This is the motion.

16Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. Monk so-and-so wants to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself. He is requesting the Sangha to approve the site for the dwelling. The Sangha approves the site for the dwelling of monk so-and-so. Any monk who agrees to approving the site for the dwelling of monk-so-and-so should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t agree should speak up.

17The Sangha has approved the site for the dwelling of monk so-and-so. The Sangha agrees and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’”


18**Where harm will be done:** it is the abode of ants, termites, rats, snakes, scorpions, centipedes, elephants, horses, lions, tigers, leopards, bears, or hyenas, or any other animal; or it is bordering on a field of grain, a field of vegetables, a place of slaughter, a place of execution, a charnel ground, a park, a royal property, an elephant stable, a horse stable, a prison, a bar, a slaughterhouse, a street, a crossroads, a public meeting hall, or a cul-de-sac—this is called “where harm will be done”.


19**Which lacks space on all sides:** it is not possible to go around it with a yoked cart, or to go all the way around it with a ladder—this is called “which lacks space on all sides”.

20**Where no harm will be done:** it is not the abode of ants … it is not bordering on … a cul-de-sac—this is called “where no harm will be done”.

21**Which has space on all sides:** it is possible to go around it with a yoked cart, or to go all the way around it with a ladder—this is called “which has space on all sides”.

22**A large dwelling:** one with a sponsoring owner is what is meant.

23**Dwelling:** plastered inside or plastered outside or plastered both inside and outside.

24**Builds:** building it himself or having it built.


25**Or he does not have monks approve the site:** if the site has not been approved through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements, and he then builds a dwelling or has one built, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct. When one piece is left to complete the dwelling, he commits a serious offense. When the last piece is finished, he commits an offense entailing suspension.

26**He commits an offense entailing suspension:** … Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”.

#### Permutations

#### Building oneself

27If a monk builds a dwelling whose site has not been approved, where harm will be done, and which lacks space on all sides, he commits one offense entailing suspension and two offenses of wrong conduct.

He tells them to build a dwelling whose site has been approved, where no harm will be done, and which has space on all sides, but they build a dwelling whose site has not been approved, where harm will be done, and which lacks space on all sides. If he hears about it, he must either go there himself or send a message, telling them to build a dwelling whose site has been approved, where no harm will be done, and which has space on all sides. … whose site has been approved and where no harm will be done. … whose site has been approved and which has space on all sides. … whose site has been approved. If he neither goes himself nor sends a message, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

44The training rule on building dwellings, the seventh, is finished.
