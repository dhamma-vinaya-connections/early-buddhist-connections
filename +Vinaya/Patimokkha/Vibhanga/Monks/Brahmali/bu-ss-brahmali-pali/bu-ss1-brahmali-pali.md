## Vinaya Piṭaka - Monastic Rules

## Bhikkhu Vibhaṅga - Saṅghādisesa 1: Masturbation
### B. Brahmali

- Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Brahmali.   

1Venerables, these thirteen rules involving a formal meeting of the order come up for recitation.

#### Origin

#### First sub-story


2At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time Venerable Seyyasaka was dissatisfied with the spiritual life. He became thin, haggard, and pale, with veins protruding all over his body. Venerable Udāyī saw him in this condition and said to him, “Seyyasaka, you’re not looking well. You’re not dissatisfied with the spiritual life, are you?”


“I am.”

“Well then, eat , sleep, and bathe as much as you like. And whenever you become discontent and lust overwhelms you, just masturbate with your hand.”

“But is that allowable?”

“Yes, I do it too.”


3Then Seyyasaka ate, slept, and bathed as much as he liked, and whenever he became discontent and lust overwhelmed him, he masturbated with his hand. After some time Seyyasaka had a good color, a bright face, clear skin, and sharp senses. The monks who were his friends said to him, “Seyyasaka, you used to be thin, haggard, and pale, with veins protruding all over your body. But now you have a good color, a bright face, clear skin, and sharp senses. Have you been taking medicine?”

“No. I just eat, sleep, and bathe as much as I like, and whenever I become discontent and lust overwhelms me, I masturbate with my hand.”

“Do you eat the food given in faith with the same hand you use to masturbate?”

“Yes.”


The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable Seyyasaka masturbate with his hand?”


4They rebuked Seyyasaka in many ways and then told the Buddha. The Buddha then had the Sangha gathered and questioned Seyyasaka: “Is it true, Seyyasaka, that you do this?”

“Yes, Sir.”


The Buddha rebuked him, “Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How can you do this? Haven’t I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion; for freedom from bondage, not for the sake of bondage; for the sake of non-grasping, not for the sake of grasping? When I’ve taught like this, how can you choose passion, bondage, and grasping? Haven’t I given many teachings for the fading away of lust, for the clearing away of intoxication, for the removal of thirst, for the uprooting of attachment, for the cutting off of the round of rebirth, for the stopping of craving, for fading away, for ending, for extinguishment? Haven’t I given many teachings for the abandoning of sensual pleasures, for the full understanding of the perceptions of sensual pleasure, for the removal of thirst for sensual pleasure, for the elimination of thoughts of sensual pleasure, for the stilling of the fevers of sensual pleasure? Foolish man, this will affect people’s confidence, and cause some to lose it.” Then, after rebuking Seyyasaka in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

5‘Intentional emission of semen is an offense entailing suspension.’”

6In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.

7Soon afterwards some monks ate fine foods, fell asleep absentminded and heedless, and emitted semen while dreaming. They became anxious, thinking, “The Buddha has laid down a training rule that intentional emission of semen is an offense entailing suspension. We had an emission while dreaming, which is not without intention. Could it be that we’ve committed an offense entailing suspension?” They told the Buddha. “It’s true, monks, that a dream is not without intention, but it’s negligible. And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

#### Final ruling

8‘Intentional emission of semen, except while dreaming, is an offense entailing suspension.’”

#### Definitions

9**Intentional:** knowing, perceiving, having intended, having decided, he transgresses.

10**Semen:** there are ten kinds of semen: blue, yellow, red, white, the color of buttermilk, the color of water, the color of oil, the color of milk, the color of curd, the color of ghee.

11**Emission:** making it move from its base—this is what is meant by “emission”.

12**Except while dreaming:** apart from that which occurs while dreaming.

13**An offense entailing suspension:** only the Sangha gives probation for that offense, sends back to the beginning, gives the trial period, and rehabilitates—not several monks, not an individual. Therefore it is called “an offense entailing suspension”. This is the name and designation of this class of offense. Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”.
