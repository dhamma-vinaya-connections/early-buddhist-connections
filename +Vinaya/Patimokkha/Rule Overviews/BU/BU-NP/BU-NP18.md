> > By accepting money,one is accepting all the cares, responsibilities, and dangers that come with its ownership. Relinquish to Sangha and not to be returned or benefit the offender, but used by Sangha through lay follower or thrown away by a selected bhikkhu . Whether the bhikkhu accepts gold or money for himself or for others is thus not an issue here. Anything that falls short of a command, though, would not fulfill this factor. It can be refuse either in thought, word, or deed. if the donor does not mention the name of the bhikkhu or the Community as custodians or recipients of the funds, the donations are not to be refused. Rather, they are to be left there and the steward told of what the donor said
