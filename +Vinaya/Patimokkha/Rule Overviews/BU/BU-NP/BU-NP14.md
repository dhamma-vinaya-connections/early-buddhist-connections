### 🌐Overview

| Rule in Pali  | Rule in English  |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| Navaṃ pana bhikkhunā santhataṃ kārāpetvā chabbassāni dhāretabbaṃ, orena ce channaṃ vassānaṃ taṃ santhataṃ vissajjetvā vā avissajjetvā vā aññaṃ navaṃ santhataṃ kārāpeyya aññatra bhikkhusammutiyā, nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ | By a bhikkhu who has had a new rug made, it is to be kept for six years [at least]. If within less than six years, having given up or not having given up that rug, he should have another new rug made, except with the authorisation of bhikkhus, [this is a case] involving relinquishing and confession |

> > 1) Object: a new felt blanket/rug for one's own use. 2) Effort: One makes it or has it made less than six years after one's last one was made, even though one has not been formally authorized by the bhikkhus to do so. 3) Result: One acquires the rug when it is finished

> > If he makes one after six years; if he makes one after more than six years; if he makes it or causes it to be made for another; if, acquiring what was made for another, he makes use of it; if he makes a canopy or a ground-covering or a screen-wall or a mattress or a squatting-mat6; if there is the agreement of the monks; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer

> > 
> > The authorization by the bhikkhus is best explained by noting that there is no exemption under this rule for a bhikkhu whose felt rug/blanket is snatched away, lost, or destroyed. If the Community are satisfied that he did not intentionally lose it, destroy it, or put it in a place where it might easily get stolen — can give him the authorization to get a new one made
