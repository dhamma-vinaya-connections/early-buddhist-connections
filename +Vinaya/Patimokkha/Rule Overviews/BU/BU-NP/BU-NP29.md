| Upavassaṁ kho pana kattikapuṇṇamaṁ yāni kho pana tāni āraññakāni senāsanāni sāsaṅkasammatāni sappaṭibhayāni tathārūpesu bhikkhu senāsanesu viharanto ākaṅkhamāno tiṇṇaṁ cīvarānaṁ aññataraṁ cīvaraṁ antaraghare nikkhipeyya, siyā ca tassa bhikkhuno kocideva paccayo tena cīvarena vippavāsāya. Chārattaparamaṁ tena bhikkhunā tena cīvarena vippavasitabbaṁ. Tato ce uttari vippavaseyya, aññatra bhikkhusammutiyā, nissaggiyaṁ pācittiyan | There are wilderness dwellings that are considered risky and dangerous. After observing the Kattika full moon that ends the rainy season, a monk who is staying in such a dwelling may, if he so desires, store one of his three robes in an inhabited area so long as he has a reason for staying apart from that robe. He should stay apart from that robe for six days at the most. If he stays apart from it longer than that, except if the monks have agreed, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession |

> > The reason for this rule, is When the bhikkhus were away from their robes, the robes “were lost, destroyed, burned, eaten by rats.” If kaṭhina privileges are still in effect, he has no need for the allowance under this rule because NP 2 is automatically rescinded as part of those privileges, The robe should then be given back to the offending monk, not to return it being a dukkata
