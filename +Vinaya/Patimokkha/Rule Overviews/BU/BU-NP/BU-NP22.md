### 🌐Overview

| Rule in Pali  | Rule in English  |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| Yo pana bhikkhu ūnapañcabandhanena pattena aññaṁ navaṁ pattaṁ cetāpeyya, nissaggiyaṁ pācittiyaṁ. Tena bhikkhunā so patto bhikkhuparisāya nissajjitabbo. Yo ca tassā bhikkhuparisāya pattapariyanto so tassa bhikkhuno padātabbo— ‘ayaṁ te, bhikkhu, patto yāva bhedanāya dhāretabbo’ti. Ayaṁ tattha sāmīcī | If a monk exchanges an almsbowl with fewer than five mends for a new almsbowl, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. That monk should relinquish that almsbowl to a gathering of monks. He should then be given the last almsbowl belonging to that gathering: “Monk, this bowl is yours. Keep it until it breaks.” This is the proper procedure |

> > Relinquish to Sangha according to procedure. this rule allows a bhikkhu whose bowl is beyond repair to ask for a new one. Community chooses one of its members as bowl exchanger. If the new bowl is preferable to one's own and yet one do not take it out of sympathy for the offender, is a dukkaṭa, but for contentment with what he has, no offense
