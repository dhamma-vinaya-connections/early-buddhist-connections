Let the venerable one accept the robefund!” [then] that messenger should be spoken to thus by that bhikkhu: “Friend, we do not accept a robe-fund, but we do accept a robe at the right time [when it is] allowable.” If that messenger should say thus to that bhikkhu: “Is there, perhaps, someone who provides services for the venerable one?” [then,] bhikkhus, by a bhikkhu who is in need of a robe, a service provider can be pointed out: a monastery attendant or a male layfollower [saying]: “Sir, this is the bhikkhus’ service provider.” If that messenger having instructed that service provider, having approached that bhikkhu, should say so: “Venerable Sir, the service provider whom the venerable one has pointed out hass been instructed by me. Let the venerable one approach [him] at the right time [and] he will clothe you with a robe,” [then] bhikkhus, having approached the service provider, [the service provider] can be prompted [and] can be reminded two or three times by the bhikkhu who is in need of a robe [saying]: “Friend, I am in need of a robe.” [If through] prompting [and] reminding [him] two or three times, he should have [him] bring forth that robe, it is good. If he should not have [him] bring [it] forth, [then] four times, five times, six times at the mosti [it] can be stood [for] by [a bhikkhu] who has become silent. [If through] standing silently for [it] four times, five times, six times at the mosti he should have [him] bring forth that robei it is good; if [through] making effort more than thati he should have [him] produce that robei [this is a case] involving relinquishment and confession. If he should not have [him] produce [it]i [then] from wherever the robe-fund may have been brought, there [he] himself can goi or a messenger can be sent [saying]: “Sirs, that robe-fund which you sent for the bhikkhu does not fulfil any need of that bhikkhu. Let the sirs endeavour for [what is their] own. Do not lose what is your own.” This is the proper procedure here |

> > The purpose of the protocols is to free bhikkhus from the even more bothersome worries and complexities that come with participating in buying, selling, and monetary matters in general. If a bhikkhu follows the protocols recommended here, the money placed with the steward still belongs to the donor, and the responsibility for making a fair trade lies with the steward. Important that he not abuse the steward's services. One may say only, "I need a robe (or whatever the requisite may be), Not "Give me a robe," "Get me a robe," "Buy me a robe. To apply the protocols where the steward is indicated by the bhikkhu, by the donor, or by neither . For Sangha an acceptable phrased "This is for the purpose of the four requisites," or "Accept whatever is allowable coming from this," without mentioning the Saṅgha or any bhikkhu. But not "I'm giving this to the Saṅgha," for whatever the purpose, the gift may not be accepted. For donation boxes "The donation box is over there," but not, "Put it there." If checking account is set up for impersonal purposes such as the construction and upkeep of monastery buildings, a bhikkhu may not sign a check drawing on the account. A fund has been set up for a particular requisite, it should as a general principle be used to buy only that requisite

I forfeit it to you.”
