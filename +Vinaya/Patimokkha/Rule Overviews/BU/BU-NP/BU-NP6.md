### 🌐Overview

| Rule in Pali  | Rule in English  |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| Yo pana bhikkhu aññātakaṃ gahapatiṃ vā gahapatāniṃ vā cīvaraṃ viññāpeyya aññatra samayā, nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ. tatthāyaṃ samayo, acchinnacīvaro vā hoti bhikkhu, naṭṭhacīvaro vā, ayaṃ tattha samayo | If any bhikkhu should request a robe [-cloth] from an unrelated male householder or female householder, except at the [right] occasion, [this is a case] involving giving up and confession. Here the occasion is this: he is a bhikkhu whose robe has been robbed or whose robe has been lost; this is the occasion here |

> > 1) Object: a piece of any of the six suitable kinds of robe-cloth, measuring at least four by eight fingerbreadths. 2) Effort: One asks, except at the proper time, for such cloth from a lay person who is not related back through one's great x 7 grandfathers. Even if one perceives the lay person to be related when in fact he/she isn't, that fulfills the factor here. 3) Result: One receives the cloth

> > If all of a bhikkhu's robes are snatched away or destroyed, should not approach other people while naked. he is permitted to take any cloth he finds there — robes, sheets, mats, pillow cases, or whatever — to wear as a makeshift robe as long as he has the intention of returning it when he obtains a proper robe

Imāhaṃ āyasmato nissajjāmi, which means, "This robe (robe-cloth) of mine, venerable sir, requested from an unrelated householder at other than the proper occasion, is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to you." For more than one robe: Imāni me bhante cīvarāni aññātakaṃ gahapatikaṃ aññatra samayā viññāpitāni nissaggiyāni. Imānāhaṃ āyasmato nissajjāmi
