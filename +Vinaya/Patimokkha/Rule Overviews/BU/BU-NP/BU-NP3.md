### 🌐Overview

| Niṭṭhitacīvarasmiṃ bhikkhunā ubbhatasmiṃ kathine bhikkhuno paneva akālacīvaraṃ uppajjeyya, ākaṅkhamānena bhikkhunā paṭiggahetabbaṃ, paṭiggahetvā khippameva kāretabbaṃ, no cassa pāripūri, māsaparamaṃ tena bhikkhunā taṃ cīvaraṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ ūnassa pāripūriyā satiyā paccāsāya. tato ce uttari nikkhipeyya satiyāpi paccāsāya, nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ | When the robe [-cloth] is finished by a bhikkhu, when the kaṭhina [- frame-privileges] have been withdrawn, if out-of-season robe [-cloth] should become available to a bhikkhu, by a bhikkhu who is wishing [so, it] can be accepted; having accepted [it, it] is to be made very quickly. If [the robe-cloth] should not be [enough for] the completion [of the robe], [then] for a month at the most that robe [-cloth] can be put aside by that bhikkhu for the completion of the deficiency [of robe-cloth], when there is an expectation [that he will get more robecloth]; if he should put [it] aside more than that, even when there is an expectation [that he will get more robe-cloth], [this is a case] involving abandoning with confession |

> > 1) Object: (a) out-of-season robe-cloth, made of any of the proper six kinds of material, in pieces measuring at least four by eight fingerbreadths; (b) the cloth is not enough to make the cloth requisite one has in mind, but one expects to receive more. 2) Effort: One keeps the cloth for more than 30 days, except when the kaṭhina privileges are in effect

> > Cloth accruing to a bhikkhu during the one-month or five-month robe season can count as out-of-season cloth if the donors dedicate it to that purpose, in order to extend the period it can be kept or visiting bhikkhus. If the second cloth turns out to be of different quality from the first, one is under no compulsion to put the two cloths together to make up the requisite if one does not want to. out-of-season cloth received shortly before the beginning of the robe season, the countdown would begin when it is received, would be suspended throughout the robe season, and would resume at the robe season's end
