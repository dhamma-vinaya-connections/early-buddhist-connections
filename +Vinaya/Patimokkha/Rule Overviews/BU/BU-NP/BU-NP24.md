> > Dukkata for bathing naked in the rain when one possesses a rains-cloth. Not offence if bathing naked in lake or rivers. Seeking starts 1st full moon in July, to give hints to people who have never provided rains-bathing cloths in the past, is dukkata. At the end of the vassa he is to wash his cloth, place it under shared ownership, and put it aside if it is still usable. Nowadays most bhikkhus—if they use a bathing cloth—tend to determine it for use as a “requisite cloth” so as to avoid any possible offense under this rule
