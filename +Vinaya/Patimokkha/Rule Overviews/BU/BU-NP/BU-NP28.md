Tato ce uttari nikkhipeyya, nissaggiyaṁ pācittiyan | When there are ten days left to the Kattika full moon that ends the first rainy-season residence and haste-cloth is given to a monk, he may receive it if he regards it as urgent. He may then store it until the end of the robe season. If he stores it beyond that, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession |
