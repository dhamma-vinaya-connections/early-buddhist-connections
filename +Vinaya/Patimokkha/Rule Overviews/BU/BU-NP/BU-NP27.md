| Bhikkhuṃ paneva uddissa aññātako gahapati vā gahapatānī vā tantavāyehi cīvaraṃ vāyāpeyya, tatra ce so bhikkhu pubbe appavārito tantavāye upasaṅkamitvā cīvare vikappaṃ āpajjeyya \"idaṃ kho, āvuso, cīvaraṃ maṃ uddissa viyyati, āyatañca karotha, vitthatañca, appitañca, suvītañca, suppavāyitañca, suvilekhitañca, suvitacchitañca karotha, appeva nāma mayampi āyasmantānaṃ kiñcimattaṃ anupadajjeyyāmā\"ti. evañca so bhikkhu vatvā kiñcimattaṃ anupadajjeyya antamaso piṇḍapātamattampi, nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ | ‘If a male or female householder is having robe-cloth woven by weavers for an unrelated monk and, without first being invited, that monk goes to those weavers and specifies the kind of robe-cloth he wants, saying, ‘This robe-cloth that you are weaving for me, make it long and wide; make it closely woven, well-woven, well-stretched, well-scraped, and well-combed, and perhaps I will even give you a small gift,’ then, in saying that and afterwards giving them a small gift, even a bit of almsfood, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession |

> > 1 Object: A piece of any of the six allowable types of robe-cloth, measuring at least four by eight fingerbreadths, which is being made for one’s sake by the arrangement of a donor who is unrelated and has not given an invitation to ask. 2 Effort: One approaches the weavers and gets them to improve the cloth in any of the seven ways mentioned in the rule. 3 Result: One obtains the cloth

> > If it belongs to relations; if they are invited; if it is for another; if it is by means of his own property; if desirous of having costly (robe-material) woven he has (robe-material) costing little woven; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer

> > Whether or not a gift is offered to the weaver, the offences under this rule are still the same. (Some have objected that it should be all right for the bhikkhu to pay in full for the improvements in the robe, but remember that to do so would be an insult to the donors.)
