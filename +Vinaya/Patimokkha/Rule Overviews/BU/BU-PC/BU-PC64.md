### 🌐Overview

| Rule in Pali  | Rule in English  |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| Yo pana bhikkhu bhikkhussa jānaṃ duṭṭhullaṃ āpattiṃ paṭicchādeyya, pācittiyaṃ | If a monk knowingly conceals a monk’s grave offense, he commits an offense entailing confession |

> > 1 Object: a serious offense (pārājika or a saṅghādisesa) committed by another bhikkhu. 2) Perception: One perceives the offense as serious. 3) Intention: One wants to hide the offense from other bhikkhus, to prevent a Community transaction against the offender or simply to protect him from the jeering remarks of other bhikkhus who may dislike him. 4) Effort: One sees a bhikkhu suitable to be informed of the matter but abandons one’s duty to report the offense

> > If one thinks that telling will lead to strife or a split in the Community; if, seeing that the bhikkhu who has committed the offense is violent by nature, one feels that he might create “dangers to life” or “dangers to the celibate life”; if one sees no suitable bhikkhu to tell; if one has no desire to hide the offense; or if one feels that the wrong-doer’s own behavior will betray him and thus there is no need to tell; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer

> > Another bhikkhu’s non-serious offenses are grounds for a dukkaṭa here, as are the misdeeds—serious or not—of an unordained person. Regardless of how many co-conspirators would end up trying to keep the original offense secret enough to prevent a formal inquiry into it, all of them would be guilty of the offense here
