| Yo pana bhikkhu bhikkhuniyā saddhiṃ saṃvidhāya ekaddhānamaggaṃ paṭipajjeyya antamaso gāmantarampi aññatra samayā, pācittiyaṃ. tatthāyaṃ samayo, satthagamanīyo hoti maggo, sāsaṅkasammato, sappaṭibhayo, ayaṃ tattha samayo | If a monk travels by arrangement with a nun, even just to the next village, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession. This is the appropriate occasion: the road is considered risky and dangerous and should be traveled with a group |
