> > If the bhikkhu and woman happen to travel together without having made an arrangement; if the woman proposes an arrangement, while the bhikkhu does not give his verbal assent; if either party leaves (or, apparently, both leave together) not as specified in the arrangement; if there are dangers; if he is mad

> > Private transport, though—such as automobiles, trucks and vans—is an area that different Communities treat in differing ways. Some treat it under Pc 44. This rule thus forbids a bhikkhu from traveling together with a woman, by prior arrangement, on the same public transport
