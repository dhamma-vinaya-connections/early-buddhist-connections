> > Regardless of whether the two parties in the dispute are confronting each other or one party is talking in private. even a single bhikkhu, involved in an argument with an unordained person, would be grounds for the full offense. People who are not involved in an argument are not grounds for an offense. At present, surreptitiously reading another person’s mail would seem to fulfill this factor as well
