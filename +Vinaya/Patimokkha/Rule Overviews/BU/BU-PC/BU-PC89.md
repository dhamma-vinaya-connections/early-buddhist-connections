| Nisīdanaṃ pana bhikkhunā kārayamānena pamāṇikaṃ kāretabbaṃ, tatridaṃ pamāṇaṃ, dīghaso dve vidatthiyo sugatavidatthiyā, tiriyaṃ diyaḍḍhaṃ, dasā vidatthi. taṃ atikkāmayato chedanakaṃ pācittiyaṃ | If a monk is having a sitting mat made, it should be made the right size. This is the right size: two standard handspans long and one-and-a-half wide, and a border of one handspan. If it exceeds that, it is to be cut down, and he commits an offense entailing confession |
