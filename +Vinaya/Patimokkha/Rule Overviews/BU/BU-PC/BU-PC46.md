| Yo pana bhikkhu nimantito sabhatto samāno santaṃ bhikkhuṃ anāpucchā purebhattaṃ vā pacchābhattaṃ vā kulesu cārittaṃ āpajjeyya aññatra samayā, pācittiyaṃ. tatthāyaṃ samayo, cīvaradānasamayo, cīvarakārasamayo, ayaṃ tattha samayo | If a monk who has been invited to a meal visits families beforehand or afterwards without informing an available monk, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession. These are the appropriate occasions: it is the robe-giving season; it is a time of making robes |

> > If at the right time, he enters having asked (for permission) if a monk be there; if he enters not having asked (for permission) if a monk be not there; if the way is through the house of another; or the precincts of a house; if he is going into a village; if he is going to the nuns’ quarters; if he is going to a sleeping-place of adherents of other sects; if he is returning from these places; if he is going to a house for food; if there are accidents; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer

> > The purpose is to prevent bhikkhus from taking the invitation as an excuse to visit lay people and spend their time in inappropriate activities. if one is without dependance (nissya) taking leave in the context of this rule means the simple act of informing the other bhikkhu not asking for permission
