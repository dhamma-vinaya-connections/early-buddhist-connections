### 🌐Overview

| Rule in Pali  | Rule in English  |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| Yo pana bhikkhu bhikkhuṃ bhuttāviṃ pavāritaṃ anatirittena khādanīyena vā bhojanīyena vā abhihaṭṭhuṃ pavāreyya \"handa bhikkhu khāda vā bhuñja vā\"ti jānaṃ āsādanāpekkho, bhuttasmiṃ pācittiyaṃ | If a monk invites a monk, whom he knows has finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more, to eat fresh or cooked food that is not left over, saying, “Here, monk, eat,” aiming to criticize him, then when the other has eaten, he commits an offense entailing confession |

> > 1 Object: staple or non-staple food that one perceives not to be leftover. 2) Effort: One gives the food to a bhikkhu who has eaten and turned down an offer of further food, as under the preceding rule. 3) Perception: One knows that he has eaten and turned down an offer of further food. 4) Intention: One wishes to find fault with him. 5) Result: He finishes a meal that includes that food. Only four of these factors—object, perception, intention, and result—require further explanation
