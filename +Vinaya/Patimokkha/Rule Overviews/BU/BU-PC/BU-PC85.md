> > The purpose of this rule is to prevent bhikkhus from passing their time among householders engaged in animal talk. Available bhikkhu is there are no obstacles to taking one’s leave from him (e.g., he is asleep, he is sick, he is busy) Taking leave means to informe no to ask permission. Except if one still in dependece need to ask permission to his teacher. If many bhikkhus are going together, they need only take leave from one another. A bhikkhu who enters a village frequently and engages in it, even if he takes leave of other bhikkhus, can be subject to an act of censure for “unbecoming association with householders”
