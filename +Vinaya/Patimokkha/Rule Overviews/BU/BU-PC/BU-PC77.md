> > If, not desiring to arouse remorse, he speaks, saying: ‘Surely you, (though) under twenty years of age, are ordained … surely you sit in a private place together with a woman; come now, find out (about it), do not let there come to be remorse for you afterwards;’ if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer
