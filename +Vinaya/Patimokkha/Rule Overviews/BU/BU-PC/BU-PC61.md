Even the desire to kill an animal to “put it out of its misery” fulfills the factor of intention all the same. no room for kappiya-vohāra there is a dukkaṭa for the first effort that touches the animal’s body; another dukkaṭa if the animal experiences pain because of one’s effort; and the full offense if, as a result, it dies
