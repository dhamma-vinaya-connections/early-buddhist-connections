Valid transaction that one perceives as valid: pācittiya; an invalid transaction that one perceives to be valid and a transaction that one is doubtful about, regardless of its actual validity: dukkaṭas; a transaction that one perceives to be invalid, regardless of its actual validity: grounds for no offense. 3) Effort: One complains about it
