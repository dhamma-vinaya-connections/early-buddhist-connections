> > 1) Object: a Community transaction that has been started but has yet to be finished, and is being carried out in a valid manner. 2) Perception: One perceives it as being carried out in a valid manner. Valid transaction that one perceives as valid: pācittiya; an invalid transaction that one perceives to be valid and a transaction that one is doubtful about, regardless of its actual validity: dukkaṭas; a transaction that one perceives to be invalid, regardless of its actual validity: grounds for no offense. 3) Intention: One wants to invalidate the transaction or to keep the group from carrying it out. 4) Effort: Without having first given one’s consent, one goes beyond hatthapāsa (1.25 m.) from the bhikkhus sitting in the meeting
