### 🌐Overview

| Rule in Pali  | Rule in English  |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| Vassikasāṭikaṃ pana bhikkhunā kārayamānena pamāṇikā kāretabbā, tatridaṃ pamāṇaṃ, dīghaso cha vidatthiyo sugatavidatthiyā, tiriyaṃ aḍḍhateyyā. taṃ atikkāmayato chedanakaṃ pācittiyaṃ | If a monk is having a rainy-season robe made, it should be made the right size. This is the right size: six standard handspans long and two-and-a-half wide. If it exceeds that, it is to be cut down, and he commits an offense entailing confession |
