The Buddha would never say such a thing. In many discourses the Buddha has declared the obstacles to be obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them.” If that novice monastic continues as before, he should be told: “From today on you may not refer to the Buddha as your teacher. And you can no longer share a sleeping place with the monks for two or three nights, as can other novice monastics. Go! Away with you!” If a monk befriends that novice monastic, or he is attended on by him, lives with him, or shares a sleeping place with him, even though he knows that he has been expelled in this way, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” |

> > 1) Object: a novice who has been expelled and has not relinquished his evil view. 2) Perception: One perceives that he has been expelled and has not relinquished his evil view—either from knowing on one’s own, from having been told by him (§), or from having been told by others. 3) Effort: One befriends him, receives services from him, communes with him, or lies down in the same dwelling with him

> > A novice comes to think that there is nothing wrong with any novice’s having sexual intercourse or breaking any of his other precepts. This form of expulsion lasts as long as he has yet to relinquish his view. If and when he does relinquish it, he is to be reinstated. As under the preceding rule, the Vibhaṅga states explicitly that the first not offence clause holds regardless of whether one’s perception is correct, and the same principle would seem to apply to the second one as well
