### 🌐Overview

| Rule in Pali  | Rule in English  |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| Yo pana bhikkhu bhikkhūhi sahadhammikaṃ vuccamāno evaṃ vadeyya \"na tāvāhaṃ, āvuso, etasmiṃ sikkhāpade sikkhissāmi, yāva na aññaṃ bhikkhuṃ byattaṃ vinayadharaṃ paripucchāmī\"ti, pācittiyaṃ. sikkhamānena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā aññātabbaṃ paripucchitabbaṃ paripañhitabbaṃ, ayaṃ tattha sāmīci | If a monk, when legitimately corrected by the monks, says, “I won’t practice this training rule until I’ve questioned a monk who is an expert on the Monastic Law,” he commits an offense entailing confession. A monk who is training should understand, should question, should enquire. This is the proper procedure |

> > 1) Object: One has been admonished by a fellow bhikkhu who cites a rule formulated in the Vinaya. 2) Intention: One does not want to train oneself in line with the rule. 3) Effort: As a ploy to excuse oneself, one says something to the effect that one will not train in line with the rule

> > To avoid an offense in situations like this is to say that one will learn about the rule and train in line with it. As the non-offense clauses to Pc 54 make clear, though, if one has been admonished with any interpretation of a rule that differs from one’s teachers’, one may avoid an offense simply by stating that one’s teachers taught differently

> > 
> > This rule deals with cases where a bhikkhu tries to excuse himself from following any of the training rules without showing out-and-out disrespect for the rule or the person admonishing him. (If he showed out-and-out disrespect, the case would come under Pc 54
