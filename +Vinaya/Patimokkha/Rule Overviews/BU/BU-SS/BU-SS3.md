> > 1) Object: a woman, i.e., any female human being experienced enough to know what is properly said and improperly said, what is lewd and not lewd. 2) Perception: The bhikkhu perceives her to be a woman. 3) Intention: He is impelled by lust: He wants to enjoy saying something lewd or improper. 4) Effort: He makes remarks praising, criticizing, begging, imploring, asking, quizzing, advising, instructing, or insulting with reference to her genitals or anus, or to her performing sexual intercourse. 5) Result: The woman immediately understands

> > A woman who does not know the language in which one is speaking would also not fulfill the factor of object here. Not necessarily having any desire actually to have sex with her. The Vibhaṅga makes clear that this rule does not cover statements or insults made in anger, they're cover in Pc 2. using slang expressions, euphemisms, or indirect statements fullfil this factor. If she understands only later, that does not turn the lesser offense into a saṅghādisesa
