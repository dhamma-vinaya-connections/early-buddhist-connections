### 🌐Overview

| Rule in Pali  | Rule in English  |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| Mahallakaṃ pana bhikkhunā vihāraṃ kārayamānena sassāmikaṃ attuddesaṃ bhikkhū abhinetabbā vatthudesanāya, tehi bhikkhūhi vatthu desetabbaṃ anārambhaṃ saparikkamanaṃ. sārambhe ce bhikkhu vatthusmiṃ aparikkamane mahallakaṃ vihāraṃ kāreyya, bhikkhū vā anabhineyya vatthudesanāya, saṅghādiseso | When a large dwelling (vihara) with a donor is being made by a bhikkhu and is intended for himself then bhikkhus should be invited in order to appoint a site and they should appoint a site which is not dangerous and has a clearing around it. If a bhikkhu should make a large dwelling on a site which is dangerous and without a clearing, or should not invite bhikkhus in order to appoint a site, it is a sanghadisesa offence |

> > If he finishes by himself what was imperfectly executed by himself, if it is (built) in a mountain-cave as a hut, as a hut of tiṇa-grass, for the good of another except it be as a house, there is no offence in any of these circumstances, nor if he is out of his mind or a beginner
