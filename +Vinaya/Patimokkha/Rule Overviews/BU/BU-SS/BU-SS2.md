> > This rule not because women are bad, but because bhikkhus sometimes can be. thullaccaya for making bodily contact with a paṇḍaka, a female yakkha, or a dead woman; and a dukkaṭa for bodily contact with a man (or boy), a wooden doll, or a male or female animal. a bhikkhu who caresses his mother, sister, daughter out of familiar affection is dukkata Even a momentary desire to enjoy the sensation of physical contact is enough. Lustful bodily contact with a male transvestite perceived to be a woman dukkaṭa. For concept of anāmāsa not based in the Canon. the Buddha never ask the bhikkhu if he made contact with the clothed or unclothed portions of the woman’s body. This suggests whether she was clothed or unclothed is irrelevant to the offense. In passive contact he either desire the contact or the desire to escape
