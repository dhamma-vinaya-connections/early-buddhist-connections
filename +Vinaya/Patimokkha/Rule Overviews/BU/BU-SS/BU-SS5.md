> > Includes helping to arrange not only marriages and affairs but also anything from appointments with a prostitute to arrangements for X to be Y’s date. Also if the bhikkhu gets someone else to act for him. Simply carrying a letter, not knowing its contents, would not fulfill the factor of effort. no offense for effect a reconciliation between an estranged couple who are not divorced, but a full offense for a couple who are divorce. Not involving any sort of romantic liaison—is also exempt from penalty as long as it is not a form of subservience to lay people Ss 13
