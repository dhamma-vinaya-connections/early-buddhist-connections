### 🌐Overview

| Rule in Pali  | Rule in English  |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| Yo pana bhikkhu bhikkhuṃ duṭṭho doso appatīto amūlakena pārājikena dhammena anuddhaṃseyya \"appeva nāma naṃ imamhā brahmacariyā cāveyya\"nti, tato aparena samayena samanuggāhīyamāno vā asamanuggāhīyamāno vā amūlakañceva taṃ adhikaraṇaṃ hoti, bhikkhu ca dosaṃ patiṭṭhāti, saṅghādiseso | Whatever bhikkhu being angry, vengeful, and displeased should groundlessly accuse another bhikkhu of committing a parajika offence thinking, \"Perhaps, this will cause him to fall from the life of a bhikkhu,\" and if after that at another time he is questioned or if he is not questioned and that accusation is found to be groundless and he admits his fault then he has committed a sanghadisesa offence |

> > 1) Object: The other bhikkhu is regarded as ordained. 2) Perception: One perceives him to be innocent of the offense one is charging him with. an accusation based on the assumption or suspicion that the accused is not innocent entails no offense. 3) Intention: One wants to see him expelled from the Saṅgha. 4) Effort: One makes an unfounded charge in his presence that he is guilty of a pārājika offense

> > If one understands the accused to be guilty of a pārājika and accuses him honestly on the basis of what one has seen, heard, or suspected, then — regardless of whether he is guilty or not — one has not committed an offense. Even in a case such as this, though, one incurs a dukkaṭa if making the charge without asking leave of the accused, and a pācittiya if making the charge so as to insult him, if he is mad, if he is a beginner

> > Qualified to admonish: One is pure in body and verbal conduct, One is motivated by good will, One is learned in the Dhamma and Pāṭimokkhas Speak at the right time, about what is factual speak gently and what is connected with the goal. If one is unqualified then one should find another bhikkhu who is qualified to handle the charge. When accused, one should keep: truth and staying unprovoked. if an accusation can't be settled informally, it should be taken to the Community. If a bhikkhu spreads gossip about another bhikkhu, should be asked tos taken up the matter with the accused or community
