### 🌐Overview

| Rule in Pali  | Rule in English  |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| Sañcetanikā sukkavissaṭṭhi aññatra supinantā saṅghādiseso | The intentional emission of semen except whilst dreaming is a sanghadisesa offence |

> > 
> > Full offense factors are result, intention, and effort: emission of semen caused by an intentional effort. Only Intention and effort— thullaccaya. Any single factor or any other combination of two factors—is not grounds for an offense

> > If he was dreaming or in a semi-conscious state before fully waking up from sleep, if there was no intentional emission, if he was mad, unhinged, in pain, a beginner

> > Semen falls from its base when it enters the urinary tract, because from that point on the process is irreversible. getting someone else to make the effort for one fulfills the factor of effort here. adding the extra factor that the physical effort has to involve one’s own penis—directly contradicts the Vibhaṅga so cannot stand. this rule is where one makes oneself emit semen, and not where one makes others emit. dukkaṭa for staring lustfully at a woman’s private parts. A bhikkhu who has an ejaculation while thinking sensual thoughts but without making any physical effort to cause it, incurs no penalty
