| Rule in Pali  | Rule in English  |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| Saññācikāya pana bhikkhunā kuṭiṃ kārayamānena assāmikaṃ attuddesaṃ pamāṇikā kāretabbā, tatridaṃ pamāṇaṃ, dīghaso dvādasa vidatthiyo sugatavidatthiyā, tiriyaṃ sattantarā, bhikkhū abhinetabbā vatthudesanāya, tehi bhikkhūhi vatthu desetabbaṃ anārambhaṃ saparikkamanaṃ. sārambhe ce bhikkhu vatthusmiṃ aparikkamane saññācikāya kuṭiṃ kāreyya, bhikkhū vā anabhineyya vatthudesanāya, pamāṇaṃ vā atikkāmeyya, saṅghādiseso | When a hut (kuti) is being made by a bhikkhu by his own asking, without a donor, and intended for himself then it should be made to the size limits. The size limits are twelve "sugata" spans in length (outside) and seven "sugata" spans across inside. Bhikkhus should be invited in order to appoint a site and they should appoint a site which is not dangerous and has a clearing around it. If a bhikkhu should make a hut by his own asking on a site which is dangerous and without a clearing, or should not invite bhikkhus in order to appoint a site, or should exceed the size limits, it is a sanghadisesa offence |

> > Dwellings might belong either to the Community or to an individual (or group of individuals). To dedicate something for one’s own use, is to claim ownership over it. This rule does not apply to a cave, or to a grass hut. Approximately 3 x 1.75 m. Free of disturbances is (1) not the abode of such creatures who might do harm to the building, or 2 the inhabitants. 3 not close to places that may disturb peace. Adequate space means that there is enough room on the site for a yoked wagon or a man carrying a ladder to go around. Suggest that there is no need to cut the trees down of the surrounding areas. All the Community or selected some members to go and inspect he bhikkhu returns to the Community and formally asks it to approve the site. The transaction statement involves a motion and one proclamation. Once this has passed, the bhikkhu may start construction. bhikkhu engaged in construction work should not be burdensome to the laity
