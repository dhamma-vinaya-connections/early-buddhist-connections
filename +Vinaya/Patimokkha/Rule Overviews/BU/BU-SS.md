Venerable Sirs, refrain from speaking to me." Then that bhikkhu should be spoken to by bhikkhus saying: "Venerable Sir, do not make yourself unable to be spoken to but make yourself able to be spoken to. Speak to bhikkhus according to Dhamma and they will speak to you according to Dhamma and thus the following of the Buddha will increase by speaking to each other and raising each other (from offence)." If while being spoken to by bhikkhus thus that bhikkhu persists with that behaviour then he should be admonished up to three times by bhikkhus in order to cause him to give up that behaviour. If while being admonished up to three times he gives up that behaviour then that is good, but if he does not give it up then it is a sanghadisesa offence |
