> > Only if the owner abandons all sense of ownership would it genuinely count as abandoned. A bhikkhu can commit an offense not only if he himself steals an object, but also if he incites another to steal. Group of bhikkhus steal valuables worth collectively more than five māsakas but which when divided among them yield shares worth less than five māsakas each, all incur a pārājika. A bhikkhu who takes things from the Community’s common stores, assuming he has the right to help himself, commits no offense even if the assumption proves false. A wise policy when one is in doubt about an item’s ownership would be not to take the item for one’s own, or at most to take it on loan. When a bhikkhu steals an item worth 1/24 troy ounce of gold or more, is full offense. When the item is of lesser value, there will be doubt—and when concerning a pārājika, the tradition of the Vinaya consistently gives the bhikkhu the benefit of the doubt. Special cases from commentaries: Smuggling: A bhikkhu carrying items subject to an import duty hides them as he goes through customs. Destruction of property False dealing: A bhikkhu makes counterfeit money or uses counterfeit weights. Shifting a boundary marker. About the concept of bhaṇḍadeyya, compensation, from commentary, the Canon does not allow a bhikkhu to ask his supporters for donations to pay to another lay person—except for his parents Mv 7.22 but The Community, if it sees fit, can force him to apologize to the owner Cv 1 20
