| Yo pana bhikkhu sañcicca manussaviggahaṃ jīvitā voropeyya, satthahārakaṃ vāssa pariyeseyya, maraṇavaṇṇaṃ vā saṃvaṇṇeyya, maraṇāya vā samādapeyya \"ambho purisa kiṃ tuyhiminā pāpakena dujjīvitena, mataṃ te jīvitā seyyo\"ti, iti cittamano cittasaṅkappo anekapariyāyena maraṇavaṇṇaṃ vā saṃvaṇṇeyya, maraṇāya vā samādapeyya, ayampi pārājiko hoti asaṃvāso | Whatever bhikkhu should intentionally take the life of a human being, or provide poison or a lethal weapon (for that purpose), or praise the benefits of dying or show a method in order to cause or enable a person to commit suicide saying, \"Sir, what is the use of living this miserable and painful life? Death would be better than living like this,\" or with this purpose and intention in mind should by any other way praise the benefits of dying or show a method in order to cause or enable a person to commit suicide, then that bhikkhu is one who has committed a parajika offence and one who is no longer permitted to remain in the bhikkhu sangha |

Perception - one perceives it as a living human being. 4. Effort - an action is done to bring about its death. 5. Result - the life faculty of that person is cut off

> > Who kills a “non-human being”—a yakkha, nāga, or peta—incurs a thullaccaya. if he were to strike a person unthinkingly in a sudden fit of rage, without being clear about what his intention was, it would not qualify as “intentional” here. bhikkhus, out of compassion for an ill friend, hasten his death incur the full offense. if one’s accomplice does not follow one’s instructions precisely, one is absolved of an offense. describing the advantages of dying might be delivered by gesture, by voice, by writing, or by means of a messenger. inaction does not fulfill the factor of effort here but actively assisting in a murder would. attempting suicide that do not endanger others, it seems better to follow the Buddha’s wisdom in not legislating about this issue at all,
