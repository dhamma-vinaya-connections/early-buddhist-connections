| Yo pana bhikkhu anabhijānaṃ uttarimanussadhammaṃ attupanāyikaṃ alamariyañāṇadassanaṃ samudācareyya \"iti jānāmi, iti passāmī\"ti, tato aparena samayena samanuggāhīyamāno vā asamanuggāhīyamāno vā āpanno visuddhāpekkho evaṃ vadeyya \"ajānamevaṃ āvuso avacaṃ jānāmi, apassaṃ passāmi, tucchaṃ musā vilapi\"nti, aññatra adhimānā, ayampi pārājiko hoti asaṃvāso | Whatever bhikkhu without having experienced the extraordinary knowledge and vision of jhana or enlightenment (magga and phala), which are beyond normal human experience, should claim to possess either of them saying, \"I know this, I see this,\"and if after that at another time he is ques-tioned or even if he is not questioned having committed this offence and desiring to become pure he should say, \"Venerable Sir, without having known this I said I know this, without having seen this I said I see this, what I said was a useless lie,\" unless it was because of overestimation then that bhikkhu is one who has committed a parajika offence and one who is no longer permitted to remain in the bhikkhu sangha |

> > 1. Object - a superior human state. 2. Perception - one perceives it as not present in oneself. 3. Effort - one addresses a human being, mentioning the state in connection with oneself. 4. Intention - with the intent to misrepresent the truth, motivated by an evil desire. 5. Result - the other person understands what is being said The commentaries add a fifth factor—result—saying that one’s listener must understand what one is saying but this factor appears to be based on a misreading of the Vibhaṅga

> > This is the ultimate great thief: he who claims an unfactual, non-existent superior human state. Statement explicitly mentions oneself, although the reference to the state may be either explicit or implicit full offense. A statement in which one mentions oneself—rather than the state—implicitly in connection with a superior human state is not grounds for a pārājika. motive is an essential part of the intention. evil desire is the wish to have others believe that skillful states not present within oneself are actually there. pārājika if the bhikkhu is aware of what he is saying, and a thullaccaya if not
