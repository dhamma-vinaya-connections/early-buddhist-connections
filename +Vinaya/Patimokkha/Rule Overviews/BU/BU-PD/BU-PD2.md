We acknowledge it |

> > This rule refers to situations where lay donors invite bhikkhus to a meal, and a bhikkhunī stands giving orders, based on favoritism, as to which bhikkhus should get which food. This rule is especially unique in that it depicts the violators as acknowledging their offense as a group. If even just one of them dismiss the bhikkhuni, they all are exempt from the offense here
