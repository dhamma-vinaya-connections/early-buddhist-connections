For whatever offence that trustworthy laywoman should make accusations, only according to what that bhikkhu admits to should he be caused to make amends. This is an offence which is uncertain (aniyata) |

To sit also includes lying down, A secluded seat is one behind a wall, a closed door, a large bush, or anything at all that would afford them enough privacy to engage in sexual intercourse. Female lay follower here means one who has taken refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha. Trustworthy means that she is at least a stream-winner
