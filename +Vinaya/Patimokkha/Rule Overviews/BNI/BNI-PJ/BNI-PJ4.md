Statement explicitly mentions oneself, although the reference to the state may be either explicit or implicit full offense. A statement in which one mentions oneself—rather than the state—implicitly in connection with a superior human state is not grounds for a pārājika. motive is an essential part of the intention. evil desire is the wish to have others believe that skillful states not present within oneself are actually there. pārājika if the bhikkhu is aware of what he is saying, and a thullaccaya if not
