> > A bhikkhu engaging in genital, oral, or anal intercourse is subject to this rule regardless if there is a covering, such as a condom, which role he plays, of whether he is actively or passively involved, and whether any of the parties involved reaches orgasm. intercourse as part of a tantric ritual incurs the full penalty, as well as If one puts up no struggle when assaulted and feels mental consent, even if only fleetingly during the act
