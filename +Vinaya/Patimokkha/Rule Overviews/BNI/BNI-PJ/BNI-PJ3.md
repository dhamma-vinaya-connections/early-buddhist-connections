### 🌐Overview

| Rule in Pali  | Rule in English  |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| Manussaviggaha: Yā pana bhikkhunī sañcicca manussaviggahaṃ jīvitā voropeyya, satthahārakaṃ vāssa pariyeseyya, maraṇavaṇṇaṃ vā saṃvaṇṇeyya... ayampi pārājikā hoti asaṃvāsā. | 3. Killing: Should any bhikkhunī intentionally deprive a human being of life, or search for an assassin for him, or praise the advantages of death... she is defeated and no longer in communion. |

Perception - one perceives it as a living human being. 4. Effort - an action is done to bring about its death. 5. Result - the life faculty of that person is cut off

> > Who kills a “non-human being”—a yakkha, nāga, or peta—incurs a thullaccaya. if he were to strike a person unthinkingly in a sudden fit of rage, without being clear about what his intention was, it would not qualify as “intentional” here. bhikkhus, out of compassion for an ill friend, hasten his death incur the full offense. if one’s accomplice does not follow one’s instructions precisely, one is absolved of an offense. describing the advantages of dying might be delivered by gesture, by voice, by writing, or by means of a messenger. inaction does not fulfill the factor of effort here but actively assisting in a murder would. attempting suicide that do not endanger others, it seems better to follow the Buddha’s wisdom in not legislating about this issue at all,
