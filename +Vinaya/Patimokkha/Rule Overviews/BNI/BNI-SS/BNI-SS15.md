> > This rule and the previos one are designed to prevent behavior in the bud before they can become schismatic. If the schismatic mentioned in the preceding rule begins to attract adherents, they are to be treated under this rule — and quickly, before the schismatic gains a fourth adherent because 1 One Community cannot impose a penalty on another Community (four or more bhikkhus) in any one transaction (Mv.IX.2). 2) Penalties of this sort may be imposed only with the unanimous agreement of all the bhikkhus present in the meeting
