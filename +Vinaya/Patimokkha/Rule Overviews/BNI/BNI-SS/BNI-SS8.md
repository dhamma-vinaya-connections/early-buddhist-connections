> > If one understands the accused to be guilty of a pārājika and accuses him honestly on the basis of what one has seen, heard, or suspected, then — regardless of whether he is guilty or not — one has not committed an offense. Even in a case such as this, though, one incurs a dukkaṭa if making the charge without asking leave of the accused, and a pācittiya if making the charge so as to insult him, if he is mad, if he is a beginner

If one is unqualified then one should find another bhikkhu who is qualified to handle the charge. When accused, one should keep: truth and staying unprovoked. if an accusation can't be settled informally, it should be taken to the Community. If a bhikkhu spreads gossip about another bhikkhu, should be asked tos taken up the matter with the accused or community
