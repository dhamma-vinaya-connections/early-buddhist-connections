> > Schism is a serious division in the Community. 5 criteria: 1) The Community is originally united, 2) at least nine bhikkhus. 3) dispute over any of eighteen grounds for a creating a schism, 4) at least four bhikkhus on either side, 5) the two sides conduct separate Pāṭimokkha recitations, Invitation ceremonies, or other Community transactions within the same territory. Once a bhikkhu has succeeded in binding together a group the Community will have trouble achieving unanimity in rebuking him. one's aim in expounding the Dhamma and Vinaya should never be to create a faction. the bhikkhus see or hear of a bhikkhu who has begun or persists in schism, it is their duty to reprimand him three time. 1 step going to him in person, 2 take him into the midst of a formal meeting of the Community, 3 recite a formal rebuke. the Buddha advises bhikkhus to abandon controversial behavior and to yield to the mandate of the Community even if it seems unjust
