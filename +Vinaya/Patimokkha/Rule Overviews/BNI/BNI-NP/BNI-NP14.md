> > 1 Object: any one of the robes that a bhikkhu has determined as his basic set of three. This rule thus does not apply to spare robes or other cloth requisites. 2 Effort: greeting dawnrise at a place outside of the zone in which any of one's robes are located, except when the exemptions mentioned in the rule are in effect

> > If before sunrise it is taken away, bestowed, lost, destroyed, burnt; if they tear it from him; if they take it on trust; if there is the agreement of the monks, if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer. when the kaṭhina privileges are in effect

> > Commentary's position is that in cases where the Vibhaṅga says that if the robes are kept in a certain area, one should either stay in that area or not more than a hatthapāsa away from the outside boundary of the area. If he thinks that he is in the same zone when he actually isn't, if he thinks the robe is not determined when it actually is, or if he means to be in the same zone when circumstances prevent him, he incurs the penalty all the same

> > Idaṁ me bhante cīvaraṁ ratti-vippavutthaṁ aññatra bhikkhu-sammatiyā nissaggiyaṁ. Imāhaṁ āyasmato nissajjāmi, which means, “This robe of mine, venerable sir, from which I dwelled apart for a night without authorization of the bhikkhus, is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to you.”
