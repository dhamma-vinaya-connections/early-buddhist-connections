This category includes finished requisites as well as simple pieces of cloth, but does not include robe-cloth belonging to the Community. 2) Effort: One keeps it for more than ten days (except during the allowed period) without determining it for use, placing it under shared ownership, abandoning it (giving or throwing it away); and without the cloth's being lost, destroyed, burnt, snatched away, or taken by someone else on trust within that time

> > The spirit of the rule makes it incumbent on each bhikkhu to keep his cloth requisites to a minimum. Mv 8 21.1 states that if a bhikkhu receives a piece of suitable cloth but does not yet plan to use it, he may place it under shared ownership (vikappana) until he has need for it. Counts as extra cloth if — it has not been or improperly determined for use or placed under shared ownership, or its determination or shared ownership has lapsed. shared ownership lapse if first owner takes the cloth on trust, or the second owner formally rescinds the shared ownership. To use an unforfeited item that deserves to be forfeited incurs a dukkaṭa. Robe season from first full moon in October and lasting 1 month Bu NP 1 & 3; Pc 32, 33, & 46 — are relaxed. Participating in Kaṭhina ceremony these privileges exend until full-moon day that ends the cold season in late February or early-to-mid March. bhikkhu who does not return the article being forfeited incurs a dukkaṭa
