> > Any transaction in which the end product is other than gold or money, i.e. buying as well as bartering the forfeited article should be returned to the original offender not to return the article would be a dukkata. No exemptions for a bhikkhu who trades using goods belonging to someone else. The Vibhaṅga makes no mention of what the bhikkhu may and may not do with the article after receiving it in return, but commentary have protocols. Present rule thus covers trades made only with not one’s co-religionists. bhikkhus should not bargain, if he sees that the steward is getting a bad deal, he may simply tell the steward, “Don’t take it Checks, credit cards, debit cards, and traveler’s checks do not count as gold or money. However, any trade arranged with them would come under this rule
