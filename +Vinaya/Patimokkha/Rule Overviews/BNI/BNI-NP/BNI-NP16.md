Even if one perceives the lay person to be related when in fact he/she isn't, that fulfills the factor here. 3) Result: One receives the cloth

Imāhaṃ āyasmato nissajjāmi, which means, "This robe (robe-cloth) of mine, venerable sir, requested from an unrelated householder at other than the proper occasion, is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to you." For more than one robe: Imāni me bhante cīvarāni aññātakaṃ gahapatikaṃ aññatra samayā viññāpitāni nissaggiyāni. Imānāhaṃ āyasmato nissajjāmi
