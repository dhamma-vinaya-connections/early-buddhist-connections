> > Relinquish to Sangha according to procedure. this rule allows a bhikkhu whose bowl is beyond repair to ask for a new one. Community chooses one of its members as bowl exchanger. If the new bowl is preferable to one's own and yet one do not take it out of sympathy for the offender, is a dukkaṭa, but for contentment with what he has, no offense
