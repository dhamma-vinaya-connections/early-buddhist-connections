> > 1) Object: another bhikkhu is grounds for the full offense here; anyone unordained, grounds for a dukkaṭa. 2) Effort: Raising the palm of one’s hand or raising any part of one’s body or anything attached to the body (a stick, a rock, a gun, a bow and arrow) in a threatening manner. 3) Intention: out of anger

> > Sub-commentary also notes that if an animal, for example, is making a mess and a bhikkhu raises his hand against it, this would be included under desiring freedom—i.e., from the mess—and so would not be an offense
