> > 1) Object: another bhikkhu is grounds for the full offense here; anyone unordained, grounds for a dukkaṭa. 2) Effort: One gives him a blow: with one’s own body, with something attached to the body or something that can be “thrown” 3) Intention: out of anger

> > If, being in some difficulty, he gives a blow desiring freedom; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer

> > “Result” is not a factor here. Whether the other person is hurt—or how badly he/she is hurt—does not affect the offense. In self-defense even if anger or displeasure arises in one’s mind in cases like this, there is no penalty
