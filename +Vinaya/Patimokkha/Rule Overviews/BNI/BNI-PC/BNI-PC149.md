> > 1) Object: One has been admonished by a fellow bhikkhu who cites a rule formulated in the Vinaya. 2) Intention: One does not want to train oneself in line with the rule. 3) Effort: As a ploy to excuse oneself, one says something to the effect that one will not train in line with the rule

> > To avoid an offense in situations like this is to say that one will learn about the rule and train in line with it.

> > This rule deals with cases where a bhikkhu tries to excuse himself from following any of the training rules without showing out-and-out disrespect for the rule or the person admonishing him. (If he showed out-and-out disrespect, the case would come under Pc 54
