> > 1) Object: a novice who has been expelled and has not relinquished his evil view. 2) Perception: One perceives that he has been expelled and has not relinquished his evil view—either from knowing on one’s own, from having been told by him (§), or from having been told by others. 3) Effort: One befriends him, receives services from him, communes with him, or lies down in the same dwelling with him

> > A novice comes to think that there is nothing wrong with any novice’s having sexual intercourse or breaking any of his other precepts. This form of expulsion lasts as long as he has yet to relinquish his view. If and when he does relinquish it, he is to be reinstated. As under the preceding rule, the Vibhaṅga states explicitly that the first not offence clause holds regardless of whether one’s perception is correct, and the same principle would seem to apply to the second one as well
