> > 1) Object: a rule in the Pāṭimokkha. 2) Intention: One wants to deceive the bhikkhus into believing that one is ignorant of the rule one has broken. 3) Effort: One has heard the Pāṭimokkha in full for at least three times, yet one persists in saying half-truths to feign ignorance after the bhikkhus have enacted a Community transaction exposing one’s deceit. (Out-and-out lies would come under Pc 1.)

> > This rule covers the use of a half-truth to feign ignorance of the rules at any time. No exceptions for bhikkhus whose native language is not Pali. Nevertheless, as the Pāṭimokkha is available in a number of translations, the grace period in which one is expected to be ignorant—three recitations covers at least a month to a month and a half—is not too short a time for a new bhikkhu to read and remember the rules in translation. If the transaction exposing one’s deceit has been properly carried out, then regardless of whether one perceives it as valid, one incurs a pācittiya for trying to deceive the bhikkhus any further. If it has been improperly carried out, one incurs a dukkaṭa for trying to deceive them further,

Āropito saṅghena Itthannāmassa bhikkhuno moho. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī. Evam-etaṁ dhārayāmi. Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me. This Bhikkhu (name), when the Pāṭimokkha is being recited, does not pay attention, properly taking it to heart. If the Community is ready, it should expose Bhikkhu (name)’s deceit. This is the motion. Bhikkhu (name)’s deceit has been exposed by the Community. This is agreeable to the Community, therefore it is silent. Thus do I hold it
