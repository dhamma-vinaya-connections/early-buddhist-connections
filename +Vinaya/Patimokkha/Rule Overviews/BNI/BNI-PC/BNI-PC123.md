> > If dismissing one’s companion with the thought that two bhikkhus going together won’t obtain enough food; dismissing him after seeing costly goods ahead, so that he won’t develop a feeling of greed; dismissing him after seeing a beautiful woman ahead, so that he won’t lose his resolve for the celibate life; sending him back with food for one who is sick, who was left behind, or who is guarding the monastery; or dismissing him for any other proper reason as long as one is not planning to indulge in misconduct; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer
