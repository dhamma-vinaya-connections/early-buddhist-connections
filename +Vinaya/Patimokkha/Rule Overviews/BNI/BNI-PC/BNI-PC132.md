> > Alcohol is criticized for it destroys one’s sense of shame, weakens one’s discernment, and can put one into a stupor, so it seems reasonable to extend this rule to other intoxicants, narcotics, and hallucinogens with these effects as well. Coffee, tea, tobacco, and betel do not have this effect, though
