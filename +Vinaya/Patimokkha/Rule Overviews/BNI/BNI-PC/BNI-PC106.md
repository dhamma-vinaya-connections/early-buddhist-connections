> > 1 Object. The Pali word for soil, paṭhavī, also means ground or earth. 2 Effort. The Vibhaṅga says that the term digging also covers burning, 3 Perception. If one perceives a patch of genuine soil not to be genuine soil, it is not grounds for an offense. If one is in doubt as to whether a patch of earth is classed as genuine soil, it is grounds for a dukkaṭa regardless of whether it is actually classed as genuine soil or not. 4 Intention to make a hole in the ground

> > Kappiya-vohāra—“allowable expression,” or “wording it right” use in the context of rules where an express command would be an offense, but an indication of a desire or intent would not. This rule, together with the following one, also effectively prevents bhikkhus from engaging in agriculture
