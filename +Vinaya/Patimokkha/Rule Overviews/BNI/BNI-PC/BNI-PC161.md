> > If, within a monastery or a dwelling, one picks up a valuable or what is considered a valuable—or if one has it picked up—with the thought, “Whoever this belongs to will come for it.”; no matter where it is found if one takes it on trust, borrows it, or perceives it as having been thrown away

> > The general purpose of this rule is to prevent a bhikkhu from picking up misplaced valuables belonging to other people, for as the origin story shows, there are dangers inherent in such an act even when done with the best intentions. if a bhikkhu has picked up a fallen valuable in the monastery he should take note of its features and ask about them to whom claim it
