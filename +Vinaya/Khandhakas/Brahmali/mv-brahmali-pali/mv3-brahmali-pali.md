1At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. At that time the Buddha had not yet laid down the rainy-season residence for the monks. And so the monks were wandering about in the winter, in the summer, and also during the rainy season.

People complained and criticized them: “How can the Sakyan monastics go wandering in the winter, in the summer, and even during the rainy season? They’re trampling down the green grass, oppressing one-sensed life, and destroying many small creatures. Even the monastics of other religions, with their flawed teachings, settle down for the rainy-season. Even birds make a nest in the top of a tree and settle down for the rainy-season. But not so the Sakyan monastics.”

2The monks heard the complaints of those people and told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“You should enter the rainy-season residence.”


The monks thought: “When should we enter the rains residence?” They told the Buddha.

“You should enter the rainy-season residence during the rainy season.”

3The monks thought: “How many entries to the rains residence are there?”

“There are two entries to the rainy-season residence: the first and the second. The first should be entered on the day after the full moon of July and the second one month after the same full moon.”

#### 2. The prohibition against wandering during the rainy season, etc. ^2

4Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six entered the rains residence and then went wandering during the rainy season. People complained and criticized them just as they had before.


5The monks heard the complaints of those people and the monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How could the monks from the group of six enter the rains residence and then go wandering during the rainy season?” And they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“After entering the rainy-season residence, you should stay put for the first or the second three-month period before you go wandering. If you go wandering during the rainy-season residence period, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”


6The monks from the group of six did not want to enter the rains residence.

“You should enter the rainy-season residence. If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”


7On the day of the entry to the rains residence, the monks from the group of six deliberately bypassed a monastery because they did not want to enter the rains residence.

“On the day of the entry to the rainy-season residence, you shouldn’t deliberately bypass a monastery because you don’t want to enter the rainy-season residence. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

8At one time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha wanted to postpone the rains residence. He sent a message to the monks: “Would the venerables please enter the rains residence at the next full moon?” They told the Buddha.

“You should comply with the wishes of kings.”

#### 3. The allowance for seven-day business ^3

9When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī. When he eventually arrived, he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.

At that time the lay follower Udena had had a dwelling built for the Saṅgha in the Kosalan country. He sent a message to the monks: “Please come, Venerables, I wish to make an offering, hear the Teaching, and see the monks.”

The monks replied: “The Buddha has laid down a rule that a monk who’s entered the rains residence shouldn’t go wandering until after the rains. Please wait, Udena. Once we’ve completed the rains residence, we’ll come. But if the matter is urgent, then give the dwelling in the presence of the local monks.”

Udena complained and criticized them: “How can the venerables not come when I’ve sent them a message? I’m a donor and I provide services. I’m a supporter of the Saṅgha!”


10The monks heard his complaints and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“If any of seven kinds of persons—a monk, a nun, a trainee nun, a novice monk, a novice nun, a male lay follower, or a female lay follower—asks you to come, I allow you to go for seven days, but only if you’re asked. And you should return within seven days.


11It may happen, monks, that a male lay follower has had a dwelling built for the Saṅgha and sends a message to the monks: ‘Please come, Venerables, I wish to make an offering, hear the Teaching, and see the monks.’ You should go for seven days, but only if you’re asked.

And you should return within seven days.

99At one time the Saṅgha at Sāvatthī had made an agreement that they would not give the going forth during the rains residence. Then, one of Visākhā’s grandsons went to the monks and asked for the going forth. The monks told him about their agreement, adding: “Please wait while the monks observe the rains residence. Once we’ve completed the rains residence, we’ll give you the going forth.”

100When they had completed the rains residence, the monks told Visākhā’s grandson that they would give him the going forth. He replied: “If I had been given the going forth, Venerables, I would have enjoyed it. But now I won’t do it.” Visākhā complained and criticized those monks: “How could the venerables make an agreement that they wouldn’t give the going forth during the rains residence? Is there a time when the Teaching shouldn’t be practiced?”

The monks heard Visākhā’s complaints and told the Buddha.

“You shouldn’t make an agreement that you won’t give the going forth during the rains residence. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

101On one occasion Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had agreed to spend the first rains residence at the invitation of King Pasenadi of Kosala. As he was going to the monastery provided by the King, he saw two monasteries with much robe-cloth. He thought: “Why don’t I spend the rains residence in these two monasteries? That way I’ll get much robe-cloth.” And he spent the rains residence in those two monasteries.

King Pasenadi complained and criticized him: “How could Upananda agree to spend the rains residence in my monastery, but then break his word? Hasn’t the Buddha in many ways criticized lying and praised truthfulness?”


102The monks heard the King’s complaints, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda: “How could Upananda act like this?” And they told the Buddha.

Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned Upananda: “Is it true that you acted like this?”


“It’s true, Sir.”

The Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you agree to spend the rains residence at the invitation of King Pasenadi, but then break your word? Haven’t I criticized lying in many ways and praised truthfulness? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking him … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
