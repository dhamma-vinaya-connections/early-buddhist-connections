1At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time thirty monks from Pāvā—all wilderness-dwellers, almsfood eaters, rag-robe wearers, and three-robe owners—were traveling to Sāvatthī to visit the Buddha. Because the entry to the rainy-season residence was approaching, they were unable to reach Sāvatthī, and they entered the rains residence at Sāketa while still on their way. They spent the rains residence discontented, thinking: “The Buddha is only 80 kilometers away, yet we don’t get to see him.”

When they had completed the rainy-season residence and done the invitation ceremony at the end of the three months, it was raining, with water and mud everywhere. As they traveled to Sāvatthī, they were exhausted, their robes soaked. When they arrived at Sāvatthī, they went to Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, bowed to the Buddha, and sat down.


Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks the Buddha said to them:


2“I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re getting by. I hope you had a comfortable rains, that you lived together in peace and harmony, and got almsfood without trouble?”

“We’re keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re getting by. We had a comfortable rains, lived together in peace and harmony, and had no trouble getting almsfood.” They told the Buddha what had happened during the rains and while traveling to Sāvatthī.


3Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“I allow monks who have completed the rainy-season residence to participate in a robe-making ceremony. Once you have participated in the robe-making ceremony, five things are allowable for you: Going without informing, going without taking, eating in a group, as much robe-cloth as you need, and whatever robe-cloth is given there is for you.

And the robe-making ceremony should be performed like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

4‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. This cloth has been given to the Saṅgha for the robe-making ceremony. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should give this cloth to monk so-and-so to perform the robe-making ceremony. This is the motion.

5Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. This cloth has been given to the Saṅgha for the robe-making ceremony. The Saṅgha gives this cloth to monk so-and-so to perform the robe-making ceremony. Any monk who approves of giving this cloth to monk so-and-so to perform the robe-making ceremony should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.

6The Saṅgha has given this cloth to monk so-and-so to perform the robe-making ceremony. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’


7“And, monks, how has the robe-making ceremony not been performed? The robe-making ceremony hasn’t been performed merely by marking the cloth, merely by washing the cloth, merely by planning the robe, merely by cutting the cloth, merely by tacking the cloth, merely by sewing a hem, merely by marking with a strip of cloth, merely by strengthening, merely by adding a border lengthwise, merely by adding a border crosswise, merely by adding a patch, merely by partial dyeing; nor has it been performed if a monk has made an indication, if a monk has given a hint, if the robe-cloth has been borrowed, if it has been stored, if it is to be relinquished, if it hasn’t been marked, if it’s not an outer robe or an upper robe or a sarong; nor has it been performed if the robe hasn’t been made on that very day with five or more cut sections with panels, if the robe-making ceremony isn’t performed by an individual, or if the robe-making ceremony has been performed correctly but the appreciation for the ceremony is expressed outside the monastery zone. In this way the robe-making ceremony hasn’t been performed.

8And how has the robe-making ceremony been performed? The robe-making ceremony has been performed if the cloth is brand new, if it’s nearly new, if it’s old, if it’s a rag, if it’s from a shop; it has been performed if a monk hasn’t given a sign, if a monk hasn’t given a hint, if the robe-cloth hasn’t been borrowed, if it hasn’t been stored, if it’s not to be relinquished, if it has been marked, if it’s an outer robe or an upper robe or a sarong; it has been performed if the robe has been made on that very day with five or more cut sections with panels, if the robe-making ceremony is performed by an individual, and if the robe-making ceremony has been performed correctly and the appreciation for the ceremony is expressed inside the monastery zone. In this way the robe-making ceremony has been performed.

9And how does the robe season come to an end? There are these eight key phrases for when the robe season comes to an end: when he departs from the monastery, when the robe is finished, when he makes a decision, when the robe-cloth is lost, when he hears about the end of the robe season, when an expectation of more robe-cloth is disappointed, when he is outside the monastery zone, ending together.”

137“Monks, there are two obstacles for the ending of the robe season: the monastery obstacle and the robe obstacle. What’s the monastery obstacle? A monk stays in that monastery or he leaves intending to return. What’s the robe obstacle? A monk hasn’t made a robe, or he hasn’t finished it, or he’s expecting more robe-cloth.

138There are two removals of obstacles for the ending of the robe season: the removal of the monastery obstacle and the removal of the robe obstacle. What’s the removal of the monastery obstacle? A monk leaves that monastery without intending to return. What’s the removal of the robe obstacle? A monk has made a robe; or the robe-cloth is lost, destroyed, or burnt; or his expectation of more robe-cloth is disappointed.”

139The seventh chapter on the robe-making ceremony is finished.


140This is the summary:

141“Thirty monks from Pāva,  
Stayed discontented in Sāketa;  
Completed the rains, with soaked,  
Went to see the Victor.

142This is the basis for the robe-making ceremony,  
And five things are allowable;  
Without informing, going without taking,  
Just so eating in a group.

143And as much as you need, the given,  
Is for those who have done the robe-making ceremony;  
Motion, just thus performed,  
Just thus not performed.

144Marking, and just washing,  
And planning, cutting;  
Tacking, hem, strip of cloth,  
Strengthening, border lengthwise.

145Border crosswise, patch,  
Dyeing, indication, hint;  
Borrowed, stored, to be relinquished,  
Not marked, apart from those three.

146Apart from five or more,  
With cut sections with panels;  
Not apart from an individual, correctly,  
He appreciates outside the monastery zone.


147The robe-making ceremony is not performed,  
Thus it was taught by the Buddha;  
Brand new, nearly new, old,  
Rag, and from a shop.

148Without indication, without hint,  
And not borrowed, not stored;  
Not to be relinquished, marked,  
And so with the three robes.

149Five or more,  
Cut sections made with panels;  
Performed by an individual, correctly,  
He appreciates within the monastery zone.

150In this way is the robe-making ceremony performed,  
Eight key phrases for ending;  
Departing, finished,  
And decision, lost.

151Hearing, disappointed expectation,  
Monastery zone, ending together as the eighth;  
Takes a finished robe,  
He goes, thinking: “I won’t return.”

152So, for him the robe season comes to an end,  
When he departs;  
He goes taking robe-cloth,  
Outside the monastery zone he thinks:

153“I’ll make it. I won’t return.”  
For him the robe season comes to an end when it’s finished;  
Takes outside the monastery zone, thinking: “Just not,  
And I won’t return.”

154So, for him the robe season comes to an end,  
When he decides;  
He goes taking robe-cloth,  
Outside the monastery zone he thinks:


155“I’ll make it. I won’t return.”  
While making it, it is lost;  
So, for him the robe season comes to an end,  
When it is lost.

156Taking it, he goes, thinking: “I’ll return”,  
He has a robe made outside;  
When his robe is finished, he hears,  
There the robe season has ended.

157So, for him the robe season comes to an end,  
When he hears about it;  
Taking it, he goes, thinking: “I’ll return”,  
He has a robe made outside.

158When the robe is finished, outside,  
He remains until the robe season comes to an end;  
So, for him the robe season comes to an end,  
When he is outside the monastery zone.

159Taking it, he goes, thinking: “I’ll return”,  
He has a robe made outside;  
When the robe is finished, thinking: “I’ll return”,  
The robe season comes to an end together with.

160So, for him the robe season comes to an end,  
Together with the monks;  
And takes, with,  
Seven with sevenfold outcome.

161There is no ending by departing,  
The outcome in the unfinished set of six;  
Takes, outside the monastery zone,  
“I’ll make”, he produces.

162Finished, and decision,  
Lost, these three;  
Taking it, he goes, thinking: “I won’t return”,  
“I’ll make outside the monastery zone”.

163Finished, also decision,  
Also lost, these three;  
Not decided, he does not think,  
Below is the threefold method.

164Taking it, he goes, thinking: “I’ll return”,  
When outside the monastery zone, thinking: “I’ll make”;  
“I’ll not return”, he has it made,  
The robe season comes to an end when the robe is finished.

165Decision, and lost,  
Hearing, outside the monastery zone;  
Together with the monks,  
Thus is the outcome of the fifteen.

166With, unfinished,  
Thus again with;  
These four section,  
Are all fifteenfold.

167And not as expected, as expected,  
And business those three;  
By this method one should here understand,  
Three, twelve, twelve.

168Here the nine on without taking,  
Fivefold on good meditation there;  
Obstacles, removal of obstacles,  
The summary is made from this method.”


169In this chapter there are one hundred and eighteen topics by means of groups of twelve with repetition.

170The chapter on the robe-making ceremony is finished.
