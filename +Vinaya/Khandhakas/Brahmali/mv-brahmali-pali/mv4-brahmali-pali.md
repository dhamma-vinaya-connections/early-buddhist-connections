1At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country a number of monks who were friends had entered rainy-season residence together. They thought: “How can we have a comfortable rains, live in peace and harmony, and get almsfood without trouble?”

Then it occurred to them: “Let’s not talk to one another. Whoever returns first from alms round in the village should prepare the seats, and set out a foot stool, a foot scraper, and water for washing the feet. He should wash the bowl for leftovers and put it out, and set out water for drinking and water for washing.

Whoever returns last from alms round may eat whatever is leftover, or he should discard it where there are no cultivated plants or in water without life. He should put away the seats and also the foot stool, the foot scraper, and the water for washing the feet. He should wash the bowl for leftovers and put it away, put away the water for drinking and the water for washing, and sweep the dining hall.

Whoever sees that the pot for drinking water, the pot for washing water, or the water pot in the restroom is empty should fill it. If he can’t do it by himself, he should call someone over by hand signal, and they should fill it together. He should not speak because of that. In this way we’ll have a comfortable rains, live in peace and harmony, and get almsfood without trouble.”


2And they did just that.


3Now it was the custom for monks who had completed the rainy-season residence to go and see the Buddha. And so, when the three months were over and they had completed the rains residence, they put their dwellings in order, took their bowls and robes, and set out for Sāvatthī. When they eventually arrived, they went to the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. There they approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.

Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, the Buddha said to them: “I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re getting by. I hope you had a comfortable and harmonious rains, and got almsfood without trouble.”

“We’re keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re getting by. We had a comfortable and harmonious rains, and got almsfood without trouble.”


When Buddhas know what is going on, sometimes they ask and sometimes not. They know the right time to ask and when not to ask. Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, otherwise not, for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial. Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule.

So the Buddha said to those monks: “In what way, monks, did you have a harmonious and comfortable rains? And how did you get almsfood without trouble?”


4When they had told him, the Buddha addressed the monks:


5“While being uncomfortable, these foolish men claim they were living in comfort. While living together like animals, they claim they were living in comfort. While living together like sheep, they claim they were living in comfort. While living together like enemies, they claim they were living in comfort.

How could these foolish men take a vow of silence, like the monastics of other religions? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them and giving a teaching, he addressed the monks:


“You should not take a vow of silence, like the monastics of other religions. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.

When you have completed the rainy-season residence, you should invite the monks to correct you in regard to three things: what has been seen, heard, and suspected.


This will help you live with one another in the proper way, help you clear yourself of offenses, and help you prioritize the training.

And you should do the invitation ceremony like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

6‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. Today is the invitation ceremony. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, it should do the invitation ceremony.’


7The most senior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:

‘I invite the Saṅgha to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends. For the second time, I invite the Saṅgha to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends. For the third time, I invite the Saṅgha to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends.’


8Each junior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:

‘I invite the Saṅgha to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends. For the second time I invite the Saṅgha to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends. For the third time I invite the Saṅgha to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends.’”


9Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six remained seated while the senior monks were inviting correction, squatting on their heels. The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks from the group of six act like this?” They told the Buddha. …

“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six were acting like this?”

“It’s true, Sir.” The Buddha rebuked them …

“How can those foolish men act like this?” This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


“You should not remain seated while the senior monks are inviting correction, squatting on their heels. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.

Everyone should squat on their heels during the invitation ceremony.”


10On one occasion, while squatting on his heels and waiting for everyone to finish, a senior monk who was weak from old age fainted and fell over. They told the Buddha.

“You should squat on your heels until you have invited correction. Once you have invited, you may sit down.”

11The monks thought: “How many invitation days are there?”

“There are two invitation days: the fourteenth and the fifteenth day of the lunar half-month.”

12The monks thought: “How many kinds of invitation procedure are there?”


“There are four kinds:

- The invitation procedure that is illegitimate and has an incomplete assembly.
- The invitation procedure that is illegitimate but has a complete assembly.
- The invitation procedure that is legitimate but has an incomplete assembly.
- The invitation procedure that is legitimate and has a complete assembly.

The first, second, and third of these should not be done; I haven’t allowed such procedures. The fourth should be done; I have allowed such a procedure. Therefore, monks, you should train like this: ‘We will do invitation procedures that are legitimate and have a complete assembly.’”

#### 3. The allowance to pass on the invitation ^3

13The Buddha addressed the monks: “Gather, monks, for the Saṅgha to do the invitation ceremony.” A monk said to the Buddha: “There’s a sick monk, Venerable Sir. He hasn’t come.”

“I allow a sick monk to pass on his invitation.


And he should pass it on like this. The sick monk should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, and squat on his heels. He should then raise his joined palms and say, ‘I pass on my invitation; please convey my invitation; please announce my invitation; please invite correction on my behalf.’ If he makes this understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then the invitation has been passed on. If he doesn’t make this understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then the invitation hasn’t been passed on.

If he’s able to do this, it’s good. If not, then the sick monk should be brought into the midst of the Saṅgha together with his bed or bench. They can then do the invitation ceremony. But if the one who is nursing him says, ‘If we move him, his illness will get worse, or he’ll die,’ then the sick monk shouldn’t be moved. The Saṅgha should go to where the sick monk is and do the invitation ceremony there.

You should not do the invitation ceremony with an incomplete Saṅgha. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.


14“If, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation goes away right then and there, then the invitation should be passed on to someone else. If, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation disrobes right then and there, dies right then and there, admits right then and there that he’s a novice monk, admits right then and there that he’s renounced the training, admits right then and there that he’s committed the worst kind of offense, admits right then and there that he’s insane, admits right then and there that he’s deranged, admits right then and there that he’s overwhelmed by pain, admits right then and there that he’s been ejected for not recognizing an offense, admits right then and there that he’s been ejected for not making amends for an offense, admits right then and there that he’s been ejected for not giving up a bad view, admits right then and there that he’s a _paṇḍaka_, admits right then and there that he’s living in the community by theft, admits right then and there that he’s previously left to join the monastics of another religion, admits right then and there that he’s an animal, admits right then and there that he’s a matricide, admits right then and there that he’s a patricide, admits right then and there that he’s a murderer of a perfected one, admits right then and there that he’s raped a nun, admits right then and there that he’s caused a schism in the Saṅgha, admits right then and there that he’s caused the Buddha to bleed, or admits right then and there that he’s a hermaphrodite, then the invitation should be passed on to someone else.

15If, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation goes away while on his way to the invitation ceremony, then the invitation hasn’t been brought. If, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation disrobes, dies, admits that he’s a novice monk, admits that he’s renounced the training, admits that he’s committed the worst kind of offense, admits that he’s insane, admits that he’s deranged, admits that he’s overwhelmed by pain, admits that he’s been ejected for not recognizing an offense, admits that he’s been ejected for not making amends for an offense, admits that he’s been ejected for not giving up a bad view, admits that he’s a _paṇḍaka_, admits that he’s living in the community by theft, admits that he’s previously left to join the monastics of another religion, admits that he’s an animal, admits that he’s a matricide, admits that he’s a patricide, admits that he’s a murderer of a perfected one, admits that he’s raped a nun, admits that he’s caused a schism in the Saṅgha, admits that he’s caused the Buddha to bleed, or admits that he’s a hermaphrodite while on his way to the invitation ceremony, then the invitation hasn’t been brought.


16But if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation goes away after reaching the Saṅgha, then the invitation has been brought.

And if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation disrobes, dies, admits that he’s a novice monk, admits that he’s renounced the training, admits that he’s committed the worst kind of offense, admits that he’s insane, admits that he’s deranged, admits that he’s overwhelmed by pain, admits that he’s been ejected for not recognizing an offense, admits that he’s been ejected for not making amends for an offense, admits that he’s been ejected for not giving up a bad view, admits that he’s a _paṇḍaka_, admits that he’s living in the community by theft, admits that he’s previously left to join the monastics of another religion, admits that he’s an animal, admits that he’s a matricide, admits that he’s a patricide, admits that he’s a murderer of a perfected one, admits that he’s raped a nun, admits that he’s caused a schism in the Saṅgha, admits that he’s caused the Buddha to bleed, or admits that he’s a hermaphrodite after reaching the Saṅgha, then the invitation has been brought.


17And if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation reaches the Saṅgha, but doesn’t announce the invitation because he falls asleep, then the invitation has been brought. There’s no offense for the one who is conveying the invitation. And if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation reaches the Saṅgha, but doesn’t announce the invitation because he is heedless or because he gains a meditation attainment, then the invitation has been brought. There’s no offense for the one who is conveying the invitation.

18And if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation reaches the Saṅgha, but deliberately doesn’t announce the invitation, then the invitation has been brought.

But there’s an offense of wrong conduct for the one who is conveying the invitation.

On the invitation day, if the Saṅgha has business to be done, then anyone passing on their invitation should also give their consent.”

19At one time on the invitation day a certain monk was seized by his relatives. They told the Buddha.

“If a monk is seized by his relatives on the invitation day, other monks should say to those relatives, ‘Please release this monk for a short time so that he can take part in the invitation ceremony.’ If they’re able to do this, it’s good. If not, they should say to those relatives, ‘Please step aside for a moment while this monk passes on his invitation.’ If they’re able to do this, it’s good. If not, they should say to those relatives, ‘Please take this monk outside the monastery zone for a short time while the Saṅgha does the invitation ceremony.’ If they’re able to do this, it’s good.

If not, you should not do the invitation ceremony with an incomplete Saṅgha. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.

20If on the invitation day a monk is seized by kings, by bandits, by scoundrels, or by enemies of the monks, other monks should say to those enemies, ‘Please release this monk for a short time, so that he can take part in the invitation ceremony.’ If they’re able to do this, it’s good. If not, they should say to those enemies, ‘Please step aside for a moment while this monk passes on his invitation.’ If they’re able to do this, it’s good. If not, they should say to those enemies, ‘Please take this monk outside the monastery zone for a short time while the Saṅgha does the invitation ceremony.’ If they’re able to do this, it’s good.

If not, you should not do the invitation ceremony with an incomplete Saṅgha. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

21At one time on the invitation day, there were five monks staying in a certain monastery. They thought: “The Buddha has laid down a rule that the invitation ceremony should be done with a saṅgha. Now there’s five of us. So how should we do the invitation ceremony?” They told the Buddha.


“When there are five of you, you should do the invitation ceremony in the Saṅgha.”

22At one time on the invitation day, there were four monks staying in a certain monastery. They thought: “The Buddha has instructed that the invitation ceremony should be done in the Saṅgha when there are five monks. But there’s only four of us. So how should we do the invitation ceremony?”

“When there are four of you, you should do the invitation ceremony with one another.

And you should do it like this. A competent and capable monk should inform those monks:


23‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen. Today is the invitation ceremony. If it seems appropriate to you, we should do the invitation ceremony with one another.’

24The most senior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the other monks:

‘I invite you to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends. For the second time … For the third time, I invite you to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends.’


25Each junior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the other monks:

‘I invite you to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends. For the second time … For the third time I invite you to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends.’”


26At one time on the invitation day, there were three monks staying in a certain monastery. They thought: “The Buddha has instructed that the invitation ceremony should be done in the Saṅgha when there are five monks and with one another when there are four. But there’s only three of us. So how should we do the invitation ceremony?”

“When there are three of you, you should do the invitation ceremony with one another.

And you should do it like this. A competent and capable monk should inform those monks:

27‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen. Today is the invitation ceremony. If it seems appropriate to you, we should do the invitation ceremony with one another.’

28The most senior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the other monks:

‘I invite you to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends. For the second time … For the third time, I invite you correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends.’

29Each junior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the other monks:

‘I invite you to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends. For the second time … For the third time I invite you to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends.’”

30At one time on the invitation day, there were two monks staying in a certain monastery. They thought: “The Buddha has instructed that the invitation ceremony should be done in the Saṅgha when there are five monks and with one another when there are three or four. But there’s only two of us. So how should we do the invitation ceremony?”

“When there are two of you, you should do the invitation ceremony with each other.

And you should do it like this. The senior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the junior monk:

‘I invite you to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerable, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends. For the second time … For the third time, I invite you to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerable, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends.’

31The junior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the senior monk:

‘I invite you to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerable, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends. For the second time … For the third time I invite you to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerable, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends.’”

At one time on the invitation day, a monk was staying in a certain monastery by himself. He thought: “The Buddha has instructed that the invitation ceremony should be done in the Saṅgha when there are five monks and with one another when there are two, three, or four. But I’m here by myself. So how should I do the invitation ceremony?”

33“On the invitation day, a monk may be staying by himself in a certain monastery. He should sweep the place where the monks normally go: whether the assembly hall, under a roof-cover, or at the foot of a tree. He should set out water for drinking and water for washing. He should prepare a seat, light a lamp, and sit down.

If other monks arrive, he should do the invitation ceremony with them. If not, he should determine: ‘Today is my invitation ceremony.’

If he doesn’t make a determination, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.


34Wherever five monks are staying together, four shouldn’t do the invitation ceremony in the Saṅgha, while the invitation of the fifth is brought. If you do the invitation in the Saṅgha, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.

Wherever four monks are staying together, three shouldn’t do the invitation ceremony with one another, while the invitation of the fourth is brought. If you do the invitation in this way, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.

Wherever three monks are staying together, two shouldn’t do the invitation ceremony with each other, while the invitation of the third is brought. If you do the invitation in this way, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.

Wherever two monks are staying together, one shouldn’t make a determination, while the invitation of the other is brought.

If you do make a determination, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

35At one time on the invitation day, a certain monk had committed an offense. He thought: “The Buddha has laid down a rule that one shouldn’t invite correction if one has an offense. And I’ve committed an offense. So what should I do?” They told the Buddha.

36“On the invitation day, a monk may have committed an offense. He should approach a single monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, ‘I’ve committed such-and-such an offense. I confess it.’ The other should say, ‘Do you recognize the offense?’ ‘Yes, I recognize it.’ ‘You should restrain yourself in the future.’

37On the invitation day, a monk may be unsure if he’s committed an offense. He should approach a single monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, ‘I’m unsure if I’ve committed such-and-such an offense. I will make amends for it when I’m sure.’ They can then do the invitation ceremony. This is not an obstacle to doing the invitation ceremony.”

38At one time a certain monk remembered an offense during the invitation ceremony. He thought: “The Buddha has laid down a rule that one shouldn’t invite correction if one has an offense. And I’ve committed an offense. So what should I do?” They told the Buddha.

39“During the invitation ceremony, a monk may remember an offense. He should say to a monk sitting next to him, ‘I’ve committed such-and-such an offense. Once this ceremony is finished, I’ll make amends for it.’ They can then continue the invitation ceremony. This is not an obstacle to doing the invitation ceremony.

40During the invitation ceremony, a monk may become unsure if he’s committed an offense. He should say to a monk sitting next to him, ‘I’m unsure if I’ve committed such-and-such an offense.

41At one time on the invitation day, the whole saṅgha in a certain monastery had committed the same offense. The monks thought: “The Buddha has laid down a rule that one shouldn’t confess or receive the confession of shared offenses. Yet here the whole saṅgha has committed the same offense. So what should we do?”

42“On the invitation day, the whole saṅgha in a certain monastery may have committed the same offense. Those monks should straightaway send a monk to a neighboring monastery: ‘Go and make amends for this offense. When you return, we’ll make amends for it with you.’

If he’s able to do this, it’s good. If he’s not, then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:


43‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. This whole saṅgha has committed the same offense. When the Saṅgha sees another monk who is pure and free of offenses, it should make amends for this offense with him.’ Once this has been said, they can do the invitation ceremony. This is not an obstacle to doing the invitation ceremony.

44On the invitation day, the whole saṅgha in a certain monastery may be unsure if it has committed the same offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha:


45‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. This whole Saṅgha is unsure if it has committed the same offense. When the Saṅgha is sure, it should make amends for this offense.’ Once this has been said, they can do the invitation ceremony. This is not an obstacle to doing the invitation ceremony.”

47At one time on the invitation day, five or more resident monks had gathered in a monastery. They did not know that there were other resident monks who had not arrived.

123At one time on the invitation day in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country, there was a threat from primitive tribes. The monks were unable to do the invitation ceremony by means of three statements.

“I allow you to do the invitation ceremony by means of two statements.”

124The threat from primitive tribes increased. The monks were unable to do the invitation ceremony by means of two statements.

“I allow you to do the invitation ceremony by means of one statement.”

125The threat from primitive tribes increased further. The monks were unable to do the invitation ceremony by means of one statement.

“I allow you to do the invitation ceremony in groups according to year of seniority.”


126-127On one occasion on the invitation day in a certain monastery, most of the night had been spent with people making offerings. The monks considered this and thought: “If the Saṅgha does the invitation ceremony by means of three statements, we won’t finish before dawn. What should we do?”

“In such a case a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:


128‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. Most of the night has been spent with people making offerings. If the Saṅgha does the invitation ceremony by means of three statements, we won’t finish before dawn. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should do the invitation ceremony by means of two statements.’ Or, ‘If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should do the invitation ceremony by means of one statement.’ Or, ‘If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should do the invitation ceremony in groups according to year of seniority.’

129It may happen on the invitation day that most of the night in a monastery is spent with monks giving teachings, with experts on the discourses reciting discourses, with experts on the Monastic Law discussing the Monastic Law, with expounders of the Teaching discussing the Teaching, or with the monks arguing. If the monks consider this and think, ‘If the Saṅgha does the invitation ceremony by means of three statements, we won’t finish before dawn,’ then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:


130‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. Most of the night has been spent with the monks arguing. If the Saṅgha does the invitation ceremony by means of three statements, we won’t finish before dawn. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should do the invitation ceremony by means of two statements.’ Or, ‘If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should do the invitation ceremony by means of one statement.’ Or, ‘If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should do the invitation ceremony in groups according to year of seniority.’”


131At one time on the invitation day in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country, a large saṅgha of monks had gathered. Just then a storm was approaching, but they only had a small sheltered area. The monks considered this and thought: “If the Saṅgha does the invitation ceremony by means of three statements, we won’t finish before it starts raining. What should we do?”

132They told the Buddha.


“In such a case a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:


133‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. This large Saṅgha of monks has gathered. A storm is approaching, but we only have a small sheltered area. If the Saṅgha does the invitation ceremony by means of three statements, we won’t finish before it starts raining. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should do the invitation ceremony by means of two statements.’ Or, ‘If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should do the invitation ceremony by means of one statement.’ Or, ‘If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should do the invitation ceremony in groups according to year of seniority.’


134It may happen on the invitation day in a certain monastery that there is a threat from kings, from bandits, from fire, from water, from humans, from spirits, from predatory animals, or from creeping animals; or there is a threat to life or a threat to the monastic life. If the monks consider this nd think, ‘This is a threat to the monastic life. If the Saṅgha does the invitation ceremony by means of three statements, we won’t finish before the threat manifests,’ then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

135‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. This is a threat to the monastic life. If the Saṅgha does the invitation ceremony by means of three statements, we won’t finish before the threat manifests. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should do the invitation ceremony by means of two statements.’ Or, ‘If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should do the invitation ceremony by means of one statement.’ Or, ‘If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should do the invitation ceremony in groups according to year of seniority.’”

#### 22. The cancellation of the invitation ^22

136At that time the monks from the group of six invited correction while having uncleared offenses.

“You should not invite correction if you have uncleared offenses. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. If anyone invites correction with an uncleared offense, you should get their permission and then accuse them of an offense.”

137Soon afterwards, when asked for permission, the monks from the group of six refused to give it.

“If anyone doesn’t give their permission, you should cancel their invitation. And it should be canceled like this. On the invitation day, whether the fourteenth or the fifteenth, in the midst of the Saṅgha and in the presence of that person, you should announce:

‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. Such-and-such a person has uncleared offenses. I cancel their invitation. The invitation ceremony should not be done in their presence.’ Their invitation has then been canceled.”

138On one occasion the monks from the group of six—hinking to act before the good monks canceled their invitation, but having no reason for doing so—canceled the invitation of pure monks who had not committed any offenses. They also canceled the invitation of those who already had invited.

“When there is no reason for doing so, you should not cancel the invitation of pure monks who haven’t committed any offenses. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. And you should not cancel the invitation of those who already have invited. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.

139And this is how the invitation is canceled and how it isn’t canceled. If the invitation is canceled after a three-statement invitation has been spoken and concluded, then it’s not canceled. If the invitation is canceled after a two-statement invitation … after a one-statement invitation … after an invitation done in groups according to the year of seniority has been spoken and concluded, then it’s not canceled.

140If the invitation is canceled when a three-statement invitation hasn’t yet been concluded, then it’s canceled. If the invitation is canceled when a two-statement invitation … when a one-statement invitation … when an invitation done in groups according to the year of seniority hasn’t yet been concluded, then it’s canceled.

141“It may happen on the invitation day that a monk cancels a second monk’s invitation. If other monks know about the first monk: ‘This venerable is impure in bodily conduct, verbal conduct, and livelihood; he’s ignorant and incompetent, incapable of answering properly when questioned,’ then they should press him by saying, ‘Enough. No more arguing and disputing,’ and the Saṅgha should then do the invitation ceremony.

142It may happen on the invitation day that a monk cancels a second monk’s invitation. If other monks know about the first monk: ‘This venerable is pure in bodily conduct, but impure in verbal conduct and livelihood; he’s ignorant and incompetent, incapable of answering properly when questioned,’ then they should press him by saying, ‘Enough. No more arguing and disputing,’ and the Saṅgha should then do the invitation ceremony.

143It may happen on the invitation day that a monk cancels a second monk’s invitation. If other monks know about the first monk: ‘This venerable is pure in bodily conduct and verbal conduct, but impure in livelihood; he’s ignorant and incompetent, incapable of answering properly when questioned,’ then they should press him by saying, ‘Enough. No more arguing and disputing,’ and the Saṅgha should then do the invitation ceremony.

144It may happen on the invitation day that a monk cancels a second monk’s invitation. If other monks know about the first monk: ‘This venerable is pure in bodily conduct, verbal conduct, and livelihood; but he’s ignorant and incompetent, incapable of answering properly when questioned,’ then they should press him by saying, ‘Enough. No more arguing and disputing,’ and the Saṅgha should then do the invitation ceremony.

145“It may happen on the invitation day that a monk cancels a second monk’s invitation. If other monks know about the first monk: ‘This venerable is pure in bodily conduct, verbal conduct, and livelihood; he’s knowledgeable and competent, capable of answering properly when questioned,’ then they should say to him, ‘Are you canceling this monk’s invitation because he’s failed in morality, in conduct, or in view?’

If he says, ‘I’m canceling it because he’s failed in morality’, ‘I’m canceling it because he’s failed in conduct’, or ‘I’m canceling it because he’s failed in view,’ he should be asked, ‘Do you know what failure in morality is?’ ‘Do you know what failure in conduct is?’ or ‘Do you know what failure in view is?’

If he says, ‘I do,’ he should be asked what they are. If he says, ‘The four offenses entailing expulsion and the thirteen entailing suspension are failure in morality,’ ‘The serious offenses, the offenses entailing confession, the offenses entailing acknowledgment, the offenses of wrong conduct, and the offenses of wrong speech are failure in conduct,’ ‘Wrong views and extreme views are failure in view,’ he should be asked, ‘Are you canceling this monk’s invitation because of what you have seen, what you have heard, or what you suspect?’

If he says, ‘I’m canceling it because of what I have seen’, ‘I’m canceling it because of what I have heard’, or ‘I’m canceling it because of what I suspect,’ he should be asked, ‘Since you’re canceling this monk’s invitation because of what you have seen, what have you seen? How did you see it? When did you see it? Where did you see it? Did you see him commit an offense entailing expulsion, an offense entailing suspension, a serious offense, an offense entailing confession, an offense entailing acknowledgment, an offense of wrong conduct, or an offense of wrong speech? Where were you? Where was this monk? What were you doing? What was this monk doing?’

If he says, ‘I didn’t cancel this monk’s invitation because of what I have seen, but because of what I have heard,’ he should be asked, ‘Since you’re canceling this monk’s invitation because of what you have heard, what have you heard? How did you hear it? When did you hear it? Where did you hear it? Did you hear that he’s committed an offense entailing expulsion, an offense entailing suspension, a serious offense, an offense entailing confession, an offense entailing acknowledgment, an offense of wrong conduct, or an offense of wrong speech? Did you hear it from a monk, a nun, a trainee nun, a novice monk, a novice nun, a male lay follower, or a female lay follower? Or did you hear it from kings, a king’s officials, the monastics of another religion, or the lay followers of another religion?’

If he says, ‘I didn’t cancel this monk’s invitation because of what I have heard, but because of what I suspect,’ he should be asked, ‘Since you’re canceling this monk’s invitation because of suspicion, what do you suspect? How do you suspect it? When did you suspect it? Where did you suspect it? Do you suspect that he’s committed an offense entailing expulsion, an offense entailing suspension, a serious offense, an offense entailing confession, an offense entailing acknowledgment, an offense of wrong conduct, or an offense of wrong speech? Do you suspect it after hearing about it from a monk, a nun, a trainee nun, a novice monk, a novice nun, a male lay follower, or a female lay follower? Or do you suspect it after hearing about it from kings, a king’s officials, the monastics of another religion, or the lay followers of another religion?’

He might say, ‘I didn’t cancel this monk’s invitation because what I suspect. I don’t know why I canceled his invitation.’ If the accusing monk, when questioned, isn’t able to satisfy his discerning fellow monastics, they should conclude, ‘The accused monk is improperly accused.’ But if the accusing monk, when questioned, is able to satisfy his discerning fellow monastics, they should conclude, ‘The accused monk is properly accused.’

If the accusing monk admits to a groundless charge of an offense entailing expulsion, he should be charged with an offense entailing suspension. The Saṅgha should then do the invitation ceremony. If the accusing monk admits to a groundless charge of an offense entailing suspension, he should be dealt with according to the rule. The Saṅgha should then do the invitation ceremony. If the accusing monk admits to a groundless charge of a serious offense, an offense entailing confession, an offense entailing acknowledgment, an offense of wrong conduct, or an offense of wrong speech, he should be dealt with according to the rule. The Saṅgha should then do the invitation ceremony.

If the accused monk admits to having committed an offense entailing expulsion, he should be expelled. The Saṅgha should then do the invitation ceremony. If the accused monk admits to having committed an offense entailing suspension, he should be charged with that offense. The Saṅgha should then do the invitation ceremony. If the accused monk admits to having committed a serious offense, an offense entailing confession, an offense entailing acknowledgment, an offense of wrong conduct, or an offense of wrong speech, he should be dealt with according to the rule. The Saṅgha should then do the invitation ceremony.”

146“On the invitation day, a monk may have committed a serious offense. Some monks regard it as a serious offense, but others as an offense entailing suspension. The monks who regard it as a serious offense should take that monk aside and deal with him according to the rule. They should then approach the Saṅgha and say:

‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. I know about an offense, but not who the offender is. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, it should set aside the offense and then do the invitation ceremony.’

154At one time in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country, a number of monks who were friends had entered the rainy-season residence together. Other monks who were quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha had entered the rains residence nearby. They said to one another: “At the invitation ceremony, when those monks have completed the rains residence, we’ll cancel their invitation.” The monks who were friends heard about this and wondered what to do. They told the Buddha.


155“In such a case I allow those monks to do two or three observance-day ceremonies on the fourteenth day, with the aim of having their invitation ceremony before the other monks.

If those quarrelsome and argumentative monks are on their way to the other monastery, the resident monks should gather quickly and do the invitation ceremony. When it has been done, they should say to the other monks, ‘Venerables, we have completed the invitation ceremony. Please do as you see fit.’

If those quarrelsome and argumentative monks arrive without prior notice, the resident monks should prepare seats and set out a foot stool, a foot scraper, and water for washing the feet. They should then go out to meet those monks, receive their bowls and robes, and ask if they want water to drink. Then, having distracted them, they should go outside the monastery zone and do the invitation ceremony there. When it has been done, they should say to the other monks, ‘Venerables, we have completed the invitation ceremony. Please do as you see fit.’


If they’re able to do this, it’s good. If not, then a resident monk who is competent and capable should inform the resident monks:

156‘Please, Venerables, I ask the resident monks to listen. If it seems appropriate to you, we’ll now do the observance-day ceremony and recite the Monastic Code, and we’ll do the invitation ceremony at the next new moon.’

If the quarrelsome and argumentative monks say, ‘It would be good if you did the invitation ceremony with us now,’ they should be told, ‘You have no authority over our invitation ceremony. We won’t do the procedure for the time being.’

If the quarrelsome and argumentative monks stay on until the new moon, then a resident monk who is competent and capable should inform the resident monks:


157‘Please, Venerables, I ask the resident monks to listen. If it seems appropriate to you, we’ll now do the observance-day ceremony and recite the Monastic Code, and we’ll do the invitation ceremony at the next full moon.’

If the quarrelsome and argumentative monks say, ‘It would be good if you did the invitation ceremony with us now,’ they should be told, ‘You have no authority over our invitation ceremony. We won’t do the procedure for the time being.’

If the quarrelsome and argumentative monks stay on until the next full moon, then all the monks have no choice but to do the invitation ceremony on the day of Komudī, the fourth full moon of the rainy season.


158“If, while you’re doing the invitation ceremony, a sick monk cancels the invitation of a healthy monk, you should tell him, ‘You’re sick. The Buddha has said that a sick monk can’t endure being questioned. Please wait until you’re healthy. If you then wish, you may accuse him.’ If, in spite of this, he still accuses the other, he commits an offense entailing confession for disrespect.

If, while you’re doing the invitation ceremony, a healthy monk cancels the invitation of a sick monk, you should tell him, ‘This monk is sick. The Buddha has said that a sick monk can’t endure being questioned. Please wait until he’s healthy. If you then wish, you may accuse him.’ If, in spite of this, he still accuses the other, he commits an offense entailing confession for disrespect.

If, while you’re doing the invitation ceremony, a sick monk cancels the invitation of a sick monk, you should tell him, ‘You’re both sick. The Buddha has said that a sick monk can’t endure being questioned. Please wait until you’re both healthy. If you then wish, you may accuse him.’ If, in spite of this, he still accuses the other, he commits an offense entailing confession for disrespect.

If, while you’re doing the invitation ceremony, a healthy monk cancels the invitation of a healthy monk, you should question and examine both and deal with them according to the rule. The Saṅgha should then continue the invitation ceremony.”

159-160On one occasion in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country, a number of monks who were friends had entered the rainy-season residence together. While living together in peace and harmony, they were experiencing deep meditation. They considered this and thought: “If we do the invitation ceremony now, the monks might set out wandering. We’ll then lose this deep meditation. So what should we do?” They told the Buddha.

“In such a case I allow those monks to make an agreement about the invitation ceremony.

And it should be made like this. Everyone should gather in one place. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha:


161‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. While living together in peace and harmony, we’re experiencing deep meditation.

The Saṅgha makes an agreement about the invitation ceremony: we’ll now do the observance-day ceremony and recite the Monastic Code, and we’ll do the invitation ceremony on the day of Komudī, the fourth full moon of the rainy season. Any monk who approves of making this agreement about the invitation ceremony—that we’ll now do the observance-day ceremony and recite the Monastic Code and that we’ll do the invitation ceremony on the day of Komudī, the fourth full moon of the rainy season—should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.

163The Saṅgha has made an agreement about the invitation ceremony: we’ll now do the observance-day ceremony and recite the Monastic Code, and we’ll do the invitation ceremony on the day of Komudī, the fourth full moon of the rainy season. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’

164If, when those monks have made an agreement about the invitation ceremony, a monk says, ‘I wish to go wandering in the country; I have business there,’ they should tell him, ‘That’s fine, but you have to do the invitation first.’

If, while that monk is doing the invitation, he cancels the invitation of another monk, the other monk should tell him, ‘You have no authority over my invitation until I invite.’

If, while that monk is doing the invitation, another monk cancels his invitation, the monks should question and examine both and deal with them according to the rule.

If that monk finishes his business in the country and returns to that monastery before the full-moon day of Komudī. If, while the monks are doing the invitation ceremony, a monk cancels the invitation of the monk who has returned, the monk who has returned should tell him, ‘You have no authority over my invitation; I’ve already done it.’

If, while the monks are doing the invitation ceremony, the monk who has returned cancels the invitation of another monk, the monks should question and examine both and deal with them according to the rule. The Saṅgha should then continue the invitation ceremony.”


165The fourth chapter on the invitation ceremony is finished.

166This is the summary:

167“Completed rains residence in Kosala,  
They went to see the Teacher;  
Living uncomfortably like animals,  
One another in the proper way.

168Inviting, and in the seat,  
Legal procedure, sick, relatives;  
King, and bandits, and scoundrels,  
So enemies of monks.

169Five, four, three, two, one,  
Committed, unsure, he remembered;  
The whole Saṅgha, unsure,  
Greater, and equal, smaller.

170Residents, fourteenth,  
Characteristics, belonging to a Buddhist sect, both;  
May go, not with seated,  
About giving consent, invitation.

171With primitive tribes, spent, storm,  
And threat, invitation;  
They refused, before their,  
And isn’t canceled, a monk’s.

172‘Or why’, and what,  
Because of the seen, the heard, the suspected;  
The accuser, and the accused,  
Serious offense, offense, quarrel;  
And agreement about the invitation,  
One without authority, should invite.”

173In this chapter there are forty-six topics.  
  
The chapter on the invitation ceremony is finished.
