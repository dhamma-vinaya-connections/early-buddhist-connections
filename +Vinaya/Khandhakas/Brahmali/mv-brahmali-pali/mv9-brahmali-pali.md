1At one time the Buddha was staying at Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā lotus pond. At that time in the country of Kāsī there was a village called Vāsabha with a resident monk called Kassapagotta. He was dedicated to the local monastery, trying to get good monks to come, to help those who had come be comfortable, and to make the local monastery grow and reach maturity.

At this time a number of monks who were wandering in Kāsī arrived at Vāsabha. When Kassapagotta saw those monks coming, he prepared seats, and he set out a foot stool, a foot scraper, and water for washing the feet. He then went out to meet them, received their bowls and robes, and asked if they wanted water to drink. He made sure they had a bath, and he helped them get rice porridge, fresh foods, and meals. Those newly arrived monks thought: “He’s great, this resident monk, in that he helps us with all these things. Let’s settle down right here in Vāsabha.” And they did just that.


2Soon afterwards Kassapagotta thought: “These monks are now rid of their tiredness from traveling. And by now they know where to get alms. Also, in the long run it’s hard work to seek support from unrelated folk, and people don’t like to be asked. Why don’t I stop helping them get rice porridge, fresh foods, and meals?” And he did.


3Those newly arrived monks considered: “Previously this resident monk made sure we got a bath, and he helped us get rice porridge, fresh foods, and meals. But now he’s stopped. He’s become hostile, this resident monk. Well then, let’s eject him.”

Soon afterwards those newly arrived monks gathered and confronted Kassapagotta with what had happened, adding: “You’ve committed an offense. Do you recognize it?”

“No. I haven’t committed any offense that I should recognize.”


Those newly arrived monks then ejected Kassapagotta for not recognizing an offense.


5Kassapagotta thought: “I don’t actually know whether this was an offense or not, whether I’ve committed one or not, whether I’ve been ejected or not, whether it was legitimate or not, whether it’s reversible or not, whether it’s fit to stand or not. Let me go to Campā and ask the Buddha.”

He then put his dwelling in order, took his bowl and robe, and set out for Campā. When he eventually arrived, he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, the Buddha said to Kassapagotta: “I hope you’re keeping well, monk, I hope you’re getting by. I hope you’re not tired from traveling. And where have you come from?”

“I’m keeping well, Venerable Sir, I’m getting by. I’m not tired from traveling.” And he told the Buddha all that had happened, adding,


“That’s where I’ve come from.”

“Well, that’s not an offense, monk, and you haven’t been ejected. You’ve been ejected by an illegitimate legal procedure that’s reversible and unfit to stand. Go back and stay right there in the village of Vāsabha.”

“Yes, Sir.” He got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and set out for Vāsabha.


6Soon those newly arrived monks became anxious and remorseful: “It’s truly bad for us that we have ejected, without reason, a pure monk who hadn’t committed any offense. Well then, let’s go to Campā and confess our mistake to the Buddha.”

They then put their dwellings in order, took their bowls and robes, and set out for Campā. When they eventually arrived, they went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, the Buddha said to them: “I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re getting by. I hope you’re not tired from traveling. And where have you come from?”

“We’re keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re getting by. We’re not tired from traveling. There’s a village in the country of Kāsī called Vāsabha. That’s where we’ve come from.”


“Are you the ones who ejected the resident monk?”

“Yes, Sir.”


“For what reason?”

“Without any reason.”


The Buddha rebuked them: “Foolish men, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you, without reason, eject a pure monk who hadn’t committed any offense? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“You should not, without reason, eject a pure monk who hasn’t committed any offense. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”


7Those monks then got up from their seats, put their upper robe over one shoulder, bowed down with their heads at the Buddha’s feet, and said: “Venerable Sir, we have made a mistake. We’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful in ejecting, without reason, a pure monk who hadn’t committed any offense. Please accept our confession so that we may restrain ourselves in the future.”

“You have certainly made a mistake. You’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful. But since you acknowledge your mistake and make proper amends, I forgive you. For this is called growth in the training of the noble ones: acknowledging a mistake, making proper amends, and undertaking restraint for the future.”

8At that time the monks at Campā did legal procedures such as these: illegitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly, illegitimate legal procedures done by a unanimous assembly, legitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly, legitimate-like legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly, legitimate-like legal procedures done by a unanimous assembly, one person ejecting another, one ejecting two, one ejecting three, one ejecting a saṅgha, two ejecting one, two ejecting two, two ejecting three, two ejecting a saṅgha, three ejecting one, three ejecting two, three ejecting three, three ejecting a saṅgha, a saṅgha ejecting a saṅgha.


9The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks at Campā do such legal procedures?”

They told the Buddha. … “Is it true, monks, that the monks at Campā do this?”

“It’s true, Sir.”


10The Buddha rebuked them, It’s not suitable for those foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How can they do such legal procedures? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


11

- “Illegitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly are invalid and not to be done.
- Illegitimate legal procedures done by a unanimous assembly are invalid and not to be done.
- Legitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly are invalid and not to be done.
- Legitimate-like legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly are invalid and not to be done.
- Legitimate-like legal procedures done by a unanimous assembly are invalid and not to be done.
- One person ejecting another is invalid and not to be done.
- One ejecting two is invalid and not to be done.
- One ejecting three is invalid and not to be done.
- One ejecting a saṅgha is invalid and not to be done.
- Two ejecting one is invalid and not to be done.
- Two ejecting two is invalid and not to be done.
- Two ejecting three is invalid and not to be done.
- Two ejecting a saṅgha is invalid and not to be done.
- Three ejecting one is invalid and not to be done.
- Three ejecting two is invalid and not to be done.
- Three ejecting three is invalid and not to be done.
- Three ejecting a saṅgha is invalid and not to be done.
- A saṅgha ejecting a saṅgha is invalid and not to be done.


12There are four kinds of legal procedures: an illegitimate legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly, an illegitimate legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly, a legitimate legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly, and a legitimate legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly.

- The illegitimate legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly is reversible and unfit to stand, because it’s illegitimate and the assembly is incomplete. You shouldn’t do such procedures. I haven’t allowed such procedures.
- The illegitimate legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly is reversible and unfit to stand, because it’s illegitimate. You shouldn’t do such procedures. I haven’t allowed such procedures.
- The legitimate legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly is reversible and unfit to stand, because the assembly is incomplete. You shouldn’t do such procedures. I haven’t allowed such procedures.
- The legitimate legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly is irreversible and fit to stand, because it’s legitimate and the assembly is unanimous. You should do such procedures. I have allowed such procedures.

And so, monks, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will perform legitimate legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly.’”

13At that time the monks from the group of six did legal procedures such as these: illegitimate procedures done by an incomplete assembly; illegitimate procedures done by a unanimous assembly; legitimate procedures done by an incomplete assembly; legitimate-like procedures done by an incomplete assembly; legitimate-like procedures done by a unanimous assembly; procedures deficient in motion but complete in announcement; procedures deficient in announcement but complete in motion; procedures deficient in both motion and announcement; procedures not done according to the Teaching; procedures not done according to the Monastic Law; procedures not done according to the Teacher’s instructions; procedures that had been objected to, that were illegitimate, reversible, and unfit to stand.


14The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks from the group of six do such legal procedures?”


They told the Buddha. … “Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six do this?”

“It’s true, Sir.”

The Buddha rebuked them … He then gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


- “Illegitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly are invalid and not to be done
- Illegitimate legal procedures done by a unanimous assembly are invalid and not to be done
- Legitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly are invalid and not to be done
- Legitimate-like legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly are invalid and not to be done
- Legitimate-like legal procedures done by a unanimous assembly are invalid and not to be done
- Legal procedures deficient in motion but complete in announcement are invalid and not to be done
- Legal procedures deficient in announcement but complete in motion are invalid and not to be done
- Legal procedures deficient in both motion and announcement are invalid and not to be done
- Legal procedures not done according to the Teaching are invalid and not to be done
- Legal procedures not done according to the Monastic Law are invalid and not to be done
- Legal procedures not done according to the Teacher’s instructions are invalid and not to be done
- Legal procedures that have been objected to, that are illegitimate, reversible, and unfit to stand are invalid and not to be done.


17And, monks, there are six kinds of legal procedures: illegitimate legal procedures, legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly, legal procedures done by a unanimous assembly, legitimate-like legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly, legitimate-like legal procedures done by a unanimous assembly, legitimate legal procedures done by a unanimous assembly.


18What’s an illegitimate legal procedure?

If a procedure requires one motion and one announcement, but they do it with one motion and no announcement, it’s an illegitimate legal procedure. If a procedure requires one motion and one announcement, but they do it with two motions and no announcement, it’s an illegitimate legal procedure. If a procedure requires one motion and one announcement, but they do it with one announcement and no motion, it’s an illegitimate legal procedure. If a procedure requires one motion and one announcement, but they do it with two announcements and no motion, it’s an illegitimate legal procedure.

If a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, but they do it with one motion and no announcement, it is an illegitimate legal procedure. If a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, but they do it with two motions and no announcement, it’s an illegitimate legal procedure. If a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, but they do it with three motions and no announcement, it’s an illegitimate legal procedure. If a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, but they do it with four motions and no announcement, it’s an illegitimate legal procedure. If a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, but they do it with one announcement and no motion, it’s an illegitimate legal procedure. If a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, but they do it with two announcements and no motion, it’s an illegitimate legal procedure. If a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, but they do it with three announcements and no motion, it’s an illegitimate legal procedure. If a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, but they do it with four announcements and no motion, it’s an illegitimate legal procedure.


19“And what’s a legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly?

When a procedure requires one motion and one announcement, but the monks who should be present haven’t all arrived, and the consent hasn’t been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and someone present objects to the decision, then it’s a legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly. When a procedure requires one motion and one announcement, and the monks who should be present have arrived, but the consent hasn’t been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and someone present objects to the decision, then it’s a legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly. When a procedure requires one motion and one announcement, and the monks who should be present have arrived, and consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, but someone present objects to the decision, then it’s a legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly.

When a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, but the monks who should be present haven’t all arrived, and consent hasn’t been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and someone present objects to the decision, then it’s a legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly. When a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, and the monks who should be present have arrived, but consent hasn’t been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and someone present objects to the decision, then it’s a legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly. When a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, and the monks who should be present have arrived, and consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, but someone present objects to the decision, then it’s a legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly.


20“And what’s a legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly?

When a procedure requires one motion and one announcement, and the monks who should be present have arrived, and consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no one present objects to the decision, then it’s a legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly. When a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, and the monks who should be present have arrived, and consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no one present objects to the decision, then it’s a legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly.


21“And what’s a legitimate-like legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly?

When a procedure requires one motion and one announcement, but they make the announcement first and put forward the motion afterwards, and the monks who should be present haven’t all arrived, and consent hasn’t been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and someone present objects to the decision, then it’s a legitimate-like legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly. When a procedure requires one motion and one announcement, but they make the announcement first and put forward the motion afterwards, yet the monks who should be present have arrived, but consent hasn’t been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and someone present objects to the decision, then it’s a legitimate-like legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly. When a procedure requires one motion and one announcement, but they make the announcement first and put forward the motion afterwards, yet the monks who should be present have arrived, and consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, but someone present objects to the decision, then it’s a legitimate-like legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly.

When a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, but they make the announcements first and put forward the motion afterwards, and if the monks who should be present haven’t all arrived, and consent hasn’t been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and someone present objects to the decision, then it’s a legitimate-like legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly. When a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, but they make the announcements first and put forward the motion afterwards, yet the monks who should be present have arrived, but consent hasn’t been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and someone present objects to the decision, then it’s a legitimate-like legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly. When a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, but they make the announcements first and put forward the motion afterwards, yet the monks who should be present have arrived, and consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, but someone present objects to the decision, then it’s a legitimate-like legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly.


22“And what’s a legitimate-like legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly?

When a procedure requires one motion and one announcement, but they make the announcement first and put forward the motion afterwards, yet the monks who should be present have arrived, and consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no one present objects to the decision, then it’s a legitimate-like legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly. When a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, but they make the announcements first and put forward the motion afterwards, yet the monks who should be present have arrived, and consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no one present objects to the decision, then it’s a legitimate-like legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly.


23“And what is a legitimate legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly?

When a procedure requires one motion and one announcement, and they put forward the motion first and make the announcement afterwards, and the monks who should be present have arrived, and consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no one present objects to the decision, then it’s a legitimate legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly.

24“There are five kinds of saṅghas: a saṅgha of monks consisting of a group of four, a saṅgha of monks consisting of a group of five, a saṅgha of monks consisting of a group of ten, a saṅgha of monks consisting of a group of twenty, a saṅgha of monks consisting of a group of more than twenty.

1. A saṅgha of monks consisting of a group of four—in a unanimous assembly, acting legitimately—is able to do all legal procedures except three: ordination, invitation, and rehabilitation.
2. A saṅgha of monks consisting of a group of five—in a unanimous assembly, acting legitimately—is able to do all legal procedures except two: ordination in the central Ganges plain and rehabilitation.
3. A saṅgha of monks consisting of a group of ten—in a unanimous assembly, acting legitimately—is able to do all legal procedures except one: rehabilitation.
4. A saṅgha of monks consisting of a group of twenty—in a unanimous assembly, acting legitimately—is able to do all legal procedures.
5. A saṅgha of monks consisting of a group of more than twenty—unanimous, acting legitimately—is able to do all legal procedures.

25If a legal procedure that requires a group of four is done with a nun as the fourth member, it’s invalid and not to be done. If a legal procedure that requires a group of four is done with a trainee nun as the fourth member, with a novice monk as the fourth member, with a novice nun as the fourth member, with one who’s renounced the training as the fourth member, with one who’s committed the worst kind of offense as the fourth member, with one who’s been ejected for not recognizing an offense as the fourth member, with one who’s been ejected for not making amends for an offense as the fourth member, with one who’s been ejected for not giving up a bad view as the fourth member, with a _paṇḍaka_ as the fourth member, with one living in the community by theft as the fourth member, with one who’s previously left to join the monastics of another religion as the fourth member, with an animal as the fourth member, with a matricide as the fourth member, with a patricide as the fourth member, with a murderer of a perfected one as the fourth member, with one who’s raped a nun as the fourth member, with one who’s caused a schism in the Saṅgha as the fourth member, with one who’s caused the Buddha to bleed as the fourth member, with a hermaphrodite as the fourth member, with one belonging to a different Buddhist sect as the fourth member, with one who’s outside the monastery zone as the fourth member, with one floating in the air by supernormal power as the fourth member, or with one who’s subject to the legal procedure as the fourth member, it’s invalid and not to be done.”

27“If a legal procedure that requires a group of five is done with a nun as the fifth member, it’s invalid and not to be done. If a legal procedure that requires a group of five is done with a trainee nun as the fifth member, with a novice monk as the fifth member, with a novice nun as the fifth member, with one who’s renounced the training as the fifth member, with one who’s committed the worst kind of offense as the fifth member, with one who’s been ejected for not recognizing an offense as the fifth member, with one who’s been ejected for not making amends for an offense as the fifth member, with one who’s been ejected for not giving up a bad view as the fifth member, with a _paṇḍaka_ as the fifth member, with one living in the community by theft as the fifth member, with one who’s previously left to join the monastics of another religion as the fifth member, with an animal as the fifth member, with a matricide as the fifth member, with a patricide as the fifth member, with a murderer of a perfected one as the fifth member, with one who’s raped a nun as the fifth member, with one who’s caused a schism in the Saṅgha as the fifth member, with one who’s caused the Buddha to bleed as the fifth member, with a hermaphrodite as the fifth member, with one belonging to a different Buddhist sect as the fifth member, with one who’s outside the monastery zone as the fifth member, with one floating in the air by supernormal power as the fifth member, or with one who’s subject to the legal procedure as the fifth member, it’s invalid and not to be done.”

34In the midst of the Saṅgha, the objections of some are valid, not the objections of others. Whose objections are invalid in the midst of the Saṅgha? In the midst of the Saṅgha, the objection of a nun is invalid. In the midst of the Saṅgha, the objection of a trainee nun, of a novice monk, of a novice nun, of one who’s renounced the training, of one who’s committed the worst kind of offense, of one who’s insane, of one who’s deranged, of one who’s overwhelmed by pain, of one who’s been ejected for not recognizing an offense, of one who’s been ejected for not making amends for an offense, of one who’s been ejected for not giving up a bad view, of a _paṇḍaka_, of one living in the community by theft, of one who’s previously left to join the monastics of another religion, of an animal, of a matricide, of a patricide, of a murderer of a perfected one, of one who’s raped a nun, of one who’s caused a schism in the Saṅgha, of one who’s caused the Buddha to bleed, of a hermaphrodite, of one who belongs to a different Buddhist sect, of one who’s outside the monastery zone, of one floating in the air by supernormal power, or of one who’s subject to the legal procedure is invalid.

36“There are two kinds of sending away. If the Saṅgha sends away someone who doesn’t have the attributes needed to be sent away, the sending away may succeed or fail. When does it fail?

It fails if the monk is pure, without offenses.

37When does it succeed? It succeeds if the monk is ignorant, incompetent, often committing offenses, lacking in boundaries, constantly and improperly socializing with householders.


38There are two kinds of admittance. If the Saṅgha admits someone who doesn’t have the attributes needed to be admitted, the admittance may succeed or fail.

When does it fail? A _paṇḍaka_ doesn’t have the attributes needed to be admitted, and if the Saṅgha admits him, his admittance fails. One living in the community by theft, one who’s previously left to join the monastics of another religion, an animal, a matricide, a patricide, a murderer of a perfected one, one who’s raped a nun, one who’s caused a schism in the Saṅgha, one who’s caused the Buddha to bleed, or a hermaphrodite doesn’t have the attributes needed to be admitted, and if the Saṅgha admits him, his admittance fails.

39When does it succeed? One without a hand doesn’t have the attributes needed to be admitted, but if the Saṅgha admits him, his admittance succeeds. One without a foot, one without a hand and a foot, one without an ear, one without nose, one without an ear and nose, one without a finger or toe, one with a cut tendon, one with joined fingers, a hunchback, a dwarf, one with goiter, one who’s branded, one who’s been whipped, a sentenced criminal, one with elephantiasis, one with a serious sickness, one with abnormal appearance, one blind in one eye, one with a crooked limb, one who’s lame, one paralyzed on one side, one crippled, one weak from old age, one who’s blind, one who’s mute, one who’s deaf, one who’s blind and mute, one who’s blind and deaf, one who’s mute and deaf, or one who’s blind and mute and deaf doesn’t have the attributes needed to be admitted, but if the Saṅgha admits him, his admittance succeeds.”

56On one occasion Venerable Upāli went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said: “If, Venerable Sir, a unanimous Saṅgha doesn’t do a legal procedure face-to-face that should be done face-to-face, is that a legitimate procedure, in accordance with the Monastic Law?”

“That legal procedure, Upāli, is illegitimate, contrary to the Monastic Law.”


“If a unanimous Saṅgha does a procedure without questioning that should be done with questioning, does a procedure without admission that should be done with admission, applies resolution because of past insanity to one deserving resolution through recollection, does a procedure of further penalty against one deserving resolution because of past insanity, does a procedure of condemnation against one deserving a procedure of further penalty, does a procedure of demotion against one deserving a procedure of condemnation, does a procedure of banishment against one deserving a procedure of demotion, does a procedure of reconciliation against one deserving a procedure of banishment, does a procedure of ejection against one deserving a procedure of reconciliation, gives probation to one deserving a procedure of ejection, sends back to the beginning one deserving probation, gives the trial period to one deserving to be sent back to the beginning, rehabilitates one deserving the trial period, or gives full ordination to one deserving rehabilitation, is that a legitimate procedure, in accordance with the Monastic Law?”

57“That legal procedure, Upāli, is illegitimate, contrary to the Monastic Law. If a unanimous Saṅgha doesn’t do a legal procedure face-to-face that should be done face-to-face, that procedure is illegitimate, contrary to the Monastic Law, and the Saṅgha is at fault. If a unanimous Saṅgha does a legal procedure without questioning that should be done with questioning, does a legal procedure without admission that should be done with admission, applies resolution because of past insanity to one deserving resolution through recollection, does a legal procedure of further penalty against one deserving resolution because of past insanity, does a legal procedure of condemnation against one deserving a procedure of further penalty, does a legal procedure of demotion against one deserving a procedure of condemnation, does a legal procedure of banishment against one deserving a procedure of demotion, does a legal procedure of reconciliation against one deserving a procedure of banishment, does a legal procedure of ejection against one deserving a procedure of reconciliation, gives probation to one deserving a procedure of ejection, sends back to the beginning one deserving probation, gives the trial period to one deserving to be sent back to the beginning, rehabilitates one deserving the trial period, or gives full ordination to one deserving rehabilitation, that procedure is illegitimate, contrary to the Monastic Law, and the Saṅgha is at fault.”

58But if, Sir, a unanimous Saṅgha does a legal procedure face-to-face that should be done face-to-face, is that a legitimate procedure, in accordance with the Monastic Law?”

64Soon afterwards the Buddha addressed the monks: “If a unanimous Saṅgha applies resolution because of past insanity to one deserving resolution through recollection, that procedure is illegitimate, contrary to the Monastic Law, and the Saṅgha is at fault.

124The ninth chapter on those from Campā is finished.


125This is the summary:

126 “The Buddha was at Campā,  
The account of the village of Vāsabha;  
Helping the newly arrived,  
He worked for what they wanted.

127 Knowing, ‘They are knowledgeable’,  
He made no effort then;  
Ejected, ‘He did not’,  
He went to the Victor.

128Illegitimate legal procedures with incomplete assembly,  
And illegitimate legal procedures with unanimous assembly;  
And legitimate legal procedures with incomplete assembly,  
Legitimate-like with incomplete assembly.

129Legitimate-like with unanimous assembly,  
One person ejects another;  
And one ejects two or three,  
One ejects a Saṅgha.

130The same for two and three,  
And a Saṅgha ejects a Saṅgha;  
The Excellent Omniscient One having heard,  
Prohibited the illegitimate.

131A procedure deficient in motion,  
But complete in announcement;  
One deficient in announcement,  
But complete in motion.

132And one deficient in both,  
And not according to the Teaching;  
The Monastic Law, the Teacher, objected to,  
Reversible, unfit to stand.

133Illegitimate with incomplete assembly, with unanimous assembly,  
Legitimate, two legitimate-like;  
Just legitimate with a unanimous assembly,  
Was allowed by the Buddha.

134A group of four, a group of five,  
And a group of ten, twenty;  
And a group of more than twenty,  
Thus a five-fold Saṅgha.

135Apart from ordination,  
And the procedure of invitation;  
Together with the procedure of rehabilitation,  
Is done by a group of four.

136Apart from two procedures,  
Ordination in the Middle Country;  
Rehabilitation, a group of five,  
Does of all procedures.

137Apart from rehabilitation,  
Is a group of ten monks;  
A saṅgha that does all procedures,  
Is twenty, a doer of all.

138A nun, and a trainee nun,  
A novice monk, a novice nun;  
Who has renounced, the worst kind of offense,  
Ejected for not seeing an offense.

139For not making amends, for a bad view,  
A paṇḍaka, one living together by theft;  
Monastics of another religion, animal,  
Killer of mother, and father.

140A perfected one, a rapist of a nun,  
A schismatic, a shedder of blood;  
A hermaphrodite, a different Buddhist sect,  
Outside the monastic zone, by supernormal power.

141The one who is subject to the legal procedure,  
These twenty-four are;  
Prohibited by the Fully Awakened One,  
For these do not complete the quorum.

142If, with one on probation as the fourth,  
It should give probation;  
Or send to the beginning, give trial, rehabilitate,  
It's invalid, not to be done.

143One deserving sending back, deserving trial, on trial,  
And even deserving rehabilitation;  
These five cannot do a procedure,  
Explained the Fully Awakened One.

144A nun, and a trainee nun,  
A novice monk, a novice nun;  
Who has renounced, the worst kind, insane,  
Deranged, pain, for not seeing.

145For not making amends, for a bad view,  
And also a _paṇḍaka_, hermaphrodite;  
One from a different Buddhist sect, monastery zone,  
Air, and the subject of the procedure.

146Of these eighteen,  
An objection is invalid;  
Of a regular monk,  
An objection is valid.

147For one who is pure, the sending away fails,  
For the fool it succeeds;  
The _paṇḍaka_, living together by theft,  
Joined, animal.

148Of mother, of father, a perfected One,  
A rapist, a schismatic;  
And a shedder of blood,  
And one who is a hermaphrodite.

149Of these eleven,  
The admittance fails;  
Hand, foot, both of them,  
Ear, nose, both of them.

150Finger, thumb, tendon,  
Joined, and hunchback, dwarf;  
Goiter, branded, and whipped,  
And sentenced, elephantiasis.

151Serious, abnormal, and blind in one eye,  
Crooked limb, lame, and also the paralyzed;  
Crippled, weak,  
Blind, and mute, deaf.

152Blind and mute, blind and deaf,  
Mute and deaf;  
And blind and mute and deaf,  
Thirty-two exactly.

153For them there is admittance,  
Explained the Fully Awakened one;  
They are to be seen, to be remedied,  
There is no sending away.

154A procedure of ejection against one,  
Seven are illegitimate;  
If committed but acting properly,  
Those seven too are illegitimate.

155If committed and not acting properly,  
Seven procedures are legitimate;  
Face-to-face, and questioning,  
And done with admission.

156Recollection, insanity, penalty,  
Condemnation, and with demotion;  
Banishment, reconciliation,  
Ejection, and probation.

157Beginning, trial, rehabilitation,  
Just so ordination;  
If it does one in place of another,  
These sixteen are illegitimate.

158If it does the right one,  
These sixteen are legitimate;  
It would counter-accuse reciprocally,  
These sixteen are illegitimate.

159Two and two having that basis,  
Also these sixteen are legitimate;  
The permutation with a one-by-one basis,  
‘Illegitimate’, said the Victor.

160It did a legal procedure of condemnation,  
The Saṅgha, the one who is quarrelsome;  
An illegitimate procedure with incomplete assembly,  
He went to another monastery.

161There unanimous assembly with illegitimate,  
Did condemnation against him;  
Another incomplete assembly with legitimate,  
Did condemnation against him.

162Also incomplete assembly with legitimate-like,  
So did a unanimous assembly;  
And a unanimous assembly with illegitimate,  
And an incomplete assembly with legitimate.

163And incomplete assembly with legitimate-like,  
And unanimous assembly, in these cases;  
Having done the basis one by one,  
A discerning one would link the permutation series.

164Demotion for the incompetent fool,  
The corrupter of families should be banished;  
And a procedure of reconciliation,  
Should be done to the abuser.

165In not recognizing, in not making amends,  
And one who would not give up a view;  
For them there is the procedure of ejection,  
Said the Caravan Leader.

166With regard to the procedures that have a method,  
A wise one should determine condemnation;  
For those who act suitably,  
One who conducts himself properly, he should ask.

167The lifting of those procedures,  
And in accordance with the method for the procedure as above;  
In regard to whichever procedure,  
And there they dispute.

168Invalid, and just badly done,  
And to be done again;  
And also for the lifting of procedures,  
Those monks speak in accordance with the Teaching.

169 Having seen those afflicted by the disease of failure,  
To those who are ready for the legal procedure;  
The Great Sage declared the lifting,  
Like a surgeon applies the medicine.”


In this chapter there are thirty-six topics.

The chapter connected with Campā is finished.
