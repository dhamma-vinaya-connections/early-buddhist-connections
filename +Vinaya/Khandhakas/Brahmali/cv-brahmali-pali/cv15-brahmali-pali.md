Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks:

“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are doing this?”

“It’s true, Sir.”


The Buddha rebuked them: “It’s not suitable for those foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How can they do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

26On one occasion a monk had been bitten by a snake and died. They told the Buddha.

“That monk hadn’t spread good will to the four royal snake clans. Had he done so, he wouldn’t have died. What are the four clans? The Virūpakkhas, the Erāpathas, the Chabyāputtas, and the Kaṇhāgotamas. To protect yourselves, monks, you should spread good will to these four royal snake clans. And it should be done like this:


27I have good will toward the Virūpakkhas,  
Toward the Erāpathas I have good will;  
I have good will toward the Chabyāputtas,  
And toward the Kaṇhāgotamas.

28I have good will toward the legless,  
Toward the two-legged I have good will;  
I have good will toward the four-legged,  
And toward the many-legged.

29May the legless not hurt me,  
May the two-legged not hurt me.  
May the four-legged not hurt me,  
May the many-legged not hurt me.

30All beings, all creatures,  
All living beings everywhere,  
May they all have good fortune,  
May none meet with anything bad.

31The Buddha is unlimited,  
The Teaching is unlimited,  
The Saṅgha is unlimited.  
But creeping animals are limited:

32Snakes, scorpions, centipedes,  
Spiders, lizards, and mice.  
I’m now protected and guarded;  
May the creatures turn back.  
I pay homage to the Buddha,  
To the seven fully awakened Buddhas.”


33On one occasion a monk who was plagued by lust cut off his own penis. They told the Buddha. He said: “This fool has cut off one thing, when he should’ve cut off something else.

You shouldn’t cut off your own penis. If you do, you commit a serious offense.”

34On one occasion a wealthy merchant of Rājagaha had obtained a valuable block of sandalwood. He thought: “Why don’t I have a bowl carved from this block of sandal? I’d use the chips myself, but give the bowl away as a gift.” He then had a bowl carved, put it in a carrying net, hung it at the end of a succession of vertical bamboo poles, and announced: “I’ll give this bowl to any perfected monastic or brahmin who brings it down by supernormal power.”

Pūraṇa Kassapa went to that merchant and said: “I’m perfected and have supernormal powers. Give me the bowl.”

“If you’re perfected and have supernormal powers, then bring it down and it’s yours.”

The same thing happened with Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta, and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta.


35Soon afterwards, after robing up in the morning, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja took their bowls and robes and entered Rājagaha for alms. Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja said to Mahāmoggallāna: “Venerable, you’re perfected and have supernormal powers. If you go and bring down that bowl, it’s yours.”

“Venerable, you too are perfected and have supernormal powers. If you bring it down, it’s yours.”

Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja then rose into the air, took hold of that bowl, and circled around Rājagaha three times.

36Just then that merchant, together with his wives and children, was standing in his own house, raising his joined palms in homage, thinking: “May Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja land right here at our house.” And Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja did just that. The merchant then took the bowl from his hands, filled it with expensive fresh foods, and gave it back to Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja, who then left for the monastery.

People heard that Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja had taken down the merchant’s bowl, and making a great uproar, they followed right behind him.


37Hearing all the noise, the Buddha asked Venerable Ānanda what it was, and Ānanda told him what had happened.


38Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Saṅgha of monks gathered and questioned Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja:

“Is it true, Bhāradvāja, that you brought down that merchant’s bowl?”

“It’s true, Sir.”

The Buddha rebuked him: “It’s not suitable, Bhāradvāja, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you show a superhuman ability, a wonder of supernormal power, to householders for the sake of a miserable wooden bowl? It’s just like a woman showing her private parts for a miserable _māsaka_ coin. This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking him … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


“You shouldn’t show a superhuman ability, a wonder of supernormal power, to householders. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.

Now destroy that wooden bowl and make it into splinters. Give these to the monks to use as scent in ointments.

And you shouldn’t use a wooden bowl. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”


39At that time the monks from the group of six used luxurious bowls made with gold and silver. People complained and criticized them: “They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”

“You shouldn’t use almsbowls made with gold, silver, gems, beryl, crystal, bronze, glass, tin, lead, or copper. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow two kinds of almsbowls: iron bowls and ceramic bowls.”

There were thick bowl-rests on which the bowls did not sit properly.

“I allow you to carve them out.”

There were marks left from the carving.

“I allow you to cut a shark-teeth pattern.”


42Soon the monks from the group of six used colorful bowl-rests, decorated like walls. As they were walking about, they showed them off in the streets. People complained and criticized them: “They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”

“You shouldn’t use colorful bowl-rests, decorated like a wall. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow ordinary bowl-rests.”

43At this time there were monks who put away their bowls while still wet. The bowls were stained.

“You shouldn’t put away your bowl while still wet. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. You should sun your bowl and then put it away.”

44Soon afterwards there were monks who sunned their bowls while still wet. The bowls became smelly.

“You shouldn’t sun your bowl while still wet. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. You should dry the bowl and then sun it before you put it away.”


45Monks left their bowls in the heat of the sun. The bowls became discolored.

“You shouldn’t leave your bowl in the heat of the sun. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. You should sun it in the heat for a short time and then put it away.”

“You shouldn’t walk for alms with a water pot as bowl. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

58At that time a certain monk who only used discarded things used a skull as bowl. A woman who saw this was terrified, screaming: “Oh my God, a demon!” People complained and criticized him: “How can the Sakyan monastics use skulls as bowls? They’re just like goblins.”

“You shouldn’t use a skull as bowl. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. And you shouldn’t use only discarded things. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

75When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Vesālī. And so did the monks went, having put their needles, knives, and medicines in their almsbowls. They told the Buddha.

“I allow a medicine bag.”

There was no shoulder strap.

“I allow a shoulder strap and a string for fastening it.”

76On one occasion a certain monk bound his sandals to his belt and entered the village for alms. A lay follower who bowed to him hit his head against those sandals. The monk was embarrassed. When he had returned to the monastery, he told the monks what had happened, who in turn told the Buddha.

78On one occasion, there were two monks traveling through the Kosalan country. One monk misbehaved, and the second monk said to him: “Don’t do that. It’s not allowable.” Because of that, the first monk became resentful.

Soon afterwards the second monk was very thirsty. He asked the resentful monk to borrow his water filter. He refused and the second monk died from thirst. When the resentful monk arrived at the monastery, he told the monks what had happened.

“So you refused to lend your water filter when asked?”

“Yes.”


The monks of few desires complained and criticized him: “How could a monk do such a thing?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the monks gathered and questioned that monk:

“Is it true, monk, that you did this?”

“It’s true, Sir.”


The Buddha rebuked him: “It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you refuse to lend your water filter when asked? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking him … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“If you’re traveling with a monk and he asks to borrow your water filter, you should lend it. If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. On the other had, you shouldn’t travel without a water filter. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. If there’s no water filter or strainer, you should determine a corner of your robe: ‘I’ll drink after filtering with this.’”

The Buddha eventually arrived at Vesālī, where he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. At this time the monks were doing building work, but there were not enough water filters. They told the Buddha.

“I allow a water filter of cloth fitted to a wooden framework.”

There were still not enough filters.


“I allow you to filter by spreading cloth on water.”

79At this time the monks were troubled by mosquitoes.

“I allow a mosquito tent.”

##### 9.1 Walking-paths 

80At this time in Vesālī people had arranged a succession of fine meals. After eating the fine food, the monks were often sick, their bodies being full of impurities.

Just then Jīvaka Komārabhacca was in Vesālī on some business, and he saw those monks. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said: “At present, Sir, there are monks who are often sick, their bodies being full of impurities. It would be good if you would allow walking-meditation paths and saunas. In this way the monks will rarely get sick.” The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which Jīvaka got up from his seat, bowed, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“I allow walking-meditation paths and saunas.”


81Monks did walking meditation on uneven walking paths. As a result their feet hurt.

They told the Buddha.

It rained and the robes became wet.

88Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not do services for one another either in the sauna or in the water.

“I allow you to regard three things as a ‘covering’: a sauna, water, and a cloth.”

96At one time the monks from the group of six did not have sitting mats for a period of four months. They told the Buddha.

“You shouldn’t be without a sitting mat for a period of four months. If you are, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

97At that time the monks from the group of six slept in beds covered in flowers. When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them: “They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”

“You shouldn’t sleep in a bed covered in flowers. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

98Soon, people brought scents and garlands to the monastery. Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept.

“I allow you to accept scent to make the five-finger mark on your door and to accept flowers to place to one side in your dwelling.”

99On one occasion the Saṅgha was offered a piece of felt.

“I allow felt.”

The monks thought: “Should it be determined or assigned to another?”

“It should neither be determined nor assigned to another.”


100The monks from the group of six ate food on a stand with a heating device. People complained and criticized them: “They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”

“You shouldn’t eat food on a stand with a heating device. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

“I allow a stand.”


102At that time the monks from the group of six ate from the same vessel and drank from the same vessel, and they lay down on the same bed, on the same sheet, under the same cover, and both on the same sheet and under the same cover. People complained and criticized them: “They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”

“You shouldn’t eat from the same vessel, drink from the same vessel, lie down on the same bed, lie down on the same sheet, lie down under the same cover, or lie down both on the same sheet and under the same cover. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

103At one time Vaḍḍha the Licchavī was a friend of the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka. On one occasion he went to them and said: “Respectful greetings, Venerables.” They did not respond. A second time and a third time he said the same thing, but they still did not respond.


“Have I done something wrong? Why don’t you respond?”

“It’s because we’ve been treated badly by Dabba the Mallian, and you’re not taking an interest.”

“But what can I do?”


“If you like, you could make the Buddha expel Dabba.”

“And how can I do that?”


“Go to the Buddha and say, ‘Sir, this is not proper or appropriate. There’s fear, distress, and oppression in this district, where none of these should exist. It’s windy where it should be calm. It’s as if water is burning. Venerable Dabba the Mallian has raped my wife.’”


104Saying: “Alright, Venerables,” he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and repeated what he had been told to say.


105Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned Dabba: “Dabba, do you remember doing as Vaḍḍha says?”

“Venerable Sir, you know what I’m like.”


A second and a third time the Buddha asked the same question and got the same response. He then said: “Dabba, the Dabbas don’t give such evasive answers. If it was done by you, say so; if it wasn’t, then say that.”

“Since I was born, Sir, I don’t recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream, let alone when awake.”

The Buddha addressed the monks:


“Well then, monks, the Saṅgha should overturn the almsbowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Saṅgha.


106When a lay follower has eight qualities, you should overturn your bowl against him: he’s trying to stop monks from acquiring material gains; he’s trying to harm monks; he’s trying to get monks to lose their place of residence; he abuses and reviles monks; he causes division between monks; he disparages the Buddha; he disparages the Teaching; he disparages the Saṅgha.

And the overturning of the bowl is to be done like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:


107‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. Vaḍḍha the Licchavī is groundlessly charging Venerable Dabba the Mallian with failure in morality. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should overturn the bowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Saṅgha. This is the motion.

108Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. Vaḍḍha the Licchavī is groundlessly charging Venerable Dabba the Mallian with failure in morality. The Saṅgha overturns the bowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Saṅgha. Any monk who approves of overturning the bowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.

109The Saṅgha has overturned the bowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Saṅgha. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”

110After robing up the following morning, Venerable Ānanda took his bowl and robe, went to the house of Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, and told him: “Vaḍḍha, the Saṅgha has overturned the bowl against you. You’re prohibited from interacting with the Saṅgha.” And Vaḍḍha fainted right there. But Vaḍḍha’s friends and relatives said to him:

“Don’t be sad, Vaḍḍha. We’ll reconcile you with the Buddha and the Saṅgha of monks.”


111Soon afterwards Vaḍḍha, together with his wives and children, together with his friends and relatives, with wet clothes and wet hair, went to the Buddha. He bowed down at the Buddha’s feet and said: “Sir, I’ve made a mistake. I’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful. Please forgive me so that I may restrain myself in the future.”

“You have certainly made a mistake. You’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful. But since you acknowledge your mistake and make proper amends, I forgive you. For this is called growth in the training of the noble ones: acknowledging a mistake, making proper amends, and undertaking restraint in the future.”


The Buddha then addressed the monks:

“Well then, the Saṅgha should turn the almsbowl upright for Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, allowing him to interact with the Saṅgha.


112When a lay follower has eight qualities, you should turn your bowl upright for him: he’s not trying to stop monks from acquiring material gains; he’s not trying to harm monks; he’s not trying to get monks to lose their place of residence; he doesn’t abuse or revile monks; he doesn’t cause division between monks; he doesn’t disparage the Buddha; he doesn’t disparage the Teaching; he doesn’t disparage the Saṅgha.

And the turning of the bowl upright is to be done like this. Vaḍḍha the Licchavī should approach the Saṅgha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:

‘Venerables, the Saṅgha has overturned the bowl against me, prohibiting me from interacting with the Saṅgha. I’m now conducting myself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released. I ask the Saṅgha to turn the bowl upright for me.’ And he should ask a second and a third time. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha:


113‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The Saṅgha has overturned the bowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Saṅgha. He’s now conducting himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released, and is asking the Saṅgha to turn the bowl upright for him. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should turn the bowl upright for Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, allowing him to interact with the Saṅgha. This is the motion.

114Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The Saṅgha has overturned the bowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Saṅgha. He’s now conducting himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released, and is asking the Saṅgha to turn the bowl upright for him. The Saṅgha turns the bowl upright for Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, allowing him to interact with the Saṅgha. Any monk who approves of turning the bowl upright for Vaḍḍha the Licchavī should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.

115The Saṅgha has turned the bowl upright for Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, allowing him to interact with the Saṅgha. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”

116When the Buddha had stayed at Vesālī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward the country of Bhaggā. When he eventually arrived, he stayed at Susumāragira in the Bhesakaḷā Grove, the deer park.

At this time Prince Bodhi had recently built the Kokanada stilt house. It had not yet been inhabited by any monastic or brahmin, or anyone else.


The Prince said to the young brahmin Sañcikāputta: “My dear Sañcikāputta, please go to the Buddha, bow down in my name with your head at his feet, and ask if he’s healthy, strong, and living at ease. And then say, ‘Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal, together with the Saṅgha of monks, from Prince Bodhi.’”

Saying: “Yes, Sir,” Sañcikāputta went to the Buddha and exchanged pleasantries with him. He then sat down and told the Buddha all he had been asked to say, concluding with the invitation for the meal on the following day. The Buddha consented by remaining silent. Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Sañcikāputta got up from his seat, returned to the Prince, and told him what had happened.


117The next morning Prince Bodhi had various kinds of fine food prepared, and had the entire Kokanada stilt house covered with white cloth, all the way to the bottom step of the staircase. He then said to Sañcikāputta: “Go to the Buddha and tell him the meal is ready.” And Sañcikāputta did as instructed.


118Soon afterwards, the Buddha robed up in the morning, took his bowl and robe, and went the Prince’s house. The Prince was standing outside the gatehouse, waiting for the Buddha. When he saw the Buddha coming, he went out to meet him, bowed down to him, and then returned to the Kokanada stilt house with the Buddha in front.

But the Buddha stopped at the bottom stair of that staircase. The Prince said: “Sir, please step on the cloth. It will be for my longterm benefit and happiness.” The Buddha remained silent. A second time the Prince repeated his request, but the Buddha still remained silent. When the Prince made his request for the third time, the Buddha looked at Venerable Ānanda. And Ānanda said to the Prince: “Please fold up the cloth. The Buddha doesn’t step on cloth coverings. He has compassion for later generations.”

119The Prince then had the cloth folded up and had a seat prepared up in the stilt house. The Buddha ascended the house and sat down on the prepared seat together with the Saṅgha of monks. The Prince personally served the various kinds of fine food to the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal and had washed his hands and bowl, the Prince sat down to one side. The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which he got up from his seat and left.

Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“You shouldn’t step on a cloth covering. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

120On one occasion a woman who was unable to conceive invited the monks, prepared a cloth, and said: “Venerables, please step on the cloth.” But being afraid of wrongdoing, they refused. “Please step on the cloth as a blessing.” They still refused. That woman complained and criticized them: “How can the venerables not step on a cloth as a blessing when asked?” The monks heard the complaints of that woman, and they told the Buddha what had happened.

“Householders want blessings. I allow you, when asked, to step on a cloth covering as a blessing for householders.”


121Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not step on a towel after washing their feet.

“I allow you to step on a towel after washing your feet.”


122The second section for recitation is finished.

123When the Buddha had stayed in the country of Bhaggā for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī. When he eventually arrived, he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.

Soon Visākhā Migāramātā went to the Buddha, taking a water pot, a ceramic foot scrubber, and a broom. She bowed to the Buddha, sat down, and said: “Venerable Sir, for my longterm benefit and happiness, please accept this water pot, foot scrubber, and broom.” The Buddha accepted the water pot and the broom, but not the ceramic foot scrubber. He then instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching, after which she got up from her seat, bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left.


124Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“I allow water pots and brooms. But you shouldn’t use a ceramic foot scrubber. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow three kinds of foot scrubbers: stones, pebbles, and pumice.”

125Visākhā again went to the Buddha, now taking an standard fan and a palm-leaf fan. She bowed, sat down, and said: “Venerable Sir, for my longterm benefit and happiness, please accept this standard fan and this palm-leaf fan.” The Buddha accepted both.


126He then instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching, after which she got up from her seat, bowed, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“I allow standard fans and a palm-leaf fans.”


127On one occasion the Saṅgha was offered a mosquito whisk.

“I allow mosquito whisks.”

The Saṅgha was offered a yak-tail whisk.


“You shouldn’t use a yak-tail whisk. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow three kinds of fans: those made of bark, Vetiver grass, and peacocks’ tail feathers.”

128On one occasion the Saṅgha was offered a sunshade.

“I allow sunshades.”


129Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six walked about holding sunshades. Then, as a certain Buddhist lay follower and a number of Ājīvaka disciples were going to the park, the Ājīvakas saw those monks in the distance with their sunshades. They said to that lay follower: “These venerables of yours are coming. They’re holding sunshades, just like accountants and government officials.”

“These aren’t monks. They’re wanderers.” And they made a bet on whether they were monks or not.

When the monks came close, that lay follower recognized them. And he complained and criticized them: “How can the venerables walk about holding sunshades?” The monks heard the complaints of that lay follower and they told the Buddha.

“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are doing this?” “It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“You shouldn’t use a sunshade. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”


130Soon afterwards a certain sick monk was not comfortable without a sunshade.

“I allow sick monks to use sunshades.”


131When they heard that the Buddha had allowed sunshades for the sick, but not for the healthy, and being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not use sunshades in the monastery or in the vicinity of the monastery.

“I allow you to use a sunshade in a monastery and in the vicinity of a monastery, even if you’re healthy.”

132On one occasion a monk put his almsbowl in a carrying net, hung it from a staff, and passed through the gateway to a certain village at an unusual hour. People said: “This must be a gangster coming with his gleaming sword.” They pounced and seized him, but when they recognized him, they let him go.

He returned to the monastery and told the monks what had happened. They said: “So you used a carrying net and a staff?”

“Yes.”

The monks of few desires complained and criticized him: “How can a monk use a carrying net and a staff?” They told the Buddha … “It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking him … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“You shouldn’t use a carrying net and a staff. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”


133On one occasion there was a sick monk who was unable to walk about without a staff.

“I allow you to give a sick monk permission to use a staff.


And it should be given like this. The sick monk should approach the Saṅgha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:

‘Venerables, I’m sick. I’m unable to walk about without a staff. I ask the Saṅgha for permission to use a staff.’ And he should ask a second and a third time. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha:

134‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. Monk so-and-so is sick. He’s unable to walk about without a staff. He’s asking the Saṅgha for permission to use a staff. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, it should give monk so-and-so permission to use a staff. This is the motion.

135Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. Monk so-and-so is sick. He’s unable to walk about without a staff. He’s asking the Saṅgha for permission to use a staff. The Saṅgha gives monk so-and-so permission to use a staff. Any monk who approves of this should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.

136The Saṅgha has given monk so-and-so permission to use a staff. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”


137On one occasion there was a sick monk who was unable to carry his almsbowl without a carrying-net. They told the Buddha.

“I allow you to give a sick monk permission to use a a carrying-net.

And it should be given like this. The sick monk should approach the Saṅgha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:

‘Venerables, I’m sick. I’m unable to carry my bowl without a carrying-net. I ask the Saṅgha for permission to use a carrying-net.’ And he should ask a second and a third time. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha:

138‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. Monk so-and-so is sick. He’s unable to carry his bowl without a carrying-net. He’s asking the Saṅgha for permission to use a carrying-net. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, it should give monk so-and-so permission to use a carrying-net. This is the motion.

140The Saṅgha has given monk so-and-so permission to use a carrying-net. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”

141On one occasion there was a sick monk who was unable to walk about without a staff or to carry his almsbowl without a carrying-net. They told the Buddha.

“I allow you to give a sick monk permission to use a staff and a carrying-net.

And it should be given like this. The sick monk should approach the Saṅgha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:

145At that time there was a monk who was a regurgitator. After regurgitating, he would swallow. The monks complained and criticized him: “This monk is eating at the wrong time.” They told the Buddha.

“This monk has only recently passed away as a cow. I allow a regurgitator to regurgitate. But you shouldn’t take it out of the mouth and then swallow it. If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.”

146Soon afterwards a certain association was offering a meal to the Saṅgha. Lots of rice fell on the floor in the dining hall. People complained and criticized them: “When they’re given rice, how can the Sakyan monastics not receive it with care? Each lump of rice is the result of hard work.” The monks heard the complaints of those people. They told the Buddha.

“I allow you to pick up and eat what falls down while being given. It has been relinquished by the donors.”

147On one occasion a certain monk with long nails was walking for alms. A woman who saw him said to him: “Come, Venerable, and have sex.”

“It’s not allowable.”

“If you don’t, I’ll scratch my limbs with my nails and make a scene, saying that you abused me.”

“That’s your business, sister.”

Yet that woman did as she had threatened. People rushed up and took hold of that monk. But when they saw the skin and blood on that woman’s nails, they realized she had done it herself, and they released the monk. He then returned to the monastery and told the monks what had happened.

“So you grow your nails long?”

183At this time there were two monks called Yameḷa and Kekuṭa, brothers born into a brahmin family, who were well-spoken and had good voices. They went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said: “Venerable Sir, the monks now have a variety of names, and come from a variety of families, castes, and households. They corrupt the word of the Buddha by using their own expressions. Now we could give metrical form to the word of the Buddha.”

The Buddha rebuked them: “Foolish men, how can you suggest such a thing? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“You shouldn’t give metrical form to the word of the Buddha. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. You should learn the word of the Buddha using its own expressions.”

“No, Sir.”

“You shouldn’t say, ‘May you live long!’ to one who sneezes. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

190On one occasion when the Buddha was seated teaching a large gathering, there was a monk who had eaten garlic. Not to annoy the other monks, he was sitting at a distance. The Buddha saw him and asked the monks why he was sitting there. The monks told him and the Buddha said,

195At one time the monks from the group of six were misbehaving in many ways.

They planted flowering trees, watered and plucked them, and then tied the flowers together. They made the flowers into garlands, garlands with stalks on one side and garlands with stalks on both sides. They made flower arrangements, wreaths, ornaments for the head, ornaments for the ears, and ornaments for the chest. And they had others do the same. They then took these things, or sent them, to the women, the daughters, the girls, the daughters-in-law, and the female slaves of respectable families.

They ate from the same plates as these women and drank from the same vessels. They sat on the same seats as them, and they lay down on the same beds, on the same sheets, under the same covers, and both on the same sheets and under the same covers. They ate at the wrong time, drank alcohol, and wore garlands, perfumes, and cosmetics. They danced, sang, played instruments, and performed.

A wise one, lighting a lamp—  
This is a learned one worthy of homage.
