1At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time newly arrived monks entered the monastery wearing sandals, holding sunshades, with their heads covered, with their robes on their heads; and they washed their feet with drinking water, did not bow down to the more senior resident monks, and did not ask about dwellings. A certain newly arrived monk unlocked the bolt of an unoccupied dwelling, opened the door, and entered hastily. A snake fell from the top of the door frame onto his shoulders. Terrified, he screamed. The monks came running and asked why he was screaming. And he told them.

2The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the newly arrived monks enter the monastery wearing sandals, holding sunshades, with their heads covered, with their robe on their head; and wash their feet with drinking water, not bow down to the more senior resident monks, and not ask about dwellings?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks:

“Is it true, monks, that the newly arrived monks act like this?”


“It’s true, Sir.” The Buddha rebuked them …

“How can the newly arrived monks act like this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


3“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for newly arrived monks.

When a newly arrived monk enters a monastery, he should remove his sandals, hold them low, knock them together, and carry them along; he should lower his sunshade, uncover his head, and put his robe over his shoulders; he should then enter the monastery carefully and without hurry. As he enters the monastery, he should look out for where the resident monks gather whether it’s in the assembly hall, under a roof-cover, or at the foot of a tree and he should go there. He should then put his bowl and robe aside, and sit down on a suitable seat. He should ask which is the water for drinking and which the water for washing. If he needs water to drink, he may take some and drink. If he needs water to wash, he may take some and wash his feet. When he washes his feet, he should pour the water with one hand and wash with the other. He should not pour the water and wash his feet with the same hand. He should ask for a sandal-wiping cloth, and then wipe them. When he wipes his sandals, he should first wipe them with a dry cloth, then a wet one. He should wash the cloth and put it aside.

4If a resident monk is more senior, the newly arrived monk should bow down to him. If a resident monk is more junior, he should bow down to the newly arrived monk. The newly arrived monk should ask which dwelling he may use and whether it’s occupied or not. He should ask about where to go for alms and where to avoid, about any families designated as “in training”, about the place for defecating and the place for urinating, about the water for drinking and the water for washing, about walking sticks, and about the Saṅgha’s agreements concerning the right time to enter and the right time to leave.

If the dwelling is unoccupied, he should knock on the door, wait for a moment, then unlock the bolt, open the door, and look inside while standing outside.

5If the dwelling is dirty, and if beds or benches are stacked on top of one another with furniture in a pile on top, he should clean it if he is able. When he is cleaning the dwelling, he should first take out the floor cover and put it aside. He should take out the bed supports and put them aside. He should take out the mattress and the pillow and put them aside. He should take out the sitting mat and the sheet and put them aside. Holding the bed low, he should carefully take it out without scratching it or knocking it against the door or the door frame, and he should put it aside. Holding the bench low, he should carefully take it out without scratching it or knocking it against the door or the door frame, and he should put it aside. He should take out the spittoon and put it aside. He should take out the leaning board and put it aside. If the dwelling has cobwebs, he should first remove them from the ceiling cloth, and he should then wipe the windows and the corners of the room. If the walls have been treated with red ocher and they’re moldy, he should moisten a cloth, wring it out, and wipe the walls. If the floor has been treated with a black finish and it’s moldy, he should moisten a cloth, wring it out, and wipe the floor. If the floor is untreated, he should sprinkle it with water and then sweep it, while trying to avoid stirring up dust. He should look out for any trash and discard it.

6He should sun the floor cover, clean it, beat it, bring it back inside, and put it back as before. He should sun the bed supports, wipe them, bring them back inside, and put them back where they were. He should sun the bed, clean it, and beat it. Holding it low, he should carefully bring it back inside without scratching it or knocking it against the door or the door frame, and he should put as before. He should sun the bench, clean it, and beat it. Holding it low, he should carefully bring it back inside without scratching it or knocking it against the door or the door frame, and he should put it back as before. He should sun the mattress and the pillow, clean them, beat them, bring them back inside, and put them back as before. He should sun the sitting mat and the sheet, clean them, beat them, bring them back inside, and put them back as before. He should sun the spittoon, wipe it, bring it back inside, and put it back where it was. He should sun the leaning board, wipe it, bring it back inside, and put it back where it was.

He should put away the bowl and robe. When putting away the bowl, he should hold the bowl in one hand, feel under the bed or the bench with the other, and then put it away. He shouldn’t put the bowl away on the bare floor. When putting away the robe, he should hold the robe in one hand, wipe the bamboo robe rack or the clothesline with the other, and then put it away by folding the robe over it, making the ends face the wall and the fold face out.

7If dusty winds are blowing from the east, he should close the windows on the eastern side. If dusty winds are blowing from the west, he should close the windows on the western side. If dusty winds are blowing from the north, he should close the windows on the northern side. If dusty winds are blowing from the south, he should close the windows on the southern side. If the weather is cold, he should open the windows during the day and close them at night. If the weather is hot, he should close the windows during the day and open them at night.

8If the yard is dirty, he should sweep it. If the gateway is dirty, he should sweep it. If the assembly hall is dirty, he should sweep it. If the water-boiling shed is dirty, he should sweep it. If the restroom is dirty, he should sweep it. If there is no water for drinking, he should get some. If there is no water for washing, he should get some. If there is no water in the rinsing pot, he should fill it.

This is the proper conduct for newly arrived monks.”

9At that time, when they saw newly arrived monks, the resident monks did not prepare seats, or put out foot stools, foot scrapers, or water for washing the feet. They did not go out to meet them to receive their bowls and robes, or ask if they wanted water to drink. They did not bow down to more senior newly arrived monks or assign dwellings to them.

The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the resident monks act like this?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks:


“Is it true, monks, that the resident monks are acting like this?”

“It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


10“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for resident monks.

When a resident monk sees a newly arrived monk who is more senior, he should prepare a seat, and put out a foot stool, a foot scraper, and water for washing the feet. He should go out to meet him to receive his bowl and robe, and ask if he wants water to drink. If he is able, he should wipe his sandals, first with a dry cloth and then a wet one. He should wash the cloth and put it aside.

11If the newly arrived monk is more senior, the resident monk should bow down to him. He should assign a dwelling, tell him where it is, and inform him whether it’s occupied or not. He should tell him where to go for alms and where to avoid, and about any families designated as ‘in training’. He should point out the place for defecating and the place for urinating, the water for drinking and the water for washing, and the walking sticks. He should tell him about the Saṅgha’s agreements concerning the right time to enter and the right time to leave.

12If the newly arrived monk is more junior, the resident monk should remain seated while telling him where to put his bowl and robe, and which seat to sit on. He should point out the water for drinking and the water for washing, as well as a sandal-wiping cloth.

If the newly arrived monk is more junior, he should bow down to the resident monk. The resident monk should tell him where his dwelling is and whether it’s occupied or not. He should tell him where to go for alms and where to avoid, and about any families designated as ‘in training’. He should point out the place for defecating and the place for urinating, the water for drinking and the water for washing, and the walking sticks. He should tell him about the Saṅgha’s agreements concerning the right time to enter and the right time to leave.

This is the proper conduct for resident monks.”

#### 3. Discussion of the proper conduct for departing monks ^3

13At that time there were monks who departed without putting the wooden and ceramic goods in order, while leaving the door and the windows open, and without informing anyone. Wooden and ceramic goods were lost and the dwelling was unprotected.

The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the departing monks act like this?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the departing monks are acting like this?” “It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


14“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for departing monks.

Before he departs, a monk should put the wooden and ceramic goods in order, close the door and the windows, and inform someone. If there are no monks, he should inform a novice monk; if there are no novice monks, he should inform a monastery worker; if there are no monastery workers, he should inform of a lay follower. If there are no monks, novice monks, monastery workers, or lay followers, he should place the bed on four rocks. He should stack the beds or benches on top of one another, with the furniture in a pile on top, and put away the wooden and ceramic goods. He should close the door and the windows, and then depart.

If rain enters the dwelling, he should cover it if he is able, or he should make an effort to have it covered. If this works out, all is well. If not, he should place the bed on four rocks in an area that isn’t getting wet. He should then stack the beds or benches on top of one another, with the furniture in a pile on top, and put away the wooden and ceramic goods. He should close the door and the windows, and then depart. If the whole dwelling is getting wet, he should carry the furniture to the village if he is able, or he should make an effort to have it carried to the village. If this works out, all is well. If not, he should place the bed on four rocks outside. He should then stack the beds or benches on top of one another, with the furniture in a pile on top, and he should put away the wooden and ceramic goods. He should cover it all with grass and leaves and then depart, thinking, ‘Hopefully the requisites will be okay.’

This is the proper conduct for departing monks.”

#### 4. Discussion of the proper conduct in connection with the expression of appreciation ^4

15At that time there were monks who did not express their appreciation in the dining hall. People complained and criticized them: “How can the Sakyan monastics not express their appreciation in the dining hall?” The monks heard the complaints of those people and they told the Buddha. The Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“You should express your appreciation in the dining hall.”

The monks thought: “Who should give the expression of appreciation?” They told the Buddha. He gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“The most senior monk should give the expression of appreciation in the dining hall.”


16Soon afterwards a certain association was offering a meal to the Saṅgha. Venerable Sāriputta was the most senior monk. Because the Buddha had said the most senior monk should give the expression of appreciation, the monks left, leaving Sāriputta behind by himself. After giving the expression of appreciation, he left by himself. The Buddha saw him coming and asked: “Did the meal go well?”

“The meal went well, Venerable Sir, but the monks all left leaving me behind by myself.” Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“The four or five most senior monks should wait in the dining hall.”

17On one occasion a senior monk who needed to defecate was waiting in the dining hall. Being unable to hold out, he fainted and fell over. They told the Buddha.

“When there is something to be done, I allow you to go after informing the monk sitting next to you.”

18At that time the monks from the group of six went to the dining hall shabbily dressed and improper in appearance; going the wrong way, they went ahead of the senior monks; they sat down encroaching on the senior monks; they blocked the junior monks from seats; and they spread out their upper robes and sat on them in inhabited areas.

The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks from the group of six act like this?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks:

“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are acting like this?”


“It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


19“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct in relation to the dining hall.

In a monastery where the time for departure is announced, a monk should put on his sarong evenly all around, covering the navel and the knees. He should put on a belt. Putting the upper robes together, overlapping each other edge-to-edge, he should put them on and fasten the toggle. He should wash his bowl, bring it along, and enter the village carefully and without hurry.

20He should not go the wrong way and walk in front of the senior monks. He should walk well-covered in inhabited areas; he should walk well-restrained in inhabited areas; he should walk with lowered eyes in inhabited areas; he should lift up his robe while walking in inhabited areas; he should not laugh loudly while walking in inhabited areas; he should not be noisy while walking in inhabited areas; he should not sway his body while walking in inhabited areas; he should not swing his arms while walking in inhabited areas; he should not sway his head while walking in inhabited areas; he should not walk in an inhabited area with his hands on his hips; he should not cover his head while walking in inhabited areas; he should not squat on his heels while walking in inhabited areas.

He should not sit encroaching on the senior monks or blocking the junior monks from seats. He should not spread out his upper robe and sit on it in inhabited areas.

22When given water, he should receive it by holding his bowl with both hands. Holding the bowl low, he should rinse it carefully without scratching it. If there is someone to receive the water, he should hold his bowl low and pour the water into the container, trying to avoid splashing the person receiving the water, the monks sitting nearby, or his upper robe. If there is no one to receive the water, he should hold his bowl low and pour the water on the ground, trying to avoid splashing the monks sitting nearby or his upper robe.

23When given rice, he should receive it by holding his bowl with both hands, leaving room for the curry. If there is ghee, oil, or special curry, the senior monk should say, ‘Everyone gets an equal share.’ He should receive the almsfood respectfully; he should receive the almsfood with attention on the bowl; he should receive the almsfood with the right proportion of bean curry; he should receive the almsfood on an even level.

24The senior monk should not start eating until everyone has received rice.

25He should not receive the drinking-water vessel with a hand soiled with food.

The senior monk should not receive water for washing until all the monks are finished eating. When given water, a monk should receive it by holding his bowl with both hands. Holding the bowl low, he should rinse it carefully without scratching it. If there is someone to receive the water, he should hold his bowl low and pour the water into the container, trying to avoid splashing the person receiving the water, the monks sitting nearby, or his upper robe. If there is no one to receive the water, he should hold his bowl low and pour the water on the ground, trying to avoid splashing the monks sitting nearby or his upper robe. He should not discard bowl-washing water containing rice in inhabited areas.

26When returning, the junior monks should go first and then the senior monks. A monk should be well-covered when walking in inhabited areas; he should be well-restrained when walking in inhabited areas; he should walk with lowered eyes in inhabited areas; he should not walk with his robe lifted up in inhabited areas; he should not laugh loudly when walking in inhabited areas; he should not be noisy when walking in inhabited areas; he should not sway his body when walking in inhabited areas; he should not swing his arms when walking in inhabited areas; he should not sway his head when walking in inhabited areas; he should not walk in an inhabited area with his hands on his hips; he should not walk with his head covered in inhabited areas; he should not squat on his heels when walking in inhabited areas.

This is the proper conduct in relation to the dining hall.”

28At that time there were alms-collecting monks who were shabbily dressed and improper in appearance. They entered and left houses without being attentive; they entered and left too hastily; they stood too far away or too close; they waited too long or left too soon.

On one occasion a certain monk entered a house without being attentive. Thinking it was the main door, he entered a room where a woman was sleeping naked. The monk saw her and left the room. Seeing her lying there, the woman’s husband thought: “My wife has been raped by this monk,” and he took hold of that monk and gave him a beating. The woman woke up from the noise and asked her husband: “Why are you beating this monk?”

“Didn’t he rape you?”

“No he didn’t; he didn’t do anything.” And she had him release that monk.

The monk returned to the monastery and told the monks what had happened.


29The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the alms-collecting monks act like this?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the alms-collecting monks are acting like this?”

“It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


30“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for alms-collecting monks.

When an alms-collecting monk is about to enter the village, he should put on his sarong evenly all around, covering the navel and the knees. He should put on a belt. Putting the upper robes together, overlapping each other edge-to-edge, he should put them on and fasten the toggle. He should wash his bowl, bring it along, and enter the village carefully and without hurry.

31He should be well-covered when walking in inhabited areas; he should be well-restrained when walking in inhabited areas; he should walk with lowered eyes in inhabited areas; he should not walk with his robe lifted up in inhabited areas; he should not laugh loudly when walking in inhabited areas; he should not be noisy when walking in inhabited areas; he should not sway his body when walking in inhabited areas; he should not swing his arms when walking in inhabited areas; he should not sway his head when walking in inhabited areas; he should not walk in an inhabited area with his hands on his hips; he should not walk with his head covered in inhabited areas; he should not squat on his heels when walking in inhabited areas.

32When entering a house, he should be attentive to where to enter and where to leave. He should not enter or leave too hastily; he should not stand too far away or too close; he should not wait too long or leave too soon. While waiting, he should be attentive to whether they wish to give alms or not. If they put down their work, get up from their seat, take hold of a serving spoon or a vessel, or they tell him to wait, then he should assume they wish to give, and he should wait. When they give him almsfood, he should lift up his upper robe with his left hand, stretch out his bowl with his right hand, and receive the alms while holding the bowl with both hands. He should not look the donor in the face. He should be attentive to whether they wish to give curry or not. If they take hold of a serving spoon or a vessel, or they tell him to wait, then he should assume they wish to give, and he should wait. When they have given alms, he should cover the bowl with his upper robe, and leave carefully and without hurry.

33He should be well-covered when walking in inhabited areas; he should be well-restrained when walking in inhabited areas; he should walk with lowered eyes in inhabited areas; he should not walk with his robe lifted up in inhabited areas; he should not laugh loudly when walking in inhabited areas; he should not be noisy when walking in inhabited areas; he should not sway his body when walking in inhabited areas; he should not swing his arms when walking in inhabited areas; he should not sway his head when walking in inhabited areas; he should not walk in an inhabited area with his hands on his hips; he should not walk with his head covered in inhabited areas; he should not squat on his heels when walking in inhabited areas.


“Whoever returns first from alms round in the village should prepare the seats and set out a foot stool, a foot scraper, and water for washing the feet. He should wash the bowl for leftovers and put it back out, and set out water for drinking and water for washing.

Whoever returns last from alms round may eat whatever is leftover, or he should discard it where there are no cultivated plants or in water without life. He should put away the seats and also the foot stool, the foot scraper, and the water for washing the feet. He should wash the bowl for leftovers and put it away, put away the water for drinking and the water for washing, and sweep the dining hall.

Whoever sees that the pot for drinking water, the pot for washing water, or the water pot in the restroom is empty should fill it. If he can’t do it by himself, he should call someone over by hand signal and they should fill it together. He should not speak because of that.

This is the proper conduct for alms-collectors.”

34At that time there was a number of monks staying in the wilderness. They did not set out water for drinking or water for washing; they did not light fires or provide fire-making implements; and they did not know the constellations or the cardinal directions.

Criminals went to that place and asked the monks: “Sir, is there any water for drinking?”


“No, there isn’t.”

“Is there any water for washing?”

“No.”


“Is there a fire?”

“No.”


“Are there any fire-making implements?”


“No.”

“Which constellation is the moon in today?”

“We don’t know.”

“Which direction is this?”

“We don’t know.”


Thinking: “They are criminals, not monks,” they beat them up and left.

The monks told other monks what had happened and they in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


35“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for monks staying in the wilderness.

After getting up early in the morning, a monk who is staying in the wilderness should put his bowl in its bag, hang it from his shoulder, put his robe over his shoulders, put on his sandals, put the wooden and ceramic goods in order, close the door and windows, and descend from his dwelling. When he is about to enter the village, he should remove his sandals, hold them low and knock them together, before putting them in a bag, which he should hang from his shoulder. He should put on his sarong evenly all around, covering the navel and the knees. He should put on a belt. Putting the upper robes together, overlapping each other edge-to-edge, he should put them on and fasten the toggle. He should wash his bowl, bring it along, and enter the village carefully and without hurry.


He should be well-covered when walking in inhabited areas; he should be well-restrained when walking in inhabited areas; he should walk with lowered eyes in inhabited areas; he should not walk with his robe lifted up in inhabited areas; he should not laugh loudly when walking in inhabited areas; he should not be noisy when walking in inhabited areas; he should not sway his body when walking in inhabited areas; he should not swing his arms when walking in inhabited areas; he should not sway his head when walking in inhabited areas; he should not walk in an inhabited area with his hands on his hips; he should not walk with his head covered in inhabited areas; he should not squat on his heels when walking in inhabited areas.


36When entering a house, he should be attentive to where to enter and where to leave. He should not enter or leave too hastily; he should not stand too far away or too close; he should not wait too long or leave too soon. While waiting, he should be attentive to whether they wish to give alms or not. If they put down their work, get up from their seat, take hold of a serving spoon or a vessel, or they tell him to wait, then he should assume they wish to give, and he should wait. When they give him almsfood, he should lift up his upper robe with his left hand, stretch out his bowl with his right hand, and receive the alms while holding the bowl with both hands. He should not look the donor in the face. He should be attentive to whether they wish to give curry or not. If they take hold of a serving spoon or a vessel, or they tell him to wait, then he should assume they wish to give, and he should wait. When they have given alms, he should cover the bowl with his upper robe, and return carefully and without hurry.


37He should be well-covered when walking in inhabited areas; he should be well-restrained when walking in inhabited areas; he should walk with lowered eyes in inhabited areas; he should not walk with his robe lifted up in inhabited areas; he should not laugh loudly when walking in inhabited areas; he should not be noisy when walking in inhabited areas; he should not sway his body when walking in inhabited areas; he should not swing his arms when walking in inhabited areas; he should not sway his head when walking in inhabited areas; he should not walk in an inhabited area with his hands on his hips; he should not walk with his head covered in inhabited areas; he should not squat on his heels when walking in inhabited areas. When he has left the village, he should put his bowl in its bag and hang it from his shoulder, fold up his robe and put it on his head, and put on his sandals and go.


38A monk who is staying in the wilderness should set out water for drinking and water for washing; he should light a fire and provide fire-making implements; he should provide a walking stick; and he should learn the constellations all of them or those in one direction—and become skilled in the cardinal directions.

This is the proper conduct for those staying in the wilderness.”

39On one occasion when a number of monks were making robes outside, the monks from the group of six were beating furniture in an open space upwind from them. The robe-making monks became dusty.

The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks from the group of six do this?”


40They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six did this?”

“It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


41“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct in regard to dwellings.

If the dwelling he is staying in is dirty, a monk should clean it if he is able. When he is cleaning the dwelling, he should first take out the bowl and robe and put them aside. He should take out the sitting mat and the sheet and put them aside. He should take out the mattress and the pillow and put them aside. Holding the bed low, he should carefully take it out without scratching it or knocking it against the door or the door frame, and he should put it aside.

He should take out the bed supports and put them aside. He should take out the spittoon and put it aside. He should take out the leaning board and put it aside. After taking note of its position, he should take out the floor cover and put it aside. If the dwelling has cobwebs, he should first remove them from the ceiling cloth, and he should then wipe the windows and the corners of the room. If the walls have been treated with red ocher and they’re moldy, he should moisten a cloth, wring it out, and wipe the walls. If the floor has been treated with a black finish and it’s moldy, he should moisten a cloth, wring it out, and wipe the floor. If the floor is untreated, he should sprinkle it with water and then sweep it, while trying to avoid stirring up dust. He should look out for any trash and discard it.

42He should not beat the furniture near other monks, near other dwellings, near water for drinking, or near water for washing. He should not beat the furniture in an open area upwind from these things, but downwind from them.

43He should sun the floor cover, clean it, beat it, bring it back inside, and put it back as before. He should sun the bed supports, wipe them, bring them back inside, and put them back where they were. He should sun the bed, clean it, and beat it. Holding it low, he should carefully bring it back inside without scratching it or knocking it against the door or the door frame, and he should put it back as before. He should sun the bench, clean it, and beat it. Holding it low, he should carefully bring it back inside without scratching it or knocking it against the door or the door frame, and he should put it back as before.

He should sun the spittoon, wipe it, bring it back inside, and put it back where it was. He should sun the leaning board, wipe it, bring it back inside, and put it back where it was. He should put away the bowl and robe. When putting away the bowl, he should hold the bowl in one hand, feel under the bed or the bench with the other, and then put it away. He shouldn’t put the bowl away on the bare floor. When putting away the robe, he should hold the robe in one hand, wipe the bamboo robe rack or the clothesline with the other, and then put it away by folding the robe over it, making the ends face the wall and the fold face out.

44If dusty winds are blowing from the east, he should close the windows on the eastern side. If dusty winds are blowing from the west, he should close the windows on the western side. If dusty winds are blowing from the north, he should close the windows on the northern side. If dusty winds are blowing from the south, he should close the windows on the southern side. If the weather is cold, he should open the windows during the day and close them at night. If the weather is hot, he should close the windows during the day and open them at night.

45If the yard is dirty, he should sweep it. If the gateway is dirty, he should sweep it. If the assembly hall is dirty, he should sweep it. If the water-boiling shed is dirty, he should sweep it. If the restroom is dirty, he should sweep it. If there is no water for drinking, he should get some. If there is no water for washing, he should get some. If there is no water in the rinsing pot, he should fill it.

46If he is staying in the same dwelling as a more senior monk, he should not do any of the following without asking him for permission: recite, question, rehearse, teach, turn a lamp on or off, or open or close a window. If he is doing walking meditation on the same walking path as a more senior monk, he should walk behind him, but he should not hit him with the corners of his robe.

This is the proper conduct in regard to dwellings.”

47On one occasion the monks from the group of six were kept out of the sauna by the senior monks. Then, out of disrespect, they stacked up much firewood, lit it, closed the door, and sat down against it. The monks overheated, but being unable to open the door, they fainted and collapsed.

The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks from the group of six do this?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six did this?”


“It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“If you’re kept out of a sauna by senior monks, you should not, out of disrespect, stack up much firewood and light it. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.

And you should not close the door and sit down against it. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.


48Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct in regard to saunas. The monk who goes first to the sauna should discard the ashes if they are building up. If the sauna is dirty, he should sweep it. If the area immediately outside the sauna is dirty, he should sweep it. If the yard is dirty, he should sweep it. If the gateway is dirty, he should sweep it. If the sauna shed is dirty, he should sweep it.

49He should knead bath powder, moisten the clay, and fill the water trough with water. When entering the sauna, he should smear his face with clay, cover himself front and back, and then enter. He shouldn’t sit encroaching on the senior monks, and he shouldn’t block the junior monks from getting a seat.

If he is able, he should do services for the senior monks in the sauna. When leaving the sauna, he should take the sauna bench, cover himself front and back, and then leave.

If he is able, he should also do services for the senior monks in the water. He should not bathe in front of the senior monks or upstream from them. When he is coming out of the water after bathing, he should give way to those who are entering the water.

If the sauna is muddy, the last monk to leave it should wash it. He should wash the clay trough, put away the sauna bench, extinguish the fire, close the door, and then leave.

This is the proper conduct in regard to saunas.”

50At that time a monk who had been born as a brahmin did not want to rinse after defecating, thinking: “Who would touch this foul, stinking stuff?” As a result, a worm settled in his anus. He told the monks, who said: “So you don’t rinse after defecating?”


“That’s right.”

The monks of few desires complained and criticized him: “How can a monk not rinse after defecating?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monk, that you don’t rinse after defecating?” “It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


“When there is water available, you should rinse after defecating. If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

51At that time the monks used the restroom according to seniority. Junior monks who had arrived before others had to wait to defecate. Holding it in, they fainted and collapsed. They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that this is happening?” “It’s true, Sir.” … and the Buddha addressed the monks:

“The restroom should not be used according to seniority. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. You should use the restroom according to the order of arrival.”


52At that time the monks from the group of six entered the restroom too hastily, pulled up their robe before entering, groaned while defecating, cleaned their teeth while defecating, defecated outside the toilet, urinated outside the urinal, spat in the urinal, used coarse wiping sticks, threw the wiping sticks in the cesspit, left the restroom too hastily, came out with their robe still pulled up, made a chomping sound while rinsing, and they left water in the scoop for rinsing.

The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks from the group of six act like this?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six act like this?” “It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


53“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct in regard to restrooms.

When a monk goes to the restroom, he should stand outside and clear his throat. Anyone sitting inside should also clear his throat. After hanging his robe from a bamboo robe rack or a clothesline, he should enter the restroom carefully and without hurry. He should not enter the restroom too hastily; he should not pull up his robe before he has entered; he should pull up his robe when he is standing on the foot-stands for defecating; he should not groan while defecating; he should not clean his teeth while defecating; he should not defecate outside the toilet; he should not urinate outside the urinal; he should not spit in the urinal; he should not use coarse wiping sticks; he should not throw the wiping sticks in the cesspit; he should cover himself while still standing on the foot-stands for defecating; he should not leave the restroom too hastily; he should not come out with his robe still pulled up; he should pull up his robe when standing on the foot-stands for rinsing; he should not make a chomping sound while rinsing; he should not leave water in the scoop for rinsing; he should cover himself while still standing on the foot-stands for rinsing.

54If the restroom is stained by feces, he should clean it. If the wiping-stick container is full, he should discard the wiping sticks. If the restroom is dirty, he should sweep it. If the area immediately outside the restroom is dirty, he should sweep it. If the yard is dirty, he should sweep it. If the gateway is dirty, he should sweep it. If there is no water in the pot for rinsing water, he should fill it.

This is the proper conduct in regard to restrooms.”

55At that time the students were not conducting themselves properly toward their preceptors. The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the students not conduct themselves properly toward their preceptors?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the students are not conducting themselves properly toward their preceptors?” “It’s true, Sir.” … The Buddha rebuked them …

“How can they act like this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


56“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for a student toward his preceptor. A student should conduct himself properly toward his preceptor. This is the proper conduct:

57Having gotten up at the appropriate time, the student should remove his sandals and put his upper robe over one shoulder. He should then give his preceptor a tooth cleaner and water for rinsing the mouth, and he should prepare a seat for him. If there is rice porridge, he should wash a vessel and bring the rice porridge to his preceptor. When the preceptor has drunk the rice porridge, the student should give him water and receive the vessel. Holding it low, he should wash it carefully without scratching it and then put it away. When the preceptor has gotten up, the student should put away the seat. If the place is dirty, he should sweep it.

58If the preceptor wants to enter the village, the student should give him a sarong and receive the one he’s wearing in return. He should give him a belt. He should put the upper robes together, overlapping each other edge-to-edge, and then give them to him. He should wash his preceptor’s bowl and give it to him while wet. If the preceptor wants an attendant, the student should put on his sarong evenly all around, covering the navel and the knees. He should put on a belt. Putting the upper robes together, overlapping each other edge-to-edge, he should put them on and fasten the toggle. He should wash his bowl, bring it along, and be his preceptor’s attendant.

He shouldn’t walk too far behind his preceptor or too close to him. He should receive the contents of his bowl. He shouldn’t interrupt his preceptor when he’s speaking. But if the preceptor’s speech is bordering on an offense, he should stop him.

59When returning, the student should go first to prepare a seat and to set out a foot stool, a foot scraper, and water for washing the feet. He should go out to meet the preceptor and receive his bowl and robe. He should give him a sarong and receive the one he’s wearing in return. If the robe is moist, he should sun it for a short while, but he shouldn’t leave it in the heat. He should fold the robe, offsetting the edges by seven centimeters, so that the fold doesn’t become worn. He should place the belt in the fold.


60If there is almsfood and his preceptor wants to eat, the student should give him water and then the almsfood.

He should ask his preceptor if he wants water to drink. When the preceptor has eaten, the student should give him water and receive his bowl. Holding it low, he should wash it carefully without scratching it. He should then dry it and sun it for a short while, but he shouldn’t leave it in the heat.

When the preceptor has gotten up, the student should put away the seat and also the foot stool, the foot scraper, and the water for washing the feet. If the place is dirty, he should sweep it.

61“If the preceptor wants to bathe, the student should prepare a bath. If he wants a cold bath, he should prepare that; if he wants a hot bath, he should prepare that.

62If the preceptor wants to take a sauna, the student should knead bath powder, moisten the clay, take a sauna bench, and follow behind his preceptor. After giving the preceptor the sauna bench, receiving his robe, and putting it aside, he should give him the bath powder and the clay. If he’s able, he should enter the sauna. When entering the sauna, he should smear his face with clay, cover himself front and back, and then enter.

He shouldn’t sit encroaching on the senior monks, and he shouldn’t block the junior monks from getting a seat. While in the sauna, he should do services for his preceptor. When leaving the sauna, he should take the sauna bench, cover himself front and back, and then leave.

63He should also do services for his preceptor in the water. When he has bathed, he should be the first to come out. He should dry himself and put on his sarong.

If the floor is untreated, he should sprinkle it with water and then sweep it, while trying to avoid stirring up dust. He should look out for any trash and discard it.

65He should sun the floor cover, clean it, beat it, bring it back inside, and put it back as before. He should sun the bed supports, wipe them, bring them back inside, and put them back where they were. He should sun the bed, clean it, and beat it.

68“If the preceptor becomes discontent with the spiritual life, the student should send him away or have him sent away, or he should give him a teaching. If the preceptor becomes anxious, the student should dispel it or have it dispelled, or he should give him a teaching. If the preceptor has wrong view, the student should make him give it up or have someone else do it, or he should give him a teaching. If the preceptor has committed a heavy offense and deserves probation, the student should try to get the Saṅgha to give it to him.

If the preceptor has committed a heavy offense and deserves to be sent back to the beginning, the student should try to get the Saṅgha to do it. If the preceptor has committed a heavy offense and deserves the trial period, the student should try to get the Saṅgha to give it to him. If the preceptor has committed a heavy offense and deserves rehabilitation, the student should try to get the Saṅgha to give it to him.


If the Saṅgha wants to do a legal procedure against his preceptor—whether a procedure of condemnation, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, or ejection the student should make an effort to stop it or to reduce the penalty. But if the Saṅgha has already done a legal procedure against his preceptor—whether a procedure of condemnation, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, or ejection the student should help the preceptor conduct himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released, and try to get the Saṅgha to lift that procedure.

69“If the preceptor’s robe needs washing, the student should do it himself, or he should make an effort to get it done. If the preceptor needs a robe, the student should make one himself, or he should make an effort to get one made. If the preceptor needs dye, the student should make it himself, or he should make an effort to get it made. If the preceptor’s robe needs dyeing, the student should do it himself, or he should make an effort to get it done. When he’s dyeing the robe, he should carefully and repeatedly turn it over, and he shouldn’t go away while it’s still dripping.

70Without asking his preceptor for permission, he should not do any of the following: give away or receive a bowl; give away or receive a robe; give away or receive a requisite; cut anyone’s hair or get it cut; do work for anyone or get work done by anyone; do a service for anyone or get a service done by anyone; be the attendant monk for anyone or take anyone as his attendant monk; bring back almsfood for anyone or get almsfood brought back by anyone; enter the village, go to the charnel ground, or leave for another region. If his preceptor is sick, he should nurse him for as long as he lives, or he should wait until he has recovered.

This is the proper conduct of a student toward his preceptor.”

If there is no water in the rinsing pot, he should fill it.


82“If the student becomes discontent with the spiritual life, the preceptor should send him away or have him sent away, or he should give him a teaching. If the student becomes anxious, the preceptor should dispel it or have it dispelled, or he should give him a teaching. If the student has wrong view, the preceptor should make him give it up or have someone else do it, or he should give him a teaching. If the student has committed a heavy offense and deserves probation, the preceptor should try to get the Saṅgha to give it to him.

If the student has committed a heavy offense and deserves to be sent back to the beginning, the preceptor should try to get the Saṅgha to do it. If the student has committed a heavy offense and deserves the trial period, the preceptor should try to get the Saṅgha to give it to him. If the student has committed a heavy offense and deserves rehabilitation, the preceptor should try to get the Saṅgha to give it to him.

If the Saṅgha wants to do a legal procedure against his student—whether a procedure of condemnation, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, or ejection the preceptor should make an effort to stop it or to reduce the penalty. But if the Saṅgha has already done a legal procedure against his student—whether a procedure of condemnation, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, or ejection the preceptor should help the student conduct himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released, and try to get the Saṅgha to lift that procedure.


83“If the student’s robe needs washing, the preceptor should show him how to do it, or he should make an effort to get it done. If the student needs a robe, the preceptor should show him how to make one, or he should make an effort to get one made. If the student needs dye, the preceptor should show him how to make it, or he should make an effort to get it made. If the student’s robe needs dyeing, the preceptor should show him how to do it, or he should make an effort to get it done. When he’s dyeing the robe, he should carefully and repeatedly turn it over, and he shouldn’t go away while it’s still dripping. If his student is sick, he should nurse him for as long as he lives, or he should wait until he has recovered.

This is the proper conduct of a preceptor toward his student.”

85At that time the pupils were not conducting themselves properly toward their teachers. The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the pupils not conduct themselves properly toward their teachers?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the pupils are not conducting themselves properly toward their teachers?” “It’s true, Sir.” …

After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


86“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for a pupil toward his teacher. A pupil should conduct himself properly toward his teacher. This is the proper conduct:

Having gotten up at the appropriate time, the pupil should take off his sandals, and put his upper robe over one shoulder.


87He should then give his teacher a tooth cleaner and water for rinsing the mouth, and he should prepare a seat for him. If there is rice porridge, he should wash a vessel and bring the rice porridge to his teacher. When the teacher has drunk the rice porridge, the pupil should give him water and receive the vessel. Holding it low, he should wash it carefully without scratching it and then put it away. When the teacher has gotten up, the pupil should put away the seat. If the place is dirty, he should sweep it.

88If the teacher wants to enter the village, the pupil should give him a sarong and receive the one he’s wearing in return. He should give him a belt. He should put the upper robes together, overlapping each other edge-to-edge, and then give them to him. He should wash his teacher’s bowl and give it to him while wet. If the teacher wants an attendant, the pupil should put on his sarong evenly all around, covering the navel and the knees. He should put on a belt. Putting the upper robes together, overlapping each other edge-to-edge, he should put them on and fasten the toggle. He should wash his bowl, bring it along, and be his teacher’s attendant.

He shouldn’t walk too far behind his teacher or too close to him. He should receive the contents of his bowl. He shouldn’t interrupt his teacher when he’s speaking. But if the teacher’s speech is bordering on an offense, he should stop him.

89When returning, the pupil should go first to prepare a seat and to set out a foot stool, a foot scraper, and water for washing the feet. He should go out to meet the teacher and receive his bowl and robe. He should give him a sarong and receive the one he’s wearing in return. If the robe is moist, he should sun it for a short while, but he shouldn’t leave it in the heat. He should fold the robe, offsetting the edges by seven centimeters, so that the fold doesn’t become worn. He should place the belt in the fold.

90If there is almsfood and his teacher wants to eat, the pupil should give him water and then the almsfood.

He should ask his teacher if he wants water to drink. When the teacher has eaten, the pupil should give him water and receive his bowl. Holding it low, he should wash it carefully without scratching it. He should then dry it and sun it for a short while, but he shouldn’t leave it in the heat.

The pupil should put away the robe and bowl. When putting away the bowl, he should hold the bowl in one hand, feel under the bed or the bench with the other, and then put it away. He shouldn’t put the bowl away on the bare floor. When putting away the robe, he should hold the robe in one hand, wipe the bamboo robe rack or the clothesline with the other, and then put it away by folding the robe over it, making the ends face the wall and the fold face out. When the teacher has gotten up, the pupil should put away the seat and also the foot stool, the foot scraper, and the water for washing the feet. If the place is dirty, he should sweep it.

91“If the teacher wants to bathe, the pupil should prepare a bath. If he wants a cold bath, he should prepare that; if he wants a hot bath, he should prepare that.


92If the teacher wants to take a sauna, the pupil should knead bath powder, moisten the clay, take a sauna bench, and follow behind his teacher. After giving the teacher the sauna bench, receiving his robe, and putting it aside, he should give him the bath powder and the clay. If he’s able, he should enter the sauna. When entering the sauna, he should smear his face with clay, cover himself front and back, and then enter. He shouldn’t sit encroaching on the senior monks, and he shouldn’t block the junior monks from getting a seat. While in the sauna, he should do services for his teacher. When leaving the sauna, he should take the sauna bench, cover himself front and back, and then leave.

93He should also do services for his teacher in the water. When he has bathed, he should be the first to come out. He should dry himself and put on his sarong. He should then wipe the water off his teacher’s body, and he should give him his sarong and then his upper robe. Taking the sauna bench, he should be the first to return. He should prepare a seat, and also set out a foot stool, a foot scraper, and water for washing the feet. He should ask his teacher if he wants water to drink.

If the teacher wants him to recite, he should do so. If the teacher wants to question him, he should be questioned.


94“If the dwelling where the teacher is staying is dirty, the pupil should clean it if he’s able. When he’s cleaning the dwelling, he should first take out the bowl and robe and put them aside.

He should take out the bed supports and put them aside. He should take out the spittoon and put it aside. He should take out the leaning board and put it aside. After taking note of its position, he should take out the floor cover and put it aside. If the dwelling has cobwebs, he should first remove them from the ceiling cloth, and he should then wipe the windows and the corners of the room. If the walls have been treated with red ocher and they’re moldy, he should moisten a cloth, wring it out, and wipe the walls. If the floor has been treated with a black finish and it’s moldy, he should moisten a cloth, wring it out, and wipe the floor. If the floor is untreated, he should sprinkle it with water and then sweep it, while trying to avoid stirring up dust. He should look out for any trash and discard it.

95He should sun the floor cover, clean it, beat it, bring it back inside, and put it back as before. He should sun the bed supports, wipe them, bring them back inside, and put them back where they were. He should sun the bed, clean it, and beat it.

96If dusty winds are blowing from the east, he should close the windows on the eastern side. If dusty winds are blowing from the west, he should close the windows on the western side. If dusty winds are blowing from the north, he should close the windows on the northern side. If dusty winds are blowing from the south, he should close the windows on the southern side. If the weather is cold, he should open the windows during the day and close them at night. If the weather is hot, he should close the windows during the day and open them at night.

97If the yard is dirty, he should sweep it. If the gateway is dirty, he should sweep it. If the assembly hall is dirty, he should sweep it. If the water-boiling shed is dirty, he should sweep it.

99“If the teacher’s robe needs washing, the pupil should do it himself, or he should make an effort to get it done. If the teacher needs a robe, the pupil should make one himself, or he should make an effort to get one made. If the teacher needs dye, the pupil should make it himself, or he should make an effort to get it made.

114The eighth chapter on proper conduct is finished. In this chapter there are nineteen topics and fourteen kinds of proper conduct.


If you do not fulfill the proper conduct,  
Then you do not fulfill your virtue.  
If your virtue is impure, you are weak in wisdom;  
And you do not know the unity of mind.

A mind distracted, not unified,  
Does not see the truth of nature.  
Not seeing the truth of nature,  
You are not released from suffering.

But if you do fulfill the proper conduct,  
Then you also fulfill your virtue.  
If your virtue is pure, you are possessed of wisdom;  
And you know the unity of mind.

A non-distracted mind, unified,  
Sees the truth of nature.  
Seeing the truth of nature,  
You are released from suffering.

So, fulfill the proper conduct,  
you the Son of the Conqueror, possessed of insight.  
The instruction of the Buddha, the best—  
Go from that to extinguishment, in this way.


The chapter on proper conduct is finished.
