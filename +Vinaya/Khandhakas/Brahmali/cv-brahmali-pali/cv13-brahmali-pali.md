1At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time Venerable Udāyī had committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. He told the monks about this, adding: “What should I do now?” They told the Buddha.

“Well then, the Saṅgha should give the monk Udāyī the trial period of six days for one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen.

And it should be given like this.

#### 1.1 Trial periods for those with unconcealed offenses

2“The monk Udāyī should approach the Saṅgha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:

‘Venerables, I’ve committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. I ask the Saṅgha for the trial period of six days for that offense.

I’ve committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. For the second time I ask the Saṅgha for the trial period of six days for that offense.

I’ve committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. For the third time I ask the Saṅgha for the trial period of six days for that offense.’

A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha:

3‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The monk Udāyī has committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. He’s asking the Saṅgha for the trial period of six days for that offense. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should give him that trial period. This is the motion.

4Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The monk Udāyī has committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. He’s asking the Saṅgha for the trial period of six days for that offense. The Saṅgha gives him that trial period. Any monk who approves of giving him that trial period of six days should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.

5For the second time I speak on this matter. Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The monk Udāyī has committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. He’s asking the Saṅgha for the trial period of six days for that offense. The Saṅgha gives him that trial period. Any monk who approves of giving him that trial period of six days should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.

6For the third time I speak on this matter. Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The monk Udāyī has committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. He’s asking the Saṅgha for the trial period of six days for that offense. The Saṅgha gives him the trial period. Any monk who approves of giving him that trial period of six days should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.

7The Saṅgha has given the monk Udāyī the trial period of six days for one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’”

#### 1.2 Rehabilitation for those with unconcealed offenses

8When he had completed that trial period, he told the monks: “I had committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. I asked the Saṅgha to give me the trial period of six days for that offense, which it did. I’ve now completed it. What should I do next?” They told the Buddha.

“Well then, the Saṅgha should rehabilitate the monk Udāyī. And it should be done like this.

9The monk Udāyī should approach the Saṅgha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:

‘Venerables, I had committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. I asked the Saṅgha to give me the trial period of six days for that offense, which it did. I’ve now completed that trial period and ask the Saṅgha for rehabilitation.

10I had committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. I asked the Saṅgha to give me the trial period of six days for that offense, which it did. I’ve now completed that trial period, and for the second time I ask the Saṅgha for rehabilitation.

“Well then, the Saṅgha should give the monk Udāyī probation for one day for one offense of intentional emission of semen, concealed for one day.

Let me ask the Saṅgha for probation for one month for those offenses.’ I asked and got it. While on probation, I was overcome with guilt. I considered all this and thought, ‘Let me ask the Saṅgha for probation for an additional month for those two offenses.’ I now ask the Saṅgha for probation for an additional month for those two offenses.’ And he should ask a second and a third time. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha:


‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The monk so-and-so had committed two offenses entailing suspension, both concealed for two months. He thought,

‘I’ve committed two offenses entailing suspension, both concealed for two months. Let me ask the Saṅgha for probation for one month for those offenses.’ He asked and got it.

#### 2.5 Purifying probation

160At one time a monk had committed a number of offenses entailing suspension. He did not know the number of offenses or the number of days; he did not remember the number of offenses or the number of days; he was unsure of the number of offenses and the number of days. He told the monks about this, adding: “What should I do now?” They told the Buddha.


“Well then, the Saṅgha should give that monk a purifying probation for those offenses. And it should be given like this.

161That monk should approach the Saṅgha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:

‘Venerables, I’ve committed a number of offenses entailing suspension. I don’t know the number of offenses or the number of days; I don’t remember the number of offenses or the number of days; I’m unsure of the number of offenses and the number of days. I ask the Saṅgha for a purifying probation for those offenses.’ And he should ask a second and a third time. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha:

162‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The monk so-and-so has committed a number of offenses entailing suspension. He doesn’t know the number of offenses or the number of days; he doesn’t remember the number of offenses or the number of days; he’s unsure of the number of offenses and the number of days. He’s asking the Saṅgha for a purifying probation for those offenses. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should give him a that purifying probation. This is the motion.

163Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The monk so-and-so has committed a number of offenses entailing suspension. He doesn’t know the number of offenses or the number of days; he doesn’t remember the number of offenses or the number of days; he’s unsure of the number of offenses and the number of days. He’s asking the Saṅgha for purifying probation for those offenses. The Saṅgha gives him that purifying probation. Any monk who approves of giving him that purifying probation should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.

164For the second time I speak on this matter. … For the third time I speak on this matter. …

165The Saṅgha has given monk so-and-so a purifying probation for those offenses. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’

166“When should purifying probation be given? It should be given: when one doesn’t know the number of offenses, nor the number of days; when one doesn’t remember the number of offenses, nor the number of days; when one is unsure of the number of offenses and the number of days.

167It should be given: when one knows the number of offenses, but not the number of days; when one remembers the number of offenses, but not the number of days; when one is sure of the number of offenses, but not the number of days.

170It should be given: when one knows the number of offenses, and one knows some of the days but not others; when one remembers the number of offenses, and one remembers some of the days but not others; when one is sure of the number of offenses, and one is sure of some of the days but not others.

171It should be given: when one knows some of the offenses but not others, and one knows some of the days but not others; when one remembers some of the offenses but not others, and one remembers some of the days but not others; when one is sure of some of the offenses but not others, and one is sure of some of the days but not others.

172“When should probation be given? It should be given: when one knows the number of offenses and the number of days; when one remembers the number of offenses and the number of days; when one is sure of the number of offenses and the number of days.

173It should be given: when one doesn’t know the number of offenses, but one knows the number of days; when one doesn’t remember the number of offenses, but one remembers the number of days; when one is unsure of the number of offenses, but sure of the number of days.

174It should be given: when one knows some of the offenses but not others, and one knows the number of days; when one remembers some of the offenses but not others, and one remembers the number of days; when one is sure of some of the offenses but not others, and one is sure of the number of days.”

The simultaneous probation, the trial period, and the rehabilitation must all be legitimate.’ He asks to be sent back to the beginning in this way, which it does. The legal procedure is legitimate, irreversible, and fit to stand. The Saṅgha gives him the simultaneous probation, the trial period, and the rehabilitation legitimately. He’s purified of those offenses.”

The third chapter on processes for the clearing of offenses entailing suspension is finished.

291This is the summary:


282“Unconcealed, one day,  
Two days, three days, and four days;  
Five days, a half-month, for ten,  
Offense, said the Great Sage.

283And purifying, disrobing,  
Specified, two monks;  
There both perceive accordingly,  
And just the same for unsure.

284And both see it as mixed,  
They see it as not light;  
And both see it as light.

285And just so one conceals,  
And then with the thought of concealing;  
Insane, and recitation,  
To the beginning, eighteen as to purity.

286The teachers of analytical statements,  
Who are the inspiration of Sri Lanka,  
The residents of the Mahāvihāra monastery—  
This was their words for the longevity of the true Teachings.”


287The chapter on the processes for the clearing of offenses entailing suspension is finished.
