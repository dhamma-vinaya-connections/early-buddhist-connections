1At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. At this time the Buddha had not yet allowed dwellings. And the monks stayed here and there: in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, on a hill, in a gorge, in a hillside cave, in a charnel ground, in the forest, in the open, on a heap of straw. Early in the morning, they would emerge from those places. And they were pleasing in their conduct: in going out and coming back, in looking ahead and looking aside, in bending and stretching their arms. Their eyes were lowered, and they were perfect in deportment.


One morning a wealthy merchant of Rājagaha was going to a park when he saw those monks. Being inspired, he approached them and said: “Venerables, if I build dwellings, would you stay there?”


“The Buddha hasn’t allowed dwellings.”

“Well then, please ask the Buddha and let me know his response.”

“Yes.” Those monks then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said: “Venerable Sir, a wealthy merchant of Rājagaha wants to build dwellings. What should we do?” Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“I allow five kinds of shelters: dwellings, three kinds of stilt houses, and caves.”


2The monks went to that merchant and said: “The Buddha has allowed dwellings. Please do whatever you think is appropriate.” Then, on a single day, that merchant built sixty dwellings. When the dwellings were finished, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said: “Venerable Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me, together with the Saṅgha of monks.” The Buddha consented by remaining silent. Knowing that the Buddha had consented, he got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.

3The next morning he had various kinds of fine food prepared and then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready. The Buddha robe up, took his bowl and robe, and went to the house of that merchant, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Saṅgha of monks. That merchant personally served various kinds of fine food to the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal and had washed his hands and bowl, the merchant sat down to one side and said: “Sir, I’ve had these sixty dwellings built to make merit and for the purpose of going to heaven. What should I do now?”


“Well then, give those sixty dwellings to the Saṅgha everywhere, both present and future.”

Saying: “Yes,” he did just that.

4The Buddha then expressed his appreciation to the merchant with these verses:


5“Cold and heat are kept away,  
And predatory animals too,  
And creeping animals and mosquitoes,  
And also chill and rain.

6It keeps away the wind and burning sun,  
When those awful things arise.  
It’s for the sake of shelter and happiness,  
To attain absorption and to see clearly.

7Giving dwellings to the Saṅgha  
Is praised as the best by the Buddha.  
Therefore the wise man,  
Seeing what is beneficial for himself,

8Should build delightful dwellings  
And have the learned stay there.  
Food, drink, robes, and dwellings—  
With an inspired mind,

9He should give to them,  
The upright ones.  
They will give him the Teaching  
For removing all suffering;  
And understanding this Teaching in this life,  
He attains extinguishment, free of corruptions.”


10The Buddha then got up from his seat and left.

11Hearing that the Buddha had allowed dwellings, people had dwellings built with care. But because the dwellings did not have doors, snakes, scorpions, and centipedes came inside. They told the Buddha.

“I allow doors.”

They made a hole in the wall and bound the doors with creepers and ropes. Rats and termites ate the creepers and ropes, and the doors fell off.

“I allow door frames, and lower and upper hinges.”

The doors did not touch the door frames.

“I allow a hole in the door for pulling it and a rope for pulling it.”

The doors did not stay closed.

“I allow bolt-receiving posts, bolt sockets, bolts, and upper bolts.”


12The monks were not able to open the doors.

“I allow a keyhole and three kinds of keys: metal keys, wooden keys, and keys made of horn.”


They unlocked the doors with the keys and entered, but the dwellings were unprotected.

“I allow bolts.”


13At that time the dwellings had roofs of straw. When the weather was cold, they were cold, and when the weather was hot, they were hot.

“I allow you to firm up the structure and then to plaster it inside and outside.”


14At that time the dwellings did not have windows. It was hard to see and the dwellings were smelly. They told the Buddha.

“I allow three kinds of windows: railing windows, lattice windows, and windows with bars.”

Squirrels and bats entered the dwellings through the gaps in the windows.

“I allow a cloth-cover.”

The squirrels and bats entered in the gaps around the cloth cover.

“I allow window shutters.”


15At that time the monks lay down on the ground. They became dirty, as did their robes.

“I allow straw mats.”

The straw mats were eaten by rats and termites.

“I allow a bench.”

It was painful to lie on the bench.

“I allow a wicker bed.”

The Saṅgha was offered a bench made of straw.

“I allow benches made of straw.”


21At that time the monks from the group of six lay down on high beds. When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them: “They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” They told the Buddha.

“You should not lie down on high beds. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”


22Soon afterwards a monk was bitten by a snake while lying on a low bed.

“I allow bed supports.”


23The monks from the group of six used high bed supports, and they then made the bed shake. When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them: “They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”

“You should not use high bed supports. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow bed supports that are eight standard fingerbreadths at the most.”


24The Saṅgha was offered string.


“I allow you to wrap the beds with string.”

The limbs of the bed took up a lot of string.


“I allow you to perforate the limbs and wrap with a cross-weaving.”

The Saṅgha was offered a cloth.

“I allow you to make a mat underlay.”

The Saṅgha was offered a cotton-down quilt.


“I allow you to remove the cotton down and make pillows. There are three kinds of cotton down: cotton down from trees, cotton down from creepers, and cotton down from grass.”


25The monks from the group of six used large pillows, half the size of the body. When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them: “They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”

“You should not use large pillows, half the size of the body. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow you to make pillows the size of the head.”

26On one occasion in Rājagaha there was a hilltop fair. People prepared mattresses for the government officials: mattresses stuffed with wool, cloth, bark, grass, or leaves. When the fair was over, they removed the covers and took them away. The monks saw a large quantity of wool, cloth, bark, grass, and leaves abandoned on the ground. They told the Buddha.


“I allow you five kinds of mattresses: mattresses stuffed with wool, cloth, bark, grass, or leaves.”

27The Saṅgha was offered furniture cloth.

“I allow you to cover the mattresses.”


28The monks laid a bed mattress on a bench and a bench mattress on a bed. The mattresses split open.

“I allow upholstered beds and upholstered benches.”


They put out a mattress without underlay. They sank down.

“I allow you to put down an underlay, then to spread out a mattress, and then to cover it.”


The covers were removed and taken away.

“I allow you to sprinkle them.”

They were still taken away.

They were still taken away.


“I allow you to make multi-colored lines by hand.”

They were still taken away.

29At that time the monastics of other religions had white beds, black floors, and red ocher walls. Many people went to see their beds.

“I allow the colors white, black, and red ocher in the dwellings.”

30The white color did not adhere to a rough wall.

The black color still did not adhere.

“I allow sap and bitter substances.”

#### 1.4 The prohibition against pictures

33At that time the monks from the group of six had drawn pictures of women and men in a dwelling. When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them: “They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” They told the Buddha.

“You should not draw pictures of women and men. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow you to make a garland pattern, a creeper pattern, a shark-teeth pattern, and the fivefold pattern.”

#### 1.5 The allowance for foundations of bricks, etc.

34At that time the dwellings were built on a low base. They were flooded.

“I allow you to make a high base.”

The mound collapsed.


“I allow you to construct three kinds of raised foundations: a raised foundation of brick, a raised foundation of stone, and a raised foundation of wood.”

It was difficult to get up to the dwelling.


“I allow three kinds of stairs: stairs of brick, stairs of stone, and stairs of wood.”

“I allow three kinds of rooms: a rectaṅgular room, a long room, and an upper room.”

36On one occasion the monks made a room in the middle of a small dwelling. There was no access around the room.

“I allow a timber support.”

It rained on the wall.

#### 2.1 The account of Anāthapiṇḍika

50The householder Anāthapiṇḍika had a brother in law who was a wealthy merchant in Rājagaha. On one occasion when Anāthapiṇḍika went to Rājagaha on business, that merchant had invited the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha for the meal on the following day. The merchant was telling his slaves and workers to get up early, to cook rice and rice porridge, and to prepare various kinds of curry. Anāthapiṇḍika thought: “When I’ve arrived here before, this householder put down all his business to greet me. But this time he’s all over the place, telling his workers what to do. Is he preparing for a marriage or a great sacrifice, or has he invited King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and the army for a meal tomorrow?”


51When the merchant was finished with telling his workers what to do, he went up to Anāthapiṇḍika, greeted him, and sat down. Anāthapiṇḍika then told him what he had observed and asked him what was happening.


The merchant replied: “I’m not preparing for a marriage, nor have I invited King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and the army. I’m preparing for a great sacrifice. I have invited the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha for a meal tomorrow.”

“Did you say, ‘Buddha’?”


“I did.”

“Did you say, ‘Buddha’?”

“I did.”


“Did you say, ‘Buddha’?”


“I did.”

“It’s rare in the world to hear the word ‘Buddha’. Is it possible right now to go and visit that Buddha, that fully awakened and perfected one?”

“Now is the wrong time to visit the Buddha. Tomorrow will be the right time.”


Because he lay down preoccupied with the Buddha “Tomorrow I will go and visit that Buddha, that fully awakened and perfected one!” he got up three times during the night thinking it was light.

52Anāthapiṇḍika then went to the Sivaka gate, which was opened by spirits. Then, as he was leaving town, the light disappeared and darkness descended. Paralyzed with fear and getting goosebumps all over, he just wanted to turn back. But then the invisible spirit Sivaka spoke up:

53“A hundred elephants, a hundred horses,  
A hundred carriages drawn by mules,  
A hundred thousand girls  
Wearing jeweled earrings—  
None is worth a sixteenth part  
Of a single step forward.

54Go forward, householder, go forward!  
Going forward is better for you than going back.”


55-58The light returned, the darkness disappeared, and his fear subsided. A second and a third time the light disappeared and he was paralyzed with fear, upon which the spirit proclaimed the same verses. And on both occasions the light returned, the darkness disappeared, and his fear subsided.


Anāthapiṇḍika then went to the Sītavana, the Cool Grove. Just then the Buddha was doing walking meditation outside, having got up early in the morning. When the Buddha saw Anāthapiṇḍika coming, he stepped down from the walking path, sat down on the prepared seat, and said: “Come, Sudatta.” Anāthapiṇḍika thought: “The Buddha is calling me by name!” and glad and joyful he went up to him, bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said: “Venerable Sir, I hope you have slept well.”


59“Indeed, he always sleeps well,  
The brahmin who is extinguished,  
Who’s not soiled among worldly pleasures,  
But is cool and ownerless.

60After cutting all attachments,  
After removing distress from the heart,  
Calmed, he sleeps well,  
Having attained peace of mind.”


61The Buddha then gave him a progressive talk on generosity, morality, and heaven; on the danger, degradation, and defilement of worldly pleasures; and he revealed the benefits of renunciation. When the Buddha knew that his mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, so too, while he was sitting right there, Anāthapiṇḍika experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.”

He had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it. He had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. He then said to the Buddha:

“Wonderful, Sir, wonderful! Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what’s there just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Saṅgha of monks. Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. And please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Saṅgha of monks.” The Buddha consented by remaining silent.


62Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Anāthapiṇḍika got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.

The merchant heard that Anāthapiṇḍika had invited the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha for the meal on the following day.


63And he said to Anāthapiṇḍika: “You’ve invited the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha, yet you’ve just arrived here. I’ll pay for it.”

“There’s no need. I have the means.”


64The householder association of Rājagaha heard that Anāthapiṇḍika had invited the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha for a meal on the following day. And they said to Anāthapiṇḍika: “You’ve invited the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha, yet you’ve just arrived here. We’ll pay for it.”

“There’s no need, sirs. I have the means.”

65King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha heard that Anāthapiṇḍika had invited the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha for a meal on the following day. And he said to Anāthapiṇḍika: “You’ve invited the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha, yet you’ve just arrived here. I’ll pay for it.”

“There’s no need, sir. I have the means.”


66The following morning, in that wealthy merchant’s house, Anāthapiṇḍika had various kinds of fine food prepared. He then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready. The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to that merchant’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Saṅgha of monks. Anāthapiṇḍika then personally served the various kinds of fine food to the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal and had washed his hands and bowl, Anāthapiṇḍika sat down to one side and said: “Sir, please spend the rainy-season residence at Sāvatthī together with the Saṅgha of monks.”


“Buddhas delight in solitude, householder.”

“I understand, Sir, I understand!” Then, after instructing, inspiring, and gladdening him with a teaching, the Buddha got up from his seat and left. After finishing his business in Rājagaha, Anāthapiṇḍika set out for Sāvatthī.


67Now at that time Anāthapiṇḍika had many friends and acquaintances who listened to him. On his way to Sāvatthī he told people to make monasteries, to build dwellings, and to prepare offerings: “There’s a Buddha in the world! He’s been invited by me and will be traveling this way.”

And those people did as Anāthapiṇḍika had urged them to do.


68After arriving at Sāvatthī, Anāthapiṇḍika searched all over the town for a place for the Buddha to stay, thinking: “Where might the Buddha stay that’s neither too far from habitation nor too close, that has good access roads, that’s easily accessible for people who seek him, that has few people during the day and is quiet at night, that’s free from chatter and offers solitude, a private resting place suitable for seclusion?”

69Anāthapiṇḍika saw that Prince Jeta’s park had all these qualities. He then went to Prince Jeta and said: “Sir, please give me your park to set up a monastery.”

“I wouldn’t give it away even if you covered the park with ten million coins.”


“It’s a deal!”

“No it isn’t.”


They then asked judges to decide on the matter. They said: “Sir, since you gave a price, the park is sold.”

Anāthapiṇḍika then had gold coins brought out in carts and covered the Jeta Grove with ten million coins.

After yet another load had been brought out, there was still a small area near the gateway that was not covered. Anāthapiṇḍika told his people: “Go and get more coins. We’ll cover this area too.”


70But Prince Jeta thought: “This must be really worthwhile, seeing as he’s giving up so much money.” And he said to Anāthapiṇḍika:

“That’s enough; don’t cover that area. Let me keep it. It will be my gift.”

Anāthapiṇḍika thought: “Prince Jeta is a well-known person. It’s very beneficial that such well-known people gain confidence in this spiritual path.” And he granted that area to Prince Jeta. Prince Jeta then had a gateway built at that place.

71But Anāthapiṇḍika had dwellings build in the Jeta Grove, and yards, gateways, assembly halls, water-boiling sheds, food-storage huts, restrooms, walking-meditation paths, indoor walking-meditation paths, wells, well houses, saunas, sauna sheds, ponds, and roof-covers.

#### 2.2 Putting in charge of building work

72When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Vesālī. When he eventually arrived, he stayed, in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.

At that time people were doing careful building work. And the monks who supervised the building work were respectfully supported with robe-cloth, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal supplies. Then a certain poor tailor thought: “It must be really worthwhile, seeing as these people do such careful building work. Why don’t I too do building work?” He then made a mixture of mud, made bricks out of it, and built a wall. But because of his lack of skill, the wall was not straight and it fell down. A second and a third time the same thing happened.


He then complained and criticized the monks: “These Sakyan monastics teach and instruct only those who give them robe-cloth, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal supplies. They only supervise their building work. But since I’m poor, nobody teaches, instructs, or supervises me.”


73The monks heard the complaints of that poor tailor. They informed the Buddha, who gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“You should put a monk in charge of the building work.


The monk in charge of building work should make an effort to complete the dwellings as quickly as possible, and he should repair what is broken or damaged.

And he is to be put in charge like this. First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:


74‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should put monk so-and-so in charge of the building work relating to the dwelling of householder so-and-so. This is the motion.

75Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The Saṅgha puts monk so-and-so in charge of the building work relating to the dwelling of householder so-and-so. Any monk who approves of putting monk so-and-so in charge of the building work relating to the dwelling of householder so-and-so should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.

76The Saṅgha has put monk so-and-so in charge of the building work relating to the dwelling of householder so-and-so. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”

#### 2.3 The instruction on the best seat, etc.

77When the Buddha had stayed at Vesālī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī. On that occasion the monks who were the pupils of the monks from the group of six went ahead of the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha and took possession of dwellings and beds, thinking: “This will be for our preceptors and teachers, and also for ourselves.”

78Venerable Sāriputta followed behind the Saṅgha. Being unable to get a bed—the dwellings and beds having all been taken—he sat down at the foot of a tree. After getting up early in the morning, the Buddha cleared his throat. Sāriputta, too, cleared his throat.

“Who is there?”

“It’s me, Venerable Sir, Sāriputta.”

“Why are you sitting here?”

Sāriputta told the Buddha what had happened.


Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks:

“Is it true, monks, that the monks who are the pupils of the monks from the group of six did this?”


“It’s true, Sir.”

The Buddha rebuked them … “How can they act like this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


“Monks, who deserves the best seat, the best water, and the best almsfood?”


79Some monks said: “Those who have gone forth from an aristocratic family deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Others said: “Those who have gone forth from a brahmin family deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Still others said: “Those who have gone forth from a householder family deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “The experts on the discourses deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “The experts on the Monastic Law deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “The expounders of the Teaching deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “Those who obtain the first absorption deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “Those who obtain the second absorption deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “Those who obtain the third absorption deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “Those who obtain the fourth absorption deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “The stream-enterers deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “The once-returners deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “The nonreturners deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “The perfected ones deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “Those who have attained the three true insights deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “Those who have attained the six direct knowledges deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.”


80The Buddha then addressed the monks: “Once upon a time, monks, there was a great banyan tree on the slope of the Himalayas. Three friends lived near it: a partridge, a monkey, and an elephant. They were disrespectful, undeferential, and rude toward one another. They thought, ‘If only we knew which one of us was the oldest. We would honor, respect, and esteem him, and we would wait for his instructions.’

81The partridge and the monkey then asked the elephant, ‘What’s your first memory?’

‘When I was a young, I stepped over this banyan tree, keeping it between my thighs, and the top shoots touched my belly. That’s my first memory.’

82The partridge and the elephant asked the monkey, ‘What’s your first memory?’

‘When I was a young, I sat on the ground and ate the top shoots of the banyan tree. That’s my first memory.’

83The monkey and the elephant asked the partridge, ‘What’s your first memory?’

‘In such and such a spot there was a great banyan tree. I ate one of its fruits and defecated here. This banyan tree has grown from that. Well then, I must be the oldest one.’

84The monkey and the elephant said to the partridge, ‘You’re the oldest of us. We will honor, respect, and esteem you, and we’ll wait for your instructions.’

The partridge had the monkey and the elephant take the five precepts, and he also undertook them himself. They were respectful, deferential, and courteous toward one another. And when they died, they were reborn in a happy, heavenly destination. In this way the spiritual life called _tittiriya_ came to be.


85Those who respect the seniors,  
And who are learned in the Teaching,  
They are praised while still alive,  
And then go to a good destination.

86“Even those animals, monks, were respectful, deferential, and courteous toward one another. Having gone forth on this well-proclaimed spiritual path, will you look good if you are disrespectful, undeferential, and rude toward one another? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“You should do these things according to seniority: bowing down, standing up, raising your joined palms, doing acts of respect, giving the best seat, giving the best water, and giving the best almsfood.

But what belongs to the Saṅgha should not be reserved according to seniority. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

#### 2.4 Persons one should not pay respect to, etc.

87“Monks, you should not pay respect to these ten kinds of persons: one who has been given the full ordination after you; one who isn’t fully ordained; one who belongs to a different Buddhist sect who is senior to you, but who speaks contrary to the Teaching; a woman; a _paṇḍaka_; one who is on probation; one who deserves to be sent back to the beginning; one who deserves the trial period; one who is undertaking the trial period; or one who deserves rehabilitation.

88You should pay respect to these three kinds of persons: one who has been given the full ordination before you; one who belongs to a different Buddhist sect who is senior to you and who speaks in accordance with the Teaching; and in this world with its gods, lords of death, and supreme beings, in this society with its monastics and brahmins, its gods and humans, you should pay respect to the Buddha, perfected and fully awakened.”

#### 2.5 The prohibition against reserving seats

89At that time people prepared roof-covers, mats, and places to stay for the Saṅgha. The monks who were the pupils of the monks from the group of six, thought: “The Buddha has instructed that what belongs to the Saṅgha should not be reserved according to seniority. But he’s given no such instruction about what has merely been prepared for the Saṅgha.” They then went ahead of the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha and took possession of roof-covers, mats, and places to stay, thinking: “This will be for our preceptors and teachers, and also for ourselves.”

Venerable Sāriputta followed behind the Saṅgha. Being unable to get a place to stay—the roof-covers, the mats, and the places to stay having all been taken—he sat down at the foot of a tree. After getting up early in the morning, the Buddha cleared his throat. Sāriputta, too, cleared his throat.

“Who is there?”

“It’s me, Venerable Sir, Sāriputta.”

“Why are you sitting here?”


Sāriputta told the Buddha what had happened. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the monks who are the pupils of the monks from the group of six did this?”


“It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“Even what has merely been prepared for the Saṅgha should not be reserved according to seniority. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

#### 2.6 The allowance for what belongs to a householder

90At that time people prepared high and luxurious resting places in the dining halls in inhabited areas, that is: a high couch, a luxurious couch, a long-fleeced woolen rug, a multi-colored woolen rug, a white woolen rug, a red woolen rug, a cotton-down quilt, a woolen rug decorated with the images of predatory animals, a woolen rug with long fleece on one side, a woolen rug with long fleece on both sides, a sheet of silk embroidered with gems, a silken sheet, a woolen rug like a dancers’ rug, an elephant-back rug, a horse-back rug, a carriage-seat rug, a rug made of black antelope hide, an excellent sheet made of _kadalī_-deer hide, a seat with a canopy, a seat with red cushions at each end. Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not sit on them. They told the Buddha.


“Apart from the high couch, the luxurious couch, and the cotton-down quilt, I allow you to sit down on what belongs to householders, but not to lie down on it.”

91At that time people prepared beds and benches upholstered with cotton down in the dining halls in inhabited areas. Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not sit on them. They told the Buddha.

“I allow you to sit down on what belongs to householders, but not to lie down on it.”

#### 2.7 The expression of appreciation for the Jeta Grove dwellings

92Wandering on, the Buddha eventually arrived at Sāvatthī, where he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Anāthapiṇḍika then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said: “Venerable Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Saṅgha of monks.” The Buddha consented by remaining silent.


93Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Anāthapiṇḍika got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.

The following morning Anāthapiṇḍika had various kinds of fine food prepared. He then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready. The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to Anāthapiṇḍika’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Saṅgha of monks. Anāthapiṇḍika then personally served various kinds of fine food to the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal and had washed his hands and bowl, Anāthapiṇḍika sat down to one side and said: “Sir, what should I do in regard to the Jeta Grove?”


“You should dedicate the Jeta Grove to the Saṅgha everywhere, present and future.”

“Yes.” And he did just that.

94The Buddha then expressed his appreciation with these verses:


95“Cold and heat are kept away,  
And predatory animals too,  
And creeping animals and mosquitoes,  
And also chill and rain.

96It keeps away the burning wind,  
That terrible thing that comes.  
It’s for the sake of shelter and happiness,  
To attain absorption and to see clearly.

97Giving dwellings to the Saṅgha  
Is praised as the best by the Buddha.  
Therefore the wise man,  
Seeing what is beneficial for himself,

98Should build delightful dwellings  
And have the learned stay there.  
Food, drink, cloth, and dwellings—  
With an inspired mind,

99He should give to them,  
The upright ones.  
They will give him the Teaching  
For removing all suffering;  
And understanding this Teaching in this very life,  
He attains extinguishment, free of corruptions.”

100The Buddha then got up from his seat and left.

#### 2.8 Reservation of seats, etc.

101On one occasion a certain government official who was an Ājīvaka disciple was offering a meal to the Saṅgha. Arriving late, Venerable Upananda the Sakyan made the nearest monk get up before he had finished his meal. There was an uproar in the dining hall. The official complained and criticized him: “How can the Sakyan monastics arrive late and make the nearest monk get up in the middle of his meal? There was an uproar in the dining hall. It’s impossible to eat as much as you like when you’re not seated.”

102The monks heard the complaints of the official, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him: “How could Upananda act like this?” They told the Buddha what had happened.


“Is it true, Upananda, that you acted like this?”

“It’s true, Sir.” The Buddha rebuked him …

“Foolish man, how can you act like this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking him … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


“You should not make a monk get up who hasn’t finished his meal. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.

If you’re asked to get up, and you have already refused an invitation to eat more, you should say: “Please, go and get some water.” If the other goes, all is well. If not, you should properly swallow the mouthful and give the seat to the more senior monk. Under no circumstances should you block a more senior monk from a seat. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

103On one occasion the monks from the group of six asked the sick monks to get up. The sick monks said: “We’re not able to get up; we’re sick.”

Saying: “We’ll make the venerables get up,” they took hold of them, lifted them up, and then released them when they were standing. The sick monks fainted and collapsed.

“You should not make the sick get up. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”


104The monks from the group of six took possession of the best beds, saying: “We’re sick and no one can make us get up.”

“You should give suitable beds to those who are sick.”

105The monks from the group of six used a pretext to reserve resting places.

“You should not use a pretext to reserve a resting place. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

106At that time the monks from the group of seventeen were repairing a large dwelling nearby, intending to stay there for the rainy season. The monks from the group of six saw this and said: “These monks from the group of seventeen are repairing a dwelling. Let’s throw them out.” But some of them said: “Let’s wait until they’ve finished repairing it.”

Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six said to those from the group of seventeen: “Leave, this dwelling is ours.”


“Shouldn’t you have told us beforehand? We would have repaired another one.”

“Doesn’t this dwelling belong to the Saṅgha?”

“Yes it does.”

“Well then, leave; this dwelling is ours.”

“The dwelling is large. You can stay here and so can we.”

But they said: “Leave, this dwelling is ours,” and they grabbed them by the neck and threw them out in anger. The monks from the group of seventeen cried. When other monks asked them why, they told them what had happened.


107The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks from the group of six angrily throw other monks out of a dwelling belonging to the Saṅgha?”

They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that you did this?”


“It’s true, Sir.” The Buddha rebuked them … and after giving a teaching, he addressed the monks:

“You should not, in anger, throw a monk out of a dwelling belonging to the Saṅgha. If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule. You should allocate the dwellings.”

#### 2.9 The appointment of allocators of dwellings

108The monks thought: “Who should allocate the dwellings?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks:

“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the allocator of dwellings: he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows which dwellings have and have not been allocated. And he should be appointed like this.

109First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

110‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should appoint monk so-and-so as allocator of dwellings. This is the motion.

111Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The Saṅgha appoints monk so-and-so as allocator of dwellings. Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as allocator of dwellings should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.

112The Saṅgha has appointed monk so-and-so as allocator of dwellings. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”


113The allocators of dwellings thought: “How should we allocate the dwellings?” They told the Buddha.


“First you should count the monks and the beds. You should then allocate one monk to each bed.”

When they were allocating the beds, there were beds left over.


“You should allocate one monk to each dwelling.”

When they were allocating the dwellings, there were dwellings left over.

“You should allocate one monk to the yard of each dwelling.”


When they were allocating the yards, there were yards left over.

“You should give out additional shares. If another monk arrives after the additional shares have been allocated, then if you’re unwilling, you need not give him a share.”


114On one occasion the monks allocated a dwelling to one who was outside the monastery zone.

“You should not allocate a dwelling to one outside the monastery zone. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

115At that time, after accepting a dwelling, the monks reserved it at all times.

“After you have accepted a dwelling, you should not reserve it at all times. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow you to reserve it for the three months of the rainy-season residence, but not at other times.”


116The monks thought: “How many times are there for the allocation of dwellings?”

“There are three times for the allocation of dwellings: the first, the second, and when given up in between. The first allocation is on the day after the full moon of July. The second allocation is one month after the full moon of July. The allocation of what is given up in between the two is on the day after the invitation ceremony and is for the purpose of spending the next rains residence.”

117The second section for recitation is finished.

118On one occasion Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had accepted a dwelling at Sāvatthī, but then went to a certain village monastery, where he was also allocated a dwelling. The monks there thought: “This Upananda is quarrelsome and argumentative, and creates legal issues in the Saṅgha. If he spends the rainy season here, none of us will be at ease. Well, let’s question him.”

And they said to Upananda: “Have you not been allocated a dwelling at Sāvatthī? ”


“Yes, I have.”

“But being only one person, why do you reserve two dwellings?”

“I will give up this one and take the one at Sāvatthī.”


119The monks of few desires complained and criticized him: “How could Upananda reserve two dwellings for himself?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned Upananda:

“Is it true, Upananda, that you did this?”

“It’s true, Sir.” The Buddha rebuked him …

“Foolish man, how can you reserve two dwellings for yourself? What you had been allocated at Sāvatthī, you gave up when you were allocated a dwelling here. And what you have been allocated here, you have now given up. You’re now excluded from both. This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking him … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

“A single monk should not reserve two dwellings. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”


120At one time the Buddha gave many talks about the Monastic Law, spoke in praise of the Monastic Law and of learning the Monastic Law, and he repeatedly praised Venerable Upāli. When they heard this, there were monks who thought: “Well then, let’s learn the Monastic Law from Venerable Upāli.” And many monks, both senior and junior, as well as those of middle standing, learned the Monastic Law from Upāli.

Out of respect for the senior monks, Upāli taught while standing. And out of respect for the Teaching, the senior monks, too, were standing. Both the senior monks and Upāli became tired. They told the Buddha.

“A junior monk who is teaching should sit on a similar or higher seat out of respect for the Teaching. A senior monk who is being taught should sit on a similar or lower seat out of respect for the Teaching.”


121On one occasion many monks were standing in the presence of Upāli, honoring the recitation. They became tired.

“I allow those who are entitled to a seat of the same height to sit together.”

The monks thought: “Who are entitled to a seat of the same height?”

“I allow those with a difference of three years or less in seniority to sit together.”


122On one occasion a number of monks entitled to a seat of the same height were seated on a bed; the bed broke. They were seated on the same bench; the bench broke.


“I allow a maximum of three on a bed or bench.”

The beds and benches still broke.

“I allow a maximum of two on a bed or bench.”


123At that time, being afraid of wrongdoing, monks who were not entitled to a seat of the same height did not sit together on a long seat.

“I allow those who are not entitled to a seat of the same height to sit together on a long seat, except with a _paṇḍaka_, a woman, or a hermaphrodite.”

The monks thought: “What is the size of the smallest long seat?”

“A seat for three is the smallest long seat.”


124At one time Visākhā Migāramātā wanted to build a stilt house for the benefit of the Saṅgha, including a porch and elephant globes. The monks thought: “What stilt-house equipment has the Buddha allowed and what has he not allowed?” They told the Buddha.

“I allow all stilt-house equipment.”


125At one time King Pasenadi of Kosala’s grandmother had just died. As a result, many unallowable goods were offered to the Saṅgha, that is: a high couch, a luxurious couch, a long-fleeced woolen rug, a multi-colored woolen rug, a white woolen rug, a red woolen rug, a cotton-down quilt, a woolen rug decorated with the images of predatory animals, a woolen rug with long fleece on one side, a woolen rug with long fleece on both side, a sheet of silk embroidered with gems, a silken sheet, a woolen rug like a dancers’ rug, an elephant-back rug, a horse-back rug, a carriage-seat rug, a rug made of black antelope hide, an excellent sheet made of _kadalī_-deer hide, a seat or bed with a canopy, a seat or bed with red cushions at each end.

“I allow you to use a high couch after cutting its legs down to size, to use a luxurious couch after removing the images of predatory animals, to make a pillow after removing the cotton down from the cotton-down quilt, and to make floor covers of the rest.”

#### 3.1 What is not to be given away

126At one time in a village monastery not far from Sāvatthī the resident monks were fed up with assigning dwellings for newly arrived and departing monks. They considered this and thought: “Well, let’s give all the dwellings belonging to the Saṅgha to one of us. We’ll then use what belongs to him.” And they did just that.

When newly arrived monks said to them: “Please assign us a dwelling,” they replied: “There are no dwellings belonging to the Saṅgha. They have all been given to one of us.”


“So you have given away the dwellings belonging to the Saṅgha?”


“Yes.”

The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can monks give away dwellings belonging to the Saṅgha?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks:

“Is it true, monks, that they did this?”

“It’s true, Sir.” The Buddha rebuked them,


“How can those foolish men give away dwellings belonging to the Saṅgha? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


127“There are five things not to be given away, either by a saṅgha, a group, or an individual. Even if given away, they are not actually given away. If you give any of them away, you commit a serious offense. What are the five?

A monastery or the site of a monastery;


128A dwelling or the site of a dwelling;

129A bed, bench, mattress, or pillow;

130A metal pot, a metal jar, a metal bucket, a metal bowl, a adz, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, or a chisel;


131A creeper, bamboo, reed, grass, clay, wooden goods, or ceramic goods.


These are the five things not to be given away, either by a saṅgha, a group, or an individual. Even if given away, they are not actually given away. If you give any of them away, you commit a serious offense.”

#### 3.2 What is not to be distributed

132When the Buddha had stayed at Sāvatthī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Kīṭāgiri with a large saṅgha of five hundred monks, including Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna. The monks Assaji and Punabbasuka heard about this and said: “Well, let’s share out all the dwellings belonging to the Saṅgha. Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna are in the grip of bad desires. We won’t assign dwellings to them.” And they shared out all the dwellings belonging to the Saṅgha.


133The Buddha eventually arrived at Kīṭāgiri. And he said to a group of monks:

“Go to the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka and say, ‘The Buddha is coming with a large saṅgha of five hundred monks, including Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna. Assign dwellings to the Buddha, to the Saṅgha of monks, and to Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna.’”


Saying: “Yes, Sir,” they did just that.


The monks Assaji and Punabbasuka replied: “There are no dwellings belonging to the Saṅgha; they have all been shared out to us. The Buddha is welcome and he may stay wherever he likes. But Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna are in the grip of bad desires. We won’t assign dwellings to them.”

“So you have shared out the dwellings belonging to the Saṅgha?”

“Yes.”


134The monks of few desires complained and criticized them:

“How can these monks share out dwellings belonging to the Saṅgha?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks:

“Is it true, monks, that they did this?”

“It’s true, Sir.” The Buddha rebuked them:

“How can those foolish men share out the dwellings belonging to the Saṅgha? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

135“There are five things not to be distributed, either to a saṅgha, a group, or an individual. Even if distributed, they are not actually distributed. If you distribute any of them, you commit a serious offense.


136What are the five?

A monastery or the land of a monastery;

137A dwelling or the land of a dwelling;

138A bed, bench, mattress, or pillow;

139A metal pot, a metal jar, a metal bucket, a metal bowl, a adz, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, or a chisel;


140A creeper, bamboo, reed, grass, clay, wooden goods, or ceramic goods. These are the five things not to be distributed, either to a saṅgha, a group, or an individual. Even if distributed, they are not actually distributed. If you distributed any of them, you commit a serious offense.”

#### 3.3 Discussion on putting in charge of building work

141When the Buddha had stayed at Kīṭāgiri for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Āḷavī. When he eventually arrived, he stayed at Aggāḷava Shrine.

At that time the monks of Āḷava put monks in charge of building work such as this: the mere filling of gaps, the mere plastering of walls, the mere hanging of doors, the mere making of bolt-receiving posts, the mere making of windows, the mere application of white coloring, the mere application of black coloring, the mere treatment with red ocher, the mere covering with a roof, the mere fastening of a roof, the mere fixing of cornices, the mere repair of what is defective or broken, the mere plastering of a floor; and they put monks in charge of building work for twenty years, for thirty years, for life; and they put monks in charge of building work for life on finished dwellings.


The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks at Āḷavī put monks in charge of such kinds of work?” They told the Buddha. …

“Is it true, monks, that they do this?”

“It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


“You should not put monks in charge of building work such as this: the mere filling of gaps, the mere plastering of walls, the mere hanging of doors, the mere making of bolt-receiving posts, the mere making of windows, the mere application of white coloring, the mere application of black coloring, the mere treatment with red ocher, the mere covering with a roof, the mere fastening of a roof, the mere fixing of cornices, the mere repair of what is defective or broken, or the mere plastering of a floor; and you should not put monks in charge of building work for twenty years, for thirty years, for life, or put monks in charge of building work for life on finished dwellings. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.


I allow you to put a monk in charge of building work that isn’t yet started or that’s partially complete. For a small dwelling, after inspecting the work, you may put a monk in charge of the building work for five or six years. For a small stilt house, after inspecting the work, you may put a monk in charge of the building work for seven or eight years. For a large dwelling or stilt house, after inspecting the work, you may put a monk in charge of the building work for ten or twelve years.”


142On one occasion the monks put one person in charge of building work on all the dwellings.

“You should not put one person in charge of building work on all the dwellings. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

143On one occasion the monks put one person in charge of building work on two dwellings.

“You should not put one person in charge of building work on two dwellings. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

144On one occasion the monks who had taken on building work had someone else stay in the dwelling.

“When you have taken on building work, you should not have someone else stay in that dwelling. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”


145At one time monks who had taken on building work reserved what belonged to the Saṅgha.

“When you have taken on building work, you should not reserve what belongs to the Saṅgha. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow you to take one good bed.”

146On one occasion the monks put one who was outside the monastery zone in charge of building work.

“You should not put one who is outside the monastery zone in charge of building work. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

147At one time the monks who had taken on building work reserved a dwelling at all times.

“When you have taken on building work, you should not reserve a dwelling at all times. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow you to reserve it for the three months of the rainy-season residence, but not at other times.”

148At that time monks who had taken on building work left, disrobed, died, admitted to being novice monks, admitted to having renounced the training, admitted to having committed the worst kind of offense, admitted to being insane, admitted to being deranged, admitted to being overwhelmed by pain, admitted to having been suspended for not recognizing an offense, admitted to having been suspended for not making amends for an offense, admitted to having been suspended for not giving up a bad view, admitted to being a _paṇḍaka_, admitted to be living in the community by theft, admitted to previously having left to join the monastics of another religion, admitted to being an animal, admitted to being a matricide, admitted to being a patricide, admitted to being a murderer of a perfected one, admitted to having raped a nun, admitted to having caused a schism in the Saṅgha, admitted to having caused the Buddha to bleed, admitted to being a hermaphrodite. They told the Buddha.

149“If a monk who has taken on building work departs, it should be given to another, with the thought, ‘What belongs to the Saṅgha should not be allowed to deteriorate.’

150If a monk who has taken on building work disrobes, dies, admits to being a novice monk, admits to having renounced the training, admits to having committed the worst kind of offense, admits to being insane, admits to being deranged, admits to being overwhelmed by pain, admits to having been suspended for not recognizing an offense, admits to having been suspended for not making amends for an offense, admits to having been suspended for not giving up a bad view, admits to being a _paṇḍaka_, admits to be living in the community by theft, admits to previously having left to join the monastics of another religion, admits to being an animal, admits to being a matricide, admits to being a patricide, admits to being a murderer of a perfected one, admits to having raped a nun, admits to having caused a schism in the Saṅgha, admits to having caused the Buddha to bleed, or admits to being a hermaphrodite, it should be given to another, with the thought, ‘What belongs to the Saṅgha should not be allowed to deteriorate.’


151If a monk who has taken on building work departs while it is still unfinished, it should be given to another, with the thought, ‘What belongs to the Saṅgha should not be allowed to deteriorate.’

152If a monk who has taken on building work disrobes while it is still unfinished … admits to being a hermaphrodite while it is still unfinished, it should be given to another, with the thought, ‘What belongs to the Saṅgha should not be allowed to deteriorate.’

153If a monk who has taken on building work departs when it is finished, then it is still for him.

154If a monk who has taken on building work disrobes when it is finished; dies when it is finished; admits, when it is finished, to being a novice monk; admits, when it is finished, to having renounced the training; or admits, when it is finished, to having committed the worst kind of offense, then the Saṅgha is the owner.

155If a monk who has taken on building work admits, when it is finished, to being insane; admits, when it is finished, to being deranged; admits, when it is finished, to being overwhelmed by pain; admits, when it is finished, to having been suspended for not recognizing an offense; admits, when it is finished, to having been suspended for not making amends for an offense; or admits, when it is finished, to having been suspended for not giving up a bad view, then it is still for him.

156If a monk who has taken on building work admits, when it is finished, to being a _paṇḍaka_; admits, when it is finished, to be living in the community by theft; admits, when it is finished, to previously having left to join the monastics of another religion; admits, when it is finished, to being an animal; admits, when it is finished, to being a matricide; admits, when it is finished, to being a patricide; admits, when it is finished, to being a murderer of a perfected one; admits, when it is finished, to having raped a nun; admits, when it is finished, to having caused a schism in the Saṅgha; admits, when it is finished, to having caused the Buddha to bleed; or admits, when it is finished, to being a hermaphrodite, then the Saṅgha is the owner.”

#### 3.4 The prohibition against using requisites where they don’t belong, etc.

157At one time the monks used a certain lay follower’s furniture where it did not belong. That lay follower complained and criticized them: “How can those venerables use the furniture where it doesn’t belong?” They told the Buddha.

“You should not use furniture where it doesn’t belong. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

158Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not take any equipment to the observance-day hall or to meetings, and they sat down on the bare ground. Their limbs and robes became dirty.

“I allow you to borrow.”


159At that time a large dwelling belonging to the Saṅgha was decaying. Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not remove the furniture.

“I allow you to move it for the purpose of protection.”


160On one occasion the Saṅgha was offered a valuable, woolen furniture cloth.

“I allow you to make a beneficial trade.”

161On one occasion the Saṅgha was offered a valuable furniture cloth.

“I allow you to make a beneficial trade.”


162On one occasion the Saṅgha was offered a bear skin.

“I allow you to make it into a doormat.”


163On one occasion the Saṅgha was offered a round pad.

“I allow you to make it into a doormat.”

164On one occasion the Saṅgha was offered a cloth.

“I allow you to make it into a doormat.”


165At that time there were monks who entered the dwellings with dirty feet. The dwellings became dirty.

“You should not enter a dwelling with dirty feet. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

166At that time there were monks who entered the dwellings with wet feet. The dwellings became dirty.

“You should not enter a dwelling with wet feet. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

167At that time there were monks who entered the dwellings with their sandals on. The dwellings became dirty.

“You should not enter a dwelling with your sandals on. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

168At that time there were monks who spat on treated floors. The coloring was spoiled.

“You should not spit on treated floors. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow a spittoon.”

169At that time the legs of the beds and benches scratched the treated floors. The coloring was spoiled.

“You should wrap the legs in cloth.”

170At that time there were monks who leaned on treated walls. The coloring was spoiled.

“You should not lean on treated walls. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow a leaning board.”

The lower edge of the leaning boards scratched the floor and the upper edge the wall.

“You should wrap the lower and upper edges in cloth.”


171Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not lie down with washed feet.

“You should spread a sheet and then lie down.”

#### 3.5 The allowance for meals for the Saṅgha, etc.

172When the Buddha had stayed at Āḷavī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Rājagaha. When he eventually arrived, he stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.

At that time Rājagaha was short of food and people were not able to make meals for the Saṅgha. Instead they wished to make meals for designated monks, invitational meals, meals for which lots are drawn, half-monthly meals, meals on the observance day, and meals on the day after the observance day.

“I allow meals for the Saṅgha, meals for designated monks, invitational meals, meals for which lots are drawn, half-monthly meals, meals on the observance days, and meals on the days after the observance day.”

#### 3.6 The appointment of a designator of meals

173At that time the monks from the group of six took the best meals for themselves and gave the inferior ones to the other monks.

“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the designator of meals: he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows what has and has not been designated. And he should be appointed like this. First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

174‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should appoint monk so-and-so as designator of meals. This is the motion.

175Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The Saṅgha appoints monk so-and-so as designator of meals. Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as designator of meals should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.

176The Saṅgha has appointed monk so-and-so as designator of meals. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”

177The monks who were designator of meals thought: “How should we designate the meals?”

“You should mark the tickets and make a heap of them, and then designate the meals.”

#### 3.7 The appointment of assigners of dwellings, etc.

178At that time there was no assigner of dwellings … no storeman … no receiver of robe-cloth … no distributor of robe-cloth … no distributor of rice porridge … no distributor of fruit … no distributor of fresh foods. Because it was not shared out, the fresh food perished.

“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the distributor of fresh foods: he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows what has and has not been shared out. And he should be appointed like this. First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

179‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should appoint monk so-and-so as distributor of fresh foods. This is the motion.

180Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The Saṅgha appoints monk so-and-so as distributor of fresh foods. Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as distributor of fresh foods should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.

181The Saṅgha has appointed monk so-and-so as distributor of fresh foods. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”

#### 3.8 The appointment of distributors of minor requisites

182At that time there were minor requisites in the storeroom.

“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the distributor of minor requisites: he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows what has and has not been distributed. And he should be appointed like this. First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

183‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should appoint monk so-and-so as distributor of minor requisites. This is the motion.

184Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The Saṅgha appoints monk so-and-so as distributor of minor requisites. Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as distributor of minor requisites should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.

185The Saṅgha has appointed monk so-and-so as distributor of minor requisites. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”


186The monk who is the distributor of minor requisites should give out, one by one: needles, knives, sandals, belts, shoulder straps, water filters, water strainers; and robe material for long inter-panel strips, short inter-panel strips, large panels, medium-sized panels, lengthwise borders, and crosswise borders.

If the Saṅgha has ghee, oil, honey, or syrup, he should give it out for a single use. If it is needed again, he should give it out again.

#### 3.9 The appointment of distributors of rainy-season bathing cloths, etc.

187At that time there was no distributor of rainy-season bathing cloths … no distributor of almsbowls … no supervisor of monastery workers … no supervisor of novice monks. Not being supervised, the novice monks didn’t do their work.

“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the supervisor of novice monks: he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows who is and is not supervised. And he should be appointed like this. First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

188‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should appoint monk so-and-so as supervisor of novice monks. This is the motion.

189Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The Saṅgha appoints monk so-and-so as supervisor of novice monks. Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as supervisor of novice monks should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.

190The Saṅgha has appointed monk so-and-so as supervisor of novice monks. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”


191The third section for recitation is finished.

The sixth chapter on dwellings is finished.

193He has conquered all and knows the world,  
The Leader intent on what’s beneficial:  
It’s for the sake of shelter and happiness,  
To attain absorption and to see clearly.
