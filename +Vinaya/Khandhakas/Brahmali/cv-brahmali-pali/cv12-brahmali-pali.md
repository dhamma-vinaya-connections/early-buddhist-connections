1At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time monks on probation consented to regular monks bowing down to them, standing up for them, raising their joined palms to them, doing acts of respect toward them, offering them a seat, offering them a bed, offering them water for washing their feet and a foot stool, offering them a foot scraper, receiving their bowl and robe, and massaging their backs when bathing. The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can monks on probation consent to these things?” They told the Buddha.

2Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks:

“Is it true, monks, that the monks on probation are consenting to these things?”

“It’s true, Sir.”


The Buddha rebuked them … “It’s not suitable … How can monks on probation consent to these things? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:


“A monk on probation shouldn’t consent to:


Regular monks bowing down to him;

Regular monks standing up for him;


Regular monks raising their joined palms to him;

Regular monks offering him water for washing his feet and a foot stool;


Regular monks offering him a foot scraper;

Regular monks receiving his bowl and robe;

Regular monks massaging his back when he’s bathing.


If he consents to any of these, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.


3Monks on probation should do the following with one another according to seniority: bow down, stand up, raise their joined palms, do acts of respect, offer a seat, offer a bed, offer water for washing the feet and a foot stool, offer a foot scraper, receive bowl and robe, and massage one another’s backs when bathing.

4Monks on probation should do five things with regular monks according to seniority: the observance-day ceremony, the invitation ceremony, distributing rainy-season robes, meal invitations, and meals.


5And now I will lay down the proper conduct for a monk on probation.

28If, as the fourth member of a group, he gives probation,

sends back to the beginning,

or gives the trial period,


or as the twentieth member of a group, he rehabilitates, it’s invalid and not to be done.”


29The ninety-four kinds of proper conduct for one on probation are finished.

30Soon afterwards Venerable Upāli went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said: “How many things are there, Venerable Sir, that stop a monk on probation from counting a particular day toward his probationary period?”

“There are three such things, Upāli: he stays in the same room as a regular monk; he stays apart from other monks; he doesn’t inform other monks of his status.”

31On one occasion a large saṅgha of monks had gathered at Sāvatthī. The monks on probation were unable to fulfill their probationary duties. They told the Buddha.

“I allow you to set aside the probation.

And it should be done like this. The monk on probation should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, ‘I set aside the probation,’ or ‘I set aside the proper conduct.’”

32Soon afterwards the monks at Sāvatthī left for various destinations. The monks on probation were once again able to fulfill their probationary duties. They told the Buddha.

“I allow you to take up the probation.

And it should be done like this. The monk on probation should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, ‘I take up the probation,’ or ‘I take up the proper conduct.’”

33The proper conduct for those on probation is finished.

75At this time monks undertaking the trial period consented to regular monks bowing down to them, standing up for them, raising their joined palms to them, doing acts of respect toward them, offering them a seat, offering them a bed, offering them water for washing their feet and a foot stool, offering them a foot scraper, receiving their bowl and robe, and massaging their backs when bathing. The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can monks undertaking the trial period consent to these things?” The monks told the Buddha.


76Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks:

“Is it true, monks, that monks undertaking the trial period consent to these things?”

“It’s true, Sir.”


The Buddha rebuked them …

“It’s not suitable … How can monks undertaking the trial period consent to these things? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

96If, as the fourth member of a group, he gives probation, sends back to the beginning, or gives the trial period, or as the twentieth member of a group, he rehabilitates, it’s invalid and not to be done.”

97Soon afterwards Venerable Upāli went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said: “How many things are there, Venerable Sir, that stop a monk undertaking the trial period from counting a particular day toward his trial period?”

“There are four such things, Upāli: he stays in the same room as a regular monk; he stays apart from other monks; he doesn’t inform other monks of his status; he travels without a group.”


98On one occasion a large saṅgha of monks had gathered at Sāvatthī. The monks undertaking the trial period were unable to fulfill their duties. They told the Buddha.

“I allow you to set aside the trial period.

And it should be done like this. The monk undertaking the trial period should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, ‘I set aside the trial period,’

or ‘I set aside the proper conduct.’”


99Soon afterwards the monks at Sāvatthī left for various destinations. The monks undertaking the trial period were again able to fulfill their duties. They told the Buddha.

“I allow you to take up the trial period.

And it should be done like this. The monk undertaking the trial period should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, ‘I take up the trial period,’ or ‘I take up the proper conduct.’”

113The proper conduct for those deserving rehabilitation is finished.

The chapter on those on probation is finished.

In this chapter there are five topics.


This is the summary:

115“Those on probation consented to  
The regular monks  
Bowing down to them, standing up,  
And raising their joint palms, acting respectfully.

116Offering a seat, a bed,  
Foot, stool, scraper;  
Bowl, massaging when bathing,  
And the good monk criticized them.

117Wrong conduct for one who consents,  
Mutual, five things according to seniority;  
The observance day, the invitation ceremony,  
Rainy-season robes, invitations, meals.

118And proper conduct there,  
Walking in front of a regular one;  
And whatever is the last,  
And just so attending on.

119Wilderness, alms, bringing back,  
About new arrivals, on the observance day;  
On the invitation day, by messenger,  
And he may go to a place with monks.

120And in the same room, getting up,  
And just so he should invite;  
On a seat, on a lower, on a walking path,  
On the ground, and with walking path.

121With one who is more senior, invalid,  
And stop the counting, fulfilling;  
Setting aside, taking up,  
Just the duties for one on probation.

122To the beginning, deserving the trial,  
So those undertaking the trial;  
And also the method for deserving rehabilitation,  
Again putting together from the method.

123Three for those on probation,  
Four for those undergoing the trial;  
Are not the same in regard to stopping the count,  
And daily for the trial period;  
Two procedures are such, the remaining  
Three procedures are the same.”

124The chapter on those on probation is finished.

Mithu pañca yathāvuḍḍhaṁ;  
Uposathaṁ pavāraṇaṁ,  
Vassikoṇojabhojanaṁ.

118p_4V_491Sammā ca vattanā tattha,  
pakatattassa gacchantaṁ;  
Yo ca hoti pariyanto,  
pure pacchā tatheva ca.

119p_4V_492 Āraññapiṇḍanīhāro,  
āgantuke uposathe;  
Pavāraṇāya dūtena,  
gantabbo ca sabhikkhuko.

120p_4V_493Ekacchanne ca vuṭṭhānaṁ,  
tatheva ca nimantaye;  
Āsane nīce caṅkame,  
chamāyaṁ caṅkamena ca.

121p_4V_494Vuḍḍhatarena akammaṁ,  
ratticchedā ca sodhanā;  
Nikkhipanaṁ samādānaṁ,  
vattaṁva pārivāsike.

122p_4V_495Mūlāya mānattārahā,  
tathā mānattacārikā;  
Abbhānārahe nayo cāpi,  
sambhedaṁ nayato puna.

123p_4V_496Pārivāsikesu tayo,  
catu mānattacārike;  
Na samenti ratticchedesu,  
mānattesu ca devasi;  
Dve kammā sadisā sesā,  
tayo kammā samāsamāti.

124p_4V_497Pārivāsikakkhandhakaṁ niṭṭhitaṁ.
