234.The Story of the Monk Kassapagotta

380. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā campāyaṃ viharati gaggarāya pokkharaṇiyā tīre. Tena kho pana samayena kāsīsu janapade vāsabhagāmo nāma hoti. Tattha kassapagotto nāma bhikkhu āvāsiko hoti tantibaddho ussukkaṃ āpanno – kinti anāgatā ca pesalā bhikkhū āgaccheyyuṃ, āgatā ca pesalā bhikkhū phāsu vihareyyuṃ, ayañca āvāso vuddhiṃ viruḷhiṃ vepullaṃ āpajjeyyāti. Tena kho pana samayena sambahulā bhikkhū kāsīsu cārikaṃ caramānā yena vāsabhagāmo tadavasaruṃ. Addasā kho kassapagotto bhikkhu te bhikkhū dūratova āgacchante, disvāna āsanaṃ paññapesi, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipi, paccuggantvā pattacīvaraṃ paṭiggahesi, pānīyena āpucchi, nahāne ussukkaṃ akāsi, ussukkampi akāsi yāguyā khādanīye bhattasmiṃ. Atha kho tesaṃ āgantukānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘bhaddako kho ayaṃ, āvuso, āvāsiko bhikkhu nahāne ussukkaṃ karoti, ussukkampi karoti yāguyā khādanīye bhattasmiṃ. Handa, mayaṃ, āvuso, idheva vāsabhagāme nivāsaṃ kappemā’’ti. Atha kho te āgantukā bhikkhū tattheva vāsabhagāme nivāsaṃ kappesuṃ.

380.At that time the Blessed One, the Buddha, was staying at Campā on the bank of the Gaggarā Pond. Now at that time there was a village named Vāsabhagāma in the Kāsī country. There a monk named Kassapagotta was residing, bound by duty and zealous, thinking: "How may virtuous monks who have not yet come arrive, and how may those virtuous monks who have come dwell at ease, and how may this residence prosper, increase, and expand?" At that time, several monks traveling through the Kāsī country arrived at Vāsabhagāma. The monk Kassapagotta saw those monks approaching from a distance. Seeing them, he prepared seats, set out foot-washing water, a footstool, and a foot-wiping cloth, went out to meet them, received their bowls and robes, offered them drinking water, made an effort for their bathing, and also made an effort regarding their rice gruel, solid food, and meal. Then those visiting monks thought: "This resident monk is excellent, friends—he makes an effort for our bathing and also makes an effort regarding rice gruel, solid food, and the meal. Come, friends, let us take up residence right here in Vāsabhagāma." So those visiting monks took up residence right there in Vāsabhagāma.

Atha kho kassapagottassa bhikkhuno etadahosi – ‘‘yo kho imesaṃ āgantukānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ āgantukakilamatho so paṭippassaddho. Yepime gocare appakataññuno tedānime gocare pakataññuno. Dukkaraṃ kho pana parakulesu yāvajīvaṃ ussukkaṃ kātuṃ, viññatti ca manussānaṃ amanāpā. Yaṃnūnāhaṃ na ussukkaṃ kareyyaṃ yāguyā khādanīye bhattasmi’’nti. So na ussukkaṃ akāsi yāguyā khādanīye bhattasmiṃ. Atha kho tesaṃ āgantukānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘pubbe khvāyaṃ, āvuso, āvāsiko bhikkhu nahāne ussukkaṃ akāsi, ussukkampi akāsi yāguyā khādanīye bhattasmiṃ. Sodānāyaṃ na ussukkaṃ karoti yāguyā khādanīye bhattasmiṃ. Duṭṭhodānāyaṃ, āvuso, āvāsiko bhikkhu. Handa, mayaṃ, āvuso, āvāsikaṃ [imaṃ āvāsikaṃ (syā.)] bhikkhuṃ ukkhipāmā’’ti. Atha kho te āgantukā bhikkhū sannipatitvā kassapagottaṃ bhikkhuṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘pubbe kho tvaṃ, āvuso, nahāne ussukkaṃ karosi, ussukkampi karosi yāguyā khādanīye bhattasmiṃ. Sodāni tvaṃ na ussukkaṃ karosi yāguyā khādanīye bhattasmiṃ. Āpattiṃ tvaṃ, āvuso, āpanno. Passasetaṃ āpatti’’nti? ‘‘Natthi me, āvuso, āpatti, yamahaṃ passeyya’’nti. Atha kho te āgantukā bhikkhū kassapagottaṃ bhikkhuṃ āpattiyā adassane ukkhipiṃsu.

Then the monk Kassapagotta thought: "Now the fatigue of these newly arrived monks is calmed. These who were previously unaccustomed to the alms round, now are accustomed to the alms round. But it is difficult to be constantly zealous in others' families throughout one's life, and requests are displeasing to people. Why don't I cease to be zealous regarding rice-gruel, solid food, and meals?" So he ceased to be zealous regarding rice-gruel, solid food, and meals. Then those newly arrived monks thought: "Previously, friends, this resident monk used to be zealous regarding washing/bathing, and was also zealous regarding rice-gruel, solid food, and meals. But now he is not zealous regarding rice-gruel, solid food, and meals. The resident monk is surely corrupted, friends. Come, friends, let us suspend the resident monk." Then those newly arrived monks gathered together and said to the monk Kassapagotta: "Previously, friend, you were zealous regarding washing/bathing, and were also zealous regarding rice-gruel, solid food, and meals. But now you are not zealous regarding rice-gruel, solid food, and meals. You have fallen into an offense, friend. Do you see that offense?" "There is no offense for me to see, friends." Then those newly arrived monks suspended the monk Kassapagotta for non-acknowledgment of the offense.

Atha kho kassapagottassa bhikkhuno etadahosi – ‘‘ahaṃ kho etaṃ na jānāmi ‘āpatti vā esā anāpatti vā, āpanno camhi [vamhi (?)] anāpanno vā, ukkhitto camhi anukkhitto vā, dhammikena vā adhammikena vā, kuppena vā akuppena vā, ṭhānārahena vā aṭṭhānārahena vā’.

Atha kho te, bhante, āgantukā bhikkhū maṃ āpattiyā adassane ukkhipiṃsu. Tassa mayhaṃ, bhante, etadahosi – ‘ahaṃ kho etaṃ na jānāmi ‘āpatti vā esā anāpatti vā, āpanno camhi anāpanno vā, ukkhitto camhi anukkhitto vā, dhammikena vā adhammikena vā, kuppena vā akuppena vā, ṭhānārahena vā aṭṭhānārahena vā’.

Then the monk Kassapagotta thought: "I do not know whether this is an offense or not, whether I have committed an offense or not, whether I have been suspended or not, whether it was done lawfully or unlawfully, whether it is valid or invalid, whether it is worthy of being upheld or not. Why don’t I go to Campā and ask the Blessed One about this matter?" So the monk Kassapagotta put his dwelling in order, took his bowl and robe, and set out for Campā. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Campā and approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. It was customary for the Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, to exchange greetings with visiting monks. Then the Blessed One said to the monk Kassapagotta: "I hope you are well, monk, I hope you are keeping well, I hope your journey was not too troublesome. Where have you come from, monk?" "I am well, Blessed One, I am keeping well, Venerable Sir, and my journey was not too troublesome. There is, Venerable Sir, a village named Vāsabhagāma in the Kāsī country. There I was a resident monk, bound by duty and zealous, thinking: ‘How may virtuous monks who have not yet come arrive, and how may those who have already come dwell at ease, and how may this residence flourish and prosper?’ Then, Venerable Sir, a number of monks traveling through Kāsī arrived at Vāsabhagāma. I saw those monks coming from afar, and having seen them, I prepared seats, set out foot-washing water, a footstool, and a foot-towel, went out to meet them, received their bowls and robes, offered them drinking water, made an effort for their bathing, and also made an effort regarding their gruel, solid food, and meal. Then, Venerable Sir, those visiting monks thought: ‘This resident monk is excellent—he makes an effort for our bathing and also makes an effort regarding our gruel, solid food, and meal. Come, friends, let us take up residence right here in Vāsabhagāma.’ So, Venerable Sir, those visiting monks took up residence there in Vāsabhagāma. Then, Venerable Sir, I thought: ‘The fatigue of these visiting monks has subsided. Those who were unfamiliar with the almsround are now familiar with it. But it is difficult to keep making an effort for others’ households for a lifetime, and people find requests disagreeable. Why don’t I stop making an effort regarding their gruel, solid food, and meal?’ So, Venerable Sir, I stopped making an effort regarding their gruel, solid food, and meal. Then, Venerable Sir, those visiting monks thought: ‘Previously, this resident monk made an effort for our bathing and also made an effort regarding our gruel, solid food, and meal. But now he no longer makes an effort regarding our gruel, solid food, and meal. This resident monk has become bad. Come, friends, let us suspend this resident monk.’ Then, Venerable Sir, those visiting monks assembled and said to me: ‘Previously, friend, you made an effort for our bathing and also made an effort regarding our gruel, solid food, and meal. But now you no longer make an effort regarding our gruel, solid food, and meal. You have committed an offense, friend. Acknowledge this offense.’ ‘I have no offense to acknowledge, friends.’ Then, Venerable Sir, those visiting monks suspended me for not acknowledging an offense. Then, Venerable Sir, I thought: ‘I do not know whether this is an offense or not, whether I have committed an offense or not, whether I have been suspended or not, whether it was done lawfully or unlawfully, whether it is valid or invalid, whether it is worthy of being upheld or not. Why don’t I go to Campā and ask the Blessed One about this matter?’ So, Blessed One, I have come here." "There is no offense, monk, this is not an offense. You have not committed an offense, you have not been suspended. You have been suspended by an unlawful act, an invalid act, unworthy of being upheld. Go, monk, take up residence right there in Vāsabhagāma." "Yes, Venerable Sir," replied the monk Kassapagotta. Having assented to the Blessed One, he rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and set out for Vāsabhagāma.

381. Atha kho tesaṃ āgantukānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ ahudeva kukkuccaṃ, ahu vippaṭisāro – ‘‘alābhā vata no, na vata no lābhā, dulladdhaṃ vata no, na vata no suladdhaṃ, ye mayaṃ suddhaṃ bhikkhuṃ anāpattikaṃ avatthusmiṃ akāraṇe ukkhipimhā.

Āciṇṇaṃ kho panetaṃ buddhānaṃ bhagavantānaṃ āgantukehi bhikkhūhi saddhiṃ paṭisammodituṃ. Atha kho bhagavā te bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘kacci, bhikkhave, khamanīyaṃ, kacci yāpanīyaṃ, kaccittha appakilamathena addhānaṃ āgatā, kuto ca tumhe, bhikkhave, āgacchathā’’ti? ‘‘Khamanīyaṃ, bhagavā; yāpanīyaṃ, bhagavā; appakilamathena ca mayaṃ, bhante, addhānaṃ āgatā. Atthi, bhante, kāsīsu janapade vāsabhagāmo nāma. Tato mayaṃ, bhagavā, āgacchāmā’’ti. ‘‘Tumhe, bhikkhave, āvāsikaṃ bhikkhuṃ ukkhipitthā’’ti? ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti. ‘‘Kismiṃ, bhikkhave, vatthusmiṃ kāraṇe’’ti? ‘‘Avatthusmiṃ, bhagavā, akāraṇe’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā – ‘‘ananucchavikaṃ, moghapurisā, ananulomikaṃ appatirūpaṃ assāmaṇakaṃ akappiyaṃ akaraṇīyaṃ. Kathañhi nāma tumhe, moghapurisā, suddhaṃ bhikkhuṃ anāpattikaṃ avatthusmiṃ akāraṇe ukkhipissatha. Netaṃ, moghapurisā, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe…’’ vigarahitvā dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, suddho bhikkhu anāpattiko avatthusmiṃ akāraṇe ukkhipitabbo. Yo ukkhipeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

381.Then those visiting monks experienced remorse and regret: "Alas for us, it is no gain for us; alas for us, it is ill-gotten, not well-gotten for us, that we have suspended a pure monk without offense, without grounds, without reason. Come, friends, let us go to Campā and confess our offense as an offense in the presence of the Blessed One." Then those visiting monks put their lodging in order, took their bowls and robes, and set out for Campā. Gradually, they arrived at Campā and approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. It is customary for the Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, to exchange greetings with visiting monks. Then the Blessed One addressed those monks: "I hope, monks, you are well; I hope you are comfortable; I hope you have come without much difficulty on the journey. And where have you come from, monks?" "We are well, Blessed One; we are comfortable, Blessed One; and we have come, venerable sir, without much difficulty on the journey. There is, venerable sir, a village called Vāsabhagāma in the Kāsī country. From there, Blessed One, we have come." "Monks, did you suspend a resident monk?" "Yes, venerable sir." "For what reason, monks, on what grounds?" "Without grounds, Blessed One, without reason." The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked them: "It is unseemly, foolish men, unsuitable, unbecoming, unworthy of ascetics, improper, not to be done. How could you, foolish men, suspend a pure monk without offense, without grounds, without reason? This, foolish men, will not cause confidence to arise in those who lack it…" Having rebuked them, he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: "Monks, a pure monk without offense should not be suspended without grounds, without reason. Whoever suspends him incurs an offense of wrong-doing."

Atha kho te bhikkhū uṭṭhāyāsanā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā bhagavato pādesu sirasā nipatitvā bhagavantaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘accayo no, bhante, accagamā yathābāle yathāmūḷhe yathāakusale, ye mayaṃ suddhaṃ bhikkhuṃ anāpattikaṃ avatthusmiṃ akāraṇe ukkhipimhā. Tesaṃ no, bhante, bhagavā accayaṃ accayato paṭiggaṇhātu āyatiṃ saṃvarāyā’’ti. ‘‘Taggha, tumhe, bhikkhave, accayo accagamā yathābāle yathāmūḷhe yathāakusale, ye tumhe suddhaṃ bhikkhuṃ anāpattikaṃ avatthusmiṃ akāraṇe ukkhipittha. Yato ca kho tumhe, bhikkhave, accayaṃ accayato disvā yathādhammaṃ paṭikarotha, taṃ vo mayaṃ paṭiggaṇhāma. Vuddhihesā, bhikkhave, ariyassa vinaye yo accayaṃ accayato disvā yathādhammaṃ paṭikaroti, āyatiṃ [āyatiṃ ca (sī.)] saṃvaraṃ āpajjatī’’ti.

Then those monks rose from their seats, arranged their upper robes over one shoulder, bowed down at the feet of the Blessed One, and said to him: "We have committed an offense, venerable sir, we have acted as fools, as deluded ones, as unskillful ones, in that we suspended a pure monk who was innocent, on a baseless and groundless charge. May the Blessed One, venerable sir, accept our offense as an offense, for the sake of restraint in the future." "Indeed, monks, you have committed an offense, you have acted as fools, as deluded ones, as unskillful ones, in that you suspended a pure monk who was innocent, on a baseless and groundless charge. But since you, monks, having seen your offense as an offense, make amends according to the Dhamma, we accept it of you. For this, monks, is growth in the Noble One's discipline, that having seen an offense as an offense, one makes amends according to the Dhamma and undertakes restraint for the future."

Kassapagottabhikkhuvatthu niṭṭhitaṃ.

The story about the monk Kassapagotta is concluded.

235.Speaking about unlawful factional and other acts.

382. Tena kho pana samayena campāyaṃ bhikkhū evarūpāni kammāni karonti – adhammena vaggakammaṃ karonti, adhammena samaggakammaṃ karonti; dhammena vaggakammaṃ karonti, dhammapatirūpakena vaggakammaṃ karonti; dhammapatirūpakena samaggakammaṃ karonti; ekopi ekaṃ ukkhipati, ekopi dve ukkhipati, ekopi sambahule ukkhipati, ekopi saṅghaṃ ukkhipati; dvepi ekaṃ ukkhipanti, dvepi dve ukkhipanti, dvepi sambahule ukkhipanti, dvepi saṅghaṃ ukkhipanti; sambahulāpi ekaṃ ukkhipanti; sambahulāpi dve ukkhipanti, sambahulāpi sambahule ukkhipanti, sambahulāpi saṅghaṃ ukkhipanti; saṅghopi saṅghaṃ ukkhipati.

382.At that time, at Campā the monks were doing such things: they were performing factional acts unlawfully, they were performing concordant acts unlawfully; they were performing factional acts lawfully, they were performing factional acts in the guise of the Dhamma; they were performing concordant acts in the guise of the Dhamma; one monk suspended one monk, one monk suspended two monks, one monk suspended many monks, one monk suspended the Saṅgha; two monks suspended one monk, two monks suspended two monks, two monks suspended many monks, two monks suspended the Saṅgha; many monks suspended one monk; many monks suspended two monks, many monks suspended many monks, many monks suspended the Saṅgha; the Saṅgha suspended the Saṅgha. Those monks who were of few desires… complained, criticised, and spread it about, saying: “How can the monks in Campā do such things: perform factional acts unlawfully, perform concordant acts unlawfully, perform factional acts lawfully, perform factional acts in the guise of the Dhamma, perform concordant acts in the guise of the Dhamma, one monk suspending one monk, one monk suspending two monks, one monk suspending many monks, one monk suspending the Saṅgha, two monks suspending one monk, two monks suspending two monks, two monks suspending many monks, two monks suspending the Saṅgha, many monks suspending one monk, many monks suspending two monks, many monks suspending many monks, many monks suspending the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha suspending the Saṅgha?” Then those monks told this matter to the Blessed One… “Is it true, monks, that the monks in Campā are doing such things: performing factional acts unlawfully… the Saṅgha suspending the Saṅgha?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked them: “It is unfitting, monks, unsuitable, unbecoming, unworthy of ascetics, unallowable, and not to be done by those foolish men. How can those foolish men, monks, do such things: perform factional acts unlawfully… the Saṅgha suspending the Saṅgha? This, monks, will not lead to confidence in those who lack it… Having rebuked them… he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks:

383. ‘‘Adhammena ce, bhikkhave, vaggakammaṃ akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ, adhammena [adhammena ce bhikkhave (syā.)] samaggakammaṃ akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ, dhammena vaggakammaṃ akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ; dhammapatirūpakena vaggakammaṃ akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ, dhammapatirūpakena samaggakammaṃ akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ; ekopi ekaṃ ukkhipati akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ, ekopi dve ukkhipati akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ, ekopi sambahule ukkhipati akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ, ekopi saṅghaṃ ukkhipati akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ; dvepi ekaṃ ukkhipanti akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ, dvepi dve ukkhipanti akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ, dvepi sambahule ukkhipanti akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ, dvepi saṅghaṃ ukkhipanti akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ; sambahulāpi ekaṃ ukkhipanti akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ, sambahulāpi dve ukkhipanti akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ, sambahulāpi sambahule ukkhipanti akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ, sambahulāpi saṅghaṃ ukkhipanti akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ; saṅghopi saṅghaṃ ukkhipati akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ.

383.“Monks, if a factional act is done unlawfully, it is invalid and should not be carried out. If a concordant act is done unlawfully, it is invalid and should not be carried out. If a factional act is done lawfully, it is invalid and should not be carried out. If a factional act is done in the guise of the Dhamma, it is invalid and should not be carried out. If a concordant act is done in the guise of the Dhamma, it is invalid and should not be carried out. If even one person suspends one, it is invalid and should not be carried out.

384."Monks, there are these four kinds of acts: a factional act done unrighteously, a unanimous act done unrighteously, a factional act done righteously, and a unanimous act done righteously. Herein, monks, a factional act done unrighteously is liable to be overturned and unfit to stand because it is unrighteous and factional. Such an act should not be done, nor have I approved of such an act. Herein, monks, a unanimous act done unrighteously is liable to be overturned and unfit to stand because it is unrighteous. Such an act should not be done, nor have I approved of such an act. Herein, monks, a factional act done righteously is liable to be overturned and unfit to stand because it is factional.

Herein, monks, a unanimous act done righteously is not liable to be overturned and fit to stand because it is righteous and unanimous. Such an act should be done, and I have approved of such an act. Therefore, monks, ‘We will perform only such acts as are righteous and unanimous’—thus should you train yourselves."

385.Now at that time the monks of the group of six were performing such acts: they performed factional acts unrighteously, they performed unanimous acts unrighteously; they performed factional acts righteously, they performed factional acts in semblance of the Dhamma, they performed unanimous acts in semblance of the Dhamma; they performed acts with a defective motion but a complete proclamation, they performed acts with a defective proclamation but a complete motion, they performed acts with both a defective motion and a defective proclamation; they performed acts apart from the Dhamma, they performed acts apart from the Discipline, they performed acts apart from the Teacher’s instruction; they even performed an act that was protested against, unrighteous, liable to be overturned, and unfit to stand. The monks who were modest … complained, grumbled, and criticized them: “How can the monks of the group of six perform such acts: performing factional acts unrighteously, performing unanimous acts unrighteously; performing factional acts righteously, performing factional acts in semblance of the Dhamma, performing unanimous acts in semblance of the Dhamma; performing acts with a defective motion but a complete proclamation, performing acts with a defective proclamation but a complete motion, performing acts with both a defective motion and a defective proclamation; performing acts apart from the Dhamma, performing acts apart from the Discipline, performing acts apart from the Teacher’s instruction; even performing an act that was protested against, unrighteous, liable to be overturned, and unfit to stand?” Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. … “Is it true, monks, that the monks of the group of six perform such acts: performing factional acts unrighteously … even performing an act that was protested against, unrighteous, liable to be overturned, and unfit to stand?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One rebuked them … Having rebuked them, he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks:

386. ‘‘Adhammena ce, bhikkhave, vaggakammaṃ akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ; adhammena samaggakammaṃ akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ; dhammena vaggakammaṃ akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ; dhammapatirūpakena vaggakammaṃ akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ; dhammapatirūpakena samaggakammaṃ akammaṃ na ca karaṇīyaṃ.

386."Monks, if a factional act is done unrighteously, it is invalid and should not be carried out. If a unanimous act is done unrighteously, it is invalid and should not be carried out. If a factional act is done righteously, it is invalid and should not be carried out. If a factional act is done in semblance of the Dhamma, it is invalid and should not be carried out. If a unanimous act is done in semblance of the Dhamma, it is invalid and should not be carried out. Monks, if an act is deficient in the motion but complete in the proclamation, it is invalid and should not be carried out. If an act is deficient in the proclamation but complete in the motion, it is invalid and should not be carried out. If an act is deficient in both motion and proclamation, it is invalid and should not be carried out. An act apart from the Dhamma is invalid and should not be carried out. An act apart from the Discipline is invalid and should not be carried out. An act apart from the Teacher's instruction is invalid and should not be carried out. Monks, if an act is protested against, unrighteous, liable to be overturned, and unfit to stand, it is invalid and should not be carried out."

387. Chayimāni, bhikkhave, kammāni – adhammakammaṃ, vaggakammaṃ, samaggakammaṃ, dhammapatirūpakena vaggakammaṃ, dhammapatirūpakena samaggakammaṃ, dhammena samaggakammaṃ.

387.Monks, there are these six kinds of acts: an unrighteous act, a factional act, a unanimous act, a factional act in semblance of the Dhamma, a unanimous act in semblance of the Dhamma, and a unanimous act done righteously.

Katamañca, bhikkhave, adhammakammaṃ? Ñattidutiye ce, bhikkhave, kamme ekāya ñattiyā kammaṃ karoti, na ca kammavācaṃ anussāveti – adhammakammaṃ.

And what, monks, is an unrighteous act? Monks, in a motion-and-one-proclamation act, if one performs the act with one motion but does not recite the proclamation—that is an unrighteous act. If one performs the act with two motions but does not recite the proclamation—that is an unrighteous act. If one performs the act with one proclamation but does not propose the motion—that is an unrighteous act. If one performs the act with two proclamations but does not propose the motion—that is an unrighteous act. Monks, in a motion-and-three-proclamations act, if one performs the act with one motion but does not recite the proclamation—that is an unrighteous act. If one performs the act with two motions but does not recite the proclamation—that is an unrighteous act. If one performs the act with three motions but does not recite the proclamation—that is an unrighteous act. If one performs the act with four motions but does not recite the proclamation—that is an unrighteous act.

If one performs the act with three proclamations but does not propose the motion—that is an unrighteous act. If one performs the act with four proclamations but does not propose the motion—that is an unrighteous act. This, monks, is called an unrighteous act.

239.Discourse on Two Kinds of Expulsion

395. Dvemā, bhikkhave, nissāraṇā. Atthi, bhikkhave, puggalo appatto nissāraṇaṃ. Tañce saṅgho nissāreti, ekacco sunissārito, ekacco dunnissārito. Katamo ca, bhikkhave, puggalo appatto nissāraṇaṃ, tañce saṅgho nissāreti – dunnissārito? Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu suddho hoti anāpattiko. Tañce saṅgho nissāreti – dunnissārito. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, puggalo appatto nissāraṇaṃ, tañce saṅgho nissāreti – dunnissārito.

395.Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of expulsion. There is, bhikkhus, a person not eligible for expulsion. If the Saṅgha expels such a person, some are well-expelled, and some are badly-expelled. And who, bhikkhus, is the person not eligible for expulsion, whom if the Saṅgha expels—he is badly-expelled? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is pure and blameless. If the Saṅgha expels him—he is badly-expelled. This, bhikkhus, is called the person not eligible for expulsion, whom if the Saṅgha expels—he is badly-expelled.

Katamo ca, bhikkhave, puggalo appatto nissāraṇaṃ, tañce saṅgho nissāreti – sunissārito? Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu bālo hoti abyatto āpattibahulo anapadāno, gihisaṃsaṭṭho viharati ananulomikehi gihisaṃsaggehi, tañce saṅgho nissāreti – sunissārito. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, puggalo appatto nissāraṇaṃ, tañce saṅgho nissāreti – sunissārito.

And what, bhikkhus, is the person not eligible for expulsion, whom if the Saṅgha expels—he is well-expelled? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is foolish, incompetent, full of offenses, unrepentant, living in association with householders in unsuitable ways, engaging in inappropriate interactions with householders. If the Saṅgha expels him—he is well-expelled. This, bhikkhus, is called the person not eligible for expulsion, whom if the Saṅgha expels—he is well-expelled.

396. Dvemā, bhikkhave, osāraṇā. Atthi, bhikkhave, puggalo appatto osāraṇaṃ tañce saṅgho osāreti, ekacco sosārito, ekacco dosārito. Katamo ca, bhikkhave, puggalo appatto osāraṇaṃ, tañce saṅgho osāreti – dosārito? Paṇḍako, bhikkhave, appatto osāraṇaṃ, tañce saṅgho osāreti – dosārito. Theyyasaṃvāsako, bhikkhave, appatto osāraṇaṃ, tañce saṅgho osāreti – dosārito. Titthiyapakkantako, bhikkhave…pe… tiracchānagato, bhikkhave… mātughātako, bhikkhave… pitughātako, bhikkhave… arahantaghātako, bhikkhave… bhikkhunidūsako, bhikkhave… saṅghabhedako, bhikkhave… lohituppādako, bhikkhave… ubhatobyañjanako, bhikkhave, appatto, osāraṇaṃ, tañce saṅgho osāreti – dosārito. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, puggalo appatto osāraṇaṃ, tañce saṅgho osāreti – dosārito. Ime vuccanti, bhikkhave, puggalā appattā osāraṇaṃ, te ce saṅgho osāreti – dosāritā.

396.Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of admission. There is, bhikkhus, a person not eligible for admission. If the Saṅgha admits such a person, one is properly admitted, the other is improperly admitted. And who, bhikkhus, is the person not eligible for admission, whom if the Saṅgha admits—he is improperly admitted? A eunuch, bhikkhus, is not eligible for admission. If the Saṅgha admits him—he is improperly admitted. One who lives in association by theft, bhikkhus, is not eligible for admission. If the Saṅgha admits him—he is improperly admitted. One who has gone over to another sect, bhikkhus… an animal, bhikkhus… a matricide, bhikkhus… a patricide, bhikkhus… a killer of an arahant, bhikkhus… a violator of a bhikkhuni, bhikkhus… a schism-maker in the Saṅgha, bhikkhus… one who sheds the Buddha’s blood, bhikkhus… a hermaphrodite, bhikkhus, is not eligible for admission. If the Saṅgha admits him—he is improperly admitted. This, bhikkhus, is called the person not eligible for admission, whom if the Saṅgha admits—he is improperly admitted. These, bhikkhus, are called persons not eligible for admission, whom if the Saṅgha admits—they are improperly admitted.

Katamo ca, bhikkhave, puggalo appatto osāraṇaṃ, tañce saṅgho osāreti – sosārito? Hatthacchinno, bhikkhave, appatto osāraṇaṃ, tañce saṅgho osāreti, sosārito. Pādacchinno, bhikkhave…pe… hatthapādacchinno, bhikkhave… kaṇṇacchinno, bhikkhave… nāsacchinno, bhikkhave… kaṇṇanāsacchinno, bhikkhave… aṅgulicchinno, bhikkhave… aḷacchinno, bhikkhave… kaṇḍaracchinno, bhikkhave… phaṇahatthako, bhikkhave… khujjo, bhikkhave… vāmano, bhikkhave… galagaṇḍī, bhikkhave… lakkhaṇāhato, bhikkhave… kasāhato, bhikkhave… likhitako, bhikkhave… sīpadiko, bhikkhave… pāparogī, bhikkhave… parisadūsako, bhikkhave… kāṇo, bhikkhave… kuṇī, bhikkhave… khañjo, bhikkhave… pakkhahato, bhikkhave… chinniriyāpatho, bhikkhave… jarādubbalo, bhikkhave… andho, bhikkhave… mūgo, bhikkhave… badhiro, bhikkhave… andhamūgo, bhikkhave… andhabadhiro, bhikkhave… mūgabadhiro, bhikkhave… andhamūgabadhiro, bhikkhave, appatto osāraṇaṃ, tañce saṅgho osāreti – sosārito.

And who, bhikkhus, is the person not eligible for admission, whom if the Saṅgha admits—he is properly admitted? One whose hand is cut off, bhikkhus, is not eligible for admission. If the Saṅgha admits him—he is properly admitted. One whose foot is cut off, bhikkhus… one whose hand and foot are cut off, bhikkhus… one whose ear is cut off, bhikkhus… one whose nose is cut off, bhikkhus… one whose ear and nose are cut off, bhikkhus… one whose fingers are cut off, bhikkhus… one whose thumb is cut off, bhikkhus… one whose tendon is cut off, bhikkhus… one who has a webbed hand, bhikkhus… one who is hunchbacked, bhikkhus… one who is dwarfed, bhikkhus… one who has a goiter, bhikkhus… one who is marked by branding, bhikkhus… one who is marked by whipping, bhikkhus… one who is marked by tattooing, bhikkhus… one who has elephantiasis, bhikkhus… one who has a foul disease, bhikkhus… one who corrupts assemblies, bhikkhus… one who is one-eyed, bhikkhus… one who is crippled, bhikkhus… one who is lame, bhikkhus… one who is paralyzed, bhikkhus… one whose deportment is impaired, bhikkhus… one who is weak with age, bhikkhus… one who is blind, bhikkhus… one who is mute, bhikkhus… one who is deaf, bhikkhus… one who is blind and mute, bhikkhus… one who is blind and deaf, bhikkhus… one who is mute and deaf, bhikkhus… one who is blind, mute, and deaf, bhikkhus, is not eligible for admission.

These, bhikkhus, are called persons not eligible for admission, whom if the Saṅgha admits—they are properly admitted.

241.The Questions of Upāli

400. Atha kho āyasmā upāli yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā upāli bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘yo nu kho, bhante, samaggo saṅgho sammukhākaraṇīyaṃ kammaṃ asammukhā karoti, dhammakammaṃ nu kho taṃ, bhante, vinayakamma’’nti? ‘‘Adhammakammaṃ taṃ, upāli, avinayakamma’’nti. ‘‘Yo nu kho, bhante, samaggo saṅgho paṭipucchākaraṇīyaṃ kammaṃ appaṭipucchā karoti…pe… paṭiññāyakaraṇīyaṃ kammaṃ apaṭiññāya karoti… sativinayārahassa amūḷhavinayaṃ deti… amūḷhavinayārahassa tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ karoti… tassapāpiyasikākammārahassa tajjanīyakammaṃ karoti… tajjanīyakammārahassa niyassakammaṃ karoti … niyassakammārahassa pabbājanīyakammaṃ karoti… pabbājanīyakammārahassa paṭisāraṇīyakammaṃ karoti… paṭisāraṇīyakammārahassa ukkhepanīyakammaṃ karoti… ukkhepanīyakammārahassa parivāsaṃ deti… parivāsārahaṃ mūlāya paṭikassati… mūlāyapaṭikassanārahassa mānattaṃ deti… mānattārahaṃ abbheti… abbhānārahaṃ upasampādeti, dhammakammaṃ nu kho taṃ, bhante, vinayakamma’’nti? ‘‘Adhammakammaṃ taṃ, upāli, avinayakammaṃ’’.

400.Then Venerable Upāli approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, Venerable Upāli said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, if a harmonious Saṅgha performs a procedure that requires presence, but does so without presence, is that a Dhamma procedure, Venerable sir, a Vinaya procedure?" "That is an unlawful procedure, Upāli, an undisciplinary procedure."

401. ‘‘Yo nu kho, bhante, samaggo saṅgho sammukhākaraṇīyaṃ kammaṃ sammukhā karoti, dhammakammaṃ nu kho taṃ, bhante, vinayakamma’’nti? ‘‘Dhammakammaṃ taṃ, upāli, vinayakamma’’nti. ‘‘Yo nu kho, bhante, samaggo saṅgho paṭipucchākaraṇīyaṃ kammaṃ paṭipucchā karoti…pe… paṭiññāyakaraṇīyaṃ kammaṃ paṭiññāya karoti… sativinayārahassa sativinayaṃ deti… amūḷhavinayārahassa amūḷhavinayaṃ deti… tassapāpiyasikākammārahassa tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ karoti… tajjanīyakammārahassa tajjanīyakammaṃ karoti… niyassakammārahassa niyassakammaṃ karoti… pabbājanīyakammārahassa pabbājanīyakammaṃ karoti… paṭisāraṇīyakammārahassa paṭisāraṇīyakammaṃ karoti… ukkhepanīyakammārahassa ukkhepanīyakammaṃ karoti… parivāsārahassa parivāsaṃ deti mūlāyapaṭikassanārahaṃ mūlāya paṭikassati… mānattārahassa mānattaṃ deti… abbhānārahaṃ abbheti… upasampadārahaṃ upasampādeti, dhammakammaṃ nu kho taṃ, bhante, vinayakamma’’nti? ‘‘Dhammakammaṃ taṃ, upāli, vinayakammaṃ.

401."Venerable sir, if a harmonious Saṅgha performs a procedure that requires presence, and does so with presence, is that a Dhamma procedure, Venerable sir, a Vinaya procedure?" "That, Upāli, is a Dhamma procedure and a Vinaya procedure."

427.Here, monks, a monk who has been subjected by the Saṅgha to an act of suspension for non-expiation of an offense behaves properly, humbles himself, behaves so as to be rehabilitated, and requests the rescinding of the act of suspension for non-expiation. If the monks think: “This monk, friends, who has been subjected by the Saṅgha to an act of suspension for non-expiation of an offense, behaves properly, humbles himself, behaves so as to be rehabilitated, and requests the rescinding of the act of suspension for non-expiation. Let us rescind the act of suspension for non-expiation for him.” They rescind the act of suspension for non-expiation for him—unlawfully, by a faction. He goes from that dwelling to another dwelling. There too the monks think: “This monk, friends, has had the act of suspension for non-expiation rescinded by the Saṅgha—unlawfully, by a faction. Let us rescind the act of suspension for non-expiation for him.” They rescind the act of suspension for non-expiation for him—unlawfully, by a complete assembly… lawfully, by a faction… by a semblance of the Dhamma, by a faction… by a semblance of the Dhamma, by a complete assembly…

He then goes from that residence to another residence. There too, the monks think: ‘This monk, friends, has had the act of suspension for non-relinquishment of a wrong view revoked by the Sangha—unlawfully, by a faction. Let us revoke the act of suspension for non-relinquishment of a wrong view for him.’ They revoke the act of suspension for non-relinquishment of a wrong view for him—unlawfully, in concord… lawfully, as a faction… by what resembles the Dhamma, as a faction… by what resembles the Dhamma, in concord….

438. Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu āpattiṃ āpajjitvā na icchati āpattiṃ paṭikātuṃ. Tatra ce bhikkhūnaṃ evaṃ hoti – ‘‘ayaṃ kho, āvuso, bhikkhu āpattiṃ āpajjitvā na icchati āpattiṃ paṭikātuṃ. Handassa mayaṃ āpattiyā appaṭikamme ukkhepanīyakammaṃ karomā’’ti. Te tassa āpattiyā appaṭikamme ukkhepanīyakammaṃ karonti – adhammena vaggā…pe… adhammena samaggā… dhammena vaggā… dhammapatirūpakena vaggā… dhammapatirūpakena samaggā. Tatraṭṭho saṅgho vivadati – ‘‘adhammena vaggakammaṃ, adhammena samaggakammaṃ, dhammena vaggakammaṃ, dhammapatirūpakena vaggakammaṃ, dhammapatirūpakena samaggakammaṃ, akataṃ kammaṃ dukkaṭaṃ kammaṃ puna kātabbaṃ kamma’’nti.

Ime pañca vārā saṃkhittā.

438.Here, monks, a monk commits an offense and does not wish to make amends for it. If the monks think: “This monk, friends, has committed an offense and does not wish to make amends for it. Let us perform the act of suspension for not making amends against him.” They perform the act of suspension for not making amends against him—unlawfully by a faction, unlawfully by a united group, in accordance with the Dhamma by a faction, in accordance with the Dhamma by a united group, by a faction in the semblance of the Dhamma, by a united group in the semblance of the Dhamma. The Sangha present disputes: “It is an act done unlawfully by a faction, unlawfully by a united group, in accordance with the Dhamma by a faction, by a faction in the semblance of the Dhamma, by a united group in the semblance of the Dhamma, an undone act, a wrongly done act, an act to be done again.” Here, monks, those monks who say, “It is an act done by a united group in the semblance of the Dhamma,” and those who say, “It is an undone act, a wrongly done act, an act to be done again,” these monks there are speakers of the Dhamma. These are the five instances in brief.

If the bhikkhus think: “This bhikkhu, friends, who has been subjected by the Sangha to a suspension for not acknowledging an offense, behaves properly, shows humility, makes amends, and requests the lifting of the suspension for not acknowledging the offense, let us lift for him the suspension for not acknowledging the offense.” They lift for him the suspension for not acknowledging the offense—unlawfully by a faction… unlawfully by a united body… lawfully by a faction… by what appears as the Dhamma by a faction… by what appears as the Dhamma by a united body. The Sangha present there disputes, saying: “The act was unlawfully by a faction; the act was unlawfully by a united body; the act was lawfully by a faction; the act was by what appears as the Dhamma by a faction; the act was by what appears as the Dhamma by a united body; the act was not done; the act was wrongly done; the act should be done again.” Here, bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who say, “The act was by what appears as the Dhamma by a united body,” and those bhikkhus who say, “The act was not done; the act was wrongly done; the act should be done again,” these bhikkhus there are speakers of the Dhamma. These five cases are stated in brief.

If it occurs to the monks: “Friends, this monk who has been subjected by the Saṅgha to an act of suspension for not relinquishing a wrong view conducts himself properly, shaves his hair, and behaves in a way that leads to restoration, and he requests the revocation of the act of suspension for not relinquishing a wrong view.

270.The Summary of It.

Campāyaṃ bhagavā āsi, vatthu vāsabhagāmake;Āgantukānamussukkaṃ, akāsi icchitabbake [icchitabbako (ka.)].

At Campā the Blessed One was, dwelling in Vāsabhagāmaka; He created enthusiasm for the newcomers, desiring what was to be desired.

Pakataññunoti ñatvā, ussukkaṃ na karī tadā;Ukkhitto na karotīti, sāgamā jinasantike.

Knowing him to be one who knows what has been done, he did not exert himself then; Thinking, 'One suspended does not act,' he went to the Victor's presence.

Adhammena vaggakammaṃ, samaggaṃ adhammena ca;Dhammena vaggakammañca, patirūpakena vaggikaṃ.

An act by a faction unlawfully, and unity unlawfully; And an act by a faction lawfully, and a factional act seemingly lawful.

Patirūpakena samaggaṃ, eko ukkhipatekakaṃ;Eko ca dve sambahule, saṅghaṃ ukkhipatekako.

Unity seemingly lawful; one suspends one; one, and two, and many; one suspends the Saṅgha.

Duvepi sambahulāpi, saṅgho saṅghañca ukkhipi;Sabbaññupavaro sutvā, adhammanti paṭikkhipi.

Even two, and even many, the Saṅgha suspended the Saṅgha; The supreme All-Knowing One, having heard, rejected it as unlawful.

Ñattivipannaṃ yaṃ kammaṃ, sampannaṃ anusāvanaṃ;Anussāvanavipannaṃ, sampannaṃ ñattiyā ca yaṃ.

The act that is defective in the motion, that which is perfected in the announcement; That which is defective in the announcement, and that which is perfected in the motion.

Ubhayena vipannañca, aññatra dhammameva ca;Vinayā satthu paṭikuṭṭhaṃ, kuppaṃ aṭṭhānārahikaṃ.

And defective in both, and apart from the Dhamma itself; Rejected by the Teacher from the Vinaya, provocative, unworthy of a place.

Adhammavaggaṃ samaggaṃ, dhamma patirūpāni ye duve;Dhammeneva ca sāmaggiṃ, anuññāsi tathāgato.

The unlawful factional act, the unlawful unity, and those two seemingly lawful; And unity by Dhamma alone, the Tathāgata permitted.

Catuvaggo pañcavaggo, dasavaggo ca vīsati;Parovīsativaggo ca [atirekavīsativaggo (syā.)], saṅgho pañcavidho tathā.

A group of four, a group of five, and a group of ten, and twenty; And a group of more than twenty, thus the Saṅgha is of five kinds.

Ṭhapetvā upasampadaṃ, yañca kammaṃ pavāraṇaṃ;Abbhānakammena saha, catuvaggehi kammiko.

Except for higher ordination, and the act of pavāraṇā; Together with the act of restoration, a group of four is competent.

Duve kamme ṭhapetvāna, majjhadesūpasampadaṃ;Abbhānaṃ pañcavaggiko, sabbakammesu kammiko.

Except for two acts, higher ordination in the Middle Country; Restoration requires a group of five, competent for all acts.

Abbhānekaṃ ṭhapetvāna, ye bhikkhū dasavaggikā;Sabbakammakaro saṅgho, vīso sabbattha kammiko.

Except for one restoration, those monks who are a group of ten; The Saṅgha performs all acts, twenty are competent in all matters.

Bhikkhunī sikkhamānā, ca sāmaṇero sāmaṇerī;Paccakkhātantimavatthū, ukkhittāpattidassane.

A bhikkhunī, a female trainee, and a novice monk, a novice nun; One who has renounced the final basis, one suspended for not seeing an offense.

Appaṭikamme diṭṭhiyā, paṇḍako theyyasaṃvāsakaṃ;Titthiyā tiracchānagataṃ, mātu pitu ca ghātakaṃ.

One with the view of not making amends, a eunuch, one who has lived with thieves; A sectarian, an animal, and a mother-killer, a father-killer.

Arahaṃ bhikkhunīdūsi, bhedakaṃ lohituppādaṃ;Byañjanaṃ nānāsaṃvāsaṃ, nānāsīmāya iddhiyā.

An arahant-defiler of bhikkhunīs, a schismatic, one who has shed blood; One of ambiguous sex, one of different communion, one who has entered a different boundary by psychic power.

Yassa saṅgho kare kammaṃ, hontete catuvīsati;Sambuddhena paṭikkhittā, na hete gaṇapūrakā.

Those for whom the Saṅgha performs an act—these are twenty-four; Rejected by the Fully Awakened One, they are not quorum-completers.

Pārivāsikacatuttho, parivāsaṃ dadeyya vā;Mūlā mānattamabbheyya, akammaṃ na ca karaṇaṃ.

A pārivāsika, a fourth, or one who might grant probation; One who has undergone mānatta from the root (offense), and one who does not perform an act.

Mūlā arahamānattā, abbhānārahameva ca;Na kammakārakā pañca, sambuddhena pakāsitā.

One who is not worthy of mānatta from the root (offense), and one who is not worthy of restoration; These five are not act-performers, declared by the Fully Awakened One.

Bhikkhunī sikkhamānā ca, sāmaṇero sāmaṇerikā;Paccakkhantimaummattā, khittāvedanadassane.

A bhikkhunī, and a female trainee, a novice monk, a novice nun; One who has renounced the final (basis), one who is insane, one who is suspended for not seeing an offense.

Appaṭikamme diṭṭhiyā, paṇḍakāpi ca byañjanā [ito paraṃ syāmamūle diyaḍḍhagāthāhi abhabbapuggalā samattaṃ dassitā];Nānāsaṃvāsakā sīmā, vehāsaṃ yassa kamma ca.

One with the view of not making amends, and eunuchs, and those of ambiguous sex; Those of different communion, a boundary, and one whose act is in the air.

Aṭṭhārasannametesaṃ, paṭikkosaṃ na ruhati;Bhikkhussa pakatattassa, ruhati paṭikkosanā.

For these eighteen, reproach does not grow; For a monk who is in a normal state, reproach does grow.

Suddhassa dunnisārito, bālo hi sunissārito;Paṇḍako theyyasaṃvāso, pakkanto tiracchānagato.

For the pure one, it is hard to expel; indeed, for the fool, it is easy to expel; A eunuch, one who has lived with thieves, one who has gone forth, one who has gone to the animal realm.

Mātu pitu arahanta, dūsako saṅghabhedako;Lohituppādako ceva, ubhatobyañjano ca yo.

A mother-killer, a father-killer, an arahant-defiler, a schismatic; And one who has shed blood (of a Buddha), and one who is of double sex.

Ekādasannaṃ etesaṃ, osāraṇaṃ na yujjati;Hatthapādaṃ tadubhayaṃ, kaṇṇanāsaṃ tadūbhayaṃ.

For these eleven, restoration is not fitting; Hands, feet, and both of those; ears, nose, and both of those.

Aṅguli aḷakaṇḍaraṃ, phaṇaṃ khujjo ca vāmano;Gaṇḍī lakkhaṇakasā, ca likhitako ca sīpadī.

Finger, goitre, swelling, hunchback, and dwarf; One with a boil, one with marks, and one who is tattooed, and one with elephantiasis.

Pāpā parisakāṇo ca, kuṇī khañjo hatopi ca;Iriyāpathadubbalo, andho mūgo ca badhiro.

Evil, one-eyed, crippled (in arm), lame, and maimed; Weak in deportment, blind, and mute, and deaf.

Andhamūgandhabadhiro mūgabadhirameva ca;Andhamūgabadhiro ca, dvattiṃsete anūnakā.

The blind, the mute, and the deaf; And indeed the mute and the deaf; And the blind, the mute, and the deaf—these thirty-two are not deficient.

Tesaṃ osāraṇaṃ hoti, sambuddhena pakāsitaṃ;Daṭṭhabbā paṭikātabbā, nissajjetā na vijjati.

For them, restoration occurs, declared by the Fully Awakened One; They should be seen, they should be counteracted, there is no relinquishing.

Tassa ukkhepanā kammā, satta honti adhammikā;Āpannaṃ anuvattantaṃ, satta tepi adhammikā.

His acts of suspension are seven unlawful; Following one who has fallen into an offense, those seven also are unlawful.

Āpannaṃ nānuvattantaṃ, satta kammā sudhammikā;Sammukhā paṭipucchā ca, paṭiññāya ca kāraṇā.

Not following one who has fallen into an offense, seven acts are lawful; And face-to-face questioning, and reason for acknowledgement.

Sati amūḷhapāpikā, tajjanīniyassena ca;Pabbājanīya paṭisāro, ukkhepaparivāsa ca.

Mindfulness, non-delusion, and evil; And censure, and dependence; Expulsion, reconciliation, and suspension, probation.

Mūlā mānattaabbhānā, tatheva upasampadā;Aññaṃ kareyya aññassa, soḷasete adhammikā.

From the root, mānatta, restoration, and likewise higher ordination; If one performs for another, these sixteen are unlawful.

Taṃ taṃ kareyya taṃ tassa, soḷasete sudhammikā;Paccāropeyya aññaññaṃ, soḷasete adhammikā.

If one performs that for that one, those sixteen are lawful; If one imputes to another, these sixteen are unlawful.

Dve dve tammūlakaṃ tassa [dve dve mūlā katā kassa (syā.), dodotamūlakantassa (ka.)], tepi soḷasa dhammikā;Ekekamūlakaṃ cakkaṃ, ‘‘adhamma’’nti jinobravi.

Two by two, rooted in that, for that one, those sixteen also are lawful; A wheel rooted in each one, the Conqueror declared it 'unlawful'.

Akāsi tajjanīyaṃ kammaṃ, saṅgho bhaṇḍanakārako;Adhammena vaggakammaṃ, aññaṃ āvāsaṃ gacchi so.

The Saṅgha, being quarrelsome, performed an act of censure; With an unlawful factional act, he went to another residence.

Tatthādhammena samaggā, tassa tajjanīyaṃ karuṃ;Aññattha vaggādhammena, tassa tajjanīyaṃ karuṃ.

There, united unlawfully, they performed an act of censure against him; Elsewhere, by an unlawful faction, they performed an act of censure against him.

Patirūpena vaggāpi, samaggāpi tathā karuṃ;Adhammena samaggā ca, dhammena vaggameva ca.

Even by a seemingly lawful faction, even united, they acted thus; And united unlawfully, and indeed by a lawful faction.

Patirūpakena vaggā ca, samaggā ca ime padā;Ekekamūlakaṃ katvā, cakkaṃ bandhe vicakkhaṇo.

And by a seemingly lawful faction, and united, these words; Having made each a single root, the discerning one should bind the wheel.

Bālā byattassa niyassaṃ, pabbāje kuladūsakaṃ;Paṭisāraṇīyaṃ kammaṃ, kare akkosakassa ca.

Fools, dependence on the competent; Expel a family-corrupter; One should perform an act of reconciliation and for one who abuses.

Adassanāppaṭikamme, yo ca diṭṭhiṃ na nissajje;Tesaṃ ukkhepanīyakammaṃ, satthavāhena bhāsitaṃ.

For not seeing, for not making amends, and for one who does not relinquish the view; For them, the act of suspension was spoken by the Teacher.

Upari nayakammānaṃ [upavinayakammānaṃ (syā.), ukkhepanīyakammānaṃ (ka.)] pañño tajjanīyaṃ naye;Tesaṃyeva anulomaṃ, sammā vattati yācite [yācati (syā.), yācito (sī.)].

Above the acts of leading, the wise one should lead to censure; In accordance with those very ones, he behaves properly when requested.

Passaddhi tesaṃ kammānaṃ, heṭṭhā kammanayena ca;Tasmiṃ tasmiṃ tu kammesu, tatraṭṭho ca vivadati.

The calming of those acts, and by the method of lower acts; And in each and every act, one standing there disputes.

Akataṃ dukkaṭañceva, punakātabbakanti ca;Kamme passaddhiyā cāpi, te bhikkhū dhammavādino.

Not done, and wrongly done, and what should be done again; And also regarding the calming of the act, those monks are speakers of Dhamma.

Vipattibyādhite disvā, kammappatte mahāmuni;Paṭippassaddhimakkhāsi, sallakattova osadhanti.

Seeing those afflicted by misfortune and illness, the Great Sage, having reached the proper formal act, proclaimed revocation, like a surgeon applying medicine.
