107.Authorization for Undertaking the Rains Residence

184. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā rājagahe viharati veḷuvane kalandakanivāpe. Tena kho pana samayena bhagavatā bhikkhūnaṃ vassāvāso apaññatto hoti. Teidha bhikkhū hemantampi gimhampi vassampi cārikaṃ caranti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma samaṇā sakyaputtiyā hemantampi gimhampi vassampi cārikaṃ carissanti, haritāni tiṇāni sammaddantā, ekindriyaṃ jīvaṃ viheṭhentā, bahū khuddake pāṇe saṅghātaṃ āpādentā. Ime hi nāma aññatitthiyā durakkhātadhammā vassāvāsaṃ allīyissanti saṅkasāyissanti. Ime hi nāma sakuntakā rukkhaggesu kulāvakāni karitvā vassāvāsaṃ allīyissanti saṅkasāyissanti [saṅkāsayissanti (sī. syā.)]. Ime pana samaṇā sakyaputtiyā hemantampi gimhampi vassampi cārikaṃ caranti, haritāni tiṇāni sammaddantā, ekindriyaṃ jīvaṃ viheṭhentā, bahū khuddake pāṇe saṅghātaṃ āpādentā’’ti. Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū tesaṃ manussānaṃ ujjhāyantānaṃ khiyyantānaṃ vipācentānaṃ. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, vassaṃ upagantu’’nti. Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kadā nu kho vassaṃ upagantabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, vassāne vassaṃ upagantunti.

184.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. At that time the Blessed One had not authorized the rains residence for the bhikkhus. Then those bhikkhus wandered on tour during the winter, the summer, and the rainy season. People complained, criticized, and grumbled: “How can these Sakyan ascetics wander on tour during the winter, the summer, and the rainy season, crushing green grass, harming one-facultied living beings, and destroying many small creatures? Other ascetics of different sects, though their teachings are poorly proclaimed, still settle down and remain during the rainy season. Even birds, after making nests on the treetops, settle down and remain during the rainy season. But these Sakyan ascetics wander on tour during the winter, the summer, and the rainy season, crushing green grass, harming one-facultied living beings, and destroying many small creatures!” The bhikkhus heard the complaints, criticism, and grumbling of those people. Then those bhikkhus reported the matter to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the bhikkhus: “I allow, bhikkhus, to undertake the rains residence.” Then the bhikkhus thought: “When should the rains residence be undertaken?” They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, bhikkhus, to undertake the rains residence during the rains.”

Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kati nu kho vassūpanāyikā’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ

Then the bhikkhus had this thought: “How many rains residences are there?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One.

Ārocesuṃ. Dvemā, bhikkhave, vassūpanāyikā – purimikā, pacchimikā. Aparajjugatāya āsāḷhiyā purimikā upagantabbā, māsagatāya āsāḷhiyā pacchimikā upagantabbā – imā kho, bhikkhave, dve vassūpanāyikāti.

They reported. “There are, bhikkhus, these two rains residences: the earlier and the later. The earlier should be undertaken on the day after the Āsāḷhī [full moon], and the later should be undertaken when a month has passed since the Āsāḷhī [full moon]. These, bhikkhus, are the two rains residences.”

Vassūpanāyikānujānanā niṭṭhitā.

The Authorization for Undertaking the Rains Residence is concluded.

108.The Prohibition of Wandering During the Rains, and So On

185. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū vassaṃ upagantvā antarāvassaṃ cārikaṃ caranti. Manussā tatheva ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma samaṇā sakyaputtiyā hemantampi gimhampi vassampi cārikaṃ carissanti, haritāni tiṇāni sammaddantā, ekindriyaṃ jīvaṃ viheṭhentā, bahū khuddake pāṇe saṅghātaṃ āpādentā. Ime hi nāma aññatitthiyā durakkhātadhammā vassāvāsaṃ allīyissanti saṅkasāyissanti. Ime hi nāma sakuntakā rukkhaggesu kulāvakāni karitvā vassāvāsaṃ allīyissanti saṅkasāyissanti. Ime pana samaṇā sakyaputtiyā hemantampi gimhampi vassampi cārikaṃ caranti, haritāni tiṇāni sammaddantā, ekindriyaṃ jīvaṃ viheṭhentā, bahū khuddake pāṇe saṅghātaṃ āpādentā’’ti. Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū tesaṃ manussānaṃ ujjhāyantānaṃ khiyyantānaṃ vipācentānaṃ. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma chabbaggiyā bhikkhū vassaṃ upagantvā antarāvassaṃ cārikaṃ carissantī’’ti? Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, vassaṃ upagantvā purimaṃ vā temāsaṃ pacchimaṃ vā temāsaṃ avasitvā cārikā pakkamitabbā. Yo pakkameyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

185.Now at that time the group of six bhikkhus, having entered the rains residence, went wandering during the rains. People complained, grumbled, and criticized: “How can these Sakyan ascetics wander during the winter, the summer, and the rains, trampling green grass, harming one-facultied living beings, and destroying many small creatures? Ascetics of other sects, even with their poorly proclaimed Dhamma, settle down and abide during the rains residence. Even birds, having made nests in the treetops, settle down and abide during the rains residence. But these Sakyan ascetics wander during the winter, the summer, and the rains, trampling green grass, harming one-facultied living beings, and destroying many small creatures.” The bhikkhus heard those people complaining, grumbling, and criticizing. Those bhikkhus who were modest… complained, grumbled, and criticized: “How can the group of six bhikkhus, having entered the rains residence, go wandering during the rains?” Then those bhikkhus reported the matter to the Blessed One. Then, on that occasion, in that connection, the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, having entered the rains residence, one should not depart wandering without having remained for either the first three months or the last three months. Whoever departs incurs an offense of wrong-doing.”

186. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū na icchanti vassaṃ upagantuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, vassaṃ na upagantabbaṃ. Yo na upagaccheyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

186.At that time, the group of six bhikkhus did not wish to enter the rains residence. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, one should not fail to enter the rains residence. Whoever does not enter incurs an offense of wrong-doing.”

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū tadahu vassūpanāyikāya vassaṃ anupagantukāmā sañcicca āvāsaṃ atikkamanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, tadahu vassūpanāyikāya vassaṃ anupagantukāmena sañcicca āvāso atikkamitabbo. Yo atikkameyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

At that time, the group of six bhikkhus, wishing not to enter the rains residence on the day of entering the rains residence, intentionally passed beyond the dwelling. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, one should not intentionally pass beyond the dwelling on the day of entering the rains residence, wishing not to enter the rains residence. Whoever does so incurs an offense of wrong-doing.”

Tena kho pana samayena rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro vassaṃ ukkaḍḍhitukāmo

At that time, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha wished to postpone the rains residence.

Bhikkhūnaṃ santike dūtaṃ pāhesi – yadi panāyyā āgame juṇhe vassaṃ upagaccheyyunti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, rājūnaṃ anuvattitunti.

He sent a messenger to the bhikkhus, [saying]: “If the venerables wish, let them enter the rains residence in the coming month of Juṇha.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, I allow compliance with kings.”

Vassāne cārikāpaṭikkhepādi niṭṭhitā.

The Prohibition of Wandering During the Rains, and So On, Concluded.

109.Permission for Seven-Day Business

187. Atha kho bhagavā rājagahe yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena sāvatthi tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena sāvatthi tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena kosalesu janapade udenena upāsakena saṅghaṃ uddissa vihāro kārāpito hoti. So bhikkhūnaṃ santike dūtaṃ pāhesi – ‘‘āgacchantu bhadantā, icchāmi dānañca dātuṃ, dhammañca sotuṃ, bhikkhū ca passitu’’nti. Bhikkhū evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘bhagavatā, āvuso, paññattaṃ ‘na vassaṃ upagantvā purimaṃ vā temāsaṃ pacchimaṃ vā temāsaṃ avasitvā cārikā pakkamitabbā’ti. Āgametu udeno upāsako, yāva bhikkhū vassaṃ vasanti. Vassaṃvuṭṭhā āgamissanti. Sace panassa accāyikaṃ karaṇīyaṃ, tattheva āvāsikānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ santike vihāraṃ patiṭṭhāpetū’’ti. Udeno upāsako ujjhāyati khiyyati vipāceti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma bhadantā mayā pahite na āgacchissanti. Ahañhi dāyako kārako saṅghupaṭṭhāko’’ti. Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū udenassa upāsakassa ujjhāyantassa khiyyantassa vipācentassa. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sattannaṃ sattāhakaraṇīyena pahite gantuṃ, na tveva appahite. Bhikkhussa, bhikkhuniyā, sikkhamānāya, sāmaṇerassa, sāmaṇeriyā, upāsakassa, upāsikāya – anujānāmi, bhikkhave, imesaṃ sattannaṃ sattāhakaraṇīyena pahite gantuṃ, na tveva appahite. Sattāhaṃ sannivatto kātabbo’’.

187.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Rājagaha as long as he pleased, set out on a journey to Sāvatthī. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sāvatthī. There the Blessed One stayed in Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. Now at that time, in the Kosalan country, the lay follower Udena had a monastery built for the Sangha. He sent a messenger to the bhikkhus: “Come, venerables, I wish to give a gift, to hear the Dhamma, and to see the bhikkhus.” The bhikkhus replied: “Friend, the Blessed One has laid down a rule: ‘Having entered the rains residence, one should not depart wandering without having remained for either the first three months or the last three months.’ Let the lay follower Udena wait until the bhikkhus have completed the rains residence. After the rains, they will come. But if he has urgent business, let him establish the monastery there in the presence of the resident bhikkhus.” The lay follower Udena complained, grumbled, and criticized: “How can the venerables not come when I have sent for them? I am a donor, a doer, a supporter of the Sangha.” The bhikkhus heard the lay follower Udena complaining, grumbling, and criticizing. Then those bhikkhus reported the matter to the Blessed One. Then, on that occasion, in that connection, the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, I allow you to go when sent for on a seven-day business by seven kinds of people, but not when not sent for. Namely: a bhikkhu, a bhikkhunī, a female probationer, a novice monk, a novice nun, a male lay follower, a female lay follower—Bhikkhus, I allow you to go when sent for on a seven-day business by these seven kinds of people, but not when not sent for. A return within seven days should be made.”

188. Idha pana, bhikkhave, upāsakena saṅghaṃ uddissa vihāro kārāpito hoti. So ce bhikkhūnaṃ santike dūtaṃ pahiṇeyya – ‘‘āgacchantu bhadantā, icchāmi dānañca dātuṃ, dhammañca sotuṃ, bhikkhū ca passitu’’nti, gantabbaṃ, bhikkhave, sattāhakaraṇīyena, pahite, na tveva appahite. Sattāhaṃ sannivatto kātabbo.

188.“Here, bhikkhus, a lay follower has had a monastery built for the Sangha. If he should send a messenger to the bhikkhus, saying: ‘Venerables, please come; I wish to give a gift, to hear the Dhamma, and to see the bhikkhus,’ then, bhikkhus, you should go for a seven-day business when sent for, but not when not sent for. A return within seven days should be made.”

So ce bhikkhūnaṃ santike dūtaṃ pahiṇeyya – ‘‘āgacchantu bhadantā, icchāmi dānañca dātuṃ, dhammañca sotuṃ, bhikkhū ca passitu’’nti, gantabbaṃ, bhikkhave, sattāhakaraṇīyena, pahite, na tveva appahite. Sattāhaṃ sannivatto kātabbo.

“Here, bhikkhus, a lay follower has had a half-gable dwelling built for the Sangha… a mansion built… a terraced house built… a cave built… an enclosure built… a storehouse built… a service hall built… a fire hall built… a suitable-items hut built… a toilet built… a promenade built… a promenade hall built… a well built… a well-house built… a hot-bath house built… a hot-bath house hall built… a lotus pond built… a pavilion built… a park built… a park site built. If he sends a messenger to the bhikkhus saying, “Venerables, please come; I wish to give a gift, to hear the Dhamma, and to see the bhikkhus,” then, bhikkhus, you should go for a seven-day business when sent for, but not when not sent for. A return within seven days should be made.”

A return within seven days should be made.”

Idha pana, bhikkhave, upāsakena bhikkhunisaṅghaṃ uddissa…pe… sambahulā bhikkhuniyo uddissa…pe… ekaṃ bhikkhuniṃ uddissa…pe… sambahulā sikkhamānāyo uddissa…pe… ekaṃ sikkhamānaṃ uddissa…pe… sambahule sāmaṇere uddissa…pe… ekaṃ sāmaṇeraṃ uddissa…pe… sambahulā sāmaṇeriyo uddissa…pe… ekaṃ sāmaṇeriṃ uddissa vihāro kārāpito hoti…pe… aḍḍhayogo kārāpito hoti… pāsādo kārāpito hoti… hammiyaṃ kārāpitaṃ hoti… guhā kārāpitā hoti… pariveṇaṃ kārāpitaṃ hoti… koṭṭhako kārāpito hoti… upaṭṭhānasālā kārāpitā hoti… aggisālā kārāpitā hoti … kappiyakuṭi kārāpitā hoti… caṅkamo kārāpito hoti… caṅkamanasālā kārāpitā hoti… udapāno kārāpito hoti… udapānasālā kārāpitā hoti… pokkharaṇī kārāpitā hoti… maṇḍapo kārāpito hoti… ārāmo kārāpito hoti… ārāmavatthu kārāpitaṃ hoti.

They will ordain you after the rains." Then, after the rains, those monks said to Visakha, Migara's mother's grandson, "Come now, friend, be ordained." He replied, "If I had been ordained then, venerable sirs, I would have been delighted. But now, venerable sirs, I will not be ordained." Visakha, Migara's mother, complained, criticized, and protested: "How can the venerable ones make such an agreement—'No ordination during the rains'? When should the Dhamma not be practiced?" The monks heard Visakha, Migara's mother, complaining, criticizing, and protesting. Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, such an agreement should not be made: 'No ordination during the rains.' Whoever makes it commits an offense of wrong-doing."

206.Now at that time, the Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had accepted a rains residence from King Pasenadi of Kosala for the earlier period. While on his way to that residence, he saw two monasteries along the way that had plenty of robes. He thought, "Why don’t I spend the rains in these two monasteries? That way, I’ll get a lot of robes." So he spent the rains in those two monasteries. King Pasenadi of Kosala complained, grumbled, and criticized him, saying, "How could the Venerable Upananda the Sakyan, having accepted a rains residence from us, break his word? Hasn’t the Buddha criticized lying in many ways and praised abstaining from false speech?" The monks heard King Pasenadi of Kosala complaining, grumbling, and criticizing. Those monks who were modest… complained, grumbled, and criticized him, saying, "How could the Venerable Upananda the Sakyan, having accepted King Pasenadi’s rains residence, break his word? Hasn’t the Buddha criticized lying in many ways and praised abstaining from false speech?" Then those monks reported the matter to the Buddha… The Buddha, on this occasion, because of this matter, convened the Sangha and questioned the Venerable Upananda the Sakyan: "Is it true, Upananda, that you accepted King Pasenadi’s rains residence and then broke your word?" "It’s true, Blessed One." The Buddha rebuked him… "Foolish man, how could you accept King Pasenadi’s rains residence and then break your word? Haven’t I, foolish man, criticized lying in many ways and praised abstaining from false speech? This will not inspire confidence in those without it…." After rebuking him… the Buddha gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks:

207.Here, monks, a monk has undertaken the rains residence for the earlier period. While on his way to that residence, he sees along the way two other dwellings with many robes. He thinks: ‘Suppose I were to spend the rains in these two dwellings? Then many robes will arise for me.’ So he spends the rains in those two dwellings. In this case, monks, that monk's earlier period is not reckoned, and there is an offense of wrong-doing for the undertaking.

Then, on that very day, he departs without a valid reason. Monks, for that monk, the earlier period is not reckoned, and there is an offense of wrong-doing for the undertaking.
