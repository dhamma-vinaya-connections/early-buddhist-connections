147.The Story of Soṇa Koḷivisa

242. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā rājagahe viharati gijjhakūṭe pabbate. Tena kho pana samayena rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro asītiyā gāmasahassesu issariyādhipaccaṃ rajjaṃ kāreti. Tena kho pana samayena campāyaṃ soṇo nāma koḷiviso [koḷivīso (sī.)] seṭṭhiputto sukhumālo hoti. Tassa pādatalesu lomāni jātāni honti. Atha kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro tāni asīti gāmikasahassāni sannipātāpetvā kenacideva karaṇīyena soṇassa koḷivisassa santike dūtaṃ pāhesi – āgacchatu soṇo, icchāmi soṇassa āgatanti. Atha kho soṇassa koḷivisassa mātāpitaro soṇaṃ koḷivisaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘rājā te, tāta soṇa, pāde dakkhitukāmo. Mā kho tvaṃ, tāta soṇa, yena rājā tena pāde abhippasāreyyāsi. Rañño purato pallaṅkena nisīda. Nisinnassa te rājā pāde dakkhissatī’’ti. Atha kho soṇaṃ koḷivisaṃ sivikāya ānesuṃ. Atha kho soṇo koḷiviso yena rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā rājānaṃ māgadhaṃ seniyaṃ bimbisāraṃ abhivādetvā rañño purato pallaṅkena nisīdi. Addasā kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro soṇassa koḷivisassa pādatalesu lomāni jātāni. Atha kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro tāni asīti gāmikasahassāni diṭṭhadhammike atthe anusāsitvā uyyojesi – ‘‘tumhe khvattha, bhaṇe, mayā diṭṭhadhammike atthe anusāsitā; gacchatha, taṃ bhagavantaṃ payirupāsatha; so no bhagavā samparāyike atthe anusāsissatī’’ti.

242.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on the Vulture Peak. Now at that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was ruling with sovereign power over eighty thousand villages. At that time, in Campā, there was a young man named Soṇa Koḷivisa, the son of a wealthy merchant, who was very delicate. Hair had grown on the soles of his feet. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, having assembled those eighty thousand village headmen for some business, sent a messenger to Soṇa Koḷivisa with the words: "Let Soṇa come; I wish to see Soṇa." Then Soṇa Koḷivisa’s parents said to him: "Dear Soṇa, the king wishes to see your feet. Do not, dear Soṇa, stretch out your feet toward the king. Sit cross-legged in front of the king. When you are seated, the king will see your feet." Then they brought Soṇa Koḷivisa in a palanquin. Soṇa Koḷivisa approached King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, paid homage to him, and sat cross-legged in front of the king. King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha saw the hair on the soles of Soṇa Koḷivisa’s feet. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, having instructed those eighty thousand village headmen in matters pertaining to visible benefits, dismissed them, saying: "You, sirs, have been instructed by me in matters pertaining to visible benefits; go now and attend upon the Blessed One; the Blessed One will instruct you in matters pertaining to the future life."

Atha kho tāni asīti gāmikasahassāni yena gijjhakūṭo pabbato tenupasaṅkamiṃsu. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā sāgato bhagavato upaṭṭhāko hoti. Atha kho tāni asīti gāmikasahassāni yenāyasmā sāgato tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ sāgataṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘imāni, bhante, asīti gāmikasahassāni idhūpasaṅkantāni bhagavantaṃ dassanāya; sādhu mayaṃ, bhante, labheyyāma bhagavantaṃ dassanāyā’’ti. ‘‘Tena hi tumhe āyasmanto muhuttaṃ idheva tāva hotha, yāvāhaṃ bhagavantaṃ paṭivedemī’’ti. Atha kho āyasmā sāgato tesaṃ asītiyā gāmikasahassānaṃ purato pekkhamānānaṃ pāṭikāya nimujjitvā bhagavato purato ummujjitvā bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘imāni, bhante, asīti gāmikasahassāni idhūpasaṅkantāni bhagavantaṃ dassanāya; yassa dāni, bhante, bhagavā kālaṃ maññatī’’ti. ‘‘Tena hi tvaṃ, sāgata, vihārapacchāyāyaṃ āsanaṃ paññapehī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti kho āyasmā sāgato bhagavato paṭissuṇitvā pīṭhaṃ gahetvā bhagavato purato nimujjitvā tesaṃ asītiyā gāmikasahassānaṃ purato pekkhamānānaṃ pāṭikāya ummujjitvā vihārapacchāyāyaṃ āsanaṃ paññapeti. Atha kho bhagavā vihārā nikkhamitvā vihārapacchāyāyaṃ paññatte āsane nisīdi. Atha kho tāni asīti gāmikasahassāni yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu. Atha kho tāni asīti gāmikasahassāni āyasmantaṃyeva sāgataṃ samannāharanti, no tathā bhagavantaṃ. Atha kho bhagavā tesaṃ asītiyā gāmikasahassānaṃ cetasā cetoparivitakkamaññāya āyasmantaṃ sāgataṃ āmantesi – ‘‘tena hi tvaṃ, sāgata, bhiyyosomattāya uttarimanussadhammaṃ iddhipāṭihāriyaṃ dassehī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti kho āyasmā sāgato bhagavato paṭissuṇitvā vehāsaṃ abbhuggantvā ākāse antalikkhe caṅkamatipi, tiṭṭhatipi, nisīdatipi, seyyampi kappeti, dhūmāyatipi [dhūpāyatipi (sī.), padhūpāyatipi (syā.)] pajjalatipi, antaradhāyatipi. Atha kho āyasmā sāgato ākāse antalikkhe anekavihitaṃ uttarimanussadhammaṃ iddhipāṭihāriyaṃ dassetvā bhagavato pādesu sirasā nipatitvā bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘satthā me, bhante, bhagavā; sāvakohamasmi. Satthā me, bhante, bhagavā; sāvakohamasmī’’ti. Atha kho tāni asīti gāmikasahassāni ‘‘acchariyaṃ vata bho! Abbhutaṃ vata bho! Sāvakopi nāma evaṃ mahiddhiko bhavissati, evaṃ mahānubhāvo, aho nūna satthā’’ti bhagavantaṃyeva samannāharanti, no tathā āyasmantaṃ sāgataṃ.

Then those eighty thousand village headmen approached Vulture Peak Mountain. Now at that time, Venerable Sāgata was the Blessed One’s attendant. Then those eighty thousand village headmen approached Venerable Sāgata and said: “Venerable sir, these eighty thousand village headmen have come here to see the Blessed One. It would be good, venerable sir, if we could obtain a sight of the Blessed One.” “Well then, venerable ones, wait here for a moment while I inform the Blessed One.” Then Venerable Sāgata, while those eighty thousand village headmen were watching, dived into the earth and emerged before the Blessed One, saying: “Venerable sir, these eighty thousand village headmen have come here to see the Blessed One. Now is the time, venerable sir, as the Blessed One deems fit.” “Well then, Sāgata, prepare a seat in the shade behind the monastery.” “Yes, venerable sir,” replied Venerable Sāgata to the Blessed One. Taking a stool, he dived into the earth before the Blessed One and emerged in front of those eighty thousand village headmen, who were watching, and prepared a seat in the shade behind the monastery. Then the Blessed One came out of the monastery and sat down on the prepared seat in the shade behind the monastery. Then those eighty thousand village headmen approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. But those eighty thousand village headmen paid attention only to Venerable Sāgata, not so much to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, knowing their thoughts with his mind, addressed Venerable Sāgata: “Well then, Sāgata, display an even greater superhuman power and miracle to them.” “Yes, venerable sir,” replied Venerable Sāgata to the Blessed One. Rising into the air, he walked, stood, sat, and lay down in the sky. He emitted smoke and flames, then vanished. Having displayed various superhuman powers and miracles in the sky, Venerable Sāgata bowed his head at the Blessed One’s feet and said: “Venerable sir, the Blessed One is my Teacher, and I am his disciple. Venerable sir, the Blessed One is my Teacher, and I am his disciple.” Then those eighty thousand village headmen thought: “It is wonderful, truly amazing! Even a disciple can possess such great psychic power and might—how much more so the Teacher!” And they paid attention only to the Blessed One, not so much to Venerable Sāgata.

Atha kho bhagavā tesaṃ asītiyā gāmikasahassānaṃ cetasā cetoparivitakkamaññāya anupubbiṃ kathaṃ kathesi, seyyathidaṃ – dānakathaṃ sīlakathaṃ saggakathaṃ, kāmānaṃ ādīnavaṃ okāraṃ saṃkilesaṃ, nekkhamme ānisaṃsaṃ pakāsesi. Yadā te bhagavā aññāsi kallacitte, muducitte, vinīvaraṇacitte, udaggacitte, pasannacitte, atha yā buddhānaṃ sāmukkaṃsikā dhammadesanā, taṃ pakāsesi – dukkhaṃ, samudayaṃ, nirodhaṃ, maggaṃ. Seyyathāpi nāma suddhaṃ vatthaṃ apagatakāḷakaṃ sammadeva rajanaṃ paṭiggaṇheyya, evamevaṃ tesaṃ asītiyā gāmikasahassānaṃ tasmiṃyeva āsane virajaṃ vītamalaṃ dhammacakkhuṃ udapādi – ‘‘yaṃkiñci samudayadhammaṃ, sabbaṃ taṃ nirodhadhamma’’nti. Te diṭṭhadhammā pattadhammā viditadhammā pariyogāḷhadhammā tiṇṇavicikicchā vigatakathaṃkathā vesārajjappattā aparappaccayā satthusāsane bhagavantaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘abhikkantaṃ, bhante, abhikkantaṃ, bhante. Seyyathāpi, bhante, nikkujjitaṃ vā ukkujjeyya, paṭicchannaṃ vā vivareyya, mūḷhassa vā maggaṃ ācikkheyya, andhakāre vā telapajjotaṃ dhāreyya – ‘‘cakkhumanto rūpāni dakkhantī’’ti, evamevaṃ bhagavatā anekapariyāyena dhammo pakāsito. Ete mayaṃ, bhante, bhagavantaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāma. Dhammañca, bhikkhusaṅghañca. Upāsake no bhagavā dhāretu ajjatagge pāṇupete saraṇaṃ gate’’ti.

Then the Blessed One, knowing with his mind the thoughts in the minds of those eighty thousand headmen, gave them a step-by-step discourse, that is, talk on generosity, talk on virtue, talk on heaven; he revealed the danger, the futility, and the defilement in sensual pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that their minds were receptive, pliant, free from hindrances, uplifted, and serene, then he revealed the teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth, free from stains, would perfectly absorb dye, even so, in those eighty thousand headmen, as they sat there, arose the dust-free, stainless vision of the Dhamma: “Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.” Having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, known the Dhamma, plunged into the Dhamma, having crossed over doubt, dispelled uncertainty, attained to confidence, independent of others in the Teacher's Dispensation, they said this to the Blessed One: "Excellent, O venerable one! Excellent, O venerable one! Just as if one were to set upright what was overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the dark, so that those with eyes might see, even so has the Dhamma been made clear by the Blessed One in many ways. We go for refuge to the Blessed One, and to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of monks. May the Blessed One accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge, from this day forth, as long as life lasts."

The Going Forth of Soṇa

243. Atha kho soṇassa koḷivisassa etadahosi ‘‘yathā yathā kho ahaṃ bhagavatā dhammaṃ desitaṃ ājānāmi, nayidaṃ sukaraṃ agāraṃ ajjhāvasatā ekantaparipuṇṇaṃ ekantaparisuddhaṃ saṅkhalikhitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ carituṃ; yaṃnūnāhaṃ kesamassuṃ ohāretvā kāsāyāni vatthāni acchādetvā agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajeyya’’nti.

Tassāyaṃ caṅkamo lohitena phuṭo, seyyathāpi gavāghātana’’nti.

243.Then the thought occurred to Soṇa Koḷivisa: “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, it is not easy for one living at home to lead the perfectly complete, perfectly pure holy life, pure as a polished conch shell. What if I shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?” Then, after those eighty thousand village heads had rejoiced in and approved of the Blessed One’s words, they rose from their seats, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed. Soon after those eighty thousand village heads had left, Soṇa Koḷivisa approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting there, Soṇa Koḷivisa said to the Blessed One: “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, it is not easy for one living at home to lead the perfectly complete, perfectly pure holy life, pure as a polished conch shell. I wish, venerable sir, to shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness. Let the Blessed One ordain me.” Soṇa Koḷivisa received the going forth in the presence of the Blessed One, and he received the higher ordination. Not long after his higher ordination, Venerable Soṇa was dwelling at Sītavana. While he was walking meditation with excessive energy, his feet split open. His walking path was covered with blood, just like a cattle slaughterhouse. Then, while Venerable Soṇa was alone in seclusion, this thought arose in his mind: “Among the Blessed One’s disciples who dwell with aroused energy, I am one. Yet my mind is not liberated from the taints by non-clinging. There is wealth in my family; it is possible to enjoy wealth and do meritorious deeds. What if I were to revert to the lower life, enjoy wealth, and do meritorious deeds?” Then the Blessed One, knowing with his mind the thought in Venerable Soṇa’s mind—just as a strong man might extend his bent arm or bend his extended arm—disappeared from Vulture Peak and reappeared in Sītavana. Then the Blessed One, while wandering for alms among the dwellings with a number of bhikkhus, approached Venerable Soṇa’s walking path. The Blessed One saw Venerable Soṇa’s walking path covered with blood, and seeing it, he addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, whose walking path is this, covered with blood, just like a cattle slaughterhouse?” “Venerable sir, Venerable Soṇa, while walking meditation with excessive energy, split his feet. That is why his walking path is covered with blood, just like a cattle slaughterhouse.”

Atha kho bhagavā yenāyasmato soṇassa vihāro tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi. Āyasmāpi kho soṇo bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho āyasmantaṃ soṇaṃ bhagavā etadavoca – ‘‘nanu te, soṇa, rahogatassa paṭisallīnassa evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – ‘ye kho keci bhagavato sāvakā āraddhavīriyā viharanti, ahaṃ tesaṃ aññataro.

Atha kho bhagavā āyasmantaṃ soṇaṃ iminā ovādena ovaditvā – seyyathāpi nāma balavā puriso sammiñjitaṃ vā bāhaṃ pasāreyya, pasāritaṃ vā bāhaṃ samiñjeyya evameva – sītavane āyasmato soṇassa sammukhe antarahito gijjhakūṭe pabbate pāturahosi. Atha kho āyasmā soṇo aparena samayena vīriyasamataṃ adhiṭṭhāsi, indriyānañca samataṃ paṭivijjhi, tattha ca nimittaṃ aggahesi.

Aññataro ca panāyasmā soṇo arahataṃ ahosi.

Then the Blessed One went to Venerable Soṇa’s dwelling. Having approached, he sat down on the prepared seat. Venerable Soṇa also paid homage to the Blessed One and sat to one side. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One said to Venerable Soṇa: “Now, Soṇa, while you were alone in seclusion, didn’t this thought occur to you: ‘Among the Blessed One’s disciples who dwell with aroused energy, I am one. Yet my mind is not freed from the taints through non-clinging. There is wealth in my family; it is possible to enjoy wealth and do meritorious deeds. What if I were to revert to the lower life, enjoy wealth, and do meritorious deeds’?” “Yes, venerable sir.” “What do you think, Soṇa? Were you skilled in playing the lute when you were a householder?” “Yes, venerable sir.” “What do you think, Soṇa? When the strings of your lute were too taut, was your lute in tune and playable at that time?” “No, venerable sir.” “What do you think, Soṇa? When the strings of your lute were too slack, was your lute in tune and playable at that time?” “No, venerable sir.” “What do you think, Soṇa? When the strings of your lute were neither too taut nor too slack but established in even proportion, was your lute in tune and playable at that time?” “Yes, venerable sir.” “In the same way, Soṇa, over-aroused energy leads to agitation, and overly slack energy leads to laziness. Therefore, Soṇa, resolve upon a balance of energy, penetrate the evenness of the faculties, and take up the sign there.” “Yes, venerable sir,” Venerable Soṇa replied to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, having given this advice to Venerable Soṇa, vanished from Venerable Soṇa’s presence in Sītavana—just as a strong man might extend his bent arm or bend his extended arm—and reappeared on Vulture Peak. Then, after some time, Venerable Soṇa resolved upon a balance of energy, penetrated the evenness of the faculties, and took up the sign there. Then, dwelling alone, secluded, diligent, ardent, and resolute, before long he realized for himself, with direct knowledge, the unsurpassed culmination of the holy life, for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness. He directly knew: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’ And Venerable Soṇa became one of the Arahants.

244. Atha kho āyasmato soṇassa arahattappattassa etadahosi – ‘‘yaṃnūnāhaṃ bhagavato santike aññaṃ byākareyya’’nti. Atha kho āyasmā soṇo yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā soṇo bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – yo so, bhante, bhikkhu arahaṃ khīṇāsavo vusitavā katakaraṇīyo ohitabhāro anuppattasadattho parikkhīṇabhavasaññojano sammadaññā vimutto, so chaṭṭhānāni adhimutto hoti – nekkhammādhimutto hoti, pavivekādhimutto hoti, abyāpajjādhimutto hoti, upādānakkhayādhimutto hoti, taṇhakkhayādhimutto hoti, asammohādhimutto hoti.

244.Then it occurred to Venerable Soṇa, who had attained Arahantship: “What if I were to declare my final knowledge in the presence of the Blessed One?” Then Venerable Soṇa approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, Venerable Soṇa said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, that bhikkhu who is an Arahant, one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, attained his own true goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, and is liberated by right knowledge, is resolved upon six things: He is resolved upon renunciation, resolved upon seclusion, resolved upon non-ill will, resolved upon the destruction of clinging, resolved upon the destruction of craving, and resolved upon non-delusion.”

‘‘Siyā kho pana, bhante, idhekaccassa āyasmato evamassa – ‘kevalaṃ saddhāmattakaṃ nūna ayamāyasmā nissāya nekkhammādhimutto’ti, na kho panetaṃ, bhante, evaṃ daṭṭhabbaṃ. Khīṇāsavo, bhante, bhikkhu, vusitavā, katakaraṇīyo, karaṇīyamattānaṃ asamanupassanto katassa vā paṭicayaṃ khayā rāgassa vītarāgattā nekkhammādhimutto hoti, khayā dosassa vītadosattā nekkhammādhimutto hoti, khayā mohassa vītamohattā nekkhammādhimutto hoti.

“But, venerable sir, it might occur to some venerable one: ‘Surely this venerable one is resolved on renunciation merely by relying on faith.’ But, venerable sir, it should not be seen in that way. A bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, not seeing anything further to be done for himself, nor any accumulation of what has been done—because of the destruction of lust, being dispassionate, he is resolved upon renunciation; because of the destruction of hatred, being without hatred, he is resolved upon renunciation; because of the destruction of delusion, being without delusion, he is resolved upon renunciation.

‘‘Siyā kho pana, bhante, idhekaccassa āyasmato evamassa – ‘lābhasakkārasilokaṃ nūna ayamāyasmā nikāmayamāno pavivekādhimutto’ti. Na kho panetaṃ, bhante, evaṃ daṭṭhabbaṃ. Khīṇāsavo, bhante, bhikkhu, vusitavā, katakaraṇīyo, karaṇīyamattānaṃ [karaṇīyaṃ attano (aṅguttarapāḷiyaṃ)] asamanupassanto katassa vā paṭicayaṃ, khayā rāgassa vītarāgattā pavivekādhimutto hoti, khayā dosassa vītadosattā pavivekādhimutto hoti, khayā mohassa vītamohattā pavivekādhimutto hoti.

“But, venerable sir, it might occur to some venerable one: ‘Surely this venerable one, desiring gain, honor, and fame, is resolved upon seclusion.’ But, venerable sir, it should not be seen in that way. A bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, not seeing anything further to be done for himself, nor any accumulation of what has been done—because of the destruction of lust, being dispassionate, he is resolved upon seclusion; because of the destruction of hatred, being without hatred, he is resolved upon seclusion; because of the destruction of delusion, being without delusion, he is resolved upon seclusion.”

‘‘Siyā kho pana, bhante, idhekaccassa āyasmato evamassa – ‘sīlabbataparāmāsaṃ nūna ayamāyasmā sārato paccāgacchanto abyāpajjādhimutto’ti. Na kho panetaṃ, bhante, evaṃ daṭṭhabbaṃ.

“Venerable sir, some venerable one might think: ‘Surely this venerable one, regarding attachment to precepts and observances as essential, is inclined to the unmolested.’ But, venerable sir, this should not be seen in that way. A monk whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, who does not see anything further to be done or any accumulation of what has been done, is inclined to the unmolested because of the destruction of lust, being dispassionate; because of the destruction of hatred, being without hatred; because of the destruction of delusion, being without delusion.

‘‘Khayā rāgassa vītarāgattā upādānakkhayādhimutto hoti, khayā dosassa vītadosattā upādānakkhayādhimutto hoti, khayā mohassa vītamohattā upādānakkhayādhimutto hoti.

“Because of the destruction of lust, being dispassionate, he is inclined to the destruction of clinging; because of the destruction of hatred, being without hatred, he is inclined to the destruction of clinging; because of the destruction of delusion, being without delusion, he is inclined to the destruction of clinging.

‘‘Khayā rāgassa vītarāgattā taṇhakkhayādhimutto hoti, khayā dosassa vītadosattā taṇhakkhayādhimutto hoti, khayā mohassa vītamohattā taṇhakkhayādhimutto hoti.

“Because of the destruction of lust, being dispassionate, he is inclined to the destruction of craving; because of the destruction of hatred, being without hatred, he is inclined to the destruction of craving; because of the destruction of delusion, being without delusion, he is inclined to the destruction of craving.

‘‘Khayā rāgassa vītarāgattā asammohādhimutto hoti, khayā dosassa vītadosattā asammohādhimutto hoti, khayā mohassa vītamohattā asammohādhimutto hoti.

“Because of the destruction of lust, being dispassionate, he is inclined to undeludedness; because of the destruction of hatred, being without hatred, he is inclined to undeludedness; because of the destruction of delusion, being without delusion, he is inclined to undeludedness.

“Venerable sir, for a monk whose mind is rightly liberated in this way, even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into the range of the eye, they do not overwhelm his mind. His mind remains unmixed, steady, unshaken, and he observes its passing away. Even if powerful sounds cognizable by the ear… Even if powerful smells cognizable by the nose… Even if powerful tastes cognizable by the tongue… Even if powerful tangible objects cognizable by the body… Even if powerful mental phenomena cognizable by the mind come into the range of the mind, they do not overwhelm his mind. His mind remains unmixed, steady, unshaken, and he observes its passing away. Just as, venerable sir, a rock mountain, without fissures, without holes, a single mass, would not be shaken, disturbed, or agitated by strong winds and rains coming from the east… from the west… from the north… from the south—in the same way, venerable sir, for a monk whose mind is rightly liberated in this way, even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into the range of the eye, they do not overwhelm his mind. His mind remains unmixed, steady, unshaken, and he observes its passing away. Even if powerful sounds cognizable by the ear… Even if powerful smells cognizable by the nose… Even if powerful tastes cognizable by the tongue… Even if powerful tangible objects cognizable by the body… Even if powerful mental phenomena cognizable by the mind come into the range of the mind, they do not overwhelm his mind. His mind remains unmixed, steady, unshaken, and he observes its passing away.”

Nekkhammaṃ adhimuttassa, pavivekañca cetaso;Abyāpajjādhimuttassa, upādānakkhayassa ca.

One inclined to renunciation, and to solitude of mind; One inclined to the unmolested, and to the destruction of clinging.

Taṇhakkhayādhimuttassa, asammohañca cetaso;Disvā āyatanuppādaṃ, sammā cittaṃ vimuccati.

One inclined to the destruction of craving, and to undeludedness of mind; Having seen the arising and passing away of the sense bases, the mind is rightly liberated.

Tassa sammāvimuttassa, santacittassa bhikkhuno;Katassa paṭicayo natthi, karaṇīyaṃ na vijjati.

For that monk, rightly liberated, with peaceful mind, there is no accumulation, no further duty to be done.

Selo yathā ekagghano, vātena na samīrati;Evaṃ rūpā rasā saddā, gandhā phassā ca kevalā.

Just as a solid rock, a single mass, is not stirred by the wind, so too forms, tastes, sounds, smells, and touches, all of them.

Iṭṭhā dhammā aniṭṭhā ca, na pavedhenti tādino;Ṭhitaṃ cittaṃ vippamuttaṃ, vayañcassānupassatīti.

Pleasant and unpleasant things do not agitate one who is steadfast; His mind is firm and liberated, observing its passing away.

Soṇakoḷivisavatthu niṭṭhitaṃ.

The discourse on Soṇa Koḷivisa is concluded.

245.Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Thus, monks, noble sons declare arahantship, the meaning is spoken, and the self is not introduced. Yet, some foolish men here, it seems, declare something while laughing, and they later come to ruin." Then the Blessed One addressed Venerable Soṇa: "You, Soṇa, are delicate. I allow you, Soṇa, a single-layered sandal." "Venerable sir, I abandoned eighty cartloads of gold when I went forth from the household life into homelessness, as well as a seven-elephant army. If I now wear a single-layered sandal, there will be those who say, 'Soṇa the Koliyan abandoned eighty cartloads of gold when he went forth from the household life into homelessness, as well as a seven-elephant army. Now he is attached to single-layered sandals.' If the Blessed One permits it for the Saṅgha of monks, I will also use it. But if the Blessed One does not permit it for the Saṅgha of monks, I will not use it either." Then the Blessed One, on this cause and on this occasion, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: "I allow, monks, a single-layered sandal. Monks, double-layered sandals should not be worn. Triple-layered sandals should not be worn. Sandals with layer upon layer should not be worn. Whoever wears them commits an offense of wrongdoing."

246.At that time the group of six monks were wearing sandals that were entirely blue… entirely yellow… entirely red… entirely madder-dyed… entirely black… entirely bright-crimson… entirely dark-crimson. People were annoyed, grumbled, and criticized them, saying: "Just like householders enjoying sensual pleasures." They told this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, sandals that are entirely blue should not be worn… entirely yellow should not be worn, entirely red should not be worn, entirely madder-dyed should not be worn, entirely black should not be worn, entirely bright-crimson should not be worn, entirely dark-crimson should not be worn.

247.Then, in the morning, the Blessed One, having dressed, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms, with a certain bhikkhu as his attendant. Then that bhikkhu, limping, followed closely behind the Blessed One. A certain lay follower, having put on sandals with straps, saw the Blessed One coming from afar. Still wearing his sandals, he approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, and then approached that bhikkhu. Having approached, he paid homage to the bhikkhu and said, “Why, venerable sir, is the venerable one limping?” “My feet, friend, are cracked.” “Here, venerable sir, are the sandals.” “Enough, friend, sandals with straps have been prohibited by the Blessed One.” “Take these sandals, bhikkhu.” Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, because of this incident, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the bhikkhus: “I allow, bhikkhus, used sandals with straps for one who is lame. Bhikkhus, new sandals with straps should not be worn. Whoever wears them commits an offense of wrong conduct.”

248.At that time the Blessed One was walking up and down in the open air, without footwear. “The Teacher is walking without footwear,” so the elder bhikkhus also walked without footwear. The bhikkhus of the Group of Six, while the Teacher was walking without footwear and the elder bhikkhus were walking without footwear, walked up and down wearing footwear. Those bhikkhus who were modest… grumbled, criticized, and spread it about, “How can the bhikkhus of the Group of Six walk up and down wearing footwear while the Teacher is walking without footwear and the elder bhikkhus are walking without footwear?” Then those bhikkhus reported the matter to the Blessed One… “Is it true, bhikkhus, that the bhikkhus of the Group of Six walk up and down wearing footwear while the Teacher is walking without footwear and the elder bhikkhus are walking without footwear?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked them… “How, bhikkhus, can these foolish men walk up and down wearing footwear while the Teacher is walking without footwear and the elder bhikkhus are walking without footwear? These, bhikkhus, are householders dressed in white, who for the sake of a means of livelihood, live showing respect, deference, and appropriate behaviour towards their teachers. But here, bhikkhus, it would be fitting if you, having gone forth in this well-expounded Dhamma and Discipline, were to live showing respect, deference, and appropriate behaviour towards teachers who are considered teachers, and preceptors who are considered preceptors. Instead, you live without respect, without deference, and with inappropriate behaviour. This will not inspire confidence in those without it… Having rebuked them… having given a Dhamma talk, he addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, one should not walk up and down wearing footwear when one’s teachers or those considered teachers, or preceptors or those considered preceptors, are walking without footwear. Whoever does so, there is an offense of wrong conduct. And, bhikkhus, footwear should not be worn within the monastery. Whoever wears it, there is an offense of wrong conduct.”

249.At that time, a certain bhikkhu had a foot ailment. The bhikkhus attended to him, helping him to remove his excrement and urine. The Blessed One, while wandering on a tour of the lodgings, saw those bhikkhus attending to that bhikkhu, helping him to remove his excrement and urine. Having seen this, he approached those bhikkhus and asked, “What is the ailment of this bhikkhu, bhikkhus?” “Venerable sir, this venerable one has a foot ailment. We are attending to him, helping him to remove his excrement and urine.” Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the bhikkhus: “I allow, bhikkhus, for one whose feet are painful, whose feet are cracked, or who has a foot ailment, to wear footwear.”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū adhotehi pādehi mañcampi pīṭhampi abhiruhanti; cīvarampi senāsanampi dussati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, ‘idāni mañcaṃ vā pīṭhaṃ vā abhiruhissāmī’’ti upāhanaṃ dhāretunti.

At that time bhikkhus were climbing onto beds and chairs with unwashed feet, soiling robes and bedding. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, bhikkhus, wearing footwear with the thought, ‘Now I will climb onto a bed or a chair.’”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū rattiyā uposathaggampi sannisajjampi gacchantā andhakāre khāṇumpi kaṇṭakampi akkamanti; pādā dukkhā honti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, ajjhārāme upāhanaṃ dhāretuṃ, ukkaṃ, padīpaṃ, kattaradaṇḍanti.

At that time, bhikkhus, while going in the dark at night to the Uposatha gathering or assembly, stepped on stumps and thorns, causing their feet to suffer. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, bhikkhus, the wearing of footwear within the monastery grounds, as well as torches, lamps, and a walking stick.”

Ajjhārāme upāhanapaṭikkhepo niṭṭhito.

The Prohibition of Footwear within the Monastery is concluded.

250.Now at that time the group of six monks, having risen early in the morning, put on wooden sandals and walked about in the open air, making loud noises, great noises, clattering noises, engaging in various kinds of idle talk, such as: talk about kings, talk about thieves, talk about ministers, talk about armies, talk about fear, talk about battles, talk about food, talk about drink, talk about clothes, talk about beds, talk about garlands, talk about perfumes, talk about relatives, talk about vehicles, talk about villages, talk about towns, talk about cities, talk about countries, talk about women, talk about heroes, talk about streets, talk about at the crossroads, talk about the departed, talk about diversity, talk about worldly stories, talk about the ocean, talk about becoming and non-becoming; and they even stepped on insects and killed them, and they disturbed monks from their meditation. The monks who were modest… complained, criticized, and protested: “How can the group of six monks, having risen early in the morning, put on wooden sandals and walk about in the open air, making loud noises, great noises, clattering noises, engaging in various kinds of idle talk, such as: talk about kings, talk about thieves… talk about becoming and non-becoming, and even step on insects and kill them, and disturb monks from their meditation?” Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One… “Is it true, monks, that the group of six monks, having risen early in the morning, put on wooden sandals and walk about in the open air, making loud noises, great noises, clattering noises, engaging in various kinds of idle talk, such as: talk about kings, talk about thieves… talk about becoming and non-becoming, and even step on insects and kill them, and disturb monks from their meditation?” “It is true, Blessed One.” … Having rebuked them, the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, wooden sandals should not be worn. Whoever wears them commits an offense of wrong-doing.”

Yo dhāreyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

Then the Blessed One, having stayed in Rājagaha as long as he pleased, set out on a journey toward Bārāṇasī. Traveling in stages, he eventually arrived at Bārāṇasī. There the Blessed One stayed in the Deer Park at Isipatana near Bārāṇasī. At that time, the group of six monks—thinking that wooden sandals had been prohibited by the Blessed One—had young palm trees cut down and wore sandals made of palm leaves. Those young palm trees, having been cut down, withered. People complained, criticized, and protested: “How can these Sakyan ascetics have young palm trees cut down to wear sandals made of palm leaves? Those young palm trees, having been cut down, wither. These Sakyan ascetics are harming living beings that have only one faculty!” The monks heard the complaints, criticisms, and protests of those people. Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Is it true, monks, that the group of six monks had young palm trees cut down and wore sandals made of palm leaves, and those young palm trees, having been cut down, withered?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked them: “How can these foolish men have young palm trees cut down to wear sandals made of palm leaves? Those young palm trees, having been cut down, wither. Monks, people perceive life in trees. This will not inspire confidence in those without it or increase it in those who have it…” After rebuking them, he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, sandals made of palm leaves should not be worn. Whoever wears them commits an offense of wrong-doing.”

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū ‘bhagavatā tālapattapādukā paṭikkhittā’ti veḷutaruṇe chedāpetvā veḷupattapādukāyo dhārenti. Tāni veḷutaruṇāni chinnāni milāyanti.

At that time the group of six monks, thinking, “The Blessed One has prohibited palm-leaf sandals,” had young bamboo cut to make bamboo-leaf sandals and wore them. The young bamboo that was cut withered. People complained, criticized, and protested: “How can these Sakyan ascetics have young bamboo cut to make bamboo-leaf sandals and wear them? The young bamboo that was cut withered. These Sakyan ascetics are harming living beings that have only one faculty!” The monks heard the complaints, criticism, and protests of those people. Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. … Monks, people perceive life in trees… Monks, bamboo-leaf sandals should not be worn. Whoever wears them commits an offense of wrong-doing.

251.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Bārāṇasī as long as he pleased, set out on a journey to Bhaddiya. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Bhaddiya. There, the Blessed One stayed at Bhaddiya in the Jātiyā Grove. At that time, the monks at Bhaddiya were indulging in various kinds of footwear decorations, making and having others make grass sandals, reed sandals, bark sandals, date-palm leaf sandals, kamala-grass sandals, woolen sandals, and neglecting recitation, questioning, higher virtue, higher mind, and higher wisdom. Those monks who were of few desires… complained, criticized, and protested: “How can the monks at Bhaddiya indulge in various kinds of footwear decorations, making and having others make grass sandals, reed sandals, bark sandals, date-palm leaf sandals, kamala-grass sandals, woolen sandals, and neglect recitation, questioning, higher virtue, higher mind, and higher wisdom?” Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One… “Is it true, monks, that the monks at Bhaddiya indulge in various kinds of footwear decorations, making and having others make grass sandals…and neglect recitation, questioning, higher virtue, higher mind, and higher wisdom?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One rebuked them… “How can these foolish men indulge in various kinds of footwear decorations, making and having others make grass sandals…and neglect recitation, questioning, higher virtue, higher mind, and higher wisdom? This will not inspire confidence in those without it or increase it in those who have it….” Having rebuked them… he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, grass sandals should not be worn, reed sandals should not be worn, bark sandals should not be worn, date-palm leaf sandals should not be worn, kamala-grass sandals should not be worn, woolen sandals should not be worn, gold sandals should not be worn, silver sandals should not be worn, jeweled sandals should not be worn, beryl sandals should not be worn, crystal sandals should not be worn, bronze sandals should not be worn, glass sandals should not be worn, tin sandals should not be worn, lead sandals should not be worn, copper sandals should not be worn. Whoever wears them commits an offense of wrong-doing. And monks, sandals that are put on when walking around should not be worn. Whoever wears them commits an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, three kinds of fixed sandals that are not used for walking around: a sandal for the toilet, a sandal for urination, and a sandal for rinsing.”

252.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Bhaddiya as long as he pleased, set out on a journey to Sāvatthī. Traveling in stages, he arrived at Sāvatthī. There the Blessed One stayed in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the group of six monks, while cows were crossing the Aciravatī River, would grab them by their horns, ears, necks, or tails, or climb onto their backs, and with lustful minds touch their genitals. They even drowned a young bull. People complained and criticized them, saying, “How can these Sakyan ascetics grab cows by their horns... just like householders indulging in sensual pleasures?” The monks heard these complaints and criticisms and reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Is it true, monks...?” “It is true, Blessed One.” After rebuking them, the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, cows should not be grabbed by their horns, nor by their ears, nor by their necks, nor by their tails. One should not climb onto their backs. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong conduct. And, monks, one should not touch their genitals with a lustful mind. Whoever does so commits a serious offense. A young bull should not be drowned. Whoever does so must be dealt with according to the law.”

Kaṭṭhapādukādipaṭikkhepo niṭṭhito.

The prohibition against wooden sandals, etc., is concluded.

253.At that time the group of six monks were traveling in vehicles—sometimes with cows yoked and a male driver, sometimes with oxen yoked and a female driver. People complained and criticized, saying, “Just like those at a great festival on the Ganges!” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, one should not travel in a vehicle. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong conduct.” At that time, a certain monk in the Kosala country, on his way to Sāvatthī to see the Blessed One, fell ill along the way. Then that monk left the road and sat down at the foot of a tree. People saw that monk and asked, “Where are you going, Venerable sir?” “I am going to Sāvatthī, friends, to see the Blessed One.” “Come, Venerable sir, let’s go.” “I cannot, friends, I am ill.” “Come, Venerable sir, climb into the vehicle.” “Enough, friends, the Blessed One has prohibited vehicles,” he said, and hesitated to climb in. Then that monk arrived in Sāvatthī and told the monks what had happened. The monks reported it to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, a vehicle for one who is ill.” Then the monks wondered, “Should it be yoked with cows or yoked with oxen?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, a vehicle yoked with oxen, with a handrail.”

Tena kho pana samayena aññatarassa bhikkhuno yānugghātena bāḷhataraṃ aphāsu ahosi. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sivikaṃ pāṭaṅkinti.

At that time a certain monk had a severe illness due to being jolted in a vehicle. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, a palanquin or a litter.”

Yānādipaṭikkhepo niṭṭhito.

The prohibition of vehicles is concluded.

Yo dhāreyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

254.Now at that time the group of six monks used high and grand beds, such as: an oversized chair, a lion-legged couch, a long-fleeced rug, a patterned woolen rug, a white woolen rug, a woolen red rug with dense floral designs, a cotton quilt, a woolen rug with lion and tiger designs, a woolen rug with hair raised on one side, a woolen rug with hair raised on both sides, a silk fringe-made rug embroidered with jewels, a silk rug embroidered with jewels, a woolen rug suitable for sixteen dancing girls to dance on, an elephant rug, a horse rug, a chariot rug, a rug made of antelope skins sewn together to the size of a bed, a superior mattress made from Kadalī deer skin, with an upper canopy, and a bed with red cushions at both ends. People wandering about the monastery saw this and complained and criticized them, saying, “Just like householders enjoying sensual pleasures!” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, high and grand beds should not be used, such as: an oversized chair, a lion-legged couch, a long-fleeced rug, a patterned woolen rug, a white woolen rug, a woolen red rug with dense floral designs, a cotton quilt, a woolen rug with lion and tiger designs, a woolen rug with hair raised on one side, a woolen rug with hair raised on both sides, a silk fringe-made rug embroidered with jewels, a silk rug embroidered with jewels, a woolen rug suitable for sixteen dancing girls to dance on, an elephant rug, a horse rug, a chariot rug, a rug made of antelope skins sewn together to the size of a bed, a superior mattress made from Kadalī deer skin, with an upper canopy, and a bed with red cushions at both ends.

255.At that time the group of six monks—thinking, “The Blessed One has prohibited high and luxurious beds”—wore large hides: lion hides, tiger hides, and leopard hides. These were cut to the size of beds, cut to the size of stools; some were spread inside the beds, some outside the beds; some were spread inside the stools, some outside the stools. People wandering on their monastery rounds saw this and complained, grumbled, and criticized: “Just like householders who indulge in sensual pleasures!” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, large hides—lion hides, tiger hides, or leopard hides—should not be worn. Whoever wears them commits an offense of wrong doing.”

Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

At that time, the group of six monks—thinking, “The Blessed One has prohibited large hides”—wore cow hides. These were cut to the size of beds, cut to the size of stools; some were spread inside the beds, some outside the beds; some were spread inside the stools, some outside the stools. Now, a certain wicked monk was a regular visitor at the house of a certain wicked lay follower. Then, that wicked monk, having dressed in the morning and taken his bowl and robe, went to the dwelling of that wicked lay follower. Having approached, he sat down on the prepared seat. Then, that wicked lay follower approached that wicked monk, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. At that time, that wicked lay follower had a young calf, beautiful, attractive, charming, and pleasing, like a leopard cub. That wicked monk carefully observed that calf. Then, that wicked lay follower said to that wicked monk, “Venerable sir, why is the venerable one carefully observing this calf?” “Friend, I have a need for the hide of this calf.” Then, that wicked lay follower killed that calf, skinned its hide, and gave it to that wicked monk. That wicked monk, having concealed that hide under his outer robe, departed. Then, that cow, longing for her calf, followed that wicked monk from behind. The bhikkhus said, “Friend, why is this cow following the venerable one from behind?” “I too, friend, do not know why this cow is following me from behind.” At that time, that wicked monk’s outer robe was stained with blood. The bhikkhus said, “Friend, what has happened to the venerable one’s outer robe?” Then, that wicked monk explained the matter to the bhikkhus. “But friend, did you instigate the taking of life?” “Yes, friend.” Those bhikkhus who were modest complained, grumbled, and criticized: “How could a bhikkhu instigate the taking of life? Hasn’t the Blessed One, in many ways, condemned the taking of life and praised abstaining from taking life?” Then, those bhikkhus reported the matter to the Blessed One.

Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā taṃ pāpabhikkhuṃ paṭipucchi – ‘‘saccaṃ kira tvaṃ, bhikkhu, pāṇātipāte samādapesī’’ti? Saccaṃ bhagavāti…pe… kathañhi nāma tvaṃ, moghapurisa, pāṇātipāte samādapessasi, nanu mayā, moghapurisa, anekapariyāyena pāṇātipāto garahito, pāṇātipātā veramaṇī pasatthā.

Then the Blessed One, on account of this incident, on this occasion, had the Sangha of bhikkhus convened and questioned that wicked monk: “Is it true, bhikkhu, that you incited the taking of life?” “It is true, Blessed One.” … “How could you, foolish man, incite the taking of life? Haven’t I, foolish man, in many ways criticized the taking of life and praised abstaining from taking life? This, foolish man, is not for the confidence of those who are not confident…” Having rebuked him, the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, one should not incite the taking of life. Whoever incites it should be dealt with according to the Dhamma. Bhikkhus, a cow hide should not be worn. Whoever wears it incurs an offense of wrong doing. And, bhikkhus, no hide whatsoever should be worn. Whoever wears it incurs an offense of wrong doing.”

256.At that time, people had couches and chairs that were covered with leather, bound with leather. The monks, being scrupulous, did not sit on them. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow you to sit on what is prepared by householders, but not to lie down on them.”

At that time, dwellings were interwoven with leather strips. The monks, being scrupulous, did not sit on them. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow you to sit on them as long as it is merely for binding.”

At that time, the monks of the group of six were entering the village wearing sandals. People complained, were annoyed, and criticized them, saying: “Just like householders enjoying sensual pleasures!” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, a village should not be entered wearing sandals. Whoever does so incurs an offense of wrong-doing.”

257.At that time, the Venerable Mahākaccāna was dwelling in Avanti, at Kuraraghara on Mount Papāta. At that time, the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa was the attendant of the Venerable Mahākaccāna. Then the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa approached the Venerable Mahākaccāna, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa said to the Venerable Mahākaccāna: “Venerable sir, as I understand the Dhamma taught by the Venerable Mahākaccāna, it is not easy for one living at home to lead the perfectly complete and perfectly pure holy life, polished like a conch shell. I wish, Venerable sir, to shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness. May the Venerable Mahākaccāna give me the going forth.” “It is difficult, Soṇa, to lead the holy life of one meal a day and sleeping alone for life. Soṇa, remain as a householder and apply yourself to the Buddha’s teaching, observing at suitable times the holy life of one meal a day and sleeping alone.” Then the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa’s aspiration for going forth subsided. A second time, the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa … A third time, the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa approached the Venerable Mahākaccāna, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa said to the Venerable Mahākaccāna: “Venerable sir, as I understand the Dhamma taught by the Venerable Mahākaccāna, it is not easy for one living at home to lead the perfectly complete and perfectly pure holy life, polished like a conch shell. I wish, Venerable sir, to shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness. May the Venerable Mahākaccāna give me the going forth.” Then the Venerable Mahākaccāna gave the going forth to the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa. At that time, the southern Avanti region had few monks. Then, after the lapse of three years, the Venerable Mahākaccāna, with difficulty and effort, assembled from various places a Sangha of ten monks and gave the higher ordination to the Venerable Soṇa.

Then, when Venerable Soṇa had completed the rains retreat, while he was in seclusion and solitude, this thought arose in his mind: "I have only heard about the Blessed One—that he is like this and like that—but I have not seen him face to face. If my preceptor permits me, I should go to see the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One." Then, in the evening, Venerable Soṇa emerged from seclusion and approached Venerable Mahākaccāna. Having approached, he paid homage to Venerable Mahākaccāna and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, Venerable Soṇa said to Venerable Mahākaccāna: "Just now, venerable sir, while I was in seclusion and solitude, this thought arose in my mind: 'I have only heard about the Blessed One—that he is like this and like that—but I have not seen him face to face. If my preceptor permits me, I should go to see the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One.' Venerable sir, if my preceptor permits me, I would go to see the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One.""Good, good, Soṇa! Go, Soṇa, to see the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One. You will see, Soṇa, the Blessed One—gracious, inspiring confidence, with peaceful faculties and peaceful mind, attained to the highest taming and calm, controlled, guarded, restrained, a noble one. Well then, Soṇa, in my name, bow your head at the feet of the Blessed One and say: 'Venerable sir, my preceptor, Venerable Mahākaccāna, bows his head at the feet of the Blessed One.' And say this: 'Venerable sir, the Southern Country of Avanti is lacking in monks. After three years had passed, with difficulty and hardship, I managed to gather a group of ten monks and received the higher ordination. May the Blessed One please allow the Southern Country of Avanti to have the higher ordination with a smaller group. Venerable sir, the Southern Country of Avanti has rough ground, thorny and stony. May the Blessed One please allow the Southern Country of Avanti to wear sandals with multiple layers. Venerable sir, the people of the Southern Country of Avanti value bathing and are fond of cleanliness. May the Blessed One please allow the Southern Country of Avanti to bathe frequently. Venerable sir, in the Southern Country of Avanti, hides are used as bedding—sheepskin, goatskin, and deerskin. Just as in the middle country, they use woolen blankets, silk blankets, and cotton blankets, so too in the Southern Country of Avanti, hides are used as bedding—sheepskin, goatskin, and deerskin. May the Blessed One please allow the Southern Country of Avanti to use hides as bedding—sheepskin, goatskin, and deerskin. Nowadays, venerable sir, people give robes to monks who have gone beyond the boundary, saying: "We give this robe to such-and-such a monk." When they return, they inform them: "Friend, such-and-such people have given you a robe." Out of scruple, they do not accept, thinking: "May it not become an offense requiring forfeiture for us." May the Blessed One please explain a method regarding robes.'""Yes, venerable sir," replied Venerable Soṇa to Venerable Mahākaccāna. Then he rose from his seat, paid homage to Venerable Mahākaccāna, circumambulated him, put his lodging in order, took his bowl and robe, and set out for Sāvatthī. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sāvatthī, at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park, and approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Then the Blessed One addressed Venerable Ānanda: "Ānanda, prepare a lodging for this newly arrived monk." Then Venerable Ānanda thought: "When the Blessed One tells me, 'Ānanda, prepare a lodging for this newly arrived monk,' the Blessed One wishes to stay in the same dwelling with this monk; the Blessed One wishes to stay in the same dwelling with Venerable Soṇa." So he prepared a lodging for Venerable Soṇa in the same dwelling where the Blessed One was staying.

258.Then the Blessed One, having spent much of the night in the open air, entered the dwelling. The venerable Soṇa also, having spent much of the night in the open air, entered the dwelling. Then the Blessed One, having risen at dawn, addressed the venerable Soṇa: "Let the Dhamma occur to you, monk, to speak.""So be it, Lord," replied the venerable Soṇa to the Blessed One, and then he recited all the verses of the Aṭṭhakavagga in a melodious voice. Then the Blessed One, at the conclusion of the venerable Soṇa's recitation, expressed his approval: "Good, good, monk. Well grasped by you, monk, are the verses of the Aṭṭhakavagga, well considered, well borne in mind. You are endowed with beautiful speech, clear, distinct, fluent, and expressive of meaning. How many years have you been ordained, monk?""One year, Blessed One.""But why then, monk, did you take so long?""For long have I seen, Lord, the danger in sensual pleasures, yet crowded is the household life with many duties, many things to be done."Then the Blessed One, having understood the meaning of this, on that occasion uttered this inspired utterance:

[udā. 46 udānepi] ‘‘Disvā ādīnavaṃ loke, ñatvā dhammaṃ nirūpadhiṃ;Ariyo na ramatī pāpe, pāpe na ramatī sucī’’ti.

"Having seen the danger in the world, Knowing the unconditioned Dhamma; The noble one delights not in evil, The pure one delights not in evil."

Te kukkuccāyantā na sādiyanti – ‘mā no nissaggiyaṃ ahosī’ti; appeva nāma bhagavā cīvare pariyāyaṃ ācikkheyyā’’ti.

Then Venerable Soṇa—thinking, “The Blessed One approves of me; this is the right time to introduce my preceptor”—rose from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, bowed his head at the Blessed One’s feet, and said: “Venerable sir, my preceptor, Venerable Mahākaccāna, bows his head at the Blessed One’s feet and says this: ‘Venerable sir, the Avanti-dakkhiṇāpatha has few monks. After three years had passed, with great difficulty and effort, I gathered a group of ten monks from various places and received higher ordination. Perhaps the Blessed One might allow higher ordination with a smaller group in the Avanti-dakkhiṇāpatha. Venerable sir, the soil of Avanti-dakkhiṇāpatha is black, rough, and covered with thorns. Perhaps the Blessed One might allow sandals with many layers of lining in the Avanti-dakkhiṇāpatha. Venerable sir, the people of Avanti-dakkhiṇāpatha are fond of bathing and are scrupulous about water purity. Perhaps the Blessed One might allow frequent bathing in the Avanti-dakkhiṇāpatha. Venerable sir, in Avanti-dakkhiṇāpatha, skins are used as coverings—goat skins, sheep skins, and deer skins. Just as in the middle countries, eragū, moragū, majjārū, and jantū are used, so too in Avanti-dakkhiṇāpatha, skins are used as coverings—goat skins, sheep skins, and deer skins. Perhaps the Blessed One might allow skins as coverings in the Avanti-dakkhiṇāpatha—goat skins, sheep skins, and deer skins. Now, venerable sir, people give robes to monks who have gone beyond the boundary, saying, ‘We give this robe to such-and-such a monk.’ When they return, they inform them, ‘Friend, such-and-such people have given you a robe.’ Out of scruples, they do not accept, thinking, ‘Lest it become a nissaggiya offense for us.’ Perhaps the Blessed One might explain a procedure regarding robes.’”

259.Then the Blessed One, on this occasion and in connection with this matter, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: "Monks, Avanti-Dakshinapatha has few monks. I allow, monks, ordination by a chapter of five, including one versed in the Vinaya, in all border regions. These are the border regions: In the eastern direction, the town named Gajaṅgala, beyond which is Mahāsālā; beyond that are the border regions, and on this side is the central region. In the southeast direction, the river named Sallavatī; beyond that are the border regions, and on this side is the central region. In the southern direction, the town named Setakaṇṇika; beyond that are the border regions, and on this side is the central region. In the western direction, the brahmin village named Thūṇa; beyond that are the border regions, and on this side is the central region. In the northern direction, the mountain named Usīraddhaja; beyond that are the border regions, and on this side is the central region. I allow, monks, in such border regions, ordination by a chapter of five, including one versed in the Vinaya. In Avanti-Dakshinapatha, monks, the ground is black, rough, and covered with cow-thorns. I allow, monks, in all border regions, the use of multilayered sandals. In Avanti-Dakshinapatha, monks, people value bathing and purification with water. I allow, monks, in all border regions, regular bathing. In Avanti-Dakshinapatha, monks, hides are used as spreads: sheepskin, goatskin, and deerskin. Just as, monks, in the central regions there are spreads of wool, peacock feathers, cat hair, and other animal hair, even so, monks, in Avanti-Dakshinapatha, hides are used as spreads: sheepskin, goatskin, and deerskin. I allow, monks, in all border regions, hides as spreads: sheepskin, goatskin, and deerskin. Here, monks, people give robes to monks who have gone beyond the boundary saying, ‘We give this robe to so-and-so.’ I allow, monks, the acceptance of such a donation, but it is not yet reckoned as received until it reaches the hand."

Mahākaccānassa pañcavaraparidassanā niṭṭhitā.

The exposition of Mahākaccāna's five boons is concluded.

Cammakkhandhako pañcamo.

The fifth is the Chapter on Hides.

159.Summary:

Rājā ca māgadho soṇo, asītisahassissaro;Sāgato gijjhakūṭasmiṃ, bahuṃ dasseti uttariṃ.

Soṇa, the Magadhan, lord of eighty thousand, came to Vulture Peak, and showed much more.

Pabbajjāraddhabhijjiṃsu, vīṇaṃ ekapalāsikaṃ;Nīlā pītā lohitikā, mañjiṭṭhā kaṇhameva ca.

They broke their lutes, having embarked on renunciation—a single-stringed lute; blue, yellow, red, madder, and black.

Mahāraṅgamahānāmā, vaddhikā ca paṭikkhipi;Khallakā puṭapāli ca, tūlatittirameṇḍajā.

Mahāraṅga, Mahānāma, and Vaddhikā were prohibited; Khallaka, Puṭapāli, Tūla, Tittira, and Meṇḍajā.

Vicchikā moracitrā ca, sīhabyagghā ca dīpikā;Ajinuddā majjārī ca, kāḷaluvakaparikkhaṭā.

Scorpion-like hides, peacock-spotted hides, and those of lions, tigers, and leopards; deer hides, cat hides, and black jackal hides.

Phalitupāhanā khilā, dhotakhāṇukhaṭakhaṭā;Tālaveḷutiṇaṃ ceva, muñjapabbajahintālā.

Split sandals, wooden clogs, and clogs making a rattling sound from washed stumps; and those made of palmyra, bamboo, and grass, and of munja, pabbaja, and hintāla.

Lotus-colored blankets, gold, silver, gems, beryl, crystal, bronze, glass, tin, lead, and copper.

Gāvī yānaṃ gilāno ca, purisāyuttasivikā;Sayanāni mahācammā, gocammehi ca pāpako.

A cow as a vehicle, and the sick; a palanquin carried by men; beds of large hides, and the evil of cowhides.

Gihīnaṃ cammavaddhehi, pavisanti gilāyano;Mahākaccāyano soṇo, sarena aṭṭhakavaggikaṃ.

Laypeople with leather thongs enter to visit the sick; Mahākaccāna and Soṇa, with their voices, (recited) the Aṭṭhakavagga.

Upasampadaṃ pañcahi, guṇaṅguṇā dhuvasinā;Cammattharaṇānuññāsi, na tāva gaṇanūpagaṃ;Adāsi me vare pañca, soṇattherassa nāyakoti.

Ordination by five, multilayered sandals, regular bathing; he permitted hide spreads, (and the rule) not yet reckoned as received; the Leader gave five boons to the elder Soṇa.

Imamhi khandhake vatthūni tesaṭṭhi.
