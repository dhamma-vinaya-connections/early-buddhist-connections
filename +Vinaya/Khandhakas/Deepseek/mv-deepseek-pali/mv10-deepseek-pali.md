271.The Kosambī Dispute

451. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā kosambiyaṃ viharati ghositārāme. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu āpattiṃ āpanno hoti.

Atha kho te bhikkhū taṃ bhikkhuṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘āpattiṃ tvaṃ, āvuso, āpanno, passasetaṃ āpatti’’nti? ‘‘Natthi me, āvuso, āpatti yamahaṃ passeyya’’nti.

Atha kho te ukkhittānuvattakā bhikkhū yena ukkhepakā bhikkhū tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā ukkhepake bhikkhū etadavocuṃ – ‘‘anāpatti esā, āvuso, nesā āpatti.

Evampi kho te ukkhittānuvattakā bhikkhū ukkhepakehi bhikkhūhi vuccamānā tatheva taṃ ukkhittakaṃ bhikkhuṃ anuvattiṃsu anuparivāresuṃ.

451.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita’s monastery. Now at that time a certain monk had committed an offense. He had the view that it was an offense, but other monks had the view that it was not an offense. Later, he came to have the view that it was not an offense, but other monks had the view that it was an offense. Then those monks said to that monk: “Friend, you have committed an offense. Acknowledge that offense.” “There is no offense for me to acknowledge, friends.” Then those monks, having achieved unanimity, suspended that monk for not acknowledging the offense. Now that monk was learned, a master of the traditions, a Dhamma-bearer, a Vinaya-bearer, a Mātikā-bearer; he was wise, competent, intelligent, conscientious, scrupulous, and desirous of training. Then that monk approached monks who were well-known and esteemed and said: “This is not an offense, friends. I have not committed an offense. I have not been suspended. I have been suspended by an unrighteous act, one that is motivated by anger and is without valid basis. Venerables, please take my side in accordance with the Dhamma and the Vinaya.” And that monk succeeded in getting well-known and esteemed monks to take his side. He then sent a messenger to well-known and esteemed monks in the countryside: “This is not an offense, friends. I have not committed an offense. I have not been suspended. I have been suspended by an unrighteous act, one that is motivated by anger and is without valid basis. Venerables, please take my side in accordance with the Dhamma and the Vinaya.” And that monk succeeded in getting well-known and esteemed monks in the countryside to take his side. Then those monks who supported the suspended monk approached the monks who had suspended him and said: “This is not an offense, friends. That monk has not committed an offense. That monk has not been suspended. He has been suspended by an unrighteous act, one that is motivated by anger and is without valid basis.” When they had spoken, the suspending monks said to them: “This is an offense, friends, not a non-offense. That monk has committed an offense. That monk has been suspended. He has been suspended by a righteous act, one that is not motivated by anger and has a valid basis. Venerables, do not side with that suspended monk or support him.” But even though they were spoken to thus by the suspending monks, those who sided with the suspended monk continued to side with him and support him.

452. Atha kho aññataro bhikkhu yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho so bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘idha, bhante, aññataro bhikkhu āpattiṃ āpanno ahosi. So tassā āpattiyā āpattidiṭṭhi ahosi, aññe bhikkhū tassā āpattiyā anāpattidiṭṭhino ahesuṃ. So aparena samayena tassā āpattiyā anāpattidiṭṭhi ahosi, aññe bhikkhū tassā āpattiyā āpattidiṭṭhino ahesuṃ. Atha kho te, bhante, bhikkhū taṃ bhikkhuṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘āpattiṃ tvaṃ, āvuso, āpanno, passasetaṃ āpatti’nti? ‘‘Natthi me, āvuso, āpatti yamahaṃ passeyya’’nti. Atha kho te, bhante, bhikkhū sāmaggiṃ labhitvā taṃ bhikkhuṃ āpattiyā adassane ukkhipiṃsu. So ca, bhante, bhikkhu bahussuto āgatāgamo dhammadharo vinayadharo mātikādharo paṇḍito byatto medhāvī lajjī kukkuccako sikkhākāmo. Atha kho so, bhante, bhikkhu sandiṭṭhe sambhatte bhikkhū upasaṅkamitvā etadavoca – ‘anāpatti esā, āvuso; nesā āpatti. Anāpannomhi, namhi āpanno. Anukkhittomhi, namhi ukkhitto.

452.Then a certain monk approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, that monk said to the Blessed One: “Here, Venerable Sir, a certain monk had committed an offense. He had the view that it was an offense, while other monks had the view that it was not an offense. Later, he came to have the view that it was not an offense, while other monks had the view that it was an offense. Then, Venerable Sir, those monks said to that monk: ‘Friend, you have committed an offense—acknowledge this offense.’ ‘I have no offense to acknowledge, friends.’ Then, Venerable Sir, those monks, having achieved unanimity, suspended that monk for not acknowledging the offense. But that monk, Venerable Sir, was learned, a master of the traditions, a Dhamma-bearer, a Vinaya-bearer, a Mātikā-bearer; he was wise, competent, intelligent, conscientious, scrupulous, and desirous of training. Then, Venerable Sir, that monk approached the monks who were well-known and esteemed and said: ‘This is not an offense, friends. I have not committed an offense. I have not been suspended. I have been suspended by an unrighteous act, one that is motivated by anger and is without valid basis. May the venerable ones be on my side according to the Dhamma and the Vinaya.’ That monk, Venerable Sir, obtained support from the monks who were well-known and esteemed. He also sent a messenger to the monks in the districts who were well-known and esteemed: ‘This is not an offense, friends. I have not committed an offense. I have not been suspended. I have been suspended by an unrighteous act, one that is motivated by anger and is without valid basis. May the venerable ones be on my side according to the Dhamma and the Vinaya.’ That monk, Venerable Sir, also obtained support from the monks in the districts who were well-known and esteemed. Then, Venerable Sir, the monks who sided with the suspended one approached the monks who had suspended him and said: ‘This is not an offense, friends. That monk has not committed an offense. That monk has not been suspended. He has been suspended by an unrighteous act, one that is motivated by anger and is without valid basis.’ When this was said, Venerable Sir, the suspending monks replied to the supporting monks: ‘This is an offense, friends, not a non-offense. That monk has committed an offense. That monk has been suspended. He has been suspended by a righteous act, one that is not motivated by anger and has a valid basis. Venerable ones, do not follow or associate with this suspended monk.’ Even though they were spoken to thus, Venerable Sir, the supporting monks continued to follow and associate with the suspended monk.”

453. Atha kho bhagavā ‘bhinno bhikkhusaṅgho, bhinno bhikkhusaṅgho’ti – uṭṭhāyāsanā yena ukkhepakā bhikkhū tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi, nisajja kho bhagavā ukkhepake bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘mā kho tumhe, bhikkhave, ‘paṭibhāti no, paṭibhāti no’ti yasmiṃ vā tasmiṃ vā bhikkhuṃ ukkhipitabbaṃ maññittha’’.

453.Then the Blessed One, hearing “The Sangha of monks is divided, the Sangha of monks is divided,” rose from his seat and went to where the suspending monks were. Having approached, he sat down on the prepared seat. Sitting there, the Blessed One addressed the suspending monks: “Monks, do not think, ‘It seems right to us, it seems right to us,’ and suspend any monk whomsoever.”

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu āpattiṃ āpanno hoti. So tassā āpattiyā anāpattidiṭṭhi hoti, aññe bhikkhū tassā āpattiyā āpattidiṭṭhino honti. Te ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhū taṃ bhikkhuṃ evaṃ jānanti – ‘ayaṃ kho āyasmā bahussuto āgatāgamo dhammadharo vinayadharo mātikādharo paṇḍito byatto medhāvī lajjī kukkuccako sikkhākāmo. Sace mayaṃ imaṃ bhikkhuṃ āpattiyā adassane ukkhipissāma, na mayaṃ iminā bhikkhunā saddhiṃ uposathaṃ karissāma, vinā iminā bhikkhunā uposathaṃ karissāma, bhavissati saṅghassa tatonidānaṃ bhaṇḍanaṃ kalaho viggaho vivādo saṅghabhedo saṅgharāji saṅghavavatthānaṃ saṅghanānākaraṇa’nti, bhedagarukehi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi na so bhikkhu āpattiyā adassane ukkhipitabbo.

Here, monks, a monk has committed an offense. He has the view that it is not an offense, while other monks have the view that it is an offense. If those monks know this monk to be learned, a master of the traditions, a Dhamma-bearer, a Vinaya-bearer, a Mātikā-bearer; wise, competent, intelligent, conscientious, scrupulous, and desirous of training, and think: ‘If we suspend this monk for not acknowledging the offense, we will not perform the Uposatha with this monk, we will perform the Uposatha without this monk, and because of that there will be disputes, quarrels, contentions, disagreements, schism in the Sangha, a split in the Sangha, a disruption of the Sangha, and a dividing of the Sangha’—then, monks, monks who take dissension seriously should not suspend that monk for not acknowledging the offense.

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu āpattiṃ āpanno hoti. So tassā āpattiyā anāpattidiṭṭhi hoti, aññe bhikkhū tassā āpattiyā āpattidiṭṭhino honti.

“Here, monks, a monk has committed an offense. He holds the view that it is not an offense, while other monks hold the view that it is an offense. If those monks know this monk to be—‘This venerable one is learned, a master of tradition, versed in the Dhamma, disciplined in the Vinaya, a holder of the outlines, wise, skilled, intelligent, conscientious, scrupulous, and desirous of training. If we suspend this monk for not acknowledging the offense, we will not perform the Pavāraṇā with him, but without him. We will not perform Saṅgha acts with him, but without him. We will not sit on the same seat with him, but without him. We will not sit together for rice gruel and drinks with him, but without him. We will not sit together in the refectory with him, but without him. We will not dwell under the same roof with him, but without him. We will not pay respects to him according to seniority—greeting, standing up for, saluting, or performing proper service—but without him. Because of that there will be quarrels, disputes, conflicts, arguments, schism in the Saṅgha, a crack in the Saṅgha, a splitting of the Saṅgha, and a division in the Saṅgha’—then, monks, monks who value concord should not suspend that monk for not acknowledging the offense.”

454. Atha kho bhagavā ukkhepakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etamatthaṃ bhāsitvā uṭṭhāyāsanā yena ukkhittānuvattakā bhikkhū tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi, nisajja kho bhagavā ukkhittānuvattake bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘mā kho tumhe, bhikkhave, āpattiṃ āpajjitvā ‘nāmha āpannā, nāmha āpannā’ti āpattiṃ na paṭikātabbaṃ maññittha’’.

454.Then the Blessed One, having spoken on this matter to the suspending monks, rose from his seat and approached the monks who were supporting those suspended. Having approached, he sat down on the prepared seat. Sitting there, the Blessed One addressed the monks who were supporting those suspended: “Monks, do not think that having committed an offense, by saying ‘We are not guilty, we are not guilty,’ you should not confess the offense.”

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu āpattiṃ āpanno hoti. So tassā āpattiyā anāpattidiṭṭhi hoti, aññe bhikkhū tassā āpattiyā āpattidiṭṭhino honti. So ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhu te bhikkhū evaṃ jānāti – ‘ime kho āyasmanto [āyasmantā (ka.)] bahussutā āgatāgamā dhammadharā vinayadharā mātikādharā paṇḍitā byattā medhāvino lajjino kukkuccakā sikkhākāmā, nālaṃ mamaṃ vā kāraṇā aññesaṃ vā kāraṇā chandā dosā mohā bhayā agatiṃ gantuṃ.

“Here, monks, a monk has committed an offense. He has the view that it is not an offense, while other monks have the view that it is an offense. If, monks, that monk knows of those monks: ‘These venerables are learned, versed in tradition, upholders of the Dhamma, upholders of the Vinaya, upholders of the Mātikā, wise, skilled, intelligent, conscientious, scrupulous, and desirous of training. They are not capable of acting improperly due to favoritism, hatred, delusion, or fear for my sake or for the sake of others. If these monks suspend me for not seeing the offense, they will not perform the Uposatha with me, they will perform the Uposatha without me, and because of that, there will be quarrels, disputes, conflicts, arguments, schism in the Saṅgha, a crack in the Saṅgha, a splitting of the Saṅgha, and a division in the Saṅgha’—then, monks, a monk who regards division as serious should confess that offense even out of faith in others.”

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu āpattiṃ āpanno hoti. So tassā āpattiyā anāpattidiṭṭhi hoti, aññe bhikkhū tassā āpattiyā āpattidiṭṭhino honti.

“Here, monks, a monk has committed an offense. He holds the view that it is not an offense, while other monks hold the view that it is an offense. If, monks, that monk knows of those monks: ‘These venerables are learned, versed in tradition, upholders of the Dhamma, upholders of the Vinaya, upholders of the Mātikā, wise, discerning, intelligent, conscientious, scrupulous, and desirous of training.

This will lead to disputes, quarrels, strife, arguments, schism in the Saṅgha, a crack in the Saṅgha, a splitting of the Saṅgha, and a division in the Saṅgha.’ Then, monks, a monk who values harmony should confess that offense out of faith in others.” Having spoken on this matter regarding the monks who support the suspended one, the Blessed One rose from his seat and departed.

455. Tena kho pana samayena ukkhittānuvattakā bhikkhū tattheva antosīmāya uposathaṃ karonti, saṅghakammaṃ karonti. Ukkhepakā pana bhikkhū nissīmaṃ gantvā uposathaṃ karonti, saṅghakammaṃ karonti.

455.Now at that time the monks who followed the suspended ones performed the Uposatha and Saṅgha acts right there within the boundary. But the suspending monks, having gone outside the boundary, performed the Uposatha and Saṅgha acts. Then a certain suspending monk approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, that monk said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, those monks who followed the suspended ones perform the Uposatha and Saṅgha acts right there within the boundary. But we, the suspending monks, having gone outside the boundary, perform the Uposatha and Saṅgha acts.” “If, monk, those monks who followed the suspended ones perform the Uposatha and Saṅgha acts right there within the boundary, in accordance with the motion and proclamation as prescribed by me, their acts will be lawful, irreversible, and fit to stand. If you, monk, the suspending monks, perform the Uposatha and Saṅgha acts right there within the boundary, in accordance with the motion and proclamation as prescribed by me, your acts too will be lawful, irreversible, and fit to stand. Why is that? These monks are not in communion with you, and you are not in communion with them.”

‘‘Dvemā, bhikkhu, nānāsaṃvāsakabhūmiyo – attanā vā attānaṃ nānāsaṃvāsakaṃ karoti, samaggo vā naṃ saṅgho ukkhipati adassane vā appaṭikamme vā appaṭinissagge vā.

“Monk, there are these two grounds for separation—either one makes oneself separate, or the Saṅgha, in harmony, expels one for not acknowledging an offense, not making amends for an offense, or not relinquishing. These, monk, are the two grounds for separation. Monk, there are these two grounds for communion—either one makes oneself have communion, or the Saṅgha, in harmony, reinstates one who was expelled for not acknowledging an offense, not making amends for an offense, or not relinquishing. These, monk, are the two grounds for communion.”

456.Now at that time monks in the refectory within houses were quarreling, disputing, and arguing, displaying inappropriate bodily and verbal actions to each other, even resorting to grabbing each other. People complained, criticized, and spread it about: “How can these Sakyan ascetics quarrel, dispute, and argue in the refectory within houses, displaying inappropriate bodily and verbal actions to each other, even resorting to grabbing each other?” The monks heard those people complaining, criticizing, and spreading it about. Those monks who were modest complained, criticized, and spread it about: “How can these monks quarrel, dispute, and argue in the refectory within houses, displaying inappropriate bodily and verbal actions to each other, even resorting to grabbing each other?” Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One… “Is it true, monks, that monks are quarreling… even resorting to grabbing each other?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Buddha rebuked them… After rebuking them, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Monks, when the Saṅgha is divided, when there is unrighteous behavior and disharmony, one should sit down on a seat thinking, ‘At least we will not display inappropriate bodily and verbal actions to each other, nor resort to grabbing each other.’ Monks, when the Saṅgha is divided, but there is righteous behavior and harmony, one should sit down leaving a space between seats.”

457.Now at that time, monks were quarreling, disputing, and engaged in contention in the midst of the Saṅgha, wounding each other with verbal darts. They were unable to settle that issue. Then a certain monk approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, that monk said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, monks here are quarreling, disputing, and engaged in contention in the midst of the Saṅgha, wounding each other with verbal darts. They are unable to settle that issue. It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would approach those monks out of compassion.” The Blessed One consented by silence. Then the Blessed One approached those monks, sat down on the prepared seat, and said to them: “Enough, monks! Do not quarrel, do not dispute, do not contend, do not strive!” When this was said, a certain monk who spoke contrary to the Dhamma said to the Blessed One: “Let the Blessed One, the Master of the Dhamma, wait; let the Blessed One dwell at ease, devoted to pleasant abiding in the present life. We will become known through this quarreling, disputing, contention, and strife!” A second time, the Blessed One said to those monks: “Enough, monks! Do not quarrel, do not dispute, do not contend, do not strive!” A second time, that monk who spoke contrary to the Dhamma said to the Blessed One: “Let the Blessed One, the Master of the Dhamma, wait; let the Blessed One dwell at ease, devoted to pleasant abiding in the present life. We will become known through this quarreling, disputing, contention, and strife!”

272.The Story of Dīghāvu

458. Atha kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘bhūtapubbaṃ, bhikkhave, bārāṇasiyaṃ [vajirabuddhiṭīkā oloketabbā] brahmadatto nāma kāsirājā ahosi aḍḍho mahaddhano mahābhogo mahabbalo mahāvāhano mahāvijito paripuṇṇakosakoṭṭhāgāro. Dīghīti nāma kosalarājā ahosi daliddo appadhano appabhogo appabalo appavāhano appavijito aparipuṇṇakosakoṭṭhāgāro. Atha kho, bhikkhave, brahmadatto kāsirājā caturaṅginiṃ senaṃ sannayhitvā dīghītiṃ kosalarājānaṃ abbhuyyāsi. Assosi kho, bhikkhave, dīghīti kosalarājā – ‘‘brahmadatto kira kāsirājā caturaṅginiṃ senaṃ sannayhitvā mamaṃ abbhuyyāto’’ti. Atha kho, bhikkhave, dīghītissa kosalarañño etadahosi – ‘‘brahmadatto kho kāsirājā aḍḍho mahaddhano mahābhogo mahabbalo mahāvāhano mahāvijito paripuṇṇakosakoṭṭhāgāro, ahaṃ panamhi daliddo appadhano appabhogo appabalo appavāhano appavijito aparipuṇṇakosakoṭṭhāgāro, nāhaṃ paṭibalo brahmadattena kāsiraññā ekasaṅghātampi sahituṃ. Yaṃnūnāhaṃ paṭikacceva nagaramhā nippateyya’’nti.

458.Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Once upon a time, monks, in Bārāṇasī there was a king named Brahmadatta, the king of Kāsī, rich, wealthy, with vast possessions, great strength, many vehicles, greatly victorious, with well-stocked storehouses and treasuries. There was also a king named Dīghīti, the king of Kosala, poor, with few possessions, little strength, few vehicles, little victorious, with poorly stocked storehouses and treasuries. Then, monks, King Brahmadatta of Kāsī, having arrayed a fourfold army, marched against King Dīghīti of Kosala. King Dīghīti of Kosala heard, monks: ‘King Brahmadatta of Kāsī, having arrayed a fourfold army, is marching against me.’ Then, monks, King Dīghīti of Kosala had this thought: ‘King Brahmadatta of Kāsī is rich, wealthy, with vast possessions, great strength, many vehicles, greatly victorious, with well-stocked storehouses and treasuries, but I am poor, with few possessions, little strength, few vehicles, little victorious, with poorly stocked storehouses and treasuries. I am not able to withstand King Brahmadatta of Kāsī even in a single encounter. Why don’t I leave the city in advance?’”

Atha kho, bhikkhave, dīghīti kosalarājā mahesiṃ ādāya paṭikacceva nagaramhā nippati. Atha kho, bhikkhave, brahmadatto kāsirājā dīghītissa kosalarañño balañca vāhanañca janapadañca kosañca koṭṭhāgārañca abhivijiya ajjhāvasati. Atha kho, bhikkhave, dīghīti kosalarājā sapajāpatiko yena vārāṇasī tena pakkāmi. Anupubbena yena bārāṇasī tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ, bhikkhave, dīghīti kosalarājā sapajāpatiko bārāṇasiyaṃ aññatarasmiṃ paccantime okāse kumbhakāranivesane aññātakavesena paribbājakacchannena paṭivasati. Atha kho, bhikkhave, dīghītissa kosalarañño mahesī nacirasseva gabbhinī ahosi. Tassā evarūpo dohaḷo uppanno hoti – ‘‘icchati sūriyassa uggamanakāle caturaṅginiṃ senaṃ sannaddhaṃ vammikaṃ subhūme ṭhitaṃ passituṃ, khaggānañca dhovanaṃ pātuṃ’’. Atha kho, bhikkhave, dīghītissa kosalarañño mahesī dīghītiṃ kosalarājānaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘gabbhinīmhi, deva. Tassā me evarūpo dohaḷo uppanno – icchāmi sūriyassa uggamanakāle caturaṅginiṃ senaṃ sannaddhaṃ vammikaṃ [vammitaṃ (sī.)] subhūme ṭhitaṃ passituṃ, khaggānañca dhovanaṃ pātu’’nti. ‘‘Kuto, devi, amhākaṃ duggatānaṃ caturaṅginī senā sannaddhā vammikā subhūme ṭhitā, khaggānañca dhovanaṃ pātu’’nti [khaggānañca dhovananti (sī. syā.)] ‘‘sacāhaṃ, deva, na labhissāmi, marissāmī’’ti.

Then, monks, King Dīghīti of Kosala, taking his chief queen, fled from the city in haste. Then, monks, King Brahmadatta of Kāsī, having conquered King Dīghīti of Kosala’s army, vehicles, country, treasury, and storehouse, took up residence there. Then, monks, King Dīghīti of Kosala, together with his chief queen, set out for Bārāṇasī. Gradually, he arrived at Bārāṇasī. There, monks, King Dīghīti of Kosala, together with his chief queen, lived in disguise as unknown wanderers in a potter’s dwelling in a certain outlying area of Bārāṇasī. Then, monks, not long after, the chief queen of King Dīghīti of Kosala became pregnant. A craving of this kind arose in her: “I want to see, at sunrise, a fourfold army arrayed in armor, standing on good ground like an anthill, and to drink the water used to wash swords.” Then, monks, the chief queen of King Dīghīti of Kosala said to King Dīghīti of Kosala: “I am pregnant, lord. A craving has arisen in me: I want to see, at sunrise, a fourfold army arrayed in armor, standing on good ground like an anthill, and to drink the water used to wash swords.” “From where, queen, would we, who are so wretched, obtain a fourfold army arrayed in armor, standing on good ground like an anthill, and the water used to wash swords?” “If I do not get it, lord, I will die.”

459. Tena kho pana samayena, brahmadattassa kāsirañño purohito brāhmaṇo dīghītissa kosalarañño sahāyo hoti. Atha kho, bhikkhave, dīghīti kosalarājā yena brahmadattassa kāsirañño purohito brāhmaṇo tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā brahmadattassa kāsirañño purohitaṃ brāhmaṇaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sakhī te, samma, gabbhinī. Tassā evarūpo dohaḷo uppanno – icchati sūriyassa uggamanakāle caturaṅginiṃ senaṃ sannaddhaṃ vammikaṃ subhūme ṭhitaṃ passituṃ, khaggānañca dhovanaṃ pātu’’nti. ‘‘Tena hi, deva, mayampi deviṃ passāmā’’ti. Atha kho, bhikkhave, dīghītissa kosalarañño mahesī yena brahmadattassa kāsirañño purohito brāhmaṇo tenupasaṅkami. Addasā kho, bhikkhave, brahmadattassa kāsirañño purohito brāhmaṇo dīghītissa kosalarañño mahesiṃ dūratova āgacchantiṃ, disvāna uṭṭhāyāsanā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā yena dīghītissa kosalarañño mahesī tenañjaliṃ paṇāmetvā tikkhattuṃ udānaṃ udānesi – ‘‘kosalarājā vata bho kucchigato, kosalarājā vata bho kucchigato’’ti. Attamanā [avimanā (sī. syā. katthaci], devi, hohi. Lacchasi sūriyassa uggamanakāle caturaṅginiṃ senaṃ sannaddhaṃ vammikaṃ subhūme ṭhitaṃ passituṃ, khaggānañca dhovanaṃ pātunti.

459.Now at that time, the brahmin chaplain of King Brahmadatta of Kāsī was a friend of King Dīghīti of Kosala. Then, monks, King Dīghīti of Kosala approached the brahmin chaplain of King Brahmadatta of Kāsī and said to him: “Friend, your female friend is pregnant. A craving of this kind has arisen in her: she wishes to see at sunrise a fourfold army arrayed in armor, standing on good ground like an anthill, and to drink the water used to wash swords.” “Well then, sire, let us also see the queen.” Then, monks, the chief queen of King Dīghīti of Kosala approached the brahmin chaplain of King Brahmadatta of Kāsī. The brahmin chaplain of King Brahmadatta of Kāsī saw the chief queen of King Dīghīti of Kosala coming from afar, and rising from his seat, arranging his upper robe over one shoulder, he extended his joined hands in reverential salutation towards the chief queen of King Dīghīti of Kosala and exclaimed three times: “The king of Kosala is indeed in your womb! The king of Kosala is indeed in your womb!” “Be happy, queen. You will get to see at sunrise a fourfold army arrayed in armor, standing on good ground like an anthill, and to drink the water used to wash swords.”

Atha kho, bhikkhave, brahmadattassa kāsirañño purohito brāhmaṇo yena brahmadatto kāsirājā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā brahmadattaṃ kāsirājānaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘tathā, deva, nimittāni dissanti, sve sūriyuggamanakāle caturaṅginī senā sannaddhā vammikā subhūme tiṭṭhatu, khaggā ca dhoviyantū’’ti. Atha kho, bhikkhave, brahmadatto kāsirājā manusse āṇāpesi – ‘‘yathā, bhaṇe, purohito brāhmaṇo āha tathā karothā’’ti. Alabhi kho, bhikkhave, dīghītissa kosalarañño mahesī sūriyassa uggamanakāle caturaṅginiṃ senaṃ sannaddhaṃ vammikaṃ subhūme ṭhitaṃ passituṃ, khaggānañca dhovanaṃ pātuṃ. Atha kho, bhikkhave, dīghītissa kosalarañño mahesī tassa gabbhassa paripākamanvāya puttaṃ vijāyi. Tassa dīghāvūti nāmaṃ akaṃsu. Atha kho, bhikkhave, dīghāvu kumāro nacirasseva viññutaṃ pāpuṇi. Atha kho, bhikkhave, dīghītissa kosalarañño etadahosi – ‘‘ayaṃ kho brahmadatto kāsirājā bahuno amhākaṃ anatthassa kārako, iminā amhākaṃ balañca vāhanañca janapado ca koso ca koṭṭhāgārañca acchinnaṃ, sacāyaṃ amhe jānissati, sabbeva tayo ghātāpessati, yaṃnūnāhaṃ dīghāvuṃ kumāraṃ bahinagare vāseyya’’nti. Atha kho bhikkhave dīghīti kosalarājā dīghāvuṃ kumāraṃ bahinagare vāsesi. Atha kho bhikkhave dīghāvu kumāro bahinagare paṭivasanto nacirasseva sabbasippāni sikkhi.

Then, monks, the brahmin chaplain of King Brahmadatta of Kāsī approached King Brahmadatta and said: “Indeed, sire, signs are appearing. At sunrise tomorrow, let the fourfold army stand ready in armor on good ground like an anthill, and let the swords be washed.” Then, monks, King Brahmadatta of Kāsī commanded his men: “Do as the brahmin chaplain instructs.” Now, monks, the chief queen of King Dīghīti of Kosala happened to see at sunrise the fourfold army standing ready in armor on good ground like an anthill and the washing of the swords. Then, monks, the chief queen of King Dīghīti of Kosala gave birth to a son when the time of her pregnancy was complete. They named him Dīghāvu. Soon, monks, young Dīghāvu reached understanding. Then, monks, King Dīghīti of Kosala thought: “This King Brahmadatta of Kāsī has caused us much harm. He has seized our army, vehicles, territory, treasury, and storehouses. If he finds out about me, he will have all three of us killed. Let me send Prince Dīghāvu to live outside the city.” So, monks, King Dīghīti sent Prince Dīghāvu to live outside the city. While living outside the city, monks, young Dīghāvu soon mastered all the arts.

460. Tena kho pana samayena dīghītissa kosalarañño kappako brahmadatte kāsiraññe paṭivasati. Addasā kho, bhikkhave, dīghītissa kosalarañño kappako dīghītiṃ kosalarājānaṃ sapajāpatikaṃ bārāṇasiyaṃ aññatarasmiṃ paccantime okāse kumbhakāranivesane aññātakavesena paribbājakacchannena paṭivasantaṃ, disvāna yena brahmadatto kāsirājā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā brahmadattaṃ kāsirājānaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘dīghīti, deva, kosalarājā sapajāpatiko bārāṇasiyaṃ aññatarasmiṃ paccantime okāse kumbhakāranivesane aññātakavesena paribbājakacchannena paṭivasatī’’ti. Atha kho, bhikkhave, brahmadatto kāsirājā manusse āṇāpesi – ‘‘tena hi, bhaṇe, dīghītiṃ kosalarājānaṃ sapajāpatikaṃ ānethā’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, devā’’ti kho, bhikkhave, te manussā brahmadattassa kāsirañño paṭissutvā dīghītiṃ kosalarājānaṃ sapajāpatikaṃ ānesuṃ. Atha kho, bhikkhave, brahmadatto kāsirājā manusse āṇāpesi – ‘‘tena hi, bhaṇe, dīghītiṃ kosalarājānaṃ sapajāpatikaṃ daḷhāya rajjuyā pacchābāhaṃ gāḷhabandhanaṃ bandhitvā khuramuṇḍaṃ karitvā kharassarena paṇavena rathikāya rathikaṃ siṅghāṭakena siṅghāṭakaṃ parinetvā dakkhiṇena dvārena nikkhāmetvā dakkhiṇato nagarassa catudhā chinditvā catuddisā bilāni nikkhipathā’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, devā’’ti kho, bhikkhave, te manussā brahmadattassa kāsirañño paṭissutvā dīghītiṃ kosalarājānaṃ sapajāpatikaṃ daḷhāya rajjuyā pacchābāhaṃ gāḷhabandhanaṃ bandhitvā khuramuṇḍaṃ karitvā kharassarena paṇavena rathikāya rathikaṃ siṅghāṭakena siṅghāṭakaṃ parinenti.

460.Now at that time, the barber of King Dīghīti of Kosala was dwelling in Kāsi, the realm of King Brahmadatta. The barber, monks, saw King Dīghīti of Kosala together with his queen consort dwelling incognito in a potter’s dwelling in a certain remote place in Bārāṇasī, disguised as wandering ascetics. Having seen them, he approached King Brahmadatta of Kāsi and said: "Your Majesty, King Dīghīti of Kosala together with his queen consort is dwelling incognito in a potter’s dwelling in a certain remote place in Bārāṇasī, disguised as wandering ascetics." Then, monks, King Brahmadatta of Kāsi ordered his men: "Well then, men, bring King Dīghīti of Kosala together with his queen consort here." "Yes, Your Majesty," replied those men to King Brahmadatta of Kāsi, and they brought King Dīghīti of Kosala together with his queen consort. Then, monks, King Brahmadatta of Kāsi ordered his men: "Well then, men, bind King Dīghīti of Kosala together with his queen consort firmly with a strong rope, their hands behind their backs, shave their heads, and lead them around from street to street, from crossroads to crossroads, with a harsh drumbeat. Then take them out through the southern gate and, outside the city to the south, cut them into four pieces and throw the pieces into holes in the four directions." "Yes, Your Majesty," replied those men to King Brahmadatta of Kāsi, and they bound King Dīghīti of Kosala together with his queen consort firmly with a strong rope, their hands behind their backs, shaved their heads, and led them around from street to street, from crossroads to crossroads, with a harsh drumbeat.

Atha kho, bhikkhave, dīghāvussa kumārassa etadahosi – ‘‘ciraṃdiṭṭhā kho me mātāpitaro. Yaṃnūnāhaṃ mātāpitaro passeyya’’nti. Atha kho, bhikkhave, dīghāvu kumāro bārāṇasiṃ pavisitvā addasa mātāpitaro daḷhāya rajjuyā pacchābāhaṃ gāḷhabandhanaṃ bandhitvā khuramuṇḍaṃ karitvā kharassarena paṇavena rathikāya rathikaṃ siṅghāṭakena siṅghāṭakaṃ parinente, disvāna yena mātāpitaro tenupasaṅkami. Addasā kho, bhikkhave, dīghīti kosalarājā dīghāvuṃ kumāraṃ dūratova āgacchantaṃ; disvāna dīghāvuṃ kumāraṃ etadavoca – ‘‘mā kho tvaṃ, tāta dīghāvu, dīghaṃ passa, mā rassaṃ.

Then, monks, Prince Dīghāvu thought: "It has been a long time since I saw my parents. Why don’t I go see my parents?" Then, monks, Prince Dīghāvu entered Bārāṇasī and saw his parents bound firmly with a strong rope, their hands behind their backs, their heads shaved, being led through street after street, from crossroads to crossroads, with a harsh drumbeat. Seeing them, he approached his parents. King Dīghīti of Kosala, monks, saw Prince Dīghāvu coming from afar. Seeing him, he said to Prince Dīghāvu: "Do not, dear Dīghāvu, look long, do not look short. For, dear Dīghāvu, enmities are never appeased by enmity; by non-enmity are enmities appeased." When this was said, monks, those people said to King Dīghīti of Kosala: "This King Dīghīti of Kosala is raving and babbling. Who is this Dīghāvu? To whom does he say, 'Do not, dear Dīghāvu, look long, do not look short. For, dear Dīghāvu, enmities are never appeased by enmity; by non-enmity are enmities appeased'?" "I am not raving and babbling, friends. But whoever is discerning will understand." A second time, monks... A third time, monks, King Dīghīti of Kosala said to Prince Dīghāvu: "Do not, dear Dīghāvu, look long, do not look short. For, dear Dīghāvu, enmities are never appeased by enmity; by non-enmity are enmities appeased." A third time, monks, those people said to King Dīghīti of Kosala: "This King Dīghīti of Kosala is raving and babbling. Who is this Dīghāvu? To whom does he say, 'Do not, dear Dīghāvu, look long, do not look short. For, dear Dīghāvu, enmities are never appeased by enmity; by non-enmity are enmities appeased'?" "I am not raving and babbling, friends. But whoever is discerning will understand." Then, monks, those people led King Dīghīti of Kosala along with his queen through street after street, from crossroads to crossroads, and expelled them through the southern gate. They cut them into four pieces outside the city to the south, placed the pieces in holes in the four directions, and left after setting up a guard. Then, monks, Prince Dīghāvu entered Bārāṇasī, brought out liquor, and gave it to the guards. When they became intoxicated and fell down, he gathered wood, built a pyre, placed his parents’ bodies on the pyre, lit the fire, and with hands reverently joined, circumambulated the pyre three times.

461.At that time, King Brahmadatta of Kāsi was on the upper floor of his palace. King Brahmadatta saw Prince Dīghāvu with hands clasped, circumambulating the funeral pyre three times. Upon seeing this, he thought: "Surely this man is a relative or blood kin of King Dīghīti of Kosala. Alas, this is a misfortune for me—surely no one will inform me!" Then, Prince Dīghāvu went into the forest, wept and lamented as much as he needed to, wiped his tears, and entered Bārāṇasī. He approached the elephant stables near the royal palace and said to the elephant trainer: "Teacher, I wish to learn a skill." The trainer replied: "Very well, young man, you may learn." Then, Prince Dīghāvu, in the early hours of the night, would rise in the elephant stables and sing in a melodious voice, and play the lute. King Brahmadatta heard the sweet singing and lute playing in the elephant stables in the early hours of the night. He asked his attendants: "Who is singing and playing the lute so sweetly in the elephant stables at this early hour?" They replied: "Your Majesty, it is a young apprentice of the elephant trainer who sings in a melodious voice and plays the lute in the elephant stables in the early hours of the night." The king said: "Then bring that young man to me." The attendants obeyed and brought Prince Dīghāvu to the king. The king asked: "Young man, were you the one singing and playing the lute so sweetly in the elephant stables in the early hours of the night?" "Yes, Your Majesty," he replied. "Then sing and play for me," said the king. "Very well, Your Majesty," said Prince Dīghāvu, and seeking to please him, he sang sweetly and played the lute. The king said: "Young man, you shall attend to me." "As you wish, Your Majesty," replied Prince Dīghāvu. Thereafter, Prince Dīghāvu became King Brahmadatta’s early riser, late to bed, doing what he was told, behaving agreeably, and speaking kindly. Before long, King Brahmadatta placed Prince Dīghāvu in a position of innermost trust.

462.Then, bhikkhus, Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi, said to Prince Dīghāvu: “Well then, young man, harness the chariot; we will go hunting.” “Yes, Your Majesty,” Prince Dīghāvu replied to Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi. Having harnessed the chariot, he said to Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi: “Your chariot is harnessed, Your Majesty; now is the time as you see fit.” Then, bhikkhus, Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi, mounted the chariot. Prince Dīghāvu drove the chariot. He drove it in such a way that the army went one way and the chariot another. After traveling a distance, Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi, said to Prince Dīghāvu: “Well then, young man, unharness the chariot; I am tired; I will lie down.” “Yes, Your Majesty,” Prince Dīghāvu replied to Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi. Having unharnessed the chariot, he sat cross-legged on the ground. Then, bhikkhus, Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi, laid his head on Prince Dīghāvu’s lap and lay down. Being tired, sleep overcame him in a moment. Then, bhikkhus, this thought occurred to Prince Dīghāvu: “This Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi, has caused us much misfortune. By him, our army and vehicles, our country, our treasury, and our storehouses have been seized. By him, my parents were killed. Now is the time for me to exact revenge.” He drew his sword from its scabbard. Then, bhikkhus, this thought occurred to Prince Dīghāvu: “My father, at the time of his death, said to me: ‘Do not, dear Dīghāvu, look at the long; do not look at the short. For, dear Dīghāvu, enmities are never settled by enmity; enmities are settled by non-enmity.’ It would not be proper for me to transgress my father’s words.” He sheathed his sword. A second time, bhikkhus, this thought occurred to Prince Dīghāvu: “This Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi, has caused us much misfortune. By him, our army and vehicles, our country, our treasury, and our storehouses have been seized. By him, my parents were killed. Now is the time for me to exact revenge.” He drew his sword from its scabbard. A second time, bhikkhus, this thought occurred to Prince Dīghāvu: “My father, at the time of his death, said to me: ‘Do not, dear Dīghāvu, look at the long; do not look at the short. For, dear Dīghāvu, enmities are never settled by enmity; enmities are settled by non-enmity.’ It would not be proper for me to transgress my father’s words.” He sheathed his sword again. A third time, bhikkhus, this thought occurred to Prince Dīghāvu: “This Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi, has caused us much misfortune. By him, our army and vehicles, our country, our treasury, and our storehouses have been seized. By him, my parents were killed. Now is the time for me to exact revenge.” He drew his sword from its scabbard. A third time, bhikkhus, this thought occurred to Prince Dīghāvu: “My father, at the time of his death, said to me: ‘Do not, dear Dīghāvu, look at the long; do not look at the short. For, dear Dīghāvu, enmities are never settled by enmity; enmities are settled by non-enmity.’ It would not be proper for me to transgress my father’s words.” He sheathed his sword again. Then, bhikkhus, Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi, frightened, agitated, apprehensive, and terrified, suddenly arose. Then, bhikkhus, Prince Dīghāvu said to Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi: “Why, Your Majesty, are you frightened, agitated, apprehensive, and suddenly arisen?” “Just now, young man, Prince Dīghāvu, the son of King Dīghīti of Kosala, struck me down with a sword in a dream. That is why I am frightened, agitated, apprehensive, and suddenly arisen.” Then, bhikkhus, Prince Dīghāvu, grasping Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi’s head with his left hand and drawing his sword with his right hand, said to Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi: “I, Your Majesty, am that Prince Dīghāvu, the son of King Dīghīti of Kosala. You have caused us much misfortune. By you, our army and vehicles, our country, our treasury, and our storehouses have been seized. By you, my parents were killed. Now is the time for me to exact revenge.” Then, bhikkhus, Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi, fell with his head at Prince Dīghāvu’s feet and said to Prince Dīghāvu: “Grant me my life, dear Dīghāvu! Grant me my life, dear Dīghāvu!” “How can I presume to grant Your Majesty life? It is Your Majesty who should grant me life.” “Well then, dear Dīghāvu, you grant me life, and I will grant you life.” Then, bhikkhus, Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi, and Prince Dīghāvu granted each other their lives, took each other by the hand, and swore an oath of non-deception.

Atha kho, bhikkhave, brahmadatto kāsirājā dīghāvuṃ kumāraṃ etadavoca – ‘‘tena hi, tāta dīghāvu, rathaṃ yojehi, gamissāmā’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, devā’’ti kho, bhikkhave, dīghāvu kumāro brahmadattassa kāsirañño paṭissutvā rathaṃ yojetvā brahmadattaṃ kāsirājānaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘yutto kho te, deva, ratho, yassa dāni kālaṃ maññasī’’ti.

Then, bhikkhus, Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi, said to Prince Dīghāvu: “Well then, dear Dīghāvu, harness the chariot; we will go.” “Yes, Your Majesty,” Prince Dīghāvu replied to Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi. Having harnessed the chariot, he said to Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi: “Your chariot is harnessed, Your Majesty; now is the time as you see fit.” Then, bhikkhus, Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi, mounted the chariot. Prince Dīghāvu drove the chariot. He drove it in such a way that before long they met with the army. Then, bhikkhus, Brahmadatta, the King of Kāsi, entered Bārāṇasī, assembled his ministers and courtiers, and said: “If, good sirs, you were to see Prince Dīghāvu, the son of King Dīghīti of Kosala, what would you do to him?” Some said: “We would cut off his hands, Your Majesty.” Some said: “We would cut off his feet, Your Majesty.” Some said: “We would cut off his hands and feet, Your Majesty.” Some said: “We would cut off his ears, Your Majesty.” Some said: “We would cut off his nose, Your Majesty.” Some said: “We would cut off his ears and nose, Your Majesty.” Some said: “We would cut off his head, Your Majesty.” [Brahmadatta replied:] “This, good sirs, is Prince Dīghāvu, the son of King Dīghīti of Kosala. Nothing can be done to him. He gave me life, and I gave him life.”

463. Atha kho, bhikkhave, brahmadatto kāsirājā dīghāvuṃ kumāraṃ etadavoca – ‘‘yaṃ kho te, tāta dīghāvu, pitā maraṇakāle avaca ‘mā kho tvaṃ, tāta dīghāvu, dīghaṃ passa, mā rassaṃ.

463.Then, monks, King Brahmadatta of Kasi said to Prince Dighavu: "Dear Dighavu, what did your father mean when he said to you at the time of his death: 'Do not, dear Dighavu, look at the long, nor the short. For, dear Dighavu, enmity is not appeased by enmity; enmity is appeased by non-enmity'?" "Great king, when my father said at the time of his death 'do not look at the long,' he meant: 'Do not harbor enmity for long.' This, great king, is what my father meant by 'do not look at the long.' When my father said at the time of his death 'do not look at the short,' he meant: 'Do not quickly break with friends.' This, great king, is what my father meant by 'do not look at the short.' When my father said at the time of his death: 'For, dear Dighavu, enmity is not appeased by enmity; enmity is appeased by non-enmity,' he meant: 'Great king, you have killed my parents. If I were to deprive you of life, then those who wish you well would deprive me of life, and those who wish me well would deprive them of life. Thus, enmity would not be appeased by enmity. But now, great king, you have granted me life, and I have granted you life. Thus, enmity is appeased by non-enmity.' This, great king, is what my father meant when he said: 'For, dear Dighavu, enmity is not appeased by enmity; enmity is appeased by non-enmity.'" Then, monks, King Brahmadatta of Kasi exclaimed: "Wonderful, indeed! Astonishing, indeed! How wise is this Prince Dighavu, that he can understand in detail the meaning of his father's brief words!" And he restored his father's army, vehicles, realm, treasury, and granary, and gave him his daughter in marriage. "Monks, even for kings who have taken up the rod and the sword, such patience and gentleness can arise. But here, monks, how much more should it shine forth for you who have gone forth in this well-proclaimed Dhamma and Discipline, that you should be patient and gentle?" A third time the Blessed One addressed those monks: "Enough, monks, no quarreling, no contention, no dispute, no strife." A third time that monk who spoke against the Dhamma said to the Blessed One: "Enough, venerable sir, let the Blessed One, the Lord of the Dhamma, remain at ease, devoted to pleasant abiding in the present life. We will be known by this quarreling, contention, dispute, and strife." Then the Blessed One thought: "These misguided men are incorrigible; it is not easy to persuade them." And rising from his seat, he departed.

Dīghāvubhāṇavāro niṭṭhito paṭhamo.

The first recitation section on the Long-lived (Dīghāvu) is completed.

464. [ma. ni. 3.236] Atha kho bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya kosambiṃ piṇḍāya pāvisi. Kosambiyaṃ piṇḍāya caritvā pacchābhattaṃ piṇḍapātapaṭikkanto senāsanaṃ saṃsāmetvā pattacīvaramādāya saṅghamajjhe ṭhitakova imā gāthāyo abhāsi –

464.Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Kosambī for alms. Having wandered for alms in Kosambī, after the meal, on returning from the alms round, having put his lodging in order, he took his bowl and robe, and standing in the midst of the Sangha, spoke these verses:

[ma. ni. 3.237] ‘‘Puthusaddo samajano, na bālo koci maññatha;Saṅghasmiṃ bhijjamānasmiṃ, nāññaṃ bhiyyo amaññaruṃ.

The crowd is noisy, a uniform mass, and no one considers themselves a fool; when the Sangha was breaking apart, they did not consider anything else further.

[ma. ni. 3.237] ‘‘Parimuṭṭhā paṇḍitābhāsā, vācāgocarabhāṇino;Yāvicchanti mukhāyāmaṃ, yena nītā na taṃ vidū.

Bewildered, though appearing wise, they are speakers whose range is speech; they speak with unrestrained mouths, not knowing where they have been led.

[ma. ni. 3.237] ‘‘Akkocchi maṃ avadhi maṃ, ajini maṃ ahāsi me;Ye ca taṃ upanayhanti, veraṃ tesaṃ na sammati.

"He abused me, he struck me, he overcame me, he robbed me." Those who harbor such thoughts will never still their hatred.

[ma. ni. 3.237] ‘‘Akkocchi maṃ avadhi maṃ, ajini maṃ ahāsi me;Ye ca taṃ nupanayhanti, veraṃ tesūpasammati.

"He insulted me, he struck me, he defeated me, he robbed me." Those who do not harbor such thoughts will find enmity subside.

[ma. ni. 3.237] ‘‘Na hi verena verāni, sammantīdha kudācanaṃ;Averena ca sammanti, esadhammo sanantano.

For hatred is never appeased by hatred in this world; it is appeased by non-hatred. This is an eternal law.

[ma. ni. 3.237] ‘‘Pare ca na vijānanti, mayamettha yamāmase;Ye ca tattha vijānanti, tato sammanti medhagā.

Others do not realize, 'We are perishing here.' But those who understand this, thereupon their quarrels subside.

[ma. ni. 3.237] ‘‘Aṭṭhicchinnā pāṇaharā, gavāssadhanahārino;Raṭṭhaṃ vilumpamānānaṃ, tesampi hoti saṅgati.

Those who break bones, take life, steal cattle and horses, plunder kingdoms—even they have reconciliation. Why not you?

‘‘Kasmā tumhāka no siyā;[ma. ni. 3.237] ‘‘Sace labhetha nipakaṃ sahāyaṃ;Saddhiṃcaraṃ sādhuvihāri dhīraṃ;Abhibhuyya sabbāni parissayāni;Careyya tenattamano satīmā.

If one finds a prudent companion, a fellow traveler, virtuous and wise, overcoming all dangers, one should wander with them, joyful and mindful.

[ma. ni. 3.237] ‘‘No ce labhetha nipakaṃ sahāyaṃ;Saddhiṃ caraṃ sādhuvihāri dhīraṃ;Rājāva raṭṭhaṃ vijitaṃ pahāya;Eko care mātaṅgaraññeva nāgo.

If one obtains no intelligent companion, no fellow traveler who lives righteously and is wise, one should wander alone like a king giving up his conquered kingdom, like the elephant roaming in the Mātaṅga forest.

[ma. ni. 3.237] ‘‘Ekassa caritaṃ seyyo;Natthi bāle sahāyatā;Eko care na ca pāpāni kayirā;Appossukko mātaṅgaraññeva nāgo’’ti.

Better to wander alone; there is no companionship with a fool. Wander alone, doing no evil, carefree, like an elephant in the Matanga forest.

273.The Account of the Journey to Bālakaloṇaka

465. Atha kho bhagavā saṅghamajjhe ṭhitakova imā gāthāyo bhāsitvā yena bālakaloṇakagāmo [bālakaloṇakāragāmo (sī. syā.)] tenupasaṅkami. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā bhagu bālakaloṇakagāme viharati. Addasā kho āyasmā bhagu bhagavantaṃ dūratova āgacchantaṃ, disvāna āsanaṃ paññapesi, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipi, paccuggantvā pattacīvaraṃ paṭiggahesi. Nisīdi bhagavā paññatte āsane, nisajja kho bhagavā pāde pakkhālesi. Āyasmāpi kho bhagu bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho āyasmantaṃ bhaguṃ bhagavā etadavoca – ‘‘kacci, bhikkhu, khamanīyaṃ; kacci yāpanīyaṃ, kacci piṇḍakena na kilamasī’’ti? ‘‘Khamanīyaṃ, bhagavā, yāpanīyaṃ, bhagavā; na cāhaṃ, bhante, piṇḍakena kilamāmī’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā āyasmantaṃ bhaguṃ dhammiyā kathāya sandassetvā samādapetvā samuttejetvā sampahaṃsetvā uṭṭhāyāsanā yena pācīnavaṃsadāyo tenupasaṅkami.

465.Then the Blessed One, standing in the midst of the Saṅgha, having spoken these verses, approached the village of Bālakaloṇaka. Now at that time the Venerable Bhagu was dwelling in the village of Bālakaloṇaka. The Venerable Bhagu saw the Blessed One coming from afar. When he saw him, he prepared a seat, set out water for the feet, a footstool, and a foot-towel, and went forth to receive his bowl and robe. The Blessed One sat down on the prepared seat, and having sat down, he washed his feet. Then the Venerable Bhagu, having paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side. As the Venerable Bhagu was sitting to one side, the Blessed One said to him: “I hope, Bhikkhu, you are keeping well, I hope you are comfortable, I hope you are not troubled by almsfood?” “I am keeping well, Blessed One, I am comfortable, Blessed One, and I am not troubled by almsfood, Venerable Sir.” Then the Blessed One, having instructed, urged, roused, and gladdened the Venerable Bhagu with a Dhamma talk, rose from his seat and approached Pācīnavaṃsadāya.

274.The Account of the Journey to Pācīnavaṃsadāya

466. [ma. ni. 1.325 ādayo passitabbaṃ] Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā ca anuruddho āyasmā ca nandiyo āyasmā ca kimilo [kimbilo (sī. syā.)] pācīnavaṃsadāye viharanti.

Atha kho āyasmā anuruddho yenāyasmā ca nandiyo āyasmā ca kimilo tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantañca nandiyaṃ āyasmantañca kimilaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘abhikkamathāyasmanto abhikkamathāyasmanto, satthā no bhagavā anuppatto’’ti. Atha kho āyasmā ca anuruddho āyasmā ca nandiyo āyasmā ca kimilo bhagavantaṃ paccuggantvā eko bhagavato pattacīvaraṃ paṭiggahesi, eko āsanaṃ paññapesi, eko pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipi.

466.Now at that time, the Venerable Anuruddha, the Venerable Nandiya, and the Venerable Kimbila were dwelling in Pācīnavaṃsadāya. The park-keeper saw the Blessed One coming from afar. When he saw him, he said to the Blessed One: “Do not enter this park, ascetic. There are three young gentlemen dwelling here who are devoted to their own welfare. Do not disturb them.” The Venerable Anuruddha heard the park-keeper conversing with the Blessed One. When he heard him, he said to the park-keeper: “Friend park-keeper, do not obstruct the Blessed One. Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived.” Then the Venerable Anuruddha approached the Venerable Nandiya and the Venerable Kimbila. Having approached them, he said to them: “Come forth, venerable sirs, come forth! Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived.” Then the Venerable Anuruddha, the Venerable Nandiya, and the Venerable Kimbila went forth to meet the Blessed One. One received the Blessed One’s bowl and robe, one prepared a seat, and one set out water for the feet, a footstool, and a foot-towel. The Blessed One sat down on the prepared seat, and having sat down, he washed his feet. Those venerable ones, having paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side. As the Venerable Anuruddha was sitting to one side, the Blessed One said to him: “I hope, Anuruddhas, you are keeping well, I hope you are comfortable, I hope you are not wearied by alms-gathering?” “We are keeping well, Blessed One, we are comfortable, Blessed One, and, venerable sir, we are not wearied by alms-gathering.”

‘‘Kacci pana vo anuruddhā samaggā sammodamānā avivadamānā khīrodakībhūtā aññamaññaṃ piyacakkhūhi sampassantā viharathā’’ti? ‘‘Taggha mayaṃ, bhante, samaggā sammodamānā avivadamānā khīrodakībhūtā aññamaññaṃ piyacakkhūhi sampassantā viharāmā’’ti. ‘‘Yathā kathaṃ pana tumhe, anuruddhā, samaggā sammodamānā avivadamānā khīrodakībhūtā aññamaññaṃ piyacakkhūhi sampassantā viharathā’’ti? ‘‘Idha mayhaṃ, bhante, evaṃ hoti – ‘lābhā vata me, suladdhaṃ vata me, yohaṃ evarūpehi sabrahmacārīhi saddhiṃ viharāmī’’’ti.

“I hope, Anuruddhas, you are dwelling in concord, with mutual appreciation, without dispute, blending like milk and water, regarding each other with kindly eyes?” “Indeed, venerable sir, we are dwelling in concord, with mutual appreciation, without dispute, blending like milk and water, regarding each other with kindly eyes.” “But how, Anuruddhas, do you dwell in such concord?” “Here, venerable sir, it occurs to me: ‘It is a gain for me, it is a great gain for me, that I am dwelling with such companions in the holy life.’ Towards these venerable ones, loving-kindness in bodily action is present to me, both openly and in private; loving-kindness in verbal action… loving-kindness in mental action is present to me, both openly and in private. It occurs to me: ‘Why don’t I set aside my own mind and act according to the minds of these venerable ones?’ So, venerable sir, I set aside my own mind and act according to the minds of these venerable ones. Though our bodies are different, venerable sir, I believe our minds are one.”

Āyasmāpi kho nandiyo…pe… āyasmāpi kho kimilo bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘mayhampi kho, bhante, evaṃ hoti – ‘lābhā vata me, suladdhaṃ vata me, yohaṃ evarūpehi sabrahmacārīhi saddhiṃ viharāmī’ti. Tassa mayhaṃ, bhante, imesu āyasmantesu mettaṃ kāyakammaṃ paccupaṭṭhitaṃ āvi ceva raho ca; mettaṃ vacīkammaṃ mettaṃ manokammaṃ paccupaṭṭhitaṃ āvi ceva raho ca.

Evaṃ kho mayaṃ, bhante, samaggā sammodamānā avivadamānā khīrodakībhūtā aññamaññaṃ piyacakkhūhi sampassantā viharāmā’’ti.

The Venerable Nandiya… and the Venerable Kimila also addressed the Blessed One, saying: “For me too, venerable sir, it occurs to me: ‘It is a gain for me, it is a great gain for me, that I am dwelling with such companions in the holy life.’ For me, venerable sir, towards these venerable ones, loving-kindness in bodily action is present to me, both openly and in private; loving-kindness in verbal action… loving-kindness in mental action is present to me, both openly and in private. It occurs to me: ‘Why don’t I set aside my own mind and act according to the minds of these venerable ones?’ So, venerable sir, I set aside my own mind and act according to the minds of these venerable ones. Though our bodies are different, venerable sir, I believe our minds are one. Thus, venerable sir, we are dwelling in concord, with mutual appreciation, without dispute, blending like milk and water, regarding each other with kindly eyes.”

‘‘Kacci pana vo, anuruddhā, appamattā ātāpino pahitattā viharathā’’ti? ‘‘Taggha mayaṃ, bhante, appamattā ātāpino pahitattā viharāmā’’ti. ‘‘Yathā kathaṃ pana tumhe, anuruddhā, appamattā ātāpino pahitattā viharathā’’ti? ‘‘Idha, bhante, amhākaṃ yo paṭhamaṃ gāmato piṇḍāya paṭikkamati so āsanaṃ paññapeti, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipati, avakkārapātiṃ dhovitvā upaṭṭhāpeti, pānīyaṃ paribhojanīyaṃ upaṭṭhāpeti.

“I hope, Anuruddhas, you are dwelling diligent, ardent, and resolute?” “Indeed, venerable sir, we are dwelling diligent, ardent, and resolute.” “But how, Anuruddhas, do you dwell diligent, ardent, and resolute?” “Here, venerable sir, whoever among us returns first from the alms round prepares the seats, sets out water for the feet, a footstool, and a foot-towel, washes and sets out the slop basin, and prepares drinking water and water for use. Whoever returns later from the alms round, if there is any leftover food, he eats it if he wishes; if not, he discards it where there is little greenery or drops it into water where there are no living beings. He puts away the seats, clears away the water for the feet, the footstool, and the foot-towel, washes and puts away the slop basin, clears away the drinking water and water for use, and sweeps the refectory. Whoever sees that the water pitcher, the water for use pitcher, or the toilet pitcher is empty or low, he refills it. If it is too heavy for one, he calls another with a gesture, and we lift it together by the handle; but, venerable sir, we do not break into speech because of this. Every five nights, venerable sir, we gather together and spend the whole night in Dhamma talk. Thus, venerable sir, we are dwelling diligent, ardent, and resolute.”

275.The account of the journey to Pārileyyaka.

467. [udā. 35 ādayo thokaṃ visadisaṃ] Atha kho bhagavā āyasmantañca anuruddhaṃ āyasmantañca nandiyaṃ āyasmantañca kimilaṃ dhammiyā kathāya sandassetvā samādapetvā samuttejetvā sampahaṃsetvā uṭṭhāyāsanā yena pālileyyakaṃ [pārileyyakaṃ (sī. syā.)] tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena pālileyyakaṃ tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā pālileyyake viharati rakkhitavanasaṇḍe bhaddasālamūle. Atha kho bhagavato rahogatassa paṭisallīnassa evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – ‘‘ahaṃ kho pubbe ākiṇṇo na phāsu vihāsiṃ tehi kosambakehi [kosabbhikehi (syā.)] bhikkhūhi bhaṇḍanakārakehi kalahakārakehi vivādakārakehi bhassakārakehi saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakehi. Somhi etarahi eko adutiyo sukhaṃ phāsu viharāmi aññatreva tehi kosambakehi bhikkhūhi bhaṇḍanakārakehi kalahakārakehi vivādakārakehi bhassakārakehi saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakehī’’ti.

467.Then the Blessed One, having instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened Venerable Anuruddha, Venerable Nandiya, and Venerable Kimbila with a Dhamma talk, rose from his seat and set out for Pārileyyaka. Journeying by stages, he arrived at Pārileyyaka. There the Blessed One dwelt in Pārileyyaka, in the Rakkhita Grove, at the foot of a splendid sal tree. Then, while the Blessed One was alone and in seclusion, this thought arose in his mind: “Formerly, I lived crowded and uncomfortably with those quarrelsome, contentious, disputatious, and verbose monks of Kosambī, who caused disputes in the Saṅgha. But now I live alone, without a companion, happily and at ease, quite apart from those quarrelsome, contentious, disputatious, and verbose monks of Kosambī, who caused disputes in the Saṅgha.”

Aññataropi kho hatthināgo ākiṇṇo viharati hatthīhi hatthinīhi hatthikaḷabhehi hatthicchāpehi, chinnaggāni ceva tiṇāni khādati, obhaggobhaggañcassa sākhābhaṅgaṃ khādanti, āvilāni ca pānīyāni pivati, ogāhā cassa otiṇṇassa hatthiniyo kāyaṃ upanighaṃsantiyo gacchanti.

Yaṃnūnāhaṃ ekova gaṇasmā vūpakaṭṭho vihareyya’’nti. Atha kho so hatthināgo yūthā apakkamma yena pālileyyakaṃ rakkhitavanasaṇḍo bhaddasālamūlaṃ yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā soṇḍāya bhagavato pānīyaṃ paribhojanīyaṃ upaṭṭhāpeti, appaharitañca karoti. Atha kho tassa hatthināgassa etadahosi – ‘‘ahaṃ kho pubbe ākiṇṇo na phāsu vihāsiṃ hatthīhi hatthinīhi hatthikaḷabhehi hatthicchāpehi, chinnaggāni ceva tiṇāni khādiṃ, obhaggobhaggañca me sākhābhaṅgaṃ khādiṃsu, āvilāni ca pānīyāni apāyiṃ ogāhā ca me otiṇṇassa [ogāhañcassa otiṇṇassa (syā.), ogāhā cassa uttiṇṇassa (sī.)] hatthiniyo kāyaṃ upanighaṃsantiyo agamaṃsu. Somhi etarahi eko adutiyo sukhaṃ phāsu viharāmi aññatreva hatthīhi hatthinīhi hatthikaḷabhehi hatthicchāpehī’’ti.

A certain bull elephant, too, lived crowded by elephants, she-elephants, elephant calves, and young elephants. He ate grass with broken tips, they ate his broken branches, he drank muddy water, and when he went down to the watering place, she-elephants rubbed against his body as they went. Then this thought occurred to that bull elephant: “I live crowded by elephants, she-elephants, elephant calves, and young elephants. I eat grass with broken tips, they eat my broken branches, I drink muddy water, and when I go down to the watering place, she-elephants rub against my body as they go. Suppose I were to live alone, secluded from the herd.” Then that bull elephant, having left the herd, approached the Blessed One where he was dwelling in the Rakkhita Grove at the foot of a splendid sal tree in Pārileyyaka. Having approached, he provided the Blessed One with water for drinking and water for bathing with his trunk, and kept the area clear of grass. Then this thought occurred to that bull elephant: “Formerly, I lived crowded and uncomfortably, surrounded by elephants, she-elephants, elephant calves, and young elephants. I ate grass with broken tips, they ate my broken branches, I drank muddy water, and when I went down to the watering place, she-elephants rubbed against my body as they went. But now I live alone, without a companion, happily and at ease, quite apart from elephants, she-elephants, elephant calves, and young elephants.”

Atha kho bhagavā attano ca pavivekaṃ viditvā tassa ca hatthināgassa cetasā cetoparivitakkamaññāya tāyaṃ velāyaṃ imaṃ udānaṃ udānesi –

Then the Blessed One, knowing his own solitude and comprehending with his mind the thought in the mind of that bull elephant, at that time uttered this inspired utterance:

[udā. 35] ‘‘Etaṃ [evaṃ (ka.)] nāgassa nāgena, īsādantassa hatthino;Sameti cittaṃ cittena, yadeko ramatī vane’’ti.

“This is how the bull elephant accords with the Buddha-Nāga, the plough-tusked with the plough-tusked; mind accords with mind when one delights alone in the woods.”

Atha kho bhagavā pālileyyake yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena sāvatthi tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena sāvatthi tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Atha kho kosambakā upāsakā – ‘‘ime kho ayyā kosambakā bhikkhū bahuno amhākaṃ anatthassa kārakā. Imehi ubbāḷho bhagavā pakkanto. Handa mayaṃ ayye kosambake bhikkhū neva abhivādeyyāma, na paccuṭṭheyyāma, na añjalikammaṃ sāmīcikammaṃ kareyyāma, na sakkareyyāma, na garuṃ kareyyāma, na māneyyāma, na bhajeyyāma, na pūjeyyāma, upagatānampi piṇḍakaṃ na dajjeyyāma – evaṃ ime amhehi asakkariyamānā agarukariyamānā amāniyamānā abhajiyamānā apūjiyamānā asakkārapakatā pakkamissanti vā vibbhamissanti vā bhagavantaṃ vā pasādessantī’’ti. Atha kho kosambakā upāsakā kosambake bhikkhū neva abhivādesuṃ, na paccuṭṭhesuṃ, na añjalikammaṃ sāmīcikammaṃ akaṃsu, na sakkariṃsu, na garuṃ kariṃsu, na mānesuṃ, na bhajesuṃ na pūjesuṃ, upagatānampi piṇḍakaṃ na adaṃsu.

Then the Blessed One, having dwelt at Pārileyyaka for as long as he wished, set out on a journey for Sāvatthī. Journeying by stages, he arrived at Sāvatthī. There the Blessed One dwelt in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Monastery. Then the lay followers of Kosambī thought: “These venerable monks of Kosambī have caused us much harm. Harassed by them, the Blessed One departed. Come, let us neither pay homage to these venerable monks of Kosambī, nor rise up for them, nor perform the gesture of reverence, nor treat them with respect, nor revere them, nor esteem them, nor associate with them, nor venerate them. Even if they come for alms, we will not give them alms. Thus, being unhonored, unrespected, unesteemed, unassociated with, unvenerated, and deprived of hospitality by us, they will either depart or disrobe, or they will appease the Blessed One.” So the lay followers of Kosambī neither paid homage to the monks of Kosambī, nor rose up for them, nor performed the gesture of reverence, nor treated them with respect, nor revered them, nor esteemed them, nor associated with them, nor venerated them. Even when they came for alms, they did not give them alms. Then the monks of Kosambī, being unhonored, unrespected, unesteemed, unassociated with, unvenerated, and deprived of hospitality by the lay followers of Kosambī, said: “Come, friends, let us go to Sāvatthī and settle this dispute in the presence of the Blessed One.”

276.The Discourse on the Eighteen Matters

468. Atha kho kosambakā bhikkhū senāsanaṃ saṃsāmetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena sāvatthi tenupasaṅkamiṃsu. Assosi kho āyasmā sāriputto – ‘‘te kira kosambakā bhikkhū bhaṇḍanakārakā kalahakārakā vivādakārakā bhassakārakā saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā sāvatthiṃ āgacchantī’’ti. Atha kho āyasmā sāriputto yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā sāriputto bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘te kira, bhante, kosambakā bhikkhū bhaṇḍanakārakā kalahakārakā vivādakārakā bhassakārakā saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā sāvatthiṃ āgacchanti. Kathāhaṃ, bhante, tesu bhikkhūsu paṭipajjāmī’’ti? ‘‘Tena hi tvaṃ, sāriputta, yathā dhammo tathā tiṭṭhāhī’’ti. ‘‘Kathāhaṃ, bhante, jāneyyaṃ dhammaṃ vā adhammaṃ vā’’ti?

468.Then the monks from Kosambi, having tidied up their lodgings and taken their bowls and robes, set out for Savatthi. Venerable Sariputta heard: “It seems those monks from Kosambi, who are quarrelsome, contentious, disputatious, given to idle talk, and who create disputes in the Sangha, are coming to Savatthi.” Then Venerable Sariputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, Venerable Sariputta said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, it seems those monks from Kosambi, who are quarrelsome, contentious, disputatious, given to idle talk, and who create disputes in the Sangha, are coming to Savatthi. How, venerable sir, should I conduct myself toward those monks?” “Then, Sariputta, you should abide according to the Dhamma.” “But how, venerable sir, should I know what is the Dhamma and what is not the Dhamma?”

Aṭṭhārasahi kho, sāriputta, vatthūhi adhammavādī jānitabbo.

474.Then that monk who had been expelled, reflecting on the Dhamma and the Vinaya, thought: “This is an offense, not a non-offense. I have committed an offense; I am not one who has not committed an offense. I have been expelled; I am not one who has not been expelled. I have been expelled by a lawful act, irreversible, worthy to stand.” Then that monk who had been expelled approached the monks who supported the expelled monk, and upon arrival said to them: “This is an offense, friends; it is not a non-offense. I have committed an offense; I am not one who has not committed an offense. I have been expelled; I am not one who has not been expelled. I have been expelled by a lawful act, irreversible, worthy to stand. Come, Venerables, reinstate me.” Then those monks who supported the expelled monk took that monk who had been expelled and approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, those monks said to the Blessed One: “Venerable Sir, this monk who had been expelled says: ‘This is an offense, friends; it is not a non-offense. I have committed an offense; I am not one who has not committed an offense. I have been expelled; I am not one who has not been expelled. I have been expelled by a lawful act, irreversible, worthy to stand. Come, Venerables, reinstate me.’ How then, Venerable Sir, should we proceed?” “This is an offense, bhikkhus; it is not a non-offense. This monk has committed an offense; he is not one who has not committed an offense. This monk has been expelled; he is not one who has not been expelled. He has been expelled by a lawful act, irreversible, worthy to stand. But since, bhikkhus, that monk sees that he has committed an offense and has been expelled, therefore, bhikkhus, you should reinstate that monk.”

Seated to one side, those monks said to the Blessed One: “Venerable Sir, those monks who supported the expelled monk said this: ‘Friends, regarding the matter in which there was dispute, quarrel, contention, and argument in the Saṅgha, a schism in the Saṅgha, a fracture in the Saṅgha, a division in the Saṅgha, and the causing of different opinions in the Saṅgha—that monk has committed an offense, has been expelled, has seen it, and has been reinstated. Come, friends, let us perform Saṅgha harmony for the settlement of that matter.’ How then, Venerable Sir, should we proceed?” “Bhikkhus, since that monk has committed an offense, has been expelled, has seen it, and has been reinstated, then, bhikkhus, the Saṅgha should perform Saṅgha harmony for the settlement of that matter. And this is how it should be done, bhikkhus. All should gather together, both the sick and the healthy. No one should give their consent. Having gathered, a competent and capable bhikkhu should announce to the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yasmiṃ vatthusmiṃ ahosi saṅghassa bhaṇḍanaṃ kalaho viggaho vivādo saṅghabhedo saṅgharāji saṅghavavatthānaṃ saṅghanānākaraṇaṃ, so eso bhikkhu āpanno ca ukkhitto ca passi ca osārito ca. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho tassa vatthussa vūpasamāya saṅghasāmaggiṃ kareyya. Esā ñatti.

“May the Saṅgha, Venerable Sir, hear me. Regarding the matter in which there was dispute, quarrel, contention, and argument in the Saṅgha, a schism in the Saṅgha, a fracture in the Saṅgha, a division in the Saṅgha, and the causing of different opinions in the Saṅgha—that monk has committed an offense, has been expelled, has seen it, and has been reinstated. If it seems fit to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should perform Saṅgha harmony for the settlement of that matter. This is the motion.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yasmiṃ vatthusmiṃ ahosi saṅghassa bhaṇḍanaṃ kalaho viggaho vivādo saṅghabhedo saṅgharāji saṅghavavatthānaṃ saṅghanānākaraṇaṃ, so eso bhikkhu āpanno ca ukkhitto ca passi ca osārito ca. Saṅgho tassa vatthussa vūpasamāya saṅghasāmaggiṃ karoti. Yassāyasmato khamati tassa vatthussa vūpasamāya saṅghasāmaggiyā karaṇaṃ, so tuṇhassa, yassa nakkhamati so bhāseyya.

“May the Saṅgha, Venerable Sir, hear me. Regarding the matter in which there was dispute, quarrel, contention, and argument in the Saṅgha, a schism in the Saṅgha, a fracture in the Saṅgha, a division in the Saṅgha, and the causing of different opinions in the Saṅgha—that monk has committed an offense, has been expelled, has seen it, and has been reinstated. The Saṅgha is performing Saṅgha harmony for the settlement of that matter. Whoever agrees to the performance of Saṅgha harmony for the settlement of that matter, let him be silent; whoever does not agree, let him speak.”

‘‘Katā saṅghena tassa vatthussa vūpasamāya saṅghasāmaggī. Nihato saṅghabhedo, nihatā saṅgharāji, nihataṃ saṅghavavatthānaṃ, nihataṃ saṅghanānākaraṇaṃ. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

“Saṅgha harmony for the settlement of that matter has been performed by the Saṅgha. Schism in the Saṅgha has been eliminated, a fracture in the Saṅgha has been eliminated, a division in the Saṅgha has been eliminated, and the causing of different opinions in the Saṅgha has been eliminated. The Saṅgha approves of it, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.”

Tāvadeva uposatho kātabbo, pātimokkhaṃ uddisitabbanti.

The Uposatha should be performed right then, and the Pātimokkha should be recited.

Saṅghasāmaggīkathā niṭṭhitā.

The Talk on Harmony in the Saṅgha is concluded.

279.Upāli's Question Concerning Harmony in the Saṅgha

476. Atha kho āyasmā upāli yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā upāli bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘yasmiṃ, bhante, vatthusmiṃ hoti saṅghassa bhaṇḍanaṃ kalaho viggaho vivādo saṅghabhedo saṅgharāji saṅghavavatthānaṃ saṅghanānākaraṇaṃ, saṅgho taṃ vatthuṃ avinicchinitvā amūlā mūlaṃ gantvā saṅghasāmaggiṃ karoti, dhammikā nu kho sā, bhante, saṅghasāmaggī’’ti? ‘‘Yasmiṃ, upāli, vatthusmiṃ hoti saṅghassa bhaṇḍanaṃ kalaho viggaho vivādo saṅghabhedo saṅgharāji saṅghavavatthānaṃ saṅghanānākaraṇaṃ, saṅgho taṃ vatthuṃ avinicchinitvā amūlā mūlaṃ gantvā saṅghasāmaggiṃ karoti, adhammikā sā, upāli, saṅghasāmaggī’’ti.

476.Then the Venerable Upāli approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the Venerable Upāli said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, if in a matter where there is quarrel, dispute, contention, disagreement, schism in the Saṅgha, faction in the Saṅgha, disarray in the Saṅgha, making the Saṅgha diverse, the Saṅgha, without having investigated that matter, without going to its root, makes a Saṅgha act of unity, is that Saṅgha act of unity lawful, venerable sir?" "Upāli, if in a matter where there is quarrel, dispute, contention, disagreement, schism in the Saṅgha, faction in the Saṅgha, disarray in the Saṅgha, making the Saṅgha diverse, the Saṅgha, without having investigated that matter, without going to its root, makes a Saṅgha act of unity, that Saṅgha act of unity is unlawful, Upāli."

‘‘Yasmiṃ pana, bhante, vatthusmiṃ hoti saṅghassa bhaṇḍanaṃ kalaho viggaho vivādo saṅghabhedo saṅgharāji saṅghavavatthānaṃ saṅghanānākaraṇaṃ, saṅgho taṃ vatthuṃ vinicchinitvā mūlā mūlaṃ gantvā saṅghasāmaggiṃ karoti, dhammikā nu kho sā, bhante, saṅghasāmaggī’’ti? ‘‘Yasmiṃ, upāli, vatthusmiṃ hoti saṅghassa bhaṇḍanaṃ kalaho viggaho vivādo saṅghabhedo saṅgharāji saṅghavavatthānaṃ saṅghanānākaraṇaṃ, saṅgho taṃ vatthuṃ vinicchinitvā mūlā mūlaṃ gantvā saṅghasāmaggiṃ karoti, dhammikā sā, upāli, saṅghasāmaggī’’ti.

"Venerable sir, if in a matter where there is quarrel, dispute, contention, disagreement, schism in the Saṅgha, faction in the Saṅgha, disarray in the Saṅgha, making the Saṅgha diverse, the Saṅgha, having investigated that matter, going to its root, makes a Saṅgha act of unity, is that Saṅgha act of unity lawful, venerable sir?" "Upāli, if in a matter where there is quarrel, dispute, contention, disagreement, schism in the Saṅgha, faction in the Saṅgha, disarray in the Saṅgha, making the Saṅgha diverse, the Saṅgha, having investigated that matter, going to its root, makes a Saṅgha act of unity, that Saṅgha act of unity is lawful, Upāli."

‘‘Kati nu kho, bhante, saṅghasāmaggiyo’’ti? ‘‘Dvemā, upāli, saṅghasāmaggiyo – atthupāli, saṅghasāmaggī atthāpetā byañjanupetā; atthupāli, saṅghasāmaggī atthupetā ca byañjanupetā ca. Katamā ca, upāli, saṅghasāmaggī atthāpetā byañjanupetā? Yasmiṃ, upāli, vatthusmiṃ hoti saṅghassa bhaṇḍanaṃ kalaho viggaho vivādo saṅghabhedo saṅgharāji saṅghavavatthānaṃ saṅghanānākaraṇaṃ, saṅgho taṃ vatthuṃ avinicchinitvā amūlā mūlaṃ gantvā saṅghasāmaggiṃ karoti, ayaṃ vuccati, upāli, saṅghasāmaggī atthāpetā byañjanupetā. Katamā ca, upāli, saṅghasāmaggī atthupetā ca byañjanupetā ca? Yasmiṃ, upāli, vatthusmiṃ hoti saṅghassa bhaṇḍanaṃ kalaho viggaho vivādo saṅghabhedo saṅgharāji saṅghavavatthānaṃ saṅghanānākaraṇaṃ, saṅgho taṃ vatthuṃ vinicchinitvā mūlā mūlaṃ gantvā saṅghasāmaggiṃ karoti, ayaṃ vuccati, upāli, saṅghasāmaggī atthupetā ca byañjanupetā ca. Imā kho, upāli, dve saṅghasāmaggiyo’’ti.

"How many kinds of Saṅgha acts of unity are there, venerable sir?" "There are these two kinds of Saṅgha acts of unity, Upāli: a Saṅgha act of unity that is devoid of meaning but endowed with expression, and a Saṅgha act of unity that is endowed with both meaning and expression. And what, Upāli, is a Saṅgha act of unity that is devoid of meaning but endowed with expression? In a matter where there is quarrel, dispute, contention, disagreement, schism in the Saṅgha, faction in the Saṅgha, disarray in the Saṅgha, making the Saṅgha diverse, if the Saṅgha, without having investigated that matter, without going to its root, makes a Saṅgha act of unity, this is called a Saṅgha act of unity that is devoid of meaning but endowed with expression. And what, Upāli, is a Saṅgha act of unity that is endowed with both meaning and expression? In a matter where there is quarrel, dispute, contention, disagreement, schism in the Saṅgha, faction in the Saṅgha, disarray in the Saṅgha, making the Saṅgha diverse, if the Saṅgha, having investigated that matter, going to its root, makes a Saṅgha act of unity, this is called a Saṅgha act of unity that is endowed with both meaning and expression. These, Upāli, are the two kinds of Saṅgha acts of unity."

477. Atha kho āyasmā upāli uṭṭhāyāsanā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā yena bhagavā tenañjaliṃ paṇāmetvā bhagavantaṃ gāthāya ajjhabhāsi –

477.Then the Venerable Upāli rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, extended his joined palms in reverential salutation toward the Blessed One, and addressed him in verse:

‘‘Saṅghassa kiccesu ca mantanāsu ca;Atthesu jātesu vinicchayesu ca;Kathaṃpakārodha naro mahatthiko;Bhikkhu kathaṃ hotidha paggahārahoti.

"In the Saṅgha's affairs and in consultations, In matters that have arisen and in their determinations, How should a person of great benefit behave? How should a monk here be worthy of support?"

‘‘Anānuvajjo paṭhamena sīlato;Avekkhitācāro susaṃvutindriyo;Paccatthikā nūpavadanti dhammato;Na hissa taṃ hoti vadeyyu yena naṃ.

"Blameless by virtue of his primary conduct, With well-examined conduct, well-restrained in the senses; Adversaries do not reproach him according to the Dhamma, For there is nothing in him by which they might criticize him."

‘‘So tādiso sīlavisuddhiyā ṭhito;Visārado hoti visayha bhāsati;Nacchambhati parisagato na vedhati;Atthaṃ na hāpeti anuyyutaṃ bhaṇaṃ.

"Such a one, established in purity of virtue, Is confident, he speaks with mastery; He does not falter or tremble when in an assembly; He does not lose the meaning, speaking what is appropriate."

‘‘Tatheva pañhaṃ parisāsu pucchito;Na ceva pajjhāyati na maṅku hoti;So kālāgataṃ byākaraṇārahaṃ vaco;Rañjeti viññūparisaṃ vicakkhaṇo.

"Likewise, when questioned in assemblies, He does not hesitate or become perplexed; He speaks a word that is timely and worthy of explanation, Delighting the assembly of the discerning with his sagacity."

‘‘Sagāravo vuḍḍhataresu bhikkhusu;Ācerakamhi ca sake visārado;Alaṃ pametuṃ paguṇo kathetave;Paccatthikānañca viraddhikovido.

"Respectful toward elder monks, And confident in his own teacher's tradition; Capable of discerning, practiced in speaking, And skilled in the errors of opponents."

‘‘Paccatthikā yena vajanti niggahaṃ;Mahājano saññapanañca gacchati;Sakañca ādāyamayaṃ na riñcati;Viyākaraṃ [so byākaraṃ (sī.), veyyākaraṃ (syā.)] pañhamanūpaghātikaṃ.

"By which opponents go to defeat, And the great populace gains understanding; And explaining a question that is non-injurious, He does not abandon his own tradition."

‘‘Dūteyyakammesu alaṃ samuggaho;Saṅghassa kiccesu ca āhu naṃ yathā;Karaṃ vaco bhikkhugaṇena pesito;Ahaṃ karomīti na tena maññati.

"Competent in the duties of a messenger, And as they say of him, in the Saṅgha's affairs; Making a statement, sent by the community of monks, He does not become conceited on that account."

‘‘Āpajjati yāvatakesu vatthusu;Āpattiyā hoti yathā ca vuṭṭhiti;Ete vibhaṅgā ubhayassa svāgatā;Āpatti vuṭṭhānapadassa kovido.

"He knows in how many matters one incurs an offense, And how there is a rising up from an offense; These analyses are well-received by both parties, Skilled in the procedure for rising up from an offense."

‘‘Nissāraṇaṃ gacchati yāni cācaraṃ;Nissārito hoti yathā ca vattanā [vatthunā (sī. syā.)];Osāraṇaṃ taṃvusitassa jantuno;Etampi jānāti vibhaṅgakovido.

"He knows what actions lead to expulsion, And how one, having been expelled, conducts oneself; He knows the re-admission for the person who has completed that practice; He knows this too, skilled in analysis."

‘‘Sagāravo vuḍḍhataresu bhikkhusu;Navesu theresu ca majjhimesu ca;Mahājanassatthacarodha paṇḍito;So tādiso bhikkhu idha paggahāraho’’ti.

"Respectful toward elder monks, As well as toward new, elder, and middle-aged monks; Wise, he acts for the welfare of the great populace; Such a monk here is worthy of support."

Upālisaṅghasāmaggīpucchā niṭṭhitā.

The Questions of Upāli on Saṅgha Unity are concluded.
