306.At that time the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. Now on that occasion about thirty monks from Pava—all forest dwellers, all alms-goers, all rag-robe wearers, and all triple-robe users—were traveling to Savatthi to see the Blessed One. But being near the entry day for the Rains residence, they were unable to reach Savatthi in time to enter the Rains residence, so they entered the Rains residence on the way at Saketa. They spent the Rains residence discontented, thinking, “The Blessed One is staying nearby, just six yojanas away, yet we don’t get to see him.” Then, when those monks had completed the Rains residence and had performed the Pavarana ceremony at the end of the three months, with rain still falling, with flooded roads and muddy conditions, and their robes soaked and heavy, they set out for Savatthi, Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, approaching the Blessed One. They approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Now it is the custom for the Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, to greet newly arrived monks. So the Blessed One said to them, “I hope, monks, that you are well, that you are comfortable, that you spent the Rains in harmony, without dispute, at ease, and that you were not exhausted by seeking alms?” “We are well, Blessed One; we are comfortable, Blessed One. We spent the Rains, Venerable Sir, in harmony, without dispute, at ease, and we were not exhausted by seeking alms. But, Venerable Sir, about thirty of us monks from Pava were traveling to Savatthi to see the Blessed One, being near the Rains residence. However, we were unable to reach Savatthi in time to enter the Rains residence, so we entered the Rains residence on the way at Saketa. We spent the Rains residence discontented, thinking, ‘The Blessed One is staying nearby, just six yojanas away, yet we don’t get to see him.’ Then, Venerable Sir, after completing the Rains residence and performing the Pavarana ceremony at the end of the three months, with rain still falling, with flooded roads and muddy conditions, and our robes soaked and heavy, we came here having travelled a long distance." Then the Blessed One, having given a Dhamma talk on this occasion, addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow monks who have completed the Rains residence to spread the Kathina cloth. For those who have spread the Kathina, monks, five things will be allowable: 1. Going without announcing, 2. Going without taking leave, 3. Group meals, 4. As many robes as needed, 5. And whatever robe-material arises there will belong to them. For those who have spread the Kathina, monks, these five things will be allowable. And this is how the Kathina should be spread, monks: A competent monk should inform the Sangha:

307. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Idaṃ saṅghassa kathinadussaṃ uppannaṃ. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho imaṃ kathinadussaṃ itthannāmassa bhikkhuno dadeyya kathinaṃ attharituṃ. Esā ñatti.

307."Venerable sir, may the Sangha hear me. This Kathina cloth has arisen for the Sangha. If it seems fit to the Sangha, the Sangha should give this Kathina cloth to the monk named so-and-so to spread the Kathina. This is the announcement."

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Idaṃ saṅghassa kathinadussaṃ uppannaṃ. Saṅgho imaṃ kathinadussaṃ itthannāmassa bhikkhuno deti kathinaṃ attharituṃ. Yassāyasmato khamati imassa kathinadussassa itthannāmassa bhikkhuno dānaṃ kathinaṃ attharituṃ, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

"Venerable sir, may the Sangha hear me. This Kathina cloth has arisen for the Sangha. The Sangha gives this Kathina cloth to the monk named so-and-so to spread the Kathina. If it is agreeable to the venerable ones that this Kathina cloth be given to the monk named so-and-so for spreading the Kathina, let them be silent. If anyone does not approve, let them speak."

‘‘Dinnaṃ idaṃ saṅghena kathinadussaṃ itthannāmassa bhikkhuno kathinaṃ attharituṃ. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

"This Kathina cloth has been given to the monk named so-and-so by the Sangha for spreading the Kathina. It is acceptable to the Sangha, therefore it is silent. Thus do I hold it."

308. ‘‘Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, evaṃ anatthataṃ. Kathañca pana, bhikkhave, anatthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ? Na ullikhitamattena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na dhovanamattena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na cīvaravicāraṇamattena [na gaṇṭusakaraṇamattena (ka.)] atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na chedanamattena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na bandhanamattena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na ovaṭṭiyakaraṇamattena [na ovaṭṭeyyakaraṇamattena (sī. syā.), na ovadeyyakaraṇamattena (ka.)] atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na kaṇḍusakaraṇamattena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na daḷhīkammakaraṇamattena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na anuvātakaraṇamattena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na paribhaṇḍakaraṇamattena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na ovaddheyyakaraṇamattena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na kambalamaddanamattena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na nimittakatena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na parikathākatena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na kukkukatena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na sannidhikatena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na nissaggiyena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na akappakatena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na aññatra saṅghāṭiyā atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na aññatra uttarāsaṅgena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na aññatra antaravāsakena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na aññatra pañcakena vā atirekapañcakena vā tadaheva sañchinnena samaṇḍalīkatena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, na aññatra puggalassa atthārā atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ; sammā ceva atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, tañce nissīmaṭṭho anumodati, evampi anatthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, anatthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ.

308."Thus, monks, the Kathina is spread, and thus it is not spread. And how, monks, is the Kathina not spread? The Kathina is not spread merely by outlining. The Kathina is not spread merely by washing. The Kathina is not spread merely by examining the robe material. The Kathina is not spread merely by cutting. The Kathina is not spread merely by tying threads. The Kathina is not spread merely by making a hem. The Kathina is not spread merely by making a border. The Kathina is not spread merely by reinforcing. The Kathina is not spread merely by lining. The Kathina is not spread merely by making the binding. The Kathina is not spread merely by making the fastening. The Kathina is not spread merely by dyeing. The Kathina is not spread by one that has been made with a sign. The Kathina is not spread by one that has been obtained through prior discussion. The Kathina is not spread by one that is provisional. The Kathina is not spread by one that has been accumulated. The Kathina is not spread by one that is subject to forfeiture. The Kathina is not spread by one that has not been made suitable. The Kathina is not spread if it is anything other than the outer robe. The Kathina is not spread if it is anything other than the upper robe. The Kathina is not spread if it is anything other than the lower robe. The Kathina is not spread if it is anything other than that which is cut into five or more pieces and made circular on the same day. The Kathina is not spread unless it is spread for an individual. Even if the Kathina is properly spread, if a monk residing outside the boundary approves of it, even then the Kathina is not spread. Thus, monks, the Kathina is not spread."

309. ‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ? Ahatena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, ahatakappena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, pilotikāya atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, paṃsukūlena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, pāpaṇikena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, animittakatena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, aparikathākatena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, akukkukatena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, asannidhikatena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, anissaggiyena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, kappakatena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, saṅghāṭiyā atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, uttarāsaṅgena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, antaravāsakena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, pañcakena vā atirekapañcakena vā tadaheva sañchinnena samaṇḍalīkatena atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, puggalassa atthārā atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ; sammā ce atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ, tañce sīmaṭṭho anumodati, evampi atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, atthataṃ hoti kathinaṃ.

309."And how, monks, is the Kathina spread? The Kathina is spread with unused cloth, with new-like cloth, with rags, with cloth from a dust heap, with shop-bought cloth, by one that has not been made with a sign, by one that has not been obtained through prior discussion, by one that is not provisional, by one that has not been accumulated, by one that is not subject to forfeiture, by one that has been made suitable, with the outer robe, with the upper robe, with the lower robe, with that which is cut into five or more pieces and made circular on the same day, if it is spread for an individual; and if the Kathina is properly spread, and if those within the boundary approve, thus the Kathina is spread. This, monks, is how the Kathina is spread."

310. ‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, ubbhataṃ hoti kathinaṃ? Aṭṭhimā, bhikkhave, mātikā kathinassa ubbhārāya – pakkamanantikā, niṭṭhānantikā, sanniṭṭhānantikā, nāsanantikā, savanantikā, āsāvacchedikā, sīmātikkantikā, sahubbhārā’’ti [saubbhārāti (ka.)].

310."And how, monks, is the Kathina withdrawn? There are eight grounds, monks, for the withdrawal of the Kathina: departure, completion, finalization, destruction, announcement, cutting off hope, transgression of the boundary, and joint withdrawal."

Kathinānujānanā niṭṭhitā.

The Kathina authorization is concluded.

200.Discussion on Obstructions and Non-Obstructions

325.Monks, there are these two obstructions to the Kaṭhina and two non-obstructions. What, monks, are the two obstructions to the Kaṭhina? The obstruction concerning the dwelling and the obstruction concerning the robe. And how, monks, is there an obstruction concerning the dwelling? Here, monks, a bhikkhu either dwells in that dwelling, or departs with attachment, thinking, ‘I will return.’ Thus, monks, there is an obstruction concerning the dwelling. And how, monks, is there an obstruction concerning the robe? Here, monks, a bhikkhu’s robe is either unmade or unfinished, or his hope for a robe has not been abandoned. Thus, monks, there is an obstruction concerning the robe. These, monks, are the two obstructions to the Kaṭhina.

Katame ca, bhikkhave, dve kathinassa apalibodhā? Āvāsaapalibodho ca cīvaraapalibodho ca. Kathañca, bhikkhave, āvāsaapalibodho hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu pakkamati tamhā āvāsā cattena vantena muttena anapekkho [anapekkhena (ka.)] ‘‘na paccessa’’nti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, āvāsaapalibodho hoti.

Ime kho, bhikkhave, dve kathinassa apalibodhāti.

And what, monks, are the two non-obstructions to the Kaṭhina? The non-obstruction concerning the dwelling and the non-obstruction concerning the robe. And how, monks, is there a non-obstruction concerning the dwelling? Here, monks, a bhikkhu departs from that dwelling, having abandoned, relinquished, and freed himself, without expectation, thinking, ‘I will not return.’ Thus, monks, there is a non-obstruction concerning the dwelling. And how, monks, is there a non-obstruction concerning the robe? Here, monks, a bhikkhu’s robe is either made, lost, ruined, or burnt, or his hope for a robe is cut off. Thus, monks, there is a non-obstruction concerning the robe. These, monks, are the two non-obstructions to the Kaṭhina.

201.Summary

Tiṃsa pāveyyakā bhikkhū, sāketukkaṇṭhitā vasuṃ;Vassaṃvuṭṭhokapuṇṇehi, agamuṃ jinadassanaṃ.

Thirty bhikkhus from Pāvā, weary of Sāketa, having completed the rains, with newly-made robes, went to see the Victor.

Idaṃ vatthu kathinassa, kappissanti ca pañcakā;Anāmantā asamācārā, tatheva gaṇabhojanaṃ.

This is the cloth for the Kaṭhina, and the five who are entitled; without leave, unseemly conduct, and likewise group meals.

Yāvadatthañca uppādo, atthatānaṃ bhavissati;Ñatti evatthatañceva, evañceva anatthataṃ.

As long as the arising of the purpose exists, it will be for the benefit; the motion and its being spread, and likewise its not being spread.

Ullikhi dhovanā ceva, vicāraṇañca chedanaṃ;Bandhano vaṭṭi kaṇḍusa, daḷhīkammānuvātikā.

Marking, washing, examining, cutting; binding, turning, scratching, strengthening, and following-up.

Paribhaṇḍaṃ ovaddheyyaṃ, maddanā nimittaṃ kathā;Kukku sannidhi nissaggi, na kappaññatra te tayo.

Repairing what is worn out, massaging limbs, hinting with signs, talkativeness; fostering doubt, hoarding requisites, and giving up residence—these three are not allowable.

Aññatra pañcātireke, sañchinnena samaṇḍalī;Nāññatra puggalā sammā, nissīmaṭṭhonumodati.

Except for a surplus of five, cut off and complete; not rightly by individuals, nor does one outside the boundary approve.

Kathinānatthataṃ hoti, evaṃ buddhena desitaṃ;Ahatākappapiloti, paṃsu pāpaṇikāya ca.

The Kaṭhina is not spread, thus taught by the Buddha, if it is new cloth, unsuitable, a rag, dust-heap cloth, or a merchant's purchase.

Animittāparikathā, akukku ca asannidhi;Anissaggi kappakate, tathā ticīvarena ca.

Without a sign, without gossip, without remorse, and without hoarding; without having to relinquish what is allowable, and also with the three robes.

Pañcake vātireke vā, chinne samaṇḍalīkate;Puggalassatthārā sammā, sīmaṭṭho anumodati.

Beyond five or more, when cut and made circular, the individual's purpose is rightly attained, and one within the boundary approves.

Evaṃ kathinattharaṇaṃ, ubbhārassaṭṭhamātikā;Pakkamananti niṭṭhānaṃ, sanniṭṭhānañca nāsanaṃ.

Thus, the spreading of the Kaṭhina, the eighth concluding topic of raising it; departure is the conclusion, and the formal resolution is the annulment.

Savanaṃ āsāvacchedi, sīmā sahubbhāraṭṭhamī;Katacīvaramādāya, ‘‘na paccessa’’nti gacchati.

Hearing cuts off craving, the boundary with the lifting as the eighth. Taking the finished robe, one goes, ‘I will not return.’

Tassa taṃ kathinuddhārā,e hoti pakkamanantiko;Ādāya cīvaraṃ yāti, nissīme idaṃ cintayi.

For him, that Kaṭhina-lifting is for the purpose of departure. Taking the robe, he goes, thinking, ‘This is without boundary.’

‘‘Kāressaṃ na paccessa’’nti, niṭṭhāne kathinuddhāro;Ādāya nissīmaṃ neva, ‘‘na paccessa’’nti mānaso.

‘I will make (it), I will not return’—thus, at the completion, the Kaṭhina is withdrawn. Taking it beyond the boundary, ‘I will not return’ is the thought.

Tassa taṃ kathinuddhāro, sanniṭṭhānantiko bhave;Ādāya cīvaraṃ yāti, nissīme idaṃ cintayi.

For him, that Kaṭhina-lifting is complete, decisive. Taking the robe, he departs, reflecting, ‘This is without boundary.’

‘‘Kāressaṃ na paccessa’’nti, kayiraṃ tassa nassati;Tassa taṃ kathinuddhāro, bhavati nāsanantiko.

‘I will do it and not come back,’ that undertaking of his is lost. For him, the lifting of the Kaṭhina is accompanied by destruction.

Ādāya yāti ‘‘paccessaṃ’’, bahi kāreti cīvaraṃ;Katacīvaro suṇāti, ubbhataṃ kathinaṃ tahiṃ.

Taking it, he goes, thinking, ‘I will return,’ and has the robe made outside the boundary. The finished robe is announced, and the Kaṭhina is lifted there.

Tassa taṃ kathinuddhāro, bhavati savanantiko;Ādāya yāti ‘‘paccessaṃ’’, bahi kāreti cīvaraṃ.

For him, the lifting of the Kaṭhina is near to hearing. Taking it, he goes thinking, ‘I will come back,’ and has the robe made outside.

Katacīvaro bahiddhā, nāmeti kathinuddhāraṃ;Tassa taṃ kathinuddhāro, sīmātikkantiko bhave.

The robe is finished outside the boundary; he aims to remove the Kaṭhina. For him, that removal of the Kaṭhina is an infraction of the boundary.

Ādāya yāti ‘‘paccessaṃ’’, bahi kāreti cīvaraṃ;Katacīvaro paccessaṃ, sambhoti kathinuddhāraṃ.

Taking it, he goes thinking, ‘I will come back,’ and has the robe made outside. The finished robe brings the return, and the lifting of the Kaṭhina arises.

Tassa taṃ kathinuddhāro, saha bhikkhūhi jāyati;Ādāya ca samādāya, satta-sattavidhā gati.

For him, the raising up of the Kaṭhina occurs together with the bhikkhus; taking and receiving, the distribution proceeds in seven groups of seven.

Pakkamanantikā natthi, chakke vippakate [chaṭṭhe vippakatā (sī.), chaccā vippakathā (ka.)] gati;Ādāya nissīmagataṃ, kāressaṃ iti jāyati.

There is no final departure. In the six realms, the course of existence is interrupted; having taken (rebirth), one goes to the boundless. The thought arises, ‘I will do (it).’

Niṭṭhānaṃ sanniṭṭhānañca, nāsanañca ime tayo;Ādāya ‘‘na paccessa’’nti, bahisīme karomiti.

Completion, firm decision, and destruction—these three— taking it, thinking, ‘I will not return,’ he makes a boundary outside.

Niṭṭhānaṃ sanniṭṭhānampi, nāsanampi idaṃ tayo;Anadhiṭṭhitena nevassa, heṭṭhā tīṇi nayāvidhi.

Completion, resolution, and destruction—these three— without prior determination, these three methods do not apply.

Ādāya yāti paccessaṃ, bahisīme karomiti;‘‘Na paccessa’’nti kāreti, niṭṭhāne kathinuddhāro.

Taking it, he goes thinking, ‘I will go back,’ and makes it outside the boundary. ‘I will not go back,’ he has it done—thus, at the completion, the Kaṭhina is lifted.

Sanniṭṭhānaṃ nāsanañca, savanasīmātikkamā;Saha bhikkhūhi jāyetha, evaṃ pannarasaṃ gati.

Decision, destruction, a hearing, and transgression of the boundary— together with the bhikkhus, thus the fifteenth practice arises.

Samādāya vippakatā, samādāya punā tathā;Ime te caturo vārā, sabbe pannarasavidhi.

Undertaking unfinished, undertaking again thus; these are the four turns, all fifteen in kind.

Anāsāya ca āsāya, karaṇīyo ca te tayo;Nayato taṃ vijāneyya, tayo dvādasa dvādasa.

Without clinging, with clinging, and what should be done—these three; one should understand them by method, three, twelve, and twelve.

Apavilānā navettha [apavilāyamāneva (syā.), apavinā nava cettha (sī.)], phāsu pañcavidhā tahiṃ;Palibodhāpalibodhā, uddānaṃ nayato katanti.

Unfading and new, comfort is fivefold therein. Obstructions and non-obstructions—the summary is done methodically.

Imamhi khandhake vatthū doḷasakapeyyālamukhāni ekasataṃ aṭṭhārasa.

In this chapter, there are twelve topics with abbreviated expositions, one hundred and eighteen in all.

Kathinakkhandhako niṭṭhito.

The Kaṭhina Chapter is concluded.
