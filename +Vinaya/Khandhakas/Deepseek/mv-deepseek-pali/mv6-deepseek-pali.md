160.The Discourse on the Five Medicines

260. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhūnaṃ sāradikena ābādhena phuṭṭhānaṃ yāgupi pītā uggacchati, bhattampi bhuttaṃ uggacchati. Te tena kisā honti, lūkhā, dubbaṇṇā, uppaṇḍuppaṇḍukajātā, dhamanisanthatagattā. Addasā kho bhagavā te bhikkhū kise lūkhe dubbaṇṇe uppaṇḍuppaṇḍukajāte dhamanisanthatagatte, disvāna āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ āmantesi – ‘‘kiṃ nu kho, ānanda, etarahi bhikkhū kisā, lūkhā, dubbaṇṇā, uppaṇḍuppaṇḍukajātā, dhamanisanthatagattā’’ti? ‘‘Etarahi, bhante, bhikkhūnaṃ sāradikena ābādhena phuṭṭhānaṃ yāgupi pītā uggacchati, bhattampi bhuttaṃ uggacchati. Te tena kisā honti, lūkhā, dubbaṇṇā, uppaṇḍuppaṇḍukajātā, dhamanisanthatagattā’’ti. Atha kho bhagavato rahogatassa paṭisallīnassa evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – ‘‘etarahi kho bhikkhūnaṃ sāradikena ābādhena phuṭṭhānaṃ yāgupi pītā uggacchati, bhattampi bhuttaṃ uggacchati. Te tena kisā honti, lūkhā, dubbaṇṇā, uppaṇḍuppaṇḍukajātā, dhamanisanthatagattā. Kiṃ nu kho ahaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ bhesajjaṃ anujāneyyaṃ, yaṃ bhesajjañceva assa bhesajjasammatañca lokassa, āhāratthañca phareyya, na ca oḷāriko āhāro paññāyeyyā’’ti? Atha kho bhagavato etadahosi – ‘‘imāni kho pañca bhesajjāni, seyyathidaṃ – sappi, navanītaṃ, telaṃ, madhu, phāṇitaṃ; bhesajjāni ceva bhesajjasammatāni ca lokassa, āhāratthañca pharanti, na ca oḷāriko āhāro paññāyati. Yaṃnūnāhaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ imāni pañca bhesajjāni anujāneyyaṃ, kāle paṭiggahetvā kāle paribhuñjitu’’nti. Atha kho bhagavā sāyanhasamayaṃ paṭisallānā vuṭṭhito etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘idha mayhaṃ, bhikkhave, rahogatassa paṭisallīnassa evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – ‘etarahi kho bhikkhūnaṃ sāradikena ābādhena phuṭṭhānaṃ yāgupi pītā uggacchati, bhattampi bhuttaṃ uggacchati. Te tena kisā honti, lūkhā, dubbaṇṇā, uppaṇḍuppaṇḍukajātā, dhamanisanthatagattā. Kiṃ nu kho ahaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ bhesajjaṃ anujāneyyaṃ, yaṃ bhesajjañceva assa bhesajjasammatañca lokassa, āhāratthañca phareyya, na ca oḷāriko āhāro paññāyeyyā’ti. Tassa mayhaṃ, bhikkhave, etadahosi ‘imāni kho pañca bhesajjāni, seyyathidaṃ – sappi, navanītaṃ, telaṃ, madhu, phāṇitaṃ; bhesajjāni ceva bhesajjasammatāni ca lokassa, āhāratthañca pharanti, na ca oḷāriko āhāro paññāyati. Yaṃnūnāhaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ imāni pañca bhesajjāni anujāneyyaṃ, kāle paṭiggahetvā kāle paribhuñjitu’nti. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, tāni pañca bhesajjāni kāle paṭiggahetvā kāle paribhuñjitu’’nti.

260.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi, in Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. Now at that time the monks, afflicted with a seasonal illness, found that even the gruel they drank was vomited, and the food they ate was vomited. They became thin, haggard, ill-favored, pale and yellowish, with veins spread over their bodies. The Blessed One saw those monks thin, haggard, ill-favored, pale and yellowish, with veins spread over their bodies. Having seen them, he addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, why are the monks now so thin, haggard, ill-favored, pale and yellowish, with veins spread over their bodies?” “Venerable sir, nowadays the monks are afflicted with a seasonal illness. Even the gruel they drink is vomited, and the food they eat is vomited. That is why they are thin, haggard, ill-favored, pale and yellowish, with veins spread over their bodies.” Then, as the Blessed One was alone in retreat, this thought arose in his mind: “Nowadays the monks are afflicted with a seasonal illness. Even the gruel they drink is vomited, and the food they eat is vomited. They have become thin, haggard, ill-favored, pale and yellowish, with veins spread over their bodies. What medicine should I allow the monks, that would be medicine and considered medicine by the world, be conducive to nourishment, and not appear as coarse food?” Then it occurred to the Blessed One: “These five medicines—ghee, fresh butter, oil, honey, and molasses—are medicines and are considered medicines by the world, are conducive to nourishment, and do not appear as coarse food. Why don’t I allow the monks these five medicines, to be received at the proper time and consumed at the proper time?” Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from retreat and, on this occasion, in connection with this matter, delivered a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Here, monks, as I was alone in retreat, this thought arose in my mind: ‘Nowadays the monks are afflicted with a seasonal illness. Even the gruel they drink is vomited, and the food they eat is vomited. They have become thin, haggard, ill-favored, pale and yellowish, with veins spread over their bodies. What medicine should I allow the monks, that would be medicine and considered medicine by the world, be conducive to nourishment, and not appear as coarse food?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘These five medicines—ghee, fresh butter, oil, honey, and molasses—are medicines and are considered medicines by the world, are conducive to nourishment, and do not appear as coarse food. Why don’t I allow the monks these five medicines, to be received at the proper time and consumed at the proper time?’ Monks, I allow these five medicines to be received at the proper time and consumed at the proper time.”

261. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū tāni pañca bhesajjāni kāle paṭiggahetvā kāle paribhuñjanti. Tesaṃ yānipi tāni pākatikāni lūkhāni bhojanāni tānipi nacchādenti, pageva senesitāni [senesikāni (sī. syā.), senehikāni (yojanā)]. Te tena ceva sāradikena ābādhena phuṭṭhā, iminā ca bhattācchādakena [bhattācchannakena (ka.)], tadubhayena bhiyyosomattāya kisā honti, lūkhā, dubbaṇṇā, uppaṇḍuppaṇḍukajātā, dhamanisanthatagattā. Addasā kho bhagavā te bhikkhū bhiyyosomattāya kise lūkhe dubbaṇṇe uppaṇḍuppaṇḍukajāte dhamanisanthatagatte, disvāna āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ āmantesi – ‘‘kiṃ nu kho, ānanda, etarahi bhikkhū bhiyyosomattāya kisā, lūkhā, dubbaṇṇā, uppaṇḍuppaṇḍukajātā, dhamanisanthatagattā’’ti? ‘‘Etarahi, bhante, bhikkhū tāni ca pañca bhesajjāni kāle paṭiggahetvā kāle paribhuñjanti. Tesaṃ yānipi tāni pākatikāni lūkhāni bhojanāni tānipi nacchādenti, pageva senesikāni. Te tena ceva sāradikena ābādhena phuṭṭhā, iminā ca bhattācchādakena, tadubhayena bhiyyosomattāya kisā, lūkhā, dubbaṇṇā, uppaṇḍuppaṇḍukajātā, dhamanisanthatagattā’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, tāni pañca bhesajjāni paṭiggahetvā kālepi vikālepi paribhuñjitu’’nti.

261.At that time, the monks, having received the five medicines at the proper time, consumed them at the proper time. Even the coarse, natural foods they did not digest, let alone the rich ones. Afflicted by that seasonal illness and this lack of appetite for food, they became excessively thin, haggard, ill-favored, pale and yellowish, with veins spread over their bodies. The Blessed One saw those monks who were excessively thin, haggard, ill-favored, pale and yellowish, with veins spread over their bodies. Having seen them, he addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, why are the monks now so excessively thin, haggard, ill-favored, pale and yellowish, with veins spread over their bodies?” “Venerable sir, nowadays the monks, having received the five medicines at the proper time, consume them at the proper time. Even the coarse, natural foods they do not digest, let alone the rich ones. Afflicted by that seasonal illness and this lack of appetite for food, they have become excessively thin, haggard, ill-favored, pale and yellowish, with veins spread over their bodies.” Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, in connection with this matter, delivered a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow these five medicines to be received and consumed both at the proper time and at the improper time.”

262. Tena kho pana samayena gilānānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ vasehi bhesajjehi attho hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, vasāni bhesajjāni – acchavasaṃ, macchavasaṃ, susukāvasaṃ, sūkaravasaṃ, gadrabhavasaṃ – kāle paṭiggahitaṃ kāle nippakkaṃ [nipakkaṃ (ka.)] kāle saṃsaṭṭhaṃ telaparibhogena paribhuñjituṃ. Vikāle ce, bhikkhave, paṭiggahitaṃ vikāle nippakkaṃ vikāle saṃsaṭṭhaṃ, taṃ ce paribhuñjeyya, āpatti tiṇṇaṃ dukkaṭānaṃ. Kāle ce, bhikkhave, paṭiggahitaṃ vikāle nippakkaṃ vikāle saṃsaṭṭhaṃ, taṃ ce paribhuñjeyya, āpatti dvinnaṃ dukkaṭānaṃ. Kāle ce, bhikkhave, paṭiggahitaṃ kāle nippakkaṃ vikāle saṃsaṭṭhaṃ, taṃ ce paribhuñjeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Kāle ce, bhikkhave, paṭiggahitaṃ kāle nippakkaṃ kāle saṃsaṭṭhaṃ, taṃ ce paribhuñjeyya, anāpattīti.

262.Now at that time sick monks had need of medicines made with animal fat. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow these animal fats as medicines—rendered fat from bear, rendered fat from fish, rendered fat from crocodile, rendered fat from pig, and rendered fat from donkey—if received at the proper time, cooked at the proper time, and mixed at the proper time, to be consumed with oil. If, monks, it is received at the wrong time, cooked at the wrong time, or mixed at the wrong time, if he consumes it, there is an offense of three dukkaṭas. If, monks, it is received at the proper time but cooked at the wrong time or mixed at the wrong time, if he consumes it, there is an offense of two dukkaṭas. If, monks, it is received at the proper time and cooked at the proper time but mixed at the wrong time, if he consumes it, there is an offense of a dukkaṭa. If, monks, it is received at the proper time, cooked at the proper time, and mixed at the proper time, if he consumes it, there is no offense.”

Pañcabhesajjakathā niṭṭhitā.

The Discourse on the Five Medicines is concluded.

161.The Discussion on Medicines Consisting of Roots, and So Forth

263. Tena kho pana samayena gilānānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ mūlehi bhesajjehi attho hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, mūlāni bhesajjāni – haliddiṃ, siṅgiveraṃ, vacaṃ, vacatthaṃ [vacatthaṃ (sī. syā.)], ativisaṃ, kaṭukarohiṇiṃ, usīraṃ, bhaddamuttakaṃ, yāni vā panaññānipi atthi mūlāni bhesajjāni, neva khādanīye khādanīyatthaṃ pharanti, na bhojanīye bhojanīyatthaṃ pharanti, tāni – paṭiggahetvā yāvajīvaṃ pariharituṃ; sati paccaye paribhuñjituṃ. Asati paccaye paribhuñjantassa āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

263.At that time, sick monks needed medicines made from roots. They informed the Blessed One about this matter. “Monks, I allow root medicines—turmeric, ginger, orris root, sweet flag, ativisa, kaṭukarohiṇī, usīra, bhaddamuttaka, or any other root medicines that do not serve as food for eating nor as food for consuming—to be received and kept for as long as one lives.

Asati paccaye paribhuñjantassa āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

At that time, sick monks needed medicines of astringent flavors. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow astringent medicines—neem astringent, kuṭaja astringent, paṭola astringent, phaggava astringent, nattamāla astringent, or any other astringent medicines that do not serve as food for eating nor as food for consuming—to be received and kept for as long as one lives. They may be used when there is a reason. If one uses them without a reason, there is an offense of wrong-doing.”

Tena kho pana samayena gilānānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ paṇṇehi bhesajjehi attho hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, paṇṇāni bhesajjāni – nimbapaṇṇaṃ, kuṭajapaṇṇaṃ, paṭolapaṇṇaṃ, sulasipaṇṇaṃ, kappāsapaṇṇaṃ, yāni vā panaññānipi atthi paṇṇāni bhesajjāni, neva khādanīye khādanīyatthaṃ pharanti, na bhojanīye bhojanīyatthaṃ pharanti…pe….

Tena kho pana samayena gilānānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ phalehi bhesajjehi attho hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

At that time, sick monks needed resins as medicine. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow resins as medicine—asafoetida, hiṅgujatu, hiṅgusipāṭikā, taka, takapatti, takapaṇṇī, sajjulasa, or any other resins that are medicine, that do not serve as food for eating….”

Tena kho pana samayena gilānānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ loṇehi bhesajjehi attho hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, loṇāni bhesajjāni – sāmuddaṃ, kāḷaloṇaṃ, sindhavaṃ, ubbhidaṃ [ubbhiraṃ (ka.)], bilaṃ [biḷālaṃ (sī.)], yāni vā panaññānipi atthi loṇāni bhesajjāni, neva khādanīye khādanīyatthaṃ pharanti, na bhojanīye bhojanīyatthaṃ pharanti, tāni – paṭiggahetvā yāvajīvaṃ pariharituṃ; sati paccaye paribhuñjituṃ. Asati paccaye paribhuñjantassa āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

At that time, sick monks needed salts as medicine. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow medicinal salts—sea salt, black salt, rock salt, ubbhida salt, bila salt, or any other medicinal salts that do not serve as food for eating nor as food for consuming—to be received and kept for as long as one lives. They may be used when there is a reason. If one uses them without a reason, there is an offense of wrong-doing.”

264. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmato ānandassa upajjhāyassa āyasmato belaṭṭhasīsassa thullakacchābādho hoti. Tassa lasikāya cīvarāni kāye lagganti, tāni bhikkhū udakena temetvā temetvā apakaḍḍhanti. Addasā kho bhagavā senāsanacārikaṃ āhiṇḍanto te bhikkhū tāni cīvarāni udakena temetvā temetvā apakaḍḍhante, disvāna yena te bhikkhū tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā te bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘kiṃ imassa, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno ābādho’’ti? ‘‘Imassa, bhante, āyasmato thullakacchābādho, lasikāya cīvarāni kāye lagganti, tāni mayaṃ udakena temetvā temetvā apakaḍḍhāmā’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, yassa kaṇḍu vā, piḷakā vā, assāvo vā, thullakacchu vā ābādho, kāyo vā duggandho, cuṇṇāni bhesajjāni; agilānassa chakaṇaṃ mattikaṃ rajananippakkaṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, udukkhalaṃ musala’’nti.

264.At that time, Venerable Ānanda’s preceptor, Venerable Belaṭṭhasīsa, was suffering from a severe skin disease. His robes were sticking to his body due to the pus, and the monks were repeatedly soaking them in water and pulling them off. The Blessed One, while walking around the lodgings, saw those monks repeatedly soaking the robes in water and pulling them off. Seeing this, he approached them and asked, “Monks, what is the illness of this monk?” “Venerable sir, this venerable one has a severe skin disease. His robes are sticking to his body due to the pus, so we are repeatedly soaking them in water and pulling them off.” Then, on this occasion, the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow medicinal powders for one who has itching, boils, discharges, severe skin disease, or a foul-smelling body. For one who is not ill, I allow cow dung, clay, or dye refuse. Monks, I allow a mortar and a pestle.”

Tena kho pana samayena gilānānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ cuṇṇehi bhesajjehi cālitehi attho hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, cuṇṇacālininti. Saṇhehi attho hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, dussacālininti.

At that time, sick monks needed medicinal powders sifted with a sieve. They informed the Blessed One of this matter. “Monks, I allow a powder sieve.” They needed something for sifting fine materials. They informed the Blessed One of this matter. “Monks, I allow a cloth sieve.”

Tena kho pana samayena aññatarassa bhikkhuno amanussikābādho hoti. Taṃ ācariyupajjhāyā upaṭṭhahantā nāsakkhiṃsu arogaṃ kātuṃ. So sūkarasūnaṃ gantvā āmakamaṃsaṃ khādi, āmakalohitaṃ pivi. Tassa so amanussikābādho paṭippassambhi. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, amanussikābādhe āmakamaṃsaṃ āmakalohitanti.

At that time, a certain monk had a disease caused by non-human beings. His teachers and preceptors, attending to him, were unable to make him well. He went to a pig slaughterer, ate raw meat, and drank raw blood. That disease caused by non-human beings subsided for him. They informed the Blessed One of this matter. “Monks, I allow raw meat and raw blood for a disease caused by non-human beings.”

265. Tena kho pana samayena aññatarassa bhikkhuno cakkhurogābādho hoti. Taṃ bhikkhū pariggahetvā uccārampi passāvampi nikkhāmenti. Addasā kho bhagavā senāsanacārikaṃ āhiṇḍanto te bhikkhū taṃ bhikkhuṃ pariggahetvā uccārampi passāvampi nikkhāmente, disvāna yena te bhikkhū tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā te bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘kiṃ imassa, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno ābādho’’ti? ‘‘Imassa, bhante, āyasmato cakkhurogābādho. Imaṃ mayaṃ pariggahetvā uccārampi passāvampi nikkhāmemā’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, añjanaṃ – kāḷañjanaṃ, rasañjanaṃ, sotañjanaṃ, gerukaṃ, kapalla’’nti. Añjanūpapisanehi attho hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, candanaṃ, tagaraṃ, kāḷānusāriyaṃ, tālīsaṃ, bhaddamuttakanti. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū piṭṭhāni añjanāni carukesupi [thālakesupi (sī. syā.)] sarāvakesupi nikkhipanti; tiṇacuṇṇehipi paṃsukehipi okiriyanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, añjaninti.

265.At that time, a certain monk was suffering from an eye disease. The monks attended to him and helped him relieve himself, both feces and urine. The Blessed One, while walking around the lodgings, saw those monks attending to that monk as he relieved himself, both feces and urine. Having seen them, he approached those monks and asked, “Monks, what is the ailment of this monk?” “Venerable sir, this venerable one has an eye disease. We are attending to him as he relieves himself, both feces and urine.” Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow eye ointments—black ointment, compound ointment, antimony ointment, red ochre, and soot.” There was a need for things to be ground together with the ointment. They informed the Blessed One of this matter. “Monks, I allow sandalwood, tagara, black collyrium, tālīsa, and bhaddamuttaka.” At that time, monks placed ground ointments in small bowls or on trays. They were scattered by grass dust or dirt. They informed the Blessed One of this matter. “Monks, I allow an ointment container.”

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū uccāvacā añjaniyo dhārenti – sovaṇṇamayaṃ, rūpiyamayaṃ. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘seyyathāpi gihī kāmabhogino’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, uccāvacā añjanī dhāretabbā. Yo dhāreyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, aṭṭhimayaṃ, dantamayaṃ, visāṇamayaṃ, naḷamayaṃ, veḷumayaṃ, kaṭṭhamayaṃ, jatumayaṃ, phalamayaṃ, lohamayaṃ, saṅkhanābhimayanti.

At that time, the monks of the group of six were carrying various kinds of ointment containers—made of gold, made of silver. People complained, criticized, and spread it about: “Just like householders indulging in sensual pleasures.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, various kinds of ointment containers should not be carried. Whoever carries one incurs an offense of wrong-doing. Monks, I allow those made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal, or shell.”

Tena kho pana samayena añjaniyo apārutā honti, tiṇacuṇṇehipi paṃsukehipi okiriyanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, apidhānanti. Apidhānaṃ nipatati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, suttakena bandhitvā añjaniyā bandhitunti. Añjanī phalati [nipatati (ka.)]. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, suttakena sibbetunti.

At that time, the ointment pots were open and got scattered with grass dust and dirt. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow a cover.” The cover fell off. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow tying it with a thread to the ointment pot.” The ointment pot broke. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow sewing it with a thread.”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū aṅguliyā añjanti, akkhīni dukkhāni honti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, añjanisalākanti.

At that time, monks were applying ointment with their fingers, and their eyes became sore. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow an ointment applicator.”

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū uccāvacā añjanisalākāyo dhārenti – sovaṇṇamayaṃ rūpiyamayaṃ. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti, ‘‘seyyathāpi gihī kāmabhogino’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, uccāvacā añjanisalākā dhāretabbā. Yo dhāreyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, aṭṭhimayaṃ…pe… saṅkhanābhimayanti.

At that time, the monks of the group of six were carrying various kinds of ointment applicators—made of gold, made of silver.

162.The Story of Pilindavaccha

270. [idaṃ vatthu pārā. 618 ādayo] Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā pilindavaccho rājagahe pabbhāraṃ sodhāpeti leṇaṃ kattukāmo. Atha kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro yenāyasmā pilindavaccho tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ pilindavacchaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro āyasmantaṃ pilindavacchaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kiṃ, bhante, thero kārāpetī’’ti? ‘‘Pabbhāraṃ, mahārāja, sodhāpemi, leṇaṃ kattukāmo’’ti. ‘‘Attho, bhante, ayyassa ārāmikenā’’ti? ‘‘Na kho, mahārāja, bhagavatā ārāmiko anuññāto’’ti. ‘‘Tena hi, bhante, bhagavantaṃ paṭipucchitvā mama āroceyyāthā’’ti. ‘Evaṃ, mahārājā’ti kho āyasmā pilindavaccho rañño māgadhassa seniyassa bimbisārassa paccassosi. Atha kho āyasmā pilindavaccho rājānaṃ māgadhaṃ seniyaṃ bimbisāraṃ dhammiyā kathāya sandassesi, samādapesi, samuttejesi, sampahaṃsesi. Atha kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro āyasmatā pilindavacchena dhammiyā kathāya sandassito samādapito samuttejito sampahaṃsito uṭṭhāyāsanā āyasmantaṃ pilindavacchaṃ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṃ katvā pakkāmi.

270.Now at that time the Venerable Pilindavaccha was having a slope cleared at Rājagaha, wanting to make a dwelling. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha approached the Venerable Pilindavaccha, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha said to the Venerable Pilindavaccha: “What is the elder having done, venerable sir?” “Great king, I am having a slope cleared, wanting to make a dwelling.” “Does the venerable one need a monastery worker, venerable sir?” “Great king, a monastery worker has not been allowed by the Blessed One.” “Then, venerable sir, please ask the Blessed One and inform me.” “Yes, great king,” the Venerable Pilindavaccha replied to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha. Then the Venerable Pilindavaccha instructed, urged, inspired, and gladdened King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha with a Dhamma talk. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, having been instructed, urged, inspired, and gladdened by the Venerable Pilindavaccha with a Dhamma talk, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Venerable Pilindavaccha, circumambulated him, and departed.

Atha kho āyasmā pilindavaccho bhagavato santike dūtaṃ pāhesi – ‘‘rājā, bhante, māgadho seniyo bimbisāro ārāmikaṃ dātukāmo. Kathaṃ nu kho, bhante, mayā paṭipajjitabba’’nti? Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, ārāmika’’nti. Dutiyampi kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro yenāyasmā pilindavaccho tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ pilindavacchaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro āyasmantaṃ pilindavacchaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘anuññāto, bhante, bhagavatā ārāmiko’’ti? ‘‘Evaṃ, mahārājā’’ti. ‘‘Tena hi, bhante, ayyassa ārāmikaṃ dammī’’ti. Atha kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro āyasmato pilindavacchassa ārāmikaṃ paṭissutvā, vissaritvā, cirena satiṃ paṭilabhitvā, aññataraṃ sabbatthakaṃ mahāmattaṃ āmantesi – ‘‘yo mayā, bhaṇe, ayyassa ārāmiko paṭissuto, dinno so ārāmiko’’ti? ‘‘Na kho, deva, ayyassa ārāmiko dinno’’ti. ‘‘Kīva ciraṃ nu kho, bhaṇe, ito [ito ratti (syā.)] hi taṃ hotī’’ti? Atha kho so mahāmatto rattiyo gaṇetvā [vigaṇetvā (sī.)] rājānaṃ māgadhaṃ seniyaṃ bimbisāraṃ etadavoca – ‘‘pañca, deva, rattisatānī’’ti. Tena hi, bhaṇe, ayyassa pañca ārāmikasatāni dehīti. ‘‘Evaṃ, devā’’ti kho so mahāmatto rañño māgadhassa seniyassa bimbisārassa paṭissutvā āyasmato pilindavacchassa pañca ārāmikasatāni pādāsi, pāṭiyekko gāmo nivisi. ‘Ārāmikagāmakoti’pi naṃ āhaṃsu, ‘pilindagāmako’tipi naṃ āhaṃsu.

Then Venerable Pilindavaccha sent a messenger to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha wishes to give a monastery attendant. How should I proceed, venerable sir?” Then the Blessed One, having given a Dhamma talk on this occasion and in connection with this matter, addressed the monks: “I allow, monks, a monastery attendant.” A second time, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha approached Venerable Pilindavaccha; having approached, he paid homage to Venerable Pilindavaccha and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha said to Venerable Pilindavaccha, “Has a monastery attendant been permitted by the Blessed One, venerable sir?” “Yes, great king.” “Then, venerable sir, I will give a monastery attendant to the venerable one.” Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, having promised a monastery attendant to Venerable Pilindavaccha, forgot about it and only remembered after a long time. He then addressed a certain general official: “Good man, was the monastery attendant I promised to the venerable one given?” “No, sire, the monastery attendant was not given to the venerable one.” “How long has it been, good man, since that happened?” Then that official counted the nights and said to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, “Five hundred nights, sire.” “Then, good man, give the venerable one five hundred monastery attendants.” “Yes, sire,” the official replied to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and gave Venerable Pilindavaccha five hundred monastery attendants. A separate village was established for each one. They called it ‘Ārāmikagāmaka’ (Monastery Attendant Village) and also ‘Pilindagāmaka’ (Pilinda’s Village).

271. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā pilindavaccho tasmiṃ gāmake kulūpako hoti. Atha kho āyasmā pilindavaccho pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya pilindagāmaṃ piṇḍāya pāvisi. Tena kho pana samayena tasmiṃ gāmake ussavo hoti. Dārakā alaṅkatā mālākitā kīḷanti. Atha kho āyasmā pilindavaccho pilindagāmake sapadānaṃ piṇḍāya caramāno yena aññatarassa ārāmikassa nivesanaṃ tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi. Tena kho pana samayena tassā ārāmikiniyā dhītā aññe dārake alaṅkate mālākite passitvā rodati – ‘mālaṃ me detha, alaṅkāraṃ me dethā’ti. Atha kho āyasmā pilindavaccho taṃ ārāmikiniṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kissāyaṃ dārikā rodatī’’ti? ‘‘Ayaṃ, bhante, dārikā aññe dārake alaṅkate mālākite passitvā rodati – ‘mālaṃ me detha, alaṅkāraṃ me dethā’ti. Kuto amhākaṃ duggatānaṃ mālā, kuto alaṅkāro’’ti? Atha kho āyasmā pilindavaccho aññataraṃ tiṇaṇḍupakaṃ gahetvā taṃ ārāmikiniṃ etadavoca – ‘‘handimaṃ tiṇaṇḍupakaṃ tassā dārikāya sīse paṭimuñcā’’ti. Atha kho sā ārāmikinī taṃ tiṇaṇḍupakaṃ gahetvā tassā dārikāya sīse paṭimuñci. Sā ahosi suvaṇṇamālā abhirūpā, dassanīyā, pāsādikā; natthi tādisā raññopi antepure suvaṇṇamālā. Manussā rañño māgadhassa seniyassa bimbisārassa ārocesuṃ – ‘‘amukassa, deva, ārāmikassa ghare suvaṇṇamālā abhirūpā, dassanīyā, pāsādikā; natthi tādisā devassapi antepure suvaṇṇamālā; kuto tassa duggatassa? Nissaṃsayaṃ corikāya ābhatā’’ti.

271.Now at that time, Venerable Pilindavaccha was a frequent guest in that village. Then, Venerable Pilindavaccha, having dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe and entered Pilindavillage for alms. Now at that time, there was a festival in that village. Children, adorned and garlanded, were playing. Then, Venerable Pilindavaccha, walking for alms from house to house in Pilindavillage, approached the dwelling of a certain groundskeeper and sat down on the prepared seat. Now at that time, the daughter of that groundskeeper, seeing other children adorned and garlanded, cried: “Give me a garland! Give me ornaments!” Then, Venerable Pilindavaccha said to that groundskeeper: “Why is this girl crying?” “Venerable sir, this girl sees other children adorned and garlanded and cries: ‘Give me a garland! Give me ornaments!’ But where would we poor people get garlands or ornaments?” Then, Venerable Pilindavaccha took a small bunch of grass and said to that groundskeeper: “Here, place this small bunch of grass on the girl’s head.” Then, that groundskeeper took the small bunch of grass and placed it on the girl’s head. It became a golden garland—beautiful, lovely, and pleasing. There was no such golden garland even in King Bimbisāra’s inner palace. People informed King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha: “Sire, in the house of such-and-such a groundskeeper, there is a golden garland—beautiful, lovely, and pleasing. There is no such golden garland even in your inner palace. How could such a poor person have it? Surely, it must have been obtained by theft!”

Atha kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro taṃ ārāmikakulaṃ bandhāpesi. Dutiyampi kho āyasmā pilindavaccho pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya pilindagāmaṃ piṇḍāya pāvisi. Pilindagāmake sapadānaṃ piṇḍāya caramāno yena tassa ārāmikassa nivesanaṃ tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā paṭivissake pucchi – ‘‘kahaṃ imaṃ ārāmikakulaṃ gata’’nti? ‘‘Etissā, bhante, suvaṇṇamālāya kāraṇā raññā bandhāpita’’nti. Atha kho āyasmā pilindavaccho yena rañño māgadhassa seniyassa bimbisārassa nivesanaṃ tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi. Atha kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro yenāyasmā pilindavaccho tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ pilindavacchaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho rājānaṃ māgadhaṃ seniyaṃ bimbisāraṃ āyasmā pilindavaccho etadavoca – ‘‘kissa, mahārāja, ārāmikakulaṃ bandhāpita’’nti? ‘‘Tassa, bhante, ārāmikassa ghare suvaṇṇamālā abhirūpā, dassanīyā, pāsādikā; natthi tādisā amhākampi antepure suvaṇṇamālā; kuto tassa duggatassa? Nissaṃsayaṃ corikāya ābhatā’’ti. Atha kho āyasmā pilindavaccho rañño māgadhassa seniyassa bimbisārassa pāsādaṃ suvaṇṇanti adhimucci; so ahosi sabbasovaṇṇamayo. ‘‘Idaṃ pana te, mahārāja, tāva bahuṃ suvaṇṇaṃ kuto’’ti? ‘Aññātaṃ, bhante, ayyasseveso iddhānubhāvo’ti taṃ ārāmikakulaṃ muñcāpesi.

Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha had that groundskeeper’s family arrested. A second time, Venerable Pilindavaccha, having dressed in the morning and taken his bowl and robe, entered Pilindagāma for alms. Wandering for alms from house to house in Pilindagāma, he approached the dwelling of that groundskeeper. Having approached, he asked the neighbors, “Where has this groundskeeper’s family gone?” “Because of that golden garland, venerable sir, the king had them arrested.” Then Venerable Pilindavaccha approached the dwelling of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha. Having approached, he sat down on the prepared seat. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha approached Venerable Pilindavaccha; having approached, he paid homage to Venerable Pilindavaccha and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, King Seniya Bimbisāra was addressed by Venerable Pilindavaccha: “Great king, why was the groundskeeper’s family arrested?” “Venerable sir, in that groundskeeper’s house was a golden garland—beautiful, lovely, splendid. There is no such golden garland even in our inner palace; how much less for that poor man? Surely it was brought by theft.” Then Venerable Pilindavaccha willed King Seniya Bimbisāra’s palace to be golden; it was entirely golden. “But great king, where did this much gold of yours come from?” “It is unknown, venerable sir. This is the venerable one’s psychic power.” And he had that groundskeeper’s family released.

Taṃ atikkāmayato yathādhammo kāretabbo’’ti.

The people, delighted and full of faith, [thinking,] 'It seems the venerable Pilindavaccha has displayed a superhuman state, a miracle of psychic power, before the royal assembly,' offered five kinds of medicine to Venerable Pilindavaccha: namely, ghee, fresh butter, oil, honey, and molasses. By nature, Venerable Pilindavaccha was accustomed to receiving these five medicines. Whatever he received, he distributed to his retinue. His retinue was numerous; whatever they received, they stored in pots and jars, filling them up and putting them aside. They even filled strainers and bags, hanging them in the windows. These items remained sticky and melted. Even the dwellings became scattered and strewn about by rats. People wandering around the monastery saw this and complained, grumbled, and criticized, 'These Sakyan ascetics are like householders who store up provisions, just like King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha!' The monks heard these people complaining, grumbling, and criticizing. Those monks who were of few desires complained, grumbled, and criticized, 'How can the monks be intent on such abundance?' Then those monks, after rebuking them in many ways, reported the matter to the Blessed One… 'Is it true, monks, that the monks are intent on such abundance?' 'It is true, Blessed One.' … After rebuking them and giving a Dhamma talk, the Blessed One addressed the monks: 'Medicines to be taken by sick monks—namely, ghee, fresh butter, oil, honey, and molasses—may be accepted and consumed as a store for a maximum of seven days. Anyone who exceeds this limit is to be dealt with according to the rule.'

Pilindavacchavatthu niṭṭhitaṃ.

The story of Pilindavaccha is concluded.

The first section on permitted medicines is concluded.

272.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Sāvatthī as long as he pleased, set out on a journey toward Rājagaha. On the way, Venerable Kaṅkhārevata saw them making molasses and observed them adding flour and ash to the molasses. Seeing this, he thought, 'This molasses is impure; it is not permissible to consume molasses at the wrong time,' and, being scrupulous, he and his group did not consume the molasses. Those who thought they should listen to him also did not consume the molasses. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. 'For what purpose, bhikkhus, do they add flour and ash to the molasses?' 'For firmness, Blessed One.' 'If, bhikkhus, they add flour and ash to the molasses for firmness, and it is still reckoned as molasses, I allow you, bhikkhus, to consume molasses as you please.'

The Venerable Kaṅkhārevata saw mung beans growing in excrement by the roadside. Upon seeing it, he thought, 'These mung beans are unallowable; even ripe mung beans sprout,' and, being scrupulous, he and his group did not consume the mung beans. Those who thought they should listen to him also did not consume the mung beans. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. 'If, monks, even ripe mung beans sprout, I allow you, monks, to consume the mung beans as you please.'

273.Now at that time a certain monk had an abdominal wind ailment. He drank salt-sour gruel. That abdominal wind ailment subsided for him. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. 'I allow, monks, salt-sour gruel for the sick; for the healthy, it may be consumed as a drink mixed with water.'

Guḷādianujānanā niṭṭhitā.

The allowance for molasses, etc., is concluded.

164.The Discussion on the Prohibition of What is Husked Inside, and So Forth

274. Atha kho bhagavā anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena rājagahaṃ tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā rājagahe viharati veḷuvane kalandakanivāpe. Tena kho pana samayena bhagavato udaravātābādho hoti. Atha kho āyasmā ānando – ‘pubbepi bhagavato udaravātābādho tekaṭulayāguyā phāsu hotī’ti – sāmaṃ tilampi, taṇḍulampi, muggampi viññāpetvā, anto vāsetvā, anto sāmaṃ pacitvā bhagavato upanāmesi – ‘‘pivatu bhagavā tekaṭulayāgu’’nti. Jānantāpi tathāgatā pucchanti, jānantāpi na pucchanti; kālaṃ viditvā pucchanti, kālaṃ viditvā na pucchanti; atthasaṃhitaṃ tathāgatā pucchanti, no anatthasaṃhitaṃ. Anatthasaṃhite setughāto tathāgatānaṃ. Dvīhi ākārehi buddhā bhagavanto bhikkhū paṭipucchanti – dhammaṃ vā desessāma, sāvakānaṃ vā sikkhāpadaṃ paññapessāmāti. Atha kho bhagavā āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ āmantesi – ‘‘kutāyaṃ, ānanda, yāgū’’ti? Atha kho āyasmā ānando bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesi. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā – ‘ananucchavikaṃ, ānanda, ananulomikaṃ, appatirūpaṃ, assāmaṇakaṃ, akappiyaṃ, akaraṇīyaṃ. Kathañhi nāma tvaṃ, ānanda, evarūpāya bāhullāya cetessasi. Yadapi, ānanda, anto vuṭṭhaṃ [vutthaṃ (sī. syā. ka.)] tadapi akappiyaṃ; yadapi anto pakkaṃ tadapi akappiyaṃ; yadapi sāmaṃ pakkaṃ, tadapi akappiyaṃ. Netaṃ, ānanda, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… vigarahitvā dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, anto vuṭṭhaṃ, anto pakkaṃ, sāmaṃ pakkaṃ paribhuñjitabbaṃ. Yo paribhuñjeya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anto ce, bhikkhave, vuṭṭhaṃ, anto pakkaṃ, sāmaṃ pakkaṃ tañce paribhuñjeyya, āpatti tiṇṇaṃ dukkaṭānaṃ.

274.Then the Blessed One, wandering by degrees, arrived at Rājagaha. There the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Feeding Ground. At that time, the Blessed One was suffering from a wind ailment in his stomach. Then Venerable Ānanda—thinking, 'Previously, the Blessed One’s wind ailment in his stomach was relieved by a three-ingredient gruel'—personally requested sesame, rice, and mung beans, had them husked inside, and cooked them himself inside, and offered them to the Blessed One, saying, 'May the Blessed One drink this three-ingredient gruel.' The Tathāgatas ask questions knowing, and they do not ask questions knowing; they ask at the right time, and they do not ask questions at the wrong time. The Tathāgatas ask questions that are meaningful, not meaningless. For the Tathāgatas, meaningless talk is a barrier. The Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, question the monks in two ways: either to teach the Dhamma or to establish a training rule for the disciples. Then the Blessed One addressed Venerable Ānanda: 'Ānanda, where did this gruel come from?' Then Venerable Ānanda explained the matter to the Blessed One. The Blessed One rebuked him: 'Ānanda, this is unbefitting, unsuitable, inappropriate, unworthy of a contemplative, unallowable, and not to be done. How could you, Ānanda, intend such a profusion? Whatever is husked inside is unallowable; whatever is cooked inside is unallowable; whatever is cooked by oneself is unallowable. This, Ānanda, does not lead to the confidence of the unconfident…' Having rebuked him, the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: 'Monks, one should not consume what is husked inside, cooked inside, or cooked by oneself. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrongdoing. If, monks, something is husked inside, cooked inside, and cooked by oneself, and one consumes it, one commits three offenses of wrongdoing. If, monks, something is husked inside, cooked inside, and cooked by others, and one consumes it, one commits two offenses of wrongdoing. If, monks, something is husked inside, cooked outside, and cooked by oneself, and one consumes it, one commits two offenses of wrongdoing. If, monks, something is husked outside, cooked inside, and cooked by oneself, and one consumes it, one commits two offenses of wrongdoing. If, monks, something is husked inside, cooked outside, and cooked by others, and one consumes it, one commits an offense of wrongdoing. If, monks, something is husked outside, cooked inside, and cooked by others, and one consumes it, one commits an offense of wrongdoing. If, monks, something is husked outside, cooked outside, and cooked by oneself, and one consumes it, one commits an offense of wrongdoing. If, monks, something is husked outside, cooked outside, and cooked by others, and one consumes it, there is no offense.'

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū ‘‘bhagavatā sāmaṃpāko paṭikkhitto’’ti puna pāke kukkuccāyanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, puna pākaṃ pacitunti.

At that time, the monks, thinking, 'The Blessed One has prohibited cooking by oneself,' felt scruples about cooking again. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. 'Monks, I allow cooking again.'

Tena kho pana samayena rājagahaṃ dubbhikkhaṃ hoti. Manussā loṇampi, telampi, taṇḍulampi, khādanīyampi ārāmaṃ āharanti. Tāni bhikkhū bahi vāsenti; ukkapiṇḍakāpi khādanti, corāpi haranti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, anto vāsetunti. Anto vāsetvā bahi pācenti. Damakā parivārenti. Bhikkhū avissaṭṭhā paribhuñjanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, anto vuṭṭhaṃ, anto pakkaṃ, sāmaṃ pakkanti.

At that time, there was a famine in Rājagaha. People brought salt, oil, rice, and other food items to the monastery. The monks stored them outside; lumps of food were eaten by animals, and thieves stole them. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. 'Monks, I allow storing them inside.' After storing them inside, they cooked outside. Scavengers surrounded them. The monks consumed without being able to distribute it. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. 'Monks, I allow cooking inside.' During the famine, the attendants took more and gave less to the monks. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. 'Monks, I allow cooking by oneself.' 'Monks, I allow what is husked inside, cooked inside, and cooked by oneself.'

Antovuṭṭhādipaṭikkhepakathā niṭṭhitā.

The Discussion on the Prohibition of What is Husked Inside, and So Forth, is concluded.

165.Taking Up and Receiving

275. Tena kho pana samayena sambahulā bhikkhū kāsīsu vassaṃvuṭṭhā rājagahaṃ gacchantā bhagavantaṃ dassanāya antarāmagge na labhiṃsu lūkhassa vā paṇītassa vā bhojanassa yāvadatthaṃ pāripūriṃ; bahuñca phalakhādanīyaṃ ahosi; kappiyakārako ca na ahosi.

Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, uggahitaṃ paṭiggahitu’’nti.

275.At that time, a number of monks who had spent the Rains in Kāsi were traveling to Rājagaha to see the Blessed One. Along the way, they could not obtain a sufficient supply of either coarse or fine food, and there was much fruit to eat, but there was no steward to make it allowable. Then those monks, weary, approached the Blessed One at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Now it is the custom for the Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, to exchange greetings with newly arrived monks. Then the Blessed One said to those monks: “I hope, monks, you are keeping well, I hope you are comfortable, I hope you have come without too much fatigue on the journey. And from where, monks, have you come?” “We are keeping well, Blessed One, we are comfortable, Blessed One. Venerable sir, we spent the Rains in Kāsi and were traveling to Rājagaha to see the Blessed One. Along the way, we could not obtain a sufficient supply of either coarse or fine food, and there was much fruit to eat, but there was no steward to make it allowable. Thus we have come weary from the journey.” Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, on this ground, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: “I allow, monks, that where one sees fruit to eat and there is no steward, one may take it oneself, carry it away, and after seeing a steward, place it on the ground, have it formally received, and then consume it. I allow, monks, that what has been taken up may be formally received.”

276. Tena kho pana samayena aññatarassa brāhmaṇassa navā ca tilā navañca madhu uppannā honti. Atha kho tassa brāhmaṇassa etadahosi – ‘‘yaṃnūnāhaṃ nave ca tile navañca madhuṃ buddhappamukhassa bhikkhusaṅghassa dadeyya’’nti. Atha kho so brāhmaṇo yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavatā saddhiṃ paṭisammodi, sammodanīyaṃ kathaṃ sāraṇīyaṃ vītisāretvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi. Ekamantaṃ ṭhito kho so brāhmaṇo bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘adhivāsetu me bhavaṃ gotamo svātanāya bhattaṃ, saddhiṃ bhikkhusaṅghenā’’ti. Adhivāsesi bhagavā tuṇhībhāvena. Atha kho so brāhmaṇo bhagavato adhivāsanaṃ viditvā pakkāmi. Atha kho so brāhmaṇo tassā rattiyā accayena paṇītaṃ khādanīyaṃ bhojanīyaṃ paṭiyādāpetvā bhagavato kālaṃ ārocāpesi – ‘‘kālo, bho gotama, niṭṭhitaṃ bhatta’’nti. Atha kho bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena tassa brāhmaṇassa nivesanaṃ tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi, saddhiṃ bhikkhusaṅghena. Atha kho so brāhmaṇo buddhappamukhaṃ bhikkhusaṅghaṃ paṇītena khādanīyena bhojanīyena sahatthā santappetvā sampavāretvā bhagavantaṃ bhuttāviṃ onītapattapāṇiṃ ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho taṃ brāhmaṇaṃ bhagavā dhammiyā kathāya sandassetvā, samādapetvā, samuttejetvā, sampahaṃsetvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkāmi.

276.Now at that time, a certain brahmin had new sesame and new honey come into his possession. Then it occurred to that brahmin: 'Suppose I were to give the new sesame and new honey to the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha.' Then that brahmin approached the Blessed One, exchanged greetings with him, and after pleasant and courteous conversation, stood to one side. Standing to one side, that brahmin said to the Blessed One: 'May the Venerable Gotama accept my meal for tomorrow together with the Saṅgha of monks.' The Blessed One consented with silence. Then that brahmin, knowing the Blessed One's consent, departed. Then, at the end of that night, that brahmin had fine food, hard and soft, prepared and announced the time to the Blessed One: 'It is time, Venerable Gotama, the meal is ready.' Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, went to the residence of that brahmin. Having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Saṅgha of monks. Then that brahmin personally served and satisfied the Saṅgha of monks, headed by the Buddha, with fine food, hard and soft, and invited them to take their fill. When the Blessed One had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, the brahmin sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One instructed, roused, inspired, and gladdened that brahmin with a Dhamma talk. Then he rose from his seat and departed.

Atha kho tassa brāhmaṇassa acirapakkantassa bhagavato etadahosi – ‘‘yesaṃ kho mayā atthāya buddhappamukho bhikkhusaṅgho nimantito, ‘nave ca tile navañca madhuṃ dassāmī’ti, te mayā pamuṭṭhā dātuṃ. Yaṃnūnāhaṃ nave ca tile navañca madhuṃ kolambehi ca ghaṭehi ca ārāmaṃ harāpeyya’’nti. Atha kho so brāhmaṇo nave ca tile navañca madhuṃ kolambehi ca ghaṭehi ca ārāmaṃ harāpetvā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi. Ekamantaṃ ṭhito kho so brāhmaṇo bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘yesaṃ kho mayā, bho gotama, atthāya buddhappamukho bhikkhusaṅgho nimantito, ‘nave ca tile navañca madhuṃ dassāmī’ti, te mayā pamuṭṭhā dātuṃ. Paṭiggaṇhātu me bhavaṃ gotamo nave ca tile navañca madhu’’nti. Tena hi, brāhmaṇa, bhikkhūnaṃ dehīti. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū dubbhikkhe appamattakepi pavārenti, paṭisaṅkhāpi paṭikkhipanti, sabbo ca saṅgho pavārito hoti. Bhikkhū kukkuccāyantā na paṭiggaṇhanti. Paṭiggaṇhatha, bhikkhave, paribhuñjatha. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, tato nīhaṭaṃ bhuttāvinā pavāritena anatirittaṃ paribhuñjitunti.

Then, soon after the Blessed One had departed, it occurred to that brahmin: 'I invited the Saṅgha of monks with the Buddha at its head, intending to give new sesame and new honey, but I forgot to give them. Suppose I were to have the new sesame and new honey brought to the monastery in pails and jars.' Then that brahmin had new sesame and new honey brought to the monastery in pails and jars. He approached the Blessed One, stood to one side, and said: 'Venerable Gotama, I invited the Saṅgha of monks with the Buddha at its head, intending to give new sesame and new honey, but I forgot to give them. May the Venerable Gotama accept from me the new sesame and new honey.' 'Then, brahmin, give it to the monks.' Now at that time, during a famine, the monks were content with very little. They reflected and declined, and the entire Saṅgha had concluded their meal. The monks, being scrupulous, did not accept it. 'Accept it, monks, and consume it. I allow you, monks, to consume what is brought forth from that, even by one who has eaten and concluded the meal, provided it is not a surplus.'

166.Allowance concerning what has been received, and so forth

277. [pāci. 295] Tena kho pana samayena āyasmato upanandassa sakyaputtassa upaṭṭhākakulaṃ saṅghassatthāya khādanīyaṃ pāhesi – ayyassa upanandassa dassetvā saṅghassa dātabbanti. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā upanando sakyaputto gāmaṃ piṇḍāya paviṭṭho hoti. Atha kho te manussā ārāmaṃ gantvā bhikkhū pucchiṃsu – ‘‘kahaṃ, bhante, ayyo upanando’’ti? ‘‘Esāvuso, āyasmā upanando sakyaputto gāmaṃ piṇḍāya paviṭṭho’’ti. ‘‘Idaṃ, bhante, khādanīyaṃ ayyassa upanandassa dassetvā saṅghassa dātabba’’nti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Tena hi, bhikkhave, paṭiggahetvā nikkhipatha yāva upanando āgacchatīti. Atha kho āyasmā upanando sakyaputto purebhattaṃ kulāni payirupāsitvā divā āgacchati. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū dubbhikkhe appamattakepi pavārenti, paṭisaṅkhāpi paṭikkhipanti, sabbo ca saṅgho pavārito hoti, bhikkhū kukkuccāyantā na paṭiggaṇhanti. Paṭiggaṇhatha, bhikkhave, paribhuñjatha. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, purebhattaṃ paṭiggahitaṃ bhuttāvinā pavāritena anatirittaṃ paribhuñjitunti.

277.At that time, a lay supporter family of the Venerable Upananda the Sakyan sent some edibles for the Saṅgha, saying, “After showing them to the Venerable Upananda, they are to be given to the Saṅgha.” At that time, the Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had entered a village for alms. Then those people went to the monastery and asked the bhikkhus, “Where, sirs, is the Venerable Upananda?” “Friends, the Venerable Upananda the Sakyan has entered a village for alms.” “Sirs, these edibles are to be given to the Saṅgha after showing them to the Venerable Upananda.” They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Then, bhikkhus, receive it and put it aside until Upananda returns.” Then the Venerable Upananda the Sakyan, having visited families before the meal, returned during the day. At that time, during a famine, the bhikkhus would declare satisfaction even for small amounts, or decline after reflection, and the entire Saṅgha had made the declaration of satisfaction. The bhikkhus, being scrupulous, did not accept it. “Receive it, bhikkhus, and consume it. I allow, bhikkhus, that what was received before the meal may be consumed by one who has eaten and made the declaration of satisfaction, provided it is not leftover.”

278. Atha kho bhagavā rājagahe yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena sāvatthi tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena sāvatthi tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmato sāriputtassa kāyaḍāhābādho hoti.

Atha kho āyasmā mahāmoggallāno seyyathāpi nāma balavā puriso sammiñjitaṃ vā bāhaṃ pasāreyya, pasāritaṃ vā bāhaṃ samiñjeyya, evameva jetavane antarahito mandākiniyā pokkharaṇiyā tīre pāturahosi. Addasā kho aññataro nāgo āyasmantaṃ mahāmoggallānaṃ dūratova āgacchantaṃ, disvāna āyasmantaṃ mahāmoggallānaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘etu kho, bhante, ayyo mahāmoggallāno.

Atha kho āyasmā mahāmoggallāno – seyyathāpi nāma balavā puriso samiñjitaṃ vā bāhaṃ pasāreyya, pasāritaṃ vā bāhaṃ samiñjeyya, evameva – mandākiniyā pokkharaṇiyā tīre antarahito jetavane pāturahosi. Sopi kho nāgo mandākiniyā pokkharaṇiyā tīre antarahito jetavane pāturahosi. Atha kho so nāgo āyasmato mahāmoggallānassa bhise ca muḷālikāyo ca paṭiggahāpetvā jetavane antarahito mandākiniyā pokkharaṇiyā tīre pāturahosi.

Bahū bhisā ca muḷālikāyo ca avasiṭṭhā honti. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū dubbhikkhe appamattakepi pavārenti, paṭisaṅkhāpi paṭikkhipanti, sabbo ca saṅgho pavārito hoti. Bhikkhū kukkuccāyantā na paṭiggaṇhanti. Paṭiggaṇhatha, bhikkhave, paribhuñjatha. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, vanaṭṭhaṃ pokkharaṭṭhaṃ bhuttāvinā pavāritena anatirittaṃ paribhuñjitunti.

278.Then the Blessed One, having stayed in Rājagaha as long as he pleased, set out on a journey to Sāvatthī. Traveling in stages, he eventually arrived at Sāvatthī. There the Blessed One stayed in Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time, the Venerable Sāriputta was suffering from a bodily burning ailment. Then the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna approached the Venerable Sāriputta and said, “Friend Sāriputta, in the past, what brought you relief from this bodily burning ailment?” “Friend, lotus roots and stalks brought me relief.” Then the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna—just as a strong man might extend his bent arm or bend his extended arm—vanished from Jeta Grove and reappeared on the shore of the Mandākinī Pond. A certain nāga saw the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna approaching from afar and, having seen him, said to the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, “Come, venerable sir, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna! Welcome, venerable sir, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna! What do you need, venerable sir? What shall I give?” “Friend, I need lotus roots and stalks.” Then that nāga instructed another nāga, “Well then, friend, give the Venerable as many lotus roots and stalks as he needs.” Then that nāga entered the Mandākinī Pond, scooped up lotus roots and stalks with his trunk, thoroughly washed them, tied them into a bundle, and approached the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna. Then the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna—just as a strong man might extend his bent arm or bend his extended arm—vanished from the shore of the Mandākinī Pond and reappeared in Jeta Grove. That nāga also vanished from the shore of the Mandākinī Pond and reappeared in Jeta Grove. Then that nāga, after the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna had received the lotus roots and stalks, vanished from Jeta Grove and reappeared on the shore of the Mandākinī Pond. Then the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna offered the lotus roots and stalks to the Venerable Sāriputta. After the Venerable Sāriputta had consumed the lotus roots and stalks, his bodily burning ailment subsided. Many lotus roots and stalks remained. At that time, during a famine, the bhikkhus would declare satisfaction even for small amounts, or decline after reflection, and the entire Saṅgha had made the declaration of satisfaction. The bhikkhus, being scrupulous, did not accept them. “Receive them, bhikkhus, and consume them. I allow, bhikkhus, to consume forest roots and lotus-pond roots by one who has eaten and made the declaration of satisfaction, provided they are not leftover.”

Tena kho pana samayena sāvatthiyaṃ bahuṃ phalakhādanīyaṃ uppannaṃ hoti, kappiyakārako ca na hoti. Bhikkhū kukkuccāyantā phalaṃ na paribhuñjanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, abījaṃ nibbattabījaṃ [nibbaṭṭabījaṃ (sī.), nibbaṭabījaṃ (syā.), nippaṭṭabījaṃ (ka.)] akatakappaṃ phalaṃ paribhuñjitunti.

At that time, a great quantity of fruit edibles had arisen in Sāvatthī, but there was no one to make it allowable. The bhikkhus, being scrupulous, did not partake of the fruit. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, bhikkhus, to consume fruit that is seedless, or with seeds removed, or that has not been made allowable.”

Paṭiggahitādi anujānanā niṭṭhitā.

The allowance concerning what has been received, and so forth, is concluded.

167.The Discourse on the Prohibition of Surgical Operations.

279. Atha kho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena rājagahaṃ tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena rājagahaṃ tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā rājagahe viharati veḷuvane kalandakanivāpe. Tena kho pana samayena aññatarassa bhikkhuno bhagandalābādho hoti. Ākāsagotto vejjo satthakammaṃ karoti.

Atha kho bhagavā – ‘‘so maṃ khvāyaṃ moghapuriso uppaṇḍetī’’ti – tatova paṭinivattitvā, etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā, bhikkhū paṭipucchi – ‘‘atthi kira, bhikkhave, amukasmiṃ vihāre bhikkhu gilāno’’ti? ‘‘Atthi bhagavā’’ti. ‘‘Kiṃ tassa, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno ābādho’’ti? ‘‘Tassa, bhante, āyasmato bhagandalābādho, ākāsagotto vejjo satthakammaṃ karotī’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā – ‘‘ananucchavikaṃ, bhikkhave, tassa moghapurisassa, ananulomikaṃ, appatirūpaṃ, assāmaṇakaṃ, akappiyaṃ, akaraṇīyaṃ.

279.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Sāvatthī as long as he pleased, set out on a journey toward Rājagaha. Traveling in stages, he eventually arrived at Rājagaha. There the Blessed One stayed in the Bamboo Grove, at the Squirrels’ Feeding Place. At that time, a certain monk was suffering from a fistula. The physician Ākāsagotta was performing surgery. Then the Blessed One, while walking around for lodgings, approached that monk’s residence. The physician Ākāsagotta saw the Blessed One coming from afar and, upon seeing him, said to the Blessed One: “Let the venerable Gotama come and see this monk’s anus, like the mouth of a monitor lizard.” Then the Blessed One thought, “This foolish man is mocking me,” and turned back right there. On this occasion, in this matter, he had the Sangha of monks assembled and questioned the monks: “Monks, is there a sick monk in such-and-such a dwelling?” “There is, Blessed One.” “What is the illness of that monk, monks?” “Venerable sir, that venerable one has a fistula. The physician Ākāsagotta is performing surgery.” The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked him: “It is inappropriate, monks, for that foolish man, unsuitable, improper, unworthy of a renunciate, impermissible, not to be done. How, monks, could that foolish man have surgery performed in a confined space? In a confined space, monks, the skin is delicate, the wound is difficult to heal, and the surgical instrument is difficult to handle. This, monks, will not inspire confidence in those who are without confidence…” Having rebuked him… he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, surgery should not be performed in a confined space. Whoever does so commits a grave offense.”

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū – bhagavatā satthakammaṃ paṭikkhittanti – vatthikammaṃ kārāpenti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā, te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma chabbaggiyā bhikkhū vatthikammaṃ kārāpessantī’’ti. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, chabbaggiyā bhikkhū vatthikammaṃ kārāpentī’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti…pe… vigarahitvā dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, sambādhassa sāmantā dvaṅgulā satthakammaṃ vā vatthikammaṃ vā kārāpetabbaṃ. Yo kārāpeyya, āpatti thullaccayassā’’ti.

At that time the monks of the group of six, thinking, "The Blessed One has prohibited surgery," had enemas performed. The monks who were modest complained, criticized, and protested: "How can the monks of the group of six have enemas performed?" Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. "Is it true, monks, that the monks of the group of six are having enemas performed?" "It is true, Blessed One."… Having rebuked them… he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: "Monks, neither surgery nor an enema should be performed within two fingerbreadths of a confined space. Whoever does so commits a grave offense."

280.Then the Blessed One, having stayed in Rājagaha as long as he pleased, set out on a journey to Bārāṇasī. Traveling in stages, he arrived at Bārāṇasī. There the Blessed One stayed in the Deer Park at Isipatana near Bārāṇasī.At that time in Bārāṇasī, there were two lay followers named Suppiya and Suppiyā, both devout, generous, helpful, and supporters of the Sangha. One day, Suppiyā the lay follower went to the monastery and went from dwelling to dwelling, from cell to cell, asking the monks: "Venerable sirs, who is sick? What should be brought for whom?"At that time, a certain monk had taken a purgative. That monk said to Suppiyā the lay follower: "Sister, I have taken a purgative. I need something restorative.""Very well, sir, it will be brought," she replied. She went home and instructed her servant: "Go, my dear, find some suitable meat.""Yes, madam," the servant replied. But after wandering all over Bārāṇasī, he could not find any suitable meat. Then the servant returned to Suppiyā the lay follower and said: "Madam, there is no suitable meat. Today is a day of non-killing."Then Suppiyā the lay follower thought: "If that sick monk does not get something restorative, his illness may worsen, or he may even die. It would not be proper for me to promise and then not deliver." Taking a sharp knife, she cut a piece of flesh from her thigh, gave it to a maid, and said: "Here, my dear, prepare this meat and give it to the sick monk in such-and-such dwelling. If anyone asks, say that the giver is sick." Then she wrapped her thigh with her upper robe, entered her chamber, and lay down on the bed.When Suppiya the lay follower returned home, he asked the maid: "Where is Suppiyā?" "Sir, she is lying down in the chamber." Then Suppiya the lay follower went to Suppiyā and asked: "Why are you lying down?" "I am sick." "What is your ailment?" Then Suppiyā the lay follower told him what had happened.Suppiya the lay follower was amazed and astonished: "How extraordinary! How wonderful! How deeply devoted Suppiyā is, that she would even give up her own flesh! What else would she not give?" Delighted and elated, he went to the Blessed One, paid homage, sat down to one side, and said: "Venerable sir, may the Blessed One accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks." The Blessed One consented by silence.Knowing the Blessed One had accepted, Suppiya rose from his seat, paid homage, circumambulated the Blessed One, and departed. When the night had passed, he had fine food prepared and announced the time to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, it is time. The meal is ready."Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe, and went to Suppiya’s residence, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks. Suppiya the lay follower approached the Blessed One, paid homage, and stood to one side. The Blessed One asked him: "Where is Suppiyā?" "She is sick, Blessed One." "Then let her come." "She is not able, Blessed One." "Then bring her here supporting her." So Suppiya the lay follower brought Suppiyā supporting her.As soon as she saw the Blessed One, the large wound on her thigh healed completely, with fine hair growing over it. Suppiya and Suppiyā the lay followers were amazed and astonished: "How extraordinary! How wonderful! The Tathāgata possesses such great power and might, that simply by seeing him, the large wound on her thigh healed completely, with fine hair growing over it!" Delighted and elated, they personally served the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha with fine food. When the Blessed One had finished eating and had put away his bowl, they sat down to one side.Then the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened Suppiya and Suppiyā the lay followers with a Dhamma talk. Having done so, he rose from his seat and departed.

Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā bhikkhū

Then, on this occasion, in this matter, the Blessed One had the Sangha of monks assembled and questioned the monks:

Paṭipucchi – ‘‘ko, bhikkhave, suppiyaṃ upāsikaṃ maṃsaṃ viññāpesī’’ti? Evaṃ vutte so bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘ahaṃ kho, bhante, suppiyaṃ upāsikaṃ maṃsaṃ viññāpesi’’nti. ‘‘Āhariyittha bhikkhū’’ti? ‘‘Āhariyittha bhagavā’’ti. ‘‘Paribhuñji tvaṃ bhikkhū’’ti? ‘‘Paribhuñjāmahaṃ bhagavā’’ti. ‘‘Paṭivekkhi tvaṃ bhikkhū’’ti? ‘‘Nāhaṃ bhagavā paṭivekkhi’’nti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… kathañhi nāma tvaṃ, moghapurisa, appaṭivekkhitvā maṃsaṃ paribhuñjissasi. Manussamaṃsaṃ kho tayā, moghapurisa, paribhuttaṃ. Netaṃ, moghapurisa, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… vigarahitvā dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘santi, bhikkhave, manussā saddhā pasannā, tehi attanopi maṃsāni pariccattāni. Na, bhikkhave, manussamaṃsaṃ paribhuñjitabbaṃ. Yo paribhuñjeyya, āpatti thullaccayassa. Na ca, bhikkhave, appaṭivekkhitvā maṃsaṃ paribhuñjitabbaṃ. Yo paribhuñjeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

He questioned, "Who, monk, requested meat from Suppiya the laywoman?" When this was said, that monk replied to the Blessed One, "I, venerable sir, requested meat from Suppiya the laywoman." "Was it brought, monk?" "It was brought, Blessed One." "Did you eat it, monk?" "I ate it, Blessed One." "Did you examine it, monk?" "I did not examine it, Blessed One." The Blessed One, the Buddha, rebuked him... "How could you, foolish man, eat meat without examining it? You have eaten human flesh, foolish man! This is not, foolish man, for inspiring confidence in the faithless...!" Having rebuked him and given a Dhamma talk, he addressed the monks: "Monks, there are faithful and devoted people who even sacrifice their own flesh. Monks, human flesh should not be eaten. Whoever eats it commits a grave offense. And, monks, meat should not be eaten without examining it. Whoever eats it commits an offense of wrong-doing."

Manussamaṃsapaṭikkhepakathā niṭṭhitā.

169.The Account of the Prohibition of Elephant Meat and So Forth

281. Tena kho pana samayena rañño hatthī maranti. Manussā dubbhikkhe hatthimaṃsaṃ paribhuñjanti, bhikkhūnaṃ piṇḍāya carantānaṃ hatthimaṃsaṃ denti. Bhikkhū hatthimaṃsaṃ paribhuñjanti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma samaṇā sakyaputtiyā hatthimaṃsaṃ paribhuñjissanti. Rājaṅgaṃ hatthī, sace rājā jāneyya, na nesaṃ attamano assā’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, hatthimaṃsaṃ paribhuñjitabbaṃ. Yo paribhuñjeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

281.Now at that time, the king’s elephants died. People, suffering from famine, were eating elephant meat, and gave elephant meat to the bhikkhus who were on their almsround. The bhikkhus ate the elephant meat. People grumbled, complained, and spread it about: “How can these Sakyan recluses eat elephant meat? An elephant is royal property. If the king were to know, he would not be pleased with them.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, elephant meat should not be eaten. Whoever eats it commits a dukkata offense.”

Tena kho pana samayena rañño assā maranti. Manussā dubbhikkhe assamaṃsaṃ paribhuñjanti, bhikkhūnaṃ piṇḍāya carantānaṃ assamaṃsaṃ denti. Bhikkhū assamaṃsaṃ paribhuñjanti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma samaṇā sakyaputtiyā assamaṃsaṃ paribhuñjissanti. Rājaṅgaṃ assā, sace rājā jāneyya, na nesaṃ attamano assā’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, assamaṃsaṃ paribhuñjitabbaṃ. Yo paribhuñjeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

Now at that time, the king’s horses died. People, suffering from famine, were eating horse meat, and gave horse meat to the bhikkhus who were on their almsround. The bhikkhus ate the horse meat. People grumbled, complained, and spread it about: “How can these Sakyan recluses eat horse meat? A horse is royal property. If the king were to know, he would not be pleased with them.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, horse meat should not be eaten. Whoever eats it commits a dukkata offense.”

Tena kho pana samayena manussā dubbhikkhe sunakhamaṃsaṃ paribhuñjanti, bhikkhūnaṃ piṇḍāya carantānaṃ sunakhamaṃsaṃ denti. Bhikkhū sunakhamaṃsaṃ paribhuñjanti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma samaṇā sakyaputtiyā sunakhamaṃsaṃ paribhuñjissanti, jeguccho sunakho paṭikūlo’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, sunakhamaṃsaṃ paribhuñjitabbaṃ. Yo paribhuñjeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

Now at that time, people, suffering from famine, were eating dog meat. When the bhikkhus went for alms, they gave dog meat to them. The bhikkhus ate the dog meat. The people grumbled, complained, and spread it about: “How can these Sakyan recluses eat dog meat? A dog is disgusting and repulsive!” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, dog meat should not be eaten. Whoever eats it commits a dukkata offense.”

Tena kho pana samayena manussā dubbhikkhe ahimaṃsaṃ paribhuñjanti, bhikkhūnaṃ piṇḍāya carantānaṃ ahimaṃsaṃ denti. Bhikkhū ahimaṃsaṃ paribhuñjanti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma samaṇā sakyaputtiyā ahimaṃsaṃ paribhuñjissanti, jeguccho ahi paṭikūlo’’ti. Supassopi [suphasso (sī.)] nāgarājā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi. Ekamantaṃ ṭhito kho supasso nāgarājā bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘santi, bhante, nāgā assaddhā appasannā. Te appamattakehipi bhikkhū viheṭheyyuṃ. Sādhu, bhante, ayyā ahimaṃsaṃ na paribhuñjeyyu’’nti. Atha kho bhagavā supassaṃ nāgarājānaṃ dhammiyā kathāya sandassesi…pe… padakkhiṇaṃ katvā pakkāmi. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, ahimaṃsaṃ paribhuñjitabbaṃ. Yo paribhuñjeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

Now at that time, people, suffering from famine, were eating snake meat, and when bhikkhus went for alms, they gave them snake meat. The bhikkhus ate the snake meat. The people grumbled, complained, and spread it about: “How can these Sakyan recluses eat snake meat? A snake is disgusting and repulsive!” Then the Nāga king Supassa approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, the Nāga king Supassa said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, there are Nāgas who are faithless and lacking confidence. They might harm the bhikkhus even for minor reasons. It would be good, venerable sir, if the noble ones did not eat snake meat.” Then the Blessed One instructed, urged, inspired, and gladdened the Nāga king Supassa with a Dhamma talk... and after circumambulating him, he departed. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the bhikkhus: “Monks, snake meat should not be eaten. Whoever eats it commits a dukkata offense.”

Tena kho pana samayena luddakā sīhaṃ hantvā sīhamaṃsaṃ [maṃsaṃ (ka.)] paribhuñjanti, bhikkhūnaṃ piṇḍāya carantānaṃ sīhamaṃsaṃ denti. Bhikkhū sīhamaṃsaṃ paribhuñjitvā araññe viharanti. Sīhā sīhamaṃsagandhena bhikkhū paripātenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, sīhamaṃsaṃ paribhuñjitabbaṃ. Yo paribhuñjeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

Now at that time, hunters killed a lion and were eating lion meat. While the bhikkhus were on their almsround, they gave them lion meat. The bhikkhus, having eaten the lion meat, lived in the wilderness. Lions, because of the smell of lion meat, attacked the bhikkhus. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, lion meat should not be eaten. Whoever eats it commits a dukkata offense.”

Tena kho pana samayena luddakā byagghaṃ hantvā…pe… dīpiṃ hantvā…pe… acchaṃ hantvā…pe… taracchaṃ hantvā taracchamaṃsaṃ paribhuñjanti, bhikkhūnaṃ piṇḍāya carantānaṃ taracchamaṃsaṃ denti. Bhikkhū taracchamaṃsaṃ paribhuñjitvā araññe viharanti. Taracchā taracchamaṃsagandhena bhikkhū paripātenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, taracchamaṃsaṃ paribhuñjitabbaṃ. Yo paribhuñjeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

Now at that time, hunters killed a tiger…killed a leopard…killed a bear…killed a hyena and were eating the hyena meat. While on their almsround, they gave hyena meat to the bhikkhus. The bhikkhus, having eaten the hyena meat, lived in the wilderness. Hyenas, because of the smell of hyena meat, attacked the bhikkhus. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, hyena meat should not be eaten. Whoever eats it commits a dukkata offense.”

170.The Permission for Rice Gruel and Honey-Balls.

282.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Bārāṇasī as long as he pleased, set out on a journey to Andhakavinda with a large company of bhikkhus—twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus. At that time, many country folk loaded carts with salt, oil, rice, and hard food and followed behind the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha, thinking, "When we get our turn, we will prepare a meal." There were also about five hundred groups of those who lived on scraps. Then the Blessed One, traveling by stages, arrived at Andhakavinda. Then a certain brahmin, not getting his turn, thought: "For the past two months I have been following the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha, thinking, 'When I get my turn, I will prepare a meal.' But I have not gotten my turn. I am alone, and much of my household affairs is neglected. Why don’t I inspect the meal offerings? Whatever is lacking in the meal offerings, I will provide." Then that brahmin, inspecting the meal offerings, did not see two things: rice gruel and honey-balls. Then that brahmin approached Venerable Ānanda and said: "Venerable Ānanda, not getting my turn, I thought: 'For the past two months I have been following the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha, thinking, "When I get my turn, I will prepare a meal." But I have not gotten my turn. I am alone, and much of my household affairs is neglected. Why don’t I inspect the meal offerings? Whatever is lacking in the meal offerings, I will provide.' Venerable Ānanda, inspecting the meal offerings, I did not see two things: rice gruel and honey-balls. If I were to provide rice gruel and honey-balls, would Master Gotama accept them from me?" "Then, brahmin, I will ask the Blessed One." Then Venerable Ānanda informed the Blessed One of the matter. "Then, Ānanda, let him provide them." "Then, brahmin, provide them." Then that brahmin, when the night had passed, had abundant rice gruel and honey-balls prepared and offered them to the Blessed One, saying: "May Master Gotama accept the rice gruel and honey-balls from me." "Then, brahmin, give them to the bhikkhus." The bhikkhus, being scrupulous, did not accept them. "Accept them, bhikkhus, and partake of them." Then that brahmin personally served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with abundant rice gruel and honey-balls. When the Blessed One had washed his hands and the bowl had been removed, the brahmin sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One said to that brahmin:

‘‘Dasayime, brāhmaṇa, ānisaṃsā yāguyā. Katame dasa? Yāguṃ dento āyuṃ deti, vaṇṇaṃ deti, sukhaṃ deti, balaṃ deti, paṭibhānaṃ deti, yāgu pītā khuddaṃ [khudaṃ (sī. syā.)] paṭihanati, pipāsaṃ vineti, vātaṃ anulometi, vatthiṃ sodheti, āmāvasesaṃ pāceti – ime kho, brāhmaṇa, dasānisaṃsā yāguyā’’ti [pacchimā pañca ānisaṃsā a. ni. 5.207].

“These, brahmin, are the ten benefits of rice gruel. What ten? Giving rice gruel, one gives life, gives beauty, gives happiness, gives strength, gives eloquence. Rice gruel, when drunk, wards off hunger, dispels thirst, regulates the wind, cleanses the bladder, and digests the remnant of undigested food. These, brahmin, are the ten benefits of rice gruel.”

[a. ni. 4.58-59 thokaṃ visadisaṃ] Yo saññatānaṃ paradattabhojinaṃ;Kālena sakkacca dadāti yāguṃ;Dasassa ṭhānāni anuppavecchati;Āyuñca vaṇṇañca sukhaṃ balañca.

For one who is restrained, eating food offered by others, who gives rice gruel at the right time with due respect, he bestows ten things: longevity, beauty, happiness, and strength.

Paṭibhānamassa upajāyate tato;Khuddaṃ pipāsañca byapaneti vātaṃ;Sodheti vatthiṃ pariṇāmeti bhuttaṃ;Bhesajjametaṃ sugatena vaṇṇitaṃ.

From this, eloquence arises in him; it dispels hunger, thirst, and wind; it cleanses the bladder and digests what has been eaten. This medicine was praised by the Sugata.

Tasmā hi yāguṃ alameva dātuṃ;Niccaṃ manussena sukhatthikena;Dibbāni vā patthayatā sukhāni;Manussasobhagyatamicchatā vāti.

Therefore, one desiring happiness should always give rice gruel; indeed, whether aspiring for heavenly pleasures or wishing for human good fortune.

Atha kho bhagavā taṃ brāhmaṇaṃ imāhi gāthāhi anumoditvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkāmi. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, yāguñca madhugoḷakañcā’’ti.

Then the Blessed One, having rejoiced the brahmin with these verses, rose from his seat and departed. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, in this connection, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, I allow rice gruel and honey-balls."

Yāgumadhugoḷakānujānanā niṭṭhitā.

The allowance for rice gruel and honey-balls is concluded.

283.People heard that the Blessed One had allowed congee and honey balls. So, early in the morning, they prepared congee and honey balls. The monks, having been satiated with congee and honey balls early in the morning, did not partake of their meal at the alms hall with relish. At that time, a newly devoted high official had invited the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha for the next day. Then that newly devoted high official thought: "Why don’t I prepare thirteen hundred and fifty bowls of meat for thirteen hundred and fifty monks, offering one bowl of meat to each monk?" Then that newly devoted high official, after that night had passed, had fine hard and soft food prepared, along with thirteen hundred and fifty bowls of meat. He informed the Blessed One that the meal was ready: "Venerable sir, it is time; the meal is ready." Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe and went to the residence of that newly devoted high official. Having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks. Then that newly devoted high official served the monks in the dining hall. The monks said: "Give a little, friend; give a little, friend." "Venerable sirs, do not take just a little because you think, 'This is a newly devoted high official.' I have prepared much hard and soft food and thirteen hundred and fifty bowls of meat. I intend to offer one bowl of meat to each monk. Please accept, venerable sirs, as much as you wish." "Friend, we are not taking just a little for that reason. But we have already been satiated with congee and honey balls early in the morning. That is why we are taking just a little." Then that newly devoted high official complained, grumbled, and criticized: "How can these venerable ones, invited by me, partake of congee elsewhere? Am I not capable of giving as much as they want?" Angry and displeased, and wanting to cause offence, he went around filling the monks’ bowls to the brim, saying, "Eat it or take it away!" Then that newly devoted high official, having personally served and satisfied the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha with fine hard and soft food, sat down to one side when the Blessed One had finished his meal and taken his hand from the bowl. Seated to one side, the Blessed One instructed, urged, inspired, and gladdened that newly devoted high official with a Dhamma talk. Then he rose from his seat and departed.

Atha kho tassa taruṇapasannassa mahāmattassa acirapakkantassa bhagavato ahudeva kukkuccaṃ, ahu vippaṭisāro – ‘‘alābhā vata me, na vata me lābhā; dulladdhaṃ vata me, na vata me suladdhaṃ; yohaṃ kupito anattamano āsādanāpekkho bhikkhūnaṃ patte pūrento agamāsiṃ – ‘bhuñjatha vā haratha vā’ti.

Kiṃ nu kho mayā bahuṃ pasutaṃ, puññaṃ vā apuññaṃ vā’ti. Kiṃ nu kho mayā, bhante, bahuṃ pasutaṃ, puññaṃ vā apuññaṃ vā’’ti? ‘‘Yadaggena tayā, āvuso, svātanāya buddhappamukho bhikkhusaṅgho nimantito tadaggena te bahuṃ puññaṃ pasutaṃ. Yadaggena te ekamekena bhikkhunā ekamekaṃ sitthaṃ paṭiggahitaṃ tadaggena te bahuṃ puññaṃ pasutaṃ, saggā te āraddhā’’ti. Atha kho so taruṇapasanno mahāmatto – ‘‘lābhā kira me, suladdhaṃ kira me, bahuṃ kira mayā puññaṃ pasutaṃ, saggā kira me āraddhā’’ti – haṭṭho udaggo uṭṭhāyāsanā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṃ katvā pakkāmi. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā bhikkhū paṭipucchi – ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, bhikkhū aññatra nimantitā aññassa bhojjayāguṃ paribhuñjantī’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ, bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… kathañhi nāma te, bhikkhave, moghapurisā aññatra nimantitā aññassa bhojjayāguṃ paribhuñjissanti. Netaṃ, bhikkhave, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… vigarahitvā dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, aññatra nimantitena aññassa bhojjayāgu paribhuñjitabbā. Yo paribhuñjeyya, yathādhammo kāretabbo’’ti.

Then, soon after the Blessed One had departed, doubt and regret arose in that newly devoted high official: "Alas, it is truly my loss, not my gain; my misfortune, not my good fortune, that I went angry and displeased, seeking an occasion for offense, filling the monks' bowls while saying, 'Eat it or carry it away.' What have I produced in abundance—merit or demerit?" Then that newly devoted high official approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, he said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, soon after you departed, doubt and regret arose in me: 'Alas, it is truly my loss, not my gain; my misfortune, not my good fortune, that I went angry and displeased, seeking an occasion for offense, filling the monks' bowls while saying, "Eat it or carry it away." What have I produced in abundance—merit or demerit?' Venerable sir, what have I produced in abundance—merit or demerit?" "Friend, by the fact that you invited the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha for tomorrow's meal, you have produced abundant merit. By the fact that each monk accepted a single morsel from you, you have produced abundant merit; heaven has been set in motion for you." Then that newly devoted high official, joyful and elated, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed, thinking: "Truly, it is my gain, my good fortune! I have produced abundant merit, and heaven has been set in motion for me!" Then, on this occasion, the Blessed One convened the Saṅgha of monks, and asked the monks: "Is it true, monks, that monks partake of another's congee when invited elsewhere?" "It is true, Blessed One." The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked them…pe… "How can you, foolish men, partake of another's congee when invited elsewhere? This will not inspire confidence in those without it…pe…" Having rebuked them, he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: "Monks, one should not partake of another's congee when invited elsewhere. Whoever does so, he should be dealt with according to the rule."

Taruṇapasannamahāmattavatthu niṭṭhitaṃ.

284.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Andhakavinda as long as he pleased, set out on a journey to Rājagaha with a large company of bhikkhus—one thousand two hundred and fifty bhikkhus. Now at that time, Belaṭṭha Kaccāna was traveling from Rājagaha to Andhakavinda on the road, with five hundred carts, all loaded with pots of molasses. From a distance, the Blessed One saw Belaṭṭha Kaccāna approaching. Seeing him, he stepped off the road and sat down at the foot of a certain tree. Then Belaṭṭha Kaccāna approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. Standing there, Belaṭṭha Kaccāna said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, I wish to give each bhikkhu one pot of molasses.” “Then, Kaccāna, bring just one pot of molasses.” “Yes, venerable sir,” replied Belaṭṭha Kaccāna. He took one pot of molasses, approached the Blessed One, and said: “Venerable sir, the pot of molasses has been brought. What should I do now?” “Then, Kaccāna, give the molasses to the bhikkhus.” “Yes, venerable sir,” replied Belaṭṭha Kaccāna. After giving the molasses to the bhikkhus, he said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the molasses has been given to the bhikkhus, but much remains. What should I do now?” “Then, Kaccāna, give the bhikkhus molasses as much as they desire.” “Yes, venerable sir,” replied Belaṭṭha Kaccāna. After giving the bhikkhus molasses as much as they desired, he said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the bhikkhus have taken molasses as much as they desired, but much still remains. What should I do now?” “Then, Kaccāna, satiate the bhikkhus with molasses.” “Yes, venerable sir,” replied Belaṭṭha Kaccāna. He satiated the bhikkhus with molasses. Some bhikkhus filled their bowls, some filled their strainers, and some filled their bags. Then Belaṭṭha Kaccāna, having satiated the bhikkhus with molasses, said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the bhikkhus have been satiated with molasses, but much still remains. What should I do now?” “Then, Kaccāna, give the molasses to those who live on leftovers.” “Yes, venerable sir,” replied Belaṭṭha Kaccāna. After giving the molasses to those who live on leftovers, he said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the molasses has been given to those who live on leftovers, but much still remains. What should I do now?” “Then, Kaccāna, give those who live on leftovers molasses as much as they desire.” “Yes, venerable sir,” replied Belaṭṭha Kaccāna. After giving those who live on leftovers molasses as much as they desired, he said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, those who live on leftovers have taken molasses as much as they desired, but much still remains. What should I do now?” “Then, Kaccāna, satiate those who live on leftovers with molasses.” “Yes, venerable sir,” replied Belaṭṭha Kaccāna. He satiated those who live on leftovers with molasses. Some who lived on leftovers filled their buckets, some filled their pots, some filled their baskets, and some even filled their laps. Then Belaṭṭha Kaccāna, having satiated those who live on leftovers with molasses, said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, those who live on leftovers have been satiated with molasses, but much still remains. What should I do now?” “I do not see, Kaccāna, in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, among this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans, anyone by whom this molasses, having been eaten, could be properly digested, except the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata. Therefore, Kaccāna, discard this molasses in a place where there is no green vegetation or immerse it in water where there are no living beings.” “Yes, venerable sir,” replied Belaṭṭha Kaccāna. He immersed the molasses in water where there were no living beings. When the molasses was thrown into the water, it crackled, sputtered, steamed, and sent up clouds of smoke—just as a plowshare heated all day crackles, sputters, steams, and sends up clouds of smoke when thrown into water, so too did that molasses crackle, sputter, steam, and send up clouds of smoke when thrown into the water.

Atha kho belaṭṭho kaccāno saṃviggo lomahaṭṭhajāto yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnassa kho belaṭṭhassa kaccānassa bhagavā anupubbiṃ kathaṃ kathesi, seyyathidaṃ – ‘‘dānakathaṃ sīlakathaṃ saggakathaṃ, kāmānaṃ ādīnavaṃ okāraṃ saṃkilesaṃ, nekkhamme ānisaṃsaṃ pakāsesi. Yadā bhagavā aññāsi belaṭṭhaṃ kaccānaṃ kallacittaṃ, muducittaṃ, vinīvaraṇacittaṃ, udaggacittaṃ, pasannacittaṃ, atha yā buddhānaṃ sāmukkaṃsikā dhammadesanā, taṃ pakāsesi…pe… evameva belaṭṭhassa kaccānassa tasmiṃyeva āsane virajaṃ vītamalaṃ dhammacakkhuṃ udapādi – yaṃ kiñci samudayadhammaṃ sabbaṃ taṃ nirodhadhammanti. Atha kho belaṭṭho kaccāno diṭṭhadhammo pattadhammo viditadhammo pariyogāḷhadhammo tiṇṇavicikiccho vigatakathaṃkatho vesārajjappatto aparappaccayo satthusāsane bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘abhikkantaṃ, bhante. Abhikkantaṃ, bhante. Seyyathāpi, bhante, nikkujjitaṃ vā ukkujjeyya…pe… evamevaṃ kho bhagavatā anekapariyāyena dhammo pakāsito. Esāhaṃ, bhante, bhagavantaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi, dhammañca, bhikkhusaṅghañca. Upāsakaṃ maṃ bhagavā dhāretu ajjatagge pāṇupetaṃ saraṇagata’’nti.

Then Belaṭṭha Kaccāna, agitated and with hair standing on end, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One gave Belaṭṭha Kaccāna a progressive talk, that is to say, a talk on generosity, on virtue, on heaven; on the danger, worthlessness, and defilement of sensual pleasures; and on the benefits of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that Belaṭṭha Kaccāna's mind was ready, pliable, free from hindrances, uplifted, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth [readily] absorbs dye, so too in Belaṭṭha Kaccāna, as he sat there, arose the dust-free, stainless vision of the Dhamma: “Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.” Then Belaṭṭha Kaccāna, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, known the Dhamma, plunged into the Dhamma, crossed beyond doubt, got rid of perplexity, attained assurance, and become independent of others in the Teacher’s Dispensation, said to the Blessed One: “Excellent, venerable sir! Excellent, venerable sir! Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, reveal what was hidden, show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes could see—in the same way, the Blessed One has made the Dhamma clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. May the Blessed One accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for as long as life lasts.”

Atha kho bhagavā anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena rājagahaṃ tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā rājagahe viharati veḷuvane kalandakanivāpe. Tena kho pana samayena rājagahe guḷo ussanno hoti. Bhikkhū – gilānasseva bhagavatā guḷo anuññāto, no agilānassāti – kukkuccāyantā guḷaṃ na bhuñjanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, gilānassa guḷaṃ, agilānassa guḷodakanti.

Then the Blessed One, wandering by stages, arrived at Rājagaha. There the Blessed One stayed in Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Now at that time, molasses was plentiful in Rājagaha. The bhikkhus—thinking, “The Blessed One has allowed molasses only for the sick, not for the healthy”—were scrupulous and did not consume molasses. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, bhikkhus, molasses for the sick and molasses-water for the healthy.”

Belaṭṭhakaccānavatthu niṭṭhitaṃ.

The story about Belaṭṭha Kaccāna is concluded.

173.The Pāṭaligāma Incident

285. [ito paraṃ mahāva. 286-287 ‘tiṇṇā medhāvino janā’ti pāṭho dī. ni. 2.148; udā. 76 ādayo] Atha kho bhagavā rājagahe yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena pāṭaligāmo tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi, mahatā bhikkhusaṅghena saddhiṃ, aḍḍhatelasehi bhikkhusatehi. Atha kho bhagavā anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena pāṭaligāmo tadavasari. Assosuṃ kho pāṭaligāmikā upāsakā – ‘‘bhagavā kira pāṭaligāmaṃ anuppatto’’ti. Atha kho pāṭaligāmikā upāsakā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu. Ekamantaṃ nisinne kho pāṭaligāmike upāsake bhagavā dhammiyā kathāya sandassesi, samādapesi, samuttejesi, sampahaṃsesi. Atha kho pāṭaligāmikā upāsakā bhagavatā dhammiyā kathāya sandassitā samādapitā samuttejitā sampahaṃsitā bhagavantaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘adhivāsetu no, bhante, bhagavā āvasathāgāraṃ saddhiṃ bhikkhusaṅghenā’’ti. Adhivāsesi bhagavā tuṇhībhāvena. Atha kho pāṭaligāmikā upāsakā bhagavato adhivāsanaṃ viditvā uṭṭhāyāsanā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṃ katvā yena āvasathāgāraṃ tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā sabbasanthariṃ āvasathāgāraṃ santharitvā, āsanāni paññapetvā, udakamaṇikaṃ patiṭṭhāpetvā, telapadīpaṃ āropetvā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhaṃsu. Ekamantaṃ ṭhitā kho pāṭaligāmikā upāsakā bhagavantaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘sabbasantharisanthataṃ, bhante, āvasathāgāraṃ. Āsanāni paññattāni. Udakamaṇiko patiṭṭhāpito. Telapadīpo āropito. Yassadāni, bhante, bhagavā kālaṃ maññatī’’ti.

285.Then the Blessed One, having stayed in Rājagaha as long as he pleased, set out on a journey toward Pāṭaligāma with a large company of monks—thirteen hundred and fifty monks. Traveling stage by stage, the Blessed One arrived at Pāṭaligāma. The lay followers of Pāṭaligāma heard: "The Blessed One, it seems, has arrived at Pāṭaligāma." Then the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One instructed, inspired, aroused, and gladdened them with a Dhamma talk. Having been instructed, inspired, aroused, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk, the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma said to him: "May the Blessed One, venerable sir, consent to accept our rest house together with the community of monks." The Blessed One consented by silence. Then the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma, understanding the Blessed One's consent, rose from their seats, paid homage to him, circumambulated him, keeping him to their right, and approached the rest house. Having approached, they spread out the rest house completely with mats, prepared seats, set up a water vessel, and lit an oil lamp. Then they approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, the rest house is completely spread out with mats, seats are prepared, a water vessel is set up, and an oil lamp is lit. Now, venerable sir, the Blessed One may go at his convenience."

Atha kho bhagavā nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya saddhiṃ bhikkhusaṅghena yena āvasathāgāraṃ tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā pāde pakkhāletvā āvasathāgāraṃ pavisitvā majjhimaṃ thambhaṃ nissāya puratthābhimukho nisīdi. Bhikkhusaṅghopi kho pāde pakkhāletvā āvasathāgāraṃ pavisitvā pacchimaṃ bhittiṃ nissāya puratthābhimukho nisīdi, bhagavantaṃyeva purakkhatvā. Pāṭaligāmikāpi kho upāsakā pāde pakkhāletvā āvasathāgāraṃ pavisitvā puratthimaṃ bhittiṃ nissāya pacchimābhimukhā nisīdiṃsu, bhagavantaṃyeva purakkhatvā. Atha kho bhagavā pāṭaligāmike upāsake āmantesi –

Then the Blessed One, having dressed, taking his bowl and robe, together with the community of monks, approached the rest house. Having approached, he washed his feet, entered the rest house, and sat down facing east, leaning against the central pillar. The community of monks also washed their feet, entered the rest house, and sat down facing east, leaning against the western wall, regarding the Blessed One as foremost. The lay followers of Pāṭaligāma also washed their feet, entered the rest house, and sat down facing west, leaning against the eastern wall, regarding the Blessed One as foremost. Then the Blessed One addressed the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma:

Householders, these are the five drawbacks for the immoral, due to failure in virtue. What five? First, householders, the immoral person, due to failure in virtue, through negligence incurs a great loss of wealth. This is the first drawback for the immoral, due to failure in virtue. Furthermore, householders, an evil report spreads about the immoral person who has failed in virtue. This is the second drawback for the immoral, due to failure in virtue. Furthermore, householders, the immoral person who has failed in virtue enters any assembly—whether of nobles, brahmins, householders, or ascetics—unassured and shrinking. This is the third drawback for the immoral, due to failure in virtue. Furthermore, householders, the immoral person who has failed in virtue dies confused. This is the fourth drawback for the immoral, due to failure in virtue. Furthermore, householders, the immoral person who has failed in virtue, upon the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in the plane of misery, a bad destination, the lower realms, even in hell. This is the fifth drawback for the immoral, due to failure in virtue. These, householders, are the five drawbacks for the immoral, due to failure in virtue.

[dī. ni. 3.316; a. ni. 5.213 ādayo] ‘‘Pañcime, gahapatayo, ānisaṃsā sīlavato sīlasampadāya. Katame pañca?

"Householders, there are these five benefits of virtue for one accomplished in virtue. What are the five? Firstly, householders, a virtuous person, accomplished in virtue, through diligence acquires a great mass of wealth. This is the first benefit of virtue for one accomplished in virtue. Furthermore, householders, a virtuous person, accomplished in virtue, obtains a good reputation. This is the second benefit of virtue for one accomplished in virtue. Moreover, householders, a virtuous person, accomplished in virtue, approaches any assembly—whether of nobles, brahmins, householders, or ascetics—confidently and without embarrassment. This is the third benefit of virtue for one accomplished in virtue. Furthermore, householders, a virtuous person, accomplished in virtue, dies unconfused. This is the fourth benefit of virtue for one accomplished in virtue. Finally, householders, a virtuous person, accomplished in virtue, upon the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. This is the fifth benefit of virtue for one accomplished in virtue. These, householders, are the five benefits of virtue for one accomplished in virtue."

Atha kho bhagavā pāṭaligāmike upāsake bahudeva rattiṃ dhammiyā kathāya sandassetvā samādapetvā samuttejetvā sampahaṃsetvā uyyojesi – ‘‘abhikkantā kho, gahapatayo, ratti.

Atha kho bhagavā acirapakkantesu pāṭaligāmikesu upāsakesu suññāgāraṃ pāvisi.

Then the Blessed One, having instructed, roused, inspired, and gladdened the Pāṭaligāma lay followers with a Dhamma talk far into the night, dismissed them, saying: "The night is far advanced, householders. It is time for you to do as you think fit." "Yes, venerable sir," the Pāṭaligāma lay followers replied to the Blessed One. Then they rose from their seats, paid homage to him, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed. Soon after the Pāṭaligāma lay followers had left, the Blessed One entered an empty dwelling.

Pāṭaliputtassa kho, ānanda, tayo antarāyā bhavissanti – aggito vā udakato vā abbhantarato vā mithubhedāti.

286.Now at that time, Sunidha and Vassakāra, the chief ministers of Magadha, were building a city at Pāṭaligāma to keep out the Vajjians. Then the Blessed One, having risen at the break of day, saw with his divine eye, clear and surpassing the human, many deities taking up their dwelling places in Pāṭaligāma. In whatever place the powerful deities took up their dwelling places, there the minds of powerful kings and royal ministers inclined to build dwellings. In whatever place the middling deities took up their dwelling places, there the minds of middling kings and royal ministers inclined to build dwellings. In whatever place the lowly deities took up their dwelling places, there the minds of lowly kings and royal ministers inclined to build dwellings. Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, who is building a city at Pāṭaligāma?” “Sunidha and Vassakāra, Venerable Sir, the chief ministers of Magadha, are building a city at Pāṭaligāma to keep out the Vajjians.” “Just as if, Ānanda, they had consulted with the Tāvatiṃsa gods, so indeed, Ānanda, Sunidha and Vassakāra, the chief ministers of Magadha, are building a city at Pāṭaligāma to keep out the Vajjians. Here, Ānanda, having risen at the break of day, I saw with my divine eye, clear and surpassing the human, many deities taking up their dwelling places in Pāṭaligāma. In whatever place the powerful deities took up their dwelling places, there the minds of powerful kings and royal ministers inclined to build dwellings. In whatever place the middling deities took up their dwelling places, there the minds of middling kings and royal ministers inclined to build dwellings. In whatever place the lowly deities took up their dwelling places, there the minds of lowly kings and royal ministers inclined to build dwellings. Ānanda, as far as the Aryan territory extends, as far as the trade route reaches, this will be the foremost city—Pāṭaliputta, the breaking-open city. But, Ānanda, three dangers will come upon Pāṭaliputta—from fire, from water, or from internal dissension.”

Atha kho sunidhavassakārā magadhamahāmattā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavatā saddhiṃ sammodiṃsu, sammodanīyaṃ kathaṃ sāraṇīyaṃ vītisāretvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhaṃsu.

Atha kho sunidhavassakārā magadhamahāmattā bhagavato adhivāsanaṃ viditvā pakkamiṃsu. Atha kho sunidhavassakārā magadhamahāmattā paṇītaṃ khādanīyaṃ bhojanīyaṃ paṭiyādāpetvā bhagavato kālaṃ ārocāpesuṃ – ‘‘kālo, bho gotama, niṭṭhitaṃ bhatta’’nti. Atha kho bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena sunidhavassakārānaṃ magadhamahāmattānaṃ parivesanā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi saddhiṃ bhikkhusaṅghena. Atha kho sunidhavassakārā magadhamahāmattā buddhappamukhaṃ bhikkhusaṅghaṃ paṇītena khādanīyena bhojanīyena sahatthā santappetvā sampavāretvā bhagavantaṃ bhuttāviṃ onītapattapāṇiṃ ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu. Ekamantaṃ nisinne kho sunidhavassakāre magadhamahāmatte bhagavā imāhi gāthāhi anumodi –

Then the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they exchanged greetings with the Blessed One. After exchanging polite conversation, they stood to one side. Standing to one side, the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra said to the Blessed One: “May Master Gotama accept our meal for today together with the Saṅgha of monks.” The Blessed One consented by silence. Then the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra, understanding the Blessed One’s consent, departed. Then the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra had fine food prepared and informed the Blessed One when the time came: “It is time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.” Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe and went to where the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra were serving the meal. Having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Saṅgha of monks. Then the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra personally served and satisfied the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha with fine food. When the Blessed One had finished eating and had removed his bowl, they sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One expressed his appreciation to the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra with these verses:

‘‘Yasmiṃ padese kappeti, vāsaṃ paṇḍitajātiyo;Sīlavantettha bhojetvā, saññate brahmacārayo [brahmacārino (syā.)].

“In whatever place a wise person makes their dwelling, There, having fed the virtuous, the restrained, the holy life practitioners…”

‘‘Yā tattha devatā āsuṃ, tāsaṃ dakkhiṇamādise;Tā pūjitā pūjayanti, mānitā mānayanti naṃ.

“Whatever deities were there, he dedicated a gift to them; Worshipped, they worship him; respected, they respect him.”

‘‘Tato naṃ anukampanti, mātā puttaṃva orasaṃ;Devatānukampito poso, sadā bhadrāni passatī’’ti.

“Then they pity him, as a mother pities her own child; A person pitied by the deities always sees auspicious things.”

Atha kho bhagavā sunidhavassakāre magadhamahāmatte imāhi gāthāhi anumoditvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkāmi. Tena kho pana samayena sunidhavassakārā magadhamahāmattā bhagavantaṃ piṭṭhito piṭṭhito anubandhā honti, ‘‘yenajja samaṇo gotamo dvārena nikkhamissati, taṃ gotamadvāraṃ nāma bhavissati; yena titthena gaṅgaṃ nadiṃ uttarissati, taṃ gotamatitthaṃ nāma bhavissatī’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā yena dvārena nikkhami, taṃ gotamadvāraṃ nāma ahosi. Atha kho bhagavā yena gaṅgā nadī tenupasaṅkami. Tena kho pana samayena gaṅgā nadī pūrā hoti samatittikā kākapeyyā.

Addasā kho bhagavā te manusse aññe nāvaṃ pariyesante, aññe uḷumpaṃ pariyesante, aññe kullaṃ bandhante orā pāraṃ gantukāme, disvāna seyyathāpi nāma balavā puriso samiñjitaṃ vā bāhaṃ pasāreyya, pasāritaṃ vā bāhaṃ samiñjeyya, evameva kho gaṅgāya nadiyā orimatīre antarahito pārimatīre paccuṭṭhāsi saddhiṃ bhikkhusaṅghena. Atha kho bhagavā etamatthaṃ viditvā tāyaṃ velāyaṃ imaṃ udānaṃ udānesi –

Then the Blessed One, having expressed his appreciation to Sunidha and Vassakāra, the chief ministers of Magadha, with these verses, rose from his seat and departed. At that time Sunidha and Vassakāra, the chief ministers of Magadha, followed closely behind the Blessed One, thinking, “The gate through which the ascetic Gotama exits today will be called the Gotama Gate, and the ford where he crosses the Ganges River will be called the Gotama Ford.” Then the Blessed One exited through a certain gate, and it became known as the Gotama Gate. Then the Blessed One approached the Ganges River. At that time the Ganges River was full, brimful, and overflowing, so that a crow could drink from it. Some people were searching for boats, others for rafts, and others were tying together floats, wanting to cross over to the other shore. The Blessed One saw those people searching for boats, some looking for rafts, others tying together floats, wanting to cross over to the other shore. Seeing this, just as easily as a strong man might stretch out his drawn-in arm or draw in his outstretched arm, so too did the Blessed One vanish from this bank of the Ganges River and reappear on the far bank together with the Saṅgha of monks. Then the Blessed One, understanding the meaning of this, at that time uttered this verse of elation:

‘‘Ye taranti aṇṇavaṃ saraṃ;Setuṃ katvāna visajja pallalāni;Kullañhi jano bandhati;Tiṇṇā medhāvino janā’’ti.

“Those who cross the ocean and the pool, Having made a bridge, they abandon the swamps; People indeed bind a raft; The wise have crossed over.”

Sunidhavassakāravatthu niṭṭhitaṃ.

The story of Sunidha and Vassakāra is concluded.

287. Atha kho bhagavā yena koṭigāmo tenupasaṅkami. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā koṭigāme viharati. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – [dī. ni. 2.155] ‘‘catunnaṃ, bhikkhave, ariyasaccānaṃ ananubodhā appaṭivedhā evamidaṃ dīghamaddhānaṃ sandhāvitaṃ saṃsaritaṃ mamañceva tumhākañca.

287.Then the Blessed One approached Koṭigāma. There the Blessed One stayed at Koṭigāma. There the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks, it is through not understanding, not penetrating the four noble truths that this long wandering and transmigrating has continued for both me and you. Which four? It is through not understanding, not penetrating the noble truth of suffering that this long wandering and transmigrating has continued for both me and you. It is through not understanding, not penetrating the noble truth of the origin of suffering... It is through not understanding, not penetrating the noble truth of the cessation of suffering... It is through not understanding, not penetrating the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering that this long wandering and transmigrating has continued for both me and you. But now, monks, the noble truth of suffering has been understood and penetrated; the noble truth of the origin of suffering has been understood and penetrated; the noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been understood and penetrated; the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering has been understood and penetrated; craving for existence has been cut off; the leading-string to existence is destroyed; now there is no more renewed existence."

Catunnaṃ ariyasaccānaṃ, yathābhūtaṃ adassanā;Saṃsitaṃ dīghamaddhānaṃ, tāsu tāsveva jātisu.

Not seeing the Four Noble Truths as they really are, Long have I transmigrated Through those various existences.

Tāni etāni diṭṭhāni, bhavanetti samūhatā;Ucchinnaṃ mūlaṃ dukkhassa, natthidāni punabbhavoti.

These have been seen; The leading-string to existence has been uprooted; The root of suffering has been cut off; Now there is no more renewed existence.

Koṭigāme saccakathā niṭṭhitā.

The Talk on Truth at Koṭigāma is concluded.

288.The courtesan Ambapālī heard that the Blessed One had arrived at Koṭigāma. Then Ambapālī had fine carriages harnessed, mounted a fine carriage, and set out from Vesālī in her fine carriages to see the Blessed One. She went as far as the carriage could go, then dismounted from the carriage and approached the Blessed One on foot. Having approached, she paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One instructed, inspired, aroused, and gladdened Ambapālī with a Dhamma talk. Then Ambapālī, having been instructed, inspired, aroused, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk, said to him: "Venerable Sir, may the Blessed One, together with the Sangha of monks, accept my meal tomorrow." The Blessed One consented in silence. Then Ambapālī, knowing the Blessed One's consent, rose from her seat, paid homage to him, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.

289.The Licchavis of Vesālī heard that the Blessed One had arrived at Koṭigāma. Then the Licchavis of Vesālī had fine carriages harnessed, mounted fine carriages, and set out from Vesālī in fine carriages to see the Blessed One. Some Licchavis were blue-colored, dressed in blue, adorned with blue. Some Licchavis were yellow-colored, dressed in yellow, adorned with yellow. Some Licchavis were red-colored, dressed in red, adorned with red. Some Licchavis were white-colored, dressed in white, adorned with white. Then the courtesan Ambapālī overtook the young Licchavis, chariot by chariot, yoke by yoke, wheel by wheel, axle by axle. Then those Licchavis said to the courtesan Ambapālī: "Why, lady Ambapālī, do you overtake the young Licchavis, chariot by chariot, yoke by yoke, wheel by wheel, axle by axle?" "Because, young lords, I have invited the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha for tomorrow's meal." "Give us, lady Ambapālī, this meal for a hundred thousand." "Even if you were to give me Vesālī with its revenues, I would not give up this meal." Then those Licchavis snapped their fingers, saying: "We are beaten, sirs, by the mango woman! We are defeated, sirs, by the mango woman!" Then those Licchavis approached the Blessed One. The Blessed One saw those Licchavis coming from afar and addressed the monks: "Monks, those monks who have never seen the Tāvatiṃsa gods, look at this assembly of Licchavis! Observe this assembly of Licchavis! Compare this assembly of Licchavis to the assembly of Tāvatiṃsa gods!" Then those Licchavis went as far as the ground was passable by carriage, then dismounted from the carriages and approached the Blessed One on foot. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. While sitting to one side, the Blessed One instructed, inspired, aroused, and gladdened those Licchavis with a Dhamma talk. Then those Licchavis, having been instructed, inspired, aroused, and gladdened by the Blessed One's Dhamma talk, said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, may the Blessed One together with the Sangha of monks accept our meal for tomorrow." "Licchavis, I have already accepted tomorrow's meal from the courtesan Ambapālī." Then those Licchavis snapped their fingers, saying: "We are beaten, sirs, by the mango woman! We are defeated, sirs, by the mango woman!" Then those Licchavis, having rejoiced and delighted in the Blessed One's words, rose from their seats, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.

Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Koṭigāma as long as he pleased, set out for Nātikā. There the Blessed One stayed at Nātikā in the Giñjakā rest house. Then the courtesan Ambapālī, when the night had passed, had fine food prepared in her own park and sent word to the Blessed One: "It is time, Venerable Sir, the meal is ready." Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe and went to the residence of the courtesan Ambapālī; having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat together with the community of monks. Then the courtesan Ambapālī personally served and satisfied the community of monks headed by the Buddha with fine food and drink. When the Blessed One had finished his meal and had put away his bowl and hand, she sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the courtesan Ambapālī said to the Blessed One: "Venerable Sir, I give this mango grove to the community of monks headed by the Buddha." The Blessed One accepted the park. Then the Blessed One, having instructed, inspired, aroused, and gladdened the courtesan Ambapālī with a Dhamma talk, rose from his seat and went to the Great Wood. There the Blessed One stayed at Vesālī in the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.

290.Now at that time, the well-known Licchavis were seated and assembled in the assembly hall, engaged in various discussions praising the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. At that time, General Sīha, a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas, was sitting in that assembly. Then General Sīha thought: "Surely, that Blessed One must be an Arahant, a Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, since these well-known Licchavis are seated and assembled in the assembly hall, engaged in various discussions praising the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. Why don’t I go to see that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One?" Then General Sīha approached the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta and said: "Venerable sir, I wish to go see the ascetic Gotama." The Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta replied: "Why, Sīha, as one who advocates action, would you go to see the ascetic Gotama, who advocates non-action? For the ascetic Gotama teaches the doctrine of non-action and trains his disciples accordingly." At that, General Sīha’s intention to visit the Blessed One subsided. A second time, the well-known Licchavis were seated and assembled in the assembly hall, engaged in various discussions praising the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. A second time, General Sīha thought: "Surely, that Blessed One must be an Arahant, a Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, since these well-known Licchavis are seated and assembled in the assembly hall, engaged in various discussions praising the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. Why don’t I go to see that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One?" A second time, General Sīha approached the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta and said: "Venerable sir, I wish to go see the ascetic Gotama." Again, the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta replied: "Why, Sīha, as one who advocates action, would you go to see the ascetic Gotama, who advocates non-action? For the ascetic Gotama teaches the doctrine of non-action and trains his disciples accordingly." A second time, General Sīha’s intention to visit the Blessed One subsided.

What can the Nigaṇṭhas do to me, whether I ask for their permission or not? Why don’t I go to see that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, without asking permission from the Nigaṇṭhas?"

Then General Sīha set out from Vesālī in the middle of the day with five hundred chariots to see the Blessed One. As far as the ground was passable for vehicles, he went by vehicle; then dismounting from the vehicle, he approached the Blessed One on foot. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, General Sīha said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, I have heard this: 'The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of inaction; he teaches the Dhamma of inaction, and disciplines his disciples accordingly.' Those, venerable sir, who say this: 'The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of inaction; he teaches the Dhamma of inaction, and disciplines his disciples accordingly'—do they speak in accordance with the Blessed One's words, and not misrepresent the Blessed One with what is untrue? Do they explain the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, so that no legitimate ground for criticism arises from their assertion? For we do not wish, venerable sir, to misrepresent the Blessed One."

293.When this was said, General Sīha said this to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent! Just as if he were to set upright what had been overturned, or to reveal what was hidden, or to show the way to one who was lost, or to light a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyesight can see forms—in the same way has the Blessed One made the Dhamma clear in various ways. I go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for as long as life lasts." "Consider carefully, Sīha; careful consideration is good for people like you, who are well-known." "Venerable sir, I am even more pleased and delighted with the Blessed One for saying this: 'Consider carefully, Sīha; careful consideration is good for people like you, who are well-known.' For if other sectarians were to obtain me as a disciple, they would carry a banner all around Vesālī, proclaiming: 'General Sīha has become our disciple!' Yet the Blessed One tells me: 'Consider carefully, Sīha...' So, venerable sir, for the second time I go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for as long as life lasts." "Your family, Sīha, has long been like a well of water for the Nigaṇṭhas, so you should think of giving alms to them when they come." "Venerable sir, I am even more pleased and delighted with the Blessed One for saying this: 'Your family, Sīha, has long been like a well of water for the Nigaṇṭhas, so you should think of giving alms to them when they come.' For I have heard, venerable sir, that the ascetic Gotama says: 'Gifts should be given only to me; gifts should not be given to others. Gifts should be given only to my disciples; gifts should not be given to the disciples of others. What is given to me is of great fruit; what is given to others is not of great fruit. What is given to my disciples is of great fruit; what is given to the disciples of others is not of great fruit.' Yet the Blessed One encourages me to give to the Nigaṇṭhas as well. But, venerable sir, we will know the proper time for this. So, venerable sir, for the third time I go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for as long as life lasts."

Then the Blessed One gave General Sīha a progressive talk, that is to say, a talk on generosity, a talk on morality, a talk on heaven; he explained the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual pleasures and the benefit of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that General Sīha’s mind was ready, receptive, free from hindrances, uplifted, and confident, he then expounded to him the Dhamma that is the special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth, free of stains, would readily absorb dye, so too in General Sīha, as he sat there, the dust-free, stainless Dhamma-eye arose: ‘Whatever is subject to origination is subject to cessation.’ Then, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, plunged into the Dhamma, having crossed over doubt, having put away perplexity, having gained full confidence in the Teacher’s instruction, independent of others, General Sīha said this to the Blessed One: "May the Blessed One, together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus, consent to a meal from me tomorrow." The Blessed One consented by remaining silent. Then General Sīha, knowing of the Blessed One's consent, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed.

294.Then General Sīha ordered a certain man, saying, "Go, good man, and find out if meat is available." Then, after the night had passed, General Sīha had fine foods, both hard and soft, prepared and announced the time to the Blessed One, saying, "Venerable sir, it is time; the meal is ready." Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and outer robe, went to the residence of General Sīha. Having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus.

At that time, several Nigaṇṭhas were wandering through the streets and crossroads of Vesālī, raising their arms and wailing: "Today, General Sīha had a large animal killed to prepare a meal for the ascetic Gotama. The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared especially for him, meat killed on his account." Then a certain man approached General Sīha and, having approached, whispered in his ear: "Sir, you should know that several Nigaṇṭhas are wandering through the streets and crossroads of Vesālī, raising their arms and wailing: 'Today, General Sīha had a large animal killed to prepare a meal for the ascetic Gotama. The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared especially for him, meat killed on his account.'" "Enough, good sir! For a long time, these venerable ones have been eager to disparage the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. Yet these venerable ones do not desist from falsely, baselessly, untruthfully, and groundlessly accusing the Blessed One. As for us, we would not intentionally deprive a living being of life even for the sake of life itself." Then General Sīha personally served and satisfied the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha with fine foods, hard and soft. When the Blessed One had finished eating and had removed his bowl, General Sīha sat down to one side. Sitting there, the Blessed One instructed, inspired, gladdened, and encouraged him with a Dhamma talk, then rose from his seat and departed. Then, on this occasion, in this connection, the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: "Monks, meat that one knows was specially prepared for one should not be eaten. Whoever should eat it commits an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, fish and meat that is pure in three respects—not seen, not heard, and not suspected."

Sīhasenāpativatthu niṭṭhitaṃ.

The story about General Sīha is concluded.

295.At that time, Vesālī was prosperous, with abundant crops and easily obtained almsfood. It was easy to sustain oneself by gathering scraps. Then, while the Blessed One was alone in seclusion, this thought arose in his mind: "Those allowances I have permitted for the monks—during times of scarcity, poor harvests, and difficulty in obtaining alms—such as food grown indoors, food cooked indoors, food cooked by oneself, food received by special arrangement, food brought from there, food received before the meal, food gathered in the forest, or food gathered from a lotus pond—are the monks still partaking of these now?" Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and addressed Venerable Ānanda: "Ānanda, those allowances I have permitted for the monks—during times of scarcity, poor harvests, and difficulty in obtaining alms—such as food grown indoors, food cooked indoors, food cooked by oneself, food received by special arrangement, food brought from there, food received before the meal, food gathered in the forest, or food gathered from a lotus pond—are the monks still partaking of these now?" "They are, Blessed One." Then, on this occasion, the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: "Monks, those allowances I have permitted for you—during times of scarcity, poor harvests, and difficulty in obtaining alms—such as food grown indoors, food cooked indoors, food cooked by oneself, or food received by special arrangement—from today onward, I revoke them. Monks, you should not partake of food grown indoors, food cooked indoors, or food received by special arrangement. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrongdoing. And, monks, food brought from there, food received before the meal, food gathered in the forest, or food gathered from a lotus pond should not be partaken of by one who has finished eating and declined further food, unless it is a permissible leftover. Whoever does so should be dealt with according to the rule."

Tena kho pana samayena jānapadā manussā bahuṃ loṇampi, telampi, taṇḍulampi, khādanīyampi sakaṭesu āropetvā bahārāmakoṭṭhake sakaṭaparivaṭṭaṃ karitvā acchanti – yadā paṭipāṭiṃ labhissāma, tadā bhattaṃ karissāmāti.

Atha kho āyasmā ānando bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesi. ‘‘Tena hānanda, saṅgho paccantimaṃ vihāraṃ kappiyabhūmiṃ sammannitvā tattha vāsetu, yaṃ saṅgho ākaṅkhati vihāraṃ vā aḍḍhayogaṃ vā pāsādaṃ vā hammiyaṃ vā guhaṃ vā. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, sammannitabbā. Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

At that time, people from the countryside had loaded much salt, oil, rice, and food onto carts. After arranging their carts in a circle in the outer monastery enclosure, they stood waiting, thinking, "When we get our turn, we’ll prepare a meal." Then a great cloud arose. Those people approached Venerable Ānanda and said, "Venerable Ānanda, much salt, oil, rice, and food have been loaded onto carts and are standing here, and a great cloud has arisen. What should be done, Venerable Ānanda?" Then Venerable Ānanda reported the matter to the Blessed One. "In that case, Ānanda, let the Saṅgha designate a monastery as permissible ground and allow them to stay there—whatever the Saṅgha desires: a monastery, a lean-to, a mansion, a dwelling with an attic, or a cave. And this is how it should be designated, monks. A monk who is competent and able should inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmaṃ vihāraṃ kappiyabhūmiṃ sammanneyya, esā ñatti.

"Venerable Sir, may the Saṅgha hear me. If the Saṅgha is ready, let the Saṅgha designate the dwelling of such-and-such a name as a permissible site. This is the motion."

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ vihāraṃ kappiyabhūmiṃ sammannati. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa vihārassa kappiyabhūmiyā sammuti, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

"Venerable sir, may the Saṅgha hear me. The Saṅgha is designating such-and-such a monastery as a permissible ground. If it is agreeable to the venerable ones to designate such-and-such a monastery as a permissible ground, let them remain silent; if it is not agreeable, let them speak."

‘‘Sammato saṅghena itthannāmo vihāro kappiyabhūmi. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

"The Saṅgha has approved the monastery named such-and-such as allowable ground. It is pleasing to the Saṅgha; therefore they are silent. Thus I hold it."

Tena kho pana samayena manussā tattheva sammutiyā [sammatikāya (syā.)] kappiyabhūmiyā yāguyo pacanti, bhattāni pacanti, sūpāni sampādenti, maṃsāni koṭṭenti, kaṭṭhāni phālenti.

At that time, people were cooking porridge, preparing meals, making soups, pounding meat, and splitting firewood right there in the designated permissible area. The Blessed One heard a loud noise, a great noise, the clamorous noise of crows early in the morning after rising. Hearing this, he addressed Venerable Ānanda: "Ānanda, what is this loud noise, great noise, the clamorous noise of crows?" "Venerable sir, people are now cooking porridge, preparing meals, making soups, pounding meat, and splitting firewood right there in the designated permissible area. That is why, Blessed One, there is this loud noise, great noise, the clamorous noise of crows." Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, in this connection, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: "Monks, a designated permissible area should not be used. Whoever uses it commits an offense of wrong conduct. I allow, monks, three types of permissible areas: an area designated by proclamation, an unenclosed area, and a householder's residence."

Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā yasojo gilāno hoti. Tassatthāya bhesajjāni āhariyanti. Tāni bhikkhū bahi vāsenti. Ukkapiṇḍikāpi khādanti, corāpi haranti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

At that time, moreover, Venerable Yasojā was ill. Medicines were brought for him. The monks stored them outside. Rats also ate them, and thieves stole them. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, to make a designation to use a permissible area. I allow, monks, four kinds of permissible areas: an area designated by proclamation, an unenclosed area, a householder's residence, and an area designated by formal resolution."

Kappiyabhūmianujānanā niṭṭhitā.

The authorization of suitable grounds is concluded.

180.The Story of the Householder Meṇḍaka

296. Tena kho pana samayena bhaddiyanagare meṇḍako gahapati paṭivasati. Tassa evarūpo iddhānubhāvo hoti – sīsaṃ nahāyitvā dhaññāgāraṃ sammajjāpetvā bahidvāre nisīdati, antalikkhā dhaññassa dhārā opatitvā dhaññāgāraṃ pūreti. Bhariyāya evarūpo iddhānubhāvo hoti – ekaṃyeva āḷhakathālikaṃ upanisīditvā ekañca sūpabhiñjanakaṃ [sūpabhiñjarakaṃ (sī.)] dāsakammakaraporisaṃ bhattena parivisati, na tāva taṃ khiyyati [khīyati (sī. syā.)] yāva sā na vuṭṭhāti.

Dāsassa evarūpo iddhānubhāvo hoti – ekena naṅgalena kasantassa satta sītāyo gacchanti.

296.Now at that time, the householder Meṇḍaka resided in the city of Bhaddiya. He possessed such supernormal power: after washing his head and having the granary swept, he would sit outside the door, and a stream of grain would fall from the sky, filling the granary. His wife possessed such supernormal power: sitting with a single āḷhaka-measure pot and a single pot of curry and relish, she would serve food to the servants and workers, and it would not diminish until she rose. Their son possessed such supernormal power: taking a single purse containing a thousand (coins), he would give six months’ wages to the servants and workers, and it would not diminish as long as it remained in his hand. Their daughter-in-law possessed such supernormal power: sitting with a single four-doṇa basket, she would give six months’ rations to the servants and workers, and it would not diminish until she rose. Their slave possessed such supernormal power: when plowing with a single plow, seven furrows would be made.

Assosi kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro – ‘‘amhākaṃ kira vijite bhaddiyanagare meṇḍako gahapati paṭivasati.

King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha heard: “It is said that in our territory, in the city of Bhaddiya, lives the householder Meṇḍaka. He possesses such supernormal power—after washing his head and having the granary swept, he sits outside the door, and a stream of grain falls from the sky, filling the granary. His wife has such supernormal power—sitting down with just one āḷhaka-measure pot and one pot of curry and relish, she serves the servants and workers with food, and it does not run out until she gets up. His son has such supernormal power—taking just one purse containing a thousand (coins), he gives six months’ wages to the servants and workers, and it does not run out as long as it remains in his hand. His daughter-in-law has such supernormal power—sitting down with just one four-doṇa basket, she gives six months’ rations to the servants and workers, and it does not run out until she gets up. His slave has such supernormal power—plowing with one plow, he makes seven furrows at once.” Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha addressed a certain general minister: “Sir, it is said that in our territory, in the city of Bhaddiya, lives the householder Meṇḍaka. He possesses such supernormal power—after washing his head… his wife… his son… his daughter-in-law… his slave has such supernormal power, and when plowing with one plow, he makes seven furrows at once. Go, sir, and find out. What I have seen for myself, you will see.”

297.“Very well, lord,” replied the general minister to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha. Then, with the fourfold army, he set out for Bhaddiya. Gradually, he reached Bhaddiya and approached the householder Meṇḍaka. Upon arrival, he said to Meṇḍaka the householder: “Householder, I have been commanded by the king: ‘It is said, good sir, that in our realm, in the city of Bhaddiya, dwells the householder Meṇḍaka, who possesses such supernormal power—after he washes his head… his wife… his son… his daughter-in-law… his slave possesses such supernormal power, and when he plows with a single plow, seven furrows are made simultaneously.’ Go, good sir, and find out. As I have seen it myself, so you will see it too. Let us witness your supernormal power, householder.” Then Meṇḍaka the householder washed his head, had the granary swept clean, and sat outside the door. A shower of grain fell from the sky and filled the granary. “We have seen your supernormal power, householder. Now let us see your wife’s supernormal power.” Meṇḍaka then instructed his wife: “Well then, serve the fourfold army with food.” His wife sat down with a single āḷhaka-measure pot and a single pot of curry and relish, and served the fourfold army with food. It did not diminish until she rose from her seat. “We have seen your wife’s supernormal power, householder. Now let us see your son’s supernormal power.” Meṇḍaka instructed his son: “Well then, give the fourfold army six months’ wages.” His son took a single purse containing a thousand (coins) and gave the fourfold army six months’ wages. It did not diminish as long as it remained in his hand. “We have seen your son’s supernormal power, householder. Now let us see your daughter-in-law’s supernormal power.” Meṇḍaka instructed his daughter-in-law: “Well then, give the fourfold army six months’ rations.” His daughter-in-law sat down with a single four-doṇa basket and gave the fourfold army six months’ rations. It did not diminish until she rose from her seat. “We have seen your daughter-in-law’s supernormal power, householder. Now let us see your slave’s supernormal power.” “My lord, the slave’s supernormal power must be seen in the field.” “Enough, householder, we have seen your slave’s supernormal power too.” Then the general minister returned to Rājagaha with the fourfold army. He approached King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and reported the matter to him.

298.Then the Blessed One, having stayed in Vesālī as long as he pleased, set out on a journey to Bhaddiya with a large company of bhikkhus, numbering twelve hundred and fifty. Traveling in stages, the Blessed One eventually arrived at Bhaddiya. There he stayed in the Jātiyā Grove. The householder Meṇḍaka heard: "Indeed, the ascetic Gotama, the Sakyan son who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, has arrived at Bhaddiya and is staying in the Jātiyā Grove. About that Blessed One Gotama, such a glorious report has spread: 'For he is the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, the Fortunate One, knower of the world, the unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' He has realized with direct knowledge this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, and he makes it known to others. He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with its meaning and phrasing; and he reveals the perfectly complete and pure holy life. It is indeed good to see such Arahants." Then the householder Meṇḍaka had fine carriages harnessed, mounted a fine carriage, and with his fine carriages, he set out from Bhaddiya to see the Blessed One. Several ascetics from other sects saw Meṇḍaka the householder coming from a distance and said to him: "Where are you going, householder?" "I am going, sirs, to see the ascetic Gotama." "But householder, why would you, a proponent of action, go to see the ascetic Gotama, who teaches non-action? The ascetic Gotama teaches the doctrine of non-action and trains his disciples accordingly." Then it occurred to Meṇḍaka the householder: "Surely, the Blessed One must be an Arahant, a Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, since these ascetics are envious of him." He went as far as the carriage could go, then dismounted from the carriage and approached the Blessed One on foot. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. The Blessed One gave him a progressive talk—on generosity, on virtue, on the heavens, on the danger, vanity, and defilement of sensual pleasures, and on the benefits of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that Meṇḍaka’s mind was ready, pliable, free from hindrances, joyful, and confident, he then revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth would take dye evenly, so too, while Meṇḍaka the householder sat there, the dust-free, stainless vision of the Dhamma arose in him: "All that is subject to arising is subject to cessation." Having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, penetrated the Dhamma, overcome doubt, dispelled uncertainty, gained confidence, and become independent of others in the Teacher’s dispensation, he said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, venerable sir!... From today, may the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. And, venerable sir, may the Blessed One accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of bhikkhus." The Blessed One consented by silence. Then Meṇḍaka the householder, understanding the Blessed One’s consent, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed.

Atha kho meṇḍako gahapati tassā rattiyā accayena paṇītaṃ khādanīyaṃ bhojanīyaṃ paṭiyādāpetvā bhagavato kālaṃ ārocāpesi – ‘‘kālo, bhante, niṭṭhitaṃ bhatta’’nti.

Atha kho meṇḍako gahapati buddhappamukhaṃ bhikkhusaṅghaṃ paṇītena khādanīyena bhojanīyena sahatthā santappetvā sampavāretvā bhagavantaṃ bhuttāviṃ onītapattapāṇiṃ ekamantaṃ nisīdi.

Atha kho bhagavā meṇḍakaṃ gahapatiṃ dhammiyā kathāya sandassetvā samādapetvā samuttejetvā sampahaṃsetvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkāmi.

Then, when the night had passed, the householder Meṇḍaka had fine food prepared and announced the time to the Blessed One: "It is time, venerable sir, the meal is ready." Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe and went to the residence of the householder Meṇḍaka. Having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat together with the community of monks. Then the wife, son, daughter-in-law, and servant of the householder Meṇḍaka approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. The Blessed One gave them a progressive talk, that is, on generosity... having become independent of others in the Teacher's dispensation, they said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, venerable sir... We go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of monks. May the Blessed One remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge from this day forward, for as long as life lasts." Then the householder Meṇḍaka personally served and satisfied the community of monks headed by the Buddha with fine food. When the Blessed One had finished eating and had put away his bowl, the householder Meṇḍaka sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the householder Meṇḍaka said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, as long as the Blessed One remains in Bhaddiya, I will provide a constant meal for the community of monks headed by the Buddha." Then the Blessed One, having instructed, inspired, encouraged, and gladdened the householder Meṇḍaka with a Dhamma talk, rose from his seat and departed.

Meṇḍakagahapativattha niṭṭhitaṃ.

The story of the householder Meṇḍaka is concluded.

299.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Bhaddiya as long as he pleased, set out for Anguttarāpa without taking leave of the householder Meṇḍaka, accompanied by a large Sangha of monks, one thousand two hundred and fifty in number. The householder Meṇḍaka heard: "The Blessed One, it seems, has set out for Anguttarāpa accompanied by a large Sangha of monks, one thousand two hundred and fifty in number." Then the householder Meṇḍaka ordered his male and female slaves and workers: "Come now, good sirs, load much salt, oil, rice, and foodstuffs onto carts and come. And let one thousand two hundred and fifty cowherds and one thousand two hundred and fifty milch cows come, taking them with you. Wherever we see the Blessed One, there we will offer a meal with fresh milk." Then the householder Meṇḍaka encountered the Blessed One along the road in a desolate area. Then the householder Meṇḍaka approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, the householder Meṇḍaka said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, may the Blessed One together with the Sangha of monks accept my meal for tomorrow." The Blessed One consented by remaining silent. Then the householder Meṇḍaka, knowing of the Blessed One's consent, paid homage to him, circumambulated him, and departed.

Then, when the night had passed, the householder Meṇḍaka had fine food, both hard and soft, prepared and announced the time to the Blessed One: “It is time, Venerable Sir, the meal is ready.” Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the place where the meal was being served at the householder Meṇḍaka’s residence. Having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat together with the community of monks. Then the householder Meṇḍaka instructed twelve hundred and fifty cowherds: “Come now, lads, take one cow each and attend to each monk with fresh milk—we shall serve them.” Then the householder Meṇḍaka personally served and satisfied the community of monks headed by the Buddha with fine food, both hard and soft, and fresh milk. The monks, being scrupulous, did not accept the milk. [The Blessed One said:] “Accept it, monks, and consume it.” Then, after serving and satisfying the community of monks headed by the Buddha with fine food, both hard and soft, and fresh milk, and when the Blessed One had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl, the householder Meṇḍaka sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, he said to the Blessed One: “Venerable Sir, there are roads through wildernesses with little water and little food, where it is not easy to travel without provisions. It would be good, Venerable Sir, if the Blessed One would allow provisions for the monks.” Then the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened the householder Meṇḍaka with a Dhamma talk, after which he rose from his seat and departed. Then, on this occasion, the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow five products of the cow: milk, curd, buttermilk, butter, and ghee. There are, monks, roads through wildernesses with little water and little food, where it is not easy to travel without provisions. I allow you to seek provisions: rice for one who needs rice, mung beans for one who needs mung beans, beans for one who needs beans, salt for one who needs salt, sugar for one who needs sugar, oil for one who needs oil, and ghee for one who needs ghee. There are, monks, faithful and devoted people who place money in the hands of those who are suitable to handle it, saying, ‘With this, give the venerable what is allowable.’ I allow you, monks, to make use of what is allowable from that. However, I do not say that gold or silver should be sought or accepted in any way.”

Pañcagorasādianujānanā niṭṭhitā.

The allowance regarding the five products of the cow is completed.

182.The Story of the Ascetic Keṇiya with Matted Hair

300. [ma. ni. 2.396 ādayo; su. ni. selasuttampi passitabbaṃ] Atha kho bhagavā anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena āpaṇaṃ tadavasari.

Atha kho keṇiyassa jaṭilassa etadahosi – ‘‘kiṃ nu kho ahaṃ samaṇassa gotamassa harāpeyya’’nti.

Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, ucchurasa’’nti.

300.Then the Blessed One, traveling by stages, arrived at Āpaṇa. The matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya heard: “Indeed, the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, has arrived at Āpaṇa. A good report about Master Gotama has spread thus: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ It is good to see such perfected ones.” Then the matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya thought: “What should I offer to the ascetic Gotama?” Then the matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya thought: “Those ancient seers among the brahmins, the makers of mantras, the expounders of mantras, whose ancient mantras are now chanted, pronounced, and collected by the brahmins—such as Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu—they abstained from food at night, refrained from eating at improper times, and they enjoyed such drinks. The ascetic Gotama also abstains from food at night, refrains from eating at improper times. The ascetic Gotama is worthy to enjoy such drinks.” Having prepared abundant drinks and, having had them taken in pots, he approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Blessed One, and when the courteous and amiable talk was finished, he stood to one side. Standing to one side, the matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya said to the Blessed One: “May Master Gotama accept this drink.” [The Blessed One said:] “Then, Keṇiya, give it to the monks.” So the matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya gave it to the monks. The monks, being scrupulous, did not accept it. [The Blessed One said:] “Accept it, monks, and consume it.” Then the matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya personally served and satisfied the community of monks headed by the Buddha with abundant drinks. When the Blessed One had washed his hands and put aside his bowl, he sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened the matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya with a Dhamma talk. Then the matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya, having been instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened by the Blessed One’s Dhamma talk, said to him: “May Master Gotama together with the community of monks accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” [The Blessed One said:] “The community of monks is large, Keṇiya, consisting of twelve hundred and fifty monks, and you are devoted to the brahmins.” A second time, the matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya said to the Blessed One: “Even though, Master Gotama, the community of monks is large, consisting of twelve hundred and fifty monks, and I am devoted to the brahmins, may Master Gotama together with the community of monks accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” [The Blessed One said:] “The community of monks is large, Keṇiya, consisting of twelve hundred and fifty monks, and you are devoted to the brahmins.” A third time, the matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya said to the Blessed One: “Even though, Master Gotama, the community of monks is large, consisting of twelve hundred and fifty monks, and I am devoted to the brahmins, may Master Gotama together with the community of monks accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” The Blessed One consented by silence. Then the matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya, understanding the Blessed One’s consent, rose from his seat and left. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow eight kinds of drinks: mango drink, rose-apple drink, banana drink, plantain drink, Madhuka drink, grape drink, lotus-stalk drink, and phārusaka drink. I allow all fruit juices except grain-based juices. I allow all leaf juices except ḍāka juice. I allow all flower juices except Madhuka flower juice. I allow sugarcane juice.”

Atha kho keṇiyo jaṭilo tassā rattiyā accayena sake assame paṇītaṃ khādanīyaṃ bhojanīyaṃ paṭiyādāpetvā bhagavato kālaṃ ārocāpesi – ‘‘kālo, bho gotama, niṭṭhitaṃ bhatta’’nti. Atha kho bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena keṇiyassa jaṭilassa assamo tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi saddhiṃ bhikkhusaṅghena. Atha kho keṇiyo jaṭilo buddhappamukhaṃ bhikkhusaṅghaṃ paṇītena khādanīyena bhojanīyena sahatthā santappetvā sampavāretvā bhagavantaṃ bhuttāviṃ onītapattapāṇiṃ ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho keṇiyaṃ jaṭilaṃ bhagavā imāhi gāthāhi anumodi –

Then, when the night had passed, the matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya had fine food, both hard and soft, prepared in his own hermitage and announced the time to the Blessed One: “It is time, Venerable Gotama, the meal is ready.” Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe and went to the hermitage of the matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya. Having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat together with the community of monks. Then the matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya personally served and satisfied the community of monks headed by the Buddha with fine food, both hard and soft. When the Blessed One had finished eating and had set aside his bowl, Keṇiya sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One expressed his appreciation to the matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya with these verses:

‘‘Aggihuttamukhā yaññā, sāvittī chandaso mukhaṃ;Rājā mukhaṃ manussānaṃ, nadīnaṃ sāgaro mukhaṃ.

“The fire offering is the chief of sacrifices, the Sāvitrī is the chief of meters; the king is the chief of men, the ocean is the chief of rivers.

‘‘Nakkhattānaṃ mukhaṃ cando, ādicco tapataṃ mukhaṃ;Puññaṃ ākaṅkhamānānaṃ saṅgho, ve yajataṃ mukha’’nti.

The moon is the foremost of the stars, the sun is the foremost of those that heat; for those desiring merit, the community is the foremost of sacrificers.”

Atha kho bhagavā keṇiyaṃ jaṭilaṃ imāhi gāthāhi anumoditvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkāmi.

Then the Blessed One, having expressed his appreciation to the matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya with these verses, rose from his seat and departed.

Keṇiyajaṭilavatthu niṭṭhitaṃ.

The account of the ascetic Keṇiya with matted hair is concluded.

301.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Āpaṇa as long as he pleased, set out on a journey to Kusinārā with a large company of bhikkhus, with one thousand two hundred and fifty bhikkhus. The Mallas of Kusinārā heard: “The Blessed One is coming to Kusinārā with a large company of bhikkhus, with one thousand two hundred and fifty bhikkhus.” They made a proclamation: “Whoever does not go out to meet the Blessed One will be fined five hundred kahāpaṇas.” Now at that time, Roja the Mallan was a friend of the Venerable Ānanda. Then the Blessed One, traveling by stages, arrived at Kusinārā. Then the Mallas of Kusinārā went out to meet the Blessed One. Then Roja the Mallan, having gone out to meet the Blessed One, approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, the Venerable Ānanda said to Roja the Mallan: “It is a great thing indeed, friend Roja, that you went out to meet the Blessed One.” “I, Venerable Ānanda, am not one who is greatly devoted to the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Saṅgha. But my relatives made a proclamation: ‘Whoever does not go out to meet the Blessed One will be fined five hundred kahāpaṇas.’ So, Venerable Ānanda, out of fear of the fine from my relatives, I went out to meet the Blessed One.” Then the Venerable Ānanda was displeased, thinking: “How could Roja the Mallan say such a thing?” Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “This Roja the Mallan, Bhante, is a well-known kinsman. It is of great importance that such well-known kinsmen gain confidence in this Dhamma and Discipline. It would be good, Bhante, if the Blessed One would act in such a way that Roja the Mallan might gain confidence in this Dhamma and Discipline.” “It is not difficult, Ānanda, for the Tathāgata to act in such a way that Roja the Mallan might gain confidence in this Dhamma and Discipline.”

Atha kho bhagavā rojaṃ mallaṃ mettena cittena pharitvā uṭṭhāyāsanā vihāraṃ pāvisi. Atha kho rojo mallo bhagavato mettena cittena phuṭṭho, seyyathāpi nāma gāviṃ taruṇavaccho, evameva, vihārena vihāraṃ pariveṇena pariveṇaṃ upasaṅkamitvā bhikkhū pucchati – ‘‘kahaṃ nu kho, bhante, etarahi so bhagavā viharati arahaṃ sammāsambuddho, dassanakāmā hi mayaṃ taṃ bhagavantaṃ arahantaṃ sammāsambuddha’’nti. ‘‘Esāvuso roja, vihāro saṃvutadvāro, tena appasaddo upasaṅkamitvā ataramāno āḷindaṃ pavisitvā ukkāsitvā aggaḷaṃ ākoṭehi, vivarissati te bhagavā dvāra’’nti. Atha kho rojo mallo yena so vihāro saṃvutadvāro, tena appasaddo upasaṅkamitvā ataramāno āḷindaṃ pavisitvā ukkāsitvā aggaḷaṃ ākoṭesi. Vivari bhagavā dvāraṃ. Atha kho rojo mallo vihāraṃ pavisitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnassa kho rojassa mallassa bhagavā anupubbiṃ kathaṃ kathesi, seyyathidaṃ – dānakathaṃ…pe… aparappaccayo satthusāsane bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sādhu, bhante, ayyā mamaññeva paṭiggaṇheyyuṃ cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhāraṃ, no aññesa’’nti. ‘‘Yesaṃ kho, roja, sekkhena ñāṇena sekkhena dassanena dhammo diṭṭho seyyathāpi tayā, tesampi evaṃ hoti – ‘aho nūna ayyā amhākaññeva paṭiggaṇheyyuṃ cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhāraṃ, no aññesa’nti. Tena hi, roja, tava ceva paṭiggahissanti aññesañcā’’ti.

Then the Blessed One, having suffused Roja the Malla with a mind of loving-kindness, rose from his seat and entered his dwelling. Then Roja the Malla, touched by the Blessed One’s mind of loving-kindness, just as a young calf [follows its mother cow,] so too he went from dwelling to dwelling, from enclosure to enclosure, asking the monks: “Venerable sirs, where is the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, staying now? For I wish to see that Blessed One, Arahant, Perfectly Enlightened One.” “That, friend Roja, is the dwelling with the door closed. Approach it quietly, without haste. Enter the verandah, clear your throat, and knock on the latch. The Blessed One will open the door for you.” Then Roja the Malla approached that closed-door dwelling quietly, without haste. He entered the verandah, cleared his throat, and knocked on the latch. The Blessed One opened the door. Then Roja the Mallan entered the dwelling, paid homage to the Blessed One, and sat down to one side. As he sat to one side, the Blessed One gave Roja the Malla a progressive talk, that is, a talk on generosity, on morality, on the heavens, on the drawbacks, degradation, and defilement of sensual pleasures, and on the benefits of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that Roja the Malla’s mind was ready, pliable, free from hindrances, uplifted, and confident, he then expounded to him the Dhamma-talk special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth, free of stains, would readily absorb dye, so too, as Roja the Malla sat there, the dust-free, stainless Eye of Dhamma arose in him: “Whatever is subject to origination is subject to cessation.” Then Roja the Malla, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, penetrated the Dhamma, having overcome doubt, having dispelled uncertainty, having gained full confidence in the Teacher’s instruction, without relying on others, said to the Blessed One: “Excellent, venerable sir! May the venerable ones accept robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicinal requisites only from me, and not from others.” “Roja, those who have seen the Dhamma with the trainee's knowledge and the trainee's vision—as you have—also think thus: ‘If only the venerable ones would accept robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicinal requisites only from us, and not from others.’ Therefore, Roja, they will accept from you as well as from others.”

302.Now at that time in Kusinārā there was a regular distribution of excellent food. Then the Malla named Roja, not receiving his turn, thought: “Why don't I inspect the refectory? Whatever is lacking there, I will prepare.” Then the Malla Roja, inspecting the refectory, did not see two things: ḍāka and flour-based foods. Then the Malla Roja approached the Venerable Ānanda and said: “Venerable Ānanda, not receiving my turn, I thought: ‘Why don't I inspect the refectory? Whatever is lacking there, I will prepare.’ Venerable Ānanda, inspecting the refectory, I did not see two things: ḍāka and flour-based foods. If I were to prepare ḍāka and flour-based foods, would the Blessed One accept it from me?” “Well then, Roja, I will ask the Blessed One.” Then the Venerable Ānanda informed the Blessed One of the matter. “Well then, Ānanda, let him prepare it.” “Well then, Roja, prepare it.” Then the Malla Roja, after the night had passed, had a large quantity of ḍāka and flour-based foods prepared and offered it to the Blessed One, saying: “Venerable sir, may the Blessed One accept ḍāka and flour-based foods from me.” “Well then, Roja, give it to the monks.” Then the Malla Roja gave it to the monks. The monks, being scrupulous, did not accept it. “Accept, monks, and eat.” Then the Malla Roja, having personally served and satisfied the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha with abundant ḍāka and flour-based foods, sat down to one side while the Blessed One washed his hands and put away his bowl. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened the Malla Roja with a Dhamma talk, then rose from his seat and departed. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow all ḍāka and all flour-based foods.”

The story of Roja the Malla is concluded.

184.The Story of the Elder Renunciant

303. Atha kho bhagavā kusinārāyaṃ yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena ātumā tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi mahatā bhikkhusaṅghena saddhiṃ aḍḍhatelasehi bhikkhusatehi. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro vuḍḍhapabbajito ātumāyaṃ paṭivasati nahāpitapubbo. Tassa dve dārakā honti, mañjukā paṭibhāneyyakā, dakkhā pariyodātasippā sake ācariyake nahāpitakamme. Assosi kho so vuḍḍhapabbajito – ‘‘bhagavā kira ātumaṃ āgacchati mahatā bhikkhusaṅghena saddhiṃ aḍḍhatelasehi bhikkhusatehī’’ti. Atha kho so vuḍḍhapabbajito te dārake etadavoca – ‘‘bhagavā kira, tātā, ātumaṃ āgacchati mahatā bhikkhusaṅghena saddhiṃ aḍḍhatelasehi bhikkhusatehi. Gacchatha tumhe, tātā, khurabhaṇḍaṃ ādāya nāḷiyāvāpakena anugharakaṃ anugharakaṃ āhiṇḍatha, loṇampi, telampi, taṇḍulampi, khādanīyampi saṃharatha, bhagavato āgatassa yāgupānaṃ karissāmā’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, tātā’’ti kho te dārakā tassa vuḍḍhapabbajitassa paṭissuṇitvā khurabhaṇḍaṃ ādāya nāḷiyāvāpakena anugharakaṃ anugharakaṃ āhiṇḍanti, loṇampi, telampi, taṇḍulampi, khādanīyampi saṃharantā.

303.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Kusinārā as long as he pleased, set out on a tour towards Ātumā with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, numbering twelve hundred and fifty. Now at that time, a certain elder renunciant, formerly a barber, was residing in Ātumā. He had two sons, sweet-voiced and ingenious, skillful and with perfected craft in their own master's barbering. That elder renunciant heard: “The Blessed One, it is said, is coming to Ātumā with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, numbering twelve hundred and fifty.” Then that elder renunciant said to those boys: “Dear sons, the Blessed One, it is said, is coming to Ātumā with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, numbering twelve hundred and fifty. Go, dear sons, take your barber’s tools and a collection container, and wander from house to house, collecting salt, oil, rice, and edibles. We will prepare gruel and drink for the Blessed One when he arrives.” “Yes, father,” replied the boys to that elder renunciant. Taking their barber’s tools and a collection container, they wandered from house to house, collecting salt, oil, rice, and edibles. People, seeing those sweet-voiced and ingenious boys, even those who did not wish to have their services done, had them done, and after having them done, gave them much. Thus, the boys gathered a great deal of salt, oil, rice, and edibles.

Atha kho bhagavā anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena ātumā tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā ātumāyaṃ viharati bhusāgāre. Atha kho so vuḍḍhapabbajito tassā rattiyā accayena pahūtaṃ yāguṃ paṭiyādāpetvā bhagavato upanāmesi – ‘‘paṭiggaṇhātu me, bhante, bhagavā yāgu’’nti. Jānantāpi tathāgatā pucchanti…pe… sāvakānaṃ vā sikkhāpadaṃ paññapessāmāti. Atha kho bhagavā taṃ vuḍḍhapabbajitaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kutāyaṃ, bhikkhu yāgū’’ti? Atha kho so vuḍḍhapabbajito bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesi. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā, ‘‘ananucchavikaṃ, moghapurisa, ananulomikaṃ appatirūpaṃ assāmaṇakaṃ akappiyaṃ akaraṇīyaṃ. Kathañhi nāma tvaṃ, moghapurisa, pabbajito akappiye samādapessasi [samādapesi (ka.)]. Netaṃ, moghapurisa, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… vigarahitvā dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi ‘na, bhikkhave, pabbajitena akappiye samādapetabbaṃ, yo samādapeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Na ca, bhikkhave, nahāpitapubbena khurabhaṇḍaṃ pariharitabbaṃ. Yo parihareyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’’ti.

Then the Blessed One, traveling by stages, arrived at Ātumā. There the Blessed One stayed at the threshing hall in Ātumā. Now, that elder renunciant, after the night had passed, had a large quantity of gruel prepared and offered it to the Blessed One, saying, “Venerable sir, may the Blessed One accept this gruel from me.” Even though the Tathāgatas know, they ask…or they will lay down a training rule for the disciples. Then the Blessed One said to that elder renunciant, “Monk, where did this gruel come from?” Then that elder renunciant told the Blessed One the matter. The Blessed One rebuked him: “It is unseemly, foolish man, unsuitable, inappropriate, unbecoming for a recluse, impermissible, not to be done. How could you, foolish man, as one gone forth, encourage what is impermissible? This is not, foolish man, for inspiring confidence in those without it…” Having rebuked him and given a Dhamma talk, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Monks, one who has gone forth should not encourage what is impermissible. Whoever encourages it commits an offense of wrong-doing. And, monks, one who formerly was a barber should not carry barber’s tools. Whoever carries them commits an offense of wrong-doing.”

Atha kho bhagavā ātumāyaṃ yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena sāvatthi tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena sāvatthi tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena sāvatthiyaṃ bahuṃ phalakhādanīyaṃ uppannaṃ hoti. Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kiṃ nu kho bhagavatā phalakhādanīyaṃ anuññātaṃ, kiṃ ananuññāta’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sabbaṃ phalakhādanīya’’nti.

Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Ātumā as long as he pleased, set out on a tour towards Sāvatthī. Traveling by stages, he arrived at Sāvatthī. There the Blessed One stayed in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now at that time in Sāvatthī, much fruit and edibles had arisen. Then the bhikkhus thought: “What fruit and edibles has the Blessed One allowed, and what has he not allowed?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, bhikkhus, all fruit and edibles.”

304. Tena kho pana samayena saṅghikāni bījāni puggalikāya bhūmiyā ropiyanti, puggalikāni bījāni saṅghikāya bhūmiyā ropiyanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Saṅghikāni, bhikkhave, bījāni puggalikāya bhūmiyā ropitāni bhāgaṃ datvā paribhuñjitabbāni. Puggalikāni bījāni saṅghikāya bhūmiyā ropitāni bhāgaṃ datvā paribhuñjitabbānīti.

304.Now at that time, communal seeds were being planted in private fields, and private seeds were being planted in communal fields. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, communal seeds planted in private fields are to be consumed after giving a share. Private seeds planted in communal fields are to be consumed after giving a share.”

185.The Discourse on the Four Great References

305. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhūnaṃ kismiñci kismiñci ṭhāne kukkuccaṃ uppajjati – ‘‘kiṃ nu kho bhagavatā anuññātaṃ, kiṃ ananuññāta’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Yaṃ, bhikkhave, mayā ‘idaṃ na kappatī’ti appaṭikkhittaṃ tañce akappiyaṃ anulometi, kappiyaṃ paṭibāhati, taṃ vo na kappati. Yaṃ, bhikkhave, mayā ‘idaṃ na kappatī’ti appaṭikkhittaṃ tañce kappiyaṃ anulometi, akappiyaṃ paṭibāhati, taṃ vo kappati. Yaṃ, bhikkhave, mayā ‘idaṃ kappatī’ti ananuññātaṃ tañce akappiyaṃ anulometi, kappiyaṃ paṭibāhati, taṃ vo na kappati. Yaṃ, bhikkhave, mayā ‘idaṃ kappatī’ti ananuññātaṃ, tañce kappiyaṃ anulometi, akappiyaṃ paṭibāhati, taṃ vo kappatī’’ti.

305.Now at that time, doubts arose in the monks in various places, wondering: "What has the Blessed One allowed? What has he not allowed?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. [He replied:] "Monks, whatever I have not forbidden by saying, 'This is not allowable,' if it accords with what is unallowable and opposes what is allowable, that is not allowable for you. Monks, whatever I have not forbidden by saying, 'This is not allowable,' if it accords with what is allowable and opposes what is unallowable, that is allowable for you. Monks, whatever I have not allowed by saying, 'This is allowable,' if it accords with what is unallowable and opposes what is allowable, that is not allowable for you. Monks, whatever I have not allowed by saying, 'This is allowable,' if it accords with what is allowable and opposes what is unallowable, that is allowable for you."

Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kappati nu kho yāvakālikena yāmakālikaṃ, na nu kho kappati? Kappati nu kho yāvakālikena sattāhakālikaṃ, na nu kho kappati? Kappati nu kho yāvakālikena yāvajīvikaṃ, na nu kho kappati? Kappati nu kho yāmakālikena sattāhakālikaṃ, na nu kho kappati? Kappati nu kho yāmakālikena yāvajīvikaṃ, na nu kho kappati? Kappati nu kho sattāhakālikena yāvajīvikaṃ, na nu kho kappatī’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Yāvakālikena, bhikkhave, yāmakālikaṃ, tadahu paṭiggahitaṃ kāle kappati, vikāle na kappati. Yāvakālikena, bhikkhave, sattāhakālikaṃ, tadahu paṭiggahitaṃ kāle kappati, vikāle na kappati. Yāvakālikena, bhikkhave, yāvajīvikaṃ, tadahu paṭiggahitaṃ kāle kappati, vikāle na kappati. Yāmakālikena, bhikkhave, sattāhakālikaṃ, tadahu paṭiggahitaṃ yāme kappati, yāmātikkante na kappati. Yāmakālikena, bhikkhave, yāvajīvikaṃ, tadahu paṭiggahitaṃ yāme kappati, yāmātikkante na kappati. Sattāhakālikena, bhikkhave, yāvajīvikaṃ paṭiggahitaṃ, sattāhaṃ kappati, sattāhātikkante na kappatī’’ti.

Then the monks thought: "Is it allowable to use what is allowable for a limited time for what is allowable for a watch, or is it not allowable? Is it allowable to use what is allowable for a limited time for what is allowable for a week, or is it not allowable? Is it allowable to use what is allowable for a limited time for what is allowable for life, or is it not allowable? Is it allowable to use what is allowable for a watch for what is allowable for a week, or is it not allowable? Is it allowable to use what is allowable for a watch for what is allowable for life, or is it not allowable? Is it allowable to use what is allowable for a week for what is allowable for life, or is it not allowable?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, when what is allowable for a limited time is used for what is allowable for a watch, if it is received on that day, it is allowable at the (proper) time but not at the improper time. Monks, when what is allowable for a limited time is used for what is allowable for a week, if it is received on that day, it is allowable at the (proper) time but not at the improper time. Monks, when what is allowable for a limited time is used for what is allowable for life, if it is received on that day, it is allowable at the (proper) time but not at the improper time. Monks, when what is allowable for a watch is used for what is allowable for a week, if it is received on that day, it is allowable during the watch but not after the watch has passed. Monks, when what is allowable for a watch is used for what is allowable for life, if it is received on that day, it is allowable during the watch but not after the watch has passed. Monks, when what is allowable for a week is received for what is allowable for life, it is allowable for seven days but not after the seven days have passed."
