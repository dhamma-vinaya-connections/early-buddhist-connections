132.At that time the Buddha, the Blessed One, was dwelling at Rājagaha on Vulture Peak Mountain. Now at that time, wandering ascetics of other sects gathered on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth days of the fortnight to teach the Dhamma. People approached them to listen to the Dhamma. They gained affection for the wandering ascetics of other sects, gained confidence in them, and sided with the wandering ascetics of other sects. Then, while King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was alone in seclusion, this thought arose in his mind: "Nowadays, wandering ascetics of other sects gather on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth days of the fortnight to teach the Dhamma. People approach them to listen to the Dhamma. They gain affection for the wandering ascetics of other sects, gain confidence in them, and side with the wandering ascetics of other sects. Why don’t the venerable ones also gather on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth days of the fortnight?" Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha said to the Blessed One: "Just now, Venerable Sir, while I was alone in seclusion, this thought arose in my mind: 'Nowadays, wandering ascetics of other sects gather on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth days of the fortnight to teach the Dhamma. People approach them to listen to the Dhamma. They gain affection for the wandering ascetics of other sects, gain confidence in them, and side with the wandering ascetics of other sects. Why don’t the venerable ones also gather on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth days of the fortnight?' It would be good, Venerable Sir, if the venerable ones also gathered on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth days of the fortnight." Then the Blessed One instructed, inspired, aroused, and gladdened King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha with a Dhamma talk. Having been instructed, inspired, aroused, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed. Then, on this occasion, in this connection, having given a Dhamma talk, the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks, I allow you to gather on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth days of the fortnight."

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū – bhagavatā anuññātā cātuddase pannarase aṭṭhamiyā ca pakkhassa sannipatitunti – cātuddase pannarase aṭṭhamiyā ca pakkhassa sannipatitvā tuṇhī nisīdanti. Te manussā upasaṅkamanti dhammassavanāya. Te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma samaṇā sakyaputtiyā cātuddase pannarase aṭṭhamiyā ca pakkhassa sannipatitvā tuṇhī nisīdissanti, seyyathāpi mūgasūkarā. Nanu nāma sannipatitehi dhammo bhāsitabbo’’ti. Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū tesaṃ manussānaṃ ujjhāyantānaṃ khiyyantānaṃ vipācentānaṃ. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, cātuddase pannarase aṭṭhamiyā ca pakkhassa sannipatitvā dhammaṃ bhāsitu’’nti.

At that time, the monks, having been permitted by the Blessed One to assemble on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth days of the fortnight, assembled on those days and sat in silence. People approached to hear the Dhamma. They complained, were displeased, and criticized: "How indeed can these Sakyan ascetics assemble on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth days of the fortnight and sit in silence, like dumb pigs? Surely, when assembled, the Dhamma should be spoken!" The monks heard these people complaining, being displeased, and criticizing. Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One… Then the Blessed One, on that occasion, in this connection, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: "Monks, I allow you to assemble on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth days of the fortnight and speak the Dhamma."

69.The Authorization to Recite the Pātimokkha

133. Atha kho bhagavato rahogatassa paṭisallīnassa evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – ‘‘yaṃnūnāhaṃ yāni mayā bhikkhūnaṃ paññattāni sikkhāpadāni, tāni nesaṃ pātimokkhuddesaṃ anujāneyyaṃ.

So nesaṃ bhavissati uposathakamma’nti. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, pātimokkhaṃ uddisituṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, uddisitabbaṃ. Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

133.Then, while the Blessed One was alone in seclusion, this thought arose in his mind: “Suppose I were to allow the bhikkhus to recite the Pātimokkha, the training rules I have laid down for them. That would be their Uposatha observance.” Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and, on that occasion, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, while I was alone in seclusion, this thought arose in my mind: ‘Suppose I were to allow the bhikkhus to recite the Pātimokkha, the training rules I have laid down for them. That would be their Uposatha observance.’ Bhikkhus, I allow the Pātimokkha to be recited. And, bhikkhus, it should be recited thus. A competent and capable bhikkhu should inform the Saṅgha:

134. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho uposathaṃ kareyya, pātimokkhaṃ uddiseyya. Kiṃ saṅghassa pubbakiccaṃ? Pārisuddhiṃ āyasmanto ārocetha. Pātimokkhaṃ uddisissāmi. Taṃ sabbeva santā sādhukaṃ suṇoma manasi karoma. Yassa siyā āpatti, so āvikareyya. Asantiyā āpattiyā tuṇhī bhavitabbaṃ. Tuṇhībhāvena kho panāyasmante parisuddhāti vedissāmi. Yathā kho pana paccekapuṭṭhassa veyyākaraṇaṃ hoti, evamevaṃ [evameva (ka)] evarūpāya parisāya yāvatatiyaṃ anussāvitaṃ hoti.

Tasmā, saramānena bhikkhunā āpannena visuddhāpekkhena santī āpatti āvikātabbā; āvikatā hissa phāsu hotī’’ti.

134.‘Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha listen to me. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, let the Saṅgha observe the Uposatha and recite the Pātimokkha. What is the Saṅgha’s preliminary duty? Venerable sirs, please announce your purity. I will recite the Pātimokkha. Let us all who are present listen carefully and pay attention. If anyone has an offense, let him reveal it. If there is no offense, silence should be maintained. By your silence, I will understand that the venerable ones are pure. Just as when each individual is questioned, so too is it announced to this assembly up to the third time. Any bhikkhu who, while it is being announced up to the third time, remembers an offense and does not reveal it, is guilty of intentional false speech. Venerable sirs, the Blessed One has said that intentional false speech is an obstructive factor. Therefore, a bhikkhu who remembers an offense and desires purification should reveal it; for having revealed it, he will be at ease.’

135.The Pātimokkha is the beginning, the face, the forefront of wholesome qualities. Therefore, it is called the Pātimokkha. “Venerable ones” is a term of endearment, a term of respect, a term of reverence and deference—thus, “venerable ones.” “I will recite” means I will recount, teach, prescribe, establish, clarify, analyze, reveal, and make known. That is called the Pātimokkha. “All are present” means all who are in the assembly—whether elders, novices, or those in between—these are called “all are present.” “Listen carefully” means we should attend, making an effort, directing our mind, with full awareness. “Pay attention” means with unified mind, undistracted mind, unscattered mind—we should listen. “If anyone has an offense” refers to an offense belonging to any of the five groups of offenses or the seven groups of offenses—whether of an elder, a novice, or one in between. “He should disclose it” means he should confess, reveal, make clear, and declare it—whether in the midst of the Saṅgha, a group, or to an individual. An offense called ‘non-existent’ is one that has not been incurred, or one that has been incurred and then risen from. “Silence should be maintained” means it should be accepted in silence; nothing should be said. “I will know that the venerable ones are pure” means I will know, I will remember. “As each one is questioned, a reply is given” means just as one questioned individually would respond, so too should the assembly understand: “He is asking me.” Such an assembly is called a community of bhikkhus. “Up to the third announcement” means announced once, announced a second time, announced a third time. “Remembering” means knowing, recognizing. An offense called ‘existent’ is one that has been incurred, or one that has been incurred and not risen from. “He should not disclose it” means he should not confess, reveal, make clear, or declare it—whether in the midst of the Saṅgha, a group, or to an individual. “There is intentional false speech.” What happens in intentional false speech? It is an offense of wrong-doing. “An obstructive factor has been declared by the Blessed One.” Obstructive to what? Obstructive to attaining the first jhāna, obstructive to attaining the second jhāna, obstructive to attaining the third jhāna, obstructive to attaining the fourth jhāna, obstructive to attaining jhānas, liberations, concentrations, attainments, renunciations, detachment, isolations, and wholesome qualities. “Therefore” means for that reason. “Remembering” means knowing, recognizing. “Desiring purity” means wishing to be free, wishing to be purified. An offense called ‘existent’ is one that has been incurred, or one that has been incurred and not risen from. “It should be disclosed” means it should be disclosed—whether in the midst of the Saṅgha, a group, or to an individual. “For one who discloses it, there is ease.” Ease in what? Ease in attaining the first jhāna, ease in attaining the second jhāna, ease in attaining the third jhāna, ease in attaining the fourth jhāna, ease in attaining jhānas, liberations, concentrations, attainments, renunciations, detachment, isolations, and wholesome qualities.

136. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū – bhagavatā pātimokkhuddeso anuññātoti – devasikaṃ pātimokkhaṃ uddisanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, devasikaṃ pātimokkhaṃ uddisitabbaṃ. Yo uddiseyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, uposathe pātimokkhaṃ uddisitunti.

136.At that time, the bhikkhus—thinking, “the recitation of the Pātimokkha has been allowed by the Blessed One”—recited the Pātimokkha daily. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, the Pātimokkha should not be recited daily. Whoever recites it incurs an offense of wrong-doing. Bhikkhus, I allow the Pātimokkha to be recited on the Uposatha day.”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū – bhagavatā uposathe pātimokkhuddeso anuññātoti – pakkhassa tikkhattuṃ pātimokkhaṃ uddisanti, cātuddase pannarase aṭṭhamiyā ca pakkhassa. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, pakkhassa tikkhattuṃ pātimokkhaṃ uddisitabbaṃ. Yo uddiseyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sakiṃ pakkhassa cātuddase vā pannarase vā pātimokkhaṃ uddisitunti.

At that time, bhikkhus—thinking the Blessed One had allowed the recitation of the Pātimokkha on the Uposatha day—recited the Pātimokkha three times a fortnight: on the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth day of the fortnight. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, the Pātimokkha should not be recited three times a fortnight. Whoever recites it incurs an offense of wrong-doing. Bhikkhus, I allow the Pātimokkha to be recited once a fortnight, either on the fourteenth or the fifteenth.”

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū yathāparisāya pātimokkhaṃ uddisanti sakāya sakāya parisāya. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, yathāparisāya pātimokkhaṃ uddisitabbaṃ sakāya sakāya parisāya. Yo uddiseyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, samaggānaṃ uposathakammanti.

At that time the bhikkhus of the group of six recited the Pātimokkha, each according to their own assembly. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, the Pātimokkha should not be recited, each according to their own assembly. Whoever recites it incurs an offense of wrong-doing. Bhikkhus, I allow the Uposatha ceremony to be performed by a united assembly.”

Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā paññattaṃ ‘samaggānaṃ uposathakamma’nti. Kittāvatā nu kho sāmaggī hoti, yāvatā ekāvāso, udāhu sabbā pathavī’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, ettāvatā sāmaggī yāvatā ekāvāsoti.

Then the bhikkhus had this thought: “The Blessed One has prescribed ‘the Uposatha action for those in concord.’ To what extent does concord exist? Is it to the extent of one dwelling place, or the entire earth?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, I allow concord to extend as far as one dwelling place.”

70.The Story of Mahākappina

137. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā mahākappino rājagahe viharati maddakucchimhi migadāye. Atha kho āyasmato mahākappinassa rahogatassa paṭisallīnassa evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – ‘‘gaccheyyaṃ vāhaṃ uposathaṃ na vā gaccheyyaṃ, gaccheyyaṃ vāhaṃ saṅghakammaṃ na vā gaccheyyaṃ, atha khvāhaṃ visuddho paramāya visuddhiyā’’ti? Atha kho bhagavā āyasmato mahākappinassa cetasā cetoparivitakkamaññāya – seyyathāpi nāma balavā puriso samiñjitaṃ vā bāhaṃ pasāreyya, pasāritaṃ vā bāhaṃ samiñjeyya, evameva – gijjhakūṭe pabbate antarahito maddakucchimhi migadāye āyasmato mahākappinassa sammukhe pāturahosi. Nisīdi bhagavā paññatte āsane. Āyasmāpi kho mahākappino bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho āyasmantaṃ mahākappinaṃ bhagavā etadavoca – ‘‘nanu te, kappina, rahogatassa paṭisallīnassa evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – gaccheyyaṃ vāhaṃ uposathaṃ na vā gaccheyyaṃ, gaccheyyaṃ vāhaṃ saṅghakammaṃ na vā gaccheyyaṃ, atha khvāhaṃ visuddho paramāya visuddhiyā’’ti? ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’. ‘‘Tumhe ce brāhmaṇā uposathaṃ na sakkarissatha na garukarissatha [na garuṃ karissatha (ka.)] na mānessatha na pūjessatha, atha ko carahi uposathaṃ sakkarissati garukarissati mānessati pūjessati? Gaccha tvaṃ, brāhmaṇa, uposathaṃ, mā no agamāsi. Gaccha tvaṃ saṅghakammaṃ, mā no agamāsī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti kho āyasmā mahākappino bhagavato paccassosi. Atha kho bhagavā āyasmantaṃ mahākappinaṃ dhammiyā kathāya sandassetvā samādapetvā samuttejetvā sampahaṃsetvā – seyyathāpi nāma balavā puriso samiñjitaṃ vā bāhaṃ pasāreyya, pasāritaṃ vā bāhaṃ samiñjeyya, evameva – maddakucchimhi migadāye āyasmato mahākappinassa sammukhe antarahito gijjhakūṭe pabbate pāturahosi.

137.Now at that time, Venerable Mahākappina was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Maddakucchi Deer Park. Then, while Venerable Mahākappina was in seclusion, the following thought arose in his mind: "Should I go to the Uposatha or should I not go? Should I go to the Saṅgha meeting or should I not go? For I am purified to the highest purity." Then the Blessed One, knowing with his mind the thought in Venerable Mahākappina’s mind—just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm—vanished from the Vulture’s Peak and appeared before Venerable Mahākappina in the Maddakucchi Deer Park. The Blessed One sat down on a prepared seat. Venerable Mahākappina also paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the Blessed One said to Venerable Mahākappina: "Kappina, while you were in seclusion, did this thought arise in your mind: 'Should I go to the Uposatha or should I not go? Should I go to the Saṅgha meeting or should I not go? For I am purified to the highest purity'"? "Yes, Blessed One." "If you, brahmin, do not honor, respect, esteem, or venerate the Uposatha, then who else will honor, respect, esteem, or venerate the Uposatha? Go, brahmin, to the Uposatha—do not neglect it. Go to the Saṅgha meeting—do not neglect it." "Yes, Blessed One," Venerable Mahākappina replied to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, having instructed, urged, inspired, and gladdened Venerable Mahākappina with a Dhamma talk—just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm—vanished from the presence of Venerable Mahākappina in the Maddakucchi Deer Park and reappeared on the Vulture’s Peak.

71.Permission for a Boundary

138. Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā paññattaṃ ‘ettāvatā sāmaggī yāvatā ekāvāso’ti, kittāvatā nu kho ekāvāso hotī’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sīmaṃ sammannituṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, sammannitabbā – paṭhamaṃ nimittā kittetabbā – pabbatanimittaṃ, pāsāṇanimittaṃ, vananimittaṃ, rukkhanimittaṃ, magganimittaṃ, vammikanimittaṃ, nadīnimittaṃ, udakanimittaṃ. Nimitte kittetvā byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

138.Then the monks had this thought: "The Blessed One has prescribed that 'harmony extends as far as a single dwelling.' But how far does a single dwelling extend?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, the establishing of a boundary. And thus, monks, should it be established: First, the boundary markers should be designated—a mountain marker, a rock marker, a forest marker, a tree marker, a road marker, an anthill marker, a river marker, a water marker. Having designated the markers, the Saṅgha should be informed by a monk who is competent and able—

139. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yāvatā samantā nimittā kittitā. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho etehi nimittehi sīmaṃ sammanneyya samānasaṃvāsaṃ ekuposathaṃ [ekūposathaṃ (ka.)]. Esā ñatti.

139."Venerable sir, may the Saṅgha hear me. As far as all the surrounding landmarks have been designated. If it seems right to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should designate a boundary with these landmarks for common residence and a single Uposatha. This is the motion."

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yāvatā samantā nimittā kittitā. Saṅgho etehi nimittehi sīmaṃ sammannati samānasaṃvāsaṃ ekuposathaṃ. Yassāyasmato khamati etehi nimittehi sīmāya sammuti [sammati (syā.)] samānasaṃvāsāya ekuposathāya, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

"Venerable sir, may the Saṅgha hear me. As far as these surrounding boundary markers have been declared, the Saṅgha designates this boundary with these markers for common residence and a single Uposatha. Whoever agrees with the designation of this boundary by the Saṅgha with these markers for common residence and a single Uposatha, let him be silent; whoever does not agree, let him speak. The boundary is designated by the Saṅgha with these markers for common residence and a single Uposatha. The Saṅgha approves; therefore, it is silent. Thus I hold it."

140.At that time, the group of six monks—thinking that the Blessed One had allowed the agreement to a boundary—agreed to excessively large boundaries, even four, five, or six yojanas. Monks coming for the Uposatha would arrive even while the Pātimokkha was being recited, or just as it was being recited, or even in the middle. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, an excessively large boundary should not be agreed to—even four, five, or six yojanas. Whoever agrees to such a boundary commits an offense of wrong conduct. I allow, monks, a boundary to be agreed to of at most three yojanas."

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū nadīpārasīmaṃ [nadīpāraṃ sīmaṃ (sī. syā.)] sammannanti. Uposathaṃ āgacchantā bhikkhūpi vuyhanti, pattāpi vuyhanti, cīvarānipi vuyhanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, nadīpārasīmā sammannitabbā. Yo sammanneyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, yatthassa dhuvanāvā vā dhuvasetu vā, evarūpaṃ nadīpārasīmaṃ sammannitunti.

At that time, the group of six monks designated a riverbank as a boundary. Monks coming for the Uposatha were swept away by the current, as were their bowls and robes. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, a riverbank should not be designated as a boundary. Whoever designates such a boundary commits an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, a riverbank to be designated as a boundary only where there is a permanent ferry or a permanent bridge."

72.Discussion on the Uposatha Hall

141. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū anupariveṇiyaṃ pātimokkhaṃ uddisanti asaṅketena. Āgantukā bhikkhū na jānanti – ‘‘kattha vā ajjuposatho karīyissatī’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

141.At that time, monks recited the Pātimokkha in their respective residences without a prior signal. Visiting monks did not know, "Where will the Uposatha be observed today?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, the Pātimokkha should not be recited in their respective residences without a prior signal. Whoever recites it thus commits an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, to appoint an Uposatha hall for observing the Uposatha, whichever the Saṅgha prefers—a monastery, a semi-circular building, a mansion, a storied dwelling, or a cave. And this is how it should be appointed: A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmaṃ vihāraṃ uposathāgāraṃ sammanneyya. Esā ñatti.

"Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. If the Saṅgha is ready, let the Saṅgha designate such-and-such a dwelling as the Uposatha hall. This is the motion.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ vihāraṃ uposathāgāraṃ sammannati. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa vihārassa uposathāgārassa sammuti, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya. Sammato saṅghena itthannāmo vihāro uposathāgāraṃ. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

"Venerable sir, may the Saṅgha hear me. The Saṅgha designates such-and-such a dwelling-place as an Uposatha hall. If it is agreeable to any venerable one that such-and-such a dwelling-place be designated as an Uposatha hall, let him be silent; if it is not agreeable to anyone, let him speak. The Saṅgha has designated such-and-such a dwelling-place as an Uposatha hall. It is agreeable to the Saṅgha, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it."

Tena kho pana samayena aññatarasmiṃ āvāse dve uposathāgārāni sammatāni honti. Bhikkhū ubhayattha sannipatanti – ‘‘idha uposatho karīyissati, idha uposatho karīyissatī’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, ekasmiṃ āvāse dve uposathāgārāni sammannitabbāni. Yo sammanneyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, ekaṃ samūhanitvā [samuhanitvā (ka.)] ekattha uposathaṃ kātuṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, samūhantabbaṃ. Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

At that time, in a certain monastery, two Uposatha halls had been designated. The monks gathered in both places, thinking, “The Uposatha will be held here, the Uposatha will be held here.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, in a single monastery, two Uposatha halls should not be designated. Whoever designates them commits an offense of wrong conduct. I allow, monks, that one should be abolished and the Uposatha held in one place. And this is how it should be abolished: A competent monk should inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmaṃ uposathāgāraṃ samūhaneyya [samuhaneyya (ka.)]. Esā ñatti.

'Venerable Sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should remove such-and-such an Uposatha hall. This is the motion.'

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ uposathāgāraṃ samūhanati. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa uposathāgārassa samugghāto, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya. Samūhataṃ saṅghena itthannāmaṃ uposathāgāraṃ. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

‘Venerable sir, may the Saṅgha listen to me. The Saṅgha is abolishing such-and-such an Uposatha hall. Whoever among the venerables approves of the abolishment of such-and-such an Uposatha hall should remain silent; whoever does not approve should speak. The Saṅgha has abolished such-and-such an Uposatha hall. It is agreeable to the Saṅgha, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.’

73.Authorization of the Uposatha Boundary

142. Tena kho pana samayena aññatarasmiṃ āvāse atikhuddakaṃ uposathāgāraṃ sammataṃ hoti, tadahuposathe mahābhikkhusaṅgho sannipatito hoti. Bhikkhū asammatāya bhūmiyā nisinnā pātimokkhaṃ assosuṃ.

Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Sammatāya vā, bhikkhave, bhūmiyā nisinnā asammatāya vā yato pātimokkhaṃ suṇāti, katovassa uposatho. Tena hi, bhikkhave, saṅgho yāva mahantaṃ uposathappamukhaṃ [uposathamukhaṃ (syā.)] ākaṅkhati, tāva mahantaṃ uposathappamukhaṃ sammannatu. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, sammannitabbaṃ. Paṭhamaṃ nimittā kittetabbā. Nimitte kittetvā byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

142.Now on that occasion, in a certain monastery, a very small Uposatha hall had been approved. On that Uposatha day, a large Saṅgha of monks had assembled. The monks, sitting on undesignated ground, listened to the Pātimokkha. Then it occurred to those monks: "The Blessed One has laid down that the Uposatha should be performed after approving an Uposatha hall. But we listened to the Pātimokkha sitting on undesignated ground. Has our Uposatha been performed or not?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, whether sitting on designated ground or undesignated ground, as long as one hears the Pātimokkha, the Uposatha is performed. Therefore, monks, the Saṅgha should approve an Uposatha boundary as large as the area they desire. "And thus, monks, it should be approved. First, the boundaries should be defined. After defining the boundaries, a competent monk should inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yāvatā samantā nimittā kittitā. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho etehi nimittehi uposathappamukhaṃ sammanneyya. Esā ñatti.

‘Venerable sir, may the Saṅgha hear me. Boundaries have been defined all around. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, let the Saṅgha designate this area with these boundaries as the Uposatha boundary. This is the motion.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yāvatā samantā nimittā kittitā. Saṅgho etehi nimittehi uposathappamukhaṃ sammannati. Yassāyasmato khamati etehi nimittehi uposathappamukhassa sammuti, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya. Sammataṃ saṅghena etehi nimittehi uposathappamukhaṃ. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

‘Venerable Sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. The boundary signs have been marked all around. The Saṅgha designates this area with these boundary signs as the Uposatha boundary. Whoever among the venerable ones approves of the designation of the Uposatha boundary with these signs, let him be silent; whoever does not approve, let him speak. The Saṅgha has designated the Uposatha boundary with these signs. It is agreeable to the Saṅgha, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.’

Tena kho pana samayena aññatarasmiṃ āvāse tadahuposathe navakā bhikkhū paṭhamataraṃ sannipatitvā – ‘‘na tāva therā āgacchantī’’ti – pakkamiṃsu. Uposatho vikāle ahosi. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, tadahuposathe therehi bhikkhūhi paṭhamataraṃ sannipatitunti.

At that time, in a certain monastery, on the Uposatha day, some newly ordained monks assembled earlier and left, thinking, "The elders are not coming yet." The Uposatha was held at the wrong time. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, that on the Uposatha day the elder monks should assemble first."

Tena kho pana samayena rājagahe sambahulā āvāsā samānasīmā honti. Tattha bhikkhū vivadanti – ‘‘amhākaṃ āvāse uposatho karīyatu, amhākaṃ āvāse uposatho karīyatū’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Idha pana, bhikkhave, sambahulā āvāsā samānasīmā honti. Tattha bhikkhū vivadanti – ‘‘amhākaṃ āvāse uposatho karīyatu, amhākaṃ āvāse uposatho karīyatū’’ti. Tehi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi sabbeheva ekajjhaṃ sannipatitvā uposatho kātabbo. Yattha vā pana thero bhikkhu viharati, tattha sannipatitvā uposatho kātabbo, na tveva vaggena saṅghena uposatho kātabbo. Yo kareyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

At that time, at Rājagaha there were several monasteries with a shared boundary. There, the monks argued: “Let the Uposatha be performed in our monastery, let the Uposatha be performed in our monastery!” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Here, monks, when there are several monasteries with a shared boundary, and the monks argue: ‘Let the Uposatha be performed in our monastery, let the Uposatha be performed in our monastery!’—in that case, monks, all those monks should assemble together in one place and perform the Uposatha. Or else, wherever the senior monk resides, they should assemble there and perform the Uposatha. But the Uposatha should not be performed by a faction. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong conduct.”

74.Permission for a Boundary of Non-Separation

143.At that time, Venerable Mahākassapa was coming from Andhakavinda to Rājagaha for the Uposatha. While crossing a river along the way, he was overcome by the water, and his robes got wet. The monks asked Venerable Mahākassapa, "Friend, why are your robes wet?" He replied, "Friends, while I was coming from Andhakavinda to Rājagaha for the Uposatha, I was overcome by the water while crossing a river along the way. That is why my robes are wet." They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, the boundary that has been agreed upon by the Sangha—sharing a common residence and Uposatha—the Sangha should designate that boundary as non-separation from the three robes. And, monks, it should be designated in this way: A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yā sā saṅghena sīmā sammatā samānasaṃvāsā ekuposathā, yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ saṅgho taṃ sīmaṃ ticīvarena avippavāsaṃ sammanneyya. Esā ñatti.

The boundary agreed upon by the Sangha for sharing a common residence and Uposatha—the Sangha designates that boundary as non-separation from the three robes.

This boundary has been designated by the Sangha as non-separation from the three robes. It is acceptable to the Sangha, therefore it is silent. Thus do I hold it."

At that time, the monks, thinking that the Blessed One had allowed the designation of non-separation from the three robes, left their robes inside houses. Those robes were lost, burned, or eaten by rats. The monks became poorly dressed, wearing rough robes. The monks asked, "Why, friends, are you poorly dressed, wearing rough robes?" They replied, "Here, friends, thinking that the Blessed One had allowed the designation of non-separation from the three robes, we left our robes inside houses. Those robes were lost, burned, or eaten by rats. That is why we are poorly dressed, wearing rough robes." They reported this matter to the Blessed One.

Monks, when designating a boundary, first the boundary for shared residence should be designated, and afterward the non-separation regarding the three robes. Monks, when removing a boundary, first the non-separation regarding the three robes should be removed, and afterward the boundary for shared residence. And thus, monks, should the non-separation regarding the three robes be removed. A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:

145. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yo so saṅghena ticīvarena avippavāso sammato, yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho taṃ ticīvarena avippavāsaṃ samūhaneyya. Esā ñatti.

145.Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. That non-separation from the three robes which has been agreed upon by the Sangha—if it seems fit to the Sangha, the Sangha should rescind that non-separation from the three robes. This is the motion.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yo so saṅghena ticīvarena avippavāso sammato, saṅgho taṃ ticīvarena avippavāsaṃ samūhanati.

147.Monks, when a boundary has not been formally established or delimited, if one dwells near a village or a town, whatever the village boundary of that village, or the town boundary of that town, is the area for shared residence and a common Uposatha. If, monks, one dwells in a wilderness without villages, the area within seven abbhantaras all around is the area for shared residence and a common Uposatha. All rivers, monks, are without boundaries; all oceans are without boundaries; all natural lakes are without boundaries. In the case of a river, ocean, or natural lake, the area within a middling man’s throw of water all around is the area for shared residence and a common Uposatha.

148.At that time, the monks of the group of six were overlapping boundaries. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. Monks, for those whose boundary was established first, their formal act is lawful, unshakeable, and fit to stand. Monks, for those whose boundary was established later, their formal act is unlawful, shakeable, and unfit to stand. Monks, a boundary should not be overlapped. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong-doing.

77.Uposatha-breaking, etc.

149. Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kati nu kho uposathā’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Dveme, bhikkhave, uposathā – cātuddasiko ca pannarasiko ca. Ime kho, bhikkhave, dve uposathāti.

149.Then the monks had this thought: “How many Uposathas are there?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, there are these two Uposathas: the fourteenth and the fifteenth. These, monks, are the two Uposathas.”

Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kati nu kho uposathakammānī’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Cattārimāni, bhikkhave, uposathakammāni – adhammena vaggaṃ uposathakammaṃ, adhammena samaggaṃ uposathakammaṃ, dhammena vaggaṃ uposathakammaṃ, dhammena samaggaṃ uposathakammanti. Tatra, bhikkhave, yadidaṃ adhammena vaggaṃ uposathakammaṃ, na, bhikkhave, evarūpaṃ uposathakammaṃ, kātabbaṃ. Na ca mayā evarūpaṃ uposathakammaṃ anuññātaṃ. Tatra, bhikkhave, yadidaṃ adhammena samaggaṃ uposathakammaṃ, na, bhikkhave, evarūpaṃ uposathakammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Na ca mayā evarūpaṃ uposathakammaṃ anuññātaṃ. Tatra, bhikkhave, yadidaṃ dhammena vaggaṃ uposathakammaṃ, na, bhikkhave, evarūpaṃ uposathakammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Na ca mayā evarūpaṃ uposathakammaṃ anuññātaṃ. Tatra, bhikkhave, yadidaṃ dhammena samaggaṃ uposathakammaṃ, evarūpaṃ, bhikkhave, uposathakammaṃ kātabbaṃ, evarūpañca mayā uposathakammaṃ anuññātaṃ. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, evarūpaṃ uposathakammaṃ karissāma yadidaṃ dhammena samagganti – evañhi vo, bhikkhave, sikkhitabbanti.

Then the monks thought, "How many kinds of Uposatha acts are there?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "There are these four kinds of Uposatha acts, monks: an unlawful Uposatha act with a divided assembly, an unlawful Uposatha act with a united assembly, a lawful Uposatha act with a divided assembly, and a lawful Uposatha act with a united assembly.""Here, monks, regarding the unlawful Uposatha act with a divided assembly—such an Uposatha act should not be performed, monks. Nor have I approved such an Uposatha act.""Here, monks, regarding the unlawful Uposatha act with a united assembly—such an Uposatha act should not be performed, monks. Nor have I approved such an Uposatha act.""Here, monks, regarding the lawful Uposatha act with a divided assembly—such an Uposatha act should not be performed, monks. Nor have I approved such an Uposatha act.""Here, monks, regarding the lawful Uposatha act with a united assembly—such an Uposatha act should be performed, monks. And I have approved such an Uposatha act.""Therefore, monks, you should perform such an Uposatha act that is lawful and with a united assembly. Thus, monks, should you train yourselves."

78.The brief recitation of the Pātimokkha, etc.

150. Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kati nu kho pātimokkhuddesā’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Pañcime, bhikkhave, pātimokkhuddesā – nidānaṃ uddisitvā avasesaṃ sutena sāvetabbaṃ. Ayaṃ paṭhamo pātimokkhuddeso. Nidānaṃ uddisitvā cattāri pārājikāni uddisitvā avasesaṃ sutena sāvetabbaṃ. Ayaṃ dutiyo pātimokkhuddeso. Nidānaṃ uddisitvā cattāri pārājikāni uddisitvā terasa saṅghādisese uddisitvā avasesaṃ sutena sāvetabbaṃ. Ayaṃ tatiyo pātimokkhuddeso. Nidānaṃ uddisitvā cattāri pārājikāni uddisitvā terasa saṅghādisese uddisitvā dve aniyate uddisitvā avasesaṃ sutena sāvetabbaṃ. Ayaṃ catuttho pātimokkhuddeso. Vitthāreneva pañcamo. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca pātimokkhuddesāti.

150.Then the monks had this thought: "How many recitations of the Pāṭimokkha are there?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, there are these five recitations of the Pāṭimokkha: 1. Reciting the introduction, the rest should be announced by hearing. This is the first recitation of the Pāṭimokkha. 2. Reciting the introduction, reciting the four Pārājika rules, the rest should be announced by hearing. This is the second recitation of the Pāṭimokkha. 3. Reciting the introduction, reciting the four Pārājika rules, reciting the thirteen Saṅghādisesa rules, the rest should be announced by hearing. This is the third recitation of the Pāṭimokkha. 4. Reciting the introduction, reciting the four Pārājika rules, reciting the thirteen Saṅghādisesa rules, reciting the two Aniyata rules, the rest should be announced by hearing. This is the fourth recitation of the Pāṭimokkha. 5. The fifth is in full detail. These, monks, are the five recitations of the Pāṭimokkha."

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū – bhagavatā saṃkhittena pātimokkhuddeso anuññātoti – sabbakālaṃ saṃkhittena pātimokkhaṃ uddisanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, saṃkhittena pātimokkhaṃ uddisitabbaṃ. Yo uddiseyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

At that time the monks, thinking "the Blessed One has allowed the recitation of the Pātimokkha in brief," recited the Pātimokkha in brief at all times. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, the Pātimokkha should not be recited in brief. Whoever recites it incurs an offense of wrong-doing."

Tena kho pana samayena kosalesu janapade aññatarasmiṃ āvāse tadahuposathe savarabhayaṃ [saṃcarabhayaṃ (syā.)] ahosi. Bhikkhū nāsakkhiṃsu vitthārena pātimokkhaṃ uddisituṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sati antarāye saṃkhittena pātimokkhaṃ uddisitunti.

At that time, in a certain dwelling place in the Kosala country, there was a danger from robbers on the Uposatha day. The monks were unable to recite the Pāṭimokkha in full. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, that when there is danger, the Pāṭimokkha may be recited in brief."

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū asatipi antarāye saṃkhittena pātimokkhaṃ uddisanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, asati antarāye saṃkhittena pātimokkhaṃ uddisitabbaṃ. Yo uddiseyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sati antarāye saṃkhittena pātimokkhaṃ uddisituṃ. Tatrime antarāyā – rājantarāyo, corantarāyo, agyantarāyo, udakantarāyo, manussantarāyo, amanussantarāyo, vāḷantarāyo, sarīsapantarāyo, jīvitantarāyo, brahmacariyantarāyoti. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, evarūpesu antarāyesu saṃkhittena pātimokkhaṃ uddisituṃ, asati antarāye vitthārenāti.

At that time the group-of-six monks were reciting the Pātimokkha in brief even when there was no danger. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, the Pātimokkha should not be recited in brief when there is no danger. Whoever recites it incurs an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, that when there is danger, the Pāṭimokkha may be recited in brief. These are dangers: danger from a king, danger from thieves, danger from fire, danger from water, danger from humans, danger from non-humans, danger from wild animals, danger from reptiles, danger to life, danger to the spiritual life. I allow, monks, that in such dangers, the Pāṭimokkha may be recited in brief; when there is no danger, it should be recited in full."

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū saṅghamajjhe anajjhiṭṭhā dhammaṃ bhāsanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, saṅghamajjhe anajjhiṭṭhena dhammo bhāsitabbo. Yo bhāseyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, therena bhikkhunā sāmaṃ vā dhammaṃ bhāsituṃ paraṃ vā ajjhesitunti.

At that time, the group of six monks were giving teachings in the midst of the Sangha without being requested. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, one should not give teachings in the midst of the Sangha without being requested. Whoever does so incurs an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, that a senior monk may either give the teaching himself or request another to do so."

79.Discourse on Questioning the Discipline

151. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū saṅghamajjhe asammatā vinayaṃ pucchanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, saṅghamajjhe asammatena vinayo pucchitabbo. Yo puccheyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, saṅghamajjhe sammatena vinayaṃ pucchituṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, sammannitabbo – attanā vā [attanāva (syā.)] attānaṃ sammannitabbaṃ, parena vā paro sammannitabbo. Kathañca attanāva attānaṃ sammannitabbaṃ? Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

151.At that time, the group-of-six monks, unauthorized in the midst of the Saṅgha, questioned the Discipline. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, one who is unauthorized should not question the Discipline in the midst of the Saṅgha. Whoever questions it commits an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, that one who is authorized may question the Discipline in the midst of the Saṅgha. And thus, monks, should authorization be conferred: either one should authorize oneself, or another should authorize another. And how should one authorize oneself? A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, ahaṃ itthannāmaṃ vinayaṃ puccheyya’’nti. Evaṃ attanāva attānaṃ sammannitabbaṃ.

"Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. If it is agreeable to the Saṅgha, I would question the Discipline on such-and-such a matter." Thus should one authorize oneself.

Kathañca parena paro sammannitabbo? Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

And how should another authorize another? A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, itthannāmo itthannāmaṃ vinayaṃ puccheyyā’’ti. Evaṃ parena paro sammannitabboti.

"Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. If it is agreeable to the Saṅgha, let so-and-so question so-and-so on the Discipline." Thus should another authorize another.

At that time, conscientious monks, authorized in the midst of the Saṅgha, questioned the Discipline. The group-of-six monks conceived resentment, conceived displeasure, and threatened them with punishment. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, that even one authorized in the midst of the Saṅgha, after surveying the assembly and weighing the individual, may question the Discipline."

152. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū saṅghamajjhe asammatā vinayaṃ vissajjenti [vissajjanti (ka.)]. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, saṅghamajjhe asammatena vinayo vissajjetabbo. Yo vissajjeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, saṅghamajjhe sammatena vinayaṃ vissajjetuṃ.

81.The Discourse on Censure

153. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū anokāsakataṃ bhikkhuṃ āpattiyā codenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, anokāsakato bhikkhu āpattiyā codetabbo. Yo codeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, okāsaṃ kārāpetvā āpattiyā codetuṃ – karotu āyasmā okāsaṃ, ahaṃ taṃ vattukāmoti.

153.At that time, the group of six monks accused a monk of an offense without asking for his consent. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, a monk should not be accused of an offense without first being asked for consent. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong conduct. I allow, monks, that after obtaining consent, one may accuse another of an offense—'Venerable, grant me consent, I wish to speak to you about this.'"

Tena kho pana samayena pesalā bhikkhū chabbaggiye bhikkhū okāsaṃ kārāpetvā āpattiyā codenti. Chabbaggiyā bhikkhū labhanti āghātaṃ, labhanti appaccayaṃ, vadhena tajjenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, katepi okāse puggalaṃ tulayitvā āpattiyā codetunti.

At that time, conscientious monks, after obtaining consent, accused the group-of-six monks of an offense. The group-of-six monks became resentful, became displeased, and threatened them with violence. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, even after consent has been obtained, to accuse a person of an offense after assessing the individual."

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū – puramhākaṃ pesalā bhikkhū okāsaṃ kārāpentīti – paṭikacceva suddhānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ anāpattikānaṃ avatthusmiṃ akāraṇe okāsaṃ kārāpenti.

Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, puggalaṃ tulayitvā okāsaṃ kātu [kārāpetuṃ (syā.)] nti.

At that time the group-of-six monks, thinking, "The conscientious monks obtain consent beforehand," would preemptively obtain consent from monks who were innocent, without offense, without basis, without reason. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, consent should not be obtained from monks who are innocent, without offense, without basis, without reason. Whoever should obtain it, incurs an offense of wrong conduct. I allow, monks, to grant consent after considering the person."

82.The Denouncing of Unrighteous Actions, etc.

154. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū saṅghamajjhe adhammakammaṃ karonti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, adhammakammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Yo kareyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti. Karontiyeva adhammakammaṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, adhammakamme kayiramāne paṭikkositunti.

154.At that time, the group of six monks performed an unrighteous action in the midst of the Saṅgha. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, an unrighteous action should not be done. Whoever does so, incurs an offense of wrong conduct." Yet they continued to perform the unrighteous action. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, that when an unrighteous action is being performed, it should be protested against."

Tena kho pana samayena pesalā bhikkhū chabbaggiyehi bhikkhūhi adhammakamme kayiramāne paṭikkosanti. Chabbaggiyā bhikkhū labhanti āghātaṃ, labhanti appaccayaṃ, vadhena tajjenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, diṭṭhimpi āvikātunti. Tesaṃyeva santike diṭṭhiṃ āvikaronti. Chabbaggiyā bhikkhū labhanti āghātaṃ, labhanti appaccayaṃ, vadhena tajjenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, catūhi pañcahi paṭikkosituṃ, dvīhi tīhi diṭṭhiṃ āvikātuṃ, ekena adhiṭṭhātuṃ – ‘na metaṃ khamatī’ti.

At that time, conscientious monks protested against the unrighteous actions being performed by the group-of-six monks. The group-of-six monks became resentful and displeased, threatening them with violence. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, to declare even one’s view." They declared their view in the presence of those monks. The group-of-six monks became resentful and displeased, threatening them with violence. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, to protest with four or five, to declare one’s view with two or three, and to object with one—‘This is not acceptable to me.’"

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū saṅghamajjhe pātimokkhaṃ uddisamānā sañcicca na sāventi. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, pātimokkhuddesakena sañcicca na sāvetabbaṃ. Yo na sāveyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

At that time the group-of-six monks, while reciting the Pātimokkha in the midst of the Saṅgha, deliberately did not pronounce it audibly. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, the one reciting the Pātimokkha should not deliberately fail to pronounce it audibly. Whoever does not pronounce it audibly, incurs an offense of wrong conduct.”

Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā udāyī saṅghassa pātimokkhuddesako hoti kākassarako. Atha kho āyasmato udāyissa etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā paññattaṃ ‘pātimokkhuddesakena sāvetabba’nti, ahañcamhi kākassarako, kathaṃ nu kho mayā paṭipajjitabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, pātimokkhuddesakena vāyamituṃ – ‘kathaṃ sāveyya’nti. Vāyamantassa anāpattīti.

At that time, Venerable Udāyī was the reciter of the Pātimokkha for the Saṅgha, and he was hoarse. Then Venerable Udāyī thought: “The Blessed One has prescribed that the reciter of the Pātimokkha should make it heard, but I am hoarse. How should I proceed?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, the reciter of the Pātimokkha to make an effort: ‘How can I make it heard?’ There is no offense for one who makes an effort."

Tena kho pana samayena devadatto sagahaṭṭhāya parisāya pātimokkhaṃ uddisati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, sagahaṭṭhāya parisāya pātimokkhaṃ uddisitabbaṃ. Yo uddiseyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

At that time, Devadatta was reciting the Pātimokkha to an assembly that included laypeople. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, the Pātimokkha should not be recited to an assembly that includes laypeople. Whoever does recite it, incurs an offense of wrong conduct."

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū saṅghamajjhe anajjhiṭṭhā pātimokkhaṃ uddisanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, saṅghamajjhe anajjhiṭṭhena pātimokkhaṃ uddisitabbaṃ. Yo uddiseyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, therādhikaṃ [therādheyyaṃ (aṭṭhakathāyaṃ pāṭhantaraṃ)] pātimokkhanti.

At that time the group-of-six monks recited the Pātimokkha in the midst of the Saṅgha without being appointed. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, the Pātimokkha should not be recited in the midst of the Saṅgha without being appointed. Whoever recites it incurs an offense of wrong conduct. I allow, monks, that the Pātimokkha be recited by a senior monk."

Here ends the first chapter on the recitations of other sects.

155.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he pleased, set out on a journey toward Codanāvatthu. Traveling in stages, he eventually arrived at Codanāvatthu. At that time, in a certain monastery, many monks were residing. There, an elder monk was foolish and inexperienced. He did not know the Uposatha or the Uposatha procedure, the Pātimokkha or the recitation of the Pātimokkha. Then those monks thought: “The Blessed One has prescribed, ‘the Pātimokkha is dependent on the elder,’ but our elder monk is foolish and inexperienced. He does not know the Uposatha or the Uposatha procedure, the Pātimokkha or the recitation of the Pātimokkha. How should we proceed?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, that the Pātimokkha be dependent on any monk there who is skilled and capable.”

Tena kho pana samayena aññatarasmiṃ āvāse tadahuposathe sambahulā bhikkhū viharanti bālā abyattā. Te na jānanti uposathaṃ vā uposathakammaṃ vā, pātimokkhaṃ vā pātimokkhuddesaṃ vā. Te theraṃ ajjhesiṃsu – ‘‘uddisatu, bhante, thero pātimokkha’’nti. So evamāha – ‘‘na me, āvuso, vattatī’’ti. Dutiyaṃ theraṃ ajjhesiṃsu – ‘‘uddisatu, bhante, thero pātimokkha’’nti. Sopi evamāha – ‘‘na me, āvuso, vattatī’’ti. Tatiyaṃ theraṃ ajjhesiṃsu – ‘‘uddisatu, bhante, thero pātimokkha’’nti. Sopi evamāha – ‘‘na me, āvuso, vattatī’’ti. Eteneva upāyena yāva saṅghanavakaṃ ajjhesiṃsu – ‘‘uddisatu āyasmā pātimokkha’’nti. Sopi evamāha – ‘‘na me, bhante, vattatī’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

At that time, in a certain monastery, on the Uposatha day, many monks, foolish and inexperienced, were staying. They did not know the Uposatha or the Uposatha procedure, the Pātimokkha or the recitation of the Pātimokkha. They requested an elder monk, saying, “Venerable sir, may the elder monk recite the Pātimokkha.” He said, “Friends, it is not suitable for me.” They requested a second elder monk, saying, “Venerable sir, may the elder monk recite the Pātimokkha.” He also said, “Friends, it is not suitable for me.” They requested a third elder monk, saying, “Venerable sir, may the elder monk recite the Pātimokkha.” He also said, “Friends, it is not suitable for me.” In this very way, they requested up to the ninth monk in the Sangha, saying, “Venerable, may the venerable one recite the Pātimokkha.” He also said, “Venerable sirs, it is not suitable for me.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, aññatarasmiṃ āvāse tadahuposathe sambahulā bhikkhū viharanti bālā abyattā. Te na jānanti uposathaṃ vā uposathakammaṃ vā, pātimokkhaṃ vā pātimokkhuddesaṃ vā.

Sopi evaṃ vadeti – ‘‘na me, āvuso, vattatī’’ti. Tatiyaṃ theraṃ ajjhesanti – ‘‘uddisatu, bhante, thero pātimokkha’’nti. Sopi evaṃ vadeti – ‘‘na me, āvuso, vattatī’’ti. Eteneva upāyena yāva saṅghanavakaṃ ajjhesanti – ‘‘uddisatu āyasmā pātimokkha’’nti. Sopi evaṃ vadeti – ‘‘na me, bhante, vattatī’’ti. Tehi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi eko bhikkhu sāmantā āvāsā sajjukaṃ pāhetabbo – gacchāvuso, saṃkhittena vā vitthārena vā pātimokkhaṃ pariyāpuṇitvāna āgacchāhīti.

Here, monks, in a certain monastery, on the Uposatha day, many monks are staying, who are foolish and inexperienced. They do not know the Uposatha or the Uposatha procedure, the Pātimokkha or the recitation of the Pātimokkha. They request an elder monk, ‘Venerable sir, may the elder monk recite the Pātimokkha.’ He says, ‘Friends, it is not suitable for me.’ They request a second elder monk, ‘Venerable sir, may the elder monk recite the Pātimokkha.’ He also says, ‘Friends, it is not suitable for me.’ They request a third elder monk, ‘Venerable sir, may the elder monk recite the Pātimokkha.’ He also says, ‘Friends, it is not suitable for me.’ In this way, they request up to the ninth monk in the Saṅgha, ‘Venerable, may the venerable one recite the Pātimokkha.’ He also says, ‘Venerable sirs, it is not suitable for me.’ In that case, monks, those monks should immediately send one monk to a nearby monastery, saying, ‘Go, friend, learn the Pātimokkha, either in brief or in detail, and then return.’

Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kena nu kho pāhetabbo’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, therena bhikkhunā navaṃ bhikkhuṃ āṇāpetunti. Therena āṇattā navā bhikkhū na gacchanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, therena āṇattena agilānena na gantabbaṃ. Yo na gaccheyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

Then the monks had this thought: “Now, by whom should he be sent?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, that an elder monk should instruct a new monk.” Instructed by the elder monk, the new monks did not go. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, one who is not ill should not fail to go when instructed by an elder monk. Whoever should fail to go incurs an offense of wrong-doing.”

156.Then the Blessed One, having stayed as long as he wished concerning the grounds for complaint, returned again to Rājagaha.

Tena kho pana samayena manussā bhikkhū piṇḍāya carante pucchanti – ‘‘katimī, bhante, pakkhassā’’ti? Bhikkhū evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘na kho mayaṃ, āvuso, jānāmā’’ti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘pakkhagaṇanamattamampime samaṇā sakyaputtiyā na jānanti, kiṃ panime aññaṃ kiñci kalyāṇaṃ jānissantī’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sabbeheva pakkhagaṇanaṃ uggahetunti.

At that time, people asked the monks who were going for alms, "Venerable sirs, what day of the fortnight is it?" The monks replied, "Friends, we do not know." The people complained, criticized, and grumbled, "These Sakyan ascetics do not even know the mere counting of the fortnight; what other good qualities will they know?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow you to learn the counting of the fortnight." Then the monks thought, "By whom, now, should the counting of the fortnight be learned?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow that all should learn the counting of the fortnight."

157. Tena kho pana samayena manussā bhikkhū piṇḍāya carante pucchanti – ‘‘kīvatikā, bhante, bhikkhū’’ti? Bhikkhū evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘na kho mayaṃ, āvuso, jānāmā’’ti.

Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhikkhū gaṇetunti.

157.At that time, people asked the monks who were going for alms, "Venerable sirs, how many monks are there?" The monks replied, "Friends, we do not know." The people complained, grumbled, and criticized, "These Sakyan ascetics do not even know one another; what other good qualities will they know?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow that the monks be counted."

Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kadā nu kho bhikkhū gaṇetabbā’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, tadahuposathe nāmaggena [nāmamattena (syā.), gaṇamaggena (ka.)] gaṇetuṃ, salākaṃ vā gāhetunti.

Then the monks had this thought: "When should the monks be counted?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow you to count them on the Uposatha day by name or to take a vote by ticket."

158. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū ajānantā ajjuposathoti dūraṃ gāmaṃ piṇḍāya caranti. Te uddissamānepi pātimokkhe āgacchanti, uddiṭṭhamattepi āgacchanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, ārocetuṃ ‘ajjuposatho’ti.

158.At that time, monks, not knowing that it was the Uposatha day, went to a distant village for alms. They arrived while the Pātimokkha was being recited, or even just after it had been recited. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow you to announce: 'Today is the Uposatha.'"

Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kena nu kho ārocetabbo’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, therena bhikkhunā kālavato ārocetunti.

Then the monks had this thought: "By whom, now, should it be announced?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow that it be announced by a senior monk at the proper time."

Tena kho pana samayena aññataro thero kālavato nassarati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhattakālepi ārocetunti.

At that time, a certain elder forgot the proper time. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow you to announce it even at mealtime."

Bhattakālepi nassarati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, yaṃ kālaṃ sarati, taṃ kālaṃ ārocetunti.

Even at mealtime, he would forget. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow that whenever someone remembers the time, they should announce it."

159. Tena kho pana samayena aññatarasmiṃ āvāse uposathāgāraṃ uklāpaṃ hoti. Āgantukā bhikkhū ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma āvāsikā bhikkhū uposathāgāraṃ na sammajjissantī’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, uposathāgāraṃ sammajjitunti.

159.Now at that time in a certain monastery the Uposatha hall was full of sweepings. The visiting monks complained, criticized, and grumbled, saying, "How can the resident monks not sweep the Uposatha hall?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow the Uposatha hall to be swept."

Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kena nu kho uposathāgāraṃ sammajjitabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, therena bhikkhunā navaṃ bhikkhuṃ āṇāpetunti.

Then the monks had this thought: "By whom, now, should the Uposatha hall be swept?" They informed the Blessed One of this matter. "Monks, I allow that a senior monk should instruct a new monk."

Therena āṇattā navā bhikkhū na sammajjanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, therena āṇattena agilānena na sammajjitabbaṃ. Yo na sammajjeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

When ordered by a senior monk, the new monks did not sweep. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, a healthy monk, when ordered by a senior monk, should sweep. Whoever does not sweep commits an offense of wrong-doing."

160. Tena kho pana samayena uposathāgāre āsanaṃ apaññattaṃ hoti. Bhikkhū chamāyaṃ nisīdanti, gattānipi cīvarānipi paṃsukitāni honti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, uposathāgāre āsanaṃ paññapetunti.

160.At that time, seats had not been arranged in the Uposatha hall. The monks sat on the ground, and their bodies and robes became dusty. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow seats to be arranged in the Uposatha hall."

Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kena nu kho uposathāgāre āsanaṃ paññapetabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, therena bhikkhunā navaṃ bhikkhuṃ āṇāpetunti.

161.At that time, there was no lamp in the Uposatha hall. The monks stumbled over bodies and robes in the darkness. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow a lamp to be made in the Uposatha hall."

Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kena nu kho uposathāgāre padīpo kātabbo’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, therena bhikkhunā navaṃ bhikkhuṃ āṇāpetunti.

"Monks, I allow drinking water and water for use to be provided."

163.Now at that time a number of foolish and incompetent monks, intending to travel to another region, did not take leave of their teachers or preceptors. They reported this matter to the Blessed One.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, sambahulā bhikkhū bālā abyattā disaṃgamikā ācariyupajjhāye na āpucchanti [na āpucchanti (ka.)].

Here, monks, a number of foolish and incompetent monks, intending to travel to another region, do not take leave of their teachers and preceptors. Monks, those monks should be asked by their teachers and preceptors: ‘Where are you going? With whom are you going?’ If, monks, those foolish and incompetent monks point out other foolish and incompetent ones, their teachers and preceptors should not give them permission. If they give permission, there is an offense of wrong conduct. And if those foolish and incompetent monks go without permission from their teachers and preceptors, there is an offense of wrong conduct.

Here, monks, in a certain dwelling, a number of foolish and incompetent monks reside. They do not know the Uposatha or the Uposatha procedure, the Pātimokkha or the recitation of the Pātimokkha. Then another monk arrives—learned, with the tradition come down to him, a Dhamma-holder, a Vinaya-holder, a matrix-holder, wise, competent, intelligent, modest, conscientious, desirous of training. That monk, monks, should be welcomed, supported, treated kindly, and provided for by those monks with powder, clay, tooth sticks, and water for washing the face. If they do not welcome, support, treat kindly, and provide for him with powder, clay, tooth sticks, and water for washing the face, there is an offense of wrong conduct.

They do not know the Uposatha or the Uposatha procedure, the Pātimokkha or the recitation of the Pātimokkha. Monks, those monks should promptly send one monk to a neighboring dwelling with the instruction: ‘Go, friend, learn the Pātimokkha briefly or in detail and return.’ If this can be obtained, it is skillful.

87.The Account of the Granting of Purity

164. Atha kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘sannipatatha, bhikkhave, saṅgho uposathaṃ karissatī’’ti. Evaṃ vutte aññataro bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘atthi, bhante, bhikkhu gilāno, so anāgato’’ti. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, gilānena bhikkhunā pārisuddhiṃ dātuṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, dātabbā – tena gilānena bhikkhunā ekaṃ bhikkhuṃ upasaṅkamitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘pārisuddhiṃ dammi, pārisuddhiṃ me hara, pārisuddhiṃ me ārocehī’’ti. Kāyena viññāpeti, vācāya viññāpeti, kāyena vācāya viññāpeti, dinnā hoti pārisuddhi. Na kāyena viññāpeti, na vācāya viññāpeti, na kāyena vācāya viññāpeti, na dinnā hoti pārisuddhi. Evañcetaṃ labhetha, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce labhetha, so, bhikkhave, gilāno bhikkhu mañcena vā pīṭhena vā saṅghamajjhe ānetvā uposatho kātabbo. Sace, bhikkhave, gilānupaṭṭhākānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ evaṃ hoti – ‘‘sace kho mayaṃ gilānaṃ ṭhānā cāvessāma, ābādho vā abhivaḍḍhissati kālaṃkiriyā vā bhavissatī’’ti, na, bhikkhave, gilāno bhikkhu ṭhānā cāvetabbo. Saṅghena tattha gantvā uposatho kātabbo. Na tveva vaggena saṅghena uposatho kātabbo. Kareyya ce, āpatti dukkaṭassa.

164.Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: ‘Gather, monks, the Sangha will perform the Uposatha.’ When this was said, a certain monk said to the Blessed One: ‘Venerable sir, there is a sick monk; he has not come.’ ‘I allow, monks, a sick monk to give his declaration of purity. And in this way, monks, it should be given: that sick monk should approach one monk, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, sit on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say this: “I give my declaration of purity, convey my declaration of purity, announce my declaration of purity.” If he makes it known by body, by speech, or by body and speech, the declaration of purity is given. If he does not make it known by body, by speech, or by body and speech, the declaration of purity is not given. If this can be obtained, it is skillful. If it cannot be obtained, monks, that sick monk should be brought into the midst of the Sangha on a bed or a chair, and the Uposatha should be performed. If, monks, the monks attending the sick think: “If we move the sick one from his place, his illness will worsen or he will die,” then, monks, the sick monk should not be moved from his place. The Sangha should go there and perform the Uposatha. But the Uposatha should not be performed by a factional Sangha. If one does so, there is an offense of wrong conduct.

88.The Discussion on Giving Consent.

165. Atha kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘sannipatatha, bhikkhave, saṅgho kammaṃ karissatī’’ti. Evaṃ vutte aññataro bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘atthi, bhante, bhikkhu gilāno, so anāgato’’ti. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, gilānena bhikkhunā chandaṃ dātuṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, dātabbo. Tena gilānena bhikkhunā ekaṃ bhikkhuṃ upasaṅkamitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘chandaṃ dammi, chandaṃ me hara, chandaṃ me ārocehī’’ti. Kāyena viññāpeti, vācāya viññāpeti, kāyena vācāya viññāpeti, dinno hoti chando. Na kāyena viññāpeti, na vācāya viññāpeti, na kāyena vācāya viññāpeti, na dinno hoti chando. Evañcetaṃ labhetha, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce labhetha, so, bhikkhave, gilāno bhikkhu mañcena vā pīṭhena vā saṅghamajjhe ānetvā kammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Sace, bhikkhave, gilānupaṭṭhākānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ evaṃ hoti – ‘‘sace kho mayaṃ gilānaṃ ṭhānā cāvessāma, ābādho vā abhivaḍḍhissati kālaṃkiriyā vā bhavissatī’’ti, na, bhikkhave, gilāno bhikkhu ṭhānā cāvetabbo. Saṅghena tattha gantvā kammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Na tveva vaggena saṅghena kammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Kareyya ce, āpatti dukkaṭassa.

165.Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Gather, monks, the Sangha will perform a formal act." When this was said, a certain monk said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, there is a sick monk who has not come." "I allow, monks, a sick monk to give his consent. And this is how, monks, it should be given: That sick monk should approach another monk, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, sit on his heels, raise his joined hands, and say: 'I give my consent, convey my consent, announce my consent.' If he makes it known by body, by speech, or by both body and speech, the consent is given. If he does not make it known by body, by speech, or by both body and speech, the consent is not given. If this can be obtained, it is wholesome. If not, then, monks, that sick monk should be brought into the midst of the Sangha on a bed or a seat, and the formal act should be performed. If, monks, the monks attending the sick think: 'If we move the sick monk from his place, his illness may worsen or he may die,' then, monks, the sick monk should not be moved from his place. The Sangha should go there and perform the formal act. But the formal act should not be performed by a sectional Sangha. If one does so, there is an offense of wrong-doing.

If, monks, the bearer of consent, having received the consent, departs right there, the consent should be given to another. If, monks, the bearer of consent, having received the consent, becomes deranged right there... or dies; or if he is a novice; or if he has renounced the training; or if he has committed a grave offense; or if he is insane; or if he is deranged in mind; or if he is afflicted by pain; or if he is suspended for not seeing an offense; or if he is suspended for not atoning for an offense; or if he is suspended for not abandoning a wrong view; or if he is a eunuch; or if he is in communion with a thief; or if he has defected to another sect; or if he is a beast; or if he is a matricide; or if he is a patricide; or if he is a murderer of an arahant; or if he has violated a bhikkhuni; or if he has caused a schism in the Sangha; or if he has intentionally shed the blood of a Buddha; or if he is a hermaphrodite—the consent should be given to another.

Chandahārako ce, bhikkhave, dinne chande antarāmagge pakkamati, anāhaṭo hoti chando. Chandahārako ce, bhikkhave, dinne chande antarāmagge vibbhamati…pe… ubhatobyañjanako paṭijānāti, anāhaṭo hoti chando.

If, monks, the bearer of consent, having received the consent, departs along the way, the consent is not conveyed. If, monks, the bearer of consent, having received the consent, wanders off along the way... or if he is a hermaphrodite, the consent is not conveyed.

Chandahārako ce, bhikkhave, dinne chande saṅghappatto pakkamati, āhaṭo hoti chando. Chandahārako ce, bhikkhave, dinne chande saṅghappatto vibbhamati…pe… ubhatobyañjanako paṭijānāti, āhaṭo hoti chando.

If, monks, the bearer of consent, having received the consent and reached the Sangha, departs, the consent is conveyed. If, monks, the bearer of consent, having received the consent and reached the Sangha, wanders away... or if he is a hermaphrodite, the consent is conveyed.

Chandahārako ce, bhikkhave, dinne chande saṅghappatto sutto na āroceti, pamatto na āroceti, samāpanno na āroceti, āhaṭo hoti chando. Chandahārakassa anāpatti.

If, monks, the bearer of consent, having received the consent and reached the Sangha, is asleep and does not announce it, is negligent and does not announce it, or is in meditative absorption and does not announce it, the consent is conveyed. There is no offense for the bearer of consent.

Chandahārako ce, bhikkhave, dinne chande saṅghappatto sañcicca na āroceti, āhaṭo hoti chando. Chandahārakassa āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, tadahuposathe pārisuddhiṃ dentena chandampi dātuṃ, santi saṅghassa karaṇīyanti.

If, monks, the bearer of consent, having received the consent and reached the Sangha, intentionally does not announce it, the consent is conveyed. The bearer of consent incurs an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, that on the Uposatha day, while giving the declaration of purity, one may also give consent, because there are affairs of the Sangha.

89.The Account of Seizing by Relatives and Others

166. Tena kho pana samayena aññataraṃ bhikkhuṃ tadahuposathe ñātakā gaṇhiṃsuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

166.At that time, on the Uposatha day, a certain bhikkhu was seized by his relatives. They reported this matter to the Blessed One.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhuṃ tadahuposathe ñātakā gaṇhanti. Te ñātakā bhikkhūhi evamassu vacanīyā – ‘‘iṅgha, tumhe āyasmanto imaṃ bhikkhuṃ muhuttaṃ muñcatha, yāvāyaṃ bhikkhu uposathaṃ karotī’’ti. Evañcetaṃ labhetha, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce labhetha, te ñātakā bhikkhūhi evamassu vacanīyā – ‘‘iṅgha, tumhe āyasmanto muhuttaṃ ekamantaṃ hotha, yāvāyaṃ bhikkhu pārisuddhiṃ detī’’ti. Evañcetaṃ labhetha, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce labhetha, te ñātakā bhikkhūhi evamassu vacanīyā – ‘‘iṅgha, tumhe āyasmanto imaṃ bhikkhuṃ muhuttaṃ nissīmaṃ netha, yāva saṅgho uposathaṃ karotī’’ti. Evañcetaṃ labhetha, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce labhetha, na tveva vaggena saṅghena uposatho kātabbo. Kareyya ce, āpatti dukkaṭassa.

Here, bhikkhus, if on the Uposatha day a bhikkhu is seized by his relatives, those relatives should be addressed by the bhikkhus thus: “Venerables, please release this bhikkhu for a moment, so that this bhikkhu may perform the Uposatha.” If they obtain this, it is good. If they do not obtain this, those relatives should be addressed by the bhikkhus thus: “Venerables, please stand aside for a moment, so that this bhikkhu may give his declaration of purity.” If they obtain this, it is good. If they do not obtain this, those relatives should be addressed by the bhikkhus thus: “Venerables, please take this bhikkhu outside the boundary for a moment, until the Saṅgha performs the Uposatha.” If they obtain this, it is good. If they do not obtain this, the Uposatha should not be performed by a divided Saṅgha. If one does so, there is an offense of wrong-doing.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhuṃ tadahuposathe rājāno gaṇhanti,…pe… corā gaṇhanti – dhuttā gaṇhanti – bhikkhupaccatthikā gaṇhanti, te bhikkhupaccatthikā bhikkhūhi evamassu vacanīyā – ‘‘iṅgha, tumhe āyasmanto imaṃ bhikkhuṃ muhuttaṃ muñcatha, yāvāyaṃ bhikkhu uposathaṃ karotī’’ti. Evañcetaṃ labhetha, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce labhetha, te bhikkhupaccatthikā bhikkhūhi evamassu vacanīyā – ‘‘iṅgha, tumhe āyasmanto muhuttaṃ ekamantaṃ hotha, yāvāyaṃ bhikkhu pārisuddhiṃ detī’’ti. Evañcetaṃ labhetha, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce labhetha, te bhikkhupaccatthikā bhikkhūhi evamassu vacanīyā – ‘‘iṅgha, tumhe āyasmanto imaṃ bhikkhuṃ muhuttaṃ nissīmaṃ netha, yāva saṅgho uposathaṃ karotī’’ti. Evañcetaṃ labhetha, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce labhetha, na tveva vaggena saṅghena uposatho kātabbo. Kareyya ce, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

Here, bhikkhus, on the Uposatha day, a bhikkhu is seized by kings… seized by thieves… seized by gamblers… seized by adversaries of the bhikkhus. Those adversaries of the bhikkhus should be addressed by the bhikkhus thus: “Venerables, please release this bhikkhu for a moment, so that this bhikkhu may perform the Uposatha.” If they obtain this, it is good. If they do not obtain this, those adversaries of the bhikkhus should be addressed by the bhikkhus thus: “Venerables, please stand aside for a moment, so that this bhikkhu may give his declaration of purity.” If they obtain this, it is good. If they do not obtain this, those adversaries of the bhikkhus should be addressed by the bhikkhus thus: “Venerables, please take this bhikkhu outside the boundary for a moment, until the Saṅgha performs the Uposatha.” If they obtain this, it is good. If they do not obtain this, the Uposatha should not be performed by a divided Saṅgha. If one does so, there is an offense of wrong-doing.

90.The Convention Regarding Insanity

167. Atha kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘sannipatatha, bhikkhave, atthi saṅghassa karaṇīya’’nti. Evaṃ vutte aññataro bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘atthi, bhante, gaggo nāma bhikkhu ummattako, so anāgato’’ti.

167.Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Assemble, bhikkhus; there is something for the Saṅgha to do.” When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Venerable Sir, there is a bhikkhu named Gagga who is insane; he has not come.”

‘‘Dveme, bhikkhave, ummattakā – atthi, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ummattako saratipi uposathaṃ napi sarati, saratipi saṅghakammaṃ napi sarati, atthi neva sarati; āgacchatipi uposathaṃ napi āgacchati, āgacchatipi saṅghakammaṃ napi āgacchati, atthi neva āgacchati. Tatra, bhikkhave, yvāyaṃ ummattako saratipi uposathaṃ napi sarati, saratipi saṅghakammaṃ napi sarati, āgacchatipi uposathaṃ napi āgacchati, āgacchatipi saṅghakammaṃ napi āgacchati, anujānāmi, bhikkhave, evarūpassa ummattakassa ummattakasammuttiṃ dātuṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, dātabbā. Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of insane bhikkhus. There is, bhikkhus, an insane bhikkhu who sometimes remembers the Uposatha and sometimes does not remember, sometimes remembers the Saṅgha’s acts and sometimes does not remember, and there is one who never remembers. Sometimes he comes to the Uposatha and sometimes does not come, sometimes he comes to the Saṅgha’s acts and sometimes does not come, and there is one who never comes. Here, bhikkhus, regarding that insane bhikkhu who sometimes remembers the Uposatha and sometimes does not remember, sometimes remembers the Saṅgha’s acts and sometimes does not remember, sometimes comes to the Uposatha and sometimes does not come, sometimes comes to the Saṅgha’s acts and sometimes does not come—I allow, bhikkhus, that a designation of insanity be given to such an insane bhikkhu. And thus, bhikkhus, should it be given: A competent and able bhikkhu should inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Gaggo bhikkhu ummattako – saratipi uposathaṃ napi sarati, saratipi saṅghakammaṃ napi sarati, āgacchatipi uposathaṃ napi āgacchati, āgacchatipi saṅghakammaṃ napi āgacchati. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho gaggassa bhikkhuno ummattakassa ummattakasammutiṃ dadeyya. Sareyya vā gaggo bhikkhu uposathaṃ na vā sareyya, sareyya vā saṅghakammaṃ na vā sareyya, āgaccheyya vā uposathaṃ na vā āgaccheyya, āgaccheyya vā saṅghakammaṃ na vā āgaccheyya, saṅgho saha vā gaggena vinā vā gaggena uposathaṃ kareyya, saṅghakammaṃ kareyya. Esā ñatti.

“Venerable Sir, may the Saṅgha listen to me. The bhikkhu Gagga is insane—sometimes he remembers the Uposatha and sometimes he does not remember, sometimes he remembers the Saṅgha’s acts and sometimes he does not remember, sometimes he comes to the Uposatha and sometimes he does not come, sometimes he comes to the Saṅgha’s acts and sometimes he does not come. If the Saṅgha is ready, let the Saṅgha grant the bhikkhu Gagga, who is insane, the designation of insanity. Whether the bhikkhu Gagga remembers the Uposatha or does not remember, whether he remembers the Saṅgha’s acts or does not remember, whether he comes to the Uposatha or does not come, whether he comes to the Saṅgha’s acts or does not come, the Saṅgha may perform the Uposatha or the Saṅgha’s act with Gagga or without Gagga. This is the motion.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Gaggo bhikkhu ummattako – saratipi uposathaṃ napi sarati, saratipi saṅghakammaṃ napi sarati, āgacchatipi uposathaṃ napi āgacchati, āgacchatipi saṅghakammaṃ napi āgacchati. Saṅgho gaggassa bhikkhuno ummattakassa ummattakasammutiṃ deti. Sareyya vā gaggo bhikkhu uposathaṃ na vā sareyya, sareyya vā saṅghakammaṃ na vā sareyyaṃ, āgaccheyya vā uposathaṃ na vā āgaccheyya, āgaccheyya vā saṅghakammaṃ na vā āgaccheyya, saṅgho saha vā gaggena, vinā vā gaggena uposathaṃ karissati, saṅghakammaṃ karissati. Yassāyasmato khamati gaggassa bhikkhuno ummattakassa ummattakasammutiyā dānaṃ – sareyya vā gaggo bhikkhu uposathaṃ na vā sareyya, sareyya vā saṅghakammaṃ na vā sareyya, āgaccheyya vā uposathaṃ na vā āgaccheyya, āgaccheyya vā saṅghakammaṃ na vā āgaccheyya, saṅgho saha vā gaggena, vinā vā gaggena uposathaṃ karissati, saṅghakammaṃ karissati, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“Venerable Sir, may the Saṅgha listen to me. The bhikkhu Gagga is insane—sometimes he remembers the Uposatha and sometimes he does not remember; sometimes he remembers the Saṅgha’s act and sometimes he does not remember; sometimes he comes to the Uposatha and sometimes he does not come; sometimes he comes to the Saṅgha’s act and sometimes he does not come. The Saṅgha is granting the designation of insanity to the insane bhikkhu Gagga. Whether the bhikkhu Gagga remembers the Uposatha or does not remember, whether he remembers the Saṅgha’s act or does not remember, whether he comes to the Uposatha or does not come, whether he comes to the Saṅgha’s act or does not come, the Saṅgha will perform the Uposatha and the Saṅgha’s act with or without Gagga. If it is agreeable to the Venerables to grant the designation of insanity to the insane bhikkhu Gagga—whether he remembers the Uposatha or does not remember, whether he remembers the Saṅgha’s act or does not remember, whether he comes to the Uposatha or does not come, whether he comes to the Saṅgha’s act or does not come, the Saṅgha will perform the Uposatha and the Saṅgha’s act with or without Gagga—let him be silent. If it is not agreeable, he should speak.”

‘‘Dinnā saṅghena gaggassa bhikkhuno ummattakassa ummattakasammuti. Sareyya vā gaggo bhikkhu uposathaṃ na vā sareyya, sareyya vā saṅghakammaṃ na vā sareyya, āgaccheyya vā uposathaṃ na vā āgaccheyya, āgaccheyya vā saṅghakammaṃ na vā āgaccheyya, saṅgho saha vā gaggena vinā vā gaggena uposathaṃ karissati, saṅghakammaṃ karissati. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

“The Saṅgha has granted the designation of insanity to the insane bhikkhu Gagga. Whether the bhikkhu Gagga remembers the Uposatha or does not remember, whether he remembers the Saṅgha’s act or does not remember, whether he comes to the Uposatha or does not come, whether he comes to the Saṅgha’s act or does not come, the Saṅgha will perform the Uposatha and the Saṅgha’s act with Gagga or without Gagga. The Saṅgha approves, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.”

91.Sangha Uposatha and its various kinds.

168. Tena kho pana samayena aññatarasmiṃ āvāse tadahuposathe cattāro bhikkhū viharanti. Atha kho tesaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā paññattaṃ ‘uposatho kātabbo’ti, mayañcamhā cattāro janā, kathaṃ nu kho amhehi uposatho kātabbo’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, catunnaṃ pātimokkhaṃ uddisitunti.

168.Now on that occasion, in a certain dwelling, four bhikkhus were dwelling on the Uposatha day. Then it occurred to those bhikkhus: “The Blessed One has laid down that the Uposatha should be observed. But there are four of us. How then should the Uposatha be observed by us?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow the recitation of the Pātimokkha for four.”

Now on that occasion, in a certain dwelling, three bhikkhus were dwelling on the Uposatha day. Then it occurred to those bhikkhus: “The Blessed One has allowed the recitation of the Pātimokkha for four. But there are only three of us. How then should the Uposatha be observed by us?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow the observance of the purification Uposatha for three. And, monks, it should be done in this way: A competent and capable bhikkhu should inform those bhikkhus:

‘‘Suṇantu me āyasmantā. Ajjuposatho pannaraso. Yadāyasmantānaṃ pattakallaṃ, mayaṃ aññamaññaṃ pārisuddhiuposathaṃ kareyyāmā’’ti.

“Venerables, let me be heard. Today is the fifteenth Uposatha. If it is suitable for the venerables, we may observe the purification Uposatha with one another.”

The senior bhikkhu, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, should sit squatting, raise his hands in añjali, and say to those bhikkhus: “Friends, I am pure; regard me as pure. Friends, I am pure; regard me as pure. Friends, I am pure; regard me as pure.”

Navakena bhikkhunā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā te bhikkhū evamassu vacanīyā – ‘‘parisuddho ahaṃ, bhante; parisuddhoti maṃ dhāretha. Parisuddho ahaṃ, bhante; parisuddhoti maṃ dhāretha. Parisuddho ahaṃ, bhante; parisuddhoti maṃ dhārethā’’ti.

The junior bhikkhu, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, should sit squatting, raise his hands in añjali, and say to those bhikkhus: “Venerable sirs, I am pure; regard me as pure. Venerable sirs, I am pure; regard me as pure. Venerable sirs, I am pure; regard me as pure.”

Tena kho pana samayena aññatarasmiṃ āvāse tadahuposathe dve bhikkhū viharanti. Atha kho tesaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā anuññātaṃ catunnaṃ pātimokkhaṃ uddisituṃ, tiṇṇannaṃ pārisuddhiuposathaṃ kātuṃ. Mayañcamhā dve janā. Kathaṃ nu kho amhehi uposatho kātabbo’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, dvinnaṃ pārisuddhiuposathaṃ kātuṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, kātabbo. Therena bhikkhunā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā navo bhikkhu evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘parisuddho ahaṃ, āvuso; parisuddhoti maṃ dhārehi. Parisuddho ahaṃ, āvuso; parisuddhoti maṃ dhārehi. Parisuddho ahaṃ, āvuso; parisuddhoti maṃ dhārehī’’ti.

Now on that occasion, in a certain dwelling, two bhikkhus were dwelling on the Uposatha day. Then it occurred to those bhikkhus: “The Blessed One has allowed the recitation of the Pātimokkha for four, and the observance of the purification Uposatha for three. But there are two of us. How then should the Uposatha be observed by us?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow the observance of the purification Uposatha for two. And, monks, it should be done in this way: The senior bhikkhu, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, should sit squatting, raise his hands in añjali, and say to the junior bhikkhu: “Friend, I am pure; regard me as pure. Friend, I am pure; regard me as pure. Friend, I am pure; regard me as pure.”

Navakena bhikkhunā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā thero bhikkhu evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘parisuddho ahaṃ, bhante; parisuddhoti maṃ dhāretha. Parisuddho ahaṃ, bhante; parisuddhoti maṃ dhāretha. Parisuddho ahaṃ, bhante; parisuddhoti maṃ dhārethā’’ti.

The junior bhikkhu, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, should sit squatting, raise his hands in añjali, and say to the senior bhikkhu: “Venerable sir, I am pure; regard me as pure. Venerable sir, I am pure; regard me as pure. Venerable sir, I am pure; regard me as pure.”

Tena kho pana samayena aññatarasmiṃ āvāse tadahuposathe eko bhikkhu viharati. Atha kho tassa bhikkhuno etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā anuññātaṃ catunnaṃ pātimokkhaṃ uddisituṃ, tiṇṇannaṃ pārisuddhiuposathaṃ kātuṃ, dvinnaṃ pārisuddhiuposathaṃ kātuṃ. Ahañcamhi ekako. Kathaṃ nu kho mayā uposatho kātabbo’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Idha pana, bhikkhave, aññatarasmiṃ āvāse tadahuposathe eko bhikkhu viharati. Tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā yattha bhikkhū paṭikkamanti upaṭṭhānasālāya vā, maṇḍape vā, rukkhamūle vā, so deso sammajjitvā pānīyaṃ paribhojanīyaṃ upaṭṭhāpetvā āsanaṃ paññapetvā padīpaṃ katvā nisīditabbaṃ. Sace aññe bhikkhū āgacchanti, tehi saddhiṃ uposatho kātabbo. No ce āgacchanti, ajja me uposathoti adhiṭṭhātabbo. No ce adhiṭṭhaheyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa.

Now on that occasion, in a certain dwelling, a single bhikkhu was dwelling on the Uposatha day. Then it occurred to that bhikkhu: “The Blessed One has allowed the recitation of the Pātimokkha for four, the observance of the purification Uposatha for three, and the observance of the purification Uposatha for two. But I am alone. How then should the Uposatha be observed by me?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, here in a certain dwelling, a single bhikkhu is dwelling on the Uposatha day. That bhikkhu, monks, should sweep the place where bhikkhus usually gather—whether the assembly hall, a pavilion, or the foot of a tree—set out drinking water and water for washing, prepare a seat, light a lamp, and then sit down. If other bhikkhus arrive, the Uposatha should be observed with them. If none come, he should make a determination: ‘Today is my Uposatha.’ If he does not make this determination, he commits an offense of wrong-doing.”

Tatra, bhikkhave, yattha cattāro bhikkhū viharanti, na ekassa pārisuddhiṃ āharitvā tīhi pātimokkhaṃ uddisitabbaṃ. Uddiseyyuṃ ce, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Tatra, bhikkhave, yattha tayo bhikkhū viharanti, na ekassa pārisuddhiṃ āharitvā dvīhi pārisuddhiuposatho kātabbo. Kareyyuṃ ce, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Tatra, bhikkhave, yattha dve bhikkhū viharanti, na ekassa pārisuddhiṃ āharitvā ekena adhiṭṭhātabbo. Adhiṭṭhaheyya ce, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

“Monks, where four bhikkhus are dwelling, the Pātimokkha should not be recited by three after one has brought his purification. If they should recite it, there is an offense of wrong-doing. Monks, where three bhikkhus are dwelling, the purification Uposatha should not be observed by two after one has brought his purification. If they should observe it, there is an offense of wrong-doing. Monks, where two bhikkhus are dwelling, a determination should not be made by one after the other has brought his purification. If he should make a determination, there is an offense of wrong-doing.”

92.The Procedure for Dealing with Offences

169. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu tadahuposathe āpattiṃ āpanno hoti. Atha kho tassa bhikkhuno etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā paññattaṃ ‘na sāpattikena uposatho kātabbo’ti. Ahañcamhi āpattiṃ āpanno. Kathaṃ nu kho mayā paṭipajjitabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu tadahuposathe āpattiṃ āpanno hoti. Tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā ekaṃ bhikkhuṃ upasaṅkamitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘ahaṃ, āvuso, itthannāmaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno, taṃ paṭidesemī’’ti. Tena vattabbo – ‘‘passasī’’ti. ‘‘Āma passāmī’’ti. ‘‘Āyatiṃ saṃvareyyāsī’’ti.

169.Now on that occasion a certain monk had committed an offense on the Uposatha day. Then that monk thought: "The Blessed One has laid down that 'One who has an offense should not keep the Uposatha.' I have committed an offense. What should I do now?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Here, monks, if a monk has committed an offense on the Uposatha day, then that monk should approach another monk, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, squat down, raise his joined hands, and say this: 'Friend, I have committed such-and-such an offense; I confess it.' The other monk should say, 'Do you see it?' 'Yes, I see it.' 'Restrain yourself in the future.'"

Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu tadahuposathe āpattiyā vematiko hoti. Tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā ekaṃ bhikkhuṃ upasaṅkamitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘ahaṃ, āvuso, itthannāmāya āpattiyā vematiko; yadā nibbematiko bhavissāmi, tadā taṃ āpattiṃ paṭikarissāmī’’ti vatvā uposatho kātabbo, pātimokkhaṃ sotabbaṃ, na tveva tappaccayā uposathassa antarāyo kātabboti.

Here, monks, if a monk is uncertain about an offense on the Uposatha day, then that monk should approach another monk, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, squat down, raise his joined hands, and say this: 'Friend, I am uncertain about such-and-such an offense. When I am free from uncertainty, I will make amends for that offense.' Having said this, the Uposatha should be performed, and the Pātimokkha should be heard. But on that account, the Uposatha should not be obstructed.

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū sabhāgaṃ āpattiṃ desenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, sabhāgā āpatti desetabbā. Yo deseyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

Now on that occasion the group of six monks confessed a shared offense. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, a shared offense is not to be confessed. Whoever confesses it incurs an offense of wrong conduct."

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū sabhāgaṃ āpattiṃ paṭiggaṇhanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, sabhāgā āpatti paṭiggahetabbā. Yo paṭiggaṇheyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

Now on that occasion the group of six monks were receiving a shared offense. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, a shared offense is not to be received. Whoever receives it incurs an offense of wrong conduct."

93.The Procedure for Disclosing an Offense

170. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu pātimokkhe uddissamāne āpattiṃ sarati. Atha kho tassa bhikkhuno etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā paññattaṃ ‘na sāpattikena uposatho kātabbo’ti. Ahañcamhi āpattiṃ āpanno. Kathaṃ nu kho mayā paṭipajjitabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

170.Now on that occasion a certain monk remembered an offense while the Pātimokkha was being recited. Then that monk thought: "The Blessed One has laid down that 'One who has an offense should not keep the Uposatha.' I have committed an offense. What should I do now?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu pātimokkhe uddissamāne āpattiṃ sarati. Tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā sāmanto bhikkhu evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘ahaṃ, āvuso, itthannāmaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno. Ito vuṭṭhahitvā taṃ āpattiṃ paṭikarissāmī’’ti vatvā uposatho kātabbo, pātimokkhaṃ sotabbaṃ, na tveva tappaccayā uposathassa antarāyo kātabbo.

Here, monks, if a monk remembers an offense while the Pātimokkha is being recited, then that monk should say to a neighboring monk: 'Friend, I have committed such-and-such an offense. After getting up from here, I will make amends for that offense.' Having said this, the Uposatha should be performed, and the Pātimokkha should be heard. But on that account, the Uposatha should not be obstructed.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu pātimokkhe uddissamāne āpattiyā vematiko hoti. Tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā sāmanto bhikkhu evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘ahaṃ, āvuso, itthannāmāya āpattiyā vematiko.

Here, monks, if a monk is uncertain about an offense while the Pātimokkha is being recited, then that monk should say to a neighboring monk: 'Friend, I am uncertain about such-and-such an offense. When I am free from uncertainty, I will make amends for that offense.' Having said this, the Uposatha should be performed, and the Pātimokkha should be heard. But on that account, the Uposatha should not be obstructed.

94.The Procedure for Redressing a Shared Offense

171. Tena kho pana samayena aññatarasmiṃ āvāse tadahuposathe sabbo saṅgho sabhāgaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno hoti. Atha kho tesaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā paññattaṃ ‘na sabhāgā āpatti desetabbā, na sabhāgā āpatti paṭiggahetabbā’ti. Ayañca sabbo saṅgho sabhāgaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno. Kathaṃ nu kho amhehi paṭipajjitabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

171.Now on that occasion, in a certain monastery, on the Uposatha day, the entire Saṅgha had committed a shared offense. Then those monks thought: "The Blessed One has laid down that 'a shared offense should not be confessed, nor should a shared offense be received.' And this entire Saṅgha has committed a shared offense. How should we proceed?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, aññatarasmiṃ āvāse tadahuposathe sabbo saṅgho sabhāgaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno hoti. Tehi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi eko bhikkhu sāmantā āvāsā sajjukaṃ pāhetabbo – gacchāvuso, taṃ āpattiṃ paṭikaritvā āgaccha; mayaṃ te santike āpattiṃ paṭikarissāmāti. Evañcetaṃ labhetha, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce labhetha, byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

Here, monks, if in a certain monastery on the Uposatha day the entire Saṅgha has committed a shared offense, then those monks should promptly send one monk to a neighboring monastery: 'Go, friend, make amends for that offense and come back; we will make amends for the offense in your presence.' If this can be obtained, that is good. If not, a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ sabbo saṅgho sabhāgaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno. Yadā aññaṃ bhikkhuṃ suddhaṃ anāpattikaṃ passissati, tadā tassa santike taṃ āpattiṃ paṭikarissatī’’ti vatvā uposatho kātabbo, pātimokkhaṃ uddisitabbaṃ, na tveva tappaccayā uposathassa antarāyo kātabbo.

'Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha listen to me. This entire Saṅgha has committed a shared offense. When it sees another monk who is pure and free from offense, it will make amends for that offense in his presence.' Having said this, the Uposatha should be performed, and the Pātimokkha should be recited. But on that account, the Uposatha should not be obstructed.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, aññatarasmiṃ āvāse tadahuposathe sabbo saṅgho sabhāgāya āpattiyā vematiko hoti. Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

Here, monks, if in a certain monastery, on the Uposatha day, the entire Saṅgha is uncertain about a shared offense, a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ sabbo saṅgho sabhāgāya āpattiyā vematiko. Yadā nibbematiko bhavissati, tadā taṃ āpattiṃ paṭikarissatī’’ti vatvā uposatho kātabbo, pātimokkhaṃ uddisitabbaṃ; na tveva tappaccayā uposathassa antarāyo kātabbo.

'Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha listen to me. This entire Saṅgha is uncertain about a shared offense. When it is free from uncertainty, it will make amends for that offense.' Having said this, the Uposatha should be performed, and the Pātimokkha should be recited. But on that account, the Uposatha should not be obstructed.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, aññatarasmiṃ āvāse vassūpagato saṅgho sabhāgaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno hoti. Tehi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi eko bhikkhu sāmantā āvāsā sajjukaṃ pāhetabbo – gacchāvuso, taṃ āpattiṃ paṭikaritvā āgaccha; mayaṃ te santike taṃ āpattiṃ paṭikarissāmāti. Evañcetaṃ labhetha, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce labhetha, eko bhikkhu sattāhakālikaṃ pāhetabbo – gacchāvuso, taṃ āpattiṃ paṭikaritvā āgaccha; mayaṃ te santike taṃ āpattiṃ paṭikarissāmāti.

Here, monks, if in a certain monastery a Saṅgha that has entered the rains residence has committed a shared offense, then those monks should promptly send one monk to a neighboring monastery: 'Go, friend, make amends for that offense and come back; we will make amends for that offense in your presence.' If this can be obtained, that is good. If not, one monk should be sent with a seven-day allowance: 'Go, friend, make amends for that offense and come back; we will make amends for that offense in your presence.'

Tena kho pana samayena aññatarasmiṃ āvāse sabbo saṅgho sabhāgaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno hoti. So na jānāti tassā āpattiyā nāmagottaṃ. Tattha añño bhikkhu āgacchati bahussuto āgatāgamo dhammadharo vinayadharo mātikādharo paṇḍito byatto medhāvī lajjī kukkuccako sikkhākāmo. Tamenaṃ aññataro bhikkhu yena so bhikkhu tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā taṃ bhikkhuṃ etadavoca – ‘‘yo nu kho, āvuso, evañcevañca karoti, kiṃ nāma so āpattiṃ āpajjatī’’ti? So evamāha – ‘‘yo kho, āvuso, evañcevañca karoti, imaṃ nāma so āpattiṃ āpajjati. Imaṃ nāma tvaṃ, āvuso, āpattiṃ āpanno; paṭikarohi taṃ āpatti’’nti. So evamāha – ‘‘na kho ahaṃ, āvuso, ekova imaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno; ayaṃ sabbo saṅgho imaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno’’ti. So evamāha – ‘‘kiṃ te, āvuso, karissati paro āpanno vā anāpanno vā. Iṅgha, tvaṃ, āvuso, sakāya āpattiyā vuṭṭhāhī’’ti. Atha kho so bhikkhu tassa bhikkhuno vacanena taṃ āpattiṃ paṭikaritvā yena te bhikkhū tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā te bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘yo kira, āvuso, evañcevañca karoti, imaṃ nāma so āpattiṃ āpajjati. Imaṃ nāma tumhe, āvuso, āpattiṃ āpannā; paṭikarotha taṃ āpatti’’nti. Atha kho te bhikkhū na icchiṃsu tassa bhikkhuno vacanena taṃ āpattiṃ paṭikātuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

Now on that occasion, in a certain monastery, the entire Saṅgha had committed a shared offense. They did not know the name and nature of that offense. Then another monk arrived—learned, versed in the tradition, a bearer of the Dhamma, a bearer of the Vinaya, a bearer of the summaries, wise, skilled, intelligent, conscientious, scrupulous, and desirous of training. A certain monk approached that monk and said: 'Friend, when someone does such and such, what offense does he commit?' He replied: 'Friend, when someone does such and such, he commits such and such an offense. You, friend, have committed such and such an offense. Make amends for that offense.' The other monk said: 'Friend, I am not the only one who has committed this offense; the entire Saṅgha has committed this offense.' The first monk said: 'What is it to you, friend, whether others have committed it or not? Come, friend, absolve yourself of your own offense.' Then that monk, following that monk’s advice, made amends for the offense and approached those monks, saying: 'Friends, when someone does such and such, he commits such and such an offense. You, friends, have committed such and such an offense. Make amends for that offense.' But those monks were unwilling to make amends for the offense on the advice of that monk. They reported this matter to the Blessed One.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, aññatarasmiṃ āvāse sabbo saṅgho sabhāgaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno hoti. So na jānāti tassā āpattiyā nāmagottaṃ. Tattha añño bhikkhu āgacchati bahussuto āgatāgamo dhammadharo vinayadharo mātikādharo paṇḍito byatto medhāvī lajjī kukkuccako sikkhākāmo. Tamenaṃ aññataro bhikkhu yena so bhikkhu tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā taṃ bhikkhuṃ evaṃ vadeti – ‘‘yo nu kho, āvuso, evañcevañca karoti, kiṃ nāma so āpattiṃ āpajjatī’’ti? So evaṃ vadeti – ‘‘yo kho, āvuso, evañcevañca karoti, imaṃ nāma so āpattiṃ āpajjati. Imaṃ nāma tvaṃ, āvuso, āpattiṃ āpanno; paṭikarohi taṃ āpatti’’nti. So evaṃ vadeti – ‘‘na kho ahaṃ, āvuso, ekova imaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno. Ayaṃ sabbo saṅgho imaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno’’ti. So evaṃ vadeti – ‘‘kiṃ te, āvuso, karissati paro āpanno vā anāpanno vā. Iṅgha, tvaṃ, āvuso, sakāya āpattiyā vuṭṭhāhī’’ti. So ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhu tassa bhikkhuno vacanena taṃ āpattiṃ paṭikaritvā yena te bhikkhū tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā te bhikkhū evaṃ vadeti – ‘‘yo kira, āvuso, evañcevañca karoti imaṃ nāma so āpattiṃ āpajjati, imaṃ nāma tumhe āvuso āpattiṃ āpannā, paṭikarotha taṃ āpatti’’nti. Te ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhū tassa bhikkhuno vacanena taṃ āpattiṃ paṭikareyyuṃ, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce paṭikareyyuṃ, na te, bhikkhave, bhikkhū tena bhikkhunā akāmā vacanīyāti.

Here, bhikkhus, in a certain monastery the entire Saṅgha has incurred a common offense. He does not know the name or class of that offense. Then another bhikkhu arrives—learned, versed in tradition, expert in the Dhamma, expert in the Vinaya, expert in the mātikā, wise, competent, intelligent, conscientious, scrupulous, and desirous of training. Then a certain bhikkhu approaches that bhikkhu and says to him: “Friend, if someone does such and such, what offense does he incur?” He replies: “Friend, if someone does such and such, he incurs such and such an offense. You, friend, have incurred such and such an offense; make amends for that offense.” He says: “Friend, I have not incurred this offense alone; the entire Saṅgha has incurred this offense.” He says: “Friend, what does it matter to you whether others have incurred it or not? Come, friend, you should emerge from your own offense.” If, bhikkhus, that bhikkhu, following the advice of that bhikkhu, makes amends for that offense, and then approaches those bhikkhus and says to them: “Friends, it seems that if someone does such and such, he incurs such and such an offense. You, friends, have incurred such and such an offense; make amends for that offense.” If, bhikkhus, those bhikkhus, following the advice of that bhikkhu, make amends for that offense, that is good. If they do not make amends, bhikkhus, those bhikkhus should not be compelled by that bhikkhu against their will.

172.Now at that time, in a certain monastery, on the Uposatha day, a number of resident bhikkhus assembled—four or more. They did not know: ‘Are there other resident bhikkhus who have not arrived?’ Perceiving the Dhamma, perceiving the Vinaya, though divided, perceiving themselves as united, they performed the Uposatha and recited the Pātimokkha. While the Pātimokkha was being recited by them, other resident bhikkhus arrived—a greater number. They informed the Blessed One of this matter.

Here, bhikkhus, in a certain monastery, on the Uposatha day, a number of resident bhikkhus assemble—four or more. They do not know: ‘Are there other resident bhikkhus who have not arrived?’ Perceiving the Dhamma, perceiving the Vinaya, though divided, perceiving themselves as united, they perform the Uposatha and recite the Pātimokkha. While the Pātimokkha is being recited by them, other resident bhikkhus arrive, more numerous. In that case, bhikkhus, the Pātimokkha should be recited again by those bhikkhus.

While the Pātimokkha is being recited by them, other resident bhikkhus arrive, an equal number. What has been recited is well recited; the remainder should be listened to. There is no offense for the reciters.

Titthiyā bimbisāro ca, sannipatituṃ tuṇhikā;Dhammaṃ raho pātimokkhaṃ, devasikaṃ tadā sakiṃ.

Heretics, Bimbisāra, assembling silently; the Dhamma, the Pātimokkha in secret; then daily, once.

Yathāparisā samaggaṃ, sāmaggī maddakucchi ca;Sīmā mahatī nadiyā, anu dve khuddakāni ca.

The assembly united, harmony, and Maddakucchi; a great boundary by the river, and two small ones following.

Navā rājagahe ceva, sīmā avippavāsanā;Sammanne [sammane (ka.)] paṭhamaṃ sīmaṃ, pacchā sīmaṃ samūhane.

And new Rājagaha, a boundary without dwelling apart; first, one agrees upon a boundary, afterwards, one removes a boundary.

Asammatā gāmasīmā, nadiyā samudde sare;Udakukkhepo bhindanti, tathevajjhottharanti ca.

An unagreed village boundary, by a river, in the sea, in a lake; they break the water-boundary, and likewise they are covered over.

Kati kammāni uddeso, savarā asatīpi ca;Dhammaṃ vinayaṃ tajjenti, puna vinayatajjanā.

How many acts, recitation, both with and without restraint; they rebuke the Dhamma and the Discipline, again rebuking the Discipline.

Codanā kate okāse, adhammappaṭikkosanā;Catupañcaparā āvi, sañcicca cepi vāyame.

When accusation is made with opportunity, repudiation of what is not Dhamma; four or five others openly, even if one strives intentionally.

Sagahaṭṭhā anajjhiṭṭhā, codanamhi na jānati;Sambahulā na jānanti, sajjukaṃ na ca gacchare.

With householders uninvited, he does not know in the accusation; many do not know, nor do they go straight.

Katimī kīvatikā dūre, ārocetuñca nassari;Uklāpaṃ āsanaṃ dīpo, disā añño bahussuto.

How many, how far away; and to report, not forgetting; Uklāpa, a seat, a lamp; another learned one from another direction.

Sajjukaṃ [sajjuvassaruposatho (ka.)] vassuposatho, suddhikammañca ñātakā;Gaggo catutayo dveko, āpattisabhāgā sari.

Straightforward, the rains-observance, and purification acts, relatives; Gagga, four, three, two, one; remembering shared offenses.

Sabbo saṅgho vematiko, na jānanti bahussuto;Bahū samasamā thokā, parisā avuṭṭhitāya ca.

The entire Saṅgha is doubtful, the learned do not know; many, equal, few; and the assembly, by not having risen.

Ekaccā vuṭṭhitā sabbā, jānanti ca vematikā;Kappatevāti kukkuccā, jānaṃ passaṃ suṇanti ca.

Some have risen up entirely, and the doubtful ones know; they fret, 'Is it allowable?', knowing, seeing, and hearing.

Āvāsikena āgantu, cātupannaraso puna;Pāṭipado pannaraso, liṅgasaṃvāsakā ubho.

By the resident, by the visitor, again the fourteenth and fifteenth; the first day, the fifteenth day; both the sign and shared dwelling.

Pārivāsānuposatho, aññatra saṅghasāmaggiyā;Ete vibhattā uddānā, vatthuvibhūtakāraṇāti.

Probation, the observance day, except by the Saṅgha's harmony; these are the divided summaries, due to the distinct subject matters.
