120.Living Uncomfortably.

209. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena sambahulā sandiṭṭhā sambhattā bhikkhū kosalesu janapade aññatarasmiṃ āvāse vassaṃ upagacchiṃsu.

Atha kho tesaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘sace kho mayaṃ aññamaññaṃ neva ālapeyyāma na sallapeyyāma – yo paṭhamaṃ gāmato piṇḍāya paṭikkameyya so āsanaṃ paññapeyya, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipeyya, avakkārapātiṃ dhovitvā upaṭṭhāpeyya, pānīyaṃ paribhojanīyaṃ upaṭṭhāpeyya; yo pacchā gāmato piṇḍāya paṭikkameyya, sacassa bhuttāvaseso, sace ākaṅkheyya bhuñjeyya, no ce ākaṅkheyya appaharite vā chaḍḍeyya, appāṇake vā udake opilāpeyya; so āsanaṃ uddhareyya, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ paṭisāmeyya, avakkārapātiṃ dhovitvā paṭisāmeyya, pānīyaṃ paribhojanīyaṃ paṭisāmeyya, bhattaggaṃ sammajjeyya; yo passeyya pānīyaghaṭaṃ vā paribhojanīyaghaṭaṃ vā vaccaghaṭaṃ vā rittaṃ tucchaṃ so upaṭṭhāpeyya; sacassa hoti avisayhaṃ, hatthavikārena dutiyaṃ āmantetvā hatthavilaṅghakena upaṭṭhāpeyya; na tveva tappaccayā vācaṃ bhindeyya – evaṃ kho mayaṃ samaggā sammodamānā avivadamānā phāsukaṃ vassaṃ vaseyyāma, na ca piṇḍakena kilameyyāmā’’ti. Atha kho te bhikkhū aññamaññaṃ neva ālapiṃsu, na sallapiṃsu. Yo paṭhamaṃ gāmato piṇḍāya paṭikkamati, so āsanaṃ paññapeti, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipati, avakkārapātiṃ dhovitvā upaṭṭhāpeti, pānīyaṃ paribhojanīyaṃ upaṭṭhāpeti. Yo pacchā gāmato piṇḍāya paṭikkamati, sace hoti bhuttāvaseso, sace ākaṅkhati bhuñjati, no ce ākaṅkhati appaharite vā chaḍḍeti, appāṇake vā udake opilāpeti; so āsanaṃ uddharati, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ paṭisāmeti, avakkārapātiṃ dhovitvā paṭisāmeti, pānīyaṃ paribhojanīyaṃ paṭisāmeti, bhattaggaṃ sammajjati. Yo passati pānīyaghaṭaṃ vā paribhojanīyaghaṭaṃ vā vaccaghaṭaṃ vā rittaṃ tucchaṃ so upaṭṭhāpeti. Sacassa hoti avisayhaṃ, hatthavikārena dutiyaṃ āmantetvā hatthavilaṅghakena upaṭṭhāpeti, na tveva tappaccayā vācaṃ bhindati.

209.At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. Now on that occasion several monks who were well-acquainted and alms-collecting companions had entered the rains residence in a certain monastery in the Kosalan countryside. Then those monks thought: “By what means could we dwell in unity, harmoniously, without disputes, spending the rains comfortably, and not exhausting ourselves with almsfood?” Then those monks thought: “If we neither converse nor chat with one another—whoever returns first from the village for almsfood should prepare the seats, set out the foot-washing water, the footstool, and the foot-wiping mat, wash the waste-food bowl and set it out, and set out drinking water and water for use. Whoever returns later from the village for almsfood—if there are leftovers and he wishes, he may eat; if he does not wish, he may discard them on green vegetation or drop them into water where there are no living beings. He should put away the seats, store away the foot-washing water, the footstool, and the foot-wiping mat, wash and store away the waste-food bowl, store away the drinking water and water for use, and sweep the dining hall. Whoever sees that the water jar for drinking, the water jar for use, or the water jar for the toilet is empty should set it out. If it is too heavy for him, he should call another by a gesture and, with their combined effort, set it out—but he should not break into speech because of that. In this way, we can dwell in unity, harmoniously, without disputes, spending the rains comfortably, and not exhausting ourselves with almsfood.” Then those monks neither conversed nor chatted with one another. Whoever returned first from the village for almsfood prepared the seats, set out the foot-washing water, the footstool, and the foot-wiping mat, washed the waste-food bowl and set it out, and set out drinking water and water for use. Whoever returned later from the village for almsfood—if there were leftovers and he wished, he ate; if he did not wish, he discarded them on green vegetation or dropped them into water where there are no living beings. He put away the seats, stored away the foot-washing water, the footstool, and the foot-wiping mat, washed and stored away the waste-food bowl, stored away the drinking water and water for use, and swept the dining hall. Whoever saw that the water jar for drinking, the water jar for use, or the water jar for the toilet was empty set it out. If it was too heavy for him, he called another by a gesture and, with their combined effort, set it out—but he did not break into speech because of that.

Āciṇṇaṃ kho panetaṃ vassaṃvuṭṭhānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ bhagavantaṃ dassanāya upasaṅkamituṃ. Atha kho te bhikkhū vassaṃvuṭṭhā temāsaccayena senāsanaṃ saṃsāmetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena sāvatthi tena pakkamiṃsu. Anupubbena yena sāvatthi jetavanaṃ anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāmo yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu. Āciṇṇaṃ kho panetaṃ buddhānaṃ bhagavantānaṃ āgantukehi bhikkhūhi saddhiṃ paṭisammodituṃ. Atha kho bhagavā te bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘kacci, bhikkhave, khamanīyaṃ, kacci yāpanīyaṃ, kacci samaggā sammodamānā avivadamānā phāsukaṃ vassaṃ vasittha, na ca piṇḍakena kilamitthā’’ti? ‘‘Khamanīyaṃ bhagavā, yāpanīyaṃ bhagavā. Samaggā ca mayaṃ, bhante, sammodamānā avivadamānā phāsukaṃ vassaṃ vasimhā, na ca piṇḍakena kilamimhā’’ti. Jānantāpi tathāgatā pucchanti, jānantāpi na pucchanti. Kālaṃ viditvā pucchanti, kālaṃ viditvā na pucchanti. Atthasaṃhitaṃ tathāgatā pucchanti, no anatthasaṃhitaṃ. Anatthasaṃhite setughāto tathāgatānaṃ. Dvīhākārehi buddhā bhagavanto bhikkhū paṭipucchanti – dhammaṃ vā desessāma, sāvakānaṃ vā sikkhāpadaṃ paññapessāmāti. Atha kho bhagavā te bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘yathākathaṃ pana tumhe, bhikkhave, samaggā sammodamānā avivadamānā phāsukaṃ vassaṃ vasittha, na ca piṇḍakena kilamitthā’’ti.

Now it is customary for monks who have completed the rains residence to visit the Blessed One. Then those monks, having completed the rains residence after three months, put their lodgings in order, took their bowls and robes, and set out for Sāvatthī. Gradually, they arrived at Sāvatthī, at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, and approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Now it is customary for the Blessed Buddhas to exchange greetings with visiting monks. Then the Blessed One said to those monks: “I hope, monks, it has been comfortable; I hope it has been bearable? I hope you have spent the rains in harmony, mutual appreciation, without dispute, comfortably, and without trouble obtaining alms food?” “It has been comfortable, Blessed One, it has been bearable, Blessed One. We have spent the rains, venerable sir, in harmony, mutual appreciation, without dispute, comfortably, and without trouble obtaining alms food.” Even though the Tathāgatas know, they ask; even though they know, they do not ask. They ask knowing the right time, and they do not ask knowing the wrong time. The Tathāgatas ask what is meaningful, not what is meaningless. For the Tathāgatas, what is meaningless is like a broken bridge. The Blessed Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: either to teach the Dhamma or to lay down a training rule for the disciples. Then the Blessed One said to those monks: “But how, monks, did you spend the rains in harmony, mutual appreciation, without dispute, comfortably, and without trouble obtaining alms food?”

Idha mayaṃ, bhante, sambahulā sandiṭṭhā sambhattā bhikkhū kosalesu janapade aññatarasmiṃ āvāse vassaṃ upagacchimhā. Tesaṃ no, bhante, amhākaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kena nu kho mayaṃ upāyena samaggā sammodamānā avivadamānā phāsukaṃ vassaṃ vaseyyāma, na ca piṇḍakena kilameyyāmā’’ti. Tesaṃ no, bhante, amhākaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘sace kho mayaṃ aññamaññaṃ neva ālapeyyāma na sallapeyyāma – yo paṭhamaṃ gāmato piṇḍāya paṭikkameyya so āsanaṃ paññapeyya, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipeyya, avakkārapātiṃ dhovitvā upaṭṭhāpeyya, pānīyaṃ paribhojanīyaṃ upaṭṭhāpeyya; yo pacchā gāmato piṇḍāya paṭikkameyya, sacassa bhuttāvaseso, sace ākaṅkheyya bhuñjeyya, no ce ākaṅkheyya appaharite vā chaḍḍeyya, appāṇake vā udake opilāpeyya; so āsanaṃ uddhareyya, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ paṭisāmeyya, avakkārapātiṃ dhovitvā paṭisāmeyya, pānīyaṃ paribhojanīyaṃ paṭisāmeyya, bhattaggaṃ sammajjeyya; yo passeyya pānīyaghaṭaṃ vā paribhojanīyaghaṭaṃ vā vaccaghaṭaṃ vā rittaṃ tucchaṃ so upaṭṭhāpeyya; sacassa hoti avisayhaṃ, hatthavikārena dutiyaṃ āmantetvā hatthavilaṅghakena upaṭṭhāpeyya; na tveva tappaccayā vācaṃ bhindeyya – evaṃ kho mayaṃ samaggā sammodamānā avivadamānā phāsukaṃ vassaṃ vaseyyāma, na ca piṇḍakena kilameyyāmā’’ti.

Here, venerable sir, several bhikkhus, acquainted and associated with each other, entered the rains residence in a certain dwelling in the Kosala country. Then, venerable sir, this occurred to us: “By what means could we dwell in concord, in harmony, without dispute, spending the rains comfortably, without being troubled by almsfood?” Then, venerable sir, this occurred to us: “Suppose we neither address nor converse with one another. Whoever returns first from the village after the alms-round should prepare the seats, set out the foot-washing water, the footstool, and the foot-wiping mat, wash the refuse bowl and set it out, and set out drinking water and water for use. Whoever returns later from the village after the alms-round, if there are leftovers, if he wishes, he may eat; if he does not wish to eat, he should discard them where there is little greenery or drop them into water where there are no living beings. He should put away the seats, store the foot-washing water, the footstool, and the foot-wiping mat, wash the refuse bowl and store it, and store the drinking water and water for use. He should sweep the refectory. Whoever sees that the water pot, the water for use pot, or the toilet pot is empty should fill it. If it is too much for him, having gestured to a second person, he should have him fill it by a hand signal; but he should not break into speech on that account. In this way, we could dwell in concord, in harmony, without dispute, spending the rains comfortably, without being troubled by almsfood.” Then, venerable sir, we neither addressed nor conversed with one another. Whoever returned first from the village after the alms-round prepared the seats, set out the foot-washing water, the footstool, and the foot-wiping mat, washed the refuse bowl and set it out, and set out drinking water and water for use. Whoever returned later from the village after the alms-round, if there were leftovers, if he wished, he ate; if he did not wish to eat, he discarded them where there was little greenery or dropped them into water where there are no living beings. He put away the seats, stored the foot-washing water, the footstool, and the foot-wiping mat, washed the refuse bowl and stored it, and stored the drinking water and water for use. He swept the refectory. Whoever saw that the water pot, the water for use pot, or the toilet pot was empty filled it. If it was too much for him, having gestured to a second person, he had him fill it by a hand signal; but he did not break into speech on that account. In this way, venerable sir, we dwelled in concord, in harmony, without dispute, spending the rains comfortably, without being troubled by almsfood.

Atha kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘aphāsuññeva [aphāsukaññeva (sī.)] kirame [kirime (ka.)], bhikkhave, moghapurisā vuṭṭhā [vutthā (ka.)] samānā phāsumhā [phāsukamhā (sī.)] vuṭṭhāti paṭijānanti. Pasusaṃvāsaññeva kirame, bhikkhave, moghapurisā vuṭṭhā samānā phāsumhā vuṭṭhāti paṭijānanti. Eḷakasaṃvāsaññeva kirame, bhikkhave, moghapurisā vuṭṭhā samānā phāsumhā vuṭṭhāti paṭijānanti.

Netaṃ, bhikkhave, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… vigarahitvā dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – na, bhikkhave, mūgabbataṃ titthiyasamādānaṃ samādiyitabbaṃ. Yo samādiyeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, vassaṃvuṭṭhānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ tīhi ṭhānehi pavāretuṃ – diṭṭhena vā sutena vā parisaṅkāya vā. Sā vo bhavissati aññamaññānulomatā āpattivuṭṭhānatā vinayapurekkhāratā. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, pavāretabbaṃ. Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “These foolish men, bhikkhus, having emerged, declare that they have emerged from ease, when in fact they have emerged from discomfort. These foolish men, bhikkhus, having emerged, declare that they have emerged from ease, when in fact they have emerged from an animal-like dwelling. These foolish men, bhikkhus, having emerged, declare that they have emerged from ease, when in fact they have emerged from a goat-like dwelling. These foolish men, bhikkhus, having emerged, declare that they have emerged from ease, when in fact they have emerged from a dwelling with adversaries. How can these foolish men, bhikkhus, undertake a vow of silence, a practice adopted by sectarians?” This is not, bhikkhus, for inspiring confidence in those who are not confident… Having rebuked them, given a Dhamma talk, he addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, a vow of silence, a practice adopted by sectarians, should not be undertaken. Whoever undertakes it commits an offense of wrong conduct. I allow, bhikkhus, bhikkhus who have completed the rains residence to invite each other based on three grounds: what has been seen, what has been heard, or what is suspected. That will lead to your mutual harmony, to the resolution of offenses, and to prioritizing the discipline.” And thus, bhikkhus, the invitation should be made. A competent bhikkhu should inform the Sangha:

210. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ajja pavāraṇā. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho pavāreyyā’’ti.

210.“Venerable sir, may the Sangha hear me. Today is the Pavāraṇā. If it seems fit to the Sangha, let the Sangha hold Pavāraṇā.”

Therena bhikkhunā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘saṅghaṃ, āvuso, pavāremi diṭṭhena vā sutena vā parisaṅkāya vā. Vadantu maṃ āyasmanto anukampaṃ upādāya. Passanto paṭikarissāmi. Dutiyampi, āvuso, saṅghaṃ pavāremi diṭṭhena vā sutena vā parisaṅkāya vā. Vadantu maṃ āyasmanto anukampaṃ upādāya. Passanto paṭikarissāmi. Tatiyampi, āvuso, saṅghaṃ pavāremi diṭṭhena vā sutena vā parisaṅkāya vā. Vadantu maṃ āyasmanto anukampaṃ upādāya. Passanto paṭikarissāmī’’ti.

By an elder bhikkhu, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, sitting squatting, and raising his joined palms, this should be said: “Sirs, I invite the Sangha to point out anything seen, heard, or suspected about me. Out of compassion, sirs, please speak. Seeing it, I will make amends. For the second time, sirs, I invite the Sangha to point out anything seen, heard, or suspected about me. Out of compassion, sirs, please speak. Seeing it, I will make amends. For the third time, sirs, I invite the Sangha to point out anything seen, heard, or suspected about me. Out of compassion, sirs, please speak. Seeing it, I will make amends.”

Navakena bhikkhunā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘saṅghaṃ, bhante, pavāremi diṭṭhena vā sutena vā parisaṅkāya vā. Vadantu maṃ āyasmanto anukampaṃ upādāya. Passanto paṭikarissāmi. Dutiyampi, bhante, saṅghaṃ…pe… tatiyampi, bhante, saṅghaṃ pavāremi diṭṭhena vā sutena vā parisaṅkāya vā. Vadantu maṃ āyasmanto anukampaṃ upādāya. Passanto paṭikarissāmī’’ti.

By a junior bhikkhu, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, sitting squatting, and raising his joined palms, this should be said: “Venerable sirs, I invite the Sangha to point out anything seen, heard, or suspected about me. Out of compassion, let the venerable ones speak to me. Seeing it, I will make amends. For the second time, venerable sirs, I invite the Sangha… For the third time, venerable sirs, I invite the Sangha to point out anything seen, heard, or suspected about me. Out of compassion, let the venerable ones speak to me. Seeing it, I will make amends.”

211. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū theresu bhikkhūsu ukkuṭikaṃ nisinnesu pavārayamānesu āsanesu acchanti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma chabbaggiyā bhikkhū theresu bhikkhūsu ukkuṭikaṃ nisinnesu pavārayamānesu āsanesu acchissantī’’ti. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, chabbaggiyā bhikkhū theresu bhikkhūsu ukkuṭikaṃ nisinnesu pavārayamānesu āsanesu acchantī’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ, bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… ‘‘kathañhi nāma te, bhikkhave, moghapurisā theresu bhikkhūsu ukkuṭikaṃ nisinnesu pavārayamānesu āsanesu acchissa’’nti. Netaṃ, bhikkhave, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya, pasannānaṃ vā bhiyyobhāvāya…pe… vigarahitvā dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, theresu bhikkhūsu ukkuṭikaṃ nisinnesu pavārayamānesu āsanesu acchitabbaṃ. Yo accheyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sabbeheva ukkuṭikaṃ nisinnehi pavāretu’’nti.

211.Now at that time the bhikkhus from the group of six sat on seats while the elder bhikkhus were sitting squatting and holding the invitation ceremony. The bhikkhus who were modest … complained and criticized them: “How can the bhikkhus from the group of six sit on seats while the elder bhikkhus are sitting squatting and holding the invitation ceremony?” Then those bhikkhus reported this matter to the Blessed One. … “Is it true, bhikkhus, that the bhikkhus from the group of six sit on seats while the elder bhikkhus are sitting squatting and holding the invitation ceremony?” “It’s true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One rebuked them: “… How can those foolish men sit on seats while the elder bhikkhus are sitting squatting and holding the invitation ceremony? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it …” After rebuking them and giving a Dhamma talk, he addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, one should not sit on a seat while elder bhikkhus are sitting squatting and holding the invitation ceremony. If one does, one commits an offense of wrong conduct. I allow that all who are sitting squatting may hold the invitation ceremony.”

Tena kho pana samayena aññataro thero jarādubbalo yāva sabbe pavārentīti [yāva sabbe pavārenti (syā.)] ukkuṭikaṃ nisinno āgamayamāno mucchito papati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, tadamantarā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīdituṃ yāva pavāreti, pavāretvā āsane nisīditunti.

At that time, a certain elder bhikkhu, weak with age, sat squatting waiting for everyone to finish inviting criticism and fainted. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, bhikkhus, that in the interim one may sit squatting until the invitation is finished, and after inviting criticism, sit on a seat.”

Aphāsukavihāro niṭṭhito.

The discourse on dwelling in discomfort is finished.

121.Divisions of Pavāraṇā.

212. Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kati nu kho pavāraṇā’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Dvemā, bhikkhave, pavāraṇā – cātuddasikā ca pannarasikā ca. Imā kho, bhikkhave, dve pavāraṇāti.

212.Then the bhikkhus thought thus: “How many Pavāraṇās are there?” They reported this to the Blessed One. “Monks, these are the two Pavāraṇās: the fourteenth-day and the fifteenth-day. These, monks, are the two Pavāraṇās.”

Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kati nu kho pavāraṇakammānī’’ti? [pavāraṇākammānīti (syā.)] Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Cattārimāni, bhikkhave, pavāraṇakammāni – adhammena vaggaṃ pavāraṇakammaṃ, adhammena samaggaṃ pavāraṇakammaṃ, dhammena vaggaṃ pavāraṇakammaṃ, dhammena samaggaṃ pavāraṇakammaṃ. Tatra, bhikkhave, yadidaṃ adhammena vaggaṃ pavāraṇakammaṃ, na, bhikkhave, evarūpaṃ pavāraṇakammaṃ kātabbaṃ; na ca mayā evarūpaṃ pavāraṇakammaṃ anuññātaṃ. Tatra, bhikkhave, yadidaṃ adhammena samaggaṃ pavāraṇakammaṃ, na, bhikkhave, evarūpaṃ pavāraṇakammaṃ kātabbaṃ; na ca mayā evarūpaṃ pavāraṇakammaṃ anuññātaṃ. Tatra, bhikkhave, yadidaṃ dhammena vaggaṃ pavāraṇakammaṃ, na, bhikkhave, evarūpaṃ pavāraṇakammaṃ kātabbaṃ; na ca mayā evarūpaṃ pavāraṇakammaṃ anuññātaṃ. Tatra, bhikkhave, yadidaṃ dhammena samaggaṃ pavāraṇakammaṃ, evarūpaṃ, bhikkhave, pavāraṇakammaṃ kātabbaṃ; evarūpañca mayā pavāraṇakammaṃ anuññātaṃ. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, evarūpaṃ pavāraṇakammaṃ karissāma yadidaṃ dhammena samagganti, evañhi vo, bhikkhave, sikkhitabbanti.

Then the bhikkhus thought thus: “How many acts of Pavāraṇā are there?” They reported this to the Blessed One. “Monks, these are the four acts of Pavāraṇā: an unlawful act of Pavāraṇā by a faction, an unlawful act of Pavāraṇā by a united community, a lawful act of Pavāraṇā by a faction, and a lawful act of Pavāraṇā by a united community. Herein, monks, that which is an unlawful act of Pavāraṇā by a faction should not be done, nor have I permitted such an act of Pavāraṇā. Herein, monks, that which is an unlawful act of Pavāraṇā by a united community should not be done, nor have I permitted such an act of Pavāraṇā. Herein, monks, that which is a lawful act of Pavāraṇā by a faction should not be done, nor have I permitted such an act of Pavāraṇā. Herein, monks, that which is a lawful act of Pavāraṇā by a united community should be done, and I have permitted such an act of Pavāraṇā. Therefore, monks, you should perform such an act of Pavāraṇā as is lawful and by a united community. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”

Pavāraṇābhedā niṭṭhitā.

The Divisions of Pavāraṇā are concluded.

122.Permission to Give Pavāraṇā.

Evañca pana, bhikkhave, dātabbā – tena gilānena bhikkhunā ekaṃ bhikkhuṃ upasaṅkamitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘pavāraṇaṃ dammi, pavāraṇaṃ me hara, pavāraṇaṃ me ārocehi, mamatthāya pavārehī’’ti kāyena viññāpeti, vācāya viññāpeti, kāyena vācāya viññāpeti, dinnā hoti pavāraṇā; na kāyena viññāpeti, na vācāya viññāpeti, na kāyena vācāya viññāpeti, na dinnā hoti pavāraṇā. Evañcetaṃ labhetha, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce labhetha, so, bhikkhave, gilāno bhikkhu mañcena vā pīṭhena vā saṅghamajjhe ānetvā pavāretabbaṃ. Sace, bhikkhave, gilānupaṭṭhākānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘sace kho mayaṃ gilānaṃ ṭhānā cāvessāma, ābādho vā abhivaḍḍhissati, kālaṃkiriyā vā bhavissatī’’ti na, bhikkhave, gilāno bhikkhu ṭhānā cāvetabbo. Saṅghena tattha gantvā pavāretabbaṃ; na tveva vaggena saṅghena pavāretabbaṃ. Pavāreyya ce, āpatti dukkaṭassa.

213.Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Gather, monks. The Saṅgha will perform the Pavāraṇā.” When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, there is a sick bhikkhu who has not come.” “Monks, I permit a sick bhikkhu to give the Pavāraṇā. And thus, monks, it should be given: that sick bhikkhu should approach one bhikkhu, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, squat down, raise his joined palms, and say thus: ‘I give the Pavāraṇā; convey my Pavāraṇā; announce my Pavāraṇā; perform the Pavāraṇā on my behalf.’ If he makes it known by body, by speech, or by both body and speech, the Pavāraṇā is given. If he does not make it known by body, by speech, or by both body and speech, the Pavāraṇā is not given. If he obtains it thus, that is good. If he does not obtain it, then, monks, that sick bhikkhu should be brought into the midst of the Saṅgha on a bed or a chair, and the Pavāraṇā should be performed. If, monks, the bhikkhus attending the sick bhikkhu think: ‘If we move the sick one from his place, the illness might increase, or there might be a dying,’ then, monks, the sick bhikkhu should not be moved from his place. The Saṅgha should go there and perform the Pavāraṇā. But the Pavāraṇā should not be performed by a factional Saṅgha. If one performs it, there is an offense of wrong-doing.

If, bhikkhus, the Pavāraṇā-bearer departs right there after the Pavāraṇā has been given, the Pavāraṇā should be given to another.

If, bhikkhus, the Pavāraṇā-bearer, having reached the Saṅgha after the Pavāraṇā has been given, falls asleep and does not announce it, the Pavāraṇā is brought. There is no offense for the Pavāraṇā-bearer. If, bhikkhus, the Pavāraṇā-bearer, having reached the Saṅgha after the Pavāraṇā has been given, is negligent and does not announce it… is in absorption and does not announce it, the Pavāraṇā is brought. There is no offense for the Pavāraṇā-bearer.

If, bhikkhus, the Pavāraṇā-bearer, having reached the Saṅgha after the Pavāraṇā has been given, intentionally does not announce it, the Pavāraṇā is brought. The Pavāraṇā-bearer incurs an offense of wrong-doing. Monks, I permit that on the day of the Pavāraṇā, when giving the Pavāraṇā, one may also give consent, thinking: ‘The Saṅgha has business to do.’

Pavāraṇādānānujānanā niṭṭhitā.

The Permission to Give Pavāraṇā is concluded.

123.The Discussion on Seizing by Relatives, etc.

214. Tena kho pana samayena aññataraṃ bhikkhuṃ tadahu pavāraṇāya ñātakā gaṇhiṃsu. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhuṃ tadahu pavāraṇāya ñātakā gaṇhanti.

No ce labhetha, na tveva vaggena saṅghena pavāretabbaṃ. Pavāreyya ce, āpatti dukkaṭassa.

214.Now on that occasion, relatives seized a certain monk on the day of the Pavāraṇā. They informed the Blessed One about this matter. "Here, monks, should relatives seize a monk on the day of the Pavāraṇā, those relatives should be addressed by the monks thus: ‘Please, venerable ones, release this monk for a moment, so that this monk may perform the Pavāraṇā.’ If this is achieved, it is good. If not, those relatives should be addressed by the monks thus: ‘Please, venerable ones, stand aside for a moment, so that this monk may perform the Pavāraṇā.’ If this is achieved, it is good. If not, those relatives should be addressed by the monks thus: ‘Please, venerable ones, take this monk outside the boundary for a moment, so that the Sangha may perform the Pavāraṇā.’ If this is achieved, it is good. If not, the Pavāraṇā should not be performed by a factional Sangha. If they perform it, there is an offense of wrong-doing."

Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhuṃ tadahu pavāraṇāya rājāno gaṇhanti…pe… corā gaṇhanti … dhuttā gaṇhanti… bhikkhupaccatthikā gaṇhanti. Te bhikkhupaccatthikā bhikkhūhi evamassu vacanīyā – ‘‘iṅgha, tumhe āyasmanto imaṃ bhikkhuṃ muhuttaṃ muñcatha, yāvāyaṃ bhikkhu pavāretī’’ti. Evañcetaṃ labhetha, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce labhetha, te bhikkhupaccatthikā bhikkhūhi evamassu vacanīyā – ‘‘iṅgha, tumhe āyasmanto muhuttaṃ ekamantaṃ hotha, yāvāyaṃ bhikkhu pavāraṇaṃ detī’’ti. Evañcetaṃ labhetha, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ.

No ce labhetha, na tveva vaggena saṅghena pavāretabbaṃ. Pavāreyya ce, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

Here, monks, should a king seize a monk on the day of Pavāraṇā… or thieves seize him… or gamblers seize him… or opponents of the monks seize him, those opponents of the monks should be addressed by the monks thus: ‘Please, venerable ones, release this monk for a moment, so that this monk may perform the Pavāraṇā.’ If this is achieved, it is good. If not, those opponents of the monks should be addressed by the monks thus: ‘Please, venerable ones, stand aside for a moment, so that this monk may perform the Pavāraṇā.’ If this is achieved, it is good. If not, those opponents of the monks should be addressed by the monks thus: ‘Please, venerable ones, take this monk outside the boundary for a moment, so that the Sangha may perform the Pavāraṇā.’ If this is achieved, it is good. If not, the Pavāraṇā should not be performed by a factional Sangha. If they perform it, there is an offense of wrong-doing."

Then this occurred to those monks: "The Blessed One has prescribed that the Pavāraṇā should be performed by the Sangha. But there are five of us. How should we perform the Pavāraṇā?" They informed the Blessed One about this matter. "I allow, monks, five to perform the Pavāraṇā as a Sangha."

They informed the Blessed One about this matter. "I allow, monks, four to perform Pavāraṇā with one another. And thus, monks, should the Pavāraṇā be performed: A competent and capable monk should inform the other monks:

‘‘Suṇantu me āyasmanto. Ajja pavāraṇā. Yadāyasmantānaṃ pattakallaṃ, mayaṃ aññamaññaṃ pavāreyyāmā’’ti.

218.Now at that time, in a certain monastery, a certain bhikkhu was dwelling on the day of the Pavāraṇā. Then it occurred to that bhikkhu: “The Blessed One has allowed five to perform Pavāraṇā as a Saṅgha, four to perform Pavāraṇā with one another, three to perform Pavāraṇā with one another, two to perform Pavāraṇā with one another. But I am alone. How should I perform Pavāraṇā?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, aññatarasmiṃ āvāse tadahu pavāraṇāya eko bhikkhu viharati. Tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā yattha bhikkhū paṭikkamanti upaṭṭhānasālāya vā maṇḍape vā rukkhamūle vā, so deso sammajjitvā pānīyaṃ paribhojanīyaṃ upaṭṭhāpetvā āsanaṃ paññapetvā padīpaṃ katvā nisīditabbaṃ. Sace aññe bhikkhū āgacchanti, tehi saddhiṃ pavāretabbaṃ; no ce āgacchanti, ‘ajja me pavāraṇā’ti adhiṭṭhātabbaṃ. No ce adhiṭṭheyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa.

Here, bhikkhus, in a certain monastery, a certain bhikkhu is dwelling on the day of the Pavāraṇā. That bhikkhu, bhikkhus, should sweep that place where bhikkhus gather—whether in the assembly hall, a pavilion, or at the foot of a tree—prepare drinking water and water for washing, arrange a seat, light a lamp, and sit down. If other bhikkhus arrive, he should perform Pavāraṇā with them; but if they do not arrive, he should resolve: ‘Today is my Pavāraṇā.’ If he does not resolve it, there is an offense of wrong-doing.

Tatra, bhikkhave, yattha pañca bhikkhū viharanti, na ekassa pavāraṇaṃ āharitvā

Here, bhikkhus, where five bhikkhus are dwelling, one should not perform the Pavāraṇā by excluding one.

Catūhi saṅghe pavāretabbaṃ. Pavāreyyuṃ ce, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Tatra, bhikkhave, yattha cattāro bhikkhū viharanti, na ekassa pavāraṇaṃ āharitvā tīhi aññamaññaṃ pavāretabbaṃ. Pavāreyyuṃ ce, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Tatra, bhikkhave, yattha tayo bhikkhū viharanti, na ekassa pavāraṇaṃ āharitvā dvīhi aññamaññaṃ pavāretabbaṃ. Pavāreyyuṃ ce, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Tatra, bhikkhave, yattha dve bhikkhū viharanti, na ekassa pavāraṇaṃ āharitvā ekena adhiṭṭhātabbaṃ. Adhiṭṭheyya ce, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

If it is performed as a Saṅgha by four (when five are present and one is excluded), there is an offense of wrong-doing. Here, bhikkhus, where four bhikkhus are dwelling, one should not perform the Pavāraṇā by excluding one and then perform it with the remaining three with one another. If they perform it (in this way), there is an offense of wrong-doing. Here, bhikkhus, where three bhikkhus are dwelling, one should not perform the Pavāraṇā by excluding one and then perform it with the remaining two with one another. If they perform it (in this way), there is an offense of wrong-doing. Here, bhikkhus, where two bhikkhus are dwelling, one should not perform the Pavāraṇā by excluding one and then resolve it alone. If one resolves it (in this way), there is an offense of wrong-doing.

Saṅghapavāraṇādippabhedā niṭṭhitā.

The sections on Saṅgha Pavāraṇā and so forth are concluded.

219.Now at that time, a certain bhikkhu had incurred an offense on the day of the Pavāraṇā. Then it occurred to that bhikkhu: “The Blessed One has laid down: ‘One who has an offense should not perform Pavāraṇā.’ But I have incurred an offense. How should I proceed?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu tadahu pavāraṇāya āpattiṃ āpanno hoti. Tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā ekaṃ bhikkhuṃ upasaṅkamitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘ahaṃ, āvuso, itthannāmaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno, taṃ paṭidesemī’’ti. Tena vattabbo – ‘‘passasī’’ti. Āma passāmīti. Āyatiṃ saṃvareyyāsīti.

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has incurred an offense on the day of the Pavāraṇā. That bhikkhu, bhikkhus, should approach a bhikkhu, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, squat down, raise his joined palms, and say: “Friend, I have incurred such-and-such an offense; I confess it.” He should be asked: “Do you see it?” “Yes, I see it.” “You should restrain yourself in the future.”

Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu tadahu pavāraṇāya āpattiyā vematiko hoti. Tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā ekaṃ bhikkhuṃ upasaṅkamitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘ahaṃ, āvuso, itthannāmāya āpattiyā vematiko; yadā nibbematiko bhavissāmi tadā taṃ āpattiṃ paṭikarissāmī’’ti vatvā pavāretabbaṃ; na tveva tappaccayā pavāraṇāya antarāyo kātabboti.

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is uncertain about an offense on the day of the Pavāraṇā. That bhikkhu, bhikkhus, should approach a bhikkhu, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, squat down, raise his joined palms, and say: “Friend, I am uncertain about such-and-such an offense; when I am free from uncertainty, I will make amends for that offense.” Having said this, he should perform Pavāraṇā; but no obstacle to the Pavāraṇā should be made on that account.

Āpattipaṭikammavidhi niṭṭhitā.

The procedure for making amends for offenses is concluded.

126.Procedure for the Disclosure of Offences

220. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu pavārayamāno āpattiṃ sarati. Atha kho tassa bhikkhuno etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā paññattaṃ ‘na sāpattikena pavāretabba’nti. Ahañcamhi āpattiṃ āpanno. Kathaṃ nu kho mayā paṭipajjitabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

220.At that time, a certain bhikkhu, while performing the Pavāraṇā, recalled an offence. Then that bhikkhu thought: ‘The Blessed One has laid down that one who has committed an offence should not perform the Pavāraṇā. But I have committed an offence. How should I proceed?’ They reported this matter to the Blessed One.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu pavārayamāno āpattiṃ sarati. Tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā sāmanto bhikkhu evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘ahaṃ, āvuso, itthannāmaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno. Ito vuṭṭhahitvā taṃ āpattiṃ paṭikarissāmī’’ti vatvā pavāretabbaṃ; na tveva tappaccayā pavāraṇāya antarāyo kātabbo.

Here, monks, if a bhikkhu, while performing the Pavāraṇā, recalls an offence, then, monks, that bhikkhu should say to a nearby bhikkhu thus: ‘Friend, I have committed such-and-such an offence. After rising from here, I will rectify that offence.’ Having said this, he should perform the Pavāraṇā; but no obstacle to the Pavāraṇā should be made on that account.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu pavārayamāno āpattiyā vematiko hoti. Tena, bhikkhave,

Here, monks, if a bhikkhu, while performing the Pavāraṇā, is doubtful concerning an offence, then, monks,

Bhikkhunā sāmanto bhikkhu evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘ahaṃ, āvuso, itthannāmāya āpattiyā vematiko; yadā nibbematiko bhavissāmi tadā taṃ āpattiṃ paṭikarissāmī’’ti vatvā pavāretabbaṃ; na tveva tappaccayā pavāraṇāya antarāyo kātabboti.

that bhikkhu should say to a nearby bhikkhu thus: ‘Friend, I am doubtful concerning such-and-such an offence; when I am free from doubt, I will rectify that offence.’ Having said this, he should perform the Pavāraṇā; but no obstacle to the Pavāraṇā should be made on that account.

Atha kho tesaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā paññattaṃ ‘na sabhāgā āpatti desetabbā, na sabhāgā āpatti paṭiggahetabbā’ti. Ayañca sabbo saṅgho sabhāgaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno. Kathaṃ nu kho amhehi paṭipajjitabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

221.At that time, in a certain dwelling, on the day of the Pavāraṇā, the entire Sangha had committed a shared offence. Then those bhikkhus thought: ‘The Blessed One has laid down: “A shared offence should not be confessed, nor should a shared offence be accepted.” And now this entire Sangha has committed a shared offence. How should we proceed?’ They reported this matter to the Blessed One.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, aññatarasmiṃ āvāse tadahu pavāraṇāya sabbo saṅgho sabhāgaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno hoti.

Here, monks, if in a certain dwelling, on the day of the Pavāraṇā, the entire Sangha has committed a shared offence, then, monks, those bhikkhus should promptly send one bhikkhu to a nearby dwelling, saying: ‘Go, friend, rectify that offence and return, then we will rectify that offence in your presence.’ If this can be obtained, it is good. If not, a competent and capable bhikkhu should inform the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ sabbo saṅgho sabhāgaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno. Yadā aññaṃ bhikkhuṃ suddhaṃ anāpattikaṃ passissati tadā tassa santike taṃ āpattiṃ paṭikarissatī’’ti vatvā pavāretabbaṃ; na tveva tappaccayā pavāraṇāya antarāyo kātabbo.

‘Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. This entire Sangha has committed a shared offence. When it sees another bhikkhu who is pure and free from offence, it will then rectify that offence in his presence.’ Having said this, they should perform the Pavāraṇā; but no obstacle to the Pavāraṇā should be made on that account.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, aññatarasmiṃ āvāse tadahu pavāraṇāya sabbo saṅgho sabhāgāya āpattiyā vematiko hoti. Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

Here, monks, if in a certain dwelling, on the day of the Pavāraṇā, the entire Sangha is doubtful concerning a shared offence, then a competent and capable bhikkhu should inform the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ sabbo saṅgho sabhāgāya āpattiyā vematiko. Yadā nibbematiko bhavissati tadā taṃ āpattiṃ paṭikarissatī’’ti vatvā, pavāretabbaṃ, na tveva tappaccayā pavāraṇāya antarāyo kātabboti.

222.At that time, in a certain dwelling, on the day of the Pavāraṇā, many resident bhikkhus had assembled, five or more. They did not know: ‘There are other resident bhikkhus who have not yet arrived.’ Perceiving the Dhamma, perceiving the Vinaya, perceiving a divided group as united, they performed the Pavāraṇā. While they were performing it, other resident bhikkhus arrived, more numerous. They reported this matter to the Blessed One.

140.The Pavāraṇā with Two Declarations, etc.

234. Tena kho pana samayena kosalesu janapade aññatarasmiṃ āvāse tadahu pavāraṇāya savarabhayaṃ ahosi. Bhikkhū nāsakkhiṃsu tevācikaṃ pavāretuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, dvevācikaṃ pavāretunti.

234.At that time, in a certain dwelling in the Kosala country, on the day of the Pavāraṇā, there was a fear of robbers. The monks were unable to perform the Pavāraṇā with three declarations. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow you to perform the Pavāraṇā with two declarations.”

Bāḷhataraṃ savarabhayaṃ ahosi. Bhikkhū nāsakkhiṃsu dvevācikaṃ pavāretuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, ekavācikaṃ pavāretunti.

The fear of robbers became even stronger. The monks were unable to perform the Pavāraṇā with two declarations. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow you to perform the Pavāraṇā with one declaration.”

Bāḷhataraṃ savarabhayaṃ ahosi. Bhikkhū nāsakkhiṃsu ekavācikaṃ pavāretuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, samānavassikaṃ pavāretunti.

The fear of robbers became even stronger. The monks were unable to perform the Pavāraṇā with one declaration. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow you to perform the Pavāraṇā by those of the same rains residence.”

Tena kho pana samayena aññatarasmiṃ āvāse tadahu pavāraṇāya manussehi dānaṃ dentehi yebhuyyena ratti khepitā hoti.

At that time, in a certain dwelling, on the day of the Pavāraṇā, people had spent most of the night giving alms. Then it occurred to those monks: “People have spent most of the night giving alms. If the Saṅgha performs the Pavāraṇā with three declarations, the Saṅgha will remain un-Pavāraṇā-ed, and this night will dawn. What should we do?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Here, monks, in a certain dwelling, on the day of the Pavāraṇā, people have spent most of the night giving alms. If, monks, the monks think: ‘People have spent most of the night giving alms. If the Saṅgha performs the Pavāraṇā with three declarations, the Saṅgha will remain un-Pavāraṇā-ed, and this night will dawn,’ then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Manussehi dānaṃ dentehi yebhuyyena ratti khepitā. Sace saṅgho tevācikaṃ pavāressati, appavāritova saṅgho bhavissati, athāyaṃ ratti vibhāyissati. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho dvevācikaṃ, ekavācikaṃ, samānavassikaṃ pavāreyyā’’ti.

“Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha listen to me. People have spent most of the night giving alms. If the Saṅgha performs the Pavāraṇā with three declarations, the Saṅgha will remain un-Pavāraṇā-ed, and this night will dawn. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should perform the Pavāraṇā with two declarations, one declaration, or by those of the same rains residence.”

Here, monks, in a certain dwelling, on the day of the Pavāraṇā, while monks were reciting Dhamma… while reciters of Suttas were chanting Suttas… while Vinaya-holders were deciding Vinaya… while Dhamma-speakers were discussing Dhamma… or while monks were quarreling, most of the night had been spent. If the monks think: ‘While monks were quarreling, most of the night has been spent. If the Saṅgha performs the Pavāraṇā with three declarations, the Saṅgha will remain un-Pavāraṇā-ed, and this night will dawn,’ then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Bhikkhūhi kalahaṃ karontehi yebhuyyena ratti khepitā. Sace saṅgho tevācikaṃ pavāressati, appavāritova saṅgho bhavissati, athāyaṃ ratti vibhāyissati. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho dvevācikaṃ, ekavācikaṃ, samānavassikaṃ pavāreyyā’’ti.

At that time, in a certain dwelling in the Kosala country, on the day of the Pavāraṇā, a large Saṅgha of monks had gathered, the space sheltered from rain was small, and a great cloud had arisen. Then it occurred to those monks: “This large Saṅgha of monks has gathered, the space sheltered from rain is small, and a great cloud has arisen. If the Saṅgha performs the Pavāraṇā with three declarations, the Saṅgha will remain un-Pavāraṇā-ed, and this cloud will pour down.

If the monks there think: ‘This is a danger to the holy life.

141.The Suspension of the Invitation

235. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū sāpattikā pavārenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, sāpattikena pavāretabbaṃ. Yo pavāreyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, yo sāpattiko pavāreti, tassa okāsaṃ kārāpetvā āpattiyā codetunti.

235.At that time, the monks of the group of six made the invitation while having offenses. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, one who has an offense should not make the invitation. Whoever makes the invitation, there is an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, that if one who has an offense makes the invitation, he should be given an opportunity and then charged with the offense.”

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū okāsaṃ kārāpiyamānā na icchanti okāsaṃ kātuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, okāsaṃ akarontassa pavāraṇaṃ ṭhapetuṃ.

At that time, the monks of the group of six, when asked to make an opportunity, did not wish to make an opportunity. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, to suspend the invitation for one who does not make an opportunity. And thus, monks, it should be suspended. On the day of the invitation, on the fourteenth or fifteenth, with that person present, it should be announced in the midst of the Sangha: ‘Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. Such-and-such a person has an offense. I suspend the invitation for him. One should not make the invitation in his presence.’ The invitation is suspended.”

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū – puramhākaṃ pesalā bhikkhū pavāraṇaṃ ṭhapentīti – paṭikacceva suddhānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ anāpattikānaṃ avatthusmiṃ akāraṇe pavāraṇaṃ ṭhapenti, pavāritānampi pavāraṇaṃ ṭhapenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, suddhānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ anāpattikānaṃ avatthusmiṃ akāraṇe pavāraṇā ṭhapetabbā. Yo ṭhapeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Na, bhikkhave, pavāritānampi pavāraṇā ṭhapetabbā. Yo ṭhapeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa.

At that time, the monks of the group of six, thinking, “The amiable monks will suspend the invitation for us,” would preemptively suspend the invitation for pure monks who were without offense, groundlessly and without reason; and they would suspend the invitation even for those who had already made it. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, the invitation should not be suspended for pure monks who are without offense, groundlessly and without reason. Whoever should suspend it, there is an offense of wrong-doing. Monks, the invitation should not be suspended even for those who have already made it. Whoever should suspend it, there is an offense of wrong-doing.”

236. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, ṭhapitā hoti pavāraṇā, evaṃ aṭṭhapitā. Kathañca, bhikkhave, aṭṭhapitā hoti pavāraṇā?

Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, aṭṭhapitā hoti pavāraṇā.

236.“Thus, monks, the invitation is suspended, and thus it is not suspended. And how, monks, is the invitation not suspended? If, monks, one suspends the invitation after the three-time invitation has been spoken, uttered, and completed, the invitation is not suspended. If, monks, one suspends the invitation after the two-time invitation… the one-time invitation… the invitation according to seniority has been spoken, uttered, and completed, the invitation is not suspended. Thus, monks, the invitation is not suspended.”

“And how, monks, is the invitation suspended? If, monks, one suspends the invitation when the three-time invitation has been spoken, uttered, but not completed, the invitation is suspended. If, monks, one suspends the invitation when the two-time invitation… the one-time invitation… the invitation according to seniority has been spoken, uttered, but not completed, the invitation is suspended.

Here, monks, on the day of the Pavāraṇā, a monk stops another monk's Pavāraṇā. If other monks know of this monk, 'This venerable one is pure in bodily conduct, pure in verbal conduct, pure in livelihood, discerning, capable, and able to give a reply when questioned,' he should be addressed thus: 'Friend, when you stopped this monk's Pavāraṇā, on what grounds did you stop it? Did you stop it on grounds of transgression of virtue, transgression of conduct, or transgression of view?' If he replies, 'I stopped it on grounds of transgression of virtue, transgression of conduct, or transgression of view,' he should be asked further: 'But do you, venerable one, know what a transgression of virtue is, what a transgression of conduct is, what a transgression of view is?' If he says, 'I know, friend, what a transgression of virtue is, what a transgression of conduct is, what a transgression of view is,' he should be asked: 'What, friend, is a transgression of virtue, what is a transgression of conduct, what is a transgression of view?' If he replies, 'The four pārājikas and the thirteen saṅghādisesas—this is transgression of virtue; the thullaccaya, pācittiya, pāṭidesanīya, dukkaṭa, and dubbhāsita—this is transgression of conduct; wrong view and extreme view—this is transgression of view,' he should then be asked: 'Friend, when you stopped this monk's Pavāraṇā, did you stop it based on what you saw, what you heard, or what you surmised?' If he says, 'I stopped it based on what I saw, what I heard, or what I surmised,' he should be asked: 'Friend, when you stopped this monk's Pavāraṇā based on what you saw, what did you see? How did you see it? When did you see it? Where did you see it? Did you see him committing a pārājika? Did you see him committing a saṅghādisesa? Did you see him committing a thullaccaya, a pācittiya, a pāṭidesanīya, a dukkaṭa, or a dubbhāsita? Where were you, and where was this monk? What were you doing, and what was this monk doing?' If he then says, 'No, friend, I did not stop this monk's Pavāraṇā based on what I saw, but rather based on what I heard,' he should be asked: 'Friend, when you stopped this monk's Pavāraṇā based on what you heard, what did you hear? How did you hear it? When did you hear it? Where did you hear it? Did you hear that he had committed a pārājika? Did you hear that he had committed a saṅghādisesa? Did you hear that he had committed a thullaccaya, a pācittiya, a pāṭidesanīya, a dukkaṭa, or a dubbhāsita? Did you hear it from a monk, a nun, a female trainee, a novice monk, a novice nun, a male lay follower, a female lay follower, kings, royal ministers, sectarians, or disciples of sectarians?' If he then says, 'No, friend, I did not stop this monk's Pavāraṇā based on what I heard, but rather based on surmise,' he should be asked: 'Friend, when you stopped this monk's Pavāraṇā based on surmise, what do you surmise? How do you surmise it? When did you surmise it? Where did you surmise it? Do you surmise that he committed a pārājika? Do you surmise that he committed a saṅghādisesa? Do you surmise that he committed a thullaccaya, a pācittiya, a pāṭidesanīya, a dukkaṭa, or a dubbhāsita? Did you surmise after hearing from a monk, a nun, a female trainee, a novice monk, a novice nun, a male lay follower, a female lay follower, kings, royal ministers, sectarians, or disciples of sectarians?' If he then says, 'No, friend, I did not stop this monk's Pavāraṇā based on surmise, but I myself do not know why I stopped this monk's Pavāraṇā.' Then, monks, if the accusing monk does not satisfy the wise fellow practitioners with his questioning, it is sufficient to say that the accused monk is not to be reproached. But if the accusing monk satisfies the wise fellow practitioners with his questioning, it is sufficient to say that the accused monk is to be reproached. If, monks, the accusing monk admits to having falsely accused another of a pārājika, the Saṅgha should perform Pavāraṇā after imposing a saṅghādisesa on him. If, monks, the accusing monk admits to having falsely accused another of a saṅghādisesa, the Saṅgha should perform Pavāraṇā after dealing with him according to the rule. If, monks, the accusing monk admits to having falsely accused another of a thullaccaya, a pācittiya, a pāṭidesanīya, a dukkaṭa, or a dubbhāsita, the Saṅgha should perform Pavāraṇā after dealing with him according to the rule. If, monks, the accused monk admits to having committed a pārājika, the Saṅgha should perform Pavāraṇā after expelling him. If, monks, the accused monk admits to having committed a saṅghādisesa, the Saṅgha should perform Pavāraṇā after imposing the saṅghādisesa penalty. If, monks, the accused monk admits to having committed a thullaccaya, a pācittiya, a pāṭidesanīya, a dukkaṭa, or a dubbhāsita, the Saṅgha should perform Pavāraṇā after dealing with him according to the rule.

Pavāraṇāṭhapanaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ.

The stopping of the Pavāraṇā is concluded.

If it is opportune for the Saṅgha, let the Saṅgha perform the Pavāraṇā, setting aside the person.’ He should be told: ‘Friend, the Blessed One has prescribed the Pavāraṇā for those who are in concord. If a person is apparent, but not the matter, speak of it now.’

Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu tadahu pavāraṇāya saṅghamajjhe udāhareyya – ‘‘suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Idaṃ vatthu ca puggalo ca paññāyati. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, vatthuñca puggalañca ṭhapetvā saṅgho pavāreyyā’’ti. So evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘bhagavatā kho, āvuso, visuddhānañca samaggānañca pavāraṇā paññattā. Sace vatthu ca puggalo ca paññāyati, idāneva naṃ vadehī’’ti.

Here, bhikkhus, on the Pavāraṇā day, a bhikkhu might declare in the midst of the Saṅgha: ‘Venerable sirs, let the Saṅgha hear me. This matter and this person are apparent. If it is opportune for the Saṅgha, let the Saṅgha perform the Pavāraṇā, setting aside both the matter and the person.’ He should be told: ‘Friend, the Blessed One has prescribed the Pavāraṇā for those who are purified and in concord. If the matter and the person are apparent, speak of them now.’

Pubbe ce, bhikkhave, pavāraṇāya vatthu paññāyati, pacchā puggalo, kallaṃ vacanāya. Pubbe ce, bhikkhave, pavāraṇāya puggalo paññāyati, pacchā vatthu, kallaṃ vacanāya. Pubbe ce, bhikkhave, pavāraṇāya vatthu ca puggalo ca paññāyati, taṃ ce katāya pavāraṇāya ukkoṭeti, ukkoṭanakaṃ pācittiyanti.

Bhikkhus, if, before the Pavāraṇā, a matter is apparent and a person afterwards, it is proper to speak. If, before the Pavāraṇā, a person is apparent and a matter afterwards, it is proper to speak. If, before the Pavāraṇā, both a matter and a person are apparent, and one brings it up after the Pavāraṇā has been performed, it is an offense entailing expiation (pācittiya).

144.The Case of the Quarrelsome Bhikkhus

240. Tena kho pana samayena sambahulā sandiṭṭhā sambhattā bhikkhū kosalesu janapade aññatarasmiṃ āvāse vassaṃ upagacchiṃsu. Tesaṃ sāmantā aññe bhikkhū bhaṇḍanakārakā kalahakārakā vivādakārakā bhassakārakā saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā vassaṃ upagacchiṃsu – mayaṃ tesaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ vassaṃvuṭṭhānaṃ pavāraṇāya pavāraṇaṃ ṭhapessāmāti. Assosuṃ kho te bhikkhū – ‘‘amhākaṃ kira sāmantā aññe bhikkhū bhaṇḍanakārakā kalahakārakā vivādakārakā bhassakārakā saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā vassaṃ upagatā – mayaṃ tesaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ vassaṃvuṭṭhānaṃ pavāraṇāya pavāraṇaṃ ṭhapessāmā’’ti. Kathaṃ nu kho amhehi paṭipajjitabbanti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

240.Now at that time, several bhikkhus who were well-known and intimate entered the rains residence in a certain monastery in the Kosala country. Nearby, other bhikkhus—quarrelsome, contention-makers, dispute-makers, brawlers, creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha—also entered the rains residence, thinking: ‘After these bhikkhus have completed the rains, we will obstruct their Pavāraṇā.’ Those bhikkhus heard: ‘It seems that nearby, other bhikkhus—quarrelsome, contention-makers, dispute-makers, brawlers, creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha—have entered the rains residence, thinking: “After these bhikkhus have completed the rains, we will obstruct their Pavāraṇā.”’ They wondered: ‘How should we proceed?’ They reported the matter to the Blessed One.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, sambahulā sandiṭṭhā sambhattā bhikkhū aññatarasmiṃ āvāse vassaṃ upagacchanti. Tesaṃ sāmantā aññe bhikkhū bhaṇḍanakārakā kalahakārakā vivādakārakā bhassakārakā saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā vassaṃ upagacchanti – mayaṃ tesaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ vassaṃvuṭṭhānaṃ pavāraṇāya pavāraṇaṃ ṭhapessāmāti. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, tehi bhikkhūhi dve tayo uposathe cātuddasike kātuṃ – kathaṃ mayaṃ tehi bhikkhūhi paṭhamataraṃ pavāreyyāmāti. Te ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhū bhaṇḍanakārakā kalahakārakā vivādakārakā bhassakārakā saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā taṃ āvāsaṃ āgacchanti, tehi, bhikkhave, āvāsikehi bhikkhūhi lahuṃ lahuṃ sannipatitvā pavāretabbaṃ, pavāretvā vattabbā – ‘‘pavāritā kho mayaṃ, āvuso; yathāyasmantā maññanti tathā karontū’’ti. Te ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhū bhaṇḍanakārakā kalahakārakā vivādakārakā bhassakārakā saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā asaṃvihitā taṃ āvāsaṃ āgacchanti, tehi, bhikkhave, āvāsikehi bhikkhūhi āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipitabbaṃ, paccuggantvā pattacīvaraṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ, pānīyena paripucchitabbā; tesaṃ vikkhitvā [vikkhipāpetvā (paṭivisodhakānaṃ mati), ācikkhitvā (ka.)] nissīmaṃ gantvā pavāretabbaṃ, pavāretvā vattabbā – ‘‘pavāritā kho mayaṃ, āvuso; yathāyasmantā maññanti tathā karontū’’ti. Evañcetaṃ labhetha, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce labhetha, āvāsikena bhikkhunā byattena paṭibalena āvāsikā bhikkhū ñāpetabbā –

Here, bhikkhus, several bhikkhus who are well-known and intimate enter the rains residence in a certain monastery. Nearby, other bhikkhus—quarrelsome, contention-makers, dispute-makers, brawlers, creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha—also enter the rains residence, thinking: ‘We will obstruct the Pavāraṇā of those bhikkhus after they have completed the rains.’ I allow, bhikkhus, those bhikkhus to hold two or three Uposatha ceremonies on the fourteenth day—thinking: ‘How might we perform the Pavāraṇā before those bhikkhus?’ If those bhikkhus—quarrelsome, contention-makers, dispute-makers, brawlers, creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha—arrive at that monastery, then the resident bhikkhus should quickly assemble and perform the Pavāraṇā. After performing it, they should say: ‘Friends, we have performed the Pavāraṇā; let the venerable ones act as they see fit.’ If those bhikkhus—quarrelsome, contention-makers, dispute-makers, brawlers, creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha—arrive at that monastery while the resident bhikkhus are unprepared, then the resident bhikkhus should prepare seats, set out water for the feet, a footstool, and a foot-wiper, go out to meet them, receive their bowls and robes, and ask them for drinking water. Then, having distracted them, they should go outside the boundary and perform the Pavāraṇā. After performing it, they should say: ‘Friends, we have performed the Pavāraṇā; let the venerable ones act as they see fit.’ If this can be done, that is good. If not, then a competent and capable resident bhikkhu should inform the resident bhikkhus:

‘‘Suṇantu me, āyasmanto [āyasmantā (ka.)], āvāsikā. Yadāyasmantānaṃ pattakallaṃ, idāni uposathaṃ kareyyāma, pātimokkhaṃ uddiseyyāma, āgame kāḷe pavāreyyāmā’’ti. Te ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhū bhaṇḍanakārakā kalahakārakā vivādakārakā bhassakārakā saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā te bhikkhū evaṃ vadeyyuṃ – ‘‘sādhāvuso, idāneva no pavārethā’’ti, te evamassu vacanīyā – ‘‘anissarā kho tumhe, āvuso, amhākaṃ pavāraṇāya; na tāva mayaṃ pavāreyyāmā’’ti. Te ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhū bhaṇḍanakārakā kalahakārakā vivādakārakā bhassakārakā saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā taṃ kāḷaṃ anuvaseyyuṃ, āvāsikena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā byattena paṭibalena āvāsikā bhikkhū ñāpetabbā –

‘Venerable resident bhikkhus, listen to me. If it is opportune for the venerable ones, let us now perform the Uposatha, recite the Pātimokkha, and perform the Pavāraṇā at the approaching dark half of the month.’ If, bhikkhus, those bhikkhus—quarrelsome, contention-makers, dispute-makers, brawlers, creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha—should say to those bhikkhus: ‘Good, friends, let us perform the Pavāraṇā right now,’ they should be told: ‘Friends, you have no authority over our Pavāraṇā; we will not perform it yet.’ If, bhikkhus, those bhikkhus—quarrelsome, contention-makers, dispute-makers, brawlers, creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha—should remain until that dark half of the month, then a competent and capable resident bhikkhu should inform the resident bhikkhus:

‘‘Suṇantu me, āyasmanto, āvāsikā. Yadāyasmantānaṃ pattakallaṃ, idāni uposathaṃ kareyyāma, pātimokkhaṃ uddiseyyāma, āgame juṇhe pavāreyyāmā’’ti. Te ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhū bhaṇḍanakārakā kalahakārakā vivādakārakā bhassakārakā saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā te bhikkhū evaṃ vadeyyuṃ – ‘‘sādhāvuso, idāneva no pavāreyyāthā’’ti, te evamassu vacanīyā – ‘‘anissarā kho tumhe, āvuso, amhākaṃ pavāraṇāya, na tāva mayaṃ pavāreyyāmā’’ti. Te ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhū bhaṇḍanakārakā kalahakārakā vivādakārakā bhassakārakā saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā tampi juṇhaṃ anuvaseyyuṃ, tehi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi sabbeheva āgame juṇhe komudiyā cātumāsiniyā akāmā pavāretabbaṃ.

‘Venerable resident bhikkhus, listen to me. If it is opportune for the venerable ones, let us now perform the Uposatha, recite the Pātimokkha, and perform the Pavāraṇā at the approaching full moon.’ If, bhikkhus, those bhikkhus—quarrelsome, contention-makers, dispute-makers, brawlers, creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha—should say to those bhikkhus: ‘Good, friends, let us perform the Pavāraṇā right now,’ they should be told: ‘Friends, you have no authority over our Pavāraṇā; we will not perform it yet.’ If, bhikkhus, those bhikkhus—quarrelsome, contention-makers, dispute-makers, brawlers, creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha—should remain until that full moon, then all those bhikkhus must unwillingly perform the Pavāraṇā on the approaching full moon, the Komudī, the fourth-month full moon.

Tehi ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi pavāriyamāne gilāno agilānassa pavāraṇaṃ ṭhapeti, so evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘āyasmā kho gilāno. Gilāno ca ananuyogakkhamo vutto bhagavatā. Āgamehi, āvuso, yāva arogo hosi. Arogo ākaṅkhamāno codessasī’’ti. Evañce vuccamāno codeti, anādariye pācittiyaṃ. Tehi ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi pavāriyamāne agilāno gilānassa pavāraṇaṃ ṭhapeti, so evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘ayaṃ kho, āvuso, bhikkhu gilāno. Gilāno ca ananuyogakkhamo vutto bhagavatā.

Tehi ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi pavāriyamāne gilāno gilānassa pavāraṇaṃ ṭhapeti, so evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘āyasmantā kho gilānā. Gilāno ca ananuyogakkhamo vutto bhagavatā. Āgamehi, āvuso, yāva arogā hotha. Arogo arogaṃ ākaṅkhamāno codessasī’’ti [yāva arogo hoti, arogaṃ ākaṅkhamāno codessasīti (ka.)]. Evañce vuccamāno codeti, anādariye pācittiyaṃ. Tehi ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi pavāriyamāne agilāno agilānassa pavāraṇaṃ ṭhapeti, ubho saṅghena samanuyuñjitvā samanugāhitvā [samanubhāsitvā (sī.)] yathādhammaṃ kārāpetvā saṅghena pavāretabbanti.

Monks, if while the monks are performing the Pavāraṇā, a sick monk stops the Pavāraṇā of a healthy one, he should be told: ‘You, venerable one, are sick, and the Blessed One has said that a sick person is unfit for questioning. Wait, friend, until you are well. When you are well, you may then question if you wish.’ If, being spoken to thus, he still questions, it is an offense of disrespect, entailing a pācittiya. Monks, if while the monks are performing the Pavāraṇā, a healthy monk stops the Pavāraṇā of a sick one, he should be told: ‘This monk, friend, is sick, and the Blessed One has said that a sick person is unfit for questioning. Wait, friend, until this monk is well. When he is well, you may then question if you wish.’ If, being spoken to thus, he still questions, it is an offense of disrespect, entailing a pācittiya. Monks, if while the monks are performing the Pavāraṇā, a sick monk stops the Pavāraṇā of another sick one, he should be told: ‘You venerables are sick, and the Blessed One has said that a sick person is unfit for questioning. Wait, friend, until you are well. When you are well, you may question if you wish.’ If, being spoken to thus, he still questions, it is an offense of disrespect, entailing a pācittiya. Monks, if while the monks are performing the Pavāraṇā, a healthy monk stops the Pavāraṇā of another healthy one, both should be questioned and investigated by the Sangha, and having dealt with them according to the Dhamma, the Sangha should then perform the Pavāraṇā.

145.The Section on the Postponement of the Pavāraṇā.

241. Tena kho pana samayena sambahulā sandiṭṭhā sambhattā bhikkhū kosalesu janapade aññatarasmiṃ āvāse vassaṃ upagacchiṃsu. Tesaṃ samaggānaṃ sammodamānānaṃ avivadamānānaṃ viharataṃ aññataro phāsuvihāro adhigato hoti. Atha kho tesaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘amhākaṃ kho samaggānaṃ sammodamānānaṃ avivadamānānaṃ viharataṃ aññataro phāsuvihāro adhigato.

Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

241.Now at that time several monks, intimate friends and companions, had entered the rains residence in a certain dwelling in the Kosala country. While they were living in concord, rejoicing together, without dispute, a certain ease of dwelling was attained. Then it occurred to those monks: “While we were living in concord, rejoicing together, without dispute, a certain ease of dwelling was attained. If we now perform the Pavāraṇā, monks might set out on a wandering tour after the Pavāraṇā. Thus we would be excluded from this ease of dwelling. What should we do now?” They reported the matter to the Blessed One.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, sambahulā sandiṭṭhā sambhattā bhikkhū aññatarasmiṃ āvāse vassaṃ upagacchanti. Tesaṃ samaggānaṃ sammodamānānaṃ avivadamānānaṃ viharataṃ aññataro phāsuvihāro adhigato hoti. Tatra ce bhikkhūnaṃ evaṃ hoti – ‘‘amhākaṃ kho samaggānaṃ sammodamānānaṃ avivadamānānaṃ viharataṃ aññataro phāsuvihāro adhigato.

Evañca pana, bhikkhave, kātabbo. Sabbeheva ekajjhaṃ sannipatitabbaṃ – sannipatitvā byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

Here, monks, if a number of intimate friends and companions enter the rains residence in a certain dwelling, and while they live in concord, rejoicing together, without dispute, they attain a certain ease of dwelling. If it should occur to those monks: ‘While we are living in concord, rejoicing together, without dispute, we have attained a certain ease of dwelling. If we now perform the Pavāraṇā, it is possible that monks, having performed the Pavāraṇā, might set out on a wandering tour. Thus, we would be excluded from this ease of dwelling,’ I allow those monks, monks, to make a postponement of the Pavāraṇā. And this, monks, is how it should be done. All should assemble together in one place—having assembled, a monk who is articulate and competent should inform the Sangha—

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Amhākaṃ samaggānaṃ sammodamānānaṃ avivadamānānaṃ viharataṃ aññataro phāsuvihāro adhigato. Sace mayaṃ idāni pavāressāma, siyāpi bhikkhū pavāretvā cārikaṃ pakkameyyuṃ. Evaṃ mayaṃ imamhā phāsuvihārā paribāhirā bhavissāma. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho pavāraṇāsaṅgahaṃ kareyya, idāni uposathaṃ kareyya, pātimokkhaṃ uddiseyya, āgame juṇhe komudiyā cātumāsiniyā pavāreyya. Esā ñatti.

“Venerable sirs, may the Sangha listen to me. While we have been living in concord, rejoicing together, and without dispute, a certain ease of dwelling has been attained. If we were now to perform the Pavāraṇā, it is possible that monks, having performed the Pavāraṇā, might set out on a wandering tour. Thus, we would be excluded from this ease of dwelling. If it is agreeable to the Sangha, the Sangha may make a postponement of the Pavāraṇā, perform the Uposatha now, recite the Pātimokkha, and perform the Pavāraṇā when the bright season arrives, on the full-moon night of Komudī, in the fourth month. This is the motion.”

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Amhākaṃ samaggānaṃ sammodamānānaṃ avivadamānānaṃ viharataṃ aññataro phāsuvihāro adhigato. Sace mayaṃ idāni pavāressāma, siyāpi bhikkhū pavāretvā cārikaṃ pakkameyyuṃ. Evaṃ mayaṃ imamhā phāsuvihārā paribāhirā bhavissāma. Saṅgho pavāraṇāsaṅgahaṃ karoti, idāni uposathaṃ karissati, pātimokkhaṃ uddisissati, āgame juṇhe komudiyā cātumāsiniyā pavāressati. Yassāyasmato khamati pavāraṇāsaṅgahassa karaṇaṃ, idāni uposathaṃ karissati, pātimokkhaṃ uddisissati, āgame juṇhe komudiyā cātumāsiniyā pavāressati, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“Venerable sirs, may the Sangha listen to me. While we have been living in concord, rejoicing together, and without dispute, a certain ease of dwelling has been attained. If we were now to perform the Pavāraṇā, it is possible that monks, having performed the Pavāraṇā, might set out on a wandering tour. Thus, we would be excluded from this ease of dwelling. The Sangha makes a postponement of the Pavāraṇā, will now perform the Uposatha, recite the Pātimokkha, and will perform the Pavāraṇā when the bright season arrives, on the full-moon night of Komudī, in the fourth month. He to whom the making of the postponement of the Pavāraṇā is agreeable—that now the Uposatha will be performed, the Pātimokkha will be recited, and the Pavāraṇā will be performed when the bright season arrives, on the full-moon night of Komudī, in the fourth month—let him remain silent. He to whom it is not agreeable, let him speak.”

‘‘Kato saṅghena pavāraṇāsaṅgaho, idāni uposathaṃ karissati, pātimokkhaṃ uddisissati, āgame juṇhe komudiyā cātumāsiniyā pavāressati. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

“The Sangha has made the postponement of the Pavāraṇā; it will now perform the Uposatha, recite the Pātimokkha, and will perform the Pavāraṇā when the bright season arrives, on the full-moon night of Komudī, in the fourth month. The Sangha approves of it, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.”

Tehi ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi kate pavāraṇāsaṅgahe aññataro bhikkhu evaṃ vadeyya – ‘‘icchāmahaṃ, āvuso, janapadacārikaṃ pakkamituṃ; atthi me janapade karaṇīya’’nti, so evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘sādhāvuso, pavāretvā gacchāhī’’ti. So ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhu pavārayamāno aññatarassa bhikkhuno pavāraṇaṃ ṭhapeti, so evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘anissaro kho me tvaṃ, āvuso, pavāraṇāya, na tāvāhaṃ pavāressāmī’’ti. Tassa ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno pavārayamānassa aññataro bhikkhu tassa bhikkhuno pavāraṇaṃ ṭhapeti, ubho saṅghena samanuyuñjitvā samanugāhitvā yathādhammaṃ kārāpetabbā. So ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhu janapade taṃ karaṇīyaṃ tīretvā punadeva anto komudiyā cātumāsiniyā taṃ āvāsaṃ āgacchati, tehi ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi pavāriyamāne aññataro bhikkhu tassa bhikkhuno pavāraṇaṃ ṭhapeti, so evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘anissaro kho me tvaṃ, āvuso, pavāraṇāya; pavārito aha’’nti.

“Monks, if after the postponement of the Pavāraṇā has been made by those monks, a certain monk should say: ‘Friends, I wish to set out on a wandering tour in the countryside; I have business in the countryside,’ he should be told: ‘Very well, friend, go after having performed the Pavāraṇā.’ If, monks, that monk, while performing the Pavāraṇā, stops the Pavāraṇā of a certain monk, he should be told: ‘Friend, you have no authority over my Pavāraṇā; I will not yet perform the Pavāraṇā.’ If, monks, while that monk is performing the Pavāraṇā, another monk stops the Pavāraṇā of that monk, both should be questioned and investigated by the Sangha and dealt with according to the Dhamma. If, monks, that monk, having completed his business in the countryside, returns to that dwelling before the full-moon night of Komudī, in the fourth month, and if, monks, while those monks are performing the Pavāraṇā, a certain monk stops the Pavāraṇā of that monk, he should be told: ‘Friend, you have no authority over my Pavāraṇā; I have already performed the Pavāraṇā.’ If, monks, while those monks are performing the Pavāraṇā, that monk stops the Pavāraṇā of a certain monk, both should be questioned and investigated by the Sangha, dealt with according to the Dhamma, and then the Sangha should perform the Pavāraṇā.”
