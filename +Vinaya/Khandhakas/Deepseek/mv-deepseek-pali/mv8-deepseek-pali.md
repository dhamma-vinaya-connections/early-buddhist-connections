202.The Story of Jīvaka

326. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā rājagahe viharati veḷuvane kalandakanivāpe. Tena kho pana samayena vesālī iddhā ceva hoti phitā [phītā (bahūsu)] ca bahujanā ca ākiṇṇamanussā ca subhikkhā ca; satta ca pāsādasahassāni satta ca pāsādasatāni satta ca pāsādā; satta ca kūṭāgārasahassāni satta ca kūṭāgārasatāni satta ca kūṭāgārāni; satta ca ārāmasahassāni satta ca ārāmasatāni satta ca ārāmā; satta ca pokkharaṇīsahassāni satta ca pokkharaṇīsatāni satta ca pokkharaṇiyo; ambapālī ca gaṇikā abhirūpā hoti dassanīyā pāsādikā paramāya vaṇṇapokkharatāya samannāgatā, padakkhiṇā [padakkhā (syā.)] nacce ca gīte ca vādite ca, abhisaṭā atthikānaṃ atthikānaṃ manussānaṃ paññāsāya ca rattiṃ gacchati; tāya ca vesālī bhiyyosomattāya upasobhati. Atha kho rājagahako negamo vesāliṃ agamāsi kenacideva karaṇīyena. Addasā kho rājagahako negamo vesāliṃ iddhañceva phitañca bahujanañca ākiṇṇamanussañca subhikkhañca; satta ca pāsādasahassāni satta ca pāsādasatāni satta ca pāsāde; satta ca kūṭāgārasahassāni satta ca kūṭāgārasatāni satta ca kūṭāgārāni; satta ca ārāmasahassāni satta ca ārāmasatāni satta ca ārāme; satta ca pokkharaṇīsahassāni satta ca pokkharaṇīsatāni satta ca pokkharaṇiyo; ambapāliñca gaṇikaṃ abhirūpaṃ dassanīyaṃ pāsādikaṃ paramāya vaṇṇapokkharatāya samannāgataṃ, padakkhiṇaṃ [padakkhaṃ (syā.)] nacce ca gīte ca vādite ca, abhisaṭaṃ atthikānaṃ atthikānaṃ manussānaṃ paññāsāya ca rattiṃ gacchantiṃ, tāya ca vesāliṃ bhiyyosomattāya upasobhantiṃ.

326.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. Now at that time Vesālī was prosperous, flourishing, populous, crowded with people, and well-supplied with food. There were seven thousand seven hundred and seven mansions, seven thousand seven hundred and seven gabled houses, seven thousand seven hundred and seven parks, and seven thousand seven hundred and seven lotus ponds. And the courtesan Ambapālī was beautiful, lovely, graceful, possessing supreme beauty of complexion, skilled in dancing, singing, and music, sought after by men who desired her, and she charged fifty [kahāpaṇas] per night. Because of her, Vesālī shone even more brilliantly. Then a certain townsman from Rājagaha went to Vesālī on some business. He saw Vesālī as prosperous, flourishing, populous, crowded with people, and well-supplied with food. He saw the seven thousand seven hundred and seven mansions, the seven thousand seven hundred and seven gabled houses, the seven thousand seven hundred and seven parks, and the seven thousand seven hundred and seven lotus ponds. He saw the courtesan Ambapālī—beautiful, lovely, graceful, possessing supreme beauty of complexion, skilled in dancing, singing, and music, sought after by men who desired her, charging fifty [kahāpaṇas] per night—and because of her, Vesālī shone even more brilliantly.

327. Atha kho rājagahako negamo vesāliyaṃ taṃ karaṇīyaṃ tīretvā punadeva rājagahaṃ paccāgañchi. Yena rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā rājānaṃ māgadhaṃ seniyaṃ bimbisāraṃ etadavoca – ‘‘vesālī, deva, iddhā ceva phitā ca bahujanā ca ākiṇṇamanussā ca subhikkhā ca; satta ca pāsādasahassāni…pe… tāya ca vesālī bhiyyosomattāya upasobhati. Sādhu, deva, mayampi gaṇikaṃ vuṭṭhāpessāmā’’ti [vuṭṭhāpeyyāma (ka.)]. ‘‘Tena hi, bhaṇe, tādisiṃ kumāriṃ jānātha yaṃ tumhe gaṇikaṃ vuṭṭhāpeyyāthā’’ti. Tena kho pana samayena rājagahe sālavatī nāma kumārī abhirūpā hoti dassanīyā pāsādikā paramāya vaṇṇapokkharatāya samannāgatā. Atha kho rājagahako negamo sālavatiṃ kumāriṃ gaṇikaṃ vuṭṭhāpesi. Atha kho sālavatī gaṇikā nacirasseva padakkhiṇā ahosi nacce ca gīte ca vādite ca, abhisaṭā atthikānaṃ atthikānaṃ manussānaṃ paṭisatena ca rattiṃ gacchati. Atha kho sālavatī gaṇikā nacirasseva gabbhinī ahosi. Atha kho sālavatiyā gaṇikāya etadahosi – ‘‘itthī kho gabbhinī purisānaṃ amanāpā. Sace maṃ koci jānissati sālavatī gaṇikā gabbhinīti, sabbo me sakkāro bhañjissati [ parihāyissati (sī. syā.)]. Yaṃnūnāhaṃ gilānaṃ paṭivedeyya’’nti. Atha kho sālavatī gaṇikā dovārikaṃ āṇāpesi – ‘‘mā, bhaṇe dovārika, koci puriso pāvisi. Yo ca maṃ pucchati, ‘gilānā’ti paṭivedehī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, ayye’’ti kho so dovāriko sālavatiyā gaṇikāya paccassosi. Atha kho sālavatī gaṇikā tassa gabbhassa paripākamanvāya puttaṃ vijāyi. Atha kho sālavatī gaṇikā dāsiṃ āṇāpesi – ‘‘handa, je, imaṃ dārakaṃ kattarasuppe pakkhipitvā nīharitvā saṅkārakūṭe chaḍḍehī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, ayye’’ti kho sā dāsī sālavatiyā gaṇikāya paṭissutvā taṃ dārakaṃ kattarasuppe pakkhipitvā nīharitvā saṅkārakūṭe chaḍḍesi.

327.Then the townsman from Rājagaha, having completed that business in Vesālī, returned again to Rājagaha. He approached King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and said: “Vesālī, sire, is prosperous, flourishing, populous, crowded with people, and well-supplied with food. There are seven thousand seven hundred and seven mansions… and because of her, Vesālī shines even more brilliantly. Good, sire, let us also establish a courtesan.” “Well then, my good man, find such a maiden whom you could establish as a courtesan.” Now at that time, there was a maiden named Sālavatī in Rājagaha who was beautiful, attractive, lovely, possessing supreme beauty of complexion. Then the townsman from Rājagaha established Sālavatī as a courtesan. Soon, Sālavatī the courtesan became skilled in dancing, singing, and music. She was sought after by men who desired her, and she earned a hundred [kahāpaṇas] a night. Before long, Sālavatī the courtesan became pregnant. Then Sālavatī the courtesan thought: “A pregnant woman is displeasing to men. If anyone finds out that Sālavatī the courtesan is pregnant, all my prestige will be destroyed. Let me pretend to be ill.” So Sālavatī the courtesan instructed the gatekeeper: “Friend gatekeeper, do not let any man enter. If anyone asks for me, tell them I am ill.” “Yes, madam,” replied the gatekeeper to Sālavatī the courtesan. When her pregnancy came to term, Sālavatī the courtesan gave birth to a son. Then she ordered a slave woman: “Come, woman, place this child in an old winnowing basket, take it away, and discard it on the rubbish heap.” “Yes, madam,” replied the slave woman to Sālavatī the courtesan. She placed the child in an old winnowing basket, took it away, and discarded it on the rubbish heap.

328. Tena kho pana samayena abhayo nāma rājakumāro kālasseva rājupaṭṭhānaṃ gacchanto addasa taṃ dārakaṃ kākehi samparikiṇṇaṃ, disvāna manusse pucchi – ‘‘kiṃ etaṃ, bhaṇe, kākehi samparikiṇṇa’’nti? ‘‘Dārako, devā’’ti. ‘‘Jīvati, bhaṇe’’ti? ‘‘Jīvati, devā’’ti. ‘‘Tena hi, bhaṇe, taṃ dārakaṃ amhākaṃ antepuraṃ netvā dhātīnaṃ detha posetu’’nti. ‘‘Evaṃ, devā’’ti kho te manussā abhayassa rājakumārassa paṭissutvā taṃ dārakaṃ abhayassa rājakumārassa antepuraṃ netvā dhātīnaṃ adaṃsu – ‘‘posethā’’ti. Tassa jīvatīti ‘jīvako’ti nāmaṃ akaṃsu. Kumārena posāpitoti ‘komārabhacco’ti nāmaṃ akaṃsu. Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco nacirasseva viññutaṃ pāpuṇi. Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco yena abhayo rājakumāro tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā abhayaṃ rājakumāraṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kā me, deva, mātā, ko pitā’’ti? ‘‘Ahampi kho te, bhaṇe jīvaka, mātaraṃ na jānāmi; api cāhaṃ te pitā; mayāsi [mayāpi (ka.)] posāpito’’ti. Atha kho jīvakassa komārabhaccassa etadahosi – ‘‘imāni kho rājakulāni na sukarāni asippena upajīvituṃ. Yaṃnūnāhaṃ sippaṃ sikkheyya’’nti.

328.At that time, Prince Abhaya, going to the royal audience early in the morning, saw that boy surrounded by crows. Seeing this, he asked the people, “What is this, friends, surrounded by crows?” “A child, lord.” “Is he alive, friends?” “He is alive, lord.” “Then, friends, take that child to our inner palace and give him to the nurses to raise.” “Yes, lord,” those people replied to Prince Abhaya. They took the child to Prince Abhaya’s inner palace and gave him to the nurses, saying, “Raise him.” Because he lived, they named him “Jīvaka.” Because he was raised by the prince, they named him “Komārabhacca.” Before long, Jīvaka Komārabhacca became intelligent. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached Prince Abhaya and said to him, “Who, lord, is my mother? Who is my father?” “I too, friend Jīvaka, do not know your mother. But I am your father; I had you raised.” Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca thought, “These royal families are not easy to live in without a skill. Why don’t I learn a skill?”

329. Tena kho pana samayena takkasilāyaṃ [takkasīlāyaṃ (ka.)] disāpāmokkho vejjo paṭivasati. Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco abhayaṃ rājakumāraṃ anāpucchā yena takkasilā tena pakkāmi. Anupubbena yena takkasilā, yena vejjo tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā taṃ vejjaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘icchāmahaṃ, ācariya, sippaṃ sikkhitu’’nti. ‘‘Tena hi, bhaṇe jīvaka, sikkhassū’’ti. Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco bahuñca gaṇhāti lahuñca gaṇhāti suṭṭhu ca upadhāreti, gahitañcassa na sammussati [na pamussati (sī. syā.)]. Atha kho jīvakassa komārabhaccassa sattannaṃ vassānaṃ accayena etadahosi – ‘‘ahaṃ, kho bahuñca gaṇhāmi lahuñca gaṇhāmi suṭṭhu ca upadhāremi, gahitañca me na sammussati, satta ca me vassāni adhīyantassa, nayimassa sippassa anto paññāyati. Kadā imassa sippassa anto paññāyissatī’’ti. Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco yena so vejjo tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā taṃ vejjaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘ahaṃ kho, ācariya, bahuñca gaṇhāmi lahuñca gaṇhāmi suṭṭhu ca upadhāremi, gahitañca me na sammussati, satta ca me vassāni adhīyantassa, nayimassa sippassa anto paññāyati. Kadā imassa sippassa anto paññāyissatī’’ti? ‘‘Tena hi, bhaṇe jīvaka, khaṇittiṃ ādāya takkasilāya samantā yojanaṃ āhiṇḍitvā yaṃ kiñci abhesajjaṃ passeyyāsi taṃ āharā’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, ācariyā’’ti kho jīvako komārabhacco tassa vejjassa paṭissutvā khaṇittiṃ ādāya takkasilāya samantā yojanaṃ āhiṇḍanto na kiñci abhesajjaṃ addasa. Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco yena so vejjo tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā taṃ vejjaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘āhiṇḍantomhi, ācariya, takkasilāya samantā yojanaṃ, na kiñci [āhiṇṭanto na kiñci (ka.)] abhesajjaṃ addasa’’nti. ‘‘Susikkhitosi, bhaṇe jīvaka. Alaṃ te ettakaṃ jīvikāyā’’ti jīvakassa komārabhaccassa parittaṃ pātheyyaṃ pādāsi. Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco taṃ parittaṃ pātheyyaṃ ādāya yena rājagahaṃ tena pakkāmi. Atha kho jīvakassa komārabhaccassa taṃ parittaṃ pātheyyaṃ antarāmagge sākete parikkhayaṃ agamāsi. Atha kho jīvakassa komārabhaccassa etadahosi – ‘‘ime kho maggā kantārā appodakā appabhakkhā, na sukarā apātheyyena gantuṃ. Yaṃnūnāhaṃ pātheyyaṃ pariyeseyya’’nti.

329.At that time, the renowned physician Disāpāmokkha was residing in Takkasilā. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, without taking leave of Prince Abhaya, set out for Takkasilā. Gradually, he arrived at Takkasilā and approached the physician. Having approached, he said to the physician: “Teacher, I wish to learn the craft.” “Well then, dear Jīvaka, you may learn.” Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca learned much and learned quickly, retained well what he learned, and did not forget what he had learned. After seven years had passed, Jīvaka Komārabhacca thought: “I learn much and learn quickly, retain well what I learn, and do not forget what I have learned. Yet, though I have studied for seven years, the end of this craft is not apparent. When will the end of this craft become apparent?” Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached the physician and said: “Teacher, I learn much and learn quickly, retain well what I learn, and do not forget what I have learned. Yet, though I have studied for seven years, the end of this craft is not apparent. When will the end of this craft become apparent?” “Well then, dear Jīvaka, take a shovel and wander around Takkasilā for a yojana in all directions. Whatever you see that is not medicinal, bring it back.” “Yes, teacher,” replied Jīvaka Komārabhacca to the physician. Taking a shovel, he wandered around Takkasilā for a yojana in all directions but did not see anything that was not medicinal. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached the physician and said: “Teacher, I wandered around Takkasilā for a yojana in all directions but did not see anything that was not medicinal.” “You are well-trained, dear Jīvaka. This much is enough for your livelihood.” He gave Jīvaka Komārabhacca a small provision for the journey. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca took that small provision and set out for Rājagaha. On the way, that small provision ran out at Sāketa. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca thought: “These roads are desolate, with little water and little food. It is not easy to travel without provisions. Let me seek some provisions.”

Jīvakavatthu niṭṭhitaṃ.

The Story of Jīvaka is concluded.

203.The Story of the Treasurer's Wife

330. Tena kho pana samayena sākete seṭṭhibhariyāya sattavassiko sīsābādho hoti. Bahū mahantā mahantā disāpāmokkhā vejjā āgantvā nāsakkhiṃsu arogaṃ kātuṃ. Bahuṃ hiraññaṃ ādāya agamaṃsu.

Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco yena seṭṭhissa gahapatissa nivesanaṃ tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā dovārikaṃ āṇāpesi – ‘‘gaccha, bhaṇe dovārika, seṭṭhibhariyāya pāvada – ‘vejjo, ayye, āgato, so taṃ daṭṭhukāmo’’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, ācariyā’’ti kho so dovāriko jīvakassa komārabhaccassa paṭissutvā yena seṭṭhibhariyā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā seṭṭhibhariyaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘vejjo, ayye, āgato; so taṃ daṭṭhukāmo’’ti. ‘‘Kīdiso, bhaṇe dovārika, vejjo’’ti? ‘‘Daharako, ayye’’ti. ‘‘Alaṃ, bhaṇe dovārika, kiṃ me daharako vejjo karissati?

Atha kho so dovāriko yena jīvako komārabhacco tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā jīvakaṃ komārabhaccaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘seṭṭhibhariyā, ācariya, evamāha – ‘alaṃ, bhaṇe dovārika, kiṃ me daharako vejjo karissati? Bahū mahantā mahantā disāpāmokkhā vejjā āgantvā nāsakkhiṃsu arogaṃ kātuṃ.

330.At that time, the treasurer's wife in Sāketa had been suffering from a headache for seven years. Many great and renowned physicians from various regions came but were unable to cure her. They took much gold and left. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca entered Sāketa and asked the people, "Who is sick, friends? Whom shall I treat?" "The treasurer's wife, teacher, has had a headache for seven years. Go, teacher, and treat the treasurer's wife." Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached the house of the treasurer householder and instructed the gatekeeper, "Go, friend gatekeeper, and inform the treasurer's wife: 'A physician, madam, has come. He wishes to see you.'" "Yes, teacher," replied the gatekeeper. He went to the treasurer's wife and said, "A physician, madam, has come. He wishes to see you." "What kind of physician, friend gatekeeper?" she asked. "A young one, madam." "Enough, friend gatekeeper. What can a young physician do for me? Many great and renowned physicians from various regions came but were unable to cure me. They took much gold and left." Then the gatekeeper returned to Jīvaka Komārabhacca and said, "The treasurer's wife, teacher, says: 'Enough, friend gatekeeper. What can a young physician do for me? Many great and renowned physicians from various regions came but were unable to cure me. They took much gold and left.'" "Go, friend gatekeeper, and tell the treasurer's wife: 'The physician, madam, says: Do not give anything in advance. Only when you are cured, give whatever you wish.'" "Yes, teacher," replied the gatekeeper. He went to the treasurer's wife and said, "The physician, madam, says: 'Do not give anything in advance. Only when you are cured, give whatever you wish.'" "Well then, friend gatekeeper, let the physician come." "Yes, madam," replied the gatekeeper. He returned to Jīvaka Komārabhacca and said, "The treasurer's wife, teacher, summons you."

Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco yena seṭṭhibhariyā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā seṭṭhibhariyāya vikāraṃ sallakkhetvā seṭṭhibhariyaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘pasatena, ayye, sappinā attho’’ti. Atha kho seṭṭhibhariyā jīvakassa komārabhaccassa pasataṃ sappiṃ dāpesi. Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco taṃ pasataṃ sappiṃ nānābhesajjehi nippacitvā seṭṭhibhariyaṃ mañcake uttānaṃ nipātetvā [nipajjāpetvā (sī. syā.)] natthuto adāsi. Atha kho taṃ sappiṃ natthuto dinnaṃ mukhato uggañchi. Atha kho seṭṭhibhariyā paṭiggahe niṭṭhubhitvā dāsiṃ āṇāpesi – ‘‘handa, je, imaṃ sappiṃ picunā gaṇhāhī’’ti. Atha kho jīvakassa komārabhaccassa etadahosi – ‘‘acchariyaṃ [acchariyaṃ vata bho (syā.)] yāva lūkhāyaṃ gharaṇī, yatra hi nāma imaṃ chaḍḍanīyadhammaṃ sappiṃ picunā gāhāpessati. Bahukāni ca me mahagghāni [mahagghāni mahagghāni (sī. syā.)] bhesajjāni upagatāni. Kimpi māyaṃ kiñci [kañci (syā.)] deyyadhammaṃ dassatī’’ti. Atha kho seṭṭhibhariyā jīvakassa komārabhaccassa vikāraṃ sallakkhetvā jīvakaṃ komārabhaccaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kissa tvaṃ, ācariya, vimanosī’’ti? Idha me etadahosi – ‘‘acchariyaṃ yāva lūkhāyaṃ dharaṇī, yatra hi nāma imaṃ chaḍḍanīyadhammaṃ sappiṃ picunā gāhāpessati. Bahukāni ca me mahagghāni sajjāni upagatāni. Kimpi māyaṃ kiñci deyyadhammaṃ dassatī’’ti. ‘‘Mayaṃ kho, ācariya, āgārikā nāma upajānāmetassa saṃyamassa. Varametaṃ sappi dāsānaṃ vā kammakarānaṃ vā pādabbhañjanaṃ vā padīpakaraṇe vā āsittaṃ.

Atha kho seṭṭhibhariyā arogā samānā jīvakassa komārabhaccassa cattāri sahassāni pādāsi. Putto – mātā me arogā ṭhitāti cattāri sahassāni pādāsi.

Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached the treasurer’s wife, and having observed her condition, he said to her: “Madam, you need a pasata of ghee.” Then the treasurer’s wife had a pasata of ghee given to Jīvaka Komārabhacca. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca boiled that pasata of ghee with various medicines, laid the treasurer’s wife on her back on a couch, and administered it through her nose. When the ghee was given through her nose, it came out through her mouth. Then the treasurer’s wife, upon receiving it, spat it out and ordered a female servant: “Here, girl, take this ghee with a rag.” Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca thought: “How stingy this householder’s wife is, that she would even have this discarded ghee taken with a rag! And many expensive medicines have been used. I wonder if she will give me anything at all that is fitting to be given.” Then the treasurer’s wife, noticing Jīvaka Komārabhacca’s displeasure, said to him: “Why, teacher, are you unhappy?” "I thought: ‘How stingy this householder’s wife is, that she would even have this discarded ghee taken with a rag! And many expensive medicines have been used. I wonder if she will give me anything at all that is fitting to be given.’” “We, teacher, as householders, understand the benefit of this treatment. It would be better for this ghee to be poured as foot ointment for the servants or laborers, or for use in lamps. Do not be unhappy, teacher. Your due reward will not be diminished.” Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca cured the treasurer’s wife’s seven-year headache with just that one nasal treatment. When the treasurer’s wife had recovered, she gave Jīvaka Komārabhacca four thousand kahāpaṇas. Her son gave four thousand kahāpaṇas, thinking: “My mother has recovered.” Her daughter-in-law gave four thousand kahāpaṇas, thinking: “My mother-in-law has recovered.” The treasurer householder gave four thousand kahāpaṇas, thinking: “My wife has recovered,” along with a male slave, a female slave, and a chariot with horses.

Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco tāni soḷasasahassāni ādāya dāsañca dāsiñca assarathañca yena rājagahaṃ tena pakkāmi. Anupubbena yena rājagahaṃ yena abhayo rājakumāro tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā abhayaṃ rājakumāraṃ etadavoca – ‘‘idaṃ me, deva, paṭhamakammaṃ soḷasasahassāni dāso ca dāsī ca assaratho ca. Paṭiggaṇhātu me devo posāvanika’’nti. ‘‘Alaṃ, bhaṇe jīvaka; tuyhameva hotu. Amhākaññeva antepure nivesanaṃ māpehī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, devā’’ti kho jīvako komārabhacco abhayassa rājakumārassa paṭissutvā abhayassa rājakumārassa antepure nivesanaṃ māpesi.

Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, taking those sixteen thousand kahāpaṇas, a male slave, a female slave, and a chariot, set out for Rājagaha. In due course, he arrived at Rājagaha and approached Prince Abhaya. Having approached, he said to Prince Abhaya: "This, your majesty, is my first earning—sixteen thousand kahāpaṇas, a male slave, a female slave, and a chariot. May your majesty accept it as a gift for your support." "Enough, Jīvaka; let it be yours. Rather, have a dwelling built for us in the inner palace." "Very well, your majesty," replied Jīvaka Komārabhacca to Prince Abhaya, and he had a dwelling built for Prince Abhaya in the inner palace.

Seṭṭhibhariyāvatthu niṭṭhitaṃ.

The story of the treasurer's wife is concluded.

331.Now at that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha had a fistula ailment. His robes were stained with blood. The queens, seeing this, mocked him: "The king is now in his season, the king's flower has bloomed, soon the king will give birth." The king was embarrassed by this. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha addressed Prince Abhaya: "My dear Abhaya, I have such an illness—my robes are stained with blood. The queens, seeing me, mock me: 'The king is now in his season, the king's flower has bloomed, soon the king will give birth.' Please, my dear Abhaya, find a physician who can treat me." "Your Majesty, our physician Jīvaka is young and skilled. He will treat you." "Then, my dear Abhaya, order the physician Jīvaka to come; he will treat me." Then Prince Abhaya ordered Jīvaka Komārabhacca: "Go, dear Jīvaka, treat the king." "Yes, Your Majesty," replied Jīvaka Komārabhacca to Prince Abhaya. Taking medicine on his fingernail, he approached King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha. Upon arriving, he said to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha: "Your Majesty, may I examine your ailment?" Then, with a single application, Jīvaka Komārabhacca cured King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha of his fistula ailment. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, now healthy, had five hundred women adorned with all their ornaments, then had them remove their ornaments and pile them up. He then said to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: "Dear Jīvaka, let all these ornaments of the five hundred women be yours." "Enough, Your Majesty. May the king remember my service." "Then, dear Jīvaka, attend to me, the women's quarters, and the community of monks headed by the Buddha." "Yes, Your Majesty," replied Jīvaka Komārabhacca to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha.

Atha kho rājagahako negamo yena rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā rājānaṃ māgadhaṃ seniyaṃ bimbisāraṃ etadavoca – ‘‘ayaṃ, deva, seṭṭhi gahapati bahūpakāro devassa ceva negamassa ca; api ca, vejjehi paccakkhāto.

Sādhu devo jīvakaṃ vejjaṃ āṇāpetu seṭṭhiṃ gahapatiṃ tikicchitu’’nti.

332.Now at that time, the chief merchant of Rājagaha had a headache for seven years. Many great, well-known physicians came from various regions but could not cure him. They took much gold and left. Yet, he was given up by the physicians. Some physicians said: "On the fifth day, the merchant householder will die." Others said: "On the seventh day, the merchant householder will die." Then the chief citizen of Rājagaha thought: "This merchant householder is very beneficial to both the king and the city. Yet, he has been given up by the physicians. Some say he will die on the fifth day, others on the seventh. And this king’s physician, Jīvaka, is young and capable. Why don’t we request King to ask Jīvaka to treat the merchant householder?" So the chief citizen of Rājagaha approached King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and said: "Your Majesty, this merchant householder is very beneficial to you and the city. Yet, he has been given up by the physicians. Some say he will die on the fifth day, others on the seventh. May Your Majesty kindly command the physician Jīvaka to treat the merchant householder."

Atha kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro jīvakaṃ komārabhaccaṃ āṇāpesi – ‘‘gaccha, bhaṇe jīvaka, seṭṭhiṃ gahapatiṃ tikicchāhī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, devā’’ti kho jīvako komārabhacco rañño māgadhassa seniyassa bimbisārassa paṭissutvā yena seṭṭhi gahapati tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā seṭṭhissa gahapatissa vikāraṃ sallakkhetvā seṭṭhiṃ gahapatiṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sace tvaṃ, gahapati, arogo bhaveyyāsi [sacāhaṃ taṃ gahapati arogāpeyyaṃ (sī.), sacāhaṃ taṃ gahapati arogaṃ kareyyaṃ (syā.)] kiṃ me assa deyyadhammo’’ti? ‘‘Sabbaṃ sāpateyyañca te, ācariya, hotu, ahañca te dāso’’ti. ‘‘Sakkhissasi pana tvaṃ, gahapati, ekena passena sattamāse nipajjitu’’nti? ‘‘Sakkomahaṃ, ācariya, ekena passena sattamāse nipajjitu’’nti. ‘‘Sakkhissasi pana tvaṃ, gahapati, dutiyena passena sattamāse nipajjitu’’nti? ‘‘Sakkomahaṃ, ācariya, dutiyena passena sattamāse nipajjitu’’nti. ‘‘Sakkhissasi pana tvaṃ, gahapati, uttāno sattamāse nipajjitu’’nti? ‘‘Sakkomahaṃ, ācariya, uttāno sattamāse nipajjitu’’nti.

Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha ordered Jīvaka Komārabhacca: "Go, dear Jīvaka, and treat the merchant householder." "Yes, Your Majesty," replied Jīvaka Komārabhacca to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha. He then approached the merchant householder. Having approached, he observed the merchant householder's condition and said to him: "If you were to recover, householder, what would be my rightful payment?" "All my property would be yours, teacher, and I would be your slave." "But would you be able, householder, to lie on one side for seven months?" "I could, teacher, lie on one side for seven months." "Would you be able, householder, to lie on the other side for seven months?" "I could, teacher, lie on the other side for seven months." "Would you be able, householder, to lie on your back for seven months?" "I could, teacher, lie on my back for seven months."

Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca laid the merchant householder on a couch, fastened him to the couch, cut open the scalp, moved aside the scalp-skin, extracted two worms, and showed them to the crowd: "See, sirs, these two worms—one small, one large. Those teachers who said, 'The merchant householder will die on the fifth day,'—this large worm was seen by them. On the fifth day, the merchant householder’s brain will be consumed. When the brain is consumed, the merchant householder will die. It was well seen by those teachers. Those teachers who said, 'The merchant householder will die on the seventh day,'—this small worm was seen by them. On the seventh day, the merchant householder’s brain will be consumed. When the brain is consumed, the merchant householder will die. It was well seen by those teachers." He then carefully replaced the scalp-skin, stitched up the scalp, and applied a salve. After seven days, the merchant householder said to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: "Teacher, I cannot lie on one side for seven months." "Didn’t you promise me, householder, saying, 'I can lie on one side for seven months'?" "It’s true, teacher, I promised, but I will die; I just can’t lie on one side for seven months." "Then, householder, lie on the other side for seven months." After another seven days, the merchant householder said: "Teacher, I cannot lie on the other side for seven months." "Didn’t you promise me, householder, saying, 'I can lie on the other side for seven months'?" "It’s true, teacher, I promised, but I will die; I just can’t lie on the other side for seven months." "Then, householder, lie on your back for seven months." After another seven days, the merchant householder said: "Teacher, I cannot lie on my back for seven months." "Didn’t you promise me, householder, saying, 'I can lie on my back for seven months'?" "It’s true, teacher, I promised, but I will die; I just can’t lie on my back for seven months." "If I hadn’t told you, householder, you wouldn’t have lain even this much. But I knew beforehand: 'In three weeks, the merchant householder will be well.' Get up, householder, you are well. Do you know what is due to me?" "All my property and wealth is yours, teacher, and I am your slave." "Enough, householder, don’t give me all your property and wealth, and don’t be my slave. Give the king a hundred thousand, and give me a hundred thousand." Then the merchant householder, now well, gave the king a hundred thousand and gave Jīvaka Komārabhacca a hundred thousand.

206.The Story of the Wealthy Man's Son

333.Now at that time, the son of a wealthy merchant from Bārāṇasī, while playing with a toy cart, suffered from an intestinal obstruction, due to which even the gruel he drank did not properly digest, the food he ate did not properly digest, and his stools and urine were not regular. Because of this, he became thin, rough-skinned, discolored, yellowish-pale, with veins stretched across his body. Then the wealthy merchant from Bārāṇasī thought: “My son has such an illness that even the gruel he drinks does not properly digest, the food he eats does not properly digest, and his stools and urine are not regular. Because of this, he has become thin, rough-skinned, discolored, yellowish-pale, with veins stretched across his body. What if I were to go to Rājagaha and request King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha to command Jīvaka, the physician, to treat my son?” Then the wealthy merchant from Bārāṇasī went to Rājagaha and approached King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha. Having approached, he said to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha: “Sire, my son has such an illness that even the gruel he drinks does not properly digest, the food he eats does not properly digest, and his stools and urine are not regular. Because of this, he has become thin, rough-skinned, discolored, yellowish-pale, with veins stretched across his body. It would be good, sire, if you were to command Jīvaka, the physician, to treat my son.”

Atha kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro jīvakaṃ komārabhaccaṃ āṇāpesi – ‘‘gaccha, bhaṇe jīvaka, bārāṇasiṃ gantvā bārāṇaseyyakaṃ seṭṭhiputtaṃ tikicchāhī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, devā’’ti kho jīvako komārabhacco rañño māgadhassa seniyassa bimbisārassa paṭissutvā bārāṇasiṃ gantvā yena bārāṇaseyyako seṭṭhiputto tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bārāṇaseyyakassa seṭṭhiputtassa vikāraṃ sallakkhetvā janaṃ ussāretvā tirokaraṇiyaṃ parikkhipitvā thambhe ubbandhitvā [upanibandhitvā (sī. syā.)] bhariyaṃ purato ṭhapetvā udaracchaviṃ uppāṭetvā antagaṇṭhiṃ nīharitvā bhariyāya dassesi – ‘‘passa te sāmikassa ābādhaṃ, iminā yāgupi pītā na sammā pariṇāmaṃ gacchati, bhattampi bhuttaṃ na sammā pariṇāmaṃ gacchati, uccāropi passāvopi na paguṇo; imināyaṃ kiso lūkho dubbaṇṇo uppaṇḍuppaṇḍukajāto dhamanisanthatagatto’’ti.

Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha commanded Jīvaka Komārabhacca: “Go, dear Jīvaka, go to Bārāṇasī and treat the son of the wealthy merchant of Bārāṇasī.” “Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Jīvaka Komārabhacca to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha. Having consented, he went to Bārāṇasī and approached the son of the wealthy merchant of Bārāṇasī. Having approached, he examined the condition of the merchant’s son, cleared the people away, surrounded the area with a screen, tied him to a post, placed his wife in front, cut open the abdominal skin, removed the intestinal obstruction, and showed it to his wife: “See, this is your husband’s illness. Because of this, even the gruel he drinks does not digest properly, the food he eats does not digest properly, and his stools and urine are not regular. Because of this, he is thin, rough-skinned, discolored, yellowish-pale, with veins stretched across his body.” Having untwisted the intestinal obstruction, and restored the intestines, he stitched up the abdominal skin and applied a salve. Before long, the son of the wealthy merchant of Bārāṇasī was well again. Then the wealthy merchant of Bārāṇasī, thinking, “My son is now well,” gave Jīvaka Komārabhacca sixteen thousand coins. Having taken the sixteen thousand coins, Jīvaka Komārabhacca returned to Rājagaha.

334.Now at that time, King Pajjota was afflicted with jaundice. Many great, well-known physicians came from various regions, but were unable to cure him. They took much gold and departed. Then King Pajjota sent a messenger to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, saying, “I have such an illness. It would be good if the lord were to send Jīvaka, the physician; he will treat me.” Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha commanded Jīvaka Komārabhacca, saying, “Go, Jīvaka, travel to Ujjeni and treat King Pajjota.” “Yes, lord,” replied Jīvaka Komārabhacca, consenting to King Seniya Bimbisāra’s request. He went to Ujjeni and approached King Pajjota. After observing the king’s condition, he said to him, “Give me ghee, lord. I will prepare it, and you shall drink it.” “Enough, Jīvaka, do what you can to cure me without ghee. Ghee is loathsome to me; it is repulsive.” Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca thought, “This king has such an illness that it cannot be cured without ghee. What if I were to prepare ghee with an astringent color, astringent smell, and astringent taste?” So Jīvaka Komārabhacca prepared ghee with various medicines, giving it an astringent color, astringent smell, and astringent taste. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca thought, “After drinking this ghee, when the king digests it, it will cause him to vomit. This king is fierce—he might even have me killed. What if I were to take my leave beforehand?” So Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached King Pajjota and said, “We physicians, lord, extract roots and collect medicines at an auspicious moment. It would be good if the lord were to issue orders at the vehicle houses and gates: ‘Let Jīvaka go by whatever vehicle he wishes, go out by whatever gate he wishes, depart at whatever time he wishes, and enter at whatever time he wishes.’” Then King Pajjota issued orders at the vehicle houses and gates: “Let Jīvaka go by whatever vehicle he wishes, go out by whatever gate he wishes, depart at whatever time he wishes, and enter at whatever time he wishes.”

Tena kho pana samayena rañño pajjotassa bhaddavatikā nāma hatthinikā paññāsayojanikā hoti. Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco rañño pajjotassa sappiṃ [taṃ sappiṃ (syā.)] upanāmesi – ‘‘kasāvaṃ devo pivatū’’ti. Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco rājānaṃ pajjotaṃ sappiṃ pāyetvā hatthisālaṃ gantvā bhaddavatikāya hatthinikāya nagaramhā nippati.

At that time, King Pajjota had a she-elephant named Bhaddavatika, which was able to travel fifty yojanas. Then, Jīvaka Komārabhacca offered ghee to King Pajjota, saying, “May the king drink this astringent.” After giving the ghee to King Pajjota, Jīvaka Komārabhacca went to the elephant stable and made the she-elephant Bhaddavatika depart from the city.

Atha kho rañño pajjotassa taṃ sappi pītaṃ pariṇāmentaṃ uddekaṃ adāsi. Atha kho rājā pajjoto manusse etadavoca – ‘‘duṭṭhena, bhaṇe, jīvakena sappiṃ pāyitomhi. Tena hi, bhaṇe, jīvakaṃ vejjaṃ vicinathā’’ti. ‘‘Bhaddavatikāya, deva, hatthinikāya nagaramhā nippatito’’ti. Tena kho pana samayena rañño pajjotassa kāko nāma dāso saṭṭhiyojaniko hoti, amanussena paṭicca jāto. Atha kho rājā pajjoto kākaṃ dāsaṃ āṇāpesi – ‘‘gaccha, bhaṇe kāka, jīvakaṃ vejjaṃ nivattehi – rājā taṃ, ācariya, nivattāpetīti. Ete kho, bhaṇe kāka, vejjā nāma bahumāyā. Mā cassa kiñci paṭiggahesī’’ti.

Then, as the ghee King Pajjota had drunk was being digested, it caused him to vomit. Then King Pajjota said to his men, “Friends, I have been made to drink ghee by the wicked Jīvaka. Therefore, friends, seek out Jīvaka, the physician.” “Lord, he has departed from the city by the she-elephant Bhaddavatika.” Now at that time King Pajjota had a slave named Kāka, who could travel sixty yojanas, born as a result of a non-human being. Then King Pajjota commanded the slave Kāka, “Go, friend Kāka, and bring back Jīvaka, the physician, saying, ‘Teacher, the king is having you brought back.’ These physicians, friend Kāka, are very crafty. Do not accept anything from him.”

Atha kho kāko dāso jīvakaṃ komārabhaccaṃ antarāmagge kosambiyaṃ sambhāvesi

Then the slave Kāka encountered Jīvaka Komārabhacca on the road to Kosambī.

Pātarāsaṃ karontaṃ. Atha kho kāko dāso jīvakaṃ komārabhaccaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘rājā taṃ, ācariya, nivattāpetī’’ti. ‘‘Āgamehi, bhaṇe kāka, yāva bhuñjāma [bhuñjāmi (sī. syā.)]. Handa, bhaṇe kāka, bhuñjassū’’ti. ‘‘Alaṃ, ācariya, raññāmhi āṇatto – ete kho, bhaṇe kāka, vejjā nāma bahumāyā, mā cassa kiñci paṭiggahesī’’ti. Tena kho pana samayena jīvako komārabhacco nakhena bhesajjaṃ olumpetvā āmalakañca khādati pānīyañca pivati. Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco kākaṃ dāsaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘handa, bhaṇe kāka, āmalakañca khāda pānīyañca pivassū’’ti. Atha kho kāko dāso – ayaṃ kho vejjo āmalakañca khādati pānīyañca pivati, na arahati kiñci pāpakaṃ hotunti – upaḍḍhāmalakañca khādi pānīyañca apāyi. Tassa taṃ upaḍḍhāmalakaṃ khāditaṃ tattheva nicchāresi. Atha kho kāko dāso jīvakaṃ komārabhaccaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘atthi me, ācariya, jīvita’’nti? ‘‘Mā, bhaṇe kāka, bhāyi, tvaṃ ceva arogo bhavissasi rājā ca. Caṇḍo so rājā ghātāpeyyāpi maṃ, tenāhaṃ na nivattāmī’’ti bhaddavatikaṃ hatthinikaṃ kākassa niyyādetvā yena rājagahaṃ tena pakkāmi. Anupubbena yena rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā rañño māgadhassa seniyassa bimbisārassa etamatthaṃ ārocesi. ‘‘Suṭṭhu, bhaṇe jīvaka, akāsi yampi na nivatto, caṇḍo so rājā ghātāpeyyāpi ta’’nti.

While Jīvaka was having his morning meal, the slave Kāka spoke to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: “Master, the king is recalling you.” “Wait, dear Kāka, until we finish eating. Come, dear Kāka, eat!” “Enough, master, I am under the king’s orders—these physicians, dear Kāka, are very deceitful; do not accept anything from him.” At that time, Jīvaka Komārabhacca placed medicine with his fingernail and was eating an āmalaka fruit and drinking water. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca said to the slave Kāka: “Come, dear Kāka, eat an āmalaka and drink some water.” Then the slave Kāka thought: “This physician eats an āmalaka and drinks water; surely nothing harmful can come of it.” So he ate half an āmalaka and drank some water. After eating that half āmalaka, he purged it right there. Then the slave Kāka said to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: “Master, will I live?” “Do not fear, dear Kāka, you will be well, and so will the king. That king is fierce—he might even have me killed, that’s why I will not turn back.” Having entrusted the she-elephant Bhaddavatika to Kāka, he set out for Rājagaha. Gradually, he approached King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha; having approached, he informed King Seniya Bimbisāra of the matter. “Well done, dear Jīvaka, for not turning back—that king is fierce and might have had you killed.” Then, when King Pajjota had recovered, he sent a messenger to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: “Let Jīvaka come; I will grant a boon.” “Enough, sir, may the king remember my services.”

208.The Story of the Siveyyaka Cloth Pair

335. Tena kho pana samayena rañño pajjotassa siveyyakaṃ dussayugaṃ uppannaṃ hoti – bahūnaṃ [bahunnaṃ (sī. syā.)] dussānaṃ bahūnaṃ dussayugānaṃ bahūnaṃ dussayugasatānaṃ bahūnaṃ dussayugasahassānaṃ bahūnaṃ dussayugasatasahassānaṃ aggañca seṭṭhañca mokkhañca uttamañca pavarañca.

335.Now on that occasion, a pair of Siveyyaka cloths had come into being for King Pajjota—the foremost, finest, choicest, supreme, and most excellent of many cloths, many pairs of cloths, hundreds of pairs of cloths, thousands of pairs of cloths, and hundreds of thousands of pairs of cloths. Then King Pajjota sent that pair of Siveyyaka cloths to Jīvaka Komārabhacca. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca thought: "This pair of Siveyyaka cloths has been sent to me by King Pajjota—the foremost, finest, choicest, supreme, and most excellent of many cloths, many pairs of cloths, hundreds of pairs of cloths, thousands of pairs of cloths, and hundreds of thousands of pairs of cloths. No one else is fit to receive this except the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, or King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha."

Evaṃ bhagavato samattiṃsāya virecanaṃ bhavissatī’’ti.

336.Now on that occasion, the Blessed One’s body was afflicted by humors. Then the Blessed One addressed Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, the Tathāgata’s body is afflicted by humors. The Tathāgata wishes to take a purgative.” Then Venerable Ānanda approached Jīvaka Komārabhacca; having approached, he said to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: “Friend Jīvaka, the Tathāgata’s body is afflicted by humors. The Tathāgata wishes to take a purgative.” “Then, Venerable Ānanda, treat the Blessed One’s body with oil for a few days.” Then Venerable Ānanda treated the Blessed One’s body with oil for a few days and approached Jīvaka Komārabhacca; having approached, he said to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: “Friend Jīvaka, the Tathāgata’s body is well-treated with oil. Now you may do what you deem appropriate.” Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca thought: “It is not proper for me to give the Blessed One a strong purgative.” He imbued three lotus stalks with various medicines, approached the Blessed One, and offered the first lotus stalk to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, let the Blessed One first inhale this lotus stalk. This will purge the Blessed One ten times.” He offered the second lotus stalk to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, let the Blessed One inhale this second lotus stalk. This will purge the Blessed One ten times.” He offered the third lotus stalk to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, let the Blessed One inhale this third lotus stalk. This will purge the Blessed One ten times.” Thus, the Blessed One would have thirty acts of purging. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, having given the Blessed One thirty acts of purging, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed. As Jīvaka Komārabhacca left the outer gatehouse, he thought: “I have given the Blessed One thirty acts of purging. The Tathāgata’s body is afflicted by humors. The Blessed One will not be purged thirty times, but twenty-nine times. However, the Blessed One will bathe after being purged. After bathing, the Blessed One will be purged once more. Thus, the Blessed One will have thirty acts of purging.”

Atha kho bhagavā jīvakassa komārabhaccassa cetasā cetoparivitakkamaññāya āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ āmantesi – ‘‘idhānanda, jīvakassa komārabhaccassa bahi dvārakoṭṭhakā nikkhantassa etadahosi – ‘mayā kho bhagavato samattiṃsāya virecanaṃ dinnaṃ.

Then the Blessed One, knowing with his mind the thought in Jīvaka Komārabhacca’s mind, addressed Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, just now as Jīvaka Komārabhacca was leaving the outer gatehouse, this thought occurred to him: ‘I have given the Blessed One a purgative for thirty purges. The Tathāgata’s body is afflicted with humors. The Blessed One will not purge thirty times, but twenty-nine times. However, the Blessed One will bathe after being purged. After bathing, the Blessed One will purge once more. Thus the Blessed One will have a total of thirty purges.’ Therefore, Ānanda, prepare hot water.” “Yes, Venerable Sir,” Venerable Ānanda replied to the Blessed One and prepared hot water.

Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi.

Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, Jīvaka Komārabhacca said to the Blessed One: “Venerable Sir, is the Blessed One relieved?” “I am relieved, Jīvaka.” “Venerable Sir, just now as I was leaving the outer gatehouse, this thought occurred to me: ‘I have given the Blessed One a purgative for thirty purges. The Tathāgata’s body is afflicted with humors. The Blessed One will not purge thirty times, but twenty-nine times. However, the Blessed One will bathe after being relieved. After bathing, the Blessed One will purge once more. Thus the Blessed One will have purged thirty times.’ Venerable Sir, may the Blessed One bathe, may the Sugata bathe.” Then the Blessed One bathed in hot water. After bathing, the Blessed One purged once more. Thus the Blessed One had purged thirty times. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca said to the Blessed One: “Venerable Sir, until the Blessed One’s body returns to its normal state, almsfood with gruel will suffice.”

337.Then, before long, the Blessed One’s body became perfectly well. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca took that pair of Sīvī cloth and approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, Jīvaka Komārabhacca said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, I ask a favor of the Blessed One.” “Jīvaka, the Tathāgatas are past granting favors.” “But, venerable sir, [I ask for] what is allowable and blameless.” “Speak, Jīvaka.” “Venerable sir, the Blessed One is a rag-robe wearer, and so is the community of monks. Venerable sir, this pair of Sīvī cloth was sent by King Pajjota—the foremost, the best, the choicest, the supreme, the most excellent of many cloths, many pairs of cloth, many hundreds of pairs of cloth, many thousands of pairs of cloth, many hundreds of thousands of pairs of cloth. Venerable sir, may the Blessed One accept this pair of Sīvī cloth from me, and may he allow robes received from householders for the community of monks.” The Blessed One accepted the pair of Sīvī cloth. Then the Blessed One instructed, roused, inspired, and gladdened Jīvaka Komārabhacca with a Dhamma talk. Having been instructed, roused, inspired, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk, Jīvaka Komārabhacca rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed. Then, on this occasion, in this connection, having given a Dhamma talk, the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow robes received from householders. Whoever wishes may be a rag-robe wearer; whoever wishes may accept robes received from householders. For in either way, monks, I praise contentment.”

The people in the countryside heard, “The Blessed One, it seems, has allowed monks to accept robes from householders.” And those people were joyful and elated, thinking, “Now we can give gifts and do meritorious deeds, since the Blessed One has allowed monks to accept robes from householders.” In the countryside, many thousands of robes arose in just one day.

338.Now at that time the king of Kāsi sent Jīvaka Komārabhacca a blanket worth half a Kāsī. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca took that blanket worth half a Kāsī and went to the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, Jīvaka Komārabhacca said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, this blanket worth half a Kāsī was sent to me by the king of Kāsi. May the Blessed One accept the blanket from me, for my long-term welfare and happiness.” The Blessed One accepted the blanket. Then the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened Jīvaka Komārabhacca with a Dhamma talk…and then, having circumambulated the Blessed One, he departed. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, in connection with this event, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow blankets.”

339.At that time, various kinds of robes had arisen for the Sangha. Then the monks thought: “What kind of robe has the Blessed One allowed, what has he not allowed?” Then they reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, six kinds of cloth for robes: linen, cotton, silk, wool, hemp, and mixed cloth.”

340. Tena kho pana samayena ye te bhikkhū gahapaticīvaraṃ sādiyanti te kukkuccāyantā paṃsukūlaṃ na sādiyanti – ekaṃyeva bhagavatā cīvaraṃ anuññātaṃ, na dveti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, gahapaticīvaraṃ sādiyantena paṃsukūlampi sādiyituṃ; tadubhayenapāhaṃ, bhikkhave, santuṭṭhiṃ vaṇṇemīti.

340.At that time, those monks who accepted robes provided by householders were hesitant and did not accept rag-robes—thinking that only one robe was allowed by the Blessed One, not two. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, one who accepts robes provided by householders to also accept rag-robes. For in both of these, monks, I praise contentment.”

212.The Account of Seeking Rag-robes

341. Tena kho pana samayena sambahulā bhikkhū kosalesu janapade addhānamaggappaṭipannā honti. Ekacce bhikkhū susānaṃ okkamiṃsu paṃsukūlāya, ekacce bhikkhū nāgamesuṃ.

341.Now at that time, several monks were traveling on a road in the Kosala country. Some monks entered a charnel ground for rag-robes, while others did not go. Those monks who entered the charnel ground obtained rag-robes. Those who did not go said, "Friends, give us a share too." They replied, "We won’t give you a share, friends. Why did you not go?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow that those who did not go should be given a share unwillingly."

Tena kho pana samayena sambahulā bhikkhū kosalesu janapade addhānamaggappaṭipannā honti. Ekacce bhikkhū susānaṃ okkamiṃsu paṃsukūlāya, ekacce bhikkhū āgamesuṃ.

Now at that time, several monks were traveling on a road in the Kosala country. Some monks entered a charnel ground for rag-robes, while others waited. Those monks who entered the charnel ground for rag-robes obtained them. Those who waited said, "Friends, give us a share too." They replied, "We will not give you a share, friends. Why did you not enter?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow that those who waited should be given a share unwillingly."

Now at that time, several monks were traveling on a road in the Kosala country. Some monks entered a charnel ground first for rag-robes, while others entered later. Those monks who entered the charnel ground first obtained rag-robes, but those who entered later did not. They said, "Friends, give us a share." The others replied, "We won’t give you a share, friends. Why did you enter later?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow that those who entered later should be given a share unwillingly."

Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sadisānaṃ okkantānaṃ akāmā bhāgaṃ dātunti.

Now at that time, several monks were traveling on a road in the Kosala country. They entered a charnel ground together for rag-robes. Some monks obtained rag-robes, while others did not obtain them. Those monks who did not obtain any said, "Friends, give us a share too." The others replied, "We will not give you a share, friends. Why did you not obtain any?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow that those who entered together should be given a share unwillingly."

Now at that time, several monks were traveling on a road in the Kosala country. Having made an agreement, they entered a charnel ground for rag-robes. Some monks obtained rag-robes, while others did not obtain them. Those monks who did not obtain any said, "Friends, give us a share too." The others replied, "No, friends, we will not give you a share. Why did you not obtain any?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow that those who entered after making an agreement should be given a share unwillingly."

213.The Account of the Appointment of a Robe Receiver.

342. Tena kho pana samayena manussā cīvaraṃ ādāya ārāmaṃ āgacchanti. Te paṭiggāhakaṃ alabhamānā paṭiharanti. Cīvaraṃ parittaṃ uppajjati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

342.Now at that time, people came to the monastery bringing robes. Not finding anyone to receive them, they turned back. Robes arose only in small quantity. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow the appointment of a monk endowed with five qualities as a robe receiver: one who does not go to partiality through desire, who does not go to partiality through hatred, who does not go to partiality through delusion, who does not go to partiality through fear, and who knows what has been received and what has not been received. And, monks, he should be appointed like this. First, a monk should be requested; having been requested, the Sangha should be informed by a competent monk:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ cīvarapaṭiggāhakaṃ sammanneyya. Esā ñatti.

"Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. If it is ready for the Sangha, let the Sangha appoint the monk named so-and-so as the robe receiver. This is the motion."

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ cīvarapaṭiggāhakaṃ sammannati. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa bhikkhuno cīvarapaṭiggāhakassa sammuti, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

"Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. The Sangha appoints the monk named so-and-so as the robe receiver. If the appointment of the monk named so-and-so as the robe receiver is agreeable to the venerable ones, let them remain silent; if it is not agreeable, let them speak."

‘‘Sammato saṅghena itthannāmo bhikkhu cīvarapaṭiggāhako. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

"The monk named so-and-so has been appointed as the robe receiver by the Sangha. It is approved by the Sangha, therefore it is silent. Thus do I hold it."

Now at that time, monks, having received robes, would abandon them right there and depart. The robes were lost. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow the appointment of a monk endowed with five qualities as a robe-storekeeper: one who does not go to partiality through desire, who does not go to partiality through hatred, who does not go to partiality through delusion, who does not go to partiality through fear, and who knows what has been put down and what has not been put down.

214.The Discussion on the Designation of a Storehouse and So Forth.

343. Tena kho pana samayena cīvaranidahako bhikkhu maṇḍapepi rukkhamūlepi nibbakosepi cīvaraṃ nidahati, undūrehipi upacikāhipi khajjanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhaṇḍāgāraṃ sammannituṃ, yaṃ saṅgho ākaṅkhati vihāraṃ vā aḍḍhayogaṃ vā pāsādaṃ vā hammiyaṃ vā guhaṃ vā. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, sammannitabbo. Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

343.Now at that time a monk storing robes would deposit robes in a pavilion, at the foot of a tree, or in the open air, and rats and termites would eat them. They told the Blessed One about this matter. “I allow, monks, to designate a storehouse—whatever the Saṅgha wishes: a dwelling, a lean-to, a multi-story building, a mansion, or a cave. And, monks, it should be designated thus. A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmaṃ vihāraṃ bhaṇḍāgāraṃ sammanneyya. Esā ñatti.

“Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. If it is agreeable to the Saṅgha, let the Saṅgha designate such-and-such a monastery as a storehouse. This is the motion.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ vihāraṃ bhaṇḍāgāraṃ sammannati. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa vihārassa bhaṇḍāgārassa sammuti, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. The Saṅgha is designating such-and-such a monastery as a storehouse. Whoever approves of the designation of such-and-such a monastery as a storehouse, let him remain silent; whoever does not approve, let him speak.

‘‘Sammato saṅghena itthannāmo vihāro bhaṇḍāgāraṃ. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

“The Saṅgha has designated such-and-such a monastery as a storehouse. The Saṅgha approves. Therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.”

Tena kho pana samayena saṅghassa bhaṇḍāgāre cīvaraṃ aguttaṃ hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgataṃ bhikkhuṃ bhaṇḍāgārikaṃ sammannituṃ – yo na chandāgatiṃ gaccheyya, na dosāgatiṃ gaccheyya, na mohāgatiṃ gaccheyya, na bhayāgatiṃ gaccheyya, guttāguttañca jāneyya. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, sammannitabbo. Paṭhamaṃ bhikkhu yācitabbo; yācitvā byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

At that time, the Saṅgha’s storehouse had unguarded robes. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, to designate a monk endowed with five qualities as the storehouse keeper: one who does not go by way of desire, does not go by way of hatred, does not go by way of delusion, does not go by way of fear, and knows what is guarded and unguarded. And, monks, he should be designated thus. First, the monk should be requested. Having been requested, the Saṅgha should be informed by a competent and capable monk:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ bhaṇḍāgārikaṃ sammanneyya. Esā ñatti.

“Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. If it is agreeable to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should designate the monk named such-and-such as the storehouse keeper. This is the motion.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ bhaṇḍāgārikaṃ sammannati. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa bhikkhuno bhaṇḍāgārikassa sammuti, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. The Saṅgha is designating the monk named such-and-such as storehouse keeper. Whoever approves of the designation of the monk named such-and-such as storehouse keeper, let him remain silent; whoever does not approve, let him speak.

‘‘Sammato saṅghena itthannāmo bhikkhu bhaṇḍāgāriko. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

“The Saṅgha has designated the monk named such-and-such as storehouse keeper. The Saṅgha approves. Therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.”

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū bhaṇḍāgārikaṃ vuṭṭhāpenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, bhaṇḍāgāriko vuṭṭhāpetabbo. Yo vuṭṭhāpeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

At that time the group-of-six monks were removing the storehouse keeper. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, a storehouse keeper should not be removed. Whoever removes him, there is an offense of wrong-doing.”

Tena kho pana samayena saṅghassa bhaṇḍāgāre cīvaraṃ ussannaṃ hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sammukhībhūtena saṅghena bhājetunti.

At that time, the Saṅgha’s storehouse had an excessive amount of robes. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, that they be distributed by the Saṅgha in person.”

Tena kho pana samayena saṅgho cīvaraṃ bhājento kolāhalaṃ akāsi. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgataṃ bhikkhuṃ cīvarabhājakaṃ sammannituṃ – yo na chandāgatiṃ gaccheyya, na dosāgatiṃ gaccheyya, na mohāgatiṃ gaccheyya, na bhayāgatiṃ gaccheyya, bhājitābhājitañca jāneyya. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, sammannitabbo. Paṭhamaṃ bhikkhu yācitabbo; yācitvā byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

At that time the Saṅgha made a commotion while distributing robes. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, to designate a monk endowed with five qualities as the robe distributor: one who does not go by way of desire, does not go by way of hatred, does not go by way of delusion, does not go by way of fear, and knows what has been distributed and what has not been distributed. And, monks, he should be designated thus. First, the monk should be requested. Having been requested, the Saṅgha should be informed by a competent and capable monk:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ cīvarabhājakaṃ sammanneyya. Esā ñatti.

“Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. If it is agreeable to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should designate the monk named such-and-such as the robe distributor. This is the motion.”

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ cīvarabhājakaṃ sammannati. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa bhikkhuno cīvarabhājakassa sammuti, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. The Saṅgha is designating the monk named such-and-such as robe distributor. Whoever approves of the designation of the monk named such-and-such as robe distributor, let him remain silent; whoever does not approve, let him speak.

‘‘Sammato saṅghena itthannāmo bhikkhu cīvarabhājako. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

“The Saṅgha has designated the monk named such-and-such as the robe distributor. The Saṅgha approves. Therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.”

Atha kho cīvarabhājakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kathaṃ nu kho cīvaraṃ bhājetabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, paṭhamaṃ uccinitvā tulayitvā vaṇṇāvaṇṇaṃ katvā bhikkhū gaṇetvā vaggaṃ bandhitvā cīvarapaṭivīsaṃ ṭhapetunti.

Then the robe-distributing monks thought: “How should the robes be distributed?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, first to select, weigh, and differentiate them by quality, then count the monks, form groups, and set aside a robe allocation.”

Atha kho cīvarabhājakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kathaṃ nu kho sāmaṇerānaṃ cīvarapaṭivīso dātabbo’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sāmaṇerānaṃ upaḍḍhapaṭivīsaṃ dātunti.

Then the robe-distributing monks had this thought: “How should the allocation of robes be given to the novices?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, to give the novices half a share.”

Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu sakena bhāgena uttaritukāmo hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, uttarantassa sakaṃ bhāgaṃ dātunti.

At that time a certain monk intended to depart with his share. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, that his own share be given to one who is departing.”

Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu atirekabhāgena uttaritukāmo hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, anukkhepe dinne atirekabhāgaṃ dātunti.

At that time, a certain monk intended to depart with an extra share. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, to give an extra share when it has been given without objection.”

Atha kho cīvarabhājakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kathaṃ nu kho cīvarapaṭivīso dātabbo, āgatapaṭipāṭiyā [āgatāgatapaṭipāṭiyā (ka.)] nu kho udāhu yathāvuḍḍha’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, vikalake tosetvā kusapātaṃ kātunti.

Then the robe-distributing monks had this thought: “How should the distribution of robes be given—according to the order of arrival or according to seniority?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, having made up for the deficiencies, to cast lots.”

Bhaṇḍāgārasammutiādikathā niṭṭhitā.

The discussion on the designation of a storehouse and so forth is concluded.

215.The Discourse on Robe Dyeing

344. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū chakaṇenapi paṇḍumattikāyapi cīvaraṃ rajanti. Cīvaraṃ dubbaṇṇaṃ hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, cha rajanāni – mūlarajanaṃ, khandharajanaṃ, tacarajanaṃ, pattarajanaṃ, puppharajanaṃ, phalarajananti.

344.At that time monks were dyeing robes with cow dung or reddish clay. The robes turned out poorly colored. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, six kinds of dye: root dye, stem dye, bark dye, leaf dye, flower dye, and fruit dye."

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū sītudakāya [sītundikāya (sī.), sītūdakāya (syā.)] cīvaraṃ rajanti. Cīvaraṃ duggandhaṃ hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, rajanaṃ pacituṃ cullaṃ rajanakumbhinti. Rajanaṃ uttariyati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, uttarāḷumpaṃ [uttarāḷupaṃ (yojanā), uttarāḷupaṃ (syā.)] bandhitunti.

At that time, monks were dyeing robes with cold water. The robes developed a bad smell. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, to cook the dye in a small dye-pot." The dye boiled over. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, to bind on a rim to prevent overflow."

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū na jānanti rajanaṃ pakkaṃ vā apakkaṃ vā. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, udake vā nakhapiṭṭhikāya vā thevakaṃ dātunti.

At that time, monks did not know whether the dye was cooked or uncooked. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, a sample to be tested with water or a fingernail."

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū rajanaṃ oropentā kumbhiṃ āviñchanti [āviñjanti (sī.), āvaṭṭanti (syā.)]. Kumbhī bhijjati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, rajanuḷuṅkaṃ [rajanāḷuṅkaṃ (yojanā)] daṇḍakathālakanti.

At that time monks, while taking dye out, pulled on the pot. The pot broke. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, a dye dipper and a handled dipper."

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhūnaṃ rajanabhājanaṃ na saṃvijjati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, rajanakolambaṃ rajanaghaṭanti.

At that time the monks did not have a dye container. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, a dye-trough or a dye-jar."

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū pātiyāpi pattepi cīvaraṃ omaddanti. Cīvaraṃ paribhijjati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, rajanadoṇikanti.

At that time, monks were pressing robes with bowls and also with plates. The robes tore. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, a dyeing vat."

At that time monks were spreading robes on the ground. The robes became soiled with dust. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, a grass mat."

Tiṇasanthārako upacikāhi khajjati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, cīvaravaṃsaṃ cīvararajjunti.

The grass mat was eaten by white ants. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, a robe support and a robe cord."

Majjhena laggenti. Rajanaṃ ubhato galati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, kaṇṇe bandhitunti.

They hung it by the middle. The dye dripped from both sides. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, to tie it at the corners."

Kaṇṇo jīrati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, kaṇṇasuttakanti.

The corners wore out. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, corner strings."

Rajanaṃ ekato galati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, samparivattakaṃ samparivattakaṃ rajetuṃ, na ca acchinne theve pakkamitunti.

The dye dripped down on one side. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, to dye by turning it around repeatedly, but not to leave while the drop is not cut off.”

Tena kho pana samayena cīvaraṃ patthinnaṃ hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, udake osāretunti.

At that time robes had become stiff. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, to immerse them in water."

Tena kho pana samayena cīvaraṃ pharusaṃ hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, pāṇinā ākoṭetunti.

At that time, robes were rough. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, to beat them with the hand."

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū acchinnakāni cīvarāni dhārenti dantakāsāvāni. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – seyyathāpi nāma [seyyathāpi (?)] gihī kāmabhoginoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, acchinnakāni cīvarāni dhāretabbāni. Yo dhāreyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

At that time monks were wearing uncut robes, dyed tooth-colored. People complained, criticized, and spread it about: "Just like householders who indulge in sensual pleasures." They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, uncut robes should not be worn. Whoever wears them, there is an offense of wrong conduct."

Cīvararajanakathā niṭṭhitā.

The discussion on robe dyeing is concluded.

216.Permission for Cut-off Robes

345. Atha kho bhagavā rājagahe yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena dakkhiṇāgiri tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Addasā kho bhagavā magadhakhettaṃ acchibaddhaṃ [accibaddhaṃ (sī. syā.), acchibandhaṃ (ka.)] pāḷibaddhaṃ mariyādabaddhaṃ siṅghāṭakabaddhaṃ, disvāna āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ āmantesi – ‘‘passasi no tvaṃ, ānanda, magadhakhettaṃ acchibaddhaṃ pāḷibaddhaṃ mariyādabaddhaṃ siṅghāṭakabaddha’’nti? ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti. ‘‘Ussahasi tvaṃ, ānanda, bhikkhūnaṃ evarūpāni cīvarāni saṃvidahitu’’nti? ‘‘Ussahāmi, bhagavā’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā dakkhiṇāgirismiṃ yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā punadeva rājagahaṃ paccāgañchi. Atha kho āyasmā ānando sambahulānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ cīvarāni saṃvidahitvā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘passatu me [passatha tumhe (ka.)], bhante, bhagavā cīvarāni saṃvidahitānī’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘paṇḍito, bhikkhave, ānando; mahāpañño, bhikkhave, ānando; yatra hi nāma mayā saṃkhittena bhāsitassa vitthārena atthaṃ ājānissati, kusimpi nāma karissati, aḍḍhakusimpi nāma karissati, maṇḍalampi nāma karissati, aḍḍhamaṇḍalampi nāma karissati, vivaṭṭampi nāma karissati, anuvivaṭṭampi nāma karissati, gīveyyakampi nāma karissati, jaṅgheyyakampi nāma karissati, bāhantampi nāma karissati, chinnakaṃ bhavissati, satthalūkhaṃ samaṇasāruppaṃ paccatthikānañca anabhicchitaṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, chinnakaṃ saṅghāṭiṃ chinnakaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ chinnakaṃ antaravāsaka’’nti.

345.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Rājagaha as long as he pleased, set out on a journey toward Dakkhiṇāgiri. The Blessed One saw the Magadha fields enclosed with fences, embankments, and boundaries, with crossroads well-defined. Seeing this, he addressed Venerable Ānanda: "Do you see, Ānanda, how the Magadha fields are enclosed with fences, embankments, and boundaries, with crossroads well-defined?" "Yes, Venerable Sir." "Are you able, Ānanda, to make such robes for the monks?" "I am able, Blessed One." Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Dakkhiṇāgiri as long as he pleased, returned to Rājagaha. Then Venerable Ānanda, having made robes for many monks, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he said to the Blessed One: "May the Blessed One see the robes I have made." Then the Blessed One, on this occasion and in this connection, gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: "Ānanda is wise, monks; Ānanda has great wisdom, monks. For he understands in detail the meaning of what I have stated briefly. He can make a kusi (patchwork) robe, a half-kusi robe, a maṇḍala (circular) robe, a half-maṇḍala robe, an open robe, an overlapping robe, a neck robe, a shin robe, an arm robe. It will be cut, rough, suitable for ascetics, and not desired by adversaries. I allow, monks, a cut saṅghāṭi, a cut uttarāsaṅga, and a cut antaravāsaka."

Chinnakacīvarānujānanā niṭṭhitā.

The allowance regarding cut robes is concluded.

346.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Rājagaha as long as he pleased, set out on a journey toward Vesālī. On the way between Rājagaha and Vesālī, the Blessed One saw many monks with robes piled up—some carrying a bundle of robes on their heads, some on their shoulders, and some around their waists. Seeing this, the Blessed One thought: "These foolish men are too indulgent with robes. Why don't I set a limit for the monks regarding robes, establishing a boundary?" Then the Blessed One, traveling by stages, arrived at Vesālī. There, he stayed at the Gotamaka Shrine. At that time, during the cold winter nights between the months, when frost was falling, the Blessed One sat in the open air wearing only a single robe. He did not feel cold. At the end of the first watch of the night, he felt cold. He put on a second robe. He did not feel cold. At the end of the middle watch, he felt cold. He put on a third robe. He did not feel cold. At the end of the last watch, as dawn approached, with the night having a smiling face, he felt cold. He put on a fourth robe. He did not feel cold. Then the Blessed One thought: "Even those clansmen in this Dhamma-Vinaya who are susceptible to cold and fearful of the cold can manage with three robes. Why don't I set a limit for the monks regarding robes, establishing a boundary, and allow them three robes?" Then the Blessed One, having given a Dhamma talk on this occasion, in this connection, addressed the monks: "Monks, while traveling between Rājagaha and Vesālī, I saw many monks with robes piled up—some carrying a bundle of robes on their heads, some on their shoulders, and some around their waists. Seeing this, I thought: 'These foolish men are too indulgent with robes. Why don't I set a limit for the monks regarding robes, establishing a boundary?' "Again, monks, during the cold winter nights between the months, when frost was falling, I sat in the open air wearing only a single robe. I did not feel cold. At the end of the first watch, I felt cold. I put on a second robe. I did not feel cold. At the end of the middle watch, I felt cold. I put on a third robe. I did not feel cold. At the end of the last watch, as dawn approached, with the night having a smiling face, I felt cold. I put on a fourth robe. I did not feel cold. "Then, monks, it occurred to me: 'Even those clansmen in this Dhamma-Vinaya who are susceptible to cold and fearful of the cold can manage with three robes. Why don't I set a limit for the monks regarding robes, establishing a boundary, and allow them three robes?' "Monks, I allow three robes: a double sanghati, a single upper robe, and a single lower robe."

Ticīvarānujānanā niṭṭhitā.

The allowance concerning the three robes is concluded.

218.The Discourse on Extra Robes

347. [pārā. 461] Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū bhagavatā ticīvaraṃ anuññātanti aññeneva ticīvarena gāmaṃ pavisanti, aññena ticīvarena ārāme acchanti, aññena ticīvarena nahānaṃ otaranti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma chabbaggiyā bhikkhū atirekacīvaraṃ dhāressantī’’ti. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, atirekacīvaraṃ dhāretabbaṃ. Yo dhāreyya, yathādhammo kāretabbo’’ti.

347.At that time the monks of the group of six, thinking, "The Blessed One has allowed three robes," entered the village wearing one set of three robes, stayed in the monastery with another set, and went down to bathe with yet another set. The monks who were modest were displeased, grumbled, and protested, saying: "How can the monks of the group of six keep extra robes?" Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. Then, on this occasion, in connection with this incident, the Blessed One, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks, saying: "Monks, an extra robe should not be kept. Whoever keeps one, should be dealt with according to the Dhamma."

[pārā. 461] Tena kho pana samayena āyasmato ānandassa atirekacīvaraṃ uppannaṃ hoti. Āyasmā ca ānando taṃ cīvaraṃ āyasmato sāriputtassa dātukāmo hoti. Āyasmā ca sāriputto sākete viharati. Atha kho āyasmato ānandassa etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā sikkhāpadaṃ paññattaṃ ‘na atirekacīvaraṃ dhāretabba’nti. Idañca me atirekacīvaraṃ uppannaṃ. Ahañcimaṃ cīvaraṃ āyasmato sāriputtassa dātukāmo. Āyasmā ca sāriputto sākete viharati. Kathaṃ nu kho mayā paṭipajjitabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesi. ‘‘Kīvaciraṃ panānanda, sāriputto āgacchissatī’’ti? ‘‘Navamaṃ vā, bhagavā, divasaṃ, dasamaṃ vā’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, dasāhaparamaṃ atirekacīvaraṃ dhāretu’’nti.

At that time, Venerable Ānanda had an extra robe that had arisen. Venerable Ānanda wished to give that robe to Venerable Sāriputta. And Venerable Sāriputta was staying at Sāketa. Then Venerable Ānanda thought: "The Blessed One has laid down a training rule, 'Extra robes should not be kept.' And this extra robe has arisen for me. I wish to give this robe to Venerable Sāriputta, and Venerable Sāriputta is staying at Sāketa. What should I do now?" He reported the matter to the Blessed One. "Ānanda, how long will it be before Sāriputta comes?" "Venerable sir, perhaps nine or ten days." Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, in this connection, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: "Monks, I allow an extra robe to be kept for a maximum of ten days."

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhūnaṃ atirekacīvaraṃ uppannaṃ hoti. Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kathaṃ nu kho amhehi atirekacīvare paṭipajjitabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, atirekacīvaraṃ vikappetunti.

At that time, monks had acquired extra robes. Then the monks thought: "How should we deal with these extra robes?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, the extra robes to be allocated."

348. Atha kho bhagavā vesāliyaṃ yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena bārāṇasī tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena bārāṇasī tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā bārāṇasiyaṃ viharati isipatane migadāye. Tena kho pana samayena aññatarassa bhikkhuno antaravāsako chiddo hoti. Atha kho tassa bhikkhuno etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā ticīvaraṃ anuññātaṃ – diguṇā saṅghāṭi, ekacciyo uttarāsaṅgo, ekacciyo antaravāsako. Ayañca me antaravāsako chiddo. Yaṃnūnāhaṃ aggaḷaṃ acchupeyyaṃ, samantato dupaṭṭaṃ bhavissati, majjhe ekacciya’’nti. Atha kho so bhikkhu aggaḷaṃ acchupesi. Addasā kho bhagavā senāsanacārikaṃ āhiṇḍanto taṃ bhikkhuṃ aggaḷaṃ acchupentaṃ [acchupantaṃ (ka.)], disvāna yena so bhikkhu tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā taṃ bhikkhuṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kiṃ tvaṃ, bhikkhu, karosī’’ti? ‘‘Aggaḷaṃ, bhagavā, acchupemī’’ti. ‘‘Sādhu sādhu, bhikkhu; sādhu kho tvaṃ, bhikkhu, aggaḷaṃ acchupesī’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, ahatānaṃ dussānaṃ ahatakappānaṃ diguṇaṃ saṅghāṭiṃ, ekacciyaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ, ekacciyaṃ antaravāsakaṃ; utuddhaṭānaṃ dussānaṃ catugguṇaṃ saṅghāṭiṃ, diguṇaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ, diguṇaṃ antaravāsakaṃ; paṃsukūle yāvadatthaṃ; pāpaṇike ussāho karaṇīyo. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, aggaḷaṃ tunnaṃ ovaṭṭikaṃ kaṇḍusakaṃ daḷhīkamma’’nti.

348.Then the Blessed One, having stayed in Vesālī as long as he pleased, set out on a journey toward Bārāṇasī. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Bārāṇasī. There the Blessed One stayed in the deer park at Isipatana. At that time, a certain monk’s lower robe was torn. Then that monk thought: "The Blessed One has allowed three robes—a double outer robe, a single upper robe, and a single lower robe. But my lower robe is torn. What if I were to patch it with an aggalā patch? It would be double-layered all around, with a single layer in the middle." So that monk patched it with an aggalā patch. The Blessed One, while walking around the lodgings, saw that monk patching the robe with an aggalā patch. Seeing him, he approached and said: "What are you doing, monk?" "I am patching the robe with an aggalā patch, Blessed One." "Good, good, monk. It is good that you are patching the robe with an aggalā patch." Then the Blessed One, on this occasion and in this connection, gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: "I allow, monks, for new cloth and unused cloth, a double outer robe, a single upper robe, and a single lower robe. For worn-out cloth, a quadruple outer robe, a double upper robe, and a double lower robe. For rag-robes, as much as is needed. Effort should be made at the market. I allow, monks, patching, darning (ovaṭṭikaṃ), reinforcing, and strengthening."

Atirekacīvarakathā niṭṭhitā.

The discourse on extra robes is concluded.

219.The Story of Visākhā

349. Atha kho bhagavā bārāṇasiyaṃ yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena sāvatthi tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena sāvatthi tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Atha kho visākhā migāramātā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho visākhaṃ migāramātaraṃ bhagavā dhammiyā kathāya sandassesi samādapesi samuttejesi sampahaṃsesi. Atha kho visākhā migāramātā, bhagavatā dhammiyā kathāya sandassitā samādapitā samuttejitā sampahaṃsitā, bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘adhivāsetu me, bhante, bhagavā svātanāya bhattaṃ saddhiṃ bhikkhusaṅghenā’’ti. Adhivāsesi bhagavā tuṇhībhāvena. Atha kho visākhā migāramātā bhagavato adhivāsanaṃ viditvā uṭṭhāyāsanā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṃ katvā pakkāmi.

349.Then the Blessed One, having stayed in Bārāṇasī as long as he pleased, set out on a journey toward Sāvatthī. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sāvatthī. There the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Monastery. Then Visākhā Migāramātā approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One instructed, urged, enlightened, and gladdened Visākhā Migāramātā with a Dhamma talk. Then Visākhā Migāramātā, having been instructed, urged, enlightened, and gladdened by the Blessed One’s Dhamma talk, said to him: "May the Blessed One, together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus, accept my meal tomorrow." The Blessed One consented by silence. Then Visākhā Migāramātā, knowing the Blessed One’s consent, rose from her seat, paid homage to him, circumambulated him, and left.

Tena kho pana samayena tassā rattiyā accayena cātuddīpiko mahāmegho pāvassi. Atha kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘yathā, bhikkhave, jetavane vassati evaṃ catūsu dīpesu vassati. Ovassāpetha, bhikkhave, kāyaṃ. Ayaṃ pacchimako cātuddīpiko mahāmegho’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti kho te bhikkhū bhagavato paṭissuṇitvā nikkhittacīvarā kāyaṃ ovassāpenti. Atha kho visākhā migāramātā paṇītaṃ khādanīyaṃ bhojanīyaṃ paṭiyādāpetvā dāsiṃ āṇāpesi – ‘‘gaccha, je.

Atha kho visākhāya migāramātuyā paṇḍitāya viyattāya medhāviniyā etadahosi – ‘‘nissaṃsayaṃ kho ayyā nikkhittacīvarā kāyaṃ ovassāpenti. Sāyaṃ bālā maññittha – natthi ārāme bhikkhū, ājīvakā kāyaṃ ovassāpentī’’ti, puna dāsiṃ āṇāpesi – ‘‘gaccha, je. Ārāmaṃ gantvā kālaṃ ārocehi – kālo, bhante, niṭṭhitaṃ bhatta’’nti. Atha kho te bhikkhū gattāni sītiṃ karitvā [sītīkaritvā (syā.)] kallakāyā cīvarāni gahetvā yathāvihāraṃ pavisiṃsu. Atha kho sā dāsī ārāmaṃ gantvā bhikkhū apassantī ‘natthi ārāme bhikkhū, suñño ārāmo’ti yena visākhā migāramātā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā visākhaṃ migāramātaraṃ etadavoca – ‘‘natthayye, ārāme bhikkhū, suñño ārāmo’’ti. Atha kho visākhāya migāramātuyā paṇḍitāya viyattāya medhāviniyā etadahosi – ‘‘nissaṃsayaṃ kho ayyā gattāni sītiṃ karitvā kallakāyā cīvarāni gahetvā yathāvihāraṃ paviṭṭhā. Sāyaṃ bālā maññittha – natthi ārāme bhikkhū, suñño ārāmo’’ti, puna dāsiṃ āṇāpesi – ‘‘gaccha, je. Ārāmaṃ gantvā kālaṃ ārocehi – kālo, bhante, niṭṭhitaṃ bhatta’’nti.

At that time, with the passing of the night, a great cloud raining over the four continents poured down. Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, just as it is raining in Jetavana, so it is raining over the four continents. Drench your bodies, bhikkhus. This is the last great cloud raining over the four continents." "Yes, venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One, and laying aside their robes, they drenched their bodies. Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, having prepared choice hard and soft food, instructed a servant girl: "Go, dear. Go to the monastery and announce the time: 'Venerable sirs, it is time, the meal is ready.'" "Yes, madam," that servant girl replied to Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, and went to the monastery. There she saw the bhikkhus drenching their bodies with their robes laid aside. Seeing this, she thought, "There are no bhikkhus in the monastery; the Ājīvakas are drenching their bodies," and she returned to Visākhā, Migāra’s mother. Upon arriving, she said to Visākhā, Migāra’s mother: "Madam, there are no bhikkhus in the monastery; the Ājīvakas are drenching their bodies." Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, being wise, discerning, and intelligent, thought: "Surely, the venerable ones have laid aside their robes and are drenching their bodies. She, being foolish, must have thought, 'There are no bhikkhus in the monastery; the Ājīvakas are drenching their bodies.'" She instructed the servant girl again: "Go, dear. Go to the monastery and announce the time: 'Venerable sirs, it is time, the meal is ready.'" Then those bhikkhus, having cooled their limbs and refreshed their bodies, took up their robes and entered their respective dwellings. Then that servant girl went to the monastery and, not seeing the bhikkhus, thought, "There are no bhikkhus in the monastery; the monastery is empty," and she returned to Visākhā, Migāra’s mother.

350.Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Arrange your bowls and robes, bhikkhus; it is time for the meal." "Yes, venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning and taken his bowl and robe—just as a strong man might extend his bent arm or bend his extended arm—so did he vanish from Jeta Grove and reappear in Visākhā Migāramātā’s mansion. The Blessed One sat down on the prepared seat together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Then Visākhā Migāramātā thought: "How wonderful! How astonishing! The Tathāgata possesses such great power and might, that even though water rising to knee-level and water rising to waist-level were occurring, not even a single bhikkhu’s feet or robes got wet!"—joyful and elated, she personally served and satisfied the Saṅgha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with choice hard and soft food. When the Blessed One had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl, she sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, Visākhā Migāramātā said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, I ask the Blessed One for eight boons." "Visākhā, the Tathāgatas do not grant boons." "But, venerable sir, they are allowable and blameless." "Speak, Visākhā." "I wish, venerable sir, to give the Saṅgha rain-bathing cloths for as long as I live, to give guest-food, to give departure-food, to give sick-food, to give food for those who attend the sick, to give medicine for the sick, to give constant gruel, and to give bathing cloths for the Saṅgha of bhikkhunīs." "But, Visākhā, what advantage do you foresee that you ask the Tathāgata for these eight boons?"

‘‘Idhāhaṃ, bhante, dāsiṃ āṇāpesiṃ – ‘gaccha, je. Ārāmaṃ gantvā kālaṃ ārocehi – kālo, bhante, niṭṭhitaṃ bhatta’’’nti. Atha kho sā, bhante, dāsī ārāmaṃ gantvā addasa bhikkhū nikkhittacīvare kāyaṃ ovassāpente, disvāna ‘‘natthi ārāme bhikkhū, ājīvakā kāyaṃ ovassāpentī’’ti yenāhaṃ tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā maṃ etadavoca – ‘‘natthayye, ārāme bhikkhū, ājīvakā kāyaṃ ovassāpentī’’ti. Asuci, bhante, naggiyaṃ jegucchaṃ paṭikūlaṃ. Imāhaṃ, bhante, atthavasaṃ sampassamānā icchāmi saṅghassa yāvajīvaṃ vassikasāṭikaṃ dātuṃ.

Venerable sir, here I ordered a servant girl, saying, ‘Go, dear. Go to the monastery and announce the time: "Venerable sirs, it is time, the meal is ready."’ Then, venerable sir, that servant girl went to the monastery and saw bhikkhus with their robes put aside, drenching their bodies. Seeing this, she thought, ‘There are no bhikkhus in the monastery; Ājīvakas are drenching their bodies,’ and she came back to me. Having approached, she said to me, ‘Madam, there are no bhikkhus in the monastery; Ājīvakas are drenching their bodies.’ Venerable sir, nakedness is impure, disgusting, and repulsive. Seeing this advantage, venerable sir, I wish to give the Saṅgha a rain-bathing cloth for as long as I live.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhante, āgantuko bhikkhu na vīthikusalo na gocarakusalo kilanto piṇḍāya carati. So me āgantukabhattaṃ bhuñjitvā vīthikusalo gocarakusalo akilanto piṇḍāya carissati. Imāhaṃ, bhante, atthavasaṃ sampassamānā icchāmi saṅghassa yāvajīvaṃ āgantukabhattaṃ dātuṃ.

Furthermore, venerable sir, a visiting bhikkhu is not skilled in the ways of the streets and alms-round, and goes for alms weary. But having eaten my guest-food, he will be skilled in the ways of the streets and alms-round, and will go for alms without weariness. Seeing this advantage, venerable sir, I wish to give guest-food to the Saṅgha for as long as I live.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhante, gamiko bhikkhu attano bhattaṃ pariyesamāno satthā vā vihāyissati, yattha vā vāsaṃ gantukāmo bhavissati tattha vikāle upagacchissati, kilanto addhānaṃ gamissati. So me gamikabhattaṃ bhuñjitvā satthā na vihāyissati, yattha vāsaṃ gantukāmo bhavissati tattha kāle upagacchissati, akilanto addhānaṃ gamissati. Imāhaṃ, bhante, atthavasaṃ sampassamānā icchāmi saṅghassa yāvajīvaṃ gamikabhattaṃ dātuṃ.

Furthermore, venerable sir, a traveling bhikkhu, while searching for his own meal, may miss the caravan or arrive at the place where he wishes to go at the wrong time, and he will travel the road weary. But having eaten my traveling-food, he will not miss the caravan, he will arrive at the place where he wishes to go on time, and he will travel the road unweary. Seeing this advantage, venerable sir, I wish to give traveling-food to the Saṅgha for as long as I live.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhante, gilānassa bhikkhuno sappāyāni bhojanāni alabhantassa ābādho vā abhivaḍḍhissati, kālaṃkiriyā vā bhavissati. Tassa me gilānabhattaṃ bhuttassa ābādho na abhivaḍḍhissati, kālaṃkiriyā na bhavissati. Imāhaṃ, bhante, atthavasaṃ sampassamānā icchāmi saṅghassa yāvajīvaṃ gilānabhattaṃ dātuṃ. ‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhante, gilānupaṭṭhāko bhikkhu attano bhattaṃ pariyesamāno gilānassa ussūre bhattaṃ nīharissati, bhattacchedaṃ karissati. So me gilānupaṭṭhākabhattaṃ bhuñjitvā gilānassa kālena bhattaṃ nīharissati, bhattacchedaṃ na karissati. Imāhaṃ, bhante, atthavasaṃ sampassamānā icchāmi saṅghassa yāvajīvaṃ gilānupaṭṭhākabhattaṃ dātuṃ.

Furthermore, venerable sir, if a sick bhikkhu does not obtain suitable food, his illness will either worsen or he will die. But if he eats my sick-food, his illness will not worsen, and he will not die. Seeing this advantage, venerable sir, I wish to give sick-food to the Saṅgha for as long as I live. Furthermore, venerable sir, a bhikkhu attending the sick, while seeking his own meal, will take food away from the sick at the wrong time, or will interrupt their meal. But if he eats my food for those attending the sick, he will bring food to the sick at the proper time and will not interrupt their meal. Seeing this advantage, venerable sir, I wish to give food for those attending the sick to the Saṅgha for as long as I live.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhante, gilānassa bhikkhuno sappāyāni bhesajjāni alabhantassa ābādho vā abhivaḍḍhissati, kālaṃkiriyā vā bhavissati. Tassa me gilānabhesajjaṃ paribhuttassa ābādho na abhivaḍḍhissati, kālaṃkiriyā na bhavissati. Imāhaṃ, bhante, atthavasaṃ sampassamānā icchāmi saṅghassa yāvajīvaṃ gilānabhesajjaṃ dātuṃ.

Furthermore, venerable sir, if a sick bhikkhu does not obtain suitable medicines, his illness will worsen, or he will die. But if he consumes my sick-medicine, his illness will not worsen, nor will he die. Seeing this advantage, venerable sir, I wish to give sick-medicine to the Saṅgha for as long as I live.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhante, bhagavatā andhakavinde dasānisaṃse sampassamānena yāgu anuññātā. Tyāhaṃ, bhante, ānisaṃse sampassamānā icchāmi saṅghassa yāvajīvaṃ dhuvayāguṃ dātuṃ.

"Furthermore, venerable sir, the Blessed One allowed gruel in Andhakavinda, seeing ten benefits. Seeing these benefits, venerable sir, I wish to offer the Sangha a permanent supply of gruel for life."

‘‘Idha, bhante, bhikkhuniyo aciravatiyā nadiyā vesiyāhi saddhiṃ naggā ekatitthe nahāyanti. Tā, bhante, vesiyā bhikkhuniyo uppaṇḍesuṃ – ‘kiṃ nu kho nāma tumhākaṃ, ayye, daharānaṃ [daharānaṃ daharānaṃ (sī.)] brahmacariyaṃ ciṇṇena, nanu nāma kāmā paribhuñjitabbā; yadā jiṇṇā bhavissatha tadā brahmacariyaṃ carissatha. Evaṃ tumhākaṃ ubho atthā pariggahitā bhavissantī’ti. Tā, bhante, bhikkhuniyo vesiyāhi uppaṇḍiyamānā maṅkū ahesuṃ. Asuci, bhante, mātugāmassa naggiyaṃ jegucchaṃ paṭikūlaṃ. Imāhaṃ, bhante, atthavasaṃ sampassamānā icchāmi bhikkhunisaṅghassa yāvajīvaṃ udakasāṭikaṃ dātu’’nti.

"Venerable sir, here the bhikkhunis bathe naked at the same ford in the Aciravati River together with prostitutes. Those prostitutes, venerable sir, taunted the bhikkhunis: ‘Why, ladies, do you practice celibacy while still young? Surely, sensual pleasures should be enjoyed; when you are old, then you can practice celibacy. Thus, both aims will be achieved for you.’ The bhikkhunis, venerable sir, being taunted by the prostitutes, became ashamed. Venerable sir, the nakedness of women is impure, disgusting, repulsive. Seeing this reason, venerable sir, I wish to give the bhikkhuni Sangha a bathing cloth for life."

351. ‘‘Kiṃ pana tvaṃ, visākhe, ānisaṃsaṃ sampassamānā tathāgataṃ aṭṭha varāni yācasī’’ti? ‘‘Idha, bhante, disāsu vassaṃvuṭṭhā bhikkhū sāvatthiṃ āgacchissanti bhagavantaṃ dassanāya.

351."But, Visākhā, seeing what benefit do you ask the Tathāgata for these eight boons?" "Here, venerable sir, monks who have spent the rains in various regions will come to Sāvatthī to see the Blessed One. They will approach the Blessed One and ask: ‘Venerable sir, the monk named so-and-so has passed away. What is his destiny, what is his future state?’ The Blessed One will explain that he has attained the fruit of stream-entry, or once-returning, or non-returning, or arahantship. Then I will approach them and ask: ‘Venerable sir, had that venerable one ever come to Sāvatthī?’ If they tell me: ‘That monk had indeed come to Sāvatthī,’ I will reach this conclusion: ‘Surely, that venerable one must have used my rains-bathing cloth, or the meal for incoming monks, or the meal for traveling monks, or the meal for the sick, or the meal for those who nurse the sick, or the medicine for the sick, or the regular gruel.’ Remembering this, joy will arise in me. Being joyful, rapture will arise. With a rapturous mind, my body will be tranquil. With a tranquil body, I will feel happiness. Being happy, my mind will become concentrated. This will be for me the development of the faculties, the development of powers, the development of enlightenment factors. Seeing this benefit, venerable sir, I ask the Tathāgata for these eight boons." "Good, good, Visākhā! It is good that you see this benefit and ask the Tathāgata for these eight boons. I grant you, Visākhā, these eight boons." Then the Blessed One rejoiced Visākhā, Migāra's mother, with these verses:

‘‘Yā annapānaṃ dadatippamoditā;Sīlūpapannā sugatassa sāvikā;Dadāti dānaṃ abhibhuyya maccharaṃ;Sovaggikaṃ sokanudaṃ sukhāvahaṃ.

"She who, joyful, gives food and drink, a virtuous female disciple of the Well-Gone One, gives a gift, conquering stinginess, heavenly, sorrow-dispelling, happiness-bringing."

‘‘Dibbaṃ sā labhate āyuṃ [dibbaṃ balaṃ sā labhate ca āyuṃ (sī. syā.)];Āgamma maggaṃ virajaṃ anaṅgaṇaṃ;Sā puññakāmā sukhinī anāmayā;Saggamhi kāyamhi ciraṃ pamodatī’’ti.

"She obtains divine lifespan, having come to the path, stainless and without defilement; desiring merit, happy, without disease, she rejoices long in a heavenly body."

352. Atha kho bhagavā visākhaṃ migāramātaraṃ imāhi gāthāhi anumoditvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkāmi. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, vassikasāṭikaṃ, āgantukabhattaṃ, gamikabhattaṃ, gilānabhattaṃ, gilānupaṭṭhākabhattaṃ, gilānabhesajjaṃ, dhuvayāguṃ, bhikkhunisaṅghassa udakasāṭika’’nti.

352.Then the Blessed One, having rejoiced Visākhā, Migāra's mother, with these verses, rose from his seat and departed. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, in this connection, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: "Monks, I allow the rains-bathing cloth, the meal for incoming monks, the meal for traveling monks, the meal for the sick, the meal for those who attend to the sick, medicine for the sick, regular gruel, and the water-bathing cloth for the community of nuns."

Visākhāvatthu niṭṭhitaṃ.

The Visākhā story is ended.

Visākhābhāṇavāro niṭṭhito.

The recitation about Visākhā is concluded.

220.The Allowance of Sitting Cloths, and So Forth

353. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū paṇītāni bhojanāni bhuñjitvā muṭṭhassatī asampajānā niddaṃ okkamanti.

353.At that time, bhikkhus, having eaten choice food, fell asleep unmindful and without clear comprehension. As they fell asleep unmindful and without clear comprehension, they had nocturnal emissions in their dreams, and their lodging was soiled with impurity. Then the Blessed One, while inspecting the lodgings with Venerable Ānanda as his attendant, saw a lodging soiled with impurity. When he saw it, he addressed Venerable Ānanda: "Ānanda, why is this lodging soiled?" "Venerable sir, at present bhikkhus, having eaten choice food, fall asleep unmindful and without clear comprehension. As they fall asleep unmindful and without clear comprehension, they have nocturnal emissions in their dreams. That is why, Blessed One, this lodging is soiled with impurity." "So it is, Ānanda. So it is. For, Ānanda, impurity is released in the dreams of those who fall asleep unmindful and without clear comprehension. But, Ānanda, for those bhikkhus who fall asleep with mindfulness established and with clear comprehension, impurity is not released. Even for ordinary people who are dispassionate towards sensual pleasures, impurity is not released. It is impossible, Ānanda, it cannot happen that an arahant would release impurity." Then the Blessed One, having given a Dhamma talk on this occasion and in this connection, addressed the bhikkhus: "Here, bhikkhus, while inspecting the lodgings with Ānanda as my attendant, I saw a lodging soiled with impurity. When I saw it, I asked Ānanda, 'Why is this lodging soiled?' 'Venerable sir, at present bhikkhus, having eaten choice food, fall asleep unmindful and without clear comprehension. As they fall asleep unmindful and without clear comprehension, they have nocturnal emissions in their dreams. That is why, Blessed One, this lodging is soiled with impurity.' 'So it is, Ānanda. So it is. For, Ānanda, impurity is released in the dreams of those who fall asleep unmindful and without clear comprehension. But, Ānanda, for those bhikkhus who fall asleep with mindfulness established and with clear comprehension, impurity is not released. Even for ordinary people who are dispassionate towards sensual pleasures, impurity is not released. It is impossible, Ānanda, it cannot happen that an arahant would release impurity.'"

‘‘Pañcime, bhikkhave, ādīnavā muṭṭhassatissa asampajānassa niddaṃ okkamato – dukkhaṃ supati, dukkhaṃ paṭibujjhati, pāpakaṃ supinaṃ passati, devatā na rakkhanti, asuci muccati. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca ādīnavā muṭṭhassatissa asampajānassa niddaṃ okkamato.

Bhikkhus, there are these five drawbacks for one who is unmindful and lacks clear comprehension when falling asleep: he sleeps uncomfortably, he wakes uncomfortably, he sees bad dreams, the devas do not protect him, and impurity is released. These, bhikkhus, are the five drawbacks for one who is unmindful and lacks clear comprehension when falling asleep.

‘‘Pañcime, bhikkhave, ānisaṃsā upaṭṭhitassatissa sampajānassa niddaṃ okkamato – sukhaṃ supati, sukhaṃ paṭibujjhati, na pāpakaṃ supinaṃ passati, devatā rakkhanti, asuci na muccati. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca ānisaṃsā upaṭṭhitassatissa sampajānassa niddaṃ okkamato.

Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits for one who falls asleep with mindfulness established and with clear comprehension: he sleeps happily, he wakes up happily, he does not see bad dreams, the devas protect him, and impurity is not released. These, bhikkhus, are the five benefits for one who falls asleep with mindfulness established and with clear comprehension.

‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, kāyaguttiyā cīvaraguttiyā senāsanaguttiyā nisīdana’’nti.

Bhikkhus, I allow a sitting cloth for the protection of the body, for the protection of robes, and for the protection of lodgings.

Tena kho pana samayena atikhuddakaṃ nisīdanaṃ na sabbaṃ senāsanaṃ saṃgopeti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, yāvamahantaṃ paccattharaṇaṃ ākaṅkhati tāvamahantaṃ paccattharaṇaṃ kātunti.

At that time, a very small sitting cloth did not cover the entire lodging. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Bhikkhus, I allow one to make a spread as large as one wishes."

354. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmato ānandassa upajjhāyassa āyasmato belaṭṭhasīsassa thullakacchābādho hoti. Tassa lasikāya cīvarāni kāye lagganti. Tāni bhikkhū udakena temetvā temetvā apakaḍḍhanti. Addasā kho bhagavā senāsanacārikaṃ āhiṇḍanto te bhikkhū tāni cīvarāni udakena temetvā temetvā apakaḍḍhante, disvāna yena te bhikkhū tenupasaṅkami, upaṅkamitvā te bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘kiṃ imassa, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno ābādho’’ti? ‘‘Imassa, bhante, āyasmato thullakacchābādho. Lasikāya cīvarāni kāye lagganti. Tāni mayaṃ udakena temetvā temetvā apakaḍḍhāmā’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, yassa kaṇḍu vā piḷakā vā assāvo vā thullakacchu vā ābādho kaṇḍuppaṭicchādi’’nti.

354.At that time, Venerable Ānanda’s preceptor, Venerable Belaṭṭhasīsa, had a severe skin disease. His robes stuck to his body with pus. The bhikkhus soaked them repeatedly in water and pulled them off. The Blessed One, while inspecting the lodgings, saw those bhikkhus soaking and pulling off those robes with water. When he saw them, he approached those bhikkhus and said, "Bhikkhus, what is the illness of this bhikkhu?" "Venerable sir, this venerable has a severe skin disease. The robes stick to his body with pus. We are soaking and pulling them off with water." Then the Blessed One, having given a Dhamma talk on this occasion and in this connection, addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, I allow a covering for itching, boils, discharge, or severe skin disease for one who has such an affliction."

355. Atha kho visākhā migāramātā mukhapuñchanacoḷaṃ [mukhapuñjanacoḷaṃ (ka.)] ādāya yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi.

Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, mukhapuñchanacoḷaka’’nti [mukhapuñchanacolanti (syā.)].

355.Then Visākhā Migāramātā, taking a face-wiping cloth, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, she paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, Visākhā Migāramātā said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, may the Blessed One accept this face-wiping cloth from me, which will be for my long-term welfare and happiness." The Blessed One accepted the face-wiping cloth. Then the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened Visākhā Migāramātā with a Dhamma talk. Then Visākhā Migāramātā, having been instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk, rose from her seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed. Then the Blessed One, having given a Dhamma talk on this occasion and in this connection, addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, I allow a face-wiping cloth."

356. Tena kho pana samayena rojo mallo āyasmato ānandassa sahāyo hoti. Rojassa mallassa khomapilotikā āyasmato ānandassa hatthe nikkhittā hoti. Āyasmato ca ānandassa khomapilotikāya attho hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgatassa vissāsaṃ gahetuṃ – sandiṭṭho ca hoti, sambhatto ca, ālapito ca, jīvati ca, jānāti ca, gahite me attamano bhavissatīti. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, imehi pañcahaṅgehi samannāgatassa vissāsaṃ gahetunti.

356.At that time, Roja the Mallan was a friend of Venerable Ānanda. Roja the Mallan had placed a linen rag in Venerable Ānanda’s hand. Venerable Ānanda had a need for the linen rag. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Bhikkhus, I allow one to take something on trust from someone endowed with five factors: he is acquainted, he is intimate, he has been spoken to, he is alive, and one knows, 'He will be pleased by what is taken.' Bhikkhus, I allow one to take something on trust from someone endowed with these five factors."

357. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhūnaṃ paripuṇṇaṃ hoti ticīvaraṃ. Attho ca hoti parissāvanehipi thavikāhipi. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, parikkhāracoḷakanti.

357.At that time the bhikkhus had a full set of three robes. And there was a need for strainers and bags. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Bhikkhus, I allow a utility cloth."

221.The Discussion on Robes and So Forth Subject to Subsequent Designation.

358. Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘yāni tāni bhagavatā anuññātāni ticīvaranti vā vassikasāṭikāti vā nisīdananti vā paccattharaṇanti vā kaṇḍuppaṭicchādīti vā mukhapuñchanacoḷanti vā parikkhāracoḷanti vā, sabbāni tāni adhiṭṭhātabbāni nu kho, udāhu, vikappetabbānī’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, ticīvaraṃ adhiṭṭhātuṃ na vikappetuṃ; vassikasāṭikaṃ vassānaṃ cātumāsaṃ adhiṭṭhātuṃ, tato paraṃ vikappetuṃ; nisīdanaṃ adhiṭṭhātuṃ na vikappetuṃ; paccattharaṇaṃ adhiṭṭhātuṃ na vikappetuṃ; kaṇḍuppaṭicchādiṃ yāvaābādhā adhiṭṭhātuṃ tato paraṃ vikappetuṃ; mukhapuñchanacoḷaṃ adhiṭṭhātuṃ na vikappetuṃ; parikkhāracoḷaṃ adhiṭṭhātuṃ na vikappetunti.

358.Then the monks thought: “These things that the Blessed One has allowed—the triple robe, the rain-bathing cloth, the sitting cloth, the spread, the plaster-covering cloth, the face-wiping cloth, or the cloth for miscellaneous purposes—should all these be formally resolved upon, or should they be designated?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, the triple robe to be formally resolved upon, not to be designated; the rain-bathing cloth to be formally resolved upon for the four months of the rains, after that to be designated; the sitting cloth to be formally resolved upon, not to be designated; the spread to be formally resolved upon, not to be designated; the plaster-covering cloth to be formally resolved upon until the ailment lasts, after that to be designated; the face-wiping cloth to be formally resolved upon, not to be designated; the cloth for miscellaneous purposes to be formally resolved upon, not to be designated.”

Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kittakaṃ pacchimaṃ nu kho cīvaraṃ vikappetabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, āyāmena aṭṭhaṅgulaṃ sugataṅgulena caturaṅgulavitthataṃ pacchimaṃ cīvaraṃ vikappetunti.

Then the monks thought: “What is the minimum size of a robe that may be designated?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, that a robe to be designated should be eight fingerbreadths in length and four fingerbreadths in width by the Sugata’s fingerbreadth.”

359. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmato mahākassapassa paṃsukūlakato garuko hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, suttalūkhaṃ kātunti. Vikaṇṇo hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, vikaṇṇaṃ uddharitunti. Suttā okiriyanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, anuvātaṃ paribhaṇḍaṃ āropetunti.

359.At that time, Venerable Mahākassapa’s rag-robe became heavy. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, to make a coarse stitch.” It became distorted. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, to trim the distorted part.” The threads came loose. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, to attach an edging strip along the warp.”

Tena kho pana samayena saṅghāṭiyā pattā lujjanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, aṭṭhapadakaṃ kātunti.

At that time, the patches of the outer robe were coming loose. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, to make an eight-patch design.”

360. Tena kho pana samayena aññatarassa bhikkhuno ticīvare kayiramāne sabbaṃ chinnakaṃ nappahoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, dve chinnakāni ekaṃ acchinnakanti.

360.At that time, while a certain monk was making his triple robe, he did not have enough cut pieces for the whole. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, that two cut pieces may be treated as one uncut piece.”

Dve chinnakāni ekaṃ acchinnakaṃ nappahoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, dve acchinnakāni ekaṃ chinnakanti.

Even if two cut pieces were treated as one uncut piece, it was not enough. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, that two uncut pieces may be treated as one cut piece.”

Dve acchinnakāni ekaṃ chinnakaṃ nappahoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, anvādhikampi āropetuṃ, na ca, bhikkhave, sabbaṃ acchinnakaṃ dhāretabbaṃ. Yo dhāreyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

Even if two uncut pieces were treated as one cut piece, it was not enough. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, to add a supplementary piece. But, monks, an entire robe should not be made of uncut pieces. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong conduct.”

361. Tena kho pana samayena aññatarassa bhikkhuno bahuṃ cīvaraṃ uppannaṃ hoti. So ca taṃ cīvaraṃ mātāpitūnaṃ dātukāmo hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Mātāpitaroti [mātāpitūnaṃ kho (sī.)] kho, bhikkhave, dadamāne [vadamāno (ka.), vadamāne (?)] kiṃ vadeyyāma? Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, mātāpitūnaṃ dātuṃ. Na ca, bhikkhave, saddhādeyyaṃ vinipātetabbaṃ. Yo vinipāteyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

361.At that time, a certain monk had acquired much robe-cloth, and he wished to give it to his parents. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, what should we say about giving to parents? I allow, monks, giving to parents. But, monks, an offering based on faith should not be wasted. Whoever wastes it commits an offense of wrong conduct.”

362. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu andhavane cīvaraṃ nikkhipitvā santaruttarena gāmaṃ piṇḍāya pāvisi. Corā taṃ cīvaraṃ avahariṃsu. So bhikkhu duccoḷo hoti lūkhacīvaro. Bhikkhū evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘kissa tvaṃ, āvuso, duccoḷo lūkhacīvarosī’’ti? ‘‘Idhāhaṃ [so ahaṃ (katthaci)], āvuso, andhavane cīvaraṃ nikkhipitvā santaruttarena gāmaṃ piṇḍāya pāvisiṃ. Corā taṃ cīvaraṃ avahariṃsu. Tenāhaṃ duccoḷo lūkhacīvaro’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, santaruttarena gāmo pavisitabbo. Yo paviseyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

362.At that time, a certain monk, having left his robe in the Blind Forest, entered the village for alms with only his inner and upper robes. Thieves stole that robe. That monk was poorly dressed, wearing a rough robe. The monks said to him: “Why, friend, are you poorly dressed, wearing a rough robe?” “Here, friends, having left my robe in the Blind Forest, I entered the village for alms with only my inner and upper robes. Thieves stole that robe. That is why I am poorly dressed, wearing a rough robe.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, one should not enter a village with only the inner and upper robes. Whoever enters thus commits an offense of wrong conduct.”

Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā ānando assatiyā santaruttarena gāmaṃ piṇḍāya pāvisi. Bhikkhū āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘nanu, āvuso ānanda, bhagavatā paññattaṃ – ‘na santaruttarena gāmo pavisitabbo’ti? Kissa tvaṃ, āvuso ānanda, santaruttarena gāmaṃ paviṭṭho’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ, āvuso, bhagavatā paññattaṃ – ‘na santaruttarena gāmo pavisitabbo’ti. Api cāhaṃ assatiyā paviṭṭho’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

At that time, Venerable Ānanda, through carelessness, entered the village for alms with only his inner and upper robes. The monks said to Venerable Ānanda, “Friend Ānanda, hasn’t the Blessed One laid down the rule that one should not enter the village with only the inner and upper robes? Why then, friend Ānanda, have you entered the village with only the inner and upper robes?” “It is true, friends, the Blessed One has laid down the rule that one should not enter the village with only the inner and upper robes. But I entered through carelessness.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One.

Pañcime, bhikkhave, paccayā saṅghāṭiyā nikkhepāya – gilāno vā hoti, vassikasaṅketaṃ vā hoti, nadīpāraṃ gantuṃ vā hoti, aggaḷaguttivihāro vā hoti, atthatakathinaṃ vā hoti. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca paccayā saṅghāṭiyā nikkhepāya.

Monks, these are five reasons for setting aside the outer robe: one is sick; or it is the rainy season period; or one needs to go across a river; or there is a monastery with a bolted gate; or the Kathina has been spread. These, monks, are the five reasons for setting aside the outer robe.

Pañcime, bhikkhave, paccayā uttarāsaṅgassa nikkhepāya…pe… antaravāsakassa nikkhepāya – gilāno vā hoti, vassikasaṅketaṃ vā hoti, nadīpāraṃ gantuṃ vā hoti, aggaḷaguttivihāro vā hoti, atthatakathinaṃ vā hoti. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca paccayā uttarāsaṅgassa antaravāsakassa nikkhepāya.

Monks, these are five reasons for setting aside the upper robe… or the inner robe: one is sick; or it is the rainy season period; or one needs to go across a river; or there is a monastery with a bolted gate; or the Kathina has been spread. These, monks, are the five reasons for setting aside the upper robe or the inner robe.

Pañcime, bhikkhave, paccayā vassikasāṭikāya nikkhepāya – gilāno vā hoti, nissīmaṃ gantuṃ vā hoti, nadīpāraṃ gantuṃ vā hoti, aggaḷaguttivihāro vā hoti, vassikasāṭikā akatā vā hoti vippakatā vā. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca paccayā vassikasāṭikāya nikkhepāyāti.

Monks, these are five reasons for setting aside the rain-bathing cloth: one is sick; or one needs to go beyond the boundary; or one needs to go across a river; or there is a monastery with a bolted gate; or the rain-bathing cloth is not made or is unfinished. These, monks, are the five reasons for setting aside the rain-bathing cloth.

222.Account of the Arising of Robes Belonging to the Saṅgha

363. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu eko vassaṃ vasi. Tattha manussā saṅghassa demāti cīvarāni adaṃsu. Atha kho tassa bhikkhuno etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā paññattaṃ ‘catuvaggo pacchimo saṅgho’ti. Ahañcamhi ekako. Ime ca manussā saṅghassa demāti cīvarāni adaṃsu. Yaṃnūnāhaṃ imāni saṅghikāni cīvarāni sāvatthiṃ hareyya’’nti. Atha kho so bhikkhu tāni cīvarāni ādāya sāvatthiṃ gantvā bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesi. ‘‘Tuyheva, bhikkhu, tāni cīvarāni yāva kathinassa ubbhārāyā’’ti. Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu eko vassaṃ vasati. Tattha manussā saṅghassa demāti cīvarāni denti. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, tasseva tāni cīvarāni yāva kathinassa ubbhārāyāti.

363.At that time, a certain monk spent the rains residence alone. There, people gave robes, saying, "We give these to the Saṅgha." Then that monk thought: "The Blessed One has laid down that ‘a Saṅgha of four is the minimum.’ But I am alone. And these people have given robes, saying, ‘We give these to the Saṅgha.’ What if I were to take these robes belonging to the Saṅgha to Sāvatthī?" So that monk took those robes and went to Sāvatthī, where he reported the matter to the Blessed One. "The robes are yours, monk, until the raising of the Kathina." "Here, monks, a monk spends the rains residence alone. There, people give robes, saying, 'We give these to the Saṅgha.' I allow, monks, that those robes belong to him until the raising of the Kathina."

Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu utukālaṃ eko vasi. Tattha manussā saṅghassa demāti cīvarāni adaṃsu. Atha kho tassa bhikkhuno etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā paññattaṃ ‘catuvaggo pacchimo saṅgho’ti. Ahañcamhi ekako. Ime ca manussā saṅghassa demāti cīvarāni adaṃsu. Yaṃnūnāhaṃ imāni saṅghikāni cīvarāni sāvatthiṃ hareyya’’nti. Atha kho so bhikkhu tāni cīvarāni ādāya sāvatthiṃ gantvā bhikkhūnaṃ etamatthaṃ ārocesi. Bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sammukhībhūtena saṅghena bhājetuṃ. Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu utukālaṃ eko vasati. Tattha manussā saṅghassa demāti cīvarāni denti. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, tena bhikkhunā tāni cīvarāni adhiṭṭhātuṃ – ‘‘mayhimāni cīvarānī’’ti. Tassa ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno taṃ cīvaraṃ anadhiṭṭhite añño bhikkhu āgacchati, samako dātabbo bhāgo. Tehi ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi taṃ cīvaraṃ bhājiyamāne, apātite kuse, añño bhikkhu āgacchati, samako dātabbo bhāgo. Tehi ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi taṃ cīvaraṃ bhājiyamāne, pātite kuse, añño bhikkhu āgacchati, nākāmā dātabbo bhāgoti.

At that time, a certain monk was staying alone during the season. There, people gave robes, saying, "We give these to the Saṅgha." Then that monk thought: "The Blessed One has laid down that ‘a Saṅgha of four is the minimum.’ But I am alone. And these people have given robes, saying, ‘We give these to the Saṅgha.’ What if I were to take these robes belonging to the Saṅgha to Sāvatthī?" Then that monk took those robes and went to Sāvatthī, where he informed the monks of the matter. The monks informed the Blessed One of the matter. "I allow, monks, for the Saṅgha that is present to divide them. Here, monks, a monk stays alone during the season. There, people give robes, saying, 'We give these to the Saṅgha.' I allow, monks, that monk to take possession of those robes, declaring, 'These robes are mine.' If, monks, while that monk has not taken possession of that robe, another monk arrives, an equal share should be given. If, monks, while those monks are dividing that robe, before the lot has been cast, another monk arrives, an equal share should be given. If, monks, while those monks are dividing that robe, after the lot has been cast, another monk arrives, a share need not be given if they are unwilling."

Tena kho pana samayena dve bhātikā therā, āyasmā ca isidāso āyasmā ca isibhaṭo, sāvatthiyaṃ vassaṃvuṭṭhā aññataraṃ gāmakāvāsaṃ agamaṃsu. Manussā cirassāpi therā āgatāti sacīvarāni bhattāni adaṃsu. Āvāsikā bhikkhū there pucchiṃsu – ‘‘imāni, bhante, saṅghikāni cīvarāni there āgamma uppannāni, sādiyissanti therā bhāga’’nti. Therā evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘yathā kho mayaṃ, āvuso, bhagavatā dhammaṃ desitaṃ ājānāma, tumhākaṃyeva tāni cīvarāni yāva kathinassa ubbhārāyā’’ti.

At that time, two elder monks who were brothers, the Venerable Isidāsa and the Venerable Isibhaṭa, having spent the rains residence in Sāvatthī, went to a certain village dwelling. The people, seeing the elders after a long time, gave meals accompanied by robes. The resident monks asked the elders, "Venerable sirs, these robes belonging to the Saṅgha have arisen because of the elders' arrival. Will the elders accept a share?" The elders replied, "Friends, as we understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those robes are yours until the removal of the Kathina."

Tena kho pana samayena tayo bhikkhū rājagahe vassaṃ vasanti. Tattha manussā saṅghassa

At that time, three monks were spending the rains residence in Rājagaha. There, people were giving robes to the Saṅgha.

Demāti cīvarāni denti. Atha kho tesaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā paññattaṃ ‘catuvaggo pacchimo saṅgho’ti. Mayañcamhā tayo janā. Ime ca manussā saṅghassa demāti cīvarāni denti. Kathaṃ nu kho amhehi paṭipajjitabba’’nti? Tena kho pana samayena sambahulā therā, āyasmā ca nilavāsī āyasmā ca sāṇavāsī āyasmā ca gotako āyasmā ca bhagu āyasmā ca phaḷikasantāno, pāṭaliputte viharanti kukkuṭārāme. Atha kho te bhikkhū pāṭaliputtaṃ gantvā there pucchiṃsu. Therā evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘yathā kho mayaṃ āvuso bhagavatā dhammaṃ desitaṃ ājānāma, tumhākaṃyeva tāni cīvarāni yāva kathinassa ubbhārāyā’’ti.

They gave robes, saying, 'We give these to the Saṅgha.' Then those monks had this thought: "The Blessed One has laid down that ‘the Saṅgha is complete with four.’ But we are only three people. These people are giving robes, saying, ‘to the Saṅgha.’ How should we proceed?" At that time, several elders were staying at the Kukkuṭārāma in Pāṭaliputta—the Venerable Nilavāsī, the Venerable Sāṇavāsī, the Venerable Gotako, the Venerable Bhagu, and the Venerable Phaḷikasantāno. Then those monks went to Pāṭaliputta and asked the elders. The elders replied, "Friends, as we understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those robes are yours until the removal of the Kathina."

223.The Story of Upananda the Sakyan

364. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā upanando sakyaputto sāvatthiyaṃ vassaṃvuṭṭho aññataraṃ gāmakāvāsaṃ agamāsi. Tattha ca bhikkhū cīvaraṃ bhājetukāmā sannipatiṃsu.

Tatthapi bhikkhū cīvaraṃ bhājetukāmā sannipatiṃsu. Tepi evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘imāni kho, āvuso, saṅghikāni cīvarāni bhājiyissanti, sādiyissasi bhāga’’nti? ‘‘Āmāvuso, sādiyissāmī’’ti.

Yo sādiyeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

364.At that time the Venerable Upananda the Sakyan, having completed the rains retreat in Sāvatthī, went to stay in a certain village dwelling. There, monks gathered intending to distribute robes. They said to him, “Friend, these are the Sangha’s robes to be distributed. Will you accept a share?” “Yes, friends, I will accept,” he replied. Then, having accepted a share of the robes, he went to another residence. There too, monks gathered intending to distribute robes. They also said to him, “Friend, these are the Sangha’s robes to be distributed. Will you accept a share?” “Yes, friends, I will accept,” he replied. There too, he accepted a share of the robes and went to another residence. There again, monks gathered intending to distribute robes. They also said to him, “Friend, these are the Sangha’s robes to be distributed. Will you accept a share?” “Yes, friends, I will accept,” he replied. There too, he accepted a share of the robes, took up a large bundle of robes, and returned to Sāvatthī. The monks said to him, “You have much merit, friend Upananda, for many robes have accrued to you.” “How is there merit for me, friends? Here, I completed the rains retreat in Sāvatthī and went to stay in a certain village dwelling. There, monks gathered intending to distribute robes. They said to me, ‘Friend, these are the Sangha’s robes to be distributed. Will you accept a share?’ ‘Yes, friends, I will accept,’ I replied. Then, having accepted a share of the robes, I went to another residence. There too, monks gathered intending to distribute robes. They also said to me, ‘Friend, these are the Sangha’s robes to be distributed. Will you accept a share?’ ‘Yes, friends, I will accept,’ I replied. There too, I accepted a share of the robes and went to another residence. There again, monks gathered intending to distribute robes. They also said to me, ‘Friend, these are the Sangha’s robes to be distributed. Will you accept a share?’ ‘Yes, friends, I will accept,’ I replied. There too, I accepted a share of the robes. Thus many robes accrued to me.” “But, friend Upananda, did you accept a share of robes elsewhere, having completed the rains retreat elsewhere?” “Yes, friends,” he replied. Those monks who were modest… complained, grumbled, and criticized him, “How could the Venerable Upananda the Sakyan accept a share of robes elsewhere, having completed the rains retreat elsewhere?” They reported the matter to the Blessed One. The Blessed One then asked: “Is it true, Upananda, that you accepted a share of robes elsewhere, having completed the rains retreat elsewhere?” “It is true, Blessed One,” he replied. The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked him… “Foolish man, how could you accept a share of robes elsewhere, having completed the rains retreat elsewhere? This, foolish man, is not for the confidence of those without it… Having rebuked him… and given a Dhamma talk, the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks, one should not accept a share of robes elsewhere, having completed the rains retreat elsewhere. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong-doing.”

Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā upanando sakyaputto eko dvīsu āvāsesu vassaṃ vasi – ‘‘evaṃ me bahuṃ cīvaraṃ uppajjissatī’’ti. Atha kho tesaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kathaṃ nu kho āyasmato upanandassa sakyaputtassa cīvarapaṭivīso dātabbo’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Detha, bhikkhave, moghapurisassa ekādhippāyaṃ. Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu eko dvīsu āvāsesu vassaṃ vasati – ‘‘evaṃ me bahuṃ cīvaraṃ uppajjissatī’’ti.

At that time the Venerable Upananda the Sakyan spent the rains retreat in two residences, thinking: “Thus many robes will accrue to me.” Then those monks had this thought: “How should the robe share be given to the Venerable Upananda the Sakyan?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Give, monks, to that foolish man a single share. Here, monks, a monk spends the rains retreat in two residences, thinking: ‘Thus many robes will accrue to me.’ If he dwells half the time in one and half in the other, half the robe share should be given from one and half from the other. Or wherever he dwells longer, the robe share should be given from there.”

The Story of Upananda the Sakyan is concluded.

224.The Account of the Sick.

365. Tena kho pana samayena aññatarassa bhikkhuno kucchivikārābādho hoti. So sake muttakarīse palipanno seti. Atha kho bhagavā āyasmatā ānandena pacchāsamaṇena senāsanacārikaṃ āhiṇḍanto yena tassa bhikkhuno vihāro tenupasaṅkami.

Bhagavā udakaṃ āsiñci. Āyasmā ānando paridhovi. Bhagavā sīsato aggahesi. Āyasmā ānando pādato uccāretvā mañcake nipātesuṃ. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā bhikkhū paṭipucchi – ‘‘atthi, bhikkhave, amukasmiṃ vihāre bhikkhu gilāno’’ti? ‘‘Atthi, bhagavā’’ti. ‘‘Kiṃ tassa, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno ābādho’’ti? ‘‘Tassa, bhante, āyasmato kucchivikārābādho’’ti. ‘‘Atthi pana, bhikkhave, tassa bhikkhuno upaṭṭhāko’’ti? ‘‘Natthi, bhagavā’’ti. ‘‘Kissa taṃ bhikkhū na upaṭṭhentī’’ti? ‘‘Eso, bhante, bhikkhu bhikkhūnaṃ akārako; tena taṃ bhikkhū na upaṭṭhentī’’ti. ‘‘Natthi vo, bhikkhave, mātā, natthi pitā, ye vo upaṭṭhaheyyuṃ. Tumhe ce, bhikkhave, aññamaññaṃ na upaṭṭhahissatha, atha ko carahi upaṭṭhahissati? Yo, bhikkhave, maṃ upaṭṭhaheyya so gilānaṃ upaṭṭhaheyya. Sace upajjhāyo hoti, upajjhāyena yāvajīvaṃ upaṭṭhātabbo; vuṭṭhānamassa āgametabbaṃ. Sace ācariyo hoti, ācariyena yāvajīvaṃ upaṭṭhātabbo; vuṭṭhānamassa āgametabbaṃ.

365.Now at that time a certain bhikkhu was suffering from a stomach ailment. He lay wallowing in his own urine and feces. Then the Blessed One, wandering on a tour of the lodgings with Venerable Ānanda as his attendant, approached that bhikkhu’s dwelling. The Blessed One saw that bhikkhu lying wallowing in his own urine and feces. Seeing him, he went up to him and said, “What’s wrong, bhikkhu?” “I have a stomach ailment, Venerable Sir.” “But bhikkhu, do you have an attendant?” “No, Venerable Sir.” “Why don’t the bhikkhus attend to you?” “Because I’m of no service to the bhikkhus, Venerable Sir. That’s why they don’t attend to me.” Then the Blessed One addressed Venerable Ānanda, “Go, Ānanda, fetch some water. We’ll bathe this bhikkhu.” “Yes, Venerable Sir,” replied Ānanda, and he fetched water. The Blessed One poured the water, and Venerable Ānanda washed the bhikkhu. The Blessed One lifted him by the head, and Venerable Ānanda lifted him by the feet. They laid him on a bed. Then, on that occasion, the Blessed One had the Saṅgha of bhikkhus assembled and questioned the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, is there a sick bhikkhu in a certain dwelling?” “Yes, Venerable Sir.” “What is wrong with that bhikkhu?” “He has a stomach ailment, Venerable Sir.” “Does that bhikkhu have an attendant?” “No, Venerable Sir.” “Why don’t the bhikkhus attend to him?” “Because that bhikkhu is of no service to the bhikkhus, Venerable Sir. That’s why they don’t attend to him.” “Bhikkhus, you have no mother or father to look after you. If you don’t look after one another, who then will look after you? Whoever would tend to me should tend to the sick. If he has a preceptor, the preceptor should tend to him for life, awaiting his recovery. If he has a teacher, the teacher should tend to him for life, awaiting his recovery. If he has a fellow resident, the fellow resident should tend to him for life, awaiting his recovery. If he has a pupil, the pupil should tend to him for life, awaiting his recovery. If he has a co-resident under the same preceptor, the co-resident should tend to him for life, awaiting his recovery. If he has a co-resident under the same teacher, the co-resident should tend to him for life, awaiting his recovery. If he has neither a preceptor, teacher, fellow resident, pupil, co-resident under the same preceptor, nor co-resident under the same teacher, the Saṅgha should tend to him. If they don’t, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

366. Pañcahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgato gilāno dūpaṭṭho hoti – asappāyakārī hoti, sappāye mattaṃ na jānāti, bhesajjaṃ na paṭisevitā hoti, atthakāmassa gilānupaṭṭhākassa yathābhūtaṃ ābādhaṃ nāvikattā hoti ‘abhikkamantaṃ vā abhikkamatīti, paṭikkamantaṃ vā paṭikkamatīti, ṭhitaṃ vā ṭhito’ti, uppannānaṃ sārīrikānaṃ vedanānaṃ dukkhānaṃ tibbānaṃ kharānaṃ kaṭukānaṃ asātānaṃ amanāpānaṃ pāṇaharānaṃ anadhivāsakajātiko hoti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgato gilāno dūpaṭṭho hoti.

366.“Monks, a sick person endowed with five qualities is difficult to attend to: they engage in unsuitable activities; do not know moderation in what is suitable; do not take medicine; do not truthfully reveal their illness to a caregiver who wishes for their welfare, saying whether it is increasing or decreasing or staying the same; and are not one who endures arisen bodily feelings that are painful, sharp, racking, bitter, uncongenial, disagreeable, and life-threatening. Monks, a sick person endowed with these five qualities is difficult to attend to.”

Pañcahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgato gilāno sūpaṭṭho hoti – sappāyakārī hoti, sappāye mattaṃ jānāti, bhesajjaṃ paṭisevitā hoti, atthakāmassa gilānupaṭṭhākassa yathābhūtaṃ ābādhaṃ āvikattā hoti ‘abhikkamantaṃ vā abhikkamatīti, paṭikkamantaṃ vā paṭikkamatīti, ṭhitaṃ vā ṭhito’ti, uppannānaṃ sārīrikānaṃ vedanānaṃ dukkhānaṃ tibbānaṃ kharānaṃ kaṭukānaṃ asātānaṃ amanāpānaṃ pāṇaharānaṃ adhivāsakajātiko hoti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgato gilāno sūpaṭṭho hoti.

“Monks, a sick person endowed with five factors is easy to tend to: they engage in things that are agreeable, know moderation in agreeable things, take medicine, truthfully inform the attendant who desires their welfare about their illness—whether it is increasing or decreasing or remaining static—and are one who endures arisen bodily feelings that are painful, acute, sharp, severe, uncongenial, disagreeable, and life-threatening. Monks, a sick person endowed with these five factors is easy to tend to.”

Pañcahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgato gilānupaṭṭhāko nālaṃ gilānaṃ upaṭṭhātuṃ – na paṭibalo hoti bhesajjaṃ saṃvidhātuṃ, sappāyāsappāyaṃ na jānāti, asappāyaṃ upanāmeti sappāyaṃ apanāmeti, āmisantaro gilānaṃ upaṭṭhāti no mettacitto, jegucchī hoti uccāraṃ vā passāvaṃ vā kheḷaṃ vā vantaṃ vā nīhātuṃ, na paṭibalo hoti gilānaṃ kālena kālaṃ dhammiyā kathāya sandassetuṃ samādapetuṃ samuttejetuṃ sampahaṃsetuṃ. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgato gilānupaṭṭhāko nālaṃ gilānaṃ upaṭṭhātuṃ.

“Monks, a caregiver endowed with five qualities is unfit to care for a sick person: they are unable to prepare medicine, do not know what is beneficial and what is not, administer what is not beneficial and remove what is beneficial, attend to the sick person with material motives rather than a mind of loving-kindness, are disgusted at removing feces, urine, spittle, or vomit, and are unable to instruct, encourage, inspire, and gladden the sick person from time to time with a Dhamma talk. Monks, a caregiver endowed with these five qualities is unfit to care for a sick person.”

Pañcahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgato gilānupaṭṭhāko alaṃ gilānaṃ upaṭṭhātuṃ – paṭibalo hoti bhesajjaṃ saṃvidhātuṃ, sappāyāsappāyaṃ jānāti, asappāyaṃ apanāmeti sappāyaṃ upanāmeti, mettacitto gilānaṃ upaṭṭhāti no āmisantaro, ajegucchī hoti uccāraṃ vā passāvaṃ vā kheḷaṃ vā vantaṃ vā nīhātuṃ, paṭibalo hoti gilānaṃ kālena kālaṃ dhammiyā kathāya sandassetuṃ samādapetuṃ samuttejetuṃ sampahaṃsetuṃ. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgato gilānupaṭṭhāko alaṃ gilānaṃ upaṭṭhātunti.

“Monks, a caregiver endowed with five qualities is fit to care for a patient: they are able to procure medicine, know what is beneficial and not beneficial, remove what is not beneficial and introduce what is beneficial, attend to the patient with a mind of loving-kindness and not for material gain, are not disgusted to remove feces or urine or saliva or vomit, and are able to instruct, encourage, embolden, and cheer up the patient from time to time with a Dhamma talk. Monks, a caregiver endowed with these five qualities is fit to care for a patient.”

Gilānavatthukathā niṭṭhitā.

The Account of the Sick is concluded.

225.The Chapter on the Belongings of the Deceased.

367. Tena kho pana samayena dve bhikkhū kosalesu janapade addhānamaggappaṭipannā honti. Te aññataraṃ āvāsaṃ upagacchiṃsu. Tattha aññataro bhikkhu gilāno hoti.

Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

367.At that time, two monks were traveling on a road in the Kosala country. They arrived at a certain monastery. There, one monk was sick. Then those monks thought: “Friends, the Blessed One has praised the nursing of the sick. Come, friends, let us nurse this monk.” They nursed him. While being nursed by them, he passed away. Then those monks took that monk’s bowl and robes and went to Savatthi, where they reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, when a monk has passed away, the Saṅgha is the owner of his bowl and robes; moreover, those who nurse the sick are very helpful. I allow, monks, the Saṅgha to give the set of three robes and the bowl to those who nurse the sick. And this is how it should be given: The monk who nursed the sick should approach the Saṅgha and say: ‘Venerable sirs, the monk named so-and-so has passed away. This is his set of three robes and bowl.’ A competent monk should then inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Itthannāmo bhikkhu kālaṅkato. Idaṃ tassa ticīvarañca patto ca. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho imaṃ ticīvarañca pattañca gilānupaṭṭhākānaṃ dadeyya. Esā ñatti.

“Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. The monk named so-and-so has passed away. These are his set of three robes and bowl. If it seems fit to the Saṅgha, may the Saṅgha give these set of three robes and bowl to those who nurse the sick. This is the motion.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Itthannāmo bhikkhu kālaṅkato. Idaṃ tassa ticīvarañca patto ca. Saṅgho imaṃ ticīvarañca pattañca gilānupaṭṭhākānaṃ deti. Yassāyasmato khamati imassa ticīvarassa ca pattassa ca gilānupaṭṭhākānaṃ dānaṃ, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. The monk named so-and-so has passed away. These are his set of three robes and bowl. The Saṅgha gives these set of three robes and bowl to those who nurse the sick. If it seems fit to the venerable ones that these set of three robes and bowl be given to those who nurse the sick, let them remain silent; if it does not seem fit to anyone, let them speak.

‘‘Dinnaṃ idaṃ saṅghena ticīvarañca patto ca gilānupaṭṭhākānaṃ. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

This set of three robes and bowl has been given by the Saṅgha to those who nurse the sick. The Saṅgha approves of it, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.”

368. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro sāmaṇero kālaṅkato hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Sāmaṇerassa, bhikkhave, kālaṅkate saṅgho sāmī pattacīvare, api ca gilānupaṭṭhākā bahūpakārā.

Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

368.At that time, a certain novice had passed away. They informed the Blessed One of this matter. “Monks, when a novice has passed away, the Saṅgha is the owner of his robe and bowl; but those who nursed him were very helpful. I allow, monks, the Saṅgha to give the robe and bowl to those who nursed the sick. And this is how it should be given: The monk who nursed the sick should approach the Saṅgha and say: ‘Venerable sirs, the novice named so-and-so has passed away.

“This robe and bowl have been given by the Saṅgha to those who nurse the sick. The Saṅgha approves of it, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.”

369. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu ca sāmaṇero ca gilānaṃ upaṭṭhahiṃsu. So tehi upaṭṭhahiyamāno kālamakāsi. Atha kho tassa gilānupaṭṭhākassa bhikkhuno etadahosi – ‘‘kathaṃ nu kho gilānupaṭṭhākassa sāmaṇerassa cīvarapaṭivīso dātabbo’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, gilānupaṭṭhākassa sāmaṇerassa samakaṃ paṭivīsaṃ dātunti.

369.At that time, a certain monk and a novice were nursing a sick person. While being nursed by them, that person passed away. Then this thought occurred to the monk who had nursed the sick: “How should a share of robes be given to the novice who nursed the sick?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, that an equal share be given to the novice who nursed the sick.”

Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu bahubhaṇḍo bahuparikkhāro kālaṅkato hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

At that time, a certain monk with many possessions and much equipment had passed away. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, when a monk has passed away, the Saṅgha is the owner of his bowl and robes; but those who nurse the sick are very helpful. I allow, monks, the Saṅgha to give the set of three robes and the bowl to those who nurse the sick. Whatever light possessions and equipment there are, that should be distributed by the Saṅgha present. Whatever heavy possessions and equipment there are, that is not to be relinquished or divided, but is for the Saṅgha of the four directions, both those who have come and those who have not yet come.”

226.Account of the Rejection of Nudity

370. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu naggo hutvā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘bhagavā, bhante, anekapariyāyena appicchassa santuṭṭhassa sallekhassa dhutassa pāsādikassa apacayassa vīriyārambhassa vaṇṇavādī. Idaṃ, bhante, naggiyaṃ anekapariyāyena appicchatāya santuṭṭhitāya sallekhāya dhutatāya [dhutattāya (ka.)] pāsādikatāya apacayāya vīriyārambhāya saṃvattati.

Yo samādiyeyya, āpatti thullaccayassā’’ti.

370.At that time, a certain monk, being naked, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, the Blessed One praises in many ways one who is of few desires, content, of austere practices, of purified conduct, inspiring confidence, modest, and energetic. Venerable sir, this nudity leads in many ways to fewness of desires, contentment, austere practices, purified conduct, inspiring confidence, modesty, and energetic striving. It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would allow nudity for the monks." The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked him: "Foolish man, this is unsuitable, improper, unbecoming, unworthy of a recluse, impermissible, not to be done. How can you, foolish man, undertake the sectarian practice of nudity? This, foolish man, is not for the conversion of the unconverted, nor for the increase of the converted..." Having rebuked him and given a Dhamma talk, he addressed the monks: "Monks, the sectarian practice of nudity should not be undertaken. Whoever undertakes it commits an offense of thullaccaya."

371.At that time, a certain monk, having dressed in a grass robe… having dressed in a bark robe… having dressed in a wooden-chip robe… having dressed in a hair blanket… having dressed in a horsehair blanket… having dressed in an owl’s-wing robe… having dressed in an antelope hide, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the Blessed One praises in many ways one who is of few desires, content, of austere practices, of purified conduct, inspiring confidence, modest, and energetic. Venerable sir, this antelope hide leads in many ways to fewness of desires, contentment, austere practices, purified conduct, inspiring confidence, modesty, and energetic striving. It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would allow the monks to wear an antelope hide.” The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked him: “Foolish man, this is unsuitable, improper, unbecoming, unworthy of a recluse, impermissible, not to be done. How can you, foolish man, wear an antelope hide, the banner of sectarians? This, foolish man, is not for the conversion of the unconverted, nor for the increase of the converted...” Having rebuked him… he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, one should not wear an antelope hide, the banner of sectarians. Whoever wears it commits an offense of thullaccaya.”

At that time, a certain monk, having dressed in a reed garment… having dressed in a bark-cloth, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the Blessed One praises in many ways one who is of few desires, content, of austere practices, of purified conduct, inspiring confidence, modest, and energetic. Venerable sir, this bark-cloth leads in many ways to fewness of desires, contentment, austere practices, purified conduct, inspiring confidence, modesty, and energetic striving. It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would allow the monks to wear a bark-cloth.” The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked him: “Foolish man, this is unsuitable, improper, unbecoming, unworthy of a recluse, impermissible, not to be done. How can you, foolish man, dress in a bark-cloth? This, foolish man, is not for the conversion of the unconverted, nor for the increase of the converted...” Having rebuked him… he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, a bark-cloth should not be worn. Whoever wears it commits an offense of dukkaṭa.”

372.At that time, the group-of-six monks were wearing robes that were entirely blue, entirely yellow, entirely red, entirely madder-colored, entirely black, entirely deep-orange, entirely indigo; robes with unfringed edges, with long fringes, with flower-like fringes, with snake-hood fringes; they were wearing jackets, bark caps, and head-wraps. People complained, criticized, and spread it about: “How can these Sakyan ascetics wear head-wraps, just like householders indulging in sensual pleasures?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, robes that are entirely blue, entirely yellow, entirely red, entirely madder-colored, entirely black, entirely deep-orange, or entirely indigo should not be worn; nor should robes with unfringed edges, with long fringes, with flower-like fringes, or with snake-hood fringes be worn; nor should jackets, bark caps, or head-wraps be worn. Whoever wears them commits an offense of wrong-doing.”

379. Aṭṭhimā, bhikkhave, mātikā cīvarassa uppādāya – sīmāya deti, katikāya deti, bhikkhāpaññattiyā deti, saṅghassa deti, ubhatosaṅghassa deti, vassaṃvuṭṭhasaṅghassa deti, ādissa deti, puggalassa deti.

379.Bhikkhus, there are these eight topics for the acquisition of robes: one gives at the boundary, one gives by agreement, one gives by arrangement for alms, one gives to the Sangha, one gives to both Sanghas, one gives to the Sangha that has spent the rains, one gives designating, one gives to an individual.

Sīmāya deti – yāvatikā bhikkhū antosīmagatā tehi bhājetabbaṃ. Katikāya deti – sambahulā āvāsā samānalābhā honti ekasmiṃ āvāse dinne sabbattha dinnaṃ hoti. Bhikkhāpaññattiyā deti, yattha saṅghassa dhuvakārā kariyyanti, tattha deti. Saṅghassa deti, sammukhībhūtena saṅghena bhājetabbaṃ. Ubhatosaṅghassa deti, bahukāpi bhikkhū honti, ekā bhikkhunī hoti, upaḍḍhaṃ dātabbaṃ, bahukāpi bhikkhuniyo honti, eko bhikkhu hoti, upaḍḍhaṃ dātabbaṃ. Vassaṃvuṭṭhasaṅghassa deti, yāvatikā bhikkhū tasmiṃ āvāse vassaṃvuṭṭhā, tehi bhājetabbaṃ. Ādissa deti, yāguyā vā bhatte vā khādanīye vā cīvare vā senāsane vā bhesajje vā. Puggalassa deti, ‘‘imaṃ cīvaraṃ itthannāmassa dammī’’ti.

Giving at the boundary means it should be shared by as many bhikkhus as are within the boundary. Giving by agreement means several monasteries have equal shares, and giving in one monastery is considered giving in all. Giving by arrangement for alms means giving where the Sangha's regular duties are carried out. Giving to the Sangha means it should be distributed by the Sangha in its presence. Giving to both Sanghas means if there are many bhikkhus and one bhikkhunī, half should be given; if there are many bhikkhunīs and one bhikkhu, half should be given. Giving to the Sangha that has completed the rains retreat means it should be shared by as many bhikkhus as have completed the rains retreat in that monastery. Giving by designation means giving for gruel, meals, edibles, robes, lodging, or medicine. Giving to an individual means, "I give this robe to so-and-so."

233.Summary

Rājagahako negamo, disvā vesāliyaṃ gaṇiṃ;Puna rājagahaṃ gantvā, rañño taṃ paṭivedayi.

A townsman from Rājagaha, having seen the group in Vesālī; returning again to Rājagaha, he reported it to the king.

Putto sālavatikāya, abhayassa hi atrajo;Jīvatīti kumārena, saṅkhāto jīvako iti.

The son of Sālavatī, Abhaya's own son, was named Jīvaka by the prince because he said, 'He lives.'

So hi takkasīlaṃ gantvā, uggahetvā mahābhiso;Sattavassikaābādhaṃ, natthukammena nāsayi.

Having gone to Takkasila, and having learned to be a great physician, he eliminated a seven-year disease with nasal medication.

Rañño bhagandalābādhaṃ, ālepena apākaḍḍhi;Mamañca itthāgārañca, buddhasaṅghaṃ cupaṭṭhahi.

He relieved the king’s fistula with a medicinal paste; and he attended to me, the women's quarters, and the Sangha.

Rājagahako ca seṭṭhi, antagaṇṭhi tikicchitaṃ;Pajjotassa mahārogaṃ, ghatapānena nāsayi.

The merchant of Rājagaha treated Antagaṇṭhi's illness; he cured Pajjota's great disease with a drink of ghee.

Adhikārañca siveyyaṃ, abhisannaṃ sinehati;Tīhi uppalahatthehi, samattiṃsavirecanaṃ.

He should sew the robe, and moisten what is too stiff; With three handfuls of uppala, he purges the thirty.

Pakatattaṃ varaṃ yāci, siveyyañca paṭiggahi;Cīvarañca gihidānaṃ, anuññāsi tathāgato.

He requested the best (cloth) that was ready-made, and accepted sewing; The Tathagata permitted the householder's gift of robes and cloth.

Rājagahe janapade bahuṃ, uppajji cīvaraṃ;Pāvāro kosiyañceva, kojavo aḍḍhakāsikaṃ.

In the Rajagaha country, much cloth arose: Pavara, Kosiya, and Kojava, half a Kasi measure.

Uccāvacā ca santuṭṭhi, nāgamesāgamesuṃ ca;Paṭhamaṃ pacchā sadisā, katikā ca paṭiharuṃ.

High and low contentment, they did not go to and fro in villages and towns; First and last alike, they rejected the agreement.

Bhaṇḍāgāraṃ aguttañca, vuṭṭhāpenti tatheva ca;Ussannaṃ kolāhalañca, kathaṃ bhāje kathaṃ dade.

The unguarded storeroom, they also emptied; Crowded and noisy, how to divide, how to give?

Sakātirekabhāgena, paṭivīso kathaṃ dade;Chakaṇena sītudakā [sītundī ca (sī.), sītuṇhi ca (katthaci)], uttaritu na jānare.

With their own superior portion, how to give a share; With a handful of cold water, they did not know how to cross over.

Āropentā bhājanañca, pātiyā ca chamāya ca;Upacikāmajjhe jīranti, ekato patthinnena ca.

They lifted the bowl and the plate from the ground; In the middle of the anthill they decayed, stretched out on one side.

Pharusācchinnacchibandhā, addasāsi ubbhaṇḍite;Vīmaṃsitvā sakyamuni, anuññāsi ticīvaraṃ.

Harsh, torn, with cut-off bindings, he saw them cast aside; Having investigated, the Sakyan sage allowed three robes.

Aññena atirekena, uppajji chiddameva ca;Cātuddīpo varaṃ yāci, dātuṃ vassikasāṭikaṃ.

With another excess, holes also arose; The four continents begged a boon, to give the rainy-season robe.

Āgantugamigilānaṃ, upaṭṭhākañca bhesajjaṃ;Dhuvaṃ udakasāṭiñca, paṇītaṃ atikhuddakaṃ.

For incoming sick bhikkhus, attendants, and medicine; Also, a constant water-cloth, fine food, and very small necessities.

Thullakacchumukhaṃ khomaṃ, paripuṇṇaṃ adhiṭṭhānaṃ;Pacchimaṃ kato garuko, vikaṇṇo suttamokiri.

Coarse hempen cloth with a wide opening; Fully determined, the back was heavy, the ear torn, the thread scattered.

Lujjanti nappahonti, ca anvādhikaṃ bahūni ca;Andhavane assatiyā, eko vassaṃ utumhi ca.

They broke apart and did not suffice, and many were excessive; In the blind forest, unmindful, one spent the season.

Dve bhātukā rājagahe, upanando puna dvisu;Kucchivikāro gilāno, ubho ceva gilānakā [gilāyanā (ka.)].

Two brothers in Rajagaha, and again Upananda with two others; Suffering from a stomach ailment, both of them were sick.

Naggā kusā vākacīraṃ, phalako kesakambalaṃ;Vāḷaulūkapakkhañca, ajinaṃ akkanāḷakaṃ.

Naked, wearing grass, bark garments, a plank, or hair blanket; Wolf skin, owl's wings, antelope hide, or reed mat.

Potthakaṃ nīlapītañca, lohitaṃ mañjiṭṭhena ca;Kaṇhā mahāraṅganāma, acchinnadasikā tathā.

Cloth, blue and yellow, and red with madder; black, named Maharanga, and with unbroken fringes.

Dīghapupphaphaṇadasā, kañcutirīṭaveṭhanaṃ;Anuppanne pakkamati, saṅgho bhijjati tāvade.

Long-flowered snake hood, armor, a diadem and turban; When it has not arisen, he departs; the Sangha splits at once.

Pakkhe dadanti saṅghassa, āyasmā revato pahi;Vissāsagāhādhiṭṭhāti, aṭṭha cīvaramātikāti.

They give support to the Sangha, venerable Revata sent; taking them on trust, he determines the eight topics concerning robes.

Imamhi khandhake vatthū channavuti.

In this section, there are ninety-six topics.

Cīvarakkhandhako niṭṭhito.
