1.The Bodhi Story

1. [udā. 1 ādayo] Tena samayena buddho bhagavā uruvelāyaṃ viharati najjā nerañjarāya tīre bodhirukkhamūle paṭhamābhisambuddho. Atha kho bhagavā bodhirukkhamūle sattāhaṃ ekapallaṅkena nisīdi vimuttisukhapaṭisaṃvedī [vimuttisukhaṃ paṭisaṃvedī (ka.)]. Atha kho bhagavā rattiyā paṭhamaṃ yāmaṃ paṭiccasamuppādaṃ anulomapaṭilomaṃ manasākāsi – ‘‘avijjāpaccayā saṅkhārā, saṅkhārapaccayā viññāṇaṃ, viññāṇapaccayā nāmarūpaṃ, nāmarūpapaccayā saḷāyatanaṃ, saḷāyatanapaccayā phasso, phassapaccayā vedanā, vedanāpaccayā taṇhā, taṇhāpaccayā upādānaṃ, upādānapaccayā bhavo, bhavapaccayā jāti, jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇaṃ sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā sambhavanti – evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa samudayo hoti. ‘‘Avijjāyatveva asesavirāganirodhā saṅkhāranirodho, saṅkhāranirodhā viññāṇanirodho, viññāṇanirodhā nāmarūpanirodho, nāmarūpanirodhā saḷāyatananirodho, saḷāyatananirodhā phassanirodho, phassanirodhā vedanānirodho, vedanānirodhā taṇhānirodho, taṇhānirodhā upādānanirodho, upādānanirodhā bhavanirodho, bhavanirodhā jātinirodho, jātinirodhā jarāmaraṇaṃ sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā nirujjhanti – evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa nirodho hotī’’ti.

1. At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Uruvelā, on the bank of the Nerañjarā River, at the foot of the Bodhi tree, having just attained perfect enlightenment. Then the Blessed One sat at the foot of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one posture, experiencing the bliss of liberation. Then, in the first watch of the night, the Blessed One mentally reviewed dependent origination in forward and reverse order: "With ignorance as condition, volitional formations come to be; with volitional formations as condition, consciousness; with consciousness as condition, name-and-form; with name-and-form as condition, the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as condition, contact; with contact as condition, feeling; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging; with clinging as condition, becoming; with becoming as condition, birth; with birth as condition, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair come to be. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations; with the cessation of volitional formations comes cessation of consciousness; with the cessation of consciousness comes cessation of name-and-form; with the cessation of name-and-form comes cessation of the six sense bases; with the cessation of the six sense bases comes cessation of contact; with the cessation of contact comes cessation of feeling; with the cessation of feeling comes cessation of craving; with the cessation of craving comes cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging comes cessation of becoming; with the cessation of becoming comes cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering."

Atha kho bhagavā etamatthaṃ viditvā tāyaṃ velāyaṃ imaṃ udānaṃ udānesi –

Then, when he understood this meaning, on that occasion the Blessed One uttered this solemn utterance:

‘‘Yadā have pātubhavanti dhammā;Ātāpino jhāyato brāhmaṇassa;Athassa kaṅkhā vapayanti sabbā;Yato pajānāti sahetudhamma’’nti.

"When the Dhamma become manifest to the ardent, meditating brahmin, all his doubts vanish, since he understands Dhamma with its cause."

2. [udā. 2] Atha kho bhagavā rattiyā majjhimaṃ yāmaṃ paṭiccasamuppādaṃ anulomapaṭilomaṃ manasākāsi – ‘‘avijjāpaccayā saṅkhārā, saṅkhārapaccayā viññāṇaṃ, viññāṇapaccayā nāmarūpaṃ…pe… evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa samudayo hotī…pe… nirodho hotī’’ti.

2. Then, in the middle watch of the night, the Blessed One mentally reviewed dependent origination in forward and reverse order: "With ignorance as condition, volitional formations come to be; with volitional formations as condition, consciousness; with consciousness as condition, name-and-form… Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering… Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering."

Atha kho bhagavā etamatthaṃ viditvā tāyaṃ velāyaṃ imaṃ udānaṃ udānesi –

Then, when he understood this meaning, on that occasion the Blessed One uttered this solemn utterance:

‘‘Yadā have pātubhavanti dhammā;Ātāpino jhāyato brāhmaṇassa;Athassa kaṅkhā vapayanti sabbā;Yato khayaṃ paccayānaṃ avedī’’ti.

"When the Dhamma become manifest to the ardent, meditating brahmin, then all his doubts vanish, since he understood the destruction of conditions."

3. [udā. 3] Atha kho bhagavā rattiyā pacchimaṃ yāmaṃ paṭiccasamuppādaṃ anulomapaṭilomaṃ manasākāsi – ‘‘avijjāpaccayā saṅkhārā, saṅkhārapaccayā viññāṇaṃ, viññāṇapaccayā nāmarūpaṃ…pe… evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa samudayo hoti…pe… nirodho hotī’’ti.

3. Then, in the last watch of the night, the Blessed One mentally reviewed dependent origination in forward and reverse order: "With ignorance as condition, volitional formations come to be; with volitional formations as condition, consciousness; with consciousness as condition, name-and-form… Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering… Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering."

Atha kho bhagavā etamatthaṃ viditvā tāyaṃ velāyaṃ imaṃ udānaṃ udānesi –

Then, when he understood this meaning, on that occasion the Blessed One uttered this solemn utterance:

‘‘Yadā have pātubhavanti dhammā;Ātāpino jhāyato brāhmaṇassa;Vidhūpayaṃ tiṭṭhati mārasenaṃ;Sūriyova [suriyova (sī. syā. kaṃ.)] obhāsayamantalikkha’’nti.

"When the Dhamma become manifest to the ardent, meditating brahmin, he stands dispelling the army of Māra, like the sun illuminating the sky."

Bodhikathā niṭṭhitā.

The Bodhi Story is finished.

2.The Story of the Goatherd's Banyan Tree

3. [udā. 4] Atha kho bhagavā sattāhassa accayena tamhā samādhimhā vuṭṭhahitvā bodhirukkhamūlā yena ajapālanigrodho tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā ajapālanigrodhamūle sattāhaṃ ekapallaṅkena nisīdi vimuttisukhapaṭisaṃvedī. Atha kho aññataro huṃhuṅkajātiko brāhmaṇo yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami. Upasaṅkamitvā bhagavatā saddhiṃ sammodi. Sammodanīyaṃ kathaṃ sāraṇīyaṃ vītisāretvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi. Ekamantaṃ ṭhito kho so brāhmaṇo bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kittāvatā nu kho, bho gotama, brāhmaṇo hoti, katame ca pana brāhmaṇakaraṇā [brāhmaṇakārakā (ka.) brāhmaṇakarāṇā (?)] dhammā’’ti? Atha kho bhagavā etamatthaṃ viditvā tāyaṃ velāyaṃ imaṃ udānaṃ udānesi –

4. Then, after seven days had passed, the Blessed One arose from that concentration and went from the foot of the Bodhi tree to the banyan tree of Ajapala. Having approached, he sat cross-legged at the foot of the banyan tree of Ajapala for seven days, experiencing the bliss of liberation. Then a certain brahmin who would humhum approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Blessed One. After exchanging courteous and amiable talk, he stood to one side. Standing to one side, that brahmin said to the Blessed One: “To what extent, Master Gotama, is one a brahmin? And what are the qualities that make one a brahmin?” Then, understanding the meaning of this, the Blessed One on that occasion uttered this utterance of joy:

[netti. 103] Yo brāhmaṇo bāhitapāpadhammo;Nihuṃhuṅko nikkasāvo yatatto;Vedantagū vusitabrahmacariyo;Dhammena so brahmavādaṃ vadeyya;Yassussadā natthi kuhiñci loke’’ti.

The brahmin who has banished evil qualities, Without the 'humhum' manner, rid of taints, self-controlled, Master of true knowledge, who has lived the holy life— Righteously may he declare himself a brahmin, For whom there are no excesses anywhere in the world.

Ajapālakathā niṭṭhitā.

The Story of the Goatherd's Banyan Tree is concluded.

3.The Story of Mucalinda

5. [udā. 11] Atha kho bhagavā sattāhassa accayena tamhā samādhimhā vuṭṭhahitvā ajapālanigrodhamūlā yena mucalindo tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā mucalindamūle sattāhaṃ ekapallaṅkena nisīdi vimuttisukhapaṭisaṃvedī. Tena kho pana samayena mahā akālamegho udapādi, sattāhavaddalikā sītavātaduddinī. Atha kho mucalindo nāgarājā sakabhavanā nikkhamitvā bhagavato kāyaṃ sattakkhattuṃ bhogehi parikkhipitvā uparimuddhani mahantaṃ phaṇaṃ karitvā aṭṭhāsi – ‘‘mā bhagavantaṃ sītaṃ, mā bhagavantaṃ uṇhaṃ, mā bhagavantaṃ ḍaṃsamakasavātātapasarīsapasamphasso’’ti […siriṃ sapa… (sī. syā. kaṃ.)]. Atha kho mucalindo nāgarājā sattāhassa accayena viddhaṃ vigatavalāhakaṃ devaṃ viditvā bhagavato kāyā bhoge viniveṭhetvā sakavaṇṇaṃ paṭisaṃharitvā māṇavakavaṇṇaṃ abhinimminitvā bhagavato purato aṭṭhāsi pañjaliko bhagavantaṃ namassamāno. Atha kho bhagavā etamatthaṃ viditvā tāyaṃ velāyaṃ imaṃ udānaṃ udānesi –

5. Then, after the passing of seven days, the Blessed One arose from that concentration and went from the foot of the Ajapāla banyan tree to the foot of the Mucalinda tree. Having approached, he sat cross-legged at the foot of the Mucalinda tree for seven days, experiencing the bliss of release. At that time, a great unseasonal cloud arose, and a seven-day continuous downpour with cold winds and gloomy weather. Then the Nāga king Mucalinda, coming out from his own abode, encircled the Blessed One's body seven times with his coils. He spread his great hood above the Blessed One’s head and stood there, thinking: "May the Blessed One not be afflicted by cold, may the Blessed One not be afflicted by heat, may the Blessed One not be afflicted by the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, or creeping things." Then, after the passing of seven days, the Nāga king Mucalinda, knowing that the sky was clear, without clouds, unwound his coils from the Blessed One's body. Withdrawing his own form, he manifested the appearance of a young man and stood before the Blessed One with hands joined in reverence, paying homage to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, understanding this matter, at that time uttered this inspired utterance:

[kathā. 338 kathāvatthupāḷiyampi]‘‘Sukho viveko tuṭṭhassa, sutadhammassa passato;Abyāpajjaṃ sukhaṃ loke, pāṇabhūtesu saṃyamo.

Blissful is the solitude of one who is contented, who has heard the Dhamma and sees; Blissful is non-harming in the world, restraint towards all living beings.

[kathā. 338 kathāvatthupāḷiyampi]‘‘Sukhā virāgatā loke, kāmānaṃ samatikkamo;Asmimānassa yo vinayo, etaṃ ve paramaṃ sukha’’nti.

Blissful is detachment in the world, the transcending of sensual desires; The subduing of conceit is truly the supreme bliss.

Mucalindakathā niṭṭhitā.

The Mucalinda story is concluded.

4.The Story of Rājāyatana

5. Atha kho bhagavā sattāhassa accayena tamhā samādhimhā vuṭṭhahitvā mucalindamūlā yena rājāyatanaṃ tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā rājāyatanamūle sattāhaṃ ekapallaṅkena nisīdi vimuttisukhapaṭisaṃvedī. Tena kho pana samayena tapussa [tapassu (sī.)] bhallikā vāṇijā ukkalā taṃ desaṃ addhānamaggappaṭipannā honti. Atha kho tapussabhallikānaṃ vāṇijānaṃ ñātisālohitā devatā tapussabhallike vāṇije etadavoca – ‘‘ayaṃ, mārisā, bhagavā rājāyatanamūle viharati paṭhamābhisambuddho; gacchatha taṃ bhagavantaṃ manthena ca madhupiṇḍikāya ca patimānetha; taṃ vo bhavissati dīgharattaṃ hitāya sukhāyā’’ti. Atha kho tapussabhallikā vāṇijā manthañca madhupiṇḍikañca ādāya yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhaṃsu. Ekamantaṃ ṭhitā kho tapussabhallikā vāṇijā bhagavantaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘paṭiggaṇhātu no, bhante, bhagavā manthañca madhupiṇḍikañca, yaṃ amhākaṃ assa dīgharattaṃ hitāya sukhāyā’’ti. Atha kho bhagavato etadahosi – ‘‘na kho tathāgatā hatthesu paṭiggaṇhanti. Kimhi nu kho ahaṃ paṭiggaṇheyyaṃ manthañca madhupiṇḍikañcā’’ti? Atha kho cattāro mahārājāno bhagavato cetasā cetoparivitakkamaññāya catuddisā cattāro selamaye patte bhagavato upanāmesuṃ – ‘‘idha, bhante, bhagavā paṭiggaṇhātu manthañca madhupiṇḍikañcā’’ti. Paṭiggahesi bhagavā paccagghe selamaye patte manthañca madhupiṇḍikañca, paṭiggahetvā paribhuñji. Atha kho tapussabhallikā vāṇijā bhagavantaṃ onītapattapāṇiṃ viditvā bhagavato pādesu sirasā nipatitvā bhagavantaṃ (onītapattapāṇiṃ viditvā bhagavato pādesu sirasā nipatitvā bhagavantaṃ) [( ) sī. syā. potthakesu natthi] etadavocuṃ – ‘‘ete mayaṃ, bhante, bhagavantaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāma dhammañca, upāsake no bhagavā dhāretu ajjatagge pāṇupete saraṇaṃ gate’’ti. Te ca loke paṭhamaṃ upāsakā ahesuṃ dvevācikā.

6. Then, after seven days had passed, the Blessed One emerged from that absorption and went from the foot of the Mucalinda tree to the Rājāyatana tree. Having arrived, he sat at the foot of the Rājāyatana tree for seven days in a single cross-legged posture, experiencing the bliss of liberation. At that time, the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika from Ukkala were traveling along the road through that region. Then, a deity who was a kinswoman to the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika addressed them: "Sirs, this Blessed One, newly enlightened, is dwelling at the foot of the Rājāyatana tree. Go and offer him ground meal and honey cakes. That will be for your long-term welfare and happiness." So the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika took ground meal and honey cakes and approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side. Standing there, the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, may the Blessed One accept our ground meal and honey cakes, that it may be for our long-term welfare and happiness." Then the Blessed One thought: "The Tathagatas do not accept things in their hands. In what should I receive the ground meal and honey cakes?" Then the Four Great Kings, understanding the Blessed One's thought with their minds, presented four stone bowls from the four directions: "Venerable sir, may the Blessed One accept the ground meal and honey cakes in these." The Blessed One accepted the newly obtained stone bowls and the ground meal and honey cakes, and having accepted them, he consumed them. Then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika, knowing that the Blessed One had finished eating, prostrated at his feet and said: "Venerable sir, we go to the Blessed One for refuge, and to the Dhamma. May the Blessed One remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge from this day forward as long as life lasts." They were the first lay followers in the world to take the twofold formula of refuge.

Rājāyatanakathā niṭṭhitā.

The story of Rajayatana is ended.

5.The Account of Brahma's Entreaty.

6. [ayaṃ brahmayācanakathā dī. ni. 2.64 ādayo; ma. ni. 1.281 ādayo; ma. ni. 2.336 ādayo; saṃ. ni. 1.172 ādayo] Atha kho bhagavā sattāhassa accayena tamhā samādhimhā vuṭṭhahitvā rājāyatanamūlā yena ajapālanigrodho tenupasaṅkami. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā ajapālanigrodhamūle viharati. Atha kho bhagavato rahogatassa paṭisallīnassa evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – ‘‘adhigato kho myāyaṃ dhammo gambhīro duddaso duranubodho santo paṇīto atakkāvacaro nipuṇo paṇḍitavedanīyo. Ālayarāmā kho panāyaṃ pajā ālayaratā ālayasammuditā. Ālayarāmāya kho pana pajāya ālayaratāya ālayasammuditāya duddasaṃ idaṃ ṭhānaṃ yadidaṃ idappaccayatāpaaccasamuppādo; idampi kho ṭhānaṃ sududdasaṃ yadidaṃ sabbasaṅkhārasamatho sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo taṇhākkhayo virāgo nirodho nibbānaṃ.

7. Then, after seven days had passed, the Blessed One arose from that concentration and went from the foot of the Rājāyatana tree to the Ajapāla banyan tree. There, indeed, the Blessed One stayed at the foot of the Ajapāla banyan tree. Then, while the Blessed One was alone in seclusion, this thought arose in his mind: "This Dhamma I have attained is profound, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the sphere of reason, subtle, to be experienced by the wise. But this generation delights in attachment, is devoted to attachment, rejoices in attachment. For a generation delighting in attachment, devoted to attachment, rejoicing in attachment, this state is hard to see—that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination. And this state, too, is very hard to see—the stilling of all activities, the relinquishment of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna. If I were to teach the Dhamma, and others would not understand me, that would be a weariness to me, that would be troublesome to me." And then there spontaneously occurred to the Blessed One these verses, which were not amazing and never heard before:

‘‘Kicchena me adhigataṃ, halaṃ dāni pakāsituṃ;Rāgadosaparetehi, nāyaṃ dhammo susambudho.

"With difficulty I attained this Dhamma— Enough of proclaiming it now! This Dhamma is not easily understood By those consumed by lust and hate."

‘‘Paṭisotagāmiṃ nipuṇaṃ, gambhīraṃ duddasaṃ aṇuṃ;Rāgarattā na dakkhanti, tamokhandhena āvuṭā [āvaṭā (sī.)]’’ti.

Going against the stream, subtle, Profound, hard to see, minute— Those by lust defiled will not see it, Enveloped as they are in a mass of darkness.

Itiha bhagavato paṭisañcikkhato appossukkatāya cittaṃ namati, no dhammadesanāya.

Thus, as the Blessed One reflected, his mind inclined to disinclination rather than to teaching the Dhamma.

8. Atha kho brahmuno sahampatissa bhagavato cetasā cetoparivitakkamaññāya etadahosi – ‘‘nassati vata bho loko, vinassati vata bho loko, yatra hi nāma tathāgatassa arahato sammāsambuddhassa appossukkatāya cittaṃ namati [namissati (?)], no dhammadesanāyā’’ti. Atha kho brahmā sahampati – seyyathāpi nāma balavā puriso samiñjitaṃ vā bāhaṃ pasāreyya, pasāritaṃ vā bāhaṃ samiñjeyya evameva – brahmaloke antarahito bhagavato purato pāturahosi. Atha kho brahmā sahampati ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā dakkhiṇajāṇumaṇḍalaṃ pathaviyaṃ nihantvā yena bhagavā tenañjaliṃ paṇāmetvā bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘desetu, bhante, bhagavā dhammaṃ, desetu sugato dhammaṃ. Santi sattā apparajakkhajātikā, assavanatā dhammassa parihāyanti, bhavissanti dhammassa aññātāro’’ti. Idamavoca brahmā sahampati, idaṃ vatvāna athāparaṃ etadavoca –

8. Then Brahmā Sahampati, having known with his mind the thought in the Blessed One's mind, reflected: "The world is lost! The world is perishing! Since the mind of the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, inclines to disinclination to exertion, not to teaching the Dhamma!" Then, just as a strong man might stretch out his drawn-in arm or draw in his outstretched arm, Brahmā Sahampati vanished from the Brahmā world and appeared before the Blessed One. Arranging his upper robe over one shoulder, he knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined hands toward the Blessed One and said: "Venerable sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma, let the Fortunate One teach the Dhamma! There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are declining from not hearing the Dhamma; there will be those who will understand the Dhamma." This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Having said this, he then said further:

‘‘Pāturahosi magadhesu pubbe;Dhammo asuddho samalehi cintito;Apāpuretaṃ [avāpuretaṃ (sī.)] amatassa dvāraṃ;Suṇantu dhammaṃ vimalenānubuddhaṃ.

"Formerly in Magadha appeared A corrupted Dhamma devised by the defiled. Open now the door to the Deathless! Let them hear the Dhamma awakened to by the Stainless One."

‘‘Sele yathā pabbatamuddhaniṭṭhito;Yathāpi passe janataṃ samantato;Tathūpamaṃ dhammamayaṃ sumedha;Pāsādamāruyha samantacakkhu;Sokāvatiṇṇaṃ janatamapetasoko;Avekkhassu jātijarābhibhūtaṃ.

"Just as one standing on a mountain peak Might survey the people all around, So, O wise one, all-seeing one, Having ascended the palace of Dhamma, Look down, free from sorrow, upon the people Overcome with sorrow, oppressed by birth and aging."

‘‘Uṭṭhehi vīra vijitasaṅgāma;Satthavāha aṇaṇa [anaṇa (ka.)] vicara loke;Desassu [desetu (ka.)] bhagavā dhammaṃ;Aññātāro bhavissantī’’ti.

"Arise, O hero! Victor in the battle, O caravan leader, wander the world debtless! Teach the Dhamma, Blessed One, There will be those who understand."

[[ ] sī. syā. potthakesu natthi, mūlapaṇṇāsakesu pāsarāsisutthe brahmayācanā sakiṃ yeva āgatā] [ Evaṃ vutte bhagavā brahmānaṃ sahampatiṃ etadavoca – ‘‘mayhampi kho, brahme, etadahosi – ‘adhigato kho myāyaṃ dhammo gambhīro duddaso duranubodho santo paṇīto atakkāvacaro nipuṇo paṇḍitavedanīyo. Ālayarāmā kho panāyaṃ pajā ālayaratā ālayasammuditā. Ālayarāmāya kho pana pajāya ālayaratāya ālayasammuditāya duddasaṃ idaṃ ṭhānaṃ yadidaṃ idappaccayatāpaṭiccasamuppādo; idampi kho ṭhānaṃ sududdasaṃ yadidaṃ sabbasaṅkhārasamatho sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo taṇhākkhayo virāgo nirodho nibbānaṃ.

When this was said, the Blessed One addressed Brahmā Sahampati: "Indeed, Brahmā, this thought too occurred to me: ‘This Dhamma I have attained is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle, to be experienced by the wise. But this generation delights in attachment, takes pleasure in attachment, rejoices in attachment. For a generation that delights in attachment, takes pleasure in attachment, rejoices in attachment, this state is hard to see: that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination. And this state is also exceedingly hard to see: the stilling of all formations, the relinquishment of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna. If I were to teach the Dhamma, and others would not understand me, that would be wearisome and troublesome for me.’" Then, Brahmā, these stanzas, unheard before, occurred to me spontaneously:

‘Kicchena me adhigataṃ, halaṃ dāni pakāsituṃ;Rāgadosaparetehi, nāyaṃ dhammo susambudho.

With difficulty I have attained this; Enough now, why should I make it known? This Dhamma cannot be easily understood By those overcome by lust and hate.

‘Paṭisotagāmiṃ nipuṇaṃ, gambhīraṃ duddasaṃ aṇuṃ;Rāgarattā na dakkhanti, tamokhandhena āvuṭā’ti.

'Going against the current, subtle, profound, hard to see, minute, Those besotted with lust will not see it, enveloped as they are in a mass of darkness.'

Itiha me, brahme, paṭisañcikkhato appossukkatāya cittaṃ namati no dhammadesanāyā’’ti.

Thus, Brahmā, as I considered this, my mind inclined to non-exertion, not to teaching the Dhamma.

Dutiyampi kho brahmā sahampati bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘desetu, bhante, bhagavā dhammaṃ, desetu sugato dhammaṃ; santi sattā apparajakkhajātikā, assavanatā dhammassa parihāyanti, bhavissanti dhammassa aññātāro’’ti. Idamavoca brahmā sahampati, idaṃ vatvāna athāparaṃ etadavoca –

A second time, Brahmā Sahampati said this to the Blessed One: "Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma, let the Well-gone One teach the Dhamma. There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are declining through not hearing the Dhamma. There will be those who will understand the Dhamma." This is what Brahmā Sahampati said; and after saying this, he further said:

‘‘Pāturahosi magadhesu pubbe;Dhammo asuddho samalehi cintito;Apāpuretaṃ amatassa dvāraṃ;Suṇantu dhammaṃ vimalenānubuddhaṃ.

Long ago, the Dhamma appeared in Magadha; An impure Dhamma contemplated by the defiled. Open this door to the Deathless; Let them hear the Dhamma awakened to by the stainless one.

‘‘Sele yathā pabbatamuddhaniṭṭhito;Yathāpi passe janataṃ samantato;Tathūpamaṃ dhammamayaṃ sumedha;Pāsādamāruyha samantacakkhu;Sokāvatiṇṇaṃ janatamapetasoko;Avekkhassu jātijarābhibhūtaṃ.

Just as one standing on a mountain peak Might see the populace all around, So too, O wise one, O all-seeing one, Having climbed the Dhamma-palace, Look down, yourself free from sorrow, Upon the populace sunk in sorrow, And those overcome by birth and decay.

‘‘Uṭṭhehi vīra vijitasaṅgāma;Satthavāha aṇaṇa vicara loke;Desassu bhagavā dhammaṃ;Aññātāro bhavissantī’’ti.

"Arise, O hero, victor in the battle! O Caravan leader, wander the world debtless. O Blessed One, teach the Dhamma! There will be those who understand."

Dutiyampi kho bhagavā brahmānaṃ sahampatiṃ etadavoca – ‘‘mayhampi kho, brahme, etadahosi – ‘adhigato kho myāyaṃ dhammo gambhīro duddaso duranubodho santo paṇīto atakkāvacaro nipuṇo paṇḍitavedanīyo.

Apissu maṃ, brahme, imā anacchariyā gāthāyo paṭibhaṃsu pubbe assutapubbā – Again, the Blessed One addressed Brahmā Sahampati: “It occurred to me, Brahmā: ‘This Dhamma I have realized is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the sphere of reason, subtle, to be experienced by the wise. But this generation delights in attachment, is devoted to attachment, rejoices in attachment. For a generation delighting in attachment, devoted to attachment, rejoicing in attachment, this thing is hard to see, namely, specific conditionality, dependent origination. And this thing too is very hard to see, namely, the stilling of all formations, the relinquishment of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna. If I were to teach the Dhamma and others would not understand me, that would be a weariness to me, that would be an annoyance to me.’ Then, Brahmā, these verses, never heard before, occurred to me:

‘Kicchena me adhigataṃ, halaṃ dāni pakāsituṃ;Rāgadosaparetehi, nāyaṃ dhammo susambudho.

'With difficulty I attained it; enough now for proclaiming it! This Dhamma is not easily grasped by those steeped in lust and hate.'

‘Paṭisotagāmiṃ nipuṇaṃ, gambhīraṃ duddasaṃ aṇuṃ;Rāgarattā na dakkhanti, tamokhandhena āvuṭā’ti.

'Against the current, subtle, deep, hard to see, minute; Those besotted with passion do not see it, shrouded by a mass of darkness.'

Itiha me, brahme, paṭisañcikkhato appossukkatāya cittaṃ namati, no dhammadesanāyā’’ti.

Thus, O Brahmā, as I considered this, my mind inclined to inaction rather than to teaching the Dhamma.

Tatiyampi kho brahmā sahampati bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘desetu, bhante, bhagavā dhammaṃ, desetu sugato dhammaṃ. Santi sattā apparajakkhajātikā, assavanatā dhammassa parihāyanti, bhavissanti dhammassa aññātāro’’ti. Idamavoca brahmā sahampati, idaṃ vatvāna athāparaṃ etadavoca –

A third time, Brahmā Sahampati said this to the Blessed One: "Let the Blessed One, venerable sir, teach the Dhamma! Let the Fortunate One teach the Dhamma! There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are falling away through not hearing the Dhamma. They will be understanders of the Dhamma." This is what Brahmā Sahampati said; and having said this, he further said this:

‘‘Pāturahosi magadhesu pubbe;Dhammo asuddho samalehi cintito;Apāpuretaṃ amatassa dvāraṃ;Suṇantu dhammaṃ vimalenānubuddhaṃ.

In Magadha, the Dhamma has appeared before, Impure, conceived by the defiled. Open this door to the Deathless! Let them hear the Dhamma the Stainless One has realized.

‘‘Sele yathā pabbatamuddhaniṭṭhito;Yathāpi passe janataṃ samantato;Tathūpamaṃ dhammamayaṃ sumedha;Pāsādamāruyha samantacakkhu;Sokāvatiṇṇaṃ janatamapetasoko;Avekkhassu jātijarābhibhūtaṃ.

"Just as one standing on a mountain peak can see the people all around, so too, O wise one, all-seeing, having climbed the Dhamma-palace, look upon the sorrow-stricken people, free from sorrow yourself, and see those overcome by birth and decay."

‘‘Uṭṭhehi vīra vijitasaṅgāma;Satthavāha aṇaṇa vicara loke;Desassu bhagavā dhammaṃ;Aññātāro bhavissantī’’ti.

"Arise, O hero, victor in battle! O caravan leader, free of debt, wander the world! Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Those who understand will be there."

9. Atha kho bhagavā brahmuno ca ajjhesanaṃ viditvā sattesu ca kāruññataṃ paṭicca buddhacakkhunā lokaṃ volokesi. Addasā kho bhagavā buddhacakkhunā lokaṃ volokento satte apparajakkhe mahārajakkhe tikkhindriye mudindriye svākāre dvākāre suviññāpaye duviññāpaye, appekacce paralokavajjabhayadassāvine [dassāvino (sī. syā. kaṃ.)] viharante, appekacce na paralokavajjabhayadassāvine viharante.

9. Then the Blessed One, understanding Brahma's request and moved by compassion for beings, surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha. The Blessed One, surveying the world with the eye of a Buddha, saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in their eyes, with keen faculties and dull faculties, with good qualities and bad qualities, easy to instruct and hard to instruct, some seeing danger in the next world and in offenses, and some not seeing danger in the next world and in offenses. Just as in a pond of blue lotuses, or red lotuses, or white lotuses, some lotuses are born in the water, grow in the water, remain immersed in the water, and thrive underwater; some lotuses are born in the water, grow in the water, and stand at water-level; and some lotuses are born in the water, grow in the water, and rise up beyond the water, untouched by the water—in the same way, the Blessed One, surveying the world with the eye of a Buddha, saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in their eyes, with keen faculties and dull faculties, with good qualities and bad qualities, easy to instruct and hard to instruct, some seeing danger in the next world and in offenses, and some not seeing danger in the next world and in offenses. Having seen this, he addressed Brahma Sahampati in verse:

‘‘Apārutā tesaṃ amatassa dvārā;Ye sotavanto pamuñcantu saddhaṃ;Vihiṃsasaññī paguṇaṃ na bhāsiṃ;Dhammaṃ paṇītaṃ manujesu brahme’’ti.

Opened are the doors to the Deathless; Let those with ears put forth faith. Thinking of vexation, I did not preach the sublime, well-proclaimed Dhamma among humans, O Brahmā.

Atha kho brahmā sahampati ‘‘katāvakāso khomhi bhagavatā dhammadesanāyā’’ti bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṃ katvā tatthevantaradhāyi.

Then Brahmā Sahampati, realizing, "I have been given an opportunity by the Blessed One to teach the Dhamma," paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and vanished right there.

Brahmayācanakathā niṭṭhitā.

The account of Brahma's entreaty is concluded.

8. Then the Blessed One thought, "To whom should I first teach the Dhamma? Who will quickly understand this Dhamma?" Then the Blessed One thought, "This Āḷāra Kālāma is wise, intelligent, discerning, and has long had little dust in his eyes. Suppose I were to teach the Dhamma first to Āḷāra Kālāma—he would quickly understand this Dhamma." Then a deity, invisible to the Blessed One, announced, "Venerable sir, Āḷāra Kālāma has passed away seven days ago." And the knowledge arose in the Blessed One, "Āḷāra Kālāma has passed away seven days ago." Then the Blessed One thought, "Indeed, Āḷāra Kālāma was a great loss! If he had heard this Dhamma, he would have quickly understood it." Then the Blessed One thought, "To whom should I first teach the Dhamma? Who will quickly understand this Dhamma?" Then the Blessed One thought, "This Uddaka Rāmaputta is wise, intelligent, discerning, and has long had little dust in his eyes. Suppose I were to teach the Dhamma first to Uddaka Rāmaputta—he would quickly understand this Dhamma." Then a deity, invisible to the Blessed One, announced, "Venerable sir, Uddaka Rāmaputta passed away last night." And the knowledge arose in the Blessed One, "Uddaka Rāmaputta has passed away last night." Then the Blessed One thought, "Indeed, Uddaka Rāmaputta was a great loss! If he had heard this Dhamma, he would have quickly understood it."

Atha kho bhagavato etadahosi – ‘‘kassa nu kho ahaṃ paṭhamaṃ dhammaṃ deseyyaṃ? Ko imaṃ dhammaṃ khippameva ājānissatī’’ti? Atha kho bhagavato etadahosi – ‘‘bahukārā kho me pañcavaggiyā bhikkhū, ye maṃ padhānapahitattaṃ upaṭṭhahiṃsu; yaṃnūnāhaṃ pañcavaggiyānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ paṭhamaṃ dhammaṃ deseyya’’nti. Atha kho bhagavato etadahosi – ‘‘kahaṃ nu kho etarahi pañcavaggiyā bhikkhū viharantī’’ti? Addasā kho bhagavā dibbena cakkhunā visuddhena atikkantamānusakena pañcavaggiye bhikkhū bārāṇasiyaṃ viharante isipatane migadāye. Atha kho bhagavā uruvelāyaṃ yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena bārāṇasī tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi.

Then the Blessed One thought: "To whom should I first teach the Dhamma? Who will quickly understand this Dhamma?" Then the Blessed One thought: "The group of five bhikkhus were very helpful to me when I was engaged in the Great Striving. Suppose I were to teach the Dhamma first to the group of five bhikkhus." Then the Blessed One thought: "Where are the group of five bhikkhus dwelling now?" With the divine eye, purified and surpassing human sight, the Blessed One saw the group of five bhikkhus dwelling at Bārāṇasī, at Isipatana, the Deer Park. Then, after the Blessed One had stayed at Uruvelā as long as he wished, he set out on his journey for Bārāṇasī.

11. Addasā kho upako ājīvako bhagavantaṃ antarā ca gayaṃ antarā ca bodhiṃ addhānamaggappaṭipannaṃ, disvāna bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘vippasannāni kho te, āvuso, indriyāni, parisuddho chavivaṇṇo pariyodāto. Kaṃsi tvaṃ, āvuso, uddissa pabbajito? Ko vā te satthā? Kassa vā tvaṃ dhammaṃ rocesī’’ti? Evaṃ vutte bhagavā upakaṃ ājīvakaṃ gāthāhi ajjhabhāsi –

11. Then Upaka the Ājīvaka saw the Blessed One traveling on the road between Gayā and the Bodhi tree. Having seen him, he said to the Blessed One: "Your faculties, friend, are serene, your complexion pure and bright. Under whom have you gone forth, friend? Who is your teacher? Whose doctrine do you approve of?" When this was said, the Blessed One addressed Upaka the Ājīvaka in verses:

[dha. pa. 353; kathā. 405] ‘‘Sabbābhibhū sabbavidūhamasmi,Sabbesu dhammesu anūpalitto;Sabbañjaho taṇhākkhaye vimutto,Sayaṃ abhiññāya kamuddiseyyaṃ.

"I am the conqueror of all, I know all, In all things I am unstained; Having abandoned all, freed in the destruction of craving, Having directly known by myself, whom should I point to?"

[mi. pa. 4.5.11 milindapañhepi; kathā. 405] ‘‘Na me ācariyo atthi, sadiso me na vijjati;Sadevakasmiṃ lokasmiṃ, natthi me paṭipuggalo.

"I have no teacher; none is equal to me; in the world with its deities, there is no one comparable to me."

[kathā. 405 kathāvatthupāḷiyampi] ‘‘Ahañhi arahā loke, ahaṃ satthā anuttaro;Ekomhi sammāsambuddho, sītibhūtosmi nibbuto.

"For I am the Arahant in the world, I am the unsurpassed Teacher; I alone am the Perfectly Enlightened One, I am cooled and extinguished."

[kathā. 405 kathāvatthupāḷiyampi]‘‘Dhammacakkaṃ pavattetuṃ, gacchāmi kāsinaṃ puraṃ;Andhībhūtasmiṃ lokasmiṃ, āhañchaṃ [āhaññiṃ (ka.)] amatadundubhi’’nti.

"To set in motion the Wheel of Dhamma, I go to the city of Kasi. In a world become blind, I shall beat the drum of the Deathless."

Yathā kho tvaṃ, āvuso, paṭijānāsi, arahasi anantajinoti.

As you claim, friend, you deserve to be called a 'Victor Without End.'

[kathā. 405 kathāvatthupāḷiyampi] ‘‘Mādisā ve jinā honti, ye pattā āsavakkhayaṃ;Jitā me pāpakā dhammā, tasmāhamupaka [tasmāhamupakā (sī.)] jino’’ti.

"Only those like me are Conquerors, who have attained the destruction of the taints; I have conquered evil qualities, therefore, Upaka, I am a Conqueror."

Evaṃ vutte upako ājīvako hupeyyapāvusoti [huveyyapāvuso (sī.) huveyyāvuso (syā.)] vatvā sīsaṃ okampetvā ummaggaṃ gahetvā pakkāmi.

When this was said, Upaka the Ājīvaka, saying, "That may be so, friend," shook his head, took a different path, and departed.

12. Atha kho bhagavā anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena bārāṇasī isipatanaṃ migadāyo, yena pañcavaggiyā bhikkhū tenupasaṅkami.

12. Then the Blessed One, traveling by stages, arrived at Isipatana, the Deer Park near Varanasi, where the group of five bhikkhus were staying. The group of five bhikkhus saw the Blessed One coming from afar and made an agreement among themselves: "Friends, this ascetic Gotama is coming—indulgent, straying from exertion, reverting to luxury. We should not pay respects to him, nor rise to greet him, nor receive his bowl and robe. However, we may prepare a seat; if he wishes, he may sit down." But as the Blessed One approached, the group of five bhikkhus found themselves unable to adhere to their agreement. One went to receive his bowl and robe, another prepared a seat, another set out water for washing his feet, another brought a footstool, and another a foot scraper. The Blessed One sat down on the prepared seat and washed his feet. Still they addressed him by name and as "friend." When they spoke thus, the Blessed One said to them: "Bhikkhus, do not address the Tathāgata by name or as 'friend.' The Tathāgata, bhikkhus, is an Arahant, a Fully Enlightened One. Listen, bhikkhus, the Deathless has been attained. I instruct, I teach the Dhamma. Practicing as instructed, you will soon realize for yourselves, in this very life, the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness—having directly known and realized it for yourselves by your own insight, you will abide in it." When this was said, the group of five bhikkhus replied: "Friend Gotama, by that conduct, that practice, those severe austerities, you did not attain any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. How then, now that you are indulgent, straying from exertion, and reverting to luxury, will you attain any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones?" The Blessed One replied: "Bhikkhus, the Tathāgata is not indulgent, nor has he strayed from exertion, nor has he reverted to luxury. The Tathāgata, bhikkhus, is an Arahant, a Fully Enlightened One. Listen, bhikkhus, the Deathless has been attained. I instruct, I teach the Dhamma. Practicing as instructed, you will soon realize for yourselves, in this very life, the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness—having directly known and realized it for yourselves by your own insight, you will abide in it." A second time, the group of five bhikkhus spoke to the Blessed One in the same way... A second time, the Blessed One replied to them in the same way... A third time, the group of five bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: "Friend Gotama, by that conduct, that practice, those severe austerities, you did not attain any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. How then, now that you are indulgent, straying from exertion, and reverting to luxury, will you attain any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones?" Then the Blessed One asked them: "Bhikkhus, do you recall that I ever spoke to you like this before?" "No, Venerable Sir." "The Tathāgata, bhikkhus, is an Arahant, a Fully Enlightened One. Listen, bhikkhus, the Deathless has been attained. I instruct, I teach the Dhamma. Practicing as instructed, you will soon realize for yourselves, in this very life, the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness—having directly known and realized it for yourselves by your own insight, you will abide in it." The Blessed One was able to convince the group of five bhikkhus. Then the group of five bhikkhus listened attentively, inclined their ears, and established their minds on understanding.

13. Atha kho bhagavā pañcavaggiye bhikkhū āmantesi –

14. Then the Blessed One addressed the group of five bhikkhus:

‘‘[saṃ. ni. 5.1081 ādayo] Dveme, bhikkhave, antā pabbajitena na sevitabbā. Katame dve [idaṃ padadvayaṃ sī. syā. potthakesu natthi]?

"Monks, these two extremes are not to be followed by one gone forth. Which two? That which is indulgence in sensual pleasures: low, vulgar, common, ignoble, and unbeneficial; and that which is indulgence in self-torment: painful, ignoble, and unbeneficial. Avoiding both these extremes, monks, the Tathagata has awakened to the Middle Path, which gives rise to vision, which gives rise to knowledge, which leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana. And what, monks, is that Middle Path awakened to by the Tathagata, which gives rise to vision, which gives rise to knowledge, which leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is to say: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. This, monks, is that Middle Path awakened to by the Tathagata, which gives rise to vision, which gives rise to knowledge, which leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana."

14. "Now this, monks, is the noble truth of suffering: Birth is suffering, aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering; association with the disliked is suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what one wants is suffering. In brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering." "Now this, monks, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: It is this craving which leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, craving for non-existence."

16. Monks, as long as my knowledge and vision of these Four Noble Truths, as they really are, with their three rounds and twelve aspects, was not thoroughly purified in this way, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its gods, its Māras, its Brahmās, this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans. But when, monks, my knowledge and vision of these Four Noble Truths, as they really are, with their three rounds and twelve aspects, was thoroughly purified in this way, then, monks, I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its gods, its Māras, its Brahmās, this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans. And the knowledge and vision arose in me: “ ‘Unshakeable is my liberation; this is my last birth; now there is no more renewed existence.’ ” This the Blessed One said. Pleased, the group of five monks rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words.

And as this exposition was being spoken, the dust-free, stainless Eye of Dhamma arose in Venerable Koṇḍañña: “Whatever is subject to origination is subject to cessation.”

17.And when the Wheel of Dhamma had been set in motion by the Blessed One, the earth deities raised a cry: “At Bārāṇasī, in Isipatana, in the Deer Park, the unsurpassed Wheel of Dhamma has been set in motion by the Blessed One, that cannot be reversed by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.” Hearing the cry of the earth deities, the deities of the Four Great Kings raised a cry. Hearing the cry of the deities of the Four Great Kings, the Tāvatiṃsa deities raised a cry. Hearing the cry of the Tāvatiṃsa deities, the Yāma deities raised a cry. Hearing the cry of the Yāma deities, the Tusita deities raised a cry. Hearing the cry of the Tusita deities, the Nimmānaratī deities raised a cry. Hearing the cry of the Nimmānaratī deities, the Paranimmitavasavattī deities raised a cry. Hearing the cry of the Paranimmitavasavattī deities, the Brahmakāyika deities raised a cry: “At Bārāṇasī, in Isipatana, in the Deer Park, the unsurpassed Wheel of Dhamma has been set in motion by the Blessed One, that cannot be reversed by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.” Thus, in that moment, in that instant, in that second, the sound rose up to the Brahmā world. And this ten-thousandfold world system quaked, shook, and trembled, and an immeasurable, sublime radiance appeared in the world, surpassing the divine power of the devas. Then the Blessed One uttered this inspired utterance: “Koṇḍañña has indeed understood! Koṇḍañña has indeed understood!” Thus it was that Venerable Koṇḍañña acquired the name ‘Aññāta Koṇḍañña’.

Sāva tassa āyasmato upasampadā ahosi.

18.Then Venerable Aññāta Koṇḍañña, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, known the Dhamma, penetrated the Dhamma, crossed over doubt, rid of perplexity, attained confidence, and become independent of others in the Teacher’s Dispensation, addressed the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, may I receive the going forth in the Blessed One’s presence, may I receive the full ordination.” The Blessed One said: “Come, bhikkhu, the Dhamma is well proclaimed; live the holy life for the complete ending of suffering.” That itself was the full ordination for Venerable Koṇḍañña.

19.Then the Blessed One instructed and exhorted the remaining bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk. Then, as Venerable Vappa and Venerable Bhaddiya were being instructed and exhorted by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk, the dust-free, stainless Eye of Dhamma arose in them: “Whatever is subject to origination is subject to cessation.”

Having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, known the Dhamma, penetrated the Dhamma, crossed over doubt, rid of perplexity, attained confidence, and become independent of others in the Teacher’s Dispensation, they addressed the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, may we receive the going forth in the Blessed One’s presence, may we receive the full ordination.” The Blessed One said: “Come, bhikkhus, the Dhamma is well proclaimed; live the holy life for the complete ending of suffering.” That itself was the full ordination for those venerable ones.

Sāva tesaṃ āyasmantānaṃ upasampadā ahosi.

Then the Blessed One, after the meal, instructed and exhorted the remaining bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk. The group of six sustained themselves on whatever alms the three bhikkhus brought back from their alms round. Then, while Venerable Mahānāma and Venerable Assaji were being instructed and exhorted by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk, the dust-free, stainless Eye of Dhamma arose in them: “Whatever is subject to origination is subject to cessation.” Having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, known the Dhamma, penetrated the Dhamma, crossed over doubt, rid of perplexity, attained confidence, and become independent of others in the Teacher’s Dispensation, they addressed the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, may we receive the going forth in the Blessed One’s presence, may we receive the full ordination.” The Blessed One said: “Come, bhikkhus, the Dhamma is well proclaimed; live the holy life for the complete ending of suffering.” That itself was the full ordination for those venerable ones.

20. Atha kho bhagavā pañcavaggiye bhikkhū āmantesi –

22.“Therefore, bhikkhus, whatever form there is—past, future, or present, internal or external, coarse or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near—all form should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Whatever feeling there is—past, future, or present, internal or external, coarse or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near—all feeling should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Whatever perception there is—past, future, or present, internal or external, coarse or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near—all perception should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Whatever mental formations there are—past, future, or present, internal or external, coarse or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near—all mental formations should be seen as they actually are with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Whatever consciousness there is—past, future, or present, internal or external, coarse or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near—all consciousness should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’”

23. ‘‘Evaṃ passaṃ, bhikkhave, sutavā ariyasāvako rūpasmimpi nibbindati, vedanāyapi nibbindati, saññāyapi nibbindati, saṅkhāresupi nibbindati, viññāṇasmimpi nibbindati; nibbindaṃ virajjati; virāgā vimuccati; vimuttasmiṃ vimuttamiti ñāṇaṃ hoti, ‘khīṇā jāti, vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ, kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ, nāparaṃ itthattāyā’ti pajānātī’’ti.

23.“Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with mental formations, disenchanted with consciousness. Being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is liberated. When liberated, there comes the knowledge: ‘It is liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’”

24. Idamavoca bhagavā. Attamanā pañcavaggiyā bhikkhū bhagavato bhāsitaṃ abhinandunti [abhinanduṃ (syā.)]. Imasmiñca pana veyyākaraṇasmiṃ bhaññamāne pañcavaggiyānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ anupādāya āsavehi cittāni vimucciṃsu. Tena kho pana samayena cha loke arahanto honti.

24.This is what the Blessed One said. The group-of-five bhikkhus, delighted, rejoiced at the Blessed One’s words. And as this exposition was being spoken, the minds of the group-of-five bhikkhus were liberated from the taints by not clinging. At that time, there were six arahants in the world.

Pañcavaggiyakathā niṭṭhitā.

The Discourse on the Group-of-Five is concluded.

7.The Going Forth

25. Tena kho pana samayena bārāṇasiyaṃ yaso nāma kulaputto seṭṭhiputto sukhumālo hoti. Tassa tayo pāsādā honti – eko hemantiko, eko gimhiko, eko vassiko. So vassike pāsāde cattāro māse [vassike pāsāde vassike cattāro māse (sī.)] nippurisehi tūriyehi paricārayamāno na heṭṭhāpāsādaṃ orohati. Atha kho yasassa kulaputtassa pañcahi kāmaguṇehi samappitassa samaṅgībhūtassa paricārayamānassa paṭikacceva [paṭigacceva (sī.)] niddā okkami, parijanassapi niddā okkami, sabbarattiyo ca telapadīpo jhāyati. Atha kho yaso kulaputto paṭikacceva pabujjhitvā addasa sakaṃ parijanaṃ supantaṃ – aññissā kacche vīṇaṃ, aññissā kaṇṭhe mudiṅgaṃ, aññissā kacche āḷambaraṃ, aññaṃ vikesikaṃ, aññaṃ vikkheḷikaṃ, aññā vippalapantiyo, hatthappattaṃ susānaṃ maññe. Disvānassa ādīnavo pāturahosi, nibbidāya cittaṃ saṇṭhāsi. Atha kho yaso kulaputto udānaṃ udānesi – ‘‘upaddutaṃ vata bho, upassaṭṭhaṃ vata bho’’ti.

25.Now at that time, in Benares, there was a clansman named Yasa, the son of a wealthy householder, who was delicate. He had three mansions—one for winter, one for summer, and one for the rainy season. In the rainy-season mansion, he spent four months attended by musicians, with no men present, and did not descend to the lower mansion. Then, while Yasa the clansman, endowed with and surrounded by the five cords of sensual pleasure, was being entertained, sleep overcame him early, and his attendants too had fallen asleep, and an oil lamp burned throughout the night. Then Yasa the clansman awoke early and saw his attendants asleep—one with her lute in her armpit, another with her drum at her throat, another with her āḷambara in her armpit, one disheveled, another slobbering, some babbling—as if it were a charnel ground presented to him. Seeing this, danger became apparent to him, and his mind settled into revulsion. Then Yasa the clansman uttered this heartfelt exclamation: “Afflicted, sirs! Beset, sirs!”

Atha kho yaso kulaputto suvaṇṇapādukāyo ārohitvā yena nivesanadvāraṃ tenupasaṅkami. Amanussā dvāraṃ vivariṃsu – mā yasassa kulaputtassa koci antarāyamakāsi agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajjāyāti. Atha kho yaso kulaputto yena nagaradvāraṃ tenupasaṅkami. Amanussā dvāraṃ vivariṃsu – mā yasassa kulaputtassa koci antarāyamakāsi agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajjāyāti. Atha kho yaso kulaputto yena isipatanaṃ migadāyo tenupasaṅkami.

Then Yasa the clansman, having put on his golden sandals, approached the dwelling's entrance. Non-human beings opened the door, thinking, 'Let no one cause an obstacle to Yasa the clansman's going forth from the household life to homelessness.' Then Yasa the clansman approached the city gate. Non-human beings opened the gate, thinking, 'Let no one cause an obstacle to Yasa the clansman's going forth from the household life to homelessness.' Then Yasa the clansman approached the Deer Park at Isipatana.

26. Tena kho pana samayena bhagavā rattiyā paccūsasamayaṃ paccuṭṭhāya ajjhokāse caṅkamati. Addasā kho bhagavā yasaṃ kulaputtaṃ dūratova āgacchantaṃ, disvāna caṅkamā orohitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi. Atha kho yaso kulaputto bhagavato avidūre udānaṃ udānesi – ‘‘upaddutaṃ vata bho, upassaṭṭhaṃ vata bho’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā yasaṃ kulaputtaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘idaṃ kho, yasa, anupaddutaṃ, idaṃ anupassaṭṭhaṃ. Ehi yasa, nisīda, dhammaṃ te desessāmī’’ti. Atha kho yaso kulaputto – idaṃ kira anupaddutaṃ, idaṃ anupassaṭṭhanti haṭṭho udaggo suvaṇṇapādukāhi orohitvā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnassa kho yasassa kulaputtassa bhagavā anupubbiṃ kathaṃ kathesi, seyyathidaṃ – dānakathaṃ sīlakathaṃ saggakathaṃ, kāmānaṃ ādīnavaṃ okāraṃ saṃkilesaṃ, nekkhamme ānisaṃsaṃ pakāsesi. Yadā bhagavā aññāsi yasaṃ kulaputtaṃ kallacittaṃ, muducittaṃ, vinīvaraṇacittaṃ, udaggacittaṃ, pasannacittaṃ, atha yā buddhānaṃ sāmukkaṃsikā dhammadesanā taṃ pakāsesi – dukkhaṃ, samudayaṃ, nirodhaṃ, maggaṃ.

26.At that time, the Blessed One, having risen at dawn, was walking in the open. The Blessed One saw the clansman Yasa coming from afar. Seeing him, the Blessed One descended from his walk and sat down on a prepared seat. Then the clansman Yasa, not far from the Blessed One, uttered this exclamation: “Afflicted, sirs! Beset, sirs!” Then the Blessed One said to the clansman Yasa: “Here, Yasa, there is no affliction, here there is no besetment. Come, Yasa, sit down; I will teach you the Dhamma.” Then the clansman Yasa, thinking, “Here indeed is no affliction, here is no besetment,” joyful and uplifted, removed his golden sandals and approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. As the clansman Yasa was sitting to one side, the Blessed One gave him a progressive talk, that is to say, a talk on generosity, a talk on virtue, a talk on heaven; he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual pleasures and the benefit of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that Yasa's mind was fit, pliable, unobscured, uplifted, and clear, then he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth, free from stains, would perfectly absorb dye, even so, while sitting in that very seat, there arose in the clansman Yasa the stainless, immaculate Eye of Dhamma: “Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.”

27. Atha kho yasassa kulaputtassa mātā pāsādaṃ abhiruhitvā yasaṃ kulaputtaṃ apassantī yena seṭṭhi gahapati tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā seṭṭhiṃ gahapatiṃ etadavoca – ‘‘putto te, gahapati, yaso na dissatī’’ti.

Addasā kho seṭṭhi gahapati suvaṇṇapādukānaṃ nikkhepaṃ, disvāna taṃyeva anugamāsi [anugamā (sī. syā.)]. Addasā kho bhagavā seṭṭhiṃ gahapatiṃ dūratova āgacchantaṃ, disvāna bhagavato etadahosi – ‘‘yaṃnūnāhaṃ tathārūpaṃ iddhābhisaṅkhāraṃ abhisaṅkhareyyaṃ yathā seṭṭhi gahapati idha nisinno idha nisinnaṃ yasaṃ kulaputtaṃ na passeyyā’’ti.

Tena hi, gahapati, nisīda, appeva nāma idha nisinno idha nisinnaṃ yasaṃ kulaputtaṃ passeyyāsīti.

27.Then Yasa's mother, having ascended to the palace and not seeing the clansman Yasa, approached the wealthy householder and said, 'Householder, your son Yasa is not to be seen.' Then the wealthy householder dispatched messengers in the four directions and himself went to the Isipatana Deer Park. The wealthy householder saw the place where the golden sandals were deposited, and following them, went along that very path. The Blessed One saw the wealthy householder approaching from afar and thought: 'What if I were to exert such an act of psychic power that the wealthy householder, sitting here, would not see the clansman Yasa sitting here?' Then the Blessed One exerted such an act of psychic power. Then the wealthy householder approached the Blessed One and said, 'Venerable sir, has the Blessed One seen the clansman Yasa?' 'Well then, householder, sit down. Perhaps by sitting here you may see the clansman Yasa sitting here.' Then the wealthy householder, joyful and uplifted, thinking, 'Indeed, by sitting here I will see the clansman Yasa sitting here,' paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. As the wealthy householder sat to one side, the Blessed One gave him a progressive discourse—that is, a discourse on giving, virtue, and the heavens; he explained the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual pleasures and the benefit of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that the wealthy householder's mind was fit, pliable, unobscured, uplifted, and clear, he then proclaimed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth, free from stains, would readily absorb dye, so too in the wealthy householder, right there on that seat, arose the stainless, immaculate Eye of Dhamma: 'Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.' Then the wealthy householder, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, known the Dhamma, and plunged into the Dhamma, having crossed over doubt, dispelled uncertainty, gained confidence, and become independent of others in the Teacher's dispensation, said to the Blessed One: 'Excellent, Venerable Sir! Excellent, Venerable Sir! Just as one might set upright what was overturned, reveal what was hidden, show the way to one who is lost, or hold up a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes might see forms—even so has the Dhamma been explained by the Blessed One in manifold ways. Venerable Sir, I go for refuge to the Blessed One, the Dhamma, and the Sangha of monks. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has taken refuge from this day forward until life's end.' He was the first lay follower in the world to make the threefold declaration of refuge.

28. Atha kho yasassa kulaputtassa pituno dhamme desiyamāne yathādiṭṭhaṃ yathāviditaṃ bhūmiṃ paccavekkhantassa anupādāya āsavehi cittaṃ vimucci. Atha kho bhagavato etadahosi – ‘‘yasassa kho kulaputtassa pituno dhamme desiyamāne yathādiṭṭhaṃ yathāviditaṃ bhūmiṃ paccavekkhantassa anupādāya āsavehi cittaṃ vimuttaṃ. Abhabbo kho yaso kulaputto hīnāyāvattitvā kāme paribhuñjituṃ, seyyathāpi pubbe agārikabhūto; yaṃnūnāhaṃ taṃ iddhābhisaṅkhāraṃ paṭippassambheyya’’nti. Atha kho bhagavā taṃ iddhābhisaṅkhāraṃ paṭippassambhesi. Addasā kho seṭṭhi gahapati yasaṃ kulaputtaṃ nisinnaṃ, disvāna yasaṃ kulaputtaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘mātā te tāta, yasa, parideva [paridevī (ka.)] sokasamāpannā, dehi mātuyā jīvita’’nti.

Sāva tassa āyasmato upasampadā ahosi. Tena kho pana samayena satta loke arahanto honti.

28.Then, while the clansman Yasa’s father was being taught the Dhamma, contemplating the ground as it had been seen and known, his mind was liberated from the taints without clinging. Then the Blessed One thought: “While the clansman Yasa’s father was being taught the Dhamma, contemplating the ground as it had been seen and known, his mind was liberated from the taints without clinging. It is impossible for the clansman Yasa to return to the lower life and enjoy sensual pleasures as he did before when he was a householder. Why don’t I now withdraw that act of psychic power?” Then the Blessed One withdrew that act of psychic power. The wealthy householder saw the clansman Yasa seated there. Seeing him, he said to the clansman Yasa: “My dear Yasa, your mother is grieving, overcome by sorrow. Give your mother her life.” Then the clansman Yasa looked at the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One said to the wealthy householder: “What do you think, householder? If someone has seen and understood the Dhamma with the knowledge and vision of a trainee, just as you have, and while contemplating the ground as it had been seen and known, his mind is liberated from the taints without clinging—could such a one return to the lower life and enjoy sensual pleasures as he did before when he was a householder?” “No, venerable sir.” “Householder, the clansman Yasa has seen and understood the Dhamma with the knowledge and vision of a trainee, just as you have. While contemplating the ground as it had been seen and known, his mind was liberated from the taints without clinging. It is impossible for the clansman Yasa to return to the lower life and enjoy sensual pleasures as he did before when he was a householder.” “It is a gain, venerable sir, for the clansman Yasa, it is a great gain, venerable sir, that the clansman Yasa’s mind has been liberated from the taints without clinging. Venerable sir, may the Blessed One together with the clansman Yasa as his attendant accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” The Blessed One consented by silence. Then the wealthy householder, understanding the Blessed One’s consent, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed. Then, not long after the wealthy householder had left, the clansman Yasa said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, may I receive the going forth in the Blessed One’s presence, may I receive the higher ordination.” “Come, monk,” the Blessed One said, “the Dhamma is well proclaimed; live the holy life for the complete ending of suffering.” That was the venerable one’s higher ordination. At that time there were seven arahants in the world.

Yasassa pabbajjā niṭṭhitā.

The Going Forth of Yasa was concluded.

29.Then, in the morning, the Blessed One, having dressed, took his bowl and robe, and accompanied by Venerable Yasa following behind him as his attendant, went to the house of the wealthy householder. Arriving there, he sat down on the prepared seat. Then Venerable Yasa’s mother and his former wife approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One gave them a progressive talk—that is, talk on generosity, talk on virtue, talk on heaven; he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual pleasures and the benefit of renunciation. When he knew that their minds were ready, pliable, free from hindrances, uplifted, and confident, he revealed the teaching special to the Buddhas—suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth, free from stains, would properly absorb dye, so too, while they sat there, the dust-free, stainless vision of the Dhamma arose in them: "Whatever is subject to arising is all subject to cessation." Having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, plunged into the Dhamma, having crossed over doubt, rid of uncertainty, having gained confidence, independent of others in the Teacher’s dispensation, they said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, venerable sir! Excellent, venerable sir! ... We go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha. May the Blessed One remember us as laywomen who have gone for refuge from this day forward for life." They were the first laywomen in the world to declare the threefold refuge.

Then Venerable Yasa’s mother, father, and former wife personally served and satisfied the Blessed One and Venerable Yasa with choice food, both hard and soft. When the Blessed One had finished eating and removed his hand from the bowl, they sat down to one side. Then the Blessed One, having instructed, urged, roused, and gladdened Venerable Yasa’s mother, father, and former wife with a Dhamma talk, rose from his seat and departed.

30.The four lay friends of Venerable Yasa in Varanasi—sons of prominent families—Vimala, Subahu, Punnaji, and Gavampati, heard that Yasa, the clansman, had shaved off his hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and gone forth from the household life into homelessness. Upon hearing this, they thought: "Surely, this is no inferior Dhamma and Discipline, no inferior going forth, where Yasa the clansman has shaved off his hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and gone forth from the household life into homelessness." They approached Venerable Yasa, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. Then Venerable Yasa took his four lay friends and went to the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat to one side. Sitting to one side, Venerable Yasa said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, these are my four lay friends in Varanasi—sons of prominent families—Vimala, Subahu, Punnaji, and Gavampati. May the Blessed One advise and instruct them." The Blessed One gave them a progressive talk: on generosity, on virtue, on the heavens; on the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual pleasures; and on the benefits of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that their minds were ready, pliable, free from hindrances, uplifted, and confident, he revealed the teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth free from stains would properly absorb dye, so too, while they sat there, the dust-free, stainless vision of the Dhamma arose in them: "Whatever is subject to arising is all subject to cessation." Having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, plunged into the Dhamma, having crossed over doubt, rid of uncertainty, having gained confidence, independent of others in the Teacher’s dispensation, they said to the Blessed One: "May we receive the going forth, Venerable sir, may we receive the higher ordination in the Blessed One’s presence." "Come, bhikkhus," said the Blessed One, "the Dhamma is well-expounded. Live the holy life for the complete ending of suffering." That was the higher ordination of those venerable ones. Then the Blessed One instructed and advised those bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk. As they were being instructed and advised by the Blessed One, their minds were liberated from the taints through non-clinging. At that time, there were eleven arahants in the world.

The going forth of the four lay friends is completed.

31.Then about fifty lay friends of Venerable Yasa, sons of prominent families from the provinces, heard that Yasa, the clansman, had shaved off his hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and gone forth from the household life into homelessness. Upon hearing this, they thought: "Surely, this is no inferior Dhamma and Discipline, no inferior going forth, where Yasa the clansman has shaved off his hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and gone forth from the household life into homelessness." They approached Venerable Yasa, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. Then Venerable Yasa took those fifty lay friends and went to the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat to one side. Sitting to one side, Venerable Yasa said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, these fifty lay friends of mine are sons of prominent families from the provinces. May the Blessed One advise and instruct them." The Blessed One gave them a progressive talk—that is, talk on generosity, talk on virtue, talk on heaven; on the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual pleasures and the benefit of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that their minds were ready, pliable, free from hindrances, uplifted, and confident, he revealed the teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.

Then the Blessed One instructed and advised those bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk. As they were being instructed and advised by the Blessed One, their minds were liberated from the taints through non-clinging. At that time, there were sixty-one arahants in the world.

8.Discourse on Māra

32. Atha kho bhagavā te bhikkhū āmantesi [saṃ. ni. 1.141 mārasaṃyuttepi] – ‘‘muttāhaṃ, bhikkhave, sabbapāsehi, ye dibbā ye ca mānusā. Tumhepi, bhikkhave, muttā sabbapāsehi, ye dibbā ye ca mānusā. Caratha, bhikkhave, cārikaṃ bahujanahitāya bahujanasukhāya lokānukampāya atthāya hitāya sukhāya devamanussānaṃ. Mā ekena dve agamittha. Desetha, bhikkhave, dhammaṃ ādikalyāṇaṃ majjhekalyāṇaṃ pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ sātthaṃ sabyañjanaṃ kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ parisuddhaṃ brahmacariyaṃ pakāsetha. Santi sattā apparajakkhajātikā, assavanatā dhammassa parihāyanti, bhavissanti dhammassa aññātāro. Ahampi, bhikkhave, yena uruvelā senānigamo tenupasaṅkamissāmi dhammadesanāyā’’ti.

32.Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: "I am freed, monks, from all fetters, both divine and human. You too, monks, are freed from all fetters, both divine and human. Go forth, monks, for the good of the many, for the happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, good, and happiness of gods and humans. Let not two go by one road. Teach, monks, the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the meaning and the wording. Proclaim the holy life that is entirely perfect and pure. There are beings with little dust in their eyes, who decline through not hearing the Dhamma. They will be understanders of the Dhamma. I too, monks, will go to Uruvelā, to Senānigama, to teach the Dhamma."

33. Atha kho māro pāpimā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ gāthāya ajjhabhāsi –

33.Then Māra the Wicked One approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he addressed the Blessed One in verse:

‘‘Baddhosi sabbapāsehi, ye dibbā ye ca mānusā;Mahābandhanabaddhosi, na me samaṇa mokkhasī’’ti.

"You are bound by all bonds, both divine and human. You are bound by a great bond; ascetic, you will not escape me."

‘‘Muttāhaṃ [muttohaṃ (sī. syā.)] sabbapāsehi, ye dibbā ye ca mānusā;Mahābandhanamuttomhi, nihato tvamasi antakāti.

"I am freed from all fetters, both heavenly and human; I am freed from the great bond, you are defeated, O End-maker."

[saṃ. ni. 1.151 mārasaṃyuttepi] ‘‘Antalikkhacaro pāso, yvāyaṃ carati mānaso;Tena taṃ bādhayissāmi, na me samaṇa mokkhasīti.

"The snare that travels in the sky, which moves in the mind; With that I will bind you, ascetic, you will not escape me."

[saṃ. ni. 1.1151 mārasaṃyuttepi] ‘‘Rūpā saddā rasā gandhā, phoṭṭhabbā ca manoramā;Ettha me vigato chando, nihato tvamasi antakā’’ti.

"Forms, sounds, tastes, scents, And pleasant tactile objects—all these; Here my desire is extinguished; You are defeated, O End-maker."

Atha kho māro pāpimā – jānāti maṃ bhagavā, jānāti maṃ sugatoti dukkhī dummano

Then Māra the Evil One, knowing, "The Blessed One knows me; the Sublime One knows me," sorrowful and disappointed,

Tatthevantaradhāyīti.

There he vanished.

Mārakathā niṭṭhitā.

The discourse on Māra is finished.

9.The Discussion on Going Forth and Admission to the Order

34. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū nānādisā nānājanapadā pabbajjāpekkhe ca upasampadāpekkhe ca ānenti – bhagavā ne pabbājessati upasampādessatīti.

Evañca pana, bhikkhave, pabbājetabbo upasampādetabbo –

34.At that time, monks were bringing those seeking going-forth and full ordination from various regions and countries, thinking, “The Blessed One will give them going-forth, will give them full ordination.” There, both the monks and those seeking going-forth and full ordination grow weary. Then, while the Blessed One was alone in seclusion, this thought arose in his mind: “Now monks are bringing those seeking going-forth and full ordination from various regions and countries, thinking, ‘The Blessed One will give them going-forth, will give them full ordination.’ There, both the monks and those seeking going-forth and full ordination grow weary. Why do I not allow the monks: ‘Now, monks, you yourselves may give going-forth and full ordination in those various regions and countries.’” Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and, having given a Dhamma talk in connection with this reason and this matter, addressed the monks: “Here, monks, while I was alone in seclusion, this thought arose in my mind: ‘Now monks are bringing those seeking going-forth and full ordination from various regions and countries, thinking, “The Blessed One will give them going-forth, will give them full ordination.” There, both the monks and those seeking going-forth and full ordination grow weary. Why do I not allow the monks: “Now, monks, you yourselves may give going-forth and full ordination in those various regions and countries.”’” I allow, monks, that you yourselves may now give going-forth and full ordination in those various regions and countries. And, monks, one should be given going-forth and full ordination in this way:

Paṭhamaṃ kesamassuṃ ohārāpetvā [ohāretvā (ka.)], kāsāyāni vatthāni acchādāpetvā, ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ kārāpetvā, bhikkhūnaṃ pāde vandāpetvā, ukkuṭikaṃ nisīdāpetvā, añjaliṃ paggaṇhāpetvā, evaṃ vadehīti vattabbo – buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi, dhammaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi, saṅghaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi; dutiyampi buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi, dutiyampi dhammaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi, dutiyampi saṅghaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi; tatiyampi buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi, tatiyampi dhammaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi, tatiyampi saṅghaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmī’’ti. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, imehi tīhi saraṇagamanehi pabbajjaṃ upasampada’’nti.

First, having the hair and beard shaved off, having saffron robes put on, having the upper robe arranged over one shoulder, having been made to bow at the monks’ feet, having been seated in the squatting position, having the hands raised in añjali, one should be instructed to say thus: ‘I take refuge in the Buddha, I take refuge in the Dhamma, I take refuge in the Sangha; for the second time I take refuge in the Buddha, for the second time I take refuge in the Dhamma, for the second time I take refuge in the Sangha; for the third time I take refuge in the Buddha, for the third time I take refuge in the Dhamma, for the third time I take refuge in the Sangha.’ ‘I allow, monks, the going forth and the higher ordination with these three refuges.’

Tīhi saraṇagamanehi upasampadākathā niṭṭhitā.

The discourse on the higher ordination by means of the three refuges is concluded.

10.The Second Discourse on Māra

35. Atha kho bhagavā vassaṃvuṭṭho [vassaṃvuttho (sī.)] bhikkhū āmantesi [saṃ. ni. 1.155] – ‘‘mayhaṃ kho, bhikkhave, yoniso manasikārā yoniso sammappadhānā anuttarā vimutti anuppattā, anuttarā vimutti sacchikatā. Tumhepi, bhikkhave, yoniso manasikārā yoniso sammappadhānā anuttaraṃ vimuttiṃ anupāpuṇātha, anuttaraṃ vimuttiṃ sacchikarothā’’ti. Atha kho māro pāpimā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ gāthāya ajjhabhāsi –

35.Then the Blessed One, having completed the rains retreat, addressed the bhikkhus: ‘Bhikkhus, through wise attention and right strivings, I have attained the unsurpassed liberation and realized the unsurpassed liberation. You too, bhikkhus, through wise attention and right strivings, should attain the unsurpassed liberation and realize the unsurpassed liberation.’ Then Māra the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him with a verse:

‘‘Baddhosi mārapāsehi, ye dibbā ye ca mānusā;Mahābandhanabaddhosi [mārabandhanabaddhosi (sī. syā.)], na me samaṇa mokkhasī’’ti.

‘You are bound by Māra’s snares, both divine and human. You are bound by the great bondage, O ascetic; you will not be freed from me.’

‘‘Muttāhaṃ mārapāsehi, ye dibbā ye ca mānusā;Mahābandhanamuttomhi [mārabandhanamuttomhi (sī. syā.)], nihato tvamasi antakā’’ti.

‘I am freed from Māra’s snares, both divine and human. I am freed from the great bondage; you are defeated, O End-maker!’

Atha kho māro pāpimā – jānāti maṃ bhagavā, jānāti maṃ sugatoti dukkhī dummano

Then Māra the Evil One, thinking, ‘The Blessed One knows me, the Well-gone One knows me,’ sorrowful and disappointed,

Tatthevantaradhāyi.

Right there he vanished.

The Second Discourse on Māra is concluded.

Sāva tesaṃ āyasmantānaṃ upasampadā ahosi.

36.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Bārāṇasī as long as he wished, journeyed towards Uruvelā. Leaving the road, the Blessed One approached a certain grove and, entering that grove, sat down at the foot of a tree. At that time, about thirty Bhaddavaggiyas, companions each with his wife, were amusing themselves in that grove. One of them had no wife, so a courtesan had been brought for him. While they were heedlessly amusing themselves, that courtesan took their belongings and ran away. Then those companions, helping their friend, searching for that woman, wandering through the grove, saw the Blessed One seated at the foot of a tree. Seeing him, they approached and said, "Venerable sir, did the Blessed One see a woman?" "What is it to you, young men, about a woman?" "Here, venerable sir, we, about thirty Bhaddavaggiyas, companions each with his wife, were amusing ourselves in this grove. One of us had no wife, so a courtesan was brought for him. Then, venerable sir, while we were heedlessly amusing ourselves, that courtesan took our belongings and ran away. We, venerable sir, helping our friend, searching for that woman, are wandering through this grove." "What do you think, young men, which is better for you—that you should search for a woman or that you should search for yourselves?" "Indeed, venerable sir, it would be better for us to search for ourselves." "Well then, young men, sit down, I will teach you the Dhamma." "Yes, venerable sir," those Bhaddavaggiya companions replied, and having paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side. The Blessed One gave them a progressive discourse: that is, a talk on generosity, on virtue, on heaven; he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual pleasures and the benefits of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that their minds were ready, pliable, free from hindrances, uplifted, and confident, he revealed the supreme teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth free from stains would properly absorb dye, so too in those very seats the dust-free, stainless Dhamma-eye arose in them: "Whatever is subject to arising is all subject to cessation." They, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, known the Dhamma, plunged into the Dhamma, were free from doubt, rid of perplexity, attained to confidence, and were independent of others in the Teacher's dispensation. They said to the Blessed One, "May we receive the going forth, venerable sir, may we receive the higher ordination in the Blessed One's presence." "Come, bhikkhus!" the Blessed One said, "The Dhamma is well-proclaimed; lead the holy life for the complete ending of suffering." That was the higher ordination of those venerable ones.

The account of the Bhaddavaggiya companions is concluded.

12.The Story of the Miracle at Uruvelā

37. Atha kho bhagavā anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena uruvelā tadavasari. Tena kho pana samayena uruvelāyaṃ tayo jaṭilā paṭivasanti – uruvelakassapo, nadīkassapo, gayākassapoti. Tesu uruvelakassapo jaṭilo pañcannaṃ jaṭilasatānaṃ nāyako hoti, vināyako aggo pamukho pāmokkho. Nadīkassapo jaṭilo tiṇṇaṃ jaṭilasatānaṃ nāyako hoti, vināyako aggo pamukho pāmokkho. Gayākassapo jaṭilo dvinnaṃ jaṭilasatānaṃ nāyako hoti, vināyako aggo pamukho pāmokkho. Atha kho bhagavā yena uruvelakassapassa jaṭilassa assamo tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā uruvelakassapaṃ jaṭilaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sace te, kassapa, agaru, vaseyyāma ekarattaṃ agyāgāre’’ti? ‘‘Na kho me, mahāsamaṇa, garu, caṇḍettha nāgarājā iddhimā āsiviso ghoraviso, so taṃ mā viheṭhesī’’ti. Dutiyampi kho bhagavā uruvelakassapaṃ jaṭilaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sace te, kassapa, agaru, vaseyyāma ekarattaṃ agyāgāre’’ti? ‘‘Na kho me, mahāsamaṇa, garu, caṇḍettha nāgarājā iddhimā āsiviso ghoraviso, so taṃ mā viheṭhesī’’ti. Tatiyampi kho bhagavā uruvelakassapaṃ jaṭilaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sace te, kassapa, agaru, vaseyyāma ekarattaṃ agyāgāre’’ti? ‘‘Na kho me, mahāsamaṇa, garu, caṇḍettha nāgarājā iddhimā āsiviso ghoraviso, so taṃ mā viheṭhesī’’ti. ‘‘Appeva maṃ na viheṭheyya, iṅgha tvaṃ, kassapa, anujānāhi agyāgāra’’nti. ‘‘Vihara, mahāsamaṇa, yathāsukha’’nti. Atha kho bhagavā agyāgāraṃ pavisitvā tiṇasanthārakaṃ paññapetvā nisīdi pallaṅkaṃ ābhujitvā ujuṃ kāyaṃ paṇidhāya parimukhaṃ satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā.

37.Then the Blessed One, wandering by stages, arrived at Uruvelā. At that time, three ascetics with matted hair were living in Uruvelā: Uruvelā Kassapa, Nadī Kassapa, and Gayā Kassapa. Among them, Uruvelā Kassapa was the leader, guide, chief, foremost, and supreme of five hundred ascetics with matted hair. Nadī Kassapa was the leader, guide, chief, foremost, and supreme of three hundred ascetics with matted hair. Gayā Kassapa was the leader, guide, chief, foremost, and supreme of two hundred ascetics with matted hair. Then the Blessed One approached the hermitage of Uruvelā Kassapa and said to Uruvelā Kassapa, the ascetic with matted hair: "If it is not troublesome to you, Kassapa, I would like to stay one night in the fire-hall." "It is not troublesome to me, great ascetic, but there is a fierce nāga-king there, powerful, venomous with dreadful poison. He might harm you." A second time, the Blessed One said to Uruvelā Kassapa, the ascetic with matted hair: "If it is not troublesome to you, Kassapa, I would like to stay one night in the fire-hall." "It is not troublesome to me, great ascetic, but there is a fierce nāga-king there, powerful, venomous with dreadful poison. He might harm you." A third time, the Blessed One said to Uruvelā Kassapa, the ascetic with matted hair: "If it is not troublesome to you, Kassapa, I would like to stay one night in the fire-hall." "It is not troublesome to me, great ascetic, but there is a fierce nāga-king there, powerful, venomous with dreadful poison. He might harm you." "Perhaps he will not harm me. Please, Kassapa, permit me the fire-hall." "Dwell, great ascetic, as you please." Then the Blessed One entered the fire-hall, spread out a grass mat, sat down cross-legged, straightened his body, and established mindfulness facing forward.

38. Addasā kho so nāgo bhagavantaṃ paviṭṭhaṃ, disvāna dummano [dukkhī dummano (sī. syā.)] padhūpāyi [pakhūpāsi (ka.)]. Atha kho bhagavato etadahosi – ‘‘yaṃnūnāhaṃ imassa nāgassa anupahacca chaviñca cammañca maṃsañca nhāruñca aṭṭhiñca aṭṭhimiñjañca tejasā tejaṃ pariyādiyeyya’’nti. Atha kho bhagavā tathārūpaṃ iddhābhisaṅkhāraṃ abhisaṅkharitvā padhūpāyi. Atha kho so nāgo makkhaṃ asahamāno pajjali. Bhagavāpi tejodhātuṃ samāpajjitvā pajjali. Ubhinnaṃ sajotibhūtānaṃ agyāgāraṃ ādittaṃ viya hoti sampajjalitaṃ sajotibhūtaṃ. Atha kho te jaṭilā agyāgāraṃ parivāretvā evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘abhirūpo vata bho mahāsamaṇo nāgena viheṭhiyatī’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā tassā rattiyā accayena tassa nāgassa anupahacca chaviñca cammañca maṃsañca nhāruñca aṭṭhiñca aṭṭhimiñjañca tejasā tejaṃ pariyādiyitvā patte pakkhipitvā uruvelakassapassa jaṭilassa dassesi – ‘‘ayaṃ te, kassapa, nāgo pariyādinno [pariyādiṇṇo (ka.)] assa tejasā tejo’’ti. Atha kho uruvelakassapassa jaṭilassa etadahosi – ‘‘mahiddhiko kho mahāsamaṇo mahānubhāvo, yatra hi nāma caṇḍassa nāgarājassa iddhimato āsivisassa ghoravisassa tejasā tejaṃ pariyādiyissati, natveva ca kho arahā yathā aha’’nti.

38.Then the nāga saw the Blessed One entering, and upon seeing him, it became distressed and emitted smoke. Then the Blessed One thought: 'Suppose I were to overcome this nāga’s fiery power with my own, without harming its skin, hide, flesh, sinews, bones, or bone marrow.' Then the Blessed One produced such a psychic formation that he too emitted smoke. Unable to bear the malice, the nāga burst into flames. The Blessed One, too, attained the fire element and blazed up. When both blazed forth radiantly, the fire-hall seemed ablaze and luminous. Then those ascetics, surrounding the fire-hall, said: 'How handsome the great ascetic is, yet he is being harassed by the nāga!' Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One, without harming the nāga’s skin, hide, flesh, sinews, bones, or bone marrow, overcame its fiery power with his own. He placed it in his alms bowl and showed it to Uruvelā Kassapa the ascetic, saying: 'Here, Kassapa, this nāga has been overcome by my fiery power.' Then Uruvelā Kassapa thought: 'The great ascetic is indeed mighty and powerful, for he has overcome the fiery power of this fierce, venomous nāga-king. But he is not an arahant like me.'

39.

Nerañjarāyaṃ bhagavā, uruvelakassapaṃ jaṭilaṃ avoca;‘‘Sace te kassapa agaru, viharemu ajjaṇho aggisālamhī’’ti [aggisaraṇamhīti (sī. syā.)].

On the bank of the Nerañjarā River, the Blessed One said to Uruvelā Kassapa the ascetic: 'If it is not troublesome to you, Kassapa, let us stay tonight in the fire-hall.'

‘‘Na kho me mahāsamaṇa garu;Phāsukāmova taṃ nivāremi;Caṇḍettha nāgarājā;Iddhimā āsiviso ghoraviso;So taṃ mā viheṭhesī’’ti.

'It is not troublesome to me, Great Ascetic; I warn you for your own ease. For the nāga-king here is fierce, powerful, a venomous viper, deadly poisonous; may he not harm you.'

‘‘Appeva maṃ na viheṭheyya;Iṅgha tvaṃ kassapa anujānāhi agyāgāra’’nti;Dinnanti naṃ viditvā;Abhīto [asambhīto (sī.)] pāvisi bhayamatīto.

'Perhaps he will not harm me. Come now, Kassapa, permit me the fire-hall.' Knowing it was given, fearless and having overcome fear, he entered.

Disvā isiṃ paviṭṭhaṃ, ahināgo dummano padhūpāyi;Sumanamanaso adhimano [avimano (katthaci), navimano (syā.)], manussanāgopi tattha padhūpāyi.

Seeing the sage enter, the nāga, displeased, fumed; With a joyful mind and elated, the human nāga also fumed there.

Makkhañca asahamāno, ahināgo pāvakova pajjali;Tejodhātusu kusalo, manussanāgopi tattha pajjali.

Unable to bear the malice, the nāga blazed like fire; Skilled in the fire element, the human nāga also blazed there.

Ubhinnaṃ sajotibhūtānaṃ;Agyāgāraṃ ādittaṃ hoti sampajjalitaṃ sajotibhūtaṃ;Udicchare jaṭilā;‘‘Abhirūpo vata bho mahāsamaṇo;Nāgena viheṭhiyatī’’ti bhaṇanti.

The fire-hall of the two shining ones was ablaze, burning brightly. The ascetics with matted hair cried out: "Indeed, the Great Ascetic is beautiful! He is being harassed by a nāga!" they said.

Atha tassā rattiyā [atha rattiyā (sī. syā.)] accayena;Hatā nāgassa acciyo honti [ahināgassa acciyo na honti (sī. syā.)];Iddhimato pana ṭhitā [iddhimato panuṭṭhitā (sī.)];Anekavaṇṇā acciyo honti.

Then, with the passing of that night, the fires of the nāga were extinguished; but for the one possessed of psychic power, they remained; the fires were of various colors.

Nīlā atha lohitikā;Mañjiṭṭhā pītakā phalikavaṇṇāyo;Aṅgīrasassa kāye;Anekavaṇṇā acciyo honti.

Blue, then red; Madder, yellow, crystal-hued; In Angirasa's body flames of many colors there were.

Pattamhi odahitvā;Ahināgaṃ brāhmaṇassa dassesi;‘‘Ayaṃ te kassapa nāgo;Pariyādinno assa tejasā tejo’’ti.

Having placed it in the bowl, he showed the brahmin the nāga: "Here, Kassapa, is your nāga, overcome, its fiery power by my own."

Atha kho uruvelakassapo jaṭilo bhagavato iminā iddhipāṭihāriyena abhippasanno bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘idheva, mahāsamaṇa, vihara, ahaṃ te [te upaṭṭhāmi (itipi)] dhuvabhattenā’’ti.

Then Uruvelā Kassapa, the matted-hair ascetic, being exceedingly pleased by this display of psychic power, said to the Blessed One: "Dwell right here, Great Ascetic, and I will provide you with regular meals."

Paṭhamaṃ pāṭihāriyaṃ.

The first wonder.

40. Atha kho bhagavā uruvelakassapassa jaṭilassa assamassa avidūre aññatarasmiṃ vanasaṇḍe vihāsi. Atha kho cattāro mahārājāno abhikkantāya rattiyā abhikkantavaṇṇā kevalakappaṃ vanasaṇḍaṃ obhāsetvā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā catuddisā aṭṭhaṃsu seyyathāpi mahantā aggikkhandhā. Atha kho uruvelakassapo jaṭilo tassā rattiyā accayena yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kālo, mahāsamaṇa, niṭṭhitaṃ bhattaṃ. Ke nu kho te, mahāsamaṇa, abhikkantāya rattiyā abhikkantavaṇṇā kevalakappaṃ vanasaṇḍaṃ obhāsetvā yena tvaṃ tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā taṃ abhivādetvā catuddisā aṭṭhaṃsu ‘‘seyyathāpi mahantā aggikkhandhā’’ti. ‘‘Ete kho, kassapa, cattāro mahārājāno yenāhaṃ tenupasaṅkamiṃsu dhammassavanāyā’’ti. Atha kho uruvelakassapassa jaṭilassa etadahosi – ‘‘mahiddhiko kho mahāsamaṇo mahānubhāvo, yatra hi nāma cattāropi mahārājāno upasaṅkamissanti dhammassavanāya, na tveva ca kho arahā yathā aha’’nti. Atha kho bhagavā uruvelakassapassa jaṭilassa bhattaṃ bhuñjitvā tasmiṃyeva vanasaṇḍe vihāsi.

40.Then the Blessed One dwelt in a certain grove not far from the hermitage of Uruvelā Kassapa, the matted-hair ascetic. Then, as the night was far advanced, the Four Great Kings, with surpassing radiance, illuminating the entire grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and stood on four sides, like great masses of fire. Then, when the night had passed, Uruvelā Kassapa the matted-hair ascetic approached the Blessed One and said: "It is time, Great Ascetic; the meal is ready. Who were those, Great Ascetic, who as the night was far advanced, with surpassing radiance, illuminating the entire grove, approached you, paid homage, and stood on four sides like great masses of fire?" "Those, Kassapa, were the Four Great Kings who came to me to hear the Dhamma." Then Uruvelā Kassapa thought: "The Great Ascetic is indeed of great power and might, since even the Four Great Kings approach him to hear the Dhamma, but he is not an arahant like me." Then the Blessed One, having eaten the meal, dwelt in that same grove.

Dutiyaṃ pāṭihāriyaṃ.

The second wonder.

41. Atha kho sakko devānamindo abhikkantāya rattiyā abhikkantavaṇṇo kevalakappaṃ vanasaṇḍaṃ obhāsetvā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi seyyathāpi mahāaggikkhandho, purimāhi vaṇṇanibhāhi abhikkantataro ca paṇītataro ca. Atha kho uruvelakassapo jaṭilo tassā rattiyā accayena yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kālo, mahāsamaṇa, niṭṭhitaṃ bhattaṃ. Ko nu kho so, mahāsamaṇa, abhikkantāya rattiyā abhikkantavaṇṇo kevalakappaṃ vanasaṇḍaṃ obhāsetvā yena tvaṃ tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā taṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi seyyathāpi mahāaggikkhandho, purimāhi vaṇṇanibhāhi abhikkantataro ca paṇītataro cā’’ti? ‘‘Eso kho, kassapa, sakko devānamindo yenāhaṃ tenupasaṅkami dhammassavanāyā’’ti. Atha kho uruvelakassapassa jaṭilassa etadahosi – ‘‘mahiddhiko kho mahāsamaṇo mahānubhāvo, yatra hi nāma sakkopi devānamindo upasaṅkamissati dhammassavanāya, na tveva ca kho arahā yathā aha’’nti. Atha kho bhagavā uruvelakassapassa jaṭilassa bhattaṃ bhuñjitvā tasmiṃyeva vanasaṇḍe vihāsi.

41.Then Sakka, lord of the devas, when the night was far advanced, with surpassing radiance, illuminating the entire grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side like a great mass of fire, more splendid and refined than before. Then, when the night had passed, Uruvelā Kassapa the matted-hair ascetic approached the Blessed One and said: "It is time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready. Who was that, Great Ascetic, who when the night was far advanced, with surpassing radiance, illuminating the entire grove, approached you, paid homage, and stood to one side like a great mass of fire, more splendid and refined than before?" "That, Kassapa, was Sakka, lord of the devas, who came to me to hear the Dhamma." Then Uruvelā Kassapa thought: "The Great Ascetic is indeed of great power and might, since even Sakka, lord of the devas, comes to hear the Dhamma, but he is not an arahant like me." Then the Blessed One, having eaten the meal, remained in that same grove.

Tatiyaṃ pāṭihāriyaṃ.

The third wonder.

42. Atha kho brahmā sahampati abhikkantāya rattiyā abhikkantavaṇṇo kevalakappaṃ vanasaṇḍaṃ obhāsetvā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi seyyathāpi mahāaggikkhandho, purimāhi vaṇṇanibhāhi abhikkantataro ca paṇītataro ca. Atha kho uruvelakassapo jaṭilo tassā rattiyā accayena yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kālo, mahāsamaṇa, niṭṭhitaṃ bhattaṃ. Ko nu kho so, mahāsamaṇa, abhikkantāya rattiyā abhikkantavaṇṇo kevalakappaṃ vanasaṇḍaṃ obhāsetvā yena tvaṃ tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā taṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi seyyathāpi mahāaggikkhandho, purimāhi vaṇṇanibhāhi abhikkantataro ca paṇītataro cā’’ti? ‘‘Eso kho, kassapa, brahmā sahampati yenāhaṃ tenupasaṅkami dhammassavanāyā’’ti. Atha kho uruvelakassapassa jaṭilassa etadahosi – ‘‘mahiddhiko kho mahāsamaṇo mahānubhāvo, yatra hi nāma brahmāpi sahampati upasaṅkamissati dhammassavanāya, na tveva ca kho arahā yathā aha’’nti. Atha kho bhagavā uruvelakassapassa jaṭilassa bhattaṃ bhuñjitvā tasmiṃyeva vanasaṇḍe vihāsi.

42.Then Brahmā Sahampati, when the night was far advanced, illuminating the entire grove with his surpassing radiance, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side, shining like a great mass of fire, more surpassingly radiant and excellent than his former radiance. Then, when that night had passed, the ascetic Uruvelā Kassapa approached the Blessed One and said: “It is time, great ascetic, the meal is ready. Who was that, great ascetic, who, when the night was far advanced, illuminating the entire grove with his surpassing radiance, approached you, paid homage to you, and stood to one side, shining like a great mass of fire, more surpassingly radiant and excellent than his former radiance?” “That, Kassapa, was Brahmā Sahampati, who approached me to hear the Dhamma.” Then it occurred to the ascetic Uruvelā Kassapa: “The great ascetic is indeed of great power and might, since even Brahmā Sahampati comes to hear the Dhamma. Yet he is not an arahant like me.” Then the Blessed One, having eaten the meal, remained dwelling in that same grove.

Catutthaṃ pāṭihāriyaṃ.

The fourth wonder.

43. Tena kho pana samayena uruvelakassapassa jaṭilassa mahāyañño paccupaṭṭhito hoti, kevalakappā ca aṅgamagadhā pahūtaṃ khādanīyaṃ bhojanīyaṃ ādāya abhikkamitukāmā honti.

Api ca mayaṃ taṃ sarāma – kiṃ nu kho mahāsamaṇo nāgacchatīti? Khādanīyassa ca bhojanīyassa ca te paṭivīso [paṭiviṃso (sī.), paṭiviso (syā.)] ṭhapito’’ti.

Atha kho bhagavā uruvelakassapassa jaṭilassa bhattaṃ bhuñjitvā tasmiṃyeva vanasaṇḍe vihāsi.

43.Now at that time, a great sacrificial ceremony was prepared for the ascetic Uruvelā Kassapa. And the entire populace of Aṅga and Magadha were intending to come, bringing abundant solid and soft food. Then it occurred to the ascetic Uruvelā Kassapa: “Now a great sacrificial ceremony is prepared for me, and the entire populace of Aṅga and Magadha will come, bringing abundant solid and soft food. If the great ascetic performs a miracle in the midst of the great assembly, the great ascetic’s gain and honor will increase, and my gain and honor will decline. Oh, if only the great ascetic would not come tomorrow!” Then the Blessed One, knowing with his mind the thought of the ascetic Uruvelā Kassapa, went to Uttarakuru, brought almsfood from there, ate it at Lake Anotatta, and spent the day there. Then, when the night had passed, the ascetic Uruvelā Kassapa approached the Blessed One and said to him: “It is time, great ascetic, the meal is ready. Why, great ascetic, did you not come yesterday? We were indeed remembering you, thinking: ‘Why does the great ascetic not come?’ A portion of solid and soft food was set aside for you.” “Did it not occur to you, Kassapa: ‘Now a great sacrificial ceremony is prepared for me, and the entire populace of Aṅga and Magadha will come, bringing abundant solid and soft food. If the great ascetic performs a miracle in the midst of the great assembly, the great ascetic’s gain and honor will increase, and my gain and honor will decline. Oh, if only the great ascetic would not come tomorrow!’? Knowing with my mind, Kassapa, your thought, I went to Uttarakuru, brought almsfood from there, ate it at Lake Anotatta, and spent the day there.” Then it occurred to the ascetic Uruvelā Kassapa: “The great ascetic is indeed of great power and might, for he can know the thoughts of others with his mind. Yet he is not an arahant like me.” Then the Blessed One, having eaten the meal, remained dwelling in that same grove.

44.At that time, a rag-robe had appeared for the Blessed One. Then it occurred to the Blessed One: “Where now shall I wash this rag-robe?” Then Sakka, lord of the devas, knowing with his mind the Blessed One’s thought, dug a pond with his hand and said to the Blessed One: “Here, venerable sir, let the Blessed One wash the rag-robe.” Then it occurred to the Blessed One: “On what now shall I rub this rag-robe?” Then Sakka, lord of the devas, knowing with his mind the Blessed One’s thought, placed a large stone: “Here, venerable sir, let the Blessed One rub the rag-robe.” Then it occurred to the Blessed One: “What now shall I hold onto to climb out?” Then the deity dwelling in the kakudha tree, knowing with his mind the Blessed One’s thought, bent down a branch: “Here, venerable sir, let the Blessed One hold on and climb out.” Then it occurred to the Blessed One: “Where now shall I spread out this rag-robe to dry?” Then Sakka, lord of the devas, knowing with his mind the Blessed One’s thought, placed a large stone: “Here, venerable sir, let the Blessed One spread out the rag-robe to dry.” Then, when the night had passed, the ascetic Uruvelā Kassapa approached the Blessed One and said: “It is time, great ascetic, the meal is ready. But, great ascetic, this pond was not here before; now it is here. These stones were not placed here before; by whom were these stones placed here? The branch of this kakudha tree was not bent down before; now it is bent down.” “Here, Kassapa, a rag-robe had appeared for me. Then it occurred to me: ‘Where now shall I wash this rag-robe?’ Then, Kassapa, Sakka, lord of the devas, knowing with his mind my thought, dug a pond with his hand and said to me: ‘Here, venerable sir, let the Blessed One wash the rag-robe.’ This pond, Kassapa, was dug by a non-human hand. Then it occurred to me: ‘On what now shall I rub this rag-robe?’ Then, Kassapa, Sakka, lord of the devas, knowing with his mind my thought, placed a large stone: ‘Here, venerable sir, let the Blessed One rub the rag-robe.’ This stone, Kassapa, was placed by a non-human. Then it occurred to me: ‘What now shall I hold onto to climb out?’ Then, Kassapa, the deity dwelling in the kakudha tree, knowing with his mind my thought, bent down a branch: ‘Here, venerable sir, let the Blessed One hold on and climb out.’ This kakudha tree, Kassapa, is one that offers its branch. Then it occurred to me: ‘Where now shall I spread out this rag-robe to dry?’ Then, Kassapa, Sakka, lord of the devas, knowing with his mind my thought, placed a large stone: ‘Here, venerable sir, let the Blessed One spread out the rag-robe to dry.’ This stone, Kassapa, was placed by a non-human.” Then it occurred to the ascetic Uruvelā Kassapa: “The great ascetic is indeed of great power and might, since even Sakka, lord of the devas, performs services for him. Yet he is not an arahant like me.” Then the Blessed One, having eaten the meal, remained dwelling in that same grove.

Then, when that night had passed, Uruvelā Kassapa the matted-hair ascetic approached the Blessed One and, on arrival, announced the time to him: “It is time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.” “Go, Kassapa, I am coming.” Dismissing Uruvelā Kassapa the matted-hair ascetic, he went to the Jambu tree by which Jambudīpa is known, took a fruit from it, arrived back before him, and sat down in the fire-chamber. Uruvelā Kassapa saw the Blessed One seated in the fire-chamber and said to him: “By what path did you come, Great Ascetic? I left before you, but you arrived before me and are seated in the fire-chamber.” “Here, Kassapa, after dismissing you, I went to the Jambu tree by which Jambudīpa is known, took a fruit from it, arrived back before you, and sat down in the fire-chamber. This, Kassapa, is a rose-apple fruit endowed with color, fragrance, and taste. If you wish, partake of it.” “Enough, Great Ascetic, you yourself are worthy of it, you yourself partake of it.” Then it occurred to Uruvelā Kassapa: “The Great Ascetic is indeed of great power and might, since, after dismissing me first, he went to the Jambu tree by which Jambudīpa is known, took a fruit from it, arrived back before me, and sat down in the fire-chamber. But still, he is not an arahant like me.” Then the Blessed One, having eaten the meal of Uruvelā Kassapa, remained right there in that grove.

45.Then, when the night had passed, the ascetic Uruvelā Kassapa approached the Blessed One, and having approached, announced the time to the Blessed One: “It is time, great ascetic, the meal is ready.” “Go, Kassapa, I shall come.” Having dismissed the ascetic Uruvelā Kassapa, he went to the jambu tree by which Jambudīpa is known as ‘Jambudīpa’; then to the mango tree near which… to the emblic myrobalan tree near which… to the yellow myrobalan tree near which… then to the Tāvatiṃsa realm, took a pāricchattaka flower, and arriving before him, sat down in the fire chamber. The ascetic Uruvelā Kassapa saw the Blessed One seated in the fire chamber, and upon seeing him, said: “By which path, great ascetic, did you come? I departed before you, yet you arrived before me and are seated in the fire chamber.” “Here, Kassapa, after dismissing you, I went to the Tāvatiṃsa realm, took a pāricchattaka flower, and arriving before you, sat down in the fire chamber. This, Kassapa, is a pāricchattaka flower, endowed with color and fragrance. (If you wish, take it.)” “Enough, great ascetic, you are the one worthy of it, you should take it.” Then it occurred to the ascetic Uruvelā Kassapa: “The great ascetic is indeed of great power and might, in that after dismissing me before, he could go to the Tāvatiṃsa realm, take a pāricchattaka flower, arrive before me, and sit down in the fire chamber. Yet he is not an arahant like me.”

46.At that time, those matted-hair ascetics, wishing to tend the fire, were unable to split the firewood. Then it occurred to those matted-hair ascetics: “Surely the great ascetic possesses psychic power, since we cannot split the firewood.” Then the Blessed One said to Uruvela Kassapa the matted-hair ascetic: “Let the firewood be split, Kassapa.” “Let it be split, great ascetic.” Instantly, five hundred pieces of firewood split. Then it occurred to Uruvela Kassapa the matted-hair ascetic: “The great ascetic possesses great psychic power and might, since even the firewood splits. But he is not an arahant as I am.”

47.At that time, those matted-hair ascetics, wishing to tend the fire, were unable to kindle the fire. Then it occurred to those matted-hair ascetics: “Surely the great ascetic possesses psychic power, since we are unable to kindle the fire.” Then the Blessed One said to Uruvela Kassapa the matted-hair ascetic: “Let the fires be kindled, Kassapa.” “Let them be kindled, great ascetic.” Instantly, five hundred fires blazed up. Then it occurred to Uruvela Kassapa the matted-hair ascetic: “The great ascetic possesses great psychic power and might, since even the fires blaze up. But he is not an arahant as I am.”

48.At that time, those matted-hair ascetics, having tended the fire, were unable to extinguish the fire. Then it occurred to those matted-hair ascetics: “Surely the great ascetic possesses psychic power, since we cannot extinguish the fire.” Then the Blessed One said to Uruvela Kassapa the matted-hair ascetic: “Let the fires be extinguished, Kassapa.” “Let them be extinguished, great ascetic.” Instantly, five hundred fires were extinguished. Then it occurred to Uruvela Kassapa the matted-hair ascetic: “The great ascetic possesses great psychic power and might, since even the fires are extinguished. But he is not an arahant as I am.”

49.At that time, during the cold winter nights, at the time of snowfall, those matted-hair ascetics would emerge from and plunge into the Nerañjarā River, performing immersions and submersions. Then the Blessed One manifested five hundred heated braziers where those matted-hair ascetics could dry themselves after coming out. Then it occurred to those matted-hair ascetics: “Surely the great ascetic possesses psychic power, since these heated braziers have been created.” Then it occurred to Uruvela Kassapa the matted-hair ascetic: “The great ascetic possesses great psychic power and might, since he can manifest so many heated braziers. But he is not an arahant as I am.”

50.Now at that time, a great untimely rainstorm poured down, and a great flood arose. The place where the Blessed One was staying was not submerged by the water. Then it occurred to the Blessed One: “Why don’t I push back the water all around and walk in the middle on dry ground?” Then the Blessed One pushed back the water all around and walked in the middle on dry ground. Then Uruvela Kassapa the matted-hair ascetic thought: “Surely the great ascetic has been swept away by the water!” So he took a boat and went with several other matted-hair ascetics to the place where the Blessed One was staying. Uruvela Kassapa the matted-hair ascetic saw the Blessed One pushing back the water all around and walking in the middle on dry ground. Seeing this, he said to the Blessed One: “Is that you, great ascetic?” “It is I, Kassapa,” the Blessed One replied, rising into the air and appearing on the boat. Then it occurred to Uruvela Kassapa the matted-hair ascetic: “The great ascetic possesses great psychic power and might, since even the water does not sweep him away. But he is not an arahant as I am.”

51.Then it occurred to the Blessed One: “For a long time this foolish man will be thinking, ‘The great ascetic possesses great psychic power and might, yet he is not an arahant as I am.’ Suppose I were to stir this matted-hair ascetic.” Then the Blessed One said to Uruvela Kassapa the matted-hair ascetic: “You, Kassapa, are not an arahant, nor have you attained the path to arahantship. And that practice of yours does not exist by which you might be an arahant or have attained the path to arahantship.” Then Uruvela Kassapa the matted-hair ascetic bowed his head at the Blessed One’s feet and said: “May I receive the going forth, Venerable Sir, in the presence of the Blessed One; may I receive full ordination.” “But you, Kassapa, are the leader, the guide, the chief, the foremost, the principal of five hundred matted-hair ascetics. Go and consult them first, so they may do as they think fit.” Then Uruvela Kassapa the matted-hair ascetic went to those matted-hair ascetics and said: “I wish, friends, to lead the holy life under the great ascetic. Let the venerable ones do as they think fit.” “For a long time, friend, we have been pleased with the great ascetic. If you lead the holy life under the great ascetic, we will all lead the holy life under the great ascetic.” Then those matted-hair ascetics cast their hair, matted locks, ash-implements, and fire-offering implements into the water and approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they bowed their heads at the Blessed One’s feet and said: “May we receive the going forth, Venerable Sir, in the presence of the Blessed One; may we receive full ordination.” “Come, monks,” the Blessed One said, “the Dhamma is well proclaimed. Live the holy life for the complete ending of suffering.” That itself was their ordination as venerable ones.”

52.Then Nadīkassapa the matted-hair ascetic saw hair, matted locks, ash-implements, and fire-offering implements being carried away by the water. Seeing this, it occurred to him: “Surely some misfortune has befallen my brother!” He sent the matted-hair ascetics, saying: “Go and find out about my brother.” And together with three hundred matted-hair ascetics, he approached the Venerable Uruvela Kassapa. Having approached, he said to the Venerable Uruvela Kassapa: “Is this better, Kassapa?” “Yes, friend, this is better.” Then those matted-hair ascetics, having cast their hair, matted locks, ash-implements, and fire-offering implements into the water, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they bowed their heads at the Blessed One’s feet and said: “May we receive the going forth, Venerable Sir, in the presence of the Blessed One; may we receive full ordination.” “Come, monks,” the Blessed One said, “the Dhamma is well proclaimed.

53.Then Gayākassapa the matted-hair ascetic saw hair, matted locks, ash-implements, and fire-offering implements being carried away by the water. Seeing this, it occurred to him: “Surely some misfortune has befallen my brothers!” He sent the matted-hair ascetics, saying: “Go and find out about my brothers.” And together with two hundred matted-hair ascetics, he approached the Venerable Uruvela Kassapa. Having approached, he said to the Venerable Uruvela Kassapa: “Is this better, Kassapa?” “Yes, friend, this is better.” Then those matted-hair ascetics, having cast their hair, matted locks, ash-implements, and fire-offering implements into the water, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they bowed their heads at the Blessed One’s feet and said: “May we receive the going forth, Venerable Sir, in the presence of the Blessed One; may we receive full ordination.” “Come, monks,” the Blessed One said, “the Dhamma is well proclaimed.

By the Blessed One's resolve, five hundred logs did not split, yet they split; fires did not blaze, yet they blazed; fires were not extinguished, yet they were extinguished; he manifested five hundred fire-mouthed tongs. In this way, there were one thousand five hundred miracles.

54.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Uruvelā as long as he pleased, proceeded to Gayāsīsa with a great assembly of monks, a thousand strong, all former matted-hair ascetics. There, it is said, the Blessed One dwelt at Gayāsīsa together with a thousand monks. There the Blessed One addressed the monks:

"Monks, all is burning. And what, monks, is all burning? The eye is burning, forms are burning, eye-consciousness is burning, eye-contact is burning, and whatever feeling arises dependent on eye-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant—that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of lust, the fire of hate, the fire of delusion; burning with birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, I say. The ear is burning, sounds are burning, ear-consciousness is burning, ear-contact is burning, and whatever feeling arises dependent on ear-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant—that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of lust, the fire of hate, the fire of delusion; burning with birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, I say. The nose is burning, odors are burning, nose-consciousness is burning, nose-contact is burning, and whatever feeling arises dependent on nose-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant—that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of lust, the fire of hate, the fire of delusion; burning with birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, I say. The tongue is burning, flavors are burning, tongue-consciousness is burning, tongue-contact is burning, and whatever feeling arises dependent on tongue-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant—that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of lust, the fire of hate, the fire of delusion; burning with birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, I say. The body is burning, tangibles are burning, body-consciousness is burning, body-contact is burning, and whatever feeling arises dependent on body-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant—that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of lust, the fire of hate, the fire of delusion; burning with birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, I say. The mind is burning, mental objects are burning, mind-consciousness is burning, mind-contact is burning, and whatever feeling arises dependent on mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant—that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of lust, the fire of hate, the fire of delusion; burning with birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, I say."

‘‘Evaṃ passaṃ, bhikkhave, sutavā ariyasāvako cakkhusmimpi nibbindati, rūpesupi nibbindati, cakkhuviññāṇepi nibbindati, cakkhusamphassepi nibbindati, yamidaṃ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā, tasmimpi nibbindati. Sotasmimpi nibbindati, saddesupi nibbindati…pe… ghānasmimpi nibbindati, gandhesupi nibbindati…pe… jivhāyapi nibbindati, rasesupi nibbindati…pe… kāyasmimpi nibbindati, phoṭṭhabbesupi nibbindati…pe… manasmimpi nibbindati, dhammesupi nibbindati, manoviññāṇepi nibbindati, manosamphassepi nibbindati, yamidaṃ manosamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tasmimpi nibbindati, nibbindaṃ virajjati, virāgā vimuccati, vimuttasmiṃ vimuttamiti ñāṇaṃ hoti. Khīṇā jāti, vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ, kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ, nāparaṃ itthattāyāti pajānātī’’ti.

"Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with the eye, disenchanted with forms, disenchanted with eye-consciousness, disenchanted with eye-contact, and disenchanted with whatever feeling arises dependent on eye-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant. They become disenchanted with the ear, disenchanted with sounds... disenchanted with the nose, disenchanted with odors... disenchanted with the tongue, disenchanted with tastes... disenchanted with the body, disenchanted with tangibles... disenchanted with the mind, disenchanted with mental phenomena, disenchanted with mind-consciousness, disenchanted with mind-contact, and disenchanted with whatever feeling arises dependent on mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant. Being disenchanted, they become dispassionate. Through dispassion, they are liberated. When liberated, there is the knowledge, 'Liberated.' They understand: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.'"

Imasmiñca pana veyyākaraṇasmiṃ bhaññamāne tassa bhikkhusahassassa anupādāya āsavehi cittāni vimucciṃsu.

And while this exposition was being delivered, the minds of those thousand bhikkhus were liberated from the taints through non-clinging.

Ādittapariyāyasuttaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ.

The Fire Sermon is concluded.

Uruvelapāṭihāriyaṃ tatiyabhāṇavāro niṭṭhito.

The Uruvelā Miracle, the Third Recitation Section, is completed.

13.The Story of the Assembly with Bimbisāra

55. Atha kho bhagavā gayāsīse yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena rājagahaṃ tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi, mahatā bhikkhusaṅghena saddhiṃ bhikkhusahassena sabbeheva purāṇajaṭilehi. Atha kho bhagavā anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena rājagahaṃ tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā rājagahe viharati laṭṭhivane [laṭṭhivanuyyāne (syā.)] suppatiṭṭhe cetiye. Assosi kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro – samaṇo khalu bho gotamo sakyaputto sakyakulā pabbajito rājagahaṃ anuppatto rājagahe viharati laṭṭhivane suppatiṭṭhe cetiye. Taṃ kho pana bhagavantaṃ [bhavantaṃ (ka.)] gotamaṃ evaṃ kalyāṇo kittisaddo abbhuggato – itipi so bhagavā arahaṃ sammāsambuddho vijjācaraṇasampanno sugato lokavidū anuttaro purisadammasārathi satthā devamanussānaṃ buddho bhagavā [bhagavāti (ka.)]. So imaṃ lokaṃ sadevakaṃ samārakaṃ sabrahmakaṃ sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiṃ pajaṃ sadevamanussaṃ sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedeti. So dhammaṃ deseti ādikalyāṇaṃ majjhekalyāṇaṃ pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ sātthaṃ sabyañjanaṃ kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ parisuddhaṃ brahmacariyaṃ pakāseti. Sādhu kho pana tathārūpānaṃ arahataṃ dassanaṃ hotīti.

55.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Gayāsīsa as long as he pleased, set out on a journey toward Rājagaha with a large company of monks—a thousand monks, all of whom had formerly been matted-hair ascetics. Traveling stage by stage, the Blessed One eventually arrived at Rājagaha. There he stayed at the Laṭṭhivana grove, the Suppatiṭṭha shrine. Now King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha heard: “The ascetic Gotama, the Sakyan son who went forth from the Sakyan clan, has arrived at Rājagaha and is staying at the Laṭṭhivana grove, the Suppatiṭṭha shrine. Indeed, this Blessed One Gotama is praised with such a glorious reputation: ‘That Blessed One is an Arahant, a Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ He makes known this world—with its devas, Māras, and Brahmās, this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its devas and humans—having realized it himself with direct knowledge. He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals a spiritual life that is entirely perfect and pure. It is good to see such Arahants.”

Atha kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro dvādasanahutehi [dvādasaniyutehi (yojanā)] māgadhikehi brāhmaṇagahapatikehi parivuto yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Tepi kho dvādasanahutā māgadhikā brāhmaṇagahapatikā appekacce bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu, appekacce bhagavatā saddhiṃ sammodiṃsu, sammodanīyaṃ kathaṃ sāraṇīyaṃ vītisāretvā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu, appekacce yena bhagavā tenañjaliṃ paṇāmetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu, appekacce bhagavato santike nāmagottaṃ sāvetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu, appekacce tuṇhībhūtā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu. Atha kho tesaṃ dvādasanahutānaṃ [dvādasaniyutānaṃ (yojanā)] māgadhikānaṃ brāhmaṇagahapatikānaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kiṃ nu kho mahāsamaṇo uruvelakassape brahmacariyaṃ carati, udāhu uruvelakassapo mahāsamaṇe brahmacariyaṃ caratī’’ti? Atha kho bhagavā tesaṃ dvādasanahutānaṃ māgadhikānaṃ brāhmaṇagahapatikānaṃ cetasā cetoparivitakkamaññāya āyasmantaṃ uruvelakassapaṃ gāthāya ajjhabhāsi –

Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, surrounded by twelve myriad Magadhan brahmins and householders, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Those twelve myriad Magadhan brahmins and householders also—some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side, some exchanged greetings with the Blessed One and, after an exchange of courteous and amiable words, sat down to one side, some extended their joined hands in reverential salutation toward the Blessed One and sat down to one side, some announced their name and lineage in the presence of the Blessed One and sat down to one side, while some remained silent and sat down to one side. Then it occurred to those twelve myriad Magadhan brahmins and householders: “Does the great ascetic follow the holy life under Uruvelā Kassapa, or does Uruvelā Kassapa follow the holy life under the great ascetic?” Then the Blessed One, having understood with his mind the thought in the minds of those twelve myriad Magadhan brahmins and householders, addressed the Venerable Uruvelā Kassapa in verse:

‘‘Kimeva disvā uruvelavāsi, pahāsi aggiṃ kisakovadāno;Pucchāmi taṃ kassapa, etamatthaṃ kathaṃ pahīnaṃ tava aggihuttanti.

“What did you see, dweller of Uruvela, that you abandoned the fire, you who taught the emaciated ascetics? I ask you, Kassapa, about this matter: how was your fire sacrifice abandoned?”

‘‘Rūpe ca sadde ca atho rase ca;Kāmitthiyo cābhivadanti yaññā;Etaṃ malanti upadhīsu ñatvā;Tasmā na yiṭṭhe na hute arañjinti.

“Forms and sounds, and also tastes, And desirable women that sacrifices declare To be defilements in the acquisitions: Therefore they delight neither in sacrifice nor offering.”

‘‘Ettheva te mano na ramittha (kassapāti bhagavā);Rūpesu saddesu atho rasesu;Atha ko carahi devamanussaloke;Rato mano kassapa, brūhi metanti.

“Surely your mind found no delight even in these (Kassapa,” said the Blessed One); In forms, in sounds, and also in tastes; Then in what, pray, in this world of gods and humans, Does the mind delight, Kassapa? Tell me this.”

‘‘Disvā padaṃ santamanūpadhīkaṃ;Akiñcanaṃ kāmabhave asattaṃ;Anaññathābhāvimanaññaneyyaṃ;Tasmā na yiṭṭhe na hute arañji’’nti.

“Having seen the peaceful state, free from clinging, Without possessions, unattached to sensual existence, Unchanging, not to be led by others, Therefore, I did not sacrifice, nor did I offer oblations.”

56. Atha kho āyasmā uruvelakassapo uṭṭhāyāsanā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā bhagavato pādesu sirasā nipatitvā bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘satthā me, bhante, bhagavā, sāvakohamasmi; satthā me, bhante, bhagavā, sāvakohamasmī’’ti. Atha kho tesaṃ dvādasanahutānaṃ māgadhikānaṃ brāhmaṇagahapatikānaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘uruvelakassapo mahāsamaṇe brahmacariyaṃ caratī’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā tesaṃ dvādasanahutānaṃ māgadhikānaṃ brāhmaṇagahapatikānaṃ cetasā cetoparivitakkamaññāya anupubbiṃ kathaṃ kathesi, seyyathidaṃ – dānakathaṃ sīlakathaṃ saggakathaṃ kāmānaṃ ādīnavaṃ okāraṃ saṃkilesaṃ nekkhamme ānisaṃsaṃ pakāsesi. Yadā te bhagavā aññāsi kallacitte muducitte vinīvaraṇacitte udaggacitte pasannacitte, atha yā buddhānaṃ sāmukkaṃsikā dhammadesanā, taṃ pakāsesi – dukkhaṃ, samudayaṃ, nirodhaṃ, maggaṃ. Seyyathāpi nāma suddhaṃ vatthaṃ apagatakāḷakaṃ sammadeva rajanaṃ paṭiggaṇheyya, evameva ekādasanahutānaṃ māgadhikānaṃ brāhmaṇagahapatikānaṃ bimbisārappamukhānaṃ tasmiṃ yeva āsane virajaṃ vītamalaṃ dhammacakkhuṃ udapādi – yaṃ kiñci samudayadhammaṃ, sabbaṃ taṃ nirodhadhammanti. Ekanahutaṃ upāsakattaṃ paṭivedesi.

56.Then the Venerable Uruvelā Kassapa rose from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, bowed his head at the Blessed One’s feet, and said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the Blessed One is my teacher, I am his disciple; venerable sir, the Blessed One is my teacher, I am his disciple.” Then those twelve myriad Magadhan brahmins and householders thought: “Uruvelā Kassapa lives the holy life under the great ascetic.” Then the Blessed One, knowing with his mind the thoughts in the minds of those twelve myriad Magadhan brahmins and householders, gave them a progressive talk—that is, talk on generosity, talk on virtue, talk on heaven, the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual pleasures, and the benefits of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that their minds were ready, pliable, free from hindrances, uplifted, and serene, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas—suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth free from stains would properly absorb dye, so too, right there on their seats, the dust-free, stainless vision of the Dhamma arose in those eleven myriad Magadhan brahmins and householders headed by Bimbisāra: “Whatever is subject to arising is all subject to cessation.” One myriad declared themselves lay followers.

57. Atha kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro diṭṭhadhammo pattadhammo viditadhammo pariyogāḷhadhammo tiṇṇavicikiccho vigatakathaṃkatho vesārajjappatto aparappaccayo satthusāsane bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘pubbe me, bhante, kumārassa sato pañca assāsakā ahesuṃ, te me etarahi samiddhā. Pubbe me, bhante, kumārassa sato etadahosi – ‘aho vata maṃ rajje abhisiñceyyu’nti, ayaṃ kho me, bhante, paṭhamo assāsako ahosi, so me etarahi samiddho. ‘Tassa ca me vijitaṃ arahaṃ sammāsambuddho okkameyyā’ti, ayaṃ kho me, bhante, dutiyo assāsako ahosi, so me etarahi samiddho. ‘Tañcāhaṃ bhagavantaṃ payirupāseyya’nti, ayaṃ kho me, bhante, tatiyo assāsako ahosi, so me etarahi samiddho. ‘So ca me bhagavā dhammaṃ deseyyā’ti, ayaṃ kho me, bhante, catuttho assāsako ahosi, so me etarahi samiddho. ‘Tassa cāhaṃ bhagavato dhammaṃ ājāneyya’nti, ayaṃ kho me, bhante, pañcamo assāsako ahosi, so me etarahi samiddho.

Esāhaṃ, bhante, bhagavantaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi, dhammañca, bhikkhusaṅghañca. Upāsakaṃ maṃ [maṃ bhante (ka.)], bhagavā dhāretu ajjatagge pāṇupetaṃ saraṇaṃ gataṃ, adhivāsetu ca me, bhante, bhagavā, svātanāya bhattaṃ saddhiṃ bhikkhusaṅghenā’’ti. Adhivāsesi bhagavā tuṇhībhāvena. Atha kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro bhagavato adhivāsanaṃ viditvā uṭṭhāyāsanā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṃ katvā pakkāmi. Atha kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro tassā rattiyā accayena paṇītaṃ khādanīyaṃ bhojanīyaṃ paṭiyādāpetvā bhagavato kālaṃ ārocāpesi – ‘‘kālo, bhante, niṭṭhitaṃ bhatta’’nti.

57.Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, who had seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, plunged into the Dhamma, crossed over doubt, got rid of perplexity, gained confidence, and become independent of others in the Teacher’s dispensation, addressed the Blessed One thus: “In the past, venerable sir, when I was a prince, I had five hopes, which have now been fulfilled. In the past, venerable sir, when I was a prince, I thought: ‘Oh, may they anoint me as king!’ This was my first hope, which has now been fulfilled. ‘And may an Arahant, a Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, come to my kingdom!’ This was my second hope, which has now been fulfilled. ‘And may I attend upon that Blessed One!’ This was my third hope, which has now been fulfilled. ‘And may that Blessed One teach me the Dhamma!’ This was my fourth hope, which has now been fulfilled. ‘And may I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One!’ This was my fifth hope, which has now been fulfilled. In the past, venerable sir, when I was a prince, I had these five hopes, which have now all been fulfilled. Excellent, venerable sir! Excellent, venerable sir! Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, reveal what was hidden, show the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes might see forms—so too has the Blessed One made the Dhamma clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for life. And may the Blessed One accept my invitation for tomorrow’s meal together with the Sangha of bhikkhus.” The Blessed One consented by silence. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, understanding the Blessed One’s consent, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed. Then, when the night had passed, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha had fine food prepared and announced the time to the Blessed One: “It is time, venerable sir, the meal is ready.”

58. Atha kho bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya rājagahaṃ pāvisi mahatā bhikkhusaṅghena saddhiṃ bhikkhusahassena sabbeheva purāṇajaṭilehi. Tena kho pana samayena sakko devānamindo māṇavakavaṇṇaṃ abhinimminitvā buddhappamukhassa bhikkhusaṅghassa purato purato gacchati imā gāthāyo gāyamāno –

58.Then the Blessed One, in the morning, having dressed, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus, with a thousand bhikkhus, all former matted-hair ascetics. At that time Sakka, the lord of the devas, having manifested the appearance of a young man, was walking in front of the Saṅgha of bhikkhus with the Buddha at its head, singing these verses:

‘‘Danto dantehi saha purāṇajaṭilehi, vippamutto vippamuttehi;Siṅgīnikkhasavaṇṇo, rājagahaṃ pāvisi bhagavā.

“Tamed among the tamed, with the former matted-hair ascetics, Freed among the freed; With the hue of refined gold, The Blessed One entered Rājagaha.

‘‘Mutto muttehi saha purāṇajaṭilehi, vippamutto vippamuttehi;Siṅgīnikkhasavaṇṇo, rājagahaṃ pāvisi bhagavā.

“Released among the released, with the former matted-hair ascetics, Freed among the freed; With the color of refined gold, The Blessed One entered Rājagaha.

‘‘Tiṇṇo tiṇṇehi saha purāṇajaṭilehi;Vippamutto vippamuttehi;Siṅgīnikkhasuvaṇṇo;Rājagahaṃ pāvisi bhagavā.

“Crossed over, together with the former matted-hair ascetics who have crossed; Liberated, together with those who are liberated; Of the hue of refined gold; The Blessed One entered Rājagaha.”

‘‘Santo santehi saha purāṇajaṭilehi;Vippamutto vippamuttehi;Siṅgīnikkhasavaṇṇo;Rājagahaṃ pāvisi bhagavā.

“Serene, together with the former matted-hair ascetics who are serene; Liberated, together with those who are liberated; Of the hue of refined gold; The Blessed One entered Rājagaha.”

‘‘Dasavāso dasabalo, dasadhammavidū dasabhi cupeto;So dasasataparivāro [parivārako (ka.)] rājagahaṃ, pāvisi bhagavā’’ti.

“Having dwelt in the ten noble dwellings, possessing the ten powers, knowing the ten courses of action, endowed with the ten qualities of one beyond training; Accompanied by a thousand, the Blessed One entered Rājagaha.”

Manussā sakkaṃ devānamindaṃ passitvā evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘abhirūpo vatāyaṃ māṇavako, dassanīyo vatāyaṃ māṇavako, pāsādiko vatāyaṃ māṇavako. Kassa nu kho ayaṃ māṇavako’’ti? Evaṃ vutte sakko devānamindo te manusse gāthāya ajjhabhāsi –

Seeing Sakka, the lord of the devas, the people said: “Indeed, how handsome this young man is! Indeed, how attractive this young man is! Indeed, how splendid this young man is! To whom does this young man belong?” When this was said, Sakka, the lord of the devas, addressed those people with a verse:

‘‘Yo dhīro sabbadhi danto, suddho appaṭipuggalo;Arahaṃ sugato loke, tassāhaṃ paricārako’’ti.

“The wise one, tamed in every way, pure, without equal; The Arahant, the Sugata in the world—I am his attendant.”

59. Atha kho bhagavā yena rañño māgadhassa seniyassa bimbisārassa nivesanaṃ tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi saddhiṃ bhikkhusaṅghena. Atha kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro buddhappamukhaṃ bhikkhusaṅghaṃ paṇītena khādanīyena bhojanīyena sahatthā santappetvā sampavāretvā bhagavantaṃ bhuttāviṃ onītapattapāṇiṃ ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnassa kho rañño māgadhassa seniyassa bimbisārassa etadahosi [cūḷava. 307] – ‘‘kattha nu kho bhagavā vihareyya? Yaṃ assa gāmato neva avidūre na accāsanne, gamanāgamanasampannaṃ, atthikānaṃ atthikānaṃ manussānaṃ abhikkamanīyaṃ, divā appākiṇṇaṃ [appakiṇṇaṃ (sī. syā.), abbhokiṇṇaṃ (ka.)], rattiṃ appasaddaṃ appanigghosaṃ vijanavātaṃ, manussarāhasseyyakaṃ, paṭisallānasāruppa’’nti. Atha kho rañño māgadhassa seniyassa bimbisārassa etadahosi – ‘‘idaṃ kho amhākaṃ veḷuvanaṃ uyyānaṃ gāmato neva avidūre na accāsanne gamanāgamanasampannaṃ atthikānaṃ atthikānaṃ manussānaṃ abhikkamanīyaṃ divā appākiṇṇaṃ rattiṃ appasaddaṃ appanigghosaṃ vijanavātaṃ manussarāhasseyyakaṃ paṭisallānasāruppaṃ. Yaṃnūnāhaṃ veḷuvanaṃ uyyānaṃ buddhappamukhassa bhikkhusaṅghassa dadeyya’’nti. Atha kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro sovaṇṇamayaṃ bhiṅkāraṃ gahetvā bhagavato oṇojesi – ‘‘etāhaṃ, bhante, veḷuvanaṃ uyyānaṃ buddhappamukhassa bhikkhusaṅghassa dammī’’ti. Paṭiggahesi bhagavā ārāmaṃ. Atha kho bhagavā rājānaṃ māgadhaṃ seniyaṃ bimbisāraṃ dhammiyā kathāya sandassetvā samādapetvā samuttejetvā sampahaṃsetvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkāmi. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, ārāma’’nti.

59.Then the Blessed One went to the residence of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha. Having approached, he sat down on the prepared seat together with the community of monks. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha personally served and satisfied the community of monks headed by the Buddha with choice hard and soft food. When the Blessed One had finished eating and had put away his bowl, the king sat down to one side. As he sat there, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha thought: “Where should the Blessed One dwell? It should be neither too far from nor too close to a village, suitable for coming and going, accessible to people who seek him, not crowded by day, quiet by night, with little noise and clamor, free from human traffic, a place for people to be alone, suitable for retreat.” Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha thought: “This Bamboo Grove of mine is neither too far from nor too close to the village, suitable for coming and going, accessible to people who seek him, not crowded by day, quiet by night, with little noise and clamor, free from human traffic, a place for people to be alone, suitable for retreat. Why don’t I give the Bamboo Grove to the community of monks headed by the Buddha?” Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha took a golden vessel and poured water over the Blessed One’s hands, saying: “Venerable sir, I give this Bamboo Grove to the community of monks headed by the Buddha.” The Blessed One accepted the monastery. Then the Blessed One, having instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha with a Dhamma talk, rose from his seat and departed. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow monasteries.”

Bimbisārasamāgamakathā niṭṭhitā.

The discourse on Bimbisāra’s Assembly is concluded.

60.At that time, the wanderer Sañcaya was residing in Rājagaha with a large assembly of wanderers, with two hundred and fifty wanderers. At that time, Sāriputta and Moggallāna were practicing the holy life under the wanderer Sañcaya. They had made an agreement: whoever first attains the Deathless should inform the other. Then, in the morning, Venerable Assaji dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Rājagaha for alms. His demeanor was graceful—moving forward and back, looking ahead and around, bending and stretching, with downcast eyes and composed in every action. The wanderer Sāriputta saw Venerable Assaji going for alms in Rājagaha, his demeanor graceful in every way. Seeing him, he thought: “Surely, this monk is one of those in the world who are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship. Why don’t I approach him and ask: ‘Under whom, friend, have you gone forth? Who is your teacher? Whose Dhamma do you profess?’” Then the wanderer Sāriputta thought: “This is not the right time to question this monk, as he has entered a house for alms. Why don’t I follow him closely behind, a path recognized by those who seek.” After Venerable Assaji had walked for alms in Rājagaha and was returning with his almsfood, the wanderer Sāriputta approached him. Having approached, he exchanged greetings with Venerable Assaji, and after courteous and meaningful conversation, he stood to one side. Standing there, the wanderer Sāriputta said to Venerable Assaji: “Your faculties, friend, are serene; your complexion is pure and bright. Under whom have you gone forth? Who is your teacher? Whose Dhamma do you profess?” “There is, friend, a great ascetic, a son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan. I have gone forth under that Blessed One; he is my teacher, and I profess his Dhamma.” “But what does your teacher say, what does he proclaim?” “I am new, friend, recently gone forth, and have just come to this Dhamma and Discipline. I cannot explain the Dhamma in detail, but I can tell you the meaning briefly.” Then the wanderer Sāriputta said to Venerable Assaji: “So be it, friend—

‘‘Appaṃ vā bahuṃ vā bhāsassu, atthaṃyeva me brūhi;Attheneva me attho, kiṃ kāhasi byañjanaṃ bahu’’nti.

“Speak little or much, but tell me the meaning; For the meaning is what I need, what use is a mass of words?”

Atha kho āyasmā assaji sāriputtassa paribbājakassa imaṃ dhammapariyāyaṃ abhāsi –

Then Venerable Assaji recited this Dhamma exposition to the wanderer Sāriputta:

[apa. 1.1.286 therāpadānepi] ‘‘Ye dhammā hetuppabhavā, tesaṃ hetuṃ tathāgato āha;Tesañca yo nirodho, evaṃvādī mahāsamaṇo’’ti.

“Of those phenomena that arise from a cause, the Tathagata has told the cause, and also their cessation; thus teaches the Great Ascetic.”

Atha kho sāriputtassa paribbājakassa imaṃ dhammapariyāyaṃ sutvā virajaṃ vītamalaṃ dhammacakkhuṃ udapādi – ‘‘yaṃ kiñci samudayadhammaṃ, sabbaṃ taṃ nirodhadhamma’’nti.

Then, upon hearing this Dhamma exposition, the wanderer Sāriputta obtained the dust-free, stainless Dhamma-eye: “Whatever is subject to arising is all subject to cessation.”

[apa. 1.1.289 therāpadānepi] Eseva dhammo yadi tāvadeva, paccabyattha padamasokaṃ;Adiṭṭhaṃ abbhatītaṃ, bahukehi kappanahutehīti.

“Even if this is all the Dhamma, you have penetrated the sorrowless state; Unseen and passed beyond by us for many hundreds of thousands of aeons.”

Atha khvāhaṃ, āvuso, assajiṃ bhikkhuṃ etadavocaṃ – ‘‘hotu, āvuso,

61.Then the wanderer Moggallāna said to the wanderer Sāriputta: “Come, friend, let us go to the Blessed One; the Blessed One is our teacher.” “But friend, these two hundred and fifty wanderers dwell here relying on us, looking up to us. Let us first take leave of them. They will act as they think fit.” Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached those wanderers and said: “We are going, friends, to the Blessed One; the Blessed One is our teacher.” “We dwell here, venerable sirs, relying on you, looking up to you. If the venerable ones lead the holy life under the great ascetic, we will all lead the holy life under the great ascetic.” Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached the wanderer Sañjaya and said: “We are going, friend, to the Blessed One; the Blessed One is our teacher.” “Enough, friends, do not go. We three can manage this group together.” A second time… A third time Sāriputta and Moggallāna said to the wanderer Sañjaya: “We are going, friend, to the Blessed One; the Blessed One is our teacher.” “Enough, friends, do not go. We three can manage this group together.” Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna took those two hundred and fifty wanderers and went to the Bamboo Grove. But hot blood gushed from the mouth of the wanderer Sañjaya right there.

Appaṃ vā bahuṃ vā bhāsassu, atthaṃyeva me brūhi;Attheneva me attho, kiṃ kāhasi byañjanaṃ bahu’’nti.

“Speak little or much, but tell me the meaning; For the meaning is what I need, what use is a mass of words?”

Atha kho, āvuso, assaji bhikkhu imaṃ dhammapariyāyaṃ abhāsi –

Then, friend, the monk Assaji recited this Dhamma exposition:

‘‘Ye dhammā hetuppabhavā, tesaṃ hetuṃ tathāgato āha;Tesañca yo nirodho, evaṃvādī mahāsamaṇo’’ti.

“Of those phenomena that arise from a cause, the Tathagata has told the cause, and also their cessation; thus teaches the Great Ascetic.”

Atha kho moggallānassa paribbājakassa imaṃ dhammapariyāyaṃ sutvā virajaṃ vītamalaṃ dhammacakkhuṃ udapādi – yaṃ kiñci samudayadhammaṃ, sabbaṃ taṃ nirodhadhammanti.

Then, upon hearing this Dhamma exposition, the wanderer Moggallāna obtained the dust-free, stainless Dhamma-eye: “Whatever is subject to arising is all subject to cessation.”

Eseva dhammo yadi tāvadeva, paccabyattha padamasokaṃ;Adiṭṭhaṃ abbhatītaṃ, bahukehi kappanahutehīti.

“Even if this is all the Dhamma, you have penetrated the sorrowless state; Unseen and passed beyond by us for many hundreds of thousands of aeons.”

62. Atha kho moggallāno paribbājako sāriputtaṃ paribbājakaṃ etadavoca ‘‘gacchāma mayaṃ, āvuso, bhagavato santike, so no bhagavā satthā’’ti. ‘‘Imāni kho, āvuso, aḍḍhateyyāni paribbājakasatāni amhe nissāya amhe sampassantā idha viharanti, tepi tāva apalokema [apalokāma (ka)].

62.Then the wanderer Moggallāna said to the wanderer Sāriputta: “Come, friend, let us go to the Blessed One; the Blessed One is our teacher.” “But friend, these two hundred and fifty wanderers dwell here relying on us, looking up to us. Let us first take leave of them. They will act as they think fit.” Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached those wanderers and said: “We are going, friends, to the Blessed One; the Blessed One is our teacher.” “We dwell here, venerable sirs, relying on you, looking up to you. If the venerable ones lead the holy life under the great ascetic, we will all lead the holy life under the great ascetic.” Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached the wanderer Sañjaya and said: “We are going, friend, to the Blessed One; the Blessed One is our teacher.” “Enough, friends, do not go. We three can manage this group together.” A second time… A third time Sāriputta and Moggallāna said to the wanderer Sañjaya: “We are going, friend, to the Blessed One; the Blessed One is our teacher.” “Enough, friends, do not go. We three can manage this group together.” Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna took those two hundred and fifty wanderers and went to the Bamboo Grove. But hot blood gushed from the mouth of the wanderer Sañjaya right there.

Addasā kho bhagavā [bhagavāte (ka)] sāriputtamoggallāne dūratova āgacchante, disvāna bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘ete, bhikkhave, dve sahāyakā āgacchanti, kolito upatisso ca. Etaṃ me sāvakayugaṃ bhavissati aggaṃ bhaddayuga’’nti.

The Blessed One saw Sāriputta and Moggallāna coming from afar. Seeing them, he addressed the monks: “These two companions are coming, monks—Kolita and Upatissa. This will be my pair of disciples, the foremost, the excellent pair.”

Gambhīre ñāṇavisaye, anuttare upadhisaṅkhaye;Vimutte appatte veḷuvanaṃ, atha ne satthā byākāsi.

In the profound realm of wisdom, in the unexcelled cessation of substrata, the Liberated One; While they had not yet reached the Bamboo Grove, then the Teacher declared:

Ete dve sahāyakā, āgacchanti kolito upatisso ca;Etaṃ me sāvakayugaṃ, bhavissati aggaṃ bhaddayuganti.

“These two companions, Kolita and Upatissa, are coming; This pair of disciples will be the foremost, the excellent pair.”

Atha kho sāriputtamoggallānā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā

Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached the Blessed One; having approached,

Bhagavato pādesu sirasā nipatitvā bhagavantaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘labheyyāma mayaṃ, bhante, bhagavato santike pabbajjaṃ, labheyyāma upasampada’’nti. ‘‘Etha bhikkhavo’’ti bhagavā avoca – ‘‘svākkhāto dhammo, caratha brahmacariyaṃ sammā dukkhassa antakiriyāyā’’ti. Sāva tesaṃ āyasmantānaṃ upasampadā ahosi.

Having bowed their heads at the feet of the Blessed One, they said to him: "Venerable sir, may we receive the going forth in the Blessed One's presence, may we receive the higher ordination?" "Come, monks," the Blessed One said, "the Dhamma is well proclaimed. Live the holy life for the complete ending of suffering." That itself was the higher ordination for those venerable ones.

Abhiññātānaṃ pabbajjā

The ordination of the well-known ones.

63. Tena kho pana samayena abhiññātā abhiññātā māgadhikā kulaputtā bhagavati brahmacariyaṃ caranti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – aputtakatāya paṭipanno samaṇo gotamo, vedhabyāya paṭipanno samaṇo gotamo, kulupacchedāya paṭipanno samaṇo gotamo, idāni anena jaṭilasahassaṃ pabbājitaṃ, imāni ca aḍḍhateyyāni paribbājakasatāni sañcayāni [sañjeyyāni (sī.), sañjayāni (syā.)] pabbājitāni. Ime ca abhiññātā abhiññātā māgadhikā kulaputtā samaṇe gotame brahmacariyaṃ carantīti. Apissu bhikkhū disvā imāya gāthāya codenti –

63.Now at that time, well-known young men from Magadha were leading the spiritual life under the Blessed One. People complained, criticized, and grumbled: "The ascetic Gotama is committed to childlessness, to widowhood, to family destruction. Now by him a thousand ascetics with matted hair have been ordained, and these two hundred and fifty wanderers who were Sañcaya's followers have been ordained. And these well-known young men from Magadha are leading the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama." And also, monks, having seen them, rebuked them with this verse:

‘‘Āgato kho mahāsamaṇo, māgadhānaṃ giribbajaṃ;Sabbe sañcaye netvāna [sañjeyyake netvā (sī.)], kaṃsu dāni nayissatī’’ti.

"The great ascetic has come to Giribbaja of the Magadhans; Having led away all Sañcaya's followers, whom will he lead away now?"

Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū tesaṃ manussānaṃ ujjhāyantānaṃ khiyyantānaṃ vipācentānaṃ. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… na, bhikkhave, so saddo ciraṃ bhavissati, sattāhameva bhavissati, sattāhassa accayena antaradhāyissati. Tena hi, bhikkhave, ye tumhe imāya gāthāya codenti –

The monks heard those people complaining, grumbling, and criticizing. Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One… "No, monks, that sound will not last long; it will last only seven days, and after seven days it will disappear. Therefore, monks, if they rebuke you with this verse:—

‘‘Āgato kho mahāsamaṇo, māgadhānaṃ giribbajaṃ;Sabbe sañcaye netvāna, kaṃsu dāni nayissatī’’ti.

"The great ascetic has come to Giribbaja of the Magadhans; Having led away all Sañcaya's followers, whom will he lead away now?"

Te tumhe imāya gāthāya paṭicodetha –

You should challenge them with this verse.

‘‘Nayanti ve mahāvīrā, saddhammena tathāgatā;Dhammena nayamānānaṃ [nīyamānānaṃ (ka.)], kā usūyā [ussuyā (ka.)] vijānata’’nti.

"The great heroes, the Tathāgatas, indeed lead by the true Dhamma; For the discerning, what envy can there be of those leading by the Dhamma?"

Tena kho pana samayena manussā bhikkhū disvā imāya gāthāya codenti –

At that time, people, having seen the monks, reproached them with this verse:

‘‘Āgato kho mahāsamaṇo, māgadhānaṃ giribbajaṃ;Sabbe sañcaye netvāna, kaṃsu dāni nayissatī’’ti.

"The great ascetic has come to Giribbaja of the Magadhans; Having led away all Sañcaya's followers, whom will he lead away now?"

Bhikkhū te manusse imāya gāthāya paṭicodenti –

The monks retort to those people with this verse:

‘‘Nayanti ve mahāvīrā, saddhammena tathāgatā;Dhammena nayamānānaṃ, kā usūyā vijānata’’nti.

"The great heroes, the Tathāgatas, indeed lead by the true Dhamma; For those leading by the Dhamma, what envy can the discerning have?"

Manussā dhammena kira samaṇā sakyaputtiyā nenti no adhammenāti sattāhameva so saddo ahosi, sattāhassa accayena antaradhāyi.

People say that the Sakyan ascetics guide [others] with Dhamma, not with non-Dhamma. That sound lasted for seven days; after seven days, it disappeared.

Sāriputtamoggallānapabbajjākathā niṭṭhitā.

The account of Sāriputta and Moggallāna's ordination is concluded.

Catutthabhāṇavāro niṭṭhito.

The fourth recitation division is completed.

15.Account of Duties to the Preceptor

64. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū anupajjhāyakā anācariyakā [idaṃ padaṃ sī. syā. potthakesu natthi] anovadiyamānā ananusāsiyamānā dunnivatthā duppārutā anākappasampannā piṇḍāya caranti; manussānaṃ [te manussānaṃ (ka.)] bhuñjamānānaṃ uparibhojanepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmenti, uparikhādanīyepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmenti, uparisāyanīyepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmenti, uparipānīyepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmenti; sāmaṃ sūpampi odanampi viññāpetvā bhuñjanti; bhattaggepi uccāsaddā mahāsaddā viharanti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma samaṇā sakyaputtiyā dunnivatthā duppārutā anākappasampannā piṇḍāya carissanti; manussānaṃ bhuñjamānānaṃ, uparibhojanepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmessanti, uparikhādanīyepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmessanti, uparisāyanīyepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmessanti, uparipānīyepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmessanti; sāmaṃ sūpampi odanampi viññāpetvā bhuñjissanti; bhattaggepi uccāsaddā mahāsaddā viharissanti seyyathāpi brāhmaṇā brāhmaṇabhojane’’ti.

64.Now at that time monks without preceptors, without teachers, not being admonished or instructed, wandered for alms poorly dressed, improperly clad, lacking in proper conduct. While people were eating, they would hold out a bowl for food from which one has risen, for edibles from which one has risen, for delicacies from which one has risen, for drinks from which one has risen. They would ask for soup and rice and eat it. In the dining hall, they lived making loud and great noises. People complained, criticized, and grumbled: "How can these Sakyan ascetics wander for alms poorly dressed, improperly clad, lacking in proper conduct? While people are eating, they hold out a bowl for food from which one has risen, for edibles from which one has risen, for delicacies from which one has risen, for drinks from which one has risen. They ask for soup and rice and eat it. In the dining hall, they live making loud and great noises, just like brahmins at a brahmin feast!"

Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū tesaṃ manussānaṃ ujjhāyantānaṃ khiyyantānaṃ vipācentānaṃ. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā santuṭṭhā lajjino kukkuccakā sikkhākāmā, te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma bhikkhū dunnivatthā duppārutā anākappasampannā piṇḍāya carissanti; manussānaṃ bhuñjamānānaṃ, uparibhojanepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmessanti, uparikhādanīyepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmessanti, uparisāyanīyepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmessanti, uparipānīyepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmessanti; sāmaṃ sūpampi odanampi viññāpetvā bhuñjissanti; bhattaggepi uccāsaddā mahāsaddā viharissantī’’ti. Atha kho te bhikkhū…pe… bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

The monks heard those people complaining, grumbling, and criticizing. Those monks who were modest, content, conscientious, scrupulous, and desirous of training complained, grumbled, and criticized, "How can monks go for alms poorly dressed, improperly covered, and lacking decorum? While people are eating, they hold out a bowl for food from which one has risen, for edibles from which one has risen, for delicacies from which one has risen, and for drinks from which one has risen. They even ask for soup and rice for themselves and then eat. And in the refectory, they live making loud noises and great noises." Then those monks… reported this matter to the Blessed One.

Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā bhikkhū paṭipucchi – ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, bhikkhū dunnivatthā duppārutā anākappasampannā piṇḍāya caranti, manussānaṃ bhuñjamānānaṃ upari bhojanepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmenti, uparikhādanīyepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmenti, uparisāyanīyepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmenti, uparipānīyepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmenti, sāmaṃ sūpampi odanampi viññāpetvā bhuñjanti, bhattaggepi uccāsaddā mahāsaddā viharantī’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā – ‘‘ananucchavikaṃ, bhikkhave, tesaṃ moghapurisānaṃ ananulomikaṃ appatirūpaṃ assāmaṇakaṃ akappiyaṃ akaraṇīyaṃ. Kathañhi nāma te, bhikkhave, moghapurisā dunnivatthā duppārutā anākappasampannā piṇḍāya carissanti, manussānaṃ bhuñjamānānaṃ uparibhojanepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmessanti, uparikhādanīyepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmessanti, uparisāyanīyepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmessanti, uparipānīyepi uttiṭṭhapattaṃ upanāmessanti, sāmaṃ sūpampi odanampi viññāpetvā bhuñjissanti, bhattaggepi uccāsaddā mahāsaddā viharissanti. Netaṃ, bhikkhave, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya, pasannānaṃ vā bhiyyobhāvāya. Atha khvetaṃ, bhikkhave, appasannānañceva appasādāya, pasannānañca ekaccānaṃ aññathattāyā’’ti.

Then the Blessed One, regarding this incident, on this occasion, convened the Sangha of monks, questioned the monks: "Is it true, monks, that monks, poorly dressed, improperly clad, without proper deportment, go for alms, and while people are eating, hold out a bowl for food from which one has risen, for edibles from which one has risen, for delicacies from which one has risen, for drinks from which one has risen; that they themselves ask for and eat both soup and rice; and that they live with loud and excessive noise in the refectory?" "It is true, Blessed One." The Blessed One rebuked them: "It is unseemly, monks, unsuitable for these foolish men, inappropriate, unworthy of ascetics, unlawful, not to be done. How could these foolish men, monks, poorly dressed, improperly clad, without proper deportment, go for alms, and while people are eating, hold out a bowl for food from which one has risen, for edibles from which one has risen, for delicacies from which one has risen, for drinks from which one has risen; that they themselves ask for and eat both soup and rice; and that they live with loud and excessive noise in the refectory? This, monks, will not lead to confidence in the unconvinced, nor to increase in the convinced. Rather, monks, it will lead to lack of confidence in the unconvinced and to the changing of mind in some of the convinced." Then the Blessed One, having rebuked those monks in many ways, having spoken in dispraise of being difficult to support, difficult to nourish, very ambitious, discontented, fond of society, and indolent, having praised in many ways being easy to support, easy to nourish, having few wishes, being content, austere, refined, inspiring confidence, modest, energetic, gave a Dhamma talk appropriate and suitable for the monks, and then addressed them:

65. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, upajjhāyaṃ. Upajjhāyo, bhikkhave, saddhivihārikamhi puttacittaṃ upaṭṭhapessati, saddhivihāriko upajjhāyamhi pitucittaṃ upaṭṭhapessati. Evaṃ te aññamaññaṃ sagāravā sappatissā sabhāgavuttino viharantā imasmiṃ dhammavinaye vuḍḍhiṃ viruḷhiṃ vepullaṃ āpajjissanti. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, upajjhāyo gahetabbo – ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā pāde vanditvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā evamassa vacanīyo – ‘upajjhāyo me, bhante, hohi; upajjhāyo me, bhante, hohi; upajjhāyo me, bhante, hohī’ti. Sāhūti vā lahūti vā opāyikanti vā patirūpanti vā pāsādikena sampādehīti vā kāyena viññāpeti, vācāya viññāpeti, kāyena vācāya [na vācāya (ka.)] viññāpeti, gahito hoti upajjhāyo; na kāyena viññāpeti, na vācāya viññāpeti, na kāyena vācāya viññāpeti, na gahito hoti upajjhāyo.

65."I allow, monks, a preceptor. The preceptor, monks, should establish a parental attitude toward the student, and the student should establish a filial attitude toward the preceptor. Thus, living with mutual respect, deference, and shared good conduct, they will attain growth, development, and abundance in this Dhamma and Discipline. And, monks, the preceptor should be accepted in this way: Having arranged the upper robe over one shoulder, bowing at the feet, sitting in a squatting position, raising joined palms, one should say: 'Venerable sir, be my preceptor; venerable sir, be my preceptor; venerable sir, be my preceptor.' If he indicates acceptance by body, speech, or both—whether by saying 'Good,' 'Very well,' 'It is possible,' 'Suitable,' or 'Accomplish it with confidence'—then the preceptor is accepted. If he does not indicate acceptance by body, speech, or both, then the preceptor is not accepted."

66. [cūḷava. 376 ādayo]‘‘Saddhivihārikena, bhikkhave, upajjhāyamhi sammā vattitabbaṃ. Tatrāyaṃ sammāvattanā –

66."Monks, a student should behave properly towards his preceptor. This is the proper conduct:

‘‘Kālasseva vuṭṭhāya upāhanā omuñcitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā dantakaṭṭhaṃ dātabbaṃ, mukhodakaṃ dātabbaṃ, āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ. Sace yāgu hoti, bhājanaṃ dhovitvā yāgu upanāmetabbā. Yāguṃ pītassa udakaṃ datvā bhājanaṃ paṭiggahetvā nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena dhovitvā paṭisāmetabbaṃ. Upajjhāyamhi vuṭṭhite āsanaṃ uddharitabbaṃ. Sace so deso uklāpo hoti, so deso sammajjitabbo.

"Rising early in the morning, one should remove the sandals, arrange the upper robe over one shoulder, and offer a tooth-stick and water for washing the mouth. A seat should be arranged. If there is rice-gruel, the bowl should be washed and the rice-gruel offered. After the rice-gruel has been drunk, water should be given, the bowl received, lowered, and carefully washed without knocking it about, then put away. When the preceptor rises, the seat should be removed. If that place is untidy, that place should be swept."

‘‘Sace upajjhāyo gāmaṃ pavisitukāmo hoti, nivāsanaṃ dātabbaṃ, paṭinivāsanaṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ, kāyabandhanaṃ dātabbaṃ, saguṇaṃ katvā saṅghāṭiyo dātabbā, dhovitvā patto sodako [saudako (ka.)] dātabbo.

If the preceptor wishes to enter the village, the lower robe should be given, the outer robe received, the belt offered, and the outer robes should be made into one and given. The bowl should be washed and filled with water, and given. If the preceptor desires an attendant, covering the three circles (of the body), one should wear the lower robe evenly, fasten the belt, make the outer robes into one and put them on, untie the knot, take the washed bowl, and attend the preceptor as his follower. One should not walk too far behind, nor too close. The bowl should be received as required. One should not interrupt the preceptor while he is speaking. If the preceptor speaks within the vicinity of an offense, he should be restrained.

‘‘Nivattantena paṭhamataraṃ āgantvā āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipitabbaṃ, paccuggantvā pattacīvaraṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ, paṭinivāsanaṃ dātabbaṃ, nivāsanaṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ.

Obhoge kāyabandhanaṃ kātabbaṃ.

Upon returning, one should arrive first and prepare a seat. Foot-water, a footstool, and a foot-wiper should be set out. Going to meet him, the bowl and robe should be received, the outer robe given, and the lower robe received. If the robe is damp, it should be briefly warmed in the sun, but the robe should not be left in the sun. The robe should be folded; when folding, the corner should be raised four finger-widths to prevent a crease in the middle. The belt should be arranged in the hem.

‘‘Sace piṇḍapāto hoti, upajjhāyo ca bhuñjitukāmo hoti, udakaṃ datvā piṇḍapāto upanāmetabbo. Upajjhāyo pānīyena pucchitabbo. Bhuttāvissa udakaṃ datvā pattaṃ paṭiggahetvā nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena dhovitvā vodakaṃ katvā muhuttaṃ uṇhe otāpetabbo, na ca uṇhe patto nidahitabbo. Pattacīvaraṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ.

If there is almsfood and the preceptor wishes to eat, water should be given and the almsfood presented to him. The preceptor should be asked if he needs drinking water. After he has eaten, water should be given, the bowl received, lowered, washed well without scraping, made waterless, and briefly exposed to the sun—but the bowl should not be left in the sun. The bowl and robe should be put away. When placing the bowl, one should hold the bowl with one hand and touch the lower cot or lower seat with the other hand before setting the bowl down. The bowl should not be placed directly on the bare ground. When putting away the robe, one should hold the robe with one hand, wipe the robe-rack or robe-cord with the other, fold the edge inward from the outer end, and put the robe away. When the preceptor rises, the seat should be removed, and the foot-water, footstool, and foot-wiper returned to their place. If the place is untidy, it should be swept.

‘‘Sace upajjhāyo nahāyitukāmo hoti, nahānaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ. Sace sītena attho hoti, sītaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ. Sace uṇhena attho hoti, uṇhaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ.

If the preceptor wishes to bathe, bathing arrangements should be made. If he needs cold water, cold water should be prepared; if he needs warm water, warm water should be prepared.

‘‘Sace upajjhāyo jantāgharaṃ pavisitukāmo hoti, cuṇṇaṃ sannetabbaṃ, mattikā temetabbā, jantāgharapīṭhaṃ ādāya upajjhāyassa piṭṭhito piṭṭhito gantvā jantāgharapīṭhaṃ datvā cīvaraṃ paṭiggahetvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ, cuṇṇaṃ dātabbaṃ, mattikā dātabbā.

If the preceptor wishes to enter the hot room, powder should be prepared, clay should be soaked, and, taking the hot room stool, one should follow behind the preceptor. After giving the hot room stool, the robe should be received and set aside. Powder should be given, clay should be given. If one is capable, one should enter the hot room. When entering the hot room, one should smear the face with clay, cover oneself in front and behind, and then enter the hot room. One should not sit crowding the senior monks. Junior monks should not be pushed away from their seats. In the hot room, one should attend to the preceptor’s needs. When leaving the hot room, one should take the hot room stool, cover oneself in front and behind, and then exit the hot room.

‘‘Udakepi upajjhāyassa parikammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Nahātena paṭhamataraṃ uttaritvā attano gattaṃ vodakaṃ katvā nivāsetvā upajjhāyassa gattato udakaṃ pamajjitabbaṃ, nivāsanaṃ dātabbaṃ, saṅghāṭi dātabbā, jantāgharapīṭhaṃ ādāya paṭhamataraṃ āgantvā āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipitabbaṃ, upajjhāyo pānīyena pucchitabbo. Sace uddisāpetukāmo hoti, uddisitabbo. Sace paripucchitukāmo hoti, paripucchitabbo.

One should also attend to the preceptor’s needs regarding water. After bathing, one should emerge first, dry one's body, put on the lower robe, and then wipe the water from the preceptor’s body. The lower robe should be given, the outer robe should be given. Taking the hot-bath stool, one should return first, prepare the seat, set out foot-washing water, a footstool, and a foot-wiping cloth. The preceptor should be asked if he desires drinking water. If he wishes to be taught, he should be taught. If he wishes to question, he should be questioned.

‘‘Yasmiṃ vihāre upajjhāyo viharati, sace so vihāro uklāpo hoti, sace ussahati, sodhetabbo. Vihāraṃ sodhentena paṭhamaṃ pattacīvaraṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ.

“In whichever dwelling the preceptor resides, if that dwelling is untidy, and if one is capable, it should be cleaned. When cleaning the dwelling, one should first remove the bowl and robe and set them aside. One should remove the sitting cloth and set it aside. One should remove the mattress and pillow and set them aside. Lowering the bed carefully, without scraping or bumping it against the doorposts, one should remove it and set it aside. Lowering the stool carefully, without scraping or bumping it against the doorposts, one should remove it and set it aside. One should remove the bed legs and set them aside. One should remove the spittoon and set it aside. One should remove the backrest and set it aside. Examining the floor covering as laid out, one should remove it and set it aside. If the dwelling has cobwebs, one should first take them down from above, and wipe the window sills and corners. If the walls, treated with red ochre, have become stained, one should moisten a cloth, wring it out, and wipe them. If the floor, treated with black coloring, has become stained, one should moisten a cloth, wring it out, and wipe it. If the floor is untreated, one should sprinkle it with water and sweep it—lest the dwelling be soiled with dust. One should gather the rubbish and discard it to one side.”

Having aired the floor covering, one should clean it, shake it out, bring it in, and arrange it as prescribed. One should wipe the bed legs, bring them in, and set them in their proper places. Having cleaned the bed and shaken it out, one should lower it carefully, without scraping or bumping it against the doorposts, bring it in, and arrange it as prescribed.

If dissatisfaction arises in the preceptor, the pupil should remove it, have it removed, or give him a Dhamma talk. If remorse arises in the preceptor, the pupil should dispel it, have it dispelled, or give him a Dhamma talk. If a wrong view arises in the preceptor, the pupil should correct it, have it corrected, or give him a Dhamma talk. If the preceptor has committed a grave offense deserving probation, the pupil should make an effort: “How might the Saṅgha grant probation to the preceptor?” If the preceptor deserves to be sent back to the beginning, the pupil should make an effort: “How might the Saṅgha send the preceptor back to the beginning?” If the preceptor deserves a penalty, the pupil should make an effort: “How might the Saṅgha impose a penalty on the preceptor?” If the preceptor deserves reinstatement, the pupil should make an effort: “How might the Saṅgha reinstate the preceptor?” If the Saṅgha desires to take a formal act against the preceptor—whether censure, suspension, probation, reconciliation, or expulsion—the pupil should make an effort: “How might the Saṅgha not take a formal act against the preceptor, or change it to a lighter penalty?” If the Saṅgha has already taken a formal act—whether censure, suspension, probation, reconciliation, or expulsion—the pupil should make an effort: “How might the preceptor behave properly, humble himself, mend his ways, so that the Saṅgha may revoke that formal act?”

If the preceptor’s robe needs washing, the student should wash it or make an effort, thinking: 'How can the preceptor’s robe be washed?' If the preceptor’s robe needs making, the student should make it or make an effort, thinking: 'How can the preceptor’s robe be made?' If dye needs to be cooked for the preceptor, the student should cook it or make an effort, thinking: 'How can dye be cooked for the preceptor?' If the preceptor’s robe needs dyeing, the student should dye it or make an effort, thinking: 'How can the preceptor’s robe be dyed?' When dyeing the robe, one should dye it well, turning it over and over, and not leave before the process is complete.

Without asking the preceptor, a bowl should not be given to a particular person, nor should a bowl be received from a particular person; a robe should not be given to a particular person, nor should a robe be received from a particular person; requisites should not be given to a particular person, nor should requisites be received from a particular person; hair should not be cut for a particular person, nor should hair be caused to be cut by a particular person; personal services should not be performed for a particular person, nor should personal services be caused to be performed by a particular person; assistance should not be rendered to a particular person, nor should assistance be caused to be rendered by a particular person; one should not be an attendant for a particular person, nor should a particular person be taken as an attendant; alms-food should not be taken out for a particular person, nor should alms-food be caused to be taken out by a particular person; without asking the preceptor, one should not enter a village; one should not go to a charnel ground; one should not depart to another direction. If the preceptor is sick, he should be attended to for life; his recovery should be awaited.

Upajjhāyavattaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ.

The chapter on duties toward the preceptor is concluded.

16.The Discourse on the Duties of a Pupil

67. [cūḷava. 378 ādayo] ‘‘Upajjhāyena, bhikkhave, saddhivihārikamhi sammā vattitabbaṃ. Tatrāyaṃ sammāvattanā –

67."Monks, a preceptor should conduct himself properly towards his pupil. This is the proper conduct:

‘‘Upajjhāyena, bhikkhave, saddhivihāriko saṅgahetabbo anuggahetabbo uddesena paripucchāya ovādena anusāsaniyā. Sace upajjhāyassa patto hoti, saddhivihārikassa patto na hoti, upajjhāyena saddhivihārikassa patto dātabbo, ussukkaṃ vā kātabbaṃ – kinti nu kho saddhivihārikassa patto uppajjiyethāti. Sace upajjhāyassa cīvaraṃ hoti, saddhivihārikassa cīvaraṃ na hoti, upajjhāyena saddhivihārikassa cīvaraṃ dātabbaṃ, ussukkaṃ vā kātabbaṃ – kinti nu kho saddhivihārikassa cīvaraṃ uppajjiyethāti. Sace upajjhāyassa parikkhāro hoti, saddhivihārikassa parikkhāro na hoti, upajjhāyena saddhivihārikassa parikkhāro dātabbo, ussukkaṃ vā kātabbaṃ – kinti nu kho saddhivihārikassa parikkhāro uppajjiyethāti.

"A preceptor, monks, should embrace and support his pupil by means of teaching, questioning, exhortation, and instruction. If the preceptor has an extra bowl, but the pupil does not have a bowl, a bowl should be given to the pupil by the preceptor, or an effort should be made: 'How might a bowl arise for the pupil?' If the preceptor has an extra robe, but the pupil does not have a robe, a robe should be given to the pupil by the preceptor, or an effort should be made: 'How might a robe arise for the pupil?' If the preceptor has extra requisites, but the pupil does not have requisites, requisites should be given to the pupil by the preceptor, or an effort should be made: 'How might requisites arise for the pupil?'

‘‘Sace saddhivihāriko gilāno hoti, kālasseva uṭṭhāya dantakaṭṭhaṃ dātabbaṃ, mukhodakaṃ dātabbaṃ, āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ. Sace yāgu hoti, bhājanaṃ dhovitvā yāgu upanāmetabbā.

Sace so deso uklāpo hoti, so deso sammajjitabbo.

"If the pupil is sick, having risen early, a tooth-stick should be given, water for the mouth should be given, and a seat should be prepared. If there is rice-gruel, the vessel should be washed and the rice-gruel offered. After he has drunk the rice-gruel, water should be given, the vessel should be received, lowered, and carefully washed without scraping it noisily, then put away. When the pupil has risen, the seat should be removed. If that place is untidy, that place should be swept."

‘‘Sace saddhivihāriko gāmaṃ pavisitukāmo hoti, nivāsanaṃ dātabbaṃ, paṭinivāsanaṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ, kāyabandhanaṃ dātabbaṃ, saguṇaṃ katvā saṅghāṭiyo dātabbā, dhovitvā patto sodako dātabbo.

Obhoge kāyabandhanaṃ kātabbaṃ.

"If the pupil wishes to enter the village, the lower robe should be given, the upper robe should be received, the belt should be given, the outer robes should be given after being properly folded, the bowl should be washed and given with water. Thinking, 'He will return soon,' a seat should be prepared, foot-water, a footstool, and a foot-scraper should be placed nearby. Having gone out to meet him, the bowl and robes should be received, the upper robe should be given, the lower robe should be received. If the robe is damp, it should be aired in the sun for a moment, but the robe should not be left in the sun; the robe should be folded. When folding the robe, raising the edge four finger-widths, the robe should be folded—lest there be a crease in the middle. The belt should be placed in the fold."

‘‘Sace piṇḍapāto hoti, saddhivihāriko ca bhuñjitukāmo hoti, udakaṃ datvā piṇḍapāto upanāmetabbo. Saddhivihāriko pānīyena pucchitabbo.

"If there is almsfood and the pupil wishes to eat, water should be given, and then the almsfood should be offered. The pupil should be asked about drinking water. After he has eaten, water should be given, the bowl should be received, lowered, and carefully washed without scraping it noisily, made free of water, and aired in the sun for a moment, but the bowl should not be left in the sun. The bowl and robes should be put away. When putting away the bowl, one should hold the bowl with one hand and feel for the lower bed or lower stool with the other hand before putting the bowl down. The bowl should not be put directly on the bare ground. When putting away the robe, one should hold the robe with one hand and wipe the robe pole or robe cord with the other hand, then fold the robe from the far end to the near end and put it away. When the pupil has risen, the seat should be removed, the foot-water, footstool, and foot-scraper should be put away. If that place is untidy, that place should be swept."

‘‘Sace saddhivihāriko nahāyitukāmo hoti, nahānaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ. Sace sītena attho hoti, sītaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ. Sace uṇhena attho hoti, uṇhaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ.

"If the pupil wishes to bathe, bathing water should be prepared. If cold water is desired, cold water should be prepared. If hot water is desired, hot water should be prepared."

‘‘Sace saddhivihāriko jantāgharaṃ pavisitukāmo hoti, cuṇṇaṃ sannetabbaṃ, mattikā temetabbā, jantāgharapīṭhaṃ ādāya gantvā jantāgharapīṭhaṃ datvā cīvaraṃ paṭiggahetvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ, cuṇṇaṃ dātabbaṃ, mattikā dātabbā.

"If the pupil wishes to enter the bathhouse, powder should be prepared, clay should be moistened. Having taken the bathhouse stool and gone, the bathhouse stool should be given, the robe should be received and set aside. Powder should be given, clay should be given. If one is able, the bathhouse should be entered. When entering the bathhouse, having smeared the face with clay and covered oneself both front and back, the bathhouse should be entered. Senior monks should not be sat too close to. New monks should not be pushed off their seats. In the bathhouse, service should be performed for the pupil. When leaving the bathhouse, having taken the bathhouse stool and covered oneself both front and back, the bathhouse should be left."

‘‘Udakepi saddhivihārikassa parikammaṃ kātabbaṃ.

"Even in water, service should be performed for the pupil. Having bathed, one should first come out, dry one's own body, put on the lower robe, then the water should be wiped from the pupil's body, the lower robe should be given, and the outer robe should be given. Having taken the bathhouse stool and arrived first, a seat should be prepared, foot-water, a footstool, and a foot-scraper should be placed nearby. The pupil should be asked about drinking water."

"In whatever dwelling the pupil dwells, if that dwelling is untidy, and one is able, it should be cleaned. When cleaning the dwelling, first the bowl and robes should be taken out and set aside; the sitting mat and cover should be taken out and set aside; the mattress and pillow should be taken out and set aside; the bed should be lowered carefully, without scraping or bumping against the door frame, taken out, and set aside; the stool should be lowered carefully, without scraping or bumping against the door frame, taken out, and set aside; the bed supports should be taken out and set aside; the spittoon should be taken out and set aside; the leaning board should be taken out and set aside; after inspecting the floor covering as it was laid out, it should be taken out and set aside.

If the walls treated with red ochre are stained, a cloth should be dampened, wrung out, and used to wipe them. If the floor treated with black dye is stained, a cloth should be dampened, wrung out, and used to wipe it. If the floor is untreated, it should be sprinkled with water and swept—lest the dwelling be covered with dust. The rubbish should be collected and thrown away to one side."

"If dissatisfaction arises in the pupil, the preceptor should address it, or have someone else address it, or give him a Dhamma talk.

If the Saṅgha has already carried out an action against him—whether tajjanīya, niyassa, pabbājanīya, paṭisāraṇīya, or ukkhepanīya—the preceptor should make an effort: 'How might the pupil behave properly, lower his pride, mend his ways, so that the Saṅgha might revoke the action?'"

17.Talk on Dismissal

Yo na sammā vatteyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti. Neva sammā vattanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, asammāvattantaṃ paṇāmetuṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, paṇāmetabbo – ‘‘paṇāmemi ta’’nti vā, ‘‘māyidha paṭikkamī’’ti vā, ‘‘nīhara te pattacīvara’’nti vā, ‘‘nāhaṃ tayā upaṭṭhātabbo’’ti vā, kāyena viññāpeti, vācāya viññāpeti, kāyena vācāya viññāpeti, paṇāmito hoti saddhivihāriko; na kāyena viññāpeti, na vācāya viññāpeti, na kāyena vācāya viññāpeti, na paṇāmito hoti saddhivihārikoti.

68.Now at that time, the resident pupils did not behave properly toward their preceptors. Those monks who were modest … complained and criticized them, saying, “How indeed can resident pupils not behave properly toward their preceptors?” Then those monks reported this matter to the Blessed One … “Is it true, monks, that the resident pupils do not behave properly toward their preceptors?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Buddha rebuked them … “How indeed, monks, can resident pupils not behave properly toward their preceptors?” … Having rebuked them … he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, a resident pupil should not behave improperly toward his preceptor. Whoever does not behave properly incurs an offense of wrong conduct.” They still did not behave properly. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, to dismiss one who does not behave properly. And this is how, monks, he should be dismissed: by saying, ‘I dismiss you,’ or ‘Do not come back here,’ or ‘Take your bowl and robe away,’ or ‘I will not be attended to by you.’ If he makes it known by body, by speech, or by both body and speech, the resident pupil is dismissed; if he does not make it known by body, by speech, or by both body and speech, the resident pupil is not dismissed.

Tena kho pana samayena saddhivihārikā paṇāmitā na khamāpenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, khamāpetunti. Neva khamāpenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, paṇāmitena na khamāpetabbo. Yo na khamāpeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

At that time, the dismissed resident pupils did not ask for forgiveness. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, that they ask for forgiveness.” Still, they did not ask for forgiveness. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, one who has been dismissed should not fail to ask for forgiveness. Whoever does not ask for forgiveness incurs an offense of wrong conduct.”

Tena kho pana samayena upajjhāyā khamāpiyamānā na khamanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, khamitunti. Neva khamanti. Saddhivihārikā pakkamantipi vibbhamantipi titthiyesupi saṅkamanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, khamāpiyamānena na khamitabbaṃ. Yo na khameyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

At that time, preceptors, when asked for forgiveness, would not forgive. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, that they forgive.” Still, they would not forgive. The resident pupils departed, or disrobed, and some even went over to other sects. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, one who is asked for forgiveness should not fail to forgive. Whoever does not forgive incurs an offense of wrong conduct.”

Tena kho pana samayena upajjhāyā sammāvattantaṃ paṇāmenti, asammāvattantaṃ na paṇāmenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, sammāvattanto paṇāmetabbo. Yo paṇāmeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Na ca, bhikkhave, asammāvattanto na paṇāmetabbo. Yo na paṇāmeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

At that time, preceptors dismissed those who behaved properly, but did not dismiss those who behaved improperly. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, one who behaves properly should not be dismissed. Whoever dismisses such a one incurs an offense of wrong conduct. And monks, one who behaves improperly should not fail to be dismissed. Whoever does not dismiss such a one incurs an offense of wrong conduct.”

69.At that time, a certain brahmin approached the monks and requested ordination. The monks were unwilling to ordain him. Unable to obtain ordination from the monks, he became thin, haggard, ugly, pale, with veins spread over his body. The Blessed One saw that brahmin—thin, haggard, ugly, pale, with veins spread over his body—and having seen him, he addressed the monks: “Why, monks, is that brahmin so thin, haggard, ugly, pale, with veins spread over his body?” “Venerable sir, this brahmin approached the monks and requested ordination. The monks were unwilling to ordain him. Unable to obtain ordination from the monks, he has become thin, haggard, ugly, pale, with veins spread over his body.” Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks, who among you remembers a kindness done by that brahmin?” When this was said, Venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, I remember a kindness done by that brahmin.” “But what kindness do you remember, Sāriputta?” “Venerable sir, while I was wandering for alms in Rājagaha, this brahmin gave me a ladleful of food. This, venerable sir, is the kindness I remember from that brahmin.” “Good, good, Sāriputta. For good people, Sāriputta, are grateful and acknowledge what has been done for them. Well then, Sāriputta, you should ordain that brahmin and confer the higher ordination on him.” “But how, venerable sir, should I ordain him and confer the higher ordination on him?” Then the Blessed One, on this occasion and in this connection, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: “Monks, the higher ordination that I allowed through the three refuges—from today onwards, I revoke that. I allow, monks, to confer the higher ordination by means of a formal act consisting of a motion and three announcements. And monks, this is how one should be conferred the higher ordination. A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:

70. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo itthannāmassa āyasmato upasampadāpekkho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmaṃ upasampādeyya itthannāmena upajjhāyena. Esā ñatti.

70.“May the Sangha, venerable sirs, hear me. This person named so-and-so is a candidate for higher ordination under the Venerable so-and-so. If it is agreeable to the Sangha, the Sangha should confer higher ordination on so-and-so with the Venerable so-and-so as his preceptor. This is the motion.”

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo itthannāmassa āyasmato upasampadāpekkho. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ upasampādeti itthannāmena upajjhāyena. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa upasampadā itthannāmena upajjhāyena, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“May the Sangha, venerable sirs, hear me. This person named so-and-so is a candidate for higher ordination under the Venerable so-and-so. The Sangha confers higher ordination on so-and-so with the Venerable so-and-so as his preceptor. Any venerable one who approves of the higher ordination of so-and-so with the Venerable so-and-so as preceptor should remain silent; any who disapproves should speak.”

‘‘Dutiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi – suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo itthannāmassa āyasmato upasampadāpekkho. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ upasampādeti itthannāmena upajjhāyena. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa upasampadā itthannāmena upajjhāyena, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

For a second time I speak on this matter: Venerable sirs, may the Sangha listen to me. This person named so-and-so is a candidate for higher ordination under the venerable so-and-so. The Sangha confers higher ordination on this person named so-and-so, with the venerable so-and-so as preceptor. Any venerable one who approves of the higher ordination of this person named so-and-so, with the venerable so-and-so as preceptor, should remain silent; any who does not approve should speak.

‘‘Tatiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi – suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo itthannāmassa āyasmato upasampadāpekkho. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ upasampādeti itthannāmena upajjhāyena. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa upasampadā itthannāmena upajjhāyena, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

For a third time I speak on this matter: Venerable sirs, may the Sangha listen to me. This person named so-and-so is a candidate for higher ordination under the venerable so-and-so. The Sangha confers higher ordination on this person named so-and-so, with the venerable so-and-so as preceptor. Any venerable one who approves of the higher ordination of this person named so-and-so, with the venerable so-and-so as preceptor, should remain silent; any who does not approve should speak.

‘‘Upasampanno saṅghena itthannāmo itthannāmena upajjhāyena. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

This person named so-and-so has been conferred higher ordination by the Sangha, with the venerable so-and-so as preceptor. The Sangha approves, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.

71. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu upasampannasamanantarā anācāraṃ ācarati. Bhikkhū evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘māvuso, evarūpaṃ akāsi, netaṃ kappatī’’ti.

71.Now at that time a certain monk, immediately after receiving higher ordination, behaved improperly. The monks said to him, "Friend, do not act like this; it is not allowable." He replied, "Venerable sirs, I did not ask you to confer higher ordination on me. Why did you confer higher ordination on me without my asking?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, one should not confer higher ordination on someone who has not asked. Whoever confers higher ordination on someone who has not asked commits an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, that one should confer higher ordination only on those who have asked. And this is how one should be asked: The candidate for higher ordination should approach the Sangha, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, pay homage at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: 'Venerable sirs, I ask the Sangha for higher ordination. Venerable sirs, may the Sangha lift me up out of compassion.' He should be asked a second time. He should be asked a third time. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:

72. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo itthannāmassa āyasmato upasampadāpekkho. Itthannāmo saṅghaṃ upasampadaṃ yācati itthannāmena upajjhāyena. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmaṃ upasampādeyya itthannāmena upajjhāyena. Esā ñatti.

72.Venerable sirs, may the Sangha listen to me. This person named so-and-so is a candidate for higher ordination under the venerable so-and-so. This person named so-and-so asks the Sangha for higher ordination with the venerable so-and-so as preceptor. If it is agreeable to the Sangha, the Sangha should confer higher ordination on this person named so-and-so with the venerable so-and-so as preceptor. This is the motion.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo itthannāmassa āyasmato upasampadāpekkho. Itthannāmo saṅghaṃ upasampadaṃ yācati itthannāmena upajjhāyena.

Venerable sirs, may the Sangha listen to me. This person named so-and-so is a candidate for higher ordination under the venerable so-and-so. This person named so-and-so asks the Sangha for higher ordination with the venerable so-and-so as preceptor. The Sangha confers higher ordination on this person named so-and-so with the venerable so-and-so as preceptor. Any venerable one who approves of the higher ordination of this person named so-and-so with the venerable so-and-so as preceptor should remain silent; any who does not approve should speak.

‘‘Dutiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi…pe… tatiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi…pe….

For a second time I speak on this matter… For a third time I speak on this matter….

‘‘Upasampanno saṅghena itthannāmo itthannāmena upajjhāyena. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

This person named so-and-so has been conferred higher ordination by the Sangha, with the venerable so-and-so as preceptor. The Sangha approves, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.

73. Tena kho pana samayena rājagahe paṇītānaṃ bhattānaṃ bhattapaṭipāṭi aṭṭhitā [adhiṭṭhitā (ka.)] hoti.

73.Now at that time in Rājagaha, a regular distribution of choice food was established. Then a certain brahmin thought: "These ascetics, the Sakyan sons, are of comfortable habits and comfortable conduct; they eat choice food and sleep in sheltered beds. Why don't I go forth among the ascetics, the Sakyan sons?" Then that brahmin approached the monks and requested going forth. The monks gave him going forth and conferred higher ordination. After he had gone forth, the distribution of food dwindled. The monks said to him: "Come now, friend, we will go for almsfood." He replied: "Friends, I did not go forth for this reason, to go for almsfood. If you give me food, I will eat; if not, I will disrobe." "But did you go forth, friend, for the sake of your belly?" "Yes, friend." Those monks who were modest … complained, criticized, and spread it about, saying: "How could a monk go forth in this well-proclaimed Dhamma and Discipline for the sake of his belly?" Those monks reported this matter to the Blessed One. … "Is it true, monk, that you went forth for the sake of your belly?" "It is true, Blessed One." The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked him: … "Foolish man, how could you go forth in this well-proclaimed Dhamma and Discipline for the sake of your belly? This, foolish man, is not for the confidence of those who are without it, nor for the increase of confidence in those who have it." … Having rebuked him, … having given a Dhamma talk, he addressed the monks: "Monks, I allow that when conferring higher ordination, one should explain the four supports: Going forth relies on almsfood obtained by morsels; you should strive at it for life. Any extra allowance: a communal meal, a designated meal, an invitation, a ticket meal, a fortnightly meal, an Uposatha meal, a day-after-Uposatha meal. Going forth relies on rag-robes; you should strive at it for life. Any extra allowance: linen, cotton, silk, wool, hemp, hempen cloth. Going forth relies on lodging at the root of a tree; you should strive at it for life. Any extra allowance: a monastery, a lean-to, a mansion, a dwelling, a cave. Going forth relies on fermented urine as medicine; you should strive at it for life. Any extra allowance: ghee, fresh butter, oil, honey, molasses."

18.The Discourse on the Teacher's Duties

74. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro māṇavako bhikkhū upasaṅkamitvā pabbajjaṃ yāci. Tassa bhikkhū paṭikacceva nissaye ācikkhiṃsu. So evamāha – ‘‘sace me, bhante, pabbajite nissaye ācikkheyyātha, abhirameyyāmahaṃ [abhirameyyañcāhaṃ (sī.), abhirameyyaṃ svāhaṃ (ka.)]. Na dānāhaṃ, bhante, pabbajissāmi; jegucchā me nissayā paṭikūlā’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, paṭikacceva nissayā ācikkhitabbā. Yo ācikkheyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, upasampannasamanantarā nissaye ācikkhitunti.

74.Now at that time a certain young man approached the monks and requested ordination. The monks told him about the supports beforehand. He said: "Venerable sirs, if you would tell me about the supports after I have gone forth, I would be pleased. But now, venerable sirs, I will not go forth; I find the supports disgusting and repulsive." They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, one should not tell about the supports beforehand. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong-doing. I allow that the supports be told immediately after the full ordination."

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū duvaggenapi tivaggenapi gaṇena upasampādenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, ūnadasavaggena gaṇena upasampādetabbo. Yo upasampādeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, dasavaggena vā atirekadasavaggena vā gaṇena upasampādetunti.

At that time, monks were giving full ordination with groups of two or three. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, full ordination should not be given with a group of fewer than ten. Whoever ordains (someone thus) incurs an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, full ordination to be given by a group of ten or more than ten."

75. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū ekavassāpi duvassāpi saddhivihārikaṃ upasampādenti. Āyasmāpi upaseno vaṅgantaputto ekavasso saddhivihārikaṃ upasampādesi. So vassaṃvuṭṭho duvasso ekavassaṃ saddhivihārikaṃ ādāya yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Āciṇṇaṃ kho panetaṃ buddhānaṃ bhagavantānaṃ āgantukehi bhikkhūhi saddhiṃ paṭisammodituṃ. Atha kho bhagavā āyasmantaṃ upasenaṃ vaṅgantaputtaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kacci, bhikkhu, khamanīyaṃ, kacci yāpanīyaṃ, kacci tvaṃ appakilamathena addhānaṃ āgato’’ti? ‘‘Khamanīyaṃ, bhagavā, yāpanīyaṃ, bhagavā. Appakilamathena mayaṃ, bhante, addhānaṃ āgatā’’ti. Jānantāpi tathāgatā pucchanti, jānantāpi na pucchanti, kālaṃ viditvā pucchanti, kālaṃ viditvā na pucchanti; atthasaṃhitaṃ tathāgatā pucchanti; no anatthasaṃhitaṃ. Anatthasaṃhite setughāto tathāgatānaṃ. Dvīhi ākārehi buddhā bhagavanto bhikkhū paṭipucchanti – dhammaṃ vā desessāma, sāvakānaṃ vā sikkhāpadaṃ paññapessāmāti. Atha kho bhagavā āyasmantaṃ upasenaṃ vaṅgantaputtaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kativassosi tvaṃ, bhikkhū’’ti? ‘‘Duvassohaṃ, bhagavā’’ti. ‘‘Ayaṃ pana bhikkhu kativasso’’ti? ‘‘Ekavasso, bhagavā’’ti. ‘‘Kiṃ tāyaṃ bhikkhu hotī’’ti? ‘‘Saddhivihāriko me, bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā – ‘‘ananucchavikaṃ, moghapurisa, ananulomikaṃ appatirūpaṃ assāmaṇakaṃ akappiyaṃ akaraṇīyaṃ. Kathañhi nāma tvaṃ, moghapurisa, aññehi ovadiyo anusāsiyo aññaṃ ovadituṃ anusāsituṃ maññissasi. Atilahuṃ kho tvaṃ, moghapurisa, bāhullāya āvatto, yadidaṃ gaṇabandhikaṃ. Netaṃ, moghapurisa, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya pasannānaṃ vā bhiyyobhāvāya’’…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, ūnadasavassena upasampādetabbo. Yo upasampādeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, dasavassena vā atirekadasavassena vā upasampādetu’’nti.

75.At that time, monks were giving the full ordination to pupils who were one or two years in the rains. Venerable Upasena, the son of Vaṅganta, though one year in the rains, gave the full ordination to a pupil. Having completed the rains, though he was two years in the rains, he took his one-year pupil and went to the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Now, it is the custom of the Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, to exchange friendly greetings with incoming monks. Then the Blessed One said to Venerable Upasena, the son of Vaṅganta: "I hope, monk, you are well, I hope you are comfortable, I hope you have not come fatigued from the journey?" "I am well, Blessed One, I am comfortable, Blessed One. We, venerable sir, have not come fatigued from the journey." The Tathāgatas ask knowing, and they ask not knowing. They ask at the right time, and they ask not at the wrong time. The Tathāgatas ask about what is connected with the goal, not about what is unconnected. For the Tathāgatas, there is a breaking of the bridge to what is unconnected. The Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, question monks in two ways: either they will teach the Dhamma or they will lay down a training rule for the disciples. Then the Blessed One said to Venerable Upasena, the son of Vaṅganta: "How many years in the rains are you, monk?" "I am two years in the rains, Blessed One." "And how many years in the rains is this monk?" "He is one year in the rains, Blessed One." "What relation is this monk to you?" "He is my pupil, Blessed One." The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked him: "It is unsuitable, foolish man, improper, unseemly, unworthy of a renunciate, not allowable, not to be done. How could you, foolish man, think to instruct and admonish another, when you yourself need instruction and admonishment? You have quickly turned to indulgence, foolish man, namely, group-formation. This will not, foolish man, lead to confidence in the unconfident, or to increase of confidence in the confident..." Having rebuked him... he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: "Monks, one should not give the full ordination to one with less than ten years in the rains. Whoever gives the full ordination, there is an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, to give the full ordination to one with ten or more years in the rains."

76.Now at that time monks—thinking, 'We have ten years' seniority, we have ten years' seniority'—were giving the full ordination to the foolish and incompetent. There were preceptors who were foolish, while their pupils were wise. There were preceptors who were incompetent, while their pupils were competent. There were preceptors who were of little learning, while their pupils were very learned. There were preceptors who were of poor wisdom, while their pupils were wise. Even one who had formerly belonged to another sect, when being legitimately corrected by his preceptor, would refute his preceptor’s statement and return to that very sectarian refuge. The monks who were modest … complained and criticized them: "How can monks—thinking, 'We have ten years' seniority, we have ten years' seniority'—give the full ordination to the foolish and incompetent? There are preceptors who are foolish, while their pupils are wise; preceptors who are incompetent, while their pupils are competent; preceptors who are of little learning, while their pupils are very learned; preceptors who are of poor wisdom, while their pupils are wise." Then those monks informed the Buddha of this matter. "Is it true, monks, that monks—thinking, 'We have ten years' seniority, we have ten years' seniority'—are giving the full ordination to the foolish and incompetent? There are preceptors who are foolish, while their pupils are wise; preceptors who are incompetent, while their pupils are competent; preceptors who are of little learning, while their pupils are very learned; preceptors who are of poor wisdom, while their pupils are wise?" "It is true, Blessed One." The Buddha rebuked them: "How can these foolish men—thinking, 'We have ten years' seniority, we have ten years' seniority'—give the full ordination to the foolish and incompetent? There are preceptors who are foolish, while their pupils are wise; preceptors who are incompetent, while their pupils are competent; preceptors who are of little learning, while their pupils are very learned; preceptors who are of poor wisdom, while their pupils are wise. This will not inspire confidence in those without it …" After rebuking them … he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: "Monks, full ordination should not be given by a foolish and incompetent monk. Whoever gives the full ordination incurs an offense of wrong conduct. I allow, monks, that a competent and capable monk of ten years’ standing or more may give the full ordination."

77.Now at that time monks, when their preceptors had left, had disrobed, had passed away, or had gone over to another faction, being without a teacher, unadmonished, uninstructed, poorly dressed, improperly robed, lacking in decorum, went for alms. While people were eating, they held out their bowls for leftover food, for leftover snacks, for leftover delicacies, and for leftover drinks. They themselves asked for curries and rice and ate them. In the refectory, they lived making loud and great noises. People complained and criticized them, saying, "How can these Sakyan ascetics go for alms poorly dressed, improperly robed, lacking in decorum? While people are eating, they hold out their bowls for leftover food, for leftover snacks, for leftover delicacies, and for leftover drinks. They themselves ask for curries and rice and eat them. In the refectory, they live making loud and great noises, just like brahmins at a brahmin feast!" The monks heard the complaints of those people... and they reported the matter to the Blessed One. "Is it true, monks...?" "It is true, Blessed One." ...Having rebuked them, given a Dhamma talk, the Blessed One addressed the monks:

‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, ācariyaṃ. Ācariyo, bhikkhave, antevāsikamhi puttacittaṃ upaṭṭhāpessati, antevāsiko ācariyamhi pitucittaṃ upaṭṭhāpessati.

"Monks, I allow a teacher. Monks, the teacher should establish a parental attitude towards the disciple, and the disciple should establish a filial attitude towards the teacher. Thus, living with mutual respect, deference, and concord, they will attain growth, increase, and abundance in this Dhamma and Discipline. Monks, I allow dependence for ten years, and the giving of dependence to one who has ten years. And, monks, a teacher should be accepted in this way: having arranged the upper robe over one shoulder, bowed at the feet, sat in a squatting position, and raised joined palms, one should say: ‘Venerable sir, be my teacher; I will live in dependence on the venerable one. Venerable sir, be my teacher; I will live in dependence on the venerable one. Venerable sir, be my teacher; I will live in dependence on the venerable one.’ If he indicates with the body, or with speech, or with both body and speech, ‘Good,’ or ‘Very well,’ or ‘It is allowable,’ or ‘It is suitable,’ or ‘Carry it out confidently,’ then the teacher is accepted. If he does not indicate with the body, nor with speech, nor with both body and speech, then the teacher is not accepted."

78."Monks, a disciple should behave properly towards the teacher. This is the proper conduct:"

"Rising early, one should take off the sandals, arrange the upper robe over one shoulder, and offer a tooth-cleaning stick. Water for rinsing the mouth should be provided, and a seat should be arranged. If there is rice gruel, the bowl should be washed and the rice gruel offered. After the rice gruel has been drunk, water should be given, and the bowl should be received back. Holding it low, one should wash it thoroughly without scraping it and put it away. When the teacher has risen, the seat should be removed. If that place is untidy, it should be swept."

"If the teacher wishes to enter the village, a lower robe should be given, the returned lower robe should be received, a belt should be given, the outer robes should be given folded, and a bowl should be given, washed and with water. If the teacher desires an attendant, one should dress in a well-arranged lower robe covering the three circles, fasten the belt, fold the outer robes, put them on, loosen the knot, take the washed bowl, and attend the teacher. One should not walk too far behind, nor too close. The bowl, once full, should be received. One should not interrupt the teacher while he is speaking. If the teacher is speaking about something near an offense, he should be restrained."

"On returning, one should first prepare a seat, provide foot water, a footstool, and a foot-wiping cloth, go forward to receive the bowl and robe, offer an under-robe, and accept the outer robe. If the robe is damp, it should be warmed for a short while, but the robe should not be placed directly in the sun. The robe should be folded. When folding the robe, one should lift the edge by four finger-widths and then fold it—so that no crease forms in the middle. A waistband should be placed on the fold."

"If there is almsfood and the teacher wishes to eat, after giving water, the almsfood should be presented. The teacher should be asked for drinking water. After he has eaten, water should be given, the bowl received, lowered, and carefully washed without scraping it. After making it free of water, it should be exposed to warmth for a short while, but the bowl should not be placed directly in the sun. The bowl and robe should be put away. When putting away the bowl, one should take the bowl with one hand and touch the lower bench or lower seat with the other hand before placing the bowl down. The bowl should not be placed on the bare ground without an intervening layer. When putting away the robe, one should take the robe with one hand and smooth out the robe rack or robe cord with the other hand, then fold the robe edge to edge and put it away. When the teacher has risen, the seat should be removed, and the foot-water, footstool, and foot-wiping cloth should be put away. If the place is untidy, it should be swept."

"If the teacher wishes to enter the hot room, powder should be prepared, and clay moistened. Taking the hot room stool, one should follow right behind the teacher and give him the stool. After receiving his robe, it should be set aside. Powder should be given, and clay should be given. If capable, one should enter the hot room. When entering the hot room, one should smear the face with clay, cover oneself front and back, and then enter the hot room. One should not sit crowding the senior monks. Junior monks should not be pushed aside from the seats. In the hot room, one should attend to the teacher’s needs.

"One should also attend to the teacher’s needs regarding water. After bathing, one should emerge first, dry one's body, put on the lower robe, and then wipe the water from the teacher’s body. The lower robe should be given, and the outer robe should be given. Taking the hot room stool, one should return first, prepare the seat, and set out foot-washing water, a footstool, and a foot-wiping cloth. The teacher should be asked about drinking water.

If dissatisfaction arises in the teacher, the student should pacify it, or have it pacified, or give him a Dhamma talk. If remorse arises in the teacher, the student should dispel it, or arrange for others to dispel it, or give him a Dhamma talk. If a wrong view arises in the teacher, the student should help him abandon it, or arrange for others to do so, or give him a Dhamma talk. If the teacher has committed a heavy offense deserving parivāsa, the student should make an effort: ‘How can the Saṅgha grant the teacher parivāsa?’ If the teacher deserves to be sent back to the beginning (mūlāya paṭikassanāraho), the student should make an effort: ‘How can the Saṅgha send the teacher back to the beginning?’ If the teacher deserves mānatta, the student should make an effort: ‘How can the Saṅgha grant the teacher mānatta?’ If the teacher deserves rehabilitation (abbhāna), the student should make an effort: ‘How can the Saṅgha rehabilitate the teacher?’ If the Saṅgha wants to take disciplinary action against the teacher—whether censure (tajjanīya), demotion (niyassa), banishment (pabbājanīya), reconciliation (paṭisāraṇīya), or suspension (ukkhepanīya)—the student should make an effort: ‘How can the Saṅgha not take action against the teacher, or impose a lighter penalty?’ And if the Saṅgha has already taken disciplinary action—whether censure (tajjanīya), demotion (niyassa), banishment (pabbājanīya), reconciliation (paṭisāraṇīya), or suspension (ukkhepanīya)—the student should make an effort: ‘How can the teacher behave properly, lower his crest, mend his ways, so that the Saṅgha might rescind that action?’

If the teacher’s robe needs washing, the student should wash it, or make an effort, thinking: ‘How can the teacher’s robe be washed?’ If the teacher’s robe needs making, the student should make it, or make an effort, thinking: ‘How can the teacher’s robe be made?’ If the teacher’s dye needs boiling, the student should boil it, or make an effort, thinking: ‘How can the teacher’s dye be boiled?’ If the teacher’s robe needs dyeing, the student should dye it, or make an effort, thinking: ‘How can the teacher’s robe be dyed?’ When dyeing the robe, the student should carefully turn it over and over, and he should not leave without the dye taking properly.

19.The Discourse on the Duties of a Resident Pupil

79. [cūḷava. 381-382] ‘‘Ācariyena, bhikkhave, antevāsikamhi sammā vattitabbaṃ. Tatrāyaṃ sammāvattanā –

79.Monks, a teacher should behave properly towards his pupil. Here is the proper conduct:

‘‘Ācariyena, bhikkhave, antevāsiko saṅgahetabbo anuggahetabbo uddesena paripucchāya ovādena anusāsaniyā. Sace ācariyassa patto hoti, antevāsikassa patto na hoti, ācariyena antevāsikassa patto dātabbo, ussukkaṃ vā kātabbaṃ – kinti nu kho antevāsikassa patto uppajjiyethāti. Sace ācariyassa cīvaraṃ hoti, antevāsikassa cīvaraṃ na hoti, ācariyena antevāsikassa cīvaraṃ dātabbaṃ, ussukkaṃ vā kātabbaṃ – kinti nu kho antevāsikassa cīvaraṃ uppajjiyethāti. Sace ācariyassa parikkhāro hoti, antevāsikassa parikkhāro na hoti, ācariyena antevāsikassa parikkhāro dātabbo, ussukkaṃ vā kātabbaṃ – kinti nu kho antevāsikassa parikkhāro uppajjiyethāti.

A teacher, monks, should embrace his pupil and support him with instruction, questioning, advice, and admonition. If the teacher has a bowl but the pupil does not, the teacher should give a bowl to the pupil, or make an effort, thinking, ‘How might a bowl come to the pupil?’ If the teacher has a robe but the pupil does not, the teacher should give a robe to the pupil, or make an effort, thinking, ‘How might a robe come to the pupil?’ If the teacher has requisites but the pupil does not, the teacher should give requisites to the pupil, or make an effort, thinking, ‘How might requisites come to the pupil?’

‘‘Sace antevāsiko gilāno hoti, kālasseva uṭṭhāya dantakaṭṭhaṃ dātabbaṃ, mukhodakaṃ dātabbaṃ, āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ. Sace yāgu hoti, bhājanaṃ dhovitvā yāgu upanāmetabbā. Yāguṃ pītassa udakaṃ datvā bhājanaṃ paṭiggahetvā nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena dhovitvā paṭisāmetabbaṃ. Antevāsikamhi vuṭṭhite āsanaṃ uddharitabbaṃ. Sace so deso uklāpo hoti, so deso sammajjitabbo.

If the pupil is sick, one should rise early and give him a tooth-stick and water for washing the mouth, and prepare a seat. If there is rice-gruel, one should wash the bowl and offer the rice-gruel. After he has drunk the rice-gruel, one should give him water, receive the bowl, lower it gently, wash it carefully without scraping, drain it of water, and put it away. When the pupil has risen, one should remove the seat. If the place is unswept, one should sweep it.

‘‘Sace antevāsiko gāmaṃ pavisitukāmo hoti, nivāsanaṃ dātabbaṃ, paṭinivāsanaṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ, kāyabandhanaṃ dātabbaṃ, saguṇaṃ katvā saṅghāṭiyo dātabbā, dhovitvā patto sodako dātabbo.

If the pupil wishes to enter the village, one should give him a lower robe, receive the lower robe (he was wearing), give him a belt, give him his outer robes after folding them properly, and give him a washed bowl with water.

‘‘Ettāvatā nivattissatīti āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipitabbaṃ, paccuggantvā pattacīvaraṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ, paṭinivāsanaṃ dātabbaṃ, nivāsanaṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ. Sace cīvaraṃ sinnaṃ hoti, muhuttaṃ uṇhe otāpetabbaṃ, na ca uṇhe cīvaraṃ nidahitabbaṃ. Cīvaraṃ saṅgharitabbaṃ. Cīvaraṃ saṅgharantena caturaṅgulaṃ kaṇṇaṃ ussāretvā cīvaraṃ saṅgharitabbaṃ – mā majjhe bhaṅgo ahosīti. Obhoge kāyabandhanaṃ kātabbaṃ.

Thinking, 'He will return by this time,' a seat should be prepared. Foot water, a footstool, and a foot wiper should be placed nearby. One should go to meet him and receive his bowl and robe. A fresh lower robe should be given (to him), and the (worn) lower robe should be received (from him). If the robe is damp, it should be aired in the sun for a short while, but the robe should not be left in the sun. The robe should be folded. While folding the robe, one should lift the edge four finger-widths and fold it carefully, thinking, 'Lest it crease in the middle.' A waistband should be made at the hem.

‘‘Sace piṇḍapāto hoti, antevāsiko ca bhuñjitukāmo hoti, udakaṃ datvā piṇḍapāto upanāmetabbo. Antevāsiko pānīyena pucchitabbo. Bhuttāvissa udakaṃ datvā pattaṃ paṭiggahetvā nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena dhovitvā vodakaṃ katvā muhuttaṃ uṇhe otāpetabbo, na ca uṇhe patto nidahitabbo. Pattacīvaraṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ. Pattaṃ nikkhipantena ekena hatthena pattaṃ gahetvā ekena hatthena heṭṭhāmañcaṃ vā heṭṭhāpīṭhaṃ vā parāmasitvā patto nikkhipitabbo. Na ca anantarahitāya bhūmiyā patto nikkhipitabbo. Cīvaraṃ nikkhipantena ekena hatthena cīvaraṃ gahetvā ekena hatthena cīvaravaṃsaṃ vā cīvararajjuṃ vā pamajjitvā pārato antaṃ orato bhogaṃ katvā cīvaraṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ. Antevāsikamhi vuṭṭhite āsanaṃ uddharitabbaṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ paṭisāmetabbaṃ. Sace so deso uklāpo hoti, so deso sammajjitabbo.

If there is almsfood, and the pupil wishes to eat, water should be given, and the almsfood should be offered. The pupil should be asked about drinking water. After he has eaten, water should be given, and the bowl should be received. Holding it low, it should be washed thoroughly without scraping, drained of water, and aired in the sun for a short while—but the bowl should not be left in the sun. The bowl and robe should be put away. When putting away the bowl, one should hold the bowl with one hand and touch the lower bench or seat with the other hand before placing it down. The bowl should not be placed directly on the bare ground. When putting away the robe, one should hold the robe with one hand and smooth the robe rack or robe cord with the other. Then, folding the robe lengthwise, edge to edge, it should be put away. When the pupil has risen, the seat should be removed, and the foot water, footstool, and foot wiper should be put away. If the place is unswept, it should be swept.

‘‘Sace antevāsiko nahāyitukāmo hoti, nahānaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ. Sace sītena attho hoti, sītaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ. Sace uṇhena attho hoti, uṇhaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ.

If the pupil wishes to bathe, bathing should be arranged. If he needs cool water, cool water should be arranged. If he needs warm water, warm water should be arranged.

‘‘Sace antevāsiko jantāgharaṃ pavisitukāmo hoti, cuṇṇaṃ sannetabbaṃ, mattikā temetabbā, jantāgharapīṭhaṃ ādāya gantvā jantāgharapīṭhaṃ datvā cīvaraṃ paṭiggahetvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ, cuṇṇaṃ dātabbaṃ, mattikā dātabbā. Sace ussahati, jantāgharaṃ pavisitabbaṃ. Jantāgharaṃ pavisantena mattikāya mukhaṃ makkhetvā purato ca pacchato ca paṭicchādetvā jantāgharaṃ pavisitabbaṃ. Na ca there bhikkhū anupakhajja nisīditabbaṃ, na navā bhikkhū āsanena paṭibāhitabbā. Jantāghare antevāsikassa parikammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Jantāgharā nikkhamantena jantāgharapīṭhaṃ ādāya purato ca pacchato ca paṭicchādetvā jantāgharā nikkhamitabbaṃ.

If the pupil wishes to enter the bathhouse, bath powder should be prepared, clay should be moistened, and the bathhouse stool should be taken along. Upon arriving, the bathhouse stool should be given, and the robe should be received and set aside on one side. Bath powder should be given, and clay should be given. If he is able, he should enter the bathhouse. When entering the bathhouse, one should smear the face with clay, and covering oneself in front and back, one should enter the bathhouse. One should not sit crowding senior monks, nor should junior monks be pushed aside from their seats. In the bathhouse, the pupil should be attended to. When leaving the bathhouse, one should take the bathhouse stool, covering oneself in front and back, and then exit the bathhouse.

‘‘Udakepi antevāsikassa parikammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Nahātena paṭhamataraṃ uttaritvā attano gattaṃ vodakaṃ katvā nivāsetvā antevāsikassa gattato udakaṃ pamajjitabbaṃ, nivāsanaṃ dātabbaṃ, saṅghāṭi dātabbā, jantāgharapīṭhaṃ ādāya paṭhamataraṃ āgantvā āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipitabbaṃ. Antevāsiko pānīyena pucchitabbo.

In the water, too, attendance for the pupil should be done. After bathing, one should emerge first, having made one’s own body free from water, dress, and then wipe the water from the pupil’s body. A lower robe should be given, and an outer robe should be given. Taking the bathhouse stool, one should return first, prepare a seat, and set out foot water, a footstool, and a foot-wiper. The pupil should be asked about drinking water.

‘‘Yasmiṃ vihāre antevāsiko viharati, sace so vihāro uklāpo hoti, sace ussahati, sodhetabbo. Vihāraṃ sodhentena paṭhamaṃ pattacīvaraṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; nisīdanapaccattharaṇaṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; bhisibibbohanaṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; mañco nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena, asaṅghaṭṭentena kavāṭapiṭṭhaṃ, nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbo; pīṭhaṃ nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena, asaṅghaṭṭentena kavāṭapiṭṭhaṃ, nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; mañcapaṭipādakā nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbā; kheḷamallako nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbo; apassenaphalakaṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; bhūmattharaṇaṃ yathāpaññattaṃ sallakkhetvā nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ. Sace vihāre santānakaṃ hoti, ullokā paṭhamaṃ otāretabbaṃ, ālokasandhikaṇṇabhāgā pamajjitabbā. Sace gerukaparikammakatā bhitti kaṇṇakitā hoti, coḷakaṃ temetvā pīḷetvā pamajjitabbā.

Saṅkāraṃ vicinitvā ekamantaṃ chaḍḍetabbaṃ.

In the dwelling where a pupil resides, if that dwelling is dirty, and if he is able, he should clean it. When cleaning the dwelling, first take out the bowl and robe and set them aside to one side. Take out the sitting mat and covering and set them aside to one side. Take out the cushion and pillow and set them aside to one side. Lower the bed carefully, without scraping or knocking it against the doorposts, and take it out to set it aside to one side. Lower the stool carefully, without scraping or knocking it against the doorposts, and take it out to set it aside to one side. Take out the bed legs and set them aside to one side. Take out the spittoon and set it aside to one side. Take out the leaning board and set it aside to one side. Examine the floor covering as arranged, take it out, and set it aside to one side. If the dwelling has cobwebs, first remove them from the ceiling, and wipe the corners and window joints. If the walls, treated with red ochre, have become moldy, moisten a cloth, wring it out, and wipe them. If the floor, treated with black color, has become moldy, moisten a cloth, wring it out, and wipe it. If the floor is untreated, sprinkle it with water and sweep it—lest the dwelling be covered by dust. Gather the rubbish and discard it in one place.

‘‘Bhūmattharaṇaṃ otāpetvā sodhetvā papphoṭetvā atiharitvā yathāpaññattaṃ paññapetabbaṃ. Mañcapaṭipādakā otāpetvā pamajjitvā atiharitvā yathāṭhāne ṭhapetabbā.

“If dissatisfaction arises in a pupil, the teacher should dispel it, have it dispelled, or give them a Dhamma talk. If remorse arises in a pupil, the teacher should dispel it, have it dispelled, or give them a Dhamma talk. If wrong view arises in a pupil, the teacher should eliminate it, have it eliminated, or give them a Dhamma talk. If a pupil has committed a grave offense warranting probation, the teacher should make an effort: ‘How might the Saṅgha grant the pupil probation?’ If a pupil deserves to be sent back to the beginning, the teacher should make an effort: ‘How might the Saṅgha send the pupil back to the beginning?’ If a pupil deserves penance, the teacher should make an effort: ‘How might the Saṅgha grant the pupil penance?’ If a pupil deserves reinstatement, the teacher should make an effort: ‘How might the Saṅgha reinstate the pupil?’ If the Saṅgha intends to carry out an action against a pupil—whether censure, degradation, banishment, requiring reconciliation, or suspension—the teacher should make an effort: ‘How might the Saṅgha not carry out the action against the pupil, or mitigate it?’ But if the Saṅgha has already carried out an action against them—whether censure, degradation, banishment, requiring reconciliation, or suspension—the teacher should make an effort: ‘How might the pupil behave rightly, lower their pride, find a way out, so that the Saṅgha might rescind that action?’

“If the pupil’s robe needs washing, the teacher should instruct: ‘Wash it like this,’ or make an effort: ‘How might the pupil’s robe be washed?’ If the pupil’s robe needs making, the teacher should instruct: ‘Make it like this,’ or make an effort: ‘How might the pupil’s robe be made?’ If dye needs to be cooked for the pupil, the teacher should instruct: ‘Cook it like this,’ or make an effort: ‘How might dye be cooked for the pupil?’ If the pupil’s robe needs dyeing, the teacher should instruct: ‘Dye it like this,’ or make an effort: ‘How might the pupil’s robe be dyed?’ When dyeing a robe, it should be dyed carefully, turning it over and over, and one should not leave the dye-vat with the dye still dripping. If the pupil is sick, he should be cared for as long as he lives, and his recovery should be awaited.”

20.Dismissal and Forgiveness

80. Tena kho pana samayena antevāsikā ācariyesu na sammā vattanti…pe… bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… na, bhikkhave, antevāsikena ācariyamhi na sammā vattitabbaṃ. Yo na sammā vatteyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti. Neva sammā vattanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… anujānāmi, bhikkhave, asammāvattantaṃ paṇāmetuṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, paṇāmetabbo – paṇāmemi tanti vā, māyidha paṭikkamīti vā, nīhara te pattacīvaranti vā, nāhaṃ tayā upaṭṭhātabboti vā. Kāyena viññāpeti, vācāya viññāpeti, kāyena vācāya viññāpeti, paṇāmito hoti antevāsiko; na kāyena viññāpeti, na vācāya viññāpeti, na kāyena vācāya viññāpeti, na paṇāmito hoti antevāsikoti.

80.Now at that time the pupils did not behave properly towards their teachers… they reported this matter to the Blessed One… “Monks, a pupil should not behave improperly towards his teacher. Whoever behaves improperly commits an offense of wrong-doing.” They still did not behave properly. They reported this matter to the Blessed One… “I allow, monks, to dismiss one who behaves improperly. And monks, he should be dismissed in this way: ‘I dismiss you,’ or ‘Do not come back here,’ or ‘Take away your bowl and robe,’ or ‘You are not to attend to me.’ He makes it known by body, he makes it known by speech, he makes it known by body and speech—the pupil is dismissed. He does not make it known by body, he does not make it known by speech, he does not make it known by body and not by speech—the pupil is not dismissed.”

Tena kho pana samayena antevāsikā paṇāmitā na khamāpenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, khamāpetunti. Neva khamāpenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, paṇāmitena na khamāpetabbo. Yo na khamāpeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

At that time, dismissed pupils did not ask for forgiveness. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, that forgiveness should be asked.” Still, they did not ask for forgiveness. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, one who has been dismissed must not fail to ask for forgiveness. Whoever does not ask for forgiveness incurs an offense of wrong conduct.”

Tena kho pana samayena ācariyā khamāpiyamānā na khamanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, khamitunti. Neva khamanti. Antevāsikā pakkamantipi vibbhamantipi titthiyesupi saṅkamanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, khamāpiyamānena na khamitabbaṃ. Yo na khameyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

At that time, teachers did not accept apologies. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, acceptance of apologies.” Still, they did not accept. Pupils departed, wandered off, or even went over to other sects. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, one who is asked for forgiveness should not refuse. Whoever does not forgive incurs an offense of wrong conduct.”

Tena kho pana samayena ācariyā sammāvattantaṃ paṇāmenti, asammāvattantaṃ na paṇāmenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, sammāvattanto paṇāmetabbo. Yo paṇāmeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Na ca, bhikkhave, asammāvattanto na paṇāmetabbo. Yo na paṇāmeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa.

At that time, teachers dismissed those who behaved correctly and did not dismiss those who behaved incorrectly. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, one who behaves correctly should not be dismissed. Whoever dismisses them incurs an offense of wrong conduct. And one who behaves incorrectly should not be left undismissed. Whoever does not dismiss them incurs an offense of wrong conduct.”

81. ‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgato antevāsiko paṇāmetabbo. Ācariyamhi nādhimattaṃ pemaṃ hoti, nādhimatto pasādo hoti, nādhimattā hirī hoti, nādhimatto gāravo hoti, nādhimattā bhāvanā hoti – imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgato antevāsiko paṇāmetabbo.

81.“Monks, a pupil endowed with five qualities should be dismissed. He has no excessive affection for the teacher, no excessive confidence in the teacher, no excessive shame toward the teacher, no excessive reverence for the teacher, and no excessive development [of virtue] toward the teacher. Monks, a pupil endowed with these five qualities should be dismissed.”

‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgato antevāsiko na paṇāmetabbo. Ācariyamhi adhimattaṃ pemaṃ hoti, adhimatto pasādo hoti, adhimattā hirī hoti, adhimatto gāravo hoti, adhimattā bhāvanā hoti – imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgato antevāsiko na paṇāmetabbo.

“Monks, a pupil endowed with five qualities should not be dismissed. He has excessive affection for the teacher, excessive confidence in the teacher, excessive shame toward the teacher, excessive reverence for the teacher, and excessive cultivation (of the teachings). Monks, a pupil endowed with these five qualities should not be dismissed.”

‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgato antevāsiko alaṃ paṇāmetuṃ. Ācariyamhi nādhimattaṃ pemaṃ hoti, nādhimatto pasādo hoti, nādhimattā hirī hoti, nādhimatto gāravo hoti, nādhimattā bhāvanā hoti – imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgato antevāsiko alaṃ paṇāmetuṃ.

“Monks, a pupil endowed with five qualities is fit for dismissal. He has no excessive affection for the teacher, no excessive confidence in the teacher, no excessive shame toward the teacher, no excessive reverence for the teacher, and no excessive devotion to the teacher. Monks, a pupil endowed with these five qualities is fit for dismissal.”

‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgato antevāsiko nālaṃ paṇāmetuṃ. Ācariyamhi adhimattaṃ pemaṃ hoti, adhimatto pasādo hoti, adhimattā hirī hoti, adhimatto gāravo hoti, adhimattā bhāvanā hoti – imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgato antevāsiko nālaṃ paṇāmetuṃ.

“Monks, a pupil endowed with five qualities is not fit for dismissal. He has excessive affection for the teacher, excessive confidence in the teacher, excessive shame toward the teacher, excessive reverence toward the teacher, and excessive devotion toward the teacher. Monks, a pupil endowed with these five qualities is not fit for dismissal.”

‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgataṃ antevāsikaṃ appaṇāmento ācariyo sātisāro hoti, paṇāmento anatisāro hoti. Ācariyamhi nādhimattaṃ pemaṃ hoti, nādhimatto pasādo hoti, nādhimattā hirī hoti, nādhimatto gāravo hoti, nādhimattā bhāvanā hoti – imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgataṃ antevāsikaṃ appaṇāmento ācariyo sātisāro hoti, paṇāmento anatisāro hoti.

“Monks, a teacher who does not dismiss a pupil endowed with five qualities is blameworthy, but one who dismisses such a pupil is not blameworthy. The pupil has no excessive affection for the teacher, no excessive confidence in the teacher, no excessive shame toward the teacher, no excessive reverence for the teacher, and no excessive cultivation (of virtue) towards the teacher. Monks, a teacher who does not dismiss a pupil endowed with these five qualities is blameworthy, but one who dismisses such a pupil is not blameworthy.”

‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgataṃ antevāsikaṃ paṇāmento ācariyo sātisāro hoti, appaṇāmento anatisāro hoti. Ācariyamhi adhimattaṃ pemaṃ hoti, adhimatto pasādo hoti, adhimattā hirī hoti, adhimatto gāravo hoti, adhimattā bhāvanā hoti – imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgataṃ antevāsikaṃ paṇāmento ācariyo sātisāro hoti, appaṇāmento anatisāro hotī’’ti.

“Monks, a teacher who dismisses a pupil endowed with five qualities incurs blame, but one who does not dismiss such a pupil does not incur blame. The pupil has excessive affection for the teacher, excessive confidence in the teacher, excessive shame toward the teacher, excessive reverence for the teacher, and excessive cultivation (of virtue) toward the teacher. Monks, a teacher who dismisses a pupil endowed with these five qualities incurs blame, but one who does not dismiss such a pupil does not incur blame.”

Paṇāmanā khamāpanā niṭṭhitā.

Dismissal and Forgiveness are concluded.

21.The Topic of the Foolish and the Incompetent

82. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū, dasavassamhā dasavassamhāti, bālā abyattā nissayaṃ denti. Dissanti ācariyā bālā, antevāsikā paṇḍitā. Dissanti ācariyā abyattā, antevāsikā byattā.

Dissanti ācariyā bālā antevāsikā paṇḍitā, dissanti ācariyā abyattā antevāsikā byattā, dissanti ācariyā appassutā antevāsikā bahussutā, dissanti ācariyā duppaññā antevāsikā paññavanto’’ti. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, bhikkhū, dasavassamhā dasavassamhāti, bālā abyattā nissayaṃ denti…pe… saccaṃ, bhagavāti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, bālena abyattena nissayo dātabbo. Yo dadeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena dasavassena vā atirekadasavassena vā nissayaṃ dātu’’nti.

82.Now at that time monks, saying, "We have been ordained for ten years, we have been ordained for ten years," gave dependence to foolish and incompetent ones. Foolish teachers were seen with wise pupils. Incompetent teachers were seen with competent pupils. Teachers of little learning were seen with pupils of great learning. Unwise teachers were seen with wise pupils. Those monks who were modest… complained and criticized them: "How can monks, saying, 'We have been ordained for ten years, we have been ordained for ten years,' give dependence to foolish and incompetent ones? Foolish teachers are seen with wise pupils; incompetent teachers are seen with competent pupils; teachers of little learning are seen with pupils of great learning; unwise teachers are seen with wise pupils." Then those monks reported this matter to the Blessed One… "Is it true, monks, that monks, saying, 'We have been ordained for ten years, we have been ordained for ten years,' give dependence to foolish and incompetent ones?" … "It is true, Blessed One." The Blessed One rebuked them… Having rebuked them… after delivering a Dhamma talk, he addressed the monks: "Monks, dependence should not be given by a foolish and incompetent one. Whoever gives it, there is an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, that a competent and capable monk of ten years or more than ten years may give dependence."

22.The Discussion on the Cessation of Dependence

83. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū ācariyupajjhāyesu pakkantesupi vibbhantesupi kālaṅkatesupi pakkhasaṅkantesupi nissayapaṭippassaddhiyo na jānanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

83.At that time, monks did not know how to withdraw dependence even after their teachers or preceptors had departed, become deranged, passed away, or gone over to another group. They reported this matter to the Blessed One.

‘‘Pañcimā, bhikkhave, nissayapaṭippassaddhiyo upajjhāyamhā – upajjhāyo pakkanto vā hoti, vibbhanto vā, kālaṅkato vā, pakkhasaṅkanto vā, āṇattiyeva pañcamī. Imā kho, bhikkhave, pañca nissayapaṭippassaddhiyo upajjhāyamhā.

“Monks, there are these five cessations of dependence on a preceptor: the preceptor has departed, become deranged, passed away, gone over to another community, or a formal declaration is made—this is the fifth. These, monks, are the five cessations of dependence on a preceptor.”

‘‘Chayimā, bhikkhave, nissayapaṭippassaddhiyo ācariyamhā – ācariyo pakkanto vā hoti, vibbhanto vā, kālaṅkato vā, pakkhasaṅkanto vā, āṇattiyeva pañcamī, upajjhāyena vā samodhānagato hoti. Imā kho, bhikkhave, cha nissayapaṭippassaddhiyo ācariyamhā’’.

“Monks, there are these six cessations of dependence on a teacher: the teacher has departed, become deranged, passed away, gone over to another group, or a formal declaration is made—this is the fifth—or he has come into contact with the preceptor. These, monks, are the six cessations of dependence on a teacher.”

86.At that time, a certain former adherent of another sect, when being legitimately addressed by his preceptor in accordance with the Dhamma, accused his preceptor and returned to that same sectarian establishment. Later, he came back and asked the monks for the higher ordination. The monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, that former adherent of another sect who, when being legitimately addressed by his preceptor in accordance with the Dhamma, accused his preceptor and returned to that same sectarian establishment—he has come back and should not be given the higher ordination. Monks, any other former adherent of another sect who desires the going forth, desires the higher ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline, should be given probation for four months. And this is how it should be given: First, he should have his hair and beard shaved off, be dressed in ochre robes, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, pay homage at the feet of the monks, sit in a squatting position, raise his joined palms, and be told to say: ‘I go for refuge to the Buddha, I go for refuge to the Dhamma, I go for refuge to the Sangha; for the second time I go for refuge to the Buddha, for the second time I go for refuge to the Dhamma, for the second time I go for refuge to the Sangha; for the third time I go for refuge to the Buddha, for the third time I go for refuge to the Dhamma, for the third time I go for refuge to the Sangha.’"

Monks, that former member of another sect should approach the Saṅgha, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, pay homage at the feet of the monks, sit in the squatting position, raise his joined palms, and say: ‘Venerable sirs, I, a former member of another sect, desire ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline. I ask the Saṅgha for four months’ probation.’ He should be asked a second time. He should be asked a third time. A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo aññatitthiyapubbo imasmiṃ dhammavinaye ākaṅkhati upasampadaṃ. So saṅghaṃ cattāro māse parivāsaṃ yācati. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ saṅgho itthannāmassa aññatitthiyapubbassa cattāro māse parivāsaṃ dadeyya. Esā ñatti.

Venerable sir, let the Sangha hear me. This person, so-and-so by name, formerly belonging to another sect, desires the higher ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline. He asks the Sangha for four months' probation. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should grant four months' probation to this person, so-and-so by name, formerly belonging to another sect. This is the motion.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo aññatitthiyapubbo imasmiṃ dhammavinaye ākaṅkhati upasampadaṃ. So saṅghaṃ cattāro māse parivāsaṃ yācati. Saṅgho itthannāmassa aññatitthiyapubbassa cattāro māse parivāsaṃ deti. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa aññatitthiyapubbassa cattāro māse parivāsassa dānaṃ, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

Venerable sir, may the Sangha hear me. This person named so-and-so, formerly of another sect, desires the higher ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline. He requests from the Sangha a four-month probationary period. The Sangha grants to so-and-so, formerly of another sect, a four-month probationary period. If it seems fit to any venerable one that the four-month probationary period should be granted to so-and-so, formerly of another sect, let him be silent; if it does not seem fit to anyone, let him speak.

‘‘Dinno saṅghena itthannāmassa aññatitthiyapubbassa cattāro māse parivāso. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

The Saṅgha has granted a four-month probationary period to the one named so-and-so, formerly of another sect. It is pleasing to the Saṅgha, therefore it is silent; thus I hold it.

87. ‘‘Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo ārādhako hoti, evaṃ anārādhako. Kathañca, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo anārādhako hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo atikālena gāmaṃ pavisati, atidivā paṭikkamati. Evampi, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo anārādhako hoti.

87.Thus, monks, one formerly of another sect can be compliant or non-compliant. And how, monks, is one formerly of another sect non-compliant? Here, monks, one formerly of another sect enters the village at an improper time and returns too late in the day. In this way, monks, one formerly of another sect is non-compliant.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo vesiyāgocaro vā hoti, vidhavāgocaro vā hoti, thullakumārikāgocaro vā hoti, paṇḍakagocaro vā hoti, bhikkhunigocaro vā hoti. Evampi, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo anārādhako hoti.

Furthermore, monks, one formerly of another sect consorts with prostitutes, or with widows, or with mature maidens, or with eunuchs, or with bhikkhunīs. In this way, monks, one formerly of another sect is non-compliant.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo yāni tāni sabrahmacārīnaṃ uccāvacāni karaṇīyāni, tattha na dakkho hoti, na analaso, na tatrupāyāya vīmaṃsāya samannāgato, na alaṃ kātuṃ, na alaṃ saṃvidhātuṃ. Evampi, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo anārādhako hoti.

Furthermore, monks, one formerly of another sect is not skilled, nor is he energetic in the various duties to be done for his fellow brahmacārins; he is not endowed with practical discernment, and he is not capable of doing or arranging. In this way, monks, one formerly of another sect is non-compliant.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo na tibbacchando hoti uddese, paripucchāya, adhisīle, adhicitte, adhipaññāya. Evampi, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo anārādhako hoti.

Furthermore, monks, one formerly of another sect does not have intense enthusiasm for study, inquiry, higher virtue, higher mind, or higher wisdom. In this way, monks, one formerly of another sect is non-compliant.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo yassa titthāyatanā saṅkanto hoti, tassa satthuno tassa diṭṭhiyā tassa khantiyā tassa ruciyā tassa ādāyassa avaṇṇe bhaññamāne kupito hoti anattamano anabhiraddho, buddhassa vā dhammassa vā saṅghassa vā avaṇṇe bhaññamāne attamano hoti udaggo abhiraddho. Yassa vā pana titthāyatanā saṅkanto hoti, tassa satthuno tassa diṭṭhiyā tassa khantiyā tassa ruciyā tassa ādāyassa vaṇṇe bhaññamāne attamano hoti udaggo abhiraddho, buddhassa vā dhammassa vā saṅghassa vā vaṇṇe bhaññamāne kupito hoti anattamano anabhiraddho. Idaṃ, bhikkhave, saṅghātanikaṃ aññatitthiyapubbassa anārādhanīyasmiṃ. Evampi kho, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo anārādhako hoti. Evaṃ anārādhako kho, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo āgato na upasampādetabbo.

Furthermore, monks, one formerly of another sect, having come over to this Teaching, becomes angry, displeased, and dissatisfied when the teacher, the view, the preference, the conviction, or the adherence of the sect he left is criticized, but becomes pleased, elated, and satisfied when the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha is criticized. Or he becomes pleased, elated, and satisfied when the teacher, the view, the preference, the conviction, or the adherence of the sect he left is praised, but becomes angry, displeased, and dissatisfied when the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha is praised. This, monks, is a factor for non-compliance in one formerly of another sect. In this way, monks, one formerly of another sect is not compliant. Being thus non-compliant, monks, one formerly of another sect should not be given higher ordination.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo ārādhako hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo nātikālena gāmaṃ pavisati nātidivā paṭikkamati. Evampi, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo ārādhako hoti.

And how, monks, is one formerly of another sect compliant? Here, monks, one formerly of another sect does not enter the village at an improper time nor return too late in the day. In this way, monks, one formerly of another sect is compliant.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo na vesiyāgocaro hoti, na vidhavāgocaro hoti, na thullakumārikāgocaro hoti, na paṇḍakagocaro hoti, na bhikkhunigocaro hoti. Evampi, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo ārādhako hoti.

Furthermore, monks, one formerly of another sect does not associate with prostitutes, does not associate with widows, does not associate with mature maidens, does not associate with eunuchs, and does not associate with nuns. In this way too, monks, one formerly of another sect is worthy of approval.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo yāni tāni sabrahmacārīnaṃ uccāvacāni karaṇīyāni, tattha dakkho hoti, analaso, tatrupāyāya vīmaṃsāya samannāgato, alaṃ kātuṃ, alaṃ saṃvidhātuṃ. Evampi, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo ārādhako hoti.

Furthermore, monks, one formerly of another sect is skilled and unlazy in the various duties to be done for his fellow practitioners, endowed with the discerning wisdom for them, capable of doing them, and capable of arranging them. In this way too, monks, one formerly of another sect is worthy of approval.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo tibbacchando hoti uddese, paripucchāya, adhisīle, adhicitte, adhipaññāya. Evampi, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo ārādhako hoti.

Furthermore, monks, one formerly of another sect has intense enthusiasm for study, inquiry, higher virtue, higher mind, and higher wisdom. In this way too, monks, one formerly of another sect is worthy of approval.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo yassa titthāyatanā saṅkanto hoti, tassa satthuno tassa diṭṭhiyā tassa khantiyā tassa ruciyā tassa ādāyassa avaṇṇe bhaññamāne attamano hoti udaggo abhiraddho, buddhassa vā dhammassa vā saṅghassa vā avaṇṇe bhaññamāne kupito hoti anattamano anabhiraddho. Yassa vā pana titthāyatanā saṅkanto hoti, tassa satthuno tassa diṭṭhiyā tassa khantiyā tassa ruciyā tassa ādāyassa vaṇṇe bhaññamāne kupito hoti anattamano anabhiraddho, buddhassa vā dhammassa vā saṅghassa vā vaṇṇe bhaññamāne attamano hoti udaggo abhiraddho. Idaṃ, bhikkhave, saṅghātanikaṃ aññatitthiyapubbassa ārādhanīyasmiṃ. Evampi kho, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo ārādhako hoti. Evaṃ ārādhako kho, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo āgato upasampādetabbo.

Furthermore, monks, when one formerly of another sect has come over to this Dispensation, if criticism is spoken of the teacher, the view, the tolerance, the inclination, or the commitment of the sect he has left, he is pleased, uplifted, and delighted. But when criticism is spoken of the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Saṅgha, he becomes angry, displeased, and discontent. Or if praise is spoken of the teacher, the view, the tolerance, the inclination, or the commitment of the sect he has left, he becomes angry, displeased, and discontent. But when praise is spoken of the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Saṅgha, he is pleased, uplifted, and delighted. This, monks, is what constitutes acceptability in one formerly of another sect. In this way too, monks, one formerly of another sect is worthy of approval. Being thus worthy of approval, monks, one formerly of another sect who comes should be given full ordination.

‘‘Sace, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyapubbo naggo āgacchati, upajjhāyamūlakaṃ cīvaraṃ pariyesitabbaṃ. Sace acchinnakeso āgacchati, saṅgho apaloketabbo bhaṇḍukammāya. Ye te, bhikkhave, aggikā jaṭilakā, te āgatā upasampādetabbā, na tesaṃ parivāso dātabbo. Taṃ kissa hetu? Kammavādino ete, bhikkhave, kiriyavādino. Sace, bhikkhave, jātiyā sākiyo aññatitthiyapubbo āgacchati, so āgato upasampādetabbo, na tassa parivāso dātabbo. Imāhaṃ, bhikkhave, ñātīnaṃ āveṇikaṃ parihāraṃ dammī’’ti.

If, monks, a former member of another sect comes naked, robes should be sought on the basis of the preceptor. If he comes with uncut hair, the Saṅgha should be informed for the tonsure ceremony. Those fire-worshipping ascetics with matted hair, monks, who come should be given full ordination; no period of probation should be given to them. Why is that? These, monks, are advocates of kamma, advocates of action. If, monks, a former member of another sect comes who is a Sakyan by birth, he should be given full ordination; no period of probation should be given to him. This, monks, is a special privilege I grant to relatives.

Aññatitthiyapubbakathā niṭṭhitā.

The discourse on those formerly of other sects is concluded.

Sattamabhāṇavāro.

26.The Chapter on the Five Diseases

88. Tena kho pana samayena magadhesu pañca ābādhā ussannā honti – kuṭṭhaṃ, gaṇḍo, kilāso, soso, apamāro. Manussā pañcahi ābādhehi phuṭṭhā jīvakaṃ komārabhaccaṃ upasaṅkamitvā evaṃ vadanti – ‘‘sādhu no, ācariya, tikicchāhī’’ti. ‘‘Ahaṃ khvayyo, bahukicco bahukaraṇīyo; rājā ca me māgadho seniyo bimbisāro upaṭṭhātabbo itthāgārañca buddhappamukho ca bhikkhusaṅgho; nāhaṃ sakkomi tikicchitu’’nti. ‘‘Sabbaṃ sāpateyyañca te, ācariya, hotu; mayañca te dāsā; sādhu, no, ācariya, tikicchāhī’’ti. ‘‘Ahaṃ khvayyo, bahukicco bahukaraṇīyo rājā ca me māgadho seniyo bimbisāro upaṭṭhātabbo itthāgārañca buddhappamukho ca bhikkhusaṅgho; nāhaṃ sakkomi tikicchitu’’nti. Atha kho tesaṃ manussānaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘ime kho samaṇā sakyaputtiyā sukhasīlā sukhasamācārā, subhojanāni bhuñjitvā nivātesu sayanesu sayanti. Yaṃnūna mayaṃ samaṇesu sakyaputtiyesu pabbajeyyāma. Tattha bhikkhū ceva upaṭṭhahissanti, jīvako ca komārabhacco tikicchissatī’’ti. Atha kho te manussā bhikkhū upasaṅkamitvā pabbajjaṃ yāciṃsu. Te bhikkhū pabbājesuṃ, upasampādesuṃ. Te bhikkhū ceva upaṭṭhahiṃsu jīvako ca komārabhacco tikicchi. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū bahū gilāne bhikkhū upaṭṭhahantā yācanabahulā viññattibahulā viharanti – gilānabhattaṃ detha, gilānupaṭṭhākabhattaṃ detha, gilānabhesajjaṃ dethāti. Jīvakopi komārabhacco bahū gilāne bhikkhū tikicchanto aññataraṃ rājakiccaṃ parihāpesi.

88.At that time, five diseases were prevalent in Magadha—leprosy, boils, leucoderma, consumption, and epilepsy. People afflicted by these five diseases approached Jīvaka Komārabhacca and said, “Please, teacher, treat us.” “I am busy, sirs, with much to do. I must attend to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, the women’s quarters, and the community of monks with the Buddha at their head. I cannot treat you.” “All our property will be yours, teacher, and we will be your slaves. Please, teacher, treat us.” “I am busy, sirs, with much to do. I must attend to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, the women’s quarters, and the community of monks with the Buddha at their head. I cannot treat you.” Then those people thought, “These Sakyan ascetics live easily, behave easily, eat good food, and sleep in sheltered beds. Why don’t we go forth among the Sakyan ascetics? There, the monks will care for us, and Jīvaka Komārabhacca will treat us.” So they approached the monks and requested ordination. The monks gave them ordination and full admission. The monks cared for them, and Jīvaka Komārabhacca treated them. At that time, monks who were caring for many sick monks lived demanding and importunate lives, constantly asking, “Give food for the sick, give food for those attending the sick, give medicine for the sick.” Jīvaka Komārabhacca, while treating many sick monks, neglected a certain royal duty.

89. Aññataropi puriso pañcahi ābādhehi phuṭṭho jīvakaṃ komārabhaccaṃ upasaṅkamitvā etadavoca – ‘‘sādhu maṃ, ācariya, tikicchāhī’’ti. ‘‘Ahaṃ khvayyo, bahukicco, bahukaraṇīyo, rājā ca me māgadho seniyo bimbisāro upaṭṭhātabbo itthāgārañca buddhappamukho ca bhikkhusaṅgho; nāhaṃ sakkomi tikicchitu’’nti. ‘‘Sabbaṃ sāpateyyañca te, ācariya, hotu, ahañca te dāso; sādhu maṃ, ācariya, tikicchāhī’’ti. ‘‘Ahaṃ khvayyo, bahukicco bahukaraṇīyo, rājā ca me māgadho seniyo bimbisāro upaṭṭhātabbo itthāgārañca buddhappamukho ca bhikkhusaṅgho, nāhaṃ sakkomi tikicchitu’’nti. Atha kho tassa purisassa etadahosi – ‘‘ime kho samaṇā sakyaputtiyā sukhasīlā sukhasamācārā, subhojanāni bhuñjitvā nivātesu sayanesu sayanti. Yaṃnūnāhaṃ samaṇesu sakyaputtiyesu pabbajeyyaṃ. Tattha bhikkhū ceva upaṭṭhahissanti, jīvako ca komārabhacco tikicchissati. Somhi [sohaṃ (bahūsu, vimativinodanīṭīkā oloketabbā)] arogo vibbhamissāmī’’ti. Atha kho so puriso bhikkhu upasaṅkamitvā pabbajjaṃ yāci. Taṃ bhikkhū pabbājesuṃ, upasampādesuṃ. Taṃ bhikkhū ceva upaṭṭhahiṃsu, jīvako ca komārabhacco tikicchi. So arogo vibbhami. Addasā kho jīvako komārabhacco taṃ purisaṃ vibbhantaṃ, disvāna taṃ purisaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘nanu tvaṃ, ayyo, bhikkhūsu pabbajito ahosī’’ti? ‘‘Evaṃ, ācariyā’’ti. ‘‘Kissa pana tvaṃ, ayyo, evarūpamakāsī’’ti? Atha kho so puriso jīvakassa komārabhaccassa etamatthaṃ ārocesi. Jīvako komārabhacco ujjhāyati khiyyati vipāceti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma bhadantā [bhaddantā (ka.)] pañcahi ābādhehi phuṭṭhaṃ pabbājessantī’’ti. Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho jīvako komārabhacco bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sādhu, bhante, ayyā pañcahi ābādhehi phuṭṭhaṃ na pabbājeyyu’’nti. Atha kho bhagavā jīvakaṃ komārabhaccaṃ dhammiyā kathāya sandassesi samādapesi samuttejesi sampahaṃsesi. Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco bhagavatā dhammiyā kathāya sandassito samādapito samuttejito sampahaṃsito uṭṭhāyāsanā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṃ katvā pakkāmi. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, pañcahi ābādhehi phuṭṭho pabbājetabbo. Yo pabbājeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

89.A certain man afflicted with five diseases approached Jīvaka Komārabhacca and said, “Good Master, please treat me.” “Sir, I am very busy with many duties. I must attend to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, the women’s quarters, and the community of monks led by the Buddha. I cannot treat you.” “Master, let all my possessions be yours, and I will be your slave. Please, Master, treat me.” “Sir, I am very busy with many duties. I must attend to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, the women’s quarters, and the community of monks led by the Buddha. I cannot treat you.” Then that man thought, “These Sakyan ascetics live comfortably, behave comfortably, eat good food, and sleep in sheltered beds. What if I were to go forth among the Sakyan ascetics? There, the monks will attend to me, and Jīvaka Komārabhacca will treat me. Then I will recover and leave the Order.” So that man approached the monks and requested ordination. The monks ordained him and gave him full ordination. The monks attended to him, and Jīvaka Komārabhacca treated him. He recovered and left the Order. Jīvaka Komārabhacca saw that man after he had left the Order and said to him, “Sir, weren’t you ordained among the monks?” “Yes, Master.” “Then why, sir, did you act in such a way?” Then that man explained the matter to Jīvaka Komārabhacca. Jīvaka Komārabhacca complained, criticized, and protested, “How could the venerable ones ordain someone afflicted with five diseases?” Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached the Blessed One, paid homage, and sat down to one side. Seated there, he said, “Bhante, it would be good if the venerable ones did not ordain someone afflicted with five diseases.” Then the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, and gladdened Jīvaka Komārabhacca with a Dhamma talk. Having been instructed, encouraged, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk, Jīvaka Komārabhacca rose from his seat, paid homage, circumambulated the Blessed One, and departed. Then, on this occasion, the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, one afflicted with five diseases should not be ordained. Whoever ordains such a person commits an offense of wrong-doing.”

Pañcābādhavatthu niṭṭhitaṃ.

The Chapter on the Five Diseases is concluded.

27.The Story of the Royal Soldier

90. Tena kho pana samayena rañño māgadhassa seniyassa bimbisārassa paccanto kupito hoti. Atha kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro senānāyake mahāmatte āṇāpesi – ‘‘gacchatha, bhaṇe, paccantaṃ uccinathā’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, devā’’ti kho senānāyakā mahāmattā rañño māgadhassa seniyassa bimbisārassa paccassosuṃ. Atha kho abhiññātānaṃ abhiññātānaṃ yodhānaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘mayaṃ kho yuddhābhinandino gacchantā pāpañca karoma, bahuñca apuññaṃ pasavāma.

90.Now at that time the border region of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was in revolt. Then King Bimbisāra of Magadha ordered his generals and ministers: "Go, sirs, and quell the border region." "Yes, Your Majesty," replied the generals and ministers to King Bimbisāra of Magadha. Then some well-known warriors thought: "We delight in war, but by going we will do evil and accumulate much demerit. By what means could we refrain from evil and do good?" Then those warriors thought: "These ascetics, the Sakyan sons, are Dhamma practitioners, righteous, celibate, truthful, virtuous, and of good character. If we were to go forth among the ascetics, the Sakyan sons, thus we would refrain from evil and do good." Then those warriors approached the monks and asked for ordination. The monks gave them ordination and full admission to the Saṅgha. The generals and ministers asked the royal soldiers: "Why, sirs, are so-and-so and so-and-so warriors not seen?" "So-and-so and so-and-so, sirs, have gone forth as monks." The generals and ministers complained, criticized, and expressed their displeasure: "How can the Sakyan ascetics ordain royal soldiers?" The generals and ministers informed King Bimbisāra of Magadha of this matter. Then King Bimbisāra of Magadha asked his judicial ministers: "Sirs, what does one who ordains a royal soldier incur?" "The preceptor, Your Majesty, should be beheaded, the announcer should have his tongue pulled out, and half the ribs of the Saṅgha should be broken." Then King Bimbisāra of Magadha approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, King Bimbisāra of Magadha said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, there are kings who are faithless and unconfident. They might harass the monks even for trivial reasons. It would be good, venerable sir, if the venerable ones did not ordain royal soldiers." Then the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, aroused, and gladdened King Bimbisāra of Magadha with a Dhamma talk. Having been instructed, encouraged, aroused, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk, King Bimbisāra of Magadha rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed. Then, on this occasion, having given a Dhamma talk, the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks, a royal soldier should not be ordained. Whoever ordains one commits an offense of wrong-doing."

Rājabhaṭavatthu niṭṭhitaṃ.

The story of the royal soldier is concluded.

28.The Story of the Robber Aṅgulimāla

91. Tena kho pana samayena coro aṅgulimālo bhikkhūsu pabbajito hoti. Manussā passitvā ubbijjantipi, uttasantipi, palāyantipi, aññenapi gacchanti, aññenapi mukhaṃ karonti, dvārampi thakenti.

Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… na, bhikkhave, dhajabandho coro pabbājetabbo. Yo pabbājeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

91.At that time, the robber Aṅgulimāla had gone forth among the monks. People, upon seeing him, were repulsed, terrified, fled, took another route, turned their faces away, and even bolted their doors. People complained, criticized, and denounced: "How can the Sakyan ascetics ordain a notorious robber?" The monks heard these people complaining, criticizing, and denouncing. Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One… "Monks, a notorious robber should not be ordained. Whoever ordains him commits an offense of wrong-doing."

29.The Story of the Prison-Breaking Thief

92. Tena kho pana samayena raññā māgadhena seniyena bimbisārena anuññātaṃ hoti – ‘‘ye samaṇesu sakyaputtiyesu pabbajanti, na te labbhā kiñci kātuṃ; svākkhāto dhammo, carantu brahmacariyaṃ sammā dukkhassa antakiriyāyā’’ti. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro puriso corikaṃ katvā kārāya baddho hoti. So kāraṃ bhinditvā palāyitvā bhikkhūsu pabbajito hoti. Manussā passitvā evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘ayaṃ so kārabhedako coro. Handa, naṃ nemā’’ti. Ekacce evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘māyyo, evaṃ avacuttha. Anuññātaṃ raññā māgadhena seniyena bimbisārena – ‘‘ye samaṇesu sakyaputtiyesu pabbajanti, na te labbhā kiñci kātuṃ; svākkhāto dhammo, carantu brahmacariyaṃ sammā dukkhassa antakiriyāyā’’ti.

Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, kārabhedako coro pabbājetabbo. Yo pabbājeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

92.Now at that time, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha had granted permission: “Nothing may be done to those who go forth among the Sakyan ascetics; the Dhamma is well-proclaimed, let them practice the holy life rightly for the cessation of suffering.” At that time, a certain man, having committed theft, was imprisoned. He broke out of prison, escaped, and went forth among the monks. People, upon seeing him, said: “This is that prison-breaking thief. Come, let us seize him.” Some said: “Sirs, do not speak thus. King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha had granted permission: ‘Nothing may be done to those who go forth among the Sakyan ascetics; the Dhamma is well-proclaimed, let them practice the holy life rightly for the cessation of suffering.’” People complained, criticized, and protested: “These Sakyan ascetics are immune; nothing can be done to them. How can the Sakyan ascetics ordain a prison-breaking thief?” They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, a prison-breaking thief should not be ordained. Whoever ordains him commits an offense of wrong-doing.”

93.Now at that time, a certain man, having committed theft, fled and went forth among the monks. He had been proscribed by the king’s inner court: “Wherever he is seen, he should be killed.” People, upon seeing him, said: “This is that proscribed thief. Come, let us kill him.” Some said: “Sirs, do not speak thus.

Though they knew, they said, ‘We do not know’; though they saw, they said, ‘We do not see.’ This boy has been ordained among the monks!” The monks heard the complaints, grumblings, and protests of that blacksmith’s apprentice's parents.

36.The Story of Upāli the Boy

99. [idaṃ vatthu pāci. 402 ādayo] Tena kho pana samayena rājagahe sattarasavaggiyā dārakā sahāyakā honti. Upālidārako tesaṃ pāmokkho hoti.

Atha kho upālissa mātāpitūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘sace kho upāli lekhaṃ sikkheyya, evaṃ kho upāli amhākaṃ accayena sukhañca jīveyya, na ca kilameyyā’’ti. Atha kho upālissa mātāpitūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘sace kho upāli lekhaṃ sikkhissati, aṅguliyo dukkhā bhavissanti. Sace kho upāli gaṇanaṃ sikkheyya, evaṃ kho upāli amhākaṃ accayena sukhañca jīveyya, na ca kilameyyā’’ti. Atha kho upālissa mātāpitūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘sace kho upāli gaṇanaṃ sikkhissati, urassa dukkho bhavissati. Sace kho upāli rūpaṃ sikkheyya, evaṃ kho upāli amhākaṃ accayena sukhañca jīveyya, na ca kilameyyā’’ti. Atha kho upālissa mātāpitūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘sace kho upāli rūpaṃ sikkhissati, akkhīni dukkhā bhavissanti. Ime kho samaṇā sakyaputtiyā sukhasīlā sukhasamācārā, subhojanāni bhuñjitvā nivātesu sayanesu sayanti. Sace kho upāli samaṇesu sakyaputtiyesu pabbajeyya, evaṃ kho upāli amhākaṃ accayena sukhañca jīveyya, na ca kilameyyā’’ti.

99.Now at that time in Rājagaha, there was a group of seventeen boys who were friends. Among them, the boy Upāli was the foremost. Then Upāli’s parents thought: “By what means could Upāli live happily after our passing, without toiling?” Then Upāli’s parents thought: “If Upāli were to learn writing, then after our passing, he could live happily and without toiling.” Then Upāli’s parents thought: “But if Upāli learns writing, his fingers will ache. If Upāli were to learn arithmetic, then after our passing, he could live happily and without toiling.” Then Upāli’s parents thought: “But if Upāli learns arithmetic, his chest will ache. If Upāli were to learn painting, then after our passing, he could live happily and without toiling.” Then Upāli’s parents thought: “But if Upāli learns painting, his eyes will ache. These Sakyan ascetics are of pleasant habits and conduct; they eat good food and sleep in sheltered beds. If Upāli were to go forth among the Sakyan ascetics, then after our passing, he could live happily and without toiling.”

Assosi kho upālidārako mātāpitūnaṃ imaṃ kathāsallāpaṃ.

Young Upāli overheard his parents' conversation. Then young Upāli approached those boys and said to them, “Come, sirs, let us go forth among the Sakyan ascetics.” “If you, sir, go forth, then we too will go forth,” they replied. Then those boys each approached their own parents and said, “Permit me to go forth from the household life into homelessness.” Then the parents of those boys, thinking, “All these boys have the same desire and noble intentions,” gave their permission. They approached the monks and requested ordination. The monks ordained them and conferred full ordination. But at dawn, they would rise early and cry, “Give us gruel! Give us rice! Give us snacks!” The monks said to them, “Wait, friends, until daybreak. If there is gruel, you may drink it; if there is rice, you may eat it; if there are snacks, you may consume them. If there is no gruel, rice, or snacks, you may go for alms and eat.” Even when told this by the monks, they kept crying, “Give us gruel! Give us rice! Give us snacks!” They even overturned and dirtied the bedding.

The Blessed One, having woken up in the early morning, heard the sound of children. Having heard it, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, what is that sound of children?” Then Venerable Ānanda informed the Blessed One of this matter… “Is it true, monks, that monks knowingly give the full ordination to a person under twenty years of age?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Buddha rebuked them… “How can you, monks, foolish men that you are, knowingly give the full ordination to a person under twenty years of age? A person under twenty years of age, monks, is incapable of enduring cold, heat, hunger, thirst, the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and creeping things, harsh and unwelcome speech, and bodily feelings that are painful, sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening. But a person of twenty years of age, monks, is capable of enduring cold, heat, hunger, thirst, the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and creeping things, harsh and unwelcome speech, and bodily feelings that are painful, sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening. This, monks, will not lead to confidence in those who are without it, nor to the increase of confidence in those who have it…” Having rebuked them… he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, a person known to be under twenty years of age should not be given the full ordination. Whoever gives the full ordination to such a person should be dealt with according to the Dhamma.”

37.The Story of the Plague

100. Tena kho pana samayena aññataraṃ kulaṃ ahivātakarogena kālaṅkataṃ hoti. Tassa pitāputtakā sesā honti. Te bhikkhūsu pabbajitvā ekatova piṇḍāya caranti.

Na, bhikkhave, ūnapannarasavasso dārako pabbājetabbo. Yo pabbājeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

100.At that time, a certain family had died from the plague. Only the father and son were left. They went forth among the bhikkhus and went on almsround together. Then that boy, seeing his father receiving alms, ran up and said, 'Give to me too, father! Give to me too, father!' People complained, grumbled, and criticized: 'These Sakyan ascetics are not celibate! This boy must have been born from a bhikkhunī!' The bhikkhus heard those people complaining, grumbling, and criticizing. Then those bhikkhus reported the matter to the Blessed One. 'Bhikkhus, a boy under fifteen years old should not be given the going forth. Whoever gives the going forth to such a boy commits an offense of wrong-doing.'

Tena kho pana samayena āyasmato ānandassa upaṭṭhākakulaṃ saddhaṃ pasannaṃ ahivātakarogena kālaṅkataṃ hoti, dve ca dārakā sesā honti. Te porāṇakena āciṇṇakappena bhikkhū passitvā upadhāvanti.

At that time, the family supporting Venerable Ānanda, who were faithful and devoted, had died from the plague, leaving only two boys. Following an old custom, they ran up to the bhikkhus when they saw them. The bhikkhus rejected them. Being rejected by the bhikkhus, they cried. Then Venerable Ānanda thought, 'The Blessed One has laid down that a boy under fifteen should not be given the going forth. But these boys are under fifteen. By what means, then, would these boys not be ruined?' Then Venerable Ānanda reported the matter to the Blessed One. 'Ānanda, are those boys able to scare away crows?' 'They are able, Blessed One.' Then the Blessed One, on this occasion and in this connection, gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the bhikkhus: 'Bhikkhus, I allow a boy under fifteen who can scare away crows to be given the going forth.'

Ahivātakarogavatthu niṭṭhitaṃ.

The account of the plague is finished.

38.The Story of Kaṇṭaka

101. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmato upanandassa sakyaputtassa dve sāmaṇerā honti – kaṇṭako ca mahako ca. Te aññamaññaṃ dūsesuṃ. Bhikkhū ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma sāmaṇerā evarūpaṃ anācāraṃ ācarissantī’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, ekena dve sāmaṇerā upaṭṭhāpetabbā. Yo upaṭṭhāpeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

101.At that time, Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had two sāmaṇeras—Kaṇṭaka and Mahaka. They corrupted each other. The bhikkhus complained, grumbled, and criticized: 'How can these sāmaṇeras engage in such improper conduct?' They reported the matter to the Blessed One. 'Bhikkhus, one should not have two sāmaṇeras attend upon a single bhikkhu. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong-doing.'

102.At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling right there in Rājagaha for the rains, the winter, and the summer. People complained, grumbled, and criticized: 'These Sakyan ascetics are too domesticated; their horizons are dark, they do not go forth to new places.' The bhikkhus heard those people complaining, grumbling, and criticizing. Then those bhikkhus reported the matter to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One addressed Venerable Ānanda: 'Go, Ānanda, take the key and announce to the bhikkhus in the surrounding residences: "Friends, the Blessed One wishes to set out on tour to Dakkhiṇāgiri. Whoever wishes may come."' 'Yes, Venerable Sir,' replied Venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One. Taking the key, he announced to the bhikkhus in the surrounding residences: 'Friends, the Blessed One wishes to set out on tour to Dakkhiṇāgiri. Whoever wishes may come.' The bhikkhus said: 'Friend Ānanda, the Blessed One has laid down that one must live in dependence for ten years, and one may grant dependence after ten years. There, we would have to go, take dependence, stay for a brief period, then return, and take dependence again. If our teachers and preceptors go, we will go too; if our teachers and preceptors do not go, we will not go. Friend Ānanda, our fickleness will become apparent.' Then the Blessed One set out on tour to Dakkhiṇāgiri with a depleted Saṅgha of bhikkhus.

40.The Discourse on Release from Dependence

103. Atha kho bhagavā dakkhiṇāgirismiṃ yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā punadeva rājagahaṃ paccāgacchi. Atha kho bhagavā āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ āmantesi – ‘‘kiṃ nu kho, ānanda, tathāgato ogaṇena bhikkhusaṅghena dakkhiṇāgiriṃ cārikaṃ pakkanto’’ti? Atha kho āyasmā ānando bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesi.

103.Then the Blessed One, having stayed in Dakkhiṇāgiri as long as he pleased, returned to Rājagaha. Then the Blessed One addressed Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, did the Tathāgata set out on tour to Dakkhiṇāgiri with a depleted community of monks?” Then Venerable Ānanda informed the Blessed One of the matter. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, in connection with this incident, gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow that a monk who is articulate and able may live in dependence for five years; an inarticulate one, for life.

105. Atha kho bhagavā rājagahe yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena kapilavatthu tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena kapilavatthu tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā sakkesu viharati kapilavatthusmiṃ nigrodhārāme. Atha kho bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena suddhodanassa sakkassa nivesanaṃ tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi. Atha kho rāhulamātā devī rāhulaṃ kumāraṃ etadavoca – ‘‘eso te, rāhula, pitā. Gacchassu [gacchassa (syā.)], dāyajjaṃ yācāhī’’ti. Atha kho rāhulo kumāro yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavato purato, aṭṭhāsi – ‘‘sukhā te, samaṇa, chāyā’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkāmi. Atha kho rāhulo kumāro bhagavantaṃ piṭṭhito piṭṭhito anubandhi – ‘‘dāyajjaṃ me, samaṇa, dehi; dāyajjaṃ me, samaṇa, dehī’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā āyasmantaṃ sāriputtaṃ āmantesi – ‘‘tena hi tvaṃ, sāriputta, rāhulaṃ kumāraṃ pabbājehī’’ti. ‘‘Kathāhaṃ, bhante, rāhulaṃ kumāraṃ pabbājemī’’ti? Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, tīhi saraṇagamanehi sāmaṇerapabbajjaṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, pabbājetabbo – paṭhamaṃ kesamassuṃ ohārāpetvā kāsāyāni vatthāni acchādāpetvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ kārāpetvā bhikkhūnaṃ pāde vandāpetvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīdāpetvā añjaliṃ paggaṇhāpetvā evaṃ vadehīti vattabbo – buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi, dhammaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi, saṅghaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi; dutiyampi buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi, dutiyampi dhammaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi, dutiyampi saṅghaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi; tatiyampi buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi, tatiyampi dhammaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi, tatiyampi saṅghaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmīti.

105.Then the Blessed One, having stayed in Rājagaha as long as he pleased, set out on a journey toward Kapilavatthu. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Kapilavatthu. There the Blessed One stayed among the Sakyans in the Nigrodha Park. Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe and went to the residence of the Sakyan Suddhodana. Having approached, he sat down on the prepared seat. Then Rāhula’s mother, the queen, said to the young Rāhula: "That, Rāhula, is your father. Go and ask for your inheritance." Then the young Rāhula approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he stood in front of the Blessed One and said: "Pleasant is your shade, ascetic." Then the Blessed One rose from his seat and departed. The young Rāhula followed closely behind the Blessed One, saying: "Give me my inheritance, ascetic; give me my inheritance, ascetic." Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Sāriputta: "Well then, Sāriputta, ordain the young Rāhula." "How, Venerable Sir, am I to ordain the young Rāhula?" Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: "I allow, monks, the going forth as a novice with the three refuges. And this is how, monks, he should be ordained: First, having had the hair and beard shaved off, having put on the ochre robes, having arranged the upper robe over one shoulder, having paid homage at the feet of the monks, having sat in the squatting position, having raised the joined palms, he should be told to say thus: 'I go to the Buddha for refuge. I go to the Dhamma for refuge. I go to the Saṅgha for refuge. For the second time, I go to the Buddha for refuge. For the second time, I go to the Dhamma for refuge. For the second time, I go to the Saṅgha for refuge. For the third time, I go to the Buddha for refuge. For the third time, I go to the Dhamma for refuge. For the third time, I go to the Saṅgha for refuge.' I allow, monks, the going forth as a novice with these three refuges." Then the Venerable Sāriputta ordained the young Rāhula.

Atha kho suddhodano sakko yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho suddhodano sakko bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘ekāhaṃ, bhante, bhagavantaṃ varaṃ yācāmī’’ti. ‘‘Atikkantavarā kho, gotama, tathāgatā’’ti. ‘‘Yañca, bhante, kappati, yañca anavajja’’nti. ‘‘Vadehi, gotamā’’ti. ‘‘Bhagavati me, bhante, pabbajite anappakaṃ dukkhaṃ ahosi, tathā nande, adhimattaṃ rāhule.

Then King Suddhodana approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, King Suddhodana said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, I ask for one boon from the Blessed One." "The Tathāgatas, Gotama, have gone beyond granting boons." "Venerable sir, something that is permissible and blameless." "Speak, Gotama." "Venerable sir, when the Blessed One went forth, I suffered greatly, and so did Nanda, and Rāhula even more. The love for a son, venerable sir, cuts through the skin; having cut through the skin, it cuts through the hide; having cut through the hide, it cuts through the flesh; having cut through the flesh, it cuts through the sinews; having cut through the sinews, it cuts through the bones; having cut through the bones, it reaches the marrow and stays there. It would be good, venerable sir, if the noble ones would not ordain a son without the permission of his parents." Then the Blessed One instructed, inspired, and gladdened King Suddhodana with a Dhamma talk. Having been instructed, inspired, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk, King Suddhodana rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: "Monks, a son should not be ordained without the permission of his parents. Whoever ordains one, commits an offense of wrongdoing."

Atha kho bhagavā kapilavatthusmiṃ yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena sāvatthi tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena sāvatthi tadavasari.

Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Kapilavatthu as long as he pleased, set out on tour toward Sāvatthī. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sāvatthī. There the Blessed One stayed in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Now at that time, the family supporting Venerable Sāriputta sent a boy to Venerable Sāriputta, saying, "Let the venerable one ordain this boy." Then Venerable Sāriputta thought: "The Blessed One has laid down a rule that 'two novices should not be supported by one monk.' And this Rāhula is my novice. How should I proceed?" He reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, a competent monk to support two novices, or as many as he is able to instruct and advise."

Rāhulavatthu niṭṭhitaṃ.

The story of Rāhula is finished.

42.The Exposition on the Training Rules

106. Atha kho sāmaṇerānaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kati nu kho amhākaṃ sikkhāpadāni, kattha ca amhehi sikkhitabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sāmaṇerānaṃ dasa sikkhāpadāni, tesu ca sāmaṇerehi sikkhituṃ – pāṇātipātā veramaṇī [veramaṇi, veramaṇiṃ (ka.)], adinnādānā veramaṇī, abrahmacariyā veramaṇī, musāvādā veramaṇī, surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā veramaṇī, vikālabhojanā veramaṇī, naccagītavāditavisūkadassanā veramaṇī, mālāgandhavilepanadhāraṇamaṇḍanavibhūsanaṭṭhānā veramaṇī, uccāsayanamahāsayanā veramaṇī, jātarūparajatapaṭiggahaṇā veramaṇī. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sāmaṇerānaṃ imāni dasa sikkhāpadāni, imesu ca sāmaṇerehi sikkhitunti.

106.Then it occurred to the novices: “How many training rules do we have, and in what should we train?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. … “I allow, bhikkhus, ten training rules for novices, and in these the novices should train: abstaining from the destruction of life, abstaining from taking what is not given, abstaining from unchastity, abstaining from false speech, abstaining from distilled and fermented liquors that are the basis for heedlessness, abstaining from untimely meals, abstaining from dancing, singing, music, and unseemly shows, abstaining from wearing garlands, using perfumes, and beautifying oneself with adornments, abstaining from high and luxurious beds and seats, abstaining from accepting gold and silver. I allow, bhikkhus, these ten training rules for novices, and in these the novices should train.”

43.The Case of Disciplinary Action

107. Tena kho pana samayena sāmaṇerā bhikkhūsu agāravā appatissā asabhāgavuttikā viharanti. Bhikkhū ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma sāmaṇerā bhikkhūsu agāravā appatissā asabhāgavuttikā viharissantī’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… anujānāmi, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgatassa sāmaṇerassa daṇḍakammaṃ kātuṃ. Bhikkhūnaṃ alābhāya parisakkati, bhikkhūnaṃ anatthāya parisakkati, bhikkhūnaṃ avāsāya parisakkati, bhikkhū akkosati paribhāsati, bhikkhū bhikkhūhi bhedeti – anujānāmi, bhikkhave, imehi pañcahaṅgehi samannāgatassa sāmaṇerassa daṇḍakammaṃ kātunti.

107.Now at that time, the novices were living without respect or deference toward the bhikkhus, behaving in a way that was not harmonious. The bhikkhus complained, murmured, and became indignant: “How can these novices live without respect or deference toward the bhikkhus, behaving in a way that is not harmonious?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One… “I allow, bhikkhus, to impose disciplinary action on a novice endowed with five qualities: he strives for the bhikkhus' disadvantage, he strives for the bhikkhus' harm, he strives for the bhikkhus' expulsion, he insults and abuses the bhikkhus, he creates dissension among the bhikkhus. I allow, bhikkhus, to impose disciplinary action on a novice endowed with these five qualities.”

Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kiṃ nu kho daṇḍakammaṃ kātabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, āvaraṇaṃ kātunti.

Then it occurred to the bhikkhus: “What kind of disciplinary action should be imposed?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, bhikkhus, to impose a restriction.”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū sāmaṇerānaṃ sabbaṃ saṅghārāmaṃ āvaraṇaṃ karonti. Sāmaṇerā ārāmaṃ pavisituṃ alabhamānā pakkamantipi, vibbhamantipi, titthiyesupi saṅkamanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, sabbo saṅghārāmo āvaraṇaṃ kātabbo. Yo kareyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, yattha vā vasati, yattha vā paṭikkamati, tattha āvaraṇaṃ kātunti.

Now at that time, the bhikkhus were making the entire monastery off-limits to the novices. The novices, being unable to enter the monastery, either departed, wandered away, or even went over to other sects. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, the entire monastery should not be made off-limits. Whoever should do so, there is an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, bhikkhus, to make off-limits the place where he dwells or where he frequents.”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū sāmaṇerānaṃ mukhadvārikaṃ āhāraṃ āvaraṇaṃ karonti. Manussā yāgupānampi saṅghabhattampi karontā sāmaṇere evaṃ vadenti – ‘‘etha, bhante, yāguṃ pivatha; etha, bhante, bhattaṃ bhuñjathā’’ti. Sāmaṇerā evaṃ vadenti – ‘‘nāvuso, labbhā. Bhikkhūhi āvaraṇaṃ kata’’nti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma bhadantā sāmaṇerānaṃ mukhadvārikaṃ āhāraṃ āvaraṇaṃ karissantī’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, mukhadvāriko āhāro āvaraṇaṃ kātabbo. Yo kareyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

Now at that time, the bhikkhus were imposing a restriction on the novices' mouth-door food. People, when preparing rice-gruel or a Sangha-meal, would say to the novices: “Come, venerable ones, drink rice-gruel; come, venerable ones, eat the meal.” The novices would say: “Friends, it is not allowed. A restriction has been imposed by the bhikkhus.” People complained, murmured, and became indignant: “How can these venerable ones impose a restriction on the novices' mouth-door food?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, mouth-door food should not be restricted. Whoever should do so, there is an offense of wrong-doing.”

108. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū upajjhāye anāpucchā sāmaṇerānaṃ āvaraṇaṃ karonti. Upajjhāyā gavesanti – kathaṃ [kahaṃ (ka.)] nu kho amhākaṃ sāmaṇerā na dissantīti. Bhikkhū evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘chabbaggiyehi, āvuso, bhikkhūhi āvaraṇaṃ kata’’nti.

Na, bhikkhave, upajjhāye anāpucchā āvaraṇaṃ kātabbaṃ. Yo kareyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

108.Now at that time, the bhikkhus of the group of six, without asking their preceptors, were imposing restrictions on the novices. The preceptors searched, wondering, “Why are our novices not to be seen?” The bhikkhus said, “Friends, the bhikkhus of the group of six have imposed a restriction.” The preceptors complained, murmured, and became indignant: “How can the bhikkhus of the group of six, without asking us, impose restrictions on our novices?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, a restriction should not be imposed without asking the preceptor. Whoever should do so, there is an offense of wrong-doing.”

Now at that time the group-of-six monks enticed away the novices of the elder monks. The elders, fetching tooth sticks and mouthwash themselves, grew tired. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, another’s following should not be enticed away. Whoever does so incurs an offense of wrong-doing.”

Tena kho pana samayena āyasmato upanandassa sakyaputtassa kaṇṭako nāma sāmaṇero kaṇṭakiṃ nāma bhikkhuniṃ dūsesi. Bhikkhū ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma sāmaṇero evarūpaṃ anācāraṃ ācarissatī’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, dasahaṅgehi samannāgataṃ sāmaṇeraṃ nāsetuṃ.

Now at that time a novice named Kaṇṭaka, belonging to Venerable Upananda the Sakyan, defiled a nun named Kaṇṭakī. The monks complained, criticized, and protested, “How can a novice engage in such improper conduct?” They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow the expulsion of a novice possessing ten qualities: he takes life, he takes what is not given, he is unchaste, he is a liar, he drinks alcohol, he speaks dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, he holds wrong view, and he defiles nuns. Monks, I allow the expulsion of a novice possessing these ten qualities.”

Hatthibhaṇḍā assabhaṇḍā dūsesuṃ. Te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘paṇḍakā ime samaṇā sakyaputtiyā. Yepi imesaṃ na paṇḍakā, tepi ime paṇḍake dūsenti. Evaṃ ime sabbeva abrahmacārino’’ti.

Paṇḍako, bhikkhave, anupasampanno na upasampādetabbo, upasampanno nāsetabboti.

109.Now at that time a certain eunuch had gone forth among the monks. He approached very young monks and said, “Come, venerables, defile me.” The monks rejected him, “Get lost, eunuch, perish, eunuch, what use are you?” Rejected by the monks, he then approached large, well-built novices and said, “Come, friends, defile me.” The novices rejected him, “Get lost, eunuch, perish, eunuch, what use are you?” Rejected by the novices, he then approached elephant keepers and horse keepers and said, “Come, friends, defile me.” The elephant keepers and horse keepers defiled him. They complained, criticized, and protested, “These Sakyan ascetics are eunuchs. Even those among them who are not eunuchs defile eunuchs. Thus, they are all unchaste.” The monks heard the complaints of the elephant keepers and horse keepers. Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, a eunuch who has not been ordained should not be ordained; one who has been ordained should be expelled.”

Titthiyapakkantako, bhikkhave, anupasampanno na upasampādetabbo, upasampanno nāsetabboti.

110.Now at that time a certain clansman of an old family, whose family had declined, was accustomed to luxury. Then it occurred to that clansman of an old family, whose family had declined: “I am accustomed to luxury, not capable of acquiring unacquired wealth or increasing acquired wealth. By what means could I live happily without exertion?” Then it occurred to that clansman of an old family, whose family had declined: “These ascetics, the Sakyan sons, are easy in their habits and conduct; having eaten delicious meals, they sleep in sheltered resting places. Why don’t I myself prepare a bowl and robes, shave off my hair and beard, put on ochre robes, go to the monastery, and live with the monks?” Then that clansman of an old family, whose family had declined, prepared a bowl and robes himself, shaved off his hair and beard, put on ochre robes, went to the monastery, and paid homage to the monks. The monks said to him: “How many years [ordained] are you, friend?” “What is this, friend, called ‘how many years [ordained]’?” “Then who is your preceptor, friend?” “What is this, friend, called ‘preceptor’?” The monks said to Venerable Upāli: “Come, friend Upāli, investigate this one who has gone forth.” Then that clansman of an old family, whose family had declined, being investigated by Venerable Upāli, explained the matter. Venerable Upāli informed the monks of the matter. The monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, a thief-dweller who has not been ordained should not be ordained; one who has been ordained should be expelled. Monks, one who has deserted to another sect who has not been ordained should not be ordained; one who has been ordained should be expelled.”

111.Now at that time, a certain nāga was distressed, ashamed, and disgusted with his nāga existence. Then it occurred to that nāga: "By what means could I be freed from this nāga existence and quickly attain human birth?" Then it occurred to that nāga: "These ascetics, the Sons of the Sakyans, are righteous in conduct, harmonious in conduct, living the holy life, truthful, virtuous, and of good character. If I were to go forth among the ascetics, the Sons of the Sakyans, I might be freed from this nāga existence and quickly attain human birth." Then that nāga, in the guise of a young man, approached the monks and requested ordination. The monks ordained him and gave him the full ordination. Now at that time, that nāga was dwelling in a remote monastery together with a certain monk. Then that monk, having risen at dawn, was walking back and forth in the open air. Then, when that monk had departed, the nāga, having relaxed, fell into deep sleep. The entire monastery was filled with a snake, its coils protruding through the windows. Then that monk, thinking, "I will enter the monastery," pushed open the door and saw the entire monastery filled with a snake, its coils protruding through the windows. Seeing this, terrified, he made a loud, unseemly noise. The monks came running and said to that monk, "Why did you make a loud, unseemly noise, friend?" "Friend, this entire monastery is filled with a snake, its coils protruding through the windows!" Then that nāga, awakened by the noise, sat down in his own seat. The monks asked, "Who are you, friend?" "I am a nāga, venerable sir." "But why, friend, did you do such a thing?" Then that nāga explained the matter to the monks. The monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, having assembled the Sangha of monks on this occasion, addressed that nāga: "You nāgas are incapable of growth in this Dhamma and Discipline. Go, nāga, observe the Uposatha there on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of the fortnight. Thus you will be freed from this nāga existence and quickly attain human birth." Then that nāga, thinking, "I am indeed incapable of growth in this Dhamma and Discipline," sorrowful and distressed, shedding tears, made a loud, unseemly noise and departed. Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks, there are two conditions for a nāga’s true nature to be revealed: when he engages in sexual intercourse with his own kind, and when he is relaxed and falls into deep sleep. These are the two conditions for a nāga’s true nature to be revealed. Monks, one born as an animal, being unordained, should not be given the full ordination; if ordained, he should be expelled."

50.The Account of Matricide

112. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro māṇavako mātaraṃ jīvitā voropesi. So tena pāpakena kammena aṭṭīyati harāyati jigucchati. Atha kho tassa māṇavakassa etadahosi – ‘‘kena nu kho ahaṃ upāyena imassa pāpakassa kammassa nikkhantiṃ kareyya’’nti?

112.Now at that time, a certain young man deprived his mother of life. He was troubled, distressed, and disgusted by that evil deed. Then it occurred to him: "By what means could I make an expiation for this evil deed?" Then it occurred to him: "These ascetics, the Sons of the Sakyans, are practitioners of the Dhamma, practitioners of righteous conduct, practitioners of the holy life, truthful, virtuous, and of good character. If I were to go forth among the ascetics, the Sons of the Sakyans, I could make an expiation for this evil deed." Then that young man approached the monks and requested ordination. The monks said to Venerable Upāli: "Friend Upāli, in the past, a nāga went forth among the monks in the guise of a young man. Come, friend Upāli, question this young man." Then, being questioned by Venerable Upāli, that young man disclosed the matter. Venerable Upāli reported the matter to the monks. The monks reported the matter to the Blessed One… "Monks, a matricide, being unordained, should not be given the full ordination; if ordained, he should be expelled."

113.At that time, a certain young man deprived his father of life. He was troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by that evil deed. Then it occurred to the young man: "By what means could I make amends for this evil deed?" Then it occurred to the young man: "These recluses, the Sakyan sons, are practitioners of the Dhamma, of even conduct, followers of the holy life, truthful, virtuous, and of good qualities. If I were to go forth among the recluses, the Sakyan sons, I could make amends for this evil deed." Then that young man approached the bhikkhus and requested ordination. The bhikkhus said to Venerable Upāli: "Friend Upāli, in the past a Nāga also went forth among the bhikkhus in the guise of a young man. Come, friend Upāli, question this young man." Then, being questioned by Venerable Upāli, that young man disclosed the matter. Venerable Upāli reported the matter to the bhikkhus. The bhikkhus reported the matter to the Blessed One. "Bhikkhus, a patricide, being unordained, should not be given the higher ordination; if he has been ordained, he should be expelled."

114.At that time, a number of bhikkhus were traveling on the road from Sāketa to Sāvatthī. Along the way, bandits emerged and robbed some bhikkhus, and killed others. Royal officers from Sāvatthī went out and captured some of the bandits, while others fled. Those who fled then went forth among the bhikkhus, while those who were captured were being led away for execution. Those who had fled and gone forth saw those bandits being led away for execution, and having seen them, said: "It is good that we fled, for if we had been captured, we too would be killed in this way." The bhikkhus said to them, "What is this that you have done, friends?" Then those who had gone forth reported this matter to the bhikkhus. The bhikkhus reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Bhikkhus, these bhikkhus are arahants. Bhikkhus, one who has killed an arahant, being unordained, should not be given the higher ordination; if he has been ordained, he should be expelled."

"Bhikkhus, one who has violated a bhikkhuni, being unordained, should not be given the higher ordination; if he has been ordained, he should be expelled. Bhikkhus, one who has created a schism in the Sangha, being unordained, should not be given the higher ordination; if he has been ordained, he should be expelled. Bhikkhus, one who has drawn blood from a Tathāgata, being unordained, should not be given the higher ordination; if he has been ordained, he should be expelled."

58.Matters Concerning Dependence on the Shameless

120. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū alajjīnaṃ nissayaṃ denti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, alajjīnaṃ nissayo dātabbo. Yo dadeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

120.At that time, the group-of-six monks gave dependence to the shameless. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. [He said:] "Monks, dependence should not be given to the shameless. Whoever gives it commits an offense of wrong conduct."

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū alajjīnaṃ nissāya vasanti. Tepi nacirasseva alajjino honti pāpakābhikkhū. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, alajjīnaṃ nissāya vatthabbaṃ. Yo vaseyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti.

At that time, monks lived in dependence on the shameless. Soon, they too became shameless and bad monks. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. [He said:] "Monks, one should not live in dependence on the shameless. Whoever lives thus commits an offense of wrong conduct."

Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā paññattaṃ ‘na alajjīnaṃ nissayo dātabbo, na alajjīnaṃ nissāya vatthabba’nti. Kathaṃ nu kho mayaṃ jāneyyāma lajjiṃ vā alajjiṃ vā’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, catūhapañcāhaṃ āgametuṃ yāva bhikkhusabhāgataṃ jānāmīti.

Then the monks had this thought: "The Blessed One has laid down: 'Dependence should not be given to the shameless, nor should one live in dependence on the shameless.' But how can we know who is scrupulous and who is unscrupulous?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. [He said:] "I allow, monks, to wait for four or five days until you know the monk's scrupulousness."

59.Matters Concerning Dependence, Beginning with Travelers

121. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu kosalesu janapade addhānamaggappaṭipanno hoti. Atha kho tassa bhikkhuno etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā paññattaṃ ‘na anissitena vatthabba’nti.

Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, addhānamaggappaṭipannena bhikkhunā nissayaṃ alabhamānena anissitena vatthunti.

121.At that time, a certain bhikkhu was traveling on a road in the Kosala country. Then it occurred to that bhikkhu: “The Blessed One has laid down, ‘One should not dwell without dependence.’ But I am one who needs to take dependence, and I am traveling on a road. How then should I proceed?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow a bhikkhu who is traveling on a road and is unable to obtain dependence to dwell without dependence.”

Tena kho pana samayena dve bhikkhū kosalesu janapade addhānamaggappaṭipannā honti. Te aññataraṃ āvāsaṃ upagacchiṃsu. Tattha eko bhikkhu gilāno hoti.

Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, gilānena bhikkhunā nissayaṃ alabhamānena anissitena vatthunti.

At that time, two bhikkhus were traveling along a road in the Kosala country. They approached a certain monastery. There, one bhikkhu was ill. Then it occurred to that sick bhikkhu: “The Blessed One has laid down, ‘One should not dwell without dependence.’ But I am one who needs to take dependence, and I am ill. How then should I proceed?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow a sick bhikkhu who is unable to obtain dependence to dwell without dependence.”

Atha kho tassa gilānupaṭṭhākassa bhikkhuno etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā paññattaṃ ‘na anissitena vatthabba’nti. Ahañcamhi nissayakaraṇīyo, ayañca bhikkhu gilāno, kathaṃ nu kho mayā paṭipajjitabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, gilānupaṭṭhākena bhikkhunā nissayaṃ alabhamānena yāciyamānena anissitena vatthunti.

Then it occurred to the bhikkhu attending to the sick one: “The Blessed One has laid down, ‘One should not dwell without dependence.’ But I am one who needs to take dependence, and this bhikkhu is ill. How then should I proceed?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow a bhikkhu attending to a sick one, if he is unable to obtain dependence, to dwell without dependence when requested [by the sick bhikkhu].”

Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu araññe viharati. Tassa ca tasmiṃ senāsane phāsu hoti. Atha kho tassa bhikkhuno etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā paññattaṃ ‘na anissitena vatthabba’nti. Ahañcamhi nissayakaraṇīyo araññe viharāmi, mayhañca imasmiṃ senāsane phāsu hoti, kathaṃ nu kho mayā paṭipajjitabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

At that time, a certain bhikkhu was dwelling in the forest. And he was comfortable in that lodging. Then it occurred to that bhikkhu: “The Blessed One has laid down, ‘One should not dwell without dependence.’ But I am one who needs to take dependence, and I dwell in the forest, and I am comfortable in this lodging. How then should I proceed?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow a forest-dwelling bhikkhu, assessing his comfortable dwelling and being unable to obtain dependence, to dwell without dependence—thinking, ‘When a suitable preceptor comes, then I will dwell in dependence on that preceptor.’”

122.At that time, Venerable Mahākassapa had a candidate for higher ordination. Then Venerable Mahākassapa sent a messenger to Venerable Ānanda, saying, “Let Ānanda come and make the announcement for this one.” Venerable Ānanda replied, “I do not dare to call the elder by name, for the elder is revered by me.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow the announcement to be made even by clan name.”

123.At that time, Venerable Mahākassapa had two candidates for higher ordination. They argued, “I will receive the higher ordination first!” “I will receive the higher ordination first!” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow two to be ordained with a single announcement.”

Tena kho pana samayena sambahulānaṃ therānaṃ upasampadāpekkhā honti. Te vivadanti – ahaṃ paṭhamaṃ upasampajjissāmi, ahaṃ paṭhamaṃ upasampajjissāmīti.

At that time, many elders had candidates for higher ordination. They argued, “I will receive the higher ordination first!” “I will receive the higher ordination first!” The elders said, “Come, friends, let us all make a single announcement.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow a single announcement to be made for two or three [candidates], but with one preceptor, and certainly not with different preceptors.”

124.At that time, Venerable Kumārakassapa had received the higher ordination as a womb-dweller. Then Venerable Kumārakassapa thought: “The Blessed One has laid down the rule: ‘A person under twenty years of age should not be given the higher ordination.’ But I received the higher ordination as a womb-dweller. Have I received the higher ordination, or have I not received it?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, the birth of a person is reckoned from the moment the first thought arises in the mother’s womb, when the first consciousness appears. I allow, monks, that a womb-dweller may be given the higher ordination.”

63.The Procedure for Higher Ordination

125. Tena kho pana samayena upasampannā dissanti kuṭṭhikāpi gaṇḍikāpi kilāsikāpi sosikāpi apamārikāpi. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, upasampādentena terasa [tassa (ka.)] antarāyike dhamme pucchituṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, pucchitabbo – ‘‘santi te evarūpā ābādhā – kuṭṭhaṃ, gaṇḍo, kilāso, soso, apamāro? Manussosi? Purisosi? Bhujissosi? Aṇaṇosi? Nasi rājabhaṭo? Anuññātosi mātāpitūhi? Paripuṇṇavīsativassosi? Paripuṇṇaṃ te pattacīvaraṃ? Kiṃnāmosi? Konāmo te upajjhāyo’’ti?

125.Now at that time, monks who had received the higher ordination were seen to be suffering from leprosy, boils, skin disease, consumption, and epilepsy. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, that the one giving the higher ordination may ask about the thirteen obstructive factors. And, monks, he should be asked in this way: ‘Do you have such diseases as leprosy, boils, skin disease, consumption, or epilepsy? Are you a human being? Are you a male? Are you free? Are you debtless? Are you not a royal servant? Are you permitted by your parents? Are you fully twenty years of age? Are your bowl and robes complete? What is your name? What is the name of your preceptor?’”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū ananusiṭṭhe upasampadāpekkhe antarāyike dhamme pucchanti. Upasampadāpekkhā vitthāyanti, maṅkū honti, na sakkonti vissajjetuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, paṭhamaṃ anusāsitvā pacchā antarāyike dhamme pucchitunti.

At that time, monks were questioning candidates for higher ordination about the obstructive factors without first instructing them. The candidates for higher ordination became bewildered, embarrassed, and unable to answer. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, that they should first be instructed and then questioned about the obstructive factors.”

Tattheva saṅghamajjhe anusāsanti. Upasampadāpekkhā tatheva vitthāyanti, maṅkū honti, na sakkonti vissajjetuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, ekamantaṃ anusāsitvā saṅghamajjhe antarāyike dhamme pucchituṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, anusāsitabbo –

There, in the midst of the Saṅgha, they instructed them. The candidates for higher ordination became bewildered, embarrassed, and unable to answer. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, after instructing him privately, to question him in the midst of the Saṅgha about the obstructive factors. And, monks, he should be instructed in this way:

126. Paṭhamaṃ upajjhaṃ gāhāpetabbo. Upajjhaṃ gāhāpetvā pattacīvaraṃ ācikkhitabbaṃ – ayaṃ te patto, ayaṃ saṅghāṭi, ayaṃ uttarāsaṅgo, ayaṃ antaravāsako. Gaccha, amumhi okāse tiṭṭhāhīti.

126.First, he should be made to take a preceptor. Having made him take a preceptor, his bowl and robes should be pointed out: ‘This is your bowl, this is the outer robe, this is the upper robe, this is the lower robe. Go, stand in that place.’

Bālā abyattā anusāsanti. Duranusiṭṭhā upasampadāpekkhā vitthāyanti, maṅkū honti, na sakkonti vissajjetuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, bālena abyattena anusāsitabbo. Yo anusāseyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena anusāsitunti.

Fools and the incompetent instructed. Poorly instructed, the candidates for higher ordination became bewildered, embarrassed, and unable to answer. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, a fool or an incompetent person should not instruct. Whoever instructs incurs an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, that a competent and capable monk should instruct.”

Asammatā anusāsanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Na, bhikkhave, asammatena anusāsitabbo. Yo anusāseyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sammatena anusāsituṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, sammannitabbo [sammanitabbo (ka.)] – attanā vā [attanāva (syā.)] attānaṃ sammannitabbaṃ, parena vā paro sammannitabbo.

Unauthorized persons instructed. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, an unauthorized person should not instruct. Whoever instructs incurs an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, that an authorized person should instruct. And, monks, authorization should be conferred in this way: either one authorizes oneself, or another authorizes another.”

Kathañca attanāva attānaṃ sammannitabbaṃ? Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo – ‘‘suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Itthannāmo itthannāmassa āyasmato upasampadāpekkho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, ahaṃ itthannāmaṃ anusāseyya’’nti. Evaṃ attanāva attānaṃ sammannitabbaṃ.

And how is one to authorize oneself? A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha: “Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. So-and-so is a candidate for higher ordination under the Venerable So-and-so. If it is agreeable to the Saṅgha, I would instruct So-and-so.” In this way, one authorizes oneself.

Kathañca pana parena paro sammannitabbo? Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo – ‘‘suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Itthannāmo itthannāmassa āyasmato upasampadāpekkho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, itthannāmo itthannāmaṃ anusāseyyā’’ti. Evaṃ parena paro sammannitabbo.

And how is another to be authorized by another? A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha: “Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. So-and-so is a candidate for higher ordination under the Venerable So-and-so. If it is agreeable to the Saṅgha, So-and-so would instruct So-and-so.” In this way, another is authorized by another.

Tena sammatena bhikkhunā upasampadāpekkho upasaṅkamitvā evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘suṇasi, itthannāma, ayaṃ te saccakālo bhūtakālo. Yaṃ jātaṃ taṃ saṅghamajjhe pucchante santaṃ atthīti vattabbaṃ, asantaṃ natthī’’ti vattabbaṃ. Mā kho vitthāyi, mā kho maṅku ahosi. Evaṃ taṃ pucchissanti – ‘‘santi te evarūpā ābādhā – kuṭṭhaṃ, gaṇḍo, kilāso, soso, apamāro? Manussosi? Purisosi? Bhujissosi? Aṇaṇosi? Nasi rājabhaṭo? Anuññātosi mātāpitūhi? Paripuṇṇavīsativassosi? Paripuṇṇaṃ te pattacīvaraṃ? Kiṃnāmosi? Konāmo te upajjhāyo’’ti?

The authorized monk should approach the candidate for higher ordination and say to him: ‘Listen, So-and-so, this is your time for truth, your time for what is real. When asked in the midst of the Saṅgha about what exists, you should say, “It exists”; about what does not exist, you should say, “It does not exist.” Do not be bewildered, do not be embarrassed. They will ask you: “Do you have any such diseases—leprosy, boils, skin disease, consumption, or epilepsy? Are you a human being? Are you a male? Are you free? Are you debtless? Are you not a royal servant? Are you permitted by your parents? Are you fully twenty years of age? Are your bowl and robes complete? What is your name? What is the name of your preceptor?”’

Ekato āgacchanti. Na, bhikkhave, ekato āgantabbaṃ. Anusāsakena paṭhamataraṃ āgantvā saṅgho ñāpetabbo – ‘‘suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Itthannāmo itthannāmassa āyasmato upasampadāpekkho. Anusiṭṭho so mayā. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, itthannāmo āgaccheyyā’’ti. Āgacchāhīti vattabbo.

They arrived together. “Monks, they should not come together. The instructor should come earlier and inform the Saṅgha: ‘Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. So-and-so is a candidate for higher ordination under the Venerable So-and-so. I have instructed him. If it is agreeable to the Saṅgha, So-and-so may come.’ He should be told: ‘Come!’”

Ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ kārāpetvā bhikkhūnaṃ pāde vandāpetvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīdāpetvā añjaliṃ paggaṇhāpetvā upasampadaṃ yācāpetabbo – ‘‘saṅghaṃ, bhante, upasampadaṃ yācāmi.

Having had him arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, had him worship the monks’ feet, had him sit in a squatting position, and had him raise his hands in añjali, he should be made to request the higher ordination: ‘Venerable sirs, I request the Saṅgha for the higher ordination. Lift me up, venerable sirs, out of compassion. For the second time, venerable sirs, I request the Saṅgha for the higher ordination. Lift me up, venerable sirs, out of compassion. For the third time, venerable sirs, I request the Saṅgha for the higher ordination. Lift me up, venerable sirs, out of compassion.’ Then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo itthannāmassa āyasmato upasampadāpekkho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, ahaṃ itthannāmaṃ antarāyike dhamme puccheyya’’nti?

Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

“Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. This So-and-so is a candidate for higher ordination under the Venerable So-and-so. If it is agreeable to the Saṅgha, I would question So-and-so about the obstructive factors.” “Do you hear, So-and-so? This is your time for truth, your time for what is real. I will ask you about what exists. If it exists, you should say, ‘It exists’; if it does not exist, you should say, ‘It does not exist.’ Do you have any of these diseases—leprosy, boils, skin disease, consumption, epilepsy? Are you a human being? Are you a male? Are you free? Are you debtless? Are you not a royal servant? Are you permitted by your parents? Are you fully twenty years of age? Are your bowl and robes complete? What is your name? What is the name of your preceptor?” A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

127. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo itthannāmassa āyasmato upasampadāpekkho, parisuddho antarāyikehi dhammehi, paripuṇṇassa pattacīvaraṃ.

This So-and-so is a candidate for higher ordination under the Venerable So-and-so, is purified of the obstructive factors, and his bowl and robes are complete. So-and-so requests higher ordination from the Saṅgha with So-and-so as preceptor. If it is agreeable to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha would confer higher ordination on So-and-so with So-and-so as preceptor. This is the motion.”

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo itthannāmassa āyasmato upasampadāpekkho, parisuddho antarāyikehi dhammehi, paripuṇṇassa pattacīvaraṃ.

So-and-so requests higher ordination from the Saṅgha with So-and-so as preceptor. The Saṅgha confers higher ordination on So-and-so with So-and-so as preceptor. If the higher ordination of So-and-so with So-and-so as preceptor is agreeable to any venerable one, he should be silent; if not, he should speak.”

‘‘Dutiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi – suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo itthannāmassa āyasmato upasampadāpekkho, parisuddho antarāyikehi dhammehi, paripuṇṇassa pattacīvaraṃ.

This person, named so-and-so, is an aspirant for higher ordination under the Venerable so-and-so; he is purified of obstructive qualities, and his bowl and robes are complete. So-and-so requests higher ordination from the Sangha with so-and-so as preceptor. The Sangha confers higher ordination upon so-and-so with so-and-so as preceptor. Any venerable one who approves of the higher ordination of so-and-so with so-and-so as preceptor should remain silent; any who does not approve should speak.

‘‘Tatiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi – suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo itthannāmassa āyasmato upasampadāpekkho, parisuddho antarāyikehi dhammehi, paripuṇṇassa pattacīvaraṃ. Itthannāmo saṅghaṃ upasampadaṃ yācati itthannāmena upajjhāyena. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ upasampādeti itthannāmena upajjhāyena. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa upasampadā itthannāmena upajjhāyena, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

For the third time, I speak on this matter: May the Sangha, Venerable Sirs, listen to me. This person, named so-and-so, is an aspirant for higher ordination under the Venerable so-and-so; he is purified of obstructive qualities, and his bowl and robes are complete. So-and-so requests higher ordination from the Sangha with so-and-so as preceptor. The Sangha confers higher ordination upon so-and-so with so-and-so as preceptor. Any venerable one who approves of the higher ordination of so-and-so with so-and-so as preceptor should remain silent; any who does not approve should speak.

‘‘Upasampanno saṅghena itthannāmo itthannāmena upajjhāyena. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

So-and-so has received higher ordination from the Sangha with so-and-so as preceptor. The Sangha approves of this, and therefore it is silent. Thus I record it.

Upasampadākammaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ.

The higher ordination procedure is concluded.

65.Four Things Not to Be Done

129. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū aññataraṃ bhikkhuṃ upasampādetvā ekakaṃ ohāya pakkamiṃsu. So pacchā ekakova āgacchanto antarāmagge purāṇadutiyikāya samāgañchi. Sā evamāha – ‘‘kiṃdāni pabbajitosī’’ti? ‘‘Āma, pabbajitomhī’’ti. ‘‘Dullabho kho pabbajitānaṃ methuno dhammo; ehi, methunaṃ dhammaṃ paṭisevā’’ti. So tassā methunaṃ dhammaṃ paṭisevitvā cirena agamāsi. Bhikkhū evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘kissa tvaṃ, āvuso, evaṃ ciraṃ akāsī’’ti? Atha kho so bhikkhu bhikkhūnaṃ etamatthaṃ ārocesi. Bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, upasampādetvā dutiyaṃ dātuṃ, cattāri ca akaraṇīyāni ācikkhituṃ –

129.Now at that time, some bhikkhus, having given higher ordination to a certain bhikkhu, left him alone and departed. Later, as he was returning alone, he met his former female companion on the way. She said to him: 'Have you now gone forth?' 'Yes, I have gone forth.' 'Sexual intercourse is indeed difficult to obtain for those gone forth. Come, let us engage in sexual intercourse.' He engaged in sexual intercourse with her and arrived after a long time. The bhikkhus asked him: 'Friend, why have you been so long?' Then that bhikkhu told the bhikkhus about this matter. The bhikkhus told the Blessed One about this matter. 'Bhikkhus, I allow that after higher ordination, a second [bhikkhu] should be given [as a companion], and the four prohibitions should be taught.'

‘‘Upasampannena bhikkhunā methuno dhammo na paṭisevitabbo, antamaso tiracchānagatāyapi. Yo bhikkhu methunaṃ dhammaṃ paṭisevati, assamaṇo hoti asakyaputtiyo. Seyyathāpi nāma puriso sīsacchinno abhabbo tena sarīrabandhanena jīvituṃ, evameva bhikkhu methunaṃ dhammaṃ paṭisevitvā assamaṇo hoti asakyaputtiyo. Taṃ te yāvajīvaṃ akaraṇīyaṃ.

A bhikkhu who has received higher ordination should not engage in sexual intercourse, even with an animal. Any bhikkhu who engages in sexual intercourse is no longer a recluse, no longer a son of the Sakyan. Just as a person whose head has been cut off is unable to live with that body, so too a bhikkhu who engages in sexual intercourse is no longer a recluse, no longer a son of the Sakyan. This is a prohibition for you for as long as you live.

‘‘Upasampannena bhikkhunā adinnaṃ theyyasaṅkhātaṃ na ādātabbaṃ, antamaso tiṇasalākaṃ upādāya. Yo bhikkhu pādaṃ vā pādārahaṃ vā atirekapādaṃ vā adinnaṃ theyyasaṅkhātaṃ ādiyati, assamaṇo hoti asakyaputtiyo. Seyyathāpi nāma paṇḍupalāso bandhanā pamutto abhabbo haritatthāya, evameva bhikkhu pādaṃ vā pādārahaṃ vā atirekapādaṃ vā adinnaṃ theyyasaṅkhātaṃ ādiyitvā assamaṇo hoti asakyaputtiyo. Taṃ te yāvajīvaṃ akaraṇīyaṃ.

A bhikkhu who has received higher ordination should not take what is not given, with the intention of theft, not even so much as a blade of grass. Any bhikkhu who takes what is not given, with the intention of theft—whether worth a pāda, worth what deserves a pāda, or more than a pāda—is no longer a recluse, no longer a son of the Sakyan. Just as a yellow leaf fallen from its stalk is incapable of becoming green again, so too a bhikkhu who takes what is not given, with the intention of theft—whether worth a pāda, worth what deserves a pāda, or more than a pāda—is no longer a recluse, no longer a son of the Sakyan. This is a prohibition for you for as long as you live.

‘‘Upasampannena bhikkhunā sañcicca pāṇo jīvitā na voropetabbo, antamaso kunthakipillikaṃ upādāya. Yo bhikkhu sañcicca manussaviggahaṃ jīvitā voropeti, antamaso gabbhapātanaṃ upādāya, assamaṇo hoti asakyaputtiyo. Seyyathāpi nāma puthusilā dvedhā bhinnā appaṭisandhikā hoti, evameva bhikkhu sañcicca manussaviggahaṃ jīvitā voropetvā assamaṇo hoti asakyaputtiyo. Taṃ te yāvajīvaṃ akaraṇīyaṃ.

A bhikkhu who has received higher ordination should not intentionally deprive a living being of life, even so much as a worm or an ant. Any bhikkhu who intentionally deprives a human being of life, even by causing an abortion, is no longer a recluse, no longer a son of the Sakyan. Just as a large rock split in two cannot be rejoined, so too a bhikkhu who intentionally deprives a human being of life is no longer a recluse, no longer a son of the Sakyan. This is a prohibition for you for as long as you live.

‘‘Upasampannena bhikkhunā uttarimanussadhammo na ullapitabbo, antamaso ‘suññāgāre abhiramāmī’ti. Yo bhikkhu pāpiccho icchāpakato asantaṃ abhūtaṃ uttarimanussadhammaṃ ullapati jhānaṃ vā vimokkhaṃ vā samādhiṃ vā samāpattiṃ vā maggaṃ vā phalaṃ vā, assamaṇo hoti asakyaputtiyo. Seyyathāpi nāma tālo matthakacchinno abhabbo puna viruḷhiyā, evameva bhikkhu pāpiccho icchāpakato asantaṃ abhūtaṃ uttarimanussadhammaṃ ullapitvā assamaṇo hoti asakyaputtiyo. Taṃ te yāvajīvaṃ akaraṇīya’’nti.

A bhikkhu who has received higher ordination should not boast of a superhuman state (uttarimanussadhammo), even by saying, ‘I delight in an empty dwelling.’ Any bhikkhu who, wishing for evil and overcome by desires, falsely claims a superhuman state that is not and does not exist—such as jhāna, liberation, concentration, attainment, path, or fruition—is no longer a recluse, no longer a son of the Sakyan. Just as a palm tree whose crown has been cut off is incapable of growing again, so too a bhikkhu who, wishing for evil and overcome by desires, falsely claims a superhuman state that is not and does not exist, is no longer a recluse, no longer a son of the Sakyan. This is a prohibition for you for as long as you live.

Cattāri akaraṇīyāni niṭṭhitāni.

The four prohibitions are concluded.

66.The grounds for suspension for not acknowledging an offense.

130. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu āpattiyā adassane ukkhittako vibbhami. So puna paccāgantvā bhikkhū upasampadaṃ yāci. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

130.At that time, a certain monk who had been suspended for not acknowledging an offense strayed. Later, he returned and asked the monks for full ordination. They reported the matter to the Blessed One.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu āpattiyā adassane ukkhittako vibbhamati. So puna paccāgantvā bhikkhū upasampadaṃ yācati. So evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘passissasi taṃ āpatti’’nti? Sacāhaṃ passissāmīti, pabbājetabbo. Sacāhaṃ na passissāmīti, na pabbājetabbo. Pabbājetvā vattabbo – ‘‘passissasi taṃ āpatti’’nti? Sacāhaṃ passissāmīti, upasampādetabbo. Sacāhaṃ na passissāmīti, na upasampādetabbo. Upasampādetvā vattabbo – ‘‘passissasi taṃ āpatti’’nti? Sacāhaṃ passissāmīti, osāretabbo. Sacāhaṃ na passissāmīti, na osāretabbo. Osāretvā vattabbo – ‘‘passasi [passāhi (sī.)] taṃ āpatti’’nti? Sace passati, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce passati, labbhamānāya sāmaggiyā puna ukkhipitabbo. Alabbhamānāya sāmaggiyā anāpatti sambhoge saṃvāse.

Here, monks, a monk who has been suspended for not seeing an offense wanders about. Later, he returns and asks the monks for full ordination. He should be told, ‘Will you see that offense?’ If he says, ‘I will see it,’ he should be given the going forth. If he says, ‘I will not see it,’ he should not be given the going forth. After giving him the going forth, he should be told, ‘Will you see that offense?’ If he says, ‘I will see it,’ he should be given full ordination. If he says, ‘I will not see it,’ he should not be given full ordination. After giving him full ordination, he should be told, ‘Will you see that offense?’ If he says, ‘I will see it,’ he should be reinstated. If he says, ‘I will not see it,’ he should not be reinstated. After reinstating him, he should be told, ‘Do you see that offense?’ If he sees it, that is skillful. If he does not see it, if the Saṅgha is in harmony, he should be suspended again. If the Saṅgha is not in harmony, there is no offense in communal living and association.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu āpattiyā appaṭikamme ukkhittako vibbhamati. So puna paccāgantvā bhikkhū upasampadaṃ yācati. So evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘paṭikarissasi taṃ āpatti’’nti? Sacāhaṃ paṭikarissāmīti, pabbājetabbo. Sacāhaṃ na paṭikarissāmīti, na pabbājetabbo. Pabbājetvā vattabbo – ‘‘paṭikarissasi taṃ āpatti’’nti? Sacāhaṃ paṭikarissāmīti, upasampādetabbo. Sacāhaṃ na paṭikarissāmīti, na upasampādetabbo. Upasampādetvā vattabbo – ‘‘paṭikarissasi taṃ āpatti’’nti? Sacāhaṃ paṭikarissāmīti, osāretabbo. Sacāhaṃ na paṭikarissāmīti, na osāretabbo. Osāretvā vattabbo – ‘‘paṭikarohi taṃ āpatti’’nti. Sace paṭikaroti, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce paṭikaroti labbhamānāya sāmaggiyā puna ukkhipitabbo. Alabbhamānāya sāmaggiyā anāpatti sambhoge saṃvāse.

Here, monks, a monk who has been suspended for not making amends for an offense wanders about. Later, he returns and asks the monks for full ordination. He should be told, ‘Will you make amends for that offense?’ If he says, ‘I will make amends,’ he should be given the going forth. If he says, ‘I will not make amends,’ he should not be given the going forth. After giving him the going forth, he should be told, ‘Will you make amends for that offense?’ If he says, ‘I will make amends,’ he should be given full ordination. If he says, ‘I will not make amends,’ he should not be given full ordination. After giving him full ordination, he should be told, ‘Will you make amends for that offense?’ If he says, ‘I will make amends,’ he should be reinstated. If he says, ‘I will not make amends,’ he should not be reinstated. After reinstating him, he should be told, ‘Make amends for that offense.’ If he makes amends, that is skillful. If he does not make amends, if the Saṅgha is in harmony, he should be suspended again. If the Saṅgha is not in harmony, there is no offense in communal living and association.

Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu pāpikāya diṭṭhiyā appaṭinissagge ukkhittako vibbhamati. So puna paccāgantvā bhikkhū upasampadaṃ yācati. So evamassa vacanīyo – ‘‘paṭinissajjissasi taṃ pāpikaṃ diṭṭhi’’nti? Sacāhaṃ paṭinissajjissāmīti, pabbājetabbo. Sacāhaṃ na paṭinissajjissāmīti, na pabbājetabbo. Pabbājetvā vattabbo – ‘‘paṭinissajjissasi taṃ pāpikaṃ diṭṭhi’’nti? Sacāhaṃ paṭinissajjissāmīti, upasampādetabbo. Sacāhaṃ na paṭinissajjissāmīti, na upasampādetabbo. Upasampādetvā vattabbo – ‘‘paṭinissajjissasi taṃ pāpikaṃ diṭṭhi’’nti? Sacāhaṃ paṭinissajjissāmīti, osāretabbo. Sacāhaṃ na paṭinissajjissāmīti, na osāretabbo. Osāretvā vattabbo – ‘‘paṭinissajjehi taṃ pāpikaṃ diṭṭhi’’nti. Sace paṭinissajjati, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce paṭinissajjati, labbhamānāya sāmaggiyā puna ukkhipitabbo. Alabbhamānāya sāmaggiyā anāpatti sambhoge saṃvāseti.

Here, monks, a monk who has been suspended for not giving up a wrong view wanders about. Later, he returns and asks the monks for full ordination. He should be told, ‘Will you give up that wrong view?’ If he says, ‘I will give it up,’ he should be given the going forth. If he says, ‘I will not give it up,’ he should not be given the going forth. After giving him the going forth, he should be told, ‘Will you give up that wrong view?’ If he says, ‘I will give it up,’ he should be given full ordination. If he says, ‘I will not give it up,’ he should not be given full ordination. After giving him full ordination, he should be told, ‘Will you give up that wrong view?’ If he says, ‘I will give it up,’ he should be reinstated. If he says, ‘I will not give it up,’ he should not be reinstated. After reinstating him, he should be told, ‘Give up that wrong view.’ If he gives it up, that is skillful. If he does not give it up, if the Saṅgha is in harmony, he should be suspended again. If the Saṅgha is not in harmony, there is no offense in communal living and association.

67.Summary

131.

Vinayamhi mahatthesu, pesalānaṃ sukhāvahe;Niggahānañca pāpicche, lajjīnaṃ paggahesu ca.

In the Vinaya, for those of great purpose, for the virtuous, bringing welfare; and for restraining those with evil wishes, and for supporting the conscientious.

Sāsanādhāraṇe ceva, sabbaññujinagocare;Anaññavisaye kheme, supaññatte asaṃsaye.

And in upholding the Dispensation, in the domain of the All-knowing Conqueror; in the secure realm with no other object, in the well-proclaimed, free from doubt.

Khandhake vinaye ceva, parivāre ca mātike;Yathātthakārī kusalo, paṭipajjati yoniso.

In the Khandhakas, in the Vinaya, and in the Parivāra and the Mātikā; skillfully acting in accordance with the meaning, one proceeds systematically.

Yo gavaṃ na vijānāti, na so rakkhati gogaṇaṃ;Evaṃ sīlaṃ ajānanto, kiṃ so rakkheyya saṃvaraṃ.

One who does not understand cows does not protect the herd; so too, one who does not understand virtue, how can they guard restraint?

Pamuṭṭhamhi ca suttante, abhidhamme ca tāvade;Vinaye avinaṭṭhamhi, puna tiṭṭhati sāsanaṃ.

When the Suttantas are forgotten, and likewise the Abhidhamma, but when the Vinaya is not lost, the Dispensation stands again.

Tasmā saṅgāhaṇāhetuṃ [saṅgāhanāhetuṃ (ka.)], uddānaṃ anupubbaso;Pavakkhāmi yathāñāyaṃ, suṇātha mama bhāsato.

Therefore, for the sake of compilation, I will declare the summary in due order according to the proper method; listen to me as I speak.

Vatthu nidānaṃ āpatti, nayā peyyālameva ca;Dukkaraṃ taṃ asesetuṃ, nayato taṃ vijānathāti.

The basis, the cause, the offense, the methods, and the abbreviated forms as well; it is difficult to exhaust them all, know them by the method.

Bodhi rājāyatanañca, ajapālo sahampati;Brahmā āḷāro udako, bhikkhu ca upako isi.

The Bodhi tree, the Rājāyatana tree, the goatherd, Sahampati Brahmā; Brahmā, Āḷāra, Uddaka, and the monk Upaka, the seer.

Koṇḍañño vappo bhaddiyo, mahānāmo ca assaji;Yaso cattāro paññāsa, sabbe pesesi so disā.

Koṇḍañña, Vappa, Bhaddiya, Mahānāma, and Assaji; and Yasa with his fifty-four companions – all these he sent in different directions.

Vatthu mārehi tiṃsā ca, uruvelaṃ tayo jaṭī;Agyāgāraṃ mahārājā, sakko brahmā ca kevalā.

The incident, thirty with Māra, Uruvelā, the three matted-hair ascetics; the fire hall, the great king, Sakka, and Brahmā, entirely.

Paṃsukūlaṃ pokkharaṇī, silā ca kakudho silā;Jambu ambo ca āmalo, pāripupphañca āhari.

The rag-robe, the lotus pond, and the stone, and the hump on the stone; the rose apple, the mango, and the emblic myrobalan, and the coral tree flower were brought.

Phāliyantu ujjalantu, vijjhāyantu ca kassapa;Nimujjanti mukhī megho, gayā laṭṭhi ca māgadho.

May they split, may they blaze, and may they be extinguished, O Kassapa; faces sink, the cloud, and the Gayā staff, and the Magadhan.

Upatisso kolito ca, abhiññātā ca pabbajuṃ;Dunnivatthā paṇāmanā, kiso lūkho ca brāhmaṇo.

Upatissa and Kolita, well-known, went forth; poorly clad, paying homage, lean and rough was the brahmin.

Anācāraṃ ācarati, udaraṃ māṇavo gaṇo;Vassaṃ bālehi pakkanto, dasa vassāni nissayo.

He behaves improperly, the group of boys with swollen bellies; the rains residence was abandoned by the fools, a dependence of ten years.

Na vattanti paṇāmetuṃ, bālā passaddhi pañca cha;Yo so añño ca naggo ca, acchinnajaṭilasākiyo.

They do not succeed in dismissing, the fools, tranquility, five, six; that other one, naked, and the uncut matted-hair Sakyan.

Magadhesu pañcābādhā, eko rājā [bhaṭo coro (syā.)] ca aṅguli;Māgadho ca anuññāsi, kārā likhi kasāhato.

Among the Magadhans, five diseases, one king, and Anguli; and the Magadhan permitted, the prison, the writing, the one struck by a whip.

Lakkhaṇā iṇā dāso ca, bhaṇḍuko upāli ahi;Saddhaṃ kulaṃ kaṇṭako ca, āhundarikameva ca.

The marks, debt, and a slave, Bhaṇḍuka, Upāli, a snake; a faithful family, and a thorn, and a container of ghee.

Vatthumhi dārako sikkhā, viharanti ca kiṃ nu kho;Sabbaṃ mukhaṃ upajjhāye, apalāḷana kaṇṭako.

The boy in the story, the training, and what do they dwell upon? All the mouth belongs to the preceptor; the thorn of not pampering.

Paṇḍako theyyapakkanto, ahi ca mātarī pitā;Arahantabhikkhunībhedā, ruhirena ca byañjanaṃ.

The eunuch, the thief who went forth, and a snake, mother, father; the schism of an arahant bhikkhuni, and the mark with blood.

Anupajjhāyasaṅghena, gaṇapaṇḍakapattako;Acīvaraṃ tadubhayaṃ, yācitenapi ye tayo.

By the Sangha without a preceptor, the group, the eunuch, the bowl; without robes, those two, and those three who begged.

Hatthā pādā hatthapādā, kaṇṇā nāsā tadūbhayaṃ;Aṅguliaḷakaṇḍaraṃ, phaṇaṃ khujjañca vāmanaṃ.

Hands, feet, hands and feet, ears, noses, and both; fingers, teeth, the neck, the crest, the hunchback, and the dwarf.

Galagaṇḍī lakkhaṇā ceva, kasā likhitasīpadī;Pāpaparisadūsī ca, kāṇaṃ kuṇi tatheva ca.

The goiter, and the marks, the whip-scarred, the elephant-footed; and the defiler of the evil assembly, the one-eyed, the crippled, and likewise.

Khañjaṃ pakkhahatañceva, sacchinnairiyāpathaṃ;Jarāndhamūgabadhiraṃ, andhamūgañca yaṃ tahiṃ.

The lame, and the one with a paralyzed side, the one with impaired movement; the aged, the blind, the mute, the deaf, and the blind and mute, which is there.

Andhabadhiraṃ yaṃ vuttaṃ, mūgabadhirameva ca;Andhamūgabadhirañca, alajjīnañca nissayaṃ.

The blind and deaf, as was said, and the mute and deaf as well; and the blind, mute, and deaf, and the dependence on the shameless.

Vatthabbañca tathāddhānaṃ, yācamānena lakkhaṇā [pekkhanā (sabbattha)];Āgacchatu vivadanti, ekupajjhāyena kassapo.

And what should be dwelt upon, likewise the duration; the marks being requested, let him come, they dispute, Kassapa with one preceptor.

Dissanti upasampannā, ābādhehi ca pīḷitā;Ananusiṭṭhā vitthenti, tattheva anusāsanā.

They are seen, fully ordained, and afflicted by illnesses; uninstructed, they wander; and there is instruction.

Saṅghepi ca atho bālā, asammatā ca ekato;Ullumpatupasampadā, nissayo ekako tayoti.

And in the Sangha too, then, fools, and those not agreed upon, and alone; lifting up, full ordination, dependence, one, three.

Imamhi khandhake vatthūni ekasatañca dvāsattati.

In this Khandhaka, there are one hundred and seventy-two topics.

Mahākhandhako niṭṭhito.

The Mahākhandhaka is concluded.
