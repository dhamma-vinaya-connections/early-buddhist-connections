How, monks, can those foolish men, while bathing, rub their bodies against trees—their thighs, arms, chests, and backs? This is not for the confidence of those who are not confident, nor for the increase of confidence in those who are confident, but rather it is for the lack of confidence of those who are not confident, and for some of those who are confident to change their minds."

People complained, grumbled, and criticized, saying: “How can these Sakyan recluses go to see dancing, singing, and instrumental music, just like householders enjoying sensual enjoyments!” They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, one should not go to see dancing, singing, or instrumental music. Whoever does so commits a dukkaṭa offense.”

249.At that time the group of six monks were chanting the Dhamma with drawn-out musical tones. People complained, grumbled, and criticized, saying: “Just like we sing, these Sakyan recluses chant the Dhamma with drawn-out musical tones!” The monks heard those people complaining, grumbling, and criticizing. Those monks who were modest… complained, grumbled, and criticized, saying: “How could the group of six monks chant the Dhamma with drawn-out musical tones?” Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Is it true, monks, that…?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One then gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, there are these five drawbacks for one who chants the Dhamma with drawn-out musical tones. One becomes attached to that sound; others become attached to that sound; householders complain; it obstructs the concentration of one who is seeking vocal perfection; and later generations imitate the practice. These, monks, are the five drawbacks for one who chants the Dhamma with drawn-out musical tones. Monks, the Dhamma should not be chanted with drawn-out musical tones. Whoever does so commits a dukkaṭa offense.”

At that time, the monks were scrupulous about melodious recitation. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow melodious recitation.”

At that time, the group of six monks wore a woollen garment with the nap facing outwards. People complained, grumbled, and criticized, saying: “Just like householders enjoying sensual enjoyments!” They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, a woollen garment with the nap facing outwards should not be worn. Whoever does so commits a dukkaṭa offense.”

250.Now at that time, in the park of King Seniya Bimbisāra the Magadhan, the mango trees were bearing fruit. King Seniya Bimbisāra the Magadhan had given permission: “Venerables, enjoy the mangoes as you please.” The group of six monks had unripe mangoes picked and ate them. Now King Seniya Bimbisāra the Magadhan had need of mangoes. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra the Magadhan ordered his menfolk: “Go, sirs, go to the park and fetch mangoes.” “Yes, Your Majesty,” those menfolk replied to King Seniya Bimbisāra the Magadhan. They went to the park and said to the park-keeper, “Sirs, the king has need of mangoes. Give us mangoes.” “There are no mangoes, sirs. The monks had unripe mangoes picked and ate them.” Then those menfolk reported the matter to King Seniya Bimbisāra the Magadhan. “Well, the Venerables have thoroughly eaten the mangoes, but the Blessed One has praised moderation.” The people complained, grumbled, and criticized, saying: “How can these Sakyan recluses eat the king’s mangoes without knowing moderation?” The monks heard those people complaining, grumbling, and criticizing. Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, mangoes should not be eaten. Whoever eats them commits a dukkaṭa offense.”

At that time, a certain association had a Sangha-meal. They did not manage to prepare mango-slices, so they gave whole mangoes in the alms-hall. The monks, being scrupulous, did not accept them. “Accept them, monks, and eat them. Monks, I allow the consumption of fruit in five ways suitable for recluses: that which has been scorched by fire, that which has been cut by a knife, that which has been scraped by a nail, that which is seedless, and fifth, that from which the seeds have been removed. Monks, I allow the consumption of fruit in these five ways suitable for recluses.”

251.Now at that time a certain monk, bitten by a snake, had died. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Surely, monks, that monk did not pervade these four royal families of snakes with a mind of loving-kindness. For if that monk had pervaded these four royal families of snakes with a mind of loving-kindness, that monk would not have died from a snakebite. Which are the four royal families of snakes? The royal family of snakes Virūpakkha, the royal family of snakes Erāpatha, the royal family of snakes Chabyāputta, the royal family of snakes Kaṇhāgotama. Surely, monks, that monk did not pervade these four royal families of snakes with a mind of loving-kindness. For if that monk had pervaded these four royal families of snakes with a mind of loving-kindness, that monk would not have died from a snakebite. Monks, I allow the pervading of these four royal families of snakes with a mind of loving-kindness, for self-protection, for self-defense, and for one’s own safeguard. And this is how it should be done, monks:

[jā. 1.2.105-106; a. ni. 4.67 idaṃ vatthu āgataṃ] ‘‘Virūpakkhehi me mettaṃ, mettaṃ erāpathehi me;Chabyāputtehi me mettaṃ, mettaṃ kaṇhāgotamakehi ca.

“May I have loving-kindness towards the Virūpakkhas, may I have loving-kindness towards the Erāpathas; may I have loving-kindness towards the Chabyāputtas, and may I have loving-kindness towards the Kaṇhāgotamakas.”

‘‘Apādakehi me mettaṃ, mettaṃ dvipādakehi me;Catuppadehi me mettaṃ, mettaṃ bahuppadehi me.

“May I have loving-kindness towards the footless, may I have loving-kindness towards the two-footed; may I have loving-kindness towards the four-footed, may I have loving-kindness towards the many-footed.”

‘‘Mā maṃ apādako hiṃsi, mā maṃ hiṃsi dvipādako;Mā maṃ catuppado hiṃsi, mā maṃ hiṃsi bahuppado.

“May the footless not harm me, may the two-footed not harm me; may the four-footed not harm me, may the many-footed not harm me.”

‘‘Sabbe sattā sabbe pāṇā, sabbe bhūtā ca kevalā;Sabbe bhadrāni passantu, mā kiñci pāpamāgamā.

“May all beings, all breathing things, all creatures without exception, may they all see good fortune; may no evil come to them.”

‘‘Appamāṇo buddho, appamāṇo dhammo,Appamāṇo saṅgho, pamāṇavantāni sarīsapāni [siriṃsapāni (sī. syā.)].

“Boundless is the Buddha, boundless is the Dhamma, boundless is the Sangha. Limited are creeping things.”

‘‘Ahi vicchikā satapadī, uṇṇanābhi sarabū mūsikā;Katā me rakkhā kataṃ me parittaṃ, paṭikkamantu bhūtāni.

“Snake, scorpion, centipede, spider, lizard, mouse; I have made protection, I have made a safeguard; may the beings depart.”

‘‘Sohaṃ namo bhagavato, namo sattannaṃ sammāsambuddhāna’’nti.

“I pay homage to the Blessed One, homage to the seven Perfectly Self-Enlightened Ones.”

At that time, a certain monk, afflicted by discontent, cut off his own genitals. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “That foolish man, monks, was to cut off one thing, but he cut off another. Monks, one should not cut off one’s own genitals. Whoever does so, commits an offense entailing a serious penalty.”

252.Now at that time, a precious sandalwood knot had appeared to the chief merchant of Rājagaha. Then the chief merchant of Rājagaha thought: “Why don’t I have a bowl carved from this sandalwood knot? The carving will be for my use, and I will give the bowl as a gift.” Then the chief merchant of Rājagaha had a bowl carved from that sandalwood knot, tied it with a string-net, hung it on a bamboo pole, and fastened it to a row of bamboos, saying: “Let any ascetic or brahmin who is an arahant and possesses psychic powers take the bowl that has been given.” Then Pūraṇa Kassapa approached the chief merchant of Rājagaha and said to him: “I, householder, am an arahant and possess psychic powers. Give me the bowl.” “If, venerable sir, you are an arahant and possess psychic powers, then take the bowl that has been given.” Then Makkhali Gosāla… Ajita Kesakambala… Pakudha Kaccāyana… Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta… Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta approached the chief merchant of Rājagaha and said to him: “I, householder, am an arahant and possess psychic powers. Give me the bowl.” “If, venerable sir, you are an arahant and possess psychic powers, then take the bowl that has been given.”

At that time, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and the Venerable Piṇḍolabhāradvāja, having dressed in the morning and taken their bowls and robes, entered Rājagaha for alms. Then the Venerable Piṇḍolabhāradvāja said to the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna: “Venerable Mahāmoggallāna is both an arahant and possesses psychic powers. Come, friend Moggallāna, take this bowl. This bowl is yours.” “Venerable Bhāradvāja is both an arahant and possesses psychic powers. Come, friend Bhāradvāja, take this bowl. This bowl is yours.” Then the Venerable Piṇḍolabhāradvāja rose into the air, took the bowl, and circled Rājagaha three times.

At that time, the chief merchant of Rājagaha, together with his wife and children, stood in his own house with hands reverently joined, paying homage, saying: “Venerable Bhāradvāja, may the noble one stay right here in our house.” Then Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja stayed in the chief merchant’s house. Then the chief merchant of Rājagaha took the bowl from Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja’s hand, filled it with expensive food, and gave it to Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja. Then Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja took the bowl and went to the monastery. People heard: “It seems the bowl of the chief merchant of Rājagaha was taken down by Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja.” And those people, with loud and great shouts, followed Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja closely behind.

The Blessed One heard a loud and great noise. Having heard it, he addressed Venerable Ānanda: “What, Ānanda, is that loud and great noise?” “Venerable sir, Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja has brought down the bowl belonging to the chief merchant of Rājagaha. People heard, venerable sir, that Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja had brought down the bowl belonging to the chief merchant of Rājagaha. Those people, venerable sir, are making a loud and great noise, following Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja from behind. That, venerable sir, is the loud and great noise.” Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, in this matter, had the Sangha of monks assembled and questioned Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja: “Is it true, Bhāradvāja, that you brought down the bowl belonging to the chief merchant of Rājagaha?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked him: “It is improper, Bhāradvāja, unsuitable, unbecoming, unworthy of an ascetic, not allowable, not to be done. How could you, Bhāradvāja, for the sake of a worthless wooden bowl, display a superhuman state, a wonder of psychic power to householders! Just as, Bhāradvāja, a woman might expose her private parts for the sake of a worthless piece of copper money, so too, Bhāradvāja, you have displayed a superhuman state, a wonder of psychic power to householders for the sake of a worthless wooden bowl. This, Bhāradvāja, does not lead to faith in those without it… Having rebuked him… he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, one should not display a superhuman state, a wonder of psychic power to householders. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong conduct. Break this wooden bowl, monks, into small pieces, and give them to the monks for use as ointment applicators. And monks, a wooden bowl should not be kept. Whoever keeps one commits an offense of wrong conduct.”

At that time the monks of the group of six kept bowls of various kinds—golden, silver. People complained, criticized, and spoke disparagingly: “Just like householders enjoying sensual pleasures.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, a golden bowl should not be kept… a silver bowl should not be kept… a jeweled bowl should not be kept… a beryl bowl should not be kept… a crystal bowl should not be kept… a bronze bowl should not be kept… a glass bowl should not be kept… a tin bowl should not be kept… a lead bowl should not be kept… a copper bowl should not be kept.

At that time, the monks of the group of six kept various kinds of bowl stands—some made of gold, some made of silver. People complained, criticized, and spoke disparagingly, saying, “They are just like householders indulging in sensual pleasures.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, various kinds of bowl stands should not be kept. Whoever keeps one commits an offense of wrong conduct. I allow, monks, two kinds of bowl stands—those made of tin and those made of lead.” The thick stands were not pierced.

At that time, a certain monk, having tied his sandals with a waistband, entered a village for alms. A lay follower, while paying respects to that monk, touched the sandals with his head. The monk felt ashamed. Then that monk went to the monastery and reported this matter to the monks. The monks reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, a sandal bag." There was no shoulder-strap... "I allow, monks, a shoulder-strap with a tying string."

259.At that time, two monks were traveling on a road in the Kosala country. One monk behaved improperly. The second monk said to him, "Friend, do not act like this. It is not proper." The first monk became resentful. Then that monk, afflicted by thirst, said to the resentful monk, "Friend, give me the water-strainer; I will drink water." The resentful monk did not give it. The other monk, afflicted by thirst, died. Then that monk went to the monastery and informed the monks of the matter. "But why, friend, when asked for the water-strainer, did you not give it?" "Yes, friend," he replied. Those monks who were modest... criticized and complained, "How could a monk not give the water-strainer when asked for it!" They reported the matter to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, having assembled the Sangha, questioned that monk: "Is it true, monk, that when asked for the water-strainer, you did not give it?" "It is true, Blessed One." The Buddha rebuked him: "Foolish man, this is improper, unsuitable, unbecoming, unworthy of an ascetic, not allowable, and should not be done. How could you, foolish man, not give the water-strainer when asked for it! This does not inspire confidence in the unconverted..." After rebuking him... the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: "Monks, a monk traveling on a road should not refuse to give the water-strainer when asked for it. Whoever does not give it commits an offense of wrongdoing. And monks, one should not travel without a water-strainer. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrongdoing. If there is no water-strainer or a water filter, even the corner of the outer robe should be designated: 'I will strain with this and drink.'" Then the Blessed One, traveling gradually, arrived at Vesālī. There he stayed in the Great Wood, in the Hall with the Peaked Roof. At that time, monks were doing construction work. The water-strainer was not suitable. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, a stick-strainer." The stick-strainer was not suitable. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, a water-collecting spread."

260.Now at that time in Vesālī there was a regular distribution of excellent food. The monks, having eaten excellent foods, became corpulent and afflicted with many ailments. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca went to Vesālī on some business. Jīvaka Komārabhacca saw the monks corpulent and afflicted with many ailments. Having seen this, he approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, Jīvaka Komārabhacca said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, the monks are now corpulent and afflicted with many ailments. It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would allow the monks walking meditation and a hot-house. Thus the monks would be free from ailments." Then the Blessed One instructed, roused, inspired, and gladdened Jīvaka Komārabhacca with a Dhamma talk. Having been instructed, roused, inspired, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk, Jīvaka Komārabhacca rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, in this connection, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: "Monks, I allow walking meditation and a hot-house."

At that time, monks were walking on uneven walking paths. Their feet hurt. They informed the Blessed One of this matter. "I allow, monks, making them level." The walking path was low-lying. It was flooded with water… "I allow, monks, raising it." The mound collapsed… "I allow, monks, building three kinds of mounds—a brick mound, a stone mound, a wood mound." Those ascending were troubled… "I allow, monks, three kinds of staircases—a brick staircase, a stone staircase, a wood staircase." Those ascending fell… "I allow, monks, a railing."

At that time, monks walking back and forth in the open air were exhausted by both cold and heat. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, a walking-meditation hall." In the walking-meditation hall, grass and dust fell around... "I allow, monks, to plaster it inside and out after interweaving (reeds or branches)—whitewashing, blackening, red-ochre work, garland designs, creeper designs, makara-tooth designs, five-layered borders, a robe-support, and a robe-line." The hot-room was low-lying, and got flooded with water... "I allow, monks, to raise its foundation." The mound collapsed... "I allow, monks, to build three types of mounds—a brick mound, a stone mound, and a wood mound." Those climbing up were troubled... "I allow, monks, three types of stairways—brick stairways, stone stairways, and wood stairways." Those climbing up fell... "I allow, monks, a handrail." The hot-room had no door... "I allow, monks, a door, a double door, a door-socket, an upper crossbar, a latch pin, a bolt-head, a pin, a latch, a keyhole, a pull-cord hole, and a pull-cord." The hot-room’s wall base deteriorated... "I allow, monks, to make a molding." The hot-room had no smoke hole... "I allow, monks, a smoke hole."

At that time, the monks were making the fireplace in the middle of a small sauna. There was no room to move around. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, in a small sauna, to make the fireplace to one side; in a large one, in the middle." The fire in the sauna burns the face… "I allow, monks, a clay covering." They moisten clay in their hands… "I allow, monks, a clay trough." The clay becomes foul-smelling… "I allow, monks, to scent it." The fire in the sauna burns the body… "I allow, monks, to pour water." They pour water in bowls and almsbowls… "I allow, monks, a water container and a water scoop." The thatched roof of the sauna does not steam well… "I allow, monks, to plaster it inside and out after reinforcing it with a framework." The sauna floor becomes muddy… "I allow, monks, to spread three kinds of flooring—brick flooring, stone flooring, wood flooring." It remains muddy… "I allow, monks, to wash it."

At that time, monks were sitting on the bare ground in the hot-air bath, scratching their limbs. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, a hot-air bath bench." At that time, the hot-air bath was unenclosed… "I allow, monks, to enclose it with three kinds of walls—a brick wall, a stone wall, a wooden wall." There was no antechamber… "I allow, monks, an antechamber." The antechamber had a low floor and was flooded with water… "I allow, monks, to make a high floor."

Udakaṃ santiṭṭhati…pe… ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, udakaniddhamana’’nti.

At that time, monks were bathing here and there in the monastery. The monastery became muddy. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, a bathing-place." The bathing-place was exposed. The monks were embarrassed to bathe… "I allow, monks, to enclose it with three kinds of enclosures: a brick enclosure, a stone enclosure, a wooden enclosure." The bathing-place became muddy… "I allow, monks, to spread three kinds of flooring: brick flooring, stone flooring, wooden flooring." The water stood still… "I allow, monks, a water drain."

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhūnaṃ gattāni sītigatāni honti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, udakapuñchaniṃ coḷakenapi paccuddharitu’’nti.

At that time the monks' bodies were cold. They reported this matter to the Blessed One … "I allow, monks, a water-wiper, and to wipe off water even with a rag."

263. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro upāsako saṅghassa atthāya pokkharaṇiṃ kāretukāmo hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, pokkharaṇi’’nti.

Pokkharaṇiyā udakaṃ purāṇaṃ hoti…pe… ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, udakamātikaṃ udakaniddhamana’’nti.

263.At that time, a certain lay follower wanted to have a pond constructed for the Sangha. They reported this matter to the Blessed One… "I allow, monks, a pond." The bank of the pond crumbled… "I allow, monks, to build three kinds of embankments: a brick embankment, a stone embankment, a wooden embankment." Those ascending were distressed… "I allow, monks, three kinds of steps: brick steps, stone steps, wooden steps." Those ascending fell… "I allow, monks, a handrail." The water in the pond became stale… "I allow, monks, a water inlet and a water outlet."

Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu saṅghassa atthāya nillekhaṃ jantāgharaṃ kattukāmo hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, nillekhaṃ jantāghara’’nti.

At that time, a certain monk wanted to build a sweat lodge without plaster for the Sangha. They reported this matter to the Blessed One... "I allow, monks, a sweat lodge without plaster."

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū cātumāsaṃ nisīdanena vippavasanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘na, bhikkhave, cātumāsaṃ nisīdanena vippavasitabbaṃ. Yo vippavaseyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

At that time the monks of the group of six were separated (from their residence) for four months by using a sitting cloth. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, one should not be separated (from one's residence) for four months by means of a sitting cloth. Whoever does so incurs an offense of wrong conduct."

264. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū pupphābhikiṇṇesu sayanesu sayanti. Manussā vihāracārikaṃ āhiṇḍantā passitvā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – seyyathāpi gihī kāmabhoginoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, pupphābhikiṇṇesu sayanesu sayitabbaṃ. Yo sayeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

264.At that time the group-of-six monks were sleeping on beds strewn with flowers. People wandering on monastery rounds saw them and complained, criticized, and denounced them: “Just like householders enjoying sensual pleasures!” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, beds strewn with flowers should not be slept on. Whoever does so incurs an offense of wrong conduct.”

Tena kho pana samayena manussā gandhampi mālampi ādāya ārāmaṃ āgacchanti. Bhikkhū kukkuccāyantā na paṭiggaṇhanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, gandhaṃ gahetvā kavāṭe pañcaṅgulikaṃ dātuṃ, pupphaṃ gahetvā vihāre ekamantaṃ nikkhipitu’’nti.

At that time, people came to the monastery bringing perfumes and garlands. The monks, being scrupulous, did not accept them. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, to take the perfume and apply a five-finger mark on the door, and to take the flowers and place them aside in the monastery."

Tena kho pana samayena saṅghassa namatakaṃ uppannaṃ hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, namataka’’nti. Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘namatakaṃ adhiṭṭhātabbaṃ nu kho udāhu vikappetabba’’nti…pe… ‘‘na, bhikkhave, namatakaṃ adhiṭṭhātabbaṃ, na vikappetabba’’nti.

At that time, a namataka arose for the Sangha. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, a namataka." Then the monks thought, "Should the namataka be designated or allocated?"… "Monks, the namataka should neither be designated nor allocated."

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū āsittakūpadhāne bhuñjanti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – seyyathāpi gihī kāmabhoginoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘na, bhikkhave, āsittakūpadhāne bhuñjitabbaṃ. Yo bhuñjeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

At that time, the monks of the group of six were eating while reclining on armrests. People complained, criticized, and spread it about: "Just like householders indulging in sensual pleasures!" They reported this matter to the Blessed One… "Monks, one should not eat while reclining on armrests. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong conduct."

Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu gilāno hoti. So bhuñjamāno na sakkoti hatthena pattaṃ sandhāretuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, maḷorika’’nti.

At that time, a certain monk was ill. While eating, he was unable to hold his bowl steady with his hand. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, a stand (for the bowl)."

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū ekabhājanepi bhuñjanti…pe… ekathālakepi pivanti, ekamañcepi tuvaṭṭenti, ekattharaṇāpi tuvaṭṭenti, ekapāvuraṇāpi tuvaṭṭenti, ekattharaṇapāvuraṇāpi tuvaṭṭenti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – seyyathāpi gihī kāmabhoginoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, ekabhājane bhuñjitabbaṃ…pe… na ekathālake pātabbaṃ… na ekamañce tuvaṭṭitabbaṃ… na ekattharaṇā [na ekattharaṇe] tuvaṭṭitabbaṃ… na ekapāvuraṇā [na ekapāvuraṇe] tuvaṭṭitabbaṃ… na ekattharaṇapāvuraṇā [na ekattharaṇapāvuraṇe (syā.)] tuvaṭṭitabbaṃ. Yo tuvaṭṭeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

At that time the monks of the group of six were eating from a single bowl… drinking from a single dish, lying down together on a single bed, lying down together on a single spread, lying down together under a single blanket, lying down together under a single spread and blanket. People complained, criticized, and spread it about: "Just like householders indulging in sensual pleasures!" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, one should not eat from a single bowl… one should not drink from a single dish… one should not lie down together on a single bed… one should not lie down together on a single spread… one should not lie down together under a single blanket… one should not lie down together under a single spread and blanket. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong conduct."

265.Now at that time, the Licchavi Vaḍḍha was a friend of the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka. Then Vaḍḍha the Licchavi approached the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka, and having approached, he said to them: "I pay homage to the venerable ones." When this was said, the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka did not respond. A second time, Vaḍḍha the Licchavi said to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka: "I pay homage to the venerable ones." A second time, the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka did not respond. A third time, Vaḍḍha the Licchavi said to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka: "I pay homage to the venerable ones." A third time, the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka did not respond. "Have I wronged the venerable ones in some way? Why do the venerable ones not respond to me?" "Because, friend Vaḍḍha, while we are being harassed by Dabba the Mallian, you remain apathetic." "What can I do for the venerable ones?" "If you wished, friend Vaḍḍha, you could have the Blessed One get rid of Venerable Dabba the Mallian today." "What can I do? What is within my power to do?" "Come, friend Vaḍḍha, approach the Blessed One and say this to him: 'This, venerable sir, is unseemly and improper. That direction, venerable sir, which was safe, peaceful and without trouble has now become dangerous, troubled, and full of misfortune; where there was shelter from the wind, now there is wind; the water seems to be ablaze; Pajāpati has been seduced by my Venerable Dabba the Mallian.'" "Very well, venerable ones," replied Vaḍḍha the Licchavi to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka. Then he approached the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, sat down to one side. Seated to one side, Vaḍḍha the Licchavi said to the Blessed One: "This, venerable sir, is unseemly and improper. That direction, venerable sir, which was safe, peaceful and without trouble has now become dangerous, troubled, and full of misfortune; where there was shelter from the wind, now there is wind; the water seems to be ablaze; Pajāpati has been seduced by my Venerable Dabba the Mallian."

Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā āyasmantaṃ dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ paṭipucchi – ‘‘sarasi tvaṃ, dabba, evarūpaṃ kattā yathāyaṃ vaḍḍho āhā’’ti? ‘‘Yathā maṃ, bhante, bhagavā jānātī’’ti. Dutiyampi kho bhagavā…pe… tatiyampi kho bhagavā āyasmantaṃ dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sarasi tvaṃ, dabba, evarūpaṃ kattā yathāyaṃ vaḍḍho āhā’’ti? ‘‘Yathā maṃ, bhante, bhagavā jānātī’’ti. ‘‘Na kho, dabba, dabbā evaṃ nibbeṭhenti.

Atha kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘tena hi, bhikkhave, saṅgho vaḍḍhassa licchavissa pattaṃ nikkujjatu, asambhogaṃ saṅghena karotu.

Then the Blessed One, on this occasion and in connection with this matter, convened the Sangha of bhikkhus and questioned Venerable Dabba the Mallian: “Dabba, do you remember doing such a thing as this Vaḍḍha alleges?” “As the Blessed One knows me, venerable sir.” A second time, the Blessed One… A third time, the Blessed One said to Venerable Dabba the Mallian: “Dabba, do you remember doing such a thing as this Vaḍḍha alleges?” “As the Blessed One knows me, venerable sir.” “Dabba, Dabbas do not prevaricate in this way. If you did it, say ‘I did it’; if you did not do it, say ‘I did not do it.’” “Venerable sir, since I was born, I do not recall ever engaging in sexual activity, even in a dream, let alone while awake.” Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Therefore, bhikkhus, let the Sangha overturn the bowl of Vaḍḍha the Licchavi, and let him be without association with the Sangha.

‘‘Aṭṭhahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgatassa upāsakassa patto nikkujjitabbo – bhikkhūnaṃ alābhāya parisakkati, bhikkhūnaṃ anatthāya parisakkati, bhikkhūnaṃ avāsāya [anāvāsāya (syā.)] parisakkati, bhikkhū akkosati paribhāsati, bhikkhū bhikkhūhi bhedeti, buddhassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati, dhammassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati, saṅghassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati.

Bhikkhus, the bowl of a lay follower endowed with eight factors should be overturned: he strives for the bhikkhus' loss, he strives for the bhikkhus' harm, he strives for the bhikkhus' non-residence, he abuses and reviles the bhikkhus, he causes division among bhikkhus, he speaks dispraise of the Buddha, he speaks dispraise of the Dhamma, he speaks dispraise of the Sangha. Bhikkhus, I allow the overturning of the bowl for a lay follower endowed with these eight factors. And this is how, bhikkhus, it should be overturned: A competent and capable bhikkhu should inform the Sangha:

266. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Vaḍḍho licchavī āyasmantaṃ dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ amūlikāya sīlavipattiyā anuddhaṃseti. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho vaḍḍhassa licchavissa pattaṃ nikkujjeyya, asambhogaṃ saṅghena kareyya. Esā ñatti.

266.“Venerable sirs, let the Sangha hear me. Vaḍḍha the Licchavi groundlessly accuses Venerable Dabba the Mallian of failure in virtue. If it is agreeable to the Sangha, the Sangha should overturn the bowl of Vaḍḍha the Licchavi and make him without association with the Sangha. This is the announcement.”

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Vaḍḍho licchavī āyasmantaṃ dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ amūlikāya sīlavipattiyā anuddhaṃseti. Saṅgho vaḍḍhassa licchavissa pattaṃ nikkujjati, asambhogaṃ saṅghena karoti. Yassāyasmato khamati vaḍḍhassa licchavissa pattassa nikkujjanā, asambhogaṃ saṅghena karaṇaṃ, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“Venerable sirs, let the Sangha hear me. Vaḍḍha the Licchavi groundlessly accuses Venerable Dabba the Mallian of failure in virtue. The Sangha overturns the bowl of Vaḍḍha the Licchavi and makes him without association with the Sangha. Whoever agrees with the overturning of Vaḍḍha the Licchavi's bowl and his being without association with the Sangha, let him remain silent; whoever disagrees, let him speak.”

‘‘Nikkujjito saṅghena vaḍḍhassa licchavissa patto, asambhogo saṅghena. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

“The Sangha has overturned the bowl of Vaḍḍha the Licchavi and made him without association with the Sangha. The Sangha is agreeable, therefore it is silent. Thus I take it.”

Atha kho āyasmā ānando pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena vaḍḍhassa licchavissa nivesanaṃ tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā vaḍḍhaṃ licchaviṃ etadavoca – ‘‘saṅghena te, āvuso vaḍḍha, patto nikkujjito.

Then, in the forenoon, Venerable Ānanda, having put on his lower robe and taken his bowl and outer robe, approached the dwelling of Vaḍḍha the Licchavi. Having approached, he said to Vaḍḍha the Licchavi: “Friend Vaḍḍha, the Sangha has overturned your bowl. You are without association with the Sangha.” Then Vaḍḍha the Licchavi—thinking, “The Sangha has overturned my bowl, I am without association with the Sangha”—fainted and fell down right there. Then the friends, ministers, relatives, and blood relatives of Vaḍḍha the Licchavi said to him: “Enough, friend Vaḍḍha, do not grieve, do not lament. We will appease the Blessed One and the Sangha of bhikkhus.”

Atha kho vaḍḍho licchavī saputtadāro samittāmacco sañātisālohito allavattho allakeso yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavato pādesu sirasā nipatitvā bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘accayo maṃ, bhante, accagamā yathābālaṃ yathāmūḷhaṃ yathāakusalaṃ, yohaṃ ayyaṃ dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ amūlikāya sīlavipattiyā anuddhaṃsesiṃ.

Then Vaḍḍha the Licchavi, with his children and wives, with his friends and ministers, with his relatives and blood relatives, with wet clothes and wet hair, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he fell with his head at the Blessed One’s feet and said to him: “Venerable sir, a transgression has overcome me, as one foolish, deluded, and unskillful, in that I groundlessly accused the venerable Dabba the Mallian of failure in virtue. Venerable sir, may the Blessed One accept my transgression as a transgression for future restraint.” “Indeed, friend Vaḍḍha, a transgression has overcome you, as one foolish, deluded, and unskillful, in that you groundlessly accused Dabba the Mallian of failure in virtue. But since you, friend Vaḍḍha, having seen your transgression as a transgression, make amends according to the Dhamma, we accept it from you. For this is growth, friend Vaḍḍha, in the Noble One's Discipline: that one sees one's transgression as a transgression, makes amends according to the Dhamma, and undertakes future restraint.” Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Well then, bhikkhus, let the Sangha turn Vaḍḍha the Licchavi’s bowl upright and make him with association with the Sangha.

‘‘Aṭṭhahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgatassa upāsakassa patto ukkujjitabbo – na bhikkhūnaṃ alābhāya parisakkati, na bhikkhūnaṃ anatthāya parisakkati, na bhikkhūnaṃ avāsāya parisakkati, na bhikkhū akkosati paribhāsati, na bhikkhū bhikkhūhi bhedeti, na buddhassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati, na dhammassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati, na saṅghassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati.

Bhikkhus, I allow the turning upright of the bowl for a lay follower endowed with these eight factors. And this is how, bhikkhus, it should be turned upright. That lay follower, bhikkhus, should approach the Sangha, arrange his outer robe over one shoulder, pay homage at the feet of the bhikkhus, sit on his haunches, raise his joined hands, and should say this: ‘Venerable sirs, the Sangha has overturned my bowl; I am without association with the Sangha. I am conducting myself properly, I am making amends, I am acting for release. I ask the Sangha for the turning upright of the bowl.’ He should ask a second time. He should ask a third time. A competent and capable bhikkhu should then inform the Sangha:

268. Atha kho bhagavā vesāliyaṃ yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena bhaggā tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena bhaggā tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā bhaggesu viharati susumāragire [suṃsumāragire (sī. syā.), saṃsumāragire (ka.)] bhesakaḷāvane migadāye.

Evañca vadehi – ‘adhivāsetu kira, bhante, bhagavā bodhissa rājakumārassa svātanāya bhattaṃ saddhiṃ bhikkhusaṅghenā’’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ bho’’ti kho sañcikāputto māṇavo bodhissa rājakumārassa paṭissutvā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavatā saddhiṃ sammodi, sammodanīyaṃ kathaṃ sāraṇīyaṃ vītisāretvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho sañcikāputto māṇavo bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘bodhi kho rājakumāro bhoto gotamassa pāde sirasā vandati, appābādhaṃ appātaṅkaṃ lahuṭṭhānaṃ balaṃ phāsuvihāraṃ pucchati.

Evañca vadeti – adhivāsetu kira bhavaṃ gotamo bodhissa rājakumārassa svātanāya bhattaṃ saddhiṃ bhikkhusaṅghenā’ti. Adhivutthañca pana samaṇena gotamenā’’ti.

268.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Vesālī as long as he pleased, set out on a journey towards the Bhaggas. Traveling in stages, he arrived at the Bhaggas. There the Blessed One stayed among the Bhaggas at Suṃsumāragira in the Bhesakaḷā Forest, a deer park. At that time, Prince Bodhi had recently built a palace named Kokanada, which had not yet been occupied by any ascetic, brahmin, or any human being. Then Prince Bodhi addressed the brahmin Sañjikāputta: "Come, dear Sañjikāputta, go to the Blessed One, approach him, and in my name bow your head to his feet. Inquire whether he is free from illness and affliction, light in body, strong, and living comfortably. Say this: 'Prince Bodhi, venerable sir, bows his head at the Blessed One’s feet and inquires whether he is free from illness and affliction, light in body, strong, and living comfortably.' And say this: 'May the Blessed One, venerable sir, accept tomorrow’s meal from Prince Bodhi together with the Sangha of bhikkhus.'" "Yes, venerable sir," replied the brahmin Sañjikāputta to Prince Bodhi. He then went to the Blessed One, approached him, exchanged greetings and courteous conversation, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the brahmin Sañjikāputta said to the Blessed One: "Prince Bodhi, venerable Gotama, bows his head at the Blessed One’s feet and inquires whether he is free from illness and affliction, light in body, strong, and living comfortably. And he says this: 'May venerable Gotama accept tomorrow’s meal from Prince Bodhi together with the Sangha of bhikkhus.'" The Blessed One consented in silence. Then the brahmin Sañjikāputta, knowing the Blessed One’s consent, rose from his seat, went to Prince Bodhi, and said: "We have conveyed your message to venerable Gotama, saying: 'Prince Bodhi, venerable Gotama, bows his head at the Blessed One’s feet and inquires whether he is free from illness and affliction, light in body, strong, and living comfortably. And he says this: May venerable Gotama accept tomorrow’s meal from Prince Bodhi together with the Sangha of bhikkhus.' And the ascetic Gotama has consented."

Atha kho bodhi rājakumāro tassā rattiyā accayena paṇītaṃ khādanīyaṃ bhojanīyaṃ paṭiyādāpetvā, kokanadañca pāsādaṃ odātehi dussehi santharāpetvā yāva pacchimasopānakaḷevarā, sañcikāputtaṃ māṇavaṃ āmantesi – ‘‘ehi tvaṃ, samma sañcikāputta, yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkama, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavato kālaṃ ārocehi – ‘kālo, bhante niṭṭhitaṃ bhatta’’’nti. ‘‘Evaṃ bho’’ti kho sañcikāputto māṇavo bodhissa rājakumārassa paṭissutvā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavato kālaṃ ārocesi – ‘‘kālo, bho gotama, niṭṭhitaṃ bhatta’’nti.

Then Prince Bodhi, after the night had passed, had fine hard and soft foods prepared, and had the Kokanada Palace spread with white cloths up to the last step of the stairs. He addressed the brahmin Sañjikāputta: "Come, dear Sañjikāputta, go to the Blessed One, and announce the time to the Blessed One upon arrival: 'It is time, venerable sir, the meal is prepared.'" "Yes, venerable sir," replied the brahmin Sañjikāputta to Prince Bodhi. He then went to the Blessed One, and announced the time upon arrival: "It is time, venerable Gotama, the meal is prepared."

Atha kho bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena bodhissa rājakumārassa nivesanaṃ tenupasaṅkami. Tena kho pana samayena bodhi rājakumāro bahidvārakoṭṭhake ṭhito hoti, bhagavantaṃ āgamayamāno. Addasā kho bodhi rājakumāro bhagavantaṃ dūratova āgacchantaṃ. Disvāna tato paccuggantvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā purekkhatvā yena kokanado pāsādo tenupasaṅkami. Atha kho bhagavā pacchimasopānakaḷevaraṃ nissāya aṭṭhāsi. Atha kho bodhi rājakumāro bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘akkamatu, bhante, bhagavā dussāni, akkamatu sugato dussāni, yaṃ mama assa dīgharattaṃ hitāya sukhāyā’’ti. Evaṃ vutte bhagavā tuṇhī ahosi. Dutiyampi kho…pe… tatiyampi kho bodhi rājakumāro bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘akkamatu, bhante, bhagavā dussāni, akkamatu sugato dussāni, yaṃ mama assa dīgharattaṃ hitāya sukhāyā’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ apalokesi. Atha kho āyasmā ānando bodhiṃ rājakumāraṃ etadavoca – ‘‘saṃharantu, rājakumāra, dussāni. Na bhagavā celapaṭikaṃ [celapattikaṃ (sī.)] akkamissati pacchimaṃ janataṃ tathāgato anukampatī’’ti.

Then, in the morning, the Blessed One, having put on his lower robe and taken his bowl and outer robe, went to the dwelling of Prince Bodhi. At that time, Prince Bodhi was standing at the outer gateway, awaiting the Blessed One. Prince Bodhi saw the Blessed One coming from afar. Having seen him, he went forth to meet him, paid homage to him, and then, going ahead, approached the Kokanada Palace. Then the Blessed One stood leaning against the last step of the stairs. Prince Bodhi said to the Blessed One, “Venerable Sir, may the Blessed One step on the cloths, may the Well-gone One step on the cloths, for my long-term welfare and happiness.” When this was said, the Blessed One remained silent. A second time Prince Bodhi said to the Blessed One… A third time Prince Bodhi said to the Blessed One, “Venerable Sir, may the Blessed One step on the cloths, may the Well-gone One step on the cloths, for my long-term welfare and happiness.” Then the Blessed One turned to Venerable Ānanda. Venerable Ānanda then said to Prince Bodhi, “Prince, remove the cloths. The Blessed One will not step on a cloth spread out. The Tathāgata has compassion for later generations.”

Atha kho bodhi rājakumāro dussāni saṃharāpetvā uparikokanade pāsāde āsanaṃ paññapesi. Atha kho bhagavā kokanadaṃ pāsādaṃ abhiruhitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi saddhiṃ bhikkhusaṅghena. Atha kho bodhi rājakumāro buddhappamukhaṃ bhikkhusaṅghaṃ paṇītena khādanīyena bhojanīyena sahatthā santappetvā sampavāretvā, bhagavantaṃ bhuttāviṃ onītapattapāṇiṃ, ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho bodhiṃ rājakumāraṃ bhagavā dhammiyā kathāya sandassetvā samādapetvā samuttejetvā sampahaṃsetvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkāmi. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, celapaṭikā akkamitabbā. Yo akkameyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

Then Prince Bodhi had the cloths removed and a seat prepared in the upper part of the Kokanada Palace. Then the Blessed One ascended the Kokanada Palace and sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of bhikkhus. Then Prince Bodhi personally served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with fine hard and soft foods. When the Blessed One had finished eating and had removed his hand from the bowl, Prince Bodhi sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, and gladdened Prince Bodhi with a Dhamma talk, then rose from his seat and departed. Then, on that occasion, in that connection, having given a Dhamma talk, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, a cloth spread out should not be stepped on. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong-doing."

Tena kho pana samayena aññatarā itthī apagatagabbhā bhikkhū nimantetvā dussaṃ paññapetvā etadavoca – ‘‘akkamatha, bhante, dussa’’nti. Bhikkhū kukkuccāyantā na akkamanti. ‘‘Akkamatha, bhante, dussaṃ maṅgalatthāyā’’ti. Bhikkhū kukkuccāyantā na akkamiṃsu. Atha kho sā itthī ujjhāyati khiyyati vipāceti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma ayyā maṅgalatthāya yāciyamānā celappaṭikaṃ na akkamissantī’’ti! Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū tassā itthiyā ujjhāyantiyā khiyyantiyā vipācentiyā. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Gihī, bhikkhave, maṅgalikā. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, gihīnaṃ maṅgalatthāya yāciyamānena celappaṭikaṃ akkamitu’’nti.

At that time, a certain woman who had miscarried invited the bhikkhus and had a cloth spread out, saying, "Venerable sirs, step on the cloth." The bhikkhus, feeling scrupulous, did not step on it. "Venerable sirs, step on the cloth for a blessing," she said. The bhikkhus, still feeling scrupulous, did not step on it. Then that woman complained, murmured, and criticized, "How can these venerable ones not step on a cloth spread out when requested for a blessing?" The bhikkhus heard her complaining, murmuring, and criticizing. Then those bhikkhus reported the matter to the Blessed One. "Householders, bhikkhus, are fond of auspicious things. I allow, bhikkhus, to step on a cloth spread out when asked by householders for a blessing."

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū dhotapādakaṃ akkamituṃ kukkuccāyanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, dhotapādakaṃ akkamitu’’nti.

At that time, bhikkhus were apprehensive about stepping on a foot-wiping cloth. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, bhikkhus, to step on a foot-wiping cloth."

Dutiyabhāṇavāro niṭṭhito.

269. Atha kho bhagavā bhaggesu yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena sāvatthi tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena sāvatthi tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Atha kho visākhā migāramātā ghaṭakañca katakañca sammajjaniñca ādāya yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnā kho visākhā migāramātā bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘paṭiggaṇhātu me, bhante, bhagavā ghaṭakañca katakañca sammajjaniñca, yaṃ mama assa dīgharattaṃ hitāya sukhāyā’’ti. Paṭiggahesi bhagavā ghaṭakañca sammajjaniñca. Na bhagavā katakaṃ paṭiggahesi. Atha kho bhagavā visākhaṃ migāramātaraṃ dhammiyā kathāya sandassesi samādapesi samuttejesi sampahaṃsesi.

269.Then the Blessed One, having stayed among the Bhaggas as long as he pleased, set out on a journey to Sāvatthī. Traveling in stages, he arrived at Sāvatthī. There the Blessed One stayed in Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Monastery. Then Visākhā, Migāra's mother, took a water dipper, a foot scraper, and a broom, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, Visākhā, Migāra's mother, said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, may the Blessed One accept from me the water dipper, the foot scraper, and the broom, for my long-term welfare and happiness." The Blessed One accepted the water dipper and the broom but did not accept the foot scraper. Then the Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, and gladdened Visākhā, Migāra's mother, with a Dhamma talk. Then Visākhā, Migāra's mother, having been instructed, urged, roused, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk, rose from her seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him and departed.

Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, ghaṭakañca sammajjaniñca. Na, bhikkhave, katakaṃ paribhuñjitabbaṃ. Yo paribhuñjeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, tisso pādaghaṃsaniyo – sakkharaṃ, kathalaṃ, samuddapheṇaka’’nti.

Then the Blessed One, on that occasion, in that connection, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the bhikkhus: "I allow, bhikkhus, the water dipper and the broom. Bhikkhus, the foot scraper should not be used. Whoever uses it commits an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, bhikkhus, three kinds of foot-rubbers: gravel, potsherd, and sea foam."

Atha kho visākhā migāramātā vidhūpanañca tālavaṇṭañca [tālavaṇḍañca (ka.)] ādāya yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnā kho visākhā migāramātā bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘paṭiggaṇhātu me, bhante, bhagavā vidhūpanañca tālavaṇṭañca, yaṃ mama assa dīgharattaṃ hitāya sukhāyā’’ti. Paṭiggahesi bhagavā vidhūpanañca tālavaṇṭañca.

Then Visākhā, Migāra's mother, taking a fan and a palm-leaf fan, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, Visākhā, Migāra's mother, said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, may the Blessed One accept from me the fan and the palm-leaf fan, for my long-term welfare and happiness." The Blessed One accepted the fan and the palm-leaf fan.

Atha kho bhagavā visākhaṃ migāramātaraṃ dhammiyā kathāya sandassesi samādapesi samuttejesi sampahaṃsesi…pe… padakkhiṇaṃ katvā pakkāmi. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, vidhūpanañca tālavaṇṭañcā’’ti.

Then the Blessed One instructed, urged, enlightened, and gladdened Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, with a Dhamma talk… and then departed, having circumambulated her. Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, I allow a fan and a palm-leaf fan.”

Tena kho pana samayena saṅghassa makasabījanī uppannā hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, makasabījani’’nti. Cāmaribījanī uppannā hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, cāmaribījanī dhāretabbā. Yo dhāreyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, tisso bījaniyo – vākamayaṃ, usīramayaṃ, morapiñchamaya’’nti.

At that time, a mosquito-whisk had arisen in the Saṅgha. They informed the Blessed One of this matter. “Bhikkhus, I allow a mosquito-whisk.” A yak-tail whisk had arisen. They informed the Blessed One of this matter. “Bhikkhus, a yak-tail whisk should not be kept. Whoever should keep one commits an offense of wrong-doing. Bhikkhus, I allow three kinds of whisks: those made of bark, those made of usīra-grass, and those made of peacock feathers.”

270. Tena kho pana samayena saṅghassa chattaṃ uppannaṃ hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, chatta’’nti.

270.At that time, an umbrella had arisen in the Saṅgha. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, I allow an umbrella.”

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū chattappaggahitā [chattaṃ paggahetvā (ka.)] āhiṇḍanti. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro upāsako sambahulehi ājīvakasāvakehi saddhiṃ uyyānaṃ agamāsi. Addasāsuṃ kho te ājīvakasāvakā chabbaggiye bhikkhū dūratova chattappaggahite āgacchante. Disvāna taṃ upāsakaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘ete kho, ayyā [ayyo (ka.)], tumhākaṃ bhadantā chattappaggahitā āgacchanti, seyyathāpi gaṇakamahāmattā’’ti. ‘‘Nāyyā ete bhikkhū, paribbājakā’’ti. ‘Bhikkhū na bhikkhū’ti abbhutaṃ akaṃsu. Atha kho so upāsako upagate sañjānitvā ujjhāyati khiyyati vipāceti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma bhadantā chattappaggahitā āhiṇḍissantī’’ti! Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū tassa upāsakassa ujjhāyantassa khiyyantassa vipācentassa. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, chattaṃ dhāretabbaṃ. Yo dhāreyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

At that time, the bhikkhus of the group of six wandered about carrying umbrellas. On that occasion, a certain lay follower went to a park with several Jain disciples. From a distance, those Jain disciples saw the bhikkhus of the group of six approaching while carrying umbrellas. Seeing them, they said to that lay follower: “Sir, these venerables of yours are coming carrying umbrellas, just like government officials.” “These are not bhikkhus, sirs, they are wanderers.” They made a fuss, saying, “Bhikkhus or not bhikkhus?” Then, when they came closer, that lay follower recognized them and complained, criticized, and spread it about: “How can these venerables wander about carrying umbrellas?” The bhikkhus heard that lay follower complaining, criticizing, and spreading it about. Then those bhikkhus informed the Blessed One of the matter. “Is it true, as is said, bhikkhus, that you wandered about carrying umbrellas?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One rebuked them… Having rebuked them, the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, an umbrella should not be carried. Whoever carries one commits an offense of wrong-doing.”

Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu gilāno hoti. Tassa bhikkhuno vinā chattaṃ na phāsu hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, gilānassa chattaṃ dhāretu’’nti.

At that time, a certain bhikkhu was sick. It was not comfortable for that bhikkhu without an umbrella. They informed the Blessed One of the matter. “Bhikkhus, I allow a sick bhikkhu to use an umbrella.”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū – gilānasseva bhagavatā chattaṃ anuññātaṃ no agilānassāti – ārāme ārāmūpacāre chattaṃ dhāretuṃ kukkuccāyanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, agilānenapi ārāme ārāmūpacāre chattaṃ dhāretu’’nti.

At that time the bhikkhus were scrupulous about using an umbrella in the monastery or its vicinity, thinking, “The Blessed One has allowed an umbrella only for the sick, not for the healthy.” They informed the Blessed One of this matter. “Bhikkhus, I allow even a healthy bhikkhu to use an umbrella in the monastery or its vicinity.”

Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu sikkāya pattaṃ uṭṭitvā daṇḍe ālaggitvā vikāle aññatarena gāmadvārena atikkamati. Manussā – ‘esayyo coro gacchati, asissa vijjotalatī’ti anupatitvā gahetvā sañjānitvā muñciṃsu. Atha kho so bhikkhu ārāmaṃ gantvā bhikkhūnaṃ etamatthaṃ ārocesi. ‘‘Kiṃ pana tvaṃ, āvuso, daṇḍasikkaṃ dhāresī’’ti? ‘‘Evamāvuso’’ti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma bhikkhu daṇḍasikkaṃ dhāressasī’’ti! Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, daṇḍasikkā dhāretabbā. Yo dhāreyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

At that time, a certain bhikkhu, having lifted his bowl in a sling and attached it to a staff, was passing through a village gate at an improper time. People, thinking, “This fellow is a thief going about; his sword flashes,” pursued him, seized him, and upon recognizing him, released him. Then that bhikkhu went to the monastery and informed the bhikkhus of the matter. “But, friend, do you carry a staff with a bowl-sling?” “Yes, friend.” Those bhikkhus who were modest… criticized and complained, “How can a bhikkhu carry a staff with a bowl-sling?” Then those bhikkhus reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Is it true, as is said, bhikkhus, that you carried a staff with a bowl-sling?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One rebuked them… Having rebuked them, the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, a staff with a bowl-sling should not be carried. Whoever carries one commits an offense of wrong-doing.”

Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu gilāno hoti, na sakkoti vinā daṇḍena āhiṇḍituṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, gilānassa bhikkhuno daṇḍasammutiṃ dātuṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, dātabbā. Tena gilānena bhikkhunā saṅghaṃ upasaṅkamitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā vuḍḍhānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ pāde vanditvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā evamassa vacanīyo – ‘ahaṃ, bhante, gilāno; na sakkomi vinā daṇḍena āhiṇḍituṃ. Sohaṃ, bhante, saṅghaṃ daṇḍasammutiṃ yācāmī’ti. Dutiyampi yācitabbā. Tatiyampi yācitabbā. Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

At that time, a certain bhikkhu was sick and could not walk without a staff. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, I allow that a sick bhikkhu be given the agreement to use a staff. And thus, bhikkhus, it should be given. That sick bhikkhu should approach the Saṅgha, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, pay homage at the feet of the senior bhikkhus, sit in a squatting position, raise his joined palms, and say: ‘Venerable sirs, I am sick; I cannot walk without a staff. Therefore, venerable sirs, I ask the Saṅgha for the agreement to use a staff.’ A second time it should be requested. A third time it should be requested. Then a competent and capable bhikkhu should inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo bhikkhu gilāno, na sakkoti vinā daṇḍena āhiṇḍituṃ. So saṅghaṃ daṇḍasammutiṃ yācati. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmassa bhikkhuno daṇḍasammutiṃ dadeyya. Esā ñatti.

“Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. This bhikkhu, named so-and-so, is sick and cannot go about without a staff. He asks the Saṅgha for the agreement to use a staff. If it is agreeable to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha may grant the bhikkhu named so-and-so the agreement to use a staff. This is the motion.”

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo bhikkhu gilāno, na sakkoti vinā daṇḍena āhiṇḍituṃ. So saṅghaṃ daṇḍasammutiṃ yācati. Saṅgho itthannāmassa bhikkhuno daṇḍasammutiṃ deti. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa bhikkhuno daṇḍasammutiyā dānaṃ, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. This bhikkhu, named so-and-so, is sick and cannot go about without a staff. He asks the Saṅgha for the agreement to use a staff.

I allow, monks, a ruminator to ruminate. But, monks, it should not be brought out through the mouth and then swallowed.

At that time, a certain group was offering a meal to the Sangha. In the dining hall, many grains of cooked rice were scattered about. People complained, grumbled, and criticized: “How can these Sakyan ascetics not carefully accept the rice when it is being given? Each grain of cooked rice is brought to completion by a hundred acts of labor!” The monks heard these people complaining, grumbling, and criticizing. Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, to pick up and consume what falls while being given. For that, monks, has been relinquished by the donors.”

People complained, criticized, and protested, saying, “Just like householders enjoying sensual pleasures!” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, various kinds of waistbands should not be worn: the kalābukaṃ, the deḍḍubhakaṃ, the murajaṃ, and the maddavīṇaṃ. Whoever wears them commits an offense of wrong conduct. Monks, I allow two kinds of waistbands: a plain band (paṭṭikaṃ) and a boar’s tooth (sūkarantakaṃ).” When the fringes of the waistband wore out… “Monks, I allow the drum-shaped (murajaṃ) and the lute-shaped (maddavīṇaṃ) for the fringes.” When the inside of the waistband wore out… “Monks, I allow ornamental stitching (sobhaṇaṃ) and cord-like stitching (guṇakaṃ).” When the tassel of the waistband wore out… “Monks, I allow a loop (vidha).”

“Monks, there are these five drawbacks in not using a tooth stick. One’s eyesight is impaired, the mouth becomes foul-smelling, the taste buds are not cleansed, bile and phlegm overwhelm the food, and the food does not please. These, monks, are the five drawbacks in not using a tooth stick.”

‘‘Pañcime, bhikkhave, ānisaṃsā dantakaṭṭhassa khādane. Cakkhussaṃ, mukhaṃ na duggandhaṃ hoti, rasaharaṇiyo visujjhanti, pittaṃ semhaṃ bhattaṃ na pariyonandhati, bhattamassa chādeti – ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca ānisaṃsā dantakaṭṭhassa khādane. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, dantakaṭṭha’’nti.

They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, a long tooth stick should not be used. Whoever uses one commits an offense of wrong conduct.

At that time, a certain monk, while traveling through the Kosala countryside to Savatthi, was threatened by an elephant on the way. That monk ran to the foot of a tree but, being scrupulous, did not climb it. The elephant went another way. Then that monk, having gone to Savatthi, told this matter to the monks. The monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, when there is a reason, to climb a tree to the height of a man in emergencies, as needed.”

285.Now at that time, the monks named Yameḷa and Kekuṭa were two brothers, brahmins by birth, with beautiful speech and excellent pronunciation. They approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, those monks said to the Blessed One: “Now, venerable sir, monks of various names, of various clans, of various races, and of various families have gone forth. They corrupt the Buddha’s words with their own dialects. Let us, venerable sir, render the Buddha’s words into metrical form.” The Buddha rebuked them: “How can you foolish men say such a thing—‘Let us, venerable sir, render the Buddha’s words into metrical form’? This will not inspire confidence in those without it…Having rebuked them… he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, the Buddha’s words should not be rendered into metrical form. Whoever does so incurs an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, that each should learn the Buddha’s words in his own dialect.”

286. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū lokāyataṃ pariyāpuṇanti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – seyyathāpi gihī kāmabhoginoti.

Yo pariyāpuṇeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

286.At that time the group-of-six monks were learning Lokāyata. People complained, criticised, and disparaged them: “Just like householders indulging in sensual pleasures!” The monks heard these people complaining, criticising, and disparaging. Then those monks reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, could one who finds essence in Lokāyata attain growth, increase, and abundance in this Dhamma-Vinaya?” “No, venerable sir.” “Or could one who finds essence in this Dhamma-Vinaya learn Lokāyata?” “No, venerable sir.” “Monks, Lokāyata should not be learned. Whoever learns it incurs an offense of wrong-doing.”

At that time the monks of the group of six were teaching worldly philosophies. People complained, criticized, and denounced them, saying, “Just like householders enjoying sensual pleasures!” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, worldly philosophies should not be taught. Whoever teaches them incurs an offense of wrong-doing.”

287. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū tiracchānavijjaṃ pariyāpuṇanti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – seyyathāpi gihī kāmabhoginoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, tiracchānavijjā pariyāpuṇitabbā. Yo pariyāpuṇeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū tiracchānavijjaṃ vācenti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – seyyathāpi gihī kāmabhoginoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, tiracchānavijjā vācetabbā. Yo vāceyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

At that time the monks of the group of six were teaching vulgar arts.

Yo vadeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

288.At that time, the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma surrounded by a large assembly when he sneezed. The monks—“May the Blessed One live! May the Sugata live!”—made a loud noise, a great noise. Because of that noise, the Dhamma talk was interrupted. Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks, if someone sneezes, does saying ‘Live!’ cause them to live or die?” “No, Venerable Sir.” “Monks, one should not say ‘Live!’ when someone sneezes. Whoever says so incurs an offense of wrong-doing.”

Tena kho pana samayena manussā bhikkhūnaṃ khipite ‘jīvatha bhante’ti vadanti. Bhikkhū kukkuccāyantā nālapanti.

Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, gihīnaṃ ‘jīvatha bhante’ti vuccamānena ‘ciraṃ jīvā’ti vattu’’nti.

At that time, people would say to the monks when they sneezed, “Live long, venerable sir!” The monks, being scrupulous, did not respond. People complained, were annoyed, and criticized: “How can these Sakyan ascetics not respond when told ‘Live long, venerable sir’!” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, householders are fond of auspicious words. I allow, monks, that when householders say ‘Live long, venerable sir,’ you may respond, ‘May you live long.’”

Yo khādeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

289.At that time, the Blessed One was seated, teaching the Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly. A certain monk had eaten garlic. Thinking, “Lest the monks be bothered,” he sat to one side. The Blessed One saw that monk seated apart and addressed the monks: “Why, monks, is that monk sitting apart?” “Venerable sir, this monk has eaten garlic. Thinking, ‘Lest the monks be bothered,’ he sat to one side.” “Monks, is it proper to eat something that, when eaten, would exclude one from such a Dhamma talk?” “No, venerable sir.” “Monks, garlic should not be eaten. Whoever eats it incurs an offense of wrong-doing.”

Tena kho pana samayena āyasmato sāriputtassa udaravātābādho hoti. Atha kho āyasmā mahāmoggallāno yenāyasmā sāriputto tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ sāriputtaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘pubbe te, āvuso sāriputta, udaravātābādho kena phāsu hotī’’ti? ‘‘Lasuṇena me, āvuso’’ti [atha kho āyasmā sāriputto āyasmantaṃ mahāmoggallānaṃ etadavoca ‘‘pubbe kho me āvuso moggallāna udaravātābādho lasuṇena phāsu hotī’’ti (ka.)]. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, ābādhappaccayā lasuṇaṃ khāditu’’nti.

At that time, Venerable Sāriputta was suffering from a stomach ailment due to wind. Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna approached Venerable Sāriputta and said: “Friend Sāriputta, in the past, what brought you relief from this stomach ailment due to wind?” “Friend, garlic did.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow garlic to be eaten on account of sickness.”

They ate at the wrong time, drank alcohol, wore garlands, perfumes, and cosmetics. They danced, sang, played music, and clowned.

At that time, after the Venerable Uruvelakassapa had gone forth, the Sangha acquired a large amount of metalware, woodenware, and earthenware. Then the monks thought, “What metalware has the Blessed One allowed, and what has he not allowed? What woodenware has he allowed, and what has he not allowed? What earthenware has he allowed, and what has he not allowed?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, in this connection, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow all metalware except weapons. I allow all woodenware except a seat, a couch, a wooden bowl, and wooden sandals. I allow all earthenware except a water-strainer and a clay hut.”
