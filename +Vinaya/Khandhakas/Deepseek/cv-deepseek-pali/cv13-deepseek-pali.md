1.Emission of Semen

97. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā udāyī ekaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno hoti sañcetanikaṃ sukkavissaṭṭhiṃ appaṭicchannaṃ.

Bhagavato [te bhikkhū bhagavato (syā.)] etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Tena hi, bhikkhave, saṅgho udāyissa bhikkhuno ekissā āpattiyā sañcetanikāya sukkavissaṭṭhiyā appaṭicchannāya chārattaṃ mānattaṃ detu. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, dātabbaṃ –

97.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. Now at that time Venerable Udāyī had incurred one offense involving intentional emission of semen, which was unconcealed. He informed the bhikkhus: “Venerables, I have incurred one offense involving intentional emission of semen, which was unconcealed. How should I proceed?” They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Then, bhikkhus, the Saṅgha should impose a six-night mānatta on the bhikkhu Udāyī for one offense involving intentional emission of semen, which was unconcealed. And it should be imposed thus:

Appaṭicchannamānattaṃ

The Unconcealed Mānatta

98. ‘‘Tena, bhikkhave, udāyinā bhikkhunā saṅghaṃ upasaṅkamitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā vuḍḍhānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ pāde vanditvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā evamassa vacanīyo – ‘ahaṃ, bhante, ekaṃ āpattiṃ āpajjiṃ sañcetanikaṃ sukkavissaṭṭhiṃ appaṭicchannaṃ.

98.“Then, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu Udāyī should approach the Saṅgha, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, pay homage at the feet of the senior bhikkhus, sit in a squatting position, raise his joined palms, and should say thus: ‘Venerable sirs, I have incurred one offense involving intentional emission of semen, which was unconcealed. Therefore, venerable sirs, I ask the Saṅgha for a six-night mānatta for one offense involving intentional emission of semen, which was unconcealed. Venerable sirs, I have incurred one offense involving intentional emission of semen, which was unconcealed. For the second time, venerable sirs, I ask the Saṅgha for a six-night mānatta for one offense involving intentional emission of semen, which was unconcealed. Venerable sirs, I have incurred one offense involving intentional emission of semen, which was unconcealed. For the third time, venerable sirs, I ask the Saṅgha for a six-night mānatta for one offense involving intentional emission of semen, which was unconcealed.’ A competent and able bhikkhu should then inform the Saṅgha:

156.At that time, a certain bhikkhu had committed several Saṅghādisesa offenses. He did not know the extent of the offenses, nor did he know the number of nights; he did not remember the extent of the offenses, nor did he remember the number of nights; he was uncertain about the extent of the offenses, and uncertain about the number of nights. He informed the bhikkhus, 'Friends, I have committed several Saṅghādisesa offenses. I do not know the extent of the offenses, nor do I know the number of nights; I do not remember the extent of the offenses, nor do I remember the number of nights; I am uncertain about the extent of the offenses, and uncertain about the number of nights. How should I proceed?' They reported the matter to the Blessed One. 'In that case, bhikkhus, let the Saṅgha grant that bhikkhu probation for an indeterminate period for those offenses. And thus, bhikkhus, it should be granted:

‘‘Tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā saṅghaṃ upasaṅkamitvā…pe… evamassa vacanīyo – ‘ahaṃ, bhante, sambahulā saṅghādisesā āpattiyo āpajjiṃ.

That bhikkhu, bhikkhus, should approach the Saṅgha [...] and say, 'Venerable sirs, I have committed several Saṅghādisesa offenses. I do not know the extent of the offenses, nor do I know the number of nights; I do not remember the extent of the offenses, nor do I remember the number of nights; I am uncertain about the extent of the offenses, and uncertain about the number of nights. Therefore, venerable sirs, I request the Saṅgha for probation for an indeterminate period for those offenses.' He should be asked a second time. He should be asked a third time. A competent and capable bhikkhu should inform the Saṅgha:

157. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo bhikkhu sambahulā saṅghādisesā āpattiyo āpajji.

157.Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha listen to me. This bhikkhu named so-and-so has committed several Saṅghādisesa offenses. He does not know the extent of the offenses, nor does he know the number of nights; he does not remember the extent of the offenses, nor does he remember the number of nights; he is uncertain about the extent of the offenses, and uncertain about the number of nights. He requests the Saṅgha for probation for an indeterminate period for those offenses. If the Saṅgha is ready, may the Saṅgha grant the bhikkhu named so-and-so probation for an indeterminate period for those offenses. This is the motion.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo bhikkhu sambahulā saṅghādisesā āpattiyo āpajji. Āpattipariyantaṃ na jānāti, rattipariyantaṃ na jānāti; āpattipariyantaṃ nassarati, rattipariyantaṃ nassarati; āpattipariyante vematiko, rattipariyante vematiko.

Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. This bhikkhu, named so-and-so, has committed several Saṅghādisesa offenses. He does not know the extent of the offenses, nor does he know the number of nights; he does not remember the extent of the offenses, nor does he remember the number of nights; he is uncertain about the extent of the offenses, and uncertain about the number of nights. He requests the Saṅgha for probation for an indeterminate period for these offenses. The Saṅgha grants the bhikkhu, named so-and-so, probation for an indeterminate period for these offenses. Any venerable one who approves of granting probation for an indeterminate period for these offenses to the bhikkhu named so-and-so, let him be silent; any who does not approve, let him speak.

‘‘Dutiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi…pe… tatiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi…pe….

For the second time, I say this [...]; for the third time, I say this [...].

‘‘Dinno saṅghena itthannāmassa bhikkhuno tāsaṃ āpattīnaṃ suddhantaparivāso. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

Probation for an indeterminate period for these offenses has been granted by the Saṅgha to the bhikkhu named so-and-so. It is approved by the Saṅgha, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.

158. ‘‘Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, suddhantaparivāso dātabbo; evaṃ parivāso dātabbo. Kathañca, bhikkhave, suddhantaparivāso dātabbo? Āpattipariyantaṃ na jānāti, rattipariyantaṃ na jānāti; āpattipariyantaṃ nassarati, rattipariyantaṃ nassarati; āpattipariyante vematiko, rattipariyante vematiko – suddhantaparivāso dātabbo.

158.Thus, bhikkhus, probation for an indeterminate period should be granted; thus should probation be granted. And how, bhikkhus, should probation for an indeterminate period be granted? He does not know the extent of the offenses, nor does he know the number of nights; he does not remember the extent of the offenses, nor does he remember the number of nights; he is uncertain about the extent of the offenses, and uncertain about the number of nights—probation for an indeterminate period should be granted.

‘‘Āpattipariyantaṃ jānāti, rattipariyantaṃ na jānāti; āpattipariyantaṃ sarati, rattipariyantaṃ nassarati; āpattipariyante nibbematiko, rattipariyante vematiko – suddhantaparivāso dātabbo.

He knows the extent of the offenses but does not know the number of nights; he remembers the extent of the offenses but does not remember the number of nights; he is certain about the extent of the offenses but is uncertain about the number of nights—probation for an indeterminate period should be granted.

‘‘Āpattipariyantaṃ ekaccaṃ jānāti, ekaccaṃ na jānāti, rattipariyantaṃ na jānāti; āpattipariyantaṃ ekaccaṃ sarati, ekaccaṃ nassarati, rattipariyantaṃ nassarati; āpattipariyante ekacce vematiko, ekacce nibbematiko, rattipariyante vematiko – suddhantaparivāso dātabbo.

He knows some of the extent of the offenses but not others, and does not know the number of nights; he remembers some of the extent of the offenses but not others, and does not remember the number of nights; he is uncertain about some of the extent of the offenses but certain about others, and uncertain about the number of nights—probation for an indeterminate period should be granted.

‘‘Āpattipariyantaṃ na jānāti, rattipariyantaṃ ekaccaṃ jānāti, ekaccaṃ na jānāti; āpattipariyantaṃ nassarati, rattipariyantaṃ ekaccaṃ sarati, ekaccaṃ nassarati; āpattipariyante vematiko, rattipariyante ekacce vematiko, ekacce nibbematiko – suddhantaparivāso dātabbo.

He does not know the extent of the offenses, but knows the number of nights in some instances and does not in others; he does not remember the extent of the offenses, but remembers the number of nights in some instances and does not in others; he is uncertain about the extent of the offenses, but is uncertain about the number of nights in some instances and certain in others—probation for an indeterminate period should be granted.

‘‘Āpattipariyantaṃ jānāti, rattipariyantaṃ ekaccaṃ jānāti, ekaccaṃ na jānāti; āpattipariyantaṃ sarati, rattipariyantaṃ ekaccaṃ sarati, ekaccaṃ nassarati; āpattipariyante nibbematiko, rattipariyante ekacce vematiko, ekacce nibbematiko – suddhantaparivāso dātabbo.

He knows the extent of the offenses, and knows some of the number of nights but not others; he remembers the extent of the offenses, and remembers some of the number of nights but not others; he is certain about the extent of the offenses, but uncertain about some of the number of nights and certain about others—probation for an indeterminate period should be granted.

‘‘Āpattipariyantaṃ ekaccaṃ jānāti, ekaccaṃ na jānāti; rattipariyantaṃ ekaccaṃ jānāti, ekaccaṃ na jānāti; āpattipariyantaṃ ekaccaṃ sarati, ekaccaṃ nassarati; rattipariyantaṃ ekaccaṃ sarati, ekaccaṃ nassarati; āpattipariyante ekacce vematiko, ekacce nibbematiko; rattipariyante ekacce vematiko, ekacce nibbematiko – suddhantaparivāso dātabbo. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, suddhantaparivāso dātabbo.

He knows some of the extent of the offenses but not others; he knows some of the number of nights but not others; he remembers some of the extent of the offenses but not others; he remembers some of the number of nights but not others; he is uncertain about some of the extent of the offenses but certain about others; he is uncertain about some of the number of nights but certain about others—probation for an indeterminate period should be granted. Thus, bhikkhus, probation for an indeterminate period should be granted.

159. ‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, parivāso dātabbo? Āpattipariyantaṃ jānāti, rattipariyantaṃ jānāti; āpattipariyantaṃ sarati, rattipariyantaṃ sarati; āpattipariyante nibbematiko, rattipariyante nibbematiko – parivāso dātabbo.

159.And how, bhikkhus, should probation be granted? He knows the extent of the offenses, he knows the number of nights; he remembers the extent of the offenses, he remembers the number of nights; he is certain about the extent of the offenses, he is certain about the number of nights—probation should be granted.

‘‘Āpattipariyantaṃ na jānāti, rattipariyantaṃ jānāti; āpattipariyantaṃ nassarati, rattipariyantaṃ sarati, āpattipariyante vematiko, rattipariyante nibbematiko – parivāso dātabbo.

He does not know the extent of the offenses, but he knows the number of nights; he does not remember the extent of the offenses, but he remembers the number of nights; he is uncertain about the extent of the offenses, but he is certain about the number of nights—probation should be granted.

‘‘Āpattipariyantaṃ ekaccaṃ jānāti, ekaccaṃ na jānāti, rattipariyantaṃ jānāti; āpattipariyantaṃ ekaccaṃ sarati, ekaccaṃ nassarati, rattipariyantaṃ sarati; āpattipariyante ekacce vematiko, ekacce nibbematiko, rattipariyante nibbematiko – parivāso dātabbo. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, parivāso dātabbo.

He knows some of the extent of the offenses but not others, but knows the number of nights; he remembers some of the extent of the offenses but not others, but remembers the number of nights; he is uncertain about some of the extent of the offenses but certain about others, and is certain about the number of nights—probation should be granted. Thus, bhikkhus, probation should be granted.

Parivāso niṭṭhito.

The probation is concluded.

3.The Forty

160. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu parivasanto vibbhami. So puna paccāgantvā bhikkhū upasampadaṃ yāci. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

160.At that time a certain bhikkhu, while undergoing probation, became disaffected. He then returned and requested higher ordination from the bhikkhus. They reported the matter to the Blessed One.

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu parivasanto vibbhamati. Vibbhantakassa, bhikkhave, parivāso na ruhati. So ce puna upasampajjati, tassa tadeva purimaṃ parivāsadānaṃ. Yo parivāso dinno sudinno, yo parivuttho suparivuttho, avaseso parivasitabbo.

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu undergoing probation becomes disaffected. For one who has become disaffected, bhikkhus, the probation does not count.

The Saṅgha returns him to the root for the intervening offenses of the earlier offenses and the intervening offenses of the later offenses by a righteous act, a valid act, a suitable act; it grants him lawful compounded probation, grants him lawful penance, and rehabilitates him lawfully.

The Third Chapter on Accumulations.

Tassuddānaṃ –

Its summary:

Appaṭicchannā ekāha-dvīha-tīha-catūha ca;Pañcāhapakkhadasannaṃ, āpattimāha mahāmuni.

Unconcealed for one, two, three, or four days; For five days, a fortnight, or a month, the Great Sage declared an offense.

Suddhanto ca vibbhamanto, parimāṇamukhaṃ dve bhikkhū;Tattha saññino dve yathā, vematikā tatheva ca.

From purity and straying, two bhikkhus at the limit of measure; There, two who are percipient, and likewise two who are doubtful.

Missakadiṭṭhino dve ca, asuddhakekadiṭṭhino;Dve ceva suddhadiṭṭhino.

Two who hold mixed views, two who hold singular impure views; And two who hold pure views.

Tatheva ca eko chādeti, atha makkhamatena ca;Ummattakadesanañca, mūlā aṭṭhārasa [pannarasa (ka.)] visuddhato.

Likewise, one conceals, then with a corrupt motive; And the preaching of the insane—these are the eighteen roots away from purity.

Ācariyānaṃ vibhajjapadānaṃ [vibhajjavādīnaṃ (sī.)], tambapaṇṇidīpapasādakānaṃ;Mahāvihāravāsīnaṃ, vācanā saddhammaṭṭhitiyāti.

Of the teachers who expound the distinctions, who inspired faith in Tambapaṇṇidīpa; residents of the Mahāvihāra, their recitation is for the stability of the true Dhamma.
