1.The Procedure in the Presence

185. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū asammukhībhūtānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ kammāni karonti – tajjanīyampi, niyassampi, pabbājanīyampi, paṭisāraṇīyampi, ukkhepanīyampi. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma chabbaggiyā bhikkhū asammukhībhūtānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ kammāni karissanti – tajjanīyampi, niyassampi, pabbājanīyampi, paṭisāraṇīyampi, ukkhepanīyampī’’ti! Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, chabbaggiyā bhikkhū asammukhībhūtānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ kammāni karonti – tajjanīyampi, niyassampi, pabbājanīyampi, paṭisāraṇīyampi, ukkhepanīyampī’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā – ‘‘ananucchavikaṃ, bhikkhave, tesaṃ moghapurisānaṃ ananulomikaṃ appatirūpaṃ assāmaṇakaṃ akappiyaṃ akaraṇīyaṃ. Kathañhi nāma te, bhikkhave, moghapurisā asammukhībhūtānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ kammāni karissanti – tajjanīyampi, niyassampi, pabbājanīyampi, paṭisāraṇīyampi, ukkhepanīyampi! Netaṃ, bhikkhave, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – na, bhikkhave, asammukhībhūtānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ kammaṃ kātabbaṃ – tajjanīyaṃ vā, niyassaṃ vā, pabbājanīyaṃ vā, paṭisāraṇīyaṃ vā, ukkhepanīyaṃ vā. Yo kareyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa.

185.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. Now at that time, the monks of the group of six performed legal acts against monks who were not present—the act of censure, the act of subjection, the act of banishment, the act of reconciliation, and the act of suspension. Those monks who were modest, content, scrupulous, desirous of training, and of good conduct complained, grumbled, and spread it about, saying: “How can the monks of the group of six perform legal acts against monks who were not present—the act of censure, the act of subjection, the act of banishment, the act of reconciliation, and the act of suspension?” Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One… “Is it true, monks, that the monks of the group of six perform legal acts against monks who were not present—the act of censure, the act of subjection, the act of banishment, the act of reconciliation, and the act of suspension?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked them: “Foolish men, this is unsuitable, unseemly, improper, unworthy of an ascetic, not allowable, and should not be done. How can these foolish men perform legal acts against monks who are not present—the act of censure, the act of subjection, the act of banishment, the act of reconciliation, and the act of suspension? This will not inspire confidence in the unconvinced… Having rebuked them… he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, a legal act should not be performed against a monk who is not present—the act of censure, the act of subjection, the act of banishment, the act of reconciliation, or the act of suspension. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong conduct.”

186. ‘‘Adhammavādī puggalo adhammavādī sambahulā adhammavādī saṅgho. Dhammavādī puggalo dhammavādī sambahulā dhammavādī saṅgho.

186.“A person who proclaims what is not the Dhamma, many who proclaim what is not the Dhamma, a Sangha that proclaims what is not the Dhamma. A person who proclaims the Dhamma, many who proclaim the Dhamma, a Sangha that proclaims the Dhamma.

2.The Discipline of Mindfulness

189. [idaṃ vatthu pārā. 380 ādayo] Tena samayena buddho bhagavā rājagahe viharati veḷuvane kalandakanivāpe. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmatā dabbena mallaputtena jātiyā sattavassena arahattaṃ sacchikataṃ hoti. Yaṃ kiñci sāvakena pattabbaṃ sabbaṃ tena anuppattaṃ hoti. Natthi cassa kiñci uttari [uttariṃ (sī.)] karaṇīyaṃ, katassa vā paticayo. Atha kho āyasmato dabbassa mallaputtassa rahogatassa paṭisallīnassa evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – ‘‘mayā kho jātiyā sattavassena arahattaṃ sacchikataṃ. Yaṃ kiñci sāvakena pattabbaṃ sabbaṃ mayā anuppattaṃ. Natthi ca me kiñci uttarikaraṇīyaṃ, katassa vā paticayo. Kiṃ nu kho ahaṃ saṅghassa veyyāvaccaṃ kareyya’’nti?

189.At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. Now at that time, the Venerable Dabba the Mallian had realized arahantship at the age of seven. Whatever can be attained by a disciple, all that had been attained by him. There was nothing further for him to do, nor any accumulation of what had been done. Then, while the Venerable Dabba the Mallian was in seclusion, the following thought arose in his mind: "I have realized arahantship at the age of seven. Whatever can be attained by a disciple, all that has been attained by me. There is nothing further for me to do, nor any accumulation of what has been done. What service should I perform for the Sangha?"

Atha kho āyasmato dabbassa mallaputtassa etadahosi – ‘‘yaṃnūnāhaṃ saṅghassa senāsanañca paññapeyyaṃ bhattāni ca uddiseyya’’nti. Atha kho āyasmā dabbo mallaputto sāyanhasamayaṃ paṭisallānā vuṭṭhito yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā dabbo mallaputto bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘idha mayhaṃ, bhante, rahogatassa paṭisallīnassa evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – ‘mayā kho jātiyā sattavassena arahattaṃ sacchikataṃ.

Tassa mayhaṃ, bhante, etadahosi – ‘yaṃnūnāhaṃ saṅghassa senāsanañca paññapeyyaṃ bhattāni ca uddiseyya’nti. Icchāmahaṃ, bhante, saṅghassa senāsanañca paññāpetuṃ bhattāni ca uddisitu’’nti. ‘‘Sādhu sādhu, dabba. Tena hi tvaṃ, dabba, saṅghassa senāsanañca paññapehi bhattāni ca uddisāhī’’ti [uddisāti (pārā. 380)]. ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti kho āyasmā dabbo mallaputto bhagavato paccassosi. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘tena hi, bhikkhave, saṅgho dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ senāsanapaññāpakañca bhattuddesakañca sammannatu. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, sammannitabbo. Paṭhamaṃ dabbo mallaputto yācitabbo [dabbo yācitabbo (syā. ka.)]. Yācitvā byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

Then Venerable Dabba the Mallian thought: "Why don’t I assign dwellings and designate meals for the Sangha?" Then, in the evening, Venerable Dabba the Mallian emerged from seclusion and went to the Buddha. Having approached, he paid homage and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, Venerable Dabba the Mallian said to the Buddha: "Just now, sir, while I was alone in seclusion, this thought arose in my mind: ‘I realized arahantship at the age of seven. Whatever can be attained by a disciple, I have attained it all. There is nothing further for me to do, nor any accumulation of what has been done. What service, then, should I perform for the Sangha?’ Then, sir, it occurred to me: ‘Why don’t I assign dwellings and designate meals for the Sangha?’ I wish, sir, to assign dwellings and designate meals for the Sangha." "Good, good, Dabba. Well then, Dabba, assign dwellings and designate meals for the Sangha." "Yes, sir," replied Venerable Dabba the Mallian to the Buddha. Then, on this occasion, on this account, the Buddha gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: "Well then, monks, let the Sangha appoint Dabba the Mallian as the assigner of dwellings and the designator of meals. And this is how he should be appointed. First, Dabba the Mallian should be requested. Having requested, a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:

190. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho āyasmantaṃ dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ senāsanapaññāpakañca bhattuddesakañca sammanneyya. Esā ñatti.

190."Venerable sir, may the Sangha hear me. If it seems fit to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint the Venerable Dabba the Mallian as the assigner of dwellings and the designator of meals. This is the motion."

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Saṅgho āyasmantaṃ dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ senāsanapaññāpakañca bhattuddesakañca sammannati. Yassāyasmato khamati āyasmato dabbassa mallaputtassa senāsanapaññāpakassa ca bhattuddesakassa ca sammuti, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

"Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. The Sangha appoints the Venerable Dabba the Mallian as the assigner of dwellings and the designator of meals. If the appointment of the Venerable Dabba the Mallian as the assigner of dwellings and the designator of meals is agreeable to any venerable one, let him remain silent; if it is not agreeable, let him speak."

‘‘Sammato saṅghena āyasmā dabbo mallaputto senāsanapaññāpako ca bhattuddesako ca. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

"The Sangha has appointed the Venerable Dabba the Mallian as the assigner of dwellings and the designator of meals. It is agreeable to the Sangha, therefore it is silent; thus I hold it."

191. Sammato ca panāyasmā dabbo mallaputto sabhāgānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ ekajjhaṃ senāsanaṃ paññapeti. Ye te bhikkhū suttantikā tesaṃ ekajjhaṃ senāsanaṃ paññapeti – te aññamaññaṃ suttantaṃ saṅgāyissantīti. Ye te bhikkhū vinayadharā tesaṃ ekajjhaṃ senāsanaṃ paññapeti – te aññamaññaṃ vinayaṃ vinicchinissantīti. Ye te bhikkhū dhammakathikā tesaṃ ekajjhaṃ senāsanaṃ paññapeti – te aññamaññaṃ dhammaṃ sākacchissantīti. Ye te bhikkhū jhāyino tesaṃ ekajjhaṃ senāsanaṃ paññapeti – te aññamaññaṃ na byābādhissantīti. Ye te bhikkhū tiracchānakathikā kāyadaḷhibahulā [kāyadaḍḍhibahulā (sī.)] viharanti tesampi ekajjhaṃ senāsanaṃ paññapeti – imāyapime āyasmanto ratiyā acchissantīti. Yepi te bhikkhū vikāle āgacchanti tesampi tejodhātuṃ samāpajjitvā teneva ālokena senāsanaṃ paññapeti; apisu bhikkhū sañcicca vikāle āgacchanti – mayaṃ āyasmato dabbassa mallaputtassa iddhipāṭihāriyaṃ passissāmāti.

191.And Venerable Dabba the Mallian was authorized to assign dwellings to monks according to their groups. He assigned dwellings to those monks who were experts in the discourses together—thinking, "They will chant the discourses together." He assigned dwellings to those monks who were experts in the discipline together—thinking, "They will decide the discipline together." He assigned dwellings to those monks who were Dhamma-talkers together—thinking, "They will discuss the Dhamma together." He assigned dwellings to those monks who were meditators together—thinking, "They will not harass one another." He also assigned dwellings together to those monks who indulged in animal talk and frequently pursued bodily vigor—thinking, "These venerable ones will spend the night with this." And even for those monks who arrived at unseemly times, having attained the fire element, he would assign dwellings by that very light. Furthermore, monks deliberately came at unseemly times, thinking, "We will see the miracle of the Venerable Dabba the Mallian's psychic power."

Te āyasmantaṃ dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ upasaṅkamitvā evaṃ vadanti – ‘‘amhākaṃ, āvuso dabba, senāsanaṃ paññapehī’’ti. Te āyasmā dabbo mallaputto evaṃ vadeti – ‘‘kattha āyasmantā icchanti kattha paññapemī’’ti? Te sañcicca dūre apadisanti – ‘‘amhākaṃ, āvuso dabba, gijjhakūṭe pabbate senāsanaṃ paññapehi. Amhākaṃ, āvuso, corapapāte senāsanaṃ paññapehi. Amhākaṃ, āvuso, isigilipasse kāḷasilāyaṃ senāsanaṃ paññapehi. Amhākaṃ, āvuso, vebhārapasse sattapaṇṇiguhāyaṃ senāsanaṃ paññapehi. Amhākaṃ, āvuso, sītavane sappasoṇḍikapabbhāre senāsanaṃ paññapehi. Amhākaṃ, āvuso, gotamakakandarāyaṃ [gomaṭakandarāyaṃ (syā. kaṃ.)] senāsanaṃ paññapehi. Amhākaṃ, āvuso, tindukakandarāyaṃ senāsanaṃ paññapehi. Amhākaṃ, āvuso, tapodakandarāyaṃ [kapotakandarāyaṃ (ka.)] senāsanaṃ paññapehi. Amhākaṃ, āvuso, tapodārāme senāsanaṃ paññapehi. Amhākaṃ, āvuso, jīvakambavane senāsanaṃ paññapehi. Amhākaṃ, āvuso, maddakucchimhi migadāye senāsanaṃ paññapehī’’ti.

They approached the Venerable Dabba the Mallian and said, "Friend Dabba, assign us dwellings." The Venerable Dabba the Mallian said, "Where do the venerable ones wish? Where shall I assign?" Deliberately, they pointed to distant places: "Friend Dabba, assign us dwellings on Vulture Peak Mountain. Friend Dabba, assign us dwellings at the Robbers' Cliff. Friend Dabba, assign us dwellings on the Black Rock of Isigili Slope. Friend Dabba, assign us dwellings in the Seven-Leaf Cave on Vebhara Slope. Friend Dabba, assign us dwellings in the Cool Wood, by the Snake's Head Cave. Friend Dabba, assign us dwellings in the Gotamaka Cave. Friend Dabba, assign us dwellings in the Tinduka Cave. Friend Dabba, assign us dwellings in the Tapoda Cave. Friend Dabba, assign us dwellings in the Tapoda Park. Friend Dabba, assign us dwellings in Jivaka's Mango Grove. Friend Dabba, assign us dwellings in the Deer Park at Maddakucchi."

Tesaṃ āyasmā dabbo mallaputto tejodhātuṃ samāpajjitvā aṅguliyā jalamānāya purato purato gacchati. Tepi teneva ālokena āyasmato dabbassa mallaputtassa piṭṭhito piṭṭhito gacchanti.

Tesaṃ āyasmā dabbo mallaputto evaṃ senāsanaṃ paññapetvā punadeva veḷuvanaṃ paccāgacchati.

The Venerable Dabba the Mallian, having entered the fire element, walked ahead with his blazing finger. They followed behind the Venerable Dabba the Mallian by that very light. The Venerable Dabba the Mallian assigned them dwellings thus: "This is a bed, this is a stool, this is a mattress, this is a pillow, this is the toilet, this is the urinal, this is drinking water, this is water for use, this is a tooth-stick, this is the Sangha's designated meeting area, this is the time to enter, this is the time to leave." Having assigned them dwellings in this way, the Venerable Dabba the Mallian returned once more to the Bamboo Grove.

Te pacchābhattaṃ piṇḍapātappaṭikkantā there bhikkhū pucchanti – ‘‘tumhākaṃ, āvuso, bhattagge kiṃ ahosi, tumhākaṃ kiṃ ahosī’’ti [kiṃ nāhosi (syā. kaṃ.)]? Ekacce therā evaṃ vadanti – ‘‘amhākaṃ, āvuso, sappi ahosi, telaṃ ahosi, uttaribhaṅgaṃ ahosī’’ti. Mettiyabhūmajakā pana bhikkhū evaṃ vadanti – ‘‘amhākaṃ, āvuso, na kiñci ahosi – pākatikaṃ yathārandhaṃ kaṇājakaṃ bilaṅgadutiya’’nti.

192.Now at that time the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka were newly ordained and of little merit. They received the poor dwellings assigned by the Sangha and poor almsfood. At that time in Rājagaha, people wished to give specially prepared almsfood to the senior monks—ghee, oil, and choice foods. But to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka, they gave only plain food—coarse gruel with broken rice, with bilaṅga as the second ingredient. After their meal, on returning from almsround, they asked the senior monks, "Friends, what did you receive at the meal? What did you get?" Some senior monks replied, "Friends, we received ghee, oil, and choice foods." But the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said, "Friends, we got nothing special—just plain coarse gruel with broken rice, with bilaṅga as the second ingredient."

Tena kho pana samayena kalyāṇabhattiko gahapati saṅghassa catukkabhattaṃ deti niccabhattaṃ. So bhattagge saputtadāro upatiṭṭhitvā parivisati – aññe odanena pucchanti, aññe sūpena pucchanti, aññe telena pucchanti, aññe uttaribhaṅgena pucchanti.

So yenāyasmā dabbo mallaputto tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho kalyāṇabhattikaṃ gahapatiṃ āyasmā dabbo mallaputto dhammiyā kathāya sandassesi samādapesi samuttejesi sampahaṃsesi.

Atha kho kalyāṇabhattiko gahapati anattamano ahosi. Kathañhi nāma pāpabhikkhū amhākaṃ ghare bhuñjissantīti gharaṃ gantvā dāsiṃ āṇāpesi – ‘‘ye, je, sve bhattikā āgacchanti te koṭṭhake āsanaṃ paññapetvā kaṇājakena bilaṅgadutiyena parivisā’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ ayyā’’ti kho sā dāsī kalyāṇabhattikassa gahapatino paccassosi.

At that time, the householder Kalyāṇabhattika regularly offered a meal of four dishes to the Saṅgha. He would stand in the meal-hall with his children and wife, serving: he would ask some for rice, some for soup, some for oil, and some for extra portions. Now at that time, the householder Kalyāṇabhattika had designated a meal for the Mettiya-Bhūmajaka bhikkhus for the next day. Then the householder Kalyāṇabhattika went to the monastery on some business. He approached Venerable Dabba the Mallian, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated there, Venerable Dabba instructed, urged, roused, and gladdened the householder Kalyāṇabhattika with a Dhamma talk. Then the householder Kalyāṇabhattika, having been instructed, urged, roused, and gladdened by Venerable Dabba the Mallian with a Dhamma talk, said to him, “Venerable sir, for whom is the meal designated at our house tomorrow?” “Householder, the meal at your house tomorrow is designated for the Mettiya-Bhūmajaka bhikkhus.” The householder Kalyāṇabhattika was displeased, thinking, “How can these wicked bhikkhus eat at our house?” Returning home, he ordered his servant, “Girl, prepare seats in the storeroom for those who come for the meal tomorrow and serve them broken rice with sour gruel.” “Yes, master,” replied the servant to the householder Kalyāṇabhattika.

Atha kho mettiyabhūmajakā bhikkhū – hiyyo kho, āvuso, amhākaṃ kalyāṇabhattikassa gahapatino bhattaṃ uddiṭṭhaṃ; sve amhe kalyāṇabhattiko gahapati saputtadāro upatiṭṭhitvā parivisissati; aññe odanena pucchissanti, aññe sūpena pucchissanti, aññe telena pucchissanti, aññe uttaribhaṅgena pucchissantīti.

Addasā kho sā dāsī mettiyabhūmajake bhikkhū dūratova āgacchante; disvāna koṭṭhake āsanaṃ paññāpetvā mettiyabhūmajake bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘nisīdatha, bhante’’ti. Atha kho mettiyabhūmajakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘nissaṃsayaṃ kho na tāva bhattaṃ siddhaṃ bhavissati yathā mayaṃ koṭṭhake nisīdāpiyāmā’’ti [nisīdāpeyyāmāti (ka.)]. Atha kho sā dāsī kaṇājakena [kāṇājakena (syā. kaṃ.)] bilaṅgadutiyena upagañchi – bhuñjatha, bhanteti. ‘‘Mayaṃ kho, bhagini, niccabhattikā’’ti. ‘‘Jānāmi ayyā niccabhattikāti. Api cāhaṃ hiyyova gahapatinā āṇattā – ‘ye, je, sve bhattikā āgacchanti, te koṭṭhake āsanaṃ paññāpetvā kaṇājakena bilaṅgadutiyena parivisā’ti. Bhuñjatha, bhante’’ti. Atha kho mettiyabhūmajakā bhikkhū – hiyyo kho, āvuso, kalyāṇabhattiko gahapati ārāmaṃ agamāsi dabbassa mallaputtassa santike.

Then the Mettiya-Bhūmajaka bhikkhus thought: “Yesterday, friends, a meal was designated for us at the householder Kalyāṇabhattika’s. Tomorrow, the householder Kalyāṇabhattika, together with his children and wife, will attend to us and serve us; he will ask some for rice, some for soup, some for oil, and some for extra portions.” With that very joy, they did not sleep as they wished that night. Then the Mettiya-Bhūmajaka bhikkhus, having dressed in the morning and taken their bowls and robes, went to the residence of the householder Kalyāṇabhattika. The servant girl saw the Mettiya-Bhūmajaka bhikkhus coming from afar. Seeing them, she arranged a seat in the storeroom and said to the Mettiya-Bhūmajaka bhikkhus: “Please sit down, venerable sirs.” Then the Mettiya-Bhūmajaka bhikkhus thought: “Surely the meal is not yet ready, since we are being made to sit in the storeroom.” Then the servant girl approached them with broken rice and sour gruel, saying: “Eat, venerable sirs.” “We are regular recipients of meals, sister.” “I know, masters, that you are regular recipients of meals. But yesterday the householder instructed me: ‘Girl, prepare seats in the storeroom for those who come for the meal tomorrow and serve them broken rice with sour gruel.’ Please eat, venerable sirs.” Then the Mettiya-Bhūmajaka bhikkhus thought: “Yesterday, friends, the householder Kalyāṇabhattika went to the monastery to see Dabba the Mallian. Surely we have been maligned to the householder by Dabba the Mallian.” With that very sorrow, they did not eat as they wished. Then the Mettiya-Bhūmajaka bhikkhus, after the meal, having returned from the alms round, went to the monastery, put away their bowls and robes, and sat down in the outer monastery hall with their outer robes draped over them, silent, crestfallen, with shoulders drooping, brooding, and unresponsive.

Atha kho mettiyā bhikkhunī yena mettiyabhūmajakā bhikkhū tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā mettiyabhūmajake bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘vandāmi ayyā’’ti. Evaṃ vutte mettiyabhūmajakā bhikkhū nālapiṃsu. Dutiyampi kho…pe… tatiyampi kho mettiyā bhikkhunī mettiyabhūmajake bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘vandāmi ayyā’’ti. Tatiyampi kho mettiyabhūmajakā bhikkhū nālapiṃsu. ‘‘Kyāhaṃ ayyānaṃ aparajjhāmi? Kissa maṃ ayyā nālapantī’’ti? ‘‘Tathā hi pana tvaṃ, bhagini, amhe dabbena mallaputtena viheṭhiyamāne ajjhupekkhasī’’ti? ‘‘Kyāhaṃ, ayyā, karomī’’ti? ‘‘Sace kho tvaṃ, bhagini, iccheyyāsi, ajjeva bhagavā āyasmantaṃ dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ nāsāpeyyā’’ti. ‘‘Kyāhaṃ, ayyā, karomi? Kiṃ mayā sakkā kātu’’nti? ‘‘Ehi tvaṃ, bhagini, yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ evaṃ vadehi – ‘idaṃ, bhante, nacchannaṃ nappatirūpaṃ, yāyaṃ, bhante, disā abhayā anītikā anupaddavā sāyaṃ disā sabhayā saītikā saupaddavā; yato nivātaṃ tato savātaṃ [tato pavātaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ.)]; udakaṃ maññe ādittaṃ; ayyenamhi dabbena mallaputtena dūsitā’’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ ayyā’’ti kho mettiyā bhikkhunī mettiyabhūmajakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ paṭissutvā [paṭissuṇitvā (syā. kaṃ.)] yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi. Ekamantaṃ ṭhitā kho mettiyā [sā mettiyā (syā. ka.)] bhikkhunī bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘idaṃ, bhante, nacchannaṃ nappatirūpaṃ, yāyaṃ, bhante, disā abhayā anītikā anupaddavā sāyaṃ disā sabhayā saītikā saupaddavā; yato nivātaṃ tato savātaṃ; udakaṃ maññe ādittaṃ; ayyenamhi dabbena mallaputtena dūsitā’’ti.

Then the bhikkhunī Mettiyā approached the Mettiya-Bhūmajaka bhikkhus. Having approached, she said to the Mettiya-Bhūmajaka bhikkhus: “I pay homage to the venerables.” When this was said, the Mettiya-Bhūmajaka bhikkhus did not respond. A second time… A third time the bhikkhunī Mettiyā said to the Mettiya-Bhūmajaka bhikkhus: “I pay homage to the venerables.” A third time the Mettiya-Bhūmajaka bhikkhus did not respond. “Have I offended the venerables? Why do the venerables not respond to me?” “It is because, sister, you looked on indifferently while we were being harassed by Dabba the Mallian.” “What can I do, venerables?” “If you wish, sister, today you could have the Blessed One banish Venerable Dabba the Mallian.” “What can I do, venerables? What is possible for me to do?” “Come, sister, approach the Blessed One and say this to him: ‘Venerable sir, this is unseemly and improper. That direction, venerable sir, which was fearless, untroubled, and without danger, has now become fearful, troubled, and dangerous. Where there was shelter from the wind, now there is exposure to the wind. The water seems to be on fire. I have been violated by Venerable Dabba the Mallian.’” “Very well, venerables,” the bhikkhunī Mettiyā replied to the Mettiya-Bhūmajaka bhikkhus. Then she approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. Standing there, the bhikkhunī Mettiyā said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, this is unseemly and improper. That direction, venerable sir, which was fearless, untroubled, and without danger, has now become fearful, troubled, and dangerous. Where there was shelter from the wind, now there is exposure to the wind. The water seems to be on fire. I have been violated by Venerable Dabba the Mallian.”

193. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā āyasmantaṃ dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ paṭipucchi – ‘‘sarasi tvaṃ, dabba, evarūpaṃ kattā yathāyaṃ bhikkhunī āhā’’ti? ‘‘Yathā maṃ, bhante, bhagavā jānātī’’ti. Dutiyampi kho bhagavā āyasmantaṃ dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sarasi tvaṃ, dabba, evarūpaṃ kattā yathāyaṃ bhikkhunī āhā’’ti? ‘‘Yathā maṃ, bhante, bhagavā jānātī’’ti. Tatiyampi kho bhagavā āyasmantaṃ dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sarasi tvaṃ, dabba, evarūpaṃ kattā yathāyaṃ bhikkhunī āhā’’ti? ‘‘Yathā maṃ, bhante, bhagavā jānātī’’ti. ‘‘Na kho, dabba, dabbā evaṃ nibbeṭhenti. Sace tayā kataṃ katanti vadehi. Sace akataṃ akatanti vadehī’’ti. ‘‘Yatohaṃ, bhante, jāto nābhijānāmi supinantenapi methunaṃ dhammaṃ paṭisevitā, pageva jāgaro’’ti.

193.Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, in connection with this matter, convened the Saṅgha of bhikkhus and questioned Venerable Dabba the Mallian: “Dabba, do you remember doing such a thing as this bhikkhunī says?” “Venerable sir, as the Blessed One knows me.” A second time the Blessed One said to Venerable Dabba the Mallian: “Dabba, do you remember doing such a thing as this bhikkhunī says?” “Venerable sir, as the Blessed One knows me.” A third time the Blessed One said to Venerable Dabba the Mallian: “Dabba, do you remember doing such a thing as this bhikkhunī says?” “Venerable sir, as the Blessed One knows me.” “Dabba, Dabbas do not equivocate like this. If you did it, say you did it. If you didn’t do it, say you didn’t do it.” “Venerable sir, since I was born, I do not recall having engaged in sexual intercourse even in a dream, much less while awake.” Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Then, bhikkhus, banish the bhikkhunī Mettiyā. And investigate these bhikkhus.” Having said this, the Blessed One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Atha kho te bhikkhū mettiyaṃ bhikkhuniṃ nāsesuṃ. Atha kho mettiyabhūmajakā bhikkhū te bhikkhū etadavocuṃ – ‘‘māvuso, mettiyaṃ bhikkhuniṃ nāsetha, na sā kiñci aparajjhati; amhehi sā ussāhitā kupitehi anattamanehi cāvanādhippāyehī’’ti. ‘‘Kiṃ pana tumhe, āvuso, āyasmantaṃ dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ amūlikāya sīlavipattiyā anuddhaṃsethā’’ti? ‘‘Evamāvuso’’ti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma mettiyabhūmajakā bhikkhū āyasmantaṃ dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ amūlikāya sīlavipattiyā anuddhaṃsessantī’’ti! Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ …pe… ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, mettiyabhūmajakā bhikkhū dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ amūlikāya sīlavipattiyā anuddhaṃsentī’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi –

Then those bhikkhus banished the bhikkhunī Mettiyā. Then the Mettiya-Bhūmajaka bhikkhus said to those bhikkhus: “Friends, do not banish the bhikkhunī Mettiyā; she has not done anything wrong. We incited her, being angry and displeased, with the intention of causing him to fall.” “But friends, did you accuse Venerable Dabba the Mallian of a groundless failure in virtue?” “Yes, friends.” Those bhikkhus who were modest… they complained, grumbled, and protested: “How could the Mettiya-Bhūmajaka bhikkhus groundlessly accuse Venerable Dabba the Mallian of a failure in virtue?” Then those bhikkhus reported the matter to the Blessed One… “Is it true, bhikkhus, that the Mettiya-Bhūmajaka bhikkhus groundlessly accused Dabba the Mallian of a failure in virtue?” “It is true, Blessed One.” Having rebuked them… the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the bhikkhus:

‘‘Tena hi, bhikkhave, saṅgho dabbassa mallaputtassa sativepullappattassa sativinayaṃ detu. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, dātabbo – ‘‘tena, bhikkhave, dabbena mallaputtena saṅghaṃ upasaṅkamitvā, ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā, vuḍḍhānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ pāde vanditvā, ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā, añjaliṃ paggahetvā, evamassa vacanīyo – ‘ime maṃ, bhante, mettiyabhūmajakā bhikkhū amūlikāya sīlavipattiyā anuddhaṃsenti.

"Then, monks, let the Sangha grant Dabba the Mallian, who has attained to the fullness of mindfulness, a verdict based on mindfulness. And this is how it should be granted: Monks, Dabba the Mallian should approach the Sangha, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, pay homage at the feet of the senior monks, sit in a squatting position, raise his joined palms, and say: ‘Venerable Sir, these monks, Mettiya and Bhūmajaka, accuse me of an unfounded transgression of morality. I, Venerable Sir, having attained to the fullness of mindfulness, request a verdict based on mindfulness from the Sangha.’ A second time he should make the request. A third time he should make the request: ‘Venerable Sir, these monks, Mettiya and Bhūmajaka, accuse me of an unfounded transgression of morality. I, having attained to the fullness of mindfulness, request a verdict based on mindfulness from the Sangha for the third time.’ A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:

194. Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ime mettiyabhūmajakā bhikkhū āyasmantaṃ dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ amūlikāya sīlavipattiyā anuddhaṃsenti. Āyasmā dabbo mallaputto sativepullappatto saṅghaṃ sativinayaṃ yācati.

Venerable Dabba the Mallian, having attained to the fullness of mindfulness, requests a verdict based on mindfulness from the Sangha. If the Sangha is ready, the Sangha should grant a verdict based on mindfulness to Venerable Dabba the Mallian, who has attained to the fullness of mindfulness. This is the motion."

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ime mettiyabhūmajakā bhikkhū āyasmantaṃ dabbaṃ mallaputtaṃ amūlikāya sīlavipattiyā anuddhaṃsenti. Āyasmā dabbo mallaputto sativepullappatto saṅghaṃ sativinayaṃ yācati.

195."Monks, there are these five lawful grants of a verdict based on mindfulness. A monk is pure and blameless, and they accuse him; and he requests it. The Sangha grants him a verdict based on mindfulness in accordance with the Dhamma and in concord. These, monks, are the five lawful grants of a verdict based on mindfulness."

196.At that time, the monk Gagga was insane, his mind deranged. Due to his insanity and derangement of mind, he had engaged in much that was un-ascetic and transgressed in speech and deed. The monks accused the monk Gagga of an offense committed while insane and deranged, asking, 'Do you, venerable, remember having committed such an offense?' He replied, 'Friends, I was insane, my mind deranged. Due to my insanity and derangement of mind, I engaged in much that was un-ascetic and transgressed in speech and deed. I do not remember it. This was done by me in delusion.' Even when spoken to thus, they continued to accuse him, 'Do you, venerable, remember having committed such an offense?' Those monks who were of few desires… grumbled, criticized, and complained, 'How can these monks accuse the monk Gagga of an offense committed while insane and deranged, asking, "Do you, venerable, remember having committed such an offense?" He replies, "Friends, I was insane, my mind deranged. Due to my insanity and derangement of mind, I engaged in much that was un-ascetic and transgressed in speech and deed. I do not remember it. This was done by me in delusion." Even when spoken to thus, they continue to accuse him, "Do you, venerable, remember having committed such an offense?"' Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One… 'Is it true, monks…?' 'It is true, Blessed One.'… Having rebuked them… the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks:

‘‘Tena hi, bhikkhave, saṅgho gaggassa bhikkhuno amūḷhassa amūḷhavinayaṃ detu.

"Very well, monks, let the Saṅgha grant the Settlement of Non-Delusion to the monk Gagga, who is not deluded. And this is how it should be granted: "Monks, the monk Gagga should approach the Saṅgha, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, pay homage at the feet of the senior monks, sit in the squatting position, raise his joined palms, and say: "'Venerable sirs, I was insane, with a deranged mind. Due to that insanity and deranged mind, I committed many unascetic acts and transgressed in speech and deed. The monks accuse me of offenses committed while insane and with a deranged mind, saying, "Do you, venerable, remember having committed such an offense?" I reply, "Friends, I was insane, with a deranged mind. Due to that insanity and deranged mind, I committed many unascetic acts and transgressed in speech and deed. I do not remember it. This was done by me in delusion." Even when I say this, they continue to accuse me, saying, "Do you, venerable, remember having committed such an offense?" Venerable sirs, being now not deluded, I request the Saṅgha for the Settlement of Non-Delusion.' "A second time he should make the request.

4.The Procedure of Acknowledgment

200. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū appaṭiññāya bhikkhūnaṃ kammāni karonti – tajjanīyampi, niyassampi, pabbājanīyampi, paṭisāraṇīyampi, ukkhepanīyampi. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma chabbaggiyā bhikkhū appaṭiññāya bhikkhūnaṃ kammāni karissanti – tajjanīyampi, niyassampi, pabbājanīyampi, paṭisāraṇīyampi, ukkhepanīyampī’’ti! Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, appaṭiññāya bhikkhūnaṃ kammaṃ kātabbaṃ – tajjanīyaṃ vā, niyassaṃ vā, pabbājanīyaṃ vā, paṭisāraṇīyaṃ vā, ukkhepanīyaṃ vā. Yo kareyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa.

200."At that time, the bhikkhus of the group of six carried out formal acts against bhikkhus without acknowledgment—an act of censure, an act of subjection, an act of banishment, an act of reconciliation, and an act of suspension. Those bhikkhus who were modest ... complained, murmured, and criticized: ‘How can the bhikkhus of the group of six carry out formal acts against bhikkhus without acknowledgment—an act of censure, an act of subjection, an act of banishment, an act of reconciliation, and an act of suspension?’ Then those bhikkhus reported the matter to the Blessed One. ... ‘Is it true, bhikkhus, that...?’ ‘It is true, Blessed One.’ ... Having rebuked them... the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the bhikkhus: ‘Bhikkhus, a formal act should not be carried out against bhikkhus without acknowledgment—whether it be an act of censure, an act of subjection, an act of banishment, an act of reconciliation, or an act of suspension. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong conduct.’"

201."Thus, bhikkhus, the procedure of acknowledgment is unlawful, and thus lawful. And how, bhikkhus, is the procedure of acknowledgment unlawful?"

202.Now at that time, monks in the midst of the Sangha were quarreling, disputing, and arguing, wounding each other with verbal weapons. They were unable to settle that dispute. They informed the Blessed One of the matter. "Monks, I allow such a dispute to be settled by majority decision. A monk who is to be appointed as a vote-taker should possess five qualities: he should not act out of favoritism, hostility, delusion, or fear, and he should know what has and has not been taken up. And, monks, he should be appointed like this. First, a monk should be asked. Having been asked, a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:

203. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ salākaggāhāpakaṃ sammanneyya. Esā ñatti.

203."Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. If it seems right to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint the bhikkhu named so-and-so as the vote-taker. This is the motion."

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ salākaggāhāpakaṃ sammannati. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa bhikkhuno salākaggāhāpakassa sammuti, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

"Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. The Sangha appoints the monk named so-and-so as the vote-taker. If the appointment of the monk named so-and-so as vote-taker is agreeable to any venerable one, let him remain silent; if it is not agreeable to anyone, he should speak."

‘‘Sammato saṅghena itthannāmo bhikkhu salākaggāhāpako. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

"The monk named so-and-so has been appointed by the Sangha as the vote-taker. It is agreeable to the Sangha, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it."

204. ‘‘Dasayime, bhikkhave, adhammikā salākaggāhā, dasa dhammikā [dasa dhammikā salākaggāhā (ka.)]. Katame dasa adhammikā salākaggāhā? Oramattakañca adhikaraṇaṃ hoti, na ca gatigataṃ hoti, na ca saritasāritaṃ hoti, jānāti adhammavādī bahutarāti, appeva nāma adhammavādī bahutarā assūti, jānāti saṅgho bhijjissatīti, appeva nāma saṅgho bhijjeyyāti, adhammena gaṇhanti, vaggā gaṇhanti, na ca yathādiṭṭhiyā gaṇhanti – ime dasa adhammikā salākaggāhā.

204."Monks, these are ten unrighteous ways of taking votes and ten righteous ways. What are the ten unrighteous ways of taking votes? The dispute is minor; it has not been thoroughly investigated; it has not been thoroughly reviewed; one knows the unrighteous speakers are in the majority; thinking, ‘Perhaps the unrighteous speakers will be in the majority;’ one knows the Sangha will split; thinking, ‘Perhaps the Sangha will split;’ they take the votes unrighteously; they take the votes by faction; and they do not take the votes according to their own view—these are the ten unrighteous ways of taking votes."

‘‘Katame dasa dhammikā salākaggāhā? Na ca oramattakaṃ adhikaraṇaṃ hoti, gatigatañca hoti, saritasāritañca hoti, jānāti dhammavādī bahutarāti, appeva nāma dhammavādī bahutarā assūti, jānāti saṅgho na bhijjissatīti, appeva nāma saṅgho na bhijjeyyāti, dhammena gaṇhanti, samaggā gaṇhanti, yathādiṭṭhiyā ca gaṇhanti – ime dasa dhammikā salākaggāhā’’ti.

"What are the ten righteous ways of taking votes? The dispute is not minor; it has been thoroughly investigated; it has been thoroughly reviewed; one knows the righteous speakers are in the majority; thinking, ‘Perhaps the righteous speakers will be in the majority;’ one knows the Sangha will not split; thinking, ‘Perhaps the Sangha will not split;’ they take the votes righteously; they take the votes in unity; and they take the votes according to their own view—these are the ten righteous ways of taking votes."

6.Transaction for Further Punishment

205. Tena kho pana samayena upavāḷo bhikkhu saṅghamajjhe āpattiyā anuyuñjiyamāno avajānitvā paṭijānāti, paṭijānitvā avajānāti, aññenaññaṃ paṭicarati, sampajānamusā bhāsati.

Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – tena hi, bhikkhave, saṅgho upavāḷassa bhikkhuno tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ karotu. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, kātabbaṃ. Paṭhamaṃ upavāḷo bhikkhu codetabbo, codetvā sāretabbo, sāretvā āpattiṃ āropetabbo, āpattiṃ āropetvā byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

205.Now at that time the monk Upavāḷa, being questioned in the midst of the Sangha about an offense, would acknowledge it without acknowledging it, and after acknowledging it, would disavow it, prevaricate, and knowingly speak falsely. The monks who were modest... criticized and complained: "How can the monk Upavāḷa, being questioned in the midst of the Sangha about an offense, acknowledge it without acknowledging it, and after acknowledging it, disavow it, prevaricate, and knowingly speak falsely?" Then those monks informed the Blessed One of the matter... "Is it true, monks...?" "It is true, Blessed One."... Having rebuked him... the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: "Well then, monks, let the Sangha carry out the transaction for further punishment against the monk Upavāḷa. And this is how, monks, it should be done. First, the monk Upavāḷa should be charged, then reminded, then the offense should be established against him, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:

206. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ upavāḷo bhikkhu saṅghamajjhe āpattiyā anuyuñjiyamāno avajānitvā paṭijānāti, paṭijānitvā avajānāti, aññenaññaṃ paṭicarati, sampajānamusā ‘bhāsati. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho upavāḷassa bhikkhuno tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ kareyya. Esā ñatti.

206."Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. This monk Upavāḷa, being questioned in the midst of the Sangha about an offense, acknowledges it without acknowledging it, and after acknowledging it, disavows it, prevaricates, and knowingly speaks falsely. If it seems right to the Sangha, the Sangha should carry out the transaction for further punishment against the monk Upavāḷa. This is the motion."

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ upavāḷo bhikkhu saṅghamajjhe āpattiyā anuyuñjiyamāno avajānitvā paṭijānāti, paṭijānitvā avajānāti, aññenaññaṃ paṭicarati, sampajānamusā bhāsati. Saṅgho upavāḷassa bhikkhuno tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ karoti. Yassāyasmato khamati upavāḷassa bhikkhuno tassapāpiyasikākammassa karaṇaṃ, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

"Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. This monk Upavāḷa, being questioned in the midst of the Sangha about an offense, acknowledges it without acknowledging it, and after acknowledging it, disavows it, equivocates, and knowingly speaks falsely. The Sangha carries out the transaction for further punishment against the monk Upavāḷa. If the carrying out of the transaction for further punishment against the monk Upavāḷa is agreeable to any venerable one, let him remain silent; if it is not agreeable to anyone, he should speak."

‘‘Dutiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi…pe… tatiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi…pe….

"For a second time I state this... For a third time I state this..."

‘‘Kataṃ saṅghena upavāḷassa bhikkhuno tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

"The Sangha has carried out the transaction for further punishment against the monk Upavāḷa. It is agreeable to the Sangha, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it."

207. ‘‘Pañcimāni, bhikkhave, dhammikāni tassapāpiyasikākammassa karaṇāni. Asuci ca hoti, alajjī ca, sānuvādo ca, tassa saṅgho tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ karoti dhammena, samaggena – imāni kho, bhikkhave, pañca dhammikāni tassapāpiyasikākammassa karaṇāni.

207.Monks, there are these five righteous grounds for carrying out the transaction for further punishment. He is impure, shameless, and open to rebuke. The Sangha carries out the transaction for further punishment against him righteously, in unity—these, monks, are the five righteous grounds for carrying out the transaction for further punishment.

Adhammakammadvādasakaṃ

The Section on Twelve Unlawful Acts

208. ‘‘Tīhi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgataṃ tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ adhammakammañca hoti, avinayakammañca, duvūpasantañca. Asammukhā kataṃ hoti, appaṭipucchākataṃ hoti, appaṭiññāya kataṃ hoti…pe… adhammena kataṃ hoti, vaggena kataṃ hoti – imehi kho, bhikkhave, tīhaṅgehi samannāgataṃ tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ adhammakammañca hoti, avinayakammañca, duvūpasantañca.

208.Monks, a tassapāpiyasikā-kamma possessed of three factors is an unlawful act, a non-disciplinary act, and badly settled. It is done in absence, without questioning, without acknowledgment; it is done unlawfully, by a faction. These, monks, are the three factors by which a tassapāpiyasikā-kamma is an unlawful act, a non-disciplinary act, and badly settled.

Dhammakammadvādasakaṃ

The Section on Twelve Lawful Acts

209. ‘‘Tīhi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgataṃ tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ dhammakammañca hoti, vinayakammañca, suvūpasantañca. Sammukhā kataṃ hoti, paṭipucchākataṃ hoti, paṭiññāya kataṃ hoti…pe… dhammena kataṃ hoti, samaggena kataṃ hoti – imehi kho, bhikkhave, tīhaṅgehi samannāgataṃ tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ dhammakammañca hoti, vinayakammañca, suvūpasantañca.

209.Monks, a tassapāpiyasikā-kamma possessed of three factors is a lawful act, a Vinaya act, and well-settled. It is done in presence, with questioning, with acknowledgment; it is done according to the Dhamma, by a united Sangha. These, monks, are the three factors by which a tassapāpiyasikā-kamma is a lawful act, a Vinaya act, and well-settled.

Ākaṅkhamānachakkaṃ

The Section on Six Cases Where the Sangha May Wish to Act

210. ‘‘Tīhi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno ākaṅkhamāno saṅgho tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ kareyya. Bhaṇḍanakārako hoti kalahakārako vivādakārako bhassakārako saṅghe adhikaraṇakārako; bālo hoti abyatto āpattibahulo anapadāno; gihisaṃsaṭṭho viharati ananulomikehi gihisaṃsaggehi – imehi kho, bhikkhave, tīhaṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno ākaṅkhamāno saṅgho tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ kareyya.

210.Monks, the Sangha, if it wishes, may impose a tassapāpiyasikā-kamma on a bhikkhu possessed of three factors. He is a quarrelsome person, a contentious person, a disputatious person, a wrangling person, one who creates legal issues in the Sangha; he is foolish, incompetent, frequently commits offenses, and is not capable of expiation; he lives in close association with householders through unsuitable connections with householders. These, monks, are the three factors by which the Sangha, if it wishes, may impose a tassapāpiyasikā-kamma on that bhikkhu.

‘‘Aparehipi, bhikkhave, tīhaṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno ākaṅkhamāno saṅgho tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ kareyya. Adhisīle sīlavipanno hoti, ajjhācāre ācāravipanno hoti, atidiṭṭhiyā diṭṭhivipanno hoti – imehi kho, bhikkhave…pe….

Furthermore, monks, the Sangha, if it wishes, may impose a tassapāpiyasikā-kamma on a bhikkhu possessed of three other factors. He is deficient in higher virtue, deficient in conduct, and deficient in views. These, monks, are the three factors by which the Sangha, if it wishes, may impose a tassapāpiyasikā-kamma on that bhikkhu.

‘‘Aparehipi, bhikkhave…pe… buddhassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati, dhammassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati, saṅghassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati – imehi kho, bhikkhave, tīhaṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno ākaṅkhamāno saṅgho tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ kareyya.

Furthermore, monks, the Sangha, if it wishes, may impose a tassapāpiyasikā-kamma on a bhikkhu possessed of three other factors. He speaks in dispraise of the Buddha, speaks in dispraise of the Dhamma, speaks in dispraise of the Sangha. These, monks, are the three factors by which the Sangha, if it wishes, may impose a tassapāpiyasikā-kamma on that bhikkhu.

‘‘Tiṇṇaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhūnaṃ ākaṅkhamāno saṅgho tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ kareyya. Eko bhaṇḍanakārako hoti…pe… saṅghe adhikaraṇakārako; eko bālo hoti abyatto āpattibahulo anapadāno; eko gihisaṃsaṭṭho viharati ananulomikehi gihisaṃsaggehi – imesaṃ kho, bhikkhave, tiṇṇaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ ākaṅkhamāno saṅgho tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ kareyya.

Monks, the Sangha, if it wishes, may impose a tassapāpiyasikā-kamma on three bhikkhus. One is a quarrelsome person, a contentious person, a disputatious person, a wrangling person, one who creates legal issues in the Sangha; one is foolish, incompetent, frequently commits offenses, and is not capable of expiation; one lives in close association with householders through unsuitable connections with householders. For these three bhikkhus, monks, the Sangha, if it wishes, may impose a tassapāpiyasikā-kamma.

‘‘Aparesampi, bhikkhave, tiṇṇaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ ākaṅkhamāno saṅgho tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ kareyya. Eko adhisīle sīlavipanno hoti, eko ajjhācāre ācāravipanno hoti, eko atidiṭṭhiyā diṭṭhivipanno hoti – imesaṃ kho, bhikkhave…pe….

Furthermore, monks, the Sangha, if it wishes, may impose a tassapāpiyasikā-kamma on another three bhikkhus. One is deficient in higher virtue, one is deficient in conduct, and one is deficient in view. For these three bhikkhus, monks, the Sangha, if it wishes, may impose a tassapāpiyasikā-kamma.

‘‘Aparesampi, bhikkhave…pe… eko buddhassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati, eko dhammassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati, eko saṅghassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati – imesaṃ kho, bhikkhave, tiṇṇaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ ākaṅkhamāno saṅgho tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ kareyya.

Furthermore, monks, the Sangha, if it wishes, may impose a tassapāpiyasikā-kamma on another three bhikkhus. One speaks in dispraise of the Buddha, one speaks in dispraise of the Dhamma, one speaks in dispraise of the Sangha. For these three bhikkhus, monks, the Sangha, if it wishes, may impose a tassapāpiyasikā-kamma.

Aṭṭhārasavattaṃ

The Section on the Eighteen Duties

211. ‘‘Tassapāpiyasikākammakatena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā sammā vattitabbaṃ. Tatrāyaṃ sammāvattanā –

211.Monks, a bhikkhu on whom a tassapāpiyasikā-kamma has been imposed should conduct himself properly. Herein is the proper conduct:

Na upasampādetabbaṃ, na nissayo dātabbo, na sāmaṇero upaṭṭhāpetabbo, na bhikkhunovādakasammuti sāditabbā, sammatenapi bhikkhuniyo na ovaditabbā…pe… na bhikkhūhi sampayojetabba’’nti. Atha kho saṅgho upavāḷassa bhikkhuno tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ akāsi.

He should not give higher ordination; nor should he give dependence; nor should he have a novice attend on him; nor should he accept authorization to instruct bhikkhunīs; even if authorized, he should not instruct bhikkhunīs; ... nor should he associate with bhikkhus. Then the Sangha imposed a tassapāpiyasikā-kamma on the bhikkhu Upavāḷa.

Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

212.Now at that time, monks who were living in quarrels, disputes, and contentions had habitually done much that was unascetic and much that was spoken amiss. Then those monks thought: "While we are living in quarrels, disputes, and contentions, we have habitually done much that is unascetic and much that is spoken amiss. If we were to cause each other to incur these offenses, that legal matter might lead to harshness, violence, and schism. How should we proceed?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One.

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhūnaṃ bhaṇḍanajātānaṃ kalahajātānaṃ vivādāpannānaṃ viharataṃ bahuṃ assāmaṇakaṃ ajjhāciṇṇaṃ hoti bhāsitaparikkantaṃ.

If it occurs to the monks, 'While we are living in quarrels, disputes, and contentions, much that is unascetic has been habitually done and much that is spoken amiss; if we were to cause each other to incur these offenses, that legal matter might lead to harshness, violence, and schism,' then, monks, I allow such a legal matter to be settled by the covering-over with grass. And this is how it should be settled, monks. All should assemble together. Having assembled, a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Amhākaṃ bhaṇḍanajātānaṃ kalahajātānaṃ vivādāpannānaṃ viharataṃ bahuṃ assāmaṇakaṃ ajjhāciṇṇaṃ bhāsitaparikkantaṃ.

If we were to cause each other to incur these offenses, that legal matter might lead to harshness, violence, and schism. If it is agreeable to the Sangha, may the Sangha settle this legal matter by the covering-over with grass, excluding grave offenses and offenses connected with laypersons." "Then, a competent and capable monk of one faction should inform his own faction—

“Monks, there are these four kinds of legal issues: an issue concerning disputes, an issue concerning accusations, an issue concerning offenses, and an issue concerning procedures.

‘‘Tattha katamaṃ vivādādhikaraṇaṃ [pari. 314]? Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhū [bhikkhū bhikkhuṃ (ka.)] vivadanti – dhammoti vā adhammoti vā, vinayoti vā avinayoti vā, bhāsitaṃ lapitaṃ tathāgatenāti vā abhāsitaṃ alapitaṃ tathāgatenāti vā, āciṇṇaṃ tathāgatenāti vā anāciṇṇaṃ tathāgatenāti vā, paññattaṃ tathāgatenāti vā appaññattaṃ tathāgatenāti vā, āpattīti vā anāpattīti vā, lahukā āpattīti vā garukā āpattīti vā, sāvasesā āpattīti vā anavasesā āpattīti vā, duṭṭhullā āpattīti vā aduṭṭhullā āpattīti vā?

“And what is an issue concerning disputes? Here, monks, monks dispute: ‘This is the Dhamma’ or ‘This is not the Dhamma,’ ‘This is the Vinaya’ or ‘This is not the Vinaya,’ ‘This was spoken by the Tathāgata’ or ‘This was not spoken by the Tathāgata,’ ‘This was practiced by the Tathāgata’ or ‘This was not practiced by the Tathāgata,’ ‘This was laid down by the Tathāgata’ or ‘This was not laid down by the Tathāgata,’ ‘This is an offense’ or ‘This is not an offense,’ ‘This is a light offense’ or ‘This is a grave offense,’ ‘This is an offense with residue’ or ‘This is an offense without residue,’ ‘This is a serious offense’ or ‘This is not a serious offense.’ Whatever bickering, quarrel, opposition, dispute, difference of opinion, misstatement, hostile speech, or contention arises concerning this—this is called an issue concerning disputes.

‘‘Tattha katamaṃ anuvādādhikaraṇaṃ? [pari. 315] Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhū bhikkhuṃ anuvadanti sīlavipattiyā vā ācāravipattiyā vā diṭṭhivipattiyā vā ājīvavipattiyā vā. Yo tattha anuvādo anuvadanā anullapanā anubhaṇanā anusampavaṅkatā abbhussahanatā anubalappadānaṃ – idaṃ vuccati anuvādādhikaraṇaṃ.

“And what is an issue concerning accusation? Here, monks, monks accuse a monk of failure in virtue, failure in conduct, failure in view, or failure in livelihood. Whatever accusation, charging, disparagement, denigration, browbeating, insistence, or support for one's own side occurs in this—this is called an issue concerning accusation.

‘‘Tattha katamaṃ āpattādhikaraṇaṃ? Pañcapi āpattikkhandhā āpattādhikaraṇaṃ, sattapi āpattikkhandhā āpattādhikaraṇaṃ – idaṃ vuccati āpattādhikaraṇaṃ.

“And what is an issue concerning offenses? The five categories of offenses and the seven categories of offenses—this is called an issue concerning offenses.”

‘‘Tattha katamaṃ kiccādhikaraṇaṃ? [pari. 317] Yā saṅghassa kiccayatā, karaṇīyatā, apalokanakammaṃ, ñattikammaṃ, ñattidutiyakammaṃ, ñatticatutthakammaṃ – idaṃ vuccati kiccādhikaraṇaṃ.

“And what is an issue concerning procedures? Whatever pertains to the Sangha's business, what is to be done, an act of declaration, a motion-only act, a motion-and-one-announcement act, or a motion-and-three-announcement act—this is called an issue concerning procedures.

216.“What is the root of an issue concerning disputes? Six roots of disputes are the root of an issue concerning disputes. The three unwholesome roots are the root of an issue concerning disputes, and the three wholesome roots are also the root of an issue concerning disputes. What are the six roots of disputes that are the root of an issue concerning disputes? Here, monks, a monk is angry and bearing grudges. A monk who is angry and bearing grudges dwells disrespectfully and irreverently toward the Teacher, disrespectfully and irreverently toward the Dhamma, disrespectfully and irreverently toward the Sangha, and is not a fulfiller of the training. A monk who dwells disrespectfully and irreverently toward the Teacher, disrespectfully and irreverently toward the Dhamma, disrespectfully and irreverently toward the Sangha, and is not a fulfiller of the training, gives rise to disputes in the Sangha. That dispute leads to the harm and unhappiness of many people, to the disadvantage, harm, and suffering of gods and humans. If, monks, you see such a root of dispute either internally or externally, you should strive to abandon that evil root of dispute. If, monks, you do not see such a root of dispute either internally or externally, you should practice so that this evil root of dispute does not arise in the future. Thus, the abandoning of this evil root of dispute occurs. Thus, the non-arising of this evil root of dispute in the future occurs.”

[pari.272] ‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu makkhī hoti paḷāsī…pe… issukī hoti maccharī, saṭho hoti māyāvī, pāpiccho hoti micchādiṭṭhī, sandiṭṭhiparāmāsī hoti ādhānaggāhī duppaṭinissaggī.

“Furthermore, monks, a monk is angry and resentful… he is envious and selfish, deceitful and scheming, has evil desires and wrong views, and is attached to his own views, stubbornly adhering to them and unwilling to relinquish them. A monk who is attached to his own views, stubbornly adhering to them and unwilling to relinquish them, dwells without reverence and respect for the Teacher, without reverence and respect for the Dhamma, without reverence and respect for the Sangha, and is not a complete fulfiller of the training. A monk who dwells without reverence and respect for the Teacher, without reverence and respect for the Dhamma, without reverence and respect for the Sangha, and is not a complete fulfiller of the training, generates disputes in the Sangha. Such a dispute leads to the harm of many people, to the unhappiness of many people, to the detriment and sorrow of many people, of gods and humans. If, monks, you perceive such a root of dispute within yourselves or externally, you should strive to abandon that evil root of dispute. If, monks, you do not perceive such a root of dispute within yourselves or externally, you should practice so that this evil root of dispute does not arise in the future. Thus is the abandoning of this evil root of dispute. Thus is the non-arising of this evil root of dispute in the future. These are six roots of dispute, the basis of an issue concerning disputes.”

But if, bhikkhus, while the resident bhikkhus are deliberating, it occurs to them: ‘We are capable of settling this legal issue according to the Dhamma, the Discipline, and the Teacher’s instruction,’ then those resident bhikkhus should say to the visiting bhikkhus: ‘If you, Venerables, report this legal issue to us just as it arose and came about, and just as we will settle this legal issue according to the Dhamma, the Discipline, and the Teacher’s instruction, in such a way that it will be well-settled, then we will accept this legal issue.

If you, Venerable Sirs, are capable of settling this legal issue within such and such a time according to the Dhamma, the Vinaya, and the Teacher’s instruction in such a way that it will be well-settled, then we will hand over this legal issue to you, Venerable Sirs.

231.“Monks, if, while those monks are settling that legal issue, endless discussions arise and the meaning of even a single statement is not understood, I allow, monks, such a legal issue to be settled by ad hoc arbitration. A monk endowed with ten qualities should be appointed for ad hoc arbitration: He is virtuous, restrained by the restraint of the Pāṭimokkha, perfect in conduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults, and he trains himself by undertaking the training rules. He is learned, a preserver of the teachings, a storehouse of the teachings. Those teachings which are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life—teachings such as these he has learned much, retained, accumulated, considered verbally, examined mentally, and penetrated well by view. Moreover, both Pāṭimokkhas are thoroughly learned by him in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well determined in terms of the suttas and their subsidiary meanings. He is firm in the discipline and not prone to wavering. He is capable of reassuring, convincing, persuading, satisfying, and pleasing both sides. He is skilled in the arising and settling of legal issues. He knows what a legal issue is. He knows the origin of a legal issue. He knows the cessation of a legal issue. He knows the way leading to the cessation of a legal issue. I allow, monks, a monk endowed with these ten qualities to be appointed for ad hoc arbitration. And this is how, monks, he should be appointed. First, a monk should be invited. Having been invited, a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:

232. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Amhākaṃ imasmiṃ adhikaraṇe vinicchiyamāne anantāni ceva bhassāni jāyanti, na cekassa bhāsitassa attho viññāyati. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmañca itthannāmañca bhikkhuṃ sammanneyya ubbāhikāya imaṃ adhikaraṇaṃ vūpasametuṃ. Esā ñatti.

I allow, monks, such a dispute to be settled by the decision by majority. A monk who is to be appointed as a ballot taker should possess five qualities: he should not proceed through favoritism, not proceed through ill will, not proceed through delusion, not proceed through fear, and he should know what has been taken and what has not been taken… And thus, monks, he should be appointed. First, a monk should be requested; having been requested, an experienced and competent monk should inform the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ salākaggāhāpakaṃ sammanneyya. Esā ñatti.

"Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. If the Sangha is ready, the Sangha should appoint the monk named so-and-so as the ballot collector. This is the motion."

"That monk appointed as the ballot distributor should distribute the ballots. The dispute should be settled according to the majority of monks who speak according to the Dhamma. This is called, monks, a settled dispute. By what is it settled? By the decision in the presence and by the decision by majority. And what is the decision in the presence in this case? The presence of the Sangha, the presence of the Dhamma, the presence of the Vinaya, and the presence of the individuals. And what is the presence of the Sangha here? As many monks as are entitled to participate in the act have come, the consent of those entitled to give consent has been obtained, and those present do not object—this is the presence of the Sangha here. And what is the presence of the Dhamma and the Vinaya here? The dispute is settled by the Dhamma, by the Vinaya, by the Teacher’s instruction—this is the presence of the Dhamma and the Vinaya here. And what is the presence of the individuals here? Both the one who disputes and the one with whom he disputes are present face-to-face—this is the presence of the individuals here. And what is the decision by majority here? The performance and acceptance of the decision by majority, without objection—this is the decision by majority here. Monks, if the one who caused the dispute reopens a dispute settled in this way, there is an offense of expiation for reopening; the one who gave consent is annoyed, there is an offense of expiation for being annoyed."

235.At that time, a dispute arose in Sāvatthī. Then those monks—dissatisfied with the Sangha’s settlement of the dispute in Sāvatthī—heard that in such and such a monastery many elder monks were staying: learned, versed in tradition, upholders of the Dhamma, upholders of the Vinaya, upholders of the outlines, wise, experienced, intelligent, conscientious, scrupulous, and desirous of training. "If those elders would settle this dispute according to the Dhamma, the Vinaya, and the Teacher’s instruction, then this dispute would be well-settled." Then those monks went to that monastery and said to those elders, "Venerable sirs, this dispute has arisen. Venerable sirs, may the elders settle this dispute according to the Dhamma, the Vinaya, and the Teacher’s instruction, so that this dispute may be well-settled." Then those elders—thinking, "As the dispute was settled by the Sangha in Sāvatthī, so it is well-settled"—settled the dispute in that way.

Atha kho te bhikkhū – asantuṭṭhā sāvatthiyā saṅghassa adhikaraṇavūpasamanena, asantuṭṭhā sambahulānaṃ therānaṃ adhikaraṇavūpasamanena – assosuṃ kho amukasmiṃ kira āvāse tayo therā viharanti…pe… dve therā viharanti…pe… eko thero viharati bahussuto āgatāgamo dhammadharo vinayadharo mātikādharo paṇḍito viyatto medhāvī lajjī kukkuccako sikkhākāmo.

Then those monks—dissatisfied with the Sangha’s settlement of the dispute at Sāvatthī, dissatisfied with the settlement by several senior monks—heard that in a certain monastery three senior monks were staying… two senior monks were staying… one senior monk was staying: learned, a master of the tradition, an expert on the Dhamma, the Vinaya, and the outlines; wise, competent, intelligent, conscientious, scrupulous, and eager for training. If that senior monk were to settle this dispute in accordance with the Dhamma, the Vinaya, and the Teacher’s instructions, then this dispute would be properly settled. Then those monks went to that monastery and said to that senior monk, “Venerable, this dispute has arisen in such-and-such a way. Please, Venerable, settle this dispute in accordance with the Dhamma, the Vinaya, and the Teacher’s instructions, so that this dispute may be properly settled.” Then that senior monk—just as the Sangha at Sāvatthī had settled the dispute, just as several senior monks had settled it, just as three senior monks had settled it, just as two senior monks had settled it—settled that dispute in the same way, deeming it properly settled.

Atha kho te bhikkhū asantuṭṭhā sāvatthiyā saṅghassa adhikaraṇavūpasamanena, asantuṭṭhā sambahulānaṃ therānaṃ adhikaraṇavūpasamanena, asantuṭṭhā tiṇṇaṃ therānaṃ adhikaraṇavūpasamanena, asantuṭṭhā dvinnaṃ therānaṃ adhikaraṇavūpasamanena, asantuṭṭhā ekassa therassa adhikaraṇavūpasamanena, yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘nihatametaṃ, bhikkhave, adhikaraṇaṃ santaṃ vūpasantaṃ suvūpasantaṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, tesaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ saññattiyā tayo salākaggāhe – gūḷhakaṃ, sakaṇṇajappakaṃ, vivaṭakaṃ.

Then those monks—being dissatisfied with the Sangha’s settlement of the dispute at Sāvatthī, dissatisfied with the settlement by several senior monks, dissatisfied with the settlement by three senior monks, dissatisfied with the settlement by two senior monks, dissatisfied with the settlement by one senior monk—went to the Blessed One, approached him, and informed him of this matter… “Monks, this dispute has been suppressed, calmed, thoroughly calmed. I allow, monks, for those monks, three ways of taking ballots by declaration: secret, whisper-in-the-ear, and open."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, gūḷhako salākaggāho hoti? Tena salākaggāhāpakena bhikkhunā salākāyo vaṇṇāvaṇṇāyo katvā ekameko bhikkhu upasaṅkamitvā evamassa vacanīyo – ‘ayaṃ evaṃvādissa salākā, ayaṃ evaṃvādissa salākā. Yaṃ icchasi taṃ gaṇhāhī’ti. Gahite vattabbo – ‘mā ca kassaci dassehī’ti. Sace jānāti – adhammavādī bahutarāti, duggahoti, paccukkaḍḍhitabbaṃ. Sace jānāti – dhammavādī bahutarāti, suggahoti, sāvetabbaṃ. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, gūḷhako salākaggāho hoti.

“And how, monks, is a secret ballot held? The monk appointed to hold the ballot should prepare voting slips of different colors, approach each monk individually, and say to him, ‘This slip is for those who say such-and-such, this slip for those who say such-and-such. Take whichever you prefer.’ When it has been taken, he should say, ‘Don’t show it to anyone.’ If he knows that those who speak against the Dhamma are in the majority, it is a bad vote and should be withdrawn. If he knows that those who speak in accordance with the Dhamma are in the majority, it is a good vote and should be announced. That, monks, is how a secret ballot is held.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, sakaṇṇajappako salākaggāho hoti? Tena salākaggāhāpakena bhikkhunā ekamekassa bhikkhuno upakaṇṇake ārocetabbaṃ – ‘ayaṃ evaṃvādissa salākā, ayaṃ evaṃvādissa salākā. Yaṃ icchasi taṃ gaṇhāhī’ti. Gahite vattabbo – ‘mā ca kassaci ārocehī’ti. Sace jānāti – adhammavādī bahutarāti, duggahoti, paccukkaḍḍhitabbaṃ. Sace jānāti – dhammavādī bahutarāti, suggahoti, sāvetabbaṃ. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, sakaṇṇajappako salākaggāho hoti.

“And how, monks, does a whispered ballot take place? The monk appointed to take the ballot should announce in the ear of each individual monk: ‘This slip is for those who say such-and-such, this slip is for those who say such-and-such. Take whichever you prefer.’ When it has been taken, he should say, ‘Don’t tell anyone.’ If he knows that those who speak contrary to the Dhamma are the majority, then it is badly taken and should be withdrawn. If he knows that those who speak according to the Dhamma are the majority, then it is well taken and should be announced. That, monks, is how a whispered ballot takes place.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, vivaṭako salākaggāho hoti? Sace jānāti – dhammavādī bahutarāti, vissaṭṭheneva vivaṭena gāhetabbo. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, vivaṭako salākaggāho hoti. Ime kho, bhikkhave, tayo salākaggāhā’’ti.

"And how, monks, is an open ballot held? If one knows, 'The majority are proponents of the Dhamma,' then the ballot should be taken openly, without concealment. Thus, monks, is an open ballot held. These, monks, are the three ways of taking a ballot."

Sativinayo

The Verdict of Mindfulness

236. [pari. 292-293, 307 ādayo] ‘‘Anuvādādhikaraṇaṃ katihi samathehi sammati?

236.“By how many means of settlement is a dispute concerning accusation resolved? A dispute concerning accusation is resolved by four means of settlement: by settlement in the presence, by the verdict of mindfulness, by the verdict of past insanity, and by covering over the offense. Could a dispute concerning accusation be settled without resorting to two means—the verdict of past insanity and covering over the offense—and instead be settled by two means: settlement in the presence and the verdict of mindfulness? It could indeed be so. How so? Here, monks, monks accuse a monk of a groundless breach of morality. For that monk, monks, who has attained fullness of mindfulness, a verdict of mindfulness should be granted. And how, monks, should it be granted?”

‘‘Tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā saṅghaṃ upasaṅkamitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅga karitvā…pe… evamassa vacanīyo – ‘maṃ, bhante, bhikkhū amūlikāya sīlavipattiyā anuddhaṃsenti.

“Therefore, monks, a monk should approach the Saṅgha, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder [...] and speak thus: ‘Venerable sirs, the monks are disparaging me with a groundless charge of moral failure. I, venerable sirs, having attained fullness of mindfulness, request of the Saṅgha a verdict of mindfulness.’ A second time he should request. A third time he should request. A competent monk should then inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Bhikkhū itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ amūlikāya sīlavipattiyā anuddhaṃsenti. So sativepullappatto saṅghaṃ sativinayaṃ yācati. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmassa bhikkhuno sativepullappattassa sativinayaṃ dadeyya. Esā ñatti.

“The Saṅgha has granted the verdict of mindfulness to the monk named so-and-so, who has attained fullness of mindfulness. The Saṅgha approves of it, and therefore is silent. Thus I remember it.”

‘‘Idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, adhikaraṇaṃ vūpasantaṃ. Kena vūpasantaṃ? Sammukhāvinayena ca sativinayena ca. Kiñca tattha sammukhāvinayasmiṃ?

“This, monks, is called a dispute that has been settled. By what is it settled? By settlement in the presence and by the verdict of mindfulness. And what, in this case, is settlement in the presence? The presence of the Saṅgha, the presence of the Dhamma, the presence of the Vinaya, the presence of the individual [...]. And what, in this case, is the presence of the individual? Both the one who accuses and the one who is accused are present—this, in this case, is the presence of the individual. And what, in this case, is the verdict of mindfulness? The doing, the performance, the undertaking, the acceptance, the full acceptance, the non-rejection of the act of the verdict of mindfulness—this is the verdict of mindfulness in this case. If, monks, after a dispute has been thus settled, the instigator reopens it, there is an offense entailing expiation for reopening it. If the one who gave his approval is discontented, there is an offense entailing expiation for being discontented.”

Amūḷhavinayo

Procedure for the Undeluded

237."Could a disciplinary issue involving accusations be settled without resorting to two methods of resolution—namely, the resolution through recollection and the resolution through acknowledgement of guilt—and instead be settled by two other methods: resolution face-to-face and the procedure for the undeluded? It could indeed be said so. How is that? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes insane, his mind deranged. Due to that insanity and mental derangement, he often committed many unascetic deeds and spoke disordered words. The bhikkhus accuse him of an offense incurred while he was insane and deranged, saying, ‘Venerable, do you recall incurring such an offense?’ He replies, ‘Friends, I was insane, my mind deranged. Due to that insanity and mental derangement, I committed many unascetic deeds and spoke disordered words. I do not recall them. This was done by me while deluded.’ Even when spoken to thus, they continue accusing him, saying, ‘Venerable, do you recall incurring such an offense?’ For that bhikkhu, bhikkhus, who is undeluded, the procedure for the undeluded should be applied. And it should be applied like this:

‘‘Tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā saṅghaṃ upasaṅkamitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā…pe… evamassa vacanīyo – ‘ahaṃ, bhante, ummattako ahosiṃ cittavipariyāsakato.

This was done by me in delusion.” Even when I say this, they continue to accuse me, saying, “Does the venerable one remember incurring such an offense?” Venerable sirs, now that I am undeluded, I ask the Sangha for the procedure for the undeluded.’ A second time it should be asked. A third time it should be asked. A competent and capable bhikkhu should inform the Sangha:

238."Could a legal issue concerning accusation be settled without resorting to two means of settlement—namely, the verdict of mindfulness and the verdict of non-delusion—and instead be resolved by two means of settlement: the verdict in the presence of and the act of making him more wicked? It could be, this should be said. How so? Here, monks, a monk accuses another monk in the midst of the Saṅgha regarding a grave offense: ‘Venerable, do you recall having committed such a grave offense, a pārājika or one bordering on a pārājika?’ He replies, ‘No, friend, I do not recall having committed such a grave offense, a pārājika or one bordering on a pārājika.’ The accuser then presses him further while he is trying to evade: ‘Come, venerable, reflect carefully—do you recall having committed such a grave offense, a pārājika or one bordering on a pārājika?’ He replies, ‘No, friend, I do not recall having committed such a grave offense, a pārājika or one bordering on a pārājika. But I do recall, friend, having committed a minor offense.’ The accuser presses him further while he is trying to evade: ‘Come, venerable, reflect carefully—do you recall having committed such a grave offense, a pārājika or one bordering on a pārājika?’ He replies, ‘Indeed, I would admit to having committed a minor offense even when not asked. How then could I not admit to having committed such a grave offense, a pārājika or one bordering on a pārājika, when asked?’ The accuser says, ‘Indeed, you would not admit to having committed a minor offense even when not asked. How then could you admit to having committed such a grave offense, a pārājika or one bordering on a pārājika, when not asked? Come, venerable, reflect carefully—do you recall having committed such a grave offense, a pārājika or one bordering on a pārājika?’ He then says, ‘I do recall, friend, having committed such a grave offense, a pārājika or one bordering on a pārājika. But I spoke in haste, I spoke in a muddled way—I do not recall having committed such a grave offense, a pārājika or one bordering on a pārājika.’ In this case, monks, the act of making him more wicked should be performed against that monk. And it should be performed as follows: A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante saṅgho. Ayaṃ itthannāmo bhikkhu saṅghamajjhe garukāya āpattiyā anuyuñjiyamāno avajānitvā paṭijānāti, paṭijānitvā avajānāti, aññenāññaṃ paṭicarati, sampajānamusā bhāsati. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmassa bhikkhuno tassapāpiyasikākammaṃ kareyya. Esā ñatti.

"Venerable Saṅgha, please listen to me. This monk, named so-and-so, being questioned in the midst of the Saṅgha about a grave offense, disavows and then acknowledges, acknowledges and then disavows, equivocates with one thing after another, and knowingly speaks falsely. If it seems right to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should perform the act of making him more wicked against the monk named so-and-so. This is the motion."

This monk, named so-and-so, being questioned in the midst of the Saṅgha about a grave offense, disavows and then acknowledges, acknowledges and then disavows, equivocates with one thing after another, and knowingly speaks falsely. The Saṅgha performs the act of making him more wicked against the monk named so-and-so. If it seems fit to any venerable one that the act of making him more wicked should be performed against the monk named so-and-so, let him be silent; if it does not seem fit, let him speak."

And what therein is the procedure in the presence of (the parties)? The presence of the Saṅgha, the presence of the Dhamma, the presence of the Vinaya... And what therein is the act of making him more wicked? The doing, the performing, the approaching, the accepting, the non-rejection of the act of making him more wicked—this is the act of making him more wicked therein. If, monks, the instigator of such a settled legal issue denounces it, there is an offense entailing confession for denouncing; if the consent-giver is displeased, there is an offense entailing confession for (causing) displeasure."

A legal question concerning offenses is settled by three settlement procedures: by the procedure in the presence, by the Act of Acknowledgment, and by covering over with grass. Could a legal question concerning offenses be settled without one settlement procedure—covering over with grass—and be settled by two settlement procedures—by the procedure in the presence and by the Act of Acknowledgment?” “It could be,” it should be said. “How so? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has committed a minor offense. That bhikkhu, bhikkhus, should approach one bhikkhu, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, kneel down, raise his joined hands, and say this: ‘Friend, I have committed such-and-such an offense; I confess it.’ He should be told: ‘Do you see it?’ ‘Yes, I see it.’ ‘In the future, restrain yourself.’”

How is that? “Here, monks, suppose monks are quarreling, disputing, and fallen into contention, and much unascetic behavior has been repeatedly committed and spoken amiss. Then those monks might think, ‘While we have been quarreling, disputing, and fallen into contention, much unascetic behavior has been repeatedly committed and spoken amiss. If we charge each other with these offenses, this disciplinary issue might lead to harshness, bitterness, or schism.’ “Monks, I allow such a disciplinary issue to be settled by covering over as with grass. “And this is how it should be settled: All should gather in one place.
