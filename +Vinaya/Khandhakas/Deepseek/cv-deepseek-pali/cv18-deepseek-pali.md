1.The Chapter on the Duties of Visiting Monks

356. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena āgantukā bhikkhū saupāhanāpi ārāmaṃ pavisanti, chattapaggahitāpi ārāmaṃ pavisanti, oguṇṭhitāpi ārāmaṃ pavisanti, sīsepi cīvaraṃ karitvā ārāmaṃ pavisanti, pānīyenapi pāde dhovanti, vuḍḍhatarepi āvāsike bhikkhū na abhivādenti, napi senāsanaṃ pucchanti. Aññataropi āgantuko bhikkhu anajjhāvuṭṭhaṃ vihāraṃ ghaṭikaṃ ugghāṭetvā kavāṭaṃ paṇāmetvā sahasā pāvisi. Tassa uparipiṭṭhito [uparipiṭṭhato (?)] ahi khandhe papati. So bhīto vissaramakāsi. Bhikkhū upadhāvitvā taṃ bhikkhuṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘kissa tvaṃ, āvuso, vissaramakāsī’’ti? Atha kho so bhikkhu bhikkhūnaṃ etamatthaṃ ārocesi. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma āgantukā bhikkhū saupāhanāpi ārāmaṃ pavisissanti, chattapaggahitāpi ārāmaṃ pavisissanti, oguṇṭhitāpi ārāmaṃ pavisissanti, sīsepi cīvaraṃ karitvā ārāmaṃ pavisissanti, pānīyenapi pāde dhovissanti, vuḍḍhatarepi āvāsike bhikkhū na abhivādessanti, napi senāsanaṃ pucchissantī’’ti! Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, ‘‘āgantukā bhikkhū saupāhanāpi ārāmaṃ pavisanti, chattapaggahitāpi ārāmaṃ pavisanti, oguṇṭhitāpi ārāmaṃ pavisanti, sīsepi cīvaraṃ karitvā ārāmaṃ pavisanti, pānīyenipi pāde dhovanti, vuḍḍhatarepi āvāsike bhikkhū na abhivādenti, napi senāsanaṃ pucchantīti. Saccaṃ bhagavāti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… kathañhi nāma bhikkhave āgantukā bhikkhū saupāhanāpi ārāmaṃ pavisissanti, chattapaggahitāpi ārāmaṃ pavisissanti, oguṇṭhitāpi ārāmaṃ pavisissanti, sīsepi cīvaraṃ karitvā ārāmaṃ pavisissanti, pānīyenapi pāde dhovissanti, vuḍḍhatarepi āvāsike bhikkhū na abhivādessanti, napi senāsanaṃ pucchissanti, netaṃ bhikkhave appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi –

356.At that time the Buddha, the Blessed One, was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. At that time, visiting monks entered the monastery wearing sandals, entered the monastery holding up umbrellas, entered the monastery with their heads covered, entered the monastery with their robes arranged over their heads, washed their feet even with drinking water, and did not pay respects to the resident monks who were senior, nor did they ask about lodging. One visiting monk, without asking, lifted the latch, pushed open the door, and abruptly entered an unoccupied dwelling. A snake fell from above onto his shoulder. Terrified, he screamed. The monks rushed over and said to him, “Why did you scream, friend?” Then that monk explained the matter to the monks. Those monks who were modest… criticized and complained, “How can visiting monks enter the monastery wearing sandals, enter holding up umbrellas, enter with their heads covered, enter with their robes arranged over their heads, wash their feet even with drinking water, and not pay respects to the senior resident monks, nor ask about lodging?” Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One… “Is it true, monks, that visiting monks enter the monastery wearing sandals, enter holding up umbrellas, enter with their heads covered, enter with their robes arranged over their heads, wash their feet even with drinking water, and do not pay respects to the senior resident monks, nor ask about lodging?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked them… “How, monks, can visiting monks enter the monastery wearing sandals, enter holding up umbrellas, enter with their heads covered, enter with their robes arranged over their heads, wash their feet even with drinking water, and not pay respects to the senior resident monks, nor ask about lodging? This will not inspire confidence in those without it…” Having rebuked them… he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks:

357. ‘‘Tena hi, bhikkhave, āgantukānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ vattaṃ paññapessāmi yathā āgantukehi bhikkhūhi sammā vattitabbaṃ. Āgantukena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā ‘idāni ārāmaṃ pavisissāmī’ti upāhanā omuñcitvā nīcaṃ katvā papphoṭetvā gahetvā chattaṃ apanāmetvā sīsaṃ vivaritvā sīse cīvaraṃ [vivaritvā cīvaraṃ (ka.)] khandhe katvā sādhukaṃ ataramānena ārāmo pavisitabbo. Ārāmaṃ pavisantena sallakkhetabbaṃ – ‘kattha āvāsikā bhikkhū paṭikkamantī’ti? Yattha āvāsikā bhikkhū paṭikkamanti – upaṭṭhānasālāya vā maṇḍape vā rukkhamūle vā – tattha gantvā ekamantaṃ patto nikkhipitabbo; ekamantaṃ cīvaraṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; patirūpaṃ āsanaṃ gahetvā nisīditabbaṃ; pānīyaṃ pucchitabbaṃ, paribhojanīyaṃ pucchitabbaṃ – ‘katamaṃ pānīyaṃ, katamaṃ paribhojanīya’nti? Sace pānīyena attho hoti, pānīyaṃ gahetvā pātabbaṃ. Sace paribhojanīyena attho hoti, paribhojanīyaṃ gahetvā pādā dhovitabbā. Pāde dhovantena ekena hatthena udakaṃ āsiñcitabbaṃ, ekena hatthena pādā dhovitabbā. Teneva udakaṃ āsiñcitabbaṃ [yena hatthena udakaṃ āsiñcitabbaṃ (syā.)] na teneva hatthena pādā dhovitabbā. Upāhanapuñchanacoḷakaṃ pucchitvā upāhanā puñchitabbā. Upāhanā puñchantena paṭhamaṃ sukkhena coḷakena puñchitabbā, pacchā allena. Upāhanāpuñchanacoḷakaṃ dhovitvā [pīḷetvā (syā.)] ekamantaṃ vissajjetabbaṃ.

357.“Well then, monks, I will prescribe the proper conduct for visiting monks, so that visiting monks may behave appropriately. When a visiting monk, monks, is about to enter the monastery, he should take off his sandals, lower them, shake them out, and carry them. He should put away his sunshade, uncover his head, place his robe over his shoulder, and then he should enter the monastery carefully and without haste. Upon entering the monastery, he should observe where the resident monks are withdrawing—whether to the assembly hall, a pavilion, or the foot of a tree. He should go there, set down his bowl to one side, lay aside his robe to one side, take a suitable seat, and sit down. He should ask for drinking water and water for use, inquiring, ‘Which is for drinking and which is for use?’ If he needs drinking water, he should take it and drink. If he needs water for use, he should take it and wash his feet. While washing his feet, he should pour water with one hand and wash his feet with the other, and he should not use the same hand for both pouring water and washing his feet. He should ask for a cloth to wipe his sandals and then wipe them. When wiping his sandals, he should first wipe them with a dry cloth and then with a damp one. After washing the sandal-wiping cloth, he should spread it out.

‘‘Sace āvāsiko bhikkhu vuḍḍho hoti, abhivādetabbo. Sace navako hoti, abhivādāpetabbo. Senāsanaṃ pucchitabbaṃ – ‘katamaṃ me senāsanaṃ pāpuṇātī’ti? Ajjhāvuṭṭhaṃ vā anajjhāvuṭṭhaṃ vā pucchitabbaṃ, gocaro pucchitabbo, agocaro pucchitabbo, sekkhasammatāni [sekhasammatāni (ka.)] kulāni pucchitabbāni, vaccaṭṭhānaṃ pucchitabbaṃ, passāvaṭṭhānaṃ pucchitabbaṃ, pānīyaṃ pucchitabbaṃ, paribhojanīyaṃ pucchitabbaṃ, kattaradaṇḍo pucchitabbo, saṅghassa katikasaṇṭhānaṃ pucchitabbaṃ – ‘kaṃ kālaṃ pavisitabbaṃ, kaṃ kālaṃ nikkhamitabba’nti? Sace vihāro anajjhāvuṭṭho hoti, kavāṭaṃ ākoṭetvā muhuttaṃ āgametvā ghaṭikaṃ ugghāṭetvā kavāṭaṃ paṇāmetvā bahi ṭhitena nilloketabbo.

“If the resident monk is senior, he should be greeted. If he is junior, he should be invited to greet. The lodging should be asked about: ‘Which lodging is available to me?’ It should be asked whether it is occupied or unoccupied. The alms round should be asked about, the non-alms round should be asked about. Families considered suitable for training should be asked about. The toilet should be asked about, the urinal should be asked about, drinking water should be asked about, water for use should be asked about. The broom should be asked about. The Sangha’s established practices should be asked about: ‘At what time should one enter, at what time should one leave?’ If the monastery is unoccupied, one should knock on the door, wait a moment, lift the bolt, push open the door, and look inside while standing outside.

‘‘Sace vihāro uklāpo hoti, mañce vā mañco āropito hoti, pīṭhe vā pīṭhaṃ āropitaṃ hoti, senāsanaṃ upari puñjīkataṃ [puñjakitaṃ (ka.)] hoti, sace ussahati, sodhetabbo. [mahāva. 66-67 (thokaṃ visadisaṃ)] Vihāraṃ sodhentena paṭhamaṃ bhūmattharaṇaṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; mañcapaṭipādakā nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbā; bhisibibbohanaṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; nisīdanapaccattharaṇaṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; mañco nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena, asaṅghaṭṭentena kavāṭapiṭṭhaṃ, nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbo; pīṭhaṃ nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena, asaṅghaṭṭentena kavāṭapiṭṭhaṃ, nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; kheḷamallako nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbo; apassenaphalakaṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ. Sace vihāre santānakaṃ hoti, ullokā paṭhamaṃ ohāretabbaṃ, ālokasandhikaṇṇabhāgā pamajjitabbā. Sace gerukaparikammakatā bhitti kaṇṇakitā hoti, coḷakaṃ temetvā pīḷetvā pamajjitabbā. Sace kāḷavaṇṇakatā bhūmi kaṇṇakitā hoti, coḷakaṃ temetvā pīḷetvā pamajjitabbā. Sace akatā hoti bhūmi, udakena paripphositvā sammajjitabbā – mā vihāro rajena uhaññīti [ūhaññīti (sī. syā.)]. Saṅkāraṃ vicinitvā ekamantaṃ chaḍḍetabbaṃ.

“If the dwelling is untidy, if a bed is placed upon a bed, if a bench is placed upon a bench, if the bedding is piled up, if one is capable, it should be cleaned. When cleaning the dwelling, first the floor covering should be taken out and set aside; the bed legs should be taken out and set aside; the mattress and pillow should be taken out and set aside; the sitting cloth and underlay should be taken out and set aside; the bed should be lowered carefully, without scraping or knocking against the doorposts, taken out, and set aside; the bench should be lowered carefully, without scraping or knocking against the doorposts, taken out, and set aside; the spittoon should be taken out and set aside; the leaning board should be taken out and set aside. If there are decorations in the dwelling, the hanging decorations should first be taken down, and the window frames should be wiped. If the walls have been treated with red ochre and are moldy, a cloth should be moistened, wrung out, and used to wipe them. If the floor has been treated with black color and is moldy, a cloth should be moistened, wrung out, and used to wipe it. If the floor is untreated, it should be sprinkled with water and swept—lest the dwelling be spoiled by dust. Rubbish should be collected and discarded.

‘‘Bhūmattharaṇaṃ otāpetvā sodhetvā papphoṭetvā atiharitvā yathāṭhāne [yathāpaññattaṃ (sī. syā.), yathābhāgaṃ (ka.)] paññapetabbaṃ. Mañcapaṭipādakā otāpetvā pamajjitvā atiharitvā yathāṭhāne [yathābhāgaṃ (syā. ka.)] ṭhapetabbā. Mañco otāpetvā sodhetvā papphoṭetvā nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena, asaṅghaṭṭentena kavāṭapiṭṭhaṃ, atiharitvā yathāṭhāne [yathābhāgaṃ (syā. ka.)] paññapetabbo. Pīṭhaṃ otāpetvā sodhetvā papphoṭetvā nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena, asaṅghaṭṭentena kavāṭapiṭṭhaṃ, atiharitvā yathāṭhāne [yathābhāgaṃ (syā. ka.)] paññapetabbaṃ. Bhisibibbohanaṃ otāpetvā sodhetvā papphoṭetvā atiharitvā yathābhāgaṃ paññapetabbaṃ. Nisīdanapaccattharaṇaṃ otāpetvā sodhetvā papphoṭetvā atiharitvā yathābhāgaṃ paññapetabbaṃ. Kheḷamallako otāpetvā pamajjitvā atiharitvā yathābhāgaṃ ṭhapetabbo. Apassenaphalakaṃ otāpetvā pamajjitvā atiharitvā yathābhāgaṃ ṭhapetabbaṃ. Pattacīvaraṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ. Pattaṃ nikkhipantena ekena hatthena pattaṃ gahetvā ekena hatthena heṭṭhāmañcaṃ vā heṭṭhāpīṭhaṃ vā parāmasitvā patto nikkhipitabbo. Na ca anantarahitāya bhūmiyā patto nikkhipitabbo.

“The floor covering should be aired, cleaned, shaken out, brought back, and placed in its proper position. The bed legs should be aired, wiped, brought back, and placed in their proper position. The bed should be aired, cleaned, shaken out, lowered carefully without scraping or knocking against the doorposts, brought back, and placed in its proper position. The bench should be aired, cleaned, shaken out, lowered carefully without scraping or knocking against the doorposts, brought back, and placed in its proper position. The mattress and pillow should be aired, cleaned, shaken out, brought back, and placed in their proper arrangement. The sitting cloth and underlay should be aired, cleaned, shaken out, brought back, and placed in their proper arrangement. The spittoon should be aired, wiped, brought back, and placed in its proper position. The leaning board should be aired, wiped, brought back, and placed in its proper position. The bowl and robe should be put away. When putting away the bowl, one should hold the bowl with one hand and touch the lower bed or lower bench with the other hand before placing the bowl down. The bowl should not be placed directly on the ground. When putting away the robe, one should hold the robe with one hand and wipe the robe hanger or robe cord with the other hand, then fold the robe lengthwise with the edges inside and put it away.

‘‘Sace puratthimā sarajā vātā vāyanti, puratthimā vātapānā thaketabbā. Sace pacchimā sarajā vātā vāyanti, pacchimā vātapānā thaketabbā. Sace uttarā sarajā vātā vāyanti, uttarā vātapānā thaketabbā. Sace dakkhiṇā sarajā vātā vāyanti, dakkhiṇā vātapānā thaketabbā. Sace sītakālo hoti, divā vātapānā vivaritabbā, rattiṃ thaketabbā. Sace uṇhakālo hoti, divā vātapānā thaketabbā, rattiṃ vivaritabbā.

“If dusty winds blow from the east, eastern windows should be closed. If dusty winds blow from the west, western windows should be closed. If dusty winds blow from the north, northern windows should be closed. If dusty winds blow from the south, southern windows should be closed. If it is the cold season, windows should be opened during the day and closed at night. If it is the hot season, windows should be closed during the day and opened at night.”

‘‘Sace pariveṇaṃ uklāpaṃ hoti, pariveṇaṃ sammajjitabbaṃ. Sace koṭṭhako uklāpo hoti, koṭṭhako sammajjitabbo. Sace upaṭṭhānasālā uklāpā hoti, upaṭṭhānasālā sammajjitabbā. Sace aggisālā uklāpā hoti, aggisālā sammajjitabbā. Sace vaccakuṭi uklāpā hoti, vaccakuṭi sammajjitabbā. Sace pānīyaṃ na hoti, pānīyaṃ upaṭṭhāpetabbaṃ. Sace paribhojanīyaṃ na hoti, paribhojanīyaṃ upaṭṭhāpetabbaṃ. Sace ācamanakumbhiyā udakaṃ na hoti, ācamanakumbhiyā udakaṃ āsiñcitabbaṃ. Idaṃ kho, bhikkhave, āgantukānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ vattaṃ yathā āgantukehi bhikkhūhi sammā vattitabba’’nti.

“If the monastic precinct is dirty, it should be swept. If the storeroom is dirty, it should be swept. If the service hall is dirty, it should be swept. If the fire-room is dirty, it should be swept. If the toilet is dirty, it should be swept. If there is no drinking water, drinking water should be provided. If there is no water for use, water for use should be provided. If there is no water in the rinsing jar, water should be poured into the rinsing jar. This, bhikkhus, is the proper conduct for visiting bhikkhus, which should be well observed by visiting bhikkhus.”

2.The Account of the Duties of Resident Bhikkhus

358. Tena kho pana samayena āvāsikā bhikkhū āgantuke bhikkhū disvā neva āsanaṃ paññapenti, na pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipanti, na paccuggantvā pattacīvaraṃ paṭiggaṇhanti, na pānīyena pucchanti [na pānīyena pucchanti, na paribhojanīyena pucchanti (syā. kaṃ.)], na vuḍḍhatarepi āgantuke bhikkhū abhivādenti, na senāsanaṃ paññapenti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma āvāsikā bhikkhū āgantuke bhikkhū disvā neva āsanaṃ paññapessanti, na pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipissanti, na paccuggantvā pattacīvaraṃ paṭiggahissanti, na pānīyena pucchissanti, vuḍḍhatarepi āgantuke bhikkhū na abhivādessanti, na senāsanaṃ paññapessantī’’ti! Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… saccaṃ kiraṃ, bhikkhave…pe… saccaṃ bhagavāti…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi –

358.At that time the resident bhikkhus, seeing visiting bhikkhus, neither prepared seats, nor provided foot water, footstools, or foot cloths, nor went to greet them and receive their bowls and robes, nor asked if they wanted drinking water, nor even paid respects to the senior visiting bhikkhus, nor assigned them lodgings. Those bhikkhus who were modest… were annoyed, grumbled, and protested, saying, “How can the resident bhikkhus, seeing visiting bhikkhus, neither prepare seats, nor provide foot water, footstools, or foot cloths, nor go to greet them and receive their bowls and robes, nor ask if they want drinking water, nor even pay respects to the senior visiting bhikkhus, nor assign them lodgings?” Then those bhikkhus reported this matter to the Blessed One… “Is it true, bhikkhus…?” “It is true, Blessed One.” … Having rebuked them… the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the bhikkhus:

359. ‘‘Tena hi, bhikkhave, āvāsikānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ vattaṃ paññapessāmi yathā āvāsikehi bhikkhūhi sammā vattitabbaṃ. Āvāsikena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā āgantukaṃ bhikkhuṃ vuḍḍhataraṃ disvā āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipitabbaṃ, paccuggantvā pattacīvaraṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ, pānīyena pucchitabbo [pānīyena pucchitabbo, paribhojanīyena pucchitabbo (syā.)]. Sace ussahati, upāhanā puñchitabbā. Upāhanā puñchantena paṭhamaṃ sukkhena coḷakena puñchitabbā, pacchā allena. Upāhanāpuñchanacoḷakaṃ dhovitvā [dhovitvā pīḷetvā (syā.)] ekamantaṃ vissajjetabbaṃ.

359.“Well then, bhikkhus, I will prescribe the proper conduct for resident bhikkhus, how resident bhikkhus should properly behave. When a resident bhikkhu, bhikkhus, sees a visiting bhikkhu who is senior, he should prepare a seat, provide foot water, a footstool, and a foot-scraper, go out to meet him and receive his bowl and robe, and ask him for water to drink. If he is able, he should clean his sandals. When cleaning the sandals, first wipe them with a dry cloth, then with a wet one. The cloth used for cleaning the sandals should be washed and put aside in a secluded place.

‘‘Āgantuko bhikkhu vuḍḍhataro abhivādetabbo. Senāsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ – ‘etaṃ te senāsanaṃ pāpuṇātī’ti. Ajjhāvuṭṭhaṃ vā anajjhāvuṭṭhaṃ vā ācikkhitabbaṃ. Gocaro ācikkhitabbo. Agocaro ācikkhitabbo.

Saṅghassa katikasaṇṭhānaṃ ācikkhitabbaṃ – ‘imaṃ kālaṃ pavisitabbaṃ, imaṃ kālaṃ nikkhamitabba’nti.

“A visiting bhikkhu who is senior should be greeted with respect. A lodging should be arranged for him, saying, ‘This lodging is for you.’ He should be told whether it is occupied or unoccupied. The alms area should be pointed out. The prohibited area should be pointed out. Families approved for training support should be pointed out. The toilet should be pointed out. The place for urination should be pointed out. Drinking water should be pointed out. Water for use should be pointed out. The broom should be pointed out. The Saṅgha’s established conventions should be pointed out: ‘You should enter at this time, and leave at this time.’

‘‘Sace navako hoti, nisinnakeneva ācikkhitabbaṃ – ‘atra pattaṃ nikkhipāhi, atra cīvaraṃ nikkhipāhi, idaṃ āsanaṃ nisīdāhī’ti. Pānīyaṃ ācikkhitabbaṃ. Paribhojanīyaṃ ācikkhitabbaṃ. Upāhanāpuñchanacoḷakaṃ ācikkhitabbaṃ. Āgantuko bhikkhu navako abhivādāpetabbo. Senāsanaṃ ācikkhitabbaṃ – ‘etaṃ te senāsanaṃ pāpuṇātī’ti. Ajjhāvuṭṭhaṃ vā anajjhāvuṭṭhaṃ vā ācikkhitabbaṃ.

Idaṃ kho, bhikkhave, āvāsikānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ vattaṃ yathā āvāsikehi bhikkhūhi sammā vattitabba’’nti.

“If he is a novice, he should be instructed while seated: ‘Place your bowl here, place your robe here, sit on this seat.’ Drinking water should be pointed out. Water for use should be pointed out. The sandal-wiping cloth should be pointed out. The visiting novice bhikkhu should be made to greet the resident bhikkhus. The lodging should be pointed out with the words, ‘This lodging is for you.’ Whether it is occupied or unoccupied should be pointed out. The alms-round area should be pointed out. The prohibited area should be pointed out. Families approved by the Saṅgha should be pointed out. The toilet should be pointed out. The place for urination should be pointed out. Drinking water should be pointed out. Water for use should be pointed out. The broom should be pointed out. The Saṅgha’s established convention should be pointed out: ‘You should enter at this time, you should leave at this time.’ This, bhikkhus, is the proper conduct for resident bhikkhus, how resident bhikkhus should properly behave.”

3.The Account of the Traveler's Observance

360. Tena kho pana samayena gamikā bhikkhū dārubhaṇḍaṃ mattikābhaṇḍaṃ appaṭisāmetvā dvāravātapānaṃ vivaritvā senāsanaṃ anāpucchā pakkamanti. Dārubhaṇḍaṃ mattikābhaṇḍaṃ nassati.

360.Now at that time, traveling monks departed without putting away the wooden and clay utensils, without closing the doors and windows, and without asking leave for their lodging. The wooden and clay utensils were ruined. The lodging was left unguarded. Those monks who were modest… complained, murmured, and criticized: "How can traveling monks depart without putting away the wooden and clay utensils, without closing the doors and windows, and without asking leave for their lodging? The wooden and clay utensils are ruined. The lodging is left unguarded!" Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One… "Is it true, monks…?" "It is true, Blessed One." … Having rebuked them… the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks:

361. ‘‘Tena hi, bhikkhave, gamikānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ vattaṃ paññapessāmi yathā gamikehi bhikkhūhi sammā vattitabbaṃ.

361."Well then, monks, I shall lay down the observance for traveling monks, how traveling monks should properly conduct themselves. A traveling monk, monks, should put away the wooden and clay utensils, close the doors and windows, and depart after asking leave for the lodging. If there is no monk, a novice should be asked for leave. If there is no novice, a monastery attendant should be asked for leave. If there is no monastery attendant, a lay follower should be asked for leave. If there is no monk, novice, monastery attendant, or lay follower, he should arrange the bed on four stones, stack the beds one on top of the other, stack the benches one on top of the other, pile the lodging's belongings on top, put away the wooden and clay utensils, close the doors and windows, and then depart. If the dwelling is leaking, and if he is able, he should cover it, or make an effort: 'How might the dwelling be covered?' If this can be done, that is good. If not, in a place not exposed to rain, he should arrange the bed on four stones, stack the beds one on top of the other, stack the benches one on top of the other, pile the lodging's belongings on top, put away the wooden and clay utensils, close the doors and windows, and then depart. If the entire dwelling is leaking, and if he is able, he should carry the lodging's belongings to the village, or make an effort: 'How might the lodging's belongings be carried to the village?' If this can be done, that is good. If not, he should arrange the bed on four stones in the open, stack the beds one on top of the other, stack the benches one on top of the other, pile the lodging's belongings on top, put away the wooden and clay utensils, cover them with grass or leaves, and then depart—hoping that at least the parts might remain. This, monks, is the observance for traveling monks, how traveling monks should properly conduct themselves."

4.The Account of the Observance of Giving Thanks

362. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū bhattagge na anumodanti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma samaṇā sakyaputtiyā bhattagge na anumodissantī’’ti! Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū tesaṃ manussānaṃ ujjhāyantānaṃ khiyyantānaṃ vipācentānaṃ. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhattagge anumoditu’’nti. Atha kho tesaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kena nu kho bhattagge anumoditabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, therena bhikkhunā bhattagge anumoditu’’nti.

362.Now at that time, monks were not giving thanks in the refectory. People complained, murmured, and criticized: "How can these Sakyan ascetics not give thanks in the refectory?" The monks heard these people complaining, murmuring, and criticizing. Then those monks reported this matter to the Blessed One. Then, on this occasion, in this connection, the Blessed One, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: "Monks, I allow giving thanks in the refectory." Then those monks thought: "By whom should thanks be given in the refectory?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. Then, on this occasion, in this connection, the Blessed One, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: "Monks, I allow the senior monk to give thanks in the refectory."

Tena kho pana samayena aññatarassa pūgassa saṅghabhattaṃ hoti. Āyasmā sāriputto saṅghatthero hoti. Bhikkhū – ‘bhagavatā anuññātaṃ therena bhikkhunā bhattagge anumoditu’nti – āyasmantaṃ sāriputtaṃ ekakaṃ ohāya pakkamiṃsu. Atha kho āyasmā sāriputto te manusse paṭisammoditvā pacchā ekako agamāsi. Addasā kho bhagavā āyasmantaṃ sāriputtaṃ dūratova ekakaṃ āgacchantaṃ. Disvāna āyasmantaṃ sāriputtaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kacci, sāriputta, bhattaṃ iddhaṃ ahosī’’ti? ‘‘Iddhaṃ kho, bhante, bhattaṃ ahosi; apica maṃ bhikkhū ekakaṃ ohāya pakkantā’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhattagge catūhi pañcahi therānutherehi bhikkhūhi āgametu’’nti.

Now at that time, a certain group had a meal for the Sangha. Venerable Sāriputta was the Sangha's senior monk. The monks—thinking, "The Blessed One has allowed a senior monk to give thanks in the refectory"—left Venerable Sāriputta alone and departed. Then Venerable Sāriputta, having exchanged courtesies with those people, went alone afterward. The Blessed One saw Venerable Sāriputta coming alone from afar. Seeing Venerable Sāriputta, he said to him: "I hope, Sāriputta, the meal was abundant?" "Indeed, Venerable Sir, the meal was abundant; however, the monks left me alone and departed." Then, on this occasion, in this connection, the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: "Monks, I allow four or five senior and junior monks to wait in the refectory."

Tena kho pana samayena aññataro thero bhattagge vaccito āgamesi. So vaccaṃ sandhāretuṃ asakkonto mucchito papati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sati karaṇīye ānantarikaṃ bhikkhuṃ āpucchitvā gantu’’nti.

Now at that time, a certain senior monk, suffering from pressure to defecate, waited in the refectory. Unable to hold in his feces, he fainted and collapsed. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, I allow that if there is a matter of urgency, one may go after asking leave of a monk nearby."

363.At that time, the monks of the group of six went to the refectory poorly dressed, improperly clad, and without proper conduct. They walked ahead of the senior monks, going in front of them. They sat encroaching upon the senior monks, and denied seats to the junior monks. They even spread out their outer robes and sat inside the dwellings. The monks who were modest, content, secluded, and energetic complained, murmured, and criticized, saying: "How can the monks of the group of six go to the refectory poorly dressed, improperly clad, and without proper conduct? How can they walk ahead of the senior monks, going in front of them? How can they sit encroaching upon the senior monks and deny seats to the junior monks? How can they spread out their outer robes and sit inside the dwellings?" Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. The Blessed One, having questioned the monks of the group of six, asked: "Is it true, monks, that the monks of the group of six go to the refectory poorly dressed, improperly clad, and without proper conduct? That they walk ahead of the senior monks, going in front of them? That they sit encroaching upon the senior monks and deny seats to the junior monks? That they spread out their outer robes and sit inside the dwellings?" "It is true, Blessed One." Having rebuked them, the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks:

364. ‘‘Tena hi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūnaṃ bhattaggavattaṃ paññapessāmi yathā bhikkhūhi bhattagge sammā vattitabbaṃ. Sace ārāme kālo ārocito hoti, timaṇḍalaṃ paṭicchādentena parimaṇḍalaṃ nivāsetvā kāyabandhanaṃ bandhitvā saguṇaṃ katvā saṅghāṭiyo pārupitvā gaṇṭhikaṃ paṭimuñcitvā dhovitvā pattaṃ gahetvā sādhukaṃ ataramānena gāmo pavisitabbo.

364."Well then, monks, I will lay down the observances for the refectory, how monks should properly behave in the refectory. If the time has been announced in the monastery, one should cover the three circles of the body, put on the lower robe evenly, fasten the waistband, arrange the outer robes well, put on the outer robes, fasten the clasp, wash the bowl, take the bowl, and enter the village carefully without hurrying."

"When water is being given, one should receive the bowl with both hands and then receive the water. The bowl should be washed carefully, holding it low, without bumping it or making splashing sounds. If there is a water receptacle, one should pour the water into it, holding it low—so that the water receptacle is not splashed, nearby monks are not splashed, and the outer robe is not splashed. If there is no water receptacle, one should pour the water onto the ground, holding it low—so that nearby monks are not splashed and the outer robe is not splashed."

365.At that time, monks on alms round were poorly dressed, improperly covered, and lacking in proper deportment as they went for alms. They entered dwellings without paying attention, left without paying attention, entered too hastily, left too hastily, stood too far away, stood too close, stood too long, and turned back too quickly. One monk on alms round entered a dwelling without paying attention. Thinking it was a door, he entered a private room. In that room, a woman was lying naked on her back. The monk saw her lying there naked and realized, "This is not a door—it’s a private room!" and left that room. The woman’s husband saw her lying naked and, assuming, "This monk has defiled my wife," seized and beat the monk. The woman, awakened by the noise, said, "Sir, why did you beat this monk?" He replied, "This monk defiled you!" She said, "No, sir, this monk did not defile me; that monk is innocent," and had the monk released. The monk returned to the monastery and reported the matter to the monks. Those monks who were of few desires… criticized and complained: "How can monks on alms round be so poorly dressed, improperly covered, and lacking in proper deportment? How can they enter and leave dwellings without paying attention, too hastily, stand too far or too close, too long, or turn back too quickly?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One, who confirmed it and rebuked them. After giving a Dhamma talk, he addressed the monks:

366. ‘‘Tena hi, bhikkhave, piṇḍacārikānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ vattaṃ paññāpessāmi yathā piṇḍacārikehi bhikkhūhi sammā vattitabbaṃ. Piṇḍacārikena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā – ‘idāni gāmaṃ pavisissāmī’ti timaṇḍalaṃ paṭicchādentena parimaṇḍalaṃ nivāsetvā kāyabandhanaṃ bandhitvā saguṇaṃ katvā saṅghāṭiyo pārupitvā gaṇṭhikaṃ paṭimuñcitvā dhovitvā pattaṃ gahetvā sādhukaṃ ataramānena gāmo pavisitabbo.

366.Therefore, monks, I will prescribe the duties for monks who go on alms round, so that monks who go on alms round may conduct themselves properly. A monk going for alms should think, ‘Now I will enter the village.’ He should cover the three circles [of the body], having put on the lower robe evenly, having fastened his belt, having made the outer robe well-folded, having put on the outer robe, having fastened the loop, having washed his bowl, and taking the bowl, he should enter the village carefully, not hurrying.

‘‘Suppaṭicchannena antaraghare gantabbaṃ. Susaṃvutena antaraghare gantabbaṃ. Okkhittacakkhunā antaraghare gantabbaṃ. Na ukkhittakāya antaraghare gantabbaṃ. Na ujjagghikāya antaraghare gantabbaṃ.

Na oguṇṭhitena antaraghare gantabbaṃ. Na ukkuṭikāya antaraghare gantabbaṃ.

He should enter inhabited areas well-covered, well-controlled, with eyes cast down, not with body uplifted, not laughing loudly, moving quietly, not shaking the body, not shaking the arms, nor shaking the head, not with arms akimbo, not with head covered, and not squatting.

‘‘Nivesanaṃ pavisantena sallakkhetabbaṃ – ‘iminā pavisissāmi, iminā nikkhamissāmī’ti. Nātisahasā pavisitabbaṃ. Nātisahasā nikkhamitabbaṃ. Nātidūre ṭhātabbaṃ. Nāccāsanne ṭhātabbaṃ. Nāticiraṃ ṭhātabbaṃ. Nātilahuṃ nivattitabbaṃ. Ṭhitakena sallakkhetabbaṃ – ‘bhikkhaṃ dātukāmā vā adātukāmā vā’ti. Sace kammaṃ vā nikkhipati, āsanā vā vuṭṭhāti, kaṭacchuṃ vā parāmasati, bhājanaṃ vā parāmasati, ṭhapeti [ṭhāpeti (ka.)] vā – dātukāmassāti [dātukāmiyāti (syā.), dātukāmā viyāti (sī.)] ṭhātabbaṃ.

When entering a dwelling, one should consider: ‘I will enter by this way, I will exit by this way.’ One should not enter too hastily. One should not exit too hastily. One should not stand too far away. One should not stand too close. One should not stand for too long. One should not turn back too quickly. While standing, one should consider: ‘Do they wish to give alms or not?’ If they put down their work, rise from their seat, touch a ladle, touch a dish, or set something down—it means they wish to give; one should stand there. When alms are being given, one should lift the outer robe with the left hand, extend the bowl with the right hand, and receive the alms with both hands holding the bowl. One should not look up at the face of the almsgiver. One should consider: ‘Do they wish to give soup or not?’ If they touch a ladle, touch a dish, or set something down—it means they wish to give; one should stand there. After alms have been given, one should cover the bowl with the outer robe and depart carefully, without hurrying.

‘‘Suppaṭicchannena antaraghare gantabbaṃ. Susaṃvutena antaraghare gantabbaṃ. Okkhittacakkhunā antaraghare gantabbaṃ. Na ukkhittakāya antaraghare gantabbaṃ. Na ujjagghikāya antaraghare gantabbaṃ.

One should enter inhabited areas well-covered. One should enter inhabited areas well-restrained. One should enter inhabited areas with eyes cast down. One should not enter inhabited areas with body raised up. One should not enter inhabited areas laughing loudly. One should enter inhabited areas quietly. One should not enter inhabited areas swaying the body. One should not enter inhabited areas swinging the arms. One should not enter inhabited areas shaking the head. One should not enter inhabited areas with arms akimbo. One should not enter inhabited areas with the head covered. One should not enter inhabited areas squatting. The first monk returning from almsround in the village should prepare the seats, set out foot-washing water, a footstool, and a foot-wiper, wash and set out the rinsing bowl, and set out drinking water and water for use. The last monk returning from almsround in the village may eat if there are leftovers and if he wishes. If he does not wish, he should discard them where there is little greenery or drop them into water without living beings. He should put away the seats, collect the foot-washing water, footstool, and foot-wiper, wash and put away the rinsing bowl, and put away the drinking water and water for use. He should sweep the refectory. Whoever sees an empty or dry water pot for drinking, for use, or for the toilet should fill it. If he cannot manage alone, he should summon a second monk with a gesture and fill it by joining hands, but he should not break the silence because of it. This, monks, is the proper conduct for alms-seeking monks, which should be rightly followed by monks on almsround.

7.The Discourse on the Observances of Forest Dwellers

367. Tena kho pana samayena sambahulā bhikkhū araññe viharanti. Te neva pānīyaṃ upaṭṭhāpenti, na paribhojanīyaṃ upaṭṭhāpenti, na aggiṃ upaṭṭhāpenti, na araṇisahitaṃ upaṭṭhāpenti, na nakkhattapadāni jānanti, na disābhāgaṃ jānanti. Corā tattha gantvā te bhikkhū etadavocuṃ – ‘‘atthi, bhante, pānīya’’nti? ‘‘Natthāvuso’’ti. ‘‘Atthi, bhante, paribhojanīya’’nti? ‘‘Natthāvuso’’ti. ‘‘Atthi, bhante, aggī’’ti? ‘‘Natthāvuso’’ti. ‘‘Atthi, bhante, araṇisahita’’nti? ‘‘Natthāvuso’’ti. ( ) [(atthi bhante nakkhattapadānīti, na jānāma āvusoti, atthi bhante disābhāganti, na jānāma āvusoti.) sī. vimatiṭīkāya pana sameti] ‘‘Kenajja, bhante, yutta’’nti? ‘‘Na kho mayaṃ, āvuso, jānāmā’’ti. ‘‘Katamāyaṃ, bhante, disā’’ti? ‘‘Na kho mayaṃ, āvuso, jānāmā’’ti. Atha kho te corā – ‘nevimesaṃ pānīyaṃ atthi, na paribhojanīyaṃ atthi, na aggi atthi, na araṇisahitaṃ atthi, na nakkhattapadāni jānanti, na disābhāgaṃ jānanti; corā ime, nayime bhikkhū’ti – ākoṭetvā pakkamiṃsu. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhikkhūnaṃ etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi –

367.At that time, several monks were dwelling in the forest. They did not keep drinking water available, nor water for use, nor fire, nor a fire-drill, nor did they know the constellations, nor the cardinal directions. Thieves came there and asked those monks, “Is there drinking water, venerable ones?” “No, friends.” “Is there water for use, venerable ones?” “No, friends.” “Is there fire, venerable ones?” “No, friends.” “Is there a fire-drill, venerable ones?” “No, friends.” “What day is it today, venerable ones?” “We do not know, friends.” “Which direction is this, venerable ones?” “We do not know, friends.” Then those thieves thought, ‘These people have no drinking water, no water for use, no fire, no fire-drill, they do not know the constellations or the cardinal directions; these are thieves, not monks.’ So they struck them and left. Then those monks informed the other monks about the matter. The monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion and in this connection, gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks:

368. ‘‘Tena hi, bhikkhave, āraññikānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ vattaṃ paññapessāmi yathā āraññikehi bhikkhūhi sammā vattitabbaṃ. Āraññikena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā kālasseva uṭṭhāya pattaṃ thavikāya pakkhipitvā aṃse ālaggetvā cīvaraṃ khandhe karitvā upāhanā ārohitvā dārubhaṇḍaṃ mattikābhaṇḍaṃ paṭisāmetvā dvāravātapānaṃ thaketvā senāsanā otaritabbaṃ – idāni gāmaṃ pavisissāmīti. Upāhanā omuñcitvā nīcaṃ katvā papphoṭetvā thavikāya pakkhipitvā aṃse ālaggetvā timaṇḍalaṃ paṭicchādentena parimaṇḍalaṃ nivāsetvā kāyabandhanaṃ bandhitvā saguṇaṃ katvā saṅghāṭiyo pārupitvā gaṇṭhikaṃ paṭimuñcitvā dhovitvā pattaṃ gahetvā sādhukaṃ ataramānena gāmo pavisitabbo. Suppaṭicchannena antaraghare gantabbaṃ…pe… na khambhakatena antaraghare gantabbaṃ. Na oguṇṭhitena antaraghare gantabbaṃ. Na ukkuṭikāya antaraghare gantabbaṃ.

368.“Well then, monks, I will lay down a practice for forest-dwelling monks, prescribing how forest-dwelling monks should properly conduct themselves. A forest-dwelling monk, monks, should rise early, place his bowl in a bag, hang it over his shoulder, place his outer robe on his shoulder, wear his sandals, put away his wooden and clay utensils, close the doors and windows, and descend from his dwelling, thinking, ‘Now I will enter the village.’ He should take off his sandals, lower them, shake them out, place them in the bag, hang it over his shoulder, covering the three circles of the body, wearing the inner robe evenly, fastening his belt, making his robes neat, putting on his outer robes, untying his waistband knot, washing his bowl, taking it, and enter the village carefully without hurrying. He should walk inside houses well-covered… He should not walk inside houses with his robe hitched up. He should not walk inside houses with his head covered. He should not walk inside houses squatting.

‘‘Nivesanaṃ pavisantena sallakkhetabbaṃ – ‘iminā pavisissāmi, iminā nikkhamissāmī’ti. Nātisahasā pavisitabbaṃ. Nātisahasā nikkhamitabbaṃ. Nātidūre ṭhātabbaṃ. Nāccāsanne ṭhātabbaṃ. Nāticiraṃ ṭhātabbaṃ. Nātilahuṃ nivattitabbaṃ. Ṭhitakena sallakkhetabbaṃ – ‘bhikkhaṃ dātukāmā vā adātukāmā vā’ti. Sace kammaṃ vā nikkhipati, āsanā vā vuṭṭhāti, kaṭacchuṃ vā parāmasati, bhājanaṃ vā parāmasati, ṭhapeti vā – dātukāmassāti ṭhātabbaṃ. Bhikkhāya diyyamānāya vāmena hatthena saṅghāṭiṃ uccāretvā dakkhiṇena hatthena pattaṃ paṇāmetvā ubhohi hatthehi pattaṃ paṭiggahetvā bhikkhā paṭiggahetabbā. Na ca bhikkhādāyikāya mukhaṃ ulloketabbaṃ. Sallakkhetabbaṃ – ‘sūpaṃ dātukāmā vā adātukāmā vā’ti. Sace kaṭacchu vā parāmasati, bhājanaṃ vā parāmasati, ṭhapeti vā – dātukāmassāti ṭhātabbaṃ. Bhikkhāya dinnāya saṅghāṭiyā pattaṃ paṭicchādetvā sādhukaṃ ataramānena nivattitabbaṃ.

When entering a dwelling, one should consider: ‘I will enter by this way, I will exit by this way.’ One should not enter too hastily. One should not exit too hastily. One should not stand too far away. One should not stand too close. One should not stand for too long. One should not turn back too quickly. While standing, one should consider: ‘Are they willing to give almsfood or not?’ If they put down their work, rise from their seat, touch the ladle, handle a vessel, or set it down—one should stand, thinking they are willing to give. When almsfood is being given, one should lift the outer robe with the left hand, extend the bowl with the right hand, receive the bowl with both hands, and accept the almsfood. And one should not look up at the almsgiver’s face. One should consider: ‘Are they willing to give soup or not?’ If they touch the ladle, handle a vessel, or set it down—one should stand, thinking they are willing to give. After almsfood is given, one should cover the bowl with the outer robe and depart carefully without being too hurried.

‘‘Suppaṭicchannena antaraghare gantabbaṃ…pe… na ukkuṭikāya antaraghare gantabbaṃ. Gāmato nikkhamitvā pattaṃ thavikāya pakkhipitvā aṃse ālaggetvā cīvaraṃ saṅgharitvā sīse karitvā upāhanā ārohitvā gantabbaṃ.

One should enter inside houses well-covered… one should not enter inside houses squatting. After leaving the village, one should place the bowl in its bag, hang it over the shoulder, having folded the robe and placed it on the head, put on sandals, and proceed.

‘‘Āraññikena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā pānīyaṃ upaṭṭhāpetabbaṃ, paribhojanīyaṃ upaṭṭhāpetabbaṃ, aggi upaṭṭhāpetabbo, araṇisahitaṃ upaṭṭhāpetabbaṃ, kattaradaṇḍo upaṭṭhāpetabbo, nakkhattapadāni uggahetabbāni – sakalāni vā ekadesāni vā, disākusalena bhavitabbaṃ. Idaṃ kho, bhikkhave, āraññikānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ vattaṃ yathā āraññikehi bhikkhūhi sammā vattitabba’’nti.

A forest-dwelling monk, monks, should keep drinking water available, keep water for use available, keep fire available, keep a fire-drill set available, keep a knife available, learn the constellations—either all or some—and be skilled in knowing directions. This, monks, is the proper conduct for forest-dwelling monks, which should be rightly practiced by forest-dwelling monks.

8.The Account of Lodging Conduct

369. Tena kho pana samayena sambahulā bhikkhū ajjhokāse cīvarakammaṃ karonti. Chabbaggiyā bhikkhū paṭivāte aṅgaṇe [paṅgaṇe (sī. syā.)] senāsanaṃ papphoṭesuṃ. Bhikkhū rajena okiriṃsu. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma chabbaggiyā bhikkhū paṭivāte aṅgaṇe senāsanaṃ papphoṭessanti! Bhikkhū rajena okiriṃsū’’ti. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, chabbaggiyā bhikkhū paṭivāte aṅgaṇe senāsanaṃ papphoṭenti, bhikkhū rajena okiriṃsū’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi –

369.At that time, many monks were doing robe work in the open air. The monks of the group of six shook out bedding in the courtyard against the wind. They covered the monks in dust. Those monks who were modest… complained and criticized, saying: "How could the monks of the group of six shake out bedding in the courtyard against the wind, covering the monks in dust!" Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One… "Is it true, monks, that the monks of the group of six shake out bedding in the courtyard against the wind, covering the monks in dust?" "It is true, Blessed One."… Having rebuked them… the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks:

370. ‘‘Tena hi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūnaṃ senāsanavattaṃ paññapessāmi yathā bhikkhūhi senāsane sammā vattitabbaṃ. Yasmiṃ vihāre viharati, sace so vihāro uklāpo hoti, sace ussahati, sodhetabbo. [mahāva. 66, 67; cūḷava. 357] Vihāraṃ sodhentena paṭhamaṃ pattacīvaraṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; nisīdanapaccattharaṇaṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; bhisibibbohanaṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; mañco nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena, asaṅghaṭṭentena kavāṭapiṭṭhaṃ, nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbo; pīṭhaṃ nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena, asaṅghaṭṭentena kavāṭapiṭṭhaṃ, nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; mañcapaṭipādakā nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbā; kheḷamallako nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbo; apassenaphalakaṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; bhummattharaṇaṃ yathāpaññattaṃ sallakkhetvā nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ. Sace vihāre santānakaṃ hoti, ullokā paṭhamaṃ ohāretabbaṃ, ālokasandhikaṇṇabhāgā pamajjitabbā. Sace gerukaparikammakatā bhitti kaṇṇakitā hoti, coḷakaṃ temetvā pīḷetvā pamajjitabbā. Sace kāḷavaṇṇakatā bhūmi kaṇṇakitā hoti, coḷakaṃ temetvā pīḷetvā pamajjitabbā. Sace akatā hoti bhūmi, udakena paripphositvā pariphositvā sammajjitabbā – mā vihāro rajena uhaññīti. Saṅkāraṃ vicinitvā ekamantaṃ chaḍḍetabbaṃ.

370."Well then, monks, I will prescribe the rules of conduct regarding lodgings for monks, detailing how monks should properly behave in lodgings. In whatever dwelling one resides, if that dwelling is untidy and one is capable, it should be cleaned. When cleaning the dwelling, first take out the bowl and robe and set them aside. Take out the sitting mat and spread and set them aside. Take out the mattress and cushion and set them aside. Lower the bed carefully, without scraping or bumping it against the doorposts, and take it out to set aside. Lower the stool carefully, without scraping or bumping it against the doorposts, and take it out to set aside. Take out the bed legs and set them aside. Take out the spittoon and set it aside. Take out the backrest and set it aside. Examine the floor covering as it was laid out, then take it out and set it aside. If the dwelling has cobwebs, first remove them from above. Dust off the window frames and corners. If the walls treated with red ochre have become stained, moisten a cloth, wring it out, and wipe them clean. If the blackened floor has become stained, moisten a cloth, wring it out, and wipe it clean. If the floor is untreated, sprinkle it with water and sweep it—so that the dwelling is not covered with dust. Gather the rubbish and discard it in one place.

‘‘Na bhikkhusāmantā senāsanaṃ papphoṭetabbaṃ. Na vihārasāmantā senāsanaṃ papphoṭetabbaṃ. Na pānīyasāmantā senāsanaṃ papphoṭetabbaṃ. Na paribhojanīyasāmantā senāsanaṃ papphoṭetabbaṃ. Na paṭivāte aṅgaṇe senāsanaṃ papphoṭetabbaṃ. Adhovāte senāsanaṃ papphoṭetabbaṃ.

Bedding should not be shaken out in the vicinity of a monk. Bedding should not be shaken out in the vicinity of a dwelling. Bedding should not be shaken out in the vicinity of drinking water. Bedding should not be shaken out in the vicinity of water for use. Bedding should not be shaken out in a windward courtyard. Bedding should be shaken out in a leeward place.

‘‘Bhummattharaṇaṃ ekamantaṃ otāpetvā sodhetvā papphoṭetvā atiharitvā yathāpaññattaṃ paññapetabbaṃ. Mañcapaṭipādakā ekamantaṃ otāpetvā pamajjitvā atiharitvā yathāṭhāne ṭhapetabbā. Mañco ekamantaṃ otāpetvā sodhetvā papphoṭetvā nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena, asaṅghaṭṭentena kavāṭapiṭṭhaṃ, atiharitvā yathāpaññattaṃ paññapetabbo. Pīṭhaṃ ekamantaṃ otāpetvā sodhetvā papphoṭetvā nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena, asaṅghaṭṭentena kavāṭapiṭṭhaṃ, atiharitvā yathāpaññattaṃ paññapetabbaṃ. Bhisibibbohanaṃ ekamantaṃ otāpetvā sodhetvā papphoṭetvā atiharitvā yathāpaññattaṃ paññapetabbaṃ. Nisīdanapaccattharaṇaṃ ekamantaṃ otāpetvā sodhetvā papphoṭetvā atiharitvā yathāpaññattaṃ paññapetabbaṃ. Kheḷamallako ekamantaṃ otāpetvā pamajjitvā atiharitvā yathāṭhāne ṭhapetabbo. Apassenaphalakaṃ ekamantaṃ otāpetvā pamajjitvā atiharitvā yathāṭhāne ṭhapetabbaṃ. Pattacīvaraṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ. Pattaṃ nikkhipantena ekena hatthena pattaṃ gahetvā ekena hatthena heṭṭhāmañcaṃ vā heṭṭhāpīṭhaṃ vā parāmasitvā patto nikkhipitabbo. Na ca anantarahitāya bhūmiyā patto nikkhipitabbo. Cīvaraṃ nikkhipantena ekena hatthena cīvaraṃ gahetvā ekena hatthena cīvaravaṃsaṃ vā cīvararajju vā pamajjitvā pārato antaṃ orato bhogaṃ katvā cīvaraṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ.

The floor covering should be taken aside, dried, cleaned, shaken out, brought back, and then laid out as prescribed. The bed legs should be taken aside, wiped, brought back, and placed back in their proper positions. The bed should be taken aside, dried, cleaned, shaken out, lowered carefully without scraping or bumping against the doorposts, brought back, and then arranged as prescribed. The stool should be taken aside, dried, cleaned, shaken out, lowered carefully without scraping or bumping against the doorposts, brought back, and then arranged as prescribed. The mattress and pillow should be taken aside, dried, cleaned, shaken out, brought back, and then arranged as prescribed. The sitting mat and cover should be taken aside, dried, cleaned, shaken out, brought back, and then arranged as prescribed. The spittoon should be taken aside, wiped, brought back, and placed back in its proper position. The backrest should be taken aside, wiped, brought back, and placed back in its proper position. The bowl and robe should be put away. When putting away the bowl, one should hold the bowl with one hand, feel underneath the bed or bench with the other hand, and then place the bowl down. The bowl should not be placed directly on the bare ground. When putting away the robe, one should hold the robe with one hand, wipe the robe rack or clothesline with the other hand, folding it from the far end to the near end, and then store it.

‘‘Sace puratthimā sarajā vātā vāyanti, puratthimā vātapānā thaketabbā. Sace pacchimā sarajā vātā vāyanti, pacchimā vātapānā thaketabbā. Sace uttarā sarajā vātā vāyanti uttarā vātapānā thaketabbā. Sace dakkhiṇā sarajā vātā vāyanti, dakkhiṇā vātapānā thaketabbā. Sace sītakālo hoti, divā vātapānā vivaritabbā, rattiṃ thaketabbā. Sace uṇhakālo hoti, divā vātapānā thaketabbā, rattiṃ vivaritabbā.

If dusty winds blow from the east, the eastern windows should be closed. If dusty winds blow from the west, the western windows should be closed. If dusty winds blow from the north, the northern windows should be closed. If dusty winds blow from the south, the southern windows should be closed. If it is the cold season, the windows should be opened during the day and closed at night. If it is the hot season, the windows should be closed during the day and opened at night.

‘‘Sace pariveṇaṃ uklāpaṃ hoti, pariveṇaṃ sammajjitabbaṃ. Sace koṭṭhako uklāpo hoti, koṭṭhako sammajjitabbo. Sace upaṭṭhānasālā uklāpā hoti, upaṭṭhānasālā sammajjitabbā. Sace aggisālā uklāpā hoti, aggisālā sammajjitabbā. Sace vaccakuṭi uklāpā hoti, vaccakuṭi sammajjitabbā. Sace pānīyaṃ na hoti, pānīyaṃ upaṭṭhāpetabbaṃ. Sace paribhojanīyaṃ na hoti, paribhojanīyaṃ upaṭṭhāpetabbaṃ. Sace ācamanakumbhiyā udakaṃ na hoti, ācamanakumbhiyā udakaṃ āsiñcitabbaṃ.

If the monastery precinct is dirty, the monastery precinct should be swept. If the storehouse is dirty, the storehouse should be swept. If the service hall is dirty, the service hall should be swept. If the fire hall is dirty, the fire hall should be swept. If the toilet is dirty, the toilet should be swept. If there is no drinking water, drinking water should be provided. If there is no water for use, water for use should be provided. If there is no water in the wash basin, water should be poured into the wash basin.

‘‘Sace vuḍḍhena saddhiṃ ekavihāre viharati, na vuḍḍhaṃ anāpucchā uddeso dātabbo, na paripucchā dātabbā, na sajjhāyo kātabbo, na dhammo bhāsitabbo, na padīpo kātabbo, na padīpo vijjhāpetabbo, na vātapānā vivaritabbā, na vātapānā thaketabbā. Sace vuḍḍhena saddhiṃ ekacaṅkame caṅkamati, yena vuḍḍho tena parivattitabbaṃ, na ca vuḍḍho saṅghāṭikaṇṇena ghaṭṭetabbo. Idaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhūnaṃ senāsanavattaṃ yathā bhikkhūhi senāsane sammā vattitabba’’nti.

If one dwells in the same dwelling with an elder, one should not give a lesson without asking the elder's permission, nor ask questions, nor engage in recitation, nor speak the Dhamma, nor light a lamp, nor put out a lamp, nor open the windows, nor close the windows. If one walks on the same path with an elder, one should turn around where the elder turns, and one should not brush the elder with the edge of one’s outer robe. This, monks, is the proper conduct regarding lodgings, as monks should properly conduct themselves in lodgings.

9.The Observance of the Hot-House

371. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū jantāghare therehi bhikkhūhi nivāriyamānā anādariyaṃ paṭicca pahūtaṃ kaṭṭhaṃ āropetvā aggiṃ datvā dvāraṃ thaketvā dvāre nisīdanti. Bhikkhū [therā ca bhikkhū (syā. kaṃ.)] uṇhābhitattā dvāraṃ alabhamānā mucchitā papatanti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma chabbaggiyā bhikkhū jantāghare therehi bhikkhūhi nivāriyamānā anādariyaṃ paṭicca pahūtaṃ kaṭṭhaṃ āropetvā aggiṃ datvā dvāraṃ thaketvā dvāre nisīdissanti! Bhikkhū uṇhābhitattā dvāraṃ alabhamānā mucchitā papatantī’’ti. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, chabbaggiyā bhikkhū jantāghare therehi bhikkhūhi nivāriyamānā anādariyaṃ paṭicca pahūtaṃ kaṭṭhaṃ āropetvā aggiṃ datvā dvāraṃ thaketvā dvāre nisīdanti; bhikkhū uṇhābhitattā dvāraṃ alabhamānā mucchitā papatantī’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, jantāghare therena bhikkhunā nivāriyamānena anādariyaṃ paṭicca pahūtaṃ kaṭṭhaṃ āropetvā aggi dātabbo. Yo dadeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Na, bhikkhave, dvāraṃ thaketvā dvāre nisīditabbaṃ. Yo nisīdeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa.

371.At that time the monks of the group of six, being restrained by the elder monks in the hot-house, out of disrespect piled up a lot of firewood, lit a fire, blocked the door, and sat by the door. The monks, distressed by the heat and unable to get out, fainted and collapsed. Those monks who were modest, content, scrupulous, desirous of training, complained and criticized, saying: “How can the monks of the group of six, being restrained by the elder monks in the hot-house, out of disrespect pile up a lot of firewood, light a fire, block the door, and sit by the door? The monks, distressed by the heat and unable to get out, fainted and collapsed!” Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. The Blessed One, having had the monks assembled for this reason, questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the monks of the group of six, being restrained by the elder monks in the hot-house, out of disrespect piled up a lot of firewood, lit a fire, blocked the door, and sat by the door, and that the monks, distressed by the heat and unable to get out, fainted and collapsed?” “It is true, Blessed One.” Having rebuked them, having given a Dhamma talk, the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks, one should not, when being restrained by a senior monk in the hot-house, out of disrespect pile up a lot of firewood and light a fire. Whoever does so incurs an offense of wrong-doing. One should not block the door and sit by the door. Whoever does so incurs an offense of wrong-doing.

372. ‘‘Tena hi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūnaṃ jantāgharavattaṃ paññapessāmi yathā bhikkhūhi jantāghare sammā vattitabbaṃ. Yo paṭhamaṃ jantāgharaṃ gacchati, sace chārikā ussannā hoti, chārikā chaḍḍetabbā. Sace jantāgharaṃ uklāpaṃ hoti, jantāgharaṃ sammajjitabbaṃ. Sace paribhaṇḍaṃ uklāpaṃ hoti, paribhaṇḍaṃ sammajjitabbaṃ. Sace pariveṇaṃ uklāpaṃ hoti, pariveṇaṃ sammajjitabbaṃ. Sace koṭṭhako uklāpo hoti, koṭṭhako sammajjitabbo. Sace jantāgharasālā uklāpā hoti, jantāgharasālā sammajjitabbā.

372.“Therefore, monks, I will lay down the observance for monks regarding the hot-house, so that monks should properly conduct themselves in the hot-house. The monk who arrives at the hot-house first, if the ashes are piled up, the ashes should be discarded. If the hot-house is dirty, the hot-house should be swept. If the equipment is dirty, the equipment should be swept. If the surrounding enclosure is dirty, the surrounding enclosure should be swept. If the store-room is dirty, the store-room should be swept. If the hot-house hall is dirty, the hot-house hall should be swept.

‘‘Cuṇṇaṃ sannetabbaṃ, mattikā temetabbā, udakadoṇikāya udakaṃ āsiñcitabbaṃ. Jantāgharaṃ pavisantena mattikāya mukhaṃ makkhetvā purato ca pacchato ca paṭicchādetvā jantāgharaṃ pavisitabbaṃ. Na there bhikkhū anupakhajja nisīditabbaṃ. Na navā bhikkhū āsanena paṭibāhitabbā. Sace ussahati, jantāghare therānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ parikammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Jantāgharā nikkhamantena jantāgharapīṭhaṃ ādāya purato ca pacchato ca paṭicchādetvā jantāgharā nikkhamitabbaṃ. Sace ussahati, udakepi therānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ parikammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Na therānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ puratopi nahāyitabbaṃ, na uparitopi nahāyitabbaṃ. Nahātena uttarantena otarantānaṃ maggo dātabbo. Yo pacchā jantāgharā nikkhamati, sace jantāgharaṃ cikkhallaṃ hoti, dhovitabbaṃ. Mattikādoṇikaṃ dhovitvā jantāgharapīṭhaṃ paṭisāmetvā aggiṃ vijjhāpetvā dvāraṃ thaketvā pakkamitabbaṃ. Idaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhūnaṃ jantāgharavattaṃ yathā bhikkhūhi jantāghare sammā vattitabba’’nti.

“Fine powder should be prepared, clay should be moistened, and water should be poured into the water trough. When entering the hot-house, one should smear the face with clay, cover oneself in front and in back, and then enter the hot-house. One should not sit pressing against senior monks. New monks should not be pushed away from their seats. If one is able, service should be rendered to senior monks in the hot-house. When leaving the hot-house, one should take the hot-house seat, cover oneself in front and in back, and then leave the hot-house. If one is able, service should also be rendered to senior monks with water. One should not bathe in front of senior monks, nor above them. When one has finished bathing and is leaving, the path should be given to those entering. Whoever leaves the hot-house last, if the hot-house is muddy, it should be washed. After washing the clay trough, returning the hot-house seat to its place, extinguishing the fire, and closing the door, one should depart. This, monks, is the observance for monks in the hot-house, how monks should properly conduct themselves in the hot-house.”

10.The Observance of the Latrine

373. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu brāhmaṇajātiko vaccaṃ katvā na icchati ācametuṃ – ko imaṃ vasalaṃ duggandhaṃ āmasissatīti [ācamissatīti (ka.)]. Tassa vaccamagge kimi saṇṭhāti. Atha kho so bhikkhu bhikkhūnaṃ etamatthaṃ ārocesi. ‘‘Kiṃ pana tvaṃ, āvuso, vaccaṃ katvā na ācamesī’’ti? ‘‘Evamāvuso’’ti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma bhikkhu vaccaṃ katvā na ācamessatī’’ti! Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ kira tvaṃ, bhikkhu, vaccaṃ katvā na ācamesī’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, vaccaṃ katvā sati udake nācametabbaṃ. Yo nācameyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

373.At that time, a certain monk of brahmin birth, after defecating, did not wish to wash, thinking: “Who would touch this foul-smelling outcast?” As a result, worms infested his anus. Then that monk informed the monks of the matter. “But why, friend, did you not wash after defecating?” “Just so, friend.” Those monks who were modest, content, scrupulous, desirous of training, complained and criticized, saying: “How could a monk not wash after defecating?” Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. The Blessed One, having had the monks assembled for this reason, questioned the monks: “Is it true, monk, that you did not wash after defecating?” “It is true, Blessed One.” Having rebuked him, having given a Dhamma talk, the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks, after defecating, one should not fail to wash if water is available. Whoever does not wash incurs an offense of wrong-doing.”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū vaccakuṭiyā yathāvuḍḍhaṃ vaccaṃ karonti. Navakā bhikkhū paṭhamataraṃ āgantvā vaccitā āgamenti. Te vaccaṃ sandhārentā mucchitā papatanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… saccaṃ kira bhikkhave…pe… saccaṃ bhagavāti…pe… ‘‘na, bhikkhave, vaccakuṭiyā yathāvuḍḍhaṃ vacco kātabbo. Yo kareyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, āgatapaṭipāṭiyā vaccaṃ kātu’’nti.

At that time, monks were defecating in the latrine according to seniority. New monks, having arrived earlier, would wait (for their turn to use the latrine). Those retaining their feces while waiting would faint and fall down. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. The Blessed One, having had the monks assembled for this reason, questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that monks were defecating in the latrine according to seniority, and new monks, having arrived earlier, would wait, and those retaining their feces while waiting would faint and fall down?” “It is true, Blessed One.” Having rebuked them, having given a Dhamma talk, the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks, defecation should not be done in the latrine according to seniority. Whoever does so incurs an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, defecation in order of arrival.”

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū atisahasāpi vaccakuṭiṃ pavisanti, ubbhajitvāpi [ubbhujjitvāpi (sī.), ubbhujitvā (syā.)] pavisanti, nitthunantāpi vaccaṃ karonti, dantakaṭṭhaṃ khādantāpi vaccaṃ karonti, bahiddhāpi vaccadoṇikāya vaccaṃ karonti, bahiddhāpi passāvadoṇikāya passāvaṃ karonti, passāvadoṇikāyapi kheḷaṃ karonti, pharusenapi kaṭṭhena avalekhanti, avalekhanakaṭṭhampi vaccakūpamhi pātenti, atisahasāpi nikkhamanti, ubbhajitvāpi nikkhamanti, capucapukārakampi ācamenti, ācamanasarāvakepi udakaṃ sesenti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma chabbaggiyā bhikkhū atisahasāpi vaccakuṭiṃ pavisissanti, ubbhajitvāpi pavisissanti, nitthunantāpi vaccaṃ karissanti, dantakaṭṭhaṃ khādantāpi vaccaṃ karissanti, bahiddhāpi vaccadoṇikāya vaccaṃ karissanti, bahiddhāpi passāvadoṇikāya passāvaṃ karissanti, passāvadoṇikāyapi kheḷaṃ karissanti, pharusenapi kaṭṭhena avalekhissanti, avalekhanakaṭṭhampi vaccakūpamhi pātessanti, atisahasāpi nikkhamissanti, ubbhajitvāpi nikkhamissanti, capucapukārakampi ācamessanti, ācamanasarāvakepi udakaṃ sesessantī’’ti!

At that time, the monks of the group of six entered the latrine too hastily, entered while lifting their robes, defecated while grunting, defecated while chewing tooth-cleaning sticks, defecated outside the latrine trough, urinated outside the urinal trough, spat into the urinal trough, scraped with rough sticks, threw the scraping stick into the latrine pit, exited too hastily, exited while lifting their robes, made smacking sounds while rinsing, and left water in the rinsing bowl. Those monks who were modest, content, scrupulous, desirous of training, complained and criticized them: “How can the monks of the group of six enter the latrine too hastily, enter while lifting their robes, defecate while grunting, defecate while chewing tooth-cleaning sticks, defecate outside the latrine trough, urinate outside the urinal trough, spit into the urinal trough, scrape with rough sticks, throw the scraping stick into the latrine pit, exit too hastily, exit while lifting their robes, make smacking sounds while rinsing, and leave water in the rinsing bowl?” Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. The Blessed One, having had the monks assembled for this reason, questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the monks of the group of six entered the latrine too hastily, entered while lifting their robes, defecated while grunting, defecated while chewing tooth-cleaning sticks, defecated outside the latrine trough, urinated outside the urinal trough, spat into the urinal trough, scraped with rough sticks, threw the scraping stick into the latrine pit, exited too hastily, exited while lifting their robes, made smacking sounds while rinsing, and left water in the rinsing bowl?” “It is true, Blessed One.” Having rebuked them, having given a Dhamma talk, the Blessed One addressed the monks:

374. ‘‘Tena hi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūnaṃ vaccakuṭivattaṃ paññapessāmi yathā bhikkhūhi vaccakuṭiyā sammā vattitabbaṃ. Yo vaccakuṭiṃ gacchati tena bahi ṭhitena [bahi ṭhitena (sī. ka.)] ukkāsitabbaṃ. Anto nisinnenapi ukkāsitabbaṃ. Cīvaravaṃse vā cīvararajjuyā vā cīvaraṃ nikkhipitvā sādhukaṃ ataramānena vaccakuṭī pavisitabbā. Nātisahasā pavisitabbā. Na ubbhajitvā pavisitabbā.

374.“Well then, monks, I will lay down the observance for monks regarding the latrine, as to how monks should properly conduct themselves in the latrine. One who goes to the latrine should clear their throat while standing outside. One should also clear their throat while sitting inside. After placing the robe on the robe rack or robe cord, one should enter the latrine carefully, without hurrying. One should not enter too hastily. One should not enter while lifting one’s robes. One should lift one’s robes while standing on the latrine sandals. One should not defecate while grunting. One should not defecate while chewing a tooth-cleaning stick. One should not defecate outside the latrine trough. One should not urinate outside the urinal trough. One should not spit into the urinal trough. One should not scrape with a rough stick. One should not throw the scraping stick into the latrine pit. One should cover oneself while standing on the latrine sandals. One should not exit too hastily. One should not exit while lifting one’s robes. One should lift one’s robes while standing on the rinsing sandals. One should not make smacking sounds while rinsing. One should not leave water in the rinsing vessel. One should cover oneself while standing on the rinsing sandals.”

‘‘Sace vaccakuṭi uhatā [ūhatā (sī. syā.)] hoti, dhovitabbā. Sace avalekhanapidharo pūro hoti, avalekhanakaṭṭhaṃ chaḍḍetabbaṃ. Sace vaccakuṭi uklāpā hoti, vaccakuṭi sammajjitabbā.

“If the latrine is soiled, it should be washed. If the scraping-stick container is full, the scraping stick should be discarded. If the latrine is dirty, the latrine should be swept. If the equipment is dirty, the equipment should be swept. If the enclosure is dirty, the enclosure should be swept. If the store-room is dirty, the store-room should be swept. If there is no water in the rinsing pot, water should be poured into the rinsing pot. This, monks, is the observance for monks regarding the latrine, how monks should properly conduct themselves in the latrine.”

11.The Discussion on the Obligations to the Preceptor

375. Tena kho pana samayena saddhivihārikā upajjhāyesu na sammā vattanti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma saddhivihārikā upajjhāyesu na sammā vattissantī’’ti! Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, saddhivihārikā upajjhāyesu na sammā vattantī’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti vigarahi buddho bhagavā…pe… ‘‘kathañhi nāma, bhikkhave, saddhivihārikā upajjhāyesu na sammā vattissanti! Netaṃ, bhikkhave, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi –

375.At that time, the resident disciples were not conducting themselves properly toward their preceptors. Those monks who were modest... criticized and complained: "How can the resident disciples not conduct themselves properly toward their preceptors?" Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One... "Is it true, monks, that the resident disciples are not conducting themselves properly toward their preceptors?" "It is true, Blessed One." The Buddha rebuked them... "How can the resident disciples not conduct themselves properly toward their preceptors! This will not inspire confidence in the unconvinced..." Having rebuked them... he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks:

376. ‘‘Tena hi, bhikkhave, saddhivihārikānaṃ upajjhāyesu vattaṃ paññapessāmi yathā saddhivihārikehi upajjhāyesu sammā vattitabbaṃ. [mahāva. 66] Saddhivihārikena, bhikkhave, upajjhāyamhi sammā vattitabbaṃ. Tatrāyaṃ sammāvattanā –

376."Well then, monks, I will prescribe the observances for resident disciples towards their preceptors, how resident disciples should properly conduct themselves towards their preceptors. A resident disciple, monks, should conduct himself properly towards his preceptor. This is the proper conduct:

‘‘Kālasseva uṭṭhāya upāhanā omuñcitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā dantakaṭṭhaṃ dātabbaṃ, mukhodakaṃ dātabbaṃ, āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ. Sace yāgu hoti, bhājanaṃ dhovitvā yāgu upanāmetabbā. Yāguṃ pītassa udakaṃ datvā bhājanaṃ paṭiggahetvā nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena dhovitvā paṭisāmetabbaṃ. Upajjhāyamhi vuṭṭhite āsanaṃ uddharitabbaṃ. Sace so deso uklāpo hoti, so deso sammajjitabbo.

"Rising early, he should take off his sandals, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, and offer a tooth-cleaning stick and water for washing the mouth. He should prepare a seat. If there is rice gruel, he should wash the bowl and offer the rice gruel. After the rice gruel has been drunk, he should offer water, receive the bowl back, and carefully wash it, holding it low without bumping it, and put it away. When the preceptor rises, the seat should be removed. If the place is unswept, it should be swept."

‘‘Sace upajjhāyo gāmaṃ pavisitukāmo hoti, nivāsanaṃ dātabbaṃ, paṭinivāsanaṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ, kāyabandhanaṃ dātabbaṃ, saguṇaṃ katvā saṅghāṭiyo dātabbā, dhovitvā patto sodako [saudako (ka.)] dātabbo. Sace upajjhāyo pacchāsamaṇaṃ ākaṅkhati, timaṇḍalaṃ paṭicchādentena parimaṇḍalaṃ nivāsetvā kāyabandhanaṃ bandhitvā saguṇaṃ katvā saṅghāṭiyo pārupitvā gaṇṭhikaṃ paṭimuñcitvā dhovitvā pattaṃ gahetvā upajjhāyassa pacchāsamaṇena hotabbaṃ. Nātidūre gantabbaṃ, nāccāsanne gantabbaṃ, pattapariyāpannaṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ. Na upajjhāyassa bhaṇamānassa antarantarā kathā opātetabbā. Upajjhāyo āpattisāmantā bhaṇamāno nivāretabbo.

"If the preceptor wishes to enter the village, his lower robe should be given, and the robe he takes off should be received. His belt should be given, and the outer robes, properly folded, should be given. The bowl, washed and with water, should be given. If the preceptor wants a follower, the disciple, covering the three circles (of the body), should don the lower robe evenly, fasten the belt, properly arrange the outer robes, untie the knot, wash the bowl, take it, and attend the preceptor as his follower. He should not go too far away or too close. The bowl and its requisites should be received. One should not interrupt the preceptor while speaking. If the preceptor is speaking within the boundary of an offense, he should be restrained."

‘‘Nivattantena paṭhamataraṃ āgantvā āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipitabbaṃ, paccuggantvā pattacīvaraṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ, paṭinivāsanaṃ dātabbaṃ, nivāsanaṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ. Sace cīvaraṃ sinnaṃ hoti, muhuttaṃ uṇhe otāpetabbaṃ, na ca uṇhe cīvaraṃ nidahitabbaṃ. Cīvaraṃ saṅgharitabbaṃ. Cīvaraṃ saṅgharantena caturaṅgulaṃ kaṇṇaṃ ussāretvā cīvaraṃ saṅgharitabbaṃ – mā majjhe bhaṅgo ahosīti. Obhoge kāyabandhanaṃ kātabbaṃ.

"Upon returning, the first thing to do is prepare a seat, provide foot water, a footstool, and a foot-wiper; go out to meet him and receive his bowl and robe; a changing-robe should be given (to him), and his (worn) lower robe should be received (back). If the robe is damp, let it be warmed in the sun for a while, but do not leave the robe in the sun for too long. The robe should be folded carefully. When folding the robe, lift the edge four finger-widths and fold it so that there is no crease in the middle. The waistband should be placed in the fold (of the robe)."

‘‘Sace piṇḍapāto hoti, upajjhāyo ca bhuñjitukāmo hoti, udakaṃ datvā piṇḍapāto upanāmetabbo. Upajjhāyo pānīyena pucchitabbo. Bhuttāvissa udakaṃ datvā pattaṃ paṭiggahetvā nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena dhovitvā vodakaṃ katvā muhuttaṃ uṇhe otāpetabbo. Na ca uṇhe patto nidahitabbo. Pattacīvaraṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ. Pattaṃ nikkhipantena ekena hatthena pattaṃ gahetvā ekena hatthena heṭṭhāmañcaṃ vā heṭṭhāpīṭhaṃ vā parāmasitvā patto nikkhipitabbo. Na ca anantarahitāya bhūmiyā patto nikkhipitabbo. Cīvaraṃ nikkhipantena ekena hatthena cīvaraṃ gahetvā ekena hatthena cīvaravaṃsaṃ vā cīvararajjuṃ vā pamajjitvā pārato antaṃ orato bhogaṃ katvā cīvaraṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ. Upajjhāyamhi vuṭṭhite āsanaṃ uddharitabbaṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ paṭisāmetabbaṃ. Sace so deso uklāpo hoti, so deso sammajjitabbo.

"If there is almsfood and the preceptor wishes to eat, offer water and then present the almsfood. Ask the preceptor if he wants drinking water. After he has eaten, offer water, receive the bowl, lower it carefully, wash it thoroughly without scratching it, let the water drain away, and expose it to warmth briefly. Do not leave the bowl exposed to warmth for too long. Put away the bowl and robe. When putting away the bowl, hold the bowl with one hand, touch the lower bed-frame or the lower seat with the other hand, and then put the bowl down. Do not put the bowl down on the bare ground without an intervening layer. When putting away the robe, hold the robe with one hand, brush the robe-hanger or robe-cord with the other hand, fold the robe lengthwise from edge to inner fold, and then put the robe away. When the preceptor gets up, the seat should be put away, the foot-water, footstool, and foot-wiper should be put back in their places. If that place is untidy, that place should be swept."

‘‘Sace upajjhāyo nahāyitukāmo hoti, nahānaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ. Sace sītena attho hoti, sītaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ. Sace uṇhena attho hoti, uṇhaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ.

"If the preceptor wants to bathe, a bath should be prepared. If he needs cold water, cold water should be prepared. If he needs hot water, hot water should be prepared."

‘‘Sace upajjhāyo jantāgharaṃ pavisitukāmo hoti, cuṇṇaṃ sannetabbaṃ, mattikā temetabbā, jantāgharapīṭhaṃ ādāya upajjhāyassa piṭṭhito piṭṭhito gantvā jantāgharapīṭhaṃ datvā cīvaraṃ paṭiggahetvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ, cuṇṇaṃ dātabbaṃ, mattikā dātabbā. Sace ussahati, jantāgharaṃ pavisitabbaṃ. Jantāgharaṃ pavisantena mattikāya mukhaṃ makkhetvā purato ca pacchato ca paṭicchādetvā jantāgharaṃ pavisitabbaṃ. Na there bhikkhū anupakhajja nisīditabbaṃ. Na navā bhikkhū āsanena paṭibāhitabbā. Jantāghare upajjhāyassa parikammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Jantāgharā nikkhamantena jantāgharapīṭhaṃ ādāya purato ca pacchato ca paṭicchādetvā jantāgharā nikkhamitabbaṃ.

"If the preceptor wishes to enter the hot room, bath powder should be prepared and clay should be moistened. Taking the hot room stool, follow behind the preceptor, give the stool, receive the robe, and set it aside. Offer the bath powder and clay. If capable, one should enter the hot room. When entering the hot room, one should smear clay on the face, covering oneself front and back, and then enter. Senior monks should not be crowded while sitting. Junior monks should not be pushed away from their seats. In the hot room, the preceptor should be attended to. When leaving the hot room, taking the hot room stool, covering oneself front and back, one should exit the hot room."

‘‘Udakepi upajjhāyassa parikammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Nahātena paṭhamataraṃ uttaritvā attano gattaṃ vodakaṃ katvā nivāsetvā upajjhāyassa gattato udakaṃ pamajjitabbaṃ, nivāsanaṃ dātabbaṃ, saṅghāṭi dātabbā, jantāgharapīṭhaṃ ādāya paṭhamataraṃ āgantvā āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipitabbaṃ.

"Attend to the preceptor’s needs even in the water. After bathing, be the first to come out, dry your own body, put on your lower robe, wipe the water from the preceptor’s body, offer him his lower robe and outer robe, take the hot bath stool, return first, prepare a seat, and set out foot water, a footstool, and a foot-washing stone. Ask the preceptor if he wants drinking water. If he wants to have something recited, it should be recited. If he wants to question [you], [you] should answer."

If dissatisfaction arises in the preceptor, the disciple should appease him, have him appeased, or give him a Dhamma talk. If remorse arises in the preceptor, the disciple should dispel it, have it dispelled, or give him a Dhamma talk. If a wrong view arises in the preceptor, the disciple should dissuade him from it, have him dissuaded from it, or give him a Dhamma talk. If the preceptor has committed a grave offense warranting probation, the disciple should make an effort: 'How might the Saṅgha grant probation to the preceptor?' If the preceptor deserves to be returned to the beginning, the disciple should make an effort: 'How might the Saṅgha return the preceptor to the beginning?' If the preceptor deserves penance, the disciple should make an effort: 'How might the Saṅgha grant penance to the preceptor?' If the preceptor deserves reinstatement, the disciple should make an effort: 'How might the Saṅgha reinstate the preceptor?' If the Saṅgha wishes to inflict a disciplinary action on the preceptor—whether censure, demotion, banishment, requiring to ask pardon, or suspension—the disciple should make an effort: 'How might the Saṅgha not inflict the action on the preceptor, or modify it to a lighter one?' If the Saṅgha has already inflicted a disciplinary action on the preceptor—whether censure, demotion, banishment, requiring to ask pardon, or suspension—the disciple should make an effort: 'How might the preceptor behave properly, humble himself, reform himself, so that the Saṅgha might revoke that action?'

If the preceptor's robe needs to be washed, the disciple should wash it or make an effort—thinking, 'How can the preceptor's robe be washed?' If the preceptor's robe needs to be made, the disciple should make it or make an effort—thinking, 'How can the preceptor's robe be made?' If dye needs to be prepared for the preceptor, the disciple should prepare it or make an effort—thinking, 'How can dye be prepared for the preceptor?' If the preceptor's robe needs to be dyed, the disciple should dye it or make an effort—thinking, 'How can the preceptor's robe be dyed?' When dyeing the robe, one should carefully turn it over and over, and not leave while it is still dripping.

Without asking the preceptor, a bowl should not be given to anyone nor received from anyone; a robe should not be given to anyone nor received from anyone; requisites should not be given to anyone nor received from anyone; one should not cut anyone's hair nor have anyone's hair cut; one should not perform service for anyone nor have service performed for anyone; one should not attend to anyone, nor have anyone attend to oneself; one should not be a junior attendant to anyone, nor should one take anyone as a junior attendant; almsfood should not be brought out for anyone, nor should one have almsfood brought out for anyone; without asking the preceptor, one should not enter a village; one should not go to a charnel ground; one should not depart to another direction. If the preceptor is sick, one should attend to him as long as he lives, awaiting his recovery. This, monks, is the duty of disciples towards their preceptors, that disciples should properly conduct themselves towards their preceptors.

12.The Account of the Duties of a Co-Resident

377. Tena kho pana samayena upajjhāyā saddhivihārikesu na sammā vattanti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma upajjhāyā saddhivihārikesu na sammā vattissantī’’ti! Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, upajjhāyā saddhivihārikesu na sammā vattantī’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi –

377.At that time, preceptors were not behaving properly towards their co-residents. Those monks who were modest [...] grumbled, criticized, and spread it about, saying: "How indeed can preceptors not behave properly towards their co-residents?" Then those monks reported this matter to the Blessed One. [...] "Is it true, monks, that preceptors are not behaving properly towards their co-residents?" "It is true, Blessed One." [...] Having rebuked them [...] and given a Dhamma talk, he addressed the monks:

378. ‘‘Tena hi, bhikkhave, upajjhāyānaṃ saddhivihārikesu vattaṃ paññapessāmi yathā upajjhāyehi saddhivihārikesu sammā vattitabbaṃ. [mahāva. 67] Upajjhāyena, bhikkhave, saddhivihārikamhi sammā vattitabbaṃ. Tatrāyaṃ sammāvattanā –

378."In that case, monks, I will lay down the duties of preceptors towards their co-residents, how preceptors should properly conduct themselves towards their co-residents. A preceptor, monks, should properly conduct himself towards his co-resident. This is the proper conduct:

‘‘Upajjhāyena, bhikkhave, saddhivihāriko saṅgahetabbo anuggahetabbo uddesena paripucchāya ovādena anusāsaniyā. Sace upajjhāyassa patto hoti, saddhivihārikassa patto na hoti, upajjhāyena saddhivihārikassa patto dātabbo, ussukkaṃ vā kātabbaṃ – kinti nu kho saddhivihārikassa patto uppajjiyethāti.

"Monks, a preceptor should treat a co-resident with consideration and kindness, through instruction, questioning, advice, and admonition. If the preceptor has a bowl but the co-resident does not, the preceptor should give the co-resident a bowl or make an effort, thinking, 'How indeed might a bowl arise for the co-resident?' If the preceptor has a robe but the co-resident does not, the preceptor should give the co-resident a robe or make an effort, thinking, 'How indeed might a robe arise for the co-resident?' If the preceptor has requisites but the co-resident does not, the preceptor should give the co-resident requisites or make an effort, thinking, 'How indeed might requisites arise for the co-resident?'"

‘‘Sace saddhivihāriko gilāno hoti, kālasseva uṭṭhāya dantakaṭṭhaṃ dātabbaṃ, mukhodakaṃ dātabbaṃ, āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ. Sace yāgu hoti, bhājanaṃ dhovitvā yāgu upanāmetabbā.

Sace so deso uklāpo hoti, so deso sammajjitabbo.

"If the co-resident is sick, one should rise early and provide a tooth-stick, water for washing the face, and prepare a seat. If there is rice-gruel, one should wash the bowl and offer the rice-gruel. After the co-resident has drunk the rice-gruel, one should give water, take back the bowl, lower it, wash it carefully without scraping, and put it away. When the co-resident has arisen, the seat should be removed. If that place is dirty, that place should be swept."

‘‘Sace saddhivihāriko gāmaṃ pavisitukāmo hoti, nivāsanaṃ dātabbaṃ, paṭinivāsanaṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ, kāyabandhanaṃ dātabbaṃ, saguṇaṃ katvā saṅghāṭiyo dātabbā, dhovitvā patto sodako dātabbo.

"If a co-resident wishes to enter a village, a lower robe should be given, and the worn lower robe should be received back; a belt should be given; the outer robes should be folded properly and given; and a washed bowl with water should be given."

‘‘Ettāvatā nivattissatīti āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipitabbaṃ, paccuggantvā pattacīvaraṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ, paṭinivāsanaṃ dātabbaṃ, nivāsanaṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ.

"Thinking, 'He will return by this time,' a seat should be prepared, foot-washing water, a footstool, and a foot-wiping cloth should be placed nearby. One should go to meet him and receive his bowl and robe. The worn lower robe should be received back, and a fresh lower robe should be given. If the robe is damp, it should be aired in the sun for a moment, but the robe should not be left in the sun. The robe should be folded. While folding the robe, it should be folded lifting the edge four finger-widths, thinking, 'May there not be a crease in the middle.' A belt should be placed in the fold."

‘‘Sace piṇḍapāto hoti, saddhivihāriko ca bhuñjitukāmo hoti, udakaṃ datvā piṇḍapāto upanāmetabbo. Saddhivihāriko pānīyena pucchitabbo.

"If there is almsfood, and the co-resident wishes to eat, after giving water, the almsfood should be offered. The co-resident should be asked about drinking water. After he has eaten, water should be given, the bowl received, lowered, and carefully washed without scraping it. After making it free of water, it should be aired for a short while in the sun, but the bowl should not be left in the sun. The bowl and robe should be put away. When putting away the bowl, one should hold the bowl with one hand and feel the lower bench or lower seat with the other hand before placing the bowl down. The bowl should not be placed directly on the bare ground. When putting away the robe, one should hold the robe with one hand and wipe clean the robe rack or robe cord with the other hand, then fold the robe from the far end to the near end and place it away. When the co-resident gets up, the seat should be removed, and the foot-water, footstool, and foot-wiping cloth should be put away. If that place is dirty, it should be swept."

‘‘Sace saddhivihāriko nahāyitukāmo hoti, nahānaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ. Sace sītena attho hoti, sītaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ. Sace uṇhena attho hoti, uṇhaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ.

"If the co-resident wants to bathe, bathing facilities should be prepared. If he needs cold water, cold water should be prepared. If he needs hot water, hot water should be prepared."

"If the co-resident wants to enter the hot room, bath powder should be prepared, clay should be moistened, and the hot room stool should be taken along. After giving the hot room stool, the robe should be received and placed aside. Bath powder should be given, and clay should be given. If one is able, one should enter the hot room. When entering the hot room, one should smear the face with clay, covering the front and back, and then enter the hot room. Senior monks should not be closely approached and sat near, nor should junior monks be pushed away from their seats. In the hot room, service should be done for the co-resident. When leaving the hot room, one should take the hot room stool, covering the front and back, and then exit the hot room."

‘‘Udakepi saddhivihārikassa parikammaṃ kātabbaṃ.

"In the water too, service should be done for the co-resident. After bathing, one should emerge first, dry one's own body, dress, then wipe the water from the co-resident’s body, give him a lower robe, and give him an outer robe. Taking the hot room stool, one should return first, prepare a seat, and set out foot-water, a footstool, and a foot-wiping cloth. The co-resident should be asked about drinking water."

‘‘Yasmiṃ vihāre saddhivihāriko viharati, sace so vihāro uklāpo hoti, sace ussahati, sodhetabbo. Vihāraṃ sodhentena paṭhamaṃ pattacīvaraṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ…pe… sace ācamanakumbhiyā udakaṃ na hoti, ācamanakumbhiyā udakaṃ āsiñcitabbaṃ.

"In the dwelling where a co-resident lives, if that dwelling is dirty, it should be cleaned if one is able. When cleaning the dwelling, first the bowl and robe should be taken out and put aside. [...] If there is no water in the washing pot, water should be poured into the washing pot."

"If discontent arises in the co-resident, the preceptor should appease it, or have it appeased, or give him a Dhamma talk. If remorse arises in the co-resident, the preceptor should dispel it, or have it dispelled, or give him a Dhamma talk. If a wrong view arises in the co-resident, the preceptor should remove it, or have it removed, or give him a Dhamma talk. If the co-resident has committed a grave offense deserving probation, the preceptor should make an effort: 'How indeed might the Saṅgha grant probation to the co-resident?' If the co-resident deserves to be restored to the beginning, the preceptor should make an effort: 'How indeed might the Saṅgha restore the co-resident to the beginning?' If the co-resident deserves penance, the preceptor should make an effort: 'How indeed might the Saṅgha grant penance to the co-resident?' If the co-resident deserves reinstatement, the preceptor should make an effort: 'How indeed might the Saṅgha reinstate the co-resident?' If the Saṅgha wishes to carry out a disciplinary action against the co-resident—whether censure, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, or suspension—the preceptor should make an effort: 'How indeed might the Saṅgha not carry out the action against the co-resident, or change it to a lighter one?' If the Saṅgha has already carried out a disciplinary action against the co-resident—whether censure, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, or suspension—the preceptor should make an effort: 'How indeed might the co-resident behave properly, humble himself, conduct himself so as to be reformed, so that the Saṅgha might rescind that action?'"

If the pupil’s robe needs washing, the preceptor should instruct him: 'Wash it like this,' or he should make an effort, thinking: 'How can the pupil’s robe be washed?' If the pupil’s robe needs making, the preceptor should instruct him: 'Make it like this,' or he should make an effort, thinking: 'How can the pupil’s robe be made?' If dye needs to be prepared for the pupil, the preceptor should instruct him: 'Prepare it like this,' or he should make an effort, thinking: 'How can dye be prepared for the pupil?' If the pupil’s robe needs dyeing, the preceptor should instruct him: 'Dye it like this,' or he should make an effort, thinking: 'How can the pupil’s robe be dyed?' When dyeing the robe, it should be carefully turned again and again, and one should not leave before the dripping stops. If the pupil is sick, he should be cared for as long as he lives, and one should wait for his recovery. This, monks, is the duty of preceptors toward their pupils, and this is how preceptors should properly conduct themselves toward their pupils.

13.The Discourse on the Teacher's Duty

379. Tena kho pana samayena antevāsikā ācariyesu na sammā vattanti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma antevāsikā ācariyesu na sammā vattissantī’’ti! Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, antevāsikā ācariyesu na sammā vattantī’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi –

379.At that time, the pupils were not behaving properly toward their teachers. Those monks who were modest… complained, criticized, and spread it about, saying, “How can the pupils not behave properly toward their teachers?” Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One… “Is it true, monks, that the pupils are not behaving properly toward their teachers?” “It is true, Blessed One.”… Having rebuked them… Having given a Dhamma talk, he addressed the monks:

380. ‘‘Tena hi, bhikkhave, antevāsikānaṃ ācariyesu vattaṃ paññapessāmi yathā antevāsikehi ācariyesu sammā vattitabbaṃ. [mahāva. 78] Antevāsikena, bhikkhave, ācariyamhi sammā vattitabbaṃ. Tatrāyaṃ sammāvattanā –

380.“Well then, monks, I will formulate the duties of pupils towards their teachers, so that pupils will behave properly towards their teachers. A pupil, monks, should behave properly towards his teacher. This is proper conduct:

‘‘Kālasseva uṭṭhāya upāhanā omuñcitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā dantakaṭṭhaṃ dātabbaṃ, mukhodakaṃ dātabbaṃ, āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ. Sace yāgu hoti, bhājanaṃ dhovitvā yāgu upanāmetabbā. Yāguṃ pītassa udakaṃ datvā bhājanaṃ paṭiggahetvā nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena dhovitvā paṭisāmetabbaṃ. Ācariyamhi vuṭṭhite āsanaṃ uddharitabbaṃ. Sace so deso uklāpo hoti, so deso sammajjitabbo.

“Rising early, he should take off his sandals, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, and offer a tooth-stick and water for rinsing the mouth. He should prepare a seat. If there is rice-gruel, he should wash the bowl and offer the rice-gruel. After the rice-gruel has been drunk, he should offer water, receive the bowl, hold it low, wash it carefully without bumping it, and put it away. When the teacher has risen, he should remove the seat. If the place is dusty, he should sweep it.

‘‘Sace ācariyo gāmaṃ pavisitukāmo hoti, nivāsanaṃ dātabbaṃ, paṭinivāsanaṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ, kāyabandhanaṃ dātabbaṃ, saguṇaṃ katvā saṅghāṭiyo dātabbā, dhovitvā patto sodako dātabbo. Sace ācariyo pacchāsamaṇaṃ ākaṅkhati, timaṇḍalaṃ paṭicchādentena parimaṇḍalaṃ nivāsetvā kāyabandhanaṃ bandhitvā saguṇaṃ katvā saṅghāṭiyo pārupitvā gaṇṭhikaṃ paṭimuñcitvā dhovitvā pattaṃ gahetvā ācariyassa pacchāsamaṇena hotabbaṃ. Nātidūre gantabbaṃ, nāccāsanne gantabbaṃ, pattapariyāpannaṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ. Na ācariyassa bhaṇamānassa antarantarā kathā opātetabbā. Ācariyo āpattisāmantā bhaṇamāno nivāretabbo.

“If the teacher wishes to enter the village, the lower robe should be given to him, and the lower robe should be received back. The belt should be given to him. Having folded the outer robes skillfully, the outer robes should be given to him. A washed bowl with water should be given. If the teacher desires an attendant, having covered the three circles of the body, having arranged his lower robe neatly, fastened the belt, skillfully folded the outer robes, put them on, untied the knot, and taken a washed bowl, he should be the teacher’s attendant. He should not go too far, nor should he go too close. He should receive the bowl when appropriate. He should not interrupt the teacher while he is speaking. If the teacher is speaking in the neighborhood of an offense, he should restrain him.

‘‘Nivattantena paṭhamataraṃ āgantvā āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipitabbaṃ, paccuggantvā pattacīvaraṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ, paṭinivāsanaṃ dātabbaṃ, nivāsanaṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ. Sace cīvaraṃ sinnaṃ hoti, muhuttaṃ uṇhe otāpetabbaṃ, na ca uṇhe cīvaraṃ nidahitabbaṃ. Cīvaraṃ saṅgharitabbaṃ. Cīvaraṃ saṅgharantena caturaṅgulaṃ kaṇṇaṃ ussāretvā cīvaraṃ saṅgharitabbaṃ – mā majjhe bhaṅgo ahosīti. Obhoge kāyabandhanaṃ kātabbaṃ.

Upon returning, the first thing to do is prepare a seat, provide foot water, a footstool, and a foot-scraper, go out to meet him and receive his bowl and robe, offer him a fresh lower robe, and receive the lower robe he takes off. If the robe is damp, let it be warmed in the sun for a while, but do not leave the robe in the sun for too long. The robe should be folded carefully. When folding the robe, lift the edge four finger-widths and fold it so that there is no crease in the middle. A waistband should be fastened around the waist.

‘‘Sace piṇḍapāto hoti, ācariyo ca bhuñjitukāmo hoti, udakaṃ datvā piṇḍapāto upanāmetabbo. Ācariyo pānīyena pucchitabbo. Bhuttāvissa udakaṃ datvā pattaṃ paṭiggahetvā nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena dhovitvā vodakaṃ katvā muhuttaṃ uṇhe otāpetabbo, na ca uṇhe patto nidahitabbo. Pattacīvaraṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ. Pattaṃ nikkhipantena ekena hatthena pattaṃ gahetvā ekena hatthena heṭṭhāmañcaṃ vā heṭṭhāpīṭhaṃ vā parāmasitvā patto nikkhipitabbo. Na ca anantarahitāya bhūmiyā patto nikkhipitabbo.

If there is almsfood and the teacher wishes to eat, after giving water, the almsfood should be offered. The teacher should be asked for drinking water. After he has eaten, water should be given, the bowl received, lowered, and carefully washed without scraping it. After making it free of water, it should be warmed for a short while in the heat, but the bowl should not be left exposed to the heat. The bowl and robe should be put away. When putting away the bowl, one should take the bowl with one hand, feel the lower bench or lower stool with the other hand, and then place the bowl down. The bowl should not be placed directly on the bare ground. When putting away the robe, one should take the robe with one hand, smooth out the robe rack or robe cord with the other hand, fold the robe from edge to edge, and then put it away. When the teacher gets up, the seat should be removed, and the foot-water, footstool, and foot-scraper should be put away. If the place is dusty, it should be swept.

‘‘Sace ācariyo nahāyitukāmo hoti, nahānaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ. Sace sītena attho hoti, sītaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ. Sace uṇhena attho hoti, uṇhaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ.

If the teacher wants to bathe, bathing facilities should be prepared. If he wants it cold, cold water should be prepared. If he wants it hot, hot water should be prepared.

‘‘Sace ācariyo jantāgharaṃ pavisitukāmo hoti, cuṇṇaṃ sannetabbaṃ, mattikā temetabbā, jantāgharapīṭhaṃ ādāya ācariyassa piṭṭhito piṭṭhito gantvā jantāgharapīṭhaṃ datvā cīvaraṃ paṭiggahetvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ, cuṇṇaṃ dātabbaṃ, mattikā dātabbā. Sace ussahati, jantāgharaṃ pavisitabbaṃ. Jantāgharaṃ pavisantena mattikāya mukhaṃ makkhetvā purato ca pacchato ca paṭicchādetvā jantāgharaṃ pavisitabbaṃ. Na there bhikkhū anupakhajja nisīditabbaṃ.

If the teacher wishes to enter the hot room, powder should be prepared, clay should be moistened, and the hot room stool should be taken. Following behind the teacher, the hot room stool should be given, the robe received, and placed aside. Powder should be given, and clay should be given. If one is able, one should enter the hot room. When entering the hot room, one should smear the face with clay, covering oneself in front and in back, and enter the hot room. One should not sit crowding the senior monks. New monks should not be obstructed from a seat. In the hot room, one should attend to the teacher’s needs. When leaving the hot room, one should take the hot room stool, covering oneself in front and in back, and then exit the hot room.

‘‘Udakepi ācariyassa parikammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Nahātena paṭhamataraṃ uttaritvā attano gattaṃ vodakaṃ katvā nivāsetvā ācariyassa gattato udakaṃ pamajjitabbaṃ, nivāsanaṃ dātabbaṃ, saṅghāṭi dātabbā, jantāgharapīṭhaṃ ādāya paṭhamataraṃ āgantvā āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipitabbaṃ. Ācariyo pānīyena pucchitabbo. Sace uddisāpetukāmo hoti, uddisitabbo. Sace paripucchitukāmo hoti, paripucchitabbo.

In the water too, service should be done for the teacher. After bathing, one should emerge first, dry one's own body, dress, then wipe the water from the teacher's body, give him the lower robe, and give him the outer robe. Taking the hot-bath stool, one should return first, prepare the seat, and set out the foot-water, footstool, and foot-towel. The teacher should be asked about drinking water. If he wishes to have something recited, it should be recited for him. If he wishes to question, he should be questioned.

‘‘Yasmiṃ vihāre ācariyo viharati, sace so vihāro uklāpo hoti, sace ussahati, sodhetabbo. Vihāraṃ sodhentena paṭhamaṃ pattacīvaraṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; nisīdanapaccattharaṇaṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; bhisibibbohanaṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; mañco nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena asaṅghaṭṭentena kavāṭapiṭṭhaṃ, nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbo; pīṭhaṃ nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena, asaṅghaṭṭentena kavāṭapiṭṭhaṃ, nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; mañcapaṭipādakā nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbā; kheḷamallako nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbo; apassenaphalakaṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ; bhūmattharaṇaṃ yathāpaññattaṃ sallakkhetvā nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ.

Saṅkāraṃ vicinitvā ekamantaṃ chaḍḍetabbaṃ.

In the dwelling where the teacher resides, if that dwelling is untidy, and one is able, it should be cleaned. When cleaning the dwelling, first take out the bowl and robe and set them aside. Take out the sitting mat and spread and set them aside. Take out the mattress and pillow and set them aside. Lower the bed carefully, without scraping or knocking it against the doorposts, and take it out and set it aside. Lower the stool carefully, without scraping or knocking it against the doorposts, and take it out and set it aside. Take out the bed legs and set them aside. Take out the spittoon and set it aside.

If the walls have been treated with red ochre and are stained, moisten a cloth, wring it out, and wipe them. If the floor has been treated with black color and is stained, moisten a cloth, wring it out, and wipe it. If the floor is untreated, sprinkle it with water and sweep it—lest the dwelling be covered by dust. Gather the rubbish and discard it in one place.

‘‘Bhūmattharaṇaṃ otāpetvā sodhetvā papphoṭetvā atiharitvā yathāpaññattaṃ paññapetabbaṃ. Mañcapaṭipādakā otāpetvā pamajjitvā atiharitvā yathāṭhāne ṭhapetabbā.

If discontent arises in the teacher, the student should help him allay it, or have it allayed, or give him a Dhamma talk. If remorse arises in the teacher, the student should help him dispel it, or have it dispelled, or give him a Dhamma talk. If a wrong view arises in the teacher, the student should help him clarify it, or have it clarified, or give him a Dhamma talk. If the teacher has committed a serious offense requiring probation, the student should make an effort: 'How can the Sangha grant probation to the teacher?' If the teacher deserves to be relegated to the beginning, the student should make an effort: 'How can the Sangha relegate the teacher to the beginning?' If the teacher deserves penance, the student should make an effort: 'How can the Sangha grant penance to the teacher?' If the teacher deserves reinstatement, the student should make an effort: 'How can the Sangha reinstate the teacher?' If the Sangha wishes to take action against the teacher—whether an act of censure, an act of subordination, an act of banishment, an act of reconciliation, or an act of suspension—the student should make an effort: 'How can the Sangha not take action against the teacher, or turn it into a lighter one?' But if the Sangha has already taken action—whether an act of censure, an act of subordination, an act of banishment, an act of reconciliation, or an act of suspension—the student should make an effort: 'How can the teacher behave properly, humble himself, conduct himself according to the guidance, so that the Sangha may revoke that action?'

If the teacher's robe needs washing, the student should wash it or make an effort, thinking, 'How can the teacher's robe be washed?' If the teacher's robe needs making, the student should make it or make an effort, thinking, 'How can the teacher's robe be made?' If dye needs to be prepared for the teacher, the student should prepare it or make an effort, thinking, 'How can dye be prepared for the teacher?' If the teacher's robe needs dyeing, the student should dye it or make an effort, thinking, 'How can the teacher's robe be dyed?' When dyeing the robe, one should carefully turn it over and over, and not leave before the dye is thoroughly absorbed.

‘‘Na ācariyaṃ anāpucchā ekaccassa patto dātabbo, na ekaccassa patto paṭiggahetabbo; na ekaccassa cīvaraṃ dātabbaṃ, na ekaccassa cīvaraṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ; na ekaccassa parikkhāro dātabbo, na ekaccassa parikkhāro paṭiggahetabbo; na ekaccassa kesā cheditabbā, na ekaccena kesā chedāpetabbā; na ekaccassa parikammaṃ kātabbaṃ, na ekaccena parikammaṃ kārāpetabbaṃ; na ekaccassa veyyāvacco kātabbo, na ekaccena veyyāvacco kārāpetabbo; na ekaccassa pacchāsamaṇena hotabbaṃ, na ekacco pacchāsamaṇo ādātabbo; na ekaccassa piṇḍapāto nīharitabbo, na ekaccena piṇḍapāto nīharāpetabbo; na ācariyaṃ anāpucchā gāmo pavisitabbo; na susānaṃ gantabbaṃ; na disā pakkamitabbā.

Without asking the teacher, a bowl should not be given to another, nor should a bowl be received from another; a robe should not be given to another, nor should a robe be received from another; requisites should not be given to another, nor should requisites be received from another; hair should not be cut for another, nor should one have one's hair cut by another; personal services should not be performed for another, nor should one have personal services performed by another; help should not be given to another, nor should one have help given by another; one should not be a junior attendant to another, nor should one take another as a junior attendant; alms-food should not be carried out for another, nor should one have alms-food carried out by another; without asking the teacher, the village should not be entered; the charnel ground should not be gone to; one should not depart to another direction. If the teacher is sick, he should be attended to for life, his recovery should be awaited. This, monks, is the duty of resident pupils towards their teachers, according to how resident pupils should properly conduct themselves towards their teachers.

14.The Discourse on the Duties of a Resident Student

381. Tena kho pana samayena ācariyā antevāsikesu na sammā vattanti. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma ācariyā antevāsikesu na sammā vattissantī’’ti! Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā bhikkhū paṭipucchi – ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, ācariyā antevāsikesu na sammā vattantī’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi –

381.Now at that time, teachers were not properly behaving towards their students. Those monks who were of few wishes… complained, criticized, and protested: “How can teachers not properly behave towards their students!” Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, in connection with this incident, on this occasion, convened the Sangha and asked the monks: “Is it true, monks, that teachers are not properly behaving towards their students?” “It is true, Blessed One.”… Having rebuked them… the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks:

382. ‘‘Tena hi, bhikkhave, ācariyānaṃ antevāsikesu vattaṃ paññapessāmi yathā ācariyehi antevāsikesu sammā vattitabbaṃ. [mahāva. 79] Ācariyena, bhikkhave, antevāsikamhi sammā vattitabbaṃ. Tatrāyaṃ sammāvattanā –

382.“Well then, monks, I will lay down the duties of teachers towards their students, as teachers should properly behave towards their students. A teacher, monks, should properly behave towards his student. Here is the proper conduct:

‘‘Ācariyena, bhikkhave, antevāsiko saṅgahetabbo anuggahetabbo uddesena paripucchāya ovādena anusāsaniyā. Sace ācariyassa patto hoti, antevāsikassa patto na hoti, ācariyena antevāsikassa patto dātabbo, ussukkaṃ vā kātabbaṃ – kinti nu kho antevāsikassa patto uppajjiyethāti. Sace ācariyassa cīvaraṃ hoti, antevāsikassa cīvaraṃ na hoti, ācariyena antevāsikassa cīvaraṃ dātabbaṃ, ussukkaṃ vā kātabbaṃ – kinti nu kho antevāsikassa cīvaraṃ uppajjiyethāti. Sace ācariyassa parikkhāro hoti, antevāsikassa parikkhāro na hoti, ācariyena antevāsikassa parikkhāro dātabbo, ussukkaṃ vā kātabbaṃ – kinti nu kho antevāsikassa parikkhāro uppajjiyethāti.

“Monks, a teacher should embrace and support a student through instruction, questioning, advice, and training. If the teacher has a bowl but the student does not, the teacher should give the student a bowl, or make an effort, thinking, ‘How can a bowl come to be for this student?’ If the teacher has a robe but the student does not, the teacher should give the student a robe, or make an effort, thinking, ‘How can a robe come to be for this student?’ If the teacher has requisites but the student does not, the teacher should give the student requisites, or make an effort, thinking, ‘How can requisites come to be for this student?’

‘‘Sace antevāsiko gilāno hoti, kālasseva uṭṭhāya dantakaṭṭhaṃ dātabbaṃ, mukhodakaṃ dātabbaṃ, āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ. Sace yāgu hoti, bhājanaṃ dhovitvā yāgu upanāmetabbā. Yāguṃ pītassa udakaṃ datvā bhājanaṃ paṭiggahetvā nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena dhovitvā paṭisāmetabbaṃ. Antevāsikamhi vuṭṭhite āsanaṃ uddharitabbaṃ. Sace so deso uklāpo hoti, so deso sammajjitabbo.

“If the student is sick, one should rise early and provide a tooth-cleaning stick and water for washing the mouth, and prepare a seat. If there is rice-gruel, one should wash the bowl and offer the rice-gruel to the student. After the student has drunk the rice-gruel, one should give water, receive the bowl, lower it, wash it carefully without making noise, and put it away. When the student has risen, one should remove the seat. If the place is dusty, it should be swept.”

‘‘Sace antevāsiko gāmaṃ pavisitukāmo hoti, nivāsanaṃ dātabbaṃ, paṭinivāsanaṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ, kāyabandhanaṃ dātabbaṃ, saguṇaṃ katvā saṅghāṭiyo dātabbā, dhovitvā patto sodako dātabbo.

“If the student wishes to enter the village, the lower robe should be given, the worn lower robe should be received, the belt should be given, the outer robes should be folded properly and given, and the bowl, washed and with water, should be given.”

‘‘Ettāvatā nivattissatīti āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipitabbaṃ, paccuggantvā pattacīvaraṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ, paṭinivāsanaṃ dātabbaṃ, nivāsanaṃ paṭiggahetabbaṃ. Sace cīvaraṃ sinnaṃ hoti, muhuttaṃ uṇhe otāpetabbaṃ, na ca uṇhe cīvaraṃ nidahitabbaṃ. Cīvaraṃ saṅgharitabbaṃ. Cīvaraṃ saṅgharantena caturaṅgulaṃ kaṇṇaṃ ussāretvā cīvaraṃ saṅgharitabbaṃ – mā majjhe bhaṅgo ahosīti. Obhoge kāyabandhanaṃ kātabbaṃ.

“When he is expected to return, a seat should be prepared, foot-washing water, a footstool, and a foot-wiping cloth should be placed nearby; he should be met, his bowl and robe received, a fresh lower robe given, and the worn lower robe received. If the robe is damp, it should be aired in the sun for a moment, but the robe should not be left in the sun. The robe should be folded. While folding the robe, it should be folded lifting the edge four finger-widths, thinking, ‘May there not be a crease in the middle.’ A belt loop should be made at the hem.”

‘‘Sace piṇḍapāto hoti, antevāsiko ca bhuñjitukāmo hoti, udakaṃ datvā piṇḍapāto upanāmetabbo. Antevāsiko pānīyena pucchitabbo. Bhuttāvissa udakaṃ datvā pattaṃ paṭiggahetvā nīcaṃ katvā sādhukaṃ appaṭighaṃsantena dhovitvā vodakaṃ katvā muhuttaṃ uṇhe otāpetabbo, na ca uṇhe patto nidahitabbo. Pattacīvaraṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ. Pattaṃ nikkhipantena…pe… cīvaraṃ nikkhipantena…pe… pārato antaṃ orato bhogaṃ katvā cīvaraṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ. Antevāsikamhi uṭṭhite āsanaṃ uddharitabbaṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ paṭisāmetabbaṃ. Sace so deso uklāpo hoti, so deso sammajjitabbo.

“If there is almsfood, and the student wants to eat, water should be given and the almsfood should be offered to the student. The student should be asked for drinking water. After the student has eaten, water should be given, the bowl received, lowered, carefully washed without scraping, drained, and briefly aired in the sun; but the bowl should not be left in the sun. The bowl and robe should be put away. When putting away the bowl… when putting away the robe… the robe should be folded with the outer edge innermost and the inner fold outwards before being put away. When the student has risen, the seat should be put away, the foot-washing water, footstool, and foot-scraper returned to their places. If that place is dusty, that place should be swept.”

‘‘Sace antevāsiko nahāyitukāmo hoti, nahānaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ. Sace sītena attho hoti, sītaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ. Sace uṇhena attho hoti, uṇhaṃ paṭiyādetabbaṃ.

“If the student wants to bathe, bathing facilities should be prepared. If cold water is needed, cold water should be prepared. If hot water is needed, hot water should be prepared.”

‘‘Sace antevāsiko jantāgharaṃ pavisitukāmo hoti, cuṇṇaṃ sannetabbaṃ, mattikā temetabbā, jantāgharapīṭhaṃ ādāya [ādāya antevāsikassa piṭṭhito piṭṭhito (ka.)] gantvā jantāgharapīṭhaṃ datvā cīvaraṃ paṭiggahetvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ, cuṇṇaṃ dātabbaṃ, mattikā dātabbā. Sace ussahati jantāgharaṃ pavisitabbaṃ. Jantāgharaṃ pavisantena mattikāya mukhaṃ makkhetvā purato ca pacchato ca paṭicchādetvā jantāgharaṃ pavisitabbaṃ. Na there bhikkhū anupakhajja nisīditabbaṃ. Na navā bhikkhū āsanena paṭibāhitabbā. Jantāghare antevāsikassa parikammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Jantāgharā nikkhamantena jantāgharapīṭhaṃ ādāya purato ca pacchato ca paṭicchādetvā jantāgharā nikkhamitabbaṃ.

“If the student wants to enter the hot room, powder should be prepared, clay moistened, and the hot room stool taken. Having gone, the hot room stool should be given, the robe received, and put aside. Powder should be given, clay should be given. If one is able, one should enter the hot room. When entering the hot room, one should smear the face with clay, covering the front and the back, and enter the hot room. A senior monk should not be sat upon too closely. Junior monks should not be pushed off their seats. In the hot room, the student should be attended to. When leaving the hot room, the hot room stool should be taken, covering the front and the back, and one should leave the hot room.”

‘‘Udakepi antevāsikassa parikammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Nahātena paṭhamataraṃ uttaritvā attano gattaṃ vodakaṃ katvā nivāsetvā antevāsikassa gattato udakaṃ pamajjitabbaṃ, nivāsanaṃ dātabbaṃ, saṅghāṭi dātabbā, jantāgharapīṭhaṃ ādāya paṭhamataraṃ āgantvā āsanaṃ paññapetabbaṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ pādakathalikaṃ upanikkhipitabbaṃ, antevāsiko pānīyena pucchitabbo.

“In the water too, service should be done for the student. After bathing, having come out first, having made one’s own body dry and put on the lower robe, water should be wiped from the student’s body, the lower robe should be given, the outer robe should be given, taking the bathroom stool, having come first, a seat should be arranged, foot-washing water, a footstool, and a foot-wiper should be placed, and the student should be asked about drinking water.”

‘‘Yasmiṃ vihāre antevāsiko viharati, sace so vihāro uklāpo hoti, sace ussahati, sodhetabbo. Vihāraṃ sodhentena paṭhamaṃ pattacīvaraṃ nīharitvā ekamantaṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ…pe… ācamanakumbhiyā udakaṃ na hoti, ācamanakumbhiyā udakaṃ āsiñcitabbaṃ.

“In whichever dwelling a student resides, if that dwelling is dirty and one is able, it should be cleaned. When cleaning the dwelling, first the bowl and robe should be taken out and set aside… If there is no water in the wash basin, water should be poured into the wash basin.”

‘‘Sace antevāsikassa anabhirati uppannā hoti, ācariyena vūpakāsetabbo, vūpakāsāpetabbo, dhammakathā vāssa kātabbā. Sace antevāsikassa kukkuccaṃ uppannaṃ hoti, ācariyena vinodetabbaṃ, vinodāpetabbaṃ, dhammakathā vāssa kātabbā.

Sace antevāsiko garudhammaṃ ajjhāpanno hoti, parivāsāraho, ācariyena ussukkaṃ kātabbaṃ – kinti nu kho saṅgho antevāsikassa parivāsaṃ dadeyyāti.

Sace antevāsiko abbhānāraho hoti, ācariyena ussukkaṃ kātabbaṃ – kinti nu kho saṅgho antevāsikaṃ abbheyyāti. Sace saṅgho antevāsikassa kammaṃ kattukāmo hoti, tajjanīyaṃ vā niyassaṃ vā pabbājanīyaṃ vā paṭisāraṇīyaṃ vā ukkhepanīyaṃ vā, ācariyena ussukkaṃ kātabbaṃ – kinti nu kho saṅgho antevāsikassa kammaṃ na kareyya, lahukāya vā pariṇāmeyyāti. Kataṃ vā panassa hoti, saṅghena kammaṃ, tajjanīyaṃ vā niyassaṃ vā pabbājanīyaṃ vā paṭisāraṇīyaṃ vā ukkhepanīyaṃ vā, ācariyena ussukkaṃ kātabbaṃ – kinti nu kho antevāsiko sammā vatteyya, lomaṃ pāteyya, netthāraṃ vatteyya, saṅgho taṃ kammaṃ paṭippassambheyyāti.

“If dissatisfaction arises in a student, the teacher should try to dispel it, have it dispelled, or give them a Dhamma talk. If remorse arises in a student, the teacher should dispel it, have it dispelled, or give them a Dhamma talk. If a wrong view arises in a student, the teacher should remove it, have it removed, or give them a Dhamma talk. If a student has committed a serious offense warranting probation, the teacher should make an effort: ‘How might the Sangha grant probation to the student?’ If a student is liable to be sent back to the starting point, the teacher should make an effort: ‘How might the Sangha send the student back to the starting point?’ If a student is fit for penance, the teacher should make an effort: ‘How might the Sangha grant penance to the student?’ If a student is fit for reinstatement, the teacher should make an effort: ‘How might the Sangha reinstate the student?’ If the Sangha wishes to carry out an action against a student—whether censure, degradation, expulsion, requiring amends, or suspension—the teacher should make an effort: ‘How might the Sangha not carry out an action against the student, or change it to a lighter one?’ If an action has been carried out against them by the Sangha—whether censure, degradation, expulsion, requiring amends, or suspension—the teacher should make an effort: ‘How might the student behave properly, humble themselves, adopt a path to improvement, so that the Sangha might revoke that action?’”

‘‘Sace antevāsikassa cīvaraṃ dhovitabbaṃ hoti, ācariyena ācikkhitabbaṃ – evaṃ dhoveyyāsīti, ussukkaṃ vā kātabbaṃ – kinti nu kho antevāsikassa cīvaraṃ dhoviyethāti. Sace antevāsikassa cīvaraṃ kātabbaṃ hoti, ācariyena ācikkhitabbaṃ – evaṃ kareyyāsīti, ussukkaṃ vā kātabbaṃ – kinti nu kho antevāsikassa cīvaraṃ kariyethāti. Sace antevāsikassa rajanaṃ pacitabbaṃ hoti, ācariyena ācikkhitabbaṃ – evaṃ paceyyāsīti, ussukkaṃ vā kātabbaṃ – kinti nu kho antevāsikassa rajanaṃ paciyethāti. Sace antevāsikassa cīvaraṃ rajitabbaṃ hoti, ācariyena ācikkhitabbaṃ – evaṃ rajeyyāsīti, ussukkaṃ vā kātabbaṃ – kinti nu kho antevāsikassa cīvaraṃ rajiyethāti.

Idaṃ kho, bhikkhave, ācariyānaṃ antevāsikesu vattaṃ yathā ācariyehi antevāsikesu sammā vattitabba’’nti.

If a student’s robe needs washing, the teacher should instruct him: ‘You should wash it thus,’ or he should make an effort: ‘How might the student’s robe be washed?’ If a student’s robe needs making, the teacher should instruct him: ‘You should make it thus,’ or he should make an effort: ‘How might the student’s robe be made?’ If dye needs to be prepared for a student, the teacher should instruct him: ‘You should prepare it thus,’ or he should make an effort: ‘How might dye be prepared for the student?’ If a student’s robe needs dyeing, the teacher should instruct him: ‘You should dye it thus,’ or he should make an effort: ‘How might the student’s robe be dyed?’ When dyeing the robe, it should be carefully turned again and again. One should not leave while the dye is still dripping. If a student is sick, he should be cared for as long as life lasts, and one should wait for his recovery. This, bhikkhus, is the duty of teachers towards their students, how teachers should properly conduct themselves towards their students.

Vattakkhandhako aṭṭhamo.

Turning back with rice grains, well-covered and squatting; prescribed by the King of Dhamma, this is the duty concerning the refectory.
