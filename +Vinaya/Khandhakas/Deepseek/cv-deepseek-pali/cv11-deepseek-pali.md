1. At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Now at that time the Paṇḍukalohitaka monks were themselves quarrelsome, contentious, disputatious, given to brawls, and makers of issues in the Saṅgha. And approaching those other monks who were quarrelsome, contentious, disputatious, given to brawls, and makers of issues in the Saṅgha, they said: "Do not, venerable ones, let him win. Counter him with all your might. You are wiser, more discerning, more learned, and more capable than him. Do not be afraid of him. We will be on your side." Thus, disputes that had not arisen came to arise, and those that had arisen increased and expanded. Those monks who were of few desires... complained, criticised, and spread it about, saying: "How can the Paṇḍukalohitaka monks, being themselves quarrelsome, contentious, disputatious, given to brawls, and makers of issues in the Saṅgha, approach those other monks who were quarrelsome, contentious, disputatious, given to brawls, and makers of issues in the Saṅgha, and say: 'Do not, venerable ones, let him win. Counter him with all your might. You are wiser, more discerning, more learned, and more capable than him. Do not be afraid of him. We will be on your side.' Thus, disputes that had not arisen come to arise, and those that had arisen increase and expand?"

2. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā bhikkhū paṭipucchi – ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, paṇḍukalohitakā bhikkhū attanā bhaṇḍanakārakā kalahakārakā vivādakārakā bhassakārakā saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā, yepi caññe bhikkhū bhaṇḍanakārakā kalahakārakā vivādakārakā bhassakārakā saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā te upasaṅkamitvā evaṃ vadanti – ‘mā kho tumhe, āyasmanto, eso ajesi. Balavābalavaṃ paṭimantetha. Tumhe tena paṇḍitatarā ca byattatarā ca bahussutatarā ca alamattatarā ca. Mā cassa bhāyittha. Mayampi tumhākaṃ pakkhā bhavissāmā’ti. Tena anuppannāni ceva bhaṇḍanāni uppajjanti, uppannāni ca bhaṇḍanāni bhiyyobhāvāya vepullāya saṃvattantī’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā – ‘‘ananucchavikaṃ, bhikkhave, tesaṃ moghapurisānaṃ ananulomikaṃ appatirūpaṃ assāmaṇakaṃ akappiyaṃ akaraṇīyaṃ. Kathañhi nāma te, bhikkhave, moghapurisā attanā bhaṇḍanakārakā…pe… saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā, yepi caññe bhikkhū bhaṇḍanakārakā…pe… saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā te upasaṅkamitvā evaṃ vakkhanti – ‘mā kho tumhe, āyasmanto, eso ajesi. Balavābalavaṃ paṭimantetha. Tumhe tena paṇḍitatarā ca byattatarā ca bahussutatarā ca alamattatarā ca. Mā cassa bhāyittha. Mayampi tumhākaṃ pakkhā bhavissāmā’ti? Tena anuppannāni ceva bhaṇḍanāni uppajjanti, uppannāni ca bhaṇḍanāni bhiyyobhāvāya vepullāya saṃvattanti. Netaṃ, bhikkhave, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya pasannānaṃ vā bhiyyobhāvāya. Atha khvetaṃ, bhikkhave, appasannānañceva appasādāya pasannānañca ekaccānaṃ aññathattāyā’’ti.

2. Then those monks informed the Blessed One about this matter. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion and on this ground, had the Bhikkhu Saṅgha convened, and he questioned the monks: "Is it true, monks, that the Paṇḍukalohitaka monks are themselves quarrelsome, contentious, disputatious, given to brawls, and makers of issues in the Saṅgha, and that they approach those other monks who are quarrelsome, contentious, disputatious, given to brawls, and makers of issues in the Saṅgha, saying: 'Do not, venerable ones, let him win. Counter him with all your might. You are wiser, more discerning, more learned, and more capable than him. Do not be afraid of him. We will be on your side.' Thus, disputes that had not arisen came to arise, and those that had arisen increased and expanded?" "It is true, Blessed One." The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked them: "It is unsuitable, monks, for these foolish men, improper, unbecoming, unworthy of a recluse, unallowable, and should not be done. How can these foolish men, monks, being themselves quarrelsome, contentious, disputatious, given to brawls, and makers of issues in the Saṅgha, approach those other monks who are quarrelsome, contentious, disputatious, given to brawls, and makers of issues in the Saṅgha, and say: 'Do not, venerable ones, let him win. Counter him with all your might. You are wiser, more discerning, more learned, and more capable than him. Do not be afraid of him. We will be on your side.' Thus, disputes that had not arisen came to arise, and those that had arisen increased and expanded? This, monks, will not lead to confidence in those who are unconvinced, nor to increase in those who are convinced, but rather, monks, it will lead to lack of confidence in those who are unconvinced and to alteration in some of those who are convinced."

Atha kho bhagavā te [paṇḍukalohitake (syā.)] bhikkhū anekapariyāyena vigarahitvā dubbharatāya dupposatāya mahicchatāya asantuṭṭhitāya [asantuṭṭhatāya (syā.), asantuṭṭhiyā (sī.)] saṅgaṇikāya kosajjassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsitvā anekapariyāyena subharatāya suposatāya appicchassa santuṭṭhassa sallekhassa dhutassa pāsādikassa apacayassa vīriyārambhassa [viriyārambhassa (sī.), vīriyārabbhassa (ka.)] vaṇṇaṃ bhāsitvā bhikkhūnaṃ tadanucchavikaṃ tadanulomikaṃ dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘tena hi, bhikkhave, saṅgho paṇḍukalohitakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ tajjanīyakammaṃ karotu. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, kātabbaṃ. Paṭhamaṃ paṇḍukalohitakā bhikkhū codetabbā, codetvā sāretabbā, sāretvā āpattiṃ [āpatti (sī. syā.)] āropetabbā, āpattiṃ āropetvā byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

Then the Blessed One, having rebuked those monks in many ways, criticizing them for being difficult to support, difficult to nourish, very ambitious, discontented, delighting in company, and lazy, spoke in many ways in praise of being easy to support, easy to nourish, having few desires, content, practicing austerity, practicing the ascetic practices, inspiring confidence, humility, and energetic effort. Having given the monks a Dhamma talk suitable and appropriate to the occasion, he addressed them: "Well then, monks, let the Saṅgha perform the act of censure on the Paṇḍukalohitaka monks. And this, monks, is how it should be done. First, the Paṇḍukalohitaka monks should be admonished, then reminded, then made to incur an offense, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:

3. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ime paṇḍukalohitakā bhikkhū attanā bhaṇḍanakārakā kalahakārakā vivādakārakā bhassakārakā saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā, yepi caññe bhikkhū bhaṇḍanakārakā kalahakārakā vivādakārakā bhassakārakā saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā te upasaṅkamitvā evaṃ vadanti – ‘mā kho tumhe, āyasmanto, eso ajesi. Balavābalavaṃ paṭimantetha. Tumhe tena paṇḍitatarā ca byattatarā ca bahussutatarā ca alamattatarā ca. Mā cassa bhāyittha. Mayampi tumhākaṃ pakkhā bhavissāmā’ti. Tena anuppannāni ceva bhaṇḍanāni uppajjanti, uppannāni ca bhaṇḍanāni bhiyyobhāvāya vepullāya saṃvattanti. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho paṇḍukalohitakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ tajjanīyakammaṃ kareyya. Esā ñatti.

3. "Venerable sir, may the Sangha listen to me. These pale-red monks are themselves makers of quarrels, makers of disputes, makers of conflicts, makers of arguments, makers of legal cases in the Sangha. And those other monks who are makers of quarrels, makers of disputes, makers of conflicts, makers of arguments, makers of legal cases in the Sangha, approach them and say: 'Do not, venerable ones, let this one win. Respond to him forcefully. You are wiser than him, more skilled than him, more learned than him, and more competent than him. Do not be afraid of him. We too will be on your side.' Because of this, quarrels that had not arisen now arise, and those that had arisen increase and grow. If the Sangha is ready, the Sangha should perform the act of censure against the Paṇḍukalohitaka monks. This is the motion."

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ime paṇḍukalohitakā bhikkhū attanā bhaṇḍanakārakā…pe… saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā, yepi caññe bhikkhū bhaṇḍanakārakā…pe… saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā te upasaṅkamitvā evaṃ vadanti – ‘mā kho tumhe, āyasmanto, eso ajesi. Balavābalavaṃ paṭimantetha. Tumhe tena paṇḍitatarā ca byattatarā ca bahussutatarā ca alamattatarā ca. Mā cassa bhāyittha. Mayampi tumhākaṃ pakkhā bhavissāmā’ti. Tena anuppannāni ceva bhaṇḍanāni uppajjanti, uppannāni ca bhaṇḍanāni bhiyyobhāvāya vepullāya saṃvattanti. Saṅgho paṇḍukalohitakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ tajjanīyakammaṃ karoti. Yassāyasmato khamati paṇḍukalohitakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ tajjanīyassa kammassa karaṇaṃ, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

"Venerable sir, may the Sangha hear me. These Paṇḍukalohitaka monks are themselves makers of quarrels... makers of legal cases in the Sangha. And they approach other monks who are makers of quarrels... makers of legal cases in the Sangha, and say to them: 'Do not, venerable ones, let him win. Counter strength with strength. You are wiser than him, more skilled than him, more learned than him, and more competent than him. Do not fear him. We too will be on your side.' As a result, quarrels that had not arisen now arise, and those that had arisen increase and grow. The Sangha performs the act of censure against the Paṇḍukalohitaka monks. Let any venerable one who approves of performing the act of censure against the Paṇḍukalohitaka monks remain silent; let any who disapproves speak up."

‘‘Dutiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi – suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ime paṇḍukalohitakā bhikkhū attanā bhaṇḍanakārakā…pe… saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā, yepi caññe bhikkhū bhaṇḍanakārakā…pe… saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā te upasaṅkamitvā evaṃ vadanti – ‘mā kho tumhe, āyasmanto, eso ajesi. Balavābalavaṃ paṭimantetha. Tumhe tena paṇḍitatarā ca byattatarā ca bahussutatarā ca alamattatarā ca. Mā cassa bhāyittha. Mayampi tumhākaṃ pakkhā bhavissāmā’ti. Tena anuppannāni ceva bhaṇḍanāni uppajjanti, uppannāni ca bhaṇḍanāni bhiyyobhāvāya vepullāya saṃvattanti. Saṅgho paṇḍukalohitakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ tajjanīyakammaṃ karoti. Yassāyasmato khamati paṇḍukalohitakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ tajjanīyassa kammassa karaṇaṃ, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

For the second time, I speak on this matter: Venerable sir, may the Sangha hear me. These Paṇḍukalohitaka monks are themselves makers of quarrels… makers of legal cases in the Sangha. And they approach other monks who are makers of quarrels… makers of legal cases in the Sangha, and say to them: ‘Do not, venerable ones, let him win. Counter strength with strength. You are wiser than him, more skilled than him, more learned than him, and more competent than him. Do not fear him. We too will be on your side.’ As a result, quarrels that had not arisen now arise, and those that had arisen increase and grow. The Sangha performs the act of censure against the Paṇḍukalohitaka monks. Let any venerable one who approves of performing the act of censure against the Paṇḍukalohitaka monks remain silent; let any who disapproves speak up.

‘‘Tatiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi – suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ime paṇḍukalohitakā bhikkhū attanā bhaṇḍanakārakā…pe… saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā, yepi caññe bhikkhū bhaṇḍanakārakā…pe… saṅghe adhikaraṇakārakā te upasaṅkamitvā evaṃ vadanti – ‘mā kho tumhe, āyasmanto, eso ajesi. Balavābalavaṃ paṭimantetha. Tumhe tena paṇḍitatarā ca byattatarā ca bahussutatarā ca alamattatarā ca. Mā cassa bhāyittha. Mayampi tumhākaṃ pakkhā bhavissāmā’ti. Tena anuppannāni ceva bhaṇḍanāni uppajjanti, uppannāni ca bhaṇḍanāni bhiyyobhāvāya vepullāya saṃvattanti. Saṅgho paṇḍukalohitakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ tajjanīyakammaṃ karoti. Yassāyasmato khamati paṇḍukalohitakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ tajjanīyassa kammassa karaṇaṃ, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

For the third time, I speak on this matter: Venerable sir, may the Sangha hear me. These Paṇḍukalohitaka monks are themselves makers of quarrels… makers of legal cases in the Sangha. And they approach other monks who are makers of quarrels… makers of legal cases in the Sangha, and say to them: ‘Do not, venerable ones, let him win. Counter strength with strength. You are wiser than him, more skilled than him, more learned than him, and more competent than him. Do not fear him. We too will be on your side.’ As a result, quarrels that had not arisen now arise, and those that had arisen increase and grow. The Sangha performs the act of censure against the Paṇḍukalohitaka monks. Let any venerable one who approves of performing the act of censure against the Paṇḍukalohitaka monks remain silent; let any who disapproves speak up.

‘‘Kataṃ saṅghena paṇḍukalohitakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ tajjanīyakammaṃ. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

The Sangha has carried out the act of censure against the Paṇḍukalohitaka monks. The Sangha approves; therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it to be.

He should not give ordination; he should not give dependence; he should not have a novice attend on him; he should not accept appointment as an advisor of nuns; even when appointed, he should not advise nuns. He should not commit the offense for which the Sangha has imposed the act of censure, nor another similar offense, nor one worse than that. He should not criticize the act, nor those who performed it. The Uposatha should not be set aside for a regular monk, nor the Pavarana; no formal statement should be made; no charge should be initiated; no opportunity should be demanded; he should not accuse; he should not remind; he should not associate with other monks.

8. Then the Sangha performed the act of censure against the Paṇḍukalohitaka monks. Those monks, having been censured by the Sangha, behaved properly, made themselves amenable, practised the way of extrication, and approached the monks, saying: "Friends, we have been censured by the Sangha and are behaving properly, making ourselves amenable, practising the way of extrication. How should we proceed?" The monks reported this matter to the Blessed One… "Well then, monks, let the Sangha rescind the act of censure against the Paṇḍukalohitaka monks."

Those monks who have incurred the censure should approach the Saṅgha, arrange their upper robe over one shoulder, pay homage at the feet of the senior monks, sit in a squatting position, raise their joined palms, and say this: ‘Venerable sirs, we who have been subjected to the act of censure by the Saṅgha are behaving properly, we are amenable, we are conducting ourselves blamelessly, and we request the revocation of the act of censure.’ They should make this request a second time. They should make this request a third time. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha:

4. At that time, Venerable Seyyasaka was foolish, inept, prone to offenses, and not giving rise to their abandonment. He lived in close association with householders, engaging in unsuitable interactions with them. Moreover, the monks regularly gave him probation, subjected him to reversion to the root, imposed penance, and reinstated him. Those monks who were modest… murmured, were displeased, and protested: "How can Venerable Seyyasaka be so foolish, inept, prone to offenses, and not giving rise to their abandonment?

And how can the monks regularly give him probation, subject him to reversion to the root, impose penance, and reinstate him?" Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One.

Then the Blessed One, regarding this incident and this matter, having convened the Sangha of monks, questioned the monks: "Is it true, monks, that the monk Seyyasaka is foolish, inept, prone to offenses, and not giving rise to their abandonment; that he lives in close association with householders, engaging in unsuitable interactions with them; and that monks regularly give him probation, subject him to reversion to the root, impose penance, and reinstate him?" "It is true, Blessed One." The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked him: "Monks, for that worthless man, this is unsuitable, unbecoming, inappropriate, not in accordance with the life of a recluse, impermissible, not to be done. How could that worthless man, monks, be foolish, inept, prone to offenses, and not giving rise to their abandonment; live in close association with householders, engaging in unsuitable interactions with them; and for monks to regularly give him probation, subject him to reversion to the root, impose penance, and reinstate him? This will not lead to confidence in those who lack it… Having rebuked him… he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: "Well then, monks, let the Sangha carry out the act of dependence for the monk Seyyasaka—he should live in dependence. And this is how it should be done. First, the monk Seyyasaka should be charged; having been charged, he should be reminded; having been reminded, he should be charged with the offense; having been charged with the offense, a monk who is competent and capable should inform the Sangha…"

16.Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu on whom the act of dependence has been performed should conduct himself properly. Herein is the proper conduct: he should not give ordination; he should not grant dependence; he should not have a novice attend him; the appointment of him as instructor of nuns should not be accepted; and nuns should not be advised, even if authorized. He should not commit the offense for which the Sangha performed the act of dependence, nor any similar offense, nor one even more serious than that; the deed should not be criticized, nor the doers of the deed. The Uposatha of a bhikkhu in good standing should not be suspended, nor should the Pavāraṇā be suspended; he should not be made to give a statement; an accusation should not be preferred; no occasion should be given; he should not be questioned; he should not be prompted; and he should not be associated with bhikkhus.

Having been subjected to the act of dependence by the Sangha, associating with good friends, keeping company with them, and attending upon them, asking for instruction and questioning, he became learned, a master of tradition, a bearer of the Dhamma, a bearer of the Vinaya, a bearer of the matrices, wise, competent, intelligent, conscientious, scrupulous, and desirous of training. He conducted himself properly, made progress, and penetrated the teaching. Approaching the bhikkhus, he said: 'Friends, I have been subjected to the act of dependence by the Sangha. I conduct myself properly, make progress, and penetrate the teaching. How should I proceed?' The bhikkhus reported this matter to the Blessed One… 'Well then, bhikkhus, let the Sangha revoke the act of dependence for the bhikkhu Seyyasaka.'

Yāya āpattiyā saṅghena niyassakammaṃ kataṃ hoti taṃ āpattiṃ āpajjati, aññaṃ vā tādisikaṃ, tato vā pāpiṭṭhataraṃ; kammaṃ garahati, kammike garahati – imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno niyassakammaṃ nappaṭippassambhetabbaṃ.

Further, monks, for a bhikkhu endowed with five factors, the act of dependence should not be revoked. He commits the offense for which the Saṅgha imposed the act of dependence, or another similar to it, or one even worse; he disparages the act, he disparages those who carried out the act—these, monks, are the five factors for which the act of dependence should not be revoked.

‘‘Aṭṭhahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno niyassakammaṃ nappaṭippassambhetabbaṃ. Pakatattassa bhikkhuno uposathaṃ ṭhapeti, pavāraṇaṃ ṭhapeti, savacanīyaṃ karoti, anuvādaṃ paṭṭhapeti, okāsaṃ kāreti, codeti, sāreti, bhikkhūhi sampayojeti – imehi kho, bhikkhave, aṭṭhahaṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno niyassakammaṃ nappaṭippassambhetabbaṃ.

Monks, for a bhikkhu endowed with eight factors, the act of dependence should not be revoked. He arranges the Uposatha for a normal bhikkhu, he arranges the Pavāraṇā, he makes himself available for admonition, he establishes proceedings against offenders, he seeks an opportunity (to speak), he rebukes, he reminds, and he properly involves bhikkhus—these, monks, are the eight factors for which the act of dependence should not be revoked.

19.Monks, for a bhikkhu endowed with five factors, the act of dependence should be revoked. He does not give ordination, he does not grant dependence, he does not have a novice attend on him, he does not accept appointment as an instructor of nuns, and when appointed, he does not instruct nuns—monks, for a bhikkhu endowed with these five factors, the act of dependence should be revoked.

‘‘Aparehipi, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno niyassakammaṃ paṭippassambhetabbaṃ.

Further, monks, for a bhikkhu endowed with five factors, the act of dependence should be revoked. He does not commit the offense for which the Saṅgha imposed the act of dependence, or another similar to it, or one worse than that; he does not disparage the act, nor those who carried out the act. Monks, for a bhikkhu endowed with these five factors, the act of dependence should be revoked.

‘‘Aṭṭhahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno niyassakammaṃ paṭippassambhetabbaṃ.

Monks, for a bhikkhu endowed with eight factors, the act of dependence should be revoked.

20. ‘‘Evañca pana, bhikkhave, paṭippassambhetabbaṃ.

Dutiyampi yācitabbā. Tatiyampi yācitabbā. Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

20.And, monks, this is how it should be revoked. The bhikkhu who has been placed on probation should approach the Saṅgha, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, pay homage at the feet of the senior bhikkhus, sit in a squatting position, raise his joined palms, and say this: 'Venerable sirs, I, having been placed on probation by the Saṅgha, am conducting myself properly, am shaving my hair, am acting fittingly, and I request the revocation of the probation.' He should make this request a second time. He should make this request a third time. A competent and capable bhikkhu should then inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ seyyasako bhikkhu saṅghena niyassakammakato sammā vattati, lomaṃ pāteti, netthāraṃ vattati, niyassassa kammassa paṭippassaddhiṃ yācati. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho seyyasakassa bhikkhuno niyassakammaṃ paṭippassambheyya. Esā ñatti.

Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. This bhikkhu Seyyasaka, who has been subjected to the act of dependence by the Saṅgha, is conducting himself properly, has shaved his hair, is acting fittingly, and requests the revocation of the act of dependence. If it is agreeable to the Saṅgha, may the Saṅgha revoke the act of dependence for the bhikkhu Seyyasaka. This is the motion.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ seyyasako bhikkhu saṅghena niyassakammakato sammā vattati, lomaṃ pāteti, netthāraṃ vattati, niyassassa kammassa paṭippassaddhiṃ yācati.

Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. This bhikkhu Seyyasaka, who has been subjected to the act of dependence by the Saṅgha, is conducting himself properly, has shaved his hair, is acting fittingly, and requests the revocation of the act of dependence. The Saṅgha revokes the act of dependence for the bhikkhu Seyyasaka. Let those venerable ones who approve of the revocation of the act of dependence for the bhikkhu Seyyasaka remain silent; let those who do not approve speak.

‘‘Dutiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi – suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ seyyasako bhikkhu saṅghena niyassakammakato sammā vattati, lomaṃ pāteti, netthāraṃ vattati, niyassassa kammassa paṭippassaddhiṃ yācati.

For a second time, I speak on this matter—Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. This bhikkhu Seyyasaka, who has been subjected to the act of dependence by the Saṅgha, is conducting himself properly, has shaved his hair, is acting fittingly, and requests the revocation of the act of dependence. The Saṅgha revokes the act of dependence for the bhikkhu Seyyasaka. Let those venerable ones who approve of the revocation of the act of dependence for the bhikkhu Seyyasaka remain silent; let those who do not approve speak.

‘‘Tatiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi – suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ seyyasako bhikkhu saṅghena niyassakammakato sammā vattati, lomaṃ pāteti, netthāraṃ vattati, niyassassa kammassa paṭippassaddhiṃ yācati. Saṅgho seyyasakassa bhikkhuno niyassakammaṃ paṭippassambheti. Yassāyasmato khamati seyyasakassa bhikkhuno niyassassa kammassa paṭippassaddhi, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

For a third time, I speak on this matter—Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. This bhikkhu Seyyasaka, who has been subjected to the act of dependence by the Saṅgha, is conducting himself properly, has shaved his hair, is acting fittingly, and requests the revocation of the act of dependence. The Saṅgha revokes the act of dependence for the bhikkhu Seyyasaka. Let those venerable ones who approve of the revocation of the act of dependence for the bhikkhu Seyyasaka remain silent; let those who do not approve speak.

‘‘Paṭippassaddhaṃ saṅghena seyyasakassa bhikkhuno niyassakammaṃ. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

The act of dependence for the bhikkhu Seyyasaka has been revoked by the Saṅgha. The Saṅgha assents, therefore it is silent; thus I hold it.

Niyassakammaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ dutiyaṃ.

The second act of dependence is concluded.

21.Now at that time, the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu were residing at Kīṭāgiri—shameless, wicked bhikkhus. They engaged in such improper conduct as follows: they cultivated flower plants themselves or had them cultivated, watered them themselves or had them watered, picked flowers themselves or had them picked, strung garlands themselves or had them strung, made single-stemmed garlands themselves or had them made, made double-stemmed garlands themselves or had them made, made nosegays themselves or had them made, made decorative bunches themselves or had them made, made chaplets themselves or had them made, made head-wreaths themselves or had them made, made chest-ornaments themselves or had them made. They carried single-stemmed garlands for women of good families, daughters of good families, maidens of good families, daughters-in-law of good families, and female slaves of good families, or had them carried; and double-stemmed garlands, nosegays, decorative bunches, chaplets, head-wreaths, and chest-ornaments likewise. They ate from the same dish with women of good families, daughters of good families, maidens of good families, daughters-in-law of good families, and female slaves of good families; they drank from the same bowl; they sat on the same seat; they lay on the same couch, on the same spread, on the same blanket, or on the same spread and blanket together. They ate at the wrong time, drank strong drink, wore garlands, perfumes, and unguents. They danced, sang, played music, and performed entertainments. They danced when others danced, sang when others sang, played music when others played, and performed entertainments when others performed entertainments. They danced when others sang, sang when others danced, played music when others danced, performed entertainments when others danced. They danced when others played music, sang when others played music, played music when others sang, performed entertainments when others sang. They danced when others performed entertainments, sang when others performed entertainments, played music when others performed entertainments, and performed entertainments when others played music. They played games such as eight-square chess, ten-square chess, playing at imaginary boards, playing at removing figures, playing at dice, playing at stick games, playing at games with painted sticks, playing at dice, playing at blowing through toy pipes, playing at toy plows, playing at turning somersaults, playing at toy windmills, playing at toy measures, playing at toy carts, playing at toy bows, playing at guessing letters, playing at guessing thoughts, and playing at mimicking deformities. They trained in elephant riding, horse riding, chariot driving, archery, and swordsmanship. They ran in front of elephants, ran in front of horses, ran in front of chariots, and raced alongside them. They shouted, clapped their hands, wrestled, and boxed. They spread their outer robes in the middle of an arena and said to a dancing girl, “Dance here, sister!” They gave her a forehead-gift. They engaged in various kinds of improper conduct.

22. Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu kāsīsu vassaṃvuṭṭho [vassaṃvuttho (sī. syā.)] sāvatthiṃ gacchanto bhagavantaṃ dassanāya yena kīṭāgiri tadavasari.

22.Now at that time, a certain bhikkhu who had spent the rains in Kāsī, while traveling to Sāvatthī to see the Blessed One, arrived at Kīṭāgiri. Then that bhikkhu, having dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe and entered Kīṭāgiri for alms. He was dignified in his going forth and returning, in looking and glancing, in bending and stretching, with downcast eyes and perfect deportment. When the people saw that bhikkhu, they said: “Who is this, feeble as if weak, sluggish as if dull, frowning as if scowling? Who will give alms to one who has approached like this? But our venerable ones, Assaji and Punabbasu, are gentle, amiable, pleasant to converse with, with smiles preceding them, saying ‘Come! Welcome!’, cheerful, with open faces, and speaking first. Indeed, it is to them that alms should be given.”

Then a certain lay follower saw that bhikkhu going for alms in Kīṭāgiri. Having seen him, he approached that bhikkhu, paid homage to him, and said: “Venerable sir, have you received almsfood?” “No, friend, I have not received almsfood.” “Come, venerable sir, let us go to my home.” Then that lay follower took that bhikkhu to his home, fed him, and said: “Where are you going, venerable sir?” “I am going to Sāvatthī, friend, to see the Blessed One.” “Then, venerable sir, in my name, bow your head at the feet of the Blessed One and say: ‘Venerable sir, the dwelling at Kīṭāgiri is corrupted. The bhikkhus named Assaji and Punabbasu, residents of Kīṭāgiri, are shameless, wicked bhikkhus. They engage in such improper conduct as follows: they cultivated flower plants themselves or had them cultivated, watered them themselves or had them watered, picked flowers themselves or had them picked, strung garlands themselves or had them strung, made single-stemmed garlands themselves or had them made, made double-stemmed garlands themselves or had them made, made nosegays themselves or had them made, made decorative bunches themselves or had them made, made chaplets themselves or had them made, made head-wreaths themselves or had them made, made chest-ornaments themselves or had them made.

They ate at the wrong time, drank strong drink, wore garlands, perfumes, and unguents. They danced, sang, played music, and performed entertainments. They danced when others danced, sang when others sang, played music when others played, and performed entertainments when others performed entertainments.

They engaged in various kinds of improper conduct. Those people, venerable sir, who were formerly faithful and devoted have now become faithless and un-devoted. Those former alms routes for the Saṅgha have now been cut off. The virtuous bhikkhus leave, while the wicked bhikkhus stay. It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would send bhikkhus to Kīṭāgiri so that this dwelling at Kīṭāgiri might be restored.’”

“Very well, friend,” the monk replied, and rising from his seat, he set out for Sāvatthī. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sāvatthī, Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, and approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Now it is the Blessed One’s custom to exchange greetings with monks who have arrived. Then the Blessed One said to him: “I hope, monk, you are keeping well, I hope you are comfortable, and I hope you have come without much fatigue. From where have you come, monk?” “I am keeping well, Blessed One; I am comfortable, Blessed One. And I have come without much fatigue, venerable sir. Here, venerable sir, having spent the rains in Kāsi, I was on my way to Sāvatthī to see the Blessed One when I turned aside to Kīṭāgiri. Then, venerable sir, in the morning, having dressed and taken my bowl and robe, I entered Kīṭāgiri for alms. A certain lay follower saw me wandering for alms in Kīṭāgiri. Having seen me, he approached, paid homage to me, and said: ‘Venerable sir, have you obtained alms?’ ‘No, friend, I have not obtained alms.’ ‘Come, venerable sir, let us go to my house.’ Then, venerable sir, that lay follower took me to his house, fed me, and said: ‘Where, venerable sir, are you going?’ ‘I am going to Sāvatthī, friend, to see the Blessed One.’ ‘Then, venerable sir, bow your head at the Blessed One’s feet in my name and say this: “Venerable sir, the dwelling at Kīṭāgiri is corrupt. The monks named Assaji and Punabbasuka residing at Kīṭāgiri are shameless, wicked monks. They engage in such improper conduct: they plant and have others plant flower gardens…they engage in various kinds of improper conduct. Those people, venerable sir, who were formerly faithful and devoted have now become faithless and undevoted. Those former avenues of alms for the Saṅgha have now been cut off. Virtuous monks are leaving, and wicked monks are staying. It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would send monks to Kīṭāgiri so that the dwelling there might be restored.”’ Then, Blessed One, I have come to you.”

23.Then the Blessed One, on this occasion and in connection with this matter, had the Bhikkhu Saṅgha assembled and questioned the bhikkhus: “Is it true, bhikkhus, that the bhikkhus named Assaji and Punabbasu, residing at Kīṭāgiri, are shameless, evil bhikkhus? That they engage in such improper conduct—planting garland-creepers, and so on, and engaging in various other improper kinds of conduct? And that those people who were formerly faithful and devoted have now become faithless and undevoted? And that the former avenues of offerings to the Saṅgha have now been cut off? And that virtuous bhikkhus are disregarded, while evil bhikkhus reside there?” “It is true, Bhante,” they replied. The Blessed One, the Buddha, rebuked them: “It is unsuitable… How, bhikkhus, can these foolish men engage in such improper conduct? They plant garland-creepers and have them planted; they water them and have them watered; they pluck flowers and have them plucked; they string garlands and have them strung; they make single-stem garlands and have them made; they make double-stem garlands and have them made; they make bunches of flowers and have them made; they make whisks and have them made; they make pendants and have them made; they make wreaths and have them made; they make breast ornaments and have them made. They carry single-stem garlands, double-stem garlands, bunches of flowers, whisks, pendants, wreaths, and breast ornaments to women of good families, daughters of good families, maidens of good families, daughters-in-law of good families, and female servants of good families, and have them carried. They eat from the same dish with women of good families, daughters of good families, maidens of good families, daughters-in-law of good families, and female servants of good families; they drink from the same bowl; they sit on the same seat; they lie on the same couch; they lie on the same mattress; they lie on the same coverlet; they lie on the same mattress and coverlet. They eat at unseasonable times; they drink alcohol; they wear garlands, perfumes, and cosmetics. They dance, sing, play musical instruments, and perform theatrical dances. They dance when others are dancing, sing when others are singing, play musical instruments when others are playing, perform theatrical dances when others are performing theatrical dances. They dance when others are singing, sing when others are singing, play musical instruments when others are singing, perform theatrical dances when others are singing. They dance when others are playing music, sing when others are playing music, play musical instruments when others are playing music, perform theatrical dances when others are playing music. They dance when others are performing theatrical dances, sing when others are performing theatrical dances, play musical instruments when others are performing theatrical dances, perform theatrical dances when others are performing theatrical dances. They play eight-square games, ten-square games, games in the air, games on a course, games of chance, games with sticks, games with dice, games with sticks in hand, games with dice, games with bent reeds, release games, games with swings, games with leaf-baskets, games with toy chariots, games with toy bows, letter games, mind-guessing games, and games of mimicry. They train in elephant riding, horse riding, chariot driving, archery, and swordsmanship. They run in front of elephants, run in front of horses, run in front of chariots, and they run after them. They shout, clap their hands, wrestle, and box with their fists. They spread their outer robe in the middle of an arena and say to a dancing girl, ‘Dance here, sister,’ and they make gestures with their foreheads. They engage in various other improper kinds of conduct. This, bhikkhus, is not for the conviction of the unconvicted… Having rebuked them… he gave a Dhamma talk and then addressed Sāriputta and Moggallāna: “Go, Sāriputta, go, Moggallāna, to Kīṭāgiri and carry out the act of expulsion against the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu, expelling them from Kīṭāgiri. They are your co-dwellers.”

‘‘Kathaṃ mayaṃ, bhante, assajipunabbasukānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ kīṭāgirismā pabbājanīyakammaṃ karoma, caṇḍā te bhikkhū pharusā’’ti? ‘‘Tena hi tumhe, sāriputtā, bahukehi bhikkhūhi saddhiṃ gacchathā’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti kho sāriputtamoggallānā bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, kātabbaṃ – paṭhamaṃ assajipunabbasukā bhikkhū codetabbā, codetvā sāretabbā, sāretvā āpattiṃ āropetabbā, āpattiṃ āropetvā byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

“Bhante, how should we perform the act of expulsion against the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu from Kīṭāgiri? Those bhikkhus are fierce and rough.” “Then, Sāriputta, you should go with many bhikkhus.” “Yes, Bhante,” Sāriputta and Moggallāna replied to the Blessed One. And this, bhikkhus, is how it should be done: first, the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu should be charged, then reminded, then charged with an offense. After charging them with an offense, a competent and capable bhikkhu should inform the Saṅgha:

24. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ime assajipunabbasukā bhikkhū kuladūsakā pāpasamācārā. Imesaṃ pāpakā samācārā dissanti ceva suyyanti ca. Kulāni ca imehi duṭṭhāni dissanti ceva suyyanti ca. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho assajipunabbasukānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ kīṭāgirismā pabbājanīyakammaṃ kareyya – na assajipunabbasukehi bhikkhūhi kīṭāgirismiṃ vatthabbanti. Esā ñatti.

24.“Bhante, may the Saṅgha hear me. These bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu are corrupters of families, of evil conduct. Their evil conduct is seen and heard, and the families corrupted by them are seen and heard. If the Saṅgha is ready, the Saṅgha should perform the act of expulsion against the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu from Kīṭāgiri, to the effect that the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu should not dwell in Kīṭāgiri. This is the motion.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ime assajipunabbasukā bhikkhū kuladūsakā pāpasamācārā. Imesaṃ pāpakā samācārā dissanti ceva suyyanti ca. Kulāni ca imehi duṭṭhāni dissanti ceva suyyanti ca.

“Bhante, may the Saṅgha hear me. These bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu are corrupters of families, of evil conduct. Their evil conduct is seen and heard, and the families corrupted by them are seen and heard. The Saṅgha performs the act of expulsion against the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu from Kīṭāgiri, to the effect that the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu should not dwell in Kīṭāgiri. Any venerable one who approves of the Saṅgha’s performance of the act of expulsion against the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu from Kīṭāgiri—to the effect that the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu should not dwell in Kīṭāgiri—should remain silent. Any venerable one who does not approve should speak.

‘‘Dutiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi…pe… tatiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi. Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ime assajipunabbasukā bhikkhū kuladūsakā pāpasamācārā. Imesaṃ pāpakā samācārā dissanti ceva suyyanti ca.

Yassāyasmato khamati assajipunabbasukānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ kīṭāgirismā pabbājanīyassa kammassa karaṇaṃ – na assajipunabbasukehi bhikkhūhi kīṭāgirismiṃ vatthabbanti, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“For the second time I state this matter… For the third time I state this matter. Bhante, may the Saṅgha hear me. These bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu are corrupters of families, of evil conduct. Their evil conduct is seen and heard, and the families corrupted by them are seen and heard.

Any venerable one who does not approve should speak.”

‘‘Kataṃ saṅghena assajipunabbasukānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ kīṭāgirismā pabbājanīyakammaṃ – na assajipunabbasukehi bhikkhūhi kīṭāgirismiṃ vatthabbanti. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

“The Saṅgha has performed the act of expulsion against the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu from Kīṭāgiri, to the effect that the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu should not dwell in Kīṭāgiri. The Saṅgha assents to it, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.”

28.“Monks, a monk against whom an act of banishment has been carried out must conduct himself properly. And what is proper conduct in this case? He must not confer ordination, he must not grant dependence, he must not have a novice attend him, he must not accept appointment as an instructor for nuns, and even if appointed, he must not instruct nuns. He must not commit the offense for which the Sangha carried out the act of banishment, nor another similar to it, nor one even worse. He must not disparage the act, nor must he disparage those who carried it out. He must not prevent a fully established monk’s observance of the Uposatha, nor his Pavāraṇā; he must not make a declaration; he must not make an accusation; he must not create an opportunity (for accusation); he must not accuse; he must not remind; and he must not associate with monks.”

Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

29.Then the Sangha of monks, with Sāriputta and Moggallāna at their head, went to Kīṭāgiri and carried out an act of banishment against the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka, (decreeing) 'The monks Assaji and Punabbasuka must not dwell in Kīṭāgiri.' But those monks, against whom the Sangha had carried out the act of banishment, did not conduct themselves properly, did not humble themselves, did not act for their own good; they did not ask forgiveness of the monks, but instead insulted and reviled them; they gave way to partiality, hostility, delusion, and fear; and they departed and roamed about. Those monks who were of few desires… complained and criticized, saying, “How can the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka, against whom the Sangha has carried out the act of banishment, not conduct themselves properly, not humble themselves, not act for their own good; not ask forgiveness of the monks, but instead insult and revile them; give way to partiality, hostility, delusion, and fear; and depart and roam about?” Then those monks informed the Blessed One of this matter.

Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā bhikkhū paṭipucchi – ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, assajipunabbasukā bhikkhū saṅghena pabbājanīyakammakatā na sammā vattanti, na lomaṃ pātenti, na netthāraṃ vattanti; na bhikkhū khamāpenti, akkosanti, paribhāsanti; chandagāmitā dosagāmitā mohagāmitā bhayagāmitā pāpenti; pakkamantipi, vibbhamantipī’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā – ‘‘ananucchavikaṃ …pe… kathañhi nāma te, bhikkhave, moghapurisā saṅghena pabbājanīyakammakatā na sammā vattissanti, na lomaṃ pātessanti, na netthāraṃ vattissanti; na bhikkhū khamāpessanti, akkosissanti, paribhāsissanti; chandagāmitā dosagāmitā mohagāmitā bhayagāmitā pāpessanti; pakkamissantipi, vibbhamissantipi.

The Blessed One then, on this occasion, because of this matter, had the Sangha of monks assembled, and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka, against whom the Sangha has carried out the act of banishment, do not conduct themselves properly, do not humble themselves, do not act for their own good; do not ask forgiveness of the monks, but insult and revile them, and give way to partiality, hostility, delusion, and fear; and they depart and wander about?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked them: “It is unsuitable… How indeed, monks, can these foolish men, against whom the Sangha has carried out the act of banishment, not conduct themselves properly, not humble themselves, not act for their own good; not ask forgiveness of the monks, but insult and revile them, and give way to partiality, hostility, delusion, and fear; and depart and wander about? This will not lead to confidence in the unconvinced….” After rebuking them… having given a Dhamma talk, he addressed the monks: “Then, monks, let the Sangha revoke the act of banishment.”

32.And, monks, it should be rescinded in this way. The monk who has been subjected to the banishment act should approach the Sangha, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, pay homage at the feet of the senior monks, sit in a squatting position, raise his joined palms, and say this: 'Venerable sirs, I have been subjected to the banishment act by the Sangha. I am behaving properly, I am letting down my hair, I am conducting myself so as to be drawn out (of the fault). I request the rescinding of the banishment act.' He should request a second time. He should request a third time. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:

33. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā sudhammo macchikāsaṇḍe cittassa gahapatino āvāsiko hoti, navakammiko dhuvabhattiko. Yadā citto gahapati saṅghaṃ vā gaṇaṃ vā puggalaṃ vā nimantetukāmo hoti tadā na āyasmantaṃ sudhammaṃ anapaloketvā saṅghaṃ vā gaṇaṃ vā puggalaṃ vā nimanteti.

33.At that time, Venerable Sudhamma was residing in Macchikāsaṇḍa, dwelling in dependence on the householder Citta, performing new construction work and receiving regular meals. Whenever the householder Citta wished to invite the Saṅgha, a group, or an individual, he would not invite the Saṅgha, a group, or an individual without first consulting Venerable Sudhamma.

Tena kho pana samayena sambahulā therā bhikkhū, āyasmā ca sāriputto, āyasmā ca mahāmoggallāno, āyasmā ca mahākaccāno, āyasmā ca mahākoṭṭhiko, āyasmā ca mahākappino, āyasmā ca mahācundo, āyasmā ca anuruddho, āyasmā ca revato, āyasmā ca upāli, āyasmā ca ānando, āyasmā ca rāhulo, kāsīsu cārikaṃ caramānā yena macchikāsaṇḍo tadavasaruṃ.

At that time, a number of senior monks—Venerable Sāriputta, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, Venerable Mahākaccāna, Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita, Venerable Mahākappina, Venerable Mahācunda, Venerable Anuruddha, Venerable Revata, Venerable Upāli, Venerable Ānanda, and Venerable Rāhula—wandering on tour in the Kāsi country, arrived at Macchikāsaṇḍa.

Assosi kho citto gahapati therā kira bhikkhū macchikāsaṇḍaṃ anuppattāti. Atha kho citto gahapati yena therā bhikkhū tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā there bhikkhū abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho cittaṃ gahapatiṃ āyasmā sāriputto dhammiyā kathāya sandassesi samādapesi samuttejesi sampahaṃsesi.

Citta the householder heard that elder monks had arrived at Macchikāsaṇḍa. Then Citta the householder approached the elder monks, and after paying homage to them, sat down to one side. As he sat to one side, Venerable Sāriputta instructed, roused, inspired, and gladdened Citta the householder with a Dhamma talk.

Then the householder Citta, having been shown, roused, inspired, and gladdened by Venerable Sāriputta with a Dhamma talk, said this to the elder monks: "Venerable sirs, may the elders consent to a meal from me tomorrow for newly arrived monks." The elder monks consented by remaining silent.

Atha kho citto gahapati ‘kiṃ me karissati ayyo sudhammo adhivāsento vā anadhivāsento vā’ti āyasmantaṃ sudhammaṃ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṃ katvā pakkāmi.

Then the householder Citta, understanding the elder monks' acceptance, rose from his seat, paid homage to the elder monks, circumambulated them, and approached the Venerable Sudhamma. Having approached, he paid homage to the Venerable Sudhamma and stood to one side. Standing to one side, the householder Citta said to the Venerable Sudhamma: "Venerable Sir, may the Venerable Sudhamma accept my invitation for tomorrow's meal together with the elder monks." Then the Venerable Sudhamma thought: "Previously, this householder Citta, whenever he wished to invite the Saṅgha, a group, or an individual, would not invite the Saṅgha, a group, or an individual without consulting me. But now he invites the elder monks without consulting me. This householder Citta is surely displeased, without regard for, and estranged from me." He said to the householder Citta: "Enough, householder, I will not accept." A second time... a third time the householder Citta said to the Venerable Sudhamma: "Venerable Sir, may the Venerable Sudhamma accept my invitation for tomorrow's meal together with the elder monks." "Enough, householder, I will not accept." Then the householder Citta thought: "What can the Venerable Sudhamma do to me, whether he accepts or does not accept?" He paid homage to the Venerable Sudhamma, circumambulated him, and departed.

34.Then, after the night had passed, the householder Citta prepared excellent hard and soft food for the elder monks. Then Venerable Sudhamma thought, "Why don't I see what the householder Citta has prepared for the elder monks?" So in the morning, having dressed, taken his bowl and robe, he went to the dwelling of the householder Citta. Having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat. Then the householder Citta approached Venerable Sudhamma, paid respects to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, Venerable Sudhamma said to him: "Householder, you have prepared a great deal of hard and soft food here, but there is one thing missing—sesame cakes." "Venerable sir, though there is much treasure in the Buddha's words, Venerable Sudhamma speaks only of sesame cakes. Once, sir, merchants from the Southern region went to the Eastern lands for trade. They brought back a hen. That hen, sir, engaged in intercourse with a crow and produced a chick. When that chick, sir, wanted to make a crow's sound, it would sound 'crow-hen'; when it wanted to make a hen's sound, it would sound 'hen-crow.' In the same way, sir, though there is much treasure in the Buddha's words, Venerable Sudhamma speaks only of sesame cakes." "Householder, you insult me! You revile me! This is your dwelling—I will leave!" "I do not insult or revile Venerable Sudhamma. Let Venerable Sudhamma stay in Macchikāsaṇḍa. The mango grove is delightful. I will attend to Venerable Sudhamma’s needs—robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicine." A second time... a third time, Venerable Sudhamma said to the householder Citta: "Householder, you insult me! You revile me! This is your dwelling—I will leave!" "Where will Venerable Sudhamma go, sir?" "I will go to Sāvatthī, householder, to see the Blessed One." "Then, sir, please report to the Blessed One both what you have said and what I have said. It would not be a surprise, sir, if Venerable Sudhamma were to return to Macchikāsaṇḍa."

35. Atha kho āyasmā sudhammo senāsanaṃ saṃsāmetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena sāvatthi tena pakkāmi. Anupubbena yena sāvatthi jetavanaṃ anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāmo yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā sudhammo yañca attanā bhaṇitaṃ yañca cittena gahapatinā bhaṇitaṃ taṃ sabbaṃ bhagavato ārocesi.

35.Then Venerable Sudhamma, having put his dwelling in order and taking his bowl and robe, set out for Savatthi. In due course, he arrived at Savatthi, at Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery, and approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, Venerable Sudhamma reported to the Blessed One all that he had said and all that the householder had said.

Vigarahi buddho bhagavā – ‘‘ananucchavikaṃ, moghapurisa, ananulomikaṃ appatirūpaṃ assāmaṇakaṃ akappiyaṃ akaraṇīyaṃ.

The Blessed One rebuked him: "Foolish man, this is unseemly, unsuitable, inappropriate, unworthy of an ascetic, unbecoming, and not to be done. How could you, foolish man, humiliate and disparage the householder Citta, who is faithful, devoted, a donor, a benefactor, and a regular attendant of the Saṅgha, in a base manner? This, foolish man, does not conduce to the confidence of the unconfident…" Having rebuked him… he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: "Well then, monks, let the Saṅgha perform the act of reconciliation towards the monk Sudhamma—'Citta the householder must be asked to forgive you.' And this, monks, is how it should be done: First, the monk Sudhamma should be charged, then reminded, then the offense should be imposed, and then a competent monk should inform the Saṅgha:

36. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ sudhammo bhikkhu cittaṃ gahapatiṃ saddhaṃ pasannaṃ dāyakaṃ kārakaṃ saṅghupaṭṭhākaṃ hīnena khuṃseti, hīnena vambheti. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho sudhammassa bhikkhuno paṭisāraṇīyakammaṃ kareyya – citto te gahapati khamāpetabboti. Esā ñatti.

36."Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. This monk Sudhamma insults and disparages the householder Citta—who is faithful, devoted, a donor, a supporter, and a regular attendant of the Saṅgha—in a base manner. If the Saṅgha is ready, let the Saṅgha perform the act of bringing Sudhamma bhikkhu to reconciliation—[with the instruction] 'You must ask forgiveness of the householder Citta.' This is the motion."

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ sudhammo bhikkhu cittaṃ gahapatiṃ saddhaṃ pasannaṃ dāyakaṃ kārakaṃ saṅghupaṭṭhākaṃ hīnena khuṃseti, hīnena vambheti. Saṅgho sudhammassa bhikkhuno paṭisāraṇīyakammaṃ karoti – citto te gahapati khamāpetabboti. Yassāyasmato khamati sudhammassa bhikkhuno paṭisāraṇīyassa kammassa karaṇaṃ – citto te gahapati khamāpetabboti, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

"Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. This monk Sudhamma insults and disparages Citta the householder—who is faithful, devoted, a donor, a benefactor, and an attendant of the Saṅgha—in a base manner. The Saṅgha performs the act of reconciliation for the monk Sudhamma—'You must ask forgiveness of Citta the householder.' If it is agreeable to the venerable ones that the act of reconciliation be performed for the monk Sudhamma—'You must ask forgiveness of Citta the householder'—let them remain silent. If it is not agreeable, let them speak."

‘‘Dutiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi…pe… tatiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi – suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ sudhammo bhikkhu cittaṃ gahapatiṃ saddhaṃ pasannaṃ dāyakaṃ kārakaṃ saṅghupaṭṭhākaṃ hīnena khuṃseti, hīnena vambheti.

"For the second time, I speak on this matter… For the third time, I speak on this matter: Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. This monk Sudhamma insults and disparages the householder Citta—who is faithful, devoted, a donor, a benefactor, and a regular attendant of the Saṅgha—in a base manner. The Saṅgha performs the act of reconciliation for the monk Sudhamma—‘You must seek forgiveness from the householder Citta.’ If it is agreeable to the venerable ones that the act of reconciliation be performed for the monk Sudhamma—‘You must seek forgiveness from the householder Citta’—then remain silent. If it does not please you, speak up."

‘‘Kataṃ saṅghena sudhammassa bhikkhuno paṭisāraṇīyakammaṃ – citto te gahapati khamāpetabboti. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

"The Saṅgha has performed the act of reconciliation regarding the monk Sudhamma—'Citta the householder must be asked for forgiveness.' It is agreeable to the Saṅgha, therefore they are silent. Thus I hold it."

40.Monks, a monk against whom an act of reconciliation has been performed must conduct himself properly. And what is proper conduct in this case? He should not confer ordination, he should not grant dependence, he should not have a novice wait upon him, he should not solicit agreement to be appointed to instruct nuns, and even if appointed, he should not instruct nuns. He should not commit the offense for which the Sangha performed the act of reconciliation, nor another like it, nor one still more serious. He should not disparage the act, nor should he disparage those who performed it. He should not prevent a qualified monk from observing the Uposatha, nor from observing the Pavāraṇā, nor should he make a verbal challenge, nor should he initiate a formal charge, nor should he request a hearing, nor should he accuse, nor should he remind, nor should he conspire with monks.

Having been subjected to the act of prompting repentance by the Sangha, he went to Macchikāsaṇḍa but, being humiliated, was unable to ask the householder Citta for forgiveness. He returned again to Sāvatthī. The monks asked him, "Friend Sudhamma, have you asked the householder Citta for forgiveness?" "Friends, after going to Macchikāsaṇḍa, I was humiliated and unable to ask the householder Citta for forgiveness." The monks informed the Blessed One of the matter… "Well then, monks, let the Sangha appoint a deputy for the monk Sudhamma to ask the householder Citta for forgiveness. And this is how it should be done: First, a monk should be requested. Having requested him, a competent and able monk should inform the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ sudhammassa bhikkhuno anudūtaṃ dadeyya cittaṃ gahapatiṃ khamāpetuṃ. Esā ñatti.

"Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. If the Sangha is ready, the Sangha may give such-and-such a monk as a deputy for the monk Sudhamma to ask the householder Citta for forgiveness. This is the motion."

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ sudhammassa bhikkhuno anudūtaṃ deti cittaṃ gahapatiṃ khamāpetuṃ. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa bhikkhuno sudhammassa bhikkhuno anudūtassa dānaṃ cittaṃ gahapatiṃ khamāpetuṃ, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

"Venerable Sirs, let the Saṅgha hear me. The Saṅgha gives such-and-such a bhikkhu as a deputy to the bhikkhu Sudhamma to ask the householder Citta for forgiveness. If it is acceptable to the venerable ones that such-and-such a bhikkhu be given as a deputy to the bhikkhu Sudhamma to ask the householder Citta for forgiveness, let them remain silent; if it is not acceptable, let them speak."

‘‘Dinno saṅghena itthannāmo bhikkhu sudhammassa bhikkhuno anudūto cittaṃ gahapatiṃ khamāpetuṃ. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

"The Sangha has appointed the monk named so-and-so as a deputy for the monk Sudhamma to ask the householder Citta for forgiveness. It is acceptable to the Sangha, therefore they are silent. Thus I hold it."

42. ‘‘Tena, bhikkhave, sudhammena bhikkhunā anudūtena bhikkhunā saddhiṃ macchikāsaṇḍaṃ gantvā citto gahapati khamāpetabbo – ‘khama, gahapati, pasādemi ta’nti. Evañce vuccamāno khamati, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce khamati, anudūtena bhikkhunā vattabbo – ‘khama, gahapati, imassa bhikkhuno, pasādeti ta’nti. Evañce vuccamāno khamati, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce khamati, anudūtena bhikkhunā vattabbo – ‘khama, gahapati, imassa bhikkhuno, ahaṃ taṃ pasādemī’ti. Evañce vuccamāno khamati, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce khamati, anudūtena bhikkhunā vattabbo – ‘khama, gahapati, imassa bhikkhuno, saṅghassa vacanenā’ti. Evañce vuccamāno khamati, iccetaṃ kusalaṃ. No ce khamati, anudūtena bhikkhunā sudhammo bhikkhu [sudhammaṃ bhikkhuṃ… sā āpatti desāpetabbāti (sī. syā.)] cittassa gahapatino dassanūpacāraṃ avijahāpetvā savanūpacāraṃ avijahāpetvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ kārāpetvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīdāpetvā añjaliṃ paggaṇhāpetvā taṃ āpattiṃ desāpetabbo’’ti [sudhammaṃ bhikkhuṃ… sā āpatti desāpetabbāti (sī. syā.)].

42."Then, monks, the monk Sudhamma, accompanied by the deputy monk, should go to Macchikāsaṇḍa and ask the householder Citta for forgiveness: 'Forgive me, householder, I seek your appeasement.' If, being spoken to thus, he forgives, that is skillful. If he does not forgive, the deputy monk should say: 'Forgive, householder, this monk, he seeks your appeasement.' If, being spoken to thus, he forgives, that is skillful. If he does not forgive, the deputy monk should say: 'Forgive, householder, this monk; I seek your appeasement on his behalf.' If, being spoken to thus, he forgives, that is skillful. If he does not forgive, the deputy monk should say: 'Forgive, householder, this monk, by the word of the Sangha.' If, being spoken to thus, he forgives, that is skillful. If he does not forgive, the deputy monk should have the monk Sudhamma, without relinquishing the householder Citta's sight or hearing, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, sit on his heels, raise his hands in añjali, and confess the offense."

Atha kho āyasmā sudhammo anudūtena bhikkhunā saddhiṃ macchikāsaṇḍaṃ gantvā cittaṃ gahapatiṃ khamāpesi. So sammā vattati, lomaṃ pāteti, netthāraṃ vattati, bhikkhū upasaṅkamitvā evaṃ vadeti – ‘‘ahaṃ, āvuso, saṅghena paṭisāraṇīyakammakato sammā vattāmi, lomaṃ pātemi, netthāraṃ vattāmi. Kathaṃ nu kho mayā paṭipajjitabba’’nti? Bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘tena hi, bhikkhave, saṅgho sudhammassa bhikkhuno paṭisāraṇīyakammaṃ paṭippassambhetu.

Then the Venerable Sudhamma, together with the deputy monk, went to Macchikāsaṇḍa and sought forgiveness from the householder Citta. He behaved properly, showed remorse, and behaved irreproachably. He approached the monks and said: “Friends, having been subjected to a procedure requiring reconciliation by the Sangha, I behave properly, show remorse, and behave irreproachably. How should I proceed?” The monks reported this matter to the Blessed One… “Well then, monks, let the Sangha rescind the procedure requiring reconciliation for the monk Sudhamma.

46.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Park. Now at that time Venerable Channa had committed an offense but did not wish to see the offense. The monks who were modest … murmured, complained, and criticized him: “How can Venerable Channa, having committed an offense, not wish to see the offense?” Then those monks informed the Blessed One about this matter.

Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā bhikkhū paṭipucchi – ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, channo bhikkhu āpattiṃ āpajjitvā na icchati āpattiṃ passitu’’nti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti.

Then the Blessed One, on this occasion and in this connection, had the Sangha of monks assembled and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the monk Channa has committed an offense and does not wish to see the offense?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One rebuked him: “This is not fitting… … How can this foolish man, monks, commit an offense and not wish to see the offense? This will not lead to confidence in the unconvinced… … Having rebuked him … he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Well then, monks, let the Sangha carry out the act of suspension against the monk Channa for not seeing the offense—non-intercourse with the Sangha. And, monks, it should be done like this. First, the monk Channa should be questioned. Having been questioned, he should be reminded. Having been reminded, the offense should be imposed upon him. Having imposed the offense, a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:

47. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ channo bhikkhu āpattiṃ āpajjitvā na icchati āpattiṃ passituṃ. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho channassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā adassane, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ kareyya – asambhogaṃ saṅghena. Esā ñatti.

Furthermore, Bhikkhus, a suspension act for not admitting an offense, when endowed with three factors, is a lawful act, a disciplinary act, and well-appeased. (These are:) It is done concerning an offense; it is done concerning an offense requiring confession; it is done concerning an unconfessed offense. ... It is done after accusation; it is done after reminding; it is done after charging with an offense. ... It is done in the presence, lawfully, and by a united Sangha. ... It is done by questioning, lawfully, and by a united Sangha. ... It is done by admission, lawfully, and by a united Sangha. ... It is done concerning an offense, lawfully, and by a united Sangha. ...

52.Then the Sangha performed the act of suspension against the bhikkhu Channa for not acknowledging his offense—he was to have no association with the Sangha. Having been subjected to the act of suspension by the Sangha for not acknowledging his offense, he left that monastery and went to another. There the bhikkhus neither greeted him, nor rose up for him, nor offered a gesture of reverence, nor proper service; they did not honor, respect, esteem, or venerate him. Being thus dishonored, disrespected, unesteemed, and unvenerated by the bhikkhus, and treated with disrespect, he left that monastery too and went to another. There too the bhikkhus neither greeted him, nor rose up for him, nor offered a gesture of reverence, nor proper service; they did not honor, respect, esteem, or venerate him. Being thus dishonored, disrespected, unesteemed, and unvenerated by the bhikkhus, and treated with disrespect, he left that monastery too and went to another. There too the bhikkhus neither greeted him, nor rose up for him, nor offered a gesture of reverence, nor proper service; they did not honor, respect, esteem, or venerate him. Being thus dishonored, disrespected, unesteemed, and unvenerated by the bhikkhus, and treated with disrespect, he eventually returned to Kosambi. He behaved properly, made himself amenable, conducted himself correctly, and approached the bhikkhus, saying: "Venerables, I have been subjected to the act of suspension by the Sangha for not acknowledging my offense. I now behave properly, make myself amenable, and conduct myself correctly. What should I do next?" The bhikkhus reported this matter to the Blessed One… "Well then, bhikkhus, let the Sangha rescind the act of suspension against the bhikkhu Channa for not acknowledging his offense."

He does not approve of a monk in good standing's offering of a bed, foot-washing water, a footstool, a foot-wiping cloth, or the receiving of bowl and robe, nor back-rubbing in the bath—a monk endowed with these five qualities should have the act of suspension for not acknowledging an offense rescinded.

‘‘Aparehipi, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā adassane, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ paṭippassambhetabbaṃ.

Furthermore, monks, a monk endowed with another five qualities should have the act of suspension for not acknowledging an offense rescinded. He does not denounce a monk in good standing for failure in virtue, failure in conduct, failure in view, failure in livelihood, nor does he cause division among the monks—a monk endowed with these five qualities should have the act of suspension for not acknowledging an offense rescinded.

‘‘Aparehipi, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā adassane, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ paṭippassambhetabbaṃ.

He does not wear the emblem of a householder, nor the emblem of a sectarian, he does not associate with sectarians, he associates with monks, and he trains in the training of the monks—a monk endowed with these five qualities should have the act of suspension for not acknowledging an offense rescinded.

‘‘Aparehipi, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā adassane, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ paṭippassambhetabbaṃ.

Furthermore, monks, a monk endowed with another five qualities should have the act of suspension for not acknowledging an offense rescinded. He does not dwell in the same dwelling with a monk in good standing, he does not dwell in the same open space with a monk in good standing, he does not dwell in the same dwelling or open space with a monk in good standing, he rises from his seat upon seeing a monk in good standing, he does not approach a monk in good standing inside or outside—a monk endowed with these five qualities should have the act of suspension for not acknowledging an offense rescinded.

‘‘Aṭṭhahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā adassane, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ paṭippassambhetabbaṃ.

Monks, a monk endowed with eight qualities should have the act of suspension for not acknowledging an offense rescinded. He does not prevent a monk in good standing from observing the Uposatha, he does not prevent him from performing the Pavāraṇā, he does not make him subject to formal censure, he does not initiate an accusation, he does not request an opportunity, he does not rebuke, he does not remind, and he does not associate him with other monks—a monk endowed with these eight qualities should have the act of suspension for not acknowledging an offense rescinded.

55.And, monks, this is how it should be rescinded. That monk Channa, having approached the Sangha, should arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, pay homage at the feet of the senior monks, sit in a squatting position, raise his joined hands, and say this: ‘Venerable sirs, I have been rightfully subjected by the Sangha to the act of suspension for not acknowledging an offense. I am behaving properly, I am shaving my hair, I am seeking rehabilitation, and I request the rescinding of the act of suspension for not acknowledging the offense.’ He should be asked a second time. He should be asked a third time. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ channo bhikkhu saṅghena, āpattiyā adassane, ukkhepanīyakammakato sammā vattati, lomaṃ pāteti, netthāraṃ vattati, āpattiyā adassane ukkhepanīyassa kammassa paṭippassaddhiṃ yācati. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho channassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā adassane, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ paṭippassambheyya. Esā ñatti.

Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. This monk Channa, having been subjected by the Sangha to the act of suspension for not acknowledging an offense, is conducting himself properly: he is shaving his hair, he is seeking rehabilitation, and he requests the rescinding of the act of suspension for not acknowledging an offense. If it is agreeable to the Sangha, the Sangha may rescind the act of suspension for the monk Channa for not acknowledging an offense. This is the motion.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ channo bhikkhu saṅghena, āpattiyā adassane, ukkhepanīyakammakato sammā vattati, lomaṃ pāteti, netthāraṃ vattati, āpattiyā adassane, ukkhepanīyassa kammassa paṭippassaddhiṃ yācati.

Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. This monk Channa, having been subjected by the Sangha to the act of suspension for not acknowledging an offense, is conducting himself properly: he is shaving his hair, he is seeking rehabilitation, and he requests the rescinding of the act of suspension for not acknowledging an offense. The Sangha rescinds the act of suspension for the monk Channa for not acknowledging an offense. Whichever venerable one approves of the rescinding of the act of suspension for the monk Channa for not acknowledging an offense, let him be silent; whichever does not approve, let him speak.

‘‘Dutiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi…pe… tatiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi – suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho.

I speak on this matter a second time... I speak on this matter a third time: Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. This monk Channa, having been subjected by the Sangha to the act of suspension for not acknowledging an offense, is conducting himself properly: he is shaving his hair, he is seeking rehabilitation, and he requests the rescinding of the act of suspension for not acknowledging an offense. The Sangha rescinds the act of suspension for the monk Channa for not acknowledging an offense. Whichever venerable one approves of the rescinding of the act of suspension for the monk Channa for not acknowledging an offense, let him be silent; whichever does not approve, let him speak.

The act of suspension for the monk Channa for not acknowledging an offense has been rescinded by the Sangha. The Sangha approves, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.

56. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā kosambiyaṃ viharati ghositārāme. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā channo āpattiṃ āpajjitvā na icchati āpattiṃ paṭikātuṃ. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma āyasmā channo āpattiṃ āpajjitvā na icchissati āpattiṃ paṭikātu’’nti? Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

56.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi in Ghosita's Park. Now at that time Venerable Channa had committed an offense but was unwilling to make amends for it. Those monks who were modest… grumbled, criticized, and spread it about: “How could Venerable Channa commit an offense and then be unwilling to make amends for it?” Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One.

Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā bhikkhū paṭipucchi – ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, channo bhikkhu āpattiṃ āpajjitvā na icchati āpattiṃ paṭikātu’’nti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā – ‘‘ananucchavikaṃ…pe… kathañhi nāma so, bhikkhave, moghapuriso āpattiṃ āpajjitvā na icchissati āpattiṃ paṭikātuṃ. Netaṃ, bhikkhave, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – tena hi, bhikkhave, saṅgho channassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ karotu – asambhogaṃ saṅghena.

Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, because of this matter, having convened the Sangha of monks, questioned the monks: "Is it true, monks, that the monk Channa, having committed an offense, does not wish to make amends for the offense?" "It is true, Blessed One." The Blessed One rebuked him: "It is unsuitable... How could that foolish man, monks, having committed an offense, not wish to make amends for the offense? This will not lead to confidence in the unconvinced... Having rebuked him... having given a Dhamma talk, he addressed the monks: "Therefore, monks, let the Sangha carry out the act of suspension against the monk Channa for not making amends for his offense—non-association with the Sangha. And this, monks, is how it should be done: First, the monk Channa should be questioned, then reminded, then the offense should be brought to his attention, and having brought the offense to his attention, a monk who is articulate and competent should inform the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ channo bhikkhu āpattiṃ āpajjitvā na icchati āpattiṃ paṭikātuṃ. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho channassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ kareyya – asambhogaṃ saṅghena. Esā ñatti.

"Listen to me, venerable Sangha. This monk Channa, having committed an offense, does not wish to make amends for the offense. If the Sangha is ready, let the Sangha carry out the act of suspension against the monk Channa for not making amends for his offense—non-association with the Sangha. This is the motion."

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ channo bhikkhu āpattiṃ āpajjitvā na icchati āpattiṃ paṭikātuṃ. Saṅgho channassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ karoti – asambhogaṃ saṅghena.

"Listen to me, venerable Sangha. This monk Channa, having committed an offense, does not wish to make amends for the offense. The Sangha performs the act of suspension against the monk Channa for not making amends for his offense—non-association with the Sangha. If this is agreeable to the venerable ones, that the Sangha should perform the act of suspension against the monk Channa for not making amends for his offense—non-association with the Sangha, let them remain silent. If anyone does not approve, let him speak."

‘‘Dutiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi…pe… tatiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi – suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ channo bhikkhu āpattiṃ āpajjitvā na icchati āpattiṃ paṭikātuṃ.

"I speak on this matter a second time... I speak on this matter a third time—venerable Sangha, listen to me. This monk Channa, having committed an offense, does not wish to make amends for the offense. The Sangha performs the act of suspension against the monk Channa for not making amends for his offense—non-association with the Sangha. If this act of suspension against the monk Channa for not making amends for his offense—non-association with the Sangha—is agreeable to any venerable one, let him remain silent. If it is not agreeable to anyone, let him speak."

‘‘Kataṃ saṅghena channassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ – asambhogaṃ saṅghena. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmīti.

"The Sangha has performed the act of suspension against the monk Channa for his failure to make amends for his offense—excluding him from association with the Sangha. The Sangha approves; therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it."

‘‘Āvāsaparamparañca, bhikkhave, saṃsatha – ‘channo bhikkhu, saṅghena āpattiyā [channo bhikkhu āpattiyā (sī. ka.)] appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammakato – asambhogaṃ saṅghenā’ti.

"Furthermore, monks, you should announce this from residence to residence: ‘The monk Channa, because he has not made amends for his offense, has been subjected to an act of suspension by the Sangha—excluding him from association with the Sangha.’"

59.Monks, if the Saṅgha wishes, it may carry out an act of suspension for an unrectified offense against a bhikkhu endowed with three factors. He is a maker of quarrels, a maker of disputes, a maker of arguments, a maker of noise, and a maker of legal issues in the Saṅgha; he is foolish, incompetent, frequently committing offenses, and does not offer a way out; he lives in improper association with householders. If the Saṅgha wishes, it may carry out an act of suspension for an unrectified offense against a bhikkhu endowed with these three factors.

‘‘Aparehipi, bhikkhave, tīhaṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno, ākaṅkhamāno saṅgho, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ kareyya.

Further, monks, if the Saṅgha wishes, it may carry out an act of suspension for an unrectified offense against a bhikkhu endowed with three factors. He is fallen away from higher virtue, fallen away from conduct, and fallen away from view. If the Saṅgha wishes, it may carry out an act of suspension for an unrectified offense against a bhikkhu endowed with these three factors.

Further, monks, if the Saṅgha wishes, it may carry out an act of suspension for an unrectified offense against a bhikkhu endowed with three factors. He speaks disparagingly of the Buddha, speaks disparagingly of the Dhamma, and speaks disparagingly of the Saṅgha. If the Saṅgha wishes, it may carry out an act of suspension for an unrectified offense against a bhikkhu endowed with these three factors.

One is a maker of quarrels, a maker of disputes, a maker of arguments, a maker of noise, and a maker of legal issues in the Saṅgha; one is foolish, incompetent, frequently committing offenses, and does not offer a way out; one lives in improper association with householders. If the Saṅgha wishes, it may carry out an act of suspension for an unrectified offense against these three bhikkhus.

‘‘Aparesampi, bhikkhave, tiṇṇaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ, ākaṅkhamāno saṅgho, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ kareyya. Eko adhisīle sīlavipanno hoti, eko ajjhācāre ācāravipanno hoti, eko atidiṭṭhiyā diṭṭhivipanno hoti – imesaṃ kho, bhikkhave, tiṇṇaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ, ākaṅkhamāno saṅgho, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ kareyya.

Further, monks, if the Saṅgha wishes, it may carry out an act of suspension for an unrectified offense against three bhikkhus. One is fallen away from higher virtue, one is fallen away from conduct, and one is fallen away from view. If the Saṅgha wishes, it may carry out an act of suspension for an unrectified offense against these three bhikkhus.

‘‘Aparesampi, bhikkhave, tiṇṇaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ, ākaṅkhamāno saṅgho, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ kareyya. Eko buddhassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati, eko dhammassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati, eko saṅghassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati – imesaṃ kho, bhikkhave, tiṇṇaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ, ākaṅkhamāno saṅgho, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ kareyya.

Further, monks, if the Saṅgha wishes, it may carry out an act of suspension for an unrectified offense against three bhikkhus. One speaks disparagingly of the Buddha, one speaks disparagingly of the Dhamma, and one speaks disparagingly of the Saṅgha. If the Saṅgha wishes, it may carry out an act of suspension for an unrectified offense against these three bhikkhus.

60.A monk on whom the Sangha has imposed the act of suspension for not making amends for an offense, bhikkhus, should behave properly. Herein is the proper conduct: He should not give ordination, he should not give dependence, he should not have a novice attend on him, he should not accept appointment as an advisor of nuns, and even if appointed, he should not advise nuns. He should not commit the offense for which the Sangha imposed the act of suspension for not making amends, nor one similar, nor one worse. He should not criticize the act, nor those who performed it. He should not accept from a regular monk salutation, rising, the gesture of joined palms, proper duties, the offering of a seat, the offering of a bed, water for washing the feet, a footstool, a foot scraper, the receiving of his bowl and robe, or back-rubbing during a bath. He should not denounce a regular monk for failure in virtue, failure in conduct, failure in view, or failure in livelihood. He should not cause division among the monks. He should not carry a layman’s banner, nor a sectarian banner, nor associate with sectarians; he should associate with monks and train in the training of the monks. He should not dwell with a regular monk under the same roof in a dwelling, nor in a non-dwelling, nor in a dwelling or non-dwelling. Upon seeing a regular monk, he should rise from his seat. A regular monk should not be disparaged by him, whether inside or outside. He should not prevent a regular monk from observing the Uposatha, nor from performing the Pavāraṇā, nor should he give instructions, nor lay down a censure, nor demand an admission of the offense, nor accuse, nor remind, nor should he associate with the monks.

61. Atha kho saṅgho channassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ akāsi – asambhogaṃ saṅghena. So saṅghena, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammakato tamhā āvāsā aññaṃ āvāsaṃ agamāsi.

So bhikkhūhi asakkariyamāno agarukariyamāno amāniyamāno apūjiyamāno asakkārapakato tamhāpi āvāsā aññaṃ āvāsaṃ agamāsi. Tatthapi bhikkhū neva abhivādesuṃ, na paccuṭṭhesuṃ, na añjalikammaṃ na sāmīcikammaṃ akaṃsu, na sakkariṃsu, na garuṃ kariṃsu, na mānesuṃ, na pūjesuṃ.

So sammā vattati, lomaṃ pāteti, netthāraṃ vattati, bhikkhū upasaṅkamitvā evaṃ vadeti – ‘‘ahaṃ, āvuso, saṅghena, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammakato sammā vattāmi, lomaṃ pātemi, netthāraṃ vattāmi.

61.Then the Sangha imposed the act of suspension on the monk Channa for not making amends for his offense—namely, non-association with the Sangha. Having been suspended by the Sangha for not making amends for his offense, he left that monastery and went to another monastery. There the monks neither greeted him, nor rose for him, nor offered the gesture of joined palms, nor performed proper duties, nor honored him, nor respected him, nor esteemed him, nor venerated him. Not being honored, respected, esteemed, or venerated by the monks, being deprived of respect, he left that monastery too and went to another monastery. There also the monks neither greeted him, nor rose for him, nor offered the gesture of joined palms, nor performed proper duties, nor honored him, nor respected him, nor esteemed him, nor venerated him. Not being honored, respected, esteemed, or venerated by the monks, being deprived of respect, he left that monastery too and went to another monastery. There also the monks neither greeted him, nor rose for him, nor offered the gesture of joined palms, nor performed proper duties, nor honored him, nor respected him, nor esteemed him, nor venerated him. Not being honored, respected, esteemed, or venerated by the monks, being deprived of respect, he returned once more to Kosambi. He behaved properly, shaved his hair, sought rehabilitation, and approaching the monks, he said: "Friends, having been suspended by the Sangha for not making amends for my offense, I now behave properly, shave my hair, and seek rehabilitation. What should I do now?" The monks reported this matter to the Blessed One… "Well then, bhikkhus, let the Sangha rescind the act of suspension on the monk Channa for not making amends for his offense."

The Forty-Third: On Not Revoking

62. ‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ nappaṭippassambhetabbaṃ. Upasampādeti, nissayaṃ deti, sāmaṇeraṃ upaṭṭhāpeti, bhikkhunovādakasammutiṃ sādiyati, sammatopi bhikkhuniyo ovadati – imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ nappaṭippassambhetabbaṃ.

62.Monks, a monk endowed with five factors—when there is no making amends for an offense—should not have the act of suspension revoked. He confers ordination, he gives dependence, he has a novice attend on him, he assents to the appointment as an instructor of nuns, and even though appointed, he instructs nuns. A monk endowed with these five factors—when there is no making amends for an offense—should not have the act of suspension revoked.

[pari. 420] ‘‘Aparehipi, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ nappaṭippassambhetabbaṃ. Yāya āpattiyā saṅghena, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ kataṃ hoti taṃ āpattiṃ āpajjati, aññaṃ vā tādisikaṃ, tato vā pāpiṭṭhataraṃ; kammaṃ garahati, kammike garahati…pe… pakatattassa bhikkhuno abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ, añjalikammaṃ, sāmīcikammaṃ, āsanābhihāraṃ sādiyati…pe… pakatattassa bhikkhuno seyyābhihāraṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ, pādakathalikaṃ, pattacīvarappaṭiggahaṇaṃ, nahāne piṭṭhiparikammaṃ sādiyati…pe… pakatattaṃ bhikkhuṃ sīlavipattiyā anuddhaṃseti, ācāravipattiyā anuddhaṃseti, diṭṭhivipattiyā anuddhaṃseti, ājīvavipattiyā anuddhaṃseti, bhikkhuṃ bhikkhūhi bhedeti…pe… gihiddhajaṃ dhāreti, titthiyaddhajaṃ dhāreti, titthiye sevati, bhikkhū na sevati, bhikkhusikkhāya na sikkhati…pe… pakatattena bhikkhunā saddhiṃ ekacchanne āvāse vasati, ekacchanne anāvāse vasati, ekacchanne āvāse vā anāvāse vā vasati, pakatattaṃ bhikkhuṃ disvā āsanā na vuṭṭhāti, pakatattaṃ bhikkhuṃ āsādeti anto vā bahi vā – imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ nappaṭippassambhetabbaṃ.

Furthermore, monks, a monk endowed with five factors—when there is no making amends for an offense—should not have the act of suspension revoked. He commits the offense for which the Sangha imposed the act of suspension when there was no making amends for the offense, or one similar to it, or even worse than it; he disparages the act, he disparages those who performed the act… He approves of bowing down to, standing up for, reverential salutation, proper duties, or the offering of a seat to a regular monk… He approves of the offering of a bed, foot-water, a footstool, a foot-wiping cloth, or receiving a bowl and robe, or having his back rubbed while bathing, from a regular monk… He denounces a regular monk for failure in virtue, failure in conduct, failure in view, or failure in livelihood; he causes division among the monks… He wears the emblem of a householder, the emblem of a sectarian; he associates with sectarians and does not associate with monks; he does not train in the training of the monks… He dwells under the same roof with a regular monk, in the same non-monastic dwelling, or in the same dwelling, whether monastic or non-monastic; when seeing a regular monk, he does not rise from his seat; he harasses a regular monk, whether inside or outside. Monks, a monk endowed with these five factors—when there is no making amends for an offense—should not have the act of suspension revoked.

‘‘Aṭṭhahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ nappaṭippassambhetabbaṃ. Pakatattassa bhikkhuno uposathaṃ ṭhapeti, pavāraṇaṃ ṭhapeti, savacanīyaṃ karoti, anuvādaṃ paṭṭhapeti, okāsaṃ kāreti, codeti, sāreti, bhikkhūhi sampayojeti – imehi kho, bhikkhave, aṭṭhahaṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ nappaṭippassambhetabbaṃ.

Monks, a monk endowed with eight factors—when there is no making amends for an offense—should not have the act of suspension revoked. He obstructs a monk in good standing from observing the Uposatha, he obstructs the Pavāraṇā, he makes himself liable to admonition, he sets up a charge, he causes an opportunity (for accusation), he accuses, he reminds, he causes monks to be involved. Monks, a monk endowed with these eight factors—when there is no making amends for an offense—should not have the act of suspension revoked.

The Forty-three on What Should Be Rescinded.

63. ‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ paṭippassambhetabbaṃ. Na upasampādeti, na nissayaṃ deti, na sāmaṇeraṃ upaṭṭhāpeti, na bhikkhunovādakasammutiṃ sādiyati, sammatopi bhikkhuniyo na ovadati – imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ paṭippassambhetabbaṃ.

63.Bhikkhus, the act of suspension against a bhikkhu endowed with five factors, for not making amends for an offense, should be rescinded. He does not give higher ordination; he does not give dependence; he does not have a novice attend upon him; he does not accept the appointment to advise bhikkhunīs, nor, even if appointed, does he advise bhikkhunīs. Bhikkhus, the act of suspension against a bhikkhu endowed with these five factors, for not making amends for an offense, should be rescinded.

‘‘Aparehipi, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ paṭippassambhetabbaṃ. Yāya āpattiyā saṅghena, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ kataṃ hoti taṃ āpattiṃ na āpajjati, aññaṃ vā tādisikaṃ, tato vā pāpiṭṭhataraṃ; kammaṃ na garahati, kammike na garahati…pe… na pakatattassa bhikkhuno abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ, añjalikammaṃ, sāmīcikammaṃ, āsanābhihāraṃ sādiyati…pe… na pakatattassa bhikkhuno seyyābhihāraṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ, pādakathalikaṃ, pattacīvarappaṭiggahaṇaṃ, nahāne piṭṭhiparikammaṃ sādiyati…pe… na pakatattaṃ bhikkhuṃ sīlavipattiyā anuddhaṃseti, na ācāravipattiyā anuddhaṃseti, na diṭṭhivipattiyā anuddhaṃseti, na ājīvavipattiyā anuddhaṃseti, na bhikkhuṃ bhikkhūhi bhedeti…pe… na gihiddhajaṃ dhāreti, na titthiyaddhajaṃ dhāreti, na titthiye sevati, bhikkhū sevati, bhikkhusikkhāya sikkhati…pe… na pakatattena bhikkhunā saddhiṃ ekacchanne āvāse vasati, na ekacchanne anāvāse vasati, na ekacchanne āvāse vā anāvāse vā vasati, pakatattaṃ bhikkhuṃ disvā āsanā vuṭṭhāti, na pakatattaṃ bhikkhuṃ āsādeti anto vā bahi vā – imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ paṭippassambhetabbaṃ.

Again, bhikkhus, the act of suspension against a bhikkhu endowed with five factors, for not making amends for an offense, should be rescinded. He does not commit the offense for which the Sangha imposed the act of suspension for not making amends, nor another offense of a similar kind, nor one more serious than that; he does not disparage the act, nor those who performed it… He does not accept the bowing down to, rising up for, saluting with joined palms, proper duties, or the offering of a seat from a bhikkhu in good standing… He does not accept the offering of a bed, foot-water, a footstool, a foot-wiping cloth, the receiving of bowl and robe, or back-rubbing while bathing from a bhikkhu in good standing… He does not reproach a bhikkhu in good standing for failure in virtue, failure in conduct, failure in view, or failure in livelihood; he does not cause a schism among bhikkhus… He does not bear the banner of householders, nor the banner of sectarians; he does not associate with sectarians, but associates with bhikkhus and trains in the training of bhikkhus… He does not dwell under the same roof with a bhikkhu in good standing, whether in a monastery or outside a monastery; upon seeing a bhikkhu in good standing, he rises from his seat; he does not harass a bhikkhu in good standing, whether inside or outside. Bhikkhus, the act of suspension against a bhikkhu endowed with these five factors, for not making amends for an offense, should be rescinded.

‘‘Aṭṭhahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ paṭippassambhetabbaṃ. Na pakatattassa bhikkhuno uposathaṃ ṭhapeti, na pavāraṇaṃ ṭhapeti, na savacanīyaṃ karoti, na anuvādaṃ paṭṭhapeti, na okāsaṃ kāreti, na codeti, na sāreti, na bhikkhūhi sampayojeti – imehi kho, bhikkhave, aṭṭhahaṅgehi samannāgatassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ paṭippassambhetabbaṃ.

Bhikkhus, the act of suspension against a bhikkhu endowed with eight factors, for not making amends for an offense, should be rescinded. He does not suspend the Uposatha of a bhikkhu in good standing; he does not suspend the Pavāraṇā; he does not make himself amenable to instruction; he does not initiate a charge; he does not ask for an opportunity; he does not admonish; he does not remind; he does not associate with bhikkhus. Bhikkhus, the act of suspension against a bhikkhu endowed with these eight factors, for not making amends for an offense, should be rescinded.

The Forty-three on What Should Be Rescinded is Completed.

64. ‘‘Evañca pana, bhikkhave, paṭippassambhetabbaṃ. Tena bhikkhave, channena bhikkhunā saṅghaṃ upasaṅkamitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā vuḍḍhānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ pāde vanditvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā evamassa vacanīyo – ‘ahaṃ, bhante, saṅghena, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammakato sammā vattāmi, lomaṃ pātemi, netthāraṃ vattāmi, āpattiyā appaṭikamme ukkhepanīyassa kammassa paṭippassaddhiṃ yācāmī’ti. Dutiyampi yācitabbā. Tatiyampi yācitabbā. Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

64.And, bhikkhus, it should be rescinded in this way. Then that bhikkhu Channa, having approached the Sangha, should arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, pay homage at the feet of the senior bhikkhus, sit in a squatting position, raising his hands in añjali, and say this: ‘Venerable Sirs, I, having been subjected to the act of suspension by the Sangha for not making amends for an offense, am conducting myself correctly, I am letting my hair grow, I am conducting myself so as to be restored, and I request the rescinding of the act of suspension for not making amends for the offense.’ He should be requested a second time, and a third time. A competent and capable bhikkhu should then inform the Sangha thus:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ channo bhikkhu saṅghena, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammakato sammā vattati, lomaṃ pāteti, netthāraṃ vattati, āpattiyā appaṭikamme ukkhepanīyassa kammassa paṭippassaddhiṃ yācati. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho channassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ paṭippassambheyya. Esā ñatti.

Venerable Sirs, may the Sangha hear me. This bhikkhu Channa, against whom the Sangha has imposed the act of suspension for not making amends for an offense, is conducting himself correctly, letting his hair grow, conducting himself so as to be restored, and requests the rescinding of the act of suspension for not making amends for an offense. If it is appropriate for the Sangha, the Sangha may rescind the act of suspension against the bhikkhu Channa for not making amends for an offense. This is the motion.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ channo bhikkhu saṅghena, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammakato sammā vattati, lomaṃ pāteti, netthāraṃ vattati, āpattiyā appaṭikamme ukkhepanīyassa kammassa paṭippassaddhiṃ yācati.

Yassāyasmato khamati channassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyassa kammassa paṭippassaddhi, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

Venerable Sirs, may the Sangha hear me. This bhikkhu Channa, against whom the Sangha has imposed the act of suspension for not making amends for an offense, is conducting himself correctly, letting his hair grow, conducting himself so as to be restored, and requests the rescinding of the act of suspension for not making amends for an offense. The Sangha rescinds the act of suspension against the bhikkhu Channa for not making amends for an offense. Any venerable one who approves of the rescinding of the act of suspension against the bhikkhu Channa for not making amends for an offense should remain silent; whoever does not approve should speak.

‘‘Dutiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi…pe… tatiyampi etamatthaṃ vadāmi – suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Ayaṃ channo bhikkhu saṅghena, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammakato sammā vattati, lomaṃ pāteti, netthāraṃ vattati, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyassa kammassa paṭippassaddhiṃ yācati.

Yassāyasmato khamati channassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyassa kammassa paṭippassaddhi, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

For a second time I speak on this matter… For a third time I speak on this matter: Venerable Sirs, may the Sangha hear me. This bhikkhu Channa, against whom the Sangha has imposed the act of suspension for not making amends for an offense, is conducting himself correctly, letting his hair grow, conducting himself so as to be restored, and requests the rescinding of the act of suspension for not making amends for the offense. The Sangha rescinds the act of suspension against the bhikkhu Channa for not making amends for an offense. Any venerable one who approves of the rescinding of the act of suspension against the bhikkhu Channa for not making amends for an offense should remain silent; whoever does not approve should speak.

‘‘Paṭippassaddhaṃ saṅghena channassa bhikkhuno, āpattiyā appaṭikamme, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

The act of suspension against the bhikkhu Channa for not making amends for an offense has been rescinded by the Sangha. The Sangha approves of it, and is therefore silent. Thus I hold it.

Āpattiyā appaṭikamme ukkhepanīyakammaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ chaṭṭhaṃ.

The Act of Suspension for Failure to Make Amends for an Offense is Concluded, the Sixth.

65.At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now at that time a monk named Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture-trainer, had conceived such an evil view: ‘As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things declared by the Blessed One to be impediments are not in fact impediments for one who engages in them.’ A number of monks heard that the monk Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture-trainer, had conceived such an evil view: ‘As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things declared by the Blessed One to be impediments are not in fact impediments for one who engages in them.’ Then those monks approached the monk Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture-trainer. Having approached, they said to the monk Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture-trainer: ‘Is it true, friend Ariṭṭha, that you have conceived such an evil view: “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things declared by the Blessed One to be impediments are not in fact impediments for one who engages in them”?’ ‘Just so, friends. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things declared by the Blessed One to be impediments are not in fact impediments for one who engages in them.’

‘‘Māvuso ariṭṭha, evaṃ avaca. Mā bhagavantaṃ abbhācikkhi. Na hi sādhu bhagavato abbhakkhānaṃ [abbhācikkhanaṃ (ka.)]. Na hi bhagavā evaṃ vadeyya. Anekapariyāyenāvuso ariṭṭha, antarāyikā dhammā antarāyikā vuttā bhagavatā. Alañca pana te paṭisevato antarāyāya. Appassādā kāmā vuttā bhagavatā, bahudukkhā bahupāyāsā [bahūpāyāsā (sī. syā.)], ādīnavo ettha bhiyyo. Aṭṭhikaṅkalūpamā kāmā vuttā bhagavatā, bahudukkhā bahūpāyāsā, ādīnavo ettha bhiyyo.

“Do not speak thus, friend Ariṭṭha. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One. It is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would not speak thus. In many ways, friend Ariṭṭha, the Blessed One has declared things that are impediments to be impediments. And they are indeed sufficient to be an impediment for one who engages in them. Sensual pleasures have been declared by the Blessed One to have little satisfaction, to be full of suffering, full of vexation, and the danger in them is greater. Sensual pleasures have been declared by the Blessed One to be like a skeleton, full of suffering, full of vexation, and the danger in them is greater. Sensual pleasures have been declared by the Blessed One to be like a lump of flesh… like a grass torch… like a pit of glowing embers… like a dream… like borrowed goods… like fruit on a tree… like a butcher’s knife… like a spear-point… like a snake’s head—full of suffering, full of vexation, and the danger in them is greater.”

Even though the monk Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture-trainer, was spoken to by those monks in this way, he still clung firmly to that evil view and persisted in declaring: ‘Just so, friends. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things declared by the Blessed One to be impediments are not in fact impediments for one who engages in them.’ And when those monks were unable to dissuade the monk Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture-trainer, from that evil view, they approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they reported the matter to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion and for this reason, had the Saṅgha of bhikkhus assembled and questioned the monk Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture-trainer: ‘Is it true, Ariṭṭha, that such an evil view has arisen in you—that you understand the Dhamma taught by me in such a way that those things declared by me to be impediments are not in fact impediments for one who engages in them?’ ‘Just so, Venerable sir. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things declared by the Blessed One to be impediments are not in fact impediments for one who engages in them.’

Yet you, foolish man, by your wrong grasp, not only misrepresent us but also harm yourself and produce much demerit. This, foolish man, will lead to your long-term harm and suffering. This, foolish man, does not lead to the confidence of those without faith, nor to the increase of confidence in those with faith.” Having rebuked him… and given a Dhamma talk, he addressed the bhikkhus: “Well then, bhikkhus, let the Saṅgha perform the act of suspension against the monk Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture-trainer, for not relinquishing his evil view—non-association with the Saṅgha. And this, bhikkhus, is how it should be done: First, the monk Ariṭṭha should be charged. Having been charged, he should be reminded. Having been reminded, the offense should be imposed. Having imposed the offense, a competent and capable bhikkhu should inform the Saṅgha—”

Eko buddhassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati, eko dhammassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati, eko saṅghassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati – imesaṃ kho, bhikkhave, tiṇṇaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ, ākaṅkhamāno saṅgho, pāpikāya diṭṭhiyā appaṭinissage, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ kareyya.

Further, monks, if the Saṅgha wishes, it may impose the act of suspension on three bhikkhus for not relinquishing a bad view. One speaks disparagingly of the Buddha, speaks disparagingly of the Dhamma, speaks disparagingly of the Saṅgha. Monks, if the Saṅgha wishes, it may impose the act of suspension on these three bhikkhus for not relinquishing a bad view.

70.Monks, a monk against whom an act of suspension has been carried out for not relinquishing a wicked view should behave properly. And what is proper behavior in that case? He should not give ordination; he should not give dependence; he should not have a novice attend on him; he should not agree to the authorization to instruct nuns; even if authorized, he should not instruct nuns. The offense on account of which the Saṅgha carried out the act of suspension against him for not relinquishing a wicked view, that offense should not be committed, nor another offense like it, nor one worse than it. The act should not be disparaged; those who performed the act should not be disparaged… A monk in good standing’s Uposatha should not be stopped; his Pavāraṇā should not be stopped; he should not be addressed; no reproof should be initiated; no opportunity for confession should be made; he should not be accused; he should not be reminded; he should not associate with the monks.

Concerning the act of suspension for not relinquishing a wicked view.

The forty-third section is concluded.

71. Atha kho saṅgho ariṭṭhassa bhikkhuno gaddhabādhipubbassa, pāpikāya diṭṭhiyā appaṭinissagge, ukkhepanīyakammaṃ akāsi – asambhogaṃ saṅghena. So saṅghena, pāpikāya diṭṭhiyā appaṭinissagge, ukkhepanīyakammakato vibbhami. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma ariṭṭho bhikkhu gaddhabādhipubbo saṅghena, pāpikāya diṭṭhiyā appaṭinissagge, ukkhepanīyakammakato vibbhamissatī’’ti? Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

71.Then the Saṅgha performed the act of suspension against the monk Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture killer, for not relinquishing his wicked view—exclusion from association with the Saṅgha. Suspended by the Saṅgha for not relinquishing his wicked view, he went astray. The monks who were modest…pe… were critical, murmured, and expressed their dissatisfaction: “How could the monk Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture killer, go astray after the Saṅgha performed the act of suspension against him for not relinquishing his wicked view?” Then those monks informed the Blessed One of this matter.

Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā bhikkhū paṭipucchi – ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, ariṭṭho bhikkhu gaddhabādhipubbo saṅghena, pāpikāya diṭṭhiyā appaṭinissagge, ukkhepanīyakammakato vibbhamatī’’ti [vibbhamīti (sī. ka.)]? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā – ‘‘ananucchavikaṃ…pe… kathañhi nāma so, bhikkhave, moghapuriso saṅghena, pāpikāya diṭṭhiyā appaṭinissagge, ukkhepanīyakammakato vibbhamissati?

Then the Blessed One, in connection with this cause, on this occasion, convened the Saṅgha of monks and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the monk Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture killer, having been suspended by the Saṅgha for not relinquishing a wicked view, is going astray?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked him: “It is unseemly… How could that foolish man, monks, having been suspended by the Saṅgha for not relinquishing a wicked view, go astray? This will not lead to confidence in the unconvinced… Having rebuked him… after delivering a Dhamma talk, he addressed the monks: “Well then, monks, let the Saṅgha rescind the act of suspension for not relinquishing a wicked view.”

He commits the offense for which the Saṅgha performed the act of suspension on account of his not relinquishing a wrong view, or another similar to it, or one worse than that. He disparages the act, he disparages those who performed it. Monks, for a bhikkhu endowed with these five factors, if he does not relinquish a wrong view, the act of suspension should not be rescinded….”

“Monks, for a bhikkhu endowed with eight factors, if he does not relinquish a wrong view, the act of suspension should not be rescinded. He prevents a regular bhikkhu from observing the Uposatha, he prevents him from performing the Pavāraṇā, he makes him subject to admonition, he establishes an accusation, he makes him give an opportunity, he accuses him, he reminds him (of the offense), he associates him with bhikkhus. Monks, for a bhikkhu endowed with these eight factors, if he does not relinquish a wrong view, the act of suspension should not be rescinded.”

74.And, monks, it should be revoked in this way. A monk who has been subjected by the Sangha to the act of suspension for not relinquishing a wicked view should approach the Sangha, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, pay homage at the feet of the senior monks, sit in a squatting position, raise his joined palms, and say this: ‘Venerable sirs, I have been rightly subjected by the Sangha to the act of suspension for not relinquishing a wicked view. I behave properly, I shave my hair, I conduct myself so as to be led out of this situation, and I request the revocation of the act of suspension for not relinquishing a wicked view.’ He should make the request a second time. He should make the request a third time. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho.

If it is agreeable to the Sangha, may the Sangha revoke the act of suspension against the monk named so-and-so for not relinquishing a wicked view. This is the motion.

Its Summary:

Paṇḍulohitakā bhikkhū, sayaṃ bhaṇḍanakārakā;Tādise upasaṅkamma, ussahiṃsu ca bhaṇḍane.

The Paṇḍulohitaka monks, who themselves caused quarrels; Approaching such ones, they strove in quarreling.

Anuppannāpi jāyanti [anuppannāni jāyanti (sī. syā.)], uppannānipi vaḍḍhare [uppannāni pavaḍḍhare (sī.), uppannāpi pavaḍḍhanti (ka.)];Appicchā pesalā bhikkhū, ujjhāyanti padassato [parīsato (syā.), parassato (sī.)].

Even those not arisen arise, and those arisen increase; the monks of few wishes and amiable are displeased at the sight of the fault.

Saddhammaṭṭhitiko buddho, sayambhū aggapuggalo;Āṇāpesi tajjanīyakammaṃ sāvatthiyaṃ jino.

The Buddha, established in the True Dhamma, self-existent, supreme among persons; the Victor at Sāvatthī prescribed the act of censure.

Asammukhāppaṭipucchāppaṭiññāya katañca yaṃ;Anāpatti adesane, desitāya katañca yaṃ.

Without being face to face, without questioning, without avowal, and what was done; There is no offense in non-disclosure, and what was done after disclosure.

Acodetvā asāretvā, anāropetvā ca yaṃ kataṃ;Asammukhā adhammena, vaggena cāpi [vaggenāpi ca (sī. syā.)] yaṃ kataṃ.

Without rebuking, without reminding, without establishing (an offense), and what was done; Without being face to face, unlawfully, and what was done by a faction as well.

Without questioning, unlawfully, again, what was done by a faction; Without avowal, unlawfully, and what was done by a faction as well.

Anāpatti [anāpattiyā (sī. syā.)] adhammena, vaggena

There is no offense through illegality or by a group.

And also what was done.

Adesanāgāminiyā, adhammavaggameva ca.

By not leading to disclosure, and by an unrighteous faction.

Desitāya adhammena, vaggenāpi tatheva ca;Acodetvā adhammena, vaggenāpi tatheva ca.

Asāretvā adhammena, vaggenāpi tatheva ca;Anāropetvā adhammena, vaggenāpi tatheva ca.

Without reminding, unlawfully, and likewise by a faction; Without establishing (an offense), unlawfully, and likewise by a faction.

Kaṇhavāranayeneva, sukkavāraṃ vijāniyā;Saṅgho ākaṅkhamāno ca yassa tajjaniyaṃ kare.

Just as by the dark method, one should understand the bright method; and the Sangha, if it wishes, may perform the act of censure against whom it wishes.

Bhaṇḍanaṃ bālo saṃsaṭṭho, adhisīle ajjhācāre;Atidiṭṭhivipannassa, saṅgho tajjaniyaṃ kare.

A fool, involved in quarrels, associated (with evil companions), regarding higher virtue and misconduct; For one fallen away through extreme views, the Sangha may perform the act of censure.

Buddhadhammassa saṅghassa, avaṇṇaṃ yo ca bhāsati;Tiṇṇannampi ca bhikkhūnaṃ, saṅgho tajjaniyaṃ kare.

One who speaks dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha; and for even three monks, the Sangha should perform the act of censure.

Bhaṇḍanaṃ kārako eko, bālo saṃsagganissito;Adhisīle ajjhācāre, tatheva atidiṭṭhiyā.

One who causes quarrels, a fool, reliant on association (with evil companions), in higher virtue, in misconduct, and likewise in extreme views.

Buddhadhammassa saṅghassa, avaṇṇaṃ yo ca bhāsati;Tajjanīyakammakato, evaṃ sammānuvattanā.

One who speaks dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha, having been subjected to the act of censure, thus is proper conduct.

Upasampadanissayā, sāmaṇeraṃ upaṭṭhanā;Ovādasammatenāpi, na kare tajjanīkato.

Not granting dependence for ordination, not attending to a novice, even if appointed to give advice—a censured one should not do these.

Nāpajje tañca āpattiṃ, tādisañca tato paraṃ;Kammañca kammike cāpi, na garahe tathāvidho.

He does not commit that offense, nor one similar to it after that; and being such, he does not disparage the action nor those who performed the action.

Uposathaṃ pavāraṇaṃ, pakatattassa naṭṭhape;Savacaniṃ [na savacaniyaṃ (sī. syā.)] anuvādo, okāso codanena ca.

He does not stop the Uposatha and Pavāraṇā of a monk in good standing; he does not make himself amenable to instruction, does not initiate an accusation, does not ask for an opportunity, and does not rebuke.

Sāraṇaṃ sampayogañca, na kareyya tathāvidho;Upasampadanissayā, sāmaṇeraṃ upaṭṭhanā.

He does not remind or associate (with monks); he does not grant dependence for ordination, nor attend to a novice.

Ovādasammatenāpi, pañcahaṅgehi [pañcaaṅgo (ka.)] na sammati;Tañcāpajjati āpattiṃ, tādisañca tato paraṃ.

Even if appointed to give advice, he does not conform to these five qualities; he commits that offense, and one similar to it after that.

Kammañca kammike cāpi, garahanto na sammati;Uposathaṃ pavāraṇaṃ, savacanīyā ca novādo.

And disparaging the action and those who performed it, he does not conform; he does not conform to Uposatha, Pavāraṇā, amenability to instruction, and not advising.

Okāso codanañceva, sāraṇā sampayojanā;Imehaṭṭhaṅgehi yo yutto, tajjanānupasammati.

Opportunity, rebuke, reminding, and association; one who is endowed with these eight qualities is not pacified by censure.

Kaṇhavāranayeneva, sukkavāraṃ vijāniyā;Bālo āpattibahulo, saṃsaṭṭhopi ca seyyaso.

Just as by the dark method, one should understand the bright method; a fool, full of offenses, even when associated, is worse.

Niyassakammaṃ sambuddho, āṇāpesi mahāmuni;Kīṭāgirismiṃ dve bhikkhū, assajipunabbasukā.

The Perfectly Enlightened One, the Great Sage, prescribed the act of dependence; He enjoined it at Kīṭāgiri for the two monks, Assaji and Punabbasuka.

Anācārañca vividhaṃ, ācariṃsu asaññatā;Pabbājanīyaṃ sambuddho, kammaṃ sāvatthiyaṃ jino;Macchikāsaṇḍe sudhammo, cittassāvāsiko ahu.

They engaged in various kinds of misconduct, unrestrained. The Perfectly Enlightened One, the Victor, prescribed the act of banishment in Sāvatthī. Sudhamma, the resident of Citta, was in Macchikāsaṇḍa.

Jātivādena khuṃseti, sudhammo cittupāsakaṃ;Paṭisāraṇīyakammaṃ, āṇāpesi tathāgato.

Sudhamma reviled Citta the lay follower with talk of birth; the Tathagata enjoined the act of reconciliation.

Kosambiyaṃ channaṃ bhikkhuṃ, nicchantāpattiṃ passituṃ;Adassane ukkhipituṃ, āṇāpesi jinuttamo.

At Kosambi, the Supreme Victor enjoined the suspension of the monk Channa for not acknowledging an offense he did not wish to confess.

Channo taṃyeva āpattiṃ, paṭikātuṃ na icchati;Ukkhepanāppaṭikamme, āṇāpesi vināyako.

Channa did not wish to make amends for that very offense; the Leader enjoined suspension for not making amends.

Pāpadiṭṭhi ariṭṭhassa, āsi aññāṇanissitā;Diṭṭhiyāppaṭinissagge [diṭṭhiappaṭinissagge (ka.)], ukkhepaṃ jinabhāsitaṃ.

Ariṭṭha's wicked view was based on ignorance; for not relinquishing his view, the Victor prescribed suspension.

Niyassakammaṃ pabbajjaṃ [pabbājaṃ (ka.)], tatheva paṭisāraṇī;Adassanāppaṭikamme, anissagge ca diṭṭhiyā.

The act of dependence, expulsion, and likewise reconciliation; for non-acknowledgment (of offense), non-making-amends, and non-relinquishing of view.

Davānācārūpaghāti, micchāājīvameva ca;Pabbājanīyakammamhi, atirekapadā ime.

Violence, misconduct, harming, and wrong livelihood—these are additional terms in the act of expulsion.

Alābhāvaṇṇā dve pañca, dve pañcakāti nāmakā [dve pañcakoti nāmako (ka.)];Paṭisāraṇīyakammamhi, atirekapadā ime.

Dispraise of gain, two, five, two, and five by name—these are additional terms in the act of reconciliation.
