75. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena pārivāsikā bhikkhū sādiyanti pakatattānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ, añjalikammaṃ, sāmīcikammaṃ, āsanābhihāraṃ, seyyābhihāraṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ, pādakathalikaṃ, pattacīvarapaṭiggahaṇaṃ, nahāne piṭṭhiparikammaṃ. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma pārivāsikā bhikkhū sādiyissanti pakatattānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ, añjalikammaṃ, sāmīcikammaṃ, āsanābhihāraṃ, seyyābhihāraṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ, pādakathalikaṃ, pattacīvarapaṭiggahaṇaṃ, nahāne piṭṭhiparikamma’’nti! Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

75.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. Now at that time monks undergoing the period of probation accepted from monks of normal standing the following: bowing down to them, rising up for them, saluting with joined palms, proper duties, offering a seat, offering a bed, water for washing the feet, a footstool, a foot-wiping cloth, receiving bowl and robe, and massaging the back during bathing. Those monks who were modest… complained, murmured, and spread it about, saying: "How can monks undergoing the period of probation accept from monks of normal standing bowing down to them, rising up for them, saluting with joined palms, proper duties, offering a seat, offering a bed, water for washing the feet, a footstool, a foot-wiping cloth, receiving bowl and robe, and massaging the back during bathing?" Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One.

Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā bhikkhū paṭipucchi – ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, pārivāsikā bhikkhū sādiyanti pakatattānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ, añjalikammaṃ, sāmīcikammaṃ, āsanābhihāraṃ, seyyābhihāraṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ, pādakathalikaṃ, pattacīvarapaṭiggahaṇaṃ, nahāne piṭṭhiparikamma’’nti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā – ‘‘ananucchavikaṃ…pe… kathañhi nāma, bhikkhave, pārivāsikā bhikkhū sādiyissanti pakatattānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ, añjalikammaṃ, sāmīcikammaṃ, āsanābhihāraṃ, seyyābhihāraṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ, pādakathalikaṃ, pattacīvarapaṭiggahaṇaṃ, nahāne piṭṭhiparikammaṃ. Netaṃ, bhikkhave, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, pārivāsikena bhikkhunā sāditabbaṃ pakatattānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ, añjalikammaṃ, sāmīcikammaṃ, āsanābhihāro, seyyābhihāro, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ, pādakathalikaṃ, pattacīvarapaṭiggahaṇaṃ, nahāne piṭṭhiparikammaṃ. Yo sādiyeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa.

Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, in connection with this matter, convened the Sangha of monks and questioned them: “Is it true, monks, that monks undergoing the period of probation approve of monks of normal standing offering such things as bowing, rising up for them, saluting with joined palms, proper duties, offering a seat, offering a bed, water for washing the feet, a footstool, a foot-wiping cloth, receiving the bowl and robe, and massaging the back during bathing?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One rebuked them: “It is unsuitable… How can monks undergoing the period of probation approve of monks of normal standing offering such things as bowing, rising up for them, saluting with joined palms, proper duties, offering a seat, offering a bed, water for washing the feet, a footstool, a foot-wiping cloth, receiving the bowl and robe, and massaging the back during bathing? This will not inspire confidence in those without it….” Having rebuked them… he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, a monk undergoing the period of probation should not approve of monks of normal standing offering such things as bowing, rising up for them, saluting with joined palms, proper duties, offering a seat, offering a bed, water for washing the feet, a footstool, a foot-wiping cloth, receiving the bowl and robe, and massaging the back during bathing. Whoever approves of it commits an offense of wrong conduct.

‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, pārivāsikānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ mithu yathāvuḍḍhaṃ abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ, añjalikammaṃ, sāmīcikammaṃ, āsanābhihāraṃ, seyyābhihāraṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ, pādakathalikaṃ, pattacīvarapaṭiggahaṇaṃ, nahāne piṭṭhiparikammaṃ.

“I allow, monks, that monks undergoing the period of probation may mutually perform among themselves, according to seniority, such acts as greetings, rising up for each other, saluting with joined palms, proper duties, offering a seat, offering a bed, water for the feet, a footstool, a foot-wiping cloth, receiving the bowl and robe, and massaging the back during bathing.

‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, pārivāsikānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ pañca yathāvuḍḍhaṃ – uposathaṃ, pavāraṇaṃ, vassikasāṭikaṃ, oṇojanaṃ, bhattaṃ. Tena hi, bhikkhave, pārivāsikānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ vattaṃ paññapessāmi yathā pārivāsikehi bhikkhūhi vattitabbaṃ.

“I allow, monks, for monks undergoing the period of probation, five things according to seniority: the Uposatha, the Pavāraṇā, the rainy-season robe-cloth, the deferral of offerings, and the meal. Therefore, monks, I will prescribe observances for monks undergoing the period of probation, how monks undergoing the period of probation should behave.”

76. ‘‘Pārivāsikena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā sammā vattitabbaṃ. Tatrāyaṃ sammāvattanā –

76.“Monks, a monk undergoing the period of probation should behave properly. This is the proper conduct:

Na upasampādetabbaṃ, na nissayo dātabbo, na sāmaṇero upaṭṭhāpetabbo, na bhikkhunovādakasammuti sāditabbā, sammatenapi bhikkhuniyo na ovaditabbā. Yāya āpattiyā saṅghena parivāso dinno hoti sā āpatti na āpajjitabbā, aññā vā tādisikā, tato vā pāpiṭṭhatarā; kammaṃ na garahitabbaṃ, kammikā na garahitabbā. Na pakatattassa bhikkhuno uposatho ṭhapetabbo, na pavāraṇā ṭhapetabbā, na savacanīyaṃ kātabbaṃ, na anuvādo paṭṭhapetabbo, na okāso kāretabbo, na codetabbo, na sāretabbo, na bhikkhūhi sampayojetabbaṃ.

He should not give ordination, nor give dependence, nor take on a novice, nor accept appointment as a nun’s advisor, nor advise nuns even if appointed. He should not commit the offense for which the Sangha gave him the period of probation, nor one similar to it, nor one more serious than it; he should not criticize the act, nor those who performed the act. He should not suspend the Uposatha of a monk of normal standing, nor suspend the Pavāraṇā, nor conduct a formal admonition, nor initiate a formal charge, nor ask for an opportunity (to speak), nor accuse, nor remind (of a past fault), nor cause monks to quarrel.

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, pārivāsikena bhikkhunā pakatattassa bhikkhuno purato gantabbaṃ, na purato nisīditabbaṃ. Yo hoti saṅghassa āsanapariyanto seyyāpariyanto vihārapariyanto so tassa padātabbo. Tena ca so sāditabbo.

“Monks, a monk undergoing the period of probation should not go in front of a monk of normal standing, nor sit in front of him. Whatever is the Sangha’s last seat, last resting place, last lodging, that should be assigned to him. And he should be satisfied with it.

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, pārivāsikena bhikkhunā pakatattena bhikkhunā puresamaṇena vā pacchāsamaṇena vā kulāni upasaṅkamitabbāni, na āraññikaṅgaṃ samādātabbaṃ [samāditabbaṃ (ka.)], na piṇḍapātikaṅgaṃ samādātabbaṃ, na ca tappaccayā piṇḍapāto nīharāpetabbo – mā maṃ jāniṃsūti.

“Monks, a monk undergoing the period of probation should not visit families with a monk of normal standing, whether as a senior companion or a junior companion; he should not undertake the practice of dwelling in the forest, nor should he undertake the alms-food practice, nor should he have alms-food brought to him on that account, thinking, ‘Let them not know me.’

‘‘Pārivāsikena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā āgantukena ārocetabbaṃ, āgantukassa ārocetabbaṃ, uposathe ārocetabbaṃ, pavāraṇāya ārocetabbaṃ. Sace gilāno hoti, dūtenapi ārocetabbaṃ.

“Monks, a monk undergoing the period of probation should inform (his status) when he is an incoming monk, and should inform (his status) to incoming monks, should inform on the Uposatha day, should inform on the Pavāraṇā day. If he is sick, he should inform even by a messenger.

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, pārivāsikena bhikkhunā sabhikkhukā āvāsā abhikkhuko āvāso gantabbo, aññatra pakatattena, aññatra antarāyā.

“Monks, a monk undergoing the period of probation should not go to a monastery without monks from a monastery with monks, except with a monk of normal standing, or in case of danger.

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, pārivāsikena bhikkhunā sabhikkhukā āvāsā abhikkhuko anāvāso gantabbo, aññatra pakatattena, aññatra antarāyā. Na, bhikkhave, pārivāsikena bhikkhunā sabhikkhukā āvāsā abhikkhuko āvāso vā anāvāso vā gantabbo, aññatra pakatattena, aññatra antarāyā.

He should not sit on the same seat as a regular monk, nor sit on a higher seat when the regular monk is sitting on a lower one, nor sit on a seat when the regular monk is sitting on the ground.

If, monks, a probationer is the fourth (member of the quorum) and should grant probation, recall to the origin, impose mānatta, or reinstate, that is inoperative, and it is not to be done.

83. Atha kho āyasmā upāli yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami. Upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā upāli bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kati nu kho, bhante, pārivāsikassa bhikkhuno ratticchedā’’ti? ‘‘Tayo kho, upāli, pārivāsikassa bhikkhuno ratticchedā. Sahavāso, vippavāso, anārocanā – ime kho, upāli, tayo pārivāsikassa bhikkhuno ratticchedā’’ti.

83.Then Venerable Upāli approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, Venerable Upāli said to the Blessed One: "How many, sir, are the night interruptions for a monk undergoing probation?" "There are three, Upāli, night interruptions for a monk undergoing probation: cohabitation, separation, and non-disclosure. These, Upāli, are the three night interruptions for a monk undergoing probation."

84. Tena kho pana samayena sāvatthiyaṃ mahābhikkhusaṅgho sannipatito hoti. Na sakkonti pārivāsikā bhikkhū parivāsaṃ sodhetuṃ. Bhagavato [te bhikkhū bhagavato (syā., evamuparipi)] etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, parivāsaṃ nikkhipituṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, nikkhipitabbo.

Nikkhitto hoti parivāso. ‘Vattaṃ nikkhipāmī’ti. Nikkhitto hoti parivāso.

84.At that time, a great assembly of monks had gathered in Sāvatthī. The monks undergoing probation were unable to purify their probation. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, the setting aside of probation. And, monks, it should be set aside like this: The monk undergoing probation should approach one monk, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, squat down, raise his joined palms, and say: ‘I set aside the probation.’ The probation is set aside. ‘I set aside the observance.’ The probation is set aside."

85. Tena kho pana samayena sāvatthiyā bhikkhū tahaṃ tahaṃ pakkamiṃsu. Sakkonti pārivāsikā bhikkhū parivāsaṃ sodhetuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, parivāsaṃ samādiyituṃ [samādātuṃ (syā. kaṃ.)]. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, samādiyitabbo [samāditabbo (sī. syā. kaṃ.)]. Tena pārivāsikena bhikkhunā ekaṃ bhikkhuṃ upasaṅkamitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā evamassa vacanīyo – ‘parivāsaṃ samādiyāmī’ti. Samādinno hoti parivāso. ‘Vattaṃ samādiyāmī’ti. Samādinno hoti parivāso’’.

85.At that time, the monks in Savatthi had dispersed to various places. The monks on probation were able to purify their probation. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, the undertaking of probation. And this is how, monks, it should be undertaken. The monk on probation should approach one monk, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, squat down, raise his joined palms, and say: 'I undertake probation.' The probation is then undertaken. 'I undertake the observances.' The probation is then undertaken."

86. Tena kho pana samayena mūlāyapaṭikassanārahā bhikkhū sādiyanti pakatattānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ, añjalikammaṃ, sāmīcikammaṃ, āsanābhihāraṃ, seyyābhihāraṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ, pādakathalikaṃ, pattacīvarapaṭiggahaṇaṃ, nahāne piṭṭhiparikammaṃ. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma mūlāyapaṭikassanārahā bhikkhū sādiyissanti pakatattānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ…pe… nahāne piṭṭhiparikamma’’nti. Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

86.Now at that time, monks liable to reversion to the beginning accepted from monks in good standing salutation, rising up, the gesture of homage, dutiful acts, offering a seat, offering a bed, water for the feet, a footstool, a foot-wiper, receiving bowl and robe, and back-massage during bathing. Those monks who were modest… criticized, complained, and spread it about: “How can monks liable to reversion to the beginning accept from monks in good standing salutation, rising up… back-massage during bathing?” Then those monks reported this matter to the Blessed One.

Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā bhikkhū paṭipucchi – ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, mūlāyapaṭikassanārahā bhikkhū sādiyanti pakatattānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ…pe… nahāne piṭṭhiparikamma’’nti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā – ‘‘ananucchavikaṃ…pe… kathañhi nāma, bhikkhave, mūlāyapaṭikassanārahā bhikkhū sādiyissanti pakatattānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ…pe… nahāne piṭṭhiparikammaṃ! Netaṃ bhikkhave, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, mūlāyapaṭikassanārahena bhikkhunā sāditabbaṃ pakatattānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ, añjalikammaṃ, sāmīcikammaṃ, āsanābhihāro, seyyābhihāro, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ, pādakathalikaṃ, pattacīvarapaṭiggahaṇaṃ, nahāne piṭṭhiparikammaṃ. Yo sādiyeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, mūlāyapaṭikassanārahānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ mithu yathāvuḍḍhaṃ abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ…pe… nahāne piṭṭhiparikammaṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, mūlāyapaṭikassanārahānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ pañca yathāvuḍḍhaṃ – uposathaṃ, pavāraṇaṃ, vassikasāṭikaṃ, oṇojanaṃ, bhattaṃ. Tena hi, bhikkhave, mūlāyapaṭikassanārahānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ vattaṃ paññāpessāmi yathā mūlāyapaṭikassanārahehi bhikkhūhi vattitabbaṃ.

Then, on that occasion, in connection with that matter, the Blessed One had the Sangha of monks convened and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that monks liable to reversion to the beginning accept salutation, rising up… back-massage during bathing from monks in good standing?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One rebuked them: “Monks, this is not suitable, it is not proper, it is not becoming for a recluse, it is not lawful, it is not to be done. How can monks liable to reversion to the beginning accept salutation, rising up… back-massage during bathing from monks in good standing! This will not lead to confidence in the unconvinced nor to increase the confidence of the convinced.” Having rebuked them in many ways, having given a Dhamma talk, he addressed the monks: “Monks, a monk liable to reversion to the beginning should not accept salutation, rising up, the gesture of homage, dutiful acts, offering a seat, offering a bed, water for the feet, a footstool, a foot-wiper, receiving his bowl and robes, or back-massage during bathing from monks in good standing. Whoever accepts this commits an offense of dukkata. I allow, monks, monks liable to reversion to the beginning to mutually perform salutation, rising up… back-massage during bathing according to seniority. I allow, monks, monks liable to reversion to the beginning five things according to seniority: the Uposatha, the Pavāraṇā, the rains-bathing cloth, invitations, and meals. Therefore, monks, I will prescribe the observance for monks liable to reversion to the beginning, how monks liable to reversion to the beginning should behave.”

87. ‘‘Mūlāyapaṭikassanārahena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā sammā vattitabbaṃ. Tatrāyaṃ sammāvattanā –

87.“Monks, a monk liable to reversion to the beginning should behave properly. And this is the proper observance:

Na upasampādetabbaṃ, na nissayo dātabbo, na sāmaṇero upaṭṭhāpetabbo, na bhikkhunovādakasammuti sāditabbā, sammatenapi bhikkhuniyo na ovaditabbā. Yāya āpattiyā saṅghena mūlāya paṭikassanāraho kato hoti sā āpatti na āpajjitabbā, aññā vā tādisikā, tato vā pāpiṭṭhatarā; kammaṃ na garahitabbaṃ, kammikā na garahitabbā. Na pakatattassa bhikkhuno uposatho ṭhapetabbo, na pavāraṇā ṭhapetabbā, na savacanīyaṃ kātabbaṃ, na anuvādo paṭṭhapetabbo, na okāso kāretabbo, na codetabbo, na sāretabbo, na bhikkhūhi sampayojetabbaṃ.

He should not give higher ordination, nor should he give dependence, nor should he attend to a novice, nor should he accept the appointment as an instructor of nuns, and even if appointed, he should not instruct the nuns. The offense for which he was made liable to reversion to the beginning by the Sangha should not be committed, nor any other similar offense, nor one more blameworthy than that. The formal act should not be disparaged, nor those who performed it. He should not suspend the Uposatha of a monk in good standing, nor the Pavāraṇā, nor should he make a declaration, nor should he initiate an accusation, nor should he make an opportunity, nor should he accuse, nor should he remind, nor should he associate with monks.

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, mūlāyapaṭikassanārahena bhikkhunā pakatattassa bhikkhuno purato gantabbaṃ, na purato nisīditabbaṃ. Yo hoti saṅghassa āsanapariyanto seyyāpariyanto vihārapariyanto so tassa padātabbo. Tena ca so sāditabbo.

“Monks, a monk liable to reversion to the beginning should not walk in front of a monk in good standing, nor sit in front of him. Whatever is the last seat, the last bed, the last lodging of the Sangha, that should be assigned to him. And he should be satisfied with it.

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, mūlāyapaṭikassanārahena bhikkhunā pakatattena bhikkhunā puresamaṇena vā pacchāsamaṇena vā kulāni upasaṅkamitabbāni, na āraññikaṅgaṃ samādātabbaṃ, na piṇḍapātikaṅgaṃ samādātabbaṃ, na ca tappaccayā piṇḍapāto nīharāpetabbo – mā maṃ jāniṃsūti.

“Monks, a monk liable to reversion to the beginning should not visit families accompanied by a monk in good standing, whether walking in front or walking behind. He should not undertake the wilderness-dweller’s observance. He should not undertake the alms-food observance. And on that account, he should not have alms-food brought out, thinking, ‘Let them not know me.’

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, mūlāyapaṭikassanārahena bhikkhunā sabhikkhukā āvāsā abhikkhuko āvāso gantabbo, aññatra pakatattena, aññatra antarāyā.

“Monks, a monk liable to reversion to the beginning should not go from a residence with monks to a residence without monks, except accompanied by a monk in good standing, except in case of danger.

88.At that time, monks undergoing mānatta accepted from fully reinstated monks the following: bowing down, rising up for them, raising hands in respect, proper service, offering seats, offering beds, water for washing feet, footstools, foot-scrapers, receiving bowls and robes, and massaging the back during bathing. Those monks who were modest … complained and criticized: “How can monks undergoing mānatta accept from fully reinstated monks bowing down, rising up, raising hands in respect, proper service, offering seats, offering beds, water for washing feet, footstools, foot-scrapers, receiving bowls and robes, and massaging the back during bathing?” Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Is it true, monks, that those undergoing mānatta accept from fully reinstated monks bowing down, rising up … massaging the back during bathing?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One rebuked them, saying: “This is unseemly … How can monks undergoing mānatta accept from fully reinstated monks bowing down, rising up … massaging the back during bathing? Monks, this is not for the confidence of the unconfident …” After rebuking them … he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: “Monks, a monk undergoing mānatta should not accept from fully reinstated monks bowing down, rising up … massaging the back during bathing. Whoever accepts incurs an offense of wrong doing. I allow, monks, monks undergoing mānatta to exchange among themselves, according to seniority, bowing down, rising up … massaging the back during bathing. I allow, monks, monks undergoing mānatta five things according to seniority: Uposatha, Pavāraṇā, the rains-cloth, distributions, and meals. Therefore, monks, I will lay down the observance for monks undergoing mānatta, how monks undergoing mānatta should behave.

89. ‘‘Mānattārahena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā sammā vattitabbaṃ. Tatrāyaṃ sammāvattanā –

89.“Monks, a monk undergoing mānatta should behave properly. Herein is this proper behavior:

Na upasampādetabbaṃ…pe… (yathā mūlāya paṭikassanā, tathā vitthāretabbaṃ.) Na bhikkhūhi sampayojetabbaṃ.

He should not give ordination… (This should be expanded as in the case of revocation to the beginning.) He should not associate with monks.

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, mānattārahena bhikkhunā pakatattassa bhikkhuno purato gantabbaṃ, na purato nisīditabbaṃ. Yo hoti saṅghassa āsanapariyanto seyyāpariyanto vihārapariyanto so tassa padātabbo. Tena ca so sāditabbo.

“Monks, a monk undergoing mānatta should not walk in front of a fully reinstated monk, nor sit in front of him. Whatever is the Saṅgha’s appointed limit for seats, beds, or dwellings, that should be given to him, and he should be satisfied with it.

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, mānattārahena bhikkhunā pakatattena bhikkhunā puresamaṇena vā pacchāsamaṇena vā kulāni upasaṅkamitabbāni, na āraññikaṅgaṃ samādātabbaṃ, na piṇḍapātikaṅgaṃ samādātabbaṃ, na ca tappaccayā piṇḍapāto nīharāpetabbo – mā maṃ jāniṃsūti.

90. Tena kho pana samayena mānattacārikā bhikkhū sādiyanti pakatattānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ, añjalikammaṃ, sāmīcikammaṃ, āsanābhihāraṃ, seyyābhihāraṃ, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ, pādakathalikaṃ, pattacīvarapaṭiggahaṇaṃ, nahāne piṭṭhiparikammaṃ. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma mānattacārikā bhikkhū sādiyissanti pakatattānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ…pe… nahāne piṭṭhiparikamma’’nti! Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ.

90.Now at that time, monks undergoing probation were accepting from ordinary monks salutation, rising up, the añjali gesture, proper service, offering a seat, offering a bed, water for washing the feet, a footstool, a foot-scraper, receiving bowls and robes, and back-rubbing during bathing. Those monks who were modest…criticized, complained, and spread it about: “How can monks undergoing probation accept from ordinary monks salutation, rising up…back-rubbing during bathing?” Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One.

Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā bhikkhū paṭipucchi – ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, mānattacārikā bhikkhū sādiyanti pakatattānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ…pe… nahāne piṭṭhiparikamma’’nti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā – ‘‘ananucchavikaṃ…pe… kathañhi nāma, bhikkhave, mānattacārikā bhikkhū sādiyissanti pakatattānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ abhivādanaṃ…pe… nahāne piṭṭhiparikammaṃ! Netaṃ, bhikkhave, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi –

Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, in this connection, having assembled the Bhikkhu Saṅgha, asked the bhikkhus: “Is it true, bhikkhus, that monks undergoing probation accept from ordinary monks salutation, rising up…back-rubbing during bathing?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One, the Buddha, rebuked them: “It is unsuitable…How can monks undergoing probation accept from ordinary monks salutation…back-rubbing during bathing! This, bhikkhus, does not lead to the confidence of the unconfident…Having rebuked them…and given a Dhamma talk, he addressed the bhikkhus:

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, mānattacārikena bhikkhunā sāditabbaṃ pakatattānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ, añjalikammaṃ, sāmīcikammaṃ, āsanābhihāro, seyyābhihāro, pādodakaṃ pādapīṭhaṃ, pādakathalikaṃ, pattacīvarapaṭiggahaṇaṃ, nahāne piṭṭhiparikammaṃ. Yo sādiyeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, mānattacārikānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ mithu yathāvuḍḍhaṃ abhivādanaṃ, paccuṭṭhānaṃ…pe… nahāne piṭṭhiparikammaṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, mānattacārikānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ pañca yathāvuḍḍhaṃ – uposathaṃ, pavāraṇaṃ, vassikasāṭikaṃ, oṇojanaṃ, bhattaṃ. Tena hi, bhikkhave, mānattacārikānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ vattaṃ paññapessāmi yathā mānattacārikehi bhikkhūhi vattitabbaṃ.

“Bhikkhus, a monk undergoing probation should not accept from ordinary monks salutation, rising up, the añjali gesture, proper service, offering a seat, offering a bed, water for washing the feet, a footstool, a foot-scraper, receiving bowls and robes, or back-rubbing during bathing. Whoever accepts these incurs an offence of wrong-doing. I allow, bhikkhus, that monks undergoing probation may mutually perform salutation, rising up…back-rubbing during bathing according to seniority. I allow, bhikkhus, that monks undergoing probation may receive five things according to seniority: the Uposatha, the Pavāraṇā, the rains-cloth, food portions, and meals. Therefore, bhikkhus, I will prescribe the duties for monks undergoing probation, how monks undergoing probation should conduct themselves.

 91. ‘‘Mānattacārikena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā sammā vattitabbaṃ. Tatrāyaṃ sammāvattanā –

91.“Bhikkhus, a monk undergoing probation should conduct himself properly. And this is the proper conduct:

Na upasampādetabbaṃ, na nissayo dātabbo, na sāmaṇero upaṭṭhāpetabbo, na bhikkhunovādakasammuti sāditabbā, sammatenapi bhikkhuniyo na ovaditabbā. Yāya āpattiyā saṅghena mānattaṃ dinnaṃ hoti sā āpatti na āpajjitabbā, aññā vā tādisikā, tato vā pāpiṭṭhatarā; kammaṃ na garahitabbaṃ, kammikā na garahitabbā. Na pakatattassa bhikkhuno uposatho ṭhapetabbo, na pavāraṇā ṭhapetabbā, na savacanīyaṃ kātabbaṃ, na anuvādo paṭṭhapetabbo, na okāso kāretabbo, na codetabbo, na sāretabbo, na bhikkhūhi sampayojetabbaṃ.

He should not give the higher ordination, he should not give dependence, he should not have a novice attend on him, he should not accept appointment as an instructor of bhikkhunīs; even if appointed, he should not instruct bhikkhunīs. He should not commit the offence for which the Saṅgha has given him probation, nor another similar to it, nor one more serious than it; he should not criticize the act, nor those who performed it. He should not prevent an ordinary monk from observing the Uposatha, nor from performing the Pavāraṇā, he should not make a formal statement, he should not initiate a charge, he should not demand an opportunity, he should not admonish, he should not remind, he should not associate with bhikkhus.

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, mānattacārikena bhikkhunā pakatattassa bhikkhuno purato gantabbaṃ, na purato nisīditabbaṃ. Yo hoti saṅghassa āsanapariyanto seyyāpariyanto vihārapariyanto so tassa padātabbo. Tena ca so sāditabbo.

“Bhikkhus, a monk undergoing probation should not go in front of an ordinary monk, nor sit in front of him. Whatever is the Saṅgha’s boundary for seats, beds, or dwellings, that should be given to him. And he should accept it.

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, mānattacārikena bhikkhunā pakatattena bhikkhunā puresamaṇena vā pacchāsamaṇena vā kulāni upasaṅkamitabbāni, na āraññikaṅgaṃ samādātabbaṃ, na piṇḍapātikaṅgaṃ samādātabbaṃ, na ca tappaccayā piṇḍapāto nīharāpetabbo – mā maṃ jāniṃsūti.

“Bhikkhus, a monk undergoing probation should not visit families with an ordinary monk, either walking in front or walking behind. He should not undertake the wilderness-dweller’s ascetic practice, he should not undertake the alms-food eater’s ascetic practice, nor should he have alms-food brought out on that account—thinking, ‘Let them not know about me.’

‘‘Mānattacārikena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā āgantukena ārocetabbaṃ, āgantukassa ārocetabbaṃ, uposathe ārocetabbaṃ, pavāraṇāya ārocetabbaṃ, devasikaṃ ārocetabbaṃ. Sace gilāno hoti, dūtenapi ārocetabbaṃ.

“Bhikkhus, a monk undergoing probation should inform the incoming monks, he should inform the resident monks, he should inform on the Uposatha, he should inform on the Pavāraṇā, he should inform daily. If he is sick, he should inform even through a messenger.

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, mānattacārikena bhikkhunā sabhikkhukā āvāsā abhikkhuko āvāso gantabbo, aññatra saṅghena, aññatra antarāyā.

“Bhikkhus, a monk undergoing probation should not go from a residence with bhikkhus to a residence without bhikkhus, except with the Saṅgha’s consent, or if there is an obstacle.

“Bhikkhus, a monk undergoing probation should not dwell in the same covered dwelling as an ordinary monk, nor in the same uncovered place, nor in the same covered dwelling or uncovered place. Upon seeing an ordinary monk, he should rise from his seat. An ordinary monk should be invited to a seat. One should not sit on the same seat as an ordinary monk, nor, when the ordinary monk is sitting on a low seat, should one sit on a high seat, nor, when the ordinary monk is sitting on the ground, should one sit on a seat; one should not walk on the same walking path, nor, when the ordinary monk is walking on a low walking path, should one walk on a high walking path, nor, when the ordinary monk is walking on the ground, should one walk on a walking path.

“Bhikkhus, a monk undergoing probation should not dwell in the same covered dwelling with a monk undergoing probation… with a monk liable to be sent back to the beginning… with a monk liable to probation… with a senior monk undergoing probation… with a monk liable to rehabilitation.

“Bhikkhus, if a fourth monk undergoing probation should give probation, send back to the beginning, give probation, or rehabilitate, it is not an act, and it should not be done.”

92. Atha kho āyasmā upāli yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā upāli bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kati nu kho, bhante, mānattacārikassa bhikkhuno ratticchedā’’ti? ‘‘Cattāro kho, upāli, mānattacārikassa bhikkhuno ratticchedā. Sahavāso, vippavāso, anārocanā, ūne gaṇe caraṇaṃ [caraṇanti (ka.)] – ime kho, upāli, cattāro mānattacārikassa bhikkhuno ratticchedā’’ti.

92.Then the Venerable Upāli approached the Blessed One, paid homage to the Blessed One, and sat down to one side. As he was sitting to one side, the Venerable Upāli said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, how many interruptions of nights are there for a monk undergoing probation?” “Upāli, there are four interruptions of nights for a monk undergoing probation: dwelling together (sahavāso), dwelling apart (vippavāso), not informing (anārocanā), and wandering in an incomplete company (ūne gaṇe caraṇaṃ). These, Upāli, are the four interruptions of nights for a monk undergoing probation.”

93. Tena kho pana samayena sāvatthiyaṃ mahābhikkhusaṅgho sannipatito hoti. Na sakkonti mānattacārikā bhikkhū mānattaṃ sodhetuṃ.

Nikkhittaṃ hoti mānattaṃ. ‘Vattaṃ nikkhipāmī’ti. Nikkhittaṃ hoti mānatta’’nti.

93.At that time, a large Bhikkhu Saṅgha had gathered in Sāvatthī. The monks undergoing probation were unable to complete their probation. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, I allow the probation to be laid aside. And, bhikkhus, it should be laid aside thus: The monk undergoing probation should approach one monk, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, sit squatting, raise his joined palms, and say: ‘I lay aside the probation.’ The probation is laid aside. ‘I lay aside the duties.’ The probation is laid aside.”

94. Tena kho pana samayena sāvatthiyā bhikkhū tahaṃ tahaṃ pakkamiṃsu. Sakkonti mānattacārikā bhikkhū mānattaṃ sodhetuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, mānattaṃ samādiyituṃ.

Samādinnaṃ hoti mānattaṃ. ‘Vattaṃ samādiyāmī’ti. Samādinnaṃ hoti mānatta’’nti.

94.At that time, the bhikkhus in Sāvatthī dispersed to various places. The bhikkhus undergoing the mānatta were able to purify their mānatta. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, I allow the undertaking of the mānatta. And, bhikkhus, it should be undertaken thus: That bhikkhu undergoing the mānatta should approach one bhikkhu, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, squat, raise his clasped hands, and say: ‘I undertake the mānatta.’ Thus the mānatta is undertaken. ‘I undertake the duties.’ Thus the mānatta is undertaken.”

95.At that time, bhikkhus deserving rehabilitation accepted the homage of bhikkhus of restored standing—rising to greet them… and back-rubbing during bathing. Those bhikkhus who were modest… complained, grumbled, and criticized them, saying, “How can bhikkhus deserving rehabilitation accept the homage of bhikkhus of restored standing—rising to greet them… and back-rubbing during bathing?” Then those bhikkhus reported this matter to the Blessed One.

Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṃ sannipātāpetvā bhikkhū paṭipucchi – ‘‘saccaṃ kira, bhikkhave, abbhānārahā bhikkhū sādiyanti pakatattānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ abhivādanaṃ paccuṭṭhānaṃ…pe… nahāne piṭṭhiparikammanti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti. Vigarahi buddho bhagavā – ‘‘ananucchavikaṃ…pe… kathañhi nāma, bhikkhave, abbhānārahā bhikkhū sādiyissanti pakatattānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ abhivādanaṃ paccuṭṭhānaṃ…pe… nahāne piṭṭhiparikammaṃ! Netaṃ, bhikkhave, appasannānaṃ vā pasādāya…pe… vigarahitvā…pe… dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, abbhānārahena bhikkhunā sāditabbaṃ pakatattānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ abhivādanaṃ paccupaṭṭhānaṃ…pe… nahāne piṭṭhiparikammaṃ. Yo sādiyeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, abbhānārahānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ mithu yathāvuḍḍhaṃ abhivādanaṃ paccuṭṭhānaṃ…pe… nahāne piṭṭhiparikammaṃ. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, abbhānārahānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ pañca yathāvuḍḍhaṃ – uposathaṃ, pavāraṇaṃ, vassikasāṭikaṃ, oṇojanaṃ, bhattaṃ. Tena hi, bhikkhave, abbhānārahānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ vattaṃ paññāpessāmi yathā abbhānārahehi bhikkhūhi vattitabbaṃ.

Then the Blessed One, regarding this incident, on this occasion, having convened the Sangha of bhikkhus, questioned the bhikkhus: “Is it true, bhikkhus, that bhikkhus deserving rehabilitation accept the homage of bhikkhus of restored standing—rising to greet them… and back-rubbing during bathing?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked them: “This is unsuitable… How, bhikkhus, can bhikkhus deserving rehabilitation accept the homage of bhikkhus of restored standing—rising to greet them… and back-rubbing during bathing! This, bhikkhus, is not for the confidence of the unconfident… Having rebuked them… having given a Dhamma talk, he addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu deserving rehabilitation should not accept the homage of bhikkhus of restored standing, rising to greet them… or back-rubbing during bathing. Whoever accepts, incurs an offense of wrong-doing. Bhikkhus, I allow bhikkhus deserving rehabilitation to mutually give homage, rise to greet one another… and back-rubbing during bathing according to seniority. Bhikkhus, I allow five things for bhikkhus deserving rehabilitation according to seniority: the Uposatha, the Pavāraṇā, the rains-bathing cloth, the distribution of requisites, and meals. Therefore, bhikkhus, I will prescribe the duties for bhikkhus deserving rehabilitation—how bhikkhus deserving rehabilitation should conduct themselves.”

96. ‘‘Abbhānārahena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā sammā vattitabbaṃ. Tatrāyaṃ sammāvattanā –

96.Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu deserving rehabilitation should conduct himself properly. Herein is the proper conduct:

Na upasampādetabbaṃ…pe… (yathā heṭṭhā, tathā vitthāretabbaṃ,) na bhikkhūhi sampayojetabbaṃ.

He should not give ordination… (as explained in detail below,) he should not associate with bhikkhus.

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, abbhānārahena bhikkhunā pakatattassa bhikkhuno purato gantabbaṃ, na purato nisīditabbaṃ. Yo hoti saṅghassa āsanapariyanto seyyāpariyanto vihārapariyanto so tassa padātabbo. Tena ca so sāditabbo.

Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu deserving rehabilitation should not walk in front of a bhikkhu of restored standing, nor sit in front of him. Whatever is the Sangha’s last seat, last bed, or last dwelling, that should be given to him. And he should accept it.

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, abbhānārahena bhikkhunā pakatattena bhikkhunā puresamaṇena vā pacchāsamaṇena vā kulāni upasaṅkamitabbāni; na āraññikaṅgaṃ samādātabbaṃ; na piṇḍapātikaṅgaṃ samādātabbaṃ; na ca tappaccayā piṇḍapāto nīharāpetabbo – mā maṃ jāniṃsūti.

Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu deserving rehabilitation should not visit families accompanied by a bhikkhu of restored standing, whether as a front-attendant or a rear-attendant. He should not undertake the wilderness-dweller’s ascetic practice. He should not undertake the alms-gatherer’s ascetic practice. And he should not have almsfood brought out on his account, thinking, ‘Let them not know me.’

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, abbhānārahena bhikkhunā sabhikkhukā āvāsā abhikkhuko āvāso gantabbo, aññatra pakatattena, aññatra antarāyā.

Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu deserving rehabilitation should not go from a residence with bhikkhus to a residence without bhikkhus, except with a bhikkhu of restored standing, except in case of danger.

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, abbhānārahena bhikkhunā sabhikkhukā āvāsā abhikkhuko anāvāso gantabbo, aññatra pakatattena, aññatra antarāyā…pe…. (Yathā heṭṭhā, tathā vitthāretabbā.)

Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu deserving rehabilitation should not go from a residence with bhikkhus to a non-residence without bhikkhus, except with a bhikkhu of restored standing, except in case of danger… (As below, so it should be expanded.)

‘‘Gantabbo, bhikkhave, abbhānārahena bhikkhunā sabhikkhukā āvāsā…pe… anāvāsā…pe… āvāsā vā anāvāsā vā sabhikkhuko āvāso…pe… sabhikkhuko anāvāso…pe… sabhikkhuko āvāso vā anāvāso vā, yatthassu bhikkhū samānasaṃvāsakā, yaṃ jaññā sakkomi ajjeva gantunti.

Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu deserving rehabilitation should go to a residence with bhikkhus… to a non-residence… to a residence or a non-residence… to a residence with bhikkhus… to a non-residence with bhikkhus… to a residence or a non-residence with bhikkhus, where there are bhikkhus of the same communion, thinking, ‘I know I can go there today.’

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, abbhānārahena bhikkhunā pakatattena bhikkhunā saddhiṃ ekacchanne āvāse vatthabbaṃ, na ekacchanne anāvāse vatthabbaṃ, na ekacchanne āvāse vā anāvāse vā vatthabbaṃ; pakatattaṃ bhikkhuṃ disvā āsanā vuṭṭhātabbaṃ, pakatatto bhikkhu āsanena nimantetabbo; na pakatattena bhikkhunā saddhiṃ ekāsane nisīditabbaṃ, na nīce āsane nisinne ucce āsane nisīditabbaṃ, na chamāyaṃ nisinne āsane nisīditabbaṃ; na ekacaṅkame caṅkamitabbaṃ, na nīce caṅkame caṅkamante ucce caṅkame caṅkamitabbaṃ, na chamāyaṃ caṅkamante caṅkame caṅkamitabbaṃ.

Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu deserving rehabilitation should not dwell under the same roof with a bhikkhu of restored standing, nor dwell in an open space under the same roof, nor dwell in a dwelling or an open space under the same roof. Upon seeing a bhikkhu of restored standing, he should rise from his seat. The bhikkhu of restored standing should be invited to a seat. He should not sit on the same seat with a bhikkhu of restored standing, nor should he sit on a higher seat while a bhikkhu of restored standing sits on a lower one, nor should he sit on a seat while a bhikkhu of restored standing sits on the ground. He should not walk on the same walking path with a bhikkhu of restored standing, nor should he walk on a higher walking path while a bhikkhu of restored standing walks on a lower one, nor should he walk on a walking path while a bhikkhu of restored standing walks on the ground.

‘‘Na, bhikkhave, abbhānārahena bhikkhunā pārivāsikena bhikkhunā saddhiṃ…pe… mūlāyapaṭikassanārahena bhikkhunā saddhiṃ…pe… mānattārahena bhikkhunā saddhiṃ…pe… mānattacārikena bhikkhunā saddhiṃ…pe… abbhānārahena vuḍḍhatarena bhikkhunā saddhiṃ ekacchanne āvāse vatthabbaṃ, na ekacchanne anāvāse vatthabbaṃ; na ekacchanne āvāse vā anāvāse vā vatthabbaṃ; na ekāsane nisīditabbaṃ, na nīce āsane nisinne ucce āsane nisīditabbaṃ, na chamāyaṃ nisinne āsane nisīditabbaṃ; na ekacaṅkame caṅkamitabbaṃ, na nīce caṅkame caṅkamante ucce caṅkame caṅkamitabbaṃ, na chamāyaṃ caṅkamante caṅkame caṅkamitabbaṃ.

Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu deserving rehabilitation should not dwell under the same roof with a bhikkhu on probation… nor with a bhikkhu deserving to be sent back to the beginning… nor with a bhikkhu deserving the mānatta… nor with a bhikkhu undergoing the mānatta… nor with a senior bhikkhu deserving rehabilitation. He should not dwell in an open space under the same roof, nor dwell in a dwelling or an open space under the same roof. He should not sit on the same seat, nor should he sit on a higher seat while they sit on a lower one, nor should he sit on a seat while they sit on the ground. He should not walk on the same walking path, nor should he walk on a higher walking path while they walk on a lower one, nor should he walk on a walking path while they walk on the ground.

[mahāva. 393] ‘‘Abbhānārahacatuttho ce, bhikkhave, parivāsaṃ dadeyya, mūlāya paṭikasseyya, mānattaṃ dadeyya, taṃvīso abbheyya, akammaṃ, na ca karaṇīya’’nti.

Bhikkhus, if a fourth bhikkhu deserving rehabilitation grants probation, sends back to the beginning, grants the mānatta, or rehabilitates him, that is not a valid act, and it should not be done.”

Abbhānārahavattaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ.

The section on the duties of one deserving rehabilitation is finished.

Pārivāsikakkhandhako dutiyo.

The second chapter on Probation is concluded.

Imamhi khandhake vatthū pañca.

In this chapter, there are five cases.

Tassuddānaṃ –

Its summary:

Pārivāsikā sādenti, pakatattāna bhikkhunaṃ;Abhivādanaṃ paccuṭṭhānaṃ, añjaliñca sāmīciyaṃ.

Probationers accept from bhikkhus of restored standing: homage, rising to greet them, and proper clasped hands.

Āsanaṃ seyyābhihāraṃ, pādo pīṭhaṃ kathalikaṃ;Pattaṃ nahāne parikammaṃ, ujjhāyanti ca pesalā.

Seats, bedding, footstools, stools, and mats; bowls, and back-rubbing during bathing—and the modest complain.

Dukkaṭaṃ sādiyantassa, mithu pañca yathāvuḍḍhaṃ [punāpare (ka.)];Uposathaṃ pavāraṇaṃ, vassikoṇojabhojanaṃ.

A wrong-doing for one who accepts; five things mutually according to seniority: the Uposatha, the Pavāraṇā, the rains-bathing cloth, the distribution of requisites, and meals.

Sammā ca vattanā tattha, pakatattassa gacchantaṃ;Yo ca hoti pariyanto, pure pacchā tatheva ca [na pure pacchāsamaṇena (sī. syā.)].

And proper conduct there, for one going with a bhikkhu of restored standing; and whatever is the last seat, before and after, just so.

Āraññapiṇḍanīhāro, āgantuke uposathe;Pavāraṇāya dūtena, gantabbo ca sabhikkhuko.

The wilderness-dweller, the alms-gatherer, the bringing out of food; the newcomer, on the Uposatha; by a messenger for the Pavāraṇā, and he should go with bhikkhus.

Ekacchanne ca vuṭṭhānaṃ, tatheva ca nimantaye;Āsane nīce caṅkame, chamāyaṃ caṅkamena ca.

And under one roof, rising up, and likewise inviting; on a seat, on a low walking path, and on a walking path on the ground.

Vuḍḍhatarena akammaṃ, ratticchedā ca sodhanā;Nikkhipanaṃ samādānaṃ, vattaṃva pārivāsike [ratti vā pārivāsike (ka.), ñātabbaṃ pārivāsikā (sī. syā.)].

With a senior, it is not a valid act, and the purification of the night-severance; the laying aside, the undertaking, and the duties for those on probation.

Mūlāya mānattārahā, tathā mānattacārikā;Abbhānārahe nayo cāpi, sambhedaṃ nayato [sambhedanayato (syā.)] puna.

Those deserving to be sent back to the beginning, and those undergoing the mānatta; and the method for those deserving rehabilitation, and also the method for schism again.

Pārivāsikesu tayo, catu mānattacārike;Na samenti ratticchedesu [ratticchede (itipi), ratticchedā (syā.)], mānattesu ca devasi;Dve kammā sadisā sesā, tayo kammā samāsamāti [samā matāti (sī.)].

Three for those on probation, four for those undergoing the mānatta; they do not agree on the night-severances, and on the mānatta by day; two acts are similar, the remaining three acts are equal.
