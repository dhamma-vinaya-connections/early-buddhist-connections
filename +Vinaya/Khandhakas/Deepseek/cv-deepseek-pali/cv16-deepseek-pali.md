294. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā rājagahe viharati veḷuvane kalandakanivāpe. Tena kho pana samayena bhagavatā bhikkhūnaṃ senāsanaṃ apaññattaṃ hoti. Te ca bhikkhū tahaṃ tahaṃ viharanti – araññe, rukkhamūle, pabbate, kandarāyaṃ, giriguhāyaṃ, susāne, vanapatthe, ajjhokāse, palālapuñje. Te kālasseva tato tato upanikkhamanti – araññā rukkhamūlā pabbatā kandarā giriguhā susānā vanapatthā ajjhokāsā palālapuñjā, pāsādikena abhikkantena paṭikkantena, ālokitena vilokitena, samiñjitena pasāritena, okkhittacakkhū, iriyāpathasampannā. Tena kho pana samayena rājagahako seṭṭhī [seṭṭhi (ka.)] kālasseva uyyānaṃ agamāsi. Addasā kho rājagahako seṭṭhī te bhikkhū kālasseva tato tato upanikkhamante – araññā rukkhamūlā pabbatā kandarā giriguhā susānā vanapatthā ajjhokāsā palālapuñjā, pāsādikena abhikkantena paṭikkantena, ālokitena vilokitena, samiñjitena pasāritena, okkhittacakkhū, iriyāpathasampanne. Disvānassa cittaṃ pasīdi. Atha kho rājagahako seṭṭhī yena te bhikkhū tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā te bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘sacāhaṃ, bhante, vihāre kārāpeyyaṃ, vaseyyātha me vihāresū’’ti? ‘‘Na kho, gahapati, bhagavatā vihārā anuññātā’’ti. ‘‘Tena hi, bhante, bhagavantaṃ paṭipucchitvā mama āroceyyāthā’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ gahapatī’’ti kho te bhikkhū rājagahakassa seṭṭhissa paṭissutvā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu. Ekamantaṃ nisinnā kho te bhikkhū bhagavantaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘rājagahako, bhante, seṭṭhī vihāre kārāpetukāmo. Kathaṃ nu kho, bhante, amhehi [bhante (sī. ka.)] paṭipajjitabba’’nti? Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, pañca leṇāni [pañca senāsanāni (syā.)] – vihāraṃ, aḍḍhayogaṃ, pāsādaṃ, hammiyaṃ, guha’’nti.

294.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Feeding Ground. Now at that time dwellings for the monks had not yet been allowed by the Blessed One. Those monks lived here and there—in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, on a mountain, in a ravine, in a cave, in a charnel ground, in a forest thicket, in the open air, or on a heap of straw. Early in the morning they would emerge from these places—from the wilderness, from the foot of a tree, from the mountain, from the ravine, from the cave, from the charnel ground, from the forest thicket, from the open air, or from the heap of straw—composed in their going out and coming back, in looking ahead and looking aside, in bending and stretching, with downcast eyes and perfect deportment. At that time, the Rajagaha merchant went to the park early in the morning. He saw those monks emerging early in the morning from those places—from the wilderness, from the foot of a tree, from the mountain, from the ravine, from the cave, from the charnel ground, from the forest thicket, from the open air, or from the heap of straw—composed in their going out and coming back, in looking ahead and looking aside, in bending and stretching, with downcast eyes and perfect deportment. Seeing them, his mind was pleased. Then the Rajagaha merchant approached those monks and said to them, “Venerable sirs, if I were to have dwellings built, would you stay in my dwellings?” “Householder, dwellings have not yet been allowed by the Blessed One.” “Then, venerable sirs, please ask the Blessed One and inform me.” “Yes, householder,” those monks replied to the Rajagaha merchant. Then they approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. As they sat to one side, those monks said to the Blessed One, “Venerable sir, the Rajagaha merchant wishes to have dwellings built. How should we proceed?” Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow five kinds of dwellings: a dwelling, a garuda-winged house, a mansion, a turreted house, and a cave.”

Atha kho te bhikkhū yena rājagahako seṭṭhī tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā rājagahakaṃ seṭṭhiṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘anuññātā kho, gahapati, bhagavatā vihārā; yassadāni kālaṃ maññasī’’ti. Atha kho rājagahako seṭṭhī ekāheneva saṭṭhivihāre patiṭṭhāpesi. Atha kho rājagahako seṭṭhī te saṭṭhivihāre pariyosāpetvā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho rājagahako seṭṭhī bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘adhivāsetu me, bhante, bhagavā svātanāya bhattaṃ saddhiṃ bhikkhusaṅghenā’’ti. Adhivāsesi bhagavā tuṇhībhāvena. Atha kho rājagahako seṭṭhī bhagavato adhivāsanaṃ viditvā uṭṭhāyāsanā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṃ katvā pakkāmi.

Then those monks approached the Rajagaha merchant, and upon approaching, said to the Rajagaha merchant: “Householder, dwellings have been allowed by the Blessed One; now you may do as you deem fit.” Then the Rajagaha merchant had sixty dwellings built in a single day. Then the Rajagaha merchant, having completed the sixty dwellings, approached the Blessed One, and upon approaching, paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. As he sat to one side, the Rajagaha merchant said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, may the Blessed One consent to a meal from me tomorrow, together with the Bhikkhu Saṅgha.” The Blessed One consented by silence. Then the Rajagaha merchant, knowing of the Blessed One's consent, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, keeping him on his right, and departed.

Atha kho rājagahako seṭṭhī tassā rattiyā accayena paṇītaṃ khādanīyaṃ bhojanīyaṃ paṭiyādāpetvā bhagavato kālaṃ ārocāpesi – ‘‘kālo, bhante, niṭṭhitaṃ bhatta’’nti. Atha kho bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena rājagahakassa seṭṭhissa nivesanaṃ tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi saddhiṃ bhikkhusaṅghena. Atha kho rājagahako seṭṭhī buddhappamukhaṃ bhikkhusaṅghaṃ paṇītena khādanīyena bhojanīyena sahatthā santappetvā sampavāretvā, bhagavantaṃ bhuttāviṃ onītapattapāṇiṃ, ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho rājagahako seṭṭhī bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘ete me, bhante, saṭṭhivihārā puññatthikena saggatthikena kārāpitā. Kathāhaṃ, bhante, tesu vihāresu paṭipajjāmī’’ti? ‘‘Tena hi tvaṃ, gahapati, te saṭṭhivihāre āgatānāgatassa cātuddisassa saṅghassa patiṭṭhāpehī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ bhante’’ti kho rājagahako seṭṭhī bhagavato paṭissutvā te saṭṭhivihāre āgatānāgatassa cātuddisassa saṅghassa patiṭṭhāpesi.

Then, when the night had passed, the Rajagaha merchant had fine hard and soft foods prepared and announced the time to the Blessed One: “It is time, venerable sir, the meal is ready.” Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe and went to the residence of the Rajagaha merchant. Having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Bhikkhu Saṅgha. Then the Rajagaha merchant personally served and satisfied the Bhikkhu Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with fine hard and soft foods. When the Blessed One had finished eating and had removed his hand from the bowl, the merchant sat down to one side. As he sat to one side, the Rajagaha merchant said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, these sixty dwellings were built by me, seeking merit and aiming for heaven. How should I proceed with these dwellings, venerable sir?” “Then, householder, you should dedicate these sixty dwellings to the Saṅgha of the four quarters, those who have come and those who will come.” “Yes, venerable sir,” replied the Rajagaha merchant to the Blessed One, and he dedicated those sixty dwellings to the Saṅgha of the four quarters, those who have come and those who will come.

295. Atha kho bhagavā rājagahakaṃ seṭṭhiṃ imāhi gāthāhi anumodi –

295.Then the Blessed One expressed his appreciation to the Rajagaha merchant with these verses:

‘‘Sītaṃ uṇhaṃ paṭihanti [paṭihanati (ka.)], tato vāḷamigāni ca;Sarīsape ca makase, sisire cāpi vuṭṭhiyo.

“They ward off cold and heat, and also wild beasts; And creeping things and mosquitoes, and also biting winds and rains in the cold season.

‘‘Tato vātātapo ghore, sañjāto [vātātape ghore, sañjāte (ka. saddanīti)] paṭihaññati;Leṇatthañca sukhatthañca, jhāyituñca vipassituṃ.

Then fierce winds and scorching heat that arise are warded off; For shelter and for comfort, for meditating and contemplating.

‘‘Vihāradānaṃ saṅghassa, aggaṃ buddhena [buddhehi (syā.)] vaṇṇitaṃ;Tasmā hi paṇḍito, poso sampassaṃ atthamattano.

The gift of a dwelling to the Saṅgha is praised by the Buddha as foremost; Therefore, a wise person, seeing his own benefit—

‘‘Vihāre kāraye ramme, vāsayettha bahussute;Tesaṃ annañca pānañca, vatthasenāsanāni ca;Dadeyya ujubhūtesu, vippasannena cetasā.

Let one build delightful dwellings, and house the learned ones there; To them, give food and drink, clothing, and lodgings; He should give to the upright ones with a mind fully purified.

‘‘Te tassa dhammaṃ desenti, sabbadukkhāpanūdanaṃ;Yaṃ so dhammaṃ idhaññāya, parinibbāti anāsavo’’ti.

They teach him the Dhamma, which removes all suffering; Having understood that Dhamma here, he attains final Nibbāna, taintless.”

Atha kho bhagavā rājagahakaṃ seṭṭhiṃ imāhi gāthāhi anumoditvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkāmi.

Then the Blessed One, having expressed his appreciation to the Rajagaha merchant with these verses, rose from his seat and departed.

296. Assosuṃ kho manussā – ‘‘bhagavatā kira vihārā anuññātā’’ti sakkaccaṃ [te sakkaccaṃ (syā. kaṃ.)] vihāre kārāpenti. Te vihārā akavāṭakā honti; ahīpi vicchikāpi satapadiyopi pavisanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, kavāṭa’’nti. Bhittichiddaṃ karitvā valliyāpi rajjuyāpi kavāṭaṃ bandhanti. Undūrehipi upacikāhipi khajjanti. Khayitabandhanāni kavāṭāni patanti.

296.People heard, “It is said that the Blessed One has allowed dwellings,” so they carefully had dwellings built. Those dwellings had no doors; snakes, scorpions, and centipedes entered them. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, a door.” They made holes in the walls and tied the door with creepers or ropes. Rats and termites gnawed at them. The doors, with their fastenings gnawed through, fell down. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, a doorframe, a door socket, and an upper lintel.” The doors did not fit properly. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, a pull-hole and a pull-cord.” The doors did not close.

Yehi [yepi (sī. syā.)] te ugghāṭetvā pavisanti [visāṇatāḷaṃ, yehi te ugghāṭetvā pavisantīti (ka.)], vihārā aguttā honti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, yantakaṃ sūcika’’nti.

At that time, the monks were unable to open the doors. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, a keyhole. I allow three kinds of keys: a metal key, a wooden key, and a horn key.” Because people would enter by lifting these, the dwellings were unguarded. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, a bolt and a key.”

They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, window screens.” Through the gaps in the screens, bats and owls still entered. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, window doors and window blinds.”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū chamāyaṃ sayanti. Gattānipi cīvarānipi paṃsukitāni honti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, tiṇasanthāraka’’nti. Tiṇasanthārako undūrehipi upacikāhipi khajjati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, miḍḍhi’’nti [mīḍhanti (sī.), miḍhinti (syā.)]. Miḍḍhiyā gattāni dukkhā honti.

At that time, the bhikkhus were sleeping on the ground. Their bodies and robes became dusty.

They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, bhikkhus, a matting.” Their bodies felt discomfort on the matting. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, bhikkhus, a woven bed frame.”

Now at that time the wealthy merchant of Rājagaha had invited the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha for the next day's meal. Then the wealthy merchant of Rājagaha ordered his slaves and workers: "Well then, good sirs, rise early in the morning and prepare the rice gruel, prepare the meals, prepare the soups, prepare the side dishes." Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika thought: "Previously, when I arrived, this householder would set aside all his work and greet me personally. But now he seems distracted and orders his slaves and workers: 'Well then, good sirs, rise early in the morning and prepare the rice gruel, prepare the meals, prepare the soups, prepare the side dishes.' What could be the reason? Is there a betrothal or a wedding, or is a great sacrifice being prepared, or has King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha been invited for tomorrow along with his army?"

Atha kho rājagahako seṭṭhī dāse ca kammakāre ca āṇāpetvā yena anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā anāthapiṇḍikena gahapatinā saddhiṃ paṭisammoditvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho rājagahakaṃ seṭṭhiṃ anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati etadavoca – ‘‘pubbe kho tvaṃ, gahapati, mayi āgate sabbakiccāni nikkhipitvā mamaññeva saddhiṃ paṭisammodasi. Sodāni tvaṃ vikkhittarūpo dāse ca kammakāre ca āṇāpesi – ‘tena hi, bhaṇe, kālasseva uṭṭhāya yāguyo pacatha, bhattāni pacatha, sūpāni sampādetha, uttaribhaṅgāni sampādethā’ti. Kiṃ nu kho te, gahapati, āvāho vā bhavissati, vivāho vā bhavissati, mahāyañño vā paccupaṭṭhito, rājā vā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro nimantito svātanāya saddhiṃ balakāyenā’’ti? ‘‘Na me, gahapati, āvāho vā bhavissati, nāpi vivāho vā bhavissati, nāpi rājā vā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro nimantito svātanāya saddhiṃ balakāyena; api ca me mahāyañño paccupaṭṭhito; svātanāya buddhappamukho saṅgho nimantito’’ti. ‘‘Buddhoti tvaṃ, gahapati, vadesī’’ti? ‘‘Buddho tyāhaṃ, gahapati, vadāmī’’ti. ‘‘Buddhoti tvaṃ, gahapati, vadesī’’ti? ‘‘Buddho tyāhaṃ, gahapati, vadāmī’’ti. ‘‘Buddhoti tvaṃ, gahapati, vadesī’’ti? ‘‘Buddho tyāhaṃ, gahapati, vadāmī’’ti. ‘‘Ghosopi kho eso, gahapati, dullabho lokasmiṃ yadidaṃ – buddho buddhoti. Sakkā nu kho, gahapati, imaṃ kālaṃ taṃ bhagavantaṃ dassanāya upasaṅkamituṃ arahantaṃ sammāsambuddha’’nti? ‘‘Akālo kho, gahapati, imaṃ kālaṃ taṃ bhagavantaṃ dassanāya upasaṅkamituṃ arahantaṃ sammāsambuddhaṃ. Svedāni tvaṃ kālena taṃ bhagavantaṃ dassanāya upasaṅkamissasi arahantaṃ sammāsambuddha’’nti. Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati – svedānāhaṃ kālena taṃ bhagavantaṃ dassanāya upasaṅkamissāmi arahantaṃ sammāsambuddhanti – buddhagatāya satiyā nipajjitvā rattiyā sudaṃ tikkhattuṃ vuṭṭhāsi pabhātaṃ maññamāno.

Then the wealthy merchant of Rājagaha, having instructed his slaves and workers, approached the householder Anāthapiṇḍika. Having approached, he exchanged courteous greetings with the householder Anāthapiṇḍika and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the wealthy merchant of Rājagaha said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika: "Previously, householder, when I arrived, you would set aside all your duties and exchange courteous greetings with me alone. But now you seem distracted, instructing your slaves and workers: 'Come now, good sirs, rise early in the morning, cook the porridge, prepare the meals, make the soup, and arrange the extra dishes.' What is it, householder? Is there to be a wedding, or a marriage, or a great sacrifice being prepared, or has King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha been invited for tomorrow along with his army?" "Neither is there a wedding for me, householder, nor a marriage, nor has King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha been invited for tomorrow along with his army. But a great sacrifice is being prepared for me. Tomorrow, the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha has been invited." "Do you say 'Buddha,' householder?" "I say 'Buddha,' householder." "Do you say 'Buddha,' householder?" "I say 'Buddha,' householder." "Do you say 'Buddha,' householder?" "I say 'Buddha,' householder." "Even the sound of that, householder, is rare in the world—that is, 'Buddha, Buddha.' Is it possible now, householder, to go to see that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One?" "This is not the time, householder, to go now to see that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One. You may go at the proper time to see that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One." Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, thinking, "I will go at the proper time to see that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One," lay down with his mindfulness directed toward the Buddha. During the night, he got up three times, thinking it was dawn.

305. [saṃ. ni. 1.242] Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati yena sivakadvāraṃ [sīvadvāraṃ (sī.), sītavanadvāraṃ (syā.)] tenupasaṅkami. Amanussā dvāraṃ vivariṃsu.

Atha kho sivako [sīvako (sī. syā.)] yakkho antarahito saddamanussāvesi –

305.Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Sivaka Gate. Non-humans opened the gate. Then, as the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was going out of the city, the light disappeared, darkness appeared, fear, dread, and hair-raising arose; then he wished to turn back. Then Sivaka the yakkha, having become invisible, uttered a sound:

‘‘Sataṃ hatthī sataṃ assā, sataṃ assatarīrathā;Sataṃ kaññāsahassāni, āmukkamaṇikuṇḍalā;Ekassa padavītihārassa, kalaṃ nāgghanti soḷasiṃ [soḷasinti (sī. ka.)].

"One hundred elephants, one hundred horses, one hundred mule-drawn chariots; One hundred thousand maidens, adorned with jeweled earrings; (All this is) not worth a sixteenth part of a single pace."

‘‘Abhikkama gahapati abhikkama gahapati;Abhikkantaṃ te seyyo no paṭikkanta’’nti.

"Go forward, householder, go forward, householder; Going forward is better for you, not going back."

Atha kho anāthapiṇḍikassa gahapatissa andhakāro antaradhāyi, āloko pāturahosi. Yaṃ ahosi bhayaṃ chambhitattaṃ lomahaṃso so paṭippassambhi.

Tatiyampi kho sivako yakkho antarahito saddamanussāvesi –

Then, for the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, the darkness vanished, and light appeared. The fear, terror, and hair-raising that he had felt subsided. A second time... a third time... for the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, the light vanished, and darkness appeared. Fear, terror, and a hair-raising sensation arose, and from there, he wished to turn back again. For the third time, the yakkha Sivaka, having disappeared, uttered a sound:

‘‘Sataṃ hatthī sataṃ assā, sataṃ assatarīrathā;Sataṃ kaññāsahassāni, āmukkamaṇikuṇḍalā;Ekassa padavītihārassa, kalaṃ nāgghanti soḷasiṃ.

"One hundred elephants, one hundred horses, one hundred mule-drawn chariots; One hundred thousand maidens, adorned with jeweled earrings; (All this is) not worth a sixteenth part of a single pace."

‘‘Abhikkama gahapati abhikkama gahapati,Abhikkantaṃ te seyyo no paṭikkanta’’nti.

"Go forward, householder, go forward, householder. Going forward is better for you, not going back."

Tatiyampi kho anāthapiṇḍikassa gahapatissa andhakāro antaradhāyi, āloko pāturahosi, yaṃ ahosi bhayaṃ chambhitattaṃ lomahaṃso, so paṭippassambhi. Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati yena sītavanaṃ tenupasaṅkami. Tena kho pana samayena bhagavā rattiyā paccūsasamayaṃ paccuṭṭhāya ajjhokāse caṅkamati.

Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati – nāmena maṃ bhagavā ālapatīti – haṭṭho udaggo yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavato pādesu sirasā nipatitvā bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kacci, bhante, bhagavā sukhaṃ sayitthā’’ti?

For the third time, the darkness around the householder Anāthapiṇḍika disappeared, and light appeared. The fear, terror, and hair-raising dread he had felt subsided. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Sītavana. At that time, the Blessed One had risen at the break of dawn and was walking in the open air. He saw Anāthapiṇḍika the householder coming from afar. Seeing him, the Blessed One stepped down from his walking path and sat down on a prepared seat. Sitting there, the Blessed One said to Anāthapiṇḍika the householder: "Come, Sudatta." Then Anāthapiṇḍika the householder, overjoyed and elated, thought, "The Blessed One addresses me by name!" He approached the Blessed One, bowed his head at the Blessed One's feet, and said, "I hope, Venerable Sir, the Blessed One slept comfortably?"

[saṃ. ni. 1.242] ‘‘Sabbadā ve sukhaṃ seti, brāhmaṇo parinibbuto;Yo na limpati kāmesu, sītibhūto nirūpadhi.

"Always indeed the Brahmin sleeps in bliss, fully liberated; Who is not stained by sensual pleasures, cooled and without acquisitions."

‘‘Sabbā āsattiyo chetvā, vineyya hadaye daraṃ;Upasanto sukhaṃ seti, santiṃ pappuyya cetasā’’ti [cetasoti (sī. syā.)].

"Having cut off all attachments, having dispelled fear from the heart, The peaceful one sleeps happily, having attained peace of mind."

Atha kho bhagavā anāthapiṇḍikassa gahapatissa anupubbiṃ kathaṃ [ānupubbikathaṃ (sī.)] kathesi, seyyathidaṃ – dānakathaṃ sīlakathaṃ saggakathaṃ, kāmānaṃ ādīnavaṃ okāraṃ saṃkilesaṃ, nekkhamme ānisaṃsaṃ pakāsesi.

Then the Blessed One gradually gave the householder Anāthapiṇḍika a progressive talk, that is, a talk on giving, on virtue, on heaven; he explained the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that the householder Anāthapiṇḍika’s mind was ready, pliable, free from hindrances, uplifted, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth, with stains removed, would properly absorb dye, so too, while the householder Anāthapiṇḍika sat there, the dust-free, stainless vision of the Dhamma arose in him: “Whatever is subject to arising is all subject to cessation.” Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma, crossed over doubt, got rid of perplexity, attained assurance, and become independent of others in the Teacher’s dispensation, said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent, venerable sir! Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes might see forms, so too has the Blessed One made the Dhamma clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for as long as life lasts. And may the Blessed One accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of bhikkhus.” The Blessed One consented by silence.

Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati bhagavato adhivāsanaṃ viditvā uṭṭhāyāsanā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṃ katvā pakkāmi. Assosi kho rājagahako seṭṭhī – ‘‘anāthapiṇḍikena kira gahapatinā svātanāya buddhappamukho saṅgho nimantito’’ti.

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, knowing the Blessed One’s acceptance, rose from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping his right side towards him, and departed. The wealthy merchant of Rājagaha heard: “It seems the householder Anāthapiṇḍika has invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for tomorrow’s meal.”

306. Atha kho rājagahako seṭṭhī anāthapiṇḍikaṃ gahapatiṃ etadavoca – ‘‘tayā kira, gahapati, svātanāya buddhappamukho saṅgho nimantito. Tvañcāsi āgantuko.

306.Then the wealthy merchant of Rājagaha said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika: “Householder, I hear that you have invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for tomorrow. And you are a visitor here. Householder, let me provide you with the means so that you can offer a meal to the Sangha headed by the Buddha.” “Enough, householder, I have the means by which I will offer a meal to the Sangha headed by the Buddha.”

Assosi kho rājagahako negamo – ‘‘anāthapiṇḍikena kira gahapatinā svātanāya buddhappamukho saṅgho nimantito’’ti. Atha kho rājagahako negamo anāthapiṇḍikaṃ gahapatiṃ etadavoca – ‘‘tayā kira, gahapati, svātanāya buddhappamukho saṅgho nimantito. Tvañcāsi āgantuko.

The townspeople of Rājagaha heard: “It seems the householder Anāthapiṇḍika has invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for tomorrow.” Then the townspeople of Rājagaha said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika: “Householder, I hear that you have invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for tomorrow. And you are a visitor here. Householder, let me provide you with the means so that you can offer a meal to the Sangha headed by the Buddha.” “Enough, sirs. I have the means by which I will offer a meal to the Sangha headed by the Buddha.”

Assosi kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro – ‘‘anāthapiṇḍikena kira gahapatinā svātanāya buddhappamukho saṅgho nimantito’’ti.

King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha heard: “It seems the householder Anāthapiṇḍika has invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for tomorrow.” Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika: “Householder, I hear that you have invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for tomorrow. And you are a visitor here. Householder, let me provide you with the means so that you can prepare a meal for the Sangha headed by the Buddha.” “Enough, your majesty; I have the means by which I will prepare a meal for the Sangha headed by the Buddha.”

Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati tassā rattiyā accayena rājagahakassa seṭṭhissa nivesane paṇītaṃ khādanīyaṃ bhojanīyaṃ paṭiyādāpetvā bhagavato kālaṃ ārocāpesi – ‘‘kālo, bhante, niṭṭhitaṃ bhatta’’nti.

Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati buddhappamukhaṃ bhikkhusaṅghaṃ paṇītena khādanīyena bhojanīyena sahatthā santappetvā sampavāretvā, bhagavantaṃ bhuttāviṃ onītapattapāṇiṃ, ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘adhivāsetu me, bhante, bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ vassāvāsaṃ saddhiṃ bhikkhusaṅghenā’’ti. ‘‘Suññāgāre kho, gahapati, tathāgatā abhiramantī’’ti. ‘‘Aññātaṃ bhagavā, aññātaṃ sugatā’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā anāthapiṇḍikaṃ gahapatiṃ dhammiyā kathāya sandassetvā samādapetvā samuttejetvā sampahaṃsetvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkāmi.

Then, when the night had passed, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika had delicious hard and soft food prepared in the residence of the wealthy merchant of Rājagaha and informed the Blessed One of the time, saying: “Venerable sir, it is time; the meal is ready.” Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the residence of the wealthy merchant of Rājagaha. Having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of bhikkhus. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika personally served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with delicious hard and soft food. When the Blessed One had finished eating and had put away his bowl, the householder sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, may the Blessed One accept my invitation to spend the rains in Sāvatthī together with the Sangha of bhikkhus.” “Householder, the Tathāgatas delight in empty dwellings.” “It is understood, Blessed One, it is understood, Sugata.” Then the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, and gladdened the householder Anāthapiṇḍika with a Dhamma talk, after which he rose from his seat and departed.

307. Tena kho pana samayena anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati bahumitto hoti bahusahāyo ādeyyavāco. Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati rājagahe taṃ karaṇīyaṃ tīretvā yena sāvatthi tena pakkāmi. Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati antarāmagge manusse āṇāpesi – ‘‘ārāme, ayyā, karotha, vihāre patiṭṭhāpetha, dānāni paṭṭhapetha. Buddho loke uppanno. So ca mayā bhagavā nimantito iminā maggena āgacchissatī’’ti. Atha kho te manussā anāthapiṇḍikena gahapatinā uyyojitā ārāme akaṃsu, vihāre patiṭṭhāpesuṃ, dānāni paṭṭhapesuṃ.

307.At that time, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika had many friends and associates, and his word was heeded. Then, after completing that business in Rājagaha, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika set out for Sāvatthī. Then, along the way, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika instructed people: “Sirs, make parks, establish monasteries, prepare offerings. A Buddha has arisen in the world. I have invited that Blessed One, and he will come by this route.” Then, urged by the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, those people made parks, established monasteries, and prepared offerings.

Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati sāvatthiṃ gantvā samantā sāvatthiṃ anuvilokesi – ‘‘kattha nu kho bhagavā vihareyya? Yaṃ assa gāmato neva atidūre na accāsanne, gamanāgamanasampannaṃ, atthikānaṃ atthikānaṃ manussānaṃ abhikkamanīyaṃ, divā appākiṇṇaṃ, rattiṃ appasaddaṃ, appanigghosaṃ, vijanavātaṃ, manussarāhasseyyakaṃ, paṭisallānasāruppa’’nti.

Then, upon arriving in Sāvatthī, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika looked all around Sāvatthī, thinking: “Where could the Blessed One stay? It should be neither too far nor too near the town, suitable for coming and going, accessible to those who wish to visit, uncrowded by day, quiet at night, with little sound, free from the stir of people, secluded from people, and suitable for retreat.”

Addasā kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati jetassa kumārassa [rājakumārassa (sī. syā. kaṃ.)] uyyānaṃ – gāmato neva atidūre na accāsanne, gamanāgamanasampannaṃ, atthikānaṃ atthikānaṃ manussānaṃ abhikkamanīyaṃ, divā appākiṇṇaṃ, rattiṃ appasaddaṃ, appanigghosaṃ, vijanavātaṃ, manussarāhasseyyakaṃ, paṭisallānasāruppaṃ. Disvāna yena jeto kumāro tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā jetaṃ kumāraṃ etadavoca – ‘‘dehi me, ayyaputta, uyyānaṃ ārāmaṃ kātu’’nti [ketuṃ (vajīrabuddhiṭīkāyaṃ)]. ‘‘Adeyyo, gahapati, ārāmo api koṭisantharenā’’ti. ‘‘Gahito, ayyaputta, ārāmo’’ti. ‘‘Na, gahapati, gahito ārāmo’’ti. Gahito na gahitoti vohārike mahāmatte pucchiṃsu. Mahāmattā evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘yato tayā, ayyaputta, aggho kato, gahito ārāmo’’ti. Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati sakaṭehi hiraññaṃ nibbāhāpetvā jetavanaṃ koṭisantharaṃ santharāpesi. Sakiṃ nīhaṭaṃ hiraññaṃ thokassa okāsassa koṭṭhakasāmantā nappahoti. Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati manusse āṇāpesi – ‘‘gacchatha, bhaṇe, hiraññaṃ āharatha; imaṃ okāsaṃ santharissāmā’’ti.

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika saw Prince Jeta’s park—neither too far from the town nor too near, convenient for coming and going, accessible to those who wish to visit, uncrowded by day, quiet at night, with little sound, free from the stir of people, secluded from people, and suitable for retreat. Having seen it, he approached Prince Jeta and said, “Young lord, give me the park to build a monastery.” “Householder, the park is not to be given away, not even for a layer of millions of coins.” “The park is bought, young lord.” “No, householder, the park is not bought.” When they said, “It is bought,” and “It is not bought,” they consulted the legal officials. The legal officials said, “Young lord, since you have set a price, the park is bought.” Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika had carts bring gold and spread it over Jeta’s Grove, covering it with millions of coins. The gold brought at one time did not suffice to cover a small area near the building. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika ordered his men, “Go, sirs, bring more gold; we will cover this area.”

Atha kho jetassa kumārassa etadahosi – ‘‘na kho idaṃ orakaṃ bhavissati, yathāyaṃ gahapati tāva bahuṃ hiraññaṃ pariccajatī’’ti. Anāthapiṇḍikaṃ gahapatiṃ etadavoca – ‘‘alaṃ, gahapati; mā taṃ okāsaṃ santharāpesi. Dehi me etaṃ okāsaṃ. Mametaṃ dānaṃ bhavissatī’’ti. Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati – ayaṃ kho jeto kumāro abhiññāto ñātamanusso; mahatthiko kho pana evarūpānaṃ ñātamanussānaṃ imasmiṃ dhammavinaye pasādoti – taṃ okāsaṃ jetassa kumārassa pādāsi [adāsi (syā.)]. Atha kho jeto kumāro tasmiṃ okāse koṭṭhakaṃ māpesi.

Then Prince Jeta thought, “This will be no small matter, since this householder is giving away so much gold.” He said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, “Enough, householder; do not cover that space. Give me that space. It will be my donation.” Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika [thought]: “This Prince Jeta is a well-known and influential person; indeed, the faith of such well-known and influential people in this Dhamma and Discipline is of great consequence.” So he gave that space to Prince Jeta. Then Prince Jeta had a gatehouse erected there.

Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati jetavane vihāre kārāpesi, pariveṇāni kārāpesi, koṭṭhake kārāpesi, upaṭṭhānasālāyo kārāpesi, aggisālāyo kārāpesi, kappiyakuṭiyo kārāpesi, vaccakuṭiyo kārāpesi, caṅkame kārāpesi, caṅkamanasālāyo kārāpesi, udapāne kārāpesi, udapānasālāyo kārāpesi, jantāghare kārāpesi, jantāgharasālāyo kārāpesi, pokkharaṇiyo kārāpesi, maṇḍape kārāpesi.

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika had monasteries built in Jeta’s Grove, had cells built, had storehouses built, had service halls built, had fire halls built, had suitable-item huts built, had toilets built, had walkways built, had walkway halls built, had wells built, had well halls built, had bathhouses built, had bathhouse halls built, had ponds built, had pavilions built.

308.Then the Blessed One, having stayed in Rājagaha as long as he pleased, set out on a journey toward Vesālī. Traveling in stages, he eventually arrived at Vesālī. There the Blessed One stayed in Vesālī, in the Great Wood, at the Hall with the Peaked Roof. At that time, people were earnestly engaged in new construction. The monks who were in charge of the new construction were also diligently provided with robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal supplies as requisites for the sick. Then a certain poor weaver thought: "This will not be insignificant, as these people are earnestly engaged in new construction. Why shouldn’t I also undertake new construction?" So that poor weaver himself kneaded clay, gathered bricks, and built a wall. But due to his lack of skill, the wall he built was crooked and collapsed. A second time... a third time, that poor weaver himself kneaded clay, gathered bricks, and built a wall. But due to his lack of skill, the wall he built was crooked and collapsed. Then that poor weaver complained, grumbled, and protested: "Those who give robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal supplies as requisites for the sick to these ascetics, the Sakyan sons, are advised and instructed by them, and they oversee their new construction. But I am poor. No one advises or instructs me, nor oversees my new construction." The monks heard that poor weaver complaining, grumbling, and protesting. Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. The Blessed One, on this occasion, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: "Monks, I allow you to give the responsibility of new construction. A monk assigned to new construction should make an effort, thinking, 'How might the dwelling be quickly completed?' He should repair what is broken or damaged. And monks, it should be assigned like this: First, a monk should be requested. Having requested, a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:

309. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmassa gahapatino vihāraṃ itthannāmassa bhikkhuno navakammaṃ dadeyya. Esā ñatti.

309."Venerable Sirs, may the Sangha hear me. If it seems right to the Sangha, the Sangha may give the dwelling of such-and-such a householder to such-and-such a monk for new construction. This is the motion."

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Saṅgho itthannāmassa gahapatino vihāraṃ itthannāmassa bhikkhuno navakammaṃ deti. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa gahapatino vihāraṃ itthannāmassa bhikkhuno navakammassa dānaṃ, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

"Venerable Sirs, may the Sangha listen to me. The Sangha gives the work of new construction of the dwelling of such-and-such a householder to such-and-such a monk. Any venerable one who approves of giving the work of new construction of the dwelling of such-and-such a householder to such-and-such a monk should remain silent; any who disapproves should speak."

‘‘Dinno saṅghena itthannāmassa gahapatino vihāro itthannāmassa bhikkhuno navakammaṃ. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

"The Sangha has given the dwelling of such-and-such a householder to such-and-such a monk for new construction. If it is agreeable to the Sangha, let them be silent. Thus I hold it."

310.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Vesālī as long as he pleased, set out on a journey toward Sāvatthī. At that time, the disciples of the group of six monks went ahead of the Sangha headed by the Buddha and took possession of dwellings and bedding, saying: "This will be for our preceptors, this will be for our teachers, this will be for us."

Then the Venerable Sāriputta, following behind the Sangha headed by the Buddha, went from dwelling to dwelling, and when the dwellings were occupied and the beds were taken, he could not find a bed and sat down at the foot of a tree. Then the Blessed One, having risen at dawn, cleared his throat. The Venerable Sāriputta also cleared his throat. "Who is there?" "It is I, Blessed One, Sāriputta." "Why, Sāriputta, are you sitting here?" Then the Venerable Sāriputta explained the matter to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, on this occasion and in this connection, had the Sangha of monks assembled and questioned the monks: "Is it true, monks, that the disciples of the six monks go ahead of the Sangha headed by the Buddha, seizing dwellings and beds, saying, ‘This will be for our preceptors, this will be for our teachers, this will be for us’?" "It is true, Blessed One." The Buddha rebuked them, saying: "How can these foolish men go ahead of the Sangha headed by the Buddha, seizing dwellings and beds, saying, ‘This will be for our preceptors, this will be for our teachers, this will be for us’? This will not inspire confidence in those who lack it…" Having rebuked them… he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: "Monks, who is worthy of the best seat, the best water, the best almsfood?"

Some monks said: “Venerable sir, one who has gone forth from a noble family deserves the best seat, the best water, the best alms-food.” Some monks said: “Venerable sir, one who has gone forth from a brahmin family deserves the best seat, the best water, the best alms-food.” Some monks said: “Venerable sir, one who has gone forth from a householder’s family deserves the best seat, the best water, the best alms-food.” Some monks said: “Venerable sir, one who is skilled in the discourses deserves the best seat, the best water, the best alms-food.” Some monks said: “Venerable sir, one who is skilled in the discipline deserves the best seat, the best water, the best alms-food.” Some monks said: “Venerable sir, one who is a Dhamma-speaker deserves the best seat, the best water, the best alms-food.” Some monks said: “Venerable sir, one who has attained the first jhāna deserves the best seat, the best water, the best alms-food.” Some monks said: “Venerable sir, one who has attained the second jhāna deserves the best seat, the best water, the best alms-food.” Some monks said: “Venerable sir, one who has attained the third jhāna deserves the best seat, the best water, the best alms-food.” Some monks said: “Venerable sir, one who has attained the fourth jhāna deserves the best seat, the best water, the best alms-food.” Some monks said: “Venerable sir, a stream-enterer deserves the best seat, the best water, the best alms-food.” Some monks said: “Venerable sir, a once-returner… a non-returner… an arahant deserves the best seat, the best water, the best alms-food.” Some monks said: “Venerable sir, one with the three knowledges deserves the best seat, the best water, the best alms-food.” Some monks said: “Venerable sir, one with the six super-knowledges deserves the best seat, the best water, the best alms-food.”

311. Atha kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘bhūtapubbaṃ, bhikkhave, himavantapadese [himavantapasse (sī. syā.)] mahānigrodho ahosi.

311.Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks, once upon a time, in the Himalayan region, there was a great banyan tree. A partridge, a monkey, and an elephant lived depending on it as friends. They lived without respect, deference, and courteous behavior toward each other. Then, monks, those friends thought: 'Suppose we were to know who among us is the most senior. We would honor, respect, esteem, and venerate them, and abide by their instruction.'

‘‘Atha kho, bhikkhave, tittiro ca makkaṭo ca hatthināgaṃ pucchiṃsu – ‘tvaṃ, samma, kiṃ porāṇaṃ sarasī’ti? ‘Yadāhaṃ, sammā, poto homi, imaṃ nigrodhaṃ antarā satthīnaṃ [antarāsatthikaṃ (sī.)] karitvā atikkamāmi, aggaṅkurakaṃ me udaraṃ chupati. Imāhaṃ, sammā, porāṇaṃ sarāmī’ti.

"Then, monks, the partridge and the monkey asked the elephant: 'Friend, what ancient thing do you remember?' 'When I was young, friends, I could step over this banyan tree, straddling it between my thighs, and the topmost shoot would touch my belly. That is the ancient thing I remember, friends.'"

‘‘Atha kho, bhikkhave, tittiro ca hatthināgo ca makkaṭaṃ pucchiṃsu – ‘tvaṃ, samma, kiṃ porāṇaṃ sarasī’ti? ‘Yadāhaṃ, sammā, chāpo homi, chamāyaṃ nisīditvā imassa nigrodhassa aggaṅkurakaṃ khādāmi. Imāhaṃ, sammā, porāṇaṃ sarāmī’ti.

"Then, monks, the partridge and the elephant asked the monkey: 'Friend, what ancient thing do you remember?' 'When I was young, friends, as a baby monkey, I used to sit on the ground and eat the topmost shoot of this banyan tree. This is the ancient thing I remember, friends.'"

‘‘Atha kho, bhikkhave, makkaṭo ca hatthināgo ca tittiraṃ pucchiṃsu – ‘tvaṃ, samma, kiṃ porāṇaṃ sarasī’ti? ‘Amukasmiṃ, sammā, okāse mahānigrodho ahosi. Tato ahaṃ phalaṃ bhakkhitvā imasmiṃ okāse vaccaṃ akāsiṃ; tassāyaṃ nigrodho jāto. Tadāhaṃ, sammā, jātiyā mahantataro’ti.

"Then, monks, the monkey and the elephant asked the partridge: ‘Friend, what ancient thing do you remember?’ ‘In such and such a place, friends, there was a great banyan tree. After eating its fruit, I defecated in this spot; from that, this banyan tree sprouted. Therefore, friends, I am older by birth.’"

‘‘Atha kho, bhikkhave, makkaṭo ca hatthināgo ca tittiraṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘tvaṃ, samma, amhākaṃ jātiyā mahantataro. Taṃ mayaṃ sakkarissāma garuṃ karissāma mānessāma pūjessāma, tuyhañca mayaṃ ovāde patiṭṭhissāmā’ti.

"Then, monks, the monkey and the elephant said to the partridge: ‘Friend, you are greater than us by birth. We will honor, respect, esteem, and revere you, and we will abide by your instruction.’ Then, monks, the partridge established the monkey and the elephant in the five precepts, and he himself lived observing the five precepts. Living with mutual respect, deference, and a sharing of acquisitions, after the breakup of the body, upon death, they were reborn in a good destination, the heavenly world. Thus, monks, that was the holy life called 'Tittiriya'.

[jā. 1.1.37] ‘‘Ye vuḍḍhamapacāyanti, narā dhammassa kovidā;Diṭṭhe dhamme ca pāsaṃsā, samparāye ca suggatī’’ti.

"Those people who respect the elderly, wise in the Dhamma, are praised in this very life, and a good destination awaits them in the next."

‘‘Te hi nāma, bhikkhave, tiracchānagatā pāṇā aññamaññaṃ sagāravā sappatissā sabhāgavuttikā viharissanti.

"Monks, even animals gone to the animal realm live with mutual respect, deference, and sharing. How then, monks, could it be fitting for you, who have gone forth in this well-proclaimed Dhamma and Discipline, to live without mutual respect, deference, and sharing? This, monks, is not for inspiring confidence in the faithless… Having rebuked them… he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: ‘I allow, monks, paying homage according to seniority—bowing, standing up, saluting with joined palms, proper etiquette, the best seat, the best water, the best almsfood. And, monks, what belongs to the Saṅgha should not be denied according to seniority. Whoever denies it commits an offense of wrong-doing.’"

These, monks, are the three who are to be venerated.”

313.At that time, people were preparing pavilions, spreads, and spaces in dedication to the Sangha. The resident bhikkhus of the group-of-six bhikkhus—thinking, “The Blessed One has only permitted what belongs to the Sangha according to seniority, not what is dedicated”—went ahead of the Sangha headed by the Buddha and took possession of the pavilions, spreads, and spaces, saying, “This will be for our preceptors, this will be for our teachers, this will be for us.” Then, the Venerable Sāriputta, following behind the Sangha headed by the Buddha, found that the pavilions, spreads, and spaces had already been taken. Unable to find a space, he sat down at the foot of a certain tree. Then, at dawn, the Blessed One rose and coughed. The Venerable Sāriputta also coughed. “Who is there?” asked the Blessed One. “It is I, Venerable Sāriputta,” he replied. “Why are you sitting here, Sāriputta?” Then the Venerable Sāriputta explained the matter to the Blessed One. Then, on that occasion, the Blessed One convened the Sangha and questioned the bhikkhus: “Is it true, bhikkhus, that the resident bhikkhus of the group-of-six bhikkhus—thinking, ‘The Blessed One has only permitted what belongs to the Sangha according to seniority, not what is dedicated’—went ahead of the Sangha headed by the Buddha and took possession of the pavilions, spreads, and spaces, saying, ‘This will be for our preceptors, this will be for our teachers, this will be for us’?” “It is true, Blessed One,” they replied. … After rebuking them, … the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the bhikkhus: “Monks, even what is dedicated should not be repelled according to seniority. Whoever repels it incurs an offense of wrong conduct.”

315.Then the Blessed One, traveling by stages, arrived at Savatthi. There the Blessed One stayed in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s monastery. Then the householder Anathapindika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the householder Anathapindika said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, may the Blessed One accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus.” The Blessed One consented by silence. Then the householder Anathapindika, having understood the Blessed One’s consent, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, keeping his right side towards him, and departed. Then, when the night had passed, the householder Anathapindika had exquisite food, both hard and soft, prepared and had the time announced to the Blessed One: “It is time, venerable sir, the meal is ready.” Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe, and went to the residence of the householder Anathapindika. Having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Then the householder Anathapindika personally served and satisfied the Saṅgha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with exquisite food, both hard and soft. When the Blessed One had finished his meal and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, the householder sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the householder Anathapindika said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, how should I proceed regarding Jeta’s Grove?” “Well then, householder, dedicate Jeta’s Grove to the Saṅgha of the four quarters, both present and future.” “Yes, venerable sir,” the householder Anathapindika replied to the Blessed One, and he dedicated Jeta’s Grove to the Saṅgha of the four quarters, both present and future.

Atha kho bhagavā anāthapiṇḍikaṃ gahapatiṃ imāhi gāthāhi anumodi –

Then the Blessed One approved of the householder Anathapindika with these verses:

‘‘Sītaṃ uṇhaṃ paṭihanti, tato vāḷamigāni ca;Sarīsape ca makase, sisire cāpi vuṭṭhiyo.

"They ward off cold and heat, and also wild beasts; reptiles and mosquitoes, and also the winter rains.

‘‘Tato vātātapo ghoro, sañjāto paṭihaññati;Leṇatthañca sukhatthañca, jhāyituñca vipassituṃ.

Then a fierce wind and sun's heat arise, and they are warded off; for the purpose of shelter and comfort, for meditating and contemplating.

‘‘Vihāradānaṃ saṅghassa, aggaṃ buddhena vaṇṇitaṃ;Tasmā hi paṇḍito poso, sampassaṃ atthamattano.

The gift of a dwelling to the Saṅgha is praised by the Buddha as supreme; Therefore, a wise person, seeing their own welfare,

‘‘Vihāre kāraye ramme, vāsayettha bahussute;Tesaṃ annañca pānañca, vatthasenāsanāni ca;Dadeyya ujubhūtesu, vippasannena cetasā.

should have delightful dwellings built, and house the very learned there. To them he should give food and drink, clothing and lodgings, to the upright with a clear and serene heart.

‘‘Te tassa dhammaṃ desenti, sabbadukkhāpanūdanaṃ;Yaṃ so dhammaṃ idhaññāya, parinibbāti anāsavo’’ti.

They teach him the Dhamma, the removal of all suffering. Having understood that Dhamma here, he is extinguished, taintless."

Atha kho bhagavā anāthapiṇḍikaṃ gahapatiṃ imāhi gāthāhi anumoditvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkāmi.

Then the Blessed One, having approved of the householder Anathapindika with these verses, rose from his seat and departed.

Yo paṭibāheyya, āpatti dukkaṭassāti’’.

316.Now at that time a certain high official, a disciple of the Ājīvakas, had arranged a meal for the Saṅgha. Venerable Upananda the Sakyan arrived late and made a bhikkhu whose meal was unfinished get up. There was an uproar in the dining hall. Then that high official complained, grumbled, and criticized, saying: “How can these Sakyan ascetics arrive late and make a bhikkhu whose meal was unfinished get up? There was an uproar in the dining hall. Couldn’t they have eaten their fill while sitting elsewhere?” The bhikkhus heard that high official complaining, grumbling, and criticizing. Those bhikkhus who were modest… complained, grumbled, and criticized, saying: “How could Venerable Upananda the Sakyan arrive late and make a bhikkhu whose meal was unfinished get up? There was an uproar in the dining hall!” Then those bhikkhus informed the Blessed One about this matter. “Is it true, Upananda, that you arrived late and made a bhikkhu whose meal was unfinished get up, causing an uproar in the dining hall?” “It’s true, Blessed One.” The Buddha, the Blessed One, rebuked him… “Foolish man, how could you arrive late and make a bhikkhu whose meal was unfinished get up? There was an uproar in the dining hall. This, foolish man, is not for the confidence of those without it… Having rebuked him… he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the bhikkhus: “Monks, a bhikkhu whose meal is unfinished should not be made to get up. If anyone makes him get up, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If he is made to get up, and he has been invited (to eat), he should be told, ‘Go and fetch water.’ If this works, that is skillful. If not, he should carefully swallow the remaining food and then give his seat to a more senior bhikkhu. Monks, I say that in no way should a more senior bhikkhu be deprived of his seat. If anyone does so, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.”

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū gilāne bhikkhū vuṭṭhāpenti. Gilānā evaṃ vadenti – ‘‘na mayaṃ, āvuso, sakkoma vuṭṭhātuṃ, gilānāmhā’’ti. ‘‘Mayaṃ āyasmante vuṭṭhāpessāmā’’ti pariggahetvā vuṭṭhāpetvā ṭhitake muñcanti. Gilānā mucchitā papatanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, gilāno vuṭṭhāpetabbo. Yo vuṭṭhāpeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

At that time the bhikkhus of the group of six were making sick bhikkhus get up. The sick ones said: “Friends, we are unable to get up; we are sick.” “We will make you get up, venerables,” they said, and seizing them, they made them get up, then released them while they were standing. The sick ones, fainting, fell down. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, a sick bhikkhu should not be made to get up. Whoever makes one get up commits an offense of wrong conduct.”

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū ‘gilānā mayamhā avuṭṭhāpanīyā’ti varaseyyāyo palibuddhenti [palibundhanti (ka.)]. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, gilānassa patirūpaṃ seyyaṃ dātu’’nti.

At that time the bhikkhus of the group of six, thinking, “We are sick and cannot be made to get up,” appropriated the best beds. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow a suitable bed to be given to the sick,” he said.

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū lesakappena senāsanaṃ paṭibāhanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, lesakappena senāsanaṃ paṭibāhitabbaṃ. Yo paṭibāheyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

At that time the bhikkhus of the group of six were obstructing lodgings on slight pretexts. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, lodgings should not be obstructed on slight pretexts. Whoever obstructs them commits an offense of wrong conduct.”

[pāci. 122] Tena kho pana samayena sattarasavaggiyā bhikkhū aññataraṃ paccantimaṃ mahāvihāraṃ paṭisaṅkharonti – ‘idha mayaṃ vassaṃ vasissāmā’ti.

Yo nikkaḍḍheyya, yathādhammo kāretabbo. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, senāsanaṃ gāhetu’’nti.

At that time the bhikkhus of the group of seventeen were repairing a certain remote great monastery, thinking, “Here we will spend the rains retreat.” The bhikkhus of the group of six saw the bhikkhus of the group of seventeen repairing the monastery. Having seen them, they said: “Friends, these bhikkhus of the group of seventeen are repairing the monastery. Come, let us evict them.” Some said: “Wait, friends, until they finish repairing it; we will evict them when they have finished.” Then the bhikkhus of the group of six said to the bhikkhus of the group of seventeen: “Get up, friends, the monastery belongs to us.” “But, friends, shouldn’t you have told us beforehand? We would have repaired another one.” “Isn’t this monastery owned by the Saṅgha, friends?” “Yes, friends, it is owned by the Saṅgha.” “Get up, friends, the monastery belongs to us.” “The monastery is large, friends; you stay, and we will stay too.” “Get up, friends, the monastery belongs to us,” they said, angry and displeased, grabbing them by the neck and dragging them out. As they were being dragged out, they cried. The bhikkhus asked: “Why are you crying, friends?” “These bhikkhus of the group of six, angry and displeased, are dragging us out of the Saṅgha’s monastery,” they replied. Those bhikkhus who were modest… complained, grumbled, and criticized: “How could the bhikkhus of the group of six, angry and displeased, drag bhikkhus out of the Saṅgha’s monastery!” Then those bhikkhus reported the matter to the Blessed One… “Is it true, bhikkhus, that you, angry and displeased, dragged bhikkhus out of the Saṅgha’s monastery?” “It is true, Blessed One.”… Having rebuked them… after delivering a Dhamma talk, he addressed the bhikkhus: “Monks, one should not drag a bhikkhu out of a monastery belonging to the Saṅgha when angry and displeased. Whoever does so should be dealt with according to the law. Monks, I allow the appointment of a lodging assigner.”

Senāsanaggāhāpakasammuti

Appointment as Lodgings Allocator

317. Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘kena nu kho senāsanaṃ gāhetabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ …pe… ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgataṃ bhikkhuṃ senāsanaggāhāpakaṃ sammannituṃ – yo na chandāgatiṃ gaccheyya, na dosāgatiṃ gaccheyya, na mohāgatiṃ gaccheyya, na bhayāgatiṃ gaccheyya, gahitāgahitañca jāneyya. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, sammannitabbo –

317.Then the monks had this thought: “By whom should lodgings be allocated?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. … “I allow, monks, the appointment of a monk endowed with five qualities as a lodging allocator: one who does not go to favoritism, ill will, delusion, or fear; and knows what has been allocated and what has not been allocated. And, monks, he should be appointed thus:

‘‘Paṭhamaṃ bhikkhu yācitabbo, yācitvā byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

“First, a monk should be requested. Having requested, a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ senāsanaggāhāpakaṃ sammanneyya. Esā ñatti.

“Venerable Sirs, may the Sangha hear me. If it seems fit to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint the monk named so-and-so as lodging allocator. This is the announcement.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ senāsanaggāhāpakaṃ sammannati. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa bhikkhuno senāsanaggāhāpakassa sammuti, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“Venerable Sirs, may the Sangha hear me. The Sangha is appointing the monk so-and-so as lodging allocator. If it is acceptable to the venerable ones that the monk so-and-so be appointed as lodging allocator, let them remain silent; if it is not acceptable, let them speak.”

‘‘Sammato saṅghena itthannāmo bhikkhu senāsanaggāhāpako. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

“The Sangha has agreed upon the monk named so-and-so as the lodging allocator. The Sangha approves, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.”

318. Atha kho senāsanaggāhāpakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kathaṃ nu kho senāsanaṃ gāhetabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, paṭhamaṃ bhikkhū gaṇetuṃ, bhikkhū gaṇetvā seyyā gaṇetuṃ, seyyā gaṇetvā seyyaggena gāhetu’’nti. Seyyaggena gāhentā seyyā ussārayiṃsu…pe… ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, vihāraggena gāhetu’’nti. Vihāraggena gāhentā vihārā ussārayiṃsu…pe… ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, pariveṇaggena gāhetu’’nti. Pariveṇaggena gāhentā pariveṇā ussārayiṃsu…pe… ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, anubhāgampi dātuṃ. Gahite anubhāge añño bhikkhu āgacchati, na akāmā dātabbo’’ti.

318.Then the lodging allocators had this thought: “How should lodgings be assigned?” They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, first to count the monks, after counting the monks, to count the bed places, and after counting the bed places, to assign by the number of bed places.” When assigning by the number of bed places, they moved the bed places… “I allow, monks, to assign by the number of dwellings.” When assigning by the number of dwellings, they moved the dwellings… “I allow, monks, to assign by the number of enclosures.” When assigning by the number of enclosures, they moved the enclosures… “I allow, monks, to also give a portion. If another monk arrives after the portion has been assigned, it should not be given against one’s will.”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū nissīme ṭhitassa senāsanaṃ gāhenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, nissīme ṭhitassa senāsanaṃ gāhetabbaṃ. Yo gāheyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

At that time monks assigned lodgings to someone staying outside the precinct boundary. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, lodgings should not be assigned to someone staying outside the precinct boundary. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong conduct.”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū senāsanaṃ gahetvā sabbakālaṃ paṭibāhanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, senāsanaṃ gahetvā sabbakālaṃ paṭibāhetabbaṃ. Yo paṭibāheyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, vassānaṃ temāsaṃ paṭibāhituṃ, utukālaṃ pana na paṭibāhitu’’nti.

At that time monks, having taken possession of lodgings, were turning others away at all times. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, having taken possession of lodgings, you should not turn others away at all times. Whoever should do so, commits an offense of wrong conduct. I allow, monks, to turn others away for the three months of the rains, but not in the other seasons.”

Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kati nu kho senāsanaggāhā’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Tayo me, bhikkhave, senāsanaggāhā – purimako, pacchimako, antarāmuttako. Aparajjugatāya āsāḷhiyā purimako gāhetabbo. Māsagatāya āsāḷhiyā pacchimako gāhetabbo. Aparajjugatāya pavāraṇāya āyatiṃ vassāvāsatthāya antarāmuttako gāhetabbo. Ime kho, bhikkhave, tayo senāsanaggāhā’’ti.

Then the monks had this thought: “How many kinds of lodging allocation are there?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “There are, monks, these three kinds of lodging allocation: the early, the late, and the intermediate. The early is to be allocated on the day after the Āsāḷhī full moon. The late is to be allocated one month after the Āsāḷhī full moon. The intermediate is to be allocated on the day after the Pavāraṇā, for the purpose of future rains-residences. These, monks, are the three kinds of lodging allocation.”

319.At that time, Venerable Upananda the Sakyan, having taken up a dwelling in Savatthi, went to stay in a certain village monastery. There too, he took up a dwelling. Then those bhikkhus thought: "Friends, this Venerable Upananda the Sakyan is quarrelsome, disputatious, contentious, verbose, and a creator of legal issues in the Saṅgha. If he spends the rains here, none of us will be at ease. Let us question him." Then those bhikkhus said to Venerable Upananda the Sakyan: "Friend Upananda, didn’t you take up a dwelling in Savatthi?" "Yes, friends." "Why then, friend Upananda, do you claim two places for yourself alone?" "From now on, friends, I relinquish this one; I will take that one." Those bhikkhus who were modest… complained and criticized him: "How could Venerable Upananda the Sakyan claim two places for himself alone?" They reported the matter to the Blessed One… "Is it true, Upananda, that you claim two places for yourself alone?" "It is true, Blessed One." The Buddha rebuked him… "Foolish man, how could you claim two places for yourself alone? Foolish man, what you took up there, you relinquished here; what you took up here, you relinquished there. Thus, foolish man, you are excluded from both. This will not inspire confidence in those without it…." Having rebuked him… the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, one should not claim two places. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong-doing."

320. [pāci. 438] Tena kho pana samayena bhagavā bhikkhūnaṃ anekapariyāyena vinayakathaṃ katheti, vinayassa vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati, vinayapariyattiyā vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati, ādissa ādissa āyasmato upālissa vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati. Bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavā kho anekapariyāyena vinayakathaṃ katheti, vinayassa vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati, vinayapariyattiyā vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati, ādissa ādissa āyasmato upālissa vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati. Handa mayaṃ, āvuso, āyasmato upālissa santike vinayaṃ pariyāpuṇāmā’’ti. Tedha [te ca (syā. ka.)] bahū bhikkhū therā ca navā ca majjhimā ca āyasmato upālissa santike vinayaṃ pariyāpuṇanti. Āyasmā upāli ṭhitakova uddisati therānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ gāravena. Therāpi bhikkhū ṭhitakāva uddisāpenti dhammagāravena. Tattha therā ceva bhikkhū kilamanti, āyasmā ca upāli kilamati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, navakena bhikkhunā uddisantena samake vā āsane nisīdituṃ, uccatare vā dhammagāravena; therena bhikkhunā uddisāpentena samake vā āsane nisīdituṃ, nīcatare vā dhammagāravenā’’ti.

320.At that time, the Blessed One was teaching the monks in various ways about the Vinaya, praising the Vinaya, praising the learning of the Vinaya, and repeatedly praising Venerable Upāli. The monks thought, "The Blessed One teaches about the Vinaya in various ways, praises the Vinaya, praises the learning of the Vinaya, and repeatedly praises Venerable Upāli. Come, friends, let us learn the Vinaya from Venerable Upāli." Then many monks—elders, new monks, and those of middle standing—went to learn the Vinaya from Venerable Upāli. Venerable Upāli would recite while standing out of respect for the elder monks. The elder monks, out of respect for the Dhamma, would have him recite while they also stood. As a result, both the elder monks and Venerable Upāli became fatigued. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks," the Blessed One said, "that when a new monk is reciting, he may sit on the same seat or a higher one out of respect for the Dhamma; and when an elder monk is having him recite, he may sit on the same seat or a lower one out of respect for the Dhamma."

At that time, many monks, standing in the presence of Venerable Upāli, grew weary while waiting for the recitation. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, to sit together with those of equal seniority," he said. Then the monks thought, "To what extent is one considered of equal seniority?" They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, to sit together with those within three years," he said.

At that time, a number of monks, being of equal rank, sat on a couch and broke the couch, sat on a stool and broke the stool. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, a couch for three persons, a stool for three persons," he said. Even when a group of three sat on a couch, they broke the couch; when they sat on a stool, they broke the stool… "I allow, monks, a couch for two persons, a stool for two persons," he said.

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū asamānāsanikehi saha dīghāsane nisīdituṃ kukkuccāyanti.

At that time, monks hesitated to sit on a long seat with those of unequal seating. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, except for eunuchs, women, and hermaphrodites, to sit on a long seat with those of unequal seating," he said. Then the monks thought, "How much is the maximum length for a long seat?" They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, what can accommodate three, that much is the maximum length for a long seat," he said.

Tena kho pana samayena visākhā migāramātā saṅghassa atthāya sāḷindaṃ pāsādaṃ kārāpetukāmā hoti hatthinakhakaṃ. Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kiṃ nu kho bhagavatā pāsādaparibhogo anuññāto kiṃ ananuññāto’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sabbaṃ pāsādaparibhoga’’nti.

At that time, Visākhā Migāramātā wished to have an elephant-tusk shaped mansion built for the Saṅgha at Sāḷinda. Then the monks thought, "Has the Blessed One allowed the use of mansions or not?" They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, all uses of mansions," he said.

Tena kho pana samayena rañño pasenadissa kosalassa ayyikā kālaṅkatā hoti.

At that time, the grandmother of King Pasenadi of Kosala had passed away. Upon her death, much disallowed property had arisen for the Saṅgha, namely: chairs, couches, woolen rugs, embroidered rugs, patchwork coverlets, white woolen coverlets, cotton mattresses, blankets with figures (of animals), rugs with long fleece on both sides, rugs with long fleece on one side, rugs with a fringe on both sides, silk fabrics, rugs with a high pile, elephant coverings, horse coverings, chariot coverings, antelope-skin rugs, choice antelope-skin spreads, canopies with valances, and cushions red on both sides. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, to cut off the legs of the chairs and use them, to break the frames of the couches and use them, to unravel the cotton mattresses and make a pillow, and to make the rest into floor coverings," he said.

321.Now at that time, resident monks in a certain village near Savatthi were troubled by having to assign lodgings for visiting and traveling monks. Then those monks thought: "Friends, now we are troubled by having to assign lodgings for visiting and traveling monks. Come, friends, let us give all the communal lodgings to one monk. We will use what belongs to him." They gave all the communal lodgings to one monk. Visiting monks said to those monks: "Friends, assign lodgings for us." "There are no communal lodgings, friends; we have given them all to one monk." "But friends, did you give away communal lodgings?" "Yes, friends." Those monks who were modest… criticized and complained: "How can these monks give away communal lodgings?" Then those monks reported this matter to the Blessed One… "Is it true, monks, that monks gave away communal lodgings?" "It is true, Blessed One." The Blessed One rebuked them… "How can these foolish men give away communal lodgings? This will not inspire confidence in those without it…" Having rebuked them… he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks:

A park, the park grounds—this is the first thing that is not to be relinquished, not to be given away, whether by the Sangha, a group, or an individual.

322.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Savatthi as long as he pleased, set out on a journey toward Kitagiri with a large company of bhikkhus, about five hundred bhikkhus, including Sariputta and Moggallana. The bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu heard: “The Blessed One, it is said, is coming to Kitagiri with a large company of bhikkhus, about five hundred bhikkhus, including Sariputta and Moggallana.” [They said]: “Now, friends, let us divide all the communal lodgings. Sariputta and Moggallana are of evil wishes, fallen under the power of evil wishes; we will not assign lodgings to them.” So they divided all the communal lodgings. Then the Blessed One, traveling by stages, arrived at Kitagiri. There the Blessed One addressed several bhikkhus: “Go, bhikkhus, approach the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu and say to them: ‘Friends, the Blessed One is coming with a large company of bhikkhus, about five hundred bhikkhus, including Sariputta and Moggallana. Prepare lodgings for the Blessed One, friends, and for the community of bhikkhus, and for Sariputta and Moggallana.’” “Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. They approached the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu and said to them: “Friends, the Blessed One is coming with a large company of bhikkhus, about five hundred bhikkhus, including Sariputta and Moggallana. Prepare lodgings for the Blessed One, friends, and for the community of bhikkhus, and for Sariputta and Moggallana.” [They replied]: “There are no communal lodgings, friends. We have divided them all. Welcome, friends, to the Blessed One. The Blessed One may dwell in whichever dwelling he wishes. Sariputta and Moggallana are of evil wishes, fallen under the power of evil wishes; we will not assign lodgings to them.” “But friends, have you divided the communal lodgings?” “Yes, friends.” Those bhikkhus who were of few wishes... murmured, complained, and criticized: “How can the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasu divide the communal lodgings?” Then those bhikkhus reported the matter to the Blessed One... “Is it true, bhikkhus, that...?” “It is true, Blessed One.” The Blessed One, the Buddha, rebuked them... “How can these foolish men, bhikkhus, divide the communal lodgings? This does not lead to the confidence of the unconfident... Having rebuked them... he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the bhikkhus:

323.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Kīṭāgiri as long as he pleased, set out on a journey to Āḷavī. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Āḷavī. There the Blessed One stayed at the Aggāḷava Shrine in Āḷavī.At that time, the monks at Āḷavī were assigning new work for even the slightest reasons—assigning new work for merely placing a bowl down, for merely plastering a wall, for merely installing a door, for merely making a bolt, for merely making a window opening, for merely whitewashing, for merely blackening, for merely applying red ochre, for merely roofing, for merely binding, for merely placing a rack, for merely repairing broken or decayed parts, for merely making fixtures, assigning new work even for twenty years, for thirty years, for a lifetime, assigning new work even to a dwelling that had been completed recently.Those monks who were modest … complained and criticized them: “How can the monks at Āḷavī assign new work for such trivial reasons—assigning new work for merely placing a bowl down, for merely plastering a wall, for merely installing a door, for merely making a bolt, for merely making a window opening, for merely whitewashing, for merely blackening, for merely applying red ochre, for merely roofing, for merely binding, for merely placing a rack, for merely repairing broken or decayed parts, for merely making fixtures, assigning new work even for twenty years, for thirty years, for a lifetime, assigning new work even to a dwelling that had been completed recently?”They reported this matter to the Blessed One. … “Is it true, monks, that you are doing this?” … “It is true, Blessed One.” … Having rebuked them … the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks:“Monks, new work should not be assigned for merely placing a bowl down, for merely plastering a wall, for merely installing a door. New work should not be assigned for merely making a bolt. New work should not be assigned for merely making a window opening. New work should not be assigned for merely whitewashing. New work should not be assigned for merely blackening. New work should not be assigned for merely applying red ochre. New work should not be assigned for merely roofing.

New work should not be assigned even to a dwelling that had been completed recently. Whoever assigns it commits an offense of wrong conduct.I allow, monks, assigning new work for what is unbuilt or dilapidated. For a small dwelling, after inspecting the work, new work may be assigned for five or six years. For a medium dwelling, after inspecting the work, new work may be assigned for seven or eight years. For a large dwelling or a multi-storied building, after inspecting the work, new work may be assigned for ten or twelve years.”

At that time the monks, having undertaken new work, were residing elsewhere. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, one should not reside elsewhere after undertaking new work. Whoever resides elsewhere commits an offense of wrong conduct.”

At that time the monks, having undertaken new work, were delaying it all the time. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, new work should not be delayed all the time after undertaking it. Whoever delays it commits an offense of wrong conduct. I allow, monks, delaying it during the three months of the rainy season, but not during the suitable season.”

324.At that time, monks were using the dwelling and furnishings allocated to a certain lay follower for purposes other than those intended. That lay follower complained and criticized them, saying, "How can the venerable ones use what was allocated for one purpose for another purpose?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One.

There the Blessed One stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Feeding Place. At that time, there was a famine in Rājagaha. People were unable to prepare meals for the Saṅgha; they wanted to prepare meals by designation, invitation meals, ticket meals, fortnightly meals, Uposatha meals, and first-day-of-the-lunar-month meals. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, community meals, meals by designation, invitation meals, ticket meals, fortnightly meals, Uposatha meals, and first-day-of-the-lunar-month meals.”

Evañca pana, bhikkhave, sammannitabbo. Paṭhamaṃ bhikkhu yācitabbo, yācitvā byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

326.At that time, the monks of the group of six would take the best meals for themselves and give inferior meals to the other monks. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, that a monk endowed with five qualities be appointed as meal distributor: one who does not go to partiality due to desire, does not go to partiality due to hatred, does not go to partiality due to delusion, does not go to partiality due to fear, and knows what has been assigned and what has not been assigned. And this is how, monks, he should be appointed. First a monk should be requested; having been requested, a competent monk should inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ bhattuddesakaṃ sammanneyya. Esā ñatti.

“Venerable Sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. If it is appropriate for the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should appoint the bhikkhu of such-and-such a name as the meal distributor. This is the motion.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ bhattuddesakaṃ sammannati. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa bhikkhuno bhattuddesakassa sammuti, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. The Saṅgha is appointing monk so-and-so as meal distributor. If this is agreeable to any venerable one that monk so-and-so be appointed as meal distributor, let him remain silent; if it is not agreeable, let him speak.”

‘‘Sammato saṅghena itthannāmo bhikkhu bhattuddesako. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

“The monk named so-and-so has been appointed by the Saṅgha as the meal distributor. It is approved by the Saṅgha, therefore it is silent. Thus I understand it.”

Atha kho bhattuddesakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kathaṃ nu kho bhattaṃ uddisitabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, salākāya vā paṭṭikāya vā [paṭikāya vā (syā.)] upanibandhitvā opuñjitvā bhattaṃ uddisitu’’nti.

Then the monks who were meal distributors had this thought: “How should the meal be distributed?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, to distribute the meal by attaching it to a token or a tablet, and then drawing lots.”

Khajjakaṃ abhājiyamānaṃ nassati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgataṃ bhikkhuṃ khajjakabhājakaṃ sammannituṃ – yo na chandāgatiṃ gaccheyya, na dosāgatiṃ gaccheyya, na mohāgatiṃ gaccheyya, na bhayāgatiṃ gaccheyya, bhājitābhājitañca jāneyya. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, sammannitabbo. Paṭhamaṃ bhikkhu yācitabbo, yācitvā byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

327.At that time the Saṅgha had no one appointed to assign lodgings… no storekeeper… no robe receiver… no robe distributor… no gruel distributor… no fruit distributor… no snack distributor. The snacks were being wasted because they were not being distributed. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, a monk endowed with five qualities to be appointed as a snack distributor: one who does not go to partiality due to desire, who does not go to partiality due to hatred, who does not go to partiality due to delusion, who does not go to partiality due to fear, and who knows what has been distributed and what has not been distributed.” “And, monks, he should be appointed thus: First a monk should be asked. Having been asked, an experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ khajjakabhājakaṃ sammanneyya. Esā ñatti.

“Venerable Sir, may the Saṅgha hear me. If it seems fit to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should appoint the monk named so-and-so as the snack distributor. This is the motion.”

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ khajjakabhājakaṃ sammannati. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa bhikkhuno khajjakabhājakassa sammuti, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. The Saṅgha is appointing the monk named so-and-so as snack distributor. If it is agreeable to the venerable ones to appoint the monk named so-and-so as snack distributor, let them remain silent; if it is not agreeable, let them speak.”

‘‘Sammato saṅghena itthannāmo bhikkhu khajjakabhājako. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

“The Saṅgha has agreed to designate the monk named so-and-so as the snack distributor. The Saṅgha approves; therefore they are silent. Thus I understand it.”

Appamattakavissajjakasammuti

Appointment of a Distributor of Minor Items.

328. Tena kho pana samayena saṅghassa bhaṇḍāgāre appamattako parikkhāro uppanno [ussanno (syā.)] hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgataṃ bhikkhuṃ appamattakavissajjakaṃ sammannituṃ – yo na chandāgatiṃ gaccheyya, na dosāgatiṃ gaccheyya, na mohāgatiṃ gaccheyya, na bhayāgatiṃ gaccheyya, vissajjitāvissajjitañca jāneyya. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, sammannitabbo. Paṭhamaṃ bhikkhu yācitabbo, yācitvā byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

328.Now at that time, a small amount of requisites had accumulated in the Sangha’s storeroom. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow a monk endowed with five qualities to be appointed as a distributor of minor items: one who does not go on the wrong course through desire, through aversion, through delusion, or through fear; and who knows what has been distributed and what has not been distributed. And, monks, he should be appointed thus: First, the monk should be requested. Having been requested, a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ appamattakavissajjakaṃ sammanneyya. Esā ñatti.

“Venerable sirs, let the Sangha hear me. If it is ready for the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint the monk named so-and-so as the distributor of minor items. This is the motion.”

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ appamattakavissajjakaṃ sammannati. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa bhikkhuno appamattakavissajjakassa sammuti, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“Venerable sirs, let the Sangha hear me. The Sangha appoints the monk named so-and-so as the distributor of minor items. If the appointment of the monk named so-and-so as the distributor of minor items is agreeable to any venerable one, let him be silent; if it is not agreeable, let him speak.”

‘‘Sammato saṅghena itthannāmo bhikkhu appamattakavissajjako. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

“The monk named so-and-so has been appointed by the Sangha as the distributor of minor items. It is agreeable to the Sangha, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.”

Tena appamattakavissajjakena bhikkhunā ekā [ekekā (sī.)] sūci dātabbā, satthakaṃ dātabbaṃ, upāhanā dātabbā, kāyabandhanaṃ dātabbaṃ, aṃsabandhako dātabbo, parissāvanaṃ dātabbaṃ, dhammakaraṇo dātabbo, kusi dātabbā, aḍḍhakusi dātabbā, maṇḍalaṃ dātabbaṃ, aḍḍhamaṇḍalaṃ dātabbaṃ, anuvāto dātabbo, paribhaṇḍaṃ dātabbaṃ. Sace hoti saṅghassa sappi vā telaṃ vā madhu vā phāṇitaṃ vā, sakiṃ paṭisāyituṃ dātabbaṃ. Sace punapi attho hoti, punapi dātabbaṃ.

By that monk appointed as distributor of minor items, a needle should be given, a knife, sandals, a waistband, a shoulder-strap, a water-strainer, a needle-case, a hoe, a small hoe, a mat, a small mat, a fan, and miscellaneous articles. If the Sangha has ghee, oil, honey, or molasses, it should be given once for consumption. If there is further need, it should be given again.

Appointment of a Receiver of Robes, etc.

329. Tena kho pana samayena saṅghassa sāṭiyaggāhāpako na hoti…pe… pattaggāhāpako na hoti…pe… ārāmikapesako na hoti…pe… sāmaṇerapesako na hoti. Sāmaṇerā apesiyamānā kammaṃ na karonti.

Evañca pana, bhikkhave, sammannitabbo. Paṭhamaṃ bhikkhu yācitabbo, yācitvā byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

329.Now at that time, the Sangha had no receiver of robes… no receiver of bowls… no sender of monastery workers… no sender of novice monks. The novice monks, not being sent, did not perform their duties. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow a monk endowed with five qualities to be appointed as a sender of novice monks: one who does not go on the wrong course through desire, through aversion, through delusion, or through fear; and who knows who should be sent and who should not be sent. And, monks, he should be appointed thus: First, the monk should be requested. Having been requested, a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ sāmaṇerapesakaṃ sammanneyya. Esā ñatti.

“Venerable sirs, let the Sangha hear me. If it is ready for the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint the monk named so-and-so as the sender of novice monks. This is the motion.”

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Saṅgho itthannāmaṃ bhikkhuṃ sāmaṇerapesakaṃ sammannati. Yassāyasmato khamati itthannāmassa bhikkhuno sāmaṇerapesakassa sammuti, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“Venerable sirs, let the Sangha hear me. The Sangha appoints the monk named so-and-so as the sender of novice monks. If the appointment of the monk named so-and-so as the sender of novice monks is agreeable to any venerable one, let him be silent; if it is not agreeable, let him speak.”

‘‘Sammato saṅghena itthannāmo bhikkhu sāmaṇerapesako. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

“The monk named so-and-so has been appointed by the Sangha as the sender of novice monks. It is agreeable to the Sangha, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.”

The Sixth Chapter on Lodgings.

Tassuddānaṃ –

The summary of it:

Vihāraṃ buddhaseṭṭhena, apaññattaṃ tadā ahu;Tahaṃ tahaṃ nikkhamanti, vāsā te jinasāvakā.

A dwelling, not yet laid down by the Supreme Buddha, was then; Here and there the Conqueror’s disciples dwelt.

Seṭṭhī gahapati disvā, bhikkhūnaṃ idamabravi;Kārāpeyyaṃ vaseyyātha, paṭipucchiṃsu nāyakaṃ.

The householder, the merchant, having seen the monks, said this to them: “Let it be built, let you dwell.” They asked the Leader.

Vihāraṃ aḍḍhayogañca, pāsādaṃ hammiyaṃ guhaṃ;Pañcaleṇaṃ anuññāsi, vihāre seṭṭhi kārayi.

He allowed a dwelling, a half-gabled house, a mansion, a storied building, a cave; the merchant had a dwelling built in the monastery.

Jano vihāraṃ kāreti, akavāṭaṃ asaṃvutaṃ;Kavāṭaṃ piṭṭhasaṅghāṭaṃ, udukkhalañca uttari.

People build a dwelling, without doors, unenclosed; a door, a door-bar, a door-frame, and an upper door-frame.

A seven-part fine seat, a seat with playful legs; a seat with āmalaka-fruit-shaped legs, a mattress, and also a straw seat.

Uccāhipaṭipādakā, aṭṭhaṅguli ca pādakā;Suttaṃ aṭṭhapadaṃ coḷaṃ, tūlikaṃ aḍḍhakāyikaṃ.

High-footed sandals, and sandals eight fingers wide; a cloth eight spans long, a cotton blanket, a half-body cover.

Giraggo bhisiyo cāpi, dussaṃ senāsanampi ca;Onaddhaṃ heṭṭhā patati, uppāṭetvā haranti ca.

A mountain-top, cushions, and also a cloth, and a lodging; tied below, it falls down, and they tear it up and carry it away.

Bhattiñca hatthabhattiñca, anuññāsi tathāgato;Titthiyā vihāre cāpi, thusaṃ saṇhañca mattikā.

The Tathagata allowed sandals and hand-fans; and also chaff, fine clay, and clay in the dwellings of sectarians.

Ikkāsaṃ pāṇikaṃ kuṇḍaṃ, sāsapaṃ sitthatelakaṃ;Ussanne paccuddharituṃ, pharusaṃ gaṇḍumattikaṃ.

A reed, a drinking bowl, a cooking pot; mustard seed, and sesame oil; to remove what is excessive; coarse gravel, and lumps of earth.

Ikkāsaṃ paṭibhānañca, nīcā cayo ca āruhaṃ;Paripatanti āḷakā, aḍḍhakuṭṭaṃ tayo puna.

A reed, and an eloquent reply; a low heap, and a climbing up; the thatch falls down, a half-wall, and three again.

Khuddake kuṭṭapādo ca, ovassati saraṃ khilaṃ;Cīvaravaṃsaṃ rajjuñca, āḷindaṃ kiṭikena ca.

A small hut, and a wall-footing; it rains on the barren pond; a robe-pole, a rope, and a verandah with a threshold.

Ālambanaṃ tiṇacuṇṇaṃ, heṭṭhāmagge nayaṃ kare;Ajjhokāse otappati, sālaṃ heṭṭhā ca bhājanaṃ.

A support, grass powder; below the path, one should lead; it heats up in the open air; a hall, and a container below.

A dwelling, and a storeroom; a surrounding area, a fire-hall; and again in the monastery and the storeroom, one should lead below.

Sudhaṃ anāthapiṇḍi ca, saddho sītavanaṃ agā;Diṭṭhadhammo nimantesi, saha saṅghena nāyakaṃ.

Anāthapiṇḍika, the faithful, went to Sītavana; Diṭṭhadhamma invited the Leader together with the Sangha.

Āṇāpesantarāmagge, ārāmaṃ kārayī gaṇo;Vesāliyaṃ navakammaṃ, purato ca pariggahi.

He ordered (them) to clear the road in between; the group had a monastery built; in Vesālī, new construction, and the front was enclosed.

Ko arahati bhattagge, tittirañca avandiyā;Pariggahitantaragharā, tūlo sāvatthi osari.

Who is worthy of the meal, and the partridge, and those not to be venerated; those who seized inner houses, Tūla descended to Sāvatthī.

Patiṭṭhāpesi ārāmaṃ, bhattagge ca kolāhalaṃ;Gilānā varaseyyā ca, lesā sattarasā tahiṃ.

He established the monastery, and a noisy refectory; the sick, and excellent beds; seventeen kinds of medicine were there.

Kena nu kho kathaṃ nu kho, vihāraggena bhājayi;Pariveṇaṃ anubhāgañca, akāmā bhāgaṃ no dade.

By whom, pray, and how was the dwelling divided? The surrounding area, and the allotted portion; unwilling, they gave no share.

Nissīmaṃ sabbakālañca, gāhā senāsane tayo;Upanando ca vaṇṇesi, ṭhitakā samakāsanā.

Without boundaries, and at all times; the three lodgings were seized; Upananda also praised, those standing and those sitting equally.

Samānāsanikā bhindiṃsu, tivaggā ca duvaggikaṃ;Asamānāsanikā dīghaṃ, sāḷindaṃ paribhuñjituṃ.

Those who shared seats broke (the Sangha), and the group of three (split) into two; those who did not share seats enjoyed the long verandah.

Ayyikā ca avidūre, bhājitañca kīṭāgire;Āḷavī piṇḍakakuṭṭehi, dvāraaggaḷavaṭṭikā.

An old woman was not far, and the division was at Kīṭāgiri; in Āḷavī, alms-lumps, wall-fragments, and door-bolts.

White and black light, and ochre coverings and bandages; bundles, fragments, and miscellaneous articles, twenty or thirty at a time.

Osite akataṃ vippaṃ, khudde chappañcavassikaṃ;Aḍḍhayoge ca sattaṭṭha, mahalle dasa dvādasa.

What was left unfinished, and what was not done; for a small one, five or six years; for a half-gabled house, seven or eight; for a large one, ten or twelve.

Sabbaṃ vihāraṃ ekassa, aññaṃ vāsenti saṅghikaṃ;Nissīmaṃ sabbakālañca, pakkami vibbhamanti ca.

The entire dwelling for one, and others dwell in a Sangha dwelling; without boundaries, and at all times, they departed and wandered about.

Kālañca sāmaṇerañca, sikkhāpaccakkhaantimaṃ;Ummattakhittacittā ca, vedanāpattidassanā.

The time, and the novice, and the final renunciation of training; the insane and the deranged, and the showing of the offense through feeling.

Appaṭikammadiṭṭhiyā, paṇḍakā theyyatitthiyā;Tiracchānamātupitu, arahantā ca dūsakā.

Those with unrectified wrong views, eunuchs, thieves, sectarians; those who defile animals, mothers, fathers, and arahants.

Bhedakā lohituppādā, ubhato cāpi byañjanakā;Mā saṅghassa parihāyi, kammaṃ aññassa dātave.

Those who cause schism, those who cause blood to flow, and those of ambiguous sex: Let the Saṅgha not decline, nor let the act be given to another.

Vippakate ca aññassa, kate tasseva pakkame;Vibbhamati kālaṅkato, sāmaṇero ca jāyati.

If another is at fault, and the act is done on his account, he wanders astray upon death, or is reborn as a sāmaṇera.

Paccakkhāto ca sikkhāya, antimajjhāpannako yadi;Saṅghova sāmiko hoti, ummattakhittavedanā.

If one renounces the training or has fallen into the final offense, the Saṅgha is the owner, or in cases of insanity, mental derangement, or acute suffering.

Adassanāppaṭikamme, diṭṭhi tasseva hoti taṃ;Paṇḍako theyyatitthī ca, tiracchānamātupettikaṃ.

If there is no seeing, no counteraction, that view remains his. A eunuch, a thief, a sectarian, and one who has had intercourse with an animal, his mother, or his father.

Ghātako dūsako cāpi, bhedalohitabyañjanā;Paṭijānāti yadi so, saṅghova hoti sāmiko.

The killer, the defiler, and one who causes schism, sheds blood, or is of ambiguous sex; if he acknowledges it, the Saṅgha itself is the owner.

Harantaññatra kukkuccaṃ, undriyati ca kambalaṃ;Dussañca cammacakkalī, coḷakaṃ akkamanti ca.

Taking what is not given, without remorse, they pull out the woolen blanket. And the cloth, the leather mat, and the outer cloak, they trample.

Allā upāhanāniṭṭhu, likhanti apassenti ca;Apassenaṃ likhateva, dhotapaccattharena ca.

The sandals are wet, they scrape and do not see. Not seeing, they scrape, and with a washed covering.

Rājagahe na sakkonti, lāmakaṃ bhattuddesakaṃ;Kathaṃ nu kho paññāpakaṃ, bhaṇḍāgārikasammuti.

In Rājagaha, they cannot find a poor food distributor. How then could there be an appointment of a storekeeper?

Paṭiggāhabhājako cāpi, yāgu ca phalabhājako;Khajjakabhājako ceva, appamattakavissajje.

The receiver of alms, the distributor of gruel, the distributor of fruit, and the distributor of snacks, who dispenses sparingly.

Sāṭiyaggāhāpako ceva, tatheva pattaggāhako;Ārāmikasāmaṇera, pesakassa ca sammuti.

The robe-receiver and likewise the bowl-receiver; the monastery attendant, the sāmaṇera, and the appointment of a messenger.

Sabbābhibhū lokavidū, hitacitto vināyako;Leṇatthañca sukhatthañca, jhāyituñca vipassitunti.

The all-conquering, knower of the world, the leader with a mind for welfare, for shelter, for happiness, for meditation, and for insight.
