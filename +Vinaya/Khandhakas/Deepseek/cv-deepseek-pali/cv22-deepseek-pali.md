1.The First Recitation Section

446. Tena kho pana samayena vassasataparinibbute bhagavati vesālikā vajjiputtakā bhikkhū vesāliyaṃ dasa vatthūni dīpenti – kappati siṅgiloṇakappo, kappati dvaṅgulakappo, kappati gāmantarakappo, kappati āvāsakappo, kappati anumatikappo, kappati āciṇṇakappo, kappati amathitakappo, kappati jaḷogiṃ pātuṃ, kappati adasakaṃ nisīdanaṃ, kappati jātarūparajatanti.

446.At that time, when a hundred years had passed since the Blessed One’s final Nibbāna, the Vajjian monks of Vesālī proclaimed ten points in Vesālī: the practice of storing salt in a horn is allowable, the practice of eating when the shadow is two fingers wide is allowable, the practice of going to another village after eating is allowable, the practice of holding observances in separate dwellings is allowable, the practice of obtaining consent after an action is allowable, the practice of following customary practices is allowable, the practice of drinking sour whey is allowable, the practice of drinking unfermented palm-wine is allowable, the practice of using a seat-covering without a border is allowable, the practice of accepting gold and silver is allowable.

Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā yaso kākaṇḍakaputto vajjīsu cārikaṃ caramāno yena vesālī tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ āyasmā yaso kākaṇḍakaputto vesāliyaṃ viharati mahāvane kūṭāgārasālāyaṃ. Tena kho pana samayena vesālikā vajjiputtakā bhikkhū tadahuposathe kaṃsapātiṃ [kaṃsacāṭiṃ (syā.)] udakena pūretvā majjhe bhikkhusaṅghassa ṭhapetvā āgatāgate vesālike upāsake evaṃ vadanti – ‘‘dethāvuso, saṅghassa kahāpaṇampi aḍḍhampi pādampi māsakarūpampi. Bhavissati saṅghassa parikkhārena karaṇīya’’nti. Evaṃ vutte āyasmā yaso kākaṇḍakaputto vesālike upāsake etadavoca – ‘‘māvuso, adattha saṅghassa kahāpaṇampi aḍḍhampi pādampi māsakarūpampi. Na kappati samaṇānaṃ sakyaputtiyānaṃ jātarūparajataṃ; na sādiyanti samaṇā sakyaputtiyā jātarūparajataṃ; na paṭiggaṇhanti samaṇā sakyaputtiyā jātarūparajataṃ; nikkhittamaṇisuvaṇṇā samaṇā sakyaputtiyā apetajātarūparajatā’’ti. Evampi kho vesālikā upāsakā āyasmatā yasena kākaṇḍakaputtena vuccamānā adaṃsuyeva saṅghassa kahāpaṇampi aḍḍhampi pādampi māsakarūpampi.

At that time, the Venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍaka, was wandering in the Vajjian country when he arrived at Vesālī. There, the Venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍaka, stayed in Vesālī at the Great Wood, in the Hall with the Peaked Roof. At that time, the Vajjian monks of Vesālī filled a bronze bowl with water and placed it in the midst of the Saṅgha on the Uposatha day. As the lay followers of Vesālī arrived, they said, “Give, friends, a kahāpaṇa, half a kahāpaṇa, a quarter, or a māsaka to the Saṅgha. It will be used for the Saṅgha’s needs.” When this was said, the Venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍaka, addressed the lay followers of Vesālī: “Do not give, friends, a kahāpaṇa, half a kahāpaṇa, a quarter, or a māsaka to the Saṅgha. It is not allowable for the Sakyan ascetics to accept gold and silver; the Sakyan ascetics do not approve of gold and silver; the Sakyan ascetics do not receive gold and silver; the Sakyan ascetics have rejected jewels and gold and are free from gold and silver.” Though the lay followers of Vesālī were spoken to thus by the Venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍaka, they still gave a kahāpaṇa, half a kahāpaṇa, a quarter, or a māsaka to the Saṅgha.

Atha kho vesālikā vajjiputtakā bhikkhū tassā rattiyā accayena taṃ hiraññaṃ bhikkhaggena [bhikkhuggena (syā.)] paṭivīsaṃ [paṭiviṃsaṃ (sī.), paṭivisaṃ (syā.)] ṭhapetvā bhājesuṃ. Atha kho vesālikā vajjiputtakā bhikkhū āyasmantaṃ yasaṃ kākaṇḍakaputtaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘eso te, āvuso yasa, hiraññassa paṭivīso’’ti. ‘‘Natthi, me āvuso, hiraññassa paṭivīso, nāhaṃ hiraññaṃ sādiyāmī’’ti. Atha kho vesālikā vajjiputtakā bhikkhū – ‘‘ayaṃ āvuso yaso kākaṇḍakaputto upāsake saddhe pasanne akkosati, paribhāsati, appasādaṃ karoti; handassa mayaṃ paṭisāraṇīyakammaṃ karomā’’ti te. Tassa paṭisāraṇīyakammaṃ akaṃsu. Atha kho āyasmā yaso kākaṇḍakaputto vesālike vajjiputtake bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘bhagavatā, āvuso, paññattaṃ – ‘paṭisāraṇīyakammakatassa bhikkhuno anudūto dātabbo’ti. Detha me, āvuso, anudūtaṃ bhikkhu’’nti.

Then the Vajjian monks of Vesālī, after the night had passed, placed that gold as a portion for the monks and distributed it. Then the Vajjian monks of Vesālī said to the Venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍaka, “This, friend Yasa, is your portion of the gold.” “I have no portion of the gold, friends, nor do I approve of gold.” Then the Vajjian monks of Vesālī said, “This friend Yasa, the son of Kākaṇṇḍaka, insults, reviles, and causes displeasure among the believing and devoted lay followers. Come, let us perform an act of reconciliation against him.” And they performed an act of reconciliation against him. Then the Venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍaka, said to the Vajjian monks of Vesālī, “The Blessed One has laid down, friends, that ‘an assistant should be given to a monk against whom an act of reconciliation has been performed.’ Give me, friends, an assistant monk.”

Atha kho vesālikā vajjiputtakā bhikkhū ekaṃ bhikkhuṃ sammannitvā āyasmato yasassa kākaṇḍakaputtassa anudūtaṃ adaṃsu. Atha kho āyasmā yaso kākaṇḍakaputto anudūtena bhikkhunā saddhiṃ vesāliṃ pavisitvā vesālike upāsake etadavoca – ‘‘ahaṃ kirāyasmante upāsake saddhe pasanne akkosāmi, paribhāsāmi, appasādaṃ karomi; yohaṃ adhammaṃ adhammoti vadāmi, dhammaṃ dhammoti vadāmi, avinayaṃ avinayoti vadāmi, vinayaṃ vinayoti vadāmi.

Then the Vajjian monks of Vesālī, having appointed a monk, gave him as an assistant to the Venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍaka. Then the Venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍaka, together with the assistant monk, entered Vesālī and said this to the lay followers of Vesālī: “It is said that I revile, abuse, and cause displeasure to you, the venerable lay followers, who are faithful and devoted; because I declare what is not the Dhamma as ‘not the Dhamma,’ and what is the Dhamma as ‘the Dhamma,’ I declare what is not the Discipline as ‘not the Discipline,’ and what is the Discipline as ‘the Discipline.’”

447.“Once, friends, the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Monastery. There, friends, the Blessed One addressed the monks: ‘Monks, there are these four defilements of the sun and moon, because of which, when defiled, the sun and moon do not shine, do not glow, do not radiate. What are the four? Clouds, monks, are a defilement of the sun and moon, because of which, when defiled, the sun and moon do not shine, do not glow, do not radiate. Mist, monks, is a defilement of the sun and moon, because of which, when defiled, the sun and moon do not shine, do not glow, do not radiate. Smoke and dust, monks, are a defilement of the sun and moon, because of which, when defiled, the sun and moon do not shine, do not glow, do not radiate. Rahu, the lord of asuras, monks, is a defilement of the sun and moon, because of which, when defiled, the sun and moon do not shine, do not glow, do not radiate. These, monks, are the four defilements of the sun and moon, because of which, when defiled, the sun and moon do not shine, do not glow, do not radiate. In the same way, monks, there are these four defilements of ascetics and brahmins, because of which, when defiled, some ascetics and brahmins do not shine, do not glow, do not radiate. What are the four? There are, monks, some ascetics and brahmins who drink liquor and intoxicants, not abstaining from intoxicants—this, monks, is the first defilement of ascetics and brahmins, because of which, when defiled, some ascetics and brahmins do not shine, do not glow, do not radiate. Furthermore, monks, there are some ascetics and brahmins who engage in sexual activity, not abstaining from sexual misconduct—this, monks, is the second defilement of ascetics and brahmins, because of which, when defiled, some ascetics and brahmins do not shine, do not glow, do not radiate. Furthermore, monks, there are some ascetics and brahmins who accept gold and silver, not abstaining from accepting gold and silver—this, monks, is the third defilement of ascetics and brahmins, because of which, when defiled, some ascetics and brahmins do not shine, do not glow, do not radiate. Furthermore, monks, there are some ascetics and brahmins who earn their living by wrong livelihood, not abstaining from wrong livelihood—this, monks, is the fourth defilement of ascetics and brahmins, because of which, when defiled, some ascetics and brahmins do not shine, do not glow, do not radiate. These, monks, are the four defilements of ascetics and brahmins, because of which, when defiled, some ascetics and brahmins do not shine, do not glow, do not radiate.’ This, friends, is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Sugata, the Teacher, further said:”

‘‘Rāgadosaparikliṭṭhā, eke samaṇabrāhmaṇā;Avijjānivuṭā [avijjānīvutā (syā.)] posā, piyarūpābhinandino.

“Some ascetics and brahmins are defiled by lust and hate, / Persons cloaked in ignorance, delighting in agreeable forms.

‘‘Suraṃ pivanti merayaṃ, paṭisevanti methunaṃ;Rajataṃ jātarūpañca, sādiyanti aviddasū.

“They drink liquor and intoxicants, engage in sexual activity; / They accept gold and silver, the unwise.

‘‘Micchājīvena jīvanti, eke samaṇabrāhmaṇā;Ete upakkilesā vuttā, buddhenādiccabandhunā.

“Some ascetics and brahmins make a living by wrong livelihood; / These are called defilements, spoken of by the Buddha, kinsman of the sun.

‘‘Yehi upakkilesehi upakkiliṭṭhā, eke samaṇabrāhmaṇā;Na tapanti na bhāsanti, asuddhā sarajā magā.

“Defiled by these defilements, some ascetics and brahmins / Neither shine nor glow, impure, dusty, like deer.

‘‘Andhakārena onaddhā, taṇhādāsā sanettikā;Vaḍḍhenti kaṭasiṃ ghoraṃ, ādiyanti punabbhavanti.

“Shrouded in darkness, slaves to craving, though having a guide; / They increase the dreadful heap, they grasp at dreadful renewed existence.

‘‘Evaṃvādī kirāhaṃ āyasmante upāsake saddhe pasanne akkosāmi, paribhāsāmi, appasādaṃ karomi; yohaṃ adhammaṃ adhammoti vadāmi, dhammaṃ dhammoti vadāmi, avinayaṃ avinayoti vadāmi, vinayaṃ vinayoti vadāmi.

Speaking thus, do I indeed revile, abuse, and cause to lose faith the faithful and devoted lay followers, venerables, just because I declare what is not Dhamma as not Dhamma, Dhamma as Dhamma, what is not Vinaya as not Vinaya, and Vinaya as Vinaya?

448. [saṃ. ni. 4.362 idaṃ vatthu āgataṃ] ‘‘Ekamidaṃ, āvuso, samayaṃ bhagavā rājagahe viharati veḷuvane kalandakanivāpe.

Asakkhi kho, āvuso, maṇicūḷako gāmaṇī taṃ parisaṃ saññāpetuṃ.

448.At one time, friend, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. At that time, in the royal inner palace, among the assembled royal council, this discussion arose: ‘It is allowable for the recluses, sons of the Sakyan, to accept gold and silver; the recluses, sons of the Sakyan, approve of gold and silver; the recluses, sons of the Sakyan, receive gold and silver.’ At that time, friend, the village headman Maṇicūḷaka was seated in that assembly. Then, friend, the village headman Maṇicūḷaka addressed that assembly thus: ‘Do not, sirs, speak thus. It is not allowable for the recluses, sons of the Sakyan, to accept gold and silver; the recluses, sons of the Sakyan, do not approve of gold and silver; the recluses, sons of the Sakyan, do not receive gold and silver; the recluses, sons of the Sakyan, have laid aside gems and gold, they are rid of gold and silver.’ Indeed, friend, the village headman Maṇicūḷaka was able to convince that assembly.

‘‘Atha kho, āvuso, maṇicūḷako gāmaṇī taṃ parisaṃ saññāpetvā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho, āvuso, maṇicūḷako gāmaṇī bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘idha, bhante, rājantepure rājaparisāyaṃ sannisinnānaṃ sannipatitānaṃ ayamantarakathā udapādi – kappati samaṇānaṃ sakyaputtiyānaṃ jātarūparajataṃ; sādiyanti samaṇā sakyaputtiyā jātarūparajataṃ; paṭiggaṇhanti samaṇā sakyaputtiyā jātarūparajatanti. Evaṃ vutte ahaṃ bhante, taṃ parisaṃ etadavocaṃ – mā ayyā evaṃ avacuttha.

Asakkhiṃ kho ahaṃ, bhante, taṃ parisaṃ saññāpetuṃ.

Na hi, gāmaṇi, kappati samaṇānaṃ sakyaputtiyānaṃ jātarūparajataṃ; na sādiyanti samaṇā sakyaputtiyā jātarūparajataṃ; na paṭiggaṇhanti samaṇā sakyaputtiyā jātarūparajataṃ; nikkhittamaṇisuvaṇṇā samaṇā sakyaputtiyā apetajātarūparajatā.

Na tvevāhaṃ, gāmaṇi, kenaci pariyāyena jātarūparajataṃ sāditabbaṃ pariyesitabbanti vadāmī’ti.

Then, friend, the village headman Maṇicūḷaka, having convinced that assembly, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the village headman Maṇicūḷaka said to the Blessed One: ‘Here, venerable sir, in the royal inner palace, among the assembled royal council, this discussion arose: “It is allowable for the recluses, sons of the Sakyan, to accept gold and silver; the recluses, sons of the Sakyan, approve of gold and silver; the recluses, sons of the Sakyan, accept gold and silver.” When this was said, venerable sir, I addressed that assembly thus: “Do not say so, sirs. It is not allowable for the recluses, sons of the Sakyan, to accept gold and silver; the recluses, sons of the Sakyan, do not approve of gold and silver; the recluses, sons of the Sakyan, do not accept gold and silver; the recluses, sons of the Sakyan, have laid aside gems and gold, they are rid of gold and silver.” Venerable sir, I was able to convince that assembly. Am I, venerable sir, speaking in accordance with the Blessed One’s teaching when I declare thus, not misrepresenting the Blessed One with falsehood, explaining the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, so that no co-religious criticism that accords with the Dhamma can come to a justifiable reason for censure?’ ‘Indeed, headman, when you declare thus, you are speaking in accordance with my teaching, not misrepresenting me with falsehood, explaining the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, so that no co-religious criticism that accords with the Dhamma can come to a justifiable reason for censure. For, headman, it is not allowable for the recluses, sons of the Sakyan, to accept gold and silver; the recluses, sons of the Sakyan, do not approve of gold and silver; the recluses, sons of the Sakyan, do not accept gold and silver; the recluses, sons of the Sakyan, have laid aside gems and gold, they are rid of gold and silver. Headman, for whom gold and silver are allowable, for him the five strands of sensual pleasure are also allowable. For whom the five strands of sensual pleasure are allowable, you can be certain of this, headman: “This is not the practice of a recluse, not the practice of a son of the Sakyan.” Moreover, headman, I say this: grass should be sought by one who needs grass; wood should be sought by one who needs wood; a cart should be sought by one who needs a cart; a person should be sought by one who needs a person. But in no way, headman, do I say that gold and silver should be approved of or sought.’

‘‘Evaṃvādī kirāhaṃ āyasmante upāsake saddhe pasanne akkosāmi, paribhāsāmi, appasādaṃ karomi; yohaṃ adhammaṃ adhammoti vadāmi, dhammaṃ dhammoti vadāmi, avinayaṃ avinayoti vadāmi, vinayaṃ vinayoti vadāmi.

Speaking thus, do I indeed revile, abuse, and cause to lose faith the faithful and devoted lay followers, venerables, just because I declare what is not Dhamma as not Dhamma, Dhamma as Dhamma, what is not Vinaya as not Vinaya, and Vinaya as Vinaya?

449. ‘‘Ekamidaṃ, āvuso, samayaṃ bhagavā rājagahe āyasmantaṃ upanandaṃ sakyaputtaṃ ārabbha jātarūparajataṃ paṭikkhipi, sikkhāpadañca paññapesi.

449.At one time, friend, the Blessed One, in Rājagaha, referring to Venerable Upananda Sakyaputta, prohibited gold and silver and laid down a training precept. Speaking thus, do I indeed revile, abuse, and cause to lose faith the faithful and devoted lay followers, venerables, just because I declare what is not Dhamma as not Dhamma, Dhamma as Dhamma, what is not Vinaya as not Vinaya, and Vinaya as Vinaya?

Evaṃ vutte vesālikā upāsakā āyasmantaṃ yasaṃ kākaṇḍakaputtaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘ekova bhante, ayyo yaso kākaṇḍakaputto samaṇo sakyaputtiyo. Sabbevime assamaṇā asakyaputtiyā. Vasatu, bhante, ayyo yaso kākaṇḍakaputto vesāliyaṃ. Mayaṃ ayyassa yasassa kākaṇḍakaputtassa ussukkaṃ karissāma cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhārāna’’nti. Atha kho āyasmā yaso kākaṇḍakaputto vesālike upāsake saññāpetvā anudūtena bhikkhunā saddhiṃ ārāmaṃ agamāsi.

When this was said, the lay followers of Vesālī said to Venerable Yasa Kākaṇḍakaputta: ‘Venerable sir, only Venerable Yasa Kākaṇḍakaputta is a recluse, a son of the Sakyan. All these others are not recluses, not sons of the Sakyan. Let Venerable Yasa Kākaṇḍakaputta stay in Vesālī. We will be zealous on behalf of Venerable Yasa Kākaṇḍakaputta for robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicinal requisites.’ Then, having convinced the lay followers of Vesālī, Venerable Yasa Kākaṇḍakaputta went to the monastery with the messenger monk.

Atha kho vesālikā vajjiputtakā bhikkhū anudūtaṃ bhikkhuṃ pucchiṃsu – ‘‘khamāpitāvuso, yasena kākaṇḍakaputtena vesālikā upāsakā’’ti? ‘‘Upāsakehi pāpikaṃ no, āvuso, kataṃ. Ekova yaso kākaṇḍakaputto samaṇo sakyaputtiyo kato. Sabbeva mayaṃ assamaṇā asakyaputtiyā katā’’ti. Atha kho vesālikā vajjiputtakā bhikkhū – ‘‘ayaṃ, āvuso, yaso kākaṇḍakaputto amhehi asammato gihīnaṃ pakāsesi; handassa mayaṃ ukkhepanīyakammaṃ karomā’’ti. Te tassa ukkhepanīyakammaṃ kattukāmā sannipatiṃsu. Atha kho āyasmā yaso kākaṇḍakaputto vehāsaṃ abbhuggantvā kosambiyaṃ paccuṭṭhāsi.

Then the Vajjian monks of Vesālī asked the messenger monk: ‘Friend, have the lay followers of Vesālī been appeased by Yasa Kākaṇḍakaputta?’ ‘Friends, the lay followers have done us a disservice. Only Yasa Kākaṇḍakaputta has been declared a recluse, a son of the Sakyan. All of us have been declared not recluses, not sons of the Sakyan.’ Then the Vajjian monks of Vesālī said: ‘This Venerable Yasa Kākaṇḍakaputta, without our consent, has revealed our faults to the laypeople. Come, let us perform the act of suspension against him.’ They, wishing to perform the act of suspension against him, gathered. Then Venerable Yasa Kākaṇḍakaputta rose into the air and reappeared in Kosambī.

450. Atha kho āyasmā yaso kākaṇḍakaputto pāveyyakānañca [pāṭheyyakānañca (syā.)] avantidakkhiṇāpathakānañca bhikkhūnaṃ santike dūtaṃ pāhesi – ‘‘āgacchantu āyasmantā; imaṃ adhikaraṇaṃ ādiyissāma. Pure adhammo dippati, dhammo paṭibāhiyyati; avinayo dippati, vinayo paṭibāhiyyati; pure adhammavādino balavanto honti, dhammavādino dubbalā honti; avinayavādino balavanto honti, vinayavādino dubbalā hontī’’ti.

450.Then Venerable Yasa Kākaṇḍakaputta sent a messenger to the monks of Pāveyyaka and Avanti-Dakṣiṇāpatha: ‘Come, venerable ones, let us address this dispute. Formerly, what is not Dhamma flourishes, and Dhamma is suppressed; what is not Vinaya flourishes, and Vinaya is suppressed; formerly, those who speak of what is not Dhamma are strong, and those who speak of Dhamma are weak; those who speak of what is not Vinaya are strong, and those who speak of Vinaya are weak.’

Now at that time, the Venerable Sambhūta of Sāṇavāsa was dwelling on Mount Ahogaṅga. Then the Venerable Yasa, son of Kākaṇḍaka, approached Mount Ahogaṅga, and then he approached the Venerable Sambhūta of Sāṇavāsa. Having approached, he paid homage to the Venerable Sambhūta of Sāṇavāsa and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the Venerable Yasa, son of Kākaṇḍaka, said to the Venerable Sambhūta of Sāṇavāsa: “Venerable sir, these Vajjian monks of Vesālī are proclaiming ten points in Vesālī: It is allowable to store salt in a horn; it is allowable to eat when the shadow is two fingers wide; it is allowable to go to another village after having eaten; it is allowable to observe the Uposatha in separate dwellings within the same boundary; it is allowable to obtain permission after an action; it is allowable to follow habitual practice; it is allowable to drink unchurned whey; it is allowable to drink unfermented palm-juice; it is allowable to use a seat-spread without a border; it is allowable to accept gold and silver. Venerable sir, let us take up this dispute. Previously, the non-Dhamma was ascendant and the Dhamma was suppressed; the non-Vinaya was ascendant and the Vinaya was suppressed. Previously, those who advocated non-Dhamma were strong and those who advocated Dhamma were weak; those who advocated non-Vinaya were strong and those who advocated Vinaya were weak.” “So be it, friend,” replied the Venerable Sambhūta of Sāṇavāsa to the Venerable Yasa, son of Kākaṇḍaka. Then about sixty monks from Pāveyya—all forest dwellers, all alms-goers, all rag-robe wearers, all wearing three robes, and all arahants—gathered on Mount Ahogaṅga. About eighty-eight monks from Avanti and the Southern Region—some forest dwellers, some alms-goers, some rag-robe wearers, some wearing three robes, and all arahants—also gathered on Mount Ahogaṅga. Then, as the elder monks were deliberating, this thought occurred to them: “This dispute is harsh and dangerous. Whose side should we take so that we may be stronger in this dispute?”

451. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā revato soreyye paṭivasati – bahussuto āgatāgamo dhammadharo vinayadharo mātikādharo paṇḍito viyatto medhāvī lajjī kukkuccako sikkhākāmo. Atha kho therānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘ayaṃ kho āyasmā revato soreyye paṭivasati – bahussuto āgatāgamo dhammadharo vinayadharo mātikādharo paṇḍito viyatto medhāvī lajjī kukkuccako sikkhākāmo. Sace mayaṃ āyasmantaṃ revataṃ pakkhaṃ labhissāma, evaṃ mayaṃ imasmiṃ adhikaraṇe balavantatarā assāmā’’ti. Assosi kho āyasmā revato – dibbāya sotadhātuyā visuddhāya atikkantamānusikāya – therānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ mantayamānānaṃ. Sutvānassa etadahosi – ‘‘idaṃ kho adhikaraṇaṃ kakkhaḷañca vāḷañca.

Atha kho āyasmā revato soreyyā saṅkassaṃ agamāsi.

451.Now at that time, the Venerable Revata was dwelling at Soreyya—learned, one who has mastered the traditions, a bearer of the Dhamma, a bearer of the Vinaya, a bearer of the summaries, wise, competent, intelligent, conscientious, scrupulous, and eager for training. Then this thought occurred to the elder monks: “This Venerable Revata is dwelling at Soreyya—learned, one who has mastered the traditions, a bearer of the Dhamma, a bearer of the Vinaya, a bearer of the summaries, wise, competent, intelligent, conscientious, scrupulous, and eager for training. If we can gain the Venerable Revata’s support, we will be stronger in this dispute.” The Venerable Revata heard—with the divine ear element, purified and surpassing the human—the elder monks deliberating. Upon hearing, this thought occurred to him: “This dispute is harsh and dangerous. It is not proper for me to involve myself in such a dispute. But now those monks will come. If I am surrounded by them, I will not live comfortably. Why don’t I leave beforehand?” Then the Venerable Revata went from Soreyya to Saṅkassa.

Atha kho therā bhikkhū soreyyaṃ gantvā pucchiṃsu – ‘‘kahaṃ āyasmā revato’’ti? Te evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘esāyasmā revato saṅkassaṃ gato’’ti. Atha kho āyasmā revato saṅkassā kaṇṇakujjaṃ [kannakujjaṃ (sī.)] agamāsi. Atha kho therā bhikkhū saṅkassaṃ gantvā pucchiṃsu – ‘‘kahaṃ āyasmā revato’’ti?

Atha kho therā bhikkhū āyasmantaṃ revataṃ sahajātiyaṃ sambhāvesuṃ.

Then the elder monks went to Soreyya and asked, “Where is the Venerable Revata?” They told them, “The Venerable Revata has gone to Saṅkassa.” Then the Venerable Revata went from Saṅkassa to Kaṇṇakujja. Then the elder monks went to Saṅkassa and asked, “Where is the Venerable Revata?” They told them, “The Venerable Revata has gone to Kaṇṇakujja.” Then the Venerable Revata went from Kaṇṇakujja to Udumbara. Then the elder monks went to Kaṇṇakujja and asked, “Where is the Venerable Revata?” They told them, “The Venerable Revata has gone to Udumbara.” Then the Venerable Revata went from Udumbara to Aggaḷapura. Then the elder monks went to Udumbara and asked, “Where is the Venerable Revata?” They told them, “The Venerable Revata has gone to Aggaḷapura.” Then the Venerable Revata went from Aggaḷapura to Sahajāti. Then the elder monks went to Aggaḷapura and asked, “Where is the Venerable Revata?” They told them, “The Venerable Revata has gone to Sahajāti.” Then the elder monks encountered the Venerable Revata in Sahajāti.

452.Then the Venerable Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī said to the Venerable Yasa, son of Kākaṇḍaka: "Friend, this Venerable Revata is learned, a master of the tradition, a bearer of the Dhamma, a bearer of the Vinaya, a bearer of the summaries, wise, competent, intelligent, conscientious, scrupulous, and desirous of training. If we ask the Venerable Revata a question, he is capable of spending the whole night answering just one question. And now the Venerable Revata will instruct a reciting monk as his attendant. You, when that monk has finished reciting, approach the Venerable Revata and ask him about these ten points." "Yes, venerable sir," replied the Venerable Yasa, son of Kākaṇḍaka, to the Venerable Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī. Then the Venerable Revata instructed a reciting monk as his attendant. Then the Venerable Yasa, son of Kākaṇḍaka, when that monk had finished reciting, approached the Venerable Revata, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Yasa, son of Kākaṇḍaka, said to the Venerable Revata: "Venerable sir, is the salt-in-horn practice allowable?" "What, friend, is the salt-in-horn practice?" "Venerable sir, is it allowable to carry salt in a horn, thinking: 'Where there is no salt, I will use it there'?" "No, friend, it is not allowable." "Venerable sir, is the two-finger practice allowable?" "What, friend, is the two-finger practice?" "Venerable sir, is it allowable to eat food after the sun's shadow has passed beyond two fingers, at an unseasonable time?" "No, friend, it is not allowable." "Venerable sir, is the village-to-village practice allowable?" "What, friend, is the village-to-village practice?" "Venerable sir, is it allowable, thinking: 'I will go to another village now,' to eat food that has not been left over, after having eaten one's fill and refused further food?" "No, friend, it is not allowable." "Venerable sir, is the residence practice allowable?" "What, friend, is the residence practice?" "Venerable sir, is it allowable for several residences within the same boundary not to perform the Uposatha together?" "No, friend, it is not allowable." "Venerable sir, is the approval practice allowable?" "What, friend, is the approval practice?" "Venerable sir, is it allowable for a group of the Saṅgha to perform a legal act, thinking: 'We will obtain the approval of the monks who arrive later'?" "No, friend, it is not allowable." "Venerable sir, is the habitual practice allowable?" "What, friend, is the habitual practice?" "Venerable sir, is it allowable to follow what has been habitually practiced by one's preceptor or teacher, thinking: 'This was habitually practiced by my preceptor, this was habitually practiced by my teacher, so I will practice it'?" "Friend, some habitual practices are allowable, some are not." "Venerable sir, is the unchurned practice allowable?" "What, friend, is the unchurned practice?" "Venerable sir, is it allowable to drink that milk which has lost its milk-state, but has not yet reached the state of curds, after having eaten one's fill and refused further food?" "No, friend, it is not allowable." "Venerable sir, is it allowable to drink unfermented liquor?" "What, friend, is unfermented liquor?" "Venerable sir, is it allowable to drink that liquor which has been distilled, but has not yet reached the state of intoxicating drink?" "No, friend, it is not allowable." "Venerable sir, is a sitting mat without a border allowable?" "No, friend, it is not allowable." "Venerable sir, is gold and silver allowable?" "No, friend, it is not allowable." "Venerable sir, these Vajjian monks of Vesālī proclaim these ten points in Vesālī. Come, venerable sir, let us take up this issue. Formerly, what is contrary to the Dhamma prevails, and the Dhamma is rejected; what is contrary to the Vinaya prevails, and the Vinaya is rejected; those who speak contrary to the Dhamma are strong, and those who speak in accordance with the Dhamma are weak; those who speak contrary to the Vinaya are strong, and those who speak in accordance with the Vinaya are weak." "Yes, friend," replied the Venerable Revata to the Venerable Yasa, son of Kākaṇḍaka.

2.The Second Recitation Section

453. Assosuṃ kho vesālikā vajjiputtakā bhikkhū – ‘‘yaso kira kākaṇḍakaputto idaṃ adhikaraṇaṃ ādiyitukāmo pakkhaṃ pariyesati, labhati ca kira pakkha’’nti. Atha kho vesālikānaṃ vajjiputtakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘idaṃ kho adhikaraṇaṃ kakkhaḷañca vāḷañca. Kaṃ nu kho mayaṃ pakkhaṃ labheyyāma, yena mayaṃ imasmiṃ adhikaraṇe balavantatarā assāmā’’ti.

453.The Vajjian monks of Vesālī heard: "Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍaka, it seems, wishes to take up this legal issue and is seeking support—and he is indeed obtaining support." Then the Vajjian monks of Vesālī thought: "This legal issue is difficult and strong. Whose support might we obtain, so that we may be stronger in this legal matter?"

Atha kho vesālikānaṃ vajjiputtakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘ayaṃ kho āyasmā revato bahussuto āgatāgamo dhammadharo vinayadharo mātikādharo paṇḍito viyatto medhāvī lajjī kukkuccako sikkhākāmo. Sace mayaṃ āyasmantaṃ revataṃ pakkhaṃ labheyyāma, evaṃ mayaṃ imasmiṃ adhikaraṇe balavantatarā assāmā’’ti.

Then the Vajjian monks of Vesālī thought: "This Venerable Revata is very learned, has received the tradition, is a Dhamma-holder, a Vinaya-holder, a master of the matrices, wise, astute, intelligent, modest, conscientious, and desirous of training. If we could obtain Venerable Revata’s support, then we would be stronger in this matter."

Atha kho vesālikā vajjiputtakā bhikkhū pahūtaṃ sāmaṇakaṃ parikkhāraṃ paṭiyādesuṃ – pattampi, cīvarampi, nisīdanampi, sūcigharampi, kāyabandhanampi, parissāvanampi, dhammakaraṇampi. Atha kho vesālikā vajjiputtakā bhikkhū taṃ sāmaṇakaṃ parikkhāraṃ ādāya nāvāya sahajātiṃ ujjaviṃsu; nāvāya paccorohitvā aññatarasmiṃ rukkhamūle bhattavissaggaṃ karonti. Atha kho āyasmato sāḷhassa rahogatassa paṭisallīnassa evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – ‘‘ke nu kho dhammavādino – pācīnakā vā bhikkhū, pāveyyakā vā’’ti? Atha kho āyasmato sāḷhassa, dhammañca vinayañca cetasā paccavekkhantassa, etadahosi – ‘‘adhammavādino pācīnakā bhikkhū, dhammavādino pāveyyakā [pāṭheyyakā (syā.)] bhikkhū’’ti.

Then the Vajjian monks of Vesālī prepared abundant monastic requisites—bowls, robes, sitting mats, needle cases, belts, water strainers, and dusters. Taking those requisites, the Vajjian monks of Vesālī boarded a boat and sailed upstream to their associates. After disembarking from the boat, they distributed a meal at the foot of a certain tree. Then, while Venerable Sāḷha was in seclusion, meditating, this thought arose in his mind: "Who are the ones speaking in accordance with the Dhamma—the monks of the East or the monks of Pāvā?" Then, as Venerable Sāḷha reviewed the Dhamma and the Vinaya in his mind, it occurred to him: "The monks of the East are speaking contrary to the Dhamma; the monks of Pāvā are speaking in accordance with the Dhamma."

Atha kho aññatarā suddhāvāsakāyikā devatā āyasmato sāḷhassa cetasā cetoparivitakkamaññāya – seyyathāpi nāma balavā puriso samiñjitaṃ vā bāhaṃ pasāreyya, pasāritaṃ vā bāhaṃ sammiñjeyya, evameva suddhāvāsesu devesu antarahitā – āyasmato sāḷhassa sammukhe pāturahosi. Atha kho sā devatā āyasmantaṃ sāḷhaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sādhu, bhante sāḷha, adhammavādī pācīnakā bhikkhū, dhammavādī pāveyyakā bhikkhū. Tena hi, bhante sāḷha, yathādhammo tathā tiṭṭhāhī’’ti. ‘‘Pubbepi cāhaṃ, devate, etarahi ca yathādhammo tathā ṭhito; api cāhaṃ na tāva diṭṭhiṃ āvi karomi, appeva nāma maṃ imasmiṃ adhikaraṇe sammanneyyā’’ti.

Then a certain deity of the Pure Abodes, knowing with her mind the thought in Venerable Sāḷha’s mind, just as a strong man might bend his drawn-in arm or stretch out his bent arm, disappeared from among the Pure Abode deities and appeared before Venerable Sāḷha. Then that deity said to Venerable Sāḷha: "Good, Venerable Sāḷha, the monks of the East are speaking contrary to the Dhamma; the monks of Pāvā are speaking in accordance with the Dhamma. Therefore, Venerable Sāḷha, stand firm according to the Dhamma." "Even in the past, deity, and now too, I stand firm according to the Dhamma; but I do not yet reveal my view, hoping that they might consider me suitable in this dispute."

454. Atha kho vesālikā vajjiputtakā bhikkhū taṃ sāmaṇakaṃ parikkhāraṃ ādāya yenāyasmā revato tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ revataṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘paṭiggaṇhātu, bhante, thero sāmaṇakaṃ parikkhāraṃ – pattampi, cīvarampi, nisīdanampi, sūcigharampi, kāyabandhanampi, parissāvanampi, dhammakaraṇampī’’ti. ‘‘Alaṃ, āvuso, paripuṇṇaṃ me pattacīvara’’nti na icchi paṭiggahetuṃ.

454.Then the Vajjian monks of Vesālī took those requisites for a novice and approached Venerable Revata. Having approached, they said to Venerable Revata: "Venerable sir, please accept these requisites for a novice—bowl, robes, sitting cloth, needle case, belt, water strainer, and duster." "Enough, friends, my bowl and robes are complete," he said, declining to accept them.

Tena kho pana samayena uttaro nāma bhikkhu vīsativasso āyasmato revatassa upaṭṭhāko hoti. Atha kho vesālikā vajjiputtakā bhikkhū yenāyasmā uttaro tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ uttaraṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘paṭiggaṇhātu āyasmā uttaro sāmaṇakaṃ parikkhāraṃ – pattampi, cīvarampi, nisīdanampi, sūcigharampi, kāyabandhanampi, parissāvanampi, dhammakaraṇampī’’ti. ‘‘Alaṃ, āvuso, paripuṇṇaṃ me pattacīvara’’nti na icchi paṭiggahetuṃ. ‘‘Manussā kho, āvuso uttara, bhagavato sāmaṇakaṃ parikkhāraṃ upanāmenti. Sace bhagavā paṭiggaṇhāti, teneva te attamanā honti. No ce bhagavā paṭiggaṇhāti, āyasmato [āyasmato ca (syā.)] ānandassa upanāmenti – paṭiggaṇhātu, bhante, thero sāmaṇakaṃ parikkhāraṃ. Yathā bhagavatā paṭiggahito, evameva so bhavissatīti. Paṭiggaṇhātu āyasmā uttaro sāmaṇakaṃ parikkhāraṃ. Yathā therena paṭiggahito, evameva so bhavissatī’’ti. Atha kho āyasmā uttaro vesālikehi vajjiputtehi bhikkhūhi nippīḷiyamāno ekaṃ cīvaraṃ aggahesi. ‘‘Vadeyyātha, āvuso, yena attho’’ti. ‘‘Ettakaṃ āyasmā uttaro theraṃ vadetu; ettakañca, bhante, thero saṅghamajjhe vadetu – ‘puratthimesu janapadesu buddhā bhagavanto uppajjanti. Dhammavādī pācīnakā bhikkhū, adhammavādī pāveyyakā bhikkhū’’’ti. ‘‘Evamāvuso’’ti kho āyasmā uttaro vesālikānaṃ vajjiputtakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ paṭissutvā yenāyasmā revato tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ revataṃ etadavoca – ‘‘ettakaṃ, bhante, thero saṅghamajjhe vadetu – ‘puratthimesu janapadesu buddhā bhagavanto uppajjanti. Dhammavādī pācīnakā bhikkhū, adhammavādī pāveyyakā bhikkhū’’’ti. ‘‘Adhamme maṃ tvaṃ, bhikkhu, niyojesī’’ti thero āyasmantaṃ uttaraṃ paṇāmesi.

At that time, there was a monk named Uttara, twenty years old, who was the attendant of the Venerable Revata. Then the Vajjian monks of Vesālī approached the Venerable Uttara. Having approached, they said to him: "Venerable Uttara, please accept this set of novice's requisites—a bowl, robes, a sitting mat, a needle case, a belt, a water strainer, and a tooth-stick." "Enough, friends, my bowl and robes are complete," he said, unwilling to accept them. "People, Venerable Uttara, offer this set of novice's requisites to the Blessed One. If the Blessed One accepts it, they are pleased by that. If the Blessed One does not accept it, they offer it to the Venerable Ānanda, saying: 'Venerable sir, please accept this set of novice's requisites. As it is accepted by the Blessed One, so shall it be.' Venerable Uttara, please accept this set of novice's requisites. As it is accepted by the elder, so shall it be." Then, being pressured by the Vajjian monks of Vesālī, the Venerable Uttara accepted one robe. "Speak, friend, as you wish," they said. "Let the Venerable Uttara say this much to the elder, and let the elder say this much in the Sangha: 'In the eastern districts, Blessed Buddhas arise. The eastern monks are speakers of the Dhamma, while the monks of Pāvā are speakers of non-Dhamma.'" "Very well, friends," replied the Venerable Uttara to the Vajjian monks of Vesālī. Then he approached the Venerable Revata and said: "Venerable sir, let the elder say this much in the Sangha: 'In the eastern districts, Blessed Buddhas arise. The eastern monks are speakers of the Dhamma, while the monks of Pāvā are speakers of non-Dhamma.'" "Monk, you are urging me toward unrighteousness," said the elder, dismissing the Venerable Uttara.

Atha kho vesālikā vajjiputtakā bhikkhū āyasmantaṃ uttaraṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘kiṃ, āvuso uttara, thero āhā’’ti? ‘‘Pāpikaṃ no, āvuso, kataṃ. ‘Adhamme maṃ tvaṃ, bhikkhu, niyojesī’’’ti thero maṃ paṇāmesīti. ‘‘Nanu tvaṃ, āvuso [āvuso uttara (syā. kaṃ.)], vuḍḍho vīsativassosī’’ti? ‘‘Āmāvuso, api ca mayaṃ garunissayaṃ gaṇhāmā’’ti.

Then the Vajjian monks of Vesālī said to Venerable Uttara: "What, friend Uttara, did the Elder say?" "A bad deed was done by us, friends. 'You, monk, are assigning me to what is contrary to the Dhamma,' the Elder dismissed me." "But, friend, are you not a senior monk of twenty years' standing?" "Yes, friends, yet we take up dependence on a preceptor."

455. Atha kho saṅgho taṃ adhikaraṇaṃ vinicchinitukāmo sannipati. Atha kho āyasmā revato saṅghaṃ ñāpesi –

455.Then the Sangha, wishing to settle that issue, assembled. Then Venerable Revata informed the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, āvuso, saṅgho. Sace mayaṃ imaṃ adhikaraṇaṃ idha vūpasamessāma, siyāpi mūlādāyakā [mūladāyakā (sī.)] bhikkhū punakammāya ukkoṭeyyuṃ. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, yatthevimaṃ adhikaraṇaṃ samuppannaṃ, saṅgho tatthevimaṃ adhikaraṇaṃ vūpasameyyā’’ti.

"Listen to me, Venerables, the Sangha. If we settle this dispute here, the monks who took up the case from the beginning might incite [others] to repeat the action. If it seems right to the Sangha, let the Sangha settle this dispute right where it arose."

Atha kho therā bhikkhū vesāliṃ agamaṃsu – taṃ adhikaraṇaṃ vinicchinitukāmā.

Then the elder monks went to Vesali, desiring to settle that dispute.

Tena kho pana samayena sabbakāmī nāma pathabyā saṅghatthero vīsavassasatiko upasampadāya, āyasmato ānandassa saddhivihāriko, vesāliyaṃ paṭivasati.

So tvaṃ kālasseva āyasmantaṃ sabbakāmiṃ upasaṅkamitvā imāni dasa vatthūni puccheyyāsī’’ti.

At that time, the elder Sabbakāmī, the Sangha's elder on earth, having been ordained for one hundred and twenty years, a pupil of the Venerable Ānanda, was dwelling at Vesālī. Then the Venerable Revata said to the Venerable Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī: "Friend, I will go to the monastery where the elder Sabbakāmī is staying. You should approach the Venerable Sabbakāmī early in the morning and ask him about these ten points."

‘‘Evaṃ bhante’’ti kho āyasmā sambhūto sāṇavāsī āyasmato revatassa paccassosi. Atha kho āyasmā revato, yasmiṃ vihāre sabbakāmī thero viharati, taṃ vihāraṃ upagacchi.

"Very well, venerable sir," replied Venerable Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī to Venerable Revata. Then Venerable Revata approached the dwelling where the elder Sabbakāmī was residing. Inside the chamber, a seat had been prepared for Venerable Sabbakāmī, while at the entrance to the chamber, one was prepared for Venerable Revata. Venerable Revata thought, "This elder is old; he will not lie down," and so he did not prepare his own bed. Venerable Sabbakāmī thought, "This monk is a guest and weary; he will not lie down," and so he too did not prepare his bed. Then, in the early morning, Venerable Sabbakāmī rose and said to Venerable Revata, "By which abiding, friend, do you now frequently abide?" "I now frequently abide, venerable sir, in the abiding of loving-kindness." "It seems, friend, you now frequently abide in a shallow abiding. For loving-kindness is a shallow abiding." "Even in the past, venerable sir, when I was a householder, I was accustomed to loving-kindness. Therefore, I now frequently abide in the abiding of loving-kindness. Yet, I attained arahantship long ago." "And you, venerable sir, by which abiding do you now frequently abide?" "I now frequently abide, friend, in the abiding of emptiness." "It seems, venerable sir, the elder now frequently abides in the abiding of a great person. For emptiness is the abiding of a great person." "Even in the past, friend, when I was a householder, I was accustomed to emptiness. Therefore, I now frequently abide in the abiding of emptiness. Yet, I attained arahantship long ago." Now, while this conversation between the elder monks was interrupted, Venerable Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī arrived there. Then Venerable Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī approached Venerable Sabbakāmī, paid homage, and sat down to one side. Seated there, Venerable Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī said to Venerable Sabbakāmī, "Venerable sir, these Vajjian monks of Vesālī proclaim ten points in Vesālī: 'It is allowable to carry salt in a horn. It is allowable to eat when the shadow is two fingerbreadths past noon. It is allowable to go to a neighboring village and eat again. It is allowable to hold multiple Uposatha ceremonies in the same district. It is allowable to perform an act with an incomplete assembly and later gain approval. It is allowable to follow what was practiced by one’s teacher. It is allowable to consume sour milk after the midday meal. It is allowable to drink unfermented toddy. It is allowable to use a sitting mat without a fringe. It is allowable to accept gold and silver.' Venerable sir, you have learned much Dhamma and Vinaya under your preceptor. When you examine the Dhamma and Vinaya, what is your opinion? Who speaks according to the Dhamma—the monks of the East or those of Pāvā?" "You too, friend, have learned much Dhamma and Vinaya under your preceptor. When you examine the Dhamma and Vinaya, what is your opinion? Who speaks according to the Dhamma—the monks of the East or those of Pāvā?" "When I examine the Dhamma and Vinaya, venerable sir, this is my opinion: the monks of the East speak against the Dhamma, and those of Pāvā speak according to the Dhamma. Yet, I do not yet reveal my view, lest they appoint me to this case." "When I examine the Dhamma and Vinaya, friend, this is my opinion: the monks of the East speak against the Dhamma, and those of Pāvā speak according to the Dhamma. Yet, I do not yet reveal my view, lest they appoint me to this case."

456. Atha kho saṅgho taṃ adhikaraṇaṃ vinicchinitukāmo sannipati. Tasmiṃ kho pana adhikaraṇe vinicchiyamāne anaggāni ceva bhassāni jāyanti, na cekassa bhāsitassa attho viññāyati. Atha kho āyasmā revato saṅghaṃ ñāpesi –

456.Then the Sangha, wishing to settle that legal issue, assembled. But while that legal issue was being settled, endless discussions arose, and the meaning of any statement was not understood. Then Venerable Revata informed the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Amhākaṃ imasmiṃ adhikaraṇe vinicchiyamāne anaggāni ceva bhassāni jāyanti, na cekassa bhāsitassa attho viññāyati.

Atha kho āyasmā revato saṅghaṃ ñāpesi –

"Venerable sir, may the Sangha listen to me. While this issue is being adjudicated among us, not only do endless discussions arise, but the meaning of even a single statement is not understood. If it seems fitting to the Sangha, may the Sangha settle this issue by means of a referral to an arbitration committee." The Sangha selected four monks from the east and four monks from Pāvā. The monks from the east were: the Venerable Sabbakāmī, the Venerable Sāḷha, the Venerable Khujjasobhita, and the Venerable Vāsabhagāmika. The monks from Pāvā were: the Venerable Revata, the Venerable Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī, the Venerable Yasa Kākaṇḍakaputta, and the Venerable Sumana. Then the Venerable Revata informed the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Amhākaṃ imasmiṃ adhikaraṇe vinicchiyamāne anaggāni ceva bhassāni jāyanti, na cekassa bhāsitassa attho viññāyati. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho cattāro pācīnake bhikkhū, cattāro pāveyyake bhikkhū sammanneyya ubbāhikāya imaṃ adhikaraṇaṃ vūpasametuṃ. Esā ñatti.

Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. While this dispute is being decided, unprofitable words arise, and the meaning of what is said is not understood. If it seems fit to the Sangha, may the Sangha appoint four monks from the East and four monks from Pāvā by way of arbitration to settle this dispute. This is the motion.

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Amhākaṃ imasmiṃ adhikaraṇe vinicchiyamāne anaggāni ceva bhassāni jāyanti, na cekassa bhāsitassa attho viññāyati. Saṅgho cattāro pācīnake bhikkhū, cattāro pāveyyake bhikkhū sammannati ubbāhikāya imaṃ adhikaraṇaṃ vūpasametuṃ.

Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. While this dispute is being decided, unprofitable words arise, and the meaning of what is said is not understood. The Sangha appoints four monks from the East and four monks from Pāvā to settle this dispute by way of arbitration. If the appointment of four monks from the East and four monks from Pāvā to settle this dispute by way of arbitration is agreeable to the venerable ones, let him be silent; whoever does not agree should speak.

‘‘Sammatā saṅghena cattāro pācīnakā bhikkhū, cattāro pāveyyakā bhikkhū, ubbāhikāya imaṃ adhikaraṇaṃ vūpasametuṃ. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

The Sangha has appointed four monks from the East and four monks from Pāvā to settle this dispute by way of arbitration. The Sangha agrees, therefore it is silent. Thus do I hold it.

Tena kho pana samayena ajito nāma bhikkhu dasavasso saṅghassa pātimokkhuddesako hoti. Atha kho saṅgho āyasmantampi ajitaṃ sammannati – therānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ āsanapaññāpakaṃ.

Yaṃnūna mayaṃ vālikārāme imaṃ adhikaraṇaṃ vūpasameyyāmā’’ti.

At that time, a monk named Ajita, who had ten rains, was the Sangha's reciter of the Pātimokkha. Then the Sangha appointed Venerable Ajita as the arranger of seats for the elder monks. Then the elder monks thought, "Where should we settle this dispute?" Then the elder monks thought, "This Vālikārāma is delightful, quiet, and without clamor. Why don't we settle this dispute in the Vālikārāma?"

457. Atha kho therā bhikkhū vālikārāmaṃ agamaṃsu – taṃ adhikaraṇaṃ vinicchinitukāmā. Atha kho āyasmā revato saṅghaṃ ñāpesi –

457.Then the elder monks went to the Vālikārāma, wishing to resolve that dispute. Then Venerable Revata informed the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, ahaṃ āyasmantaṃ sabbakāmiṃ vinayaṃ puccheyya’’nti.

Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. If it seems fit to the Sangha, I would question Venerable Sabbakāmī concerning the Vinaya.

Āyasmā sabbakāmī saṅghaṃ ñāpesi –

Venerable Sabbakāmī informed the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, āvuso, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, ahaṃ revatena vinayaṃ puṭṭho vissajjeyya’’nti.

Friends, may the Sangha hear me. If it seems fit to the Sangha, I will answer when questioned by Revata concerning the Vinaya.

Atha kho āyasmā revato āyasmantaṃ sabbakāmiṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kappati, bhante, siṅgiloṇakappo’’ti? ‘‘Ko so, āvuso, siṅgiloṇakappo’’ti? ‘‘Kappati, bhante, siṅginā loṇaṃ pariharituṃ – yattha aloṇakaṃ bhavissati tattha paribhuñjissāmā’’ti? ‘‘Nāvuso, kappatī’’ti.

Then Venerable Revata said to Venerable Sabbakāmī: "Venerable sir, is the salt-horn allowance permissible?" "What, friend, is the salt-horn allowance?" "Venerable sir, is it permissible to carry salt in a horn, thinking, 'Where there is no salt, we will consume it there'?" "No, friend, it is not permissible." "Where was it prohibited?" "In Sāvatthī, in the Suttavibhaṅga." "What offense is incurred?" "A pācittiya for partaking of food that has been stored up."

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Idaṃ paṭhamaṃ vatthu saṅghena vinicchitaṃ. Itipidaṃ vatthu uddhammaṃ, ubbinayaṃ, apagatasatthusāsanaṃ. Idaṃ paṭhamaṃ salākaṃ nikkhipāmi’’.

Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. This is the first case decided by the Sangha. Thus, this case is contrary to the Dhamma, contrary to the Vinaya, and departed from the Teacher’s instruction. I cast this first voting ticket.

‘‘Kappati, bhante, dvaṅgulakappo’’ti? ‘‘Ko so, āvuso, dvaṅgulakappo’’ti? ‘‘Kappati, bhante, dvaṅgulāya chāyāya vītivattāya vikāle bhojanaṃ bhuñjitu’’nti? ‘‘Nāvuso, kappatī’’ti [pāci. 245]. ‘‘Kattha paṭikkhitta’’nti? ‘‘Rājagahe, suttavibhaṅge’’ti. ‘‘Kiṃ āpajjatī’’ti? Vikālabhojane pācittiya’’nti.

Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. This is the ninth case decided by the Sangha. Thus, this case is contrary to the Dhamma, contrary to the Vinaya, and departed from the Teacher’s instruction. I cast this ninth voting ticket.

‘‘Kappati, bhante, jātarūparajata’’nti? ‘‘Nāvuso, kappatī’’ti [pārā. 580 ādayo]. ‘‘Kattha paṭikkhitta’’nti. ‘‘Rājagahe, suttavibhaṅge’’ti. ‘‘Kiṃ āpajjatī’’ti? ‘‘Jātarūparajatapaṭiggahaṇe pācittiya’’nti.

“Venerable sir, is gold and silver allowable?” “No, friend, it is not allowable.” “Where was that forbidden?” “At Rajagaha, in the Suttavibhaṅga.” “What offense is incurred?” “A pācittiya for receiving gold and silver.”

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Idaṃ dasamaṃ vatthu saṅghena vinicchitaṃ. Itipidaṃ vatthu uddhammaṃ, ubbinayaṃ, apagatasatthusāsanaṃ. Idaṃ dasamaṃ salākaṃ nikkhipāmi.

“Venerable sir, may the Saṅgha hear me. This tenth matter has been decided by the Saṅgha. Thus, this matter is against the Dhamma, against the Vinaya, and departs from the Teacher’s instruction. I deposit this tenth voting ticket.”

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Imāni dasa vatthūni saṅghena vinicchitāni. Itipimāni dasavatthūni uddhammāni, ubbinayāni, apagatasatthusāsanānī’’ti.

“Venerable sir, may the Saṅgha hear me. These ten points have been adjudicated by the Saṅgha. Thus, these ten points are not in accordance with the Dhamma, not in accordance with the Vinaya, and contrary to the Teacher’s teaching.”

458. ‘‘Nihatametaṃ, āvuso, adhikaraṇaṃ, santaṃ vūpasantaṃ suvūpasantaṃ. Api ca maṃ tvaṃ, āvuso, saṅghamajjhepi imāni dasa vatthūni puccheyyāsi – tesaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ saññattiyā’’ti. Atha kho āyasmā revato āyasmantaṃ sabbakāmiṃ saṅghamajjhepi imāni dasa vatthūni pucchi. Puṭṭho puṭṭho āyasmā sabbakāmī vissajjesi. Imāya kho pana vinayasaṅgītiyā satta bhikkhusatāni anūnāni anadhikāni ahesuṃ, tasmāyaṃ vinayasaṅgīti ‘‘sattasatikā’’ti vuccatīti.

458.“This dispute, friend, is settled, calmed, pacified, well-pacified. Furthermore, friend, you may ask me about these ten points even in the midst of the Saṅgha—for the information of those monks.” Then the Venerable Revata asked the Venerable Sabbakāmī about these ten points even in the midst of the Saṅgha. Questioned again and again, the Venerable Sabbakāmī explained. At this Vinaya Council, seven hundred monks were present, no fewer and no more. Therefore, this Vinaya Council is called the “Council of the Seven Hundred.”
