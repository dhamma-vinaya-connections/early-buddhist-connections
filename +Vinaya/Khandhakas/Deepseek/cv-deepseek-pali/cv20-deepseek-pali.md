Mahāpajāpatigotamīvatthu

The Story of Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī.

402. [a. ni. 8.51 idaṃ vatthu āgataṃ] Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sakkesu viharati kapilavatthusmiṃ nigrodhārāme. Atha kho mahāpajāpati [mahāpajāpatī (sī. syā.)] gotamī yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi. Ekamantaṃ ṭhitā kho mahāpajāpati gotamī bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sādhu, bhante, labheyya mātugāmo tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajja’’nti. ‘‘Alaṃ, gotami, mā te rucci mātugāmassa tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajjā’’ti. Dutiyampi kho…pe… tatiyampi kho mahapajāpati gotamī bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sādhu, bhante, labheyya mātugāmo tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajja’’nti. ‘‘Alaṃ, gotami, mā te rucci mātugāmassa tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajjā’’ti. Atha kho mahāpajāpati gotamī – na bhagavā anujānāti mātugāmassa tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajjanti – dukkhī dummanā assumukhī rudamānā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṃ katvā pakkāmi.

402.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Nigrodha Monastery. Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, it would be good if women might obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata.” “Enough, Gotamī, do not desire that women should obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata.” A second time… A third time Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, it would be good if women might obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata.” “Enough, Gotamī, do not desire that women should obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata.” Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, thinking, “The Blessed One does not permit women to obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata,” became sorrowful, dejected, with tearful face, weeping. After paying homage to the Blessed One, she circumambulated him and departed.

Atha kho bhagavā kapilavatthusmiṃ yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena vesālī tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena vesālī tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā vesāliyaṃ viharati mahāvane kūṭāgārasālāyaṃ. Atha kho mahāpajāpati gotamī kese chedāpetvā kāsāyāni vatthāni acchādetvā sambahulāhi sākiyānīhi saddhiṃ yena vesālī tena pakkāmi. Anupubbena yena vesālī mahāvanaṃ kūṭāgārasālā tenupasaṅkami. Atha kho mahāpajāpati gotamī sūnehi pādehi rajokiṇṇena gattena dukkhī dummanā assumukhī rudamānā bahidvārakoṭṭhake aṭṭhāsi. Addasā kho āyasmā ānando mahāpajāpatiṃ gotamiṃ sūnehi pādehi rajokiṇṇena gattena dukkhiṃ dummanaṃ assumukhiṃ rudamānaṃ bahidvārakoṭṭhake ṭhitaṃ. Disvāna mahāpajāpatiṃ gotamiṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kissa tvaṃ, gotami, sūnehi pādehi rajokiṇṇena gattena dukkhī dummanā assumukhī rudamānā bahidvārakoṭṭhake ṭhitā’’ti? ‘‘Tathā hi pana, bhante ānanda, na bhagavā anujānāti mātugāmassa tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajja’’nti. ‘‘Tena hi tvaṃ, gotami, muhuttaṃ idheva tāva hohi, yāvāhaṃ bhagavantaṃ yācāmi mātugāmassa tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajja’’nti.

Then the Blessed One, having stayed in Kapilavatthu for as long as he wished, set out on tour to Vesālī. Touring by stages, he arrived at Vesālī. There the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī, in the Great Wood, in the Hall with the Peaked Roof. Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, having had her hair cut off and put on ochre robes, set out for Vesālī together with many Sakyan women. Touring by stages, she arrived at Vesālī, at the Great Wood, at the Hall with the Peaked Roof. Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, with swollen feet, her body covered with dust, sorrowful, dejected, with tearful face, weeping, stood outside the gatehouse. Then Venerable Ānanda saw Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī standing outside the gatehouse with swollen feet, her body covered with dust, sorrowful, dejected, with tearful face, weeping. Having seen Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, he said to her: “Why, Gotamī, are you standing outside the gatehouse with swollen feet, your body covered with dust, sorrowful, dejected, with tearful face, weeping?” “Because, Venerable Ānanda, the Blessed One does not permit women to obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata.” “Therefore, Gotamī, wait here for a moment while I request the Blessed One to permit women to obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”

Atha kho āyasmā ānando yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā ānando bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘esā, bhante, mahāpajāpati gotamī sūnehi pādehi rajokiṇṇena gattena dukkhī dummanā assumukhī rudamānā bahidvārakoṭṭhake ṭhitā – na bhagavā anujānāti mātugāmassa tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajjanti. Sādhu, bhante, labheyya mātugāmo tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajja’’nti. ‘‘Alaṃ, ānanda, mā te rucci mātugāmassa tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajjā’’ti. Dutiyampi kho…pe… tatiyampi kho āyasmā ānando bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sādhu, bhante, labheyya mātugāmo tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajja’’nti. ‘‘Alaṃ, ānanda, mā te rucci mātugāmassa tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajjā’’ti.

Then Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī is standing outside the gatehouse with swollen feet, her body covered with dust, sorrowful, dejected, with tearful face, weeping, [thinking:] ‘The Blessed One does not permit women to obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata.’ Venerable sir, it would be good if women might obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata.” “Enough, Ānanda, do not desire that women should obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata.” A second time… A third time Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, it would be good if women might obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata.” “Enough, Ānanda, do not desire that women should obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”

Atha kho āyasmā ānando [a. ni. 8.51 ‘‘atha kho āyasmato ānandassa etadahosī’’ti āgataṃ] – ‘‘na bhagavā anujānāti mātugāmassa tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajjaṃ; yaṃnūnāhaṃ aññenapi pariyāyena bhagavantaṃ yāceyyaṃ mātugāmassa tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajja’’nti. Atha kho āyasmā ānando bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘bhabbo nu kho, bhante, mātugāmo tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajitvā sotāpattiphalaṃ vā sakadāgāmiphalaṃ [sakidāgāmiphalaṃ (syā.)] vā anāgāmiphalaṃ vā arahattaphalaṃ vā sacchikātu’’nti? ‘‘Bhabbo, ānanda, mātugāmo tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajitvā sotāpattiphalampi sakadāgāmiphalampi anāgāmiphalampi arahattaphalampi sacchikātu’’nti. ‘‘Sace, bhante, bhabbo mātugāmo tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajitvā sotāpattiphalampi sakadāgāmiphalampi anāgāmiphalampi arahattaphalampi sacchikātuṃ; bahūpakārā, bhante, mahāpajāpati gotamī bhagavato mātucchā āpādikā, posikā, khīrassa dāyikā, bhagavantaṃ janettiyā kālaṅkatāya thaññaṃ pāyesi; sādhu, bhante, labheyya mātugāmo tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajja’’nti.

Then Venerable Ānanda thought: “The Blessed One does not permit women to obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata. What if I were to request the Blessed One in another way for women to obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata?” Then Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, is a woman capable, having gone forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata, of realizing the fruit of stream-entry, or the fruit of once-returning, or the fruit of non-returning, or the fruit of arahantship?” “She is capable, Ānanda. A woman is capable, having gone forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata, of realizing the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, and the fruit of arahantship.” “If, Venerable sir, a woman is capable of realizing the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, and the fruit of arahantship, having gone forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata; then, Venerable sir, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī has been of great help to the Blessed One. She is his maternal aunt, foster mother, and nurse, who gave him milk after his mother passed away. It would be good, Venerable sir, if women might obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”

Aṭṭhagarudhammā

The Eight Weighty Principles

403. ‘‘Sace, ānanda, mahāpajāpatī gotamī aṭṭha garudhamme paṭiggaṇhāti, sāvassā. Hotu upasampadā.

403.“Ānanda, if Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī accepts the eight weighty principles, that will constitute her full ordination.”

[pāci. 149] ‘‘Vassasatūpasampannāya bhikkhuniyā tadahupasampannassa bhikkhuno abhivādanaṃ paccuṭṭhānaṃ añjalikammaṃ sāmīcikammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Ayampi dhammo sakkatvā garukatvā [garuṃkatvā (ka.)] mānetvā pūjetvā yāvajīvaṃ anatikkamanīyo.

“A bhikkhunī ordained for a hundred years must greet, rise up for, salute with joined palms, and perform proper duties towards a bhikkhu ordained that very day. This principle, having been respected, honored, esteemed, and revered, is not to be transgressed as long as life lasts.

‘‘Na bhikkhuniyā abhikkhuke āvāse vassaṃ vasitabbaṃ. Ayampi dhammo sakkatvā garukatvā mānetvā pūjetvā yāvajīvaṃ anatikkamanīyo.

“A bhikkhunī should not spend the rains in a residence without bhikkhus. This principle, having been respected, honored, esteemed, and revered, is not to be transgressed as long as life lasts.

‘‘Anvaddhamāsaṃ bhikkhuniyā bhikkhusaṅghato dve dhammā paccāsīsitabbā – uposathapucchakañca, ovādūpasaṅkamanañca. Ayampi dhammo sakkatvā garukatvā mānetvā pūjetvā yāvajīvaṃ anatikkamanīyo.

“Every half-month, a bhikkhunī should expect two things from the Bhikkhu Saṅgha: asking for the Uposatha and approaching for instruction. This principle too, having been respected, honored, esteemed, and revered, should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

‘‘Vassaṃvuṭṭhāya bhikkhuniyā ubhatosaṅghe tīhi ṭhānehi pavāretabbaṃ – diṭṭhena vā, sutena vā, parisaṅkāya vā. Ayampi dhammo sakkatvā garukatvā mānetvā pūjetvā yāvajīvaṃ anatikkamanīyo.

“A bhikkhunī who has completed the rains should perform the Pavāraṇā from both Saṅghas on three grounds: what has been seen, what has been heard, or what is suspected. This principle too, having been respected, honored, esteemed, and revered, should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

‘‘Garudhammaṃ ajjhāpannāya bhikkhuniyā ubhatosaṅghe pakkhamānattaṃ caritabbaṃ. Ayampi dhammo sakkatvā garukatvā mānetvā pūjetvā yāvajīvaṃ anatikkamanīyo.

“A bhikkhunī who has committed a grave offense must undergo penance (pakkhamānatta) in both Saṅghas. This principle too, having been respected, honored, esteemed, and revered, is not to be transgressed as long as life lasts.”

‘‘Dve vassāni chasu dhammesu sikkhitasikkhāya sikkhamānāya ubhatosaṅghe upasampadā pariyesitabbā. Ayampi dhammo sakkatvā garukatvā mānetvā pūjetvā yāvajīvaṃ anatikkamanīyo.

“A trainee bhikkhunī who has trained in the six principles for two years should seek full ordination from both Saṅghas. This principle too, having been respected, honored, esteemed, and revered, should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

‘‘Na bhikkhuniyā kenaci pariyāyena bhikkhu akkositabbo paribhāsitabbo. Ayampi dhammo sakkatvā garukatvā mānetvā pūjetvā yāvajīvaṃ anatikkamanīyo.

“A bhikkhunī must not, under any circumstance, insult or revile a bhikkhu. This principle too, having been respected, honored, esteemed, and revered, should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

‘‘Ajjatagge ovaṭo bhikkhunīnaṃ bhikkhūsu vacanapatho, anovaṭo bhikkhūnaṃ bhikkhunīsu vacanapatho. Ayampi dhammo sakkatvā garukatvā mānetvā pūjetvā yāvajīvaṃ anatikkamanīyo.

“From today onward, bhikkhunīs are prohibited from addressing bhikkhus, but bhikkhus are not prohibited from addressing bhikkhunīs. This principle too, having been respected, honored, esteemed, and revered, should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.”

‘‘Sace, ānanda, mahāpajāpati gotamī ime aṭṭha garudhamme paṭiggaṇhāti, sāvassā hotu upasampadā’’ti.

“If, Ānanda, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī undertakes these eight weighty principles, that will constitute her full ordination.”

Atha kho āyasmā ānando bhagavato santike aṭṭha garudhamme uggahetvā yena mahāpajāpati gotamī tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā mahāpajāpatiṃ gotamiṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sace kho tvaṃ, gotami, aṭṭha garudhamme paṭiggaṇheyyāsi, sāva te bhavissati upasampadā.

Then the Venerable Ānanda, having learned the eight weighty principles from the Blessed One, went to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī and said to her: “If you, Gotamī, accept these eight weighty principles, that will constitute your full ordination.”

‘‘Vassasatūpasampannāya bhikkhuniyā tadahupasampannassa bhikkhuno abhivādanaṃ paccuṭṭhānaṃ añjalikammaṃ sāmīcikammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Ayampi dhammo sakkatvā garukatvā mānetvā pūjetvā yāvajīvaṃ anatikkamanīyo.

“From today onward, bhikkhunīs are prohibited from addressing bhikkhus, but bhikkhus are not prohibited from addressing bhikkhunīs. This principle too, having been respected, honored, esteemed, and revered, should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.”

‘‘Sace kho tvaṃ, gotami, ime aṭṭha garudhamme paṭiggaṇheyyāsi, sāva te bhavissati upasampadā’’ti.

“If you, Gotamī, were to accept these eight weighty principles, that will be your full ordination.”

‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhante ānanda, itthī vā puriso vā daharo, yuvā, maṇḍanakajātiko sīsaṃnahāto uppalamālaṃ vā vassikamālaṃ vā atimuttakamālaṃ [adhimattakamālaṃ (syā.)] vā labhitvā ubhohi hatthehi paṭiggahetvā uttamaṅge sirasmiṃ patiṭṭhāpeyya; evameva kho ahaṃ, bhante, ānanda ime aṭṭha garudhamme paṭiggaṇhāmi yāvajīvaṃ anatikkamanīye’’ti.

“Just as, Venerable Ānanda, a woman or man, young and fond of adornment, having bathed their head, might receive a garland of lotuses, jasmine, or atimuttaka flowers, and with both hands respectfully place it atop their head—so too, Venerable Ānanda, do I accept these eight weighty principles, not to be transgressed as long as life lasts.”

Atha kho āyasmā ānando yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā ānando bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘paṭiggahitā, bhante, mahāpajāpatiyā gotamiyā aṭṭha garudhammā, upasampannā bhagavato mātucchā’’ti.

Then Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī has accepted the eight weighty principles, and the Blessed One’s maternal aunt is now fully ordained.”

‘‘Sace, ānanda, nālabhissa mātugāmo tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajjaṃ, ciraṭṭhitikaṃ, ānanda, brahmacariyaṃ abhavissa, vassasahassaṃ saddhammo tiṭṭheyya. Yato ca kho, ānanda, mātugāmo tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajito, na dāni, ānanda, brahmacariyaṃ ciraṭṭhitikaṃ bhavissati. Pañceva dāni, ānanda, vassasatāni saddhammo ṭhassati.

“Ānanda, if women had not obtained the going forth from home to homelessness in the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, the spiritual life would have lasted long, the good Dhamma would have endured for a thousand years. But since, Ānanda, women have now obtained the going forth from home to homelessness in the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, now, Ānanda, the spiritual life will not last long. Now, Ānanda, the good Dhamma will endure for only five hundred years.

‘‘Seyyathāpi, ānanda, yāni kānici kulāni bahutthikāni [bahuitthikāni (sī. syā.)] appapurisakāni, tāni suppadhaṃsiyāni honti corehi kumbhathenakehi; evameva kho, ānanda, yasmiṃ dhammavinaye labhati mātugāmo agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajjaṃ, na taṃ brahmacariyaṃ ciraṭṭhitikaṃ hoti.

“Just as, Ānanda, any families with many women and few men are easily ruined by thieves and robbers, so too, Ānanda, in whatever Dhamma-Vinaya women obtain the going forth from home to homelessness, that spiritual life does not last long.

‘‘Seyyathāpi, ānanda, sampanne sālikkhette setaṭṭikā nāma rogajāti nipatati, evaṃ taṃ sālikkhettaṃ na ciraṭṭhitikaṃ hoti; evameva kho, ānanda, yasmiṃ dhammavinaye labhati mātugāmo agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajjaṃ, na taṃ brahmacariyaṃ ciraṭṭhitikaṃ hoti.

“Just as, Ānanda, when a disease called white borer falls upon a flourishing rice field, that rice field does not last long; so too, Ānanda, in whatever Dhamma-Vinaya women gain the going forth from home to homelessness, that spiritual life does not last long.

‘‘Seyyathāpi, ānanda, sampanne ucchukkhette mañjiṭṭhikā [mañjeṭṭhikā (sī. syā.)] nāma rogajāti nipatati, evaṃ taṃ ucchukkhettaṃ na ciraṭṭhitikaṃ hoti; evameva kho, ānanda, yasmiṃ dhammavinaye labhati mātugāmo agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajjaṃ, na taṃ brahmacariyaṃ ciraṭṭhitikaṃ hoti.

“Just as, Ānanda, when in a flourishing sugarcane field a disease called red rot falls, that sugarcane field does not last long; so too, Ānanda, in whatever Dhamma-Vinaya women obtain the going forth from home to homelessness, that spiritual life does not last long.

‘‘Seyyathāpi, ānanda, puriso mahato taḷākassa paṭikacceva āḷiṃ bandheyya yāvadeva udakassa anatikkamanāya; evameva kho, ānanda, mayā paṭikacceva bhikkhunīnaṃ aṭṭha garudhammā paññattā yāvajīvaṃ anatikkamanīyā’’ti.

“Just as, Ānanda, a man might build a dike around a great lake as a precaution to prevent the water from overflowing—so too, Ānanda, as a precaution I have laid down these eight weighty principles for bhikkhunīs, not to be transgressed as long as life lasts.”

Bhikkhunīnaṃ aṭṭha garudhammā niṭṭhitā.

The Eight Weighty Principles for Bhikkhunīs are concluded.

Bhikkhunīupasampadānujānanaṃ

The Authorization of the Higher Ordination for Nuns.

404. Atha kho mahāpajāpati gotamī yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi. Ekamantaṃ ṭhitā kho mahāpajāpatī gotamī bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kathāhaṃ, bhante, imāsu sākiyānīsu paṭipajjāmī’’ti? Atha kho bhagavā mahāpajāpatiṃ gotamiṃ dhammiyā kathāya sandassesi samādapesi samuttejesi sampahaṃsesi. Atha kho mahāpajāpati gotamī bhagavatā dhammiyā kathāya sandassitā samādapitā samuttejitā sampahaṃsitā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṃ katvā pakkāmi. Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi bhikkhuniyo upasampādetu’’nti.

404.Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Blessed One; having paid homage to him, she stood to one side. Standing to one side, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the Blessed One: “How, Bhante, should I conduct myself concerning these Sakyan women?” Then the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, aroused, and gladdened Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī with a Dhamma talk. Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, having been instructed, encouraged, aroused, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping him to her right, and departed. Then the Blessed One, on that occasion, in connection with that matter, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, I allow that bhikkhus may confer the higher ordination on bhikkhunīs.”

Atha kho tā bhikkhuniyo mahāpajāpatiṃ gotamiṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘ayyā anupasampannā, mayañcamhā upasampannā; evañhi bhagavatā paññattaṃ bhikkhūhi bhikkhuniyo upasampādetabbā’’ti. Atha kho mahāpajāpati gotamī yenāyasmā ānando tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi. Ekamantaṃ ṭhitā kho mahāpajāpati gotamī āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘imā maṃ, bhante ānanda, bhikkhuniyo evamāhaṃsu – ‘ayyā anupasampannā, mayañcamhā upasampannā; evañhi bhagavatā paññattaṃ bhikkhūhi bhikkhuniyo upasampādetabbā’’’ti.

Then those bhikkhunīs said to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Ayyā, you are not fully ordained, while we are fully ordained. For thus has it been laid down by the Blessed One that bhikkhus should confer the higher ordination on bhikkhunīs.” Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Venerable Ānanda; having paid homage to him, she stood to one side. Standing to one side, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the Venerable Ānanda: “Bhante Ānanda, these bhikkhunīs say to me: ‘Ayyā, you are not fully ordained, while we are fully ordained. For thus has it been laid down by the Blessed One that bhikkhus should confer the higher ordination on bhikkhunīs.’”

Atha kho āyasmā ānando yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā ānando bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘mahāpajāpati, bhante, gotamī evamāha – ‘imā maṃ, bhante ānanda, bhikkhuniyo evamāhaṃsu – ayyā anupasampannā, mayañcamhā upasampannā; evañhi bhagavatā paññattaṃ bhikkhūhi bhikkhuniyo upasampādetabbā’’’ti.

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One; having paid homage to him, he sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī says: ‘Bhante Ānanda, these bhikkhunīs say to me: “Ayyā is not fully ordained, while we are fully ordained; for thus has it been laid down by the Blessed One that bhikkhus should confer the higher ordination on bhikkhunīs.”’”

‘‘Yadaggena, ānanda, mahāpajāpatiyā gotamiyā aṭṭha garudhammā paṭiggahitā, tadeva sā [tadevassā (ka.)] upasampannā’’ti.

“Ānanda, when Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī undertook the eight weighty principles, then and there she was fully ordained.”

405. Atha kho mahāpajāpati gotamī yenāyasmā ānando tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi. Ekamantaṃ ṭhitā kho mahāpajāpati gotamī āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘ekāhaṃ, bhante ānanda, bhagavantaṃ varaṃ yācāmi. Sādhu, bhante, bhagavā anujāneyya bhikkhūnañca bhikkhunīnañca yathāvuḍḍhaṃ abhivādanaṃ paccuṭṭhānaṃ añjalikammaṃ sāmīcikamma’’nti.

405.Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Venerable Ānanda; having paid homage to him, she stood to one side. Standing to one side, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the Venerable Ānanda: “Bhante Ānanda, I ask the Blessed One for one boon. It would be good, Bhante, if the Blessed One would allow bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs to exchange greetings, rise up for, salute with joined palms, and perform proper duties according to seniority.”

Atha kho āyasmā ānando yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā ānando bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘mahāpajāpati, bhante, gotamī evamāha – ‘ekāhaṃ, bhante ānanda, bhagavantaṃ varaṃ yācāmi. Sādhu, bhante, bhagavā anujāneyya bhikkhūnañca bhikkhunīnañca yathāvuḍḍhaṃ abhivādanaṃ paccuṭṭhānaṃ añjalikammaṃ sāmīcikamma’’’nti.

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One; having paid homage to him, he sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī says: ‘Bhante Ānanda, I ask the Blessed One for one boon. It would be good, Bhante, if the Blessed One would allow bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs to exchange greetings, rise up for, salute with joined palms, and perform proper duties according to seniority.’”

‘‘Aṭṭhānametaṃ, ānanda, anavakāso, yaṃ tathāgato anujāneyya mātugāmassa abhivādanaṃ paccuṭṭhānaṃ añjalikammaṃ sāmīcikammaṃ. Imehi nāma, ānanda, aññatitthiyā durakkhātadhammā mātugāmassa abhivādanaṃ paccuṭṭhānaṃ añjalikammaṃ sāmīcikammaṃ na karissanti; kimaṅgaṃ pana tathāgato anujānissati mātugāmassa abhivādanaṃ paccuṭṭhānaṃ añjalikammaṃ sāmīcikamma’’nti?

“Ānanda, it is impossible, it cannot happen that the Tathāgata would allow women to be greeted, risen up for, saluted with joined palms, or accorded proper duties. Ānanda, even other sectarians, whose doctrines are poorly expounded, would not greet women, rise up for them, salute them with joined palms, or accord them proper duties; how much less then would the Tathāgata allow women to be greeted, risen up for, saluted with joined palms, or accorded proper duties?”

Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṃ nidāne etasmiṃ pakaraṇe dhammiṃ kathaṃ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘na, bhikkhave, mātugāmassa abhivādanaṃ paccuṭṭhānaṃ añjalikammaṃ sāmīcikammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Yo kareyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

Then the Blessed One, on that occasion, in connection with that matter, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, a woman should not be greeted, risen up for, saluted with joined palms, or accorded proper duties. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong-doing.”

Atha kho mahāpajāpati gotamī yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi. Ekamantaṃ ṭhitā kho mahāpajāpati gotamī bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘yāni tāni, bhante, bhikkhunīnaṃ sikkhāpadāni bhikkhūhi sādhāraṇāni, kathaṃ mayaṃ, bhante, tesu sikkhāpadesu paṭipajjāmā’’ti? ‘‘Yāni tāni, gotami, bhikkhunīnaṃ sikkhāpadāni bhikkhūhi sādhāraṇāni, yathā bhikkhū sikkhanti tathā tesu sikkhāpadesu sikkhathā’’ti. ‘‘Yāni pana tāni, bhante, bhikkhunīnaṃ sikkhāpadāni bhikkhūhi asādhāraṇāni, kathaṃ mayaṃ, bhante, tesu sikkhāpadesu paṭipajjāmā’’ti? ‘‘Yāni tāni, gotami, bhikkhunīnaṃ sikkhāpadāni bhikkhūhi asādhāraṇāni, yathāpaññattesu sikkhāpadesu sikkhathā’’ti.

Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Blessed One; having paid homage to him, she stood to one side. Standing to one side, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, those training rules for bhikkhunīs that are shared with bhikkhus, how should we practice with regard to those training rules?” “Gotamī, those training rules for bhikkhunīs that are shared with bhikkhus, you should train in them as bhikkhus train.” “But, Bhante, those training rules for bhikkhunīs that are not shared with bhikkhus, how should we practice with regard to those training rules?” “Gotamī, those training rules for bhikkhunīs that are not shared with bhikkhus, you should train in them as they have been laid down.”

406. [a. ni. 8.53] Atha kho mahāpajāpati gotamī yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi. Ekamantaṃ ṭhitā kho mahāpajāpati gotamī bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sādhu me, bhante, bhagavā saṃkhittena dhammaṃ desetu, yamahaṃ bhagavato dhammaṃ sutvā ekā vūpakaṭṭhā appamattā ātāpinī pahitattā vihareyya’’nti. ‘‘Ye kho tvaṃ, gotami, dhamme jāneyyāsi – ime dhammā sarāgāya saṃvattanti no virāgāya, saññogāya saṃvattanti no visaññogāya, ācayāya saṃvattanti no apacayāya, mahicchatāya saṃvattanti no appicchatāya, asantuṭṭhiyā saṃvattanti no santuṭṭhiyā, saṅgaṇikāya saṃvattanti no pavivekāya, kosajjāya saṃvattanti no vīriyārambhāya, dubbharatāya saṃvattanti no subharatāya; ekaṃsena, gotami, dhāreyyāsi – neso dhammo, neso vinayo, netaṃ satthusāsananti.

406.Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Blessed One; having paid homage to him, she stood to one side. Standing to one side, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma concisely, so that having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, secluded, diligent, ardent, and resolute.” “Gotamī, those qualities of which you may know: ‘These qualities lead to passion, not to dispassion; to entanglement, not to disentanglement; to accumulation, not to dissolution; to great ambition, not to unambitiousness; to discontent, not to contentment; to gregariousness, not to seclusion; to laziness, not to energetic effort; to being difficult to support, not to being easy to support’—of such, Gotamī, you may definitely conclude: ‘This is not the Dhamma, this is not the Vinaya, this is not the Teacher’s instruction.’ But those qualities of which you may know: ‘These qualities lead to dispassion, not to passion; to disentanglement, not to entanglement; to dissolution, not to accumulation; to unambitiousness, not to great ambition; to contentment, not to discontent; to seclusion, not to gregariousness; to energetic effort, not to laziness; to being easy to support, not to being difficult to support’—of such, Gotamī, you may definitely conclude: ‘This is the Dhamma, this is the Vinaya, this is the Teacher’s instruction.’”

407. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhunīnaṃ pātimokkhaṃ na uddisīyati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhikkhunīnaṃ pātimokkhaṃ uddisitu’’nti. Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kena nu kho bhikkhunīnaṃ pātimokkhaṃ uddisitabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi bhikkhunīnaṃ pātimokkhaṃ uddisitu’’nti.

407.At that time, the bhikkhunīs were not having the Pātimokkha recited. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. [The Blessed One said:] “Bhikkhus, I allow the Pātimokkha to be recited for the bhikkhunīs.” Then the bhikkhus thought: “By whom should the Pātimokkha be recited for the bhikkhunīs?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. [The Blessed One said:] “Bhikkhus, I allow that bhikkhus may recite the Pātimokkha for the bhikkhunīs.”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū bhikkhunupassayaṃ upasaṅkamitvā bhikkhunīnaṃ pātimokkhaṃ uddisanti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘jāyāyo imā imesaṃ, jāriyo imā imesaṃ, idāni ime imāhi saddhiṃ abhiramissantī’’ti! Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi bhikkhunīnaṃ pātimokkhaṃ uddisitabbaṃ. Yo uddiseyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa.

Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi bhikkhunīnaṃ ācikkhituṃ – ‘evaṃ pātimokkhaṃ uddiseyyāthā’’’ti.

At that time bhikkhus approached the bhikkhunīs’ dwelling and recited the Pātimokkha for the bhikkhunīs. People complained, grumbled, and spread it about: “These are their wives, these are their paramours; now they will enjoy themselves with them!” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. [The Blessed One said:] “Bhikkhus, bhikkhus should not recite the Pātimokkha for bhikkhunīs. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong-doing. Bhikkhus, I allow that bhikkhunīs may recite the Pātimokkha for bhikkhunīs.” The bhikkhunīs did not know: “This is how the Pātimokkha should be recited.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. [The Blessed One said:] “Bhikkhus, I allow that bhikkhus may instruct the bhikkhunīs: ‘You should recite the Pātimokkha in this way.’”

408. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhuniyo āpattiṃ na paṭikaronti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, bhikkhuniyā āpatti na paṭikātabbā. Yā na paṭikareyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti. Bhikkhuniyo na jānanti – ‘‘evaṃ āpatti paṭikātabbā’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi bhikkhunīnaṃ ācikkhituṃ – ‘evaṃ āpattiṃ paṭikareyyāthā’’’ti. Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kena nu kho bhikkhunīnaṃ āpatti paṭiggahetabbā’’ti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi bhikkhunīnaṃ āpattiṃ paṭiggahetu’’nti.

408.At that time, the bhikkhunīs did not make amends for their offenses. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. [The Blessed One said:] “Bhikkhus, a bhikkhunī should not fail to make amends for an offense. Whoever does not make amends commits an offense of wrong-doing.” The bhikkhunīs did not know: “This is how an offense should be made amends for.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. [The Blessed One said:] “Bhikkhus, I allow that bhikkhus may instruct the bhikkhunīs: ‘You should make amends for an offense in this way.’” Then the bhikkhus thought: “By whom should the bhikkhunīs’ amends be received?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. [The Blessed One said:] “Bhikkhus, I allow that bhikkhus may receive the bhikkhunīs’ amends.”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhuniyo rathikāyapi byūhepi siṅghāṭakepi bhikkhuṃ passitvā pattaṃ bhūmiyaṃ nikkhipitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā āpattiṃ paṭikaronti.

Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi bhikkhunīnaṃ āpatti paṭiggahetabbā. Yo paṭiggaṇheyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhikkhunīhi bhikkhunīnaṃ āpattiṃ paṭiggahetu’’nti. Bhikkhuniyo na jānanti – ‘‘evaṃ āpatti paṭiggahetabbā’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi bhikkhunīnaṃ ācikkhituṃ – ‘evaṃ āpattiṃ paṭiggaṇheyyāthā’’’ti.

At that time, nuns, upon seeing a monk on the road, in a gathering, or at a crossroads, would place their bowl on the ground, arrange their upper robe over one shoulder, squat on their heels, raise their joined hands, and confess their offenses. People complained, criticized, and murmured, “These are their wives, these are their mistresses; after having dallied at night, now they are asking forgiveness!” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, monks should not receive the nuns’ confession. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong conduct. I allow, monks, nuns to receive the nuns’ confession.” The nuns did not know how to receive a confession. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, monks to instruct the nuns: ‘You should receive a confession like this.’”

409. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhunīnaṃ kammaṃ na kariyati. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhikkhunīnaṃ kammaṃ kātu’’nti. Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kena nu kho bhikkhunīnaṃ kammaṃ kātabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi bhikkhunīnaṃ kammaṃ kātu’’nti.

409.At that time, formal acts were not being performed for the nuns. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, that formal acts be performed for the nuns.” Then the monks thought, “By whom should formal acts be performed for the nuns?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, the monks to perform formal acts for the nuns.”

Tena kho pana samayena katakammā bhikkhuniyo rathikāyapi byūhepi siṅghāṭakepi bhikkhuṃ passitvā pattaṃ bhūmiyaṃ nikkhipitvā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā ukkuṭikaṃ nisīditvā añjaliṃ paggahetvā khamāpenti ‘evaṃ nūna kātabba’nti maññamānā. Manussā tatheva ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘jāyāyo imā imesaṃ, jāriyo imā imesaṃ, rattiṃ vimānetvā idāni khamāpentī’’ti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi bhikkhunīnaṃ kammaṃ kātabbaṃ. Yo kareyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhikkhunīhi bhikkhunīnaṃ kammaṃ kātu’’nti. Bhikkhuniyo na jānanti – ‘‘evaṃ kammaṃ kātabba’’nti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi bhikkhunīnaṃ ācikkhituṃ – ‘evaṃ kammaṃ kareyyāthā’’’ti.

At that time, nuns who had undergone a formal act, upon seeing a monk on the street, in a crowd, or at a crossroads, would place their bowls on the ground, arrange their upper robes over one shoulder, squat on their heels, raise their joined hands, and ask for forgiveness, thinking, “This is how it should be done.” People complained and criticized them, saying, “These are their wives, these are their mistresses; after having dallied at night, now they are asking for forgiveness.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, monks should not perform formal acts for nuns. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, nuns to perform formal acts for nuns.” The nuns did not know how to perform the formal act. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, monks to instruct the nuns: ‘You should perform the act like this.’”

410. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhuniyo saṅghamajjhe bhaṇḍanajātā kalahajātā vivādāpannā aññamaññaṃ mukhasattīhi vitudantā viharanti. Na sakkonti taṃ adhikaraṇaṃ vūpasametuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi bhikkhunīnaṃ adhikaraṇaṃ vūpasametu’’nti.

410.At that time, nuns in the midst of the Sangha were given to quarreling, contention, and disputation, attacking each other with verbal weapons. They were unable to settle the case. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, for monks to settle cases for nuns.”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū bhikkhunīnaṃ adhikaraṇaṃ vūpasamenti. Tasmiṃ kho pana adhikaraṇe vinicchiyamāne dissanti bhikkhuniyo kammappattāyopi āpattigāminiyopi.

At that time monks were settling the disputes of nuns. While a dispute was being investigated, nuns who were liable to formal acts or subject to offenses were seen. The nuns said: “Venerable sirs, may the venerable ones carry out the formal acts for the nuns, may the venerable ones receive the confession of the offenses from the nuns; for the Blessed One has prescribed that monks should settle the disputes of nuns.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, that monks may assign a formal act to nuns and hand it over to the nuns, for the nuns to perform the formal act for the nuns; and that monks may assign an offense to nuns and hand it over to the nuns, for the nuns to receive the confession of the offense.”

At that time, a nun who was Uppalavaṇṇā's pupil had been following the Blessed One for seven years, learning the Discipline. But due to her forgetful nature, whatever she grasped, she forgot. That nun heard: “The Blessed One, it seems, intends to go to Sāvatthī.” Then that nun thought: “I have been following the Blessed One for seven years, learning the Discipline. But due to my forgetful nature, whatever I grasp, I forget. It is difficult for a woman to follow the Teacher for life. How should I proceed?” Then that nun informed the nuns of the matter. The nuns informed the monks of the matter. The monks informed the Blessed One of the matter. “Monks, I allow monks to recite the Discipline to nuns.”

2.The Second Recitation Section

411. Atha kho bhagavā vesāliyaṃ yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena sāvatthi tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena sāvatthi tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū bhikkhuniyo kaddamodakena osiñcanti – appeva nāma amhesu sārajjeyyunti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā bhikkhuniyo kaddamodakena osiñcitabbā. Yo osiñceyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, tassa bhikkhuno daṇḍakammaṃ kātu’’nti. Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kiṃ nu kho daṇḍakammaṃ kātabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Avandiyo so, bhikkhave, bhikkhu bhikkhunisaṅghena kātabbo’’ti.

411.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Vesālī as long as he pleased, set out on a journey toward Sāvatthī. Traveling in stages, he arrived at Sāvatthī. There the Blessed One stayed in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. At that time the group-of-six monks splashed the nuns with muddy water, thinking: "Perhaps they will become attracted to us." They informed the Blessed One of the matter. "Monks, a monk should not splash nuns with muddy water. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong-doing. Monks, I allow disciplinary action to be taken against that monk." Then the monks thought: "What kind of disciplinary action should be taken?" They informed the Blessed One of the matter. "Monks, that monk should be made unworthy of greeting by the community of nuns."

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū kāyaṃ vivaritvā bhikkhunīnaṃ dassenti …pe… ūruṃ vivaritvā bhikkhunīnaṃ dassenti, aṅgajātaṃ vivaritvā bhikkhunīnaṃ dassenti, bhikkhuniyo obhāsenti, bhikkhunīhi saddhiṃ sampayojenti – appeva nāma amhesu sārajjeyyunti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā kāyo vivaritvā bhikkhunīnaṃ dassetabbo, na ūru vivaritvā bhikkhunīnaṃ dassetabbo, na aṅgajātaṃ vivaritvā bhikkhunīnaṃ dassetabbaṃ, na bhikkhuniyo obhāsitabbā, na bhikkhunīhi saddhiṃ sampayojetabbaṃ. Yo sampayojeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, tassa bhikkhuno daṇḍakammaṃ kātu’’nti. Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kiṃ nu kho daṇḍakammaṃ kātabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Avandiyo so, bhikkhave, bhikkhu bhikkhunisaṅghena kātabbo’’ti.

At that time the group-of-six monks exposed their bodies to nuns … exposed their thighs to nuns … exposed their genitals to nuns … flirted with nuns … associated with nuns, thinking, “Perhaps they will become attracted to us.” They informed the Blessed One about this matter. “Monks, a monk should not expose his body to nuns, should not expose his thighs to nuns, should not expose his genitals to nuns, should not flirt with nuns, should not associate with nuns. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong-doing. Monks, I allow disciplinary action to be taken against that monk.” Then the monks had this thought: “What kind of disciplinary action should be taken?” They informed the Blessed One about this matter. “Monks, that monk should be made unworthy of greeting by the community of nuns."

Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhuniyo bhikkhuṃ kaddamodakena osiñcanti – appeva nāma amhesu sārajjeyyunti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, bhikkhuniyā bhikkhu kaddamodakena osiñcitabbo. Yā osiñceyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, tassā bhikkhuniyā daṇḍakammaṃ kātu’’nti. Atha kho bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kiṃ nu kho daṇḍakammaṃ kātabba’’nti? Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi bhikkhave, āvaraṇaṃ kātu’’nti. Āvaraṇe kate na ādiyanti.

At that time the group-of-six nuns splashed a monk with muddy water, thinking, "Perhaps he might become attracted to us." They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, a monk should not be splashed with muddy water by a nun. Whoever splashes him commits an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, that disciplinary action be taken against that nun." Then the monks thought, "What kind of disciplinary action should be taken?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, that she be excluded from the monastery." When she was excluded from the monastery, they did not comply. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, that instruction for her be suspended."

At that time, the nuns of the group of six exposed their bodies to the monks, exposed their breasts to the monks, exposed their thighs to the monks, exposed their genitals to the monks, flirted with the monks, and associated with the monks—thinking, "Perhaps they might become attracted to us."

"Monks, a nun should not expose her body to monks... she should not expose her breasts to monks, she should not expose her thighs to monks, she should not expose her genitals to monks, she should not flirt with monks, she should not associate with monks. If she does so, it is an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, that disciplinary action be taken against such a nun." Then the monks thought, "But what disciplinary action should be taken?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, that she be excluded from the monastery." When she was excluded from the monastery, she did not comply. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "I allow, monks, that instruction for her be suspended." Then the monks thought, "Is it permissible to perform the Uposatha with a nun for whom instruction has been suspended, or is it not permissible?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "No, monks, the Uposatha should not be performed with a nun for whom instruction has been suspended until that matter has been settled."

At that time, four or five bhikkhunīs went to receive instruction. People complained, grumbled, and spread it about, saying, 'These are their wives, these are their mistresses! Now they will enjoy themselves together with these women!' They reported this matter to the Blessed One. 'Monks, four or five bhikkhunīs should not go to receive instruction. If they go, there is an offense of wrong conduct. I allow, monks, two or three bhikkhunīs to go for instruction. Approaching a bhikkhu, arranging the upper robe over one shoulder, paying homage at his feet, squatting down, raising their joined palms, they should say this: "Venerable sir, the Community of Bhikkhunīs pays homage at the feet of the Community of Bhikkhus and requests the opportunity to come for instruction. May the Community of Bhikkhunīs, venerable sir, receive the opportunity to come for instruction." Then, the bhikkhu who recites the Pātimokkha should be approached, and this should be said to him: "Venerable sir, the Community of Bhikkhunīs pays homage at the feet of the Community of Bhikkhus and requests the opportunity to come for instruction. May the Community of Bhikkhunīs, venerable sir, receive the opportunity to come for instruction."

Let the Community of Bhikkhunīs approach him." If there is no bhikkhu designated as an instructor of the bhikkhunīs, the reciter of the Pātimokkha should ask: "Which venerable one is willing to instruct the bhikkhunīs?"

419.Now at that time, a certain nun, as she was dying, said: “After my death, let my belongings go to the Saṅgha.” Thereupon, monks and nuns disputed, saying, “It is ours, it is ours.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, if a nun, as she is dying, should say, ‘After my death, let my belongings go to the Saṅgha,’ the Saṅgha of monks has no authority over it; it belongs solely to the Saṅgha of nuns. If a female trainee, monks… If a female novice, monks, as she is dying, should say, ‘After my death, let my belongings go to the Saṅgha,’ the Saṅgha of monks has no authority over it; it belongs solely to the Saṅgha of nuns. If a monk, monks, as he is dying, should say, ‘After my death, let my belongings go to the Saṅgha,’ the Saṅgha of nuns has no authority over it; it belongs solely to the Saṅgha of monks. If a male novice, monks… If a male lay follower, monks… If a female lay follower, monks… If anyone else, monks, as he or she is dying, should say, ‘After my death, let my belongings go to the Saṅgha,’ the Saṅgha of nuns has no authority over it; it belongs solely to the Saṅgha of monks.”

420.At that time, a certain woman, formerly a wrestler, had gone forth among the bhikkhunīs. Seeing a frail bhikkhu on the street, she struck him with her shoulder and knocked him down. The bhikkhus complained, were annoyed, and criticized: "How could a bhikkhunī strike a bhikkhu?" They reported the matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, a bhikkhunī should not strike a bhikkhu. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, that when a bhikkhunī sees a bhikkhu, she should step aside from a distance and give way."

At that time, a certain woman, whose husband was away, became pregnant by a lover. After aborting the fetus, she said to a nun who frequented her household: "Come, venerable one, take this fetus away in a bowl." Then that nun placed the fetus in a bowl, covered it with her outer robe, and left. Now at that time, a certain alms-collecting monk had made a vow: "Whatever alms I receive first, I will not partake of it without giving it to a monk or a nun." Then that monk saw the nun and said: "Here, sister, accept alms." "Enough, sir," she replied. A second time... a third time, the monk said to the nun: "Here, sister, accept alms." "Enough, sir," she replied. "Sister, I have made a vow: 'Whatever alms I receive first, I will not partake of it without giving it to a monk or a nun.' Here, sister, accept alms." Pressured by the monk, the nun took out the bowl and showed it to him, saying: "Look, sir, there is a fetus in the bowl—but don’t tell anyone." Then that monk complained, criticized, and protested: "How could a nun carry a fetus in a bowl?" He reported the matter to the monks. Those monks who were modest... complained, criticized, and protested: "How could a nun carry a fetus in a bowl?" They informed the Blessed One. "Monks, a nun should not carry a fetus in a bowl. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, that a nun, having seen a monk, may take it out and show him the bowl."

At that time, the nuns of the group of six, upon seeing a monk, would turn their bowls over, showing the bottom. The monks complained, criticized, and protested: "How can the nuns of the group of six, upon seeing a monk, turn their bowls over, showing the bottom?" Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, a nun should not, upon seeing a monk, turn her bowl over, showing the bottom. Whoever does so commits an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, that a nun, upon seeing a monk, may turn her bowl upright and show it. And the monk should be invited with whatever food is in the bowl."

At that time in Savatthi, a male genital had been discarded in the street. The nuns carefully scrutinized it. People raised an outcry. Those nuns felt ashamed. Then those nuns went to the nunnery and reported the matter to the nuns. Those nuns who were modest… complained and criticized, saying: "How could nuns scrutinize a male genital?" Then those nuns reported the matter to the monks. The monks reported the matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, a nun should not scrutinize a male genital. Whoever would scrutinize it, there is an offense of wrong-doing."

421. Tena kho pana samayena manussā bhikkhūnaṃ āmisaṃ denti. Bhikkhū bhikkhunīnaṃ denti. Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma bhadantā attano paribhogatthāya dinnaṃ aññesaṃ dassanti! Mayampi na jānāma dānaṃ dātu’’nti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, attano paribhogatthāya dinnaṃ aññesaṃ dātabbaṃ. Yo dadeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

421.At that time, people were giving material gifts to the monks. The monks were giving them to the nuns. People complained and criticized, saying: "How can these venerables give to others what was given for their own use? Don't we also know how to give alms?" They reported this matter to the Blessed One. "Monks, what is given for one’s own use should not be given to others. Whoever gives it commits an offense of wrong-doing."

At that time people were giving alms to the bhikkhunīs. The bhikkhunīs were giving them to the bhikkhus. People complained, grumbled, and criticized: “How can the bhikkhunīs give to others what was given for their own use? Do we not know how to give alms?” They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, a bhikkhunī should not give to others what was given for her own use. Whoever gives it commits an offense of wrong conduct.”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhunīnaṃ āmisaṃ ussannaṃ hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, saṅghassa dātu’’nti. Bāḷhataraṃ ussannaṃ hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, puggalikampi dātu’’nti.

At that time alms were abundant for the bhikkhunīs. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow it to be given to the Saṅgha.” It became even more abundant. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow it to be given to individuals as well.”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhunīnaṃ sannidhikataṃ āmisaṃ ussannaṃ hoti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhikkhunīnaṃ sannidhiṃ bhikkhūhi bhikkhunīhi [bhikkhūhi bhikkhunīhi (sī.)] paṭiggāhāpetvā paribhuñjitu’’nti.

At that time the bhikkhunīs had an abundance of stored alms. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow the bhikkhunīs to have their stored provisions received by bhikkhus or bhikkhunīs and then consume them.”

422. Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhūnaṃ senāsanaṃ ussannaṃ hoti, bhikkhunīnaṃ [bhikkhunīnaṃ senāsanaṃ (syā. kaṃ.)] na hoti. Bhikkhuniyo bhikkhūnaṃ santike dūtaṃ pāhesuṃ – ‘sādhu, bhante, ayyā amhākaṃ senāsanaṃ dentu tāvakālika’nti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, bhikkhunīnaṃ senāsanaṃ dātuṃ tāvakālika’’nti.

422.At that time lodgings were abundant for the bhikkhus, but not for the bhikkhunīs. The bhikkhunīs sent a messenger to the bhikkhus, saying: “Venerable sirs, may the venerable ones please give us temporary lodgings.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow temporary lodgings to be given to the bhikkhunīs.”

Tena kho pana samayena utuniyo bhikkhuniyo onaddhamañcaṃ onaddhapīṭhaṃ abhinisīdantipi abhinipajjantipi. Senāsanaṃ lohitena makkhiyyati.

At that time menstruating bhikkhunīs sat or lay down on couches and chairs with coverings. The lodgings became stained with blood. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, a bhikkhunī should not sit or lie down on a couch or chair with a covering. Whoever sits or lies down commits an offense of wrong conduct. Monks, I allow a residence cloth.” The residence cloth became stained with blood. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow a small cloth.” The small cloth fell off. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow it to be tied with a string and fastened around the thigh.” The string snapped. They reported the matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow a saṃvelli and a waist-string.”

At that time the bhikkhunīs of the group of six wore waist-strings at all times. People complained, grumbled, and criticized: “Just like householders who enjoy sensual pleasures.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, a bhikkhunī should not wear a waist-string at all times. Whoever wears it commits an offense of wrong conduct. Monks, I allow a waist-string for a menstruating bhikkhunī.”

3.The third recitation section.

423. Tena kho pana samayena upasampannāyo dissanti – animittāpi, nimittamattāpi, alohitāpi, dhuvalohitāpi, dhuvacoḷāpi, paggharantīpi, sikhariṇīpi, itthipaṇḍakāpi, vepurisikāpi, sambhinnāpi, ubhatobyañjanāpi. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, upasampādentiyā catuvīsati antarāyike dhamme pucchituṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, pucchitabbā – ‘nasi animittā, nasi nimittamattā, nasi alohitā, nasi dhuvalohitā, nasi dhuvacoḷā, nasi paggharantī, nasi sikharaṇī [sikhariṇī (sī. syā.)], nasi itthipaṇḍakā, nasi vepurisikā, nasi sambhinnā, nasi ubhatobyañjanā? Santi te evarūpā ābādhā – kuṭṭhaṃ, gaṇḍo, kilāso, soso, apamāro? Manussāsi, itthīsi, bhujissāsi, aṇaṇāsi, nasi rājabhaṭī? Anuññātāsi mātāpitūhi, sāmikena? Paripuṇṇavīsativassāsi, paripuṇṇaṃ te pattacīvaraṃ, kinnāmāsi, kānāmā te pavattinī’’ti?

423.At that time fully ordained bhikkhunīs were seen—some without signs, some with mere signs, some without blood, some with constant blood, some with constant stains, some discharging, some sikhariṇī, some female eunuchs, some viragos, some mixed, some with both sets of organs. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow the ordainer to ask about the twenty-four obstructive conditions. And, monks, they should be asked thus: ‘Are you not without signs? Are you not with mere signs? Are you not without blood? Are you not with constant blood? Are you not with constant stains? Are you not discharging? Are you not sikhariṇī? Are you not a female eunuch? Are you not a virago? Are you not mixed? Are you not with both sets of organs? Do you have such diseases—leprosy, boils, dry leprosy, consumption, epilepsy? Are you a human being? Are you a woman? Are you free? Are you debt-free? Are you not a royal servant? Have you been permitted by your parents and husband? Are you fully twenty years old? Is your bowl and robe complete? What is your name? What is your preceptress’s name?’”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhū bhikkhunīnaṃ antarāyike dhamme pucchanti. Upasampadāpekkhāyo vitthāyanti, maṅkū honti, na sakkonti vissajjetuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, ekatoupasampannāya bhikkhunisaṅghe visuddhāya bhikkhusaṅghe upasampādetu’’nti.

At that time bhikkhus were questioning bhikkhunīs about the obstructive conditions. The candidates for ordination became embarrassed, hesitant, and unable to answer. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow a bhikkhunī who has been ordained in one (assembly) and purified in the Order of Bhikkhunīs to be ordained in the Order of Bhikkhus.”

Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhuniyo ananusiṭṭhā upasampadāpekkhāyo antarāyike dhamme pucchanti. Upasampadāpekkhāyo vitthāyanti, maṅkū honti, na sakkonti vissajjetuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, paṭhamaṃ anusāsitvā pacchā antarāyike dhamme pucchitu’’nti.

At that time the bhikkhunīs, without having been instructed, asked the candidates for ordination about the obstructive conditions. The candidates for ordination became embarrassed, hesitant, and unable to answer. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow that after first instructing them, they may then ask about the obstructive conditions.”

Tattheva saṅghamajjhe anusāsanti. Upasampadāpekkhāyo tatheva vitthāyanti, maṅkū honti, na sakkonti vissajjetuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, ekamantaṃ anusāsitvā saṅghamajjhe antarāyike dhamme pucchituṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, anusāsitabbā.

They instructed right there in the midst of the Saṅgha. The candidates for ordination still became embarrassed, hesitant, and unable to answer. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow that after instructing them aside, they may question them about the obstructive conditions in the midst of the Saṅgha. And, monks, they should be instructed thus:

424. ‘‘Paṭhamaṃ upajjhaṃ gāhāpetabbā. Upajjhaṃ gāhāpetvā pattacīvaraṃ ācikkhitabbaṃ – ‘ayaṃ te patto, ayaṃ saṅghāṭi, ayaṃ uttarāsaṅgo, ayaṃ antaravāsako, idaṃ saṃkaccikaṃ [saṅkacchikaṃ (syā.)], ayaṃ udakasāṭikā; gaccha amumhi okāse tiṭṭhāhī’’ti.

424.“First, she should be caused to take a preceptor. Having caused her to take a preceptor, the bowl and robes should be shown: ‘This is your bowl, this is the double robe, this is the upper robe, this is the lower robe, this is the saṃkaccika, this is the bathing cloth; go and stand in that spot.’”

Bālā abyattā anusāsanti. Duranusiṭṭhā upasampadāpekkhāyo vitthāyanti, maṅkū honti, na sakkonti vissajjetuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, bālāya abyattāya anusāsitabbā. Yā anusāseyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, byattāya bhikkhuniyā paṭibalāya anusāsitu’’nti.

Foolish and inexpert bhikkhunīs gave the instruction. The candidates for ordination, poorly instructed, became embarrassed, hesitant, and unable to answer. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, a foolish and inexpert bhikkhunī should not give the instruction. Whoever gives it commits an offense of wrong conduct. Monks, I allow a competent and capable bhikkhunī to give the instruction.”

Asammatā anusāsanti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, asammatāya anusāsitabbā. Yā anusāseyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sammatāya anusāsituṃ. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, sammannitabbā – attanā vā attānaṃ sammannitabbaṃ, parāya vā parā sammannitabbā.

Unauthorized bhikkhunīs gave the instruction. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, an unauthorized bhikkhunī should not give the instruction. Whoever gives it commits an offense of wrong conduct. Monks, I allow an authorized bhikkhunī to give the instruction. And, monks, she should be authorized thus—either she should authorize herself, or another should authorize her.”

‘‘Kathañca attanāva [attanā vā (ka.)] attānaṃ sammannitabbaṃ? Byattāya bhikkhuniyā paṭibalāya saṅgho ñāpetabbo – ‘suṇātu me, ayye, saṅgho. Itthannāmā itthannāmāya ayyāya upasampadāpekkhā. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, ahaṃ itthannāmā itthannāmaṃ anusāseyya’nti. Evaṃ attanāva attānaṃ sammannitabbaṃ.

“And how should she authorize herself? A competent and capable bhikkhunī should inform the Saṅgha: ‘Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha listen to me. So-and-so is a candidate for ordination under Venerable So-and-so. If it is suitable for the Saṅgha, I, So-and-so, will instruct So-and-so.’ Thus should she authorize herself.”

‘‘Kathañca parāya [parāya vā (ka.)] parā sammannitabbā? Byattāya bhikkhuniyā paṭibalāya saṅgho ñāpetabbo – ‘suṇātu me, ayye, saṅgho. Itthannāmā itthannāmāya ayyāya upasampadāpekkhā. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, itthannāmā itthannāmaṃ anusāseyyā’ti. Evaṃ parāya parā sammannitabbā.

“And how should another authorize another? A competent and capable bhikkhunī should inform the Saṅgha: ‘Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha listen to me. So-and-so is a candidate for ordination under Venerable So-and-so. If it is suitable for the Saṅgha, So-and-so should instruct So-and-so.’ Thus should another be authorized by another.”

‘‘Tāya sammatāya bhikkhuniyā upasampadāpekkhaṃ upasaṅkamitvā evamassa vacanīyā – ‘suṇasi itthannāme. Ayaṃ te saccakālo, bhūtakālo. Yaṃ jātaṃ taṃ saṅghamajjhe pucchante santaṃ atthīti vattabbaṃ, asantaṃ natthīti vattabbaṃ. Mā kho vitthāyi [vitthāsi (ka.)], mā kho maṅku ahosi. Evaṃ taṃ pucchissanti – nasi animittā, nasi nimittamattā, nasi alohitā, nasi dhuvalohitā, nasi dhuvacoḷā, nasi paggharantī, nasi sikhariṇī, nasi itthipaṇḍakā, nasi vepurisikā, nasi sambhinnā, nasi ubhatobyañjanā? Santi te evarūpā ābādhā – kuṭṭhaṃ, gaṇḍo, kilāso, soso, apamāro? Manussāsi, itthīsi, bhujissāsi, aṇaṇāsi, nasi rājabhaṭī? Anuññātāsi mātāpitūhi, sāmikena? Paripuṇṇavīsativassāsi, paripuṇṇaṃ te pattacīvaraṃ, kinnāmāsi, kānāmā te pavattinī’ti?

“Approach that bhikkhunī, duly appointed, who is seeking full ordination and say to her: ‘Listen, so-and-so. This is your time of truth, the time of reality. Whatever has arisen, that you must declare in the midst of the Sangha when questioned: if it exists, it should be said to exist; if it does not exist, it should be said not to exist. Do not be evasive, do not be embarrassed. They will question you thus: Are you not without the characteristic marks (of a woman)? Are you not one who is merely outwardly a woman?

At that time, bhikkhunīs—thinking that the Blessed One had allowed seating for eight bhikkhunīs according to seniority, and the rest according to arrival—everywhere obstructed, insisting on seniority for the eight bhikkhunīs, and for the rest, according to arrival.

429.At that time the nuns of the group of six were travelling by vehicle—vehicles yoked with women, or with men; and vehicles yoked with men, or with women. People complained and criticized, and spread it about: “Just like pleasure-seekers on the Ganges River.” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, a bhikkhunī should not travel by vehicle. Whoever does so, should be dealt with according to the rule.”

Tena kho pana samayena aññatarā bhikkhunī gilānā hoti, na sakkoti padasā gantuṃ. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, gilānāya yāna’’nti.

At that time, a certain bhikkhunī was sick and unable to go on foot. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, a vehicle for the sick.” Then the bhikkhunīs wondered, “Should it be yoked with women, or yoked with men?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, vehicles yoked with women, with men, or hand-carts.”

Tena kho pana samayena aññatarissā bhikkhuniyā yānugghātena bāḷhataraṃ aphāsu ahosi. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sivikaṃ pāṭaṅki’’nti.

At that time a certain bhikkhunī was severely unwell due to being jolted in a vehicle. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “I allow, monks, a palanquin and a litter.”

430.At that time, the courtesan Aḍḍhakāsī had gone forth among the bhikkhunīs. She wanted to go to Sāvatthī, thinking, “I will receive full ordination in the presence of the Blessed One.” Rogues heard, “The courtesan Aḍḍhakāsī wants to go to Sāvatthī.” They lay in wait along the road. The courtesan Aḍḍhakāsī heard, “Rogues are lying in wait along the road.” She sent a messenger to the Blessed One: “I want to receive full ordination; how should I proceed?” Then the Blessed One, on this occasion, in this connection, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks: “I allow, monks, full ordination even by messenger.”

Bhikkhudūtena upasampādenti. Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Na, bhikkhave, bhikkhudūtena upasampādetabbā. Yo upasampādeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassā’’ti.

Yo upasampādeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa. Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, byattāya bhikkhuniyā paṭibalāya dūtena upasampādetunti.

They conferred the full ordination through a bhikkhu-messenger. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, full ordination should not be conferred through a bhikkhu-messenger. Whoever should confer it, there is an offense of wrong-doing.” They conferred the full ordination through a sikkhamānā-messenger… through a sāmaṇera-messenger… through a sāmaṇerī-messenger… through a foolish, incompetent messenger. “Monks, full ordination should not be conferred through a foolish, incompetent messenger. Whoever should confer it, there is an offense of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, full ordination through a competent and able bhikkhunī-messenger.”

“That bhikkhunī messenger should approach the Saṅgha, arrange the upper robe over one shoulder, pay homage at the feet of the monks, kneel down, raise the joined palms, and say this: ‘Venerables, so-and-so is seeking full ordination from the venerable so-and-so. She has been ordained on one side by the Bhikkhunī Saṅgha, she is pure, and she does not come because of some impediment. Venerables, so-and-so requests full ordination from the Saṅgha.

“At that very moment, the shadow should be measured; the season should be declared; the portion of the day should be declared; the communal recitation should be declared; and the bhikkhunīs should be told: ‘You should declare to her the three dependencies and the eight grave offenses.’”

At that time, a certain lay follower had given a storehouse to the Bhikkhunī Saṅgha. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow a storehouse.” The storehouse was not sufficient. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow a residence.” The residence was not sufficient. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow new construction.” The new construction was not sufficient. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow it to be done individually as well.”

432.At that time, a certain woman who was unknowingly pregnant had gone forth among the bhikkhunīs. At the time of her going forth, the pregnancy became apparent. Then that bhikkhunī thought, “How should I deal with this child?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow nurturing [of the child] until that child is able to eat, drink, bathe, and adorn himself by his own nature.”

Atha kho tassā bhikkhuniyā etadahosi – ‘‘mayā ca na labbhā ekikāya vatthuṃ, aññāya ca bhikkhuniyā na labbhā dārakena saha vatthuṃ, kathaṃ nu kho mayā paṭipajjitabba’’nti?

How then should I proceed?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Monks, I allow that one bhikkhunī be appointed to act as a companion for that bhikkhunī. And, monks, she is to be appointed in this way: First, the bhikkhunī should be asked. Having asked her, the Saṅgha should be informed by a competent and able bhikkhunī:

Then the bhikkhunī who was the companion thought: “How should I conduct myself with regard to this child?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, I allow that, apart from sexual intercourse, she may conduct herself with regard to that child as she would with regard to another man.”

433.At that time a certain bhikkhunī had incurred a grave offense and was undergoing the mānatta discipline. Then this bhikkhunī thought: “It is not allowable for me to dwell alone, nor is it allowable for another bhikkhunī to dwell with me. How should I conduct myself?” They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, I allow that a bhikkhunī be appointed and given as a companion to that bhikkhunī. And thus, bhikkhus, she should be appointed. First, the bhikkhunī should be requested. Having requested, the Saṅgha should be informed by a competent and capable bhikkhunī:

434.At that time a certain bhikkhunī renounced the training and apostatized. She then returned and asked the bhikkhunīs for higher ordination. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, it is not by renouncing the training that a bhikkhunī ceases to be a bhikkhunī; it is when she apostatizes that she ceases to be a bhikkhunī.”

At that time the bhikkhunīs, being scrupulous, did not accept greetings from men, or having their hair cut, or their nails cut, or their wounds treated. They reported this matter to the Blessed One. “Bhikkhus, I allow you to accept them.”

If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. Bhikkhus, I allow bathing at a women’s bathing place.”

Tatiyabhāṇavāro niṭṭhito.

The third recitation section is concluded.

Bhikkhunikkhandhako dasamo.

The Tenth Chapter on Bhikkhunīs.

Imasmiṃ khandhake vatthū ekasataṃ.

In this chapter there are one hundred topics.

Tassuddānaṃ –

Its summary:

Pabbajjaṃ gotamī yāci, nānuññāsi tathāgato;Kapilavatthu vesāliṃ, agamāsi vināyako.

Gotamī requested the going forth, but the Tathāgata did not permit it. The Leader went to Kapilavatthu and Vesālī.

Rajokiṇṇena koṭṭhake, ānandassa pavedayi;Bhabboti nayato yāci, mātāti posikāti ca.

She informed Ānanda at the dust-covered gate. She requested fittingly, mentioning “mother” and “nurturer.”

Vassasataṃ tadahu ca, abhikkhupaccāsīsanā;Pavāraṇā garudhammā, dve vassā anakkosanā.

A hundred years, and that very day, the expectation of no bhikkhus; the invitation, the grave rules, two years without reviling.

Ovaṭo ca aṭṭha dhammā, yāvajīvānuvattanā;Garudhammapaṭiggāho sāvassā upasampadā.

The eight rules were laid down, to be followed for life; the acceptance of the grave rules, the higher ordination with dependence.

Vassasahassaṃ pañceva, kumbhathenakasetaṭṭi;Mañjiṭṭhikaupamāhi, evaṃ saddhammahiṃsanā.

A thousand years, and five, pots, hemp, a white stick; similes of madder, and the like, thus the harming of the true Dhamma.

Āḷiṃ bandheyya pāeva, puna saddhammasaṇṭhiti;Upasampādetuṃ ayyā, yathāvuḍḍhābhivādanā.

One should bind the rafters, then the true Dhamma will be re-established; the venerable ones should be given higher ordination, with salutations according to seniority.

Na karissanti kimeva, sādhāraṇāsādhāraṇaṃ;Ovādaṃ pātimokkhañca, kena nu kho upassayaṃ.

They will do nothing, whether shared or unshared; instruction, the Pātimokkha, and by whom is the dwelling supported?

Na jānanti ca ācikkhi, na karonti ca bhikkhuhi;Paṭiggahetuṃ bhikkhūhi, bhikkhunīhi paṭiggaho.

They do not know, nor do they declare it, nor do the bhikkhus do it; receiving by the bhikkhus, receiving by the bhikkhunīs.

Ācikkhi kammaṃ bhikkhūhi, ujjhāyanti bhikkhunīhi vā;Ācikkhituṃ bhaṇḍanañca, ropetvā uppalāya ca.

They inform the bhikkhus of the action, or the bhikkhunīs complain; to inform, quarrels, and planting a lotus for Uppalā.

Sāvatthiyā kaddamoda, avandi kāya ūru ca;Aṅgajātañca obhāsaṃ, sampayojenti vaggikā.

In Sāvatthī, in the mud, they bowed with body and thigh; and the private parts and the radiance, the factionists unite.

Avandiyo daṇḍakammaṃ, bhikkhuniyo tathā puna;Āvaraṇañca ovādaṃ, kappati nu kho pakkami.

The punishment is not to be imposed, nor again on the bhikkhunīs; obstruction and instruction, is it permissible to depart?

Bālā vatthuvinicchayā, ovādaṃ saṅgho pañcahi;Duve tisso na gaṇhanti, bālā gilānagamikaṃ.

Fools are unskilled in deciding a case; the Saṅgha advises in five ways. Two or three do not accept it; fools and the sick go astray.

Āraññiko nārocenti, na paccāgacchanti ca;Dīghaṃ vilīvacammañca, dussā ca veṇivaṭṭi ca;Coḷaveṇi ca vaṭṭi ca, suttaveṇi ca vaṭṭikā.

Those dwelling in the forest do not please them, nor do they come back; long garments of cast-off hides, and cloths with hair-borders, and short skirts with borders, and stitched braids with borders.

Aṭṭhillaṃ gohanukena, hatthakocchaṃ pādaṃ tathā;Ūruṃ mukhaṃ dantamaṃsaṃ, ālimpomaddacuṇṇanā.

The ankles, the hollow of the knee, the hand, the foot likewise; the thigh, the face, the gums, they plaster with ointment and powdered perfumes.

Lañchenti aṅgarāgañca, mukharāgaṃ tathā duve;Avaṅgaṃ visesoloko, sālokena naccena ca [sāloke sanaccena ca (sī.), sālokena sanaccanaṃ (syā.)].

They adorn themselves with body paint and face paint, both; and with special ornaments, the world (is adorned) with looks and dancing.

Vesī pānāgāraṃ sūnaṃ, āpaṇaṃ vaḍḍhi vaṇijjā;Dāsaṃ dāsiṃ kammakaraṃ, kammakāriṃ upaṭṭhayyuṃ.

Courtesans frequented taverns and slaughterhouses; shops and trade flourished. Male and female slaves, and male and female workers attended (to their duties).

Tiracchānaharītaki, sandhārayanti namatakaṃ;Nīlaṃ pītaṃ lohitakaṃ, mañjiṭṭhakaṇhacīvarā.

They wear robes dyed with haritaki, like animals, and they hold a waist cloth; (they wear) blue, yellow, red, madder, and dark robes.

Mahāraṅgamahānāmaacchinnā dīghameva ca;Pupphaphalakañcukañca, tirīṭakañca dhārayuṃ.

They wear garments of great color and great name, uncut and long; and garments with flower designs, jackets, and tiaras.

Bhikkhunī sikkhamānāya, sāmaṇerāya accaye;Niyyādite parikkhāre, bhikkhuniyova issarā.

When a bhikkhunī in training or a novice nun commits an offense, and requisites are handed over, the bhikkhunīs are the owners.

Bhikkhussa sāmaṇerassa, upāsakassupāsikā;Aññesañca parikkhāre, niyyāte bhikkhuissarā.

When requisites are handed over for a bhikkhu, a novice, a layman, a laywoman, or for others, the bhikkhu is the owner.

Mallī gabbhaṃ pattamūlaṃ, byañjanaṃ āmisena ca;Ussannañca bāḷhataraṃ, sannidhikatamāmisaṃ.

Mallī (food), pulp, food at the base of the bowl, seasoning, and meat; and abundant, very strong, and hoarded meat.

Bhikkhūnaṃ yādisaṃ bhoṭṭhaṃ [heṭṭhā (sī.), heṭṭhaṃ (syā.), bhutti (ka.)], bhikkhunīnaṃ tathā kare;Senāsanaṃ utuniyo, makkhīyati paṭāṇi ca.

Whatever food bhikkhus receive, bhikkhunīs should do likewise. Lodging, menstruation, and cloths should be treated.

Chijjanti sabbakālañca, animittāpi dissare;Nimittā lohitā ceva, tatheva dhuvalohitā.

They are always ceasing, and even signless ones appear; bloody signs indeed, and likewise constant blood.

Dhuvacoḷapaggharantī, sikharaṇitthipaṇḍakā;Vepurisī ca sambhinnā, ubhatobyañjanāpi ca.

Always dripping with moisture, crested ones, pseudo-women, androgynes; and transformed females, the confused, and those with double gender as well.

Animittādito katvā, yāva ubhatobyañjanā;Etaṃ peyyālato heṭṭhā, kuṭṭhaṃ gaṇḍo kilāso ca.

Starting from the signless, up to those with double gender; this is the summary below: leprosy, boil, and eczema.

Sosāpamāro mānusī, itthīsi bhujissāsi ca;Aṇaṇā na rājabhaṭī, anuññātā ca vīsati.

The consumptive, the epileptic, a human woman, a free woman; debt-free, not a king’s soldier, and permitted by twenty (people).

Paripuṇṇā ca kinnāmā, kānāmā te pavattinī;Catuvīsantarāyānaṃ, pucchitvā upasampadā.

And complete, what is your name? Who is your preceptor? Having asked about the twenty-four obstacles, ordination is conferred.

Vitthāyanti ananusiṭṭhā, saṅghamajjhe tatheva ca;Upajjhāgāha saṅghāṭi, uttarantaravāsako.

They expound without being instructed, and likewise in the midst of the Sangha. The preceptor takes the outer robe, the upper robe, and the inner robe.

Saṅkaccudakasāṭi ca, ācikkhitvāna pesaye;Bālā asammatekato, yāce pucchantarāyikā.

The waistcloth and bathing cloth, having explained, she sends. Fools, without consent among themselves, ask about obstacles.

Ekatoupasampannā, bhikkhusaṅghe tathā puna;Chāyā utu divasā ca, saṅgīti tayo nissaye.

Ordained alone, and again in the Bhikkhu Sangha; shade, season, day, and the recitation, these three supports.

Aṭṭha akaraṇīyāni, kālaṃ sabbattha aṭṭheva;Na pavārenti bhikkhunī, bhikkhusaṅghaṃ tatheva ca.

Eight things are not to be done; in all cases, there are eight times. Bhikkhunīs do not invite (admonition), nor does the Bhikkhu Sangha.

Kolāhalaṃ purebhattaṃ, vikāle ca kolāhalaṃ;Uposathaṃ pavāraṇaṃ, savacanīyānuvādanaṃ.

Commotion before the meal, and commotion after hours; the observance day, the ending of retreat, prompting of speech, and formal accusation.

Okāsaṃ code sārenti, paṭikkhittaṃ mahesinā;Tatheva bhikkhu bhikkhunī, anuññātaṃ mahesinā.

They ask for opportunity, accuse, and remind; it was rejected by the Great Sage. Likewise, for bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs, it was permitted by the Great Sage.

Yānaṃ gilānayuttañca, yānugghātaḍḍhakāsikā;Bhikkhu sikkhā sāmaṇera, sāmaṇerī ca bālāya.

The vehicle, the equipment for the sick, the vehicle with a broken axle/yoke and half its price; the bhikkhu, the trainee, the novice, and the novice nun for the foolish girl.

Araññe upāsakena, uddosito upassayaṃ;Na sammati navakammaṃ, nisinnagabbhaekikā.

In the forest, by a lay follower, the dwelling was pointed out; the new construction does not succeed, and she sits alone in her room.

Sāgārañca garudhammaṃ, paccakkhāya ca saṅkami;Abhivādanakesā ca, nakhā ca vaṇakammanā.

Having renounced the household and the heavy rule, they depart; and (they perform) salutation, (and their) hair and nails (are cut) by the barber's work.

Pallaṅkena gilānā ca, vaccaṃ cuṇṇena vāsitaṃ;Jantāghare paṭisote, atitthe purisena ca.

The sick with legs crossed, and excrement perfumed with powder; in the bathhouse, against the current, and unapproachable by a man.

Mahāgotamī āyāci, ānando cāpi yoniso;Parisā catasso honti, pabbajjā jinasāsane.

Mahāgotamī made a request, and Ānanda carefully considered it. The four assemblies were present, and the going forth (ordination) took place in the Dispensation of the Conqueror.

Saṃvegajananatthāya, saddhammassa ca vuddhiyā;Āturassāva bhesajjaṃ, evaṃ buddhena desitaṃ.

To arouse a sense of urgency, and for the increase of the true Dhamma; like medicine for the sick, thus was it taught by the Buddha.

Evaṃ vinītā saddhamme, mātugāmāpi itarā;Yāyanti [tāyanti (sī. syā.)] accutaṃ ṭhānaṃ, yattha gantvā na socareti.

Thus trained in the true Dhamma, even other women go to the deathless state, where, having gone, one grieves no more.
