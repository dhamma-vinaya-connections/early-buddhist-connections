The Account of the Going Forth of the Six Sakyans

330. Tena samayena buddho bhagavā anupiyāyaṃ viharati, anupiyaṃ nāma mallānaṃ nigamo. Tena kho pana samayena abhiññātā abhiññātā sakyakumārā bhagavantaṃ pabbajitaṃ anupabbajanti.

So vassike pāsāde cattāro māse [vassike pāsāde vassike cattāro māse (sī.)] nippurisehi tūriyehi paricārayamāno [paricāriyamāno (ka.)] na heṭṭhāpāsādaṃ orohati. Atha kho mahānāmassa sakkassa etadahosi – ‘‘etarahi kho abhiññātā abhiññātā sakyakumārā bhagavantaṃ pabbajitaṃ anupabbajanti. Amhākañca pana kulā natthi koci agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajito.

Atha kho mahānāmo sakko yena anuruddho sakko tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā anuruddhaṃ sakkaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘etarahi, tāta anuruddha, abhiññātā abhiññātā sakyakumārā bhagavantaṃ pabbajitaṃ anupabbajanti. Amhākañca pana kulā natthi koci agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajito. Tena hi tvaṃ vā pabbaja, ahaṃ vā pabbajissāmī’’ti. ‘‘Ahaṃ kho sukhumālo, nāhaṃ sakkomi agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajituṃ. Tvaṃ pabbajāhī’’ti. ‘‘Ehi kho te, tāta anuruddha, gharāvāsatthaṃ anusāsissāmi. Paṭhamaṃ khettaṃ kasāpetabbaṃ. Kasāpetvā vapāpetabbaṃ. Vapāpetvā udakaṃ abhinetabbaṃ.

Kadā mayaṃ appossukkā pañcahi kāmaguṇehi samappitā samaṅgībhūtā paricāressāmā’’ti? ‘‘Na hi, tāta anuruddha, kammā khīyanti. Na kammānaṃ anto paññāyati.

330.At that time the Blessed One was dwelling at Anupiya, a market town of the Mallas. Now at that time, well-known Sakyan princes were going forth, following the Blessed One, who had gone forth into homelessness. At that time, Mahānāma the Sakyan and Anuruddha the Sakyan were two brothers. Anuruddha the Sakyan was delicate. He had three mansions: one for winter, one for summer, and one for the rainy season. In the rainy-season mansion, he was entertained for four months by orchestras of women, without descending to the lower mansion. Then Mahānāma the Sakyan thought: “Now, well-known Sakyan princes are going forth, following the Blessed One, who had gone forth into homelessness. But from our family, no one has gone forth from the household life into homelessness. Why don’t I go forth, or Anuruddha?” Then Mahānāma the Sakyan approached Anuruddha the Sakyan and said: “Now, dear Anuruddha, well-known Sakyan princes are going forth, following the Blessed One, who had gone forth into homelessness. But from our family, no one has gone forth from the household life into homelessness. So either you go forth, or I will go forth.” “I am delicate. I am not capable of going forth from the household life into homelessness. You go forth.” “Come, dear Anuruddha, I will instruct you in the householder’s duties. First, the field must be plowed. Having plowed, it must be sown. Having sown, water must be brought. Having brought water, it must be drained. Having drained the water, it must be weeded. Having weeded, the crop must be harvested. Having harvested, it must be stacked. Having stacked, it must be threshed. Having threshed, the straw must be removed. Having removed the straw, the chaff must be removed. Having removed the chaff, it must be winnowed. Having winnowed, it must be stored away. Having stored it away, the same must be done next year, and the same must be done the year after.” “Do these tasks ever come to an end? Is an end to these tasks ever seen? When will these tasks come to an end? When will an end to these tasks be seen? When will we, without anxiety, furnished and endowed with the five strands of sensual pleasure, indulge ourselves?” “No, dear Anuruddha, these tasks never come to an end. There is no end to these tasks seen. Even before the tasks are finished, fathers and grandfathers have died.” “Then you yourself understand these householder’s tasks. I will go forth from the household life into homelessness.”

Atha kho anuruddho sakko yena mātā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā mātaraṃ etadavoca – ‘‘icchāmahaṃ, amma, agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajituṃ. Anujānāhi maṃ agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajjāyā’’ti. Evaṃ vutte anuruddhassa sakkassa mātā anuruddhaṃ sakkaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘tumhe kho me, tāta anuruddha, dve puttā piyā manāpā appaṭikūlā. Maraṇenapi vo akāmakā vinā bhavissāmi. Kiṃ panāhaṃ tumhe jīvante anujānissāmi agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajjāyā’’ti? Dutiyampi kho…pe… tatiyampi kho anuruddho sakko mātaraṃ etadavoca – ‘‘icchāmahaṃ, amma, agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajituṃ. Anujānāhi maṃ agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajjāyā’’ti [imassa anantaraṃ kesuci potthakesu evampi pāṭho dissati –- ‘‘evaṃ vutte anuruddhassa sakkassa mātā evamāha ‘sace tāta anuruddha bhaddiyo sakyarājā sakyānaṃ rajjaṃ kāreti agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajati, evaṃ tvampi pabbajāhī’’’ti]. Tena kho pana samayena bhaddiyo sakyarājā sakyānaṃ rajjaṃ kāreti. So ca anuruddhassa sakkassa sahāyo hoti. Atha kho anuruddhassa sakkassa mātā – ‘ayaṃ kho bhaddiyo sakyarājā sakyānaṃ rajjaṃ kāreti; anuruddhassa sakkassa sahāyo; so na ussahati agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajitu’nti – anuruddhaṃ sakkaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sace, tāta anuruddha, bhaddiyo sakyarājā agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajati, evaṃ tvampi pabbajāhī’’ti. Atha kho anuruddho sakko yena bhaddiyo sakyarājā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhaddiyaṃ sakyarājānaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘mama kho, samma, pabbajjā tava paṭibaddhā’’ti. ‘‘Sace te, samma, pabbajjā mama paṭibaddhā vā appaṭibaddhā vā sā hotu, ahaṃ tayā; yathā sukhaṃ pabbajāhī’’ti. ‘‘Ehi, samma, ubho agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajissāmā’’ti. ‘‘Nāhaṃ, samma, sakkomi agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajitunti. Yaṃ te sakkā aññaṃ mayā kātuṃ, kyāhaṃ [tyāhaṃ (sī. syā.)] karissāmi. Tvaṃ pabbajāhī’’ti. ‘‘Mātā kho maṃ, samma, evamāha – ‘sace, tāta anuruddha, bhaddiyo sakyarājā agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajati, evaṃ tvampi pabbajāhī’’’ti. ‘‘Bhāsitā kho pana te, samma, esā vācā. Sace te, samma, pabbajjā mama paṭibaddhā vā, appaṭibaddhā vā sā hotu, ahaṃ tayā; yathā sukhaṃ pabbajāhī’’ti. ‘‘Ehi, samma, ubho agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajissāmā’’ti.

Then Anuruddha the Sakyan approached his mother and said, “Mother, I wish to go forth from the household life into homelessness. Please give me permission to go forth from the household life into homelessness.” When this was said, Anuruddha’s mother said to Anuruddha the Sakyan, “My dear Anuruddha, you two sons are dear and beloved to me, not disagreeable. Even when you die, I will unwillingly be parted from you. How then could I give you permission to go forth from the household life while you are still alive?” A second time… A third time Anuruddha the Sakyan said to his mother, “Mother, I wish to go forth from the household life into homelessness. Please give me permission to go forth from the household life into homelessness.” Now at that time, Bhaddiya the Sakyan king was ruling the Sakyan realm. He was a friend of Anuruddha the Sakyan. Then Anuruddha’s mother thought, “This Bhaddiya the Sakyan king is ruling the Sakyan realm; he is a friend of Anuruddha the Sakyan. He will not be able to go forth from the household life into homelessness.” So she said to Anuruddha the Sakyan, “My dear Anuruddha, if Bhaddiya the Sakyan king goes forth from the household life into homelessness, then you may go forth as well.” Then Anuruddha the Sakyan approached Bhaddiya the Sakyan king and said, “Friend, my going forth is dependent on you.” “Whether your going forth is dependent on me or not, let it be. I am yours; go forth as you please.” “Come, friend, let us both go forth from the household life into homelessness.” “I cannot, friend, go forth from the household life into homelessness. Whatever else I can do for you, what should I do? You go forth.” “Friend, my mother told me, ‘If Bhaddiya the Sakyan king goes forth from the household life into homelessness, then you may go forth as well.’” “But this has been spoken by you, friend. Whether your going forth is dependent on me or not, let it be. I am yours; go forth as you please.” “Come, friend, let us both go forth from the household life into homelessness.”

Tena kho pana samayena manussā saccavādino honti, saccapaṭiññā. Atha kho bhaddiyo sakyarājā anuruddhaṃ sakkaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘āgamehi, samma, sattavassāni. Sattannaṃ vassānaṃ accayena ubho agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajissāmā’’ti. ‘‘Aticiraṃ, samma, sattavassāni. Nāhaṃ sakkomi sattavassāni āgametu’’nti. ‘‘Āgamehi, samma, chavassāni…pe… pañcavassāni… cattāri vassāni… tīṇi vassāni… dve vassāni… ekaṃ vassaṃ. Ekassa vassassa accayena ubho agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajissāmā’’ti. ‘‘Aticiraṃ, samma, ekavassaṃ. Nāhaṃ sakkomi ekaṃ vassaṃ āgametu’’nti. ‘‘Āgamehi, samma, sattamāse. Sattannaṃ māsānaṃ accayena ubhopi agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajissāmā’’ti. ‘‘Aticiraṃ, samma, sattamāsā. Nāhaṃ sakkomi sattamāse āgametu’’nti. ‘‘Āgamehi, samma, cha māse…pe… pañca māse… cattāro māse… tayo māse… dve māse… ekaṃ māsaṃ… aḍḍhamāsaṃ. Aḍḍhamāsassa accayena ubhopi agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajissāmā’’ti. ‘‘Aticiraṃ, samma, aḍḍhamāso. Nāhaṃ sakkomi aḍḍhamāsaṃ āgametu’’nti. ‘‘Āgamehi, samma, sattāhaṃ yāvāhaṃ putte ca bhātaro ca rajjaṃ niyyādemī’’ti. ‘‘Na ciraṃ, samma, sattāho, āgamessāmī’’ti.

At that time, people were truthful and kept their word. Then Bhaddiya the Sakyan king said to Anuruddha the Sakyan, “Wait, friend, for seven years. After seven years have passed, we shall both go forth from the household life into homelessness.” “That’s too long, friend, seven years. I cannot wait seven years.” “Wait, friend, for six years… five years… four years… three years… two years… one year. After one year has passed, we shall both go forth from the household life into homelessness.” “That’s too long, friend, one year. I cannot wait one year.” “Wait, friend, for seven months. After seven months have passed, we shall both go forth from the household life into homelessness.” “That’s too long, friend, seven months. I cannot wait seven months.” “Wait, friend, for six months… five months… four months… three months… two months… one month… half a month. After half a month has passed, we shall both go forth from the household life into homelessness.” “That’s too long, friend, half a month. I cannot wait half a month.” “Wait, friend, for seven days, until I have settled my sons and brothers in the kingdom.” “Seven days is not long, friend, I will wait.”

331. Atha kho bhaddiyo ca sakyarājā anuruddho ca ānando ca bhagu ca kimilo ca devadatto ca, upālikappakena sattamā, yathā pure caturaṅginiyā senāya uyyānabhūmiṃ niyyanti, evameva caturaṅginiyā senāya niyyiṃsu. Te dūraṃ gantvā senaṃ nivattāpetvā paravisayaṃ okkamitvā ābharaṇaṃ omuñcitvā uttarāsaṅgena bhaṇḍikaṃ bandhitvā upāliṃ kappakaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘handa, bhaṇe upāli, nivattassu; alaṃ te ettakaṃ jīvikāyā’’ti. Atha kho upālissa kappakassa nivattantassa etadahosi – ‘‘caṇḍā kho sākiyā; iminā kumārā nippātitāti ghātāpeyyumpi maṃ. Ime hi nāma sakyakumārā agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajissanti. Kimaṅga [kimaṅga (sī.)] panāha’’nti. Bhaṇḍikaṃ muñcitvā taṃ bhaṇḍaṃ rukkhe ālaggetvā ‘yo passati, dinnaṃyeva haratū’ti vatvā yena te sakyakumārā tenupasaṅkami. Addasāsuṃ kho te sakyakumārā upāliṃ kappakaṃ dūratova āgacchantaṃ. Disvāna upāliṃ kappakaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘kissa, bhaṇe upāli, nivattesī’’ti? ‘‘Idha me, ayyaputtā, nivattantassa etadahosi – ‘caṇḍā kho sākiyā; iminā kumārā nippātitāti ghātāpeyyumpi maṃ. Ime hi nāma sakyakumārā agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajissanti. Kimaṅga panāha’nti. So kho ahaṃ, ayyaputtā, bhaṇḍikaṃ muñcitvā taṃ bhaṇḍaṃ rukkhe ālaggetvā ‘yo passati, dinnaññeva haratū’ti vatvā tatomhi paṭinivatto’’ti. ‘‘Suṭṭhu, bhaṇe upāli, akāsi yampi na nivatto [yaṃ nivatto (sī.), yaṃ pana nivatto (syā.)]. Caṇḍā kho sākiyā; iminā kumārā nippātitāti ghātāpeyyumpi ta’’nti.

331.Then Bhaddiya the Sakyan prince, Anuruddha, Ānanda, Bhagu, Kimila, and Devadatta, with Upāli the barber as the seventh, set out with a fourfold army, just as they had previously gone to the pleasure grounds. Having gone a distance, they dismissed the army, entered a foreign territory, took off their ornaments, tied their belongings into bundles with their outer robes, and said to Upāli the barber: “Come, friend Upāli, turn back; this is enough for your livelihood.” Then, as Upāli the barber was turning back, this occurred to him: “The Sakyans are fierce; they might have me killed, thinking, ‘These princes have escaped because of him.’ Indeed, these Sakyan princes are going forth from the household life into homelessness; what then of me?” He untied his bundle, hung that bundle on a tree, saying, “Whoever sees this, let them take it as a gift,” and approached the Sakyan princes. The Sakyan princes saw Upāli the barber coming from afar. Seeing him, they said to Upāli the barber: “Why, friend Upāli, have you turned back?” “As I was turning back, young lords, this occurred to me: ‘The Sakyans are fierce; they might have me killed, thinking, “These princes have escaped because of him.” Indeed, these Sakyan princes are going forth from the household life into homelessness; what then of me?’ So, young lords, I untied my bundle, hung that bundle on a tree, saying, ‘Whoever sees this, let them take it as a gift,’ and have turned back from there.” “Well done, friend Upāli, that you did not turn back. The Sakyans are fierce; they might have you killed, thinking, ‘These princes have escaped because of him.’”

Atha kho sakyakumārā upāliṃ kappakaṃ ādāya yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu. Ekamantaṃ nisinnā kho te sakyakumārā bhagavantaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘mayaṃ, bhante, sākiyā nāma mānassino. Ayaṃ, bhante, upāli kappako amhākaṃ dīgharattaṃ paricārako. Imaṃ bhagavā paṭhamaṃ pabbājetu. Imassa mayaṃ abhivādanapaccuṭṭhānaañjalikammasāmīcikammaṃ karissāma. Evaṃ amhākaṃ sākiyānaṃ sākiyamāno nimmānāyissatī’’ti [nimmādayissatīti (sī.), nimmāniyissatīti (syā.)].

Then the Sakyan princes, taking the barber Upāli, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, those Sakyan princes said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, we Sakyans are known for our pride. This, venerable sir, is Upāli the barber, who has been our attendant for a long time. Let the Blessed One ordain him first. We will then pay homage to him, rise for him, greet him with joined palms, and perform the proper duties towards him. Thus, the pride of us Sakyans will be subdued.”

Atha kho bhagavā upāliṃ kappakaṃ paṭhamaṃ pabbājesi, pacchā te sakyakumāre. Atha kho āyasmā bhaddiyo teneva antaravassena tisso vijjā sacchākāsi. Āyasmā anuruddho dibbacakkhuṃ uppādesi. Āyasmā ānando sotāpattiphalaṃ sacchākāsi. Devadatto pothujjanikaṃ iddhiṃ abhinipphādesi.

Then the Blessed One first ordained the barber Upāli, and afterwards those Sakyan princes. Then, during that same rainy season, Venerable Bhaddiya realized the three knowledges. Venerable Anuruddha developed the divine eye. Venerable Ānanda realized the fruit of stream-entry. Devadatta produced ordinary supernormal power.

332. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā bhaddiyo araññagatopi rukkhamūlagatopi suññāgāragatopi abhikkhaṇaṃ udānaṃ udānesi – ‘‘aho sukhaṃ, aho sukha’’nti. Atha kho sambahulā bhikkhū yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu. Ekamantaṃ nisinnā kho te bhikkhū bhagavantaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘āyasmā, bhante, bhaddiyo araññagatopi rukkhamūlagatopi suññāgāragatopi abhikkhaṇaṃ udānaṃ udānesi – ‘aho sukhaṃ, aho sukha’nti. Nissaṃsayaṃ kho, bhante, āyasmā bhaddiyo anabhiratova brahmacariyaṃ carati. Taṃyeva vā purimaṃ rajjasukhaṃ samanussaranto araññagatopi rukkhamūlagatopi suññāgāragatopi abhikkhaṇaṃ udānaṃ udānesi – ‘aho sukhaṃ, aho sukha’’’nti.

332.At that time, Venerable Bhaddiya, while living in the forest, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, repeatedly uttered this exclamation: “Oh, bliss! Oh, bliss!” Then several monks approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, those monks said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, Venerable Bhaddiya, while living in the forest, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, repeatedly utters this exclamation: ‘Oh, bliss! Oh, bliss!’ Surely, venerable sir, Venerable Bhaddiya is dissatisfied with the holy life. Perhaps he is recalling the former happiness of kingship, and thus, while living in the forest, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, repeatedly utters this exclamation: ‘Oh, bliss! Oh, bliss!’”

Atha kho bhagavā aññataraṃ bhikkhuṃ āmantesi – ‘‘ehi tvaṃ, bhikkhu, mama vacanena bhaddiyaṃ bhikkhuṃ āmantehi – ‘satthā taṃ, āvuso bhaddiya, āmantetī’’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ bhante’’ti kho so bhikkhu bhagavato paṭissutvā yenāyasmā bhaddiyo tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ bhaddiyaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘satthā taṃ, āvuso bhaddiya, āmantetī’’ti. ‘‘Evamāvuso’’ti kho āyasmā bhaddiyo tassa bhikkhuno paṭissutvā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho āyasmantaṃ bhaddiyaṃ bhagavā etadavoca – ‘‘saccaṃ kira tvaṃ, bhaddiya, araññagatopi rukkhamūlagatopi suññāgāragatopi abhikkhaṇaṃ udānaṃ udānesi – ‘aho sukhaṃ, aho sukha’’’nti? ‘‘Evaṃ bhante’’ti. ‘‘Kiṃ pana tvaṃ, bhaddiya, atthavasaṃ sampassamāno araññagatopi rukkhamūlagatopi suññāgāragatopi abhikkhaṇaṃ udānaṃ udānesi – ‘aho sukhaṃ aho sukha’’’nti? ‘‘Pubbe me, bhante, rañño satopi antopi antepure rakkhā susaṃvihitā hoti, bahipi antepure rakkhā susaṃvihitā hoti, antopi nagare rakkhā susaṃvihitā hoti, bahipi nagare rakkhā susaṃvihitā hoti, antopi janapade rakkhā susaṃvihitā hoti, bahipi janapade rakkhā susaṃvihitā hoti.

Atha kho bhagavā etamatthaṃ viditvā tāyaṃ velāyaṃ imaṃ udānaṃ udānesi –

Then the Blessed One addressed a certain monk: “Come, monk, go in my name and call Venerable Bhaddiya, saying, ‘The Teacher, friend Bhaddiya, calls you.’” “Yes, venerable sir,” that monk replied to the Blessed One. Then he went to Venerable Bhaddiya and said, “The Teacher, friend Bhaddiya, calls you.” “Yes, friend,” Venerable Bhaddiya replied to that monk. Then he went to the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One said to Venerable Bhaddiya: “Is it true, Bhaddiya, that when you go to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, you repeatedly utter the exclamation, ‘Oh, bliss! Oh, bliss!’?” “Yes, venerable sir.” “But what advantage do you see, Bhaddiya, that when you go to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, you repeatedly utter the exclamation, ‘Oh, bliss! Oh, bliss!’?” “Formerly, venerable sir, when I was a king, there was very well-arranged protection inside the inner palace, very well-arranged protection outside the inner palace, inside the city, outside the city, inside the countryside, and outside the countryside. So, venerable sir, even so protected and guarded, I lived in fear, agitated, apprehensive, and terrified. But now, venerable sir, when I go alone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, I live without fear, without agitation, without apprehension, without terror, carefree, at ease, dependent on others for sustenance, with a mind like a wild deer. Seeing this advantage, venerable sir, when I go to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, I repeatedly utter the exclamation, ‘Oh, bliss! Oh, bliss!’” Then the Blessed One, having understood the meaning of this, on that occasion uttered this inspired utterance:

[udā. 20] ‘‘Yassantarato na santi kopā, iti bhavābhavatañca vītivatto;Taṃ vigatabhayaṃ sukhiṃ asokaṃ, devā nānubhavanti dassanāyā’’ti.

He who has no inner rage, who has transcended becoming and not-becoming; That one, free from fear, happy, without sorrow – even the gods do not have the power to behold.

Devadattavatthu

The Story of Devadatta

333. Atha kho bhagavā anupiyāyaṃ yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena kosambī tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena kosambī tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā kosambiyaṃ viharati ghositārāme. Atha kho devadattassa rahogatassa paṭisallīnassa evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – ‘‘kaṃ nu kho ahaṃ pasādeyyaṃ, yasmiṃ me pasanne bahulābhasakkāro uppajjeyyā’’ti? Atha kho devadattassa etadahosi – ‘‘ayaṃ kho ajātasattu kumāro taruṇo ceva āyatiṃ bhaddo ca. Yaṃnūnāhaṃ ajātasattuṃ kumāraṃ pasādeyyaṃ. Tasmiṃ me pasanne bahulābhasakkāro uppajjissatī’’ti.

333.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Anupiyā as long as he pleased, set out on a journey toward Kosambī. Traveling by stages, he arrived at Kosambī. There the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Park. Then, while Devadatta was alone and in seclusion, this thought arose in his mind: "Whom should I win over so that, when he is pleased with me, abundant gain and honor may arise?" Then Devadatta thought: "This Prince Ajātasattu is young and has a bright future. Why don’t I win over Prince Ajātasattu? When he is pleased with me, abundant gain and honor will arise."

Atha kho devadatto senāsanaṃ saṃsāmetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena rājagahaṃ tena pakkāmi. Anupubbena yena rājagahaṃ tadavasari. Atha kho devadatto sakavaṇṇaṃ paṭisaṃharitvā kumārakavaṇṇaṃ abhinimminitvā ahimekhalikāya ajātasattussa kumārassa ucchaṅge [uccaṅke (syā.)] pāturahosi. Atha kho ajātasattu kumāro bhīto ahosi, ubbiggo ussaṅkī utrasto. Atha kho devadatto ajātasattuṃ kumāraṃ etadavoca – ‘‘bhāyasi maṃ tvaṃ kumārā’’ti? ‘‘Āma, bhāyāmi. Kosi tva’’nti? ‘‘Ahaṃ devadatto’’ti. ‘‘Sace kho tvaṃ, bhante, ayyo devadatto, iṅgha sakeneva vaṇṇena pātubhavassū’’ti. Atha kho devadatto kumārakavaṇṇaṃ paṭisaṃharitvā saṅghāṭipattacīvaradharo ajātasattussa kumārassa purato aṭṭhāsi.

Then Devadatta, having put away his lodging and taken his bowl and robe, set out for Rājagaha. Gradually he arrived at Rājagaha. Then Devadatta, having withdrawn his own appearance, created the appearance of a boy, wearing a snake as a girdle, and appeared on the lap of Prince Ajātasattu. Then Prince Ajātasattu was frightened, alarmed, terrified, and fearful. Then Devadatta said to Prince Ajātasattu: "Are you afraid of me, prince?" "Yes, I am afraid. Who are you?" "I am Devadatta." "If you, venerable sir, are indeed the noble Devadatta, then please appear in your own form." Then Devadatta, having withdrawn the boy's appearance, stood before Prince Ajātasattu wearing his patched robe and carrying his bowl. Then Prince Ajātasattu, being deeply impressed by this miracle of psychic power performed by Devadatta, attended upon him morning and evening with five hundred chariots, and five hundred dishes of rice were brought as food offerings. Then Devadatta, overcome by gain, honor, and fame, with his mind obsessed, conceived such a desire: "I will lead the community of monks." But as soon as that thought arose, Devadatta lost that psychic power.

[a. ni. 5.100] Tena kho pana samayena kakudho nāma koḷiyaputto, āyasmato mahāmoggallānassa upaṭṭhāko, adhunā kālaṅkato aññataraṃ manomayaṃ kāyaṃ upapanno.

Atha kho kakudho devaputto yenāyasmā mahāmoggallāno tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ mahāmoggallānaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi. Ekamantaṃ ṭhito kho kakudho devaputto āyasmantaṃ mahāmoggallānaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘devadattassa, bhante, lābhasakkārasilokena abhibhūtassa pariyādinnacittassa [pariyādiṇṇacittassa (ka.)] evarūpaṃ icchāgataṃ uppajji – ‘ahaṃ bhikkhusaṅghaṃ pariharissāmī’ti.

At that time, Kakudha, a Koliyan's son who had been an attendant of the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, had recently died and been reborn in a certain mind-made body. His attainment of such an existence was like two or three Magadhan village fields. With that attainment of existence, he harmed neither himself nor others. Then Kakudha, the deva, approached the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, Kakudha, the deva, said to the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna: "Venerable sir, Devadatta, overwhelmed by gain, honor, and fame, his mind consumed, such a wish arose in him: 'I will lead the community of monks.' But as soon as that thought arose, Venerable sir, Devadatta lost that psychic power." This is what Kakudha, the deva, said. Having said this, he paid homage to the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, circumambulated him, and vanished right there.

Atha kho āyasmā mahāmoggallāno yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā mahāmoggallāno bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kakudho nāma, bhante, koḷiyaputto mama upaṭṭhāko adhunā kālaṅkato aññataraṃ manomayaṃ kāyaṃ upapanno.

Then the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, my attendant named Kakudha, a Koliyan's son, has recently passed away and been reborn in a mind-made body. He has attained such a form of existence—like two or three Magadhan village fields. With that form of existence, he neither harms himself nor others. Then, venerable sir, the deva Kakudha approached me, paid homage, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, venerable sir, the deva Kakudha said to me: 'Venerable sir, Devadatta, overcome by gain, honor, and fame, with his mind consumed, had such a thought arise: "I will lead the community of monks." But, venerable sir, as soon as that thought arose, Devadatta lost that psychic power.' This, venerable sir, is what the deva Kakudha said. Having said this, he paid homage to me, circumambulated me, and vanished right there."

‘‘Kiṃ pana te, moggallāna, kakudho devaputto cetasā ceto paricca vidito? Yaṃ kiñci kakudho devaputto bhāsati sabbaṃ taṃ tatheva hoti, no aññathā’’ti? ‘‘Cetasā ceto paricca vidito ca me, bhante, kakudho devaputto. Yaṃ kiñci kakudho devaputto bhāsati sabbaṃ taṃ tatheva hoti, no aññathā’’ti. ‘‘Rakkhassetaṃ, moggallāna, vācaṃ. Rakkhassetaṃ, moggallāna, vācaṃ. Idāni so moghapuriso attanāva attānaṃ pātukarissati.

"But, Moggallāna, is the deva Kakudha known to you, having encompassed his mind with your mind? Whatever the deva Kakudha says, does it all happen just so, and not otherwise?" "Venerable sir, the deva Kakudha is known to me, having encompassed his mind with my mind. Whatever the deva Kakudha says, it all happens just so, and not otherwise." "Guard this speech, Moggallāna. Guard this speech, Moggallāna. Now that vain man will reveal himself by himself."

The Discourse on the Five Teachers

334. [a. ni. 5.100] ‘‘Pañcime, moggallāna, satthāro santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ. Katame pañca? ‘‘Idha, moggallāna, ekacco satthā aparisuddhasīlo samāno ‘parisuddhasīlomhī’ti paṭijānāti ‘parisuddhaṃ me sīlaṃ pariyodātaṃ asaṃkiliṭṭha’nti. Tamenaṃ sāvakā evaṃ jānanti – ‘ayaṃ kho bhavaṃ satthā aparisuddhasīlo samāno ‘parisuddhasīlomhī’ti paṭijānāti ‘parisuddhaṃ me sīlaṃ pariyodātaṃ asaṃkiliṭṭha’nti ca. Mayañceva kho pana gihīnaṃ āroceyyāma, nāssassa manāpaṃ. Yaṃ kho panassa amanāpaṃ, kathaṃ naṃ mayaṃ tena samudācareyyāma? Sammannati kho pana cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhārena – yaṃ tumo karissati, tumova tena paññāyissatī’ti. Evarūpaṃ kho, moggallāna, satthāraṃ sāvakā sīlato rakkhanti; evarūpo ca pana satthā sāvakehi sīlato rakkhaṃ paccāsīsati [paccāsiṃsati (sī. syā.)].

334.“Moggallāna, there are these five teachers existing, found in the world. What five? Here, Moggallāna, a certain teacher, being of impure conduct, claims: ‘I am of pure conduct,’ ‘My conduct is pure, bright, and unblemished.’ His disciples know him thus: ‘This venerable teacher, being of impure conduct, claims: “I am of pure conduct,” “My conduct is pure, bright, and unblemished.” If we were to tell the laypeople, it would not be pleasing to him. And what is unpleasing to him, how could we treat him in that way? He is honored with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites—whatever he does, he will be known by that.’ Thus, Moggallāna, disciples protect such a teacher with regard to conduct; and such a teacher expects protection from his disciples with regard to conduct.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, moggallāna, idhekacco satthā aparisuddhājīvo samāno ‘parisuddhājīvomhī’ti paṭijānāti ‘parisuddho me ājīvo pariyodāto asaṃkiliṭṭho’ti ca. Tamenaṃ sāvakā evaṃ jānanti – ‘ayaṃ kho bhavaṃ satthā aparisuddhājīvo samāno ‘parisuddhājīvomhī’ti paṭijānāti ‘parisuddho me ājīvo pariyodāto asaṃkiliṭṭho’ti ca.

Sammannati kho pana cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhārena – yaṃ tumo karissati, tumova tena paññāyissatī’ti. Evarūpaṃ kho, moggallāna, satthāraṃ sāvakā ājīvato rakkhanti; evarūpo ca pana satthā sāvakehi ājīvato rakkhaṃ paccāsīsati.

“Furthermore, Moggallāna, here a certain teacher, being of impure livelihood, claims: ‘I am of pure livelihood,’ ‘My livelihood is pure, bright, and unblemished.’ His disciples know him thus: ‘This venerable teacher, being of impure livelihood, claims: “I am of pure livelihood,” “My livelihood is pure, bright, and unblemished.” If we were to tell the laypeople, it would not be pleasing to him. And what is unpleasing to him, how could we treat him in that way? He is honored with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites—whatever he does, he will be known by that.’ Thus, Moggallāna, disciples protect such a teacher with regard to livelihood; and such a teacher expects protection from his disciples with regard to livelihood.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, moggallāna, idhekacco satthā aparisuddhadhammadesano samāno ‘parisuddhadhammadesanomhī’ti paṭijānāti ‘parisuddhā me dhammadesanā pariyodātā asaṃkiliṭṭhā’ti ca. Tamenaṃ sāvakā evaṃ jānanti – ‘ayaṃ kho bhavaṃ satthā aparisuddhadhammadesano samāno ‘parisuddhadhammadesanomhī’ti paṭijānāti ‘parisuddhā me dhammadesanā pariyodātā asaṃkiliṭṭhā’ti ca.

Sammannati kho pana cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhārena – yaṃ tumo karissati, tumova tena paññāyissatī’ti. Evarūpaṃ kho, moggallāna, satthāraṃ sāvakā dhammadesanato rakkhanti; evarūpo ca pana satthā sāvakehi dhammadesanato rakkhaṃ paccāsīsati.

“Furthermore, Moggallāna, here a certain teacher, being of impure Dhamma-teaching, claims: ‘I am of pure Dhamma-teaching,’ ‘My Dhamma-teaching is pure, bright, and unblemished.’ His disciples know him thus: ‘This venerable teacher, being of impure Dhamma-teaching, claims: “I am of pure Dhamma-teaching,” “My Dhamma-teaching is pure, bright, and unblemished.” If we were to tell the laypeople, it would not be pleasing to him. And what is unpleasing to him, how could we treat him in that way? He is honored with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites—whatever he does, he will be known by that.’ Thus, Moggallāna, disciples protect such a teacher with regard to Dhamma-teaching; and such a teacher expects protection from his disciples with regard to Dhamma-teaching.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, moggallāna, idhekacco satthā aparisuddhaveyyākaraṇo samāno ‘parisuddhaveyyākaraṇomhī’ti paṭijānāti ‘parisuddhaṃ me veyyākaraṇaṃ pariyodātaṃ asaṃkiliṭṭha’nti ca. Tamenaṃ sāvakā evaṃ jānanti – ‘ayaṃ kho bhavaṃ satthā aparisuddhaveyyākaraṇo samāno ‘parisuddhaveyyākaraṇomhī’ti paṭijānāti ‘parisuddhaṃ me veyyākaraṇaṃ pariyodātaṃ asaṃkiliṭṭha’nti ca.

Sammannati kho pana cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhārena – yaṃ tumo karissati, tumova tena paññāyissatī’ti. Evarūpaṃ kho, moggallāna, satthāraṃ sāvakā veyyākaraṇato rakkhanti; evarūpo ca pana satthā sāvakehi veyyākaraṇato rakkhaṃ paccāsīsati.

“Furthermore, Moggallāna, here a certain teacher, being of impure exposition, claims: ‘I am of pure exposition,’ ‘My exposition is pure, bright, and unblemished.’ His disciples know him thus: ‘This venerable teacher, being of impure exposition, claims: “I am of pure exposition,” “My exposition is pure, bright, and unblemished.” If we were to tell the laypeople, it would not be pleasing to him. And what is unpleasing to him, how could we treat him in that way? He is honored with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites—whatever he does, he will be known by that.’ Thus, Moggallāna, disciples protect such a teacher with regard to exposition; and such a teacher expects protection from his disciples with regard to exposition.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, moggallāna, idhekacco satthā aparisuddhañāṇadassano samāno ‘parisuddhañāṇadassanomhī’ti paṭijānāti ‘parisuddhaṃ me ñāṇadassanaṃ pariyodātaṃ asaṃkiliṭṭha’nti ca. Tamenaṃ sāvakā evaṃ jānanti – ‘ayaṃ kho bhavaṃ satthā aparisuddhañāṇadassano samāno ‘parisuddhañāṇadassanomhī’ti paṭijānāti ‘parisuddhaṃ me ñāṇadassanaṃ pariyodātaṃ asaṃkiliṭṭha’nti ca.

Evarūpaṃ kho, moggallāna, satthāraṃ sāvakā ñāṇadassanato rakkhanti; evarūpo ca pana satthā sāvakehi ñāṇadassanato rakkhaṃ paccāsīsatīti. Ime kho, moggallāna, pañca satthāro santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ.

“Furthermore, Moggallāna, here a certain teacher, being of impure knowledge and vision, claims: ‘I am of pure knowledge and vision,’ ‘My knowledge and vision is pure, bright, and unblemished.’ His disciples know him thus: ‘This venerable teacher, being of impure knowledge and vision, claims: “I am of pure knowledge and vision,” “My knowledge and vision is pure, bright, and unblemished.” If we were to tell the laypeople, it would not be pleasing to him. And what is unpleasing to him, how could we treat him in that way? He is honored with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites—whatever he does, he will be known by that.’ Thus, Moggallāna, disciples protect such a teacher with regard to knowledge and vision; and such a teacher expects protection from his disciples with regard to knowledge and vision. These, Moggallāna, are the five teachers existing, found in the world.

‘‘Ahaṃ kho pana, moggallāna, parisuddhasīlo samāno ‘parisuddhasīlomhī’ti paṭijānāmi ‘parisuddhaṃ me sīlaṃ pariyodātaṃ asaṃkiliṭṭha’nti ca. Na ca maṃ sāvakā sīlato rakkhanti; na cāhaṃ sāvakehi sīlato rakkhaṃ paccāsīsāmi. Parisuddhājīvo samāno…pe… parisuddhadhammadesano samāno…pe… parisuddhaveyyākaraṇo samāno…pe… parisuddhañāṇadassano samāno ‘parisuddhañāṇadassanomhī’ti paṭijānāmi ‘parisuddhaṃ me ñāṇadassanaṃ pariyodātaṃ asaṃkiliṭṭha’nti ca. Na ca maṃ sāvakā ñāṇadassanato rakkhanti; na cāhaṃ sāvakehi ñāṇadassanato rakkhaṃ paccāsīsāmī’’ti.

“But I, Moggallāna, being of pure conduct, claim: ‘I am of pure conduct,’ ‘My conduct is pure, bright, and unblemished.’ My disciples do not protect me with regard to conduct, nor do I expect protection from them with regard to conduct. Being of pure livelihood… being of pure Dhamma-teaching… being of pure exposition… being of pure knowledge and vision, I claim: ‘I am of pure knowledge and vision,’ ‘My knowledge and vision is pure, bright, and unblemished.’ My disciples do not protect me with regard to knowledge and vision, nor do I expect protection from them with regard to knowledge and vision.”

335. Atha kho bhagavā kosambiyaṃ yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena rājagahaṃ tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena rājagahaṃ tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā rājagahe viharati veḷuvane kalandakanivāpe. Atha kho sambahulā bhikkhū yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu. Ekamantaṃ nisinnā kho te bhikkhū bhagavantaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘devadattassa, bhante, ajātasattu kumāro pañcahi rathasatehi sāyaṃ pātaṃ upaṭṭhānaṃ gacchati; pañca ca thālipākasatāni bhattābhihāro abhiharīyatī’’ti. ‘‘Mā, bhikkhave, devadattassa lābhasakkārasilokaṃ pihayittha.

335.Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Kosambī as long as he pleased, set out on a journey toward Rājagaha. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Rājagaha. There the Blessed One stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Feeding Place. Then many bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, those bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, Prince Ajātasattu attends on Devadatta morning and evening with five hundred chariots, and five hundred pots of cooked rice are brought as his meal offering.” “Monks, do not envy Devadatta’s gains, honor, and fame. As long as Prince Ajātasattu attends on Devadatta morning and evening with five hundred chariots, and five hundred pots of cooked rice are brought as his meal offering, monks, only decline in wholesome qualities is to be expected of Devadatta, not growth.”

‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, caṇḍassa kukkurassa nāsāya pittaṃ bhindeyyuṃ, evañhi so, bhikkhave, kukkuro bhiyyosomattāya caṇḍataro assa, evameva kho, bhikkhave, yāvakīvañca devadattassa ajātasattu kumāro pañcahi rathasatehi sāyaṃ pātaṃ upaṭṭhānaṃ gamissati, pañca ca thālipākasatāni bhattābhihāro abhiharīyissati, hāniyeva, bhikkhave, devadattassa pāṭikaṅkhā kusalesu dhammesu, no vuḍḍhi.

“Just as, monks, if they were to break a bladder of bile on the nose of a fierce dog, that dog would become even fiercer, so too, monks, as long as Prince Ajātasattu attends on Devadatta morning and evening with five hundred chariots, and five hundred pots of cooked rice are brought as his meal offering, only decline in wholesome qualities is to be expected of Devadatta, not growth.”

[saṃ. ni. 2.184; a. ni. 4.68] ‘‘Attavadhāya, bhikkhave, devadattassa lābhasakkārasiloko udapādi, parābhavāya devadattassa lābhasakkārasiloko udapādi.

“Monks, gain, honor, and fame arose for Devadatta’s own destruction and downfall.”

‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, kadalī attavadhāya phalaṃ deti, parābhavāya phalaṃ deti, evameva kho, bhikkhave, attavadhāya devadattassa lābhasakkārasiloko udapādi, parābhavāya devadattassa lābhasakkārasiloko udapādi.

“Just as, monks, a banana plant bears fruit for its own destruction and downfall, so too, monks, Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame arose for his own destruction and downfall.”

‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, veḷu attavadhāya phalaṃ deti, parābhavāya phalaṃ deti, evameva kho, bhikkhave, attavadhāya devadattassa lābhasakkārasiloko udapādi, parābhavāya devadattassa lābhasakkārasiloko udapādi.

“Just as, monks, a bamboo bears fruit for its own destruction and downfall, so too, monks, Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame arose for his own destruction and downfall.”

‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, naḷo attavadhāya phalaṃ deti, parābhavāya phalaṃ deti, evameva kho, bhikkhave, attavadhāya devadattassa lābhasakkārasiloko udapādi, parābhavāya devadattassa lābhasakkārasiloko udapādi.

“Just as, monks, a reed bears fruit for its own destruction and downfall, so too, monks, Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame arose for his own destruction and downfall.”

‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, assatarī attavadhāya gabbhaṃ gaṇhāti, parābhavāya gabbhaṃ gaṇhāti, evameva kho, bhikkhave, attavadhāya devadattassa lābhasakkārasiloko udapādi, parābhavāya devadattassa lābhasakkārasiloko udapādī’’ti.

“Just as, monks, a mule conceives a fetus for its own destruction and downfall, so too, monks, Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame arose for his own destruction and downfall.”

[saṃ. ni. 1.183, 1.2.184, netti. 90] ‘‘Phalaṃ ve kadaliṃ hanti, phalaṃ veḷuṃ phalaṃ naḷaṃ;Sakkāro kāpurisaṃ hanti, gabbho assatariṃ yathā’’ti.

“Fruit destroys the banana plant, fruit destroys the bamboo, fruit destroys the reed; Gain and honor destroy a worthless person, just as a fetus destroys a mule.”

Pakāsanīyakammaṃ

The Act of Proclamation

336. Tena kho pana samayena bhagavā mahatiyā parisāya parivuto dhammaṃ desento nisinno hoti sarājikāya parisāya. Atha kho devadatto uṭṭhāyāsanā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā yena bhagavā tenañjaliṃ paṇāmetvā bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘jiṇṇo dāni, bhante, bhagavā vuḍḍho mahallako addhagato vayoanuppatto. Appossukko dāni, bhante, bhagavā diṭṭhadhammasukhavihāraṃ anuyutto viharatu, mamaṃ bhikkhusaṅghaṃ nissajjatu. Ahaṃ bhikkhusaṅghaṃ pariharissāmī’’ti. ‘‘Alaṃ, devadatta, mā te rucci bhikkhusaṅghaṃ pariharitu’’nti. Dutiyampi kho devadatto…pe… tatiyampi kho devadatto bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘jiṇṇo dāni, bhante, bhagavā vuḍḍho mahallako addhagato vayoanuppatto. Appossukko dāni, bhante, bhagavā diṭṭhadhammasukhavihāraṃ anuyutto viharatu, mamaṃ bhikkhusaṅghaṃ nissajjatu. Ahaṃ bhikkhusaṅghaṃ pariharissāmī’’ti. ‘‘Sāriputtamoggallānānampi kho ahaṃ, devadatta, bhikkhusaṅghaṃ na nissajjeyyaṃ, kiṃ pana tuyhaṃ chavassa kheḷāsakassā’’ti! Atha kho devadatto – sarājikāya maṃ bhagavā parisāya kheḷāsakavādena apasādeti, sāriputtamoggallāneva ukkaṃsatīti – kupito anattamano bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṃ katvā pakkāmi. Ayañcarahi devadattassa bhagavati paṭhamo āghāto ahosi.

336.At that time, the Blessed One was seated, teaching the Dhamma, surrounded by a great assembly, which included a royal retinue. Then Devadatta rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and raising his hands in salutation towards the Blessed One, he said to him: “Venerable sir, the Blessed One is now aged, elderly, old, advanced in years, having reached the final stage of life. Let the Blessed One now dwell at ease, devoted to a pleasant abiding in this very life. Entrust the monastic community to me. I will lead the monastic community.” “Enough, Devadatta. Do not desire to lead the monastic community.” A second time, Devadatta… A third time, Devadatta addressed the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the Blessed One is now aged, elderly, old, advanced in years, having reached the final stage of life. Let the Blessed One now dwell at ease, devoted to a pleasant abiding in this very life. Entrust the monastic community to me. I will lead the monastic community.” “Devadatta, I would not even entrust the monastic community to Sāriputta and Moggallāna—how much less to you, a wretched spit-eater!” Then Devadatta thought: “The Blessed One disgraces me before the royal assembly by calling me a spit-eater, while praising only Sāriputta and Moggallāna!” Angry and displeased, he paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed. This was Devadatta’s first act of animosity toward the Blessed One.

Atha kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘tena hi, bhikkhave, saṅgho devadattassa rājagahe pakāsanīyaṃ kammaṃ karotu – ‘pubbe devadattassa aññā pakati ahosi, idāni aññā pakati. Yaṃ devadatto kareyya kāyena vācāya, na tena buddho vā dhammo vā saṅgho vā daṭṭhabbo, devadattova tena daṭṭhabbo’ti. Evañca pana, bhikkhave, kātabbaṃ. Byattena bhikkhunā paṭibalena saṅgho ñāpetabbo –

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Well then, bhikkhus, let the Sangha carry out an act of proclamation concerning Devadatta in Rājagaha: ‘Previously Devadatta’s nature was one thing, now his nature is another. Whatever Devadatta may do by body or speech, the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha should not be seen as being involved in that; only Devadatta should be seen as being involved in that.’ And this, bhikkhus, is how it should be done. A competent and capable bhikkhu should inform the Sangha:

337. ‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ saṅgho devadattassa rājagahe pakāsanīyaṃ kammaṃ kareyya – ‘‘pubbe devadattassa aññā pakati ahosi, idāni aññā pakati.

Venerable Sāriputta, being authorized, entered Rājagaha together with many bhikkhus and proclaimed Devadatta in Rājagaha: ‘Previously Devadatta’s nature was one thing, now his nature is another. Whatever Devadatta may do by body or speech, the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha should not be seen as being involved in that; only Devadatta should be seen as being involved in that.’ There, those people who were faithless, lacking confidence, and of weak understanding said: “These Sakyan ascetics are envious, begrudging Devadatta’s gains and honors.” But those people who were faithful, confident, wise, discerning, and intelligent said: “This will not be insignificant, since the Blessed One has caused Devadatta to be proclaimed in Rājagaha.”

Ajātasattukumāravatthu

The Story of Prince Ajātasattu

339. Atha kho devadatto yena ajātasattu kumāro tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā ajātasattuṃ kumāraṃ etadavoca – ‘‘pubbe kho, kumāra, manussā dīghāyukā, etarahi appāyukā. Ṭhānaṃ kho panetaṃ vijjati yaṃ tvaṃ kumārova samāno kālaṃ kareyyāsi. Tena hi tvaṃ, kumāra, pitaraṃ hantvā rājā hohi. Ahaṃ bhagavantaṃ hantvā buddho bhavissāmī’’ti.

339.Then Devadatta approached Prince Ajātasattu and said to him: "Prince, in the past people lived long lives, but now they have short lives. It is possible that you, while still a prince, might die. Therefore, prince, kill your father and become king. I will kill the Blessed One and become a Buddha."

Atha kho ajātasattu kumāro – ayyo kho devadatto mahiddhiko mahānubhāvo, jāneyyāsi ayyo devadattoti – ūruyā potthanikaṃ bandhitvā divā divassa [divā divasassa (ka.)] bhīto ubbiggo ussaṅkī utrasto sahasā antepuraṃ pāvisi. Addasāsuṃ kho antepure upacārakā mahāmattā ajātasattuṃ kumāraṃ divā divassa bhītaṃ ubbiggaṃ ussaṅkiṃ utrastaṃ sahasā antepuraṃ pavisantaṃ; disvāna aggahesuṃ. Te vicinantā ūruyā potthanikaṃ baddhaṃ [bandhaṃ (ka.)] disvāna ajātasattuṃ kumāraṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘kiṃ tvaṃ, kumāra, kattukāmosī’’ti? ‘‘Pitaramhi hantukāmo’’ti. ‘‘Kenāsi ussāhito’’ti? ‘‘Ayyena devadattenā’’ti. Ekacce mahāmattā evaṃ matiṃ akaṃsu – ‘‘kumāro ca hantabbo, devadatto ca, sabbe ca bhikkhū hantabbā’’ti. Ekacce mahāmattā evaṃ matiṃ akaṃsu – ‘‘na bhikkhū hantabbā. Na bhikkhū kiñci aparajjhanti. Kumāro ca hantabbo, devadatto cā’’ti. Ekacce mahāmattā evaṃ matiṃ akaṃsu – ‘‘na kumāro ca hantabbo, na devadatto. Na bhikkhū hantabbā. Rañño ārocetabbaṃ. Yathā rājā vakkhati tathā karissāmā’’ti.

Then Prince Ajātasattu—thinking, "Venerable Devadatta is powerful and mighty; venerable Devadatta should be known"—tied a sheath to his thigh and, terrified, alarmed, fearful, and agitated, suddenly entered the palace during the day. The attendants and high officials in the palace saw Prince Ajātasattu entering the palace during the day, terrified, alarmed, fearful, and agitated. Seeing him, they seized him. Upon searching, they saw the sheath tied to his thigh and said to Prince Ajātasattu, "What do you intend to do, prince?" "I wish to kill my father," he replied. "Who urged you on?" "Venerable Devadatta," he said. Some high officials were of this opinion: "The prince should be killed, Devadatta should be killed, and all the monks should be killed." Some high officials were of this opinion: "The monks should not be killed. The monks have done no wrong. The prince should be killed, and Devadatta should be killed." Some high officials were of this opinion: "Neither the prince nor Devadatta should be killed. The monks should not be killed. The king should be informed. We will act as the king directs."

Atha kho te mahāmattā ajātasattuṃ kumāraṃ ādāya yena rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā rañño māgadhassa seniyassa bimbisārassa etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Kathaṃ, bhaṇe, mahāmattehi mati katā’’ti? ‘‘Ekacce, deva, mahāmattā evaṃ matiṃ akaṃsu – ‘kumāro ca hantabbo, devadatto ca, sabbe ca bhikkhū hantabbā’ti. Ekacce mahāmattā evaṃ matiṃ akaṃsu – ‘na bhikkhū hantabbā. Na bhikkhū kiñci aparajjhanti. Kumāro ca hantabbo, devadatto cā’ti. Ekacce mahāmattā evaṃ matiṃ akaṃsu – ‘na kumāro ca hantabbo, na devadatto. Na bhikkhū hantabbā. Rañño ārocetabbaṃ. Yathā rājā vakkhati tathā karissāmā’’’ti. ‘‘Kiṃ, bhaṇe, karissati buddho vā dhammo vā saṅgho vā? Nanu bhagavatā paṭikacceva devadatto rājagahe pakāsāpito – ‘pubbe devadattassa aññā pakati ahosi, idāni aññā pakati. Yaṃ devadatto kareyya kāyena vācāya, na tena buddho vā dhammo vā saṅgho vā daṭṭhabbo, devadattova tena daṭṭhabbo’’ti? Tattha ye te mahāmattā evaṃ matiṃ akaṃsu – ‘kumāro ca hantabbo devadatto ca; sabbe ca bhikkhū hantabbā’ti; te aṭṭhāne akāsi. Ye te mahāmattā evaṃ matiṃ akaṃsu – ‘na bhikkhū hantabbā; na bhikkhū kiñci aparajjhanti; kumāro ca hantabbo devadatto cā’ti; te nīce ṭhāne ṭhapesi. Ye te mahāmattā evaṃ matiṃ akaṃsu – ‘na kumāro ca hantabbo, na devadatto; na bhikkhū hantabbā; rañño ārocetabbaṃ; yathā rājā vakkhati tathā karissāmā’ti; te ucce ṭhāne ṭhapesi. Atha kho rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro ajātasattuṃ kumāraṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kissa maṃ tvaṃ, kumāra, hantukāmosī’’ti? ‘‘Rajjenāmhi, deva, atthiko’’ti. ‘‘Sace kho tvaṃ, kumāra, rajjena atthiko, etaṃ te rajja’’nti ajātasattussa kumārassa rajjaṃ niyyādesi.

Then those high officials took Prince Ajātasattu and approached King Bimbisāra of Magadha. Having approached, they informed King Bimbisāra of the matter. "How, sirs, have the high officials decided?" "Some high officials, sire, formed this opinion: 'The prince should be killed, Devadatta too, and all the monks should be killed.' Some high officials formed this opinion: 'The monks should not be killed. The monks have done no wrong. The prince should be killed, and Devadatta too.' Some high officials formed this opinion: 'The prince should not be killed, nor Devadatta. The monks should not be killed. The king should be informed. We will act as the king commands.'" "What, sirs, will the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha do? Has not the Blessed One already declared in Rājagaha: 'Devadatta’s nature was different before, now his nature is different. Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech, the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha should not be seen as being affected by that; Devadatta alone should be seen as being affected by that'? In this matter, those high officials who formed the opinion: 'The prince should be killed, Devadatta too, and all the monks should be killed'—they acted inappropriately. Those high officials who formed the opinion: 'The monks should not be killed; the monks have done no wrong; the prince should be killed, and Devadatta too'—they placed it in a low position. Those high officials who formed the opinion: 'The prince should not be killed, nor Devadatta; the monks should not be killed; the king should be informed; we will act as the king commands'—they placed it in a high position." Then King Bimbisāra of Magadha said to Prince Ajātasattu: "Why, prince, do you wish to kill me?" "I want the kingdom, sire." "If you, prince, want the kingdom, then this kingdom is yours." And he handed over the kingdom to Prince Ajātasattu.

340. Atha kho devadatto yena ajātasattu kumāro tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā ajātasattuṃ kumāraṃ etadavoca – ‘‘purise, mahārāja, āṇāpehi, ye samaṇaṃ gotamaṃ jīvitā voropessantī’’ti. Atha kho ajātasattu kumāro manusse āṇāpesi – ‘‘yathā, bhaṇe, ayyo devadatto āha tathā kareyyāthā’’ti. Atha kho devadatto ekaṃ purisaṃ āṇāpesi – ‘‘gacchāvuso, amukasmiṃ okāse samaṇo gotamo viharati.

340.Then Devadatta approached Prince Ajātasattu and said to him: "Prince, command men to kill the ascetic Gotama." Then Prince Ajātasattu commanded men: "Do as the venerable Devadatta says." Then Devadatta ordered one man: "Go, friend, the ascetic Gotama is staying in such-and-such a place. Kill him and return by this path." On that path, he stationed two men: "If one man comes by this path, kill him and return by this path." On that path, he stationed four men: "If two men come by this path, kill them and return by this path." On that path, he stationed eight men: "If four men come by this path, kill them and return by this path." On that path, he stationed sixteen men: "If eight men come by this path, kill them and return by this path."

Atha kho so eko puriso asicammaṃ gahetvā dhanukalāpaṃ sannayhitvā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavato avidūre bhīto ubbiggo ussaṅkī utrasto patthaddhena kāyena aṭṭhāsi.

Then that lone man, taking up his sword and shield, fastening his bow and quiver, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he stood not far from the Blessed One, frightened, terrified, alarmed, anxious, with his body rigid. The Blessed One saw that man standing there frightened, terrified, alarmed, anxious, with his body rigid. Seeing him, he said to that man: "Come, friend, do not be afraid." Then that man, setting aside his sword and shield, putting down his bow and quiver, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he bowed his head at the Blessed One's feet and said to him: "I have transgressed, venerable sir, in that I was foolish, confused, and unskillful, coming here with a mind of hatred, with a murderous intent. May the Blessed One accept my transgression as such, so that I may restrain myself in the future." "Indeed, friend, you have transgressed in that you were foolish, confused, and unskillful, coming here with a mind of hatred, with a murderous intent. But since you, friend, having seen your transgression as a transgression, make amends for it as is proper, we accept it from you. For it is growth in the Noble One's discipline—when one sees a transgression as a transgression, makes amends for it as is proper, and undertakes restraint in the future."

Then the Blessed One gave that man a gradual teaching—that is, talk on generosity, talk on virtue, talk on heaven; he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in sensual pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that his mind was ready, pliable, free from hindrances, uplifted, and confident, then he revealed the supreme teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth free from stains would properly absorb dye, so too in that very seat the dust-free, stainless vision of the Dhamma arose in that man: "Whatever is subject to arising is all subject to cessation." Then that man, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma, crossed over doubt, got rid of perplexity, gained assurance, and become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction, said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, venerable sir! Excellent, venerable sir! Just as one might set upright what was overturned, reveal what was hidden, show the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the darkness so those with eyes could see forms—in the same way, the Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by the Blessed One. I go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of monks. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for life." Then the Blessed One said to that man, "Do not go by this path, friend, go by this path," and sent him off by another route.

Then those two men—thinking, "Why is that one man taking so long to return?"—went to meet him on the path and saw the Blessed One seated at the foot of a tree. Seeing him, they approached, paid homage, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One gave them a gradual teaching… and they, independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction, said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, venerable sir!… May the Blessed One remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life from this day forward." Then the Blessed One said to those men, "Don’t go by this path, friends, don’t go by this path," and sent them off by another route.

Then those four men… then those eight men… then those sixteen men—thinking, "Why are those eight men taking so long to come back?"—went towards the path and saw the Blessed One seated at the foot of a tree. Seeing him, they approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One gave them a gradual teaching, that is to say, a talk on generosity… and, independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction, they said this to the Blessed One: "Excellent, venerable sir!… May the Blessed One remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge from this day forth, for as long as life lasts." Then the Blessed One said to those men, "Do not go by this path, friends, go by this path," and directed them by another route.

Atha kho so eko puriso yena devadatto tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā devadattaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘nāhaṃ, bhante, sakkomi taṃ bhagavantaṃ jīvitā voropetuṃ; mahiddhiko so bhagavā, mahānubhāvo’’ti. ‘‘Alaṃ, āvuso; mā tvaṃ samaṇaṃ gotamaṃ jīvitā voropesi. Ahameva samaṇaṃ gotamaṃ jīvitā voropessāmī’’ti.

Then one of those men approached Devadatta and said to him, "Venerable sir, I am unable to deprive the Blessed One of life. The Blessed One is of great power and might." "Enough, friend. Do not deprive the ascetic Gotama of life. I myself will deprive the ascetic Gotama of life."

341.Now at that time the Blessed One was pacing up and down in the shade of Vulture Peak Mountain. Then Devadatta climbed Vulture Peak Mountain, rolled down a great rock, thinking: “With this I shall deprive the recluse Gotama of life.” But two mountain peaks came together and blocked that rock. Then a splinter flew off and caused blood to flow from the Blessed One’s foot. Then the Blessed One looked up at Devadatta and said: “Much demerit, worthless man, has been generated by you, since with a wicked mind and murderous intent you have caused the Tathāgata’s blood to flow.” Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “This, bhikkhus, is the first deed of immediate retribution accumulated by Devadatta, in that with a wicked mind and murderous intent he caused the Tathāgata’s blood to flow.”

The bhikkhus heard that Devadatta had allegedly attempted to murder the Blessed One. Those bhikkhus then were pacing up and down around the Blessed One’s dwelling, making a loud and great noise, reciting, for the protection, shelter, and security of the Blessed One. The Blessed One heard the loud and great sound of recitation. Having heard it, he addressed Venerable Ānanda: “What, Ānanda, is this loud and great noise, this sound of recitation?” “Venerable sir, the bhikkhus heard that Devadatta had allegedly attempted to murder the Blessed One. Those bhikkhus, venerable sir, are pacing up and down around the Blessed One’s dwelling, making a loud and great noise, reciting, for the protection, shelter, and security of the Blessed One. That, Blessed One, is this loud and great noise, this sound of recitation.” “Well then, Ānanda, in my name, summon those bhikkhus: ‘The Teacher invites the venerable ones.’” “Yes, venerable sir,” Venerable Ānanda replied to the Blessed One. He then approached those bhikkhus and said to them: “The Teacher invites the venerable ones.” “Yes, friend,” those bhikkhus replied to Venerable Ānanda. They then approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. When they were seated to one side, the Blessed One said this to them:

‘‘Aṭṭhānametaṃ, bhikkhave, anavakāso, yaṃ parūpakkamena tathāgataṃ jīvitā voropeyya. Anupakkamena, bhikkhave, tathāgatā parinibbāyanti.

“It is impossible, bhikkhus, it cannot happen, that a Tathāgata could be deprived of life by the assault of another. Tathāgatas, bhikkhus, attain final Nibbāna without any assault.

And how could we treat him in a way that is displeasing to him? Yet he is honored with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites—whatever he does, he will be known by that.’ “Such a teacher, bhikkhus, is protected by his disciples with regard to moral conduct; and such a teacher expects protection from his disciples with regard to moral conduct.

342.At that time, in Rājagaha, there was a fierce elephant named Nāḷāgiri, a killer of men. Then Devadatta entered Rājagaha, went to the elephant stable, and said to the elephant keepers: "Friends, we are known as relatives of the king, capable of elevating the low to high positions and increasing food and wages. Therefore, friends, when the ascetic Gotama walks along this street, release this elephant Nāḷāgiri and drive him down this street." "Yes, Venerable sir," replied the elephant keepers to Devadatta. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Rājagaha for alms with a large group of monks. Then the Blessed One proceeded along that street. The elephant keepers saw the Blessed One walking along the street. Seeing him, they released the elephant Nāḷāgiri and drove him down the street. The elephant Nāḷāgiri saw the Blessed One approaching from afar. Seeing him, he raised his trunk, with ears and tail erect, and charged toward the Blessed One. The monks saw the elephant Nāḷāgiri approaching from afar. Seeing him, they said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, this elephant Nāḷāgiri is fierce and a killer of men; he is coming down this street. Retreat, Venerable sir! Retreat, Sugata!" "Come, monks, do not fear. Monks, this is impossible, there is no opportunity for anyone to take the Tathāgata’s life by violent means. Monks, Tathāgatas pass away naturally, not by violence." A second time the monks spoke to the Blessed One... A third time the monks said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, this elephant Nāḷāgiri is fierce and a killer of men; he is coming down this street. Retreat, Venerable sir! Retreat, Sugata!" "Come, monks, do not fear. Monks, this is impossible, there is no opportunity for anyone to take the Tathāgata’s life by violent means. Monks, Tathāgatas pass away naturally, not by violence."

At that time, people were gathered on terraces, in mansions, and on upper stories. Among them, those who were faithless, without confidence, and of weak intellect said, "How handsome the Great Ascetic is! But now he will be injured by the elephant." However, those who were faithful, confident, wise, discerning, and intelligent said, "Soon, indeed, the elephant will contend with the Nāga." Then the Blessed One suffused the elephant Nāḷāgiri with a mind of loving-kindness. Struck by the Blessed One's loving-kindness, the elephant Nāḷāgiri lowered its trunk and approached the Blessed One. Having approached, it stood before the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, stroking the elephant Nāḷāgiri's temple with his right hand, addressed the elephant with these verses:

‘‘Mā kuñjara nāgamāsado, dukkhañhi kuñjara nāgamāsado;Na hi nāgahatassa kuñjara sugati, hoti ito paraṃ yato.

"O elephant, do not attack the Nāga; for attacking the Nāga brings suffering, O elephant. For one struck by the Nāga finds no happy destiny beyond, from that very moment."

‘‘Mā ca mado mā ca pamādo, na hi pamattā sugatiṃ vajanti te;Tvaññeva tathā karissasi, yena tvaṃ sugatiṃ gamissasī’’ti.

"Be not intoxicated, be not heedless, for the heedless do not go to a good bourn; You yourself must act in such a way that you will go to a good bourn."

Atha kho nāḷāgiri hatthī soṇḍāya bhagavato pādapaṃsūni gahetvā uparimuddhani ākiritvā paṭikuṭiyova [paṭikuṭito paṭisakki (sī. syā.)] osakki, yāva bhagavantaṃ addakkhi.

Then the elephant Nāḷāgiri, taking dust from the Blessed One's feet with his trunk, sprinkled it over his head and, retreating backwards, only withdrew as far as he could still see the Blessed One. Then the elephant Nāḷāgiri went to the elephant stable and stood in his own place. Truly, tamed was the elephant Nāḷāgiri. At that time, people recited this verse:

[ma. ni. 2.352; theragā. 878] ‘‘Daṇḍeneke damayanti, aṅkusehi kasāhi ca;Adaṇḍena asatthena, nāgo danto mahesinā’’ti.

"Some tame with sticks, with goads and whips; Without stick or weapon, the elephant was tamed by the great sage."

Manussā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘yāva pāpo ayaṃ devadatto, alakkhiko, yatra hi nāma samaṇassa gotamassa evaṃmahiddhikassa evaṃ mahānubhāvassa vadhāya parakkamissatī’’ti. Devadattassa lābhasakkāro parihāyi. Bhagavato ca lābhasakkāro abhivaḍḍhi.

People murmured, were annoyed, and criticized: "How wicked is this Devadatta, so unfortunate, that he would dare to attempt to kill the ascetic Gotama, so powerful and mighty!" Devadatta's gain and honor declined, while the Blessed One's gain and honor increased.

Gaṇabhojane yathādhammo kāretabbo’’ti.

343.At that time, Devadatta, having lost gain and honor, went from family to family with his followers, soliciting and then eating. People murmured, complained, and criticized: "How can these Sakyan ascetics go from family to family soliciting and then eat? Who does not like what is well-prepared, who does not enjoy what is tasty?" The monks heard these people murmuring, complaining, and criticizing. Those monks who were of few desires [...] murmured, complained, and criticized: "How can Devadatta and his followers go from family to family soliciting and then eat?" They reported the matter to the Blessed One [...]. "Is it true, Devadatta, that you and your followers go from family to family soliciting and then eat?" "It is true, Blessed One." [...] Having rebuked him [...], the Blessed One gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: "Therefore, monks, I will lay down a rule for monks regarding the threefold meal in families for three reasons: to restrain ill-behaved individuals; for the comfortable dwelling of well-behaved monks; and so that those with evil desires, relying on partisanship, do not split the Sangha; and also out of compassion for families. In group meals, the procedure should be carried out according to the Dhamma."

[pārā. 409] Atha kho devadatto yena kokāliko kaṭamodakatissako [kaṭamorakatissako (sī. syā.)] khaṇḍadeviyā putto samuddadatto tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā kokālikaṃ kaṭamodakatissakaṃ khaṇḍadeviyā puttaṃ samuddadattaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘etha, mayaṃ, āvuso, samaṇassa gotamassa saṅghabhedaṃ karissāma cakkabheda’’nti.

Kathaṃ mayaṃ samaṇassa gotamassa saṅghabhedaṃ karissāma cakkabheda’’nti? ‘‘Etha, mayaṃ, āvuso, samaṇaṃ gotamaṃ upasaṅkamitvā pañca vatthūni yācissāma – ‘bhagavā, bhante, anekapariyāyena appicchassa santuṭṭhassa sallekhassa dhutassa pāsādikassa apacayassa vīriyārambhassa vaṇṇavādī.

Then Devadatta approached Kokālika, Kaṭamodakatissaka, Khaṇḍadeviyā’s son Samuddadatta. Having approached, he said to Kokālika, Kaṭamodakatissaka, Khaṇḍadeviyā’s son Samuddadatta: "Come, friends, let us create a schism in the Sangha of the ascetic Gotama, a division in the wheel." When this was said, Kokālika replied to Devadatta: "The ascetic Gotama, friend, is mighty and powerful. How can we create a schism in his Sangha, a division in the wheel?" "Come, friends, let us approach the ascetic Gotama and request five things: 'Venerable sir, the Blessed One in many ways praises fewness of wishes, contentment, self-effacement, ascetic practices, graciousness, decrease, and energetic striving. These five things, venerable sir, in many ways lead to fewness of wishes, contentment, self-effacement, ascetic practices, graciousness, decrease, and energetic striving. It would be good, venerable sir, if the monks were to dwell lifelong as forest dwellers; whoever should enter a village, let an offense befall him. Lifelong as alms-goers; whoever should accept an invitation, let an offense befall him. Lifelong as rag-robe wearers; whoever should accept householder’s robes, let an offense befall him. Lifelong as tree-root dwellers; whoever should go under a roof, let an offense befall him. Lifelong as abstainers from fish and meat; whoever should eat fish or meat, let an offense befall him.' The ascetic Gotama will not grant these five things. Then we can win people over with these five points." "It is possible, friend, to create a schism in the Sangha of the ascetic Gotama, a division in the wheel, with these five points. For people, friend, are devoted to austerity."

Atha kho devadatto – na bhagavā imāni pañca vatthūni anujānātīti – haṭṭho udaggo sapariso uṭṭhāyāsanā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṃ katvā pakkāmi.

Then Devadatta, together with his followers, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, Devadatta said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, the Blessed One has praised in many ways the qualities of fewness of wishes, contentment, self-effacement, ascetic practices, graciousness, decrease, and energetic striving. Venerable sir, these five things lead in many ways to fewness of wishes, contentment, self-effacement, ascetic practices, graciousness, decrease, and energetic striving. It would be good, venerable sir, if monks would be forest-dwellers for life; whoever approaches a village, may fault touch him. They should live on almsfood for life; whoever accepts an invitation, may fault touch him. They should wear rag-robes for life; whoever accepts householder's robes, may fault touch him. They should dwell at the foot of a tree for life; whoever goes under a roof, may fault touch him. They should not eat fish and meat for life; whoever eats fish or meat, may fault touch him." "Enough, Devadatta. Let whoever wishes be a forest-dweller; let whoever wishes dwell near a village. Let whoever wishes live on almsfood; let whoever wishes accept invitations. Let whoever wishes wear rag-robes; let whoever wishes accept householder's robes. For eight months, Devadatta, I have allowed dwelling at the foot of a tree. Fish and meat are pure in three cases—when not seen, not heard, and not suspected." Then Devadatta—thinking, "The Blessed One does not approve of these five things"—delighted and elated, together with his followers, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed.

Atha kho devadatto sapariso rājagahaṃ pavisitvā pañcahi vatthūhi janaṃ saññāpesi – ‘‘mayaṃ, āvuso, samaṇaṃ gotamaṃ upasaṅkamitvā pañca vatthūni yācimhā – ‘bhagavā, bhante, anekapariyāyena appicchassa…pe… vīriyārambhassa vaṇṇavādī. Imāni, bhante, pañca vatthūni anekapariyāyena appicchatāya…pe… vīriyārambhāya saṃvattanti. Sādhu, bhante, bhikkhū yāvajīvaṃ āraññikā assu; yo gāmantaṃ osareyya, vajjaṃ naṃ phuseyya…pe… yāvajīvaṃ macchamaṃsaṃ na khādeyyuṃ; yo macchamaṃsaṃ khādeyya, vajjaṃ naṃ phuseyyā’ti. Imāni pañca vatthūni samaṇo gotamo nānujānāti. Te mayaṃ imehi pañcahi vatthūhi samādāya vattāmā’’ti.

Then Devadatta, together with his followers, entered Rājagaha and persuaded the people with five points: "Friends, we approached the ascetic Gotama and requested five things: 'Venerable sir, the Blessed One in many ways praises fewness of wishes, contentment, self-effacement, ascetic practices, graciousness, decrease, and energetic striving. These five things, venerable sir, in many ways lead to fewness of wishes, contentment, self-effacement, ascetic practices, graciousness, decrease, and energetic striving. It would be good, venerable sir, if the monks were forest-dwellers for life; whoever resorts to a village, may an offense touch him [...] if they were to abstain from fish and meat for life; whoever eats fish or meat, may an offense touch him.' The ascetic Gotama does not approve of these five points. We, however, undertaking these five points, will abide by them."

Tattha ye te manussā assaddhā appasannā dubbuddhino, te evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘ime kho samaṇā sakyaputtiyā dhutā sallekhavuttino. Samaṇo pana gotamo bāhulliko bāhullāya cetetī’’ti. Ye pana te manussā saddhā pasannā paṇḍitā byattā buddhimanto, te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma devadatto bhagavato saṅghabhedāya parakkamissati cakkabhedāyā’’ti! Assosuṃ kho bhikkhū tesaṃ manussānaṃ ujjhāyantānaṃ khiyyantānaṃ vipācentānaṃ. Ye te bhikkhū appicchā…pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma devadatto saṅghabhedāya parakkamissati cakkabhedāyā’’ti! Atha kho te bhikkhū bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ…pe… ‘‘saccaṃ kira tvaṃ, devadatta, saṅghabhedāya parakkamasi cakkabhedāyā’’ti? ‘‘Saccaṃ bhagavā’’ti. ‘‘Alaṃ, devadatta. Mā te rucci saṅghabhedo. Garuko kho, devadatta, saṅghabhedo. Yo kho, devadatta, samaggaṃ saṅghaṃ bhindati, kappaṭṭhikaṃ [kappaṭṭhitikaṃ (syā.)] kibbisaṃ pasavati, kappaṃ nirayamhi paccati.

There, those people who were faithless, unconfident, and of weak understanding said this: "These Sakyan ascetics are austere and self-effacing in conduct. But the ascetic Gotama is indulgent and intends indulgence." However, those people who were faithful, confident, wise, discerning, and intelligent complained, criticized, and protested: "How could Devadatta strive to split the Sangha and break the wheel?" The monks heard those people complaining, criticizing, and protesting. Those monks who were of few desires [...] also complained, criticized, and protested: "How could Devadatta strive to split the Sangha and break the wheel?" Then those monks reported the matter to the Blessed One [...]. "Is it true, Devadatta, that you are striving to split the Sangha and break the wheel?" "It is true, Blessed One." "Enough, Devadatta. Do not let splitting the Sangha appeal to you. Heavy is splitting the Sangha, Devadatta. Whoever splits a united Sangha generates demerit for an eon; he ripens in hell for an eon. But whoever unites a divided Sangha generates supreme merit; he rejoices in heaven for an eon. Enough, Devadatta. Do not let splitting the Sangha appeal to you. Heavy is splitting the Sangha, Devadatta."

Then, in the morning, Venerable Ānanda, having dressed, took his bowl and robe and entered Rājagaha for alms. Devadatta saw Venerable Ānanda walking for alms in Rājagaha. Having seen him, he approached Venerable Ānanda and said: "From today onward, friend Ānanda, I will perform the Uposatha and Saṅgha acts separately from the Blessed One and separately from the Saṅgha of bhikkhus."

Then the Venerable Ananda, having walked for alms in Rājagaha and returned from his alms round after the meal, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: "Here, Venerable Sir, this morning, having dressed and taken bowl and robe, I entered Rājagaha for alms. Devadatta saw me walking for alms in Rājagaha. Having seen me, he approached me and said: ‘From today onward, friend Ananda, I will perform the Uposatha and carry out Sangha acts independently of the Blessed One, independently of the Sangha of monks.’ From today onward, Venerable Sir, Devadatta will split the Sangha." Then the Blessed One, having understood the meaning of this, on that occasion uttered this inspired utterance:

[udā. 48] ‘‘Sukaraṃ sādhunā sādhuṃ, sādhuṃ pāpena dukkaraṃ;Pāpaṃ pāpena sukaraṃ, pāpamariyehi dukkara’’nti.

"Easy is it for the good to do good; difficult is it for the bad to do good. Easy is it for the bad to do evil; difficult is it for the noble to do evil."

Saṅghabhedakathā

The Discourse on Causing Schism in the Sangha

344. Atha kho devadatto tadahuposathe uṭṭhāyāsanā salākaṃ gāhesi – ‘‘mayaṃ, āvuso, samaṇaṃ gotamaṃ upasaṅkamitvā pañca vatthūni yācimhā – ‘bhagavā, bhante, anekapariyāyena appicchassa…pe… vīriyārambhassa vaṇṇavādī. Imāni, bhante, pañca vatthūni anekapariyāyena appicchatāya…pe… vīriyārambhāya saṃvattanti. Sādhu, bhante, bhikkhū yāvajīvaṃ āraññikā assu; yo gāmantaṃ osareyya, vajjaṃ naṃ phuseyya…pe… yāvajīvaṃ macchamaṃsaṃ na khādeyyuṃ; yo macchamaṃsaṃ khādeyya, vajjaṃ naṃ phuseyyā’ti. Imāni pañca vatthūni samaṇo gotamo nānujānāti. Te mayaṃ imehi pañcahi vatthūhi samādāya vattāma. Yassāyasmato imāni pañca vatthūni khamanti, so salākaṃ gaṇhātū’’ti.

344.Then, on that observance day, Devadatta rose from his seat and took a voting slip, saying: "Friends, we approached the ascetic Gotama and requested five points: 'Venerable sir, the Blessed One praises in many ways those of few desires... and those who arouse energy. Venerable sir, these five points conduce in many ways to fewness of desires... and to arousing energy. It would be good, venerable sir, if the monks were forest-dwellers for life; whoever would enter a village, an offense would touch him... if they would not eat fish or meat for life; whoever would eat fish or meat, an offense would touch him.' The ascetic Gotama does not approve of these five points. We undertake to conduct ourselves according to these five points. Whoever among the venerable ones approves of these five points, let him take a voting slip."

Tena kho pana samayena vesālikā vajjiputtakā pañcamattāni bhikkhusatāni navakā ceva honti appakataññuno ca. Te – ‘ayaṃ dhammo, ayaṃ vinayo, idaṃ satthusāsana’nti – salākaṃ gaṇhiṃsu. Atha kho devadatto saṅghaṃ bhinditvā pañcamattāni bhikkhusatāni ādāya yena gayāsīsaṃ tena pakkāmi. Atha kho sāriputtamoggallānā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā sāriputto bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘devadatto, bhante, saṅghaṃ bhinditvā pañcamattāni bhikkhusatāni ādāya yena gayāsīsaṃ tena pakkanto’’ti. ‘‘Na hi nāma tumhākaṃ, sāriputtā, tesu navakesu bhikkhūsu kāruññampi bhavissati? Gacchatha tumhe, sāriputtā, purā te bhikkhū anayabyasanaṃ āpajjantī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ bhante’’ti kho sāriputtamoggallānā bhagavato paṭissutvā uṭṭhāyāsanā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṃ katvā yena gayāsīsaṃ tenupasaṅkamiṃsu.

At that time, the Vajjian monks of Vesālī—about five hundred in number—were newly ordained and unskilled. They took a vote, saying, "This is the Dhamma, this is the Discipline, this is the Teacher’s instruction." Then Devadatta, having split the Sangha, left for Gayāsīsa, taking about five hundred monks with him. Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, Venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One, "Venerable sir, Devadatta has split the Sangha and left for Gayāsīsa, taking about five hundred monks with him." "Surely, Sāriputta, you must have some compassion for those uninstructed monks? Go, Sāriputta, before those monks fall into misfortune and disaster." "Yes, Venerable sir," replied Sāriputta and Moggallāna to the Blessed One. Then they rose from their seats, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and went to Gayāsīsa.

Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu bhagavato avidūre rodamāno ṭhito hoti. Atha kho bhagavā taṃ bhikkhuṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kissa tvaṃ, bhikkhu, rodasī’’ti? ‘‘Yepi te, bhante, bhagavato aggasāvakā sāriputtamoggallānā tepi devadattassa santike gacchanti devadattassa dhammaṃ rocentā’’ti. ‘‘Aṭṭhānametaṃ, bhikkhu, anavakāso, yaṃ sāriputtamoggallānā devadattassa dhammaṃ roceyyuṃ, api ca te gatā bhikkhūnaṃ saññattiyā’’ti [bhikkhusaññattiyāti (sī. syā.), bhikkhū saññattiyā (ka.)].

At that time, a certain monk was standing not far from the Blessed One, weeping. Then the Blessed One said to that monk, "Why are you weeping, monk?" "Venerable sir, even the Blessed One's foremost disciples, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, go to Devadatta's side, approving of Devadatta's teaching." "This is impossible, monk, there is no possibility that Sāriputta and Moggallāna would approve of Devadatta's teaching. However, they have gone to make an announcement to the monks."

345. Tena kho pana samayena devadatto mahatiyā parisāya parivutto dhammaṃ desento nisinno hoti. Addasā kho devadatto sāriputtamoggallāne dūratova āgacchante. Disvāna bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘passatha, bhikkhave, yāva svākkhāto mayā dhammo, yepi te samaṇassa gotamassa aggasāvakā sāriputtamoggallānā tepi mama santike āgacchanti. Mama dhammaṃ rocentā’’ti. Evaṃ vutte kokāliko devadattaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘mā, āvuso devadatta, sāriputtamoggallāne vissasi. Pāpicchā sāriputtamoggallānā, pāpikānaṃ icchānaṃ vasaṃ gatā’’ti. ‘‘Alaṃ, āvuso. Svāgataṃ tesaṃ yato me dhammaṃ rocentī’’ti.

345.Now at that time Devadatta, surrounded by a large assembly, was seated teaching the Dhamma. Devadatta saw Sāriputta and Moggallāna coming from afar. Seeing them, he addressed the monks: "See, monks, how well proclaimed the Dhamma is by me, that even Sāriputta and Moggallāna, the chief disciples of the ascetic Gotama, come to my presence, approving of my Dhamma." When this was said, Kokālika said this to Devadatta: "Don't trust Sāriputta and Moggallāna, friend Devadatta. Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires; they are under the sway of evil desires." "Enough, friend. Welcome to them, since they approve of my Dhamma."

Atha kho devadatto āyasmantaṃ sāriputtaṃ upaḍḍhāsanena nimantesi – ‘‘ehāvuso sāriputta, idha nisīdāhī’’ti. ‘‘Alaṃ āvuso’’ti kho āyasmā sāriputto aññataraṃ āsanaṃ gahetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Āyasmāpi kho mahāmoggallāno aññataraṃ āsanaṃ gahetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Atha kho devadatto bahudeva rattiṃ bhikkhū dhammiyā kathāya sandassetvā samādapetvā samuttejetvā sampahaṃsetvā āyasmantaṃ sāriputtaṃ ajjhesi – ‘‘vigatathinamiddho kho, āvuso sāriputta, bhikkhusaṅgho. Paṭibhātu taṃ, āvuso sāriputta, bhikkhūnaṃ dhammī kathā, piṭṭhi me āgilāyati, tamahaṃ āyamissāmī’’ti. ‘‘Evamāvuso’’ti kho āyasmā sāriputto devadattassa paccassosi. Atha kho devadatto catugguṇaṃ saṅghāṭiṃ paññāpetvā dakkhiṇena passena seyyaṃ kappesi. Tassa kilamantassa muṭṭhassatissa asampajānassa muhuttakeneva niddā okkami.

Then Devadatta invited Venerable Sāriputta to sit on half of his seat, saying, "Come, friend Sāriputta, sit here." "Enough, friend," replied Venerable Sāriputta, taking another seat and sitting to one side. Venerable Mahāmoggallāna also took another seat and sat to one side. Then Devadatta, for much of the night, instructed, urged, roused, and delighted the monks with a Dhamma talk. Then he addressed Venerable Sāriputta: "Friend Sāriputta, the Sangha of monks is free from dullness and drowsiness. Let a Dhamma talk occur to you for the monks. My back aches; I will stretch it out." "Very well, friend," Venerable Sāriputta replied to Devadatta. Then Devadatta had his outer robe folded in four and lay down on his right side. Being weary, unmindful, and lacking awareness, he fell asleep within a moment.

Atha kho āyasmā sāriputto ādesanāpāṭihāriyānusāsaniyā bhikkhū dhammiyā kathāya ovadi anusāsi. Āyasmā mahāmoggallāno iddhipāṭihāriyānusāsaniyā bhikkhū dhammiyā kathāya ovadi anusāsi. Atha kho tesaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ āyasmatā sāriputtena ādesanāpāṭihāriyānusāsaniyā āyasmatā ca mahāmoggallānena iddhipāṭihāriyānusāsaniyā ovadiyamānānaṃ anusāsiyamānānaṃ virajaṃ vītamalaṃ dhammacakkhuṃ udapādi – yaṃ kiñci samudayadhammaṃ, sabbaṃ taṃ nirodhadhammanti.

Then Venerable Sāriputta instructed and exhorted the monks with a Dhamma talk connected with the miracle of mind-reading. Venerable Mahāmoggallāna instructed and exhorted the monks with a Dhamma talk connected with the miracle of psychic power. As they were being instructed and exhorted by Venerable Sāriputta with the instruction connected with the miracle of mind-reading, and by Venerable Mahāmoggallāna with the instruction connected with the miracle of psychic power, the monks' dust-free, stainless vision of the Dhamma arose: "Whatever is subject to arising is all subject to cessation."

Atha kho āyasmā sāriputto bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘gacchāma mayaṃ, āvuso, bhagavato santike. Yo tassa bhagavato dhammaṃ rocesi so āgacchatū’’ti. Atha kho sāriputtamoggallānā tāni pañcabhikkhusatāni ādāya yena veḷuvanaṃ tenupasaṅkamiṃsu. Atha kho kokāliko devadattaṃ uṭṭhāpesi – ‘‘uṭṭhehi, āvuso devadatta, nītā te bhikkhū sāriputtamoggallānehi. Nanu tvaṃ, āvuso devadatta, mayā vutto – ‘mā, āvuso devadatta, sāriputtamoggallāne vissāsi. Pāpicchā sāriputtamoggallānā, pāpikānaṃ icchānaṃ vasaṃ gatā’’’ti? Atha kho devadattassa tattheva uṇhaṃ lohitaṃ mukhato uggañchi.

Then Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks: "Let us go, friends, to the Blessed One. Whoever approves of his Dhamma, let him come." Then Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna, taking those five hundred monks, approached the Bamboo Grove. Meanwhile, Kokālika roused Devadatta: "Get up, friend Devadatta! The monks have been led away by Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna. Didn't I tell you, friend Devadatta, ‘Do not trust Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna. Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna are full of wicked desires, under the sway of evil desires’?" Then hot blood gushed from Devadatta’s mouth right there.

Atha kho sāriputtamoggallānā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdisuṃ. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā sāriputto bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sādhu, bhante, bhedakānuvattakā bhikkhū puna upasampajjeyyu’’nti. ‘‘Alaṃ, sāriputta. Mā te rucci bhedakānuvattakānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ puna upasampadā. Tena hi tvaṃ, sāriputta, bhedakānuvattake bhikkhū thullaccayaṃ desāpehi. Kathaṃ pana te, sāriputta, devadatto paṭipajjī’’ti? ‘‘Yatheva, bhante, bhagavā bahudeva rattiṃ bhikkhū dhammiyā kathāya sandassetvā samādapetvā samuttejetvā sampahaṃsetvā maṃ ajjhesati – ‘vigatathinamiddho kho, sāriputta, bhikkhusaṅgho; paṭibhātu taṃ, sāriputta, bhikkhūnaṃ dhammī kathā, piṭṭhi me āgilāyati, tamahaṃ āyamissāmī’ti, evameva kho, bhante, devadatto paṭipajjī’’ti.

Then the Venerable Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, it would be good if the monks who follow the schismatics were to receive the higher ordination again." "Enough, Sāriputta. Do not approve of the re-ordination of the monks who follow the schismatics. Instead, Sāriputta, you should have the monks who follow the schismatics confess a serious offense. But how, Sāriputta, did Devadatta behave?" "Just as, Venerable sir, the Blessed One, after spending much of the night instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging the monks with a Dhamma talk, addresses me: 'Sāriputta, the community of monks is free from dullness and drowsiness. Let a Dhamma talk occur to you, Sāriputta. My back is weary; I will stretch it.' In the same way, Venerable sir, Devadatta behaved."

346. Atha kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘bhūtapubbaṃ, bhikkhave, araññāyatane mahāsarasī. Taṃ nāgā upanissāya vihariṃsu. Te taṃ sarasiṃ ogāhetvā, soṇḍāya bhisamuḷālaṃ abbuhitvā, suvikkhālitaṃ vikkhāletvā, akaddamaṃ saṅkhāditvā, ajjhoharanti. Tesaṃ taṃ vaṇṇāya ceva hoti, balāya ca. Na ca tatonidānaṃ maraṇaṃ vā nigacchanti, maraṇamattaṃ vā dukkhaṃ. Tesaṃyeva kho pana, bhikkhave, mahānāgānaṃ anusikkhamānā taruṇā bhiṅkacchāpā. Te taṃ sarasiṃ ogāhetvā, soṇḍāya bhisamuḷālaṃ abbuhitvā, na suvikkhālitaṃ vikkhāletvā, sakaddamaṃ saṅkhāditvā, ajjhoharanti. Tesaṃ taṃ neva vaṇṇāya hoti, na balāya. Tatonidānañca maraṇaṃ vā nigacchanti, maraṇamattaṃ vā dukkhaṃ. Evameva kho, bhikkhave, devadatto mamānukrubbaṃ [mamānukubbaṃ (sī. syā.)] kapaṇo marissatīti.

346.Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks, formerly, there was a great lake in a forest retreat. Elephants lived relying on it. They would enter that lake, pull up lotus roots and stalks with their trunks, thoroughly wash them, chew them free of mud, and ingest them. That was both for their complexion and for their strength. And because of that they did not meet death or suffering leading to death. But, monks, some young elephant calves, imitating those great elephants, would enter that lake, pull up lotus roots and stalks with their trunks, not wash them thoroughly, chew them with the mud, and ingest them. That was neither for their complexion nor for their strength. And because of that, they met death or suffering leading to death. In the same way, monks, Devadatta, imitating me, the wretched one, will die."

‘‘Mahāvarāhassa mahiṃ vikrubbato [vikubbato (sī. syā.)], bhisaṃ ghasānassa [ghasamānassa (ka.)] nadīsu jaggato;Bhiṅkova paṅkaṃ abhibhakkhayitvā, mamānukrubbaṃ kapaṇo marissatī’’ti.

"Like the great elephant tearing up the earth, eating lotus roots, keeping vigil in the rivers; having devoured the mud like a blue fly, the wretched one, imitating me, will die."

347. [a. ni. 8.16] ‘‘Aṭṭhahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgato bhikkhu dūteyyaṃ gantumarahati. Katamehi aṭṭhahi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sotā ca hoti, sāvetā ca, uggahetā ca, dhāretā ca, viññātā ca, viññāpetā ca, kusalo ca sahitāsahitassa, no ca kalahakārako – imehi kho, bhikkhave, aṭṭhahaṅgehi samannāgato bhikkhu dūteyyaṃ gantumarahati.

347."Monks, a bhikkhu endowed with eight qualities is fit to undertake a mission. Which eight? Here, monks, a bhikkhu listens, causes (others) to listen, learns, remembers, understands, makes (others) understand, is skilled in what is coherent and incoherent, and is not a quarrel-maker. Monks, a bhikkhu endowed with these eight qualities is fit to undertake a mission."

[a. ni. 8.16] ‘‘Aṭṭhahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgato sāriputto dūteyyaṃ gantumarahati. Katamehi aṭṭhahi? Idha, bhikkhave, sāriputto sotā ca hoti, sāvetā ca, uggahetā ca, dhāretā ca, viññātā ca, viññāpetā ca, kusalo ca sahitāsahitassa, no ca kalahakārako – imehi kho, bhikkhave, aṭṭhahaṅgehi samannāgato sāriputto dūteyyaṃ gantumarahatīti.

"Monks, Sāriputta is fit to undertake a mission, endowed with eight qualities. Which eight? Here, monks, Sāriputta is one who listens, who causes to listen, who learns, who remembers, who understands, who causes to understand, who is skilled in what is coherent and incoherent, and who is not a quarrel-maker. Monks, Sāriputta, endowed with these eight qualities, is fit to undertake a mission."

[a. ni. 8.16] ‘‘Yo ve na byathati [byādhati (sī. syā.)] patvā, parisaṃ uggavādiniṃ;Na ca hāpeti vacanaṃ, na ca chādeti sāsanaṃ.

"He who is not perturbed when facing an assembly that speaks harshly, Nor does he lose his words, nor obscure the teaching."

‘‘Asandiddho ca akkhāti [akkhātā (ka.)], pucchito ca na kuppati;Sa ve tādisako bhikkhu, dūteyyaṃ gantumarahatī’’ti.

Because, monks, if he dwells not overcoming an arisen gain, defilements, distress, and fever might arise in him. But if he dwells overcoming again and again an arisen gain, such defilements, distress, and fever do not occur. Because, monks, if he dwells not overcoming an arisen loss… an arisen fame… an arisen disrepute… an arisen honor… an arisen dishonor… an arisen evil desire… an arisen bad companionship, defilements, distress, and fever might arise in him. But if he dwells overcoming again and again an arisen bad companionship, such defilements, distress, and fever do not occur. This, monks, is the beneficial reason why a bhikkhu should live overcoming again and again any arisen gain, any arisen loss… any arisen fame… any arisen disrepute… any arisen honor… any arisen dishonor… any arisen evil desire… any arisen bad companionship. Therefore, monks, we should live overcoming again and again any arisen gain, any arisen loss… any arisen fame… any arisen disrepute… any arisen honor… any arisen dishonor… any arisen evil desire… any arisen bad companionship.

‘‘Mā jātu koci lokasmiṃ, pāpiccho udapajjatha;Tadamināpi jānātha, pāpicchānaṃ yathāgati.

‘‘Paṇḍitoti samaññāto, bhāvitattoti sammato;Jalaṃva yasasā aṭṭhā, devadattoti me sutaṃ.

‘‘Aduṭṭhassa hi yo dubbhe, pāpakammaṃ akrubbato;Tameva pāpaṃ phusati, duṭṭhacittaṃ anādaraṃ.

‘‘Samuddaṃ visakumbhena, yo maññeyya padūsituṃ [padussituṃ (ka.)];Na so tena padūseyya, bhesmā hi udadhī mahā.

"One who would think to pollute the ocean with a pot of poison; He would not pollute it, for the mighty ocean is formidable."

‘‘Evameva tathāgataṃ, yo vādenupahiṃsati;Samaggataṃ [sammāgataṃ (sī.), samagataṃ (syā.)] santacittaṃ, vādo tamhi na rūhati.

Even so, whoever harms the Tathagata with words, who is unified and serene in mind, no argument takes root in him.

The Questions of Upāli

351. Atha kho āyasmā upāli yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā upāli bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘saṅgharāji saṅgharājīti, bhante, vuccati. Kittāvatā nu kho, bhante, saṅgharāji hoti, no ca saṅghabhedo? Kittāvatā ca pana saṅgharāji ceva hoti saṅghabhedo cā’’ti?

351.Then the Venerable Upāli approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the Venerable Upāli said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, it is said, ‘faction in the Sangha, faction in the Sangha.’ To what extent, venerable sir, is there a faction in the Sangha, but not a split in the Sangha? And to what extent is there both a faction in the Sangha and a split in the Sangha?”

‘‘Ekato, upāli, eko hoti, ekato dve, catuttho anussāveti, salākaṃ gāheti – ‘ayaṃ dhammo, ayaṃ vinayo, idaṃ satthusāsanaṃ, imaṃ gaṇhatha, imaṃ rocethā’ti. Evampi kho, upāli, saṅgharāji hoti, no ca saṅghabhedo. Ekato, upāli, dve honti, ekato dve, pañcamo anussāveti, salākaṃ gāheti – ‘ayaṃ dhammo, ayaṃ vinayo, idaṃ satthusāsanaṃ, imaṃ gaṇhatha, imaṃ rocethā’ti. Evampi kho, upāli, saṅgharāji hoti, no ca saṅghabhedo. Ekato, upāli, dve honti, ekato tayo, chaṭṭho anussāveti, salākaṃ gāheti – ‘ayaṃ dhammo, ayaṃ vinayo, idaṃ satthusāsanaṃ, imaṃ gaṇhatha, imaṃ rocethā’ti. Evampi kho, upāli, saṅgharāji hoti, no ca saṅghabhedo. Ekato, upāli, tayo honti, ekato tayo, sattamo anussāveti, salākaṃ gāheti – ‘ayaṃ dhammo, ayaṃ vinayo, idaṃ satthusāsanaṃ, imaṃ gaṇhatha, imaṃ rocethā’ti. Evampi kho, upāli, saṅgharāji hoti, no ca saṅghabhedo. Ekato, upāli, tayo honti, ekato cattāro, aṭṭhamo anussāveti, salākaṃ gāheti – ‘ayaṃ dhammo, ayaṃ vinayo, idaṃ satthusāsanaṃ, imaṃ gaṇhatha, imaṃ rocethā’ti.

Ekato, upāli, cattāro honti, ekato cattāro, navamo anussāveti, salākaṃ gāheti – ‘ayaṃ dhammo, ayaṃ vinayo, idaṃ satthusāsanaṃ, imaṃ gaṇhatha, imaṃ rocethā’ti. Evaṃ kho, upāli, saṅgharāji ceva hoti saṅghabhedo ca. Navannaṃ vā, upāli, atirekanavannaṃ vā saṅgharāji ceva hoti saṅghabhedo ca. Na kho, upāli, bhikkhunī saṅghaṃ bhindati, api ca bhedāya parakkamati, na sikkhamānā saṅghaṃ bhindati…pe… na sāmaṇero saṅghaṃ bhindati, na sāmaṇerī saṅghaṃ bhindati, na upāsako saṅghaṃ bhindati, na upāsikā saṅghaṃ bhindati, api ca bhedāya parakkamati.

“Upāli, on one side there is one, on the other side there are two; a fourth announces and collects the voting ticket, saying: ‘This is the Dhamma, this is the Vinaya, this is the Teacher’s instruction; accept this, approve of this.’ Even in this way, Upāli, there is a faction in the Sangha, but not a split in the Sangha. Upāli, on one side there are two, on the other side there are two; a fifth announces and collects the voting ticket, saying: ‘This is the Dhamma, this is the Vinaya, this is the Teacher’s instruction; accept this, approve of this.’ Even in this way, Upāli, there is a faction in the Sangha, but not a split in the Sangha. Upāli, on one side there are two, on the other side there are three; a sixth announces and collects the voting ticket, saying: ‘This is the Dhamma, this is the Vinaya, this is the Teacher’s instruction; accept this, approve of this.’ Even in this way, Upāli, there is a faction in the Sangha, but not a split in the Sangha. Upāli, on one side there are three, on the other side there are three; a seventh announces and collects the voting ticket, saying: ‘This is the Dhamma, this is the Vinaya, this is the Teacher’s instruction; accept this, approve of this.’ Even in this way, Upāli, there is a faction in the Sangha, but not a split in the Sangha. Upāli, on one side there are three, on the other side there are four; an eighth announces and collects the voting ticket, saying: ‘This is the Dhamma, this is the Vinaya, this is the Teacher’s instruction; accept this, approve of this.’ Even in this way, Upāli, there is a faction in the Sangha, but not a split in the Sangha. Upāli, on one side there are four, on the other side there are four; a ninth announces and collects the voting ticket, saying: ‘This is the Dhamma, this is the Vinaya, this is the Teacher’s instruction; accept this, approve of this.’ In this way, Upāli, there is both a faction in the Sangha and a split in the Sangha. With nine, Upāli, or more than nine, there is both a faction in the Sangha and a split in the Sangha. Upāli, a bhikkhunī does not split the Sangha, but she may strive for a split. A trainee nun does not split the Sangha… A novice monk does not split the Sangha, a novice nun does not split the Sangha, a male lay follower does not split the Sangha, a female lay follower does not split the Sangha, but they may strive for a split. It is a bhikkhu, Upāli, who is in good standing, sharing the same communion, residing within the same boundary, who splits the Sangha.”

352.“‘A split in the Sangha, a split in the Sangha,’ venerable sir, it is said. To what extent, venerable sir, is the Sangha split?”

‘‘Idhupāli, bhikkhū adhammaṃ dhammoti dīpenti, dhammaṃ adhammoti dīpenti, avinayaṃ vinayoti dīpenti, vinayaṃ avinayoti dīpenti, abhāsitaṃ alapitaṃ tathāgatena bhāsitaṃ lapitaṃ tathāgatenāti dīpenti, bhāsitaṃ lapitaṃ tathāgatena abhāsitaṃ alapitaṃ tathāgatenāti dīpenti, anāciṇṇaṃ tathāgatena āciṇṇaṃ tathāgatenāti dīpenti, āciṇṇaṃ tathāgatena anāciṇṇaṃ tathāgatenāti dīpenti, apaññattaṃ tathāgatena paññattaṃ tathāgatenāti dīpenti, paññattaṃ tathāgatena apaññattaṃ tathāgatenāti dīpenti, anāpattiṃ āpattīti dīpenti, āpattiṃ anāpattīti dīpenti, lahukaṃ āpattiṃ garukā āpattīti dīpenti, garukaṃ āpattiṃ lahukā āpattīti dīpenti, sāvasesaṃ āpattiṃ anavasesā āpattīti dīpenti, anavasesaṃ āpattiṃ sāvasesā āpattīti dīpenti, duṭṭhullaṃ āpattiṃ aduṭṭhulā āpattīti dīpenti, aduṭṭhullaṃ āpattiṃ duṭṭhullā āpattīti dīpenti.

Ettāvatā kho, upāli, saṅgho bhinno hotī’’ti.

“Here, Upāli, monks explain what is not the Dhamma as the Dhamma, and the Dhamma as not the Dhamma; they explain what is not the Vinaya as the Vinaya, and the Vinaya as not the Vinaya; they explain what was not spoken or uttered by the Tathāgata as spoken or uttered by the Tathāgata, and what was spoken or uttered by the Tathāgata as not spoken or uttered by the Tathāgata; they explain what was not habitually practiced by the Tathāgata as habitually practiced by the Tathāgata, and what was habitually practiced by the Tathāgata as not habitually practiced by the Tathāgata; they explain what was not prescribed by the Tathāgata as prescribed by the Tathāgata, and what was prescribed by the Tathāgata as not prescribed by the Tathāgata; they explain a non-offense as an offense, and an offense as a non-offense; they explain a light offense as a grave offense, and a grave offense as a light offense; they explain an offense with residue as an offense without residue, and an offense without residue as an offense with residue; they explain a gross offense as a non-gross offense, and a non-gross offense as a gross offense. By these eighteen grounds, they draw away, they make clear, they perform the Uposatha separately, they perform the Pavāraṇā separately, they perform acts of the Sangha separately. To this extent, Upāli, the Sangha is split.”

Ettāvatā kho, upāli, saṅgho samaggo hotī’’ti.

353.“‘Harmony in the Sangha, harmony in the Sangha,’ venerable sir, it is said. To what extent, venerable sir, is the Sangha harmonious?” “Here, Upāli, monks explain what is not the Dhamma as not the Dhamma, and the Dhamma as the Dhamma; they explain what is not the Vinaya as not the Vinaya, and the Vinaya as the Vinaya; they explain what was not spoken or uttered by the Tathāgata as not spoken or uttered by the Tathāgata, and what was spoken or uttered by the Tathāgata as spoken or uttered by the Tathāgata; they explain what was not habitually practiced by the Tathāgata as not habitually practiced by the Tathāgata, and what was habitually practiced by the Tathāgata as habitually practiced by the Tathāgata; they explain what was not prescribed by the Tathāgata as not prescribed by the Tathāgata, and what was prescribed by the Tathāgata as prescribed by the Tathāgata; they explain a non-offense as a non-offense, and an offense as an offense; they explain a light offense as a light offense, and a grave offense as a grave offense; they explain an offense with residue as an offense with residue, and an offense without residue as an offense without residue; they explain a gross offense as a gross offense, and a non-gross offense as a non-gross offense. They do not draw away, they do not make clear, they do not perform the Uposatha separately, they do not perform the Pavāraṇā separately, and they do not carry out Sangha acts separately. To this extent, Upāli, the Sangha is harmonious.”

354. ‘‘Samaggaṃ pana, bhante, saṅghaṃ bhinditvā kiṃ so pasavatī’’ti? ‘‘Samaggaṃ kho, upāli, saṅghaṃ bhinditvā kappaṭṭhikaṃ kibbisaṃ pasavati, kappaṃ nirayamhi paccatī’’ti.

354.“But, venerable sir, what does one generate by splitting a united Sangha?” “Upāli, one who splits a united Sangha generates demerit lasting for an aeon; he is cooked in hell for an aeon.”

[itivu. 18; a. ni. 10.39] ‘‘Āpāyiko nerayiko, kappaṭṭho saṅghabhedako;Vaggarato adhammaṭṭho, yogakkhemā padhaṃsati;Saṅghaṃ samaggaṃ bhinditvā, kappaṃ nirayamhi paccatī’’ti.

“Bound for misery, hell-bound, remaining for an aeon, a Sangha-splitter; Delighting in partisanship, unrighteous, he falls away from security; Having split the united Sangha, he is cooked in hell for an aeon.”

‘‘Bhinnaṃ pana, bhante, saṅghaṃ samaggaṃ katvā kiṃ so pasavatī’’ti? ‘‘Bhinnaṃ kho, upāli, saṅghaṃ samaggaṃ katvā brahmaṃ puññaṃ pasavati, kappaṃ saggamhi modatī’’ti.

“Venerable sir, what does one generate by reuniting a split Sangha?” “Upāli, by reuniting a split Sangha, one generates great merit and rejoices in heaven for an aeon.”

[ittivu. 18; a. ni. 10.40] ‘‘Sukhā saṅghassa sāmaggī, samaggānañca anuggaho;Samaggarato dhammaṭṭho, yogakkhemā na dhaṃsati;Saṅghaṃ samaggaṃ katvāna, kappaṃ saggamhi modatī’’ti.

“Happy is concord in the Sangha, and support for those in concord. Delighting in harmony, established in the Dhamma, one does not fall away from security. Having made the Sangha harmonious, one rejoices in heaven for an aeon.”

355. [pari. 459] ‘‘Siyā nu kho, bhante, saṅghabhedako āpāyiko, nerayiko, kappaṭṭho, atekiccho’’ti? ‘‘Siyā, upāli, saṅghabhedako āpāyiko, nerayiko, kappaṭṭho, atekiccho’’ti.

355.“Venerable sir, could a Sangha-splitter be destined for a state of misery, destined for hell, destined to remain for an aeon, irredeemable?” “Yes, Upāli, a Sangha-splitter could be destined for a state of misery, destined for hell, destined to remain for an aeon, irredeemable.”

[pari. 459] ‘‘Siyā [siyā nu kho (syā. kaṃ.)] pana, bhante, saṅghabhedako na āpāyiko, na nerayiko, na kappaṭṭho, na atekiccho’’ti? ‘‘Siyā, upāli, saṅghabhedako na āpāyiko, na nerayiko, na kappaṭṭho, na atekiccho’’ti.

“Venerable sir, could a Sangha-splitter not be destined for a state of misery, not destined for hell, not destined to remain for an aeon, not irredeemable?” “Upāli, a Sangha-splitter could not be destined for a state of misery, not destined for hell, not destined to remain for an aeon, not irredeemable.”

‘‘Katamo pana, bhante, saṅghabhedako āpāyiko, nerayiko, kappaṭṭho, atekiccho’’ti? ‘‘Idhupāli, bhikkhu adhammaṃ dhammoti dīpeti.

“Venerable Sir, what kind of Sangha-splitter is bound for the states of woe, bound for hell, destined to remain for an eon, and incurable?” “Here, Upāli, a bhikkhu declares what is non-Dhamma to be Dhamma. Regarding that, he holds the view that it is non-Dhamma; regarding the split, he holds the view that it is non-Dhamma. Having abandoned his view, having abandoned his tolerance, having abandoned his preference, having abandoned his disposition, he makes an announcement and takes a voting ticket, saying: ‘This is the Dhamma, this is the Discipline, this is the Teacher’s instruction; accept this, approve of this.’ This, too, Upāli, is a Sangha-splitter bound for the states of woe, bound for hell, destined to remain for an eon, and incurable.”

“Furthermore, Upāli, a bhikkhu declares what is non-Dhamma to be Dhamma. Regarding that, he holds the view that it is non-Dhamma; regarding the split, he is doubtful.

The Chapter on Sangha-splitting is the seventh.

Tassuddānaṃ –

Its summary:

Anupiye abhiññātā, sukhumālo na icchati;Kasā vapā abhi ninne, niddhā lāve ca ubbahe.

At Anupiya, the well-known; Sukhumāla does not desire. Thin flesh, fat flowed downwards; buried, and in the reaping, carried upwards.

Puñjamaddapalālañca, bhusaophuṇanīhare;Āyatimpi na khīyanti, pitaro ca pitāmahā.

The heap of chaff and straw, the pile of husks and grass; Even in the future they are not depleted, the fathers and grandfathers.

Bhaddiyo anuruddho ca, ānando bhagu kimilo;Sakyamāno ca kosambiṃ, parihāyi kakudhena ca.

Bhaddiya and Anuruddha, Ānanda, Bhagu, Kimila; Sākyamāna at Kosambi, and Kakudha who had fallen away.

Pakāsesi pituno ca, purise silaṃ nāḷāgiriṃ;Tikapañcagaruko kho, bhindi thullaccayena ca;Tayo aṭṭha puna tīṇi, rāji bhedā siyā nu khoti.

He proclaimed his father's virtue, and the elephant Nāḷāgiri's training; Three-five times heavy, and broke by a gross offense; Three, eight, and again three; would there be divisions of the kingdom?
