1.The Account of the Council

437. Atha kho āyasmā mahākassapo bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘ekamidāhaṃ, āvuso, samayaṃ pāvāya kusināraṃ addhānamaggappaṭipanno mahatā bhikkhusaṅghena saddhiṃ pañcamattehi bhikkhusatehi. Atha khvāhaṃ, āvuso, maggā okkamma aññatarasmiṃ rukkhamūle nisīdiṃ.

437.Then the Venerable Mahākassapa addressed the bhikkhus: “Once, friends, I was traveling along the road from Pāvā to Kusinārā with a large company of bhikkhus, about five hundred in number. Then, friends, I left the road and sat down at the foot of a certain tree.”

[dī. ni. 2.231] ‘‘Tena kho pana samayena aññataro ājīvako kusinārāya mandāravapupphaṃ gahetvā pāvaṃ addhānamaggappaṭipanno hoti. Addasaṃ kho ahaṃ, āvuso, taṃ ājīvakaṃ dūratova āgacchantaṃ. Disvāna taṃ ājīvakaṃ etadavocaṃ – ‘apāvuso, amhākaṃ satthāraṃ jānāsī’ti? ‘Āmāvuso, jānāmi. Ajja sattāhaparinibbuto samaṇo gotamo. Tato me idaṃ mandāravapupphaṃ gahita’nti. Tatrāvuso, ye te bhikkhū avītarāgā appekacce bāhā paggayha kandanti, chinnapātaṃ papatanti, āvaṭṭanti, vivaṭṭanti – atikhippaṃ bhagavā parinibbuto, atikhippaṃ sugato parinibbuto, atikhippaṃ cakkhuṃ loke antarahitanti. Ye pana te bhikkhū vītarāgā te satā sampajānā adhivāsenti – aniccā saṅkhārā, taṃ kutettha labbhāti.

“At that time, friends, a certain Ājīvaka, having obtained a mandārava flower from Kusinārā, was traveling along the road to Pāvā. I saw, friends, that Ājīvaka coming from afar. Seeing him, I said to that Ājīvaka: ‘Friend, do you know our Teacher?’ ‘Yes, friend, I know. The ascetic Gotama attained final Nibbāna seven days ago today. It was from there that I obtained this mandārava flower.’ There, friends, those bhikkhus who were not free from passion—some of them stretched out their arms and wept, fell prostrate as if cut down, rolled around, and writhed, lamenting: ‘Too quickly has the Blessed One attained final Nibbāna! Too quickly has the Sugata attained final Nibbāna! Too quickly has the Eye disappeared from the world!’ But those bhikkhus who were free from passion, mindful and fully aware, endured, reflecting: ‘Impermanent are conditioned things; how could it be otherwise?’ ”

‘‘Atha khvāhaṃ, āvuso, te bhikkhū etadavocaṃ – ‘alaṃ, āvuso, mā socittha; mā paridevittha. Nanvetaṃ, āvuso, bhagavatā paṭikacceva akkhātaṃ – sabbeheva piyehi manāpehi nānābhāvo vinābhāvo aññathābhāvo. Taṃ kutettha āvuso labbhā, yaṃ taṃ jātaṃ bhūtaṃ saṅkhataṃ palokadhammaṃ, taṃ vata mā palujjīti – netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjatī’ti.

“Then, friends, I said to those bhikkhus: ‘Enough, friends, do not grieve; do not lament. Has not the Blessed One already declared this explicitly—that separation, disunion, and otherness are the destiny of all that is dear and beloved? How then, friends, can this be obtained here, that what is born, come into being, conditioned, and subject to decay should not decay? This is not possible.’ ”

‘‘Tena kho panāvuso, samayena subhaddo nāma vuḍḍhapabbajito tassaṃ parisāyaṃ nisinno hoti. Atha kho, āvuso, subhaddo vuḍḍhapabbajito te bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘alaṃ, āvuso, mā socittha; mā paridevittha. Sumuttā mayaṃ tena mahāsamaṇena; upaddutā ca mayaṃ homa – idaṃ vo kappati, idaṃ vo na kappatīti. Idāni pana mayaṃ yaṃ icchissāma taṃ karissāma, yaṃ na icchissāma na taṃ karissāmā’ti. Handa mayaṃ, āvuso, dhammañca vinayañca saṅgāyāma. Pure adhammo dippati [dibbati (ka.)], dhammo paṭibāhiyyati; pure avinayo dippati vinayo paṭibāhiyyati; pure adhammavādino balavanto honti, dhammavādino dubbalā honti; pure avinayavādino balavanto honti, vinayavādino dubbalā hontī’’ti.

“At that time, friends, there was an elderly renunciant named Subhadda seated in that assembly. Then, friends, the elderly renunciant Subhadda said this to those bhikkhus: ‘Enough, friends! Do not grieve, do not lament! We are well rid of that great ascetic. We were oppressed by him: “This is allowable for you, this is not allowable for you.” But now we can do what we like, and not do what we don’t like.’ Come, friends, let us recite the Dhamma and the Discipline. Before unrighteousness flourishes and righteousness is suppressed; before indiscipline flourishes and discipline is suppressed; before those who speak unrighteousness are strong and those who speak righteousness are weak; before those who speak indiscipline are strong and those who speak discipline are weak.”

‘‘Tena hi, bhante, thero bhikkhū uccinatū’’ti. Atha kho āyasmā mahākassapo ekenūnapañcaarahantasatāni uccini. Bhikkhū āyasmantaṃ mahākassapaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘ayaṃ, bhante, āyasmā ānando kiñcāpi sekkho, abhabbo chandā dosā mohā bhayā agatiṃ gantuṃ. Bahu ca anena bhagavato santike dhammo ca vinayo ca pariyatto. Tena hi, bhante, thero āyasmantampi ānandaṃ uccinatū’’ti. Atha kho āyasmā mahākassapo āyasmantampi ānandaṃ uccini.

“Then, venerable sir, let the Elder select the bhikkhus.” Then the Venerable Mahākassapa selected four hundred and ninety-nine arahants. The bhikkhus said to the Venerable Mahākassapa: “Venerable sir, this Venerable Ānanda, although still a learner, is incapable of going to a wrong destination due to desire, hatred, delusion, or fear. Moreover, he has learned much of the Dhamma and the Vinaya in the presence of the Blessed One. Therefore, venerable sir, let the Elder also select Venerable Ānanda.” Then the Venerable Mahākassapa also selected Venerable Ānanda.

Atha kho therānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘kattha nu kho mayaṃ dhammañca vinayañca saṅgāyeyyāmā’’ti? Atha kho therānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘rājagahaṃ kho mahāgocaraṃ pahūtasenāsanaṃ, yaṃnūna mayaṃ rājagahe vassaṃ vasantā dhammañca vinayañca saṅgāyeyyāma. Na aññe bhikkhū rājagahe vassaṃ upagaccheyyu’’nti.

Then the elder bhikkhus had this thought: “Where should we recite the Dhamma and the Vinaya?” Then the elder bhikkhus had this thought: “Rājagaha has a large alms-resort and plentiful lodgings. Why don't we spend the rains-residence in Rājagaha and recite the Dhamma and the Vinaya? And let no other bhikkhus undertake the rains-residence in Rājagaha.”

Atha kho āyasmā mahākassapo saṅghaṃ ñāpesi –

Then the Venerable Mahākassapa informed the Saṅgha:

438. ‘‘Suṇātu me, āvuso, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho imāni pañca bhikkhusatāni sammanneyya – rājagahe vassaṃ vasantāni dhammañca vinayañca saṅgāyituṃ, na aññehi bhikkhūhi rājagahe vassaṃ vasitabbanti. Esā ñatti.

438.“Listen to me, friends, the Saṅgha. If it seems right to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should appoint these five hundred bhikkhus to spend the rains-residence in Rājagaha and to recite the Dhamma and the Vinaya, and that no other bhikkhus should undertake the rains-residence in Rājagaha. This is the motion.”

‘‘Suṇātu me, āvuso, saṅgho. Imāni pañca bhikkhusatāni sammannati – rājagahe vassaṃ vasantāni dhammañca vinayañca saṅgāyituṃ, na aññehi bhikkhūhi rājagahe vassaṃ vasitabbanti. Yassāyasmato khamati imesaṃ pañcannaṃ bhikkhusatānaṃ sammuti – rājagahe vassaṃ vasantānaṃ dhammañca vinayañca saṅgāyituṃ, na aññehi bhikkhūhi rājagahe vassaṃ vasitabbanti – so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“Listen to me, friends, the Saṅgha. These five hundred bhikkhus are being appointed—to spend the rains-residence in Rājagaha and to recite the Dhamma and the Vinaya, and that no other bhikkhus are to undertake the rains-residence in Rājagaha. If the appointment of these five hundred bhikkhus—to spend the rains-residence in Rājagaha and to recite the Dhamma and the Vinaya, and that no other bhikkhus are to undertake the rains-residence in Rājagaha—is acceptable to any venerable one, let him remain silent. If it is not acceptable, let him speak.”

‘‘Sammatāni saṅghena imāni pañca bhikkhusatāni rājagahe vassaṃ vasantāni dhammañca vinayañca saṅgāyituṃ, na aññehi bhikkhūhi rājagahe vassaṃ vasitabbanti. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

“These five hundred bhikkhus have been appointed by the Saṅgha to spend the rains-residence in Rājagaha and to recite the Dhamma and the Vinaya, and that no other bhikkhus are to undertake the rains-residence in Rājagaha. The Saṅgha is agreeable, therefore it is silent. Thus I hold it.”

Atha kho therā bhikkhū rājagahaṃ agamaṃsu dhammañca vinayañca saṅgāyituṃ. Atha kho therānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ etadahosi – ‘‘bhagavatā kho, āvuso, khaṇḍaphullappaṭisaṅkharaṇaṃ vaṇṇitaṃ. Handa mayaṃ, āvuso, paṭhamaṃ māsaṃ khaṇḍaphullaṃ paṭisaṅkharoma; majjhimaṃ māsaṃ sannipatitvā dhammañca vinayañca saṅgāyissāmā’’ti.

Then the elder bhikkhus went to Rājagaha to recite the Dhamma and the Vinaya. Then the elder bhikkhus had this thought: “Friends, the Blessed One has praised the repairing of what is broken and dilapidated. Come, friends, let us first spend a month repairing what is broken and dilapidated; and then, gathering together in the intermediate month, we will recite the Dhamma and the Vinaya.”

Atha kho therā bhikkhū paṭhamaṃ māsaṃ khaṇḍaphullaṃ paṭisaṅkhariṃsu. Atha kho āyasmā ānando – sve sannipāto [sannipātoti (ka.)] na kho metaṃ patirūpaṃ, yohaṃ sekkho samāno sannipātaṃ gaccheyyanti – bahudeva rattiṃ kāyagatāya satiyā vītināmetvā rattiyā paccūsasamayaṃ ‘nipajjissāmī’ti kāyaṃ āvajjesi. Appattañca sīsaṃ bibbohanaṃ, bhūmito ca pādā muttā. Etasmiṃ antare anupādāya āsavehi cittaṃ vimucci.

Then the Venerable Ānanda thought: “Tomorrow is the assembly. It is not proper for me, a learner, to attend the assembly.” So he spent much of the night developing mindfulness of the body. As dawn approached, thinking, “I will lie down,” he directed his body. But before his head reached the pillow, and his feet had lifted from the ground, at that moment his mind was liberated from the taints without clinging.

439. Atha kho āyasmā ānando arahā samāno sannipātaṃ agamāsi. Atha kho āyasmā mahākassapo saṅghaṃ ñāpesi –

439.Then the Venerable Ānanda, being an arahant, attended the assembly. Then the Venerable Mahākassapa informed the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, āvuso, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, ahaṃ upāliṃ vinayaṃ puccheyya’’nti.

“Listen to me, friends, the Saṅgha. If the Saṅgha is ready, I would question Upāli about the Vinaya.”

Āyasmā upāli saṅghaṃ ñāpesi –

The Venerable Upāli informed the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, ahaṃ āyasmatā mahākassapena vinayaṃ puṭṭho vissajjeyya’’nti.

“Venerable sirs, may the Saṅgha hear me. If it seems right to the Saṅgha, I will answer the Venerable Mahākassapa’s questions about the Vinaya when questioned.”

Atha kho āyasmā mahākassapo āyasmantaṃ upāliṃ etadavoca – ‘‘paṭhamaṃ, āvuso upāli, pārājikaṃ kattha paññatta’’nti? ‘‘Vesāliyaṃ bhante’’ti. ‘‘Kaṃ ārabbhā’’ti? ‘‘Sudinnaṃ kalandaputtaṃ ārabbhā’’ti. ‘‘Kismiṃ vatthusmi’’nti? ‘‘Methunadhamme’’ti. Atha kho āyasmā mahākassapo āyasmantaṃ upāliṃ paṭhamassa pārājikassa vatthumpi pucchi, nidānampi pucchi, puggalampi pucchi, paññattimpi pucchi, anupaññattimpi pucchi, āpattimpi pucchi, anāpattimpi pucchi. ‘‘Dutiyaṃ panāvuso upāli, pārājikaṃ kattha paññatta’’nti? ‘‘Rājagahe bhante’’ti. ‘‘Kaṃ ārabbhā’’ti? ‘‘Dhaniyaṃ kumbhakāraputtaṃ ārabbhā’’ti. ‘‘Kismiṃ vatthusmi’’nti? ‘‘Adinnādāne’’ti. Atha kho āyasmā mahākassapo āyasmantaṃ upāliṃ dutiyassa pārājikassa vatthumpi pucchi, nidānampi pucchi, puggalampi pucchi, paññattimpi pucchi, anupaññattimpi pucchi, āpattimpi pucchi, anāpattimpi pucchi. ‘‘Tatiyaṃ panāvuso upāli, pārājikaṃ kattha paññatta’’nti? ‘‘Vesāliyaṃ bhante’’ti. ‘‘Kaṃ ārabbhā’’ti? ‘‘Sambahule bhikkhū ārabbhā’’ti. ‘‘Kismiṃ vatthusmi’’nti? ‘‘Manussaviggahe’’ti. Atha kho āyasmā mahākassapo āyasmantaṃ upāliṃ tatiyassa pārājikassa vatthumpi pucchi, nidānampi pucchi, puggalampi pucchi, paññattimpi pucchi, anupaññattimpi pucchi, āpattimpi pucchi, anāpattimpi pucchi. ‘‘Catutthaṃ panāvuso upāli, pārājikaṃ kattha paññatta’’nti? ‘‘Vesāliyaṃ bhante’’ti. ‘‘Kaṃ ārabbhā’’ti? ‘‘Vaggumudātīriye bhikkhū ārabbhā’’ti. ‘‘Kismiṃ vatthusmi’’nti? ‘‘Uttarimanussadhamme’’ti. Atha kho āyasmā mahākassapo āyasmantaṃ upāliṃ catutthassa pārājikassa vatthumpi pucchi, nidānampi pucchi, puggalampi pucchi, paññattimpi pucchi, anupaññattimpi pucchi, āpattimpi pucchi, anāpattimpi pucchi. Eteneva upāyena ubhatovibhaṅge pucchi. Puṭṭho puṭṭho āyasmā upāli vissajjesi.

Then the Venerable Mahākassapa addressed the Venerable Upāli: “Friend Upāli, where was the first pārājika rule laid down?” “At Vesālī, venerable sir.” “In regard to whom?” “In regard to Sudinna, the son of the Kalandas.” “On what subject?” “On sexual intercourse.” Then the Venerable Mahākassapa questioned the Venerable Upāli about the case, the origin, the person, the ruling, the additional ruling, the offense, and the non-offense of the first pārājika. “And where, friend Upāli, was the second pārājika rule laid down?” “At Rājagaha, venerable sir.” “In regard to whom?” “In regard to Dhaniya, the potter’s son.” “On what subject?” “On theft.” Then the Venerable Mahākassapa questioned the Venerable Upāli about the case, the origin, the person, the ruling, the additional ruling, the offense, and the non-offense of the second pārājika. “And where, friend Upāli, was the third pārājika rule laid down?” “At Vesālī, venerable sir.” “In regard to whom?” “In regard to several bhikkhus.” “On what subject?” “On taking human life.” Then the Venerable Mahākassapa questioned the Venerable Upāli about the case, the origin, the person, the ruling, the additional ruling, the offense, and the non-offense of the third pārājika. “And where, friend Upāli, was the fourth pārājika rule laid down?” “At Vesālī, venerable sir.” “In regard to whom?” “In regard to the bhikkhus from the banks of the Vaggumudā.” “On what subject?” “On superhuman qualities.” Then the Venerable Mahākassapa questioned the Venerable Upāli about the case, the origin, the person, the ruling, the additional ruling, the offense, and the non-offense of the fourth pārājika. In the same way, he questioned him about both Vibhaṅgas. Questioned on each point, the Venerable Upāli answered.

440. Atha kho āyasmā mahākassapo saṅghaṃ ñāpesi –

440.Then the Venerable Mahākassapa informed the Saṅgha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, āvuso, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, ahaṃ ānandaṃ dhammaṃ puccheyya’’nti.

“Listen to me, friends, the Saṅgha. If it seems right to the Saṅgha, I would question Ānanda about the Dhamma.”

Āyasmā ānando saṅghaṃ ñāpesi –

The Venerable Ānanda informed the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, bhante, saṅgho. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, ahaṃ āyasmatā mahākassapena dhammaṃ puṭṭho vissajjeyya’’nti.

“Venerable sirs, may the Sangha hear me. If it seems fit to the Sangha, I will answer the Venerable Mahākassapa’s question about the Dhamma.”

Atha kho āyasmā mahākassapo āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘brahmajālaṃ, āvuso ānanda, kattha bhāsita’’nti? ‘‘Antarā ca, bhante, rājagahaṃ antarā ca nāḷandaṃ rājāgārake ambalaṭṭhikāyā’’ti. ‘‘Kaṃ ārabbhā’’ti? ‘‘Suppiyañca paribbājakaṃ brahmadattañca māṇava’’nti. Atha kho āyasmā mahākassapo āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ brahmajālassa nidānampi pucchi, puggalampi pucchi. ‘‘Sāmaññaphalaṃ panāvuso ānanda, kattha bhāsita’’nti? ‘‘Rājagahe, bhante, jīvakambavane’’ti. ‘‘Kena saddhi’’nti? ‘‘Ajātasattunā vedehiputtena saddhi’’nti. Atha kho āyasmā mahākassapo āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ sāmaññaphalassa nidānampi pucchi, puggalampi pucchi. Eteneva upāyena pañcapi nikāye pucchi. Puṭṭho puṭṭho āyasmā ānando vissajjesi.

Then the Venerable Mahākassapa said to the Venerable Ānanda: “Friend Ānanda, where was the Brahmajāla Sutta spoken?” “Between Rājagaha and Nāḷandā, venerable sir, at the royal rest-house in Ambalaṭṭhikā.” “With reference to whom?” “The wanderer Suppiya and the brahmin student Brahmadatta.” Then the Venerable Mahākassapa asked the Venerable Ānanda about the occasion for the Brahmajāla Sutta and the individuals involved. “And where, friend Ānanda, was the Sāmaññaphala Sutta spoken?” “In Rājagaha, venerable sir, in Jīvaka’s mango grove.” “With whom?” “With Prince Ajātasattu, the son of the Videhan queen.” Then the Venerable Mahākassapa asked the Venerable Ānanda about the occasion for the Sāmaññaphala Sutta and the individuals involved. In the same way, he asked about the five Nikāyas. Questioned repeatedly, the Venerable Ānanda explained.

2.The Discussion on the Minor and Lesser Training Rules

441. Atha kho āyasmā ānando there bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘bhagavā maṃ, bhante, parinibbānakāle evamāha – ‘ākaṅkhamāno, ānanda, saṅgho mamaccayena khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadāni samūhaneyyā’’’ti. ‘‘Pucchi pana tvaṃ, āvuso ānanda, bhagavantaṃ – ‘katamāni pana, bhante, khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadānī’’’ti? ‘‘Na khohaṃ, bhante, bhagavantaṃ pucchiṃ – ‘katamāni pana, bhante, khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadānī’’ti. Ekacce therā evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘cattāri pārājikāni ṭhapetvā, avasesāni khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadānī’’ti. Ekacce therā evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘cattāri pārājikāni ṭhapetvā, terasa saṅghādisese ṭhapetvā, avasesāni khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadānī’’ti. Ekacce therā evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘cattāri pārājikāni ṭhapetvā, terasa saṅghādisese ṭhapetvā, dve aniyate ṭhapetvā, avasesāni khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadānī’’ti. Ekacce therā evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘cattāri pārājikāni ṭhapetvā, terasa saṅghādisese ṭhapetvā, dve aniyate ṭhapetvā, tiṃsa nissaggiye pācittiye ṭhapetvā, avasesāni khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadānī’’ti. Ekacce therā evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘cattāri pārājikāni ṭhapetvā, terasa saṅghādisese ṭhapetvā, dve aniyate ṭhapetvā, tiṃsa nissaggiye pācittiye ṭhapetvā, dvenavuti pācittiye ṭhapetvā, avasesāni khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadānī’’ti. Ekacce therā evamāhaṃsu – ‘‘cattāri pārājikāni ṭhapetvā, terasa saṅghādisese ṭhapetvā, dve aniyate ṭhapetvā, tiṃsa nissaggiye pācittiye ṭhapetvā, dvenavuti pācittiye ṭhapetvā, cattāro pāṭidesanīye ṭhapetvā, avasesāni khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadānī’’ti.

441.Then the Venerable Ānanda said to the elder monks: “Venerable sirs, at the time of his final passing the Blessed One said to me: ‘Ānanda, if the Sangha wishes, after my passing it may abolish the minor and lesser training rules.’” “But did you, friend Ānanda, ask the Blessed One: ‘Venerable sir, what are the minor and lesser training rules?’” “No, venerable sirs, I did not ask the Blessed One: ‘Venerable sir, what are the minor and lesser training rules?’” Some elders said: “Apart from the four pārājikas, the rest are minor and lesser training rules.” Some elders said: “Apart from the four pārājikas and the thirteen saṅghādisesas, the rest are minor and lesser training rules.” Some elders said: “Apart from the four pārājikas, the thirteen saṅghādisesas, and the two aniyatas, the rest are minor and lesser training rules.” Some elders said: “Apart from the four pārājikas, the thirteen saṅghādisesas, the two aniyatas, and the thirty nissaggiya pācittiyas, the rest are minor and lesser training rules.” Some elders said: “Apart from the four pārājikas, the thirteen saṅghādisesas, the two aniyatas, the thirty nissaggiya pācittiyas, and the ninety-two pācittiyas, the rest are minor and lesser training rules.” Some elders said: “Apart from the four pārājikas, the thirteen saṅghādisesas, the two aniyatas, the thirty nissaggiya pācittiyas, the ninety-two pācittiyas, and the four pāṭidesanīyas, the rest are minor and lesser training rules.”

442. Atha kho āyasmā mahākassapo saṅghaṃ ñāpesi –

442.Then the Venerable Mahākassapa informed the Sangha:

‘‘Suṇātu me, āvuso, saṅgho. Santamhākaṃ sikkhāpadāni gihigatāni. Gihinopi jānanti – ‘idaṃ vo samaṇānaṃ sakyaputtiyānaṃ kappati, idaṃ vo na kappatī’ti. Sace mayaṃ khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadāni samūhanissāma, bhavissanti vattāro – ‘dhūmakālikaṃ samaṇena gotamena sāvakānaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ paññattaṃ. Yāvimesaṃ satthā aṭṭhāsi tāvime sikkhāpadesu sikkhiṃsu. Yato imesaṃ satthā parinibbuto, na dānime sikkhāpadesu sikkhantī’ti. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho appaññattaṃ nappaññapeyya, paññattaṃ na samucchindeyya, yathāpaññattesu sikkhāpadesu samādāya vatteyya. Esā ñatti.

“Listen to me, friends, Sangha. We have training rules that have become household knowledge. Even householders know, ‘This is allowable for you, ascetics, sons of the Sakyans; this is not allowable for you.’ If we were to abolish the minor and lesser training rules, there will be those who say, ‘The ascetic Gotama prescribed training rules for his disciples only for a limited time. As long as their Teacher remained, they trained in these training rules. But since their Teacher has passed away, they no longer train in these training rules.’ If it seems fit to the Sangha, the Sangha should not prescribe what has not been prescribed, nor abolish what has been prescribed, but should conduct itself by undertaking the training rules as they have been prescribed. This is the motion.”

‘‘Suṇātu me, āvuso, saṅgho. Santamhākaṃ sikkhāpadāni gihigatāni. Gihinopi jānanti – ‘idaṃ vo samaṇānaṃ sakyaputtiyānaṃ kappati, idaṃ vo na kappatī’ti. Sace mayaṃ khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadāni samūhanissāma, bhavissanti vattāro – ‘dhūmakālikaṃ samaṇena gotamena sāvakānaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ paññattaṃ. Yāvimesaṃ satthā aṭṭhāsi tāvime sikkhāpadesu sikkhiṃsu. Yato imesaṃ satthā parinibbuto, na dānime sikkhāpadesu sikkhantī’ti. Saṅgho appaññattaṃ nappaññapeti, paññattaṃ na samucchindati, yathāpaññattesu sikkhāpadesu samādāya vattati. Yassāyasmato khamati appaññattassa appaññāpanā, paññattassa asamucchedo, yathāpaññattesu sikkhāpadesu samādāya vattanā, so tuṇhassa; yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.

“Listen to me, friends, Sangha. We have training rules that have become common knowledge among householders. Even householders know, ‘This is allowable for you, ascetics, sons of the Sakyans; this is not allowable for you.’ If we were to abolish the minor and lesser training rules, there would be those who say, ‘The ascetic Gotama prescribed training rules for his disciples for only a time. As long as their teacher remained, they trained in these rules. Now that their teacher has passed away, they no longer train in these rules.’ The Sangha does not prescribe what has not been prescribed, nor does it abolish what has been prescribed, but undertakes and conducts itself according to the training rules as they have been prescribed. If it seems fit to the venerable ones that what has not been prescribed should not be prescribed, that what has been prescribed should not be abolished, and that one should undertake and conduct oneself according to the training rules as they have been prescribed, let them be silent; if anyone does not approve, they should speak.”

‘‘Saṅgho appaññattaṃ nappaññapeti, paññattaṃ na samucchindati, yathāpaññattesu sikkhāpadesu samādāya vattati. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī, evametaṃ dhārayāmī’’ti.

“The Sangha does not prescribe what has not been prescribed, and does not abolish what has been prescribed, but undertakes and conducts itself according to the training rules as they have been prescribed. It is agreeable to the Sangha, therefore it is silent. Thus do I hold it.”

443.Then the elder monks said to the Venerable Ānanda: “This is a fault for you, friend Ānanda, that you did not ask the Blessed One: ‘What, venerable sir, are the minor and lesser training rules?’ Acknowledge that fault.” “I, venerable sirs, was unmindful and did not ask the Blessed One: ‘What, venerable sir, are the minor and lesser training rules?’ I do not see that as a fault, but out of faith in the venerable ones, I acknowledge that fault.”“This too is a fault for you, friend Ānanda, that you sewed the Blessed One’s rain-robe while stepping on it. Acknowledge that fault.” “I, venerable sirs, did not sew the Blessed One’s rain-robe stepping on it disrespectfully. I do not see that as a fault, but out of faith in the venerable ones, I acknowledge that fault.”“This too is a fault for you, friend Ānanda, that you had women pay homage to the Blessed One’s body first, so that the Blessed One’s body was moistened with the tears of the weeping women. Acknowledge that fault.” “I, venerable sirs, thinking, ‘Lest they delay at the wrong time,’ had women pay homage to the Blessed One’s body first. I do not see that as a fault, but out of faith in the venerable ones, I acknowledge that fault.”“This too is a fault for you, friend Ānanda, that when the Blessed One gave a striking sign and displayed a striking radiance, you did not request the Blessed One: ‘May the Blessed One remain for an eon, may the Fortunate One remain for an eon, for the benefit of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of gods and humans.’ Acknowledge that fault.” “I, venerable sirs, with my mind possessed by Māra, did not request the Blessed One: ‘May the Blessed One remain for an eon, may the Fortunate One remain for an eon, for the benefit of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of gods and humans.’ I do not see that as a fault, but out of faith in the venerable ones, I acknowledge that fault.”“This too is a fault for you, friend Ānanda, that you made an effort to promote the going forth of women in the Dhamma-Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata. Acknowledge that fault.” “I, venerable sirs, thinking that this Mahāpajāpati Gotamī was the Blessed One’s maternal aunt, his nurse, his fostermother, the giver of milk after the mother of the Blessed One had passed away, made an effort to promote the going forth of women in the Dhamma-Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata. I do not see that as a fault, but out of faith in the venerable ones, I acknowledge that fault.”

444.At that time, Venerable Purāṇa was wandering in the Southern Hills with a large assembly of some five hundred monks. Then, after staying in the Southern Hills as long as he pleased, having had the Dhamma and Vinaya recited together by the elder monks, Venerable Purāṇa went to Rājagaha, to the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary, where the elder monks were. Having approached, he exchanged courteous greetings with the elder monks and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the elder monks said to Venerable Purāṇa: "Friend Purāṇa, the Dhamma and Vinaya have been recited together by the elders. Come, join that recitation." "The Dhamma and Vinaya have been well recited together by the elders, friends. Nevertheless, I will retain it just as I have heard and received it in the presence of the Blessed One."

3.The Story of the Brahma-Penalty

445. Atha kho āyasmā ānando there bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘bhagavā maṃ, bhante, parinibbānakāle evamāha – ‘tena hānanda, saṅgho mamaccayena channassa bhikkhuno brahmadaṇḍaṃ āṇāpetū’’’ti. ‘‘Pucchi pana tvaṃ, āvuso ānanda, bhagavantaṃ – ‘katamo pana, bhante, brahmadaṇḍo’’’ti? ‘‘Pucchiṃ khohaṃ, bhante, bhagavantaṃ – ‘katamo pana, bhante, brahmadaṇḍo’’’ti? ‘‘Channo, ānanda, bhikkhu yaṃ iccheyya taṃ vadeyya. Bhikkhūhi channo bhikkhu neva vattabbo, na ovaditabbo, nānusāsitabbo’’ti. ‘‘Tena hāvuso ānanda, tvaṃyeva channassa bhikkhuno brahmadaṇḍaṃ āṇāpehī’’ti. ‘‘Kathāhaṃ, bhante, channassa bhikkhuno brahmadaṇḍaṃ āṇāpemi, caṇḍo so bhikkhu pharuso’’ti? ‘Tena hāvuso ānanda, bahukehi bhikkhūhi saddhiṃ gacchāhī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ bhante’’ti kho āyasmā ānando therānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ paṭissutvā mahatā bhikkhusaṅghena saddhiṃ pañcamattehi bhikkhusatehi nāvāya ujjavanikāya kosambiṃ ujjavi, nāvāya paccorohitvā rañño udenassa [utenassa (ka.)] uyyānassa avidūre aññatarasmiṃ rukkhamūle nisīdi. Tena kho pana samayena rājā udeno uyyāne paricāresi saddhiṃ orodhena. Assosi kho rañño udenassa orodho – ‘‘amhākaṃ kira ācariyo ayyo ānando uyyānassa avidūre aññatarasmiṃ rukkhamūle nisinno’’ti. Atha kho rañño udenassa orodho rājānaṃ udenaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘amhākaṃ kira, deva, ācariyo ayyo ānando uyyānassa avidūre aññatarasmiṃ rukkhamūle nisinno. Icchāma mayaṃ, deva, ayyaṃ ānandaṃ passitu’’nti. ‘‘Tena hi tumhe samaṇaṃ ānandaṃ passathā’’ti.

445.Then Venerable Ānanda said to the elder monks, "Venerable sirs, the Blessed One said to me at the time of his final passing: 'Therefore, Ānanda, after my passing, let the Saṅgha impose the Brahma-penalty on the monk Channa.'" "But did you ask the Blessed One, friend Ānanda, 'What, venerable sir, is the Brahma-penalty?'" "I did ask the Blessed One, venerable sirs, 'What, venerable sir, is the Brahma-penalty?'" "The monk Channa, Ānanda, may say whatever he wishes. The monks should not speak to the monk Channa, nor advise him, nor instruct him." "Then, friend Ānanda, you yourself should impose the Brahma-penalty on the monk Channa." "How, venerable sirs, can I impose the Brahma-penalty on the monk Channa? He is headstrong and harsh." "Then, friend Ānanda, go with a large number of monks." "Yes, venerable sirs," Venerable Ānanda replied to the elder monks. Then, accompanied by a large Saṅgha of monks—some five hundred monks—he crossed by boat to Kosambī, to Ujjavanikā. After disembarking from the boat, he sat down at the foot of a certain tree not far from King Udena's park. At that time, King Udena was amusing himself in the park with his women. King Udena's women heard, "Our teacher, Venerable Ānanda, is sitting at the foot of a certain tree not far from the park." Then King Udena's women said to King Udena, "Our teacher, Venerable Ānanda, is sitting at the foot of a certain tree not far from the park. We wish, sire, to see Venerable Ānanda." "Then you may see the ascetic Ānanda."

Atha kho rañño udenassa orodho yenāyasmā ānando tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho rañño udenassa orodhaṃ āyasmā ānando dhammiyā kathāya sandassesi samādapesi samuttejesi sampahaṃsesi.

Disvāna orodhaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘api nu kho tumhe samaṇaṃ ānandaṃ passitthā’’ti? ‘‘Apassimhā kho mayaṃ, deva, ayyaṃ ānanda’’nti. ‘‘Api nu tumhe samaṇassa ānandassa kiñci adatthā’’ti? ‘‘Adamhā kho mayaṃ, deva, ayyassa ānandassa pañca uttarāsaṅgasatānī’’ti. Rājā udeno ujjhāyati khiyyati vipāceti – ‘‘kathañhi nāma samaṇo ānando tāva bahuṃ cīvaraṃ paṭiggahessati! Dussavāṇijjaṃ vā samaṇo ānando karissati, paggāhikasālaṃ vā pasāressatī’’ti!

Then the women of King Udena's harem approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the Venerable Ānanda instructed, inspired, and gladdened the women of King Udena's harem with a Dhamma talk. Having been instructed, inspired, and gladdened by the Venerable Ānanda with a Dhamma talk, the women of King Udena's harem offered five hundred upper robes to the Venerable Ānanda. Then, having rejoiced and expressed appreciation for the Venerable Ānanda’s words, the women rose from their seats, paid homage to the Venerable Ānanda, circumambulated him, and went to King Udena. King Udena saw the women of the harem coming from afar and said to them, “Did you see the ascetic Ānanda?” “Yes, lord, we saw the Venerable Ānanda.” “Did you give anything to the ascetic Ānanda?” “Yes, lord, we gave five hundred upper robes to the Venerable Ānanda.” King Udena became annoyed, irritated, and displeased, saying, “How can the ascetic Ānanda accept so much robe material? Is the ascetic Ānanda going to engage in cloth trade or set up a shop?”

Atha kho rājā udeno yenāyasmā ānando tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā āyasmatā ānandena saddhiṃ sammodi. Sammodanīyaṃ kathaṃ sāraṇīyaṃ vītisāretvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho rājā udeno āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘āgamā nu khvidha, bho ānanda, amhākaṃ orodho’’ti? ‘‘Āgamāsi kho te idha, mahārāja, orodho’’ti. ‘‘Api pana bhoto ānandassa kiñci adāsī’’ti? ‘‘Adāsi kho me, mahārāja, pañca uttarāsaṅgasatānī’’ti. ‘‘Kiṃ pana bhavaṃ ānando tāva bahuṃ cīvaraṃ karissatī’’ti? ‘‘Ye [ye pana (ka.)] te, mahārāja, bhikkhū dubbalacīvarā tehi saddhiṃ saṃvibhajissāmī’’ti. ‘‘Yāni kho pana, bho ānanda, porāṇakāni dubbalacīvarāni tāni kathaṃ karissathā’’ti? ‘‘Tāni, mahārāja, uttarattharaṇaṃ karissāmā’’ti. ‘‘Yāni pana, bho ānanda, porāṇakāni uttarattharaṇāni tāni kathaṃ karissathā’’ti? ‘‘Tāni, mahārāja, bhisicchaviyo karissāmā’’ti. ‘‘Yā pana, bho ānanda, porāṇakā bhisicchaviyo tā kathaṃ karissathā’’ti? ‘‘Tā, mahārāja, bhūmattharaṇaṃ karissāmā’’ti. ‘‘Yāni pana, bho ānanda, porāṇakāni bhūmattharaṇāni tāni kathaṃ karissathā’’ti? ‘‘Tāni, mahārāja, pādapuñchaniyo karissāmā’’ti. ‘‘Yā pana, bho ānanda, porāṇakā pādapuñchaniyo tā kathaṃ karissathā’’ti?. ‘‘Tā, mahārāja, rajoharaṇaṃ karissāmā’’ti. ‘‘Yāni pana, bho ānanda, porāṇakāni rajoharaṇāni tāni kathaṃ karissathā’’ti? ‘‘Tāni, mahārāja, koṭṭetvā cikkhallena madditvā paribhaṇḍaṃ limpissāmā’’ti.

Then King Udena approached Venerable Ānanda, and having approached, he exchanged friendly greetings with Venerable Ānanda. After exchanging courteous and amiable talk, he sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, King Udena said to Venerable Ānanda: "Pray, Ānanda, has our retinue arrived here?" "Yes, great king, your retinue has arrived here." "Did they give anything to Venerable Ānanda?" "Yes, great king, they gave me five hundred upper robes." "What will Venerable Ānanda do with so many robes?" "Great king, I will share them with those monks who have worn out robes." "And what will you do with the old, worn out robes, Ānanda?" "Great king, we will make them into upper coverings." "And what will you do with the old upper coverings, Ānanda?" "Great king, we will make them into mattress covers." "And what will you do with the old mattress covers?" "Great king, we will make them into floor coverings." "And what will you do with the old floor coverings?" "Great king, we will make them into foot-wipers." "And what will you do with the old foot-wipers?" "Great king, we will make them into dusters." "And what will you do with the old dusters?" "Great king, we will pound them, mix them with mud, and use them to plaster the walls."

Atha kho rājā udeno – sabbevime samaṇā sakyaputtiyā yoniso upanenti, na kulavaṃ gamentīti – āyasmato ānandassa aññānipi pañca dussasatāni pādāsi. Ayañcarahi āyasmato ānandassa paṭhamaṃ cīvarabhikkhā uppajji cīvarasahassaṃ. Atha kho āyasmā ānando yena ghositārāmo tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi. Atha kho āyasmā channo yenāyasmā ānando tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho āyasmantaṃ channaṃ āyasmā ānando etadavoca – ‘‘saṅghena te, āvuso channa, brahmadaṇḍo āṇāpito’’ti.

Then King Udena thought, "All these Sakyan ascetics apply themselves thoroughly, and do not lead astray from the lineage." So he gave Venerable Ānanda another five hundred sets of cloths. And this was the first robes-alms that arose for Venerable Ānanda, a thousand robes. Then Venerable Ānanda went to Ghosita’s Park, and upon arriving, he sat down on the prepared seat. Then Venerable Channa approached Venerable Ānanda, paid respects to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, Venerable Ānanda said to Venerable Channa, "Friend Channa, the Saṅgha has imposed upon you the Brahma-penalty."

‘‘Katamo pana, bhante ānanda, brahmadaṇḍo āṇāpito’’ti? ‘‘Tvaṃ, āvuso channa, bhikkhū yaṃ iccheyyāsi taṃ vadeyyāsi. Bhikkhūhi tvaṃ neva vattabbo, na ovaditabbo, nānusāsitabbo’’ti. ‘‘Nanvāhaṃ, bhante ānanda, hato ettāvatā, yatohaṃ bhikkhūhi neva vattabbo, na ovaditabbo, nānusāsitabbo’’ti tattheva mucchito papato. Atha kho āyasmā channo brahmadaṇḍena aṭṭīyamāno harāyamāno jigucchamāno eko vūpakaṭṭho appamatto ātāpī pahitatto viharanto nacirasseva yassatthāya kulaputtā sammadeva agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajanti, tadanuttaraṃ brahmacariyapariyosānaṃ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja vihāsi. ‘Khīṇā jāti, vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ, kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ, nāparaṃ itthattāyā’ti abbhaññāsi. Aññataro ca panāyasmā channo arahataṃ ahosi. Atha kho āyasmā channo arahattaṃ patto yenāyasmā ānando tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘paṭippassambhehi dāni me, bhante ānanda, brahmadaṇḍa’’nti. ‘‘Yadaggena tayā, āvuso channa, arahattaṃ sacchikataṃ tadaggena te brahmadaṇḍo paṭippassaddho’’ti. Imāya kho pana vinayasaṅgītiyā pañca bhikkhusatāni anūnāni anadhikāni ahesuṃ. Tasmā ayaṃ vinayasaṅgīti ‘‘pañcasatikā’’ti vuccatīti.

"Venerable Ananda, what is this Brahma-penalty that has been declared?" "Friend Channa, you may say whatever you wish to the monks. But the monks will neither speak to you, nor advise you, nor instruct you." "Venerable Ananda, am I not already as good as dead, since the monks will neither speak to me, nor advise me, nor instruct me?" Right then and there, he collapsed in despair. Then, the Venerable Channa, distressed, humiliated, and disgusted by the Brahma-penalty, dwelled alone, secluded, diligent, ardent, and resolute. Before long, he realized for himself in this very life the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness. Having directly known and attained it by his own insight, he dwelled therein. He understood: "Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of existence." And the Venerable Channa became one of the arahants. Then, the Venerable Channa, having attained arahantship, approached the Venerable Ananda and said: "Venerable Ananda, let the Brahma-penalty be rescinded for me now." "Friend Channa, the Brahma-penalty was rescinded for you at the very moment you realized arahantship." At this Vinaya recitation, there were five hundred monks—no less, no more. Therefore, this Vinaya recitation is called "The Five Hundred."

Pañcasatikakkhandhako ekādasamo.

The Eleventh Chapter on the Five Hundred.

Imamhi khandhake vatthū tevīsati.

In this section, there are twenty-three topics.

Tassuddānaṃ –

Its summary:

Parinibbute sambuddhe, thero kassapasavhayo;Āmantayi bhikkhugaṇaṃ, saddhammamanupālako;Pāvāyaddhānamaggamhi, subhaddena paveditaṃ;Saṅgāyissāma saddhammaṃ, adhammo pure dippati.

When the Fully Enlightened One had attained final Nibbāna, the elder Kassapa, known by that name, addressed the assembly of monks, the guardian of the true Dhamma: "On the road to Pāvā from Addhā, Subhadda proclaimed his views. Let us recite the true Dhamma together, before what is not Dhamma shines forth."

Ekenūna pañcasataṃ, ānandampi ca uccini;Dhammavinayasaṅgītiṃ, vasanto guhamuttame.

Five hundred minus one, and Ānanda too I chose; Dwelling in the excellent cave, I recited the Dhamma and Discipline.

Upāliṃ vinayaṃ pucchi, suttantānandapaṇḍitaṃ;Piṭakaṃ tīṇi saṅgītiṃ, akaṃsu jinasāvakā.

They asked Upāli about the Vinaya and Ānanda, the expert in the Suttas. The disciples of the Conqueror compiled the three Piṭakas in the Council.

Na pucchi akkamitvāna, vandāpesi na yāci ca.

Without asking, without stepping forward,He neither made others pay homage nor begged.

Pabbajjaṃ mātugāmassa, saddhāya dukkaṭāni me;Purāṇo brahmadaṇḍañca, orodho udenena saha.

The ordination of women, my misdeeds concerning faith, the ancient Brahma-penalty, and the restraint with Udena.

Tāva bahu dubbalañca, uttarattharaṇā bhisi;Bhūmattharaṇā puñchaniyo, rajo cikkhallamaddanā.

So much that is weak and frail, upper coverings and mattresses, ground coverings, dusters, and the treading on dust and mud.

Sahassacīvaraṃ uppajji, paṭhamānandasavhayo;Tajjito brahmadaṇḍena, catussaccaṃ apāpuṇi;Vasībhūtā pañcasatā, tasmā pañcasatī iti.

A thousand robes arose, the first named Ānanda; struck by the Brahma-penalty, he attained the four truths; five hundred became masters, therefore it is called the Five Hundred.

Pañcasatikakkhandhakaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ.

The Chapter of the Five Hundred is concluded.
