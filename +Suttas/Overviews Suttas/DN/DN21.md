# DN21 - Sakkapañha Sutta - Sakka’s Questions
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> After hearing a love song from a god of music, the Buddha  engages in a deep discussion with sakka on the conditioned origin of attachment and suffering
Sakka, the deva-king, asks the Buddha about the sources of conflict, and about the path of practice that can bring it to an end. This discourse ends with a humorous account about Sakka's frustration in trying to learn the Dhamma from other contemplatives. It's hard to find a teacher when you're a king.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> How to be reborn in heaven and the results of practice correctly
What fetters all beings with enmity, violence, hostility, and ill wi'll
Happiness, sadness & equanimity, bodily & verbal behavior, faculties restraint that should cultivate, and that should not cultivate
The dart of doubt and uncertainty has lain within me for a long time, but the Buddha  has plucked it out
> 
> Arise  energy, mindfulness and dispassion
Concepts of identity causes thought, that causes desire, that causes like & dislike, that causes envy & stinginess, that causes hate & ill will
Cultivate those that unskillful qualities decline, and skillful qualities grow, not cultivate that unskillful qualities grow, and skillful qualities decline
Passion, sir, is a disease, an abscess, a dart. Passion drags a person to be reborn in life after life. 
That’s why a person finds themselves in states high and low.
