# DN6 - Mahāli Sutta - With Mahāli
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  explains to a diverse group of lay people how the results of meditation depend on the manner of development

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Importance of the purpose for developing samadhi
4 stages of awakening, gradual training, the soul and the body are the same or different things?
To answer the questions are the soul and the body the same thing, or they are different things?, One needs to follow the gradual training
The four noble fruits
> 
> One sided & two sided samadhi, clairvoyance, clairaudience
1 ending of three fetters, 2 weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, 3 ending of the five lower fetters, 4 realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom
Gradual training abbreviated
With the ending of three fetters a mendicant is a stream-enterer, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion—is a once-returner, with the ending of the five lower fetters, a mendicant is reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world, a mendicant has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life
