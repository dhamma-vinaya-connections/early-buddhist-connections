# DN11 - Kevaṭṭa Sutta - With Kevaddha
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  refuses to perform miracles, explaining that this is not the right way to inspire faith. He goes on to tell the story of a monk whose misguided quest for answers led him as far as Brahmā
This discourse explores the role of miracles and conversations with heavenly beings as a possible basis for faith and belief. The Buddha  does not deny the reality of such experiences, but he points out that — of all possible miracles — the only reliable one is the miracle of instruction in the proper training of the mind. As for heavenly beings, they are subject to greed, anger, and delusion, and so the information they give — especially with regard to the miracle of instruction — is not necessarily trustworthy. Thus the only valid basis for faith is the instruction that, when followed, brings about the end of one's own mental defilements.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Demonstration & drawbacks of psychic power and of revealing telepathy
When a mendicant instructs others like this: ‘think like this, not like that. Focus your mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live having achieved that.’This Is called the demonstration of instruction
Questions about cessation of elements to different gods, devine and heaven beings and finally to the Buddha
> 
> Psychic power: multiplying themselves, going unimpeded through a wall, diving in and out of the earth, walking on water, flying cross-legged, touching with the hand the sun and moon, going as far as the Brahmā realm and telepathy
Gradual training abbreviated 
The answer is: consciousness that’s invisible, 
Infinite, radiant all round. 
Here’s where water and earth, 
Fire and air find no footing
