# DN5 - Kūṭadanta Sutta - With Kūṭadanta
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A brahmin wishes to undertake a great sacrifice, and asks for the Buddha ’s advice. The Buddha  tells a legend of the past, in which a king is persuaded to give up violent sacrifice, and instead to devote his resources to supporting the needy citizens of his realm. However, even such a beneficial and non-violent sacrifice pales in comparison to the spiritual sacrifice of giving up attachments

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Brahmins qualities vs Buddha 's qualities
How to avoid crime in a kingdom, 16 accessories for a sacrifice, 3 modes of having remorse, how to dispell regret regarding the recipients in ten respects, how to perform a great sacrifice, list of greater sacrifices in ascending order
