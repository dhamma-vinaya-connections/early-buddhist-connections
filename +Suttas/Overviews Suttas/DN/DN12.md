# DN12 - Lohicca Sutta - With Lohicca
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A brahmin has fallen into the idea that there is no point in trying to offer spiritual help to others. The Buddha  goes to see him, and persuades him of the genuine benefits of spiritual teaching
A non-buddhist poses some good questions: if Dhamma is something that one must realize for oneself, then what is the role of a teacher? Are there any teachers who don't deserve some sort of criticism? The Buddha 's reply includes a sweeping summary of the entire path of practice.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Reasons to share the Dhamma and benefits for following it
 Teachers who deserve to be legitimate reprimanded
 The Buddha  is the teacher under whom a disciples achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded
> 
> Not sharing the Dhamma is unkindly, their heart is full of hostility, and they have wrong view.
The teacher who has not reached the goal & disciples don’t pay attention, who has not reached the goal & disciples follow him, who has reached the goal & disciples don’t pay attention to him
Gradual training abbreviated

> [!info] Similes
> A king not sharing his wealth like an ascetics not sharing his knowledge, like the woman that turns her back like 1st teacher, one abandon his field for someone else's like the 2end, someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond like 3rd
