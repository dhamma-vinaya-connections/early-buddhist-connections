# DN20 - Mahāsamaya - Great Congregation
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When deities from all realms gather in homage to the Buddha, he gives a series of verses describing them. These verses, which are commonly chanted in Theravadin countries, give one of the most detailed descriptions of the deities worshiped at the the time of the Buddha

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The mendicants there are immersed in samādhi,  they’ve straightened out their own minds.  Like a charioteer who has taken the reins,  the astute ones protect their senses.
The Buddhas of the past had, and the Buddhas of the future will have, gatherings of deities that are at most like the gathering for me now.
> 
> Anyone who has gone to the Buddha for refuge  won’t go to a plane of loss.  After giving up this human body,  they swell the hosts of gods.
I shall teach the names of the heavenly hosts.
>
