> Beginning with an account of the fates of disciples who had recently passed away, the scene shifts to a discussion of Dhamma held by the gods

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Rebirths of many devotees that practice rightly, council of the gods, three opportunities for achieving happiness
Four bases of psychic power, 8 qualities of the voice of Brahma, psychic power of multiple bodies
Noble path
Mindfulness of the body, feelings, mind & principles internally & externally
> 
> Three openings: 3 different circumstances before hearing the noble teaching, properly attend to how it applies to them, and practice accordingly
Basis of psychic power that has immersion due to inclination, diligence, ingenuity & inquiry
Right view gives rise to right thought. that gives rise to right speech. that  gives rise to right action. that gives rise to right livelihood. that  gives rise to right effort. that  gives rise to right mindfulness. that gives rise to right immersion. that  gives rise to right knowledge. that gives rise to right freedom
Observing them keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world, one becomes rightly immersed in that, and rightly serene
