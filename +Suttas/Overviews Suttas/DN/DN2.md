# DN2 - Sāmaññaphala Sutta - Fruits of the Ascetic Life
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The newly crowned king Ajātasattu is disturbed by the violent means by which he achieved the crown. He visits the Buddha  to find peace of mind, and asks him about the benefits of spiritual practice. This is one of the greatest literary and spiritual texts of early buddhism.
King ajatasattu asks the Buddha , "what are the fruits of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?" The Buddha  replies by painting a comprehensive portrait of the buddhist path of training, illustrating each stage of the training with vivid similes.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Wrong doctrines:
Mundane fruits of renunciation
Fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life
Bhikkhu's sila
Bhikkhu's right livelihood
8 physic powers
> 
> There is no merit or outcome of merit, beings are purified without cause, annihilationism, seven substances are not made & there is no-one, the fourfold restraint, evasiveness,
Fruit of bhikkhu life: mundane is respect even from the king independently of past caste
Hearing the Buddha 's  teaching, gain conviction, give up lay life, act skillfully by body and speech, purified in livelihood and accomplished in ethical conduct, guard the sense doors, have mindfulness and situational awareness, are content, abandon 5 hindrances, 4 jhanas, 8 knowledges, freedom
