# DN9 - Poṭṭhapāda Sutta - With Poṭṭhapāda
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The wandering ascetic potthapada brings to the Buddha  a tangle of questions concerning the nature of perception. The Buddha  clears up the matter by reviewing the fundamentals of concentration meditation and showing how it can lead to the ultimate cessation of perception.
The Buddha  discusses with a wanderer the nature of perception and how it evolves through deeper states of meditation. None of these, however, should be identified with a self or soul

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The training for the gradual cessation of perception, perceptions and the self,
Topics that are not conducive to the goal
I regard myself as consisting of a physical, or heavenly body [that belongs to] the realm of desire, or realm of form or formless
The teachings that are declared because they are conducive to the goal are the 4 noble truths
3 types of reincarnation
> 
> Gradual training abbreviated translation until 4 jhanas, then dimension of infinite space, infinite consciousness, dimension of nothingness and touch cessation
Politics, war, food, drinks, clothes, garland, family, vehicles, cities, travel, women, gossips, departed, motley, and states of rebirth
You should discard the idea that the self is the person’s  bodies [that belongs to] those realms, [because] it is only the idea of a person
that arises and perishes.
Undeclared teachings: the cosmos is eternal, the cosmos is not eternal’ … ‘the cosmos is finite’ … ‘the cosmos is infinite’ … ‘the soul is the same thing as the body’ … ‘the soul and the body are different things’ …‘a realized one exists after death’ … ‘a realized one doesn’t exist after death’ … ‘a realized one both exists and doesn’t exist after death’ … ‘a realized one neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death.
Substantial,  a mind-made and a non-physical reincarnations, and which one is real or fictitious
