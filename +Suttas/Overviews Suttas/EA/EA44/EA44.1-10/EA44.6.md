# EA44.6 - EA 44.6 - 6. Origin of Things
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  examines how the notion of a permanent self emerges from the process of perception. A wide range of phenomena are considered, embracing both naturalistic and cosmological dimensions. An unawakened person interprets experience in terms of a self, while those more advanced have the same experiences without attachment
In this difficult but important sutta the Buddha  reviews in depth one of the most fundamental principles of buddhist thought and practice: namely, that there is no thing — not even nibbana itself — that can rightly be regarded as the source from which all phenomena and experience emerge

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> An uneducated ordinary person perceives earth as earth so he conceives [things] about earth, he conceives [things] in earth, he conceives [things] coming out of earth, he conceives earth as 'mine,' he delights in earth. A trainee they shouldn’t identify with earth, they shouldn’t identify regarding earth, they shouldn’t identify as earth, they shouldn’t identify that ‘earth is mine’, they shouldn’t take pleasure in earth. Arahants don't conceive anything because they have completely understood them
He directly knows unbinding as unbinding. Directly knowing unbinding as unbinding, he does not conceive things about unbinding, does not conceive things in unbinding, does not conceive things coming out of unbinding, does not conceive unbinding as 'mine,' does not delight in unbinding
> 
> Same with 4 elements, beings, various gods, immaterial spheres, sense experience, unity and diversity, all, Nirvana 
He has understood that relishing is the root of suffering, and that rebirth comes from continued existence; whoever has come to be gets old and dies. That’s Why the realized one—with the ending, fading away, cessation, giving up, and letting go of all cravings—has awakened to the supreme perfect awakening
