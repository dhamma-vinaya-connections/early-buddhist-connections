# EA34.6 - EA 34.6 - 6. ?
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  advises on how to free himself of obsessive grieving. A wise person reflects on their nature, so they do not suffer when struck by loss

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Someone liable to old age should not grow old. That Someone liable to sickness should not get sick. … that someone liable to death should not die. … that someone liable to ending should not end. … that someone liable to perishing should not perish
> 
> Sorrowing and lamenting 
Doesn’t do even a little bit of good when an astute person doesn’t waver in the face of adversity, 
As they’re able to assess what’s beneficial
