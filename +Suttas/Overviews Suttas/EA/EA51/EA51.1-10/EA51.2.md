# EA51.2 - EA 51.2 - 2. ?
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> It's hard to meet someone who has not been, at some time in the distant past, your mother, father, son, daughter, sister, or brother

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A being who has not been your mother at one time in the past is not easy to find... A being who has not been your father... your brother... your sister... your son... your daughter
> 
> Long have you thus experienced stress, experienced pain, experienced loss, swelling the cemeteries — enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things, enough to become dispassionate, enough to be released
>
