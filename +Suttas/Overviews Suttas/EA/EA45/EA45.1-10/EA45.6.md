# EA45.6 - EA 45.6 - 6. ?
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  notices venerable Sāriputta’s glowing complexion, which is the result of his deep meditation. He then presents a series of reflections by which a mendicant can be sure that they are worthy of their alms-food

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Whether in the past, future, or present, all those who purify their alms-food do so by continually checking was there any desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion in my heart
Upon checking, a mendicant knows that they haven’t realized them, they should make an effort to do so.But Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that they have realized them, they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.
> 
> If so they should make an effort to give up those unskillful qualities, but if upon checking, a mendicant knows that there was no such desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion in their heart, they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.
Mendicant should reflect: ‘have I developed the four kinds of mindfulness meditation,  four right efforts … the four bases of psychic power … the five faculties … the five powers … the seven awakening factors … the noble eightfold path, serenity and discernment, have I realized knowledge and freedom, and have I given up the five kinds of sensual stimulation and the five hindrances
