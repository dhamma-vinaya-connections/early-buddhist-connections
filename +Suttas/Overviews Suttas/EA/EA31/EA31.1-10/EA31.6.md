# EA31.6 - EA 31.6 - 6. ?
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  strings a series of powerful similes—vipers, murderers, an empty village, and more—into an extended parable of the dangers of existence and the way of escape.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The man — afraid of the four vipers horrible venom, afraid of the five enemy executioners, afraid of the sixth fellow-traveling executioner with upraised sword, afraid of the village-plundering bandits
> 
> This shore to the other. The thought would occur to him, 'here is this great expanse of water, with the near shore dubious & risky, the further shore secure & free from risk
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Vipers, murderers, an empty village, floods, like the dangers of samsara
