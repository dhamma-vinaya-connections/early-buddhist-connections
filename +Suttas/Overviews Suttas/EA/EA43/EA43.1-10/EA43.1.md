# EA43.1 - EA 43.1 - 1. ?
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A well-traveled deva learns that we don't have to go to the ends of the world to find an end to suffering; we need look no further than right here, in this very body

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> It’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn
> 
> The end of the world can never 
Be reached by traveling. 
But without reaching the end of the world, 
There’s no release from suffering
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Runners trying to reach the end of the world
