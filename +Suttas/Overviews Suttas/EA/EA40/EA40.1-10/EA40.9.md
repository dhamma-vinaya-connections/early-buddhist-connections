# EA40.9 - EA 40.9 - 9. Seven Brahmins
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A precocious brahmin student is encouraged against his wishes to challenge the Buddha  on the question of caste. His reluctance turns out to be justified

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> This ascetic gotama advocates purification for all four classes and is a speaker of principle
For how could an offering to someone who is unethical and of bad character be very fruitful
> 
> Firstly you relied on birth,
Then you switched to education, then you switched to abstemious behavior. Now You’ve come around to believing in purification for the four classes, just as I advocate
For if any of the four classes were to refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and committing sexual misconduct; from using speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and from covetousness, malice, and wrong view, then, when their body breaks up, after death, they’d be reborn in a good place

> Fire from different woods is still the same, like liberation is the same regardless of castes
