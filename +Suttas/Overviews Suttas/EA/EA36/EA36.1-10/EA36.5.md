# EA36.5 - EA 36.5 - 5. ?
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Moggallāna ascended to the heaven of the thirty-three to address sakka, the lord of gods, and his extensive retinue. He spoke in praise of going for refuge, as it leads to heaven. Sakka affirmed this on multiple occasions, adding that gods who had gone for refuge and kept ethics surpassed the other deities in the heavens

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> It’s good to go for refuge to the Buddha  … the teaching … the saṅgha. It’s the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”
> 
> It’s good to have experiential confidence in the Buddha  … the teaching … the saṅgha … and to have the ethical conduct that’s loved by the noble ones … it’s the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place
