# EA41.1 - EA 41.1 - 1. ?
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  explains that mastery of the Dhamma comes from meditating on six factors in the mind, each of which should be understood deeply in six different ways. This sutta contains a lovely short verse pointing out the true cause of attachment based on sensuality.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Sensual pleasures, feelings, perceptions, defilement, deeds and suffering should be known.
> 
> And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.
