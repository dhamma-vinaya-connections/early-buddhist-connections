## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> After the rains season, Sāriputta takes leave of the Buddha . Another monk falsely accuses Sāriputta of hitting him before leaving. The Buddha  calls Sāriputta to answer the accusation. Before the saṅgha, Sāriputta denies it, uttering a powerful statement of spiritual prowess.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Being mindful of the body brings equanimity  like earth, water, fire and air, rags, humble, harmless, disgusted and repelled  by the body
> 
> I live with a heart like the earth, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. , and I’m horrified, repelled, and disgusted by this rotten body, that’s leaking and oozing from holes and cracks
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Repulsive of corpse hung around the neck , like being horrified by the body
