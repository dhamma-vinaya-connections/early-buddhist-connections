# EA42.1 - EA 42.1 - 1. ?
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Eight lost opportunities for spiritual practice

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A Buddha  has arisen in the world but one is reborn in hell, animal, ghost or god realms, as human but among strange barbarian tribes,  in a central country but one is witless, have wrong views, and no Buddha  arise in the world
> 
> Only on rare occasions 
Do realized ones arise.
If you find yourself in their presence, 
So hard to find in the world, 
And if you’ve gained a human birth, 
And the teaching of the dhamma; 
That’s enough to make an effort, 
For a person who loves themselves
