# EA12.6 - EA 12.6 - Senior Years
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Ven. Maha Kassapa explains why he chooses to continue meditating in the forest wilderness even though he has long since attained arahantship

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Awakened disciples of the Buddha  for a long time lived in the wilderness, ate only alms-food, wore rag robes, and owned just three robes; and they praised these things. They were of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, and energetic; and they praised these things
> 
> Mendicants these days are hard to admonish, having qualities that make them hard to admonish. They’re impatient, and don’t take instruction respectfully, with out the other qualities.  That is for their lasting harm and suffering
