# EA50.8 - EA 50.8 - The Snake Parable
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> One of the monks denies that prohibited conduct is really a problem. The monks and then the Buddha  subject him to an impressive dressing down. The Buddha  compares someone who understands only the letter of the teachings to someone who grabs a snake by the tail, and also invokes the famous simile of the raft
Using two famous similes, the Buddha  shows how the development of right view calls for the skillful application both of grasping and of letting-go. The sutta includes one of the canon's most important expositions on the topic of not-self.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them
 they’re correctly grasped, those teachings lead to their lasting welfare and happiness
By understanding the simile of the raft, you will even give up the teachings, let alone what is against the teachings
They regard form like this: ‘this is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 
They also regard feeling …perception … choices … whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, sought, and explored by the mind 
It’s when someone doesn’t think, 
‘oh, but it used to be mine, and it is mine no more. Oh, but it could be mine, and I will get it no more.’ They Don’t sorrow
 If it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is not fit to be regarded thus: ‘this is mine, I am this, this is my self
Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. 
Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re free
 give up what isn't yours. Giving It up will be for your lasting welfare and happiness
> 
> Sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks. it’s not possible to perform sensual acts without sensual pleasures, sensual perceptions, and sensual thoughts
Once they’ve memorized them, they examine their meaning with wisdom, 
And come to a reflective acceptance of them.They Don’t memorize the teaching for the sake of finding fault and winning debates. They Realize the goal for which they memorized them
Riding on the raft, and paddling with my hands and feet, I can safely reach the far shore. Then I will beach it on dry land or set it adrift on the water and go wherever I want
The self and the cosmos are one and the same. After death I will be permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’ 
They also regard this: ‘this is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self
They hear the realized one or their disciple teaching Dhamma for the uprooting of all grounds, fixations, obsessions, insistences, and underlying tendencies regarding views; for the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.
You should truly see any kind of form, feelings, perceptions, fabrications or consciousness  at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘this is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.
This is called a mendicant who has lifted up the cross-bar, filled in the trench, and pulled up the pillar; who is unbarred, a noble one with banner and burden put down, detached
Form, feeling … perception … choices … consciousness isn’t yours: give it up
> 

> [!info] Similes
> With the similes of a skeleton … 
a lump of meat … a grass torch … a pit of glowing coals … a dream … borrowed goods … fruit on a tree … a butcher’s knife and chopping block … a staking sword … a snake’s head
simile of the snake, like grasping the teachings in the right way
simile of the raft, like the teachings
grass, sticks, branches, and leaves in this Jeta’s Grove, being taken away or brun,  you wouldn't think, ‘This person is carrying us off
