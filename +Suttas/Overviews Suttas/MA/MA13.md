# MA13 - 度 - Tenets to Be Transcended
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  explains how three common views about pain and pleasure can, if followed to their logical conclusion, lead to a life of inaction. He then shows how pain and pleasure actually do come about and how they can be transcended.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The beliefs that everything is caused by past karma, by a creator god, or by chance all lead to inaction. The Buddha  teaches dependent origination
> 
> The Dhamma that I’ve taught is irrefutable, uncorruptedr: 6 elements, 6 bases of contact, 18 mental preoccupations and 4 noble truths
