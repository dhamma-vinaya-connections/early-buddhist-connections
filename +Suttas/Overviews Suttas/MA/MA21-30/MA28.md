# MA28 - 教化病 - Teaching the ill Anathapindika
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> As the great lay disciple anāthapiṇḍika lies Ill, venerable Sāriputta visits him and gives a powerful teaching 
When anāthapiṇḍika heard that a Buddha  had arisen in the world, he rose first thing in the morning to go and visit him. But a mysterious darkness caused him to hesitate, so a spirit repeatedly encouraged him to step forward. Finally he reached the Buddha , and asked if he had slept well

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> His mind, which has been fortified over a long time by faith, virtue, learning, generosity, wisdom, right views, understanding,  attentiveness and liberation 
A brahmin who is fully extinguished
Always sleeps well.
Sensual pleasures slide off them,
They’re cooled, free of attachments.
> 
> Recalling your qualities, you may be able to extinguish your pain and give rise to hap-piness and may attain
the fruit of once-returning or non-returning, as you
have already attained stream-entry
A hundred beautiful women, 
And any treasures 
Are not equal to one-sixteenth [of the worth] 
Of one step toward visiting the Buddha
