# MA64 - 天使 - Divine messengers
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> This discourse contains the most detailed descriptions of the horrors of hell

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind. 
Well, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence, .
, there he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings, yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhausted.
> 
> Messengers of the gods: I’m not exempt from rebirth,  from old age, from sickness, from death, someone who does bad deeds receives such punishment in the present life, what must happen to them in the next; 
Punish them with the five-fold crucifixion, throw them down and hack them with axes, harness them to a chariot, and drive them back and forth across burning ground, make them climb up and down a huge mountain of burning coals, seared in boiling scum, toss them into the great hell, immediately adjacent to the great hell is the vast dung hell, the vast hell of hot coals, the vast hell of the red silk-cotton wood,  vast hell of the sword-leaf trees, vast acid hell
