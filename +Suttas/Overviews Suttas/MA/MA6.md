# MA6 - 善人往 - Destination of a Good Person
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Seven kinds of rebirth for non-returners, as well as extinguishment by not grasping

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> With the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished between one life and the next, extinguished upon landing, without extra effort, with extra effort, going to the akaniṭṭha realm and liberation  by not grasping
> 
> They practice like this  I am giving up what exists, what has come to be.’ They gain equanimity. They’re Not attached to life, or to creating a new life. And they see with right wisdom that there is a peaceful state beyond. But They haven’t totally realized that state. They haven’t completely given up the underlying tendencies of conceit, attachment to life, and ignorance.
