# MA182 - 馬邑 - Discourse at Assapura 1
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  encourages the mendicants to live up to their name, by actually practicing in a way that meets or exceeds the expectations people have for renunciants
The Buddha  outlines the full course of training by which a meditator may earn the right to call him- or herself a true contemplative.
The labels of being a spiritual practitioner don’t just come from external trappings, but from sincere inner change.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> I declare to you: you who seek the recluse’s status, do not fall short of the goal of recluseship while there is more to be done.
Should train like this: ‘we will undertake and follow the things that make one an ascetic and a brahmin. That way our label will be accurate and our claim correct
Atrue  renunciant, brahmin, noble one, purified one
> 
> We won’t glorify ourselves or put others down on account of our pure bodily, verbally and mental behavior.
The training begins with conscience and concern for the results of one's actions, and leads progressively through the cultivation of virtue, sense-restraint,  alertness, abandon hindrances, four jhanas, finally culminating in the realization of the ending of Taints
It is one who has allayed all evil and unwhole_x0002_some states, all taints and pollutants, which are the root of future becoming, 
have vexation and suffering as their result, and are the cause of birth, old 
age, disease, and death.
