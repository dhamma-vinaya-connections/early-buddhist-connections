# MA152 - 鸚鵡 - With Subha
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Working hard is not valuable in and of itself; what matters is the outcome. And just as in lay life, spiritual practicalmay or may not lead to fruitful results

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Enjoys himself with these five kinds of sensual stimulation, tied, attached, blind to the drawbacks, and not understanding the escape.It’s Not possible for him to know or see
Because of right practice, both laypeople and renunciates succeed in the procedure of the skillful teaching, but making merit and succeeding in the skillful, I usually find them among renunciates, and less so among laypeople
6 prerequisites free mind of enmity: always tell the truth, practice austerities, be celibate, do lots of recitation, be very generous & compassion.
> 
> Rapture that’s apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities are the jhanas. that rapture is better than the sensual
The lay life is like farming in that it’s work with many requirements and when it fails it’s not very fruitful;but when it succeeds it is very fruitful. The Renunciate life is like trade in that it’s work with few requirements and when it fails it’s not very fruitful;but when it succeeds it is very fruitful
Meditate spreading a heart full of  love, compassion, rejoice and equanimity all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.

> Queue of blind men; fire that depends on grass and logs as fuel, or one that does not
Lay life as farming & renounce life as trade
Know the path to your own city , like the Buddha knows path to brahma
