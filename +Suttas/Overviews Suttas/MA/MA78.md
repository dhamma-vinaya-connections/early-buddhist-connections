# MA78 - 梵天請佛 - Brahmā’s Invitation to the Buddha
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  ascends to a high heavenly realm where he engages in a cosmic contest with a powerful divinity, who had fallen into the delusion that he was eternal and all-powerful
The Buddha  disarms two powerful antagonists through his profound understanding of the nature of consciousness

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Because what is actually impermanent, not lasting, transient, incomplete, and perishable, he says is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable
You are Māra the wicked. And Brahmā, Brahmā’s assembly, and Brahmā’s retinue have all fallen into your hands; they’re under your sway
Consciousness that is invisible, infinite, radiant all round—*that’s* what is not within the scope of experience based on earth, water, fire, air, creatures, gods, the creator, Brahmā, the gods of streaming radiance, the gods replete with glory, the gods of abundant fruit, the overlord, and the all
Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought,  we’ve never before seen or heard of any other ascetic or brahmin with psychic power and might like the ascetic gotama
> 
> Where there is being born, growing old, dying, passing away, and being reborn, he says that there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn
Brahmā, I understand your range and your light: a galaxy extends a thousand times as far
And there you wield your power.
You know the high and low, 
The passionate and dispassionate, 
And the coming and going of sentient beings 

Having directly known all as all, and having directly known that which does not fall within the scope of experience based on all, I did not identify with all, I did not identify regarding all, I did not identify as all, I did not identify ‘all is mine’, I did not enjoy all
Because the realized one has given up the defilements—corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death
