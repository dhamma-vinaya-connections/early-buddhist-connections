# MA133 - 優婆離 - With Upāli
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  disagrees with a jain ascetic on the question of whether physical or mental deeds are more important. When he hears of this, the jain disciple Upāli decides to visit the Buddha  and refute him, and proceeds despite all warnings

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> I describe three kinds of deed for performing bad deeds: 
Physical deeds, verbal deeds, and mental deeds
The Buddha  has many beautiful qualities to praise, many hundreds of such qualities
> 
> I describe mental deeds as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much physical deeds or verbal deed
He has cut off craving and is awakened, 
Free of fuming, unsullied; 
A mighty spirit worthy of offerings, 
Best of men, inestimable, 
Grand, he has reached the peak of glory: 
He is the Buddha , and I am his disciple
> 

> [!info] Similes
> A monkey and pair of garments dyed and pressed like other teachings and the Dhamma
A colorful garlands of flowers like praises to the Buddha
