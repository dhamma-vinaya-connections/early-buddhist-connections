# MA61 - 牛糞喻 - Cow Dung Parable
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A mendicant asks whether anything in the aggregates has even the tiniest bit of stability or permanence. The Buddha  answers using the simile of a little cow dung under his fingernail

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> There are no aggregates that is constant, lasting, eternal, not subject to change, that will stay just as it is as long as eternity, thus this living of the holy life for the right ending of suffering & stress is discerned
Having practiced meritorious deeds for a long time, I had practiced loving-kindness for seven years, I did not come to [be born in] this world for seven cosmic periods
of emergence and destruction
> 
> Whatever there is of form, feeling, of perception , of volitional formations . . . of consciousness, whether past, future, or present,
internal or external, gross or subtle, good or bad, near or far—all should be seen as it really is with wisdom thus: all that I am not, that is not mine, I do not belong to that.
In a past life, the Buddha  was a great king with vast properties, but all those conditions have passed away. It is enough,  to feel revulsion, to become dispassionate towards them, enough to be liberated from them.”

> Fingernail with soil and small lump of cow dung not even that is constant, pleasant nor myself
