# MA106 - 想 - Perceptions
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  examines how the notion of a permanent self emerges from the process of perception. A wide range of phenomena are considered, embracing both naturalistic and cosmological dimensions. An unawakened person interprets experience in terms of a self, while those more advanced have the same experiences without attachment

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Uneducated recluses take earth to be the self, or earth being part of the self, or the self being part of earth. Disciples and the Buddha don't conceive any because they truly understood it
> 
> Same with 4 elements, various gods, purity, immaterial spheres, sense experience, unity and diversity, all, insight, 
this world and that world
