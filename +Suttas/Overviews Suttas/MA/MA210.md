# MA210 - 法樂比丘尼 - Nun Dhammanandā
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The layman visākha asks the nun dhammadinnā about various difficult matters, including some of the highest meditation attainments. The Buddha  fully endorses her answers.
Dhammadinna the nun fields a series of Dhamma questions put to her by her former husband: questions on self-identification, cessation, penetration into the true nature of feeling, and the attainment of nibbana.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> These five grasping aggregates are identity. 
That is: form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness
Right speech, right action, and right livelihood are the noble group of virtue. Right mindfulness and right concentration are noble group of concentration. 
Right view, right intention, and right effort—these three path factors are noble group of wisdom
[When] a monk enters the concentration of cessation, perception and  knowing cease; [when] he enters the concentration of [neither-percep_x0002_tion-nor-]nonperception, perception and knowing do not cease
Anything felt physically or mentally as pleasant or enjoyable. This Is pleasant feeling. Anything Felt physically or mentally as painful or unpleasant. This Is painful feeling. Anything Felt physically or mentally as neither pleasurable nor painful. This Is neutral feeling
The underlying tendency for greed underlies pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency for repulsion underlies painful feeling. The underlying tendency for ignorance underlies neutral feeling
> 
> It is the remainderless cutting off of clinging to the body aggregate, feeling . . . perception . . . formations . . . consciousness aggregate, its 
abandonment, disgorging, eradication, nonpollution, cessation, appease_x0002_ment, disappearance—this is the cessation of personality
If the wholesome mind attains unification, this is concentration. The four establishments of mindfulness are the sign of concentration. The four 
right efforts are the strength of concentration. The four bases of supernormal  power are the achievement of concentration. If one cultivates all of these 
wholesome states, repeatedly and energetically cultivating them, then this is the cultivation of concentration. 
To attain the cessation of perception and feeling one does not think: ‘I will enter ’ or ‘I am entering or ‘I have entered the cessation of perception and feeling.’ Rather, their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state
Pleasant feeling is pleasant when it remains and painful when it perishes. 
Painful feeling is painful when it remains and pleasant when it perishes.Neutral Feeling is pleasant when there is knowledge, and painful when there is ignorance
With first jhana one he abandons passion, nursing yearning for the unexcelled liberations, there arises within him sorrow based on that yearning. With that he abandons resistance, and with four jhana one  abandons ignorance
