# MA157 - 黃蘆園 - At Yellow Reed Park
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The brahmin verañja rebukes the Buddha  for his lack of respect for senior brahmins. He levels a series of criticisms, each of which the Buddha  deflects by redefining terms. The Buddha  affirms that his claim to superiority is because he was the first to achieve awakening

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Lacks taste and without fear and teacher of inaction for bad conduct; exterminator and annihilation of greed, hate, and delusion, abortionist of future rebirth
> 
> In this population lost in ignorance, trapped in their shells, I alone have broken open the egg of ignorance and realized the supreme perfect awakening.
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Chicken that first to break out of the eggshell, like the Buddha  being first in awakening
