# MA163 - 分別六處 - Analysis of the Six Sense Fields
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A detailed analysis of the six senses and the relation to emotional and cognitive processes
A discussion of the emotions: where they come from, how they function in the path of practice, and how they manifest in an awakened person who is fit to teach others

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> 6 internal, 6 contacts
18 mental preoccupations 
36 positions of sentient beings
Relying on this, give up that
The teacher teaches the Dhamma out of kindness and compassion and remains unaffected, mindful and aware.
He guides a person in training to proceeds in eight directions
> 
> Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
Happiness, sadness & equanimity  of each senses
Laypeople and renunciate happiness, sadness & equanimity  of each senses
Relying on renunciates positions give up laypeople, then on happiness give up sadness, then on equanimity give up happiness, then on unity, and finally rely on non-identification
Whether his students follow him or not
Having physical form, they see visions, not perceiving physical form internally, they see visions externally, focused only on beauty, dimension of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, neither perception nor non-perception, the cessation of perception and feeling
