# MA179 - 五支物主 - Carpenter Pañcakaṅga
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Wanderer teaches that a person has reached the highest attainment when they keep four basic ethical precepts. The Buddha ’s standards are considerably higher.
The highest attainment is not simply the abandoning of unskillful actions and a reversion to childlike harmlessness. It requires first developing skillful habits and skillful resolves, and then letting them go.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Skillful deeds by way of body and speech, and purified livelihood, and they stem from a mind that is free from greed, hate, and delusion, their cessation is when a mendicant behaves ethically, but they don’t identify with their ethical behavior. 
Someone is practicing for the cessation of unskillful behaviors and thoughts being mindful of body, feelings, mind, and mental phenomena
Thoughts of sensuality, of malice, and of cruelty are unskillful, they stem from perceptions of sensuality, malice, and cruelty and they cease without anything left over in first jhana
When an individual has these ten qualities, I describe them as accomplished in wholesomeness, foremost in wholesomeness, an unsur-passable person who has attained the supreme essence, a true renunciant
> 
> Unskillful deeds by way of body and speech, and bad livelihood, they stem from a mind that has greed, hate, and delusion, their cessation it’s when a mendicant gives up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develops good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind; they give up wrong livelihood and earn a living by right livelihood,
Someone is practicing for the cessation of skillful behaviors and thoughts being mindful of body, feelings, mind, and mental phenomena
Thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness are called skillful, they stem from  perceptions of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness, and they cease without anything left over in the 4 jhana
Someone who has an adept’s right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right immersion, right knowledge, and right freedom

> [!info] Similes
> A person who do no bad deeds with their body; speak no bad words; think no bad thoughts; and don’t earn a living by bad livelihood, has attained the same level as a baby
