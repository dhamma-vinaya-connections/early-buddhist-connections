# MA166 - 釋中禪室尊 - Venerable One in a Meditation Hut among the Sakyans
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The verses about being present (MA 164) are explained in 5 aggregates context

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Don’t run back to the past,  don’t hope for the future. 
What’s past is left behind; 
The future has not arrived;
Phenomena in the present 
Are what one should contemplate,
Mindful of lack of stability. 
The wise awaken in this way. 
Undertaking [such] practice of noble ones, 
Who need worry about death? 
“I shall disengage from that, 
[This] great suffering and misery shall end
> 
> In past, present or future don't  delight in form, feelings,  perception . . . 
in formations . . . in consciousness, don't  desire,
attached, nor established in them
>
