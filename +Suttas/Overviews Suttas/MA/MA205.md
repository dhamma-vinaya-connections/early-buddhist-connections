# MA205 - 五下分結 - Five Lower Fetters
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A little baby has no wrong views or intentions, but the underlying tendency for these things is still there. Without practicing, they will inevitably recur

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The lower fetters taught by the Buddha  as follows: identity view, doubt, misapprehension of precepts and observances, sensual desire, and ill will
Due to the seclusion from attachments, the giving up of unskillful qualities, and the complete settling of physical discomfort—quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities enters in 4 jhanas and 3 immaterial jhanas
> 
> An educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. Their  heart is not overcome and mired in lower fetters and they truly understand the escape from fetters that has arisen. Those Fetters  along with any underlying tendency to it, is given up in them
With a mind is eager, confident, settled, and decided they contemplate the phenomena there—included in form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness—as impermanent, as suffering, as an affliction, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self. They Turn their mind away from those things, and apply it to the deathless element: ‘this is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, cessation, nibbana
