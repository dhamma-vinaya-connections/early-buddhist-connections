# MA81 - 念身 - Mindfulness of the body
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> This focuses on the first aspect of mindfulness meditation, the observation of the body. This set of practices, simple as they seem, have far-reaching benefits.
 This sutta serves as a companion to the anapanasati sutta, and explains the importance of establishing a broad awareness of the body in meditation to develop jhana

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts of the lay life are given up. Their Mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.That’s How a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body
Anyone who has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body includes all of the skillful qualities that play a part in realization, and Māra cannot find a vulnerability and doesn’t get hold of them
> 
> Mindfulness of the four 
postures, various activities, overcoming unwholesome states of mind, forceful control of the mind, 
mindfulness of breathing, the physical experience of the four jhānas, development of awareness of 
light, attending to the sign of [reviewing] contemplation, the anatomical parts of the body, the six ele-ments, and the cemetery contemplations.
Benefits: they prevail over desire and discontent, over fear and dread, endure cold, heat, hunger, and thirst and disagreeable things,  get the four absorption, wield the many kinds of psychic power, understand the minds of other beings, recollect many kinds of past lives, with clairvoyant see sentient beings passing away and being reborn, they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life
