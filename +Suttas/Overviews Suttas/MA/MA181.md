# MA181 - 多界 - Many Elements
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Beginning by praising a wise person, the Buddha  goes on to explain that one becomes wise by inquiring into the elements, sense fields, dependent origination, and what is possible and impossible

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When a mendicant is skilled in the elements, in the sense fields, in dependent origination, and in the possible and the impossible.That is qualified to be called ‘astute
When a mendicant knows and sees these elements, they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements, the eighteen elements: the internal, external senses and their consciousness
When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises.When This doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases
Impossible for a person accomplished in view to take any condition as permanent, pleasant, or as self. to murder mother, father, Arahant, injured a Buddha  or cause  a schism in the saṅgha, for 2 Buddha s to arise in the same solar system at the same time, or wheel turning monarch, or woman to be a Buddha  or to perform the role of sakka, Māra, or Brahmā.
> 
> The fool is dangerous, but the astute person is safe. The Fool is perilous, but the astute person is not. The Fool is hazardous, but the astute person is not. There’s No danger, peril, or hazard that comes from the astute
Six elements:the elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness. six elements:the elements of pleasure, pain, happiness, sadness, equanimity, and ignorance, six elements:the elements of sensuality and renunciation, malice and good will, and cruelty and harmlessness, three elements: the elements of the sensual realm, the realm of luminous form, and the formless realm, two elements:the conditioned element and the unconditioned,  
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease, then consciousness ceases, name and form cease, the six sense fields cease, contact ceases, feeling ceases, craving ceases, grasping ceases, continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. That Is how this entire mass of suffering ceases
It is possible for a disagreeable result to come from bad conduct and agreeable result to come from good conduct or that someone who has engaged in bad conduct of body, speech, and mind could, for that reason alone, when their body breaks up, after death, be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, or who has engaged in good conduct when their body breaks up, after death, be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm
