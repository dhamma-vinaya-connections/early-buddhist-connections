# MA89 - 比丘請 - Monk’s Request
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Venerable Moggallāna raises the topic of admonishment, without which healthy community is not possible. He lists a number of qualities that will encourage others to think it worthwhile to admonish you in a constructive way

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Upon checking, a mendicant sees that they haven’t given up all these bad, unskillful qualities, they should make an effort to give them all up, but if they have giving them up, they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities
> 
> Qualities that make one hard to admonish: having mental defilements . . . being uncommunicative, . . . being 
deceitful and flattering, . . . being avaricious and envious, . . . lacking 
shame and lacking scruples, . . . harboring ill-will and malice, . . . becoming 
angry and uttering angry words, . . . admonishing the monk who admon-ishes him, . . . being disdainful of the monk who admonishes him, . . . 
revealing a transgression of the monk who admonishes him, . . . prevaricating by leading the talk astray and refusing to talk, . . . becoming angry and burning with resentment, . . . [associating with] bad friends, . . . lacking gratitude
