# MA115 - 蜜丸喻 - Honey-ball Simile
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A man looking to pick a fight asks the Buddha  to explain his doctrine. The Buddha 's answer mystifies not only the man, but also a number of monks. Ven. Maha kaccana finally provides an explanation, and in the course of doing so explains what is needed to bring the psychological sources of conflict to an end
Challenged by a brahmin, the Buddha  gives an enigmatic response on how conflict arises due to proliferation based on perceptions. Venerable kaccāna draws out the detailed implications of this in one of the most insightful passages in the entire canon

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> My teaching is such that one does not conflict with anyone in this world, and it is such that perceptions do not underlie the brahmin who lives detached from sensual pleasures, without doubting, stripped of worry, and rid of craving for rebirth in this or that state
When there is no eye, no sights, and no eye consciousness, it’s not possible to point out what’s known as ‘contact, nor feelings, nor perceptions nor thinking
> 
> With intention and perception 
he practices not desiring past, future, and present phenomena, not rejoicing 
in them, not becoming attached to them, and not dwelling on them.
This is called the end of the underlying tendencies to desire, repulsion, views, doubt, conceit, the desire to be reborn, and ignorance. This is the end of conflicts
Contact of sense, object & consciousness, feelings arise, then perceptions arise, then thinking arise, that produce differentiation
