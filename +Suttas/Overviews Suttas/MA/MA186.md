# MA186 - 求解 - Investigating
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> While some spiritual teachers prefer to remain in obscurity, the Buddha  not only encouraged his followers to closely investigate him, but gave them a detailed and demanding method to do so

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> One who is an inquirer, unable to comprehend another’s mind, should scrutinize the realized one to see whether he is a fully awakened Buddha  or not
I approached the Buddha  to listen to the teaching. 
He explained Dhamma with its higher and higher stages, with its dark and bright sides. When I directly knew a certain principle of those teachings, in accordance with how I was taught, I had confidence in the teacher
> 
> As to pure states, just so is my purity, just so is my domain, just so 
is the [true] renunciant, just so am I accomplished in this true Dharma 
and discipline. 
If one has such practice and such power, and one’s confidence is deeply 
settled in the Tathāgata, its roots having been established, then this is 
called confidence that is rooted in seeing, indestructible, and united with 
knowledge.
