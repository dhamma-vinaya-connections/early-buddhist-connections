# MA180 - 瞿曇彌 - To Gotamī
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When his step-mother Mahāpajāpatī wishes to offer him a robe for his personal use, the Buddha  encourages her to offer it to the entire Saṅgha instead. He goes on to explain that the best kind of offering to the Saṅgha is one given to the dual community of monks and nuns, headed by the Buddha

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When someone has enabled you to go for refuge, take sila, enabled you to have experiential confidence in the Buddha , the teaching, and the saṅgha,  be free of doubt regarding the 4 noble truths ,
There are these fourteen religious donations to individuals,  religious donations bestowed on a saṅgha, but I say that there is no way a personal offering can be more fruitful than one bestowed on a saṅgha.
When an ethical person with trusting heart 
Gives a proper gift to ethical persons, 
Trusting in the ample fruit of deeds, 
I declare that gift is abundantly fruitful
> 
> It’s not easy to repay them by bowing down to them, rising up for them, greeting them with joined palms or by providing them with robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick
Gifts to the following persons may be expected to yield the following returns. To an animal, a hundred times. To an unethical ordinary person, a thousand. To an ethical ordinary person, a hundred thousand. To an outsider free of sensual desire, 10,000,000,000. But a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of stream-entry may be expected to yield incalculable, immeasurable returns. How much more so a gift to higher beings
There’s a religious donation that’s purified by the giver, not the recipient. There’s A religious donation that’s purified by the recipient, not the giver. There’s A religious donation that’s purified by neither the giver nor the recipient. There’s A religious donation that’s purified by both the giver and the recipient
