# MA30 - 象蹟喻 - Parable of the Elephant’s Footprint
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Sāriputta gives an elaborate demonstration of how, just as any footprint can fit inside an elephant’s, all the Buddha ’s teaching can fit inside the four noble truths. This offers an overall template for organizing the Buddha ’s teachings
An explanation of the four noble truths, focusing on the aggregate of physical form and showing (1) how all the aggregates are interrelated and (2) how all four noble truths, together with the principle of dependent co-arising, are related to the aggregate

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Noble truth of suffering: ebirth, old age, death,  sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering
The interior elements and the exterior elements are just the elements. This Should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘this is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self
This painful feeling born of ear contact has arisen in me. 
That’s dependent, not independent. Dependent On contact. They See that contact, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent.       One who sees dependent origination sees the teaching. 
One who sees the teaching sees dependent origination
While recollecting the Buddha , the teaching, and the saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful does become stabilized in them, they’re happy with that
All skillful qualities can be included in the four noble truths
This body to which I cling, let it be
punched, stoned, and harmed by blade or cudgel, yet I shall ener-getically train in the teaching of the World-honored One
> 
> These five grasping aggregates are indeed dependently originated. The Desire, adherence, attraction, and attachment for these five grasping aggregates is the origin of suffering. Giving Up and getting rid of desire and greed for these five grasping aggregates is the cessation of suffering.
Anything hard, solid, and organic that’s internal earth element; anything that’s water, watery, and organic that’s internal water element; anything that’s fire, fiery, and organic that’s internal; anything that’s wind, windy, and organic that’s internal; when a space is enclosed by bones, sinews, flesh, and skin it becomes known as a ‘form’
When the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body or mind is intact internally and exterior sights come into range and there is corresponding engagement, there is the manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness. The feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness produced in this way are each included in the corresponding grasping aggregate.
If others abuse, attack, harass, and trouble that mendicant, they understand: ‘this painful feeling born of ear contact has arisen in me. That’s Dependent on contact that is impermanence so based on that element alone, their mind becomes eager, confident so gladly now, let fists, stones, sticks, and swords strike this body! For this is how the instructions of the Buddha s are followed.’
My energy shall be roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness established and lucid, my body tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind immersed in samādhi
I will arouse compassion
toward the person who is cutting my body limb from limb. For his sake I shall imbue my mind with loving-kindness
