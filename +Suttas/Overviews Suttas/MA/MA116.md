# MA116 - 瞿曇彌 - Spoken to Gotamī
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Mahāpajāpatī gotamī, the Buddha ’s foster mother, requests ordination from the Buddha . He declines, until urged to relent by Ānanda. He allows mahāpajāpatī to go forth on eight conditions

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Nun should show respect for monks, no vassa in a monastery without monks, receive advice from monks every uposatha, invite admonition from both, committed a grave offense should undergo penance in the communities of both, nun  ordination from monks, ask permission to question a monk, don’t criticize monks
> 
> Female is able to realize the fruits of stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and perfection once she has gone forth
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Many women and few men. They’re easy prey for bandits, rice and sugar canes with plague like spiritual life does not last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going forth.
