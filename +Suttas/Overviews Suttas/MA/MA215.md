> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Even the best things  as king pasenadi decays and perishes, great Brahmā, gods of streaming radiance, meditation on universal consciousness, white dimensions of mastery, practice is the pleasant with swift insight, perceptions of nothingnes,  best of the convictions of outsiders, directly know dimension of neither perception nor non-perception
> 
> Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with it. Their Desire fades away even for the foremost, let alone the inferior.So The Buddha  advocate complete extinguishment by not grasping after truly understanding the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of the six fields of contact. in this very life, wishless, extinguished, and cooled.”
