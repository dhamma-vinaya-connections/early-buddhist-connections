# MA216 - 愛生 - What Arises from Affection
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A rare glimpse into the marital life of king pasenadi, and how he is led to the Dhamma by his queen, the incomparable mallikā. She confirms the Buddha ’s teaching that our loved ones bring us sorrow; but that’s not something a husband, father, and king wants to hear.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
> 
> if someone dear to us were to decay and perish, then sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress will arise in you
