# MA193 - 牛犁破群那 - Moliya Phagguṇa
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  tells the story of a wise slave who deliberately tests her mistress's patience. The Buddha  invokes several memorable similes here to illustrate the correct way to develop patience.
A discourse full of vibrant and memorable similes, on the importance of patience and love even when faced with abuse and criticism. The Buddha  finishes with the simile of the saw, one of the most memorable similes found in the discourses

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Give up what’s unskillful and devote yourselves to skillful qualities so you’ll achieve growth, improvement, and maturity in this teaching and training
There are five ways of speaking82 Another person’s speech may 
be timely or untimely, truthful or untruthful, gentle or harsh, kindly or 
angry, meaningful or trivial
Develop love, compassion & equanimity when being criticized, even if someone strikes you with fists or weapons or even if bandits were to sever you limb from limb
> 
> This venerable one is 
patient, humble, mild, and tolerant. He is well-disciplined, well-settled, 
and at peace
When someone speaks in any of these five ways, if your mind changes 
or your mouth says something bad, then I say that because of that you are 
definitely in decline
You should train so that if thieves were to come by and cut you apart,  section by section, with a sharp saw, your mind would not change, you would not utter bad speech to those who were cutting you up and, based 
on that, you should generate a mental attitude of loving-kindness and  compassion
