# MA5 - 木積喻 - Parable of the Heap of Wood
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> It would be better for a monk to embrace a blazing fire than to lie with a maiden

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A bhikkhu sit or lie down embracing that bonfire than a girl- strong man twist a tough horse-hair rope around both shins - people bow down to you, get stab in chest - get venerated, being wrap you up in a red-hot sheet of iron - use ropes, force your mouth open with a hot iron spike - ear alms food,   lie down on red-hot iron bed - bed donated, shove you in a red-hot copper pot - use donated dwellings
> 
> So you should train like this: ‘our use of robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick shall be of great fruit and benefit for those who offered them. And our going forth will not be wasted, but will be fruitful and fertile
>

> Burning similes of abusing donations by fake bhikkhus
