# MA185 - 牛角婆羅林 - Discourse in the Gosiṅga Sāla Forest 2
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  comes across three mendicants practicing diligently and harmoniously, and asks them how they do it. Reluctant to disclose their higher attainments, they explain how they deal with the practical affairs of living together. But when pressed by the Buddha , they reveal their meditation attainments.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Whoever is living in harmony, diligently, keen, and resolute is practicing for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, because anyone who  recollect those venerables with confident heart, that would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.
Superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease
> 
> consistently treat each other with kindness by way of body, speech, and mind, both in public and in private, they put away the seats, drinking water, and rubbish bin, and sweep the refectory. 
If someone sees that the pot of water for washing, drinking, or the toilet is empty they set it up, don't talk except every five days to discuss the teachings.
4 jhanas, 4 divine abodes, 4 formless liberations  and 6 higher knowleges
