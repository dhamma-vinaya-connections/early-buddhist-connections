# MA183 - 馬邑 - Discourse at Assapura 2
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The labels of being a spiritual practitioner don’t just come from external trappings, but from sincere inner change.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Having in this way accomplished morality and bodily, verbal, and men_x0002_tal purity, one [cultivates] a mind that is free of covetousness, free of ill 
will, free of sloth-and-torpor, free of restlessness-and-worry, and eradicating 
doubt and going beyond perplexity, with right mindfulness and right com_x0002_prehension, without bewilderment
Atrue  renunciant, brahmin, noble one, purified one
> 
> The proper way of practice is to give up covetousness, ill will, irritability, hostility, offensiveness, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deviousness, deceit, bad desires, and wrong view, and spread the heart full of love, compassion, rejoice and equanimity
It is one who has allayed all evil and unwhole_x0002_some states, all taints and pollutants, which are the root of future becoming, 
have vexation and suffering as their result, and are the cause of birth, old 
age, disease, and death.

> Ax extremely sharp, which is wrapped up in a monk’s robe like one that pretends to be a renunciant but full of defilements 
A thirsty person coming to a pond with clear, cool water, like an ascetic arrived at the teaching and training proclaimed by the Buddha
