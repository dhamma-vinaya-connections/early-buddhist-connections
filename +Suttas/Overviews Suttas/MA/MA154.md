# MA154 - 婆羅婆堂 - To Vāseṭṭha at the  Hall [of Migāra’s Mother
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> In contrast with the brahmin’s self-serving mythologies of the past, the Buddha  presents an account of evolution that shows how human choices are an integral part of the ecological balance, and how excessive greed destroys the order of nature

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Purification through ethical conduct not because of castes
Appearance of bad, unskillful things in the world and their consequences
How the different indian social classes came to be
> 
> Refrain from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct. Refrain from speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, and nonsensical. Be content, kind-hearted, with right view. 
Because of enjoying taste, craving was born in beings, then vanity arouse, then  genders, lust and sex, then storing up food, then divisions and stealing, then 4 castes were  created
How good and bad conduct brings pleasure or pain independent on the caste
