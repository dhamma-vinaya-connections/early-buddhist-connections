# MA169 - 拘樓瘦無諍 - Kurus on Nonconflict
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Achieving peace is no simple matter. The Buddha  explains how to avoid conflict through contentment, right speech, understanding pleasure, and not insisting on local conventions

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Don’t indulge in sensual pleasures, which are low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless
We shall know the principles beset by conflict and the principles free of conflict. Knowing This, we will practice the way free of conflict
Saying untrue, false, and harmful things in someone’s presence is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way
> 
> Know how to assess different kinds of pleasure. Knowing This, pursue inner blissfrom jhanas
Avoiding these two extremes, sensual pleasures and self mortification understanding the middle way, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment. 
Don’t talk behind people’s backs, and don’t speak sharply in their presence. Don’t Speak hurriedly. Don’t Insist on local terminology and don’t override normal usage
