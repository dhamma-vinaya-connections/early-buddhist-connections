# MA162 - 分別六界 - Analysis of the 6 Elements
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A poignant story in which a wanderer, searching for the Buddha , meets the Buddha  without realizing it. He recognizes his mistake only after the Buddha  teaches him a profound discourse on four determinations and the six properties of experience. An excellent illustration of the Buddha 's statement, "whoever sees the Dhamma sees me
While staying overnight in a potter’s workshop, the Buddha  has a chance encounter with a monk who does not recognize him. They have a long and profound discussion based on the four elements. This is one of the most insightful and moving discourses in the canon

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A person has six properties, six media of sensory contact, eighteen considerations, & four determinations. He has been stilled where the currents of construing do not flow. And when the currents of construing do not flow, he is said to be a sage at peace. 
 There are six considerations conducive to joy, six conducive to distress, & six conducive to equanimity. 'a person has eighteen considerations
When you truly see with right understanding, you reject the earth, water, fire, air, space and consciousness  element, detaching the mind from the element.
In dependence on a sensory contact that is to be felt as pleasure, pain or neutral  there arises a feeling of pleasure. With the cessation of that very sensory contact ceases, is stilled
One neither fabricates nor mentally fashions for the sake of becoming or un-becoming. This being the case, one is not sustained by anything in the world (does not cling to anything in the world). Unsustained, one is not agitated. Unagitated, one is totally unbound right within
His release, being founded on truth, does not fluctuate, for whatever is deceptive is false; unbinding — the undeceptive — is true.
> 
> One should not be negligent of discernment, should guard the truth, be devoted to relinquishment, and train only for calm
Seeing a sight with the eye, one is preoccupied with a sight that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.Hearing A sound with the ear … smelling an odor with the nose … tasting a flavor with the tongue …

Feeling a touch with the body … becoming conscious of a thought with the mind


The interior and exterior  earth, water, fire, air, space and consciousness element and the exterior earth element are just  element. This Should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘this is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self
Eighteen considerations: on seeing a form with the eye, one considers a form that can act as a basis for joy, a form that can act as a basis for distress, or a form that can act as a basis for equanimity. On hearing a sound with the ear... On smelling an aroma with the nose... On tasting a flavor with the tongue... On feeling a tactile sensation with the body... On cognizing an idea with the intellect
If I were to direct equanimity as pure & bright as this towards the dimension of the infinitude of space, consciousness, nothing neither perceptions nor not perceptions that would be fabricated.
If they feel a pleasant, painful, neutral  feeling, they understand that it’s impermanen,  so they feel if detach. endowed with the highest determination for discernment, for this — the knowledge of the passing away of all suffering & stress — is the highest noble discernment.

> Fire sticks, heat is born and fire appears, like dependence on a sensory contact feelings arise
Goldsmith refining gold, like consciousness purification
Oil lamp burns in dependence on oil & wick; and from the termination fire extinguishers like after the termination of life, all that is sensed, not being relished, will grow cold right here.
