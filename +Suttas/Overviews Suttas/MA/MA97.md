# MA97 - 大因 - Great Discourse on Causation
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Rejecting venerable Ānanda’s claim to easily understand dependent origination, the Buddha  presents a complex and demanding analysis, revealing hidden nuances and implications of this central teaching
One of the most profound discourses in the pali canon, which gives an extended treatment of the teachings of dependent co-arising (paticca samuppada) and not-self (anatta) in an outlined context of how these teachings function in practice.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Detailed explanation of how dependence between the traditional factors and unskillful things
Describing & not describing the self
Feeling is my self, or  ‘feeling is definitely not my self. My self does not experience feeling, or feeling is definitely not my self. But it’s not that my self does not experience feeling. My self feels, for my self is liable to feel. Not regarding anything in this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world they personally become extinguished
8 liberations and 7 planes of consciousness & 2 dimensions
Liberation in both ways
> 
> Conditioned by craving there is seeking, then is gain, discrimination, defilement by desire, attachment,  miserliness, storing up, protecting [one’s possessions, then there is the [taking up of] sword and club, there is quarreling, flattery, deceit, falsehood, divisive speech, 
and the arising of countless evil and unwholesome states
Describe it as physical and limited,
Physical and infinite, formless and limited, formless and infinite: ‘my self is formless and infinite.
Does not [hold] the view that 
feeling is the self, or the view that the self is able to feel, it being the nature 
of the self to be able to feel, or the view that the self is without feeling. 
Not holding such views, he does not cling to [anything] in this world; not 
clinging, he is not agitated; not being agitated, he [attains] nirvana, knowing 
as it really is: “Birth has been ended for me
Having physical form, they see visions, not perceiving form internally, they see visions externally, they’re focused only on beauty, aware that ‘space is infinite,  consciousness is infinite, there is nothing at all, enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling
Enters into and withdraws from these eight liberations—in forward order, in reverse order, and in forward and reverse order—wherever they wish, whenever they wish, and for as long as they wish
