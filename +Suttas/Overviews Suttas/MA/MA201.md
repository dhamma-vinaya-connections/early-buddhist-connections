# MA201 - 嗏帝 - To Sāti
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> To counter the wrong view that a self-identical consciousness transmigrates from one life to the next, the Buddha  teaches dependent origination, showing that consciousness invariably arises dependent on conditions.
A long discourse in which the Buddha  discusses how to understand the role of consciousness — as a process — in the process of birth in a way that actually can lead to the end of birth

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Wrong view: consciousness is he who speaks and feels and experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realms, that roams and transmigrates,
When these three things come together—the mother and father come together, the mother is in the fertile part of her menstrual cycle, and the spirit being reborn is present—an embryo is conceived.
When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. that is the 12 links chain
When they perceive something from the senses if it’s pleasant they don’t desire it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart. And They truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over
He knows that pure and bright as this view is for crossing over, not for holding on, so he doesn't treasure it, nor treat it as his own,
> 
> Right views, consciousness is reckoned according to the specific conditions dependent upon which of the 6 senses it arises
4 fuels of life: solid food, whether coarse or fine; contact is the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth, and their source is craving
When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. that is the 12 links chain
Having given up favoring and opposing, when they experience any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—they don’t approve, welcome, or keep clinging to it. As A result, relishing of feelings ceases. When Their relishing ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. That Is how this entire mass of suffering cease
Free of doubt about dependent origination, when truly sees with right understanding that this has come to be,  this has originated with that as fuel, that when that fuel ceases, what has come to be is liable to cease. free of doubt of present, past and future of ‘am I exist ? Am I not exist? What am I? How am I? This sentient being—where did it come from? And where will it go?,Don't acknowledge another teacher, don't believe that the observances and, superstitious rites are important things
