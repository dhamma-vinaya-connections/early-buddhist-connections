# MA112 - 阿奴波 - Spoken at Anupiya
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A monk asks whether, when the Buddha  said that Devadatta was going to hell, he was speaking metaphorically. The Buddha  castigates him, wondering how anyone could misunderstand such a straightforward statement, and explains how he reads the minds of others and understands where their deeds will lead them

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The first three people have more unskillful qualities one may improve, one is liable to decline, and one is bound for a place of loss, hell.
> 
> Of the second three with more skillful qualities, one is liable to decline, one is not liable to decline, and one is bound to become extinguished
