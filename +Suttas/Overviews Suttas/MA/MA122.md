# MA122 - 瞻波 - At Campa
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha spot a corrupt monk so doesn't recite the rules. The Buddha  tells the other monks to expel him, explaining that when such a monk lives hidden in the saṅgha, his corruption can spread to the other monks.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Irritable, with wicked desires, 
Offensive, stubborn, and contemptuous, 
Jealous, stingy, and devious
> 
> But they act in secret, with their bad views 
And their lack of regard for others, then having gathered in harmony, 
You should expel them
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Bad bhikkhus to avoid association similes
