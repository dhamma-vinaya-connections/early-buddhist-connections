# MA161 - 梵摩 - With Brahmāyu
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The oldest and most respected brahmin of the age sends a student to examine the Buddha , and he spends several months following his every move before reporting back. Convinced that the Buddha  fulfills an ancient prophecy of the great man, the brahmin becomes his disciple

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> His voice has eight qualities: it is clear, comprehensible, charming, audible, rounded, undistorted, deep, and resonant. He Makes sure his voice is intelligible as far as the assembly goes
Description of the 32 marks of a great man
How do you become a perfected one? 
And how a consummate one? 
How do you become a sage? 
And how is one declared to be awakened?
> 
> Have seen master gotama walking and standing; entering inhabited areas, and sitting and eating there; sitting silently after eating, and expressing appreciation; going to the monastery, sitting silently there, and teaching Dhamma to an assembly there.
Who has these 32 marks will become a wheel turning monarch or a Buddha
Then the Buddha  taught him step by step, with a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He Explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation. And When the Buddha  knew that brahmāyu’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, joyful, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddha s:suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path
