# MA165 - 溫泉林天 - Deva at the Hot Spring Grove
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The verses about being present (MA 165) are explained in 6 senses context  by venerable Mahakaccāna

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Don’t run back to the past,  don’t hope for the future. 
What’s past is left behind; 
The future has not arrived;
Phenomena in the present 
Are what one should contemplate,
Mindful of lack of stability. 
The wise awaken in this way. 
Undertaking [such] practice of noble ones, 
Who need worry about death? 
“I shall disengage from that, 
[This] great suffering and misery shall end
> 
> Consciousness doesn’t get tied up there with desire and lust, thinking: ‘in the past or future I had/ will such eyes and such sights, such ears and such sounds … such a nose and such smells … such a tongue and such tastes … such a body and such touches … such a mind and such thoughts’ so you don’t take pleasure in that

> Someone looking for heartwood, pass the heartwood and took the branches like bhikkhus not asking to the Buddha the meaning
