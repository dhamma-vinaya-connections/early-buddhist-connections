# MA15 - 思 - Intention
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  asserts that one’s kamma must be exhausted before making an end of suffering. If one develops the heart’s release through love, no bad deeds can persist there
The Buddha  asserts that one’s kamma must be exhausted before making an end of suffering. This statement precedes a long explanation of deeds and their causes

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Meditate spreading a heart full of love, compassion, rejoice and equanimity
Killing living, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, harsh, divisive and non sense speech, covetousness, ill will and wrong views
> 
> Whatever bad deeds I have done in the past with this deed-born body I will experience here. It will not follow me to my next life.’ The heart’s release by love developed in this way leads to non-return
I don’t say that suffering is ended without experiencing intentional deeds that have been performed and accumulated.
