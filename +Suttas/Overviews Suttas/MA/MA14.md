# MA14 - 羅云 - Rāhula
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Using the “object lesson” of a cup of water, the Buddha  explains to his son, rāhula, the importance of telling the truth and reflecting on one’s motives
The Buddha  admonishes his son, the novice rahula, on the dangers of lying and stresses the importance of constant reflection on one's motives.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> That’s how vacant and hollow the ascetic’s nature is in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie, even for a joke
Before, during and after acting with the body, speech and mind, you should check on that same act: ‘does this act with the body that I am doing lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both? Is It unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result
> 
> When someone is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie, there is no bad deed they would not do, I say. So You should train like this: ‘I will not tell a lie, even for a joke
If it is bad  the best of your ability, you should not do such a deed, desist or afterward you should confess, reveal, to a sensible spiritual companion for body and speech deeds and for mental deeds you should be horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that deed then you should restrain yourself in future. but if it is good you should live in rapture and joy because of this
