# MA96 - 無 - Absence
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Sāriputta explains what the Buddha  meant by a mendicant who is in decline

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> a person liable to decline doesn’t get to hear new teachings, forget those they heard, don't rehearse  what they’ve already got to know. And they don’t come to understand what they haven’t understood before
> 
> While contemplating, knows, “I am often given 
to covetousness, . . . hatred, . . . sloth-and-torpor, . . . restlessness and arro-gance, . . . doubt, . . . disputatiousness, . . . a defiled and stained mind, . . . 
lack of faith, . . . indolence, . . . lack of mindfulness, . . . lack of concen-tration, . . . faulty wisdom.”
