# MA118 - 龍象 - Elephant
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When going for a bath, the Buddha  encounters a giant royal elephant. But a spiritual giant is even more impressive.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> One who does nothing monstrous by way of body, speech, and mind and free of greed, free of hate, 
Free of delusion
> 
> He has gone beyond all fetters, 
he has left the jungle behind 
Having discarded sensual pleasures, he delights in dispassion, 
Like true gold extracted from ore
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Elephant naga, like qualities of the Buddha
