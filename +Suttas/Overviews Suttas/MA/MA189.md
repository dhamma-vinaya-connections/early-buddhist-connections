# MA189 - 勝道 - Noble Path
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A discourse on the prerequisites of right samādhi that emphasizes the interrelationship and mutual support of all the factors of the eightfold path
On the nature of noble right concentration, and its interdependence with all the factors of the noble eightfold path

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Right view, right effort, and right mindfulness, keep running and circling around the other factors
Right view comes first, by understanding right factors from the wrong factors
> 
> Right view gives rise to right thought, gives rise to right speech, gives rise to right action gives rise to right livelihood, gives rise to right effort, gives rise to right mindfulness, gives rise to right immersion, gives rise to right knowledge gives rise to right freedom
For one of right view, wrong view is worn away with many bad, unskillful qualities that arise because of wrong view, and because of right view, many skillful qualities are fully developed
