# MA83 - 長老上尊睡眠 - Drowsiness of a Highly Regarded Elder
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Before his awakening, Moggallāna is struggling with sleepiness in meditation. The Buddha  visits him and gives seven ways to dispel drowsiness, and other important teachings

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Shake off your drowsiness by don't attend to that perception when drowsy, think about and teach the teaching, recite in detail the teaching, pinch your ears and rub your limbs, flush your eyes with water, look around,  or walk meditation; finally lie down
> 
> Having contemplated feelings as imper-manent, their rise and fall, their eradication, their fading away, their cessation, and their abandonment, he does not cling to this world, he is not wearied; he attains final nirvana and he knows as it really is: “Birth has been ended
