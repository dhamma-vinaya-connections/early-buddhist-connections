# MA93 - 水淨梵志 - Brahmin [Practitioner of] 
Purification by Bathing
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> With a simple simile the Buddha  illustrates the difference between a defiled mind and a pure mind
The many different kinds of impurities that defile the mind are compared to a dirty cloth. When the mind is clean we find joy, which leads to states of higher consciousness. Finally, the Buddha  rejects the brahmanical notion that purity comes from bathing in sacred rivers

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When they have understood these corruptions of the mind for what they are, and have given them up, they have experiential confidence in the Buddha ,the Dhamma and the Sangha
For the pure in heart it’s always 
The spring festival or the sabbath. 
For the pure in heart and clean of deed, 
Their vows will always be fulfilled. 
It’s here alone that you should bathe, brahmin, 
Making yourself a sanctuary for all creatures
> 
> Corruptions of the mind
Covetousness and immoral greed, ill will, anger, hostility, offensiveness, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deceit, deviousness, obstinacy, aggression, conceit, arrogance, vanity, and negligence
They meditate spreading a heart full of love, compassion, rejoice and equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love, compassion, rejoice and equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will
