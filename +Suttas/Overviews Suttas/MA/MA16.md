> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A mind that’s free of enmity and ill will, uncorrupted and purified by meditation in love, compassion, rejoice and equanimity
Greed, hate, and delusion their mind is never satisfied, they lead to harm & to suffering
> 
> Acquires four assurances: if future life I will go to a good one, if no future life I am
praised for having right attentiveness, as one who is diligent; Since I have done no evil, whence could suffering
arise? and My mind has been free of contention with beings, untainted, and delighted
Learned noble disciple achieves purity
of bodily, verbal and mental actions. He abandons ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness
 conceit, and doubt; he transcends arrogance, has right mind-fulness and right attentiveness, and is without confusion
