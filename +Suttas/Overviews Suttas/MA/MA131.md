# MA131 - 降魔 - Overcoming Māra
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Māra, the trickster and god of death, tried to annoy Moggallāna. He not only failed but was subject to a stern sermon warning of the dangers of attacking the Buddha ’s disciples

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When being abused, attacked, harassed, and troubled, meditate spreading a heart full of love, compassion, rejoicing and full of equanimity
Dark one, if you attack 
A bhikkhu who directly knows this, 
A disciple of the Buddha , 
You’ll fall into suffering.
> 
> When being  honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, meditate observing the ugliness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness of food, perceiving dissatisfaction with the whole world, and observing the impermanence of all conditions
I’m the one who, shook the stilt longhouse of migāra’s mother and the palace of victory, with his big toe, to whom Brahmā truthfully admitted his progress and the one who has touched the peak of mount meru 
Using the power of meditative liberation
