# MA23 - 智 - Wisdom
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A mendicant named kaḷāra the khattiya informs Sāriputta that the mendicant moḷiyaphagguna had disrobed. Overinterpreting Sāriputta’s reply, kaḷāra reports to the Buddha  that Sāriputta had claimed to have ended all defilements. The Buddha  calls Sāriputta to clarify his statements, and Sāriputta explains in terms of dependent origination

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> With the destruction of the source from which birth, death, existence, clinging, craving,  feelings originates, I have understood: “when [the cause] is destroyed, [the effect] is destroyed.
> 
> These three feelings, friends, are impermanent; whatever is impermanent is suffering. When this was understood, delight in feelings no longer remained present in me.
