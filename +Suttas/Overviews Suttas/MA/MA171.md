# MA171 - 分別大業 - Great Analysis of Karma
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Confronted with an overly simplistic version of his own teachings, the Buddha  emphasizes the often overlooked nuances and qualifications in how karma plays out.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> After doing an intentional deed to be experienced as painful by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels pain
It seems that there is such a thing as bad deeds, and the result of bad conduct, as well as good conduct, and good results, or they say  they say: ‘I have seen a person reborn I hell or heaven  I grant them that
There are deeds that are ineffective and appear ineffective. There are deeds that are ineffective but appear effective. There are deeds that are effective and appear effective. And there are deeds that are effective but appear ineffective
> 
> Person here kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, and have wrong view. 
But when they say: ‘it seems that everyone who refrains from killing living creatures … and has right view is reborn in hell,’ I don’t grant them that or the opposite in heaven,  or there is not results of bad deeds
They must have done a good deed to be experienced as pleasant either previously or later, or else at the time of death they undertook right view, or they experiences the result of that in the present life, or in the next life, or in some subsequent period.
