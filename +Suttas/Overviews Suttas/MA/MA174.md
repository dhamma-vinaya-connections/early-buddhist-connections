# MA174 - 受法 - Ways of Practice (1)
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  explains how taking up different practices may have harmful or beneficial results. The memorable simile of the creeper shows how insidious temptations can be

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Pleasant now with future pain: renunciantes throw themselves into sensual pleasures, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, for it is because of sensual pleasures that they will feel pain
Painful now but results in future pleasure:  when someone is ordinarily full of acute greed, hate, and delusion. They often feel the pain and sadness that greed, hate, and delusion bring. 
They lead the full and pure spiritual life in pain and sadness, weeping, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place
> 
> Painful now and results in future pain: mortification of the body,  after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss
Pleasant now with future pleasure: is when someone is not ordinarily full of acute greed, hate, and delusion. They rarely feel the pain and sadness that greed, hate, and delusion bring, they enjoy the  jhanas, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place
