# MA211 - 大拘絺羅 - Mahākoṭṭhita
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A series of questions and answers between Sāriputta and mahākoṭṭhita, examining various subtle and abstruse aspects of the teachings
Ven. Sariputta answers questions dealing with discernment, right view, and the higher meditative attainments

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Bad bodily conduct, [bad] verbal [conduct], bad mental conduct—these 
are unwholesome. Desire, aversion, and delusion—these are the roots of 
unwholesomeness
Wisdom an consciousnes are mixed, not separate.  What one knows with wisdom, of that 
one is conscious by consciousness.
One: hearing from another; and two: giving reasoned attention 
within oneself. These are the two causes
Three [types of] feeling: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and 
neutral feeling. Because of what do they exist? They exist because of 
contact.
The vitality of a dead person has completely ceased, his heat has dissi_x0002_pated, and his faculties have broken down. The vitality of a monk who 
has entered the concentration of cessation has not completely ceased, his 
heat has not dissipated, and his faculties have not broken down.
First absorption has five factors. When A bhikkhu  has entered the first absorption, placing the mind, keeping it connected, rapture, bliss, and unification of mind are present
This body must lose three things before it lies forsaken, tossed aside like an insentient log: vitality, warmth, and consciousness
Unshakable heart’s release is empty of greed, hate, and delusion.
> 
> Good bodily conduct, [good] verbal [conduct], good mental conduct—these 
are wholesome. Absence of desire, absence of aversion, and absence of 
delusion—these are the roots of wholesomeness
As regards knowing, I know through wisdom.”  Wisdom has the purpose of disenchantment, the purpose of dispassion, the purpose of seeing as it really is
One: assisted by truth, two: assisted by virtue, three: assisted by wide learning, four: assisted by tranquility, and five: assisted 
by insight. These are the five factors, assisted by which right view leads 
to the fruit of liberation of the mind
What one feels with feeling, that one perceives with perception and intends with intention. Therefore these three states are conjoined and not 
separate. 
When a monk attains the concen_x0002_tration of cessation, bodily activity ceases first, next verbal activity ceases, 
and finally mental activity ceases.
First absorption has given up five factors sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt are given up.
Life depends on warmth to continue, and warmth depends on life to continue
Limitless heart’s release, and the heart’s release through nothingness, and the heart’s release through emptiness, and the signless heart’s release
