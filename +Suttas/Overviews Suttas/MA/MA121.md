# MA121 - 請請 - Invitation Ceremony 
(Pavāraṇā
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> On the pavāraṇā day at the end of the rains retreat, the Buddha  invites the saṅgha to admonish him. But not only is the Buddha  faultless, so are all the 500 monks present. Vaṅgīsa is inspired to utter a elaborate praise of the Buddha

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Today, on the fifteenth, the day of invitation, 
An assembly of five hundred monks is seated together. 
Having gotten rid of all fetters, 
They are without obstructions, seers for whom [repeated] existence is ended.
> 
> Brave as lions, 
[They] have removed all fear. 
They have crossed over birth and death, 
With all taints completely eradicated.
