In deliciously graphic terms, the Buddha  describes the allures and drawbacks of sensuality, physical form, and feeling. What better incentive could there be to escape samsara once and for all?

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> For sensuality: gratification of 5 kinds of sensual pleasures; drawbacks unpleasant things, hard work is wasted, what used to be mine is gone, fighting, war, bad conduct of body, speech, and mind with bad consequences in this life and after death. escape removing and giving up desire and greed for sensuality
