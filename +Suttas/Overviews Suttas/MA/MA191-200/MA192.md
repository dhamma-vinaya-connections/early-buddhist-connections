# MA192 - 家樓烏陀夷 - Kāḷudāyin
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  recommends giving up any fetter, large or small and explains how fetters are strong, not because of their own tensile strength, but because of the tenacity of our unwillingness to let them go
Raising the rule regarding eating, but this time as a reflection of gratitude for the Buddha  in eliminating things that cause complexity and stress. The Buddha  emphasizes how attachment even to little things can be dangerous.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When told by the Buddha   to give something up, foolish people don’t give it up, and they nurse bitterness that becomes a strong tie, but others give it up living unruffled with weak bonds
Pleasure from five kinds of sensual stimulation is ordinary and should not be cultivated but should be feared
> 
> Fettered persons practicing to give up of attachments that: 1 tolerate memories, 2 don’t tolerate them, 3 every so often they lose mindfulness and slowly recover it and abandon memories, and unfettered persons  understanding that attachment is the root of suffering
Pleasure of 8 jhanas  should be cultivated and developed, and should not be feared, and go beyond into the cessation of perception and feeling
> 

> [!info] Similes
