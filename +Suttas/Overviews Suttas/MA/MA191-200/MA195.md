# MA195 - 阿濕貝 - To Assaji
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A third discourse that presents the health benefits of eating in one part of the day, and the reluctance of some mendicants to follow this.
A discourse on the importance of conviction in the buddhist path. Not only is conviction a prerequisite for listening to the Buddha 's teachings with respect, but — as is shown by the unusual discussion here categorizing the types of noble disciples — it can underlie the practice all the way to the deathless.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Give up pleasurable, painful feelings that  unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline, 
 freed both ways, one freed by wisdom don’t have work to do with diligence if they are perfected, with defilements ended
I do not say that all monks attain final knowledge, and I also do not 
say that all monks attain final knowledge at the outset; rather, gradual 
practice and training gives rise to the results.
> 
> Cultivate when in pleasurable, painful, feeling that unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow
A personal witness, one attained to view, one freed by faith, a follower of the teachings, and a follower by faith, still have work to do with diligence if they are trainees, who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary
Someone in whom faith has arisen approaches a teacher. They pay homage, lend an ear, hear the teachings, remember the teachings, reflect on their meaning, and accept them after consideration. Then enthusiasm springs up; they make an effort, weigh up, and persevere. Persevering, they directly realize the ultimate truth, and see it with penetrating wisdom
