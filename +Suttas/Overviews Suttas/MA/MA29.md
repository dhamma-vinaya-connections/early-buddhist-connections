# MA29 - 大拘絺羅 - Koṭṭhita
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Venerables Mahākoṭṭhita and Sāriputta discuss conditions for acquiring right view and arrive at true Dhamma

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Skillful & unskillful qualities and their roots
Different ways to describe a noble disciple who has right view, experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching
4 noble truths applied to fuel
4 noble truths applied to taints
4 noble truths applied to each factor of dependent origination
> 
> Skillful is ethics, contentment, good will, and right view; their roots are contentment, love, and wisdom. unskillful is the opposite and their roots are greed, hate, and delusion.
They’ve completely given up the underlying tendency to greed, to repulsion, and eradicated the conceit ‘I am’. They’ve given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, and make an end of suffering in this very life
4 fuels solid food, contact, mental intention and consciousness
Taints of sensual desires, process of existence, ignorance; origin and cessation of ignorance 
Defilements – ignorance - choices- conciousness- mind-body - 6 senses - contact - feelings - craving - grasping - continued existence - rebirth - old age and death - suffering
