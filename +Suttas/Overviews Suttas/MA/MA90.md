# MA90 - 知法 - Knowledge of the Dharma
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Anyone who claims to know the dhamma, and yet still has a mind overcome by defilement, is like a person who talks about wealth but can produce none when it's needed

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Covetousness, disputatiousness, . . . anger, . . . ill-will, . . . uncommu-nicativeness, . . . avarice, . . . envy, . . . deceit, . . . flattery, . . . lack of 
shame and scruples, . . . <evil> desires and evil views
> 
> His companions in the holy life will know that venerable one as a person who [really] knows all the teachings and what can be known about the teach-ing, and who is free from those defilements
> 

> [!info] Similes
