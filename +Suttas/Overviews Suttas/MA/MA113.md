# MA113 - 諸法本 - Root of all Phenomena
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The root of all things, and similar principles
Reflections that strengthen the mind of a renunciate.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> All things are rooted in desire. Attention produces them. Contact is their origin. Feeling is their meeting place. Immersion is their chief. Mindfulness is their ruler. Wisdom is their overseer. Freedom is their core. They culminate in the deathless. And extinguishment is their final end
Practice the perception of 
impermanence,  of dukkha, not-self, of impurity, of the repulsiveness of food, of not delighting in the entire world, and of death
> 
> Knowing likes and dislikes in regard to the world, he is able to practice perceiving them like this in the mind
If, knowing as it really is, the world’s arising, its ceasing, its attraction, its peril, and the escape from it, then such a monk is said to have abandoned craving and 
removed the fetters.
