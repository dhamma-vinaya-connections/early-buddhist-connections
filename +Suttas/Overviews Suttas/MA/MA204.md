# MA204 - 羅摩 - At Rammaka’s [Hermitage]
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The famous first discourse, taught at varanasi to the group of five ascetics. It begins by rejecting the extremes of asceticism and indulgence and recommends the middle way of the eightfold path. Then it defines the four noble truths and analyzes them in twelve aspects.
This is one of the most important biographical discourses, telling the Buddha ’s experiences from leaving home to realizing awakening. Throughout, he was driven by the imperative to fully escape from rebirth and suffering
Most of us spend a good part of our lives looking for happiness in all the wrong places. In this sutta the Buddha  recounts the story of his own search and points out where a true and lasting happiness can be found

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Noble truth of suffering is to be, and know when is being  fully understood that is 5 aggregates and 6 senses; noble truth of the origin of suffering is to be and has been  abandoned that is craving for existence and sensuality
Ignoble search is when someone who is themselves liable to be reborn seeks what is also liable to be reborn, to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, they seek what is also liable to these things. And noble search is understanding the drawbacks in these things, they seek the unaging, unailing, undying, sorrowless, uncorrupted supreme sanctuary, nibbana
I approached āḷāra kālāma and uddaka, son of rāma. I quickly memorized those teaching and with faith, energy, mindfulness, samadhi , and wisdom and  I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the 9 jhanas
> 
> Noble truth of the cessation of suffering is to be and has been realized, the completecessationof that craving; noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering is to be, and has been developed the noble 8 path
Partners and children, male and female bondservants,  cattle, and gold and money are liable to corruption. These Attachments are liable to corruption. Someone Who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things themselves liable to corruption
This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment
Ascetics and brahmins who enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation tied, infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, and not understanding the escape. You should understand that they have met with calamity and disaster, and are vulnerable to the wicked one
