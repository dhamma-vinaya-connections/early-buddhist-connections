## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary

The Buddha ’s chief disciples, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, use a simile of a tarnished bowl to illustrate the blemishes of the mind and conduct. They emphasize how the crucial thing is not so much whether there are blemishes, but whether we are aware of them

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Blemish’ is a term for the spheres of bad, unskillful wishes and when their wishes are not fulfill anger and that bitterness are both blemishes.
Who doesn’t have a blemish and does understand it. You can expect that they won’t focus on the feature of beauty, and because of that, lust won’t infect their mind. 
Who doesn’t have a blemish and doesn't understand it won't make effort to guard his mind.
> 
> Person who has a blemish and does not understand it. You can expect that they won’t make an effort to give up that blemish. 
Person who has a blemish and does understand it will make an effort to get rid of them.
Are those who are 
flattering, deceitful, envious, lack faith, are negligent, lack right mindfulness 
and right comprehension, lack concentration, lack wisdom, are conceited, 
deluded, do not guard the sense faculties, do not train in seclusion, and lack discernment
