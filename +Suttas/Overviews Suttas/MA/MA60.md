# MA60 - 四洲 - Four Continents
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Story of a wheel turning monarch that fulfill all his wishes but not got quenched

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Very few people in the world are able to fulfill their intentions in regard
to sensual pleasures, and only few become disenchanted with sensual
pleasures by the time they die
> 
> [Even if it] rains wonderful treasures, 
One who has desire will not be satisfied. 
Desire is suffering, devoid of pleasure— 
This the wise should know.
