# MA145 - 瞿默目揵連 - To Gaṇaka 
Moggallāna
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Amid rising military tensions after the Buddha ’s death, venerable Ānanda is questioned about how the saṅgha planned to continue in their teacher’s absence. As the Buddha  refused to appoint a successor, the teaching and practice that he laid down become the teacher, and the saṅgha resolves issues by consensus
Ven. Ananda explains how the Sangha maintains its unity and internal discipline after the passing away of the Buddha  [bb]. Interestingly, this sutta also shows that early buddhist practice had no room for many practices that developed in later buddhist traditions, such as appointed lineage holders, elected ecclesiastical heads, or the use of mental defilements as a basis for concentration practice

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Who serves as your refuge after the Buddha  passed away? The teaching is our refuge, it’s not the venerables that make us act, it’s the teaching that makes us act.
There are ten inspiring things explained by the blessed one, we honor anyone in whom these things are found
The Buddha  praised this kind of meditation, the 4 jhanas
> 
> Together, we invite the one to whom it falls [to recite the patimokkha]. If, while he is reciting, a monk remembers an offense or transgression, we deal with him in accordance with the dhamma, in accordance with what has been instructed. We're not the ones who deal with that venerable one. Rather, the Dhamma is what deals with us
 A monk 1 is virtuous. He dwells restrained, 2  very learned, 3 content 4 get 4 jhanas, 5 wield the many kinds of psychic power, 6 have clairaudience, 7 recollect many kinds of past lives, 8 clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn, 9 understand the minds of other beings, 10 realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life
The Buddha  did not praise  someone’s heart is overcome and mired in  sensual desire, ill  will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, nor doubt within they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate
