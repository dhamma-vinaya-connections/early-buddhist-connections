# MA12 - 惒破 - To Vappa
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A discussion with a jain on whether someone with purified understanding can experience the results of bad karma in the next life

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Defilements that arise because of certain body, verbal, mental  activity and ignorance
> 
> These don’t occur when ignorance fades away and knowledge arises. They don’t perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little
> 

> [!info] Similes
