# MA84 - 無刺 - Being without Thorns
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When the Buddha  receives noisy visitors, several monks withdraw to a nearby forest to meditate. The Buddha  praises them, saying that noise is a thorn to absorption

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> To one who is keeping morality, breaches of morality are a thorn; to 
one guarding the senses, bodily adornments are a thorn; to one cultivating 
[the perception] of foulness, an appearance of purity is a thorn; to one 
cultivating loving-kindness, anger is a thorn; to one abstaining from liquor, 
drinking liquor is a thorn; to one leading a celibate life, looking at the female form is a thorn
> 
> Sound is a thorn to 1 jhanas,  placing the mind and keeping it connected are a thorn to 2 jhanas, rapture is a thorn to 3 jhana, breathing is a thorn to 4 jhana,  perception and feeling are a thorn to the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling. Greed, hate, and delusion are thorns.
