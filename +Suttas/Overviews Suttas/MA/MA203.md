# MA203 - 晡利多 - With Potaliya
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When potaliya got upset at being referred to as “householder”, the Buddha  quizzed him as to the true nature of attachment and renunciation
Using seven graphic similes for the drawbacks of sensual passions, the Buddha  teaches potaliya the householder what it means, in the discipline of a noble one, to have entirely cut off one's worldly affairs

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Eight things for cutting off of affairs: not killing, stealing,
Lying,  sexual misconduct, greed and lust, harmfulness and hatred, anger and distress, nor arrogance
Sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks
> 
> The 8 things are giving up by reflecting: One who takes what is not  given will certainly experience bad results in this life and in future lives. 
If I were to be one who takes what is not given, I would harm myself and 
be spoken ill of by others. My bad reputation would be heard of in all directions. With the breaking up of the body at the ending of life 
I would certainly go to a bad destiny, being reborn in hell
Having truly seen this with right understanding, they reject equanimity based on diversity and develop only the equanimity based on unity, where all kinds of grasping to the world’s material delights cease without anything left over
