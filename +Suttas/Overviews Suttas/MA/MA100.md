# MA100 - 苦因 - Mass of Dukkha second
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> What mental qualities must be abandoned in order to free oneself of greed, aversion, and delusion? Can painful austerities be used to purify oneself and burn away the karmic fruit of past misdeeds? Through question-and-answer dialogues with the lay follower mahanama and with a group of jain ascetics, the Buddha  lays these questions to rest.
A lay person is puzzled at how, despite their long practice, they still have greedy or hateful thoughts. The Buddha  explains the importance of absorption meditation for letting go such attachments. But he also criticizes self-mortification, and recounts a previous dialog with jain ascetics

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Wrong doctrines: eliminating past deeds by mortification, and not doing any new deeds, there’s nothing to come up in the future. pleasure is not gained through pleasure; pleasure is gained through pain
For sensuality: gratification of 5 kinds of sensual pleasures; drawbacks unpleasant things, hard work is wasted, what used to be mine is gone, fighting, war, bad conduct of body, speech, and mind with bad consequences in this life and after death. escape from sensual pleasure is to chieve rapture and bliss, or something more peaceful than that, .
> 
> Right practices :  achieve the rapture and bliss that are apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities or something even more peaceful than that up to 7 days
