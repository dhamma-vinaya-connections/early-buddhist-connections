> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Upon checking, a mendicant sees that they haven’t given up all these bad, unskillful qualities, they should make an effort to give them all up, but if they have giving them up, they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities
> 
> Qualities that make one hard to admonish: has wicked desires,  themselves and puts others down, irritable, overcome by anger, hostile, stubborn, blurt out words bordering on anger, when accused they object rebuke, or retort to the accuser, they dodge the issue, distract the discussion with irrelevant points, and display annoyance, hate, and bitterness,  don’t accept the consequences of their deeds, they are offensive and contemptuous, jealous and stingy, devious and deceitfull, obstinate and vain, attached to their own views, and refusing to let go
