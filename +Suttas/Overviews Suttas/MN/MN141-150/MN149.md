# MN149 - Mahāsaḷāyatanika Sutta - Great Discourse on the Six Sense Fields
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Explains how insight into the six senses is integrated with the eightfold path and leads to liberation
How a clear understanding of the six senses leads to the development of the wings to awakening and to final release

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When you ruly know and see the 6 internal, external senses and their consciousness and contact and the pleasant, painful, or neutral feelings that arises conditioned by contact, you’re not aroused by desire for these things.
When the noble eightfold path is developed, the following are fully developed: the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, and the seven awakening factors
> 
> Someone who lives unaroused like this—unfettered, unconfused, concentrating on drawbacks—disperses the the five grasping aggregates for themselves in the future. And Their craving—which leads to future rebirth, mixed up with relishing and greed, looking for enjoyment in various different realms—is given up. Their Physical and mental stress, torment, and fever are given up. And They experience physical and mental pleasure
The five grasping aggregates should be completely understood, ignorance and craving for continued existence should be given up, serenity and discernment should be developed, knowledge and freedom should be realized by direct knowledge.
