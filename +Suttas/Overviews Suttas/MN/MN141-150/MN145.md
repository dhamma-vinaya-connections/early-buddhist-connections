# MN145 - Puṇṇovāda Sutta - Advice to Puṇṇa
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> On the eve of his departure to a distant country, full of wild and unpredictable people, venerable puṇṇa is asked by the Buddha  how he would respond if attacked there

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> If a mendicant doesn’t approve, welcome, and keep clinging to them, relishing ceases. When Relishing ceases, suffering ceases, I say.
If they take my life with a sharp knife, I’ll think:‘there are disciples of the Buddha  who looked for someone to assist with slitting their wrists because they were horrified, repelled, and disgusted with the body and with life. And I have found this without looking!
> 
> are sights known by the eye, sounds known by the ear … smells known by the nose … tastes known by the tongue … touches known by the body … thoughts known by the mind that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant
If they abuse and insult me I will think they don’t hit me, if they do,  will think they don’t throw stones at me, if they do I will think they don’t stab me with a knife. if they do I will think they don’t take my life with a sharp knife
