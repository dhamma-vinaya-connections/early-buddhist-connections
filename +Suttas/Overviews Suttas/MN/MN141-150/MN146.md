# MN146 - Nandakovāda Sutta - Advice from Nandaka
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When asked to teach the nuns, venerable Nandaka proceeds by inviting them to engage with his discourse and ask if there is anything that needs further explanation
Nandaka discusses impermanence with a large group of nuns, driving his point home with particularly vivid similes. It was an effective teaching: soon afterwards, these nuns all become enlightened.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> It’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, it is not fit to be regarded thus: ‘this is mine, I am this, this is my self
Developing and cultivating these seven awakening factors, a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
> 
> The  six interior, 6 exterior sense fields and six classes of consciousness are impermanent. That’s how it is for a noble disciple who truly sees with right wisdom
Awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Oil lamp and it's light like internal senses and it's feelings. also tree and it's shadow like external senses and it's feelings
 cow is  joined to its hide  with the knife like knife of wisdom disjointed desire for 6 senses fields
