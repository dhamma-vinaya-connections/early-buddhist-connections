# MN150 - Nagaravindeyya Sutta - With the People of Nagaravinda
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> In discussion with a group of householders, the Buddha  helps them to distinguish those spiritual practitioners who are truly worthy of respect

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Clearly those venerables are free of greed, hate, and delusion, or practicing to be free of them because they frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest where there are no stimulation to enjoy
> 
> There are ascetics and brahmins who are free of greed, hate, and delusion for sights known by the eye, for sounds known by the ear … smells known by the nose … tastes known by the tongue …touches known by the body … thoughts known by the mind,  who are peaceful inside, and who conduct themselves well by way of body, speech, and mind. They deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration
