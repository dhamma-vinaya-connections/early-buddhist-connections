# MN148 - Chachakka Sutta - Six By Six
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  analyzes the six senses from six perspectives, and demonstrates the emptiness of all of them.
How the contemplation of the six senses leads to an understanding of not-self and, ultimately, to awakening

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The arising and vanishing of all of these  is evident, so it would follow that one’s self arises and vanishes. That’s Why it’s not tenable to claim that any of these iis self
The path of practice leading to the cessation of self-identification. One assumes about the eye that 'this is not me, this is not my self, this is not what I am.
After giving up the underlying tendency to greed for pleasant feeling, after dispelling the underlying tendency to repulsion towards painful feeling, after eradicating ignorance in the case of neutral feeling, after giving up ignorance and giving rise to knowledge, it’s totally possible to make an end of suffering in the present life
> 
> Dependent on 6 interior the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind and their exterior objects  and respect consciousness, the meeting of the 3 is contact, that is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving.
Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, sights, eye consciousness, eye contact, feeling, and craving, being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When it is freed, they know it is freed
When you experience a pleasant feeling, if you don’t approve, welcome, and keep clinging to it, 
The underlying tendency to greed does not underlie that. When You experience a painful feeling, if you don’t sorrow or wail or lament,  the underlying tendency to repulsion does not underlie that. When You experience a neutral feeling, if you truly understand that feeling’s origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape, the underlying tendency to ignorance does not underlie that
