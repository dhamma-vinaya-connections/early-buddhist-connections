# MN96 - Esukārī Sutta - With Esukārī
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A brahmin claims that one deserves service and privilege depending on caste, but the Buddha  counters that it is conduct, not caste, that show a person’s worth

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> I declare that a person’s own wealth is the noble, transcendent teaching
I don’t say that people from eminent families , beautiful, 
Or not very beautiful,who are very wealthy, or not very wealthy makes you a better or worse person.
> 
> I say that you should serve someone if serving them makes you grow in faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom, and makes you better, not worse
Whoever refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and committing sexual misconduct. They refrain from using speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re not covetous or malicious, and they have right view are better persons
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Fire from different woods is still the same, like liberation is the same regardless of castes
