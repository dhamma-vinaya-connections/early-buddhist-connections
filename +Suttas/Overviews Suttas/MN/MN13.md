# MN13 - Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta - Mass of Suffering, Longer Discourse
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Challenged to show the difference between his teaching and that of other ascetics, the Buddha  points out that they speak of letting go, but do not really understand why. He then explains in great detail the suffering that arises from attachment to sensual stimulation
In deliciously graphic terms, the Buddha  describes the allures and drawbacks of sensuality, physical form, and feeling. What better incentive could there be to escape samsara once and for all?

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> For sensuality: gratification of 5 kinds of sensual pleasures; drawbacks unpleasant things, hard work is wasted, what used to be mine is gone, fighting, war, bad conduct of body, speech, and mind with bad consequences in this life and after death. escape removing and giving up desire and greed for sensuality
Truly understand sensual pleasures, form & feelings gratification, drawback, and escape for what they are
> 
> For form: gratification is the pleasure and happiness that arise from beauty and prettiness; drawbacks are old age, sickness and death; escape is removing and giving up desire and greed for forms
For feelings: gratification are unafflicted feelings from jhanas; drawbacks are feelings are impermanent, suffering, and perishable; escape removing abandoning  and giving up desire and greed for feelings
