# MN72 - Aggivaccha Sutta - Vacchagotta on Fire
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Refusing to take a stance regarding useless metaphysical speculations, the Buddha  illustrates the spiritual goal with the simile of a flame going out
The Buddha  explains to a wanderer why he does not hold any speculative views. Using the simile of an extinguished fire he illustrates the destiny of the liberated being

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The world is, or is not eternal, finite or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or different things; a realized one exists, doesn't exist, both exist, neither exists after death;
The realized one has done away with convictions.For The realized one has seen: ‘such is form, feelings, perceptions, fabrications and consciousness, such is their origin and such is their ending
It’s hard for you to understand, since you have a different view, creed, preference, practice, and tradition.
> 
> Each of these ten convictions is the the trick of views, the fetter of views. They’re beset with anguish, distress, and fever. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. Seeing This drawback I avoid all these convictions
Any form, feelings, perceptions, fabrications or consciousness by which a realized one might be described has been cut off at the root and unable to arise in the future. A Realized one is freed from reckoning in those terms. They’re deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom, like the ocean.‘They’re Reborn’, ‘they’re not reborn’, ‘they’re both reborn and not reborn’, ‘they’re neither reborn nor not reborn’—none of these apply
For this principle is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of reason, subtle, comprehensible to the astute.
