# MN94 - Ghoṭamukha Sutta - With Ghoṭamukha
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A brahmin denies that there is such a thing as a principled renunciate life, but venerable Udena persuades him otherwise

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> One person mortifies themselves, one person mortifies others, one person mortifies themselves and others, one person doesn’t mortify either themselves or others
The person who doesn’t mortify either themselves or others—living without wishes, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, having become holy in themselves—does not torment themselves or others, both of whom want to be happy and recoil from pain
> 
> The person who mortifies themselves does so even though they want to be happy and recoil from pain,  person who mortifies others does so even though others want to be happy and recoil from pain. The person who mortifies themselves and others does so even though both themselves and others want to be happy and recoil from pain the person who doesn’t mortify either themselves or others—living without wishes, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, having become holy in themselves—does not torment themselves or others, both of whom want to be happy and recoil from pain
Noble spectrum of ethics, they’re content with robes to look after the body and alms-food to look after the belly, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness, they frequent a secluded lodging and give up these five hindrances, 4 jhanas, 3 knowledges knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. When They’re freed, they know they’re freed
