# MN83 - Maghadeva Sutta - About King Makhādeva
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A rare extended mythic narrative, telling of an ancient kingly lineage and their eventual downfall

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> I have founded a good practice that does lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.
> 
> It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: 
Right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. You all should keep up this good practice that I have founded. Do not be my final men
