# MN78 - Samaṇamuṇḍika Sutta - With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamuṇḍika
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Wanderer teaches that a person has reached the highest attainment when they keep four basic ethical precepts. The Buddha ’s standards are considerably higher.
The highest attainment is not simply the abandoning of unskillful actions and a reversion to childlike harmlessness. It requires first developing skillful habits and skillful resolves, and then letting them go.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Skillful deeds by way of body and speech, and purified livelihood, and they stem from a mind that is free from greed, hate, and delusion, their cessation is when a mendicant behaves ethically, but they don’t identify with their ethical behavior. And They truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom
Someone is practicing for the cessation of unskillful behaviors and thoughts when generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise, and that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up
Thoughts of sensuality, of malice, and of cruelty are unskillful, they stem from perceptions of sensuality, malice, and cruelty and they cease without anything left over in first jhana
When an individual has these ten qualities, I describe them as an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment
> 
> Unskillful deeds by way of body and speech, and bad livelihood, they stem from a mind that has greed, hate, and delusion, their cessation it’s when a mendicant gives up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develops good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind; they give up wrong livelihood and earn a living by right livelihood,
Someone practicing for the cessation of skillful behaviors and thoughts, they generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities arise, and  that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed by development
Thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness are called skillful, they stem from  perceptions of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness, and they cease without anything left over in the second jhana
Someone who has an adept’s right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right immersion, right knowledge, and right freedom
> 

> [!info] Similes
> A person who do no bad deeds with their body; speak no bad words; think no bad thoughts; and don’t earn a living by bad livelihood, has attained the same level as a baby
