# MN109 - Mahāpuṇṇama Sutta - Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> On a lovely full moon night, one of the mendicants presents the Buddha  with a series of questions that go to the heart of the teaching. But when he hears of the doctrine of not-self, another mendicant is unable to grasp the meaning
A thorough discussion of issues related to the five aggregates. Toward the end of the discussion, a monk thinks that he has found a loophole in the teaching. The way the Buddha  handles this incident shows the proper use of the teachings on the aggregates: not as a metaphysical theory, but as a tool for questioning clinging and so gaining release

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Five grasping aggregates are rooted in desire, the desire and greed for them is the grasping,
An uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones regard form, feelings,perceptions, fabrications or consciousness  as self, self as having them, form … in self, or self in form ...
The pleasure and happiness that arise from form: this is its gratification. That Form is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.Removing And giving up desire and greed for form: this is its escape.
> 
> Four primary elements are the reason why the aggregate of form is found. Contact Is the reason why the aggregates of feeling … perception … and choices are found. Name And form are the reasons why the aggregate of consciousness is found
So you should truly see any kind  of form, feeling, perceptions, fabrications and consciousness  at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near, with right understanding: ‘this is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.
Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed
