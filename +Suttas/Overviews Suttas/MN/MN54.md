# MN54 - Potaliya Sutta - With Potaliya the Wanderer
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When potaliya got upset at being referred to as “householder”, the Buddha  quizzed him as to the true nature of attachment and renunciation
Using seven graphic similes for the drawbacks of sensual passions, the Buddha  teaches potaliya the householder what it means, in the discipline of a noble one, to have entirely cut off one's worldly affairs

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Eight things for cutting off of affairs: not killing, stealing,
Lying,  divisive speech, greed and lust, blaming and insulting, anger and distress, nor arrogance
Sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks
> 
> The 8 things are giving up by reflecting: if I were to be arrogant, because of that I would reprimand myself; sensible people, after examination, would criticize me; and when my body breaks up, after death, I could expect to be reborn in a bad place, and arrogance is itself a fetter and a hindrance.
Having truly seen this with right understanding, they reject equanimity based on diversity and develop only the equanimity based on unity, where all kinds of grasping to the world’s material delights cease without anything left over
