# MN118 - Ānāpānassati Sutta - Mindfulness of Breathing
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Surrounded by many well-practiced mendicants, the Buddha  teaches mindfulness of breathing in detail, showing how they relate to the four kinds of mindfulness meditation
One of the most important texts for beginning and veteran meditators alike, this sutta is the Buddha 's roadmap to the entire course of meditation practice, using the vehicle of breath meditation. The simple practice of mindfulness of breathing leads the practitioner gradually through 16 successive phases of development, culminating in full awakening

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> An assembly such as this is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world
Whenever a mendicant knows that they breathe heavily, or lightly, or experiencing the whole body, or stilling the body’s motion—at that time they’re meditating by observing an aspect of the body. For I say that the in-breaths and out-breaths are an aspect of the body
Whenever a mendicant practices breathing while experiencing the mind, or gladdening the mind, or immersing the mind in samādhi, or freeing the mind—at that time they meditate observing an aspect of the mind, there is no development of mindfulness of breathing for someone who is unmindful and lacks awareness, I say
On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body, feelings, mind and dhammas. putting aside greed & distress with reference to the world, on that occasion his mindfulness is steady & without lapse then mindfulness as a factor for awakening becomes aroused. they develop it and perfect it.
> 
> In this saṅgha there are perfected mendicants, who have ended the defilements, with  the ending of the five lower fetters, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, are once-returners, with the ending of three fetters are stream-enterers, who  are committed to developing the four kinds of mindfulness meditation … the four right efforts … the four bases of psychic power … the five faculties … the five powers … the seven awakening factors … the noble eightfold path, to developing the meditation on love …compassion … rejoicing … equanimity … ugliness …impermanence, to developing the meditation on mindfulness of breathing
Whenever a mendicant practices breathing while experiencing rapture, or experiencing bliss, or experiencing these emotions, or stilling these emotions—at that time they meditate observing an aspect of feelings, keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. For I say that close attention to the in-breaths and out-breaths is an aspect of feelings
Whenever a mendicant practices breathing while observing impermanence, or observing fading away,or observing cessation, or observing letting go—at that time they meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Having Seen with wisdom the giving up of desire and aversion, they watch over closely with equanimity
As they live mindfully in this way they investigate, explore, and inquire into that principle with wisdom has activated the awakening factor of investigation of principles, in this way their energy is roused up and unflagging, activated the awakening factor of energy. When they’re energetic, spiritual rapture arises. When the mind is full of rapture, the body and mind become tranquil, when the body is tranquil and they feel bliss, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.They Closely watch over that mind immersed in samādhi. which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go
