# MN36 - Mahāsaccaka Sutta - Longer Discourse With Saccaka
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> In a less confrontational meeting, the Buddha  and saccaka discuss the difference between physical and mental development. The Buddha  gives a long account of the various practices he did before awakening, detailing the astonishing lengths he took to mortify the body.
In response to an insinuating remark — that his ability not to be overcome by pleasure and pain is due simply to the fact that he never experienced any intense pleasures or pains — the Buddha  recounts the pains he endured in his austerities, and the pleasures that attended the path to and his attainment of awakening.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Someone whose mind is not occupied by both pleasant and painful feelings like this is developed in physical endurance and in mind
History of the steps the Buddha  took since he gone forth and set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace
Don't be afraid of jhanas  pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities
> 
> When they experience pleasant feeling they don’t become full of lust for it. Then That pleasant feeling ceases. And When it ceases, painful feeling arises. When They experience painful feelings they don’t sorrow or lament, because their physical endurance is developed, pleasant feelings don’t occupy the mind. And because their mind is developed, painful feelings don’t occupy the mind.
Approached, learn & memorize from āḷāra kālāma who thought the dimension of nothingness, approached uddaka, son of rāma who thought him the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, tortured mind with mind, breathless absorption, cutting off food, and then turn to the 4 jhanas and 3 knowledges
Experienced painful, feelings due to overexertion,  the Buddha  did not achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision, because his body was disturbed
