# MN62 - Mahārāhulovāda Sutta - Longer Advice to Rāhula
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  tells Rāhula to meditate on not-self, which he immediately puts into practice. Seeing him, venerable Sāriputta advises him to develop breath meditation, but the Buddha  suggests a wide range of different practices first.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Form, feeling and perception and choices and consciousness are is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self
Seeing body as just elements, and that internal and external elements are just elements so detaching the mind from them. To have a mind as neutral as the elements.
Meditate on ugliness any lust will be given up, on impermanence any conceit ‘I am’ will be given up
All the steps of mindfulness of breathing
> 
> You should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘this is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self
The interior earth element is said to be anything hard, solid, and organic that’s internal, anything that’s water, watery, and organic that’s internal, pertaining to an individua, anything that’s fire, fiery, and organic that’s internal, anything that’s wind, windy, and organic that’s internal, anything that’s space, spacious, and organic that’s internal, pertaining to an individua
Meditate on love any ill will will be given up, on compassion any cruelty will be given up, on rejoicing any negativity will be given up, on equanimity any repulsion will be given up.
Mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated in this way, is very fruitful and beneficial.When Mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated in this way, even when the final breaths in and out cease, they are known, not unknown
