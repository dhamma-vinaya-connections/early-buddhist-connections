# MN77 - Mahāsakuludāyi Sutta - With Sakuludāyī Longer Discourse
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Unlike many teachers, the Buddha ’s followers treat him with genuine love and respect, since they see the sincerity of his teaching and practice

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Five other qualities because of which my disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate me
I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the 37 factors of enlightenment, and many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
The eight liberations, The ten universal dimensions of meditation, The eight dimensions of mastery
The 4 jhanas with similes
I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to understand this
I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to wield the many kinds of psychic power
, clairvoyance to see sentient beings passing away and being reborn,  clairaudience, understand the minds of other beings and individuals, recollect the many kinds of past lives,
> 
> He possesses the entire spectrum of ethical conduct to the highest degree, excellent knowledge and vision, he possesses the entire spectrum of wisdom to the highest degree, he provided satisfied answers on how the 4 noble truth apply to the suffering that has overwhelmed them, and explained to my disciples a practice to all factors of awakening as follows:
The four kinds of mindfulness meditation,  four right efforts,  four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers,  seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path
1 having physical form, they see visions; 2 not perceiving form internally, they see visions externally; 3 they’re focused only on beauty; 4 the dimension of infinite space; 5 the dimension of infinite consciousness; 6 the dimension of nothingness; 7 the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception; 8 the cessation of perception and feeling
1 jhana there’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion, 2 jhana there’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion, 3 jhana there’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture, 4 jhana there’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind
 body of mine is physical. It’s made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction. And This consciousness of mine is attached to it,
Knowledge and vision, mind-made body, many kinds of psychic power, clairaudience, comprehending the minds of others, recollection of past lives, clairvoyance, knowledge of the ending of defilements
To realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements

> [!info] Similes
> 1 jhana like ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, 2 jhana like a deep lake fed by spring wate, 3 jhana like water lilies that sprout and grow in the water, 4 jhana like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth 
 beryl gem strung with a thread, like the consciousness attached to the body
well-prepared clay, ivory or gold, like a well prepared mind
a lake that was transparent, clear, and unclouded. A person with good eyesight standing on the bank would see the mussel shells, gravel and pebbles, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still
