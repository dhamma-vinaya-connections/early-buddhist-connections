# MN74 - Dīghanakha Sutta - With Dīghanakha
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A discussion of how to abandon doctrinaire views of radical acceptance, radical rejection, and any combination of the two
Deftly outmaneuvering an extreme skeptic, the Buddha  discusses the outcomes of belief and disbelief. Rather than getting stuck in abstractions, he encourages staying close to the feelings one experiences

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Their view of what they believe in is close to greed, bondage, approving, attachment, and grasping. Their View of what they don’t believe in is far from greed and attachment
Pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings are impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated, liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease. Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with them, then desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed
> 
> Considering in themselves the potential for arguing, quarreling, anguish, and harm, they give up that view by not grasping nor obstinately stick to this view. That’s how those views are given up and let go.
This body is physical. It’s made up of the four primary elements, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, and destruction. You should see it as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as an abscess, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self. Doing So, you’ll give up desire, affection, and subservience to the body
