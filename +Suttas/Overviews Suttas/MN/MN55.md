# MN55 - Jīvaka Sutta - With Jīvaka
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha ’s personal doctor, jīvaka, hears criticisms of the Buddha ’s policy regarding eating meat, and asks him about it

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Meat may not be eaten if it’s seen, heard, or suspected if is specific for the bhikkhus
Anyone who slaughters a living creature specially for the realized one or the realized one’s disciple makes much bad karma for five reasons
Any greed, hate, or delusion that might give rise to ill will has been given up by the realized one, cut off at the root
> 
> A bhikkhu that meditate spreading a heart full of love, compassion, rejoice and equanimity when invited for a meal, they eat that alms-food untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawback, and understanding the escape
When they say: ‘go, fetch that living creature, when that living creature experiences pain and sadness as it’s led along by a collar, when they say: ‘go, slaughter that living creature, when that living creature experiences pain and sadness as it’s being slaughtered, when they provide the realized one or the realized one’s disciple with unallowable food
They meditate spreading a heart full of love, compassion, rejoice or equanimity  to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love, compassion, rejoice or equanimity  to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will
