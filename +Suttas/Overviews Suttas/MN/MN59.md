# MN59 - Bahuvedanīya Sutta - Many Kinds of Feeling
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  resolves a disagreement on the number of kinds of feelings that he taught, pointing out that different ways of teaching are appropriate in different contexts, and should not be a cause of disputes. He goes on to show the importance of pleasure in developing higher meditation
The Buddha  discusses the range of possible pleasures and joys, and concludes by advocating a pleasure that goes beyond feeling. [the text of this sutta is almost identical to that of sn 36.19.]

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> I’ve explained the teaching in all these different ways. 
This being so, you can expect that those who do concede, approve, or agree with what has been well spoken will live in harmony, appreciating each other
 when the Buddha  describes what’s included in happiness, he’s not just referring to pleasant feeling. 
The realized one describes pleasure as included in happiness wherever it’s found, and in whatever context
> 
> In one explanation I’ve spoken of two feelings. In another explanation I’ve spoken of three feelings, or five, six, eighteen, thirty-six, or a hundred and eight feelings. 
There are five kinds of sensual pleasures, finer pleasures are the 4 jhanas, finer pleasures are the 4 immaterial jhanas and the finest is cessation of perceptions and feelings
