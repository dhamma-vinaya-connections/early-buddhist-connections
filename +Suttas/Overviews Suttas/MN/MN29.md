# MN29 - Mahāsāropama Sutta - Longer Simile of the Heartwood
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Following the incident with Devadatta, the Buddha  cautions the mendicants against becoming complacent with superficial benefits of spiritual life and points to liberation as the true heart of the teaching

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Gentleman who has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness, thinking, 
‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m mired in suffering. Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering
> 
> spiritual life is not lived for the sake of possessions, honor, and popularity, or for accomplishment in ethics, or for accomplishment in immersion, or for knowledge and vision. 
Rather, the goal, heartwood, and final end of the spiritual life is the unshakable freedom of heart.
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Heartwood, softwood, bark, shoots, and branches and leaves, like the benefits of bhikkhu life
