# MN73 - Mahāvaccha Sutta - Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> In the final installment of the “vacchagotta trilogy”, vacchagotta lets go his obsession with meaningless speculation, and asks about practice

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Greed is unskillful, contentment is skillful. Hate Is unskillful, love is skillful. Delusion Is unskillful, understanding is skillful
 because master gotama, monks, nuns, celibate laymen, laymen enjoying sensual pleasures, celibate laywomen, and laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures have all succeeded in this teaching, this spiritual path is complete in that respect.
Further develop two things: serenity and discernment. When You have further developed these two things, they’ll lead to the penetration of many elements
> 
> Killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; covetousness, ill will, and wrong view: these things are unskillful. Refraining From killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; refraining from speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; contentment, kind-heartedness, and right view: these things are skillful
Who has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, with the ending of the five lower fetters, is reborn spontaneously, to be extinguished there, has gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and lives self-assured and independent of others regarding the teacher’s instruction
Knowledge and vision, mind-made body, many kinds of psychic power, clairaudience, comprehending the minds of others, recollection of past lives, clairvoyance, knowledge of the ending of defilements
