# MN95 - Caṅkī Sutta - With Caṅkī
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The reputed brahmin caṅkī goes with a large group to visit the Buddha , despite the reservations of other brahmins. A precocious student challenges the Buddha , affirming the validity of the vedic scriptures. The Buddha  gives a detailed explanation of how true understanding gradually emerges through spiritual education
A pompous brahman teenager questions the Buddha  about safeguarding, awakening to, and attaining the truth. In the course of his answer, the Buddha  describes the criteria for choosing a reliable teacher and how best to learn from such a person

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> This is the extent of master gotama’s praise that I have learned. But his praises are not confined to this,for the praise of master gotama is limitless
These five things can be seen to turn out in two different ways. For a sensible person who is preserving truth this is not sufficient to come to the definite conclusion: 
‘this is the only truth, other ideas are silly
Approaches and scrutinizes them for three kinds of things: 
Things that arouse greed, things that provoke hate, and things that promote delusion. ‘Does this venerable have any qualities that arouse any of these
That’s how the awakening to truth is defined, and by the cultivation, development, and making much of these very same things there is the arrival at the truth
> 
> He went forth from an eminent, rich, affluent, and wealthy  family of unbroken aristocratic lineage while he was still young; he is ethical,  a good speaker, teacher of teachers, he has ended sensual desire, teaches the efficacy of deeds and action, many thousands of deities, brahmins and kings  have gone for refuge for life to him, he has this good reputation: ‘that blessed one is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha , accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed, he has the thirty-two marks of a great man
Faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, and acceptance of a view after consideration,  preserve truth by saying, ‘such is the view I have accepted after any of this 5 things, but they don’t yet come to the definite conclusion: 
‘this is the only truth, other ideas are silly.
Scrutinizing them they find: 
‘this venerable has no such qualities that arouse greed.Rather, that venerable has bodily and verbal behavior like that of someone without greed. And The principle that they teach is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of reason, subtle, comprehensible to the astute. It’s Not easy for someone with greed to teach this.
After scrutinizing they place faith in them. When faith has arisen they approach the teacher. They pay homage, lend an ear, hear the teachings, remember the teachings, reflect on their meaning, and accept them after consideration. Then enthusiasm springs up; they make an effort, weigh up, and persevere. Persevering, they directly realize the ultimate truth, and see it with penetrating wisdom
