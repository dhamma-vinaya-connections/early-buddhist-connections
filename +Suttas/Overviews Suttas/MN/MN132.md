# MN132 - Ānandabhaddekaratta Sutta - Ānanda and One Fine Night
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> In this stirring discourse the Buddha  underscores the vital urgency of keeping one's attention firmly rooted in the present moment. After all, the past is gone, the future isn't here; this present moment is all we have. (The same discourse as mn 131, but spoken by venerable Ananda.)

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Don’t run back to the past, 
Don’t hope for the future. 
What’s past is left behind; 
The future has not arrived
> 
> don’t muster delight there, thinking: ‘I had such form in the past.’ … ‘I had such feeling … perception … choice … consciousness in the past,       don’t muster delight there, thinking: ‘may I have such form in the future.’ … ‘may I have such feeling … perception … choice … consciousness in the future
