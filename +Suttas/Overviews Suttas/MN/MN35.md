# MN35 - Cūḷasaccaka Sutta - Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Even though the Buddha  did not usually seek debates, he knew how to reply effectively when attacked. In this discourse, he gets saccaka — who uses a variety of cheap debater's tricks — to trip over those tricks. However, the Buddha  goes beyond simply defeating saccaka in debate. He then takes the opportunity to teach him the dhamma.
Saccaka was a debater, who challenged the Buddha  to a contest. Despite his bragging, the Buddha  is not at all perturbed at his attacks

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent therefore they are not-self. All Conditions are impermanent. All things are not-self
That’s how to define one of my disciples who follows instructions and responds to advice; who has gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, gained assurance, and is independent of others in the teacher’s instructions
> 
> Someone who clings, holds, and attaches to suffering, regarding it thus: ‘this is mine, I am this, this is my self.’ such a person is not able to completely understand suffering themselves, or live having wiped out suffering
It’s when one of my disciples truly sees any kind of form, feelings, perceptions, fabrications, consciousness  at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: with right understanding: ‘this is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self
