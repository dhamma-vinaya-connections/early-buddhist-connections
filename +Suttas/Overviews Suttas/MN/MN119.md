# MN119 - Kāyagatāsati Sutta - Mindfulness of the Body
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> This focuses on the first aspect of mindfulness meditation, the observation of the body. This set of practices, simple as they seem, have far-reaching benefits.
 This sutta serves as a companion to the anapanasati sutta, and explains the importance of establishing a broad awareness of the body in meditation to develop jhana

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts of the lay life are given up. Their Mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.That’s How a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body
Anyone who has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body includes all of the skillful qualities that play a part in realization, and Māra cannot find a vulnerability and doesn’t get hold of them
> 
> 1 mindfulness of breathing 2 whatever posture their body is in, they know it, 3  mindful and alert in every activity 4 examines their own body full of many kinds of filth, 5 in this body there is the earth, water, fire and air,  elements 6 compare  corpses with their own body:‘this body is also of that same nature, 7 first jhana, 8 second jhana, 9 third jhana, 10 fourth jhana with similes
Benefits: they prevail over desire and discontent, over fear and dread, endure cold, heat, hunger, and thirst and disagreeable things,  get the four absorption, wield the many kinds of psychic power, understand the minds of other beings, recollect many kinds of past lives, with clairvoyant see sentient beings passing away and being reborn, they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life
