# MN7 - Vattha Sutta - Simile of the Cloth
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> With a simple simile the Buddha  illustrates the difference between a defiled mind and a pure mind
The many different kinds of impurities that defile the mind are compared to a dirty cloth. When the mind is clean we find joy, which leads to states of higher consciousness. Finally, the Buddha  rejects the brahmanical notion that purity comes from bathing in sacred rivers

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When they have understood these corruptions of the mind for what they are, and have given them up, they have experiential confidence in the Buddha ,the Dhamma and the Sangha
They understand: ‘there is this, there is what is worse than this, there is what is better than this, and there is an escape beyond the scope of perception. Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance
For the pure in heart it’s always 
The spring festival or the sabbath. 
For the pure in heart and clean of deed, 
Their vows will always be fulfilled. 
It’s here alone that you should bathe, brahmin, 
Making yourself a sanctuary for all creatures
> 
> Corruptions of the mind

Covetousness and immoral greed, ill will, anger, hostility, offensiveness, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deceit, deviousness, obstinacy, aggression, conceit, arrogance, vanity, and negligence
Thinking: ‘I have discarded, eliminated, released, given up, and relinquished to this extent, the corruptions,  they find joy in the meaning and  connected with the teaching.
When they’re joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.
They meditate spreading a heart full of love, compassion, rejoice and equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love, compassion, rejoice and equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will
