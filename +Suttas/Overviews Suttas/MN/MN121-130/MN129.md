# MN129 - Bālapaṇḍita Sutta - Foolish and the Astute
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A fool suffers both in this life and the next, while the astute benefits in both respects

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A fool thinks poorly, speaks poorly, and acts poorly. They experience suffering of  shame, regret and fear of punishment in this present life
If there’s anything of which it may be rightly said that it is utterly likable, desirable, and agreeable, it is of heaven that this should be said, compared to the happiness of heaven, the pleasure and happiness experienced by a wheel-turning monarch due to those seven treasures and those four blessings doesn’t even count, it’s not even a fraction, there’s no comparison
I haven’t done bad, violent, and corrupt things. And I have done good and skillful deeds that keep me safe
> 
> Wise man thinks wholesome thoughts, speaks wholesome speech, and 
does wholesome deeds that he is a wise man and is said to be wise.
 it’s not easy to completely describe the suffering in the animal realm or hell, compared to the suffering in hell, the pain and distress experienced by that man due to being struck with three hundred spears doesn’t even count, it’s not even a fraction, there’s no comparison
Suppose a gambler on the first lucky throw was to win a big pile of money. But Such a lucky throw is trivial compared to the lucky throw whereby an astute person, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm

Himalayas compared with a rock, like suffering of hell
