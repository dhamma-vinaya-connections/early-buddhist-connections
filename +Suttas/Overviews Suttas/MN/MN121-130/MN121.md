# MN121 - Cūḷasuññata Sutta - Emptiness Shorter Discourse
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  describes his own practice of the meditation on emptiness. The Buddha  instructs ven. Ananda on the practice that leads to the "entry into emptiness," the doorway to liberation

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Not attending to the perception of human being, not attending to the perception of wilderness, perception of earth, perception of the dimension of the infinitude of space, perception of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, perception of the dimension of nothingness, singleness based on the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, that is not emptiness, namely that associated with the six sense fields dependent on this body and conditioned by life.
> 
> Attends to the singleness based on the theme-less concentration of awareness. His mind takes pleasure, finds satisfaction, settles, & indulges in its theme,  he discerns that 'whatever is fabricated & mentally fashioned is inconstant & subject to cessation.' For him — thus knowing, thus seeing — the mind is released from the effluent of sensuality, of becoming,  of ignorance
