# MN122 - Mahāsuññata Sutta - Longer Discourse on Emptiness
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A group of mendicants have taken to socializing too much, so the Buddha  teaches on the importance of seclusion in order to enter fully into emptiness
Issues include the need for seclusion as a conducive setting for the practice, types of conversation and thinking that are beneficial and harmful for the practice, the dangers of being distracted by visitors, and the proper attitude to have toward one's teacher
The Buddha  instructs Ananda on several practical aspects of the meditative dwelling in emptiness, a mode of awareness that can ultimately bring the meditator to the threshold of awakening

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> I do not envision even a single form whose change & alteration would not give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair in one who is passionate for it and takes delight in it
May I enter & remain in internal emptiness,' then he should get the mind steadied right within, settled, unified, & concentrated
He discerns, 'while I am attending to the imperturbable, my mind takes pleasure, finds satisfaction, grows steady, & indulges in the imperturbable.' In this way he is alert there.
Mind inclines to walking, to standing... to sitting... to lying down, he lies down, talking  [thinking,] 'while doing thus, no desire and aversion, no evil, unskillful qualities will take possession of me.' In this way he is alert there
I will engage in speech about self-effacement that helps open the heart and leads solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. That is, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom
As he stays keeping track of arising & passing away with regard to these five clinging-aggregates, he abandons any conceit that 'I am' with regard to these five clinging-aggregates
While meditating withdrawn, they’re visited by a stream of brahmins and householders of the city and country. When This happens, they enjoy infatuation, fall into greed, and return to indulgence. They’re Ruined by bad, unskillful qualities that are corrupted, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.
> 
> A monk who lives alone, withdrawn from the group, can expect to enter & remain in the awareness-release that is temporary and pleasing, or in the awareness-release that is not-temporary and beyond provocation, the pleasure of self-awakening
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption
They understand: ‘I am focusing on emptiness internally, externally or both but my mind isn’t eager, confident, settled, and decided, in this way he is clearly aware and he should get the mind steadied right within, settled, unified, & concentrated in his first theme of concentration
But I will think the kind of thought that is noble and emancipating, and brings one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering. That is, thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness.’ In This way they are aware of the situation.
Not in speech that is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless: talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence
Meditate observing rise and fall in these five grasping aggregates: ‘such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such Is feeling … such is perception … such are choices …such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness
When the teacher teaches the Dhamma out of kindness and compassion: ‘this is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’ But Their disciples don’t want to listen. They don’t pay attention or apply their minds to understand
