# MN127 - Anuruddha Sutta - With Anuruddha
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A lay person becomes confused when encouraged to develop the “limitless” and “expansive” liberations, and asks venerable anuruddha to explain whether they are the same or different

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Limitless release of the heart, it’s when a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love, compassion, rejoice and equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will
Gods of limited radiance, gods of limitless radiance,  gods of corrupted radiance, gods of pure radiance, when who meditates determined on pervading according after death they are reborn like that
Corrupted radiance, their physical discomfort is not completely settled, their dullness and drowsiness is not completely eradicated, and their restlessness and remorse is not completely eliminated. Because Of this they practice absorption dimly, as it were
> 
> Expansive  release of the heart it’s when a mendicant meditates determined on pervading the extent of a single tree root, 2 or 3 trees roots a single village district … two or three village districts … a single kingdom … two or three kingdoms … this land surrounded by ocean as expansive with his kasina sign
It’s not that those deities think, ‘what we have is permanent, lasting, and eternal.’ Rather, wherever those deities cling, that’s where they take pleasure
Pure radiance’. Their Physical discomfort is completely settled, their dullness and drowsiness is completely eradicated, and their restlessness and remorse is completely eliminated. Because Of this they don’t practice absorption dimly, as it were
