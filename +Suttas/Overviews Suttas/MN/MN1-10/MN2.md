# MN2 - Sabbāsava Sutta - All the Defilements
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  teaches seven methods for eliminating from the mind the deeply rooted defilements (sensuality, becoming, views, and ignorance) that obstruct the realization of awakening.
The diverse problems of the spiritual journey demand a diverse range of responses. Rather than applying the same solution to every problem, the Buddha  outlines seven methods of dealing with defilements, each of which works in certain cases

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The ending of defilements is for one who pay proper attention, so defilements don’t arise, and those that have already arisen are given up
Not paying attention to what they should not and paying attention to what they should, unarisen defilements don’t arise and arisen defilements are given up
> 
> Some defilements should be given up by seeing, some by restraint, some by using, some by enduring, some by avoiding, some by dispelling, and some by developing.
The things that, when attention is paid to them, do not give rise to unarisen defilements and give up arisen defilements; the defilements of sensual desire, desire to be reborn, and ignorance
