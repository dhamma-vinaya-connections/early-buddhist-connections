# MN63 - Cūḷamālukya Sutta - Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkya
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A monk demands that the Buddha  answer his metaphysical questions, or else he will disrobe. The Buddha  compares him to a man struck by an arrow, who refuses treatment until he can have all his questions about the arrow and the archer answered
Ven. Malunkyaputta threatens to disrobe unless the Buddha  answers all his speculative metaphysical questions. Using the famous simile of a man shot by a poison arrow, the Buddha  reminds him that some questions are simply not worth asking

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Because they are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. 
When there are any of these views there is rebirth, there is old age, there is death, and there is sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. And It is the defeat of these things in this very life that I advocate
> 
> I have declared the following: ‘this is suffering,’ ‘this is the origin of suffering,’ ‘this is the cessation of suffering,’ ‘this is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
I have not declared the following: ‘the world is eternal,’‘the world is not eternal,’ ‘the world is finite,’ ‘the world is infinite,’ ‘the soul and the body are the same thing,’ ‘the soul and the body are different things,’ ‘a realized one exists after death,’ ‘a realized one doesn’t exist after death,’ ‘a realized one both exists and doesn’t exist after death,’ ‘a realized one neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death
