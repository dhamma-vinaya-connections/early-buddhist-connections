# MN41 - Sāleyyaka Sutta - People of Sālā
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  explains to a group of brahmins the conduct leading to rebirth in higher or lower states, including detailed explanations of the ten core practices which lay people should undertake, and which also form the basis for liberation

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A discussion of ten types of skillful and unskillful conduct in body, speech, and mind, and of the future rewards open to those who follow the guidelines to skillful conduct
A person of principled and moral conduct might wish: to be reborn in a good place or heaven it’s possible that this might happen
> 
> Principled and moral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. It is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind
There is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There is obligation to mother and father. There are beings reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are well attained and practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight
