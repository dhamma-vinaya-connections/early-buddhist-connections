# MN39 - Mahāassapura Sutta - Discourse at Assapura Longer
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  encourages the mendicants to live up to their name, by actually practicing in a way that meets or exceeds the expectations people have for renunciants
The Buddha  outlines the full course of training by which a meditator may earn the right to call him- or herself a true contemplative.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> I declare to you: you who seek the recluse’s status, do not fall short of the goal of recluseship while there is more to be done.
Should train like this: ‘we will undertake and follow the things that make one an ascetic and a brahmin. That way our label will be accurate and our claim correct
> 
> We won’t glorify ourselves or put others down on account of our pure bodily, verbally and mental behavior.
The training begins with conscience and concern for the results of one's actions, and leads progressively through the cultivation of virtue, sense-restraint, moderation, wakefulness, mindfulness, alertness, abandon hindrances, four jhanas, finally culminating in the realization of the 3 knowledges
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Similes of abandoning the 5 hindrances, the 4 jhanas and 3 knowledges
Abandon hindrances feel like: pay off debts, recover from illness, released from jail, freed from servitude, crossed over the desert, safe and sound.      and jhanas similes
