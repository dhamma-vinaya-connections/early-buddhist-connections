# MN70 - Kīṭāgiri Sutta - At Kīṭāgiri
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A third discourse that presents the health benefits of eating in one part of the day, and the reluctance of some mendicants to follow this.
A discourse on the importance of conviction in the buddhist path. Not only is conviction a prerequisite for listening to the Buddha 's teachings with respect, but — as is shown by the unusual discussion here categorizing the types of noble disciples — it can underlie the practice all the way to the deathless.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Reasons to give up what is visible in the present to chase after what takes effect over time
 freed both ways, one freed by wisdom don’t have work to do with diligence if they are perfected, with defilements ended
Enlightenment is achieved right away. 
Rather, enlightenment is achieved by gradual training, progress, and practice
> 
> Give up pleasurable, painful, or neutral feeling that  unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline, and enter & remain in pleasurable, painful, or neutral feeling that unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow
A personal witness, one attained to view, one freed by faith, a follower of the teachings, and a follower by faith, still have work to do with diligence if they are trainees, who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary
Someone in whom faith has arisen approaches a teacher. They pay homage, lend an ear, hear the teachings, remember the teachings, reflect on their meaning, and accept them after consideration. Then enthusiasm springs up; they make an effort, weigh up, and persevere. Persevering, they directly realize the ultimate truth, and see it with penetrating wisdom
