# MN9 - Sammaditthi Sutta - Right View
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> How the four noble truths, dependent co-arising, and the knowledge that ends mental fermentation all build upon the basic dichotomy between skillful and unskillful action.
Venerable Sāriputta gives a detailed explanation of right view, the first factor of the noble eightfold path. At the prompting of the other mendicants, he approaches the topic from a wide range of perspectives.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Skillful & unskillful qualities and their roots
Different ways to describe a noble disciple who has right view, experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching
4 noble truths applied to fuel
4 noble truths
4 noble truths applied to each factor of dependent origination
> 
> Skillful is ethics, contentment, good will, and right view; their roots are contentment, love, and wisdom. unskillful is the opposite and their roots are greed, hate, and delusion.
They’ve completely given up the underlying tendency to greed, to repulsion, and eradicated the conceit ‘I am’. They’ve given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, and make an end of suffering in this very life
4 fuels solid food, contact, mental intention and consciousness
Suffering, cause of suffering, cessation of suffering, the path leading to cessation of suffering
Defilements – ignorance - choices- conciousness- mind-body - 6 senses - contact - feelings - craving - grasping - continued existence - rebirth - old age and death - suffering
