# MN57 - Kukkuravatika Sutta - Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Some ascetics in ancient india undertook extreme practices, such as a vow to behave like an ox or a dog. The Buddha  meets two such individuals, and is reluctantly pressed to reveal the kammic outcomes of such practice
Act like a dog, and that's what you'll become. The moral: choose your actions with care.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> This is how a being is born from a being. 
For what you do brings about your rebirth, and when you’re reborn contacts affect you.This Is why I say that sentient beings are heirs to their deeds. 
Someone who develops the dog observance fully and uninterruptedly. They develop a dog’s ethics, a dog’s mentality, and a dog’s behavior
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of dogs
> 
> There are dark deeds with dark results;
Bright deeds with bright results;dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results; andneither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results, which lead to the ending of deeds.
But if they have such a view: ‘by this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!’ This is their wrong view. 
An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: hell or the animal realm
