# MN152 - Indriyabhāvanā Sutta - Development of the Faculties
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A brahmin teacher advocates that purification of the senses consists in simply avoiding seeing and hearing things. The Buddha  explains that it is not about avoiding sense experience, but understanding it and learning to not be affected by sense experience

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Supreme development of the faculties in the training of the noble one, the practicing trainee, and the noble one with developed faculties
> 
> When liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking come up: someone practicing develop & stabilize equanimity, practicing trainees are horrified & repelled, and noble ones perceive the unrepulsive in the repulsive, viseversa, or stay equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive
