# MN102 - Pañcattaya Sutta - Five and Three
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A middle length version of the more famous brahmajala sutta (dn1), this surveys a range of speculative views and dismisses them all

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> ‘all that is conditioned and coarse. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’ Understanding Thus and seeing the escape from it, the realized one has gone beyond all that.
The realized one has awakened to the supreme state of sublime peace, that is, liberation by not grasping after truly understanding these six sense fields’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape
> 
> Ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the future, and assert various hypotheses concerning the future. they assert an existent self that is sound after death; or they assert the annihilation of an existing being; or they propose extinguishment in the present life
They still grasp at theories about the past or the future, or the fetters of sensuality, or the rapture of seclusion, or spiritual bliss, or neutral feeling. And When they regard themselves like this: ‘I am at peace; I am extinguished; I am free of grasping,’ that’s also said to be grasping on their part
