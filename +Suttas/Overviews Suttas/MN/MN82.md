# MN82 - Raṭṭhapāla Sutta - With Raṭṭhapāla
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A wealthy young man, Raṭṭhapāla, has a strong aspiration to go forth, but has to prevail against the reluctance of his parents. Even after he became a monk, his parents tried to persuade him to disrobe. The discourse ends with a moving series of teachings on the fragility of the world
In the second part, he recalls the four observations about the world that inspired him, as a healthy and wealthy young man, to ordain in the first place

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A two-part story about the monk who, the Buddha  said, was foremost among his disciples in ordaining on the power of pure conviction. In the first part of the story, ratthapala deals with his parents' opposition to his ordaining, and their attempts, after ordination, to lure him back to lay life.
The world is unstable and swept away, the world has no shelter and no savior, the world has no owner—you must leave it all behind and pass on, the world is wanting, insatiable, the slave of craving
> 
> It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure,
I wish to  go forth from the lay life to homelessness, I will either die right here or go forth
Sensual pleasures are diverse, sweet, delightful; 
Appearing in disguise they disturb the mind. 
Seeing danger in the many kinds of sensual stimulation, 
Therefore wisdom’s much better than wealth, 
Since by wisdom you reach consummation in this life
