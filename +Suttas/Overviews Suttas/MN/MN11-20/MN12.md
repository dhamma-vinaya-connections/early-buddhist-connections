# MN12 - Mahāsīhanāda Sutta - Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  expounds the ten powers of a tathagata, his four kinds of intrepidity, and other superior qualities which entitle him to "roar his lion's roar in the assemblies.
Disrobed monk, sunakkhata, attacks the Buddha ’s teaching because it merely leads to the end of suffering. The Buddha  counters that this is, in fact, praise, and goes on to enumerate his many profound and powerful achievements.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> With these the Buddha  claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel
When their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place: hell where they experience exclusively painful feelings, animal realm where they experience painful feelings and the ghost realm where they experience many painful feelings
The Buddha  practiced a spiritual path consisting of four factors.
> 
> Blessed one wields the many kinds of psychic powers, the ten powers of a realized one,  has four kinds of self-assurance where the realized one approaches the eight assemblies, sees the four kinds of reproduction, he understands the 5 destinations and  the path and practice that leads to each one
 when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a good place: human beings where  they experience many pleasant feelings, a heavenly realm where they experience exclusively pleasant feelings or nibbana the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life
Ultimate self-mortifier,  the ultimate rough-liver, the ultimate one living in disgust at sin, in ultimate seclusion
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Hell like pit of coals, animal realm like a sewer full with feces, ghost realm like tree growing on rugged ground, human beings like  a tree growing on smooth ground, heaven realms like a stilt longhouse, nibbana like a lotus pond with clear, sweet, cool water
