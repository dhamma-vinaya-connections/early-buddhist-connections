# MN11 - Cūḷasīhanāda Sutta - Lion’s Roar Shorter Discourse
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  declares that only those following his path can genuinely experience the four stages of awakening. This is because, while much is shared with other systems, none of them go so far as to fully reject all attachment to the idea of a self
The Buddha  declares that only through practicing in accord with the Dhamma can awakening be realized. His teaching is distinguished from those of other religions and philosophies through its unique rejection of all doctrines of self

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Awakened person has given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, they don’t grasp at sensual pleasures, views, precepts and observances, or theories of a self. Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.
Only fully awakened Buddha  claims to propound the complete understanding and expound all kinds of grasping, which are sensual pleasures, views, precepts and observances, and theories of a self.
> 
> Wise beings are those who truly understand views favoring & ending continued existence, their origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. They’re rid of greed, hate, delusion, craving, grasping, and ignorance. They don’t favor and oppose, and they enjoy non-proliferation, they are freed from suffering
The source, of grasping is
Craving, then is feeling, its sources is contact, its source are six sense fields, their sources are name and form, their sources are consciousness, its source is choices, and its source is  ignorance
