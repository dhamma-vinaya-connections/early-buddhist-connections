# MN75 - Māgaṇḍiya Sutta - Māgaṇḍiya
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Accused by a hedonist of being too negative, the Buddha  recounts the luxury of his upbringing, and his realization of how little value there was in such things. Through renunciation he found a far greater pleasure
In this passage, the Buddha  teaches a member of a hedonist sect about the nature of true pleasure and true health

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The eye like sights, ear likes sounds … The nose likes smells … The tongue likes tastes … The body likes touches … The mind likes thoughts
Because there is a satisfaction that is apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, which even achieves the level of heavenly pleasure. Enjoying that satisfaction, I don’t envy what is inferior, nor do I hope to enjoy it
having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of senses, and having given up craving and dispelled passion for them they would live rid of thirst, their mind peaceful inside
> 
> That’s been tamed, guarded, protected and restrained by the Realized One, and he teaches Dhamma for its restraint
 The more they indulge in sensual pleasures, the more their craving for sensual pleasures grows, and the more they burn with passion for sensual pleasures. But still, they derive a degree of pleasure and gratification from the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
Not knowing health and not seeing extinguishment, they still recite this verse: ‘Health is the ultimate blessing; extinguishment, the ultimate happiness
