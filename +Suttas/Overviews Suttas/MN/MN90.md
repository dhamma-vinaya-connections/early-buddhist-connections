# MN90 - Kaṇṇakatthala Sutta - At Kaṇṇakatthala
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> King pasenadi questions the Buddha  on miscellaneous matters: caste, omniscience, and the gods among them

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> If they had these five factors that support meditation,that would be for their lasting welfare and happiness
There are these four classes: aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers. If They had these five factors that support meditation, and if they practiced rightly,would there be any difference between them
> 
> There are things that must be attained by someone with faith, health, integrity, energy, and wisdom. It’s not possible for a faithless, unhealthy, deceitful, lazy, witless person to attain them.
When fire has been kindled by energy and produced by effort, I say that there is no difference between the freedom of one and the freedom of the other
