# MN43 - Mahāvedalla Sutta - Classification Great
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A series of questions and answers between Sāriputta and mahākoṭṭhita, examining various subtle and abstruse aspects of the teachings
Ven. Sariputta answers questions dealing with discernment, right view, and the higher meditative attainments

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> You understand what you cognize, and you cognize what you understand. 
That’s why these things are mixed, not separate
For you perceive what you feel, and you cognize what you perceive. 
That’s why these things are mixed, not separate
The purpose of wisdom is direct knowledge, complete understanding, and giving up
There are two conditions for the arising of right view: 
The words of another and proper attention
First absorption has five factors. When A bhikkhu  has entered the first absorption, placing the mind, keeping it connected, rapture, bliss, and unification of mind are present
This body must lose three things before it lies forsaken, tossed aside like an insentient log: vitality, warmth, and consciousness
Unshakable heart’s release is empty of greed, hate, and delusion.
> 
> The difference between these things is that wisdom should be developed, while consciousness should be completely understood
It’s called feeling because it feels pleasure, pain, and neutral. It’s called perception because it perceives blue, yellow, red, and white
Purified mind consciousness released from the five senses can be aware that ‘space is infinite’ it can know the dimension of infinite space. Aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’ it can know the dimension of infinite consciousness. Aware that ‘there is nothing at all’ it can know the dimension of nothingness
When right view is supported by five factors it has freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom as its fruit and benefit. 
It’s when right view is supported by ethics, learning, discussion, serenity, and insight
First absorption has given up five factors sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt are given up.
Life depends on warmth to continue, and warmth depends on life to continue
Limitless heart’s release, and the heart’s release through nothingness, and the heart’s release through emptiness, and the signless heart’s release
