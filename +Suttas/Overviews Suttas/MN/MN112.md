# MN112 - Chabbisodhana Sutta - Sixfold Purification
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> If someone claims to be awakened, their claim should be interrogated with a detailed series of detailed questions. Only if they can answer them clearly should the claim be accepted

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> An enlightened person live without attraction or repulsion for what is seen, heard … thought … or know; independent, untied, liberated, detached, my mind free of limits
Not taken the earth, water, fire, air, space nor consciousness  element as self, nor is there a self based on the  element. And I understand that my mind is freed through the ending, fading away, cessation, giving away, and letting go of attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency based on the elements
Practice to know and see so that he has eradicated ego, possessiveness, and underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli
> 
> An Arahant knowing that form, feeling … perception … choices …consciousness is powerless, fading, and unreliable, I understand that my mind is freed through the ending, fading away, cessation, giving away, and letting go of attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency for these grasping aggregates
An Arahant understand that my mind is freed through the ending, fading away, cessation, giving away, and letting go of desire and greed and relishing and craving; attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency for the six interior and exterior sense fields and their consciousness. Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance
Noble spectrum of ethics, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness, contentment, gave up these five hindrances, 4 jhanas,  . When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements
