Happiness, sadness & equanimity  of each senses
Laypeople and renunciate happiness, sadness & equanimity  of each senses
Relying on renunciates positions give up laypeople, then on happiness give up sadness, then on equanimity give up happiness, then on unity, and finally rely on non-identification
Whether his students follow him or not
Having physical form, they see visions, not perceiving physical form internally, they see visions externally, focused only on beauty, dimension of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, neither perception nor non-perception, the cessation of perception and feeling
