# MN26 - Pāsarāsi Sutta - Noble Search
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> This is one of the most important biographical discourses, telling the Buddha ’s experiences from leaving home to realizing awakening. Throughout, he was driven by the imperative to fully escape from rebirth and suffering
Most of us spend a good part of our lives looking for happiness in all the wrong places. In this sutta the Buddha  recounts the story of his own search and points out where a true and lasting happiness can be found

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Ignoble search is when someone who is themselves liable to be reborn seeks what is also liable to be reborn, to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, they seek what is also liable to these things. And noble search is understanding the drawbacks in these things, they seek the unaging, unailing, undying, sorrowless, uncorrupted supreme sanctuary, nibbana
I approached āḷāra kālāma and uddaka, son of rāma. I quickly memorized those teaching and with faith, energy, mindfulness, samadhi , and wisdom and  I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight
This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of reason, subtle, comprehensible to the astute
Sir, let the blessed one teach the dhamma! Let the holy one teach the dhamma! 
There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.There Will be those who understand the teaching!
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the 9 jhanas
> 
> Partners and children, male and female bondservants,  cattle, and gold and money are liable to corruption. These Attachments are liable to corruption. Someone Who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things themselves liable to corruption
This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment
 people like attachment, they love it and enjoy it. 
It’s hard for them to see this thing; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishmen
I have achieved the deathless! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the dhamma. 
By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life
Ascetics and brahmins who enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation tied, infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, and not understanding the escape. You should understand that they have met with calamity and disaster, and are vulnerable to the wicked one
