# MN76 - Sandaka Sutta - With Sandaka
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Venerable Ānanda teaches a group of wanderers how there are many different approaches to the spiritual life, many of which lead nowhere

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Unworthy talks
Four ways that negate the spiritual life
Four kinds of unreliable spiritual life
 a teacher say and explain so that a sensible person would, to the best of their ability, practice such a spiritual path, and once practicing it, they would complete the procedure of the skillful teaching
Arahant can’t transgress in five respects
Both the foolish and the astute are annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, no outcome of evil nor merits, there is no cause or condition for the corruption nor purification of sentient beings, and transmigration lasts only for a limited period, so there’s no increase or decrease, no getting better or worse
This teacher makes a claim to be all-knowing and all-seeing, but when encounters  problems he says he had to encounters them, 2nd a teacher who takes oral transmission to be the truth but some of that is well learned, some poorly learned, some true, and some otherwise
A sensible person would, to the best of their ability live the spiritual life under a teacher who achieves such a high distinction, and, once practicing it, they would complete the procedure of the skillful teaching.
Someone with defilements ended can’t deliberately take the life of a living creature, take something with the intention to steal, have sex, tell a deliberate lie, or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they did as a lay person
> 
> Politics, war, food, drinks, clothes, garland, family, vehicles, cities, travel, women, gossips, departed, motley, and states of rebirth
Nihilism, no merits nor outcome of evil deeds, no cause or condition for the corruption or purification  of sentient beings, pleasure and pain are allotted & transmigration lasts only for a limited period
 Teacher who claims to be all-knowing but encounters misfortune, based only on oral transmission, teacher who relies on logic and inquiry, teacher who is dull and stupid he resorts to evasiveness
Can’t deliberately take the life of a living creature, take something with the intention to steal, have sex, tell a deliberate lie, or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they did as a lay person
Sensible person reflects both I who have not accomplished this and one who has accomplished ithave attained exactly the same level, but it’s superfluous for this teacher to go naked, shaven, persisting in squatting, tearing out their hair and beard. Yet I’ll have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacher. This negates the spiritual life
3rd but when a teacher relies on logic and inquiry, some of that is well reasoned, some poorly reasoned, some true, and some otherwiseand 4rd teacher is dull and stupid, that resorts to evasiveness and equivocation
Gradual training abbreviated 
The knowledge and vision that their defilements are ended is not constantly and continually present to them, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.Rather, they are aware of it only when they checked it.
