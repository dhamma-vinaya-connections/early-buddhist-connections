## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Drawing parallels with a cowherd guiding his herd across a dangerous river, the Buddha  presents the various kinds of enlightened disciples who cross the stream of transmigration

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The Buddha  urges his monks to cross over to the lasting safety of nibbana, showing that anyone who listen to and trust him, it will be for their lasting welfare and happiness
> 
> Arahants ended the defilements, non-returners ending of the five lower fetters, ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, are once-returners, ending of three fetters are stream-enterers,  followers by faith will safely cross over to the far shore.
