# MN40 - Cūḷaassapura Sutta - Discourse at Assapura Shorter
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The labels of being a spiritual practitioner don’t just come from external trappings, but from sincere inner change.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Ascetics purified from all unskillful qualities become   joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil, then they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.
> 
> The proper way of practice is to give up covetousness, ill will, irritability, hostility, offensiveness, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deviousness, deceit, bad desires, and wrong view, and spread the heart full of love, compassion, rejoice and equanimity
> 

> [!info] Similes
> A thirsty person coming to a pond with clear, cool water, like an ascetic arrived at the teaching and training proclaimed by the Buddha
