# MN17 - Vanapattha Sutta - Jungle Thickets
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> While living in the wilderness is great, not everyone is ready for it. The Buddha  encourages meditators to reflect on whether one’s environment is genuinely supporting their meditation practice, and if not, to leave.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Selecting the right environment depends on our improvement on the path and not how easy we get support
> 
> One should  reflect: while living here, my mindfulness becomes established, my mind becomes immersed in samādhi, their defilements come to an end, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary. no progress and requisites are scarce = depart;
 No progress and requisites are plentiful = depart;
 Progress and requisites are scarce = stay;
 Progress and requisites are plentiful = stay.
