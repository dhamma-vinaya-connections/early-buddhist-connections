# MN131 - Bhaddekaratta Sutta - An Auspicious Day
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> In this stirring discourse the Buddha  underscores the vital urgency of keeping one's attention firmly rooted in the present moment. After all, the past is gone, the future isn't here; this present moment is all we have.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Don’t run back to the past,  don’t hope for the future. 
What’s past is left behind; 
The future has not arrived;
And phenomena in the present are clearly seen in every case. 
Knowing this, foster it—
Unfaltering, unshakable.
Today’s the day to keenly work, who knows, tomorrow may bring death!
> 
> One is unshakable in the present when he don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form, perceptions, conciousness, feelings nor choices, any of the 5 aggregates
