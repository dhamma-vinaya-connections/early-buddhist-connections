# MN123 - Acchariyaabbhuta Sutta - Incredible and Amazing
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Venerable Ananda is invited by the Buddha  to speak on the Buddha ’s amazing qualities, and proceeds to list a series of apparently miraculous events accompanying his birth. The Buddha  caps it off by explaining what he thinks is really amazing about himself

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The realized one knows feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. He Knows perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. He Knows thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away
> 
> When the being intent on awakening passes away from the host of joyful gods, he is conceived in his mother’s womb, a magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods, ‘as soon as he’s born, the being intent on awakening stands firm with his own feet on the ground and makes this dramatic statement: “I am the foremost in the world! I am the eldest in the world! I am the best in the world! This is my last rebirth. Now there are no more future lives
