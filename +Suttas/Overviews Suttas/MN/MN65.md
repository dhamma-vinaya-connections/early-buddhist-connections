# MN65 - Bhaddāli Sutta - With Bhaddāli
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A monk refuses to follow the rule forbidding eating after noon, but is filled with remorse and forgiven

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. 
For it is growth in the training of the noble one to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.
 take a mendicant who does fulfill the training according to the teacher’s instructions, while they’re living withdrawn, they’re not reprimanded by the teacher, by sensible spiritual companions after examination, by deities, or by themselves
Take some other monk who gets by with mere faith and love. In Such a case, the monks say: ‘reverends, this monk gets by with mere faith and love. If We punish him, repeatedly pressuring him—no, let him not lose what little faith and love he has
When sentient beings are in decline and the true teaching is disappearing there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicants
Because it has not done this before, it still resorts to some tricks, dodges, and evasions. But With regular and gradual practice it quells that bad habit.
> 
> I made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me that, as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha  and the saṅgha was undertaking it, I announced I would not try to keep it. 
Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future
 being reprimanded in this way, they realize the 4 jhanas and the 3 knowledges, knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. 
When they’re freed, they know they’re freed
Take a monk who is a frequent offender
When admonished by the monks, he dodges the issue. He displays annoyance, hate, and bitterness. He doesn’t proceed properly, he doesn’t fall in line, he doesn’t proceed to get past it, and he doesn’t say: ‘I’ll do what pleases the saṅgha.’ In Such a case the venerables to examine this monk in such a way that this disciplinary issue is not quickly settled
Defiling influences appear in the saṅgha when it has attained a great size, an abundance of material support and fame, learning, and seniority
When a mendicant has an adept’s right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right immersion, right knowledge, and right freedom. 
A mendicant with these ten factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation
