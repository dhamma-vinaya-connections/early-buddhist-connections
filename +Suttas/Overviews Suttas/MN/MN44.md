# MN44 - Cūḷavedalla Sutta - Classification Shorter
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The layman visākha asks the nun dhammadinnā about various difficult matters, including some of the highest meditation attainments. The Buddha  fully endorses her answers.
Dhammadinna the nun fields a series of Dhamma questions put to her by her former husband: questions on self-identification, cessation, penetration into the true nature of feeling, and the attainment of nibbana.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> These five grasping aggregates are identity. 
That is: form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness
Breathing is a physical process. Placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes. Perception and feeling are mental processes.
Verbal processes cease first, then physical, then mental
Anything felt physically or mentally as pleasant or enjoyable. This Is pleasant feeling. Anything Felt physically or mentally as painful or unpleasant. This Is painful feeling. Anything Felt physically or mentally as neither pleasurable nor painful. This Is neutral feeling
The underlying tendency for greed underlies pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency for repulsion underlies painful feeling. The underlying tendency for ignorance underlies neutral feeling
> 
> The origin of identity is the craving that leads to future rebirth, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking pleasure in various different realms. the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not adhering to it is the cessation of identity
Unification of the mind is samadhi.  The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the foundations of samadhi  the four right efforts are the prerequisites for samadhi . The Cultivation, development, and making much of these very same things is the development of samadhi
To attain the cessation of perception and feeling one does not think: ‘I will enter ’ or ‘I am entering or ‘I have entered the cessation of perception and feeling.’ Rather, their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state
Pleasant feeling is pleasant when it remains and painful when it perishes. 
Painful feeling is painful when it remains and pleasant when it perishes.Neutral Feeling is pleasant when there is knowledge, and painful when there is ignorance
With first jhana one he abandons passion, nursing yearning for the unexcelled liberations, there arises within him sorrow based on that yearning. With that he abandons resistance, and with four jhana one  abandons ignorance
