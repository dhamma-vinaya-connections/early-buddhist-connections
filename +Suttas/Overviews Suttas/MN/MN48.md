## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Despite the Buddha ’s presence, the monks of kosambi fell into a deep and bitter dispute. The Buddha  taught the reluctant monks to develop love and harmony, reminding them of the state of peace that they sought

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Six warm-hearted qualities make for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.
One accomplished in view that is noble and emancipating lead one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering has 7 knowledges
> 
> Treats their spiritual companions with bodily, verbal & mental kindness, both in public and in private, shares without reservation any material possessions, lives according to the precepts, and lives according to the view shared with their spiritual companions
1‘there is no obsession unabandoned in myself, 2 when I develop this view I gain serenity and quenching, 3 nobody outside of the buddhist community have the same kind of view, 4 though they may still fall into offense they quickly reveal it and restrain themselves in the future, 5 feel a keen regard for the training in higher ethics, higher mind, and higher wisdom, 6 when the Dhamma is taught, they engage wholeheartedly, 7 they find joy in the meaning and the teaching
