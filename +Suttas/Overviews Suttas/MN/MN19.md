# MN19 - Dvedhāvitakka Sutta - Two Kinds of Thought
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  recounts the events leading up to his awakening, and describes his discovery that thoughts connected with sensuality, ill-will, and harmfulness do not lead one to awakening, while those connected with their opposites (renunciation, non ill-will, and harmlessness) do.
Recounting his own experiences in developing meditation, the Buddha  explains how to understand harmful and harmless thoughts, and how to go beyond thought altogether

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Separate wholesome to be encouraged from unwholesome thoughts to be remove
in accordance with what one intends, in accordance with what one thinks, the mind takes delight in that
> 
> If they often think about and consider thoughts of renunciation, non ill-will, and harmless, they’ve given up sensuality, ill-will, and harmfulnes
With energy roused up and unflagging, mindfulness is established and lucid, the body is tranquil and undisturbed, and the mind is immersed in samādhi in 4 jhanas
