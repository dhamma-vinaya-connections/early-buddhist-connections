# MN5 - Anaṅgaṇa Sutta - Unblemished
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha ’s chief disciples, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, use a simile of a tarnished bowl to illustrate the blemishes of the mind and conduct. They emphasize how the crucial thing is not so much whether there are blemishes, but whether we are aware of them
The Buddha ’s chief disciples, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, use a simile of a tarnished bowl to illustrate the blemishes of the mind and conduct. They emphasize how the crucial thing is not so much whether there are blemishes, but whether we are aware of them

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Blemish’ is a term for the spheres of bad, unskillful wishes and when their wishes are not fulfill anger and that bitterness are both blemishes.
Who doesn’t have a blemish and does understand it. You can expect that they won’t focus on the feature of beauty, and because of that, lust won’t infect their mind. 
Who doesn’t have a blemish and doesn't understand it won't make effort to guard his mind.
> 
> Person who has a blemish and does not understand it. You can expect that they won’t make an effort to give up that blemish. 
Person who has a blemish and does understand it will make an effort to get rid of them.
Gentlemen who went forth out of faith. They’re not devious, deceitful, and sneaky, restless, insolent, fickle, gossipy, and loose-tongued. They guard their sense doors and eat in moderation, and they are dedicated to wakefulness. They care about the ascetic life, and keenly respect the training. They’re not indulgent or slack, nor are they leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion. They’re energetic and determined. They’re mindful, with situational awareness, immersion, and unified minds; wise, not stupid.
