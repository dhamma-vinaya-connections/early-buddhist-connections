# MN21 - Kakacūpama Sutta - Simile of the Saw
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  tells the story of a wise slave who deliberately tests her mistress's patience. The Buddha  invokes several memorable similes here to illustrate the correct way to develop patience.
A discourse full of vibrant and memorable similes, on the importance of patience and love even when faced with abuse and criticism. The Buddha  finishes with the simile of the saw, one of the most memorable similes found in the discourses

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Give up what’s unskillful and devote yourselves to skillful qualities so you’ll achieve growth, improvement, and maturity in this teaching and training
there are five ways of speaking82 Another person’s speech may 
be timely or untimely, truthful or untruthful, gentle or harsh, kindly or 
angry, meaningful or trivial
Develop love, compassion & equanimity when being criticized, even if someone strikes you with fists or weapons or even if bandits were to sever you limb from limb
> 
> Be easy to admonish purely because we honor, respect, and venerate the teaching
When someone speaks in any of these five ways, if your mind changes 
or your mouth says something bad, then I say that because of that you are 
definitely in decline
Our minds will remain unaffected. We will blurt out no bad words. We will remain full of compassion, with a heart of love and no secret hate. We Will meditate spreading a heart of love to that person. And with them as a basis, we will meditate spreading a heart full of love to everyone in the world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will
