# MN101 - Devadaha Sutta - At Devadaha
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  tackles a group of jain ascetics, pressing them on their claim to be practicing to end all suffering by self-mortification. He points out a series of fallacies in their logic, and explains his own middle way
The Buddha  refutes a jain theory of kamma, which claims that one's present experience is determined solely by one's actions in past lives, and that the effects of past unskillful actions can be "burned away" through austerity practices. The Buddha  here outlines one of his most important teachings on kamma: that it is both the results of past deeds and present actions that shape one's experience of the present. It is precisely this interaction of present and past that opens up the very possibility of awakening

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> I did not see any legitimate defense of their doctrine from the jains so deserve rebuke and criticism on ten legitimate grounds. That’s How exertion and striving is fruitless.
They understand:‘when I actively strive I become dispassionate towards this source of suffering. But when I develop equanimity I become dispassionate towards this other source of suffering.’ So They either actively strive or develop equanimity as appropriate, and so that suffering is worn away
And how is exertion and striving fruitful? It’s When a mendicant doesn’t bring suffering upon themselves; and they don’t give up legitimate pleasure, but they’re not besotted with that pleasure
> 
> These five things can be seen to turn out in two different ways. Faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, and acceptance of a view after consideration
But when I strive painfully, unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow. Why Don’t I strive painfully?’ So That’s what they do, and as they do so unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow. After Some time, they no longer strive painfully. Why Is that? Because They have accomplished the goal for which they strived painfully
When they have this noble spectrum of ethics, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness, contentment, they give up these five hindrances, enter in 4 jhanas, obtain 3 knowledges, knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. When They’re freed, they know they’re freed.
