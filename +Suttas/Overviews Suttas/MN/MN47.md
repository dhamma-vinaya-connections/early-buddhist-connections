# MN47 - Vīmaṃsaka Sutta - Inquirer
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> While some spiritual teachers prefer to remain in obscurity, the Buddha  not only encouraged his followers to closely investigate him, but gave them a detailed and demanding method to do so

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> One who is an inquirer, unable to comprehend another’s mind, should scrutinize the realized one to see whether he is a fully awakened Buddha  or not
 I approached the Buddha to listen to the teaching. He explained Dhamma with its higher and higher stages, with its better and better stages, with its dark and bright sides. When I directly knew a certain principle of those teachings, in accordance with how I was taught, I came to a conclusion about the teachings. I had confidence in the Teacher

When someone’s faith is settled, rooted, and planted in the Realized One in this manner, with these words and phrases, it’s said to be grounded faith that’s based on evidence.
