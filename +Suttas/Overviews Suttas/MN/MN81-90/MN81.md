# MN81 - Ghaṭikāra Sutta - With Ghaṭikāra
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  relates an unusual account of a past life in the time of the previous Buddha , Kassapa. At that time he was not interested in dhamma, and had to be forced to go see the Buddha . This discourse is important in understanding the development of the bodhisattva doctrine

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Kassapa’s refusal to accept the invitation upset the king and prompted him to inquire 
if Kassapa Buddha had a better supporter.30 Kassapa confirmed that this was the case  and told the king that his supporter was the potter Gha?īkāra
> 
> Has gone for refuge to the Buddha , the teaching, and the saṅgha. 
He doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. He Has experiential confidence in the Buddha , the teaching, and the saṅgha, and has the ethics loved by the noble ones. He Is free of doubt regarding suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation
