# MN85 - Bodhirājakumāra Sutta - With Prince Bodhi
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Admitting that he used to believe that pleasure was to be gained through pain, the Buddha  explains how his practice showed him the fallacy of that idea

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> History of the steps the Buddha  took since he gone forth and set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. same as mn 36
Don't be afraid of jhanas  pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities. same as mn 36
Mendicant with these five factors that support meditation has the realized one as trainer, they could  realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in seven years or less.
> 
> Approached, learn & memorize from āḷāra kālāma who thought the dimension of nothingness, approached uddaka, son of rāma who thought him the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, tortured mind with mind, breathless absorption, cutting off food, and then turn to the 4 jhanas and 3 knowledges
Experienced painful, feelings due to overexertion,  the Buddha  did not achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision, because his body was disturbed
Faith in the realized one’s awakening, they are rarely ill or unwell,
They’re not devious or deceitful,
They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities,
They’re wise
