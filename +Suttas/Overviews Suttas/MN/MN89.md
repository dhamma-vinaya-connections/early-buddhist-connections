> [!info] Summary
> King pasenadi, near the end of his life, visits the Buddha , and shows moving devotion and love for his teacher

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Blessed one is a fully awakened Buddha . The teaching is well explained. The saṅgha is practicing well
> 
> The bhikkhus areleading the spiritual life entirely full and pure as long as they live; living in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling; always smiling and joyful, obviously happy, with cheerful faces, living relaxed, unruffled, surviving on charity, their hearts free as a wild deer; while the Buddha  is teaching an assembly of many hundreds, and there is no sound of his disciples coughing.  I Don’t see any other assembly elsewhere so well trained
