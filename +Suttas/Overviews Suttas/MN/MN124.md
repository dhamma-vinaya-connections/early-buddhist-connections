# MN124 - Bākula Sutta - With Bakkula
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Venerable Bakkula, regarded as the healthiest of the mendicants, explains to an old friend his strict and austere practice. The unusual form of this discourse suggests it was added to the canon some time after the Buddha ’s death

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> In these eighty years, I don’t recall that any perceptions or thought of sensuality … ill will … or cruelty has ever arisen in me. for seven days I ate the nation’s alms-food as a debtor. Then On the eighth day I became enlightened
> 
> I don’t recall accepting a robe from a householder, accepting an invitation, sitting down inside a house, getting caught up in the details of female’s appearance, teaching a female, even so much as a four line verse … going to the nuns’ quarters,  dependence … being looked after by a novice … bathing in the sauna …bathing with bath powder, being ill, being presented with medicine,  leaning on a headrest …preparing a cot, commencing the rainy season residence in the neighborhood of a village
