# MN60 - Apaṇṇaka Sutta - Guaranteed
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  teaches a group of uncommitted householders how to use a rational reflection to arrive at practices and principles that are guaranteed to have a good outcome, even if we don’t know all the variables
The Buddha  explains to a group of householders how to navigate skillfully through the maze of wrong views.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Those who don’t see that unskillful qualities are full of drawbacks, sordidness, and corruption, or that skillful qualities have the benefit and cleansing power of renunciation.
Wrong view gives rise to these many bad, unskillful qualities—wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, contradicting the noble ones, convincing others to accept untrue teachings, and glorifying oneself and putting others down.
 do a bad deed when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie, evil comes of that, and an outcome of evil
There actually is another world, action actually does have an effect, there are totally formless states
Without knowing or seeing, it would not be appropriate for me to take one side and declare, 
‘this is the only truth, other ideas are silly, but reflecting wisely, they simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding forms.
Mortifies themselves, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves.
One person mortifies others, committed to the practice of mortifying others.One Person mortifies themselves and others, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others.
They live without wishes in the present life, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, having become holy in themselves
> 
> Who have this doctrine and view: 
‘there’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no obligation to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.  undertake and implement bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind.
That individual with wrong views is criticized by sensible people in the present life as being an immoral individual of wrong view and also  after death, they will be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell
Giving and sacrificing and encouraging others to do the same, merit comes of that, and an outcome of merit. 
In giving, self-control, restraint, and truthfulness there is merit and outcome of merit.’
Sentient beings are corrupted with cause and reason. 
There is a cause and condition for the purification of sentient beings. Sentient Beings are purified with cause and reason. There Is power, energy, manly strength and vigor. It Is not the case that all sentient beings, all living creatures, all beings, all souls lack control, power, and energy, or that, molded by destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of rebirth
It is possible 
That I will be guaranteed rebirth among the gods who are formless and made of perception. Now, owing to form, bad things are seen: taking up the rod and the sword, quarrels, arguments, and fights, accusations, divisive speech, and lies. But Those things don’t exist where it is totally formless
One person doesn’t mortify either themselves or others, committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others.
