## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation, thinking and considering in line with that. They associate with that kind of person, and they find it satisfying
Mendicant practices restraint regarding the six fields of contact.Understanding That attachment is the root of suffering, they are freed with the ending of attachments.
> 
> Individual may be intent on material pleasures, on the imperturbable, on the dimension of nothingnes, on the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, rightly intent on extinguishment. for they’re detached from things they wouldn’t engage in things unconducive to extinguishment 
Craving is a dart; and that the poison of ignorance is inflicted by desire and ill will. I Have given up the dart of craving and expelled the poison of ignorance; I am rightly intent on extinguishment
