# MN68 - Naḷakapāna Sutta - At Naḷakapāna
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Those who practice do so not because they are failures, but because they aspire to higher freedom. When he speaks of the attainments of disciples, the Buddha  does so in order to inspire

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Thinking: ‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering. Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering
The realized one has given up the defilements, the corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death. That’s Why, after reflection, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things
> 
> Someone who does achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that. 
The realized one does not declare rebirth of his disciples who have passed away for the sake of deceiving people or flattering them, nor for the benefit of possessions, honor, or popularity. Rather, there are gentlemen of faith who are full of sublime joy and gladness. When They hear that, recollecting that monk’s faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom, he applies his mind to that end. That’s How a monk lives at ease
