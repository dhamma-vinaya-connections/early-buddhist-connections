# THIG16 - Mahānipātavagga - Great Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> I seek the joy of Nirvana,
as all states of existence - even divine - are temporary.
Sensual pleasures are worthless without fail:
they bring little satisfaction, and much distress.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Knowing about the deathless,
why would you set yourself on fire with sensual pleasures?
For all delight in sensual pleasures
is burning, boiling, trembling, aglow
> 
> Attained by many,
the deathless state even today can be obtained in this way:
it is possible by whomever wisely commits themselves,
but not without striving.
