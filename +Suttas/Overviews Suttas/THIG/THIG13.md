# THIG13 - Vīsatinipātavagga - Twenties Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Shining hair, adorned with plaits of black and gold,
arranged in beautiful braids.
Because of old age my head has gone bald—
the truth-speaker’s words are never wrong.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The color of a jasmine bud,
my teeth were so splendid.
Because of old age they are broken and blackened—
the truth-speaker’s words are never wrong.
> 
> Such was this body,
now decrepit, an abode of much suffering,
a house of decrepitude fallen into disrepair—
the truth-speaker’s words are never wrong
>
