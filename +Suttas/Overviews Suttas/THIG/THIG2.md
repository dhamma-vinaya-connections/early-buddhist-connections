# THIG2 - Dukanipātavagga - Twos Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> I’m well freed, well freed,
so very well freed from the pestle!
My shameless husband popped up like a mushroom,
my mortar wafted like eels.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Greed and hate sizzle and hiss
as I plunge them (in cool water).
Having gone to the root of a tree,
I meditate happily, thinking: “Oh, what bliss!
> 
> Though subject to so many painful things,
I have, through my love of diligence,
reached the ending of craving,
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
