# THIG12 - Soḷasakanipātavagga - Sixteens Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Brahmin, the thing that you are afraid of,
when you always plunge into the water,
do not do that very thing,
don’t let the cold harm your skin

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Butchers of sheep and pigs,
fishermen, animal trappers,
bandits, executioners,
and others of evil deeds:
by ablution in water they too would be
released from their wicked deeds.
> 
> go for refuge to the Buddha, the poised,
to his teaching and to the Saṅgha.
Undertake the precepts,
that will be good for you
>
