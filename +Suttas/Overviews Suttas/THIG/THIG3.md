# THIG3 - Tikanipātavagga - Trees Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> In the twenty-five years
since I went forth,
I don’t know that I had ever found
serenity in my mind

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When I had heard her teaching,
in accordance with her instructions,
I sat cross-legged for seven days without moving,
given over to rapture and bliss.
On the eighth day I stretched out my feet,
having shattered the mass of darkness
> 
> I attain the meditations on emptiness
and signlessness whenever I want.
I am the Buddha’s rightful daughter,
always delighting in quenching
>
