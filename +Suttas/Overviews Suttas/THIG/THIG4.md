# THIG4 - Catukkanipātavagga - Fours Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Kassapa, son and heir of the Buddha,
has a well-collected mind.
He knows his past lives,
he sees heaven and hell.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> In the same way Bhaddā Kāpilānī
possesses the three knowledges, has left behind death,
and carries her last body,
having conquered Māra and his army.
> 
> Having seen the danger in the world,
we both went forth.
We have exhausted and tamed all the influences;
we have become cool and quenched.
