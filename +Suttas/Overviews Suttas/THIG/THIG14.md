# THIG14 - Tiṁsanipātavagga - Thirties Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Going to the lovely mango grove
of Jīvaka, the nun Subhā
was held up by a rascal.
Subhā said this to him:

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> One whose mind is sullied against one unsullied;
one who is lustful against one free of lust;
unblemished, my heart is freed in every respect,
so why do you stand in my way?
> 
> The pretty lady ripped out her eye.
With no attachment in her mind at all, she said:
“Come now, take this eye,”
and gave it to the man right then.
