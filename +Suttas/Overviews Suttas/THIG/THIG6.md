# THIG6 - Chakkanipātavagga - Sixes Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> One whose path you do not know,
not whence they came nor where they went;
though they came from who knows where,
you mourn that being, crying, ‘Oh my son!

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Departing with the form of a human,
he will go on transmigrating.
As he came, so he went:
why cry over that?”
> 
> Oh! For you have plucked the arrow from me,
so hard to see, stuck in the heart.
You’ve swept away the grief for my son,
in which I once was mired
>
