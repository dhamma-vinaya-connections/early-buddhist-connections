# THIG15 - Cattālīsanipātavagga - Forties Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> And my dad said to me:
‘May you attain awakening, the highest state,
and may you find the extinguishment
that was realized by the best of men

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> In the city of Erakacca
I was a goldsmith with lots of money.
Drunk on the pride of youth,
I had sex with someone else’s wife
> 
> I drew a big plow.
I shouldered a cart,
blind, tail-less, feeble,
because of adultery with another’s wife
>
