# THIG9 - Navakanipātavagga - Nines Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Vaḍḍha, the sages dwell easily,
carefree and free from doubt.
They have become cool and tamed,
and abide free from influences

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Vaḍḍha, not even the slightest thicket,
based on any conditions,
whether inferior, superior, or in the middle,
can be found in me

instructed by my mother,
I was met with a sense of urgency to practice the Dhamma
for the attainment of safety from bondage
