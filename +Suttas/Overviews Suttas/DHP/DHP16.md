# DHP16 - Piyavagga - Dear
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Applying yourself where you ought not, 
neglecting what you should be doing, 
forgetting your goal, you cling to what you hold dear, 
jealous of those devoted to their own goal

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Don’t ever get too close 
to those you like or dislike. 
For not seeing the liked is suffering, 
and so is seeing the disliked
> 
> Sorrow springs from desire, 
fear springs from desire; 
one free from desire 
has no sorrow, let alone fear
>
