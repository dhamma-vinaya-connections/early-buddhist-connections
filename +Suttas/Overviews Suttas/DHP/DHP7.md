# DHP7 - Arahantavagga - Perfected Ones
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> At journey’s end, rid of sorrow; 
everywhere free, 
all ties given up, 
no fever is found in them.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> One whose defilements have ended; 
who’s not attached to food; 
whose domain is the liberation 
of the signless and the empty
> 
> Whether in village or wilderness, 
in a valley or the uplands, 
wherever the perfected ones live 
is a delightful place
>
