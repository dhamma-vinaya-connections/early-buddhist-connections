# DHP22 - Nirayavagga - Hell
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> If something's to be done,
then work at it firmly,
for a slack going-forth
kicks up all the more dust

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A bad deed is better left undone, 
for it will plague you later on. 
A good deed is better done, 
one that does not plague you.
> 
> Like a frontier fortress,
guarded inside & out,
guard yourself.
Don't let the moment pass by.
Those for whom the moment is past
grieve, consigned to hell.
