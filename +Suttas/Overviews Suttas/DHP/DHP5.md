# DHP5 - Bālavagga - Fools
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> If while wandering you find no partner 
equal or better than yourself, 
then firmly resolve to wander alone—
there’s no fellowship with fools

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The fool who thinks they’re a fool 
is wise at least to that extent. 
But the true fool is said to be one 
who imagines that they are wise
> 
> The fool imagines that evil is sweet, 
so long as it has not yet ripened. 
But as soon as that evil ripens, 
they fall into suffering
>
