# DHP10 - Daṇḍavagga - Weapons
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> All tremble at the rod, 
all fear death. 
Treating others like oneself, 
neither kill nor incite to kill

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Creatures love happiness, 
so if you don’t hurt them with a stick 
in search of your own happiness, 
after death you will find happiness
> 
> Don’t speak harshly, 
they may speak harshly back. 
For aggressive speech is painful, 
and the rod may spring back on you
>
