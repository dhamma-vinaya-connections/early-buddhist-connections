# DHP26 - Brāhmaṇavagga - Brahmins
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Sitting silent, dustless,
absorbed in jhana,
his task done, effluents gone,
ultimate goal attained:
he's what I call
a brahman.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> He's called a brahman
for having banished his evil,
a contemplative
for living in consonance,
one gone forth
for having forsaken
his own impurities.
> 
> They understand for themselves 
the end of suffering in this life; 
with burden put down, detached: 
that’s who I call a brahmin
>
