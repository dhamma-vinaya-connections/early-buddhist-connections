# DHP18 - Malavagga - Stains
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A smart person would purge 
their own stains gradually, 
bit by bit, moment by moment, 
like a smith smelting silver

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> There's no fire like passion,
no seizure like anger,
no snare like delusion,
no river like craving.
> 
> If you focus on the errors of others,
constantly finding fault,
your effluents flourish.
You're far from their ending
>
