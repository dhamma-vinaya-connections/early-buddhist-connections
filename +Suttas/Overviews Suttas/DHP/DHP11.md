# DHP11 - Jarāvagga - Old Age
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> See this fancy puppet, 
a body built of sores, 
diseased, obsessed over, 
in which nothing lasts at all

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> This body is decrepit and frail, 
a nest of disease. 
This foul carcass falls apart, 
for life ends only in death
> 
> In this city built of bones, 
plastered with flesh and blood, 
old age and death are stashed away, 
along with conceit and contempt
>
