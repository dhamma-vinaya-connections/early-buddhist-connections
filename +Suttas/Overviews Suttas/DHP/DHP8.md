# DHP8 - Sahassavagga - Thousands
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Better than a thousand 
meaningless sayings 
is a single meaningful saying, 
hearing which brings you peace

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The supreme conqueror is 
not he who conquers a million men in battle, 
but he who conquers a single man:  himself
> 
> Better to live a single day 
ethical and absorbed in meditation 
than to live a hundred years 
unethical and lacking immersion.
