# DHP20 - Maggavagga - Path
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Of paths, the eightfold is the best; 
of truths, the four statements; 
dispassion is the best of things, 
and the Clear-eyed One is the best of humans

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> You yourselves must strive; the Buddhas only point the way. Those meditative ones who tread the path are released from the bonds of Mara
> 
> All conditions are impermanent—
suffering, not self, when this is seen with wisdom, 
one grows disillusioned with suffering: 
this is the path to purity
>
