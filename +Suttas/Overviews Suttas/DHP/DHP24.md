# DHP24 - Taṇhāvagga - Craving
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Whoever is beaten by this wretched craving, 
this attachment to the world, 
their sorrow grows, 
like grass in the rain

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A tree grows back even when cut down, 
so long as its roots are healthy; 
suffering springs up again and again, 
so long as the tendency to craving is not pulled out
> 
> But one who loves to calm their thoughts, 
developing perception of ugliness, ever mindful, 
will surely eliminate that craving, 
cutting off the bonds of Māra
>
