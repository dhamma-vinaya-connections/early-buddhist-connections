# DHP13 - Lokavagga - World
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Don’t resort to lowly things, 
don’t abide in negligence, 
don’t resort to wrong views, 
don’t perpetuate the world

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> He who once was heedless, 
but turned to heedfulness, 
lights up the world 
like the moon freed from clouds
> 
> The fruit of stream-entry is better 
than being the one king of the earth, 
than going to heaven, 
than lordship over all the world
