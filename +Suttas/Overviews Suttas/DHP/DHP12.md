# DHP12 - Attavagga - Self
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Easy to do are things that are bad and harmful to oneself. But exceedingly difficult to do are things that are good and beneficial.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> By oneself is evil done; by oneself is one defiled. By oneself is evil left undone; by oneself is one made pure. Purity and impurity depend on oneself; no one can purify another
> 
> Let one not neglect one's own welfare for the sake of another, however great. Clearly understanding one's own welfare, let one be intent upon the good.
>
