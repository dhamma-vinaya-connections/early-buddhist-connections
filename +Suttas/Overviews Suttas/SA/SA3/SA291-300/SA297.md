# SA297 - SA 3.15 - The Great Discourse on the Emptiness of Dharmas
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A mendicant asks who possesses old and death, and the other factors. The Buddha  says the question is improper, as it assumes a self as agent. Rather, dependent origination is the teaching “by the middle”, explaining phenomena according to natural conditions

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> If you have the view that the soul and the body are the same thing, there is no living of the spiritual life. If you have the view that the soul and the body are different things, there is no living of the spiritual life
> 
> Avoiding these two extremes, the realized one teaches by the middle way, dependent origination
