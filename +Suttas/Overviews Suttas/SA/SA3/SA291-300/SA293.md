# SA293 - SA 3.11 - Beyond Doubt
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> We bounce from one birth to the next, as a thrown stick bounces along the ground

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Heap of bones one person leaves behind
With the passing of a single aeon
Would form a heap as high as a mountain
> 
> But when one sees with correct wisdom
The truths of the noble ones   makes an end to suffering
By destroying all the fetters
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Stick and mountains of bones accumulated through samsara
