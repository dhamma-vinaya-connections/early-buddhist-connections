# SA292 - SA 3.10 - Thinking and Examining
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A mendicant should thoroughly investigate the causes of suffering in accordance with dependent origination. If someone who still has ignorance makes a choice, their consciousness fares on to a suitable state of existence. But one who has eradicated ignorance is detached and is not reborn anywhere.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A person immersed in ignorance generates a meritorious volitional formation, consciousness fares on to the meritorious; if he generates a demeritorious volitional formation, consciousness fares on to the demeritorious; if he generates an imperturbable volitional formation, consciousness fares on to the imperturbable.
> 
> A noble disciple when feeling a pleasant, painful, neutral, feeling terminating with the body or life, he understands: ‘it is impermanent’; he understands: ‘it is not held to’; he understands: ‘it is not delighted in
