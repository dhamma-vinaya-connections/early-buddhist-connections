# SA290 - SA 3.8 - Unlearned (2)
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> An ignorant person might become free of attachment to their body, but not their mind. Still, it would be better to attach to the body, as it is less changeable than the mind. But a noble disciple reflects on dependent origination

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The uninstructed worldling might experience revulsion towards this body and might become dispassionate towards it and be liberated from it. But is is unable to experience revulsion towards the mind
> 
> The instructed noble disciple attends closely and carefully to dependent origination itself thus:‘when this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises. When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Monkey grasping branches, like mind grasping objects and heat generated  by fire sticks like feelings generated by contact
