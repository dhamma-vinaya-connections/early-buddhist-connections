# SA288 - SA 3.6 - Three Reeds
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> In a discussion about dependent co-arising with ven. Maha kotthita, ven. Sariputta invokes a helpful simile to illustrate the relationship between consciousness and name-and-form.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The 12 links of dependent origination is not created by oneself, nor is it created by another, nor is it created both by oneself and by another, nor has it arisen fortuitously
> 
> With the cessation of name-and-form comes cessation of consciousness; with the cessation of consciousness comes cessation of name-and-form and so on with the rest
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Reed bundles stand leaning against each other, like name and form and consciousness
