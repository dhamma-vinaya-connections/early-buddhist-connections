# SA1258 - SA 49.13 - ?
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Be careful: there are many popular teachings nowadays that may sound good, but they're not necessarily consistent with the Buddha 's teachings

> Discourses spoken by the tathāgata that are deep, deep in meaning, supramundane, dealing with emptiness, are being recited, they will not be eager to listen to them
> 
> But in the future the bhikkhus will become delicate, with soft and tender hands and feet; they will sleep until sunrise on soft beds with pillows of cotton wool. Then Māra the evil one will gain access to them;
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Ancient drum has disintegrated, so too will the true teachings disappear
