# SA1266 - SA 50.2 - ?
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Sāriputta and mahācunda visit channa, who is ill. Channa says that he lacks for no care, but is in such great pain that he wishes to take his own life, insisting that he will do so blamelessly. Sāriputta tries to dissuade him, and questions him closely about attachment to the six senses. Later channa does take his own life, and the Buddha  confirmed that, despite sāriputta’s doubts, he was indeed blameless.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Because I have seen and directly known cessation in the eye, in eye-consciousness, and in things cognizable with eye-consciousness, that I regard them thus: ‘this is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self
> 
> For one who is independent there is no wavering. When there is no wavering, there is tranquillity; when there is tranquillity, there is no inclination; when there is no inclination, there is no coming and going; when there is no coming and going, there is no passing away and being reborn; when there is no passing away and being reborn, there is neither here nor beyond nor in between the two. This itself is the end of suffering
