# SA13 - SA 1.19 - Enjoyment
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Beings are attached to the aggregates due to gratification, repelled due to drawbacks, and find escape because there is an escape.

> If you take pleasure in the aggregates  you take pleasure in suffering. If you take pleasure in suffering, I say you’re not exempt from suffering
> 
> The arising, continuation, rebirth, and manifestation of the aggregates, is the arising of suffering, the continuation of diseases, and the manifestation of old age and death.
