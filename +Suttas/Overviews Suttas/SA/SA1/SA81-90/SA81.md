# SA81 - SA 1.138 - Pūraṇa
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  points out that attachment to things comes from paying more attention to the pleasure they give than to the stress and pain (dukkha) they cause. By turning your attention to the dukkha, however, you can gain release.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Because aggregates are pleasura beings are enamoured with it, they are captivated by it, and by being captivated by it they are defiled
> 
> Because aggregates are also suffering beings experience revulsion towards it. Experiencing revulsion, they become dispassionate, and through dispassion they are purified.
