# SA259 - SA 1.42 - Direct Realization
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Ven. Sariputta explains how every meditator, from beginner to Arahant, should contemplate the five aggregates

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A meditator should carefully attend to the five aggregates subject to clinging as impermanent, as suffering, as a disease, as a tumour, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as empty, as nonself
> 
> When these things are developed and cultivated, they lead to steam enter, once returner, non returner, Arahant and to pleasant dwelling in this very life and to mindfulness and clear comprehension.
