# SA46 - SA 1.158 - Worldly Food
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> One of the most extensive discourses in this collection begins with the Buddha  saying that when anyone recollects a past life, all they are recollecting is the five aggregates. He then gives a distinctive set of definitions of the aggregates in terms of their functions, and discusses them from various aspects

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> I am now being itched, in past I was itched and in the future I will be itchy if I were to seek delight in the 5 aggregates whether  internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near thus they should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘this is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.
> 
> Noble disciple who dismantles and does not build up; who abandons and does not cling; who scatters and does not amass; who extinguishes and does not kindle
