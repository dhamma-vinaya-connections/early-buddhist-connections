# SA43 - SA 1.155 - The Bound and Awakened
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> An ordinary person identifies their self with the five aggregates and suffers anxiety when the aggregates change. But a noble disciple, free of such identification, does not suffer

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form nor any aggregates as ‘this is mine, I am this, this is my self
> 
> If don't latch on any aggregates anxieties—don’t occupy their mind, they don’t become frightened, worried, concerned, or anxious because of grasping
