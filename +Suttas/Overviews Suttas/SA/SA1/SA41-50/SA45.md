# SA45 - SA 1.157 - The Aggregates in the Past, Future, and Present
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When you identify anything as self, you always identify one or other of the five aggregates. Contemplation of the five aggregates as not-self is the path to the end of identity.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The way leading to cessation of identity is not regard form as self … nor feeling as self … nor perception as self … nor volitional formations as self … nor consciousness as self … nor self as in consciousness
> 
> Arising of true knowledge, ‘I am’ does not occur to him; ‘I am this’ does not occur to him; ‘I will be’ and ‘I will not be,’ and ‘I will consist of form’ and ‘I will be formless,’ and ‘I will be percipient’ and ‘I will be nonpercipient doesn't occur to him
