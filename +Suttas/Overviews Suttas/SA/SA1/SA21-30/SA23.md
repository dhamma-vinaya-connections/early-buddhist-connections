# SA23 - SA 1.29 - Rāhula’s Question
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Rāhula asks how to contemplate to let go of conceit. The Buddha  urges him to see the aggregates as not-self

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Any aggregates whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near—one sees all form as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘this is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self
> 
> Then in regard to this body with consciousness and in regard to all external signs, I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to conceit no longer occur within
>
