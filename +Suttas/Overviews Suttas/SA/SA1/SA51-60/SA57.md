# SA57 - SA 1.169 - Self Pride
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Leaving behind the quarreling monks at kosambi, the Buddha  went to stay in the empty forest at pārileyyaka. Ānanda brings some mendicants to receive a teaching the Buddha  explains that the goal can be reached by a deep understanding of the five aggregates.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Don't take 5 aggregates to be the self or have a self or be in the self or self in them, nor this self is the same as the cosmos nor : 'I would not be, neither would there be what is mine. I will not be, neither will there be what is mine, all these views are fabrications
> 
> To an uninstructed,  touched by that which is felt born of contact with ignorance, craving arises. That fabrication is born of that.  That craving... That feeling... That contact... That ignorance is inconstant,  dependently co-arisen. It is by knowing & seeing in this way that one without delay puts an end to the effluents.
