# SA73 - SA 1.127 - The Heavy Burden
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The aggregates are the burden, a person carries that burden, craving takes up the burden, and letting go puts down the burden

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The five aggregates are truly burdens,
The burden-carrier is the person.
Taking up the burden is suffering in the world,
Laying the burden down is blissful.
> 
> Having laid the heavy burden down
Without taking up another burden,
Having drawn out craving with its root,
One is free from hunger, fully quenched.
