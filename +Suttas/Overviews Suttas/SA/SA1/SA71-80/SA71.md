# SA71 - SA 1.116-125 - Identity
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The aggregates considered in light of the four noble truths in terms of suffering identity and sides

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Suffering is the five aggregates subject to clinging, its origin is craving that leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there;
> 
> The remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, is cessation of identity and the noble path is the way to its cessation
