# SA104 - SA 1.172 - Yamaka
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Ven. Yamaka claims that when an Arahant dies, he/she is utterly annihilated. Ven. Sariputta pulls him out of this wrong view, and in so doing leads him to awakening

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A worthy one, with no more mental effluents: what is he on the break-up of the body, after death?"
> 
> Thus asked, I would answer, 'form is inconstant... Feeling... Perception... Fabrications... Consciousness is inconstant. That which is inconstant is stressful. That which is stressful has ceased and gone to its end
>

> Murderer disguise as friend, like aggregates disguise as me or mine
