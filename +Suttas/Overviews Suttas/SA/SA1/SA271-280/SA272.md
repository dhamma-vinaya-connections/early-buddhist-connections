# SA272 - SA 1.55 - Concepts
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A monk who is half-hearted in his meditation misses out on the rewards of both lay life and monastic life. one should let go of bad thoughts and wrong views, and see the aggregates as impermanent

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> This is the lowest form of livelihood, that is, gathering alms, if this clansman has gone forth. Yet he is covetous, inflamed by lust for sensual pleasures, with a mind full of ill will, with intentions corrupted by hate, muddle-minded, lacking clear comprehension, unconcentrated has missed the goal
> 
> For one who dwells with a mind well established in the four establishments of mindfulness, or for one who develops the signless concentration all unskillful thoughts ceases,  and reflecting there is nothing in the world that I could cling to without being blameworthy abandon wrong views
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Brand from a funeral pyre, burning at both ends and smeared with excrement in the middle like misbehaving bhikkhus
