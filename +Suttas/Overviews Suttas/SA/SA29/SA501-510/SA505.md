# SA505 - SA 29.5 - ?
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Moggallāna visits the heaven of sakka, the lord of gods, to see whether he really understands what the Buddha  is teaching

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Briefly define a bhikkhu  who is freed with the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans
> 
> When a bhikkhu has heard that nothing is worth insisting on, they directly know all things, they completely understand all things, then  when they experience any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—they meditate observing impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in those feelings. Meditating In this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world. Not Grasping, they’re not anxious and they personally become extinguished
