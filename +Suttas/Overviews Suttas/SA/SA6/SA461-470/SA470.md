# SA470 - SA 6.5 - Poison Arrows
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When shot by the arrow of physical pain, an unwise person makes matters worse by piling mental anguish on top of it, just as if he had been shot by two arrows. A wise person feels the sting of one arrow alone.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When unwise are touched by painful feeling, they resist it. The underlying tendency for repulsion and look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures with underlying tendency to greed
> 
> They don’t truly understand feelings’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. The underlying tendency to ignorance about neutral feeling underlies that.
