# SA616 - SA 7.19 - ?
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The parable of the cook. They present different kinds of dishes to the king, and observe which the king likes. In the same way, a mendicant observes why their meditation succeeds or fails. When the four kinds of mindfulness meditation succeeds it leads to giving up hindrances and entering immersion.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> They meditate observing an aspect of the body, feelings, mind or phenomena  their mind enters immersion, and their corruptions are given up
> 
> That astute, competent, skillful mendicant gets blissful meditations in this very life, and they get mindfulness and situational awareness. Why is that? Because they take their mind’s hint
>
