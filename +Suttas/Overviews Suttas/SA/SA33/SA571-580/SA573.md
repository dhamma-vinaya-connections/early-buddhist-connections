# SA573 - SA 33.8 - ?
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The jain leader mahāvīra, known as nigaṇṭha nātaputa in the buddhist tradition, is visited by Citta. Mahāvīra asks him whether he believes in a certain state of immersion. When Citta replies that he doesn’t go by faith in the Buddha  on this point, mahāvīra is delighted. But it turns out Citta doesn’t need faith, as he experiences such a state for himself.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Citta meets with the naked ascetic Kassapa, an old friend of his, and asks what gains he has realized from the spiritual life. Kassapa admits he has realized no higher attainments, whereupon Citta reveals he has realized many such attainments. Kassapa decides to ordain as a buddhist mendicant.
> 
> It's possible to experience any of the 4jhanas when ever I want and since I know and see like this, why should I rely on faith in another ascetic or brahmin who claims that there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected
