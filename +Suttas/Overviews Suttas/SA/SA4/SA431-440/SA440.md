# SA440 - SA 4.2 - ?
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The value of realizing the dhamma. Each discourse features a memorable simile illustrating the truly momentous implications of seeing the four noble truths

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A person accomplished in view who has made the breakthrough, the suffering that has been destroyed and eliminated is more, while that which remains is trifling.
> 
> The achievements of ascetics, brahmins, and wanderers of other sects do not amount to a hundred thousandth part of the achievement of a noble disciple, a person accomplished in view who has made the breakthrough.
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Similes of fingernails, ocean, earth, mountains, like for someone who has seen the truth, the suffering eliminated is like the himalayas; what remains is like seven bits of gravel.
