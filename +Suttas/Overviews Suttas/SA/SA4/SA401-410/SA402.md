# SA402 - SA 4.4 - ?
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> It is because of not understanding the four noble truths that both the Buddha and others have wandered for so long in transmigration. With verses

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Because of not seeing as they are
The Four Noble Truths,
We have wandered through the long course
In the various kinds of births.

The conduit to existence is severed;
Cut off is the root of suffering:
Now there is no more renewed existence.
