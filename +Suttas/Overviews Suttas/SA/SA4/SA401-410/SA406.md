# SA406 - SA 4.8 - ?
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A blind turtle would put its head through a yoke with a hole in it floating in the ocean sooner than someone in the lower realms would be reborn as a human

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A blind turtle, coming to the surface once every hundred years, insert its neck into that yoke with a single hole than the fool who has gone once to the nether world [would regain] the human state
> 
> it is by chance that one obtains the human state; by chance that the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata shines in the world
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Turtle blind simile illustrating the precious rarity of this human birth.
