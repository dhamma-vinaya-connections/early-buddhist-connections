# SA210 - SA 2.94 - Don’t Be Pleased or Suffer
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A brahmin believes that by bathing he can wash away his sins. But the Buddha  speaks of the Dhamma as a lake for true purification

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Dhamma is a lake, virtue's the ford,
Undefiled, which good men praise to others:
Men of wisdom come and bathe therein,
Then, clean of limb, they reach the other shore
> 
> That is no council where the good are absent;
They are not the good who don’t speak dhamma.
But having abandoned lust, hate, and delusion,
Those speaking on Dhamma are alone the good
