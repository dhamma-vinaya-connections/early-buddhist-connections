# SA205 - SA 2.78 - Impermanent and Changing
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A brahmin who loves to contradict everyone approaches the Buddha  thinking to challenge him. But when he hears the Buddha  speak, he cannot find anything to contradict

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Well-spoken counsel is hard to understand
By one who relishes contradiction,
By one with a corrupt mind
Who is engrossed in aggression.
> 
> But if one has removed aggression
And the distrust of one’s heart,
If one has cast away aversion,
One can understand well-spoken counsel
