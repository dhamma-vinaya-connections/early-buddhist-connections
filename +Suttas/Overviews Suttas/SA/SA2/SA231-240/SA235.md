# SA235 - SA 2.130 - Having a Teacher and a Disciple
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> One with no “student” and no “teacher” dwells in suffering. Here the Buddha  plays with the pali words such that “student” means “one who dwells within” and “teacher” means “one who assails”

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> From sense experience do not arise in him evil unwholesome states, memories and intentions connected with the fetters. They do not dwell within him and don't assailed him
> 
> Bhikkhu understands: ‘there is lust, hatred, or delusion internally’; or, if there is no lust, hatred, or delusion internally, he understands
>
