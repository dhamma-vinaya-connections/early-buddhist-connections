# SA233 - SA 2.128 - The World
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The oneness of all being is sometimes taught as a basic buddhist principle, but this discourse shows that the Buddha  himself rejected the idea. It is simply one of the extremes that he avoided by teaching dependent co-arising.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Who does the deed experiences the result or ‘one person does the deed and another experiences the result; or ‘allexist or doesn’t exist; or ‘all is a unity or plurality are extremes
> 
> Avoiding these two extremes, the realized one teaches by the middle way explained in terms of sense experience giving rise to craving and suffering
