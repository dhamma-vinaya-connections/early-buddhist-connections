# UD6.10 - Tathagatuppada Sutta - They Appear
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Hastening by, they miss the essence, 
sprouting ever more new bonds. 
Like moths falling in the flame, 
some have become fixed in what is seen or heard

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The glow-worm shines so long 
as the beacon of the sun does not rise. 
But when the sun has come up, 
that light is erased and shines no more
> 
> So too the reasoners shine bright 
so long as the Buddhas don’t arise in the world. 
The reasoners are not purified, nor are their disciples. 
Having bad views, they are not freed from suffering.”
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Sun light compared with glowworm,like the Buddha compared with reasoners
