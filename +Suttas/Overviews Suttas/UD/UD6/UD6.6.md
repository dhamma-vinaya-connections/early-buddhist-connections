# UD6.6 - Tatiyananatitthiya Sutta - Sectarians (3)
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Some ascetics and brahmins, it seems, 
cling to these things. 
Arguing, they quarrel, 
the folk who see just one part

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Folk are fixated on the I-maker, 
which is tied up with the other-maker. 
There are some who do not realize this, 
they do not see the dart
> 
> These folk are caught up in conceit, 
tied by conceit, shackled by conceit. 
Vehemently defending their views, 
they don’t escape transmigration
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Blind men discerning one part of elephant, like religious people attached to their view
