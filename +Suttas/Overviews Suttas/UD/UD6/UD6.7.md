# UD6.7 - Subhuti Sutta - Subhūti
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> “In whom mental vibrations are cleared away, 
internally clipped off entirely, 
perceiving the formless, beyond attachments, 
having overcome the four yokes, they are not born again

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> “What has been attained, and what can be attained -
these two are strewn with dust, for that miserable one in (wrong) training.


Those who hold the training rules as the essence, or virtue and practices, (right) livelihood, celibacy, and attendance as the essence - this is one end.
> 
> Those who say this: ‘There is no fault in sense pleasures” - this is the second end.


Thus these two ends promote the cemetery grounds, and the cemetery grounds promote (wrong) view. Not having understood these two ends, some get stuck, some go too far.
