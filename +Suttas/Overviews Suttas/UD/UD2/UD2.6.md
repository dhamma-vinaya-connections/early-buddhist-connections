# UD2.6 - Gabhini Sutta - The Pregnant Woman
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> “Affected by pleasure and pain in the village or wilderness,
You should certainly not consider it as due to oneself or another.
Contacts affect one with grasping as condition,
How could contacts affect one without grasping?”

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> “For he who has nothing there is happiness indeed,
For the one who has discerned the Dhamma, for the learnéd,
See how one who has something is troubled,
He is a person who is in a state of bondage in regard to (other) people.”
> 
> “Happy indeed are those who have nothing,
The Perfect Ones are people who surely have nothing,
See how one who has something is troubled,
He is a person who is in a state of bondage in regard to (other) people.”
