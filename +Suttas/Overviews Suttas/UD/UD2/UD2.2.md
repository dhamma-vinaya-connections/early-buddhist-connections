# UD2.2 - Raja Sutta - Kings
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Seclusion is happiness for the contented,
Kindness for the world is happiness 
for one who’d not harm a living creature.
Dispassion for the world is happiness 
for who has gone beyond sensual pleasures. 
But dispelling the conceit ‘I am’ 
is truly the ultimate happiness

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Neither the pleasures of the senses, 
nor even divine happiness, 
is worth even a sixteenth part 
of the happiness of craving’s end.
> 
> Creatures love happiness, 
so if you don’t harm them with a stick 
in search of your own happiness, 
after death you will find happiness
>
