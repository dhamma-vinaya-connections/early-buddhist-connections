# UD2.8 - Suppavasa Sutta - Suppavāsā
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> “Hosts of devas and many men are tied 
By the satisfaction in forms that are loved,
Miserable and worn out,
They come under the power of the King of Death.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> For sure those who are heedful day and night, 
Give up forms that are loved -
They surely dig up the root of misery
(which is) Death's bait, so difficult to transcend.”
> 
> “The disagreeable in an agreeable form,
The unlovely in a lovely form,
The painful in the form of pleasure,
Overcome the heedless one.”
>
