# UD2.9 - Visakha Sutta - Visākhā
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A former king, now monk, exclaims over the bliss of solitude

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> “All that is in another's power is painful,
All that is mastered is pleasing,
What is shared is troubling,
For yokes are difficult to transcend.”
> 
> “For he who has no agitations inside (the mind),
Who has thus completely transcended continuity of existence,
The devas are unable to see
He who is without fear, happy, and griefless.”
>
