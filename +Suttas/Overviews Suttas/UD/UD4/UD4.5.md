# UD4.5 - Naga Sutta - The Bull Elephant
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Displeased by crowds, the Buddha and a bull elephant enjoy the happiness of solitude

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> But now I live uncrowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their ministers, and monastics of other religions and their disciples. Being uncrowded, I live in happiness and comfort
> 
> The giant elephant, 
with tusks like chariot-poles, 
agrees heart to heart with the spiritual giant, 
since each finds joy in the woods alone
>
