# UD4.8 - Sundari Sutta - Sundarī
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A liar goes to hell, 
as does one who denies what they did. 
Both are equal in the hereafter, 
those men of base deeds

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A liar goes to hell, 
as does one who denies what they did. 
Both are equal in the hereafter, 
those men of base deeds
> 
> People out of control stab with words, 
like they stab a tusker in battle with darts. 
When they hear a harsh word spoken, 
a mendicant should endure with no anger in heart.
