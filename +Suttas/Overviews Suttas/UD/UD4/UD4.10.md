# UD4.10 - Sariputta Sutta - Sāriputta
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> One who has no guilt in life, 
nor grief at facing death: 
that wise one who has seen the truth, 
grieves not among the grieving

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> For the mendicant with peaceful mind, 
who has cut off craving for continued existence, 
Transmigration through births is finished, 
there are no future lives for them.
> 
> With mind at peace, so full of peace, 
for a mendicant who has cut the cord, 
transmigration through births is finished: 
they’re freed from Māra’s bonds.”
