# UD4.4 - Junha Sutta - Moonlit
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A developed mind is not affect even by hard blows

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> “A wrongly directed mind 
would do you more harm 
than a hater to the hated, 
or an enemy to their foe
> 
> One whose mind is like a rock, 
steady, never trembling, 
free of desire for desirable things, 
not getting annoyed when things are annoying: 
from where will suffering strike one 
whose mind is developed like this?
