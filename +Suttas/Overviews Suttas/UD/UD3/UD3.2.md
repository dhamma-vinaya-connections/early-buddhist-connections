# UD3.2 - Nanda Sutta - Nanda
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A mendicant who has left all deeds behind, 
shaking off the dust of past deeds, 
unselfish, steady, poised, 
has no need to complain.”

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> “For the monk who has given up all deeds,
For he who is throwing off the dust of what was done before,
For he who is unselfish, stable, such-like,
There is no need to speak to people.”
> 
> A mendicant who has beaten the thorn of sensuality—
and abuse, killing, and caging—
steady as a mountain, imperturbable, 
trembles not at pleasure and pain.
