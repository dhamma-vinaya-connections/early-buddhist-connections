# UD3.8 - Pindapatika Sutta - Alms
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A mendicant who relies on alms, 
self-supported, providing for no other; 
the poised one is envied by even the gods, 
calm and ever mindful.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A mendicant who relies on alms, 
self-supported, providing for no other; 
the poised one is envied by even the gods, 
but not if they’re after popularity and reputation
> 
> Living without a craft, light, desiring the good, 
with senses controlled, everywhere free; 
a migrant with no shelter, unselfish, with no need for hope, 
having given up conceit, wandering alone: that is a mendicant
>
