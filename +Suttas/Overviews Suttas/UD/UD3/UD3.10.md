# UD3.10 - Lokavolokana Sutta - Surveying the World
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> This world, born in torment, 
overcome by contact, speaks of disease as the self. 
For whatever it thinks it is, 
it turns out to be something else

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Where there’s delight,
there is fear.
What one fears
is stressful.
This holy life is lived
for the abandoning of becoming.
> 
> One who sees truly like this, 
with right wisdom, 
gives up craving for continued existence, 
while not looking forward to ending existence. 
Extinguishment comes from the ending of all cravings; 
fading away and cessation with nothing left over.
