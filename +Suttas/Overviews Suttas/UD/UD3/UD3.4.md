# UD3.4 - Sariputta Sutta - Sāriputta
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> As a rocky mountain 
is unwavering and well grounded, 
so when delusion ends, 
a monk, like a mountain, doesn’t tremble

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> With mindfulness of the body established, 
restrained in the six fields of contact, 
a mendicant always immersed in samādhi 
would know quenching in themselves
> 
> “In whom dwells no deceit or conceit, 
rid of greed, unselfish, with no need for hope, 
with anger eliminated, quenched: 
they are a brahmin, an ascetic, a mendicant
> 

> [!info] Similes
> mountain unshakable like a liberated mind
