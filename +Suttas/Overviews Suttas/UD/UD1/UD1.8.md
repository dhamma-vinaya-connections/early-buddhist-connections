# UD1.8 - Sangamaji Sutta - Sangamaji
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha redefines the term “brahmin” to mean anyone, regardless of birth, who is awakened.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Having banished bad qualities, 
those who live always mindful, 
with fetters ended, awakened, 
they are the world’s true brahmins
> 
> Purity doesn’t come from water, 
no matter how many people bathe there. 
One who has truth and principle, 
they are pure, they are brahmins
>
