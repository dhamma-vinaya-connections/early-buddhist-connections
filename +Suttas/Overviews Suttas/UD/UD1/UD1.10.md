# UD1.10 - Bahiya Sutta - Bahiya
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The ascetic Bāhiya becomes an Arahant after receiving a brief teaching about adding nothing to sensory experience

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> In the seen will be merely the seen; in the heard; in the thought; in the known will be merely the known.’ That’s how you should train, then you won’t be ‘by that’. Then you won’t be ‘in that.
> 
> And when a sage, a brahmin, finds understanding 
through their own sagacity, 
then from forms and formless, 
from pleasure and pain they are released
