# UD7.7 - Papancakkhaya Sutta - The Ending of Objectification
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha contemplates his own abandoning of the perceptions and categories of proliferation

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> There is no root or ground or leaves for them, 
so where would creepers sprout from? 
That wise one is released from bonds: 
who is worthy to criticize them? 
Even the gods praise them,
> 
> There is no proliferation remaining in them, 
the reins and bar are escaped; 
the sage who lives without craving 
is never scorned by the world with its gods
>
