# UD7.8 - Kaccana Sutta - Kaccāyana
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Their mindfulness would always 
be established in the body, constant: 
‘It might not be, and it might not be mine, 
It will not be, and it will not be mine.’ 
Meditating stage by stage on that, 
in time they’d cross over clinging

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> What difference would a well make 
if water is there all the time? 
Having cut off craving at the root, 
who would go out on a quest?”
> 
> The world is caught up in delusion, 
but is looked on as making sense. 
The fool caught up in attachment 
is surrounded by darkness. 
It seems as if eternal, 
but for one who sees, there is nothing.”
