# UD8.4 - Catutthanibbana Sutta - Nibbāna (4)
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> There is a dimension which is not established, does not proceed, and has no support. Just this is the end of suffering

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> It’s hard to see what they call the ‘uninclined’, 
for the truth is not easy to see. 
For one who has penetrated craving, 
who knows and sees, there is nothing
> 
> Since there is an unborn, unproduced, unmade, and unconditioned, an escape is found from the born, produced, made, and conditioned
