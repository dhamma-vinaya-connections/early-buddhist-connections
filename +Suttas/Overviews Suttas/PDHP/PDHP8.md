# PDHP8 - Śokavagga - Sorrow
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Whatever griefs or lamentations there are,
and the many kinds of suffering in the world,
these all arise because of love,
without loves, these do not originate.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Therefore they are happy and free from grief,
who are without love for anything in the world,
therefore those wanting what is griefless, dust-free,
should not have love for anything in the world.
> 
> The one who, steady in virtue, 
throws out any impurity,
endowed with restraint and truth, 
is indeed worthy of the renunciant’s robe.
