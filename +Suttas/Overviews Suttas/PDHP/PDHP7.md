# PDHP7 - Atthavagga - Goal
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> If, by renouncing a small good, 
he might see a good that is large,
the wise one should renounce that small good, 
seeing the good that is extensive.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> There are surely true people everywhere,
the good do not talk of desiring sense-pleasures;
when touched by pleasure or by suffering,
true people are not elated or depressed.
> 
> The victor generates hatred, 
the defeated one finds suffering,
the one at peace lives happily, 
having abandoned victory and defeat.
