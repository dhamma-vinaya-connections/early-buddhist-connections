# PDHP18 - Āsavavagga - Defilements
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> in solitude, where it is hard to delight,
one should seek to delight in that place, 
having given up sense pleasures, and having no possessions,
he should purify the self of defilements of mind in every way.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> for those who always properly undertake 
mindfulness of the body
who do not practice what is not to be done, 
persisting in what is to be done,
for those mindful ones, those fully aware, 
their pollutants are destroyed.
> 
> For those devoted to being alert, 
who train both by day and by night,
who are intent on Nibbāna, 
the pollutants are laid to rest.
