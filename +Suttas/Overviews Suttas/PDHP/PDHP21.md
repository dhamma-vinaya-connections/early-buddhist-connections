## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Having faith, virtue and energy,
concentration and insight into the Dhamma,
well-established in patience, meekness and concentration,
they have come to the essence of wisdom and learning.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Faith is a person’s travelling companion,
he would not accept travelling without faith,
from that there will be fame and renown for him,
and when he abandons the body he goes to heaven.

displeasure from his mind,
with confident mind, happy, 
he can understand well-spoken words.
