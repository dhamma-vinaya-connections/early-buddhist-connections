# PDHP20 - Āttavagga - Self
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Not the wrongs of others, 
or what others have done or have not done one should consider, 
but what has been done and not done by oneself.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> If one regards oneself as dear one should guard oneself right well,
for happiness is not easy to gain by those who do wrong.
> 
> Whoever reviles the worthy teaching 
of the Noble Ones who live by Dhamma,
that stupid one, depending on wicked views,
makes himself the same as his enemy wishes him to be.
