# PDHP14 - Bālavagga - Fools
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> That man who wraps up rotting fish with the best fragrant grass,
makes the fragrant grass smell rotten, 
and so with those who associate with fools.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> If one who does no wickedness associates with those who do,
he is suspected of wickedness, 
and his disrepute increases.
> 
> Even if a fool attends on a wise man for his whole life long,
he does not learn Dhamma, 
like the spoon learns not the taste of curry.
