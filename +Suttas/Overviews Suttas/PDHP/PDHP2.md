# PDHP2 - Jamavarggaḥ - Pairs
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> If you should find a prudent, wise companion, 
one who lives well, a wise one,
overcoming all your troubles
you should live with that one, glad and mindful.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> If you do not find a prudent, wise companion, 
one who lives well, a wise one,
like a king who abandons his conquered kingdom,
one should live alone like a solitary elephant in the forest.
> 
> It is better to live alone, 
there can be no companionship with a fool,
one should live alone and not do anything bad,
unconcerned like a solitary elephant in the forest.
