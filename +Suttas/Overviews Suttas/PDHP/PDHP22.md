# PDHP22 - Cittavagga - Mind
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Like a fish thrown up on dry land, 
pulled out from its watery home,
the mind is agitated, 
one ought to throw off the sway of Māra.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> For the mind that is difficult to subdue, flighty, 
flitting wherever it will,
restraint is good, 
a restrained mind brings happiness.
> 
> Just as rain does not penetrate a house with thatching that is good,
so passion, hatred and delusion cannot penetrate a mind that is well-developed.
