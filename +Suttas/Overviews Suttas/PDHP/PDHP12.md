# PDHP12 - Malavagga - Stains
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Easily done are things not good, 
and unbeneficial for oneself,
but only those beneficial and good 
are done by the wise.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The sage gradually, 
little by little, moment by moment,
should remove the stain from himself, 
like a smith removes the stain from silver.
> 
> Knowing the essential in what is essential, 
and the unessential in what is unessential,
they understand what is essential, 
and resort to right intention.
