# PDHP1 - Jamavarggaḥ - Pairs
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Mind precedes thoughts, 
mind is their chief, they are impelled by mind,{24}
if with a base mind one speaks or acts,
through that suffering follows him 
like a wheel follows the ox’s foot.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Here he is happy, after death he is happy,
the meritorious one is happy in both places,
he is happy...
seeing the purity of his own deeds.
> 
> “He abused me, he struck at me, 
he overcame me, he robbed me,”
those who bear these ill-will,
their hatred is never appeased.
