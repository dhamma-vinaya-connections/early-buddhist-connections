# PDHP11 - Tahnavagga - Craving
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Not through a rain of coins is satisfaction found for sense desires,
the wise one knowing: 
“Sense pleasures have little joy, much suffering,”
does not find delight even in heavenly pleasures.
The disciple of the Perfect Sambuddha delights in craving’s destruction.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> That one who is overcome by these low cravings in the world, 
which are difficult to get past,
for him griefs increase 
like grass that has been rained upon.
> 
> Be free of the past, be free of the future,
be free of the present, after crossing over all existence,
with mind liberated in every way,
you will not return to birth and old age.
