# PDHP25 - Uragavagga - Snake
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> That one who removes the passion, hatred, delusion, anger, conceit that has arisen,
as he would remove pervasive snake venom with medicines,
that monk abandons the near and far shore,
like a snake who has abandoned its old, worn-out skin.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> That one who cuts off craving without remainder,
having dried up that quick-flowing stream,
that monk abandons the near and far shore,
like a snake who has abandoned its old, worn-out skin
> 
> For the one with no distress that has arisen,
having uprooted all unwholesome roots,
that monk abandons the near and far shore,
like a snake who has abandoned its old, worn-out skin.
