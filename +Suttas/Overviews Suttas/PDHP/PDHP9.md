# PDHP9 - Kalyāṇīvagga - Fine
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A wicked deed that has been done, 
like milk, does not turn all at once,
smouldering, it follows the fool, 
like a fire covered with ashes.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> He who offends against the inoffensive one,
a purified and passionless person:
that wicked deed then returns to the fool,
like fine dust that is thrown against the wind.
> 
> Like a merchant on a fearful path, 
with few friends and great wealth,
as one loving life would avoid poison, 
so should one avoid wicked deeds.
