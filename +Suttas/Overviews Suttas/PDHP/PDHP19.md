# PDHP19 - Vācāvagga - Speech
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The wise are restrained bodily, 
verbally and also mentally,
the wise are restrained in every way, 
they are indeed very well-restrained.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Even though reciting abundant scriptures,
the heedless fellow, who does not do what they say,
like a cowboy counting other’s cattle,
does not partake of the ascetic life.
> 
> One should speak out the truth, one should not get angry, 
when requested you should give, if only a little,
through these three conditions 
one can go to the presence of the gods.
