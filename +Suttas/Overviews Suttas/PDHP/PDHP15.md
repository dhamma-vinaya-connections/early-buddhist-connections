# PDHP15 - Daṇḍavagga - Weapons
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Like a cowherd with a stick drives cattle to pasture,
so do old age and death overpower living beings.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Everyone trembles at sticks, 
for all of them life is dear,
comparing oneself with others, 
one should not hurt or have them hurt.
> 
> One should regard someone who shows your faults 
just like one who points out hidden treasure,
one should keep company with 
such a sagacious person who reproves you;
keeping company with such is surely better for you, not worse.
