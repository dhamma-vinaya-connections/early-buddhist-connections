# PDHP4 - Brāhmaṇavagga - Brahmins
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Not because of matted hair, 
family or birth is one a true brahmin,
he who wards off wickedness, 
 in every way, 
he is called a brahmin.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Like water on the lotus leaf, 
like a mustard seed on a needle,
he who is unsmeared by desires, 
that one I say is a brahmin.
> 
> The deeply wise sagacious one, 
skilled in what is path and not path,
who has reached the ultimate good, 
that one I say is a brahmin.
