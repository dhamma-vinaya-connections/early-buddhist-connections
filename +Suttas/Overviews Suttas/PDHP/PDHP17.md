# PDHP17 - Khāntivagga - Acceptance
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> If, for even one living being, one with an uncorrupt mind,
has loving-kindness, there is wholesomeness in that,
but the one with compassion in mind for all living beings,
 that noble one makes abundant merit.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Then he who with a mind of loving-kindness 
has compassion for all living beings,
having loving-kindness towards all beings, 
he has no one who is hated.
> 
> He who neither kills, nor has killed, 
conquers, nor has conquered,
having loving-kindness towards all beings, 
he has no one who is hated.
