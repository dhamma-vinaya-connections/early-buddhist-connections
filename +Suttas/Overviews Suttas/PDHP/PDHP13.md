# PDHP13 - Bālavagga - Fools
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Stupid fools live having themselves as their own foes,
committing wicked deeds, 
which produce bitter fruit.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The fool thinks there is success, 
when he speaks words that are rough,
but for the one who knows, 
endurance is the success of the good.
> 
> The fool who conceives he is a fool, 
is at least wise in that matter,
the fool who is proud of his wisdom, 
he is said to be a fool indeed.
