# PDHP6 - Atthavagga - Goal
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Friends are good whenever need arises,
at the break-up of life merit is good,
being content with everything is good,
the abandoning of all wickedness is good.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Meeting with the noble is pleasant, 
living with good people is pleasant,
through not meeting foolish people 
one will constantly be happy.
> 
> Therefore do not hold anything as loved, 
for speaking of the loved is loathsome.
There are no knots for those 
who hold nothing as loved or as unloved.
