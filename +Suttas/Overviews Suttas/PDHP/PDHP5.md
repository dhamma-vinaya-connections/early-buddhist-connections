# PDHP5 - Bhikṣuvagga - Bhikkhus
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> That monastic who dwells in loving-kindness, 
with faith in Buddha’s dispensation,
has penetrated the state of peace, 
the joy in stilling of all conditions,
here and now there is Nibbāna, 
the unsurpassed release from all bonds.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> With uplifted mind, happy, 
having overcome what is dear and not dear,
then with lots of happiness, 
the monastic should wander mindfully.
> 
> Calm in body and calm in mind, 
having calmness and composure,
having thrown off worldly gain 
the monastic is called one at peace.
