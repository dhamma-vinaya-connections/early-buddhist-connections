# PDHP23 - Maggavagga - Path
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The eightfold is the best of paths, 
four principles the best of truths,
dispassion the best of states, 
the Visionary the best of men.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> For as long as an atom of desire
of a man for his kin is not cut down,
the mind is in bondage there,
like a calf in bondage to mother’s milk.
> 
> All conditions are impermanent, 
All components of mind and body are without self,
when one sees this with wisdom,
then one grows tired of suffering – 
this is the path to purity.
