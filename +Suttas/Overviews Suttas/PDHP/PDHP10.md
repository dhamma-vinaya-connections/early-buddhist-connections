# PDHP10 - Puṣpavagga - Flowers
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The fragrance of flowers goes not against the wind,
nor does sandalwood or pinwheel or saffron,
but the fragrance of the good goes against the wind,
the true person’s fragrance permeates all directions.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Just like a beautiful flower, 
which has colour, and has fragrance,
so are well-spoken words fruitful 
for the one who does act on them.
> 
> The End-Maker takes control of 
the one whose mind is attached to collecting flowers,
though he is unfulfilled with sense pleasures.
