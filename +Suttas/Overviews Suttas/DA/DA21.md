# DA21 - 梵動 - Brahmā’s [Net]
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> In this important sutta, the first in the tipitaka, the Buddha  describes sixty-two philosophical and speculative views concerning the self and the world that were prevalent among spiritual seekers of his day. In rejecting these teachings — many of which thrive to this day — he decisively establishes the parameters of his own.
While others may praise or criticize the Buddha , they tend to focus on trivial details. The Buddha  presents an analysis of 62 kinds of wrong view, seeing through which one becomes detached from meaningless speculations

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Bhikkhu's sila
Bhikkhu's right livelihood
Theories about the past, 4 eternalism
Theories about the past, 4 partial eternalism
Theories about the past, 4 the cosmos is finite or infinite
Theories about the past, 4 evasiveness and equivocation
Theories about the future, 16 percipient life after death, first 8 are non-percipient, 8 neither
7 annihilationism
5 nibbana in present life
All theories about the past and the future are dependent on contact, from that felling, craving, grasping, becoming, rebirth
> 
> Avoid & refrain from: killing, stealing, sex, lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, unworthy talk, arguing, flattery, injuring plants, eat after the morning,  entertainment, adorning themselves, money, property, buying and selling, cheating, luxury,  violence, storing up goods, gambling, hinting, and belittling, and using material possessions to pursue other material possessions
Refrain from earn a living with unworthy branches of knowledge like: reading the marks, making predictions, arts, sciences, wedding ceremonies, casting spells, rites & rituals, prescribe medicines
The self and the cosmos are eternal, based on recollecting, many past life and aeons or by logic & inquiry
Brahmā is the creator & is permanent, based on recollecting this aeon past lives and logic & inquiry
Meditate perceiving the cosmos as finite. perceiving the cosmos as infinite. perceiving the cosmos as finite vertically but infinite horizontally and by logic & inquiry
Those who doesn’t truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful, that would be stressful for me or I might feel desire or greed or hate or repulsion, or others grill me about that, or being dull and stupid
8s after death it's physical, non physical, both or neither; finite, infinite, both or neither; unified, diverse, both or neither perceptions; experience happiness, suffering, both or neither
This self is physical, is sensual, mind-made, aware that “space is infinite”, consciousness is infinite, dimension of nothingness, neither perception nor non-perception
This self attains ultimate extinguishment with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, with 1st jhana, 2nd jhana, 3rd jhana, 4 jhana
When a mendicant truly understands the six fields of contacts’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape, they understand what lies beyond all these things
