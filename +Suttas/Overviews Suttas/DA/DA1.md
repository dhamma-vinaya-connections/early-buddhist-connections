# DA1 - 大本 - Great Origin
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  teaches about the six Buddha s of the past, and tells a lengthy account of one of those, vipassī

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Lives of 6 past Buddha s, what’s normal for one intent on awakening, the 32 marks of a great man
 The law of suffering, its causes and its cessation
The characteristic 32 marks of the Buddhas and wheel turning monarch 
The Buddha  vipassi's life, the 4 messengers, his awakening, similarities with other Buddha s
> 
> Details about the Buddha s vipassī, sikhī, vessabhū, kakusandha, koṇāgamana, and Kassapa. The peculiarities of their last rebirth
Conciousness- mind-body - 6 senses - contact - feelings - craving - grasping - continued existence - rebirth - old age and death - suffering
Regularity of the buddhas of birth situations 
Patient acceptance is the highest austerity. 
Extinguishment is the highest, say the Buddha s. 
No true renunciate injures another, 
Nor does an ascetic hurt another.
Not to do any evil; 
To embrace the good; 
To purify one’s mind: 
This is the instruction of the Buddha s.
Not speaking ill nor doing harm; 
Restraint in the monastic code; 
Moderation in eating; 
Staying in remote lodgings; 
Commitment to the higher mind—
This is the instruction of the Buddha s.
