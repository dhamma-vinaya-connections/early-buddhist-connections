# DA27 - 沙門果 - Rewards of the Ascetic Life
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The newly crowned king ajātasattu is disturbed by the violent means by which he achieved the crown. He visits the Buddha  to find peace of mind, and asks him about the benefits of spiritual practice. This is one of the greatest literary and spiritual texts of early buddhism.
King Ajatasattu asks the Buddha , "what are the fruits of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?" The Buddha  replies by painting a comprehensive portrait of the buddhist path of training, illustrating each stage of the training with vivid similes.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Wrong doctrines:
Mundane fruits of renunciation
> 
> There is no merit or outcome of merit, beings are purified without cause, annihilationism, seven substances are not made & there is no-one, the fourfold restraint, evasiveness,
Spiritual rewards are happiness by following the gradual training
