# DA29 - 露遮 - Lohitya
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A brahmin has fallen into the idea that there is no point in trying to offer spiritual help to others. The Buddha  goes to see him, and persuades him of the genuine benefits of spiritual teaching
A non-buddhist poses some good questions: if Dhamma is something that one must realize for oneself, then what is the role of a teacher? Are there any teachers who don't deserve some sort of criticism? The Buddha 's reply includes a sweeping summary of the entire path of practice.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Reasons to share the Dhamma and benefits for following it
 Teachers who deserve to be legitimate reprimanded
> 
> Not sharing the Dhamma is unkindly, their heart is full of hostility, and they have wrong view.
The teacher who has not reached the goal & disciples don’t pay attention, who has not reached the goal & disciples follow him, who has reached the goal & disciples don’t pay attention to him

> A king not sharing his wealth like an ascetics not sharing his knowledge
