# DA26 - 三明 - Knowledge of Three Vedas
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A number of brahmins are discussing the true path to Brahmā. Contesting the claims to authority based on the vedas, the Buddha  insists that only personal experience can lead to the truth

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Show the inconsistencies of other teachers
5 fetters of sensual pleasures, 5 hindrances, qualities of Brahma opposed to brahmins
Meditation of love, compassion, rejoice & equanimity are the way to heaven
> 
> None of the brahmins have seen Brahmā with their own eyes
So long as they enjoy pleasures and be obstructed by 5 hindrances  it’s impossible to be reborn in the company of Brahmā
Only one who is not possessive, has no enmity, ill will, corruption, and does wield power, can  be reborn in the company of Brahmā
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Queue of blind men, the finest lady and the ladder like  statement with no basis;
 crossing the river aciravatī similar to  rites, sense pleasures & hindrances
