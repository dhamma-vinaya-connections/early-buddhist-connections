# DA17 - 清淨 - Purity
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Following the death of nigaṇṭha nātaputta, the leader of the jains, the Buddha  emphasizes the stability and maturity of his own community. He encourages the community to come together after his death and recite the teachings in harmony

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Characteristics of teachings and disciples of both awakened and unawakened  teachers, disciples with & without regrets, incomplete spiritual path,
How to find agreement with companions about the Buddha 's teachings, reasons for allowing requisites
Right speech characteristics 
Low & pointless pleasures and pleasures that lead to peace, awakening & their benefits
Things impossible for the perfected; traits of speech and act of the Buddha 
Undeclared points, declared point, views of the past & future and how to transcend those views
Transcend wrong views realizing they depend on contact and dependent Origination
> 
> Misfortune to follow unawakening  teachings or not following an awakening one & the fortune of practice in line with the awakening teaching with the right phrase & meaning
Any disagreement between spiritual companions training in harmony, you should carefully convince them by examining phrasing & meaning without flattering or rebuking
Talk when is beneficial, true, gentle and timely
Low & pointless pleasures: killing, stealing, lying and from sensual stimulation; and pleasures that lead to peace: 4 jhanas
An Arahant can’t deliberately kill, steal, have sex, tell a deliberate lie, or store up goods for their own enjoyment. And they can’t make decisions prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, or cowardice. The  Buddha  has speech that’s well-timed, true, meaningful, in line with the teaching and training and real & he does as he says, and says as he does
Realized one exists, or not or neither after death; the self and the cosmos are eternal or not or both or neither; they are made by oneself or another or both or neither or by chance; self is physical or non-nonphysical or both or neither or percipient or not or neither or annihilated. The 4 kingnds of mindfulness meditation for giving up and going beyond all these views 
ideation of internal form, perceives external forms; second, liberation realized when one, without any ideation of internal form, per-ceives external forms; third, the liberation ealized when
terminated all defilements, 4 formless and cessation of feelings and perceptions
