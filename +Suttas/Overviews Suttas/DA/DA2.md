# DA2 - 遊行 - Last Journey and Sojourns
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The longest of all discourses, this extended narrative tells of the events surrounding the Buddha ’s death. Full of vivid and moving details, it is an ideal entry point into knowing the Buddha  as a person, and understanding how the buddhist community coped with his passing
This wide-ranging sutta, the longest one in the pali canon, describes the events leading up to, during, and immediately following the death and final release (parinibbana) of the Buddha . This colorful narrative contains a wealth of Dhamma teachings, including the Buddha 's final instructions that defined how buddhism would be lived and practiced long after the Buddha 's death — even to this day. But this sutta also depicts, in simple language, the poignant human drama that unfolds among the Buddha 's many devoted followers around the time of the death of their beloved teacher.
