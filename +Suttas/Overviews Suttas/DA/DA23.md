# DA23 - 究羅檀頭 - Brāhmaṇa Kūṭadanta
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A brahmin wishes to undertake a great sacrifice, and asks for the Buddha ’s advice. The Buddha  tells a legend of the past, in which a king is persuaded to give up violent sacrifice, and instead to devote his resources to supporting the needy citizens of his realm. However, even such a beneficial and non-violent sacrifice pales in comparison to the spiritual sacrifice of giving up attachments

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Brahmins qualities vs Buddha 's qualities
How to avoid crime in a kingdom, 16 accessories for a sacrifice, 3 modes of having remorse, how to dispell regret regarding the recipients in ten respects, how to perform a great sacrifice, list of greater sacrifices in ascending order
Following the gradual training  is the greatest sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial
> 
> Abbreviated version
The greatest sacrifices: regular gifts to ethical renunciates, dwelling for the saṅgha, go for refuge to the Buddha , the teaching, and the saṅgha, follow 5 precepts, follow gradual training until arahanship
Gradual training abbreviated is highest merits
