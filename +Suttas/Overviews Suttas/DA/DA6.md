# DA6 - 轉輪聖王修行 - Universal Ruler
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> In illustration of his dictum that one should rely on oneself, the Buddha  gives a detailed account of the fall of a kingly lineage of the past, and the subsequent degeneration of society. This process, however, is not over, as the Buddha  predicts that eventually society will fall into utter chaos. But far in the future, another Buddha , metteyya, will arise in a time of peace and plenty.
The Buddha  explains how skillful action can result in the best kind of long life, the best kind of beauty, the best kind of happiness, and the best kind of strength.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> let the teaching and yourself be your only refuge. Doing so, you will grow in life span, beauty, happiness, wealth, and power.
Powers and noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch
Qualities of wise wise persons to ask these questions
Power of skillful action and consequences of unskillful actions
> 
> 4 foundation of mindfulness are the refuge, 4 basis of psychic powers for long life, ethics is the beauty, 4 jhanas are happiness; love, compassion & equanimity are wealth and undefiled freedom is power
Noble duties: provide just protection and security for your all beings in the country. Do not let injustice prevail in the realm. Pay Money to the penniless in the realm.
What is skillful? What is unskillful? What is blameworthy? What is blameless? What should be cultivated? What should not be cultivated? Doing what leads to my lasting harm and suffering? Doing what leads to my lasting welfare and happiness?”
Decadence starts from not paying money to the penniless then poverty, theft, swords, killing, lying, backbiting, sexual misconduct, harsh speech and talking nonsense, desire and ill will, wrong view, illicit desire, immoral greed, and wrong thoughts, and lack of due respect for mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, and failure to honor the elders in the family.
