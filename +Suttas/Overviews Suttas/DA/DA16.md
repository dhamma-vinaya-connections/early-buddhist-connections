# DA16 - 善生 - Kalyāṇa-jātika
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  encounters a young man who honors his dead parents by performing rituals. The Buddha  recasts the meaningless rites in terms of virtuous conduct. This is the most detailed discourse on ethics for lay people
The householder's code of discipline, as described by the Buddha  to the layman sigala. This sutta offers valuable practical advice for householders on how to conduct themselves skillfully in their relationships with parents, spouses, children, pupils, teachers, employers, employees, friends, and spiritual mentors so as to bring happiness to all concerned.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> To abandon and avoid 4 corrupt deeds, 4 grounds for bad deeds, 6 drains on wealth
How to recognize enemies disguised as friends and good-hearted friends
How to honor and protect 6 directions, how to attain glory and be a good wise person
> 
> 4 corrupt actions, killing, stealing, adultery and lying; 4 grounda are desire, hatred, delusion, or fear; 6 drains heedlessness caused by intoxication, roaming the streets at inappropriate times, habitual partying, compulsive gambling, bad companionship, and laziness
Bad friends the taker, the talker, the flatterer, and the reckless; good friends: the helper, the friend who endures in good times and bad, the mentor, and the compassionate
Mother and father as the east, teachers as the south, spouse and family as the west, friends and colleagues as the north, workers and servants as the lower direction, and ascetics and brahmans as the upper direction.
