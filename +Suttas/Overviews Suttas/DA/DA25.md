# DA25 - 裸形梵志 - Naked Brāhmaṇa Ascetic
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  is challenged by a naked ascetic on the topic of spiritual austerities. He points out that it is quite possible to perform all kinds of austere practices without having any inner purity of mind.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> How to compare teachings, teachers and disciples. Ascetic practices & uselessness of self mortification. The Buddha 's lion’s roar
Accomplishment in ethics, in mind, and in wisdom
> 
> Leave aside those matters on which we disagree, most sages agree in abandoning unskillful, blameworthy behavior and cultivate skillful, blameless behaviors
who have come to the
assembly and listened to the teaching with one unified mind are [thor-oughly] enraptured to receive the teaching and faithfully put it into practice
