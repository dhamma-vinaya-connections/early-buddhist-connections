# SN45.21 - Micchattasutta - Wrongness
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Regardless of whether one is a lay person or a renunciate, the Buddha  praises the right way, not the wrong way. The wrong eightfold path is the wrong way; the right eightfold path is the right way

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The factors of the wrong eightfold path are unskillful qualities; those of the right eightfold path are skillful qualities
> 
> A bad person practices wrong eightfold path, and a worse person has wrong knowledge and wrong liberation, too; a good person is the opposite
>
