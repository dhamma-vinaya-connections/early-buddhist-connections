# SN55.3 - Dīghāvuupāsakasutta - Dīghāvu
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The lay follower dīghāvu is ill and he asks for the Buddha to visit. Dīghāvu confirms that he possesses the four factors of stream-entry and in addition six contemplations leading to insight. Yet he is still worried that his close companion will miss him when he dies

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Experiential faith in the Buddha , the teaching, and the saṅgha, and ethical conduct—is a stream-enterer, destined for awakening
> 
> Meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions, perceiving suffering in impermanence, perceiving not-self in suffering, perceiving giving up, perceiving fading away, and perceiving cessation
