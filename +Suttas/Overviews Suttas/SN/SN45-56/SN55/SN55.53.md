# SN55.53 - Dhammadinnasutta - Dhammadinna
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The lay follower Dhammadinna leads a group of 500 to visit the Buddha. He encourages them to study deep discourses, but they protest that they don’t have enough time. So the Buddha encourages them in the four factors of stream-entry

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Its not easy living the lay life to train yourselves thus: ‘From time to time we will enter and dwell upon those discourses spoken by the Tathāgata that are deep, deep in meaning, supramundane, dealing with emptiness
> 
> Then you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will possess confirmed confidence in the Buddha … in the Dhamma … in the Saṅgha.… We will possess the virtues dear to the noble ones, unbroken … leading to concentration
