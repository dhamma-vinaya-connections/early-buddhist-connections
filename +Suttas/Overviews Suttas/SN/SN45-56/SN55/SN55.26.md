# SN55.26 - Paṭhamaanāthapiṇḍikasutta - Anathapiṇḍika (1)
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was sick, Sāriputta reminds him of his considerable accomplishments in the Dhamma, analyzing stream-entry in ten factors, at which Anāthapiṇḍika recovers

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When one has confidence in the Triple Gem
And view that has been rectified,
They say that one is not poor,
That one’s life is not vain.
> 
> Therefore the person of intelligence,
Remembering the Buddha’s Teaching,
Should be devoted to faith and virtue,
To confidence and vision of the Dhamma.
