# SN55.52 - Vassaṁvutthasutta - One Who Spent the Rains
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When a monk comes from Sāvatthī to Kapilavatthu, the Sakyans visit him and ask as to the health of the Buddha and the Saṅgha. Then they ask what the monk has learned. He replies that the number of perfected ones is few, and those on lower levels of attainment are greater in number

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> are few who, by the destruction of the taints, in this very life enter and dwell in the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge
> 
> Are more the non returners, and more the once returners and more the stream enters
