## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Ānanda asks the Buddha about the rebirths of several disciples. The Buddha confirms those details, and proposes a way for people to know for themselves by reflecting on the four factors of stream-entry.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Experiential faith in the Buddha , the teaching, and the saṅgha, and ethical conduct—is a stream-enterer, destined for awakening
> 
> A noble disciple who has this may declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss
