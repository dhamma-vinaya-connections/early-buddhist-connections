# SN48.43 - Sāketasutta - Saketa
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  discusses the five faculties and the five powers. They are like a river that flows around a central island. From one point of view they can be considered different, but from another they are just the same stream

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> There is a method of exposition, bhikkhus, by means of which the five faculties become the five powers and the five powers become the five faculties
> 
> That which is the faculty of faith is the power of faith; that which is the power of faith is the faculty of faith. The same with other 4 faculties
> 

> [!info] Similes
