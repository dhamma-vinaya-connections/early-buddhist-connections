# SN48.53 - Sekhasutta - A Trainee
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> How does someone recognize that they are a trainee? By understanding the four noble truths and the five faculties. But only a perfected one fully embodies these qualities

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A trainee understands thus: ‘there is no other ascetic or brahmin outside here who teaches a Dhamma so real, true, actual as the blessed one does
> 
> An Arahant dwells having contacted with the body their destination, their culmination, their goal and understands: ‘these six faculties will cease completely and totally without remainder
