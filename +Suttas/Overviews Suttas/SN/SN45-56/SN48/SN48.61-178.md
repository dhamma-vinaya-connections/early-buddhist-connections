# SN48.61-178 - Saṁyojanasutta - Fetters
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> These five faculties, when developed and cultivated, lead to the abandoning of the fetters, underlying tendencies and destruction of the taints

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> These five faculties have been developed and cultivated, one of two fruits may be expected: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue of clinging, the state of nonreturning
> 
> A non returner within the interval …  upon landing …  without exertion …  with exertion … one bound upstream, heading towards the akaniṭṭha realm
