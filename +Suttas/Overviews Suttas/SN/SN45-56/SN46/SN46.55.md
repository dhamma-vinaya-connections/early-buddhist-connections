# SN46.55 - Saṅgāravasutta - Sangarava
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The brahmin saṅgārava asks why sometimes verses stay in memory while other times they don’t. The Buddha  replies that it is due to the presence of either the hindrances of awakening factors. He gives a set of similes illustrating each of the hindrances with different bowls of water

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When one dwells with a mind  overwhelmed by 5 hindrances , and one does not understand as it really is the escape from them on that occasion one neither knows nor sees as it really is one’s own good, or the good of others, or the good of both
> 
> On that occasion even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind, let alone those that have not been recited. Similar to a if a man with good sight were to examine his own facial reflection in it, he would neither know nor see it as it really is
