# SN46.51 - Āhārasutta - Nutriment
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  describes how we can either "feed" or "starve" the wholesome and unwholesome tendencies in the mind according to how we apply our attention

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Give proper attention to unattractiveness to avoid sensual desire, love for ill will, energy and effort for sloth and topor, peacefulness of mind for restlessness, wholesome and unwholesome states to avoid uncertainty
> 
> Give proper attention to bases of mindfulness to feed it, to wholesome and unwholesome states for discrimination of states, endeavour for energy, bases of rapture to feed it, physical and mental serenity, themes for calm, themes for non-distractio for samadhi, and bases that feed equanimity
