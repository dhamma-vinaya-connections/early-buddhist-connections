# SN46.33 - Upakkilesasutta - Corruptions
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Hindrances sully the mind like impurities in gold or as some large trees with small seeds will overgrow and ruin other trees

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> These five corruptions of the mind, corrupted by which the mind is neither malleable nor wieldy nor radiant but brittle and not rightly concentrated for the destruction of the taints
> 
> These seven factors of enlightenment are nonobstructions, nonhindrances, noncorruptions of the mind; when developed and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberation
