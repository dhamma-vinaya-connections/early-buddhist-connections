# SN56.41 - Lokacintāsutta - Reflection about the World
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha tells the curious tale of a man who sat by a lotus pond to speculate about the world, and saw an army enter a lotus stalk. He thought he was going mad. The Buddha said that no, the army was real. Nevertheless, you should not speculate about such things, but should reflect on the four noble truths

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Do not reflect about the world and the undeclared points because that may drive you insane
> 
> Instead reflect on the 4 Noble Truths because is beneficial, relevant to the fundamentals of the holy life, and leads to revulsion, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.
