# SN56.31 - Sīsapāvanasutta - The Siṁsapa Grove
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha compares the knowledge he gained in his Awakening to all the leaves in the forest, and his teachings to a mere handful of leaves. He then explains why he didn't reveal the remainder.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> those things that I have known with direct knowledge but have not taught are far more numerous [than what I have taught
> 
> Because they are not connected with the goal, do not relate to the rudiments of the holy life, and do not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding
> 

> [!info] Similes
> handful of leaves compared to a leaves in the forest like 4 Noble Truths compared to Buddha's wisdom
