> [!info] Summary
> Just as it’s impossible to keep water in a basket of pine needles, it’s impossible to end suffering without penetrating the four noble truths.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Without having made the breakthrough to the noble truths is impossible to make an end to suffering
> 
> As long as there are no sun and moon, the world is in darkness. So too, as long as the Realized One has not arisen and declared the four noble truths, the world is in darkness
> 

> [!info] Similes
