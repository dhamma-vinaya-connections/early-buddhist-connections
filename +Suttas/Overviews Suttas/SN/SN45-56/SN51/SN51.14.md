# SN51.14 - Moggallānasutta - Moggallana
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When lazy monks were wasting time, the Buddha  asks Moggallāna to stir them up. He shakes with his toe the large building in which they were staying, terrifying the monks. They sought refuge in the Buddha , and he taught them the four bases of psychic power.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Monks are restless, insolent, fickle, gossipy, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with wandering mind and undisciplined faculties. Go, Moggallāna, and strike awe in those mendicants!
> 
> He thinks: ‘my inquiry won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.’ And he meditates perceiving continuity:  as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, he develops a mind that’s full of radiance.
