# SN47.14 - Ukkacelasutta - Ukkacela
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Ven. Ananda grieves over ven. Sariputta's death, and the Buddha  consoles him with dhamma: make the Dhamma your island, your true refuge! The Buddha  says the saṅgha looks empty; yet he is not sad.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Ānanda, when Sāriputta attained final nibbāna, did he take away your aggregate of virtue, samadhi, wisdom, liberation and knowledge and vision of freedom
> 
> Dwell with yourselves as your own island, with yourselves as your own refuge, with no other refuge; dwell with the Dhamma as your island, with the Dhamma as your refuge, with no other refuge
