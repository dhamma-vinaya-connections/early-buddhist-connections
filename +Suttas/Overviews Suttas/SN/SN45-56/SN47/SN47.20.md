# SN47.20 - Janapadakalyāṇīsutta - The Most Beautiful Girl of the Land
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A parable that sets up an impossible challenge: to walk between a popular performer and the crowd jostling to see her, carrying a bowl of oil filled to the brim, while a man with a drawn sword waits to chop off your head if you spill a drop. That’s mindfulness

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Bhikkhus, in order to convey a meaning. This here is the meaning: ‘the bowl of oil filled to the brim’: this is a designation for mindfulness directed to the body
> 
> Train yourselves thus: ‘we will develop and cultivate mindfulness directed to the body, make it our vehicle, make it our basis, stabilize it, exercise ourselves in it, and fully perfect it.’
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Dancing girl show simil, like importance of mindfulness
