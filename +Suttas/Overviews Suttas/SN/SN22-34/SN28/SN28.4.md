# SN28.4 - Upekkhāsutta - Equanimity
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Sāriputta goes to mirkwood for meditation, and afterwards Ānanda asks why his face is so radiant. Sāriputta replies that he was practicing all attainments until of cessation without any thought of self.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> 4 jhanas, sphere of infinity of space, consciousness, nothingness, neither perception nor non-perception and cessation of perception and feeling
> 
> It didn’t occur to me: ‘I am entering the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I have entered the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I am emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling’.” “that must be because venerable Sāriputta has long ago totally eradicated ego, possessiveness, and the underlying tendency to conceit.
