# SN22.38 - DutiyĀnandasutta - Ānanda (2)
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  speaks to Ānanda on what at an 3.47 described as the “characteristics of conditioned phenomena”: arising, ceasing, and change while persisting. This was to become a critical aspect of later theories on the nature of change. Ānanda explains in terms of the aggregates

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> With 5 aggregates arising is discerned, a vanishing is discerned, an alteration  of that which stands is discerned
> 
> An arising was discerned, a vanishing was discerned, an alteration of that which stands was discerned in past and in future an arising will be discerned, a vanishing will be discerned, an alteration of that which stands will be discerned
