> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Instead, agitation & clinging arise, and my intellect pulls back, thinking, 'but who, then, is my self?' But this thought doesn't occur to one who sees the dhamma
> 
> If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it detached; if he feels a painful feeling, he feels it detached; if he feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he feels it detached.
