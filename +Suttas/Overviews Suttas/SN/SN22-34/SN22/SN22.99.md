# SN22.99 - Gaddulabaddhasutta - The Leash (1)
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Transmigration has no knowable beginning; even the oceans, mountains, and this great earth will perish. But like a dog on a leash running around a post, beings remain attached to the aggregates

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> This saṃsāra is without discoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving
> 
> One should often reflect upon one’s own mind thus: ‘for a long time this mind has been defiled by lust, hatred, and delusion.’ Through the defilements of the mind beings are defiled; with the cleansing of the mind beings are purified
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Dog leashed to a post like beings fettered by craving to the aggregates
