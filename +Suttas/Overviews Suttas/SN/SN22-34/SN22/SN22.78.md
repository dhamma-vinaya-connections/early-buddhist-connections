# SN22.78 - Sīhasutta - The Lion
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When a lion emerges from its lair and roars, animals are terrified. Similarly, when the Buddha  teaches of the impermanence of the aggregates, even the gods are filled with fear. This is illustrated with a set of verses.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When the Buddha , through direct knowledge,
Sets in motion the wheel of dhamma,   the cessation of identity
And the origin of identity,
Also the noble eightfold path
That leads to suffering’s appeasement
> 
> Then those devas with long life spans,
Beautiful, ablaze with glory,
Are struck with fear, filled with terror.     We’ve not transcended identity;
>
