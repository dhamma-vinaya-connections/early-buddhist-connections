# SN22.45 - Aniccasutta - Impermanent (1)
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Seeing the five aggregates as impermanent, etc., leads to letting go of views and ultimately to freedom

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> 5 aggregates are impermanent, suffering and non self and should not be regarded as this is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.
> 
> The mind becomes dispassionate and is liberated from the taints by nonclinging.
