# SN22.21 - Ānandasutta - Ānanda
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Ānanda asks the Buddha  what exactly is meant when we say that things cease. The Buddha  explains it as the cessation of the aggregates.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Form, Ānanda, is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, to vanishing, to fading away, to cessation. Through its cessation, cessation is spoken of
> 
> The same for feelings, perceptions, fabrications and consciousness
