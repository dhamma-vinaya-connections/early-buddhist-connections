# SN22.95 - Pheṇapiṇḍūpamasutta - A Lump of Foam
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  invokes a series of vivid similes to illustrate the voidness of the five aggregates.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Physical form is like foam, feeling is like a bubble, perception is like a mirage, choices are like a coreless tree, and consciousness is like an illusion
> 
> Bhikkhu inspects them, ponders them, and carefully investigates them. As he investigates them, they appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Aggregates similes of insubstantial things
