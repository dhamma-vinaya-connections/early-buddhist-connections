# SN22.96 - Gomayapiṇḍasutta - A Lump of Cowdung
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A mendicant asks whether anything in the aggregates has even the tiniest bit of stability or permanence. The Buddha  answers using the simile of a little dirt under his fingernail

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> There are no aggregates that is constant, lasting, eternal, not subject to change, that will stay just as it is as long as eternity, thus this living of the holy life for the right ending of suffering & stress is discerned
> 
> In a past life, the Buddha  was a great king with vast properties, but all those conditions have passed away. It is enough,  to feel revulsion, to become dispassionate towards them, enough to be liberated from them.”
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Fingernail with soil and small lump of cow dung not even that is constant, pleasant nor myself
