# SN22.55 - Udānasutta - Inspired Utterance
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  utters an enigmatic saying that non-identification leads to cutting off the fetters. A mendicant asks how to achieve this.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Because of the disappearance of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that a mendicant who makes such a resolution— ‘it might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine’— can cut off the five lower fetters
> 
> An educated noble disciple doesn’t worry about things that aren’t a worry. For an educated noble disciple doesn’t worry: ‘it might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine
