# SN22.43 - Attadīpasutta - With Yourselves as an Island
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Dwell with yourself as an island and refuge, with the Dhamma as an island and refuge. How? By investigating how suffering arises from identification with the aggregates

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> One sees as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘in the past and also now all form is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change,’ then sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair are abandoned
> 
> With their abandonment, one does not become agitated. Being unagitated, one dwells happily. A bhikkhu who dwells happily is said to be quenched in that respect
