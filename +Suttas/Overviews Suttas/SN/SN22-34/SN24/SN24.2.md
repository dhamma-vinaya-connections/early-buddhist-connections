# SN24.2 - Etaṁmamasutta - This Is Mine
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The view of me and mine, that the self is identical with the cosmos, that “I might not be”, annihilationism, moral nihilism, that denies causality, transmigration is fixed,  all changing phenomena of the world are really still and motionless.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> “when form exists, because of grasping form and insisting on form,  feeling … perception … choices … consciousness what is seen, heard, thought, and known.   Views arises
> 
> By not grasping what’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable,  views won't  arise
