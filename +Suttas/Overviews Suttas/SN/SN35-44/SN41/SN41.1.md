# SN41.1 - Saṁyojanasutta - Fetter
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Citta the householder hears of a conversation among the monks regarding the distinction between the fetters and the things that are fettered. He goes to ask them on this topic, but they are unable to give a satisfactory answer, so he explained it to them. It is desire that is the fetter, like the yoke that binds two oxen.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The 6 sense internal and external are things prone to being fettered. the desire and lust that arises there in dependence on both: that is the fetter
> 
> The ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’: these things differ in both meaning and phrasing
