# SN41.7 - Godattasutta - Godatta
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Venerable godatta asks Citta whether the liberations of measurelessness, nothingness, emptiness, and signlessness are different states, or just different words for the same thing. Citta explains that they are both: they are terms for different meditation experiences, but may also be used of perfection or arahantship

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Liberations could be  measurelessness are 4 sublime abodes,  the sphere of nothingness, emptiness of self and signlessness is not focusing on any signs
> 
> Greed, hate, and delusion are makers of limits, are something, makers of signs. And the unshakable heart’s release is said to be the best kind of liberation
