# SN42.7 - Khettūpamasutta - The Simile of the Field
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The chief asibandhakaputta asks the Buddha  why, if he has equal compassion for all, he teaches some more than others. The Buddha  answers with a simile of a field: a farmer knows to put most of their effort into the fertile land.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> I teach Dhamma in good and average fields first.monks and nuns are like the good field, laymen and laywomen are like the average field, because they live with me as their island, protection, shelter, and refuge
> 
> And lastly to ascetics, brahmins, and wanderers who follow other paths are like the poor field, hopefully they might understand even a single sentence, which would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Fields good, average and bad to plant seeds , like types of persons to teach the dhamma
