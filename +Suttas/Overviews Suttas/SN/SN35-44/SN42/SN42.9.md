# SN42.9 - Kulasutta - Families
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Mahāvīra asks asibandhakaputta to refute the Buddha  on behalf of the jains. He suggests to try to trap the Buddha  with a dilemma: he claims to have compassion for householders, yet visits them with a large saṅgha in a time of scarcity. But the Buddha  says no family has been harmed from this.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> downfall because of kings, thieves, fire,water, stored-up treasure disappears, or their mismanaged undertakings go wrong, or in the family a wastrel, or impermanence
> 
> I do not know any family to have been brought to downfall through the giving of cooked alms. On the contrary: whatever families are rich, from giving, from truth, from restraint.
