# SN42.11 - Bhadrakasutta - Bhadraka
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The chief bhadraka asks the Buddha  about the origin and ending of suffering, and the Buddha  points out that a loss among bhadraka’s own community would cause him suffering, due to his attachment.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Whatever stress, in arising, arose for me in the past, all of it had desire as its root, had desire as its cause — for desire is the cause of stress.
> 
> And whatever stress, in arising, will arise for me in the future, all of it will have desire as the root, will have desire as its cause — for desire is the cause of stress
