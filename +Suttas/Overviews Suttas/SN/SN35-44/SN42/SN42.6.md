# SN42.6 - Asibandhakaputtasutta - Asibandhakaputta
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The chief asibandhakaputta asks whether the rituals advocated by the western brahmins can bring a person to heaven. The Buddha  asserts that only good deeds can take you to a good rebirth, and rituals have no effect.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Any man who takes life, steals, indulges in illicit sex; is a liar, one who speaks divisive speech, harsh speech, & idle chatter; is greedy, bears thoughts of ill-will, & holds to wrong views
> 
> Even though a great crowd of people, gathering, saying,] 'may this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, — still, at the break-up of the body, after death, he would reappear in destitution, a bad destination
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Rocks sink into water, like wrongdoers go to hell; oil rise above water like good people go to heaven
