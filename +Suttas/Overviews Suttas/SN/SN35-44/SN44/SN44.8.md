# SN44.8 - Vacchagottasutta - Vacchagotta
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  takes no position on the ten speculative views because he does not identify any of the five aggregates as "self."

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The Buddha  hasn't declared if tathāgata exist after death, doesn't exist, both, neither; world is or not eternal, is or not infinite; soul and the body are or not the same,
> 
> He does not assume form to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or form as in the self, or the self as in form. Nor feelings, perceptions, fabrications or consciousness
