# SN44.10 - Ānandasutta - Ānanda Is There a Self?
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Why the Buddha  did not take a position on the question of whether or not there is a self.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> If being asked by vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self — were to answer that there is a self, would that be in keeping with the arising of knowledge that all phenomena are not-self
> 
> If I — being asked by if there is no self — were to answer that there is no self, the bewildered vacchagotta would become even more bewildered: 'does the self I used to have now not exist?'"
