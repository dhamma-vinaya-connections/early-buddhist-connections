## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Questions regarding the fate of the tathagata do not arise in those who no longer take delight in the aggregates, in clinging, in becoming, or in craving.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The Buddha  hasn't declared if tathāgata exist after death, doesn't exist, both, neither
> 
> One who doesn't love,  isn't fond  doesn't cherish the aggregates, existence, craving nor clinging  , who knows & sees, as it actually is present, their cessation, doesn't think this questions
