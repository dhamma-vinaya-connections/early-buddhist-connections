# SN36.21 - Sīvakasutta - Sivaka
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  explains that present experience cannot be described solely in terms of the results of past actions (kamma).

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Feelings can originate from bile, phlegm, and also wind,
Imbalance and climate too,
Carelessness and assault,
With kamma result as the eighth.
> 
> Don't slip past what they themselves know, slip past what is agreed on by the world
