# SN35.80 - Dutiyaavijjāpahānasutta - Abandoning Ignorance (2)
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Through giving up ignorance, knowledge arises. To do this, contemplate the six senses as impermanent. Then a mendicant truly understands, and sees everything differently

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When a mendicant has heard that nothing is worth clinging on to, they directly know all things
> 
> Completely understanding all things, they see all signs as other. They see the eye, sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact as other. And they also see the pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by eye contact as other
