# SN35.246 - Vīṇopama - Simile Of The Harp
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> One should restrain the senses like a farmer watching over a field. The Buddha  gives the parable of a man bewitched when he first hears a lute. He takes apart the instrument in search of the sound, but is disillusioned when no sound is found.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When a monk's mind is held back, thoroughly held back, from the six media of sensory contact, his mind settles inwardly, grows steady, unified, & concentrated
> 
> As he is investigating form... feeling... perception... fabrications... consciousness, however far consciousness may go, any thoughts of 'me' or 'mine' or 'i am' do not occur to him
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Lute examined by king in all its components, like a meditator examines the 5 aggregates looking for self.    And watchman of barley field drive the bull away, like mindfulness and guarding the senses
