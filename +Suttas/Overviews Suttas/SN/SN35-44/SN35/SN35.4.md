# SN35.4 - Bāhirāniccasutta - External as Impermanent
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> In the past, future, and present, the six exterior sense fields are impermanent, suffering, and not-self. When a noble disciple truly sees them like this, they become disillusioned and liberated.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts of present, past and future are impermanent, suffering and not self and should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘this is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
> 
> Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed
