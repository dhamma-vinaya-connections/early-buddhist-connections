# SN35.241 - Dārukkhandhopama - Simile Of The Log
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  gives a parable of a large log floating downstream, which, if it steers clear of the many obstacles, will eventually reach the ocean. A cowherd named nanda was listening, and determined to go forth.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> If you do not veer towards the shores, do not sink in, do not get cast up on high ground, do not get caught by human  nor  by nonhuman beings, do not get caught in a whirlpool, and do not become inwardly rotten, you will  slope, and incline towards nibbāna
> 
> Because right view slants, slopes, and inclines towards nibbāna
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Log  being carried along by the current of the river, if avoid all dangers will get to the ocean, like a bhikkhu if avoid all dangers will reach nibbana
