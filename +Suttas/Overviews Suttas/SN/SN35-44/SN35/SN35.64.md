# SN35.64 - Dutiyamigajālasutta - Migajala (2)
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Venerable migajāla asks how one lives alone, and how with a partner. The Buddha  says that so long as one is bound by desire to the senses, one lives with a partner. A mendicant free of such desire dwells alone, even if they live in close association with worldly people

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Bound by  delight in the 6 senses, craving is his partner, and he has not abandoned it; therefore he is called one dwelling with a partner
> 
> Even though a bhikkhu who dwells thus lives in the vicinity of a village, associating with bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs, with male and female lay followers
