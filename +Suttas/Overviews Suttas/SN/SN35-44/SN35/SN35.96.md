# SN35.96 - Parihānadhammasutta - Decline
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When a mendicant tolerates evil thoughts that arise from the senses, they are liable to decline. If they don’t tolerate them, they’re not liable to decline. When such thoughts not longer arise, they have mastered the senses

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Seen a form with the eye, there arise in him evil unwholesome states, memories and intentions connected with the fetters. If the bhikkhu does not tolerate them, but abandons them,  he should understand this thus: ‘I am not declining away from wholesome states
> 
> He has mastered the senses when there do not arise in him evil unwholesome states, nor any memories and intentions connected with the fetters with any sense contact
