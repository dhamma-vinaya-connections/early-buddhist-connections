# SN35.244 - Dukkhadhamma - Suffering Entailing
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  defines the things that entail suffering as the five aggregates, and urges mendicants to be free of desire for the six senses, giving a series of vivid similes. He then speaks of how even for a mendicant practicing restraint a lapse of mindfulness might occur from time to time.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When one understands as they really are the origin and the passing away of all states whatsoever that entail suffering, then sensual passion do not lie latent within him in regard to sensual pleasures
> 
> Then he has comprehended a mode of conduct and manner of dwelling in such a way that as he conducts himself thus and as he dwells thus, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and displeasure do not flow in upon him
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Man thrown into charcoal pit with glowing coals, like sensual desire.     And thorny forest that need to go through with mindfulness like the world of senses.     And drops of water fall onto a hot iron plate quickly evaporate, like a trainee lapse of mindfulness but quickly recovers it
