# SN35.71 - Paṭhamachaphassāyatanasutta - The Six Bases for Contact (1)
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> One who does not understand the six senses’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape is no true mendicant. A mendicant speaks up, saying that he does not truly understand these things, so the Buddha  teaches him further.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Understand as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape, in the case of these six bases for contact
> 
> Dont regard the 6 sense bases thus: ‘this is mine, this I am, this is my self
>
