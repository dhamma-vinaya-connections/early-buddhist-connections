# SN35.93 - Dutiyadvayasutta - The Dyad (2)
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Consciousness arises from the dyad of the interior sense organ with its corresponding exterior sense stimulus. All these things are conditioned, impermanent, and constantly falling apart.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Dualities are the eye and forms, the ear and sounds, the nose and odours, the tongue and tastes, the body and tactile objects, the mind and mental phenomena, consciousness comes to be in dependence on that
> 
> Contacted, bhikkhus, one feels, contacted one intends, contacted one perceives. Thus these things too are moving and tottering, impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise.
