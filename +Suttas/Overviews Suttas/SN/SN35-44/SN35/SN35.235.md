# SN35.235 - Ādittapariyāya - Exposition On Burning
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> It would be better for the sense organs to be pierced with red-hot spikes than to get attached to a pleasant sense experience

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> If consciousness should stand tied to gratification in the sign or in the features, and if one should die on that occasion, one may go to bad destinations
> 
> So it would be better  lacerating the senses faculties with a sharp razor burning, blazing, but even better to contemplate them as impermanent
