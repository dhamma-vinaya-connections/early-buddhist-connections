# SN35.113 - Upassutisutta - Listening In
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The origin and ending of suffering and the world  are explained in terms of sense experience giving rise to craving

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> “eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. … that is how this entire mass of suffering originates
> 
> When that craving fades away and ceases with nothing left over, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. … that is how this entire mass of suffering ceases
