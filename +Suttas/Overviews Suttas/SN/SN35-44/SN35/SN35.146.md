# SN35.146 - Kammanirodha - Cessation Of Karma
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  explains how the results of "old" kamma (the actions we performed in the past) and "new" kamma (the ones we perform now) are both experienced in the present.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> 6 senses are old kamma, to be seen as generated and fashioned by volition, as something to be felt. Whatever action one does now by body, speech, or mind. This is new kamma
> 
> When one reaches liberation through the cessation of bodily action, verbal action, and mental action, this is the cessation of kamma and the noble path is the way
