# SN35.116 - Lokantagamanasutta - Going to the End of the World
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  states that the end of the world cannot be reached by traveling, yet it is impossible to end suffering without reaching the end of the world. The mendicants ask Ānanda to explain this enigmatic statement

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The end of the world cannot be known, seen, or reached by travelling. Yet, bhikkhus, I also say that without reaching the end of the world there is no making an end to suffering
> 
> The 6 senses are that in the world by which one is a perceiver of the world, a conceiver of the world—this is called the world in the noble one’s discipline
