# SN35.97 - Pamādavihārīsutta - Dwelling Negligently
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When a mendicant lives without restraint regarding the senses, they are negligent. If they have restraint, they are diligent. Non-restraint is delighting in the senses, restraint is not delighting in them

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> If one dwells with restraint over the 6 senses the mind is not soiled,  gladness arise,  then rapture,  then tranquility,  samadhi and phenomena become manifest
> 
> Sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a bhikkhu does not seek delight in them, does not welcome them, and does not remain holding to them, he should understand this thus: ‘I am not declining away from wholesome states. For this has been called nondecline
