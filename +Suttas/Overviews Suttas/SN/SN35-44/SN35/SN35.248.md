# SN35.248 - Yavakalāpi - Sheaf Of Barley
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The six senses are like a sheaf of barley struck with six flails; and the desire for rebirth is a seventh flail. The Buddha  goes on to speak of the cunning trap of the gods; but the trap of Māra, conceit, is even more subtle

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> But even subtler than that is the bondage of māra. In conceiving, one is bound by māra; by not conceiving, one is freed from the evil one
> 
> I am', i am this', i shall be, i shall not be'... 'i shall be possessed of form'... 'i shall not be possessed of form'... 'i shall be percipient'... 'i shall not be percipient'... 'i shall be neither percipient nor non-percipient' is an act of conceit
