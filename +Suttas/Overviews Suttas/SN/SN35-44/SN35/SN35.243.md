# SN35.243 - Avassutapariyāya - Corruptions Explanation
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  is invited to teach in a new hall in kapilavatthu. Late at night, after teaching the sakyans, the Buddha  invites Moggallāna to teach. He speaks on the mental corruption that flows from attachment to the senses.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> One is uncorrupted if perceiving any of 6 senses is not intent upon a pleasing one and not repelled by a displeasing one, is not overpowered by them
> 
> He dwells having set up mindfulness of the body, with a measureless mind, and he understands as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, wherein those evil unwholesome states cease without remainder
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Torch thrown to dry grass like unguarded senses or thrown to a secure house like guarded senses
