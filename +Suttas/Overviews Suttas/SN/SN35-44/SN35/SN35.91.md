# SN35.91 - Dutiyaejāsutta - Being Stirred (2)
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Being stirred by craving is painful, so the realized one lives unstirred, not identifying with any aspect of sense experience, or indeed, with the entire scope of the aggregates, elements, and senses

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The aggregates, the elements, and the sense bases, he does not conceive that, does not conceive in that, does not conceive from that, does not conceive, ‘that is mine.
> 
> For whatever one conceives, bhikkhus, whatever one conceives in, [67] whatever one conceives from, whatever one conceives as ‘mine’—that is otherwise. The world, becoming otherwise, attached to existence, seeks delight only in existence
