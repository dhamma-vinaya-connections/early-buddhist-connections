# SN35.117 - Kāmaguṇasutta - Cords of Sensual Pleasure
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> While practicing for awakening, the Buddha  reflected that he should be diligent when his mind strayed to sense pleasures of the past, future, or present. He urges the mendicants to realize that place where the senses completely cease, and they ask Ānanda to explain this to them

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Being set on my own welfare, I should practise diligence, mindfulness, and guarding of the mind in regard to those five cords of sensual pleasure that have already left their impression on the heart, which have passed, ceased, and changed
> 
> The cessation of the six sense bases is where the mind ceases and perception of mental phenomena fades away. That base should be understood
>
