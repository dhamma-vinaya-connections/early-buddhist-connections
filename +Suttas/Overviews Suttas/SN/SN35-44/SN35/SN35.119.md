# SN35.119 - Pañcasikhasutta - Pañcasikha
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A mendicant who craves the senses is under the sway of Māra, that is why some become awakened in this very life, while others do not.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> If a bhikkhu seeks delight in the 6 senses welcomes them, and remains holding to them, he has come under māra’s control
> 
> Who remains holding to them, his consciousness becomes dependent upon them and clings to them. A bhikkhu with clinging does not attain nibbāna
