# SN35.121 - Rāhulovādasutta - Exhortation to Rahula
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Realizing that his son rāhula was ripe for awakening, the Buddha  takes him for a personal teaching. He questions rāhula on the impermanence of all the factors of sense experience, leading rāhula to realize full freedom.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Internal and external senses, their-consciousness and -contact and anything included in feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness arisen with -contact as condition is impermanent
> 
> Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion [his mind] is liberated. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘it’s liberated.’ He understands: ‘destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being
