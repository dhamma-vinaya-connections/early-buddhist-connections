# SN35.136 - Paṭhamarūpārāmasutta - Delight in Forms (1)
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Gods and humans take delight in the six sense, but the realized one does not. This teaching is illustrated with a long series of verses.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> In all the world with its gods, This is reckoned as happiness. And where they cease This is reckoned as suffering.
> 
> The noble ones have seen that happiness Is the cessation of identity. Those who see Contradict the whole world.
>
