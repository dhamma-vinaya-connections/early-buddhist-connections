# SN35.95 - Mālukyaputtasutta - Malunkyaputta
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  wonders how to teach an old monk like him, then questions him on his desire for sense experience that has been or might be, and encourages him to simply let sense experience be. Māluṅkyaputta says he understands, and expands the Buddha ’s teaching in a series of verses.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> In the seen there will be merely the seen; in the heard there will be merely the heard; in the sensed there will be merely the sensed; in the cognized there will be merely the cognized
> 
> One fares mindfully in such a way
That even as one sees the form,
And while one undergoes a feeling,
[suffering] is exhausted, not built up.
For one dismantling suffering thus,
Nibbāna is said to be close
