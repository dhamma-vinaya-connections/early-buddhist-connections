# SN35.233 - Kamabhū - Kamabhū
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Ven. Sariputta explains to ven. Maha kotthita that our problem lies neither in the senses themselves nor in the objects to which the senses cling. Suffering comes from the passion that arises in dependence on both

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The interior and exterior sense fields are not  the fetters of each other, desire & passion arises in dependence on the two of them: that is the fetter there
> 
> The blessed one sees forms with the eye. There is no desire or passion in the blessed one. The blessed one is well-released in mind.

> Oxen yoke, like the fetters
