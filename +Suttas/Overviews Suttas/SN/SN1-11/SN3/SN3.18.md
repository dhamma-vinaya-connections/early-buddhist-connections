# SN3.18 - Kalyāṇamittasutta - Diligence (2)
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> In answer to pasenadi’s praise of good friendship, the Buddha  recounts an earlier conversation with āNanda on the topic. He then goes on to say that when one has good friends, it is important to develop diligence

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> By relying on me as a good friend, sentient beings who are liable to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are freed from all these things.
> 
> When you have good friends, companions, and associates, you should live supported by one thing: diligence in skillful qualities
