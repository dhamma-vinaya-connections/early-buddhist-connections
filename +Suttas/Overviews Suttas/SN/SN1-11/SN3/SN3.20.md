# SN3.20 - Dutiyaaputtakasutta - Childless (2)
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A wealthy man dies childless, having not enjoyed his riches. The Buddha  says that wealth should be properly enjoyed and shared

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Cool water in a desolate place
Evaporates without being drunk,
So when a scoundrel acquires wealth
He neither enjoys himself nor gives
> 
> One should do what is good
As a collection for the future life.
Merits are the support for living beings
[when they arise] in the other world.
