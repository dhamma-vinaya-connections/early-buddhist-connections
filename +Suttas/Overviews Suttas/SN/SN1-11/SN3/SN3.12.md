# SN3.12 - Pañcarājasutta - Five Kings
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Five kings including pasenadi are enjoying themselves and wonder which of the senses affords the highest pleasure. They ask the Buddha , who replies that it is subjective, depending on a persons preferences

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Which kind of sensual stimulation is best is defined by which is most agreeable, I say. The very same sights that are agreeable to some are disagreeable to others
> 
> When you’re happy with certain sights, as you’ve got all you wished for, you don’t want any other sight that’s better or finer. For you, those sights are perfect and supreme
