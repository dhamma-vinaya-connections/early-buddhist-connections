# SN7.13 - Devahitasutta - Devahita
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  is ill and sends his attendant monk upavāṇa to fetch some hot water. A brahmin gives him not just water, but also molasses to ease his stomach. Later the brahmin visits the Buddha  to discuss generosity

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> One who has known his past abodes,
Who sees heaven and the plane of woe,
Who has reached the destruction of birth,
A sage consummate in direct knowledge
> 
> Here one should give a proper gift,
Here a gift bears great fruit.
That’s how, for one bestowing alms,
An offering brings success
>
