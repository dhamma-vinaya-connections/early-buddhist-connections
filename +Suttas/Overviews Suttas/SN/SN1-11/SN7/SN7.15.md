# SN7.15 - Mānatthaddhasutta - Manatthaddha
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A stuck-up brahmin listening to the Buddha  teach is awestruck when the Buddha  appears to read his mind. To the surprise of the crowd, he bows and kisses the Buddha ’s feet. The Buddha  tells him to take his seat, and they exchange verses on the topic of conceit

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The fostering of conceit is never good
For one keen on his welfare, brahmin.
You should instead foster that purpose
Because of which you’ve come here.
> 
> 691 “first one’s own mother and father,
Then one’s eldest family brother,
Then one’s teacher as the fourth:
Towards these one should avoid conceit
