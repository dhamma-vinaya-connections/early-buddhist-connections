# SN7.19 - Mātuposakasutta - Mother Supporter
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A touching glimpse into the sorrow that a father feels when his ungrateful children fail to honor him in his old age. Treat your parents well.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Those at whose birth I took delight
And whose success I much desired,
Being instigated by their wives,
Chase me out as dogs chase swine
> 
> When a mortal righteously supports his parents,
Because of this service to them
The wise praise him here in this world,
And after death he rejoices in heaven.
