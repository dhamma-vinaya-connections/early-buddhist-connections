# SN7.20 - Bhikkhakasutta - Mendicant
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Some brahmin students are collecting firewood when they see the Buddha  in meditation. They return and inform their teacher, who visits the Buddha  to ask him how he is so peaceful in the wild forest

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> I'm devoid of attachment, longing, or thirst,
And see clearly amidst all phenomena.
Having gained the sublime, highest awakening,
I meditate, priest, in ripened seclusion
> 
> One here who leads the holy life,
Having expelled merit and evil,
Who fares in the world with comprehension:
He is truly called a bhikkhu
