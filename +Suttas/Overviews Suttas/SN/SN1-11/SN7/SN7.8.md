# SN7.8 - Aggikasutta - Aggika
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A brahmin asks the Buddha ’s caste, but the Buddha  argues that conduct is the important thing, not caste. The Buddha  gives a metaphorical reinterpretation of the elements of brahmanical ritual.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Even one who mutters many invocations
Is no brahmin by birth
If they’re filthy and corrupt within,
With a following gained by fraud
> 
> Don’t ask about birth, ask about conduct.
For any wood can surely generate fire.
A steadfast sage, even though from a low class family,
Is a thoroughbred checked by conscience.
