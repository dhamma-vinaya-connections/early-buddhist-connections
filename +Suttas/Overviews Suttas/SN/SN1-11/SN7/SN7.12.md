# SN7.12 - Udayasutta - Udaya
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A brahmin complains when the Buddha  visits for alms again and again. The Buddha  takes the chance to point out that all natural phenomena repeat in cycles, and only an awakened one escapes the cycle

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Over and over, he tires and he struggles;
Over and over, the fool goes to the womb.
Over and over, he's born and he dies;
Over and over, they bear him to his grave
> 
> But one who's wisdom is wide as the earth
Is not born over and over,
For he's gained the path
Of not becoming over again
>
