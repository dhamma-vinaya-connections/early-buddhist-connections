# SN9.4 - Sambahulasutta - A Number
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A monk named kassapagotta encounters a hunter in the forest and tries to dissuade him from his violent purpose. But a deity warns him not to waste his time

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The tribal hunter listens without understanding,
He looks without seeing.
Though the teaching is spoken,
The fool doesn’t get it
> 
> You’ve left for the jungle, the root of a tree,
With quenching in your heart.
Practice absorption, gotama, don’t be negligent
>
