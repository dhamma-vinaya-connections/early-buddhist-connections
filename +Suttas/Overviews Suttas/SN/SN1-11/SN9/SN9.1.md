# SN9.1 - Vivekasutta - Seclusion
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A monk in the forest lets his mind drift to thoughts of the lay life, but is warned by a local deity

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Sensual pleasures are impermanent and unstable,
But idiots still fall for them
> 
> Just as a bird strewn with dirt
Sheds that clingy dust with a shake;
So too, an energetic, mindful mendicant
Sheds that clingy dust with a shake
>
