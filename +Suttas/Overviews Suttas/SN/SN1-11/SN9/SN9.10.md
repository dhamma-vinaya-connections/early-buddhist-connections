# SN9.10 - Sajjhāyasutta - Reciting
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When a mendicant gives up their habit of reciting the texts, a deity questions them. But it seems they have now found peace

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When you hear the teaching confidence grows;
And the reciter is praised in the present life
> 
> But then I realized dispassion, which the good call
The laying to rest by completely understanding
Whatever is seen, heard, and thought
>
