# SN5.9 - Selāsutta - Sela
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Māra asks the nun vajirā about who has created this being. Recognizing him, she points out that the word “being” is nothing more than a convention used to designate the aggregates, just as the word “cart” is used when the parts are assembled

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Aggregates and elements
And these six sense fields
Come to be because of a cause,
And cease when the cause breaks up
> 
> When the parts are assembled
We use the word ‘chariot’.
So too, when the aggregates are present
‘sentient being’ is the convention we use
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Chariots concepts like beings concepts
