# SN5.7 - Upacālāsutta - Upacala
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Māra asks the nun cālā why she disapproves of rebith. She replies that it necessarily entails suffering

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Death comes to those who are born,
When you’re born you undergo sufferings
All the world is on fire,

> But there is one born in the sakyan clan,
The unrivaled Buddha ,
Everywhere freed, and unattached,
The all-seeing seer.
He has attained the end of all deeds
