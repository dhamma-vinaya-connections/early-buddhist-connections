# SN5.2 - Somāsutta - Soma
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When meditating in the dark wood, the nun somā is taunted by Māra, who claims that a mere woman can never see the subtle truth. She rejects him, stating that gender does not matter when one is perceiving deep truths, and telling Māra to go see those still attached to gender.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> What difference does womanhood make
When the mind is serene,
And knowledge is present
As you rightly discern the dhamma
> 
> What you call sensual delight
Has become no delight for me.
Relishing is destroyed in every respect,
This body is foul,
Decaying and fragile.
I’m horrified and repelled by it,
I’m the master of my own mind,
I’ve developed the bases of psychic power well.
I’m free from all bonds,
>
