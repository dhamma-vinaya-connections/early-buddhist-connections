# SN4.13 - Sakalikasutta - The Splinter
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  rests after being struck by stone splinters, and Māra criticizes him for being lazy.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> I do not lie in a daze or drunk on poetry;
Having reached the goal, I am rid of sorrow.
Alone in a secluded lodging
I lie down full of compassion for all beings
> 
> I do not lie awake in dread,
Nor am I afraid to sleep.
The nights and days do not afflict me,
I see for myself no decline in the world.
Therefore I can sleep in peace
>
