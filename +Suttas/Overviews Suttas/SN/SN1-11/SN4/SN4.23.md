# SN4.23 - Godhikasutta - Godhika
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Venerable godhika finds himself repeatedly falling away from his meditation attainments due to severe illness. Eventually he considers suicide, and Māra tries to get the Buddha  to deter him. But the Buddha  says godhika has already attained awakening and has died blamelessly.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Above, below, and across,
In the four quarters and in between,
I have been searching but do not find
Where godhika has gone
> 
> Such indeed is how the steadfast act:
They are not attached to life. <267>
Having drawn out craving with its root,
Godhika has attained final nibbāna
>
