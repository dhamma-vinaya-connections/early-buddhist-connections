# SN4.25 - Māradhītusutta - Māra's Daughters
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Depressed, Māra laments to his three daughters of his failure to distract the Buddha . So they take on the task themselves, and assume a variety of sensuous forms to tempt him. But they fail too, and Māra castigates them for being so presumptuous

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Māra’s daughters—taṇhā, aratī, and ragā—approached the blessed one and said to him: “we serve at your feet, ascetic.” But the blessed one paid no attention, as he was liberated in the unsurpassed extinction of acquisitions
> 
> Tranquil in body, in mind well liberated,
Not generating, mindful, homeless,
Knowing dhamma, meditating thought-free,
He does not erupt, or drift, or stiffen
>
