# SN4.24 - Sattavassānubandhasutta - Seven Years of Pursuit
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Māra has tried to distract the Buddha  for seven years without success. He laments his failure with the similes of a crab whose limbs are smashed by a group of children, and a crow who tried to eat a stone.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Having dug up entirely the root of sorrow,
Guiltless, I meditate free from sorrow.
Having cut off all greedy urge for existence,317
I meditate taintless, o kinsman of the negligent
> 
> Those people going to the far shore
Ask what lies beyond death’s realm.
When asked, I explain to them
The truth without acquisitions.
