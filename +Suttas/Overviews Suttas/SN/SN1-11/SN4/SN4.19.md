# SN4.19 - Kassakasutta - Farmer
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> While the mendicants are listening to the teachings, Māra takes the form of an ox and looks as if he will break their almsbowls and Māra makes an awful roar to distract them.and Māra takes the form of a farmer looking for lost oxen and addresses the Buddha .

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> That of which they say ‘it’s mine,’
And those who speak in terms of ‘mine’—
If your mind exists among these,
You won’t escape me,
> 
> Form, feeling, and perception,
Consciousness, and formations—
‘I am not this, this isn’t mine,’forms, sounds, tastes, odours,
Tactiles, and all mental objects:
This is the terrible bait of the world
With which the world is infatuated.
Thus one is detached from it
