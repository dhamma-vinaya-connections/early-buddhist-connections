# SN4.22 - Samiddhisutta - Samiddhi
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Māra approaches some young mendicants as an old brahmin, and tries to tempt them with talk of the pleasures of youth

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> How could a person incline to sensual pleasures
Who has seen the source whence suffering springs?
Having known acquisition as a tie in the world,
A person should train for its removal.
> 
> I have gone forth out of faith
From the home to the homeless life.
My mindfulness and wisdom are mature,
And my mind well concentrated.
Conjure up whatever forms you wish,
But you will never make me tremble.
