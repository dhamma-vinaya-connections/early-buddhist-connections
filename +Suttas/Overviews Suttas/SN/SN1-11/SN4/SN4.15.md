# SN4.15 - Mānasasutta - Mental
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Māra smashes boulders in an attempt to scare the Buddha  and threatens the Buddha  with a “mental snare” in the sky.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Even if you make this vulture peak
Quake all over in its entirety,
The enlightened are not perturbed,
For they are are fully liberated.
> 
> Forms, sounds, tastes, odours,
And delightful tactile objects—
Desire for these has vanished in me:
You’re defeated, end-maker
