# SN4.20 - Rajjasutta - Rulership
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  wonders whether it is possible to rule justly, without violence. Māra appears and encourages the Buddha  to purse such a path.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Venerable sir, let the blessed one exercise rulership righteously
> 
> How could a person incline to sensual pleasures
Who has seen the source whence suffering springs?
Having known acquisition as a tie in the world,
A person should train for its removal
