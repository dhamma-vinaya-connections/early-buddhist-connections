# SN2.29 - Susimasutta - Susīma
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  asks āNanda if he likes sāriputta, and when he replies that he does, the god susīma and his assembly appear, rejoicing in sāriputta’s praises, and radiating in lustrous colors.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> He is widely known to be a wise man,
Sāriputta, who is free of anger;
Of few wishes, gentle, tamed,
Developed, well tamed, he awaits the time.
> 
> He gives advice, one who accepts advice, a reprover, one who censures evil
