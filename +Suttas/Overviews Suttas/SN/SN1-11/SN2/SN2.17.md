# SN2.17 - Subrahmasutta - Subrahma
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The deity vasudatta says that a mendicant should live like their hair is on fire so as to give up lust. The Buddha  changes his verse to emphasize giving up attachment to self

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Life is swept along, short is the life span;
No shelters exist for one who has reached old age.
Seeing clearly this danger in death,
A seeker of peace should drop the world’s bait.
> 
> Delight comes to one who is miserable,
Misery to one filled with delight.
As a bhikkhu undelighted, untroubled:
That’s how you should know me, friend
>
