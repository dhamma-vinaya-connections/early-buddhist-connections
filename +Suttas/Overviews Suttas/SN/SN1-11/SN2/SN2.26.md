# SN2.26 - Rohitassasutta - Rohitassa
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A well-traveled deva learns that we don't have to go to the ends of the world to find an end to suffering; we need look no further than right here, in this very body

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The world’s end can never be reached
By means of travelling [through the world],
Yet without reaching the world’s end
There is no release from suffering
> 
> It is in this fathom-high carcass endowed with perception and mind that I make known the world, the origin of the world, the cessation of the world, and the way leading to the cessation of the world.
