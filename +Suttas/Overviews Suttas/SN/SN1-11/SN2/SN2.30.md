# SN2.30 - Nānātitthiyasāvaka - Various Sectarians
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A series of deities who had formerly been ascetics in the non-buddhist sects came to the Buddha , speaking verses in praise—or occasional criticism—of their former teachers

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Whatever forms exist here or beyond,
And those of luminous beauty in the sky,
All these, indeed, you praise, namuci,
Like bait thrown out for catching
> 
> The ocean is the best body of water,
The moon, the best of nocturnal lights, <156>
But in this world together with its devas
The Buddha  is declared supreme
