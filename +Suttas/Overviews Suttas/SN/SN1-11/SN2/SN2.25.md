# SN2.25 - Jantusutta - Jantu
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Some monks in kosala fell into negligence, and were admonished by the deity jantu

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The disciples of gotama.
Without wishes they sought their alms,
Without wishes they used their lodgings.
Having known the world’s impermanence,
They made an end to suffering
> 
> But now like headmen in a village
They make themselves hard to maintain.
They eat and eat and then lie down, <142>
Infatuated in others’ homes
>
