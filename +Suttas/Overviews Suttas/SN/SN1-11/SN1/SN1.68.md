# SN1.68 - Pihitasutta - Shut In
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The world is afflicted with death and old age, and burning with desire

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The world is ensnared by craving;
It is enveloped by old age;
The world is shut in by death;
The world is established on suffering
> 
> By desire is the world bound;
By the removal of desire it is freed.
Desire is what one must forsake <92>
To cut off all bondage.
