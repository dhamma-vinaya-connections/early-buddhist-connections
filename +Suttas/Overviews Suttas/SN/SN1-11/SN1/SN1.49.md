# SN1.49 - Maccharisutta - Stingy
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  is asked about the future destiny of people who are stingy and those who are generous.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Those who are stingy here in the world,
Niggardly folk, revilers,
People who create obstacles
For others engaged in giving alms:
They might be reborn in bad place
> 
> Those here who, on gaining the human state,
Are amiable and generous,
Confident in the Buddha  and the dhamma
And deeply respectful towards the saṅgha,
These brighten up the heavens
