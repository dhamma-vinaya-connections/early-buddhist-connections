# SN1.25 - Arahantasutta - The Arahant
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> If a perfected one has gone beyond all sense of self, would they still refer to themselves as “I”?

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Person has transcended identity,
They’d still say, ‘I speak’,
And also ‘they speak to me’
> 
> Skillful, understanding the world’s conventions,
They’d use these terms as no more than expressions.”
