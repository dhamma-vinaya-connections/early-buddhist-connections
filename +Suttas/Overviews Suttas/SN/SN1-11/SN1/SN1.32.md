# SN1.32 - Maccharisutta - Stinginess
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A series of deities give verses praising generosity, and the Buddha  gives his own response, saying that practice of the Dhamma goes beyond this

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A hundred thousand people making a thousand sacrifices Isn’t worth a fraction Of one who lives rightly, wandering for gleanings, Or one who supports their partner from what little they have
> 
> It’s true that giving is praised in many ways But the path of the teaching is better than giving, For in days old and older still, The wise and virtuous even attained extinction
>
