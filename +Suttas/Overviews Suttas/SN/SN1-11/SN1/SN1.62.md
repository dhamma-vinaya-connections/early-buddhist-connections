# SN1.62 - Cittasutta - Mind
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The mind leads the world around and craving controls it

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The world is led around by mind;
By mind it’s dragged here and there.
Mind is the one thing that has
All under its control.
> 
> The world is held in bondage by delight;
Thought is its means of travelling about.
Craving is what one must forsake
To cut off all bondage.
