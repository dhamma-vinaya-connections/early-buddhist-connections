# SN1.5 - Katichindasutta - How Many Must One Cut?
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A brahmin farmer criticizes the Buddha  for failing to produce food, merely living off the work of others. But the Buddha  shows that his true work is spiritual

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Faith is the seed, austerity the rain,
Wisdom my yoke and plough;
Shame is the pole, mind the yoke-tie,
Mindfulness my ploughshare and goad
> 
> Energy is my beast of burden,
Carrying me to security from bondage.
It goes ahead without stopping
To where, having gone, one does not sorrow
>
