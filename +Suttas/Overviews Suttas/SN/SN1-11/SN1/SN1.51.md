# SN1.51 - Jarāsutta - Old Age
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Morality is good even in old age. And a person’s true companion is their faith

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Virtue is good until old age;
Faith is good when established;
Wisdom is the precious gem of humans;
Merit is hard for thieves to steal
> 
> Faith is a person’s partner,
And wisdom is what instructs him.
Taking delight in nibbāna, a mortal
Is released from all suffering
