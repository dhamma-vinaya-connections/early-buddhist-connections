# SN1.44 - Ekamūlasutta - One Root
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> To escape from the forest of delusion, one needs the vehicle of the dhamma

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The straight way’ that path is called,
And ‘fearless’ is its destination.
The chariot is called ‘unrattling,’
Fitted with wheels of wholesome states
> 
> The sense of shame is its leaning board,
Mindfulness its upholstery;
I call the Dhamma the charioteer,
With right view running out in front
