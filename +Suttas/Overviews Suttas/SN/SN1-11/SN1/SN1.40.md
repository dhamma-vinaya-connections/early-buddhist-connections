# SN1.40 - Pajjunnadhītu - Pajjunna’s Daughter
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A goddess identifying herself as kokanadā claims to confirm with her own experience the Buddha ’s teachings on karma

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> But those who have peace and acquiescence
In regard to the noble dhamma,
On discarding the human body,
Will fill the host of devas.
> 
> One should do no evil in all the world,
Not by speech, mind, or body.
Having abandoned sense pleasures,
Mindful and clearly comprehending,
One should not pursue a course
That is painful and harmful
>
