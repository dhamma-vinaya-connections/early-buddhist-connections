# SN1.34 - Nasantisutta - There Are No
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Two deities exchange verses with the Buddha  on how sensual pleasures give rise to suffering.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> “among humans there are no sensual pleasures that are permanent. Here there are sensuous things, bound to which, Drunk on which, there’s no coming back. That person doesn’t return here from death’s domain
> 
> “the world’s pretty things aren’t sensual pleasures. Greedy intention is a person’s sensual pleasure. The world’s pretty things stay just as they are, But a wise one removes desire for them.
