# SN1.54 - Vatthusutta - Support
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Things that are friends in this life and the next.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Caravan is the friend of one on a journey;
A mother is the friend in one’s own home;
A comrade when the need arises
Is one’s friend again and again.
The deeds of merit one has done
That is the friend in the future life
> 
> Sons are the support of human beings,
A wife the best companion;
The creatures who dwell on the earth
Sustain their life by rain
