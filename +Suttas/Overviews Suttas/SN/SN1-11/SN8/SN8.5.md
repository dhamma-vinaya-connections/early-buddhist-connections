# SN8.5 - Subhāsitasutta - Well Spoken
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  gives a simple teaching on four qualities of good speech. Vaṅgīsa is inspired to utter a more elaborate set of verses on the topic, praising especially the speech of the Buddha  that leads to the deathless

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Speak only such words
As do not hurt yourself
Nor harm others;
Such speech is truly well spoken
> 
> Speak only pleasing words,
Words gladly welcomed.
Pleasing words are those
That bring nothing bad to others.
