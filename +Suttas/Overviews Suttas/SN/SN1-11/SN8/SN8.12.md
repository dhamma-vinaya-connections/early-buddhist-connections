# SN8.12 - Vaṅgīsasutta - Vangisa
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> On the pavāraṇā day at the end of the rains retreat, the Buddha  invites the saṅgha to admonish him. But not only is the Buddha  faultless, so are all the 500 monks present. Vaṅgīsa is inspired to utter a elaborate praise of the Buddha

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> They listen to the immaculate dhamma
Taught by the fully awakened Buddha ;
The Buddha  is so brilliant,
At the fore of the mendicant saṅgha
> 
> When the Dhamma has been so well taught,
How could those who know it be negligent?
So being diligent, we should always respectfully train
In the Buddha ’s teaching.”
>
