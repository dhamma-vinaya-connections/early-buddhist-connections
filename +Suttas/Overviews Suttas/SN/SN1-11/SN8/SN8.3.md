# SN8.3 - Pesalasutta - Well Behaved
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> As a renowned poet, vaṅgīsa looked down on less skilled mendicants. Ashamed of his conceit, he exhorted himself in verse to be humble and at peace.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Completely abandon the different kinds of conceit!
Besotted with the different kinds of conceit,
You’ve had regrets for a long time.
> 
> Don’t be hard-hearted, be energetic,
With hindrances given up, be pure.
Then with conceit given up completely,
>
