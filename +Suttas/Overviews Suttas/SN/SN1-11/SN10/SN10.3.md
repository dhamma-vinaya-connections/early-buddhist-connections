# SN10.3 - Sūcilomasutta - Sūciloma
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The spirits khara and sūciloma argue about whether the Buddha  is a true ascetic or not. They approach him initially with threats, but then ask as to the origin of greed and hate

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Greed and hate come from here;
From here spring discontent, desire, and terror
> 
> Born of affection, originating in oneself,
Like the shoots from a banyan’s trunk;
The many kinds of attachment to sensual pleasures
>
