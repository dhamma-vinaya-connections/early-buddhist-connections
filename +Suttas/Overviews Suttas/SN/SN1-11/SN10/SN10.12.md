# SN10.12 - Āḷavakasutta - Āḷavaka
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The famous story of the spirit āḷavaka, who tries to bully the Buddha , but is soon persuaded through a surprisingly insightful series of questions and answers. This discourse provided the background for several elaborate legends in the later traditions

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> One who is diligent and discerning
Gains wisdom by wanting to learn,
Having faith in the perfected ones,
And the teaching for becoming extinguished.
> 
> A faithful householder
Who has these four qualities
Does not grieve after passing away:
Truth, principle, steadfastness, and generosity.
