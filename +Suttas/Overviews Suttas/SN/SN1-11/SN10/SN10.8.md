# SN10.8 - Sudattasutta - Sudatta
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When anāthapiṇḍika heard that a Buddha  had arisen in the world, he rose first thing in the morning to go and visit him. But a mysterious darkness caused him to hesitate, so a spirit repeatedly encouraged him to step forward. Finally he reached the Buddha , and asked if he had slept well

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> A brahmin who is fully extinguished
Always sleeps well.
Sensual pleasures slide off them,
They’re cooled, free of attachments.
> 
> Since they’ve cut off all clinging,
And removed the stress from the heart,
The peaceful sleep well,
Abiding in peace of mind
>
