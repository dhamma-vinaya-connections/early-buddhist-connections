# SN10.5 - Sānusutta - Sanu
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> It seems that the novice sānu had returned to his home intending to disrobe. To prevent him, a spirit possessed him, encouraging him to pursue the path of good. Sānu’s mother, weeping for her son, also tries to make him stay in robes

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> If you should do a bad deed,
Or you’re doing one now,
You won’t be freed from suffering,
> 
> When your things have been saved from a fire,
Would you want them to be burnt again?”
>
