# SN6.6 - Brahmalokasutta - A Brahma World Negligence
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Brahmā had the following harmful misconception: “this is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is imperishable.   No ascetic or brahmin can come here
> 
> That Buddha  has even more psychic power and might than you or me.
