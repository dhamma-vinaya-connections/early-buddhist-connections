# SN6.3 - Brahmadevasutta - Brahmadeva
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Brahmā sahampati appears before a woman who is a devotee of his, and tells her to offer food instead to her son, a buddhist monk, as brahmās don’t eat the food she offers.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> He’s worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, a knowledge master, self-developed.
He’s worthy of a religious donation from gods and men.
> 
> He has no before and after,
Peaceful, unclouded, untroubled, with no need for hope,
He has laid down the rod for all creatures firm and frail.
So let him enjoy your offering of choice alms
>
