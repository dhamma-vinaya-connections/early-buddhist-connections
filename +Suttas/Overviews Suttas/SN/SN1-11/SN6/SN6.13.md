# SN6.13 - Devadattasutta - Devadatta
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Brahmā sahampati appears to the Buddha  and speaks in praise of the renunciates staying fearless in the deep forest, and celebrates the many who have found freedom

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> One should resort to remote lodgings,
Practise for release from the fetters.
But if one does not find delight there,
Guarded and mindful, dwell in the saṅgha
> 
> Walking for alms from family to family,
Faculties guarded, discreet, mindful,
One should resort to remote lodgings,
Freed from fear, liberated in the fearless
