# SN6.1 - Brahmāyācanasutta - Brahma's Request
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> After his awakening, the Buddha  hesitated to teach, thinking that the Dhamma is too subtle for people to understand. But the high divinity Brahmā sahampati appears and encourages him to teach, pointing out that there are some with “little dust in their eyes” who will understand

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Principle is not easily understood
By those mired in greed and hate.
Those caught up in greed can’t see
What’s subtle, going against the stream,
Deep, hard to see, and very fine,
For they’re shrouded in a mass of darkness
> 
> Flung open are the doors to the deathless!
Let those with ears to hear decide their faith.
Thinking it would be troublesome, Brahmā, I did not teach
The sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among humans
