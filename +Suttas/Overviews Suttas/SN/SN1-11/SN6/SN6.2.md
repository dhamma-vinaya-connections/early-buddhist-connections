# SN6.2 - Gāravasutta - Reverence
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> After his awakening, the Buddha  reflects that one should live with reverence; but who is he to revere, since he is fully awakened? He realizes that he should live revering the dhamma. Brahmā sahampati appears and agrees with him, saying that this is how all Buddha s of past and future live too.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Therefore someone who loves themselves,
Aspiring to transcendence,
Should respect the true teaching,
Remembering the instructions of the Buddha s
> 
> It’s unpleasant to live without respect and reverence
>
