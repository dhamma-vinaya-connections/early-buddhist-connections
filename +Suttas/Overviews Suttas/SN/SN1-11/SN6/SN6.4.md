# SN6.4 - Bakabrahmasutta - Brahma Baka
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Baka the Brahmā conceives the wrong view that his status is permanent and imperishable. The Buddha  goes to dissuade him, and they have an exchange in verse, with the Buddha  telling baka of his past lives

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Brahmā had the following harmful misconception: “this is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is imperishable.   No ascetic or brahmin can come here
> 
> That Buddha  has even more psychic power and might than you or me.
