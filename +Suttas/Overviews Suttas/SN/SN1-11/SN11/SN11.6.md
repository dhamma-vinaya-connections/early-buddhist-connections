# SN11.6 - Kulāvakasutta - The Bird Nests
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Sakka rallies his troops with the sight of his banner. But the Buddha  points out that the deities, powerful as they are, are not free of fear, but he is. He encourages the mendicants to recollect the triple gem to abandon fear.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Thus recollecting the Buddha ,
The teaching, and the saṅgha, mendicants,
Fear and terror
And goosebumps will be no more
> 
> Why is that? Because the realized one is free of greed, hate, and delusion. He does not get fearful, scared, terrified, or run away
