# SN11.18 - gāhaṭṭhavandanāsutta - The Worship of Householders (or Sakka's Worship (1))
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When sakka sets out on a pleasure jaunt, he begins by lifting his joined palms to the Buddha . His charioteer mātali points out that sakka is venerated by gods and men, and asks who he is venerating. Sakka replies that he venerates the Buddha , the perfected mendicants as well as trainees on the path.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Those for whom lust and hatred
And ignorance have been expunged,
The arahants with taints destroyed:
These are the ones whom I worship
> 
> But I worship those endowed with virtue,
Those long trained in concentration,
Those who have properly gone forth
With the holy life their destination
>
