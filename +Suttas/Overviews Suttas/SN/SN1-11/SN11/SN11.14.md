# SN11.14 - Daliddasutta - Poor
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The gods complain when a poor man is reborn in heaven. But sakka points out that even though poor, he did many good deeds

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When one has faith in the tathāgata,
Unshakable and well established,
And good conduct built on virtue,
Dear to the noble ones and praised
> 
> When one has confidence in the saṅgha
And one’s view is straightened out,
They say that one isn’t poor;
One’s life is not lived in vain
