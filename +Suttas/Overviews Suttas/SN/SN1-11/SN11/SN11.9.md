# SN11.9 - Araññāyatanaisisutta - Seers in a Forest
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When sakka, the lord of gods, tries to organize a counterattack against the demons, he is frustrated by his lazy general suvīra. Sakka asks suvīra how one might get what one wants without effort; but suvīra apparently believes sakka can grant any wish he wants. The Buddha  emphasizes that if effort is valuable among the gods, how much more so for mendicants.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Even sakka lord of the gods speak in praise of initiative and energy.
> 
> Would be truly beautiful for you to try hard, strive, and make an effort to attain the unattained, achieve the unachieved, and realize the unrealized!
