# SN15.2 - Pathavīsutta - Earth
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Transmigration is endless

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> This saṃsāra is without discoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving. For such a long time, bhikkhus, you have experienced suffering, anguish, and disaster, and swelled the cemetery.
> 
> It is enough to experience revulsion towards all formations, enough to become dispassionate towards them, enough to be liberated from them.
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Earth and grass and wood similes to endless transmigration
