# SN14.30 - Catudhātusutta - Four Elements
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Each of the three aspects of the four material elements performs its own function. Gratification stimulates desire; drawbacks lead to disillusionment, while escape opens the possibility of freedom.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> If you take pleasure in the 4 elements   you take pleasure in suffering. If you take pleasure in suffering, I say you’re not exempt from suffering
> 
> The arising, continuation, rebirth, and manifestation of the 4 elements is the arising of suffering, the continuation of diseases, and the manifestation of old age and death.
