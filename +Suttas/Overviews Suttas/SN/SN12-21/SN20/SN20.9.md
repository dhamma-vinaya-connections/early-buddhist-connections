# SN20.9 - Nāgasutta - The Bull Elephant
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A mendicant who overly associates with the laity is like an elephant calf who tries to copy the great bull elephants.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Elder bhikkhus use their gains without being tied to them, but new ones trying to emulate them they use their gains while being tied to them, infatuated with them,
> 
> Some bhikkhus enters a village or town for alms with body, speech, and mind unguarded, without setting up mindfulness, unrestrained in his sense faculties. He sees women there lightly clad and lust invades his mind.
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Bull elephants clean their meals, novices don't like senior bhikkhus use requisites detached, novices get infatuated with them
