# SN21.9 - Tissasutta - Tissa
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  encouraged ven Nanda to embrace simplicity. And  encourages ven tissa to let go of his anger

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Will I see Nanda In the wilderness, wearing rag robes, Feeding on scraps offered by strangers, Unconcerned for sensual pleasures
> 
> “why are you angry? Don’t be angry! It’s better to not be angry, tissa. For this spiritual life is lived In order to remove anger, conceit, and denigration.
