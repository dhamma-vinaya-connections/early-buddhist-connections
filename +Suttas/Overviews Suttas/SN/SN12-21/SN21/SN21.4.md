# SN21.4 - Navasutta - The Newly Ordained Bhikkhu
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When a certain monk neglects his duties in favor of solitude, other monks complain. The Buddha  questions him, and finds that he is awakened

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Not by means of slack endeavour,
Not by means of feeble effort,
Is this nibbāna to be achieved,
Release from all suffering.
> 
> The small one endowed with wisdom—
He is the one that is truly great,
Not the fool with a well-built body.
