# SN12.37 - Natumhasutta - Not Yours
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The body is not yours, but is old kamma, generated by choices in past lives

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> This body doesn’t belong to you or to anyone else. It’s old deeds, and should be seen as produced by choices and intentions, as something to be felt
> 
> Properly attends to dependent origination itself: ‘when this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases
>
