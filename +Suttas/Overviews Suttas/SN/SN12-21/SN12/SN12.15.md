# SN12.15 - Kaccānagottasutta - Kaccanagotta
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  explains to ven. Kaccayana gotta how dependent co-arising applies in the development of right view.This Sutta, brief but profound and difficult, became renowned as the only canonical reference named in nāgārjuna’s mūlamadhyamakakārikā, perhaps the most famous philosophical treatise in all buddhism.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When you truly see the origin of the world with right understanding, you won’t have the notion of non-existence regarding the world. And when you truly see the cessation of the world with right understanding, you won’t have the notion of existence regarding the world
> 
> If —you don’t get attracted, grasp, and commit to the notion ‘my self’, you’ll have no doubt or uncertainty that what arises is just suffering arising, and what ceases is just suffering ceasing. Your knowledge about this is independent of others
