# SN12.18 - Timbarukasutta - Timbaruka
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Kassapa approaches the Buddha  while he is on alms round and asks whether suffering is created by oneself, by another, by both, or by chance. Explaining why he rejects all these options, the Buddha  asserts that suffering arises due to conditions.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Whether pleasure and pain are created by oneself, by another, by both, or by chance.
> 
> Leans toward eternalism or annihilationism. Avoiding these two extremes, the realized one teaches by the middle way: dependent origination
