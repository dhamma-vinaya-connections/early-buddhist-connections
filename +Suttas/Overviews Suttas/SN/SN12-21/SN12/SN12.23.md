# SN12.23 - Upanisasutta - Proximate Cause
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  explains how seeing deeply into dependent co-arising leads to awakening. The causal chain here includes an additional set of factors not present in the "standard" chain of dependent co-arising.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Ending of the effluents is for one who knows & sees, I tell you, not for one who does not know & does not see. For one who knows what & sees what is there the ending of effluents? 'such are 5 aggregates uch its origination, such its disappearance.
> 
> Release has its prerequisite,  dispassion... Disenchantment... Knowledge & vision of things as they actually are present... Concentration... Pleasure... Serenity... Rapture... Joy... Conviction... Stress... Birth... Becoming... Clinging... Craving... Feeling... Contact... The six sense media... Name-&-form... Consciousness... Fabrications... ignorance
