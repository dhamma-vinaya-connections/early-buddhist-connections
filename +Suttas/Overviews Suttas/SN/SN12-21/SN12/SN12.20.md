# SN12.20 - Paccayasutta - Conditions
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  explains that when dependent co-arising is clearly seen and understood, wrong views and confusion disappear.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The Buddha  distinguishes between “dependently originated phenomena”—the twelve factors—and “dependent origination”—the principle of conditionality
> 
> Someone who understands these things no longer worries about the past or future nor 'am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound
