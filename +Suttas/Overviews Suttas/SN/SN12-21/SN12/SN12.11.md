# SN12.11 - Āhārasutta - Nutriment
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  defines the four kinds of “food” or “nutriment”, which include edible food, contact, intention, and consciousness. These are all produced by craving, and hence connect with dependent origination.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> 4 fuels, solid food, whether coarse or fine; contact is the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth
> 
> Their cessation is of  ignorance – volitional formations – consciousness- name form- senses bases- contact- feelings- craving- clinging- existence- birth- old age and death- sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair come to be
