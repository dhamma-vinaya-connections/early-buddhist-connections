# SN12.68 - Kosambisutta - Kosambı
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Four good friends share a frank discussion about their grasp of dependent co-arising. One uses a memorable simile showing that it is possible to see the Dhamma without having fully realized arahantship

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Putting aside conviction... preference... tradition... reasoning through analogies... an agreement through pondering views, I do have truly personal knowledge that, 'the cessation of becoming is unbinding
> 
> Although I have seen properly with right discernment, as it actually is present, that 'the cessation of becoming is unbinding,' still I am not an Arahant whose fermentations are ended."
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Well with water inaccessible, like close to nibbana but not reached
