# SN17.35 - Acirapakkantasutta - Shortly After He Left
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Ascetics or brahmins who do not understand as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of gain, honour, and praise are not really so

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> You should understand gain, honour, and praise, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation:
> 
> Gain, honour, and praise cut through the outer skin, then through the inner skin, then through the flesh, then through the sinews, then through the bone. Having cut through the bone, they reach right to the marrow
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Rope cutting through skin to bone marrow like gain, honor and praise
