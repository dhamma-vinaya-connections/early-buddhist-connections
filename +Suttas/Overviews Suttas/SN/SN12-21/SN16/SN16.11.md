# SN16.11 - Cīvarasutta - Robes
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When several of āNanda’s students disrobe, Kassapa admonishes him, calling him “boy”. The nun thullanandā hears of this and criticizes Kassapa, claiming he formerly followed another teacher. But Kassapa refutes this, and gives an account of his going forth and first encounter with the Buddha .

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Since I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness, I don’t recall acknowledging any other teacher apart from the blessed one who gave me these advices
> 
> So you should train like this: “I will set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for seniors, juniors, and those in the middle, “whenever I hear a teaching connected with what’s skillful, I will pay heed, pay attention, engage wholeheartedly and “I will never neglect mindfulness of the body that is full of pleasure
