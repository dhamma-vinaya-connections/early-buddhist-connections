> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The Buddha  hasn't declared if tathāgata exist after death, doesn't exist, both, neither, because it’s not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.
> 
> ‘this is suffering’ has been declared by the Buddha . ‘this is the origin of suffering’ … ‘this is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘this is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’ has been declared by the Buddha
