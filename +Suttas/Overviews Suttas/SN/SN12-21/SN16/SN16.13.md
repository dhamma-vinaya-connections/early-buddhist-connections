# SN16.13 - Saddhammappatirūpakasutta - The Counterfeit of the True Dhamma
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Kassapa asks the Buddha  why there are now more rules but fewer awakened mendicants. The Buddha  replies that it is due to the arising of the counterfeit dhamma, giving five factors that lead to decline

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When sentient beings are in decline and the true teaching is disappearing there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicants
> 
> When the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen lack respect and reverence for the teacher, the teaching, the saṅgha, the training, and immersion. These five detrimental things lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching.
