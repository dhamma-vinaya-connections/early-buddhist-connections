# ITI24 - Aṭṭhipuñja - Heap of bones
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> In this course of transmigrating, one person would leave behind a heap of bones as large as a mountain—if there were someone to collect the bones and the collection were not destroyed

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The accumulation
of a single person’s
bones for an eon
would be a heap
on a par with the mountain,
> 
> But when that person sees
with right discernment
the four Noble Truths–
having wandered on
seven times at most, then,
he makes an end of stress.
