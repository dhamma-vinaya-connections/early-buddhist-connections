# ITI26 - Dāna - Giving
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> If you knew, as the Buddha did, the results of giving and sharing, you wouldn’t eat without having shared

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Even if it were their last bite, their last mouthful, they would not eat without having shared, if there were someone to receive their gift.
> 
> But because beings do not know, as I know, the results of giving & sharing, they eat without having given. The stain of selfishness overcomes their minds.”
