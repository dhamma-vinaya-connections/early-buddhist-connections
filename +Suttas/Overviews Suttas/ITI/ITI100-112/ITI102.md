# ITI102 - Āsavakkhaya - Defilements ending
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> For one knowing and seeing the four noble truths, there is the ending of suffering.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> To see the four noble truths is to count as a true contemplative
> 
> As a trainee trains,
following the straight road,
first they know about ending;
enlightenment follows 
Then to one freed through enlightenment
the knowledge of ending arises,
the supreme knowledge of freedom,
with the ending of the fetters
