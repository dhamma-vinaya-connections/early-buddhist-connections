# ITI49 - Diṭṭhigata - Misconceptions
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> How those with vision differ from those who adhere to craving for rebirth and those who slip past into craving to be annihilated.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> some adhere, Human & divine beings enjoy becoming, and some slip right past feeling horrified, humiliated, & disgusted with that very becoming,
> 
> a monk sees what’s come to be as what’s come to be. Seeing what’s come to be as what’s come to be, he practices for disenchantment with what’s come to be, dispassion toward what’s come to be, cessation of what’s come to be.
