# ITI89 - Devadatta - About Devadatta
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Conquered by three forms of false Dhamma, Devadatta was incurably doomed to deprivation.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Conquered by evil desires, friendship with evil people and stopped halfway with a lower modicum of distinctive attainment.
> 
> I’ve heard how Devadatta,
–regarded as wise, composed,
incandescent with honor–
in the thrall of heedlessness
assaulted the Tathāgata
and fell to the four-gated, fearful place:
Avīci, unmitigated hell.
