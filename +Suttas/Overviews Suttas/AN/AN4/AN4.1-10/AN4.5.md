# AN4.5 - Anusota - With The Stream
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A person who goes with the stream; a person who goes against the stream; a stable person; and one who has crossed over

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> People with uncontrolled sensuality, who in pain they’d give up sensual pleasures, who given up five corruptions & the ‘ones who has gone beyond
> 
> Those who go with the stream are sunk in craving,  the wise one in this life, with mindfulness established, who’s mastered their mind, with faculties immersed in samādhi & who completed the spiritual journey
