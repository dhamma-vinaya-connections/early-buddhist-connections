# AN4.245 - Sikkhānisaṃsa - Training Benefits
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> How training benefits, wisdom oversees, freedom is the heart, and mindfulness is in charge.
> 
> In this way I’ll examine with wisdom the teaching that I haven’t yet examined, or support with wisdom in every situation the teaching I’ve already examined.’
