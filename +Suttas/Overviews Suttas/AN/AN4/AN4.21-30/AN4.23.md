> Why the Buddha  is called the realized one

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The Buddha : understands everything known by the mind, everything he speaks is true; he does as he says, and says as he does, and he is the universal seer, the wielder of power

Untroubled, with doubts cut off.

Freed with the end of attachments
