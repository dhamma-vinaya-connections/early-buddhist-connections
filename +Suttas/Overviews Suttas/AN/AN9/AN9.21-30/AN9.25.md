> Nine reflections by which a mendicant knows their mind has wisdom

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When they know: ‘my mind is without and not liable to become greed, hate and delusion, not liable to return to rebirth in the sensual, luminous nor formless realms
> 
> Mind is rightly freed like this, even if compelling sights, sounds … smells … tastes …touches … and thoughts, come into the range of vision they don’t occupy their mind. The Mind remains unaffected
