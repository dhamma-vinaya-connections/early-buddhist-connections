> 
> They contemplate the phenomena there as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as misery; they turn their mind away from those things, and apply it to the deathless:‘this is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’ Abiding In that they attain the ending of defilements
