# AN9.38 - Lokāyatika - Brahmin Cosmologists
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Two brahmin cosmologists ask the Buddha  to decide between competing claims as to whether the cosmos is infinite. Rejecting metaphysical claims, the Buddha  says that there is no end of the world that can be reached by traveling; but without reaching the end of the world you can’t be free of suffering

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> One meditates at the end of the world in 4 jhanas, 4 formless jhanas,  cessation of perceptions and feelings are basis for ending the defilements.
> 
> say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by running like this.But I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world
