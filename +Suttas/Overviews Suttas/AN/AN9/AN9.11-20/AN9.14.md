# AN9.14 - Samiddhi - With Samiddhi
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Sāriputta questions venerable samiddhi on the basis of intentions and thoughts

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Thoughts & resolves arise based on name and form, become diversified in the elements, contact is their origin, feeling is their meeting place, samadhi is their chief, mindfulness is their ruler, wisdom is their overseer, freedom is their core, and culminate in the deathless
> 
> , good, samiddhi! It’s Good that you answered each question. But don’t get conceited because of that.”
