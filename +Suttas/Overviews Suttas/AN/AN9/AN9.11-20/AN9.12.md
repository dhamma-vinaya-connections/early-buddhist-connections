# AN9.12 - Saupādisesa - With Something Left Over
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Sāriputta visits some wanderers, who claim that only perfected ones are free from bad rebirth. Sāriputta has no opinion on this, but asks the Buddha , who replies that even stream-enterers are freed from lower rebirth

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Anagamis extinguished between one life and the next, extinguished upon landing, extinguished without extra effort, with extra effort and going to the akaniṭṭha realm, non returner, 3 levels of stream enters
> 
> I have not felt the need to give this exposition of the teaching to the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. Why Is that? For I didn’t want those who heard it to introduce negligence.
