# AN9.20 - Velāma - About Velāma
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The wealthy and devoted lay supporter anāthapiṇḍika rather curiously says that only poor alms are given in his home. The Buddha  praises gracious and bounteous generosity. But meditation surpasses even the greatest offering

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> It is more fruitful to feed a noble person, then a Buddha , the Sangha, then to build a dwelling, to go for refuge to triple gem, to take 5 precepts, to develop a heart of love, more fruitful develop the perception of impermanence
> 
> Someone might give a gift that’s either coarse or fine.And They give it carefully, thoughtfully, with their own hand. They don’t give the dregs, and they give with consideration for consequences. Then Wherever the result of any such gift manifests, their mind inclines toward enjoyment
