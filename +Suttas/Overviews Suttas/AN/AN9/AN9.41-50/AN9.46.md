# AN9.46 - Sandiṭṭhikanibbāna - Nibbana Is Visible In This Very Life
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> In this group of short suttas, ven. Ananda answers ven. Udayin's lingering questions about the meaning of several key terms that the Buddha  uses in other suttas: what is a "bodily witness"? What is "discernment-release"? What is "released both ways"? Ven. Ananda shows here that the development of jhana plays an integral part in the development of wisdom.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> 4 jhanas, dimension of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, neither perception nor non-perception, cessation of perception and feeling
> 
> Having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end. To This extent the Buddha  said that extinguishment is visible in this very life in a definitive sense.”
