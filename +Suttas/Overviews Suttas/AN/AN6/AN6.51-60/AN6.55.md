# AN6.55 - Sona - With Sona
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When venerable soṇa thinks of disrobing, the Buddha  comes and encourages him with the famous simile of the lute that is tuned neither too loose nor too tight

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Arahant are dedicated to renunciation, seclusion, kindness, the ending of craving, the ending of grasping, and mental clarity
> 
> When energy is too forceful it leads to restlessness. When energy is too slack it leads to laziness. So, soṇa, you should apply yourself to energy and serenity, find a balance of the faculties, and learn the pattern of this situation
>
