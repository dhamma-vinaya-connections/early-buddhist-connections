# AN6.91 - Pahīna - Given Up
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Things given up by a stream-enterer accomplished in views

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Give up identity view, doubt, misapprehension of precepts and observances, and forms of greed, hate, and delusion that lead to rebirth in places of loss
> 
> Can’t live disrespectful and irreverent toward the teacher, the teaching, the saṅgha, or the training. They can’t establish their belief on unreliable grounds. And they can’t generate an eighth rebirth
