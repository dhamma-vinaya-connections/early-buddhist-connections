# AN6.41 - Daruka-Khandha - Wood Pile
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Even a simple block of wood can be perceived in different ways by a mendicant with advanced meditation

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> If he wanted to, a monk with psychic power, having attained mastery of his mind, could will that wood pile to be nothing but earth... water... fire... wind... beautiful... unattractive
> 
> Because the properties and element exists in the tree trunk. Relying on that a mendicant with psychic powers could determine it to be nothing but any elements
