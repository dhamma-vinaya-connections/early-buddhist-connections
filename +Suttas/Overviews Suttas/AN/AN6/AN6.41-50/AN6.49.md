# AN6.49 - Khema - With Khema
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Two monks separately come to the Buddha  and speak of awakening in terms of letting go conceit. The Buddha  affirms that they are, in fact, awakened, and that such indirect means are the proper way to make such declarations

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> They don’t rank themselves 
As being higher, or lower, or equal. 
Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed. 
They live freed from fetters
> 
> This is how gentlemen declare enlightenment. The Goal is spoken of, but the self is not involved
>
