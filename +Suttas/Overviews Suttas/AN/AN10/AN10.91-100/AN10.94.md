# AN10.94 - Vajjiyamāhita - With Vajjiyamāhita
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Householder vajjiyamāhita visits some wanderers, who accuse the Buddha  of condemning all asceticism. Vajjiyamāhita counters this by saying the Buddha  only criticizes what is worthy of criticism. The Buddha  praises him, and explains in detail what this means.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> The Buddha  don’t say that all mortifications should be undergone, nor any mortification, all observances nor any observances, all exertions nor any exertions, nor  all forfeiture should be forfeited, nor any  forfeiture should be forfeited, nor all release is to be used for release, nor all release is not to be used for release.
> 
> When undergoing certain mortifications, unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline. I say that you shouldn’t undergo those mortifications.
