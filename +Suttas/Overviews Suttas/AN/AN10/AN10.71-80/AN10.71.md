# AN10.71 - Ākaṅkha - Wishes
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> This discourse lists ten reasons, in ascending worth, for perfecting the precepts and being committed to the development of calm (samatha) and insight (vipassana). An interesting feature of this discussion is that the Buddha  does not separate insight and jhana into separate paths of practice, and actually cites insight, together with tranquillity, as a prerequisite for mastering the four jhanas

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Mendicant might wish: ‘may I be liked, receive requisites and be fruitful for donors, and deceased family, may I endure pain, be content, prevail over desire and fear,  get 4 jhanas and realize the undefiled freedom
> 
> Then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.
