# AN10.72 - Kaṇṭaka - Thorns
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When the Buddha  receives noisy visitors, several monks withdraw to a nearby forest to meditate. The Buddha  praises them, saying that noise is a thorn to absorption

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Company is a thorn for seclusion, focusing on the beautiful is a thorn for perceptions of ugliness, seeing shows is a thorn to someone restraining the senses, being around females is a thorn for celibacy,
> 
> Sound is a thorn to 1 jhanas,  placing the mind and keeping it connected are a thorn to 2 jhanas, rapture is a thorn to 3 jhana, breathing is a thorn to 4 jhana,  perception and feeling are a thorn to the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling. Greed, hate, and delusion are thorns.
