# AN10.62 - Avijjā - Ignorance
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Associating with bad people- listening to an untrue teaching - lack of faith … improper attention … lack of mindfulness and situational awareness … lack of sense restraint …the three kinds of misconduct … the five hindrances … ignorance - craving for continued existence
> 
> No first point of craving for continued existence is evident, before which there was no craving for continued existence, and afterwards it came to be. And Yet it is evident that there is a specific condition for craving for continued existence.
