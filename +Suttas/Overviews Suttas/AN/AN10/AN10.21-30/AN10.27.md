# AN10.27 - Mahapañha Sutta - Great Questions
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Some wanderers claim to teach the direct knowledge of all things, just like the Buddha . However the Buddha  disputes this by presenting ten “great questions” that they cannot answer

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> 1 all sentient beings are sustained by food, 2 name and form, 3 types of feelings, 4 types of food, 5 aggregates, 6 senses, 7 planes of consciousness, 8 worldly conditions, 9 abodes of sentient beings, 10 ways of performing unskillful deeds
> 
> Becoming completely disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding this one thing, seeing its limits and fully comprehending its meaning, a mendicant makes an end of suffering in this very life. ‘
