# AN10.38 - Saṃghasāmaggī - Harmony In The Saṅgha
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Ten reasons for harmony in the saṅgha

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When a mendicant explains what is the teaching as the teaching, and vice versa; what is the training as the training, and vice versa; what was spoken, practiced and prescribed by the realized one as spoken, practiced and prescribed  by the realized one and vice versa
> 
> A saṅgha in harmony is happy, 
As is support for those in harmony. 
Basing themselves in the teaching, 
Favoring harmony, they destroy no sanctuary. 
After creating harmony in the saṅgha, 
They rejoice in heaven for an eon
