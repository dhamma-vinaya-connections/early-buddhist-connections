# AN10.58 - Mūlaka - Rooted
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The root of all things, and similar principles

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> All things are rooted in desire. Attention produces them. Contact is their origin. Feeling is their meeting place. Immersion is their chief. Mindfulness is their ruler. Wisdom is their overseer. Freedom is their core. They culminate in the deathless. And extinguishment is their final end
> 
> When questioned by wanderers who follow other paths, that’s how you should answer them.”
