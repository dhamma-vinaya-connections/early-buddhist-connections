# AN8.86 - Yasa - Honor
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When the householders of icchānaṅgala make a racket in the monastery, the Buddha  asks his attendant nāgita what is going on. The Buddha  speaks strongly of his dislike for material gains, and his love of seclusion

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Avoid company, playing together, eat as much as they like, living in the neighborhood of a village, enjoying possessions, honor, and popularity they neglect retreat
> 
> May fame not come to me. There are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can
