# AN8.35 - Dānūpapatti - Rebirth By Giving
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When giving, if you expect a certain result in the next life, you can get it, if the conditions are right

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Someone gives to ascetics or brahmins, expecting to be reborn in: higher castes, or any gods or Brahma realms and settle on that idea, concentrate on it and develop it.
> 
> As they’ve settled for less and not developed further, their idea leads to rebirth there. But I say that this is only for those of ethical conduct, not for the unethical
