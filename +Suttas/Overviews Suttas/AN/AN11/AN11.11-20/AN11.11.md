## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Establish in faith, ethics, mindfulness, samadhi and wisdom and develop recollections of the Buddha , dhamma, Sangha, own ethics, own generosity and divinities

> 

> [!info] Similes
> Fire doesn’t go back over what it has burned, like unskillful qualities and doesn’t cling to one who have these recollections
