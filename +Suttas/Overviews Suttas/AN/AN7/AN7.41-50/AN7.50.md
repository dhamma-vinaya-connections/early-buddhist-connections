## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The brahmin jāṇussoṇī asks the Buddha  about behaviors that are a blemish to the celibate life

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Not have sex, not consent to being massaged, nor play and have fun, nor gaze, nor pay attention to sounds, nor recall when they used to laugh, chat, and have fun with females, nor see a householder amusing themselves, nor wishing to be reborn in one of the orders of gods
> 
> This is called one who lives the celibate life impurely, tied to the fetter of sex. They’re not free from rebirth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress
