# AN7.49 - Sañña - Perceptions
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Meditating on seven perceptions leads to the deathless

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Perceptions of ugliness vs sex,  death vs attachment to life, repulsiveness of food vs craving for tastes, dissatisfaction with the whole world vs world’s shiny things,  impermanence vs gains, honors, and fame,  suffering in impermanence vs danger of sloth, laziness, slackness, negligence, and not-self in suffering to get rid of I-making, mine-making, and conceit
> 
> When their mind has gone beyond discrimination, and is peaceful and well freed, they should know: ‘my perception of not-self in suffering is well developed. I have realized a distinction higher than before. I have attained a fruit of development
