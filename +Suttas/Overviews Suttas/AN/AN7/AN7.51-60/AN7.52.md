# AN7.52 - Dana - Giving
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  describes some of the motivations one might have for being generous. The karmic fruits of giving depend heavily on one's motives

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> One gives thinking ‘I’ll enjoy this in my next life; it’s good to give’; to keep family tradition; I cook, they don’t. It wouldn’t be right for me to not give to them; just as sages performed great sacrifices, I will share a gift; when giving this gift my mind becomes clear, and I become happy and joyful; this is an adornment and requisite for the mind
> 
> This is the cause, this is the reason why someone gives a gift and it is not very fruitful or beneficial,while someone else gives exactly the same gift and it is very fruitful and beneficial
