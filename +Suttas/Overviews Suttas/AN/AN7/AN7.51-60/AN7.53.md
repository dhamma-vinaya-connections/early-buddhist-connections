# AN7.53 - Nandamātā - Nanda’s Mother
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Sāriputta and Moggallāna are on tour in the southern hills. A deity informs the laywoman veḷukaṇṭakī that they are approaching. When Sāriputta expresses his amazement that she speaks with the gods, she goes on to list many other of her own amazing qualities

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Converse with gods, not  getting upset when my son was executed nor husband passed away; not betraying any husband  even in though;  not deliberately breaking any precept, enter in 4 jhanas and had given up  the five lower fetters
> 
> It’s incredible, Nanda’s mother, it’s amazing that you purify even the arising of a thought
