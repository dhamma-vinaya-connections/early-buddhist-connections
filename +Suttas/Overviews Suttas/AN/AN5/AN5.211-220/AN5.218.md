# AN5.218 - Apāsādika - Conduct Uninspiring
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Drawbacks of uninspiring conduct.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> You blame yourself. After examination, sensible people criticize you. You get a bad reputation. You feel lost when you die, and reborn in bad places
> 
> You don’t inspire confidence in those without it. You cause some with confidence to change their minds. You don’t follow the teacher’s instructions. Those who come after you follow your example. And your mind doesn’t become clear
