# AN5.72 - Cetovimuttiphala - Freedom Of Heart Is The Fruit
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Five meditations lead to freedom. The Buddha  supplies five similes, which subtly illustrate five aspects of awakening

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Perceptions of ugliness, death, drawbacks, repulsiveness of food, and dissatisfaction with the world, impermanence, suffering in impermanence, not-self in suffering, giving up, and fading away
> 
> Mendicant has freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom, they’re called a mendicant who has lifted up the cross-bar, filled in the trench, and pulled up the pillar; they’re unbarred, a noble one with banner and burden put down, detached.
