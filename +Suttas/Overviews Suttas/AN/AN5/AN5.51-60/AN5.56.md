## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A monk, dissatisfied with monastic life, seeks support from his mentor

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> We will guard our sense doors, eat in moderation, be dedicated to wakefulness, discern skillful qualities, and pursue the development of the qualities that lead to awakening in the evening and toward dawn
> 
> Your body doesn’t feel like it’s drugged. You’re not disorientated, the teachings spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness don’t fill your mind. You live the spiritual life satisfied, and have no doubts about the teachings
