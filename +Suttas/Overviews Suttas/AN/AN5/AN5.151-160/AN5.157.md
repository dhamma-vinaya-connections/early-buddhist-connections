# AN5.157 - Dukkathā - Talk Inappropriate
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> There are certain topics that are inappropriate to talk about, taking into consideration which specific one of five people you are talking to

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> It’s inappropriate to talk to an unfaithful person about faith, unethical person about ethics, unlearned person about learning, to a stingy person about generosity and witless person about wisdom?
> 
> Because they become annoyed, hostile, and hard-hearted, and displaying annoyance, not seeing that faith in themselves, they don’t get the rapture and joy that faith brings.
