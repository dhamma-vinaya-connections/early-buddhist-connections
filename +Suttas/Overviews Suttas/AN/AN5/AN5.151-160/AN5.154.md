> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Mendicants don’t carefully listen to the teachings, memorize them, and remember them, examine their meaning and practice accordingly, are hard to admonish and senior mendicants are indulgent and slack
> 
> Mendicants don’t explain the teaching in detail to others, don’t recite them, they learned incorrectly, with misplaced words and phrases and there’s a schism in the saṅgha
