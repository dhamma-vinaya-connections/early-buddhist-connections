# AN5.30 - Nāgita - With Nāgita
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha  tells venerable nāgita how he dislikes noisy crowds, and wishes never to become famous

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Outcome of eating is excrement, when loved ones decay and perish, comes sorrow, meditation on ugliness comes revulsion to beauty, observing impermanence in the six field comes revulsion to contact, and observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates, revulsion at grasping
> 
> May I never become famous. May fame not come to me. There Are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation and awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. Let Them enjoy the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity.
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Frame story here is common to three suttas: an 5.30, an 6.42, and an 8.86, although the conversation takes a different turn in each case,
