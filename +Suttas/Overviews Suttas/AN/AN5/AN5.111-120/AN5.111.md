# AN5.111 - Kulūpaka - Visiting Families
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Mendicant with five qualities who visits families is unlikable and unlovable, not respected or admired and improper behavior of novices in alms round

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> They act as though they're close to people, give away things they don’t own. They over-associate with close friends. They whisper in the ear. And they ask for too much
> 
> Don't allow a novices follow behind on almsround if they walk too far away or too close behind. They don’t take your bowl when it’s full. They don’t warn you when your speech is bordering on an offense. They keep on interrupting while you’re speaking. And they’re witless
