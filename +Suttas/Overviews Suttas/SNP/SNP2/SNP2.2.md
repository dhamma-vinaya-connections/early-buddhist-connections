# SNP2.2 - Āmagandhasutta - Carrion
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> People are defiled, not by eating meat, but by engaging in evil conduct.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> “Killing living beings,
hunting, cutting, binding,
theft, lying, fraud, deceptions,
useless recitations,
associating with the wives of others:
This is a raw stench,
not the eating of meat.
> 
> who are unrestrained in sensuality,
greedy for flavors,
mixed together with what’s impure,
annihilationists,
discordant1 & indomitable:
This is a raw stench,
not the eating of meat.
>
