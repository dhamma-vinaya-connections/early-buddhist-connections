# SNP2.8 - Dhamma (nāvā) - Boat
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A good teacher, like a good boatman, is one who knows firsthand how to cross to the further shore

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> You should befriend
a person of integrity—
learned, intelligent.
Practicing so as to know the goal,
when you’ve experienced the Dhamma, you get bliss.
> 
> But if you consort with a piddling fool who’s  envious,
hasn’t come to the goal,
you’ll go to death
without having cleared up
the Dhamma right here,
with your doubts unresolved.
> 

> [!info] Similes
> river crossing with a boat, like a teacher who has realized the goal
