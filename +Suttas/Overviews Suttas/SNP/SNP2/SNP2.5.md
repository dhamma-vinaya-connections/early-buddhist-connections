# SNP2.5 - Sūciloma - Spiky Spirit
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Another yakkha challenges the Buddha with riddles and threatens to “hurl out his mind, rip open his heart, or hurl him across the River Ganges” if he doesn’t solve the riddles to the yakkha’s satisfaction

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Passion &aversion
come from this1 as a cause;
displeasure, delight,
horripilation
are born from this;
arising from this
> 
> They’re born from affection
arisen from the mind,
from oneself,
like the trunk-born (shoots)
of a banyan tree, attached to sensuality,
>
