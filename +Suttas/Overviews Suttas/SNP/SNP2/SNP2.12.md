# SNP2.12 - Nigrodhakappa (vaṅgīsa) - With Vaṅgīsa and Nigrodhakappa
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Vaṅgīsa, the foremost poet among the Buddha’s disciples, praises the Buddha in verse

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> You, our teacher: You are unexcelled.
Cut through our uncertainty. Tell me this,
make known, One of discernment deep,
that he was totally unbound.
> 
> For if no man were ever to disperse defilements—
as the wind, a dark mass of clouds—
the whole world would be enveloped in darkness.
Even brilliant people wouldn’t shine bright.
