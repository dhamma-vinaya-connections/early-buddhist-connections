# SNP2.3 - Hiri - Conscience
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> How to recognize a true friend

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> One who, flouting, despising
a sense of shame,
saying, “I am your friend,”
but not grasping what he could do [to help]:
Know him as “Not one of mine.”
> 
> He’s not a friend who’s always wary, suspecting a split,
focusing just on your weakness.
But him on whom you can depend, like a child on its parent’s breast:
That’s a true friend
