# SNP1.10 - Āḷavakasutta - With Āḷavakasutta
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A yakkha challenges the Buddha with riddles and threatens to “hurl out his mind, rip open his heart, or hurl him across the River Ganges” if he doesn’t solve the riddles to the yakkha’s satisfaction

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> “Faith is here a person’s best treasure;
the Dhamma well practiced brings happiness;
truth is really the sweetest of tastes;
living by wisdom, they say, one’s life is best.”
> 
> “By faith one crosses the flood,
by heedfulness one crosses the sea.
By energy one overcomes suffering;
by wisdom one is fully purified.”
>
