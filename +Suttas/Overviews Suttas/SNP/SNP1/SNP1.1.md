# SNP1.1 - Uraga - Snake
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> One who advances far along the path sloughs off the near shore and far, like a snake who sloughs off its skin.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> One who has neither run too far nor run back,
devoid of greed, hatred and delusion, “All this is unreal "
> 
> One who has no latent tendencies at all,
whose unwholesome roots have been uprooted:
 
that bhikkhu gives up the here and the beyond
as a serpent sheds its old worn-out skin.
> 

> [!info] Similes
> Snake sheds its old worn-out skin, like a Noble one the defilements
