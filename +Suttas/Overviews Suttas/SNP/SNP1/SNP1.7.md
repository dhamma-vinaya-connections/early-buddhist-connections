# SNP1.7 - Vasala - Lowlife
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Being an outcaste is a matter of behavior, not birth.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Angry, mean, evil in his desires,
miserly, dishonest,
devoid of shame &compunction:
He should be known as ‘outcaste.’

> Not by birth is one an outcaste,
not by birth a brahman.
By action one is an outcaste.
By action is one a brahman.
