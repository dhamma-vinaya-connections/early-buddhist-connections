# SNP1.5 - Cunda - With Cunda the smith
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Four different types of contemplatives and how to recognize them

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> “There are four kinds of ascetics; there is no fifth,
the conqueror of the path, the teacher of the path,
the one who lives on the path, and the defiler of the path.”
> 
> “When a householder who is learned, wise,
a noble disciple, he knows, ‘They are not all like him,’
on seeing such, he does not forsake his faith.
For how could one equate the undefiled with the defiled, the pure with the impure?”
