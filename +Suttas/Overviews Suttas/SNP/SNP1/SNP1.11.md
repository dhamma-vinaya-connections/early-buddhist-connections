# SNP1.11 - Vijaya - Victory
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Victory over the defilements through contemplation of the unattractiveness of the body.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Bound together by bones and sinews,
plastered with skin and flesh,
covered by the epidermis,
the body is not seen as it really is
> 
> from its nine openings
impurity flows constantly:
muck from the eyes,
wax from the ears,
>
