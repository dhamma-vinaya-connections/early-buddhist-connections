# SNP1.12 - Muni - Sage
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The characteristics of the ideal sage, who finds happiness and security in living the solitary life. (This sutta is apparently one of the series of passages that King Asoka recommended for study and reflection by all practicing Buddhists.)

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Who, destroying what’s born,
wouldn’t plant (again)
or nourish what’s taking birth:
They call him the wandering, solitary sage.
He, the great seer
has seen
the state of peace.
> 
> With regard to all things:
unsmeared.
Abandoning     all,
in the ending of craving,
released
>
