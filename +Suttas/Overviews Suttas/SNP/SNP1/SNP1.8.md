# SNP1.8 - Metta - Love
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> He should not do anything, however slight,
because of which other wise people might criticize him.
May all beings be happy and secure;
may they be inwardly happy!

nor despise anyone anywhere.
Because of anger and thoughts of aversion
no one should wish suffering for another.
