# SNP1.4 - Kasibhāradvājasutta - With Bhāradvāja the Farmer
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha answers a farmer who claims that monks do no useful work and so don’t deserve to eat.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> “Faith is the seed, austerity the rain;
wisdom is my yoke and plow.
Moral shame is the pole, mind the yoke strap,
mindfulness my plowshare and goad.
> 
> “Guarded in body, guarded in speech,
controlled in food and belly,
I use truth for weeding,
and gentleness is my release.
>
