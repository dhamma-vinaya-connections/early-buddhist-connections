# SNP4.3 - Duṭṭhaṭṭhakasutta - Eight on Malice
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Freedom isn’t to be found by boasting of your precepts and practices or by debating your views

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> One who has formulated impure teachings,
put them together and advanced them,
becomes attached to the benefit he sees for himself,
to that peace dependent on the unstable.
> 
> One involved is embroiled in disputes about teachings;
but how, about what, could one dispute with one uninvolved?
Nothing is taken up or rejected by him;
he has shaken off all views right here.
