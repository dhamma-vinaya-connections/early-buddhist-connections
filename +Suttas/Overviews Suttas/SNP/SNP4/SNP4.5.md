# SNP4.5 - Paramaṭṭhakasutta - Eight on the Ultimate
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The conceit that comes from clinging to practices or views—even if they’re supreme—is a fetter preventing full freedom.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When he sees his own advantage
in what’s seen, heard, sensed,
or in habits &practices,
seizing it there
he sees all else, all others,
as inferior.
> 
> Nor should one construct any view in the world
by means of knowledge or good behavior and observances.
One should not take oneself as “equal”
or think of oneself as “inferior” or “superior.”
