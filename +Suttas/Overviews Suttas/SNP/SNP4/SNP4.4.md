# SNP4.4 - Suddhaṭṭhakasutta - Eight on the Pure
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> How to avoid the trap of letting go of one thing only to cling to something more subtle

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> No brahman says purity
comes in connection
with anything else.
Unsmeared with regard
to what’s seen, heard, sensed,
habits or practices, merit or evil,
not creating anything here,
he’s let go
> 
> Abandoning          what’s first,
they depend on  what’s next.
Following perturbation,
they don’t cross over the bond.
They embrace &reject
—like a monkey releasing a branch to seize at another—
