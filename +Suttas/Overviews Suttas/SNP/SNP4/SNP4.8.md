# SNP4.8 - Pasūrasutta - To Pasūra on Debate
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The drawbacks of engaging in debates, for winners and losers alike

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> In debates are elation, dejection.
Seeing this, one should abstain from disputes,
for they have no other goal
than the gaining of praise.
> 
> Whom would you gain as opponent, Pasūra,
among those who live above confrontation—
not pitting view against view—
who have nothing here grasped as supreme?
