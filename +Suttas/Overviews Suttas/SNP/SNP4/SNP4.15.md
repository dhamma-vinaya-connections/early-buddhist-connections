# SNP4.15 - Attadaṇḍasutta - Taking up Arms
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The Buddha speaks in poignant terms of the saṁvega that led him to leave the household life. He concludes with recommendations for practice and a description of the person who has attained the goal of true peace and security.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Wanting a haven for myself,
I saw nothing that wasn’t laid claim to.
Seeing nothing in the end
but competition,
I felt discontent.
> 
> And then I saw an arrow here,
so very hard to see,
embedded in the heart.
Overcome by this arrow
you run in all directions.
But simply on pulling it out
> 

> [!info] Similes
> fish in small puddles,like people competing against each other
