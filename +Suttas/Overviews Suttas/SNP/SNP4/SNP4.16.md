# SNP4.16 - Sāriputtasutta - Sāriputta Questions
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When a monk, disaffected with the world, takes up the life of seclusion, what fears should he overcome? What dangers should he beware of? How should he train to blow away the impurities in his heart?

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Conscious of when
his mind is stirred up &turbid,
he should dispel it:
‘It’s on the side
of the Dark One.’
He shouldn’t come under the sway
of anger or pride.
> 
> he’d prevail over notions of dear &undear.
Deferring to discernment
enraptured with what’s admirable,
he should overcome these dangers,
should conquer discontent
in his isolated spot,
>
