# SNP4.13 - Mahābyūhasutta - Longer Discourse on Arrayed For Battle
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> How to maintain freedom in a world full of disputes

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Dependent on doctrines, austerities,
or what’s seen, heard, or sensed,
they speak of purity
through wandering further on
through becoming &not-,
their craving not gone
for becoming &not-.
> 
> A person, in seeing,
sees name-&-form.
Having seen, he’ll know
only these things.
No matter if he’s seen little, a lot,
the skilled don’t say purity’s
in connection with that.
