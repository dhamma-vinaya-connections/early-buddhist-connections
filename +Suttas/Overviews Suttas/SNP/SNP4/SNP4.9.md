> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> “‘I argue for this’
doesn’t occur to one
when considering what’s grasped
among doctrines.

> 
> For one dispassionate toward perception
there are no snares;
for one released by discernment, no delusions.
Those who grasp at perceptions &views
go about clashing in the world.”
