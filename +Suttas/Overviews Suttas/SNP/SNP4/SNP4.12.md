# SNP4.12 - Cūḷabyūhasutta - Shorter Discourse on Arrayed For Battle
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> If the truth is one, how should a person behave in a world where many different truths are taught?

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> I don’t say, ‘That’s how it is,’
the way fools tell one another.
They each make out their views to be true
and so regard their opponents as fools.”
> 
> “The truth is one,
there is no second
about which a person who knows it
would argue with one who knows.
