# SNP4.7 - Tissametteyyasutta - To Tissametteyya
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The drawbacks of falling away from the celibate life

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> “In one given over
to sexual intercourse,
the teaching is muddled
and he practices wrongly:
This is ignoble in him.
> 
> Whoever once went alone,
but then resorts
to sexual intercourse
—like a carriage out of control—
is called vile in the world,
a person run-of-the-mill.
