# SNP4.2 - Guhaṭṭhakasutta - Eight on the Cave
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Those who remain attached to the body, to sensuality, and to their sense of “mine” will have a hard time freeing themselves from fear of death and from further becoming.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Staying attached to the cave,
covered heavily over,
a person sunk in confusion
is far from seclusion—
for sensual pleasures
in the world
are not lightly let go.
> 
> See them, floundering in their sense of mine,
like fish in the puddles
of a dried-up stream—
and, seeing this,
live with no mine,
not forming attachment
for states of becoming.
