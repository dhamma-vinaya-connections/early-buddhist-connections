# SNP3.8 - Sallasutta - Dart
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Death and loss are inevitable, but grief is not

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> all have death as their end.
For those overcome by death,
gone to the other world,
father cannot shelter son,
nor relatives a relative.
> 
> If, by lamenting, confused,
harming yourself—
any use could be gained
the prudent would do it as well.
But not by weeping &grief
do you gain peace of mind.
