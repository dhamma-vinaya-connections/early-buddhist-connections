## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Everywhere equanimous, mindful,
he harms no one in all the world.
A contemplative crossed over, limpid,
he has no swellings: He is composed.

the wandering-on,
dying &reappearing,
having done away with dust &blemish —pure—
he has attained the ending of birth: He is called awakened.”
