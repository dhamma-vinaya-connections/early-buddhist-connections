# SNP3.1 - Pabbajjāsutta - Going Forth
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> The young Bodhisatta (Buddha-to-be), soon after leaving home, explains why he refuses King Bimbisāra’s offer of a position in his court

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> I will praise the Going Forth,
how he went forth, the One with Eyes,
how he reasoned and chose the Going Forth.
“Household life is confining,
while going forth is the open air
> 
> From that lineage I have gone forth,
but not in hope of sensuality.
Seeing the danger in sensuality
—and renunciation as rest—
I go to strive.
