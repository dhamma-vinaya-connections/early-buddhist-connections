# SNP5.2 - Ajitamāṇavapucchā - Questions of the Student Ajita
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A brahman questions the Buddha about mindfulness, discernment, and the cessation of name-and-form.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> With ignorance
the world is shrouded.
Because of stinginess,
heedlessness,
it doesn’t shine.
With longing it’s smeared
Suffering-stress:
its great danger &fear.
> 
> He should not hanker
for sensual pleasures,
should be limpid in mind.
Skilled in all mental qualities,
he, the monk, should wander
mindfully.
