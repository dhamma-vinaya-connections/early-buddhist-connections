# SNP5.12 - Jatukaṇṇimāṇavapucchā - Questions of the Student Jatukaṇṇī
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> How does one abandon birth and aging?

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> “Remove the greed for sense pleasures, having seen there is safety in renunciation; let there be nothing found in you that has been taken up or is still to be put down.
> 
> You should erase that which is past, and have nothing for the future, if you take up nothing in the present you will live peacefully. For one altogether without greed for mind and body, O brahmin, no pollutants are found whereby he can come under Death's control.”
