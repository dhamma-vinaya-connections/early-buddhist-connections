# SNP5.7 - Upasīvamāṇavapucchā - Questions of the Student Upasīva
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> What support should one hold on to in order to cross over the flood of craving? Can an awakened person be described?

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Mindfully focused on nothingness,
relying on ‘There isn’t,’
you should cross over the flood.
Abandoning sensuality,
abstaining from conversations,
keep watch for the ending of
craving, night &day.
> 
> As a flame overthrown by the force of the wind
goes to an end
that cannot be classified,2
so the sage freed from the name-body3
goes to an end
that cannot be classified.
