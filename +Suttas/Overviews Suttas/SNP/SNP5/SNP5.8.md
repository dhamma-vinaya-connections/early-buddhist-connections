# SNP5.8 - Nandamāṇavapucchā - Questions of the Student Nanda
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Who deserves to be called a sage? Who has crossed over birth and aging?

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> “Not by view, tradition, or knowledge, do the skilful say one is a sage, Nanda, whoever lives without company, not troubled, not yearning, they are sages, I say.”
> 
> “I do not say that all ascetics and brahmins, are enveloped in birth and old age: whoever here has given up reliance on what is seen, heard, or sensed, and virtue and practices, and has also given up all the countless other ways, who, by fully knowing craving, are pollutant-free - I say those men have crossed over the flood.”
