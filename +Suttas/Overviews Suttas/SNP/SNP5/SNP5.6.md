# SNP5.6 - Dhotakamāṇavapucchā - Questions of the Student Dhotaka
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> How can one become freed of all doubt?

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> No one in the world, Dhotaka,
can I release from perplexity.
But knowing the most excellent Dhamma,
you will cross over this flood.

> Whatever you’re alert to,
above, below,
across, in between:
Knowing it as a bond in the world,
don’t create craving
for becoming or non-.
