# SNP5.4 - Puṇṇakamāṇavapucchā - Questions of the Student Puṇṇaka
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Birth and aging can be overcome, not through sacrificial rituals, but through training the mind to go beyond perturbation

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> They hoped for, liked, longed for, so they sacrificed—
they longed for sensuality,
dependent on gain.
Those who take on the yoke
of sacrifice,
impassioned with
the passion for becoming,
have not crossed over birth &aging.
> 
> He who has fathomed
the high &low in the world,
for whom there is nothing
perturbing in the world—
evaporated, undesiring,
untroubled, at peace—
he, I tell you, has crossed over birth &aging.
