# SNP5.1 - Vatthugāthā - Introductory Verses
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> A brahman teacher sends his students to the Buddha to see if the latter is truly awakened

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> So then the brahmin addressed his students, who were perfect in the Vedas: “Come, young men, and I shall explain, please listen to this word of mine: He whose manifestation in the world is always rare, has now arisen in the world, renowned as one called a ’Sambuddha’. Having gone quickly to Sāvatthī, you can see the Supreme Human Being.”
> 
> The Buddha said: “Know ignorance is called the head, and understanding is the head-splitter, joined with confidence, mindfulness, concentration, desire, and energy.”
