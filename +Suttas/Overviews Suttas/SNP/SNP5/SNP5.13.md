## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> “The one who left home, the craving-cutter, the unmoved one, the enjoyment-leaver, the flood-crosser, the one who is free, the one who left off speculation, the intelligent one - him I beg, after hearing the Strong One, they will go away from here.
> 
> the mindful monk should not be attached to anything in the world, seeing that with what is called attachment and clinging, these people are clinging to the realm of Death.”
