# SNP5.3 - Tissametteyyamāṇavapucchā - Questions of the Student Tissametteyya
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Who in the world is truly contented, truly free, truly a great person?

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> He who in the midst of sensualities,
follows the holy life,
always mindful, craving-free;
the monk who is
—through fathoming things—
unbound:
> 
> He has no agitations. He,
the thinker
knowing both sides,
doesn’t adhere in between.1 He
I call a great person. He
here has gone past
the seamstress:          craving.
