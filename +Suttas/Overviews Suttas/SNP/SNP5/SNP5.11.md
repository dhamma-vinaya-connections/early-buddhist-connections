# SNP5.11 - Kappamāṇavapucchā - Questions of the Student Kappa
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> What is the island above the flood of the great danger of birth?

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> “For those standing in the middle of a lake, when a fearful flood has arisen, for those overcome by old age and death, I speak about an island, Kappa: Having nothing, no attachment, this is the island with nothing beyond, this is called Nibbāna, I say, the end of old age and death.
> 
> Knowing this, those who are mindful, who are emancipated in this very life, come not under Māra's control, they are not servants to Māra.”
