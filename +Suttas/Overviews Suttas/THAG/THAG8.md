# THAG8 - Aṭṭhakanipātavagga - Eights Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Don’t get involved in lots of work,
avoid people, and don’t try to acquire things.
If you’re eager and greedy for flavors,
you’ll miss the goal that brings such happiness.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> They know it really is a bog,
this homage and veneration in respectable families.
Honor is a subtle dart, hard to extract,
and hard for a sinner to give up
> 
> A wise person lives on
even after loss of wealth;
but without gaining wisdom,
even a rich person doesn’t really live.
>
