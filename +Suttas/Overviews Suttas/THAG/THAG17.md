# THAG17 - Tiṁsanipātavagga - Thirties Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> One who’s mindful
as per their conduct and mindfulness,
diligent
as per their intentions and meditation,
happy inside, serene, solitary, contented:
that is what they call a mendicant

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Calm and free of despair,
clear and unclouded,
of good morals, intelligent:
one would make an end of suffering
> 
> Persist with diligence:
this is my instruction.
Come, I’ll be fully quenched—
I am everywhere free
