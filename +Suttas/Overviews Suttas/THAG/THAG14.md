# THAG14 - Cuddasakanipātavagga - Fourteens Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Since I’ve gone forth
from the lay life to homelessness,
I’ve not been aware of any thought
that is ignoble and hateful.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> I have been aware of loving-kindness,
limitless and well-developed;
gradually consolidated
as it was taught by the Buddha.
> 
> To the man who has not a blemish
who is always seeking purity,
even a hair-tip of evil
seems as big as a cloud.
