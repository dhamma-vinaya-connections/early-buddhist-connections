# THAG4 - Catukkanipātavagga - Fours Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> I am known as "Fortunate Rāhula",
Because I’m endowed in both ways:
I am the son of the Buddha,
And I have the vision of the Dhammas

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Having thrown off those sensual pleasures,
Having cut Māra’s bond,
Having pulled out craving, roots and all:
I’ve become cool, and realized nibbāna.
> 
> Then the realization
Came upon me —
The danger became clear,
And I was firmly repulsed.
