# THAG6 - Chakkanipātavagga - Sixes Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Seeing the demonstrations
of the renowned Gotama
was not enough for me to bow to him—
I was blinded by jealousy and conceit.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> I used to be content with sacrifice,
the realm of sensual pleasures was my priority.
But later I eradicated desire,
and hatred and also delusion.
> 
> I know my past lives;
my clairvoyance is clarified;
I have psychic powers, and know the minds of others;
I have attained clairaudience.
