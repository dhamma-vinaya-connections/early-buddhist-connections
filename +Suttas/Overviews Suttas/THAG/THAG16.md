# THAG16 - Vīsatinipātavagga - Twenties Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> By protecting the faculties,
taking care of the faculties,
I can do what I need to do for myself
without harming anyone else

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> One who’s diligent and discerning,
thinking, “This ought not be done”,
would avoid a useless task
that’s doomed to failure.
> 
> Whatever is meaningful,
and whatever happiness is principled,
let one undertake and follow that:
this is the best happiness.
