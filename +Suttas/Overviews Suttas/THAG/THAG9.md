# THAG9 - Navakanipātavagga - Nines Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> When a wise person fully understands that old age and death—
To which an ignorant unawakened person is bound—
Are suffering; and they are mindful, practising jhāna:
There is no greater pleasure than this.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When the blissful eightfold way,
The supreme path, cleanser of all stains,
Is seen with wisdom; and they are mindful, practising jhāna:
There is no greater pleasure than this
> 
> When it is midnight in a lonely forest,
And the sky rains, and the lions roar,
And a monk has gone to a mountain cave, practising jhāna:
There is no greater pleasure than this.
