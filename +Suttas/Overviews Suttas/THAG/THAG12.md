# THAG12 - Dvādasakanipātavagga - Twelves Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Shunned by people,
I was disregarded and held in contempt.
I humbled my heart
and paid respects to many people.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When I had paid homage at the Teacher’s feet,
I stood to one side
and asked the supreme being
for the going-forth
> 
> Staying alone in the wilderness,
meditating tirelessly,
I have completed what the Teacher taught,
just as the victor advised me.
