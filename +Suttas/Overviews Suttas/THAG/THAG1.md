# THAG1 - Ekakanipātavagga - Ones Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Deceived by conceit,
Defiled by conditions,
Distressed by gain and loss,
They don’t realise samādhi.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Hey! My body is light,
Full of so much rapture and happiness.
My body feels like it’s floating,
Like cotton on the wind
> 
> When the meaning has a hundred aspects,
And carries a hundred characteristics,
The fool sees only one factor,
While the sage sees a hundred
>
