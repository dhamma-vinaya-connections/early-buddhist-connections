# THAG13 - Terasanipātavagga - Thirteens Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> Those that have properly undertaken
constant mindfulness of the body,
don’t cultivate what should not be done,
but always do what should be done.
Mindful and aware,
their defilements come to an end.

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> When my energy was over-exerted,
the supreme Teacher in the world
created the simile of the arched harp for me.
The Clear-eyed One taught the Dhamma,
and when I heard what he said,
I happily did his bidding
> 
> When you’re dedicated to renunciation
and seclusion of the heart;
when you’re dedicated to kindness
and the end of grasping;
>
