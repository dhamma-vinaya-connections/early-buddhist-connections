# THAG3 - Tikanipātavagga - Trees Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> All sensual pleasures have been abandoned,
Rebirth in all states of existence is torn apart,
Transmigration through births is finished,
Now there is no more rebirth into any state of existence

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> hoever will live heedfully
In this Dhamma and discipline,
Will abandon transmigration through births,
And make an end to suffering
> 
> I understood these states of existence to be worthless:
Conditioned, unstable, always in motion.
When I understood the origin of rebirth within myself,
Mindful, I found peace
>
