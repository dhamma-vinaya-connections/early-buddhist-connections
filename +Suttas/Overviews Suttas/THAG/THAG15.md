# THAG15 - Soḷasakanipātavagga - Sixtieens Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> My confidence grew
As I heard the Dhamma, so full of flavor.
Dispassion was the Dhamma that was taught,
Without any grasping at all

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> All conditions are impermanent and suffering
When this is seen with understanding,
One turns away from suffering:
This is the path to purity.
> 
> But one who is humble and stable,
Controlled, with senses restrained,
Wise, with good friends,
Would put an end to suffering
>
