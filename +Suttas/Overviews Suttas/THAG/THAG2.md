# THAG2 - Dukanipātavagga - Twos Book
## 🌐 Overview

> [!info] Summary
> No life is permanent,
And no conditions last forever.
The aggregates are reborn
And pass away, again and again

> [!info] Key Excerpts 
> Just as rain doesn’t seep into
A well roofed house,
Lust doesn’t seep into
A well-developed mind.
> 
> Sages sleep happily
When they’re not attached to women;
For the truth is hard to find among them,
And one must always be guarded.
