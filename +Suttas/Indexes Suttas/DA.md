But this sutta also depicts, in simple language, the poignant human drama that unfolds among the Buddha 's many devoted followers around the time of the death of their beloved teacher.

> [!example]- 🌐[[DA21]] - 📜[Available texts](obsidian://search?query=file:da21-) - 梵動 – Brahmā’s [Net] 
>  In this important sutta, the first in the tipitaka, the Buddha  describes sixty-two philosophical and speculative views concerning the self and the world that were prevalent among spiritual seekers of his day. In rejecting these teachings — many of which thrive to this day — he decisively establishes the parameters of his own.
>  While others may praise or criticize the Buddha , they tend to focus on trivial details. The Buddha  presents an analysis of 62 kinds of wrong view, seeing through which one becomes detached from meaningless speculations

> [!example]- 🌐[[DA22]] - 📜[Available texts](obsidian://search?query=file:da22-) - 種德 – One Who Cultivates Virtues 
>  A reputed brahmin visits the Buddha , despite the reservations of other brahmins. They discuss the true meaning of a brahmin, and the Buddha  skillfully draws him around to his own point of view

The Buddha  tells a legend of the past, in which a king is persuaded to give up violent sacrifice, and instead to devote his resources to supporting the needy citizens of his realm. However, even such a beneficial and non-violent sacrifice pales in comparison to the spiritual sacrifice of giving up attachments

> [!example]- 🌐[[DA24]] - 📜[Available texts](obsidian://search?query=file:da24-) - 堅固 – Kevaddha 
>  The Buddha  refuses to perform miracles, explaining that this is not the right way to inspire faith. He goes on to tell the story of a monk whose misguided quest for answers led him as far as Brahmā
>  This discourse explores the role of miracles and conversations with heavenly beings as a possible basis for faith and belief. The Buddha  does not deny the reality of such experiences, but he points out that — of all possible miracles — the only reliable one is the miracle of instruction in the proper training of the mind. As for heavenly beings, they are subject to greed, anger, and delusion, and so the information they give — especially with regard to the miracle of instruction — is not necessarily trustworthy. Thus the only valid basis for faith is the instruction that, when followed, brings about the end of one's own mental defilements.

> [!example]- 🌐[[DA25]] - 📜[Available texts](obsidian://search?query=file:da25-) - 裸形梵志 – Naked Brāhmaṇa Ascetic 
>  The Buddha  is challenged by a naked ascetic on the topic of spiritual austerities. He points out that it is quite possible to perform all kinds of austere practices without having any inner purity of mind.

>  A number of brahmins are discussing the true path to Brahmā. Contesting the claims to authority based on the vedas, the Buddha  insists that only personal experience can lead to the truth

> [!example]- 🌐[[DA27]] - 📜[Available texts](obsidian://search?query=file:da27-) - 沙門果 – Rewards of the Ascetic Life 
>  The newly crowned king ajātasattu is disturbed by the violent means by which he achieved the crown. He visits the Buddha  to find peace of mind, and asks him about the benefits of spiritual practice. This is one of the greatest literary and spiritual texts of early buddhism.
>  King Ajatasattu asks the Buddha , "what are the fruits of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?" The Buddha  replies by painting a comprehensive portrait of the buddhist path of training, illustrating each stage of the training with vivid similes.

> [!example]- 🌐[[DA28]] - 📜[Available texts](obsidian://search?query=file:da28-) - 布吒婆樓 – With Poṭṭhapāda 
>  The wandering ascetic potthapada brings to the Buddha  a tangle of questions concerning the nature of perception. The Buddha  clears up the matter by reviewing the fundamentals of concentration meditation and showing how it can lead to the ultimate cessation of perception.
>  The Buddha  discusses with a wanderer the nature of perception and how it evolves through deeper states of meditation. None of these, however, should be identified with a self or soul

> [!example]- 🌐[[DA29]] - 📜[Available texts](obsidian://search?query=file:da29-) - 露遮 – Lohitya 
>  A brahmin has fallen into the idea that there is no point in trying to offer spiritual help to others. The Buddha  goes to see him, and persuades him of the genuine benefits of spiritual teaching
>  A non-buddhist poses some good questions: if Dhamma is something that one must realize for oneself, then what is the role of a teacher? Are there any teachers who don't deserve some sort of criticism? The Buddha 's reply includes a sweeping summary of the entire path of practice.
