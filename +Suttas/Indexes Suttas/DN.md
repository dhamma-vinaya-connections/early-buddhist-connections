### DN1-10 - Silakkhandhavagga - Ethics Spectrum
> [!example]- 🌐[[DN1]] - 📜[Available texts](obsidian://search?query=file:dn1-) - Brahmajāla Sutta – Prime Net 
>  In this important sutta, the first in the tipitaka, the Buddha  describes sixty-two philosophical and speculative views concerning the self and the world that were prevalent among spiritual seekers of his day. In rejecting these teachings — many of which thrive to this day — he decisively establishes the parameters of his own.
>  While others may praise or criticize the Buddha , they tend to focus on trivial details. The Buddha  presents an analysis of 62 kinds of wrong view, seeing through which one becomes detached from meaningless speculations

>  The newly crowned king Ajātasattu is disturbed by the violent means by which he achieved the crown. He visits the Buddha  to find peace of mind, and asks him about the benefits of spiritual practice. This is one of the greatest literary and spiritual texts of early buddhism.
>  King ajatasattu asks the Buddha , "what are the fruits of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?" The Buddha  replies by painting a comprehensive portrait of the buddhist path of training, illustrating each stage of the training with vivid similes.

>  A brahmin wishes to undertake a great sacrifice, and asks for the Buddha ’s advice. The Buddha  tells a legend of the past, in which a king is persuaded to give up violent sacrifice, and instead to devote his resources to supporting the needy citizens of his realm. However, even such a beneficial and non-violent sacrifice pales in comparison to the spiritual sacrifice of giving up attachments

> [!example]- 🌐[[DN6]] - 📜[Available texts](obsidian://search?query=file:dn6-) - Mahāli Sutta – With Mahāli 
>  The Buddha  explains to a diverse group of lay people how the results of meditation depend on the manner of development

> [!example]- 🌐[[DN10]] - 📜[Available texts](obsidian://search?query=file:dn10-) - Subha Sutta – With Subha

### DN11-20 - Silakkhandhavagga - Ethics Spectrum
> [!example]- 🌐[[DN11]] - 📜[Available texts](obsidian://search?query=file:dn11-) - Kevaṭṭa Sutta – With Kevaddha 
>  The Buddha  refuses to perform miracles, explaining that this is not the right way to inspire faith. He goes on to tell the story of a monk whose misguided quest for answers led him as far as Brahmā
>  This discourse explores the role of miracles and conversations with heavenly beings as a possible basis for faith and belief. The Buddha  does not deny the reality of such experiences, but he points out that — of all possible miracles — the only reliable one is the miracle of instruction in the proper training of the mind. As for heavenly beings, they are subject to greed, anger, and delusion, and so the information they give — especially with regard to the miracle of instruction — is not necessarily trustworthy. Thus the only valid basis for faith is the instruction that, when followed, brings about the end of one's own mental defilements.

>  A non-buddhist poses some good questions: if Dhamma is something that one must realize for oneself, then what is the role of a teacher? Are there any teachers who don't deserve some sort of criticism? The Buddha 's reply includes a sweeping summary of the entire path of practice.

> [!example]- 🌐[[DN13]] - 📜[Available texts](obsidian://search?query=file:dn13-) - Tevijja Sutta – Three Knowledges

>  This wide-ranging sutta, the longest one in the pali canon, describes the events leading up to, during, and immediately following the death and final release (parinibbana) of the Buddha . This colorful narrative contains a wealth of Dhamma teachings, including the Buddha 's final instructions that defined how buddhism would be lived and practiced long after the Buddha 's death — even to this day.

>  This sutta offers comprehensive practical instructions on the development of mindfulness in meditation. The Buddha  describes how the development of continuous mindfulness of the four satipatthana ("foundations of mindfulness" or "frames of reference") — mindfulness of the body, of feelings, of the mind, and of mind-objects — can lead ultimately to full awakening
