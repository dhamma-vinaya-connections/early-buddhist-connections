## Thag2.11  Mahā Cunda

Listening well increases learning.

What is learned increases discernment.

Through discernment one knows the goal.

When known, the goal brings bliss.

Stay in isolated lodgings;

live for freedom from fetters.

If you don’t attain delight there,

then live in the Saṅgha,

your mind protected,

mindful.

## Thag2.13  Heraññakāni

Days & nights

fly past.

Life

comes to an end.

The span of mortals

runs out,

like the water of a piddling stream.

But the fool doing evil deeds

doesn’t realize that later

it’s bitter for him:

evil for him

the result.

## Thag2.16  Mahākāla

This swarthy woman

 a corpse for cremation]

—crow-like, enormous—

breaking a thigh & then the other

thigh,

breaking an arm & then the other

arm,

cracking open the head,

like a pot of curds,

she sits with them heaped up beside her.

Whoever, unknowing,

makes acquisitions

—the fool—

returns over & over

to suffering & stress.

So, discerning,

don’t make acquisitions.

May I never lie

with my head cracked open

again.

## Thag2.17  Tissa

He gains many enemies,
	one who—shaven-headed,
	wearing an outer robe—
gains food, drink, cloth, lodgings.

Knowing this drawback,
this great danger in honors,
a monk, gaining little,
not soggy,(#) 
should go forth
	mindfully.

Note

1. On the meaning of “soggy,” see [] and [].

## Thag2.19  Nanda

From inappropriate attention
I was devoted to ornament,
	restless & vain,
driven by sensual passion.

With the help of the Buddha,
the Kinsman of the Sun,
skilled in strategies,
I, practicing appropriately,
	plucked my mind
out of becoming.

## Thag2.24  Valliya

What needs to be done

with firm persistence,

what needs to be done

by one who hopes for awakening,

that I will do.

I will not fail.

See: persistence & striving!

You show me the path:

the straight,

the plunge into deathlessness.

I, through sagacity,

will reach it, know it,

as the stream of the Ganges,

the sea.

## Thag2.26  Puṇṇamāsa

Shedding five hindrances(#) 

to reach rest from the yoke,

taking the Dhamma as mirror

my own knowledge & vision,

I reflected on this body—

the whole thing,

inside & out,

my own & others’.

How vain & empty the body appeared!

Note

1. The five hindrances are sensual desire, ill will, sloth & drowsiness, restlessness & anxiety, and uncertainty. See [].

## Thag2.27  Nandaka

Just as a fine thoroughbred steed

stumbling, regains its stance,

feeling all the more urgency,

& draws its burden

undaunted.

In the same way, remember me:

consummate in vision,

a disciple of the Rightly

Self-awakened One,

the Awakened One’s thoroughbred child,

his son.

## Thag2.3  Valliya

A monkey,

coming to the little hut

with five doors,

goes from door to door, knocking

moment by moment.

Stand still, monkey,

don’t run.

It’s not yours

as it was before.

You’re bound by discernment.

You won’t get far away.

See also: []

## Thag2.30  Kaṇhadinna

Men of integrity

have been attended to,

the Dhamma repeatedly

listened to.

Having listened,

I followed the straight way,

the plunge into deathlessness.

Passion for becoming,(#) 

having been killed by me,

no further such passion

is found in me.

It neither was

nor will be

nor is found in me

even now.

Note

_1. Becoming (bhava) is a term to describe a sense of identity in a particular world of experience, which can develop on any of three levels: sensuality, form, or formlessness. Craving for becoming is one of the causes of stress and suffering; passion for becoming is one of the last fetters abandoned at full awakening. For more on the topic of becoming, see The Paradox of Becoming._

## Thag2.32  Sivaka

Inconstant little houses:

now here,

now there,       again

& again,

I sought the house-builder.

Painful is birth, again

& again.

House-builder, you’re seen!

You will not build a house again.

All your rafters are broken,

and your gables torn down.

Released from restriction, the mind

will

be blown out

right here.(#) 

Note

1. Compare []:

Through the round of many births I roamed

without reward,

without rest,

seeking the house-builder.

Painful is birth again

& again.

House-builder, you’re seen!

You will not build a house again.

All your rafters broken,

the roof plate destroyed,

immersed what’s without limits, the mind

will

diffuse

right here

## Thag2.36  Khitaka

Whose mind, standing like rock,

doesn’t shake,

dispassionate for things that spark passion,

unprovoked by things that spark provocation?

When one’s mind is developed like this,

from where can there come to him

suffering & stress?

My mind, standing like rock,

doesn’t shake,

dispassionate for things that spark passion,

unprovoked by things that spark provocation.

When my mind is developed like this,

from where can there come to me

suffering & stress?

See also: []; []–4](../Ud/ud3_2.html); []

## Thag2.37  Soṇa Poṭiriyaputta

It’s not for sleeping,

the night garlanded

with zodiac stars.

The night, for one who knows,

is for staying awake.

If I were to fall from my elephant’s shoulder,

and a tusker trampled me,

death in battle would be better for me,

than that I, defeated,

survive.

See also: []

## Thag2.42  Dhammapāla

The young monk
devoted to the Buddha’s message,
is wakeful among those who sleep.
	His life is not in vain.

So, intelligent,
one should commit oneself
to conviction & virtue,
confidence & Dhamma-vision,
	remembering the Buddhas’ message.

## Thag2.43  Brahmāli

Whose faculties have been made tranquil,
like horses well-tamed by a charioteer —
effluents abandoned,
envied even by devas,
	Such?

My faculties have been made tranquil
like horses well-tamed by a charioteer —
effluents abandoned,
I’m envied even by devas.
	Such.

## Thag2.47  Anūpama

Coming into the conceit of delight, the mind

impales itself on a stake.

Wherever’s a stake, a chopping block,

there, only there, you turn.

_You,_ mind, I call an unlucky die.

_You,_ I call a mind-traitor.

You’ve gained a Teacher hard to gain.

Don’t urge me on to my loss.

## Thag2.9  Gotama

At ease sleep the sages

who

are not bound to women,

in whom

always to be protected

is the truth

very hard to gain.

Sensuality,

we’ve carried out

your execution.

No longer are we in your debt.

We go now to unbinding

where,

having gone,

one doesn’t

grieve.
