## Thag10.1  Kāludāyin

_This is a poem in at least two parts. In the first part, Ven. Kāludāyin is addressing the Buddha soon after the latter’s awakening, inviting him to return home to visit his family. In the second part, Kāludāyin is addressing the Buddha’s father, Suddhodana, at the time of the Buddha’s return, perhaps to make Suddhodana favorably inclined to receive his son._

_There is a question, though, as to where the first part ends and the second begins. The Commentary assigns only the last stanza—beginning with, “I am the son of the Buddha”—to the second part, and everything before that to the first. This, however, doesn’t fit with the fact that the seventh stanza is obviously addressed to the person who engendered the Buddha, and not to the Buddha himself. For this reason, I have placed the division into two parts after the sixth stanza, as the first six stanzas are unified by the theme of bearing fruit, with the fourth and fifth stanzas possibly included to remind the Buddha of the good results that would come to his family if he provided them with the opportunity to give him alms. Alternatively, the division could be placed after the fourth stanza, in that the fifth stanza could be interpreted as beginning a line of thought aimed at putting the listener into the proper mood to accept the principle of the results of good kamma seen not in this lifetime but in the next._

Covered in embers now are the trees,

shedding their canopy, lord, in search of fruit.

As if flaring up, they glow.

The time, great hero, partakes of savors.

The trees in bloom, delightful,

waft delights

all around, in all directions,

dropping their petals in hope of fruit.

Now, O hero, is the time to set forth.

Neither too cold nor too hot:

pleasant the season, lord, fit for a journey.

Let them see you—the Sakyans & Koliyans—

facing west, crossing in the Rohiṇī.(#) 

In hope they plow the field.

In hope the seed is sown.

In hope do merchants go to sea,

bringing back wealth.

Let the hope in which I stand bear fruit.(#) 

Again & again      they sow the seed.(#) 

Again & again      the deva-kings rain.

Again & again      farmers plow the fields.

Again & again      grain comes to the kingdom.

Again & again      beggars wander.

Again & again      lords of giving give.

Again & again      having given, the lords of giving

again & again      go to the heavenly place.

* * *

Truly, an enlightened(#) one of deep discernment 

cleanses, back for seven generations,

the family in which he’s born.

I would imagine you to be Sakka,(#) the deva of devas 

for you engendered a sage truly named.

Suddhodana is the name of the Great Seer’s father,

and Māyā name of the Buddha’s mother(#) 

who, having nurtured the bodhisatta with her womb,

at the break-up of the body, rejoices in the threefold divine realm.(#) 

She, Gotamī, having passed away,

having fallen away from here,

is now endowed with heavenly sensual pleasures.

She rejoices in the five strings of sensuality,

surrounded by those groups of devas.

I am the son of the Buddha,

who endures what is hard to endure—

Aṅgīrasa(#): incomparable, Such. 

You, Sakka, are my father’s father.

In the Dhamma, Gotama,

you are my grandfather.

## Thag10.2  Ekavihāriya—“Dwelling Alone”

_This poem, which is attributed to King Asoka’s younger brother, falls into three parts: The first expresses his initial desire to leave the life of the palace and go into the forest; the second depicts his going forth; and the third announces his awakening. Some scholars have suggested that many of the poems dealing with events in the lives of the early Buddhist monks and nuns may have originally been intended for dramatic performance, and this poem could easily have been written with that intent. The language of the original, with its heavy use of poetic terms, certainly indicates that the author had a literary background and was writing for a sophisticated audience._

If, in front or behind,

there is no one else,

it’s extremely pleasant

for one staying alone

in the forest.

Come then! Alone

I will go to the wilderness

praised     by the Awakened One

pleasant     for a resolute monk

dwelling alone.

Alone,

astute in my goal,

I’ll quickly enter the grove

—refreshing,

giving rapture

to meditators—

the haunt

of elephants in rut.

When the Cool Forest’s in full flower,

in a cool mountain gorge,

having bathed my limbs

I’ll walk back & forth

alone.

Ah, when will I dwell,

alone and free from companions,

in the refreshing great forest—

my task done,

effluent-free?

As I desire to do this,

may my purpose succeed.

I myself

will bring it about.

No one can do it

for anyone else.

* * *

I myself

bind on my armor.

I will enter the grove

and will not emerge

without having attained

the end of the effluents.

While soft breezes blow—

cool,

heavily, fragrantly scented—

I’ll make ignorance burst,

as I sit on a mountaintop.

In the forest covered with blossoms

or perhaps on a cool hillside,

blessed with the bliss of release,

on Giribbaja I’ll delight.(#) 

* * *

I am now he

whose resolves are fulfilled

like the moon on a full-moon night.

With effluents all

totally ended,

there is now no further becoming.

Note

1. Giribbaja is the ring of mountains surrounding Vulture’s Peak. [↩︎](#) 

## Thag10.5  Kappa

Full of the many clans of impurities,

the great manufacturer of excrement,

like a stagnant pool,

a great tumor,

great wound,

full of blood & lymph,

immersed in a cesspool,

trickling liquids,       the body

is oozing foulness—always.

Bound together with sixty sinews,

plastered with a stucco of muscle,

wrapped in a jacket of skin,

this foul body is of no worth at all.

Linked together with a chain of bones,

stitched together with tendon-threads,

it produces its various postures,

from being hitched up together.

Headed surely to death,

in the presence of the King of Mortality,

the man who learns to discard it right here,

goes wherever he wants.

Covered with ignorance,

the body’s tied down with a four-fold tie,(#) 

sunk in the floods,(#) 

caught in the net of obsessions,(#) 

conjoined with five hindrances,(#) 

given over to thought,

accompanied with the root of craving,

roofed with delusion’s roofing.

That’s how the body functions,

compelled by the compulsion of kamma,

but its attainment ends

in ruin.

Its many becomings go

to ruin.

These who hold to this body as _mine_

—blind fools, people run-of-the-mill—

fill the horrific cemetery,

taking on further becoming.

Those who stay uninvolved with this body

—as they would with a serpent

smeared with dung—

disgorging the root of becoming,(#) 

will, without effluent,

totally unbind.

## Thag10.7  Gotama

You should know what’s to your benefit.

You should take a good look

at the Buddha’s word

& at what’s fitting here

for one who has entered

on the contemplative life.

An admirable friend right here,

undertaking the complete training,

& obedience to teachers:

This is fitting

for a contemplative.

Respect for the Buddhas,

honoring the Dhamma

as it has come to be,

& thinking highly of the Saṅgha:

This is fitting

for a contemplative.

Fitting behavior & range of association,

a livelihood purified, blameless,

the establishing of the mind:

This is fitting

for a contemplative.

Virtuous in what you do

& what you abstain from doing,

inspiring comportment,

commitment to the heightened mind:

This is fitting

for a contemplative.

Wilderness lodgings,

secluded, with next-to-no noise,

right for sages to resort to:

This is fitting

for a contemplative.

Virtue, learning,

investigating

phenomena,

mental qualities,

as they have come to be:

This is fitting

for a contemplative.

You should develop

inconstancy,

the perception of not-self,

the perception of unattractiveness,

& distaste for the world:

This is fitting

for a contemplative.

You should develop

the factors for awakening,

the bases for success,

the faculties,

& the noble eightfold path:

This is fitting

for a contemplative.

A sage should abandon craving,

should cut through the effluents, root & all,

should dwell fully released:

This is fitting

for a contemplative.
