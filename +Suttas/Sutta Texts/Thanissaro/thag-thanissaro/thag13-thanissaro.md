## Thag 13  Soṇa Koḷivisa

Who once was highly exalted in the state,

having gone into the service of the king of Aṅga,(#) 

today is exalted in qualities:

Soṇa, gone beyond suffering.

Five should be cut, five abandoned,

and five above all developed.

Having gone past five bonds,(#) 

a monk is said to be

one who’s crossed over.

For a monk who is insolent, heedless,

wishing for what’s outside,

virtue, concentration, & discernment

don’t go to completion,

because what should be done is cast        aside,

what shouldn’t be done        is done.

For those who are insolent, heedless,

their effluents increase.

But those whose mindfulness immersed in the body

is constantly well-undertaken,

—who don’t engage in what shouldn’t be done,

who persevere in what should be done,

mindful, alert—

their effluents go to their end.

Go by the straight path pointed out,

don’t turn back.

You yourself should reprove yourself(#) 

should advance to unbinding.

When I overexerted my effort,

the Teacher unexcelled in the world,

the One with Eyes,

making the lute simile,

taught me the Dhamma.

I, having heard his words,

dwelled delighting in his bidding.

I practiced in tune,(#) 

attaining the foremost goal.

The three knowledges are attained.

The Buddha’s bidding, done.

When one’s awareness is dedicated(#) 

to renunciation, seclusion,

non-afflictiveness, the ending of clinging,

the ending of craving, & non-deludedness,

seeing the arising of the sense media,

the mind is rightly released.

For that monk, rightly released,

his heart at peace.

There’s nothing to be done,

nothing to add

to what’s done.

As a single mass of rock isn’t moved by the wind,

even so all

forms, flavors, sounds,

aromas, contacts,

ideas desirable & not,

have no effect on one who is Such.

The mind

—still, totally released—

focuses on

their passing away.
