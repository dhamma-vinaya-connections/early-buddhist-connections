## Thag5.1  Rājadatta

I, a monk,

gone to the charnel ground,

saw a woman cast away,

discarded

there in the cemetery.

Though some were disgusted,

seeing her—dead, evil—

lust

appeared,

as if I were blind

to the oozings.

In less time than it takes

for rice to cook,

I got out of that place.

Mindful, alert, I

sat down to one side.

Then apt attention arose in me,

the drawbacks appeared,

disenchantment stood

at an even keel:

With that, my heart was released.

See the Dhamma’s true rightness!

The three knowledges

have been attained;

the Awakened One’s bidding,

done.

## Thag5.10  Yasadatta

Intent on quibbling,

the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.

He’s as far from the True Dhamma

as the ground is from the sky.

Intent on quibbling,

the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.

He wanes from the True Dhamma

like the moon in the dark half of the month.

Intent on quibbling,

the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.

He dries up in the True Dhamma

like a fish in next to no water.

Intent on quibbling,

the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.

He doesn’t grow in the True Dhamma,

like a rotten seed in a field.

But whoever hears the Conqueror’s teaching

with guarded(#) intent, 

doing away with effluents

—all—

realizing the unshakable,

attaining the foremost peace,

—effluent-free—

totally unbinds.

Note

1. Reading _guttena_ with the Thai edition. Other editions have _tuṭṭhena,_ “contented.”

## Thag5.8  Vakkali

Stricken by sharp, wind-like pains,

you, monk, living in the forest grove

—harsh, with limited range for alms—

what, what will you do?

Suffusing my body

with abundant rapture & joy,

& enduring what’s harsh,

I’ll stay in the grove.

Developing the establishings of mindfulness,

strengths, faculties,

the factors for awakening,(#) 

I’ll stay in the grove.

Reflecting on those who are resolute,

their persistence aroused,

constantly firm in their effort,

united in concord,

I’ll stay in the grove.

Recollecting the One Self-awakened,

self-tamed & centered,

untiring both day & night,

I’ll stay

in the grove.

Note

1. On the four establishings of mindfulness, see [] and []; on the five strengths, []; on the five faculties, []; and on the seven factors for awakening, [].
