## Thag6.10  Sumana the Novice

When I was seven

& newly gone forth,

having conquered with my power

the great powerful serpent,

I was fetching water for my preceptor

from the great lake, Anotatta,(#) 

when the Teacher saw me & said:

“Look, Sāriputta, at that one,

the young boy coming there,

carrying a pot of water,

well-centered within,

his practices—inspiring;

his bearing—admirable.

He’s Anuruddha’s novice,

mature in his powers,

made thoroughbred by a thoroughbred,

good by one who is good,

tamed by Anuruddha,

trained by one whose task

is done.

He,     having reached the highest peace

& realized the unshakable,

Sumana the novice

wants this:

‘Don’t let anyone know me.’”

Note

1. Anotatta: A fabulous lake located in the Himalayas, famed for the purity of its cool waters. Sumana would have had to use his psychic powers to fetch water from there.

## Thag6.12  Brahmadatta

_This poem repeats a poem attributed to the Buddha in []. The second and third stanzas also appear in a poem attributed to Sakka the deva-king in []._

Whence is there anger

in one without anger

tamed, calmed, living in tune,

released through right knowing,

Such?

You make things worse

when you flare up

at someone who’s angry.

Whoever doesn’t flare up

at someone who’s angry

wins a battle

hard to win.

You live for the good of both

—your own, the other’s—

when, knowing the other’s provoked,

you mindfully grow calm.

When you work the cure of both

—your own, the other’s—

those who think you a fool

know nothing of Dhamma.

If anger arises,

reflect on the saw simile.(#) 

If craving for savor,

remember the son’s-flesh simile.(#) 

If your mind runs loose

after sensual pleasures

& states of becoming,

quickly restrain it with mindfulness

as you would a bad ox

eating grain.(#) 

## Thag6.13  Sirimaṇḍa

Rain soddens what’s covered

& doesn’t sodden what’s exposed.

So open up what’s covered up,

so that it won’t get soddened by the rain.(#) 

Attacked by death

is the world,

surrounded by aging,

beset by the arrow of craving,

always obscured by desire.

Attacked by death

is the world,

& encircled by aging,

constantly beaten, with no shelter,

like a thief

sentenced to punishment.

They encroach like masses of flame,

these three:

death, aging, & illness.

There’s no strength to confront them,

no speed to run away.

Make the day not-in-vain,

a little or a lot.

However much

the day passes,

that’s how much less

is life.

Your last day approaches.

This isn’t your time

to be heedless.

## Thag6.2  Tekicchakāni

The grain: harvested.

The rice: gone to be threshed.

But I don’t get any alms.

How will I get by?

Confident, recollect

the immeasurable Buddha.

Your body pervaded with rapture,

you’ll be at the height

of continual joy.

Confident, recollect

the immeasurable Dhamma.

Your body pervaded with rapture,

you’ll be at the height

of continual joy.

Confident, recollect

the immeasurable Saṅgha.

Your body pervaded with rapture,

you’ll be at the height

of continual joy.

You live in the open air.

Cold are these wintry nights.

Don’t suffer, overcome with the cold.

Go into your hut, with its fastened bolt.

I’ll fasten the four

immeasurables.(#) 

With them, I’ll dwell

in comfort.

I won’t suffer from the cold,

dwelling

unperturbed.

Note

1. Concentration based on immeasurable goodwill, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity. See [] and []. [↩︎](#)

## Thag6.3  Mahānāga

One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life

is not found,

wastes away from the True Dhamma

like a fish in next to no water.

One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life

is not found,

doesn’t grow in the True Dhamma,

like a rotten seed in a field.

One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life

is not found,

is far away from unbinding

in the teaching of the Dhamma king.

One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life

is found,

doesn’t waste away from the True Dhamma

like a fish in plentiful water.

One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life

is found,

grows in the True Dhamma,

like an excellent seed in a field.

One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life

is found,

stands right in the presence of unbinding

in the teaching of the Dhamma king.

## Thag6.5  Māluṅkyaputta

When a person lives heedlessly,

his craving grows like a creeping vine.

He runs now here

& now      there,

as if looking for fruit:

a monkey in the forest.

If this sticky, uncouth craving

overcomes you in the world,

your sorrows grow like wild grass

after rain.

If, in the world, you overcome

this uncouth craving, hard to escape,

sorrows roll off you,

like water beads off

a lotus.

To all of you gathered here

I say:

Good fortune.

Dig up craving

—as when seeking medicinal roots, wild grass—

by the root.

Don’t let Māra cut you down

—as a raging river, a reed—

over & over again.(#) 

Do what the Buddha says.

Don’t let the moment pass by.

Those for whom the moment is past

grieve, consigned to hell.(#) 

Heedlessness is dust.

Dust follows on heedlessness.

Through heedfulness, knowledge,

pull out

your own arrow

on your own.

## Thag6.6  Sappadāsa

Twenty five years since my going forth,

and no peace of awareness

—not a finger-snap’s worth—

attained.

Having gained no oneness of mind,

I was wracked with lust.

Wailing, with my arms upheld,

I ran amok from my dwelling—

“Or… or shall I take the knife?

What’s the use of life to me?

If I were to renounce the training,

what sort of death would I have?”

So, taking a razor,

I sat down on a bed.

And there was the razor,

placed ready to cut my own vein,

when apt attention arose in me,

the drawbacks appeared,

disenchantment stood

at an even keel:

With that, my heart was released.

See the Dhamma’s true rightness!

The three knowledges

have been attained;

the Awakened One’s bidding,

done.

## Thag6.9  Jenta, the Royal Chaplain’s Son

I was

drunk with the intoxication

of my birth, wealth, & sovereignty.

Drunk with the intoxication

of my body’s build, coloring, & form,

I wandered about,

regarding no one

as my equal or better.

Foolish, arrogant, haughty,

my banner held high.

I—disrespectful, arrogant, proud—

bowed down to no one,

not even

mother,

father,

or those commonly held

in respect.

Then—seeing the ultimate leader,

supreme, foremost of charioteers,

like a blazing sun,

arrayed with a squadron of monks—

casting away pride & intoxication

through an awareness serene & clear,

I bowed down

my

head

to him, supreme

among all living beings.

Haughtiness & contempt

have been abandoned

—rooted out—

the conceit “I am” is extracted,

all forms of pride, destroyed.
