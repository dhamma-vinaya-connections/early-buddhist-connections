# 4:2  The Cave Octet

Staying attached to the cave,

covered heavily over,(#) 

a person sunk in confusion

is far from seclusion—

for          sensual pleasures

sensual desires(#) 

in the world

are not lightly let go.

Those chained by desire,

bound by becoming’s allure,

aren’t easily released

for there’s no liberation by others.

Intent, in front or behind,(#) 

on hunger for sensual pleasures

here or before—

greedy

for sensual pleasures,

busy, deluded, ungenerous,

entrenched in the discordant way,(#) 

they—impelled into pain—lament:

“What will we be

when we pass on from here?”

So a person should train

right here-&-now.

Whatever you know

as discordant in the world,

don’t, for its sake, act discordantly,

for that life, the enlightened say,

is short.

I see them,

in the world, floundering around,

people immersed in craving

for states of becoming.

Base people moan in the mouth of death,

their craving, for states of becoming & not-,(#) 

unallayed.

See them,

floundering in their sense of _mine,_

like fish in the puddles

of a dried-up stream—

and, seeing this,

live with no _mine,_

not forming attachment

for states of becoming.

Subdue desire

for both sides,(#) 

comprehending(#) sensory contact, 

with no greed.

Doing nothing for which

he himself

would rebuke himself,

the enlightened person doesn’t adhere

to what’s seen,

to what’s heard.

Comprehending perception,

he’d cross over the flood—

the sage not stuck

on possessions.

Then, with arrow removed,

living heedfully, he longs for neither—

this world,

the next.

vv. 772–779
