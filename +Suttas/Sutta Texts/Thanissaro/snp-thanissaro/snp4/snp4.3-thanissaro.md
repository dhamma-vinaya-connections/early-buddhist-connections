# 4:3  The Corrupted Octet

There are some who dispute

corrupted at heart,

and those who dispute

their hearts set on truth,

but a sage doesn’t enter

a dispute that’s arisen,

which is why he has no rigidity

anywhere at all.

Now, how would one

led on by desire,

entrenched in his likes,

forming his own conclusions,

overcome his own views?

He’d dispute in line

with the way that he knows.

Whoever boasts to others, unasked,

of his practices, habits,

is, say the skilled,

ignoble by nature—

he who speaks of himself

of his own accord.

But a monk at peace,

fully unbound in himself,

not boasting of his habits

—”That’s how I am”—

_he,_ say the skilled,

is noble by nature—

he with no vanity

anywhere in the world.

One whose doctrines aren’t clean—

fabricated, formed, given preference

when he sees it to his own advantage—

relies on a peace

dependent

on the provoked.(#) 

Because entrenchments(#) in views 

aren’t easily overcome

when considering what’s grasped

among doctrines,

that’s why

a person embraces or rejects a doctrine—

in light of these very

entrenchments.

Now, one who is cleansed(#) 

has no theorized view

about states of becoming

or not-

anywhere in the world.

Having abandoned conceit(#) & illusion, 

by what means would he go?(#) 

He isn’t involved,

for one who’s involved

enters into disputes

over doctrines.

But how—in connection with what(#)— 

would you argue

with one uninvolved?

He has nothing

embraced or rejected,(#) 

has sloughed off every view

right here—every one.

vv. 780–787
