# 4:10  Before the Break-up (of the Body)

“Seeing how,

behaving how,

is one said to be

at peace?

Gotama, tell me about

—when asked about—

the ultimate person.”

The Buddha:

“Free from craving

before the break-up

 the body],

independent

of _before_

& _the end,_ (#) 

not classified _in between,_ (#) 

no preference is his.

Un-          angered,

un-          startled,

un-          boastful,

un-          anxious,

giving counsel unruffled,

_he_ is a sage,

his speech

under control.

Free from attachment

with regard to the future,

not sorrowing

over the past,

he sees seclusion

in the midst of sensory contacts.(#) 

He can’t be led

in terms of views.(#) 

Withdrawn, un-

deceitful, not

stingy, not

miserly, not

insolent, in-

offensive,

he doesn’t engage in

divisive speech.

Not drunk on enticements,

nor given to pride,

he’s gentle, quick-witted,

beyond conviction & dispassion.(#) 

Not in hopes of material gain

does he take on the training;

when without material gain

he isn’t upset.

Unobstructed     by craving,

he doesn’t               through craving(#) 

hunger for flavors.

Equanimous—always—mindful,

he doesn’t suppose himself

equal,

superior,

inferior,

in the world.

No swellings of pride

are his.

Whose dependencies

don’t exist

when, on knowing the Dhamma,

he’s in-

dependent;

in whom no craving is found

for becoming or not-:

_He_ is said

to be at peace,

un-intent

on sensual pleasures,

with nothing at all

to tie him down:

one who’s crossed over attachment.

He has no

children

cattle,

fields,

land.

In him you can’t pin down

what’s embraced

or rejected.(#) 

He has no preference

for that which people run-of-the-mill

or brahmans & contemplatives

might blame—

which is why

he is unperturbed

with regard to their words.

His greed gone,

not miserly,

the sage

doesn’t speak of himself

as among those who are higher,

equal,

or lower.

He,

theory-free,

goes to no theory.

For whom

nothing in the world

is his own,

who doesn’t grieve

over what is not,

who doesn’t enter into

doctrines

phenomena(#): 

_He_ is said

to be

at peace.”

vv. 848–861
