# 4:14  Quickly

“I ask the Kinsman of the Sun, the Great Seer,

about seclusion & the state of peace.

Seeing in what way is a monk unbound,

clinging to nothing in the world?”

“He should put an entire stop

to the root of objectification-classifications:

‘I am the thinker.’(#) 

He should train, always mindful,

to subdue any craving inside him.

Whatever truth he may know,

within or without,

he shouldn’t, because of it,

make himself hardened,

for that isn’t called

unbinding by the good.

He shouldn’t, because of it, think himself

better,

lower, or

equal.

Touched by contact in various ways,

he shouldn’t keep theorizing about self.

Stilled right within,

a monk shouldn’t seek peace from another,

from anything else.

For one stilled right within,

there’s nothing embraced,

so how rejected?(#) 

As in the middle of the sea

it is still,

with no waves upwelling,

so the monk—unperturbed, still—

should not swell himself

anywhere.”

“He whose eyes are open has described

the Dhamma he’s witnessed,

subduing danger.

Now tell us, sir, the practice:

the Pāṭimokkha & concentration.”

“One shouldn’t be careless with his eyes,

should close his ears to village-talk,

shouldn’t hunger for flavors,

or view anything in the world

as _mine._

When touched by contact,

he shouldn’t lament,

shouldn’t covet anywhere any

states of becoming,

or tremble at terrors.

When gaining food & drink,

staples & cloth,

he should not make a hoard.

Nor should he be upset

when receiving no gains.

Doing jhāna,           not footloose,

he should refrain     from restlessness,

shouldn’t be     heedless,

should live     in a noise-less abode.

Not making much of sleep,

ardent, given to wakefulness,

he should abandon weariness, deception,

laughter, sports,

sexual intercourse,

& all that goes with it;

should not practice casting spells,(#) 

interpret dreams, physical marks,

the stars, animal cries;

should not be devoted to

doing cures or inducing fertility.

A monk shouldn’t tremble at blame

or grow haughty with praise;

should dispel stinginess, greed,

divisive speech, anger;

shouldn’t buy or sell

or revile anyone anywhere;

shouldn’t linger in villages,

or flatter people in hope of gains.

A monk shouldn’t boast

or speak with ulterior motive,

shouldn’t train in insolence

or speak quarrelsome words;

shouldn’t engage in lies

or knowingly cheat;

shouldn’t despise others for their

life,

discernment,

habits,

or practices.

Annoyed on hearing many words

from contemplatives

or ordinary people,

he shouldn’t respond harshly,

for those who retaliate

aren’t calm.

Knowing this teaching,

a monk inquiring

should always

train in it mindfully.

Knowing unbinding as peace,

he shouldn’t be heedless

of Gotama’s message—

for he, the Conqueror unconquered,

witnessed the Dhamma,

not by hearsay,

but directly, himself.

So, heedful, you

should always do homage & train

in line with that Blessed One’s message,”

the Blessed One said.(#) 

vv. 915–934
