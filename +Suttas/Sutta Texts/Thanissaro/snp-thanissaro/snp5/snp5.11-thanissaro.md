# 5:11  Jatukaṇṇin’s Question

Hearing, hero,

of one with no desire for sensuality,

I’ve come to ask

the one gone beyond the flood,

sensuality-free:

Tell me the state of peace,

Blessed One, Simultaneous Eye.(#) 

Tell me

as it actually is.

For the Blessed One lives

having conquered sensuality,

as the radiant sun, in its radiance,

the earth.

Limited my discernment,

O Deeply Discerning.

Teach me to know the Dhamma,

the abandoning here

of birth

& aging.

The Buddha:

Subdue greed for sensuality,

& see renunciation as rest.

Let there be nothing grasped

or rejected by you.

Burn up what’s _before,_

and have nothing for _after._

If you don’t grasp

at what’s _in between,(#)_ 

you will go about, calm.

One completely devoid of greed

for name-&-form, brahman,

has

no effluents

by which he would go

under Māra’s sway.

vv. 1096–1100
