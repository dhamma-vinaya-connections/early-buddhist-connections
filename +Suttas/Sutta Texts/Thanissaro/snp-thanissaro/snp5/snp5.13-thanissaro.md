# 5:13  Udaya’s Questions

To the one in jhāna—

seated, dustless,

passionless,

his task done,

effluent-free,

gone to the beyond

of all phenomena—

I’ve come with a desire for a question.

Tell me the gnosis of emancipation,

the breaking open

of ignorance.

The Buddha:

The abandoning

both of sensual desires,

& of unhappiness,

the dispelling of sloth,

the warding off of anxieties,

equanimity-&-mindfulness purified,

with inspection of mental qualities

swift in the forefront:

That I call the gnosis of emancipation,(#) 

the breaking open

of ignorance.(#) 

Udaya:

With what

is the world fettered?

With what

is it examined?

Through the abandoning of what

is there said to be

unbinding?

The Buddha:

With delight

the world’s fettered.

With directed thought

it’s examined.

Through the abandoning of craving

is there said to be

unbinding.

Udaya:

Living mindful in what way

does one bring consciousness

to a halt?

We’ve come to ask

the Blessed One.

Let us hear your words.

The Buddha:

Not relishing feeling,

inside or out:

One living mindful in this way

brings consciousness

to a halt.(#) 

vv. 1105–1111
