# 1:2  Dhaniya the Cattleman

Dhaniya the cattleman:(#) 

“The rice is cooked,

my milking done.

I live with my people

along the banks of the Mahi;

my hut is roofed, my fire lit:

So if you want, rain-god,

go ahead & rain.”

The Buddha:

“Free from anger,

my rigidity gone,(#) 

I live for one night

along the banks of the Mahi;

my hut’s roof is open, my fire out.(#) 

So if you want, rain-god,

go ahead & rain.”

Dhaniya:

“No mosquitoes or gadflies

are to be found.

The cows range in the marshy meadow

where the grasses flourish.

They could stand the rain if it came:

So if you want, rain-god,

go ahead & rain.”

The Buddha:

“A raft, well-made,

has been lashed together.(#) 

Having crossed over,

gone to the far shore,

I’ve subdued the flood.

No need for a raft

is to be found(#): 

So if you want, rain-god,

go ahead & rain.”

Dhaniya:

“My wife is composed, not wanton,

is charming, has lived with me long.

I hear no evil about her at all:

So if you want, rain-god,

go ahead & rain.”

The Buddha:

“My mind is composed, released,

has long been nurtured, well tamed.

No evil is to be found in me:

So if you want, rain-god,

go ahead & rain.”

Dhaniya:

“I support myself on my earnings.

My sons live in harmony,

free from disease.

I hear no evil about them at all:

So if you want, rain-god,

go ahead & rain.”

The Buddha:

“I’m in no one’s employ,(#) 

I wander the whole world

on the reward  my Awakening].

No need for earnings

is to be found:

So if you want, rain-god,

go ahead & rain.”

Dhaniya:

“There are cows, young bulls,

cows in calf, & breeding cows,

& a great bull, the leader of the herd:

So if you want, rain-god,

go ahead & rain.”

The Buddha:

“There are no cows, no young bulls,

no cows in calf or breeding cows,

no great bull, the leader of the herd(#): 

So if you want, rain-god,

go ahead & rain.”

Dhaniya:

“The stakes are dug-in, immovable.

The new muñja-grass halters, well-woven,

not even young bulls could break:

So if you want, rain-god,

go ahead & rain.”

The Buddha:

“Having broken my bonds

like a great bull,

like a great elephant

tearing a rotting vine,(#) 

I never again

will lie in the womb:

So if you want, rain-god,

go ahead & rain.”(#) 

The great cloud rained down

straightaway,

filling the lowlands & high.

Hearing the rain-god pour down,

Dhaniya said:

“How great our gain

that we’ve gazed

on the Blessed One!

We go to him,

the One with Eyes,(#) 

for refuge.

May you be our teacher, Great Sage.

My wife & I are composed.

Let’s follow the holy life

under the One Well-Gone.

Gone to the far shore

of aging & death,

let’s put an end

to suffering & stress.”

Māra:(#) 

“Those with children

delight

because of their children.

Those with cattle

delight

because of their cows.

A person’s delight

comes from acquisitions,

for a person with no acquisitions

doesn’t delight.”

The Buddha:

“Those with children

grieve

precisely because of their children.

Those with cattle

grieve

precisely because of their cows.

A person’s grief

comes from acquisitions,

for a person with no acquisitions

doesn’t grieve.”(#) 

vv.18–34
