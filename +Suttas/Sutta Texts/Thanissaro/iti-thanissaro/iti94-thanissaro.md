# Itivuttaka 94

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, a monk should investigate in such a way that–his consciousness neither externally scattered & diffused, nor internally positioned–he is, from lack of clinging/sustenance, unagitated, and there is no coming into being of the origination of future birth, aging, death, or stress.”(#) 

For a monk who has abandoned

seven attachments

and cut the guide:(#) 

the wandering-on in birth

is finished;

there is, for him,

no further becoming.
