# Itivuttaka 108

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, any monks who are deceitful, stubborn, talkers, frauds, arrogant, & uncentered are not followers of mine. They have turned away from this Dhamma-&-Vinaya. They attain, in terms of this Dhamma-&-Vinaya, no growth, increase, or abundance.

“But any monks who are not deceitful, not talkers, who are enlightened, pliant, & well-centered: they are followers of mine. They have not turned away from this Dhamma-&-Vinaya. They attain, in terms of this Dhamma-&-Vinaya, growth, increase, & abundance.

Deceitful, stubborn, talkers, frauds,

arrogant, uncentered:

they don’t grow in the Dhamma

taught by the Rightly

Self-awakened One.

Not deceitful, not talkers,

enlightened, pliant,

well-centered:

they grow in the Dhamma

taught by the One

Rightly

Self-awakened.
