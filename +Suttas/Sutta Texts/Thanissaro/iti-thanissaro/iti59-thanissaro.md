# Itivuttaka 59

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Endowed with three qualities, monks, a monk has passed beyond Māra’s domain and shines like the sun. Which three? There is the case where a monk is endowed with the aggregate of virtue of one beyond training , an Arahant], the aggregate of concentration of one beyond training, the aggregate of discernment of one beyond training. Endowed with these three qualities a monk has passed beyond Māra’s domain and shines like the sun.”

Virtue, concentration, discernment:

one in whom these are well-developed,

passing beyond Māra’s domain,

shines

like the sun.
