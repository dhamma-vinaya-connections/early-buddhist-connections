# Itivuttaka 1

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Abandon one quality, monks, and I guarantee you non-return. Which one quality? Abandon greed as the one quality, and I guarantee you non-return.”(#) _This is the meaning of what the Blessed One said. So with regard to this it was said:_(#)  

The greed with which

beings go to a bad destination,(#) 

coveting:

from rightly knowing that greed,

those who see clearly

let go.

Letting go,

they never come to this world

again.

_This, too, was the meaning of what was said by the Blessed One, so I have heard._(#)
