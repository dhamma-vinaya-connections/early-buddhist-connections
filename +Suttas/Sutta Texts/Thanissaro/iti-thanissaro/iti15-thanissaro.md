# Itivuttaka 15

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, I don’t envision even one other fetter–fettered by which beings conjoined go wandering & transmigrating on for a long, long time–like the fetter of craving. Fettered with the fetter of craving, beings conjoined go wandering & transmigrating on for a long, long time.”

With craving his companion, a man

wanders on a long, long time.

Neither in this state here

nor anywhere else

does he go beyond

the wandering-on.

Knowing this drawback–

that craving brings stress into play–

free               from craving,

devoid of clinging,

mindful,               the monk

lives the mendicant life.
