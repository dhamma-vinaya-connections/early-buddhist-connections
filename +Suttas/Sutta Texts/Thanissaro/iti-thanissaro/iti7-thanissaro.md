# Itivuttaka 7

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, one who has not fully known & fully understood the All,(#) whose mind has not been cleansed of passion for it, has not abandoned it, is incapable of putting an end to stress. But one who has fully known & fully understood the All, whose mind has been cleansed of passion for it and has abandoned it, is capable of putting an end to stress.” 

Knowing the All

from all around,

not stirred by passion

in all places:

he, having comprehended

the All,

has gone beyond

all stress.

Note

1. “The All” = the six senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, & ideation) and their respective objects. This covers every aspect of experience that can be described, but does not include _nibbāna._ For a full discussion of this point, see _The Mind Like Fire Unbound,_ pp. 30—32.

> **Edition Notice**  
Bhikkhu Thanissaro’s translations are arranged according to the Thai Tipitaka edition. Therefore, some sutta references may not align with the 6th Council or Suttacentral.net numbering schemes, especially in the Saṁyutta Nikāya (SN) and Aṅguttara Nikāya (AN).
