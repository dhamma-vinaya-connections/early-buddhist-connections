# Itivuttaka 21

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, there is the case where a certain person is clear-minded. Having encompassed that mind with  awareness, I discern, ‘If this person were to die at this instant, then as if he were to be carried off, he would thus be placed in heaven.’ Why is that? Because his mind is clear. It’s because of clear-mindedness that there are cases where some beings–at the break-up of the body, after death–reappear in a heavenly world.”

Knowing the case

of a clear-minded person,

the One Awakened explained its meaning

in the presence of the monks.

If that person

were to die at this instant,

he’d reappear in heaven

because his mind is clear–

as if he were carried off

and placed there.

It’s because of clear-mindedness

that beings go

to a good destination.
