# Itivuttaka 97

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, a monk who has admirable virtue, admirable qualities, & admirable discernment is called, in this Dhamma-&-Vinaya, one who is complete, fulfilled, a superlative person.

“And how is a monk a person with admirable virtue? There is the case where a monk is virtuous. He dwells restrained in accordance with the Pāṭimokkha, consummate in his behavior & sphere of activity. He trains himself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults. In this way a monk is a person with admirable virtue. Thus he is of admirable virtue.

“And how is a monk a person with admirable qualities? There is the case where a monk lives devoted to developing the seven  of] qualities that are wings to awakening.(#) In this way a monk is a person with admirable qualities. Thus he is of admirable virtue & admirable qualities. 

“And how is a monk a person with admirable discernment? There is the case where a monk–with the ending of effluents–remains in the effluent-free awareness-release & discernment-release, directly knowing & realizing it for himself right in the here-&-now. In this way a monk is a person with admirable discernment. Thus he is of admirable virtue, admirable qualities, admirable discernment. In this Dhamma-&-Vinaya he is called one who is complete, fulfilled, a superlative person.”

Devoid of wrong-doing

in thought, word, or deed,

he’s called a person of admirable virtue:

the monk conscientious.

Well-developed in the qualities

that go to the attainment of self-awakening,

he’s called a person of admirable qualities:

the monk unassuming.

Discerning right here for himself,

in himself,

the ending of stress

he’s called a person of admirable discernment:

the monk with no effluent.

Consummate in

these things,

untroubled, with doubt cut away,

unattached in all the world,

he’s said to have abandoned

the All.
