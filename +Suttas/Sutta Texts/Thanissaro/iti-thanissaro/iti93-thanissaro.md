# Itivuttaka 93

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, there are these three fires. Which three? The fire of passion, the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion. These are the three fires.”

The fire of passion burns in a mortal

delighting in,

smitten with

sensual desires;

the fire of aversion, in a malevolent person

taking life;

the fire of delusion, in a bewildered person

ignorant

of the noble teaching.

Not understanding these fires, people

–fond of self-identity–

unreleased from Māra’s shackles,

swell the ranks of hell,

the wombs of common animals, demons,

the realm of the hungry ghosts.

While those who, day & night,

are devoted

to the message

of the rightly self-awakened,

put out the fire of passion,

constantly perceiving the foul.

They, superlative people,

put out the fire of aversion

with good will,

and the fire of delusion

with the discernment leading

to penetration.

They, the masterful, untiring by night & day,

having put out  fires],

having,         without remainder,

comprehended stress,

are,            without remainder,

totally unbound.

They, the wise, with an attainer-of-wisdom’s

noble vision,

right gnosis,

directly knowing

the ending of birth,

come to no further becoming.
