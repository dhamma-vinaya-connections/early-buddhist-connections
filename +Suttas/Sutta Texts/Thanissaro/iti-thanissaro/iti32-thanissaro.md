# Itivuttaka 32

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Endowed with two things, monks, a person–as if carried off–is thus placed in hell. Which two? Evil habits & evil views. Endowed with these two things, a person–as if carried off–is thus placed in hell.”

Evil habits &

evil views:(#) 

a person, undiscerning,

endowed with these two things,

at the break-up of the body

reappears in hell.

Note

1. [] gives the following example of an evil view: “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive, when indulged in, are not genuine obstructions.” [] gives another example: “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on  birth to birth], not another.”

> **Edition Notice**
