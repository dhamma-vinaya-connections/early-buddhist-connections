# Itivuttaka 106

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, living with Brahma are those families where, in the home, mother & father are revered by the children. Living with the first devas are those families where, in the home, mother & father are revered by the children. Living with the first teachers are those families where, in the home, mother & father are revered by the children. Living with those worthy of gifts are those families where, in the home, mother & father are revered by the children. ‘Brahma’ is a synonym for mother & father. ‘The first devas’ is a synonym for mother & father. ‘The first teachers’ is a synonym for mother & father. ‘Those worthy of gifts’ is a synonym for mother & father. Why is that? Mother & father do much for their children. They care for them, nourish them, introduce them to this world.”

Mother & father,

compassionate to their family,

are called

Brahma,

first teachers,

those worthy of gifts

from their children.

So the wise should pay them

homage,

honor,

with food & drink,

clothing & bedding,

anointing & bathing,

& washing their feet.

Performing these services to their parents,

the wise

are praised right here

and after death

rejoice in heaven.
