# Itivuttaka 34

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, a person without ardency, without compunction, is incapable of self-awakening, incapable of Unbinding, incapable of attaining the unsurpassed safety from bondage. A person ardent & compunctious is capable of self-awakening, capable of Unbinding, capable of attaining the unsurpassed safety from bondage.”

With no ardency, no

compunction,

lazy, with low persistence,

full of sloth & drowsiness,

shameless, without respect:

he’s incapable,

a monk like this,

of touching superlative

self-awakening.

But whoever is mindful, masterful,

absorbed in jhāna,

ardent, concerned, & heedful,

cutting the fetter of birth & aging,

touches right here

a self-awakening un-

surpassed.
