# Itivuttaka 55

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, there are these three searches. Which three? The search for sensuality, the search for becoming, the search for a holy life. These are the three searches.”

Sensuality-search, becoming-search,

together with the holy-life search–

i.e., grasping at ‘such is the truth’

based on an accumulation

of viewpoints:

through the relinquishing of searches

& the abolishing of viewpoints

of one dispassionate to

all passion,

and released in the ending

of craving,

through the ending of searches, the monk

is without perplexity, free

of longing.
