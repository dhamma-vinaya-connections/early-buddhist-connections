# Itivuttaka 46

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, live with the trainings  heightened virtue, heightened mind, & heightened discernment] as your reward, with discernment uppermost, release the essence, & mindfulness the governing principle. As you live with the trainings as your reward, with discernment uppermost, release the essence, & mindfulness the governing principle, then one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right in the here-&-now, or–if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance–non-return.”

Complete in the training,

not subject to falling away,(#) 

one with discernment

uppermost,

seeing the stopping, the ending of birth:

that sage

bears his last body,

has shaken off Māra, I tell you,

has gone beyond aging.

So, always

delighting in jhāna,

centered,

ardent,

seeing the stopping, the ending of birth,

conquering Māra, along with his armies,(#) 

monks,

be gone-beyond aging & death.
