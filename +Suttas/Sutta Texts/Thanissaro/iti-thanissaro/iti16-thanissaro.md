# Itivuttaka 16

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, with regard to internal factors, I don’t envision any other single factor like appropriate attention(#) as doing so much for a monk in training,(#) who has not attained the heart’s aspiration but remains intent on the unsurpassed safety from bondage.(#) A monk who attends appropriately abandons what is unskillful and develops what is skillful.   

Appropriate attention

as a quality

of a monk in training:

nothing else

does so much

for attaining the superlative goal.

A monk, striving appropriately,

attains the ending of stress.
