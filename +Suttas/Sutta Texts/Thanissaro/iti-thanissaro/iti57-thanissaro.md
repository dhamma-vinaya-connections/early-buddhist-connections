# Itivuttaka 57

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, there are these three effluents. Which three? The effluent of sensuality, the effluent of becoming, the effluent of ignorance. These are the three effluents.”

His effluent of sensuality

ended,

his ignorance

faded away,

his effluent of becoming

exhausted:

one totally released, acquisition-free,

bears his last body,

having conquered Māra

along with his mount.

> **Edition Notice**  
Bhikkhu Thanissaro’s translations are arranged according to the Thai Tipitaka edition. Therefore, some sutta references may not align with the 6th Council or Suttacentral.net numbering schemes, especially in the Saṁyutta Nikāya (SN) and Aṅguttara Nikāya (AN).
