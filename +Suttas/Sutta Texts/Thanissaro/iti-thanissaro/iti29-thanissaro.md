# Itivuttaka 29

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Endowed with two things, monks, a monk lives in ease in the present life–untroubled, undistressed, & unfeverish–and at the break-up of the body, after death, a good destination can be expected. Which two? A guarding of the doors of the sense faculties, and knowing moderation in food. Endowed with these two things, a monk lives in ease in the present life–untroubled, undistressed, & unfeverish–and at the break-up of the body, after death, a good destination can be expected.”

Eye & ear & nose,

tongue, body, & mind:

when a monk has these doors well guarded

–knowing moderation in food,

restraining his senses–

he experiences ease:

ease in body, ease

in mind.

Not burning in body,

not burning in mind,

whether by day or by night,

one like this

lives in ease.
