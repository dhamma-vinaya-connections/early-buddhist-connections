# Itivuttaka 25

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, for the person who transgresses in one thing, I tell you, there is no evil deed that is not to be done. Which one thing? This: telling a deliberate lie.”

For the person who lies,

who transgresses in this one thing,

transcending concern for the world beyond:

there’s no evil

not to be done.
