# Itivuttaka 80

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, there are these three kinds of unskillful thinking. Which three? Thinking concerned with not wanting to be despised;(#) thinking concerned with gains, offerings, & tribute; thinking concerned with an empathy for others.(#) There are three kinds of unskillful thinking.”  

Fettered

to not wanting to be despised;

to gains, offerings, respect;

to delight in companions:

you’re far from the ending of fetters.

But whoever here,

having abandoned

sons,

cattle,

marriage,

intimates:

he’s capable

–a monk like this–

of touching superlative

self-awakening.
