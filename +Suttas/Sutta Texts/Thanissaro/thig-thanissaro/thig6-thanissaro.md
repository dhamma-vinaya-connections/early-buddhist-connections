## Thig6.1  Paṭācārā’s 500 Students

ṭācārā recounts the Buddha’s words:]

“You don’t know

the path

of his coming or going,

that being who has come

from       where?—

the one you lament as ‘my son.’

But when you know

the path

of his coming or going,

you don’t grieve after him,

for that is the nature

of beings.

Unasked,

he came from there.

Without permission,

he went from here

—coming from     where?—

having stayed a few days.

And coming one way from here,

he goes yet another

from there.

Dying in the human form,

he will go wandering on.

As he came, so he has gone—

so what is there

to lament?”

Pulling out

—completely out—

the arrow so hard to see,

embedded in my heart,

he  Buddha] expelled from me

—overcome with grief—

the grief

over my son.

Today—with arrow removed,

without hunger, entirely

unbound—

to the Buddha, Dhamma, & Saṅgha I go,

for refuge to

the Sage.

## Thig6.2  Vāsiṭṭhī the Madwoman

Overwhelmed with grief for my son—

naked, demented,

my hair disheveled

my mind deranged—

I went about here & there,(#) 

living along the side of the road,

in cemeteries & heaps of trash,

for three full years,

afflicted with hunger & thirst.

Then I saw

the One Well-Gone,

gone to the city of Mithilā:

tamer of those untamed,

Self-Awakened,

with nothing to fear

from anything, anywhere.

Regaining my mind,

paying him homage,

I sat myself down.

He, Gotama, from sympathy

taught me the Dhamma.

Hearing his Dhamma,

I went forth into homelessness.

Applying myself to the Teacher’s words,

I realized the state of auspicious bliss.

All griefs have been cut off,

abandoned,

brought to this end,

for I’ve comprehended

the grounds from which griefs

come into play.

Note

1. Reading _tena tena vicāri’ham_ with the Burmese, Sinhalese, and PTS editions. The Thai edition has _rodaṁ tena vicāri’ham,_ “I went there crying.”

## Thig6.3  Khemā

_In [], a variation of the verse attributed to Māra, and the first verse attributed here to Sister Khemā, are included in a poem attributed to Sister Vijayā (see []). Sister Khema’s second verse is attributed to Sister Aḷavikā in []. Her third verse also appears in []; its first half, in []._

Māra:

“You, a beautiful young woman;

I, a young man, full of youth.

Come, Khemā,

let’s enjoy ourselves

to the music of a five-piece band.”

Khemā:

“I’m disgusted, ashamed

of this putrid body—

disintegrating, dissolving.

Sensual craving

is rooted out.

Sensual pleasures

are like swords & spears;

the aggregates,

their executioner’s block.

What you call _sensual delight_

is _no delight_ for me.

Everywhere enjoyment

is defeated;

the mass of darkness,

burst.

So know,      Evil One,

that you have been,

End-maker,

struck down.”

* * *

Paying homage to the zodiac stars,

tending the fire in the forest,

not knowing it as it actually was,

fools, you conceived it

as purity.

Whereas I

am one who pays homage

to the One Self-awakened,

the utmost man.

I’m one who has done the Teacher’s bidding,

entirely released

from sufferings & stress.

## Thig6.4  Sujātā

Ornamented, well-dressed,

garlanded, sprinkled with sandalwood,

covered all over with jewelry,

surrounded by a group of slave-women,

taking food & drink,

and not a little staple & non-staple food,

leaving the house,

I fetched myself to the pleasure garden.

Having enjoyed ourselves & played there,

we headed back to our home.

I saw in Sāketa a hall at the Añjana wood.

I entered.

Seeing the light of the world,

I, paying homage, sat nearby.

He, the One with Eyes,(#) 

from sympathy,

taught me the Dhamma.

Hearing the Great Seer, I

fully penetrated

the truth.

Right there I touched the Dhamma,

dustless, the deathless state.

Then, knowing the True Dhamma,

I went forth

into homelessness.

The three knowledges

are attained.

The Buddha’s bidding

is not in vain.

Note

1. Since Vedic times, there has been a belief in India that the eyes of holy individuals where particularly powerful because they could see so deeply into reality. From this belief grew a further belief: that the eyes of such individuals were so powerful that their eyes could transmit some of that power to others. Thus, to be gazed on by such an individual, or to gaze into that individual’s eyes, was considered to be very auspicious. Sujātā’s reference to the Buddha as “the One with Eyes” carries all of these connotations. For more on this topic, see [] and  16, note 44](../../DN/DN16.html#dn16note44).

## Thig6.5  Anopamā, the Millionaire’s Daughter

Born in a high-ranking family

with much property, great wealth,

consummate in complexion & figure,

I was the daughter of Majjha, the treasurer.

Kings’ sons sought for me,

rich merchants’ sons

longed for me.

One of them sent my father a messenger,

saying, “Give me Anopamā.

I will give in return

eight times her weight

in jewels & gold.”

But I, having seen

the One Self-awakened,

unsurpassed, excelling the world,

paid homage to his feet,

sat down to one side.

He, Gotama, from sympathy,

taught me the Dhamma.

And as I sat in that very seat,

I attained the third fruit

 non-return.]

Then I cut off my hair,

and went forth into homelessness.

Today is the seventh day

since I made craving

wither away.

## Thig6.6  Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī

Awakened! Hero! Homage to you,

highest of all beings—

you who’ve released me

and many other people

from suffering!

I’ve     comprehended all stress,

dried up craving, the cause,

developed the eightfold path,(#) 

and touched cessation.

Before I was mother, son,

father, brother,

grandmother.

Not knowing things as they were,

I wandered on

without respite.

But now that I’ve seen the Blessed One,

this is my last body-heap.

Birth & wandering-on

are totally ended.

There is now

no further becoming.

I see the disciples gathered,

their persistence aroused,

resolute, constant

in strong exertion:

_This_ is the worship of the Buddhas.(#) 

Truly for the benefit of the many

did Māyā(#) give birth to Gotama, 

thrusting away the mass of pain

of those mired in illness & death.

## Thig6.7  Guttā

_ Buddha admonished me:]_

Guttā, devote yourself to the goal

for which you went forth,

having discarded 

for a dear son of your own.(#) 

Don’t fall under the sway

of the mind.

Hoodwinked by mind,

beings in love with Māra’s realm,

roam

through the many-birth wandering-on,

unknowing.

Abandoning these lower fetters, nun—

sensual desire, ill will,

self-identity views,

grasping at habits & practices,

and uncertainty as the fifth—

you won’t come

to this again.

Forsaking     passion, conceit,

ignorance, & restlessness

—cutting through  the fetters—

you will make an end

of suffering & stress.

Discarding birth & wandering-on,

comprehending further becoming,

free from hunger

in the right-here-&-now

you will go about

totally calmed.

## Thig6.8  Vijayā

Four times, five, I ran amok from my dwelling,

having gained no peace of awareness,

my thoughts out of control.

So, approaching a nun,

I cross-questioned her attentively.

She taught me the Dhamma:

aggregates, sense media, properties,

four noble truths,

five faculties,

seven factors for awakening,

the eightfold path

for attaining the highest goal.

Hearing her words,

I did her bidding.

In the first watch of the night,

I remembered past lives.

In the second watch of the night,

I purified the divine eye.

In the third watch of the night,

I burst the mass of darkness.

Then I stayed, suffusing(#) my body 

with rapture & pleasure.

On the seventh day, I stretched out my legs,

having burst the mass

of darkness.
