## Thig7.2  Cālā

_In [], verses similar to these are attributed to the nun Sīsūpacālā._

Cālā:

Having established mindfulness,

a nun with developed faculties,(#) I 

penetrated the peaceful state:

stilling-of-fabrications bliss.(#) 

Māra:

“For whose sake

have you shaved your head?

You look like a contemplative

but don’t approve of a philosophy,

so why are you wandering here

confused?”

Cālā:

“Outside philosophers place

their confidence in views.

They don’t know the Dhamma.(#) 

They’re not adept in the Dhamma.

But there is

the Awakened One,

born in the Sakyan clan,

a person without peer.(#) 

He taught me the Dhamma

for the transcending of views:

stress,

the co-arising of stress,

the overcoming of stress,

& the noble eightfold path

leading to the stilling of stress.(#) 

Having heard his words,

I dwell, delighting

in his bidding.

The three knowledges

are attained;

the Buddha’s bidding,

done.

Everywhere enjoyment

is defeated;

the mass of darkness,

burst.

So know,     Evil One,

that you have been,

End-maker,

struck down.

## Thig7.3  Upacālā

_In [], verses similar to these are attributed to the nun Cālā._

Upacālā:

Having mindfulness, having an eye that sees,

a nun with developed faculties, I

penetrated the peaceful state

of which worthless people

don’t partake.(#) 

Māra:

Why don’t you approve of birth?

One who is born

enjoys sensual pleasures.

Enjoy sensual delight!

Don’t later burn with regret.

Upacālā:

For one who is born

there’s death,(#) 

the cutting-off of hands & feet,

binding, flogging, torment.

One who’s born incurs pain.

But there is

the Rightly Awakened One,

the undefeated one,

born in the Sakyan clan.

He taught me the Dhamma

for the transcending of birth:

stress,

the co-arising of stress,

the overcoming of stress,

& the noble eightfold path

leading to the stilling of stress.

Having heard his words,

I dwell, delighting

in his bidding.

The three knowledges

are attained;

the Buddha’s bidding,

done.

Everywhere enjoyment

is defeated;

the mass of darkness,

burst.

So know,     Evil One,

that you have been,

End-maker,

struck down.
