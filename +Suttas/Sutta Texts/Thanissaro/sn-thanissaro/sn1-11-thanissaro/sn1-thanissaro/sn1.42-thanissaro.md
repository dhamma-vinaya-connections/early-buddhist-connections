## SN1.42 A Giver of What

## ## Kindada Sutta

A deva:

“A giver of what is a giver of strength?

A giver of what, a giver of beauty?

A giver of what, a giver of ease?

A giver of what, a giver of vision?

And who is a giver of everything?

Being asked, please explain this to me.”

The Buddha:

“A giver of food is a giver of strength.

A giver of clothes, a giver of beauty.

A giver of a vehicle, a giver of ease.

A giver of a lamp, a giver of vision.

And the one who gives a residence

is the one who’s a giver of everything.

But the one who teaches the Dhamma

is a giver of

the Deathless.”
