## SN1.7 Unpenetrated

## ## Appaṭividitā Sutta

_In light of the question as to how best to translate_ Buddha, _this sutta offers evidence in support of the translation, “awakened.” The verses draw a direct connection between two words derived from the same root: the adjective_ sambuddha, _a variant of_ buddha, _and the verb_ pābujjhati, _which in context clearly means to awaken from sleep._

* * *

Standing to one side, a devatā addressed the Blessed One with a verse:

“Those in whom

phenomena are unpenetrated,

who may be led

by the teachings of others:

Asleep are they;

they haven’t awakened.

It’s time for them

to awaken.”

The Buddha:

“Those in whom

phenomena are well-penetrated,

may not be led

by the teachings of others.

Awakened

through right knowing,

they go among the discordant

harmoniously.”[1](#sn1.7note01)
