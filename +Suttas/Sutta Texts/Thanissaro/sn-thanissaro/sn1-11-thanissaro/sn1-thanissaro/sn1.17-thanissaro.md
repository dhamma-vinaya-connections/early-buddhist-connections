## SN1.17 Hard to Do

## ## Dukkara Sutta

For the inexperienced,
the contemplative life is
	hard to do,	
	hard to endure,
for	many are the confinements there
in which a fool sinks.
How many days can you follow
the contemplative life
if you don’t block the mind?
Step by step you’d sink
under the sway of your resolves.[1](#sn1.17note01)

As a tortoise would draw
	its limbs
	into its shell,
so a monk should—
	the thoughts of his heart.
Independent, not mistreating others,
totally unbound,
he shouldn’t disparage
  anyone at all.
