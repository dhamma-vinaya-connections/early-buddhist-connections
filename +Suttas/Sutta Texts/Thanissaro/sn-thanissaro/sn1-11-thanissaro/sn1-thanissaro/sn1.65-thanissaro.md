## SN1.65 Bondage

## ## Bandhana Sutta

“With what 	is the world placed in bondage?
What 	is its exploration?
With the abandoning
of what
		are all bonds broken?”

“With delight 		is the world placed in bondage.
Directed thought		is its exploration.
With the abandoning
of craving
		all bonds are broken.”
