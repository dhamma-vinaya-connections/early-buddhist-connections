## SN1.25 An Arahant

## ## Arahanta Sutta

“An arahant monk,

one who is done,

effluent-free, bearing his last body:

Would he say, ‘I speak’?

Would he say, ‘They speak to me’?”

“An arahant monk,

one who is done,

effluent-free, bearing his last body:

He _would_ say, ‘I speak’;

would say, ‘They speak to me.’

Skillful,

knowing harmonious gnosis

with regard to the world,

he uses expressions

just as expressions.”

“An arahant monk,

one who is done,

effluent-free, bearing his last body:

Is it from conceit

that he’d say, ‘ I speak’?—

that he’d say, ‘They speak to me’?”[1](#sn1.25note01)

“For one whose conceit is abandoned,

whose knot of conceit is dispersed,

no knots exist

at all.

He, beyond any concept, wise,

would say, ‘I speak’;

would say, ‘They speak to me.’

Skillful,

knowing harmonious gnosis

with regard to the world,

he uses expressions

just as expressions.”
