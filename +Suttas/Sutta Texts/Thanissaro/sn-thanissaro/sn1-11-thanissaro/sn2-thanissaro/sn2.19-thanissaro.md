## SN2.19 Uttara the Deva’s Son

## ## Uttara Sutta

Near Rājagaha. As he was standing to one side, Uttara the deva’s son recited this verse in the Blessed One’s presence:

“Life is swept along,

next-to-nothing its span.

For one swept on by aging

no shelters exist.

Perceiving this danger in death,

one should do deeds of merit

that bring about bliss.”

The Buddha:

“Life is swept along,

next-to-nothing its span.

For one swept to old age

no shelters exist.

Perceiving this danger in death,

one should drop the world’s bait

and look for peace.”
