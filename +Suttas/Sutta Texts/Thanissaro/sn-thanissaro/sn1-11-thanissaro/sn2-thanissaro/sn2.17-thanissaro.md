## SN2.17 Subrahma the Deva’s Son

## ## Subrahma Sutta

Standing to one side, Subrahma the deva’s son recited this verse to the Blessed One:

“Constantly troubled is this mind,

constantly trembling this heart,

over duties[1](#sn2.17note01) that have yet to arise,

and those already arisen.

If there is an Untroubled,

point it out to me, when asked.”

The Buddha:

“Apart from the factors for awakening, austerity,[2](#sn2.17note02)

apart from sense-faculty restraint,

apart from relinquishing the all,[3](#sn2.17note03)

I see no safety

for living beings.”

That is what the Blessed One said… the deva disappeared right there.
