## SN35.19 Delight (1)

## ## Abhinanda Sutta

“Monks, whoever delights in the eye delights in stress. Whoever delights in stress is not released from stress, I tell you.

“Whoever delights in the ear delights in stress…

“Whoever delights in the nose delights in stress…

“Whoever delights in the tongue delights in stress…

“Whoever delights in the body delights in stress…

“Monks, whoever delights in the intellect delights in stress. Whoever delights in stress is not released from stress, I tell you.

“Monks, whoever doesn’t delight in the eye doesn’t delight in stress. Whoever doesn’t delight in stress is released from stress, I tell you.

“Whoever doesn’t delight in the ear doesn’t delight in stress…

“Whoever doesn’t delight in the nose doesn’t delight in stress…

“Whoever doesn’t delight in the tongue doesn’t delight in stress…

“Whoever doesn’t delight in the body doesn’t delight in stress…

“Monks, whoever doesn’t delight in the intellect doesn’t delight in stress. Whoever doesn’t delight in stress is released from stress, I tell you.”
