“There is the case where a monk has some work to do. The thought occurs to him: ‘I will have to do this work. But when I have done this work, my body will be tired. Why don’t I lie down?’ So he lies down. He doesn’t make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. This is the first ground for laziness.

Note

1. Reading _lahuko_ with the Thai edition. The Burmese and Sri Lankan editions read _/balavā_, strong. Both readings are tenable, the Thai in the sense that the monk has the good sense not to stuff himself with food even though he has received plenty.
