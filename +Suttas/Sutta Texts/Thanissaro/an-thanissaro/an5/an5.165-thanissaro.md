## AN5.165 On Asking Questions

## ## Pañhapucchā Sutta


Then Ven. Sāriputta addressed the monks: “Friend monks.”

“Yes, friend,” the monks responded to him.

Ven. Sāriputta said: “All those who ask questions of another do so from any one of five motivations. Which five?

“One asks a question of another through stupidity & bewilderment. One asks a question of another through evil desires & overwhelmed with greed. One asks a question of another through contempt. One asks a question of another when desiring knowledge. Or one asks a question with this thought,(#^[].165note01) ‘If, when asked, he answers correctly, well & good. If not, then I will answer correctly (for him).’ ^[].165note01-ref

“All those who ask questions of another do so from any one of these five motivations. And as for me, when I ask a question of another, it’s with this thought: ‘If, when asked, he answers correctly, well & good. If not, then I will answer correctly (for him).’

Note

1. Reading _panevaṁ-citto_ with the Thai edition. The PTS reading—_pakuppanto citto,_ “with a provoked heart”—does not fit the context at all.
