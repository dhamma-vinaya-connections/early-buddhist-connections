## AN3.106 Allure (2)

## ## Assāda Sutta


“Monks, if there were not this allure to the cosmos, beings would not become impassioned with the cosmos. But because there is an allure to the cosmos, beings become impassioned with the cosmos.

“If there were not this drawback to the cosmos, beings would not become disenchanted with the cosmos. But because there is a drawback to the cosmos, beings become disenchanted with the cosmos.

“If there were not this escape from the cosmos, beings would not escape from the cosmos. But because there is an escape from the cosmos, beings escape from the cosmos.

“And, monks, as long as beings don’t know as it has come to be—with regard to the cosmos—the allure as the allure, the drawback as the drawback, and the escape as the escape, they have not escaped from this cosmos with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, this generation with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & common people, nor do they dwell disjoined from it, released from it, with unrestricted awareness.

“But when beings know as it has come to be—with regard to the cosmos—the allure as the allure, the drawback as the drawback, and the escape as the escape, they have escaped from this cosmos with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, this generation with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & common people, and they dwell disjoined from it, released from it, with unrestricted awareness.”
