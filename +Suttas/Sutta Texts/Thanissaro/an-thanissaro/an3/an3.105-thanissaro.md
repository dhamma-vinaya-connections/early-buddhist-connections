## AN3.105 Allure (1)

## ## Assāda Sutta


“Monks, I set out in search of the allure of the cosmos. Whatever allure there is in the cosmos, that I found. However far the allure of the cosmos extends, that I have seen well with discernment.

“I set out in search of the drawback of the cosmos. Whatever drawback there is in the cosmos, that I found. However far the drawback of the cosmos extends, that I have seen well with discernment.

“I set out in search of the escape from the cosmos. Whatever escape there is from the cosmos, that I found. However far the escape from the cosmos extends, that I have seen well with discernment.

“Now, as long as I did not have direct knowledge, as it has come to be, of the allure as the allure, of the drawback as the drawback, and of the escape as the escape with regard to the cosmos, I did not claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right self-awakening in this cosmos with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, in this generation with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & common people. But when I did have direct knowledge (of these things) as they have come to be, then I did claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right self-awakening in this cosmos with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, in this generation with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & common people.

“Knowledge & vision arose in me: ‘Unprovoked is my release. This is the last birth. There is now no further-becoming.’”
