## AN3.116 Immeasurable

## ## Appameyya Sutta


“Monks, these three persons are to be found existing in the world. Which three? One who is easy to measure, one who is hard to measure, & one who is immeasurable.

“And which is the person who is easy to measure? There is the case where a certain person is high-strung, rowdy, unruly, talkative, of loose words & muddled mindfulness, unalert, unconcentrated, his mind scattered, his faculties left wide open. This is called a person who is easy to measure.

“And which is the person who is hard to measure? There is the case where a certain person is not high-strung, not rowdy, not unruly, not talkative, not of loose words—one with mindfulness established, alert, concentrated, his mind gathered into singleness, his faculties restrained. This is called a person who is hard to measure.

“And which is the person who is immeasurable? There is the case where a monk is an arahant, his effluents ended. This is called a person who is immeasurable.

“These, monks, are three persons to be found existing in the world.”
