## AN4.19 Off Course

## ## Agati Sutta


“There are these four ways of going off course. Which four? One goes off course through desire. One goes off course through aversion. One goes off course through delusion. One goes off course through fear. These are the four ways of going off course.”

If you—

through desire,

aversion,

delusion,

fear—

transgress the Dhamma,

your honor wanes,

as in the dark fortnight,

the moon.

“There are these four ways of not going off course. Which four? One doesn’t go off course through desire. One doesn’t go off course through aversion. One doesn’t go off course through delusion. One doesn’t go off course through fear. These are the four ways of not going off course.”

If you don’t—

through desire,

aversion,

delusion,

fear—

transgress the Dhamma,

your honor waxes,

as in the bright fortnight,

the moon.
