## AN4.32 The Bonds of Fellowship

## ## Saṅgaha Sutta


“There are these four grounds for the bonds of fellowship. Which four? Giving, kind words, beneficial help, consistency. These are the four grounds for the bonds of fellowship.”

Giving, kind words, beneficial help,

& consistency in the face of events,

in line with what’s appropriate

in each case, each case.

These bonds of fellowship (function) in the world

like the linchpins in a moving cart.

Now, if these bonds of fellowship were lacking,

a mother would not receive

the honor & respect owed by her child,

nor would a father receive

what his child owes him.

But because the wise show regard

for these bonds of fellowship,

they achieve greatness

and are praised.
