“Then again, the monk has heard much, has retained what he has heard, has stored what he has heard.

He is steadfast, solid in his effort, not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualities. And the fact that he keeps his persistence aroused… not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualities is a quality creating a protector.
