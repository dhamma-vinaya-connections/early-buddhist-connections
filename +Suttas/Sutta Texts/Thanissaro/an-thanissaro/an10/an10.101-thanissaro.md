## ## Samaṇasaññā Sutta


“Monks, three contemplative perceptions, when developed & pursued, bring seven things to completion. Which three?

“‘I have become casteless.

“‘My life is dependent on others.

“‘My behavior should be different (from that of householders).’

“These three contemplative perceptions, when developed & pursued, bring seven things to completion. Which seven?

“One acts & behaves consistently with the virtues.

“One isn’t greedy.

“One is devoid of ill will.

“One is devoid of arrogance.

“One desires training.

“One thinks, ‘They have this purpose,’ with regard to the requisites of life.

“One remains with one’s persistence aroused.

“Monks, these three contemplative perceptions, when developed & pursued, bring these seven things to completion.”
