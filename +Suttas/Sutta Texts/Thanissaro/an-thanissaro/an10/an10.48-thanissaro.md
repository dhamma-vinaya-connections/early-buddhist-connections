## AN10.48 Ten Things

## ## Dasa Dhamma Sutta


“There are these ten things that a person gone forth should reflect on often. Which ten?

“‘I have become casteless’: A person gone forth should often reflect on this.

“‘My life is dependent on others’ …

“‘My behavior should be different (from that of householders)’ …

“‘Can I fault myself with regard to my virtue?’…

“‘Can my observant fellows in the holy life, on close examination, fault me with regard to my virtue?’ …

“‘I will grow different, separate from all that is dear & appealing to me’ …

“‘I am the owner of actions _,_ heir to actions, born of actions, related through actions, and have actions as my arbitrator. Whatever I do, for good or for evil, to that will I fall heir’ …

“‘What am I becoming as the days & nights fly past?’ …

“‘Do I delight in an empty dwelling?’ …

“‘Have I attained a superior human attainment, a truly noble distinction of knowledge & vision, such that—when my companions in the holy life question me in the last days of my life—I won’t feel abashed?’: A person gone forth should often reflect on this.

“These are the ten things that a person gone forth should reflect on often.”
