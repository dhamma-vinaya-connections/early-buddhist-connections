## AN6.38 The Self-doer

## ## Attakārin Sutta


Then a certain brahman went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, “Master Gotama, I hold to the doctrine, hold to the view, that there is no self-doing, there is no other-doing.”

“Brahman, may I not see or hear of such a doctrine, such a view. For how can one—even though he himself is coming forward, he himself is going away—say, ‘There is no self-doing, there is no other-doing’?

 “What do you think, brahman: Does the property of instigation exist?”

“Yes, sir.”

“And when there’s the property of instigation, are beings who are instigating discerned?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Then, when there’s the property of instigation and beings who are instigating are discerned, that is the self-doing of beings, that is (their) other-doing.

 “What do you think, brahman: Does the property of perseverance exist?”

“Yes, sir.”

“And when there’s the property of perseverance, are beings who are persevering discerned?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Then, when there’s the property of perseverance and beings who are persevering are discerned, that is the self-doing of beings, that is (their) other-doing.

 “What do you think, brahman: Does the property of exertion exist?”

“Yes, sir.”

“And when there’s the property of exertion, are beings who are exerting discerned?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Then, when there’s the property of exertion and beings who are exerting are discerned, that is the self-doing of beings, that is (their) other-doing.

“What do you think, brahman: Does the property of firmness exist?”

“Yes, sir.”

“And when there’s the property of firmness, are beings who are standing firm discerned?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Then, when there’s the property of firmness and beings who are standing firm are discerned, that is the self-doing of beings, that is (their) other-doing.

 “What do you think, brahman: Does the property of stability exist?”

“Yes, sir.”

“And when there’s the property of stability, are beings who are maintaining stability discerned?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Then, when there’s the property of stability and beings who are maintaining stability are discerned, that is the self-doing of beings, that is (their) other-doing.

 “What do you think, brahman: Does the property of striving exist?”

“Yes, sir.”

“And when there’s the property of striving, are beings who are striving discerned?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Then, when there’s the property of striving and beings who are striving are discerned, that is the self-doing of beings, that is (their) other-doing.

“Brahman, may I not see or hear of such a doctrine, such a view  yours]. For how can one—even though he himself is coming forward, he himself is going away—say, ‘There is no self-doing, there is no other-doing’?”

“Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, & to the Saṅgha of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life.”
