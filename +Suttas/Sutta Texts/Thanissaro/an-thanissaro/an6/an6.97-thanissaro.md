## AN6.97 Rewards

## ## Ānisaṁsa Sutta


“Monks, there are these six rewards in realizing the fruit of stream-entry. Which six? One is certain of the true Dhamma. One is not subject to falling back. There is no suffering over what has had a limit placed on it.(#^[].97note01) One is endowed with uncommon knowledge.(#^[].97note02) One rightly sees cause, along with causally-originated phenomena. ^[].97note01-ref ^[].97note02-ref

“These are the six rewards in realizing the fruit of Stream-entry.”
