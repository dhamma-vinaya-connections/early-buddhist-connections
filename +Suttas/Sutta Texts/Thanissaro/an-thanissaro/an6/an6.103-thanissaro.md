## AN6.103 Without Exception (2)

## ## Anodhi Sutta


“In seeing six rewards, it’s enough for a monk to establish the perception of stress with regard to all fabrications without exception. Which six? ‘The perception of disenchantment(#^[].103note01) will be established within me with regard to all fabrications, like a murderer with a drawn sword. My mind will rise above every world. I’ll become one who sees peace in unbinding. My obsessions(#^[].103note02) will go to their destruction. I’ll be one who has completed his task. The Teacher will have been served with goodwill.’ ^[].103note01-ref ^[].103note02-ref

“In seeing these six rewards, it’s enough for a monk to establish the perception of stress with regard to all fabrications without exception.”
