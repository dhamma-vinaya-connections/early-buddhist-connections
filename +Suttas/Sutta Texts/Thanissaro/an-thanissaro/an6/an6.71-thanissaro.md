## ## Sakkhibhabba Sutta


“Monks, endowed with six qualities, a monk is incapable of attaining what is to be witnessed right there whenever there is an opening.(#^[].71note01) Which six? ^[].71note01-ref

“There is the case where a monk doesn’t discern as it has come to be that ‘This quality has a share in decline.’ He doesn’t discern as it has come to be that ‘This quality has a share in stability.’ He doesn’t discern as it has come to be that ‘This quality has a share in distinction.’ He doesn’t discern as it has come to be that ‘This quality has a share in penetration.’(#^[].71note02) He is one who doesn’t act attentively. He is one who doesn’t act suitably. ^[].71note02-ref
