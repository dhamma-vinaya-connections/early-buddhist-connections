## AN9.25 Discernment

## ## Paññā Sutta


“Monks, when a monk’s mind is well shored-up by discernment, it is suitable for him to say, ‘Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.’ And how is a monk’s mind well shored-up by discernment?

“‘My mind is devoid of passion’: His mind is well shored-up by discernment.

“‘My mind is devoid of aversion’: His mind is well shored-up by discernment.

“‘My mind is devoid of delusion’: His mind is well shored-up by discernment.

“‘My mind isn’t subject to being impassioned’: His mind is well shored-up by discernment.

“‘My mind isn’t subject to being aversive’: His mind is well shored-up by discernment.

“‘My mind isn’t subject to being deluded’: His mind is well shored-up by discernment.

“‘My mind isn’t subject to returning for the sake of passion for sensuality’:(#^[].25note01) His mind is well shored-up by discernment. ^[].25note01-ref

“‘My mind isn’t subject to returning for the sake of passion for form’: His mind is well shored-up by discernment.

“‘My mind isn’t subject to returning for the sake of passion for the formless’: His mind is well shored-up by discernment.

“Monks, when a monk’s mind is well shored-up by discernment, it is suitable for him to say, ‘Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.’”

Note

1. Reading _kāmarāgāyāti_ with the Thai edition. The other editions read _kāmabhavāyāti,_ “for the sake of sensuality-becoming.” There are similar differences below, with the Thai reading _rūparāgāyāti_ and _arūparāgāyāti_ where the other editions read _rūpabhavāyāti_ and _arūpabhavāyāti._

> **Edition Notice**  
Bhikkhu Thanissaro’s translations are arranged according to the Thai Tipitaka edition. Therefore, some sutta references may not align with the 6th Council or Suttacentral.net numbering schemes, especially in the Saṁyutta Nikāya (SN) and Aṅguttara Nikāya (AN).
