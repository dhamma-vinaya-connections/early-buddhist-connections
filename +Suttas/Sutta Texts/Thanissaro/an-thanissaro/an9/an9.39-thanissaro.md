## AN9.39 The Devas (About Jhāna)

## ## Deva Sutta


“Once, monks, a battle between the devas & asuras was in full swing. And in that battle, the asuras won and the devas lost. Having lost, the devas simply fled while the asuras, heading north, attacked them. Then the thought occurred to the devas, ‘The asuras are still attacking. Why don’t we do battle a second time?’

“So the devas did battle with the asuras a second time. And a second time, the asuras won and the devas lost. Having lost, the devas simply fled while the asuras, heading north, attacked them. Then the thought occurred to the devas, ‘The asuras are still attacking. Why don’t we do battle a third time?’

“So the devas did battle with the asuras a third time. And a third time, the asuras won and the devas lost. Having lost, the devas, afraid, entered the deva capital. Having gone to their capital, the devas thought, ‘Having come to this shelter for the fearful, we will now keep here to ourselves, having nothing to do with the asuras.’ And the asuras also thought, ‘Having gone to this shelter for the fearful, the devas will now keep here to themselves, having nothing to do with us.’

“Once, monks, a battle between the devas & asuras was in full swing. And in that battle, the devas won and the asuras lost.

“In the same way, monks, on whatever occasion a monk—secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities—enters the first jhāna: rapture & pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation, on that occasion the thought occurs to him, ‘Having come to this shelter for the fearful, I will now keep here to myself, having nothing to do with Māra.’ And the thought occurs to Māra, the Evil One, ‘Having gone to this shelter for the fearful, the monk will now keep here to himself, having nothing to do with me.’

 with the second, third, & fourth jhānas.]

“On whatever occasion a monk, with the complete transcending of perceptions of (physical) form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not attending to perceptions of multiplicity, (perceiving,) ‘Infinite space,’ enters the dimension of the infinitude of space: He is said to be a monk who has put Māra in the dark.(#^[].39note01) Having bound Māra’s eyes and leaving no trace, he has become invisible to the Evil One.(#^[].39note02) ^[].39note01-ref ^[].39note02-ref

 with the dimensions of the infinitude of consciousness, nothingness, and neither perception nor non-perception.]

“On whatever occasion, with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, he enters & remains in the cessation of perception & feeling; and as he sees (that) with discernment, effluents are completely ended: He is said to be a monk who has put Māra in the dark. Having bound Māra’s eyes and leaving no trace, he has become invisible to the Evil One, having crossed over attachment in the cosmos.”(#^[].39note03) ^[].39note03-ref
