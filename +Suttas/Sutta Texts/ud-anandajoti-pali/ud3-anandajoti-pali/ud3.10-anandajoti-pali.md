## Khuddaka Nikāya - The Minor Texts

## The Udana - Inspired Utterances of The Buddha

### 30. Udāna 3.10: The Discourse about Looking Around the World

- Translated from the Pali by Ānandajoti Bhikkhu  

1Thus I heard: At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Uruvelā, on the bank of the river Nerañjarā, at the root of the Awakening tree, in the first period after attaining Awakening.

Then at that time the Gracious One was sitting in one cross-legged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of freedom.

2Then with the passing of those seven days the Gracious One, after rising from that concentration, looked around the world with his Buddha-eye. The Gracious One looking around the world with his Buddha-eye saw beings being tormented with many torments, and being burned with many fevers, born from passion, and born from hatred, and born from delusion.

3Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:

---

4"This world, overcome by contact, is tormented,  
It speaks of a disease as the self,  
For with whatever it conceives  
Hereafter it becomes otherwise.

5"Continually becoming other,  
the world is shackled by continuity,  
overcome by continuity,  
it greatly rejoices in continuity,  
What it rejoices in, that is fearful,  
What it fears, that is suffering.  
"This spiritual life is lived for the complete giving up of continuity.

---

6"For whatever the ascetics or brāhmaṇas say about freedom from continuity being through further continuity, all of them are not free from continuity, I say.  
"Or whatever the ascetics or brāhmaṇas say about the escape from continuity being through discontinuity, all of them have not escaped from continuity, I say.

7"Conditioned by cleaving this suffering originates, through the destruction of all attachment there is no origination of suffering.  
  
" See this world overcome by many kinds of ignorance, beings, who delight in beings, are not free from continuity. "Whatever continuities in existence there are, everywhere, in every respect, all those continuities are impermanent, suffering, changeable things.

---

8"Seeing it like this, as it really is,  
with right wisdom,  
Craving for continuity is given up,  
and he does not rejoice in discontinuity.  
"From the complete destruction of craving  
there is a fading away of ignorance without remainder, cessation, and Emancipation.

9"For that monk who is emancipated,  
Without attachment, there is no continuity in existence.  
"He has vanquished Māra, is victorious in battle,  
He is such a one who has overcome all continuations in existence."

4 "Ayaṁ loko santāpajāto,  
Phassapareto rogaṁ vadati attato;  
Yena yena hi maññati,  
Tato taṁ hoti aññathā.

5 Aññathābhāvī bhavasatto loko,  
Bhavapareto bhavamevābhinandati;  
Yadabhinandati taṁ bhayaṁ,

6‘Ye hi keci samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā bhavena bhavassa vippamokkhamāhaṁsu, sabbe te avippamuttā bhavasmā’ti vadāmi.  
  
‘Ye vā pana keci samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā vibhavena bhavassa nissaraṇamāhaṁsu, sabbe te anissaṭā bhavasmā’ti vadāmi.

7Upadhiñhi paṭicca dukkhamidaṁ sambhoti, sabbupādānakkhayā natthi dukkhassa sambhavo.  
  
Lokamimaṁ passa; puthū avijjāya paretā bhūtā bhūtaratā aparimuttā; ye hi keci bhavā sabbadhi sabbatthatāya sabbe te bhavā aniccā dukkhā vipariṇāmadhammāti.

8 Evametaṁ yathābhūtaṁ,  
Sammappaññāya passato;  
Bhavataṇhā pahīyati,  
Vibhavaṁ nābhinandati;  
Sabbaso taṇhānaṁ khayā,  
Asesavirāganirodho nibbānaṁ.

9 Tassa nibbutassa bhikkhuno,  
Anupādā punabbhavo na hoti;  
Abhibhūto māro vijitasaṅgāmo,  
Upaccagā sabbabhavāni tādī"ti.

Dasamaṁ.

Nandavaggo tatiyo.

10Kammaṁ nando yasojo ca,  
sāriputto ca kolito;  
Pilindo kassapo piṇḍo,  
sippaṁ lokena te dasāti.
