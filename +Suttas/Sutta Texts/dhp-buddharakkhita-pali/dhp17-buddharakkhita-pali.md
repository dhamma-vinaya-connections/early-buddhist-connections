## Khuddaka Nikāya - The Minor Texts

## Dhammapada - Chapter 17: Kodhavagga - Anger

- Translated from the Pali by Acharya Buddharakkhita.  
    

221One should give up anger, renounce pride, and overcome all fetters. Suffering never befalls him who clings not to mind and body and is detached.

222He who checks rising anger as a charioteer checks a rolling chariot, him I call a true charioteer. Others only hold the reins.

223Overcome the angry by non-anger; overcome the wicked by goodness; overcome the miser by generosity; overcome the liar by truth.

224Speak the truth; yield not to anger; when asked, give even if you only have a little. By these three means can one reach the presence of the gods.

225Those sages who are inoffensive and ever restrained in body, go to the Deathless State, where, having gone, they grieve no more.

226Those who are ever vigilant, who discipline themselves day and night, and are ever intent upon Nibbāna — their defilements fade away.

227O Atula! Indeed, this is an ancient practice, not one only of today: they blame those who remain silent, they blame those who speak much, they blame those who speak in moderation. There is none in the world who is not blamed.

228There never was, there never will be, nor is there now, a person who is wholly blamed or wholly praised.

229But the man whom the wise praise, after observing him day after day, is one of flawless character, wise, and endowed with knowledge and virtue.

230Who can blame such a one, as worthy as a coin of refined gold? Even the gods praise him; by Brahma, too, is he praised.

231Let a man guard himself against irritability in bodily action; let him be controlled in deed. Abandoning bodily misconduct, let him practice good conduct in deed.

232Let a man guard himself against irritability in speech; let him be controlled in speech. Abandoning verbal misconduct, let him practice good conduct in speech.

233Let a man guard himself against irritability in thought; let him be controlled in mind. Abandoning mental misconduct, let him practice good conduct in thought.

234The wise are controlled in bodily action, controlled in speech and controlled in thought. They are truly well-controlled.

221Kodhaṁ jahe vippajaheyya mānaṁ,  
Saṁyojanaṁ sabbamatikkameyya;  
Taṁ nāmarūpasmimasajjamānaṁ,  
Akiñcanaṁ nānupatanti dukkhā.

222Yo ve uppatitaṁ kodhaṁ,  
rathaṁ bhantaṁva vāraye;  
Tamahaṁ sārathiṁ brūmi,  
rasmiggāho itaro jano.

223Akkodhena jine kodhaṁ,  
asādhuṁ sādhunā jine;  
Jine kadariyaṁ dānena,  
saccenālikavādinaṁ.

224Saccaṁ bhaṇe na kujjheyya,  
dajjā appampi yācito;  
Etehi tīhi ṭhānehi,  
gacche devāna santike.

225Ahiṁsakā ye munayo,  
niccaṁ kāyena saṁvutā;  
Te yanti accutaṁ ṭhānaṁ,  
yattha gantvā na socare.

226Sadā jāgaramānānaṁ,  
ahorattānusikkhinaṁ;  
Nibbānaṁ adhimuttānaṁ,  
atthaṁ gacchanti āsavā.

227Porāṇametaṁ atula,  
netaṁ ajjatanāmiva;  
Nindanti tuṇhimāsīnaṁ,  
nindanti bahubhāṇinaṁ;  
Mitabhāṇimpi nindanti,  
natthi loke anindito.

228Na cāhu na ca bhavissati,  
na cetarahi vijjati;  
Ekantaṁ nindito poso,  
ekantaṁ vā pasaṁsito.

229Yañce viññū pasaṁsanti,  
anuvicca suve suve;  
Acchiddavuttiṁ medhāviṁ,  
paññāsīlasamāhitaṁ.

230Nikkhaṁ jambonadasseva,  
ko taṁ ninditumarahati;  
Devāpi naṁ pasaṁsanti,  
brahmunāpi pasaṁsito.

231Kāyappakopaṁ rakkheyya,  
kāyena saṁvuto siyā;  
Kāyaduccaritaṁ hitvā,  
kāyena sucaritaṁ care.

232Vacīpakopaṁ rakkheyya,  
vācāya saṁvuto siyā;  
Vacīduccaritaṁ hitvā,  
vācāya sucaritaṁ care.

233Manopakopaṁ rakkheyya,  
manasā saṁvuto siyā;  
Manoduccaritaṁ hitvā,  
manasā sucaritaṁ care.

234Kāyena saṁvutā dhīrā,  
atho vācāya saṁvutā;  
Manasā saṁvutā dhīrā,  
te ve suparisaṁvutā.

Kodhavaggo sattarasamo.
