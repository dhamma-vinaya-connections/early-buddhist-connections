## Khuddaka Nikāya - The Minor Texts

## Dhammapada - Chapter 5: Balavagga - The Fool

- Translated from the Pali by Acharya Buddharakkhita.  
    

60Long is the night to the sleepless; long is the league to the weary. Long is worldly existence to fools who know not the Sublime Truth.

61Should a seeker not find a companion who is better or equal, let him resolutely pursue a solitary course; there is no fellowship with the fool.

62The fool worries, thinking, "I have sons, I have wealth." Indeed, when he himself is not his own, whence are sons, whence is wealth?

63A fool who knows his foolishness is wise at least to that extent, but a fool who thinks himself wise is a fool indeed.

64Though all his life a fool associates with a wise man, he no more comprehends the Truth than a spoon tastes the flavor of the soup.

65Though only for a moment a discerning person associates with a wise man, quickly he comprehends the Truth, just as the tongue tastes the flavor of the soup.

66Fools of little wit are enemies unto themselves as they move about doing evil deeds, the fruits of which are bitter.

67Ill done is that action of doing which one repents later, and the fruit of which one, weeping, reaps with tears.

68Well done is that action of doing which one repents not later, and the fruit of which one reaps with delight and happiness.

69So long as an evil deed has not ripened, the fool thinks it as sweet as honey. But when the evil deed ripens, the fool comes to grief.

70Month after month a fool may eat his food with the tip of a blade of grass, but he still is not worth a sixteenth part of the those who have comprehended the Truth.

71Truly, an evil deed committed does not immediately bear fruit, like milk that does not turn sour all at once. But smoldering, it follows the fool like fire covered by ashes.

72To his own ruin the fool gains knowledge, for it cleaves his head and destroys his innate goodness.

73The fool seeks undeserved reputation, precedence among monks, authority over monasteries, and honor among householders.

74"Let both laymen and monks think that it was done by me. In every work, great and small, let them follow me"—such is the ambition of the fool; thus his desire and pride increase.

75One is the quest for worldly gain, and quite another is the path to Nibbāna. Clearly understanding this, let not the monk, the disciple of the Buddha, be carried away by worldly acclaim, but develop detachment instead.

60Dīghā jāgarato ratti,  
dīghaṁ santassa yojanaṁ;  
Dīgho bālāna saṁsāro,  
saddhammaṁ avijānataṁ.

61Carañce nādhigaccheyya,  
Seyyaṁ sadisamattano;  
Ekacariyaṁ daḷhaṁ kayirā,  
Natthi bāle sahāyatā.

62Puttā matthi dhanaṁ matthi,  
iti bālo vihaññati;  
Attā hi attano natthi,  
kuto puttā kuto dhanaṁ.

63Yo bālo maññati bālyaṁ,  
paṇḍito vāpi tena so;  
Bālo ca paṇḍitamānī,  
sa ve "bālo"ti vuccati.

64Yāvajīvampi ce bālo,  
paṇḍitaṁ payirupāsati;  
Na so dhammaṁ vijānāti,  
dabbī sūparasaṁ yathā.

65Muhuttamapi ce viññū,  
paṇḍitaṁ payirupāsati;  
Khippaṁ dhammaṁ vijānāti,  
jivhā sūparasaṁ yathā.

66Caranti bālā dummedhā,  
amitteneva attanā;  
Karontā pāpakaṁ kammaṁ,  
yaṁ hoti kaṭukapphalaṁ.

67Na taṁ kammaṁ kataṁ sādhu,  
yaṁ katvā anutappati;  
Yassa assumukho rodaṁ,  
vipākaṁ paṭisevati.

68Tañca kammaṁ kataṁ sādhu,  
yaṁ katvā nānutappati;  
Yassa patīto sumano,  
vipākaṁ paṭisevati.

69Madhuṁvā maññati bālo,  
yāva pāpaṁ na paccati;  
Yadā ca paccati pāpaṁ,  
atha dukkhaṁ nigacchati.

70Māse māse kusaggena,  
bālo bhuñjeyya bhojanaṁ;  
Na so saṅkhātadhammānaṁ,  
kalaṁ agghati soḷasiṁ.

71Na hi pāpaṁ kataṁ kammaṁ,  
Sajjukhīraṁva muccati;  
Ḍahantaṁ bālamanveti,  
Bhasmacchannova pāvako.

72Yāvadeva anatthāya,  
ñattaṁ bālassa jāyati;  
Hanti bālassa sukkaṁsaṁ,  
muddhamassa vipātayaṁ.

73Asantaṁ bhāvanamiccheyya,  
Purekkhārañca bhikkhusu;  
Āvāsesu ca issariyaṁ,  
Pūjaṁ parakulesu ca.

74Mameva kata maññantu,  
gihī pabbajitā ubho;  
Mamevātivasā assu,  
kiccākiccesu kismici;  
Iti bālassa saṅkappo,  
icchā māno ca vaḍḍhati.

75Aññā hi lābhūpanisā,  
aññā nibbānagāminī;  
Evametaṁ abhiññāya,  
bhikkhu buddhassa sāvako;  
Sakkāraṁ nābhinandeyya,  
vivekamanubrūhaye.

Bālavaggo pañcamo.
