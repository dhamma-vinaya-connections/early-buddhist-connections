## Khuddaka Nikāya - The Minor Texts

## Dhammapada - Chapter 9: Papavagga - Evil

- Translated from the Pali by Acharya Buddharakkhita.  
    

116Hasten to do good; restrain your mind from evil. He who is slow in doing good, his mind delights in evil.

117Should a person commit evil, let him not do it again and again. Let him not find pleasure therein, for painful is the accumulation of evil.

118Should a person do good, let him do it again and again. Let him find pleasure therein, for blissful is the accumulation of good.

119It may be well with the evil-doer as long as the evil ripens not. But when it does ripen, then the evil-doer sees (the painful results of) his evil deeds.

120It may be ill with the doer of good as long as the good ripens not. But when it does ripen, then the doer of good sees (the pleasant results of) his good deeds.

121Think not lightly of evil, saying, "It will not come to me." Drop by drop is the water pot filled. Likewise, the fool, gathering it little by little, fills himself with evil.

122Think not lightly of good, saying, "It will not come to me." Drop by drop is the water pot filled. Likewise, the wise man, gathering it little by little, fills himself with good.

123Just as a trader with a small escort and great wealth would avoid a perilous route, or just as one desiring to live avoids poison, even so should one shun evil.

124If on the hand there is no wound, one may carry even poison in it. Poison does not affect one who is free from wounds. For him who does no evil, there is no ill.

125Like fine dust thrown against the wind, evil falls back upon that fool who offends an inoffensive, pure and guiltless man.

126Some are born in the womb; the wicked are born in hell; the devout go to heaven; the stainless pass into Nibbāna.

127Neither in the sky nor in mid-ocean, nor by entering into mountain clefts, nowhere in the world is there a place where one may escape from the results of evil deeds.

128Neither in the sky nor in mid-ocean, nor by entering into mountain clefts, nowhere in the world is there a place where one will not be overcome by death.

116Abhittharetha kalyāṇe,  
pāpā cittaṁ nivāraye;  
Dandhañhi karoto puññaṁ,  
pāpasmiṁ ramatī mano.

117Pāpañce puriso kayirā,  
Na naṁ kayirā punappunaṁ;  
Na tamhi chandaṁ kayirātha,  
Dukkho pāpassa uccayo.

118Puññañce puriso kayirā,  
kayirā naṁ punappunaṁ;  
Tamhi chandaṁ kayirātha,  
sukho puññassa uccayo.

119Pāpopi passati bhadraṁ,  
Yāva pāpaṁ na paccati;  
Yadā ca paccati pāpaṁ,  
Atha pāpo pāpāni passati.

120Bhadropi passati pāpaṁ,  
Yāva bhadraṁ na paccati;  
Yadā ca paccati bhadraṁ,  
Atha bhadro bhadrāni passati.

121Māvamaññetha pāpassa,  
na mantaṁ āgamissati;  
Udabindunipātena,  
udakumbhopi pūrati;  
Bālo pūrati pāpassa,  
thokaṁ thokampi ācinaṁ.

122Māvamaññetha puññassa,  
na mandaṁ āgamissati;  
Udabindunipātena,  
udakumbhopi pūrati;  
Dhīro pūrati puññassa,  
thokaṁ thokampi ācinaṁ.

123Vāṇijova bhayaṁ maggaṁ,  
appasattho mahaddhano;  
Visaṁ jīvitukāmova,  
pāpāni parivajjaye.

124Pāṇimhi ce vaṇo nāssa,  
hareyya pāṇinā visaṁ;  
Nābbaṇaṁ visamanveti,  
natthi pāpaṁ akubbato.

125Yo appaduṭṭhassa narassa dussati,  
Suddhassa posassa anaṅgaṇassa;  
Tameva bālaṁ pacceti pāpaṁ,  
Sukhumo rajo paṭivātaṁva khitto.

126Gabbhameke uppajjanti,  
nirayaṁ pāpakammino;  
Saggaṁ sugatino yanti,  
parinibbanti anāsavā.

127Na antalikkhe na samuddamajjhe,  
Na pabbatānaṁ vivaraṁ pavissa;  
Na vijjatī so jagatippadeso,  
Yatthaṭṭhito mucceyya pāpakammā.

128Na antalikkhe na samuddamajjhe,  
Na pabbatānaṁ vivaraṁ pavissa;  
Na vijjatī so jagatippadeso,  
Yatthaṭṭhitaṁ nappasaheyya maccu.

Pāpavaggo navamo.
