## Khuddaka Nikāya - The Minor Texts

## Dhammapada - Chapter 1: Yamakavagga - Pairs

- Translated from the Pali by Acharya Buddharakkhita.  
    

1Mind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought. If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts suffering follows him like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox

2Mind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought. If with a pure mind a person speaks or acts happiness follows him like his never-departing shadow

3"He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me." Those who harbor such thoughts do not still their hatred

4"He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me." Those who do not harbor such thoughts still their hatred

5Hatred is never appeased by hatred in this world. By non-hatred alone is hatred appeased. This is a law eternal

6There are those who do not realize that one day we all must die. But those who do realize this settle their quarrels

7Just as a storm throws down a weak tree, so does Māra overpower the man who lives for the pursuit of pleasures, who is uncontrolled in his senses, immoderate in eating, indolent, and dissipated

8Just as a storm cannot prevail against a rocky mountain, so Māra can never overpower the man who lives meditating on the impurities, who is controlled in his senses, moderate in eating, and filled with faith and earnest effort

9Whoever being depraved, devoid of self-control and truthfulness, should don the monk's yellow robe, he surely is not worthy of the robe

10But whoever is purged of depravity, well-established in virtues and filled with self-control and truthfulness, he indeed is worthy of the yellow robe.

11Those who mistake the unessential to be essential and the essential to be unessential, dwelling in wrong thoughts, never arrive at the essential.

12Those who know the essential to be essential and the unessential to be unessential, dwelling in right thoughts, do arrive at the essential.

13Just as rain breaks through an ill-thatched house, so passion penetrates an undeveloped mind.

14Just as rain does not break through a well-thatched house, so passion never penetrates a well-developed mind.

15The evil-doer grieves here and hereafter; he grieves in both the worlds. He laments and is afflicted, recollecting his own impure deeds.

16The doer of good rejoices here and hereafter; he rejoices in both the worlds. He rejoices and exults, recollecting his own pure deeds.

17The evil-doer suffers here and hereafter; he suffers in both the worlds. The thought, "Evil have I done," torments him, and he suffers even more when gone to realms of woe.

18The doer of good delights here and hereafter; he delights in both the worlds. The thought, "Good have I done," delights him, and he delights even more when gone to realms of bliss.

19Much though he recites the sacred texts, but acts not accordingly, that heedless man is like a cowherd who only counts the cows of others—he does not partake of the blessings of the holy life.

20Little though he recites the sacred texts, but puts the Teaching into practice, forsaking lust, hatred, and delusion, with true wisdom and emancipated mind, clinging to nothing of this or any other world—he indeed partakes of the blessings of a holy life.

1Manopubbaṅgamā dhammā, 
manoseṭṭhā manomayā;  
Manasā ce paduṭṭhena,  
bhāsati vā karoti vā;  
Tato naṁ dukkhamanveti,  
cakkaṁva vahato padaṁ.

2Manopubbaṅgamā dhammā, 
manoseṭṭhā manomayā;  
Manasā ce pasannena,  
bhāsati vā karoti vā;  
Tato naṁ sukhamanveti,  
chāyāva anapāyinī.

3Akkocchi maṁ avadhi maṁ,  
ajini maṁ ahāsi me;  
Ye ca taṁ upanayhanti,  
veraṁ tesaṁ na sammati.

4Akkocchi maṁ avadhi maṁ,  
ajini maṁ ahāsi me;  
Ye ca taṁ nupanayhanti,  
veraṁ tesūpasammati.

5Na hi verena verāni,  
sammantīdha kudācanaṁ;  
Averena ca sammanti,  
esa dhammo sanantano.

6Pare ca na vijānanti,  
mayamettha yamāmase;  
Ye ca tattha vijānanti,  
tato sammanti medhagā.

7Subhānupassiṁ viharantaṁ,  
indriyesu asaṁvutaṁ;  
Bhojanamhi cāmattaññuṁ,  
kusītaṁ hīnavīriyaṁ;  
Taṁ ve pasahati māro,  
vāto rukkhaṁva dubbalaṁ.

8Asubhānupassiṁ viharantaṁ,  
Indriyesu susaṁvutaṁ;  
Bhojanamhi ca mattaññuṁ,  
Saddhaṁ āraddhavīriyaṁ;  
Taṁ ve nappasahati māro,  
Vāto selaṁva pabbataṁ.

9Anikkasāvo kāsāvaṁ,  
yo vatthaṁ paridahissati;  
Apeto damasaccena,  
na so kāsāvamarahati.

10Yo ca vantakasāvassa,  
sīlesu susamāhito;  
Upeto damasaccena,  
sa ve kāsāvamarahati.

11Asāre sāramatino,  
sāre cāsāradassino;  
Te sāraṁ nādhigacchanti,  
micchāsaṅkappagocarā.

12Sārañca sārato ñatvā,  
asārañca asārato;  
Te sāraṁ adhigacchanti,  
sammāsaṅkappagocarā.

13Yathā agāraṁ ducchannaṁ,  
vuṭṭhī samativijjhati;  
Evaṁ abhāvitaṁ cittaṁ,  
rāgo samativijjhati.

14Yathā agāraṁ suchannaṁ,  
vuṭṭhī na samativijjhati;  
Evaṁ subhāvitaṁ cittaṁ,  
rāgo na samativijjhati.

15Idha socati pecca socati,  
Pāpakārī ubhayattha socati;  
So socati so vihaññati,  
Disvā kammakiliṭṭhamattano.

16Idha modati pecca modati,  
Katapuñño ubhayattha modati;  
So modati so pamodati,  
Disvā kammavisuddhimattano.

17Idha tappati pecca tappati,  
Pāpakārī ubhayattha tappati;  
" Pāpaṁ me katan"ti tappati,  
Bhiyyo tappati duggatiṁ gato.

18Idha nandati pecca nandati,  
Katapuñño ubhayattha nandati;  
" Puññaṁ me katan"ti nandati,  
Bhiyyo nandati suggatiṁ gato.

19Bahumpi ce saṁhita bhāsamāno,  
Na takkaro hoti naro pamatto;  
Gopova gāvo gaṇayaṁ paresaṁ,  
Na bhāgavā sāmaññassa hoti.

20Appampi ce saṁhita bhāsamāno,  
Dhammassa hoti anudhammacārī;  
Rāgañca dosañca pahāya mohaṁ,  
Sammappajāno suvimuttacitto;  
Anupādiyāno idha vā huraṁ vā,  
Sa bhāgavā sāmaññassa hoti.

Yamakavaggo paṭhamo.
