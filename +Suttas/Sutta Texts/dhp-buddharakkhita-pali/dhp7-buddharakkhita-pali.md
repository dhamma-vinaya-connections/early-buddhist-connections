## Khuddaka Nikāya - The Minor Texts

## Dhammapada - Chapter 7: Arahantavagga - The Arahant or Perfected One

- Translated from the Pali by Acharya Buddharakkhita.  
    

90The fever of passion exists not for him who has completed the journey, who is sorrowless and wholly set free, and has broken all ties.

91The mindful ones exert themselves. They are not attached to any home; like swans that abandon the lake, they leave home after home behind.

92Those who do not accumulate and are wise regarding food, whose object is the Void, the Unconditioned Freedom — their track cannot be traced, like that of birds in the air.

93He whose cankers are destroyed and who is not attached to food, whose object is the Void, the Unconditioned Freedom — his path cannot be traced, like that of birds in the air.

94Even the gods hold dear the wise one, whose senses are subdued like horses well trained by a charioteer, whose pride is destroyed and who is free from the cankers.

95There is no more worldly existence for the wise one who, like the earth, resents nothing, who is firm as a high pillar and as pure as a deep pool free from mud.

96Calm is his thought, calm his speech, and calm his deed, who, truly knowing, is wholly freed, perfectly tranquil and wise.

97The man who is without blind faith, who knows the Uncreated, who has severed all links, destroyed all causes (for karma, good and evil), and thrown out all desires — he, truly, is the most excellent of men.

98Inspiring, indeed, is that place where Arahants dwell, be it a village, a forest, a vale, or a hill.

99Inspiring are the forests in which worldlings find no pleasure. There the passionless will rejoice, for they seek no sensual pleasures.

90Gataddhino visokassa,  
vippamuttassa sabbadhi;  
Sabbaganthappahīnassa,  
pariḷāho na vijjati.

91Uyyuñjanti satīmanto,  
na nikete ramanti te;  
Haṁsāva pallalaṁ hitvā,  
okamokaṁ jahanti te.

92Yesaṁ sannicayo natthi,  
ye pariññātabhojanā;  
Suññato animitto ca,  
vimokkho yesaṁ gocaro;  
Ākāseva sakuntānaṁ,  
gati tesaṁ durannayā.

93Yassāsavā parikkhīṇā,  
āhāre ca anissito;  
Suññato animitto ca,  
vimokkho yassa gocaro;  
Ākāseva sakuntānaṁ,  
padaṁ tassa durannayaṁ.

94Yassindriyāni samathaṅgatāni,  
Assā yathā sārathinā sudantā;  
Pahīnamānassa anāsavassa,  
Devāpi tassa pihayanti tādino.

95Pathavisamo no virujjhati,  
Indakhilupamo tādi subbato;  
Rahadova apetakaddamo,  
Saṁsārā na bhavanti tādino.

96Santaṁ tassa manaṁ hoti,  
santā vācā ca kamma ca;  
Sammadaññāvimuttassa,  
upasantassa tādino.

97Assaddho akataññū ca,  
sandhicchedo ca yo naro;  
Hatāvakāso vantāso,  
sa ve uttamaporiso.

98Gāme vā yadi vāraññe,  
Ninne vā yadi vā thale;  
Yattha arahanto viharanti,  
Taṁ bhūmirāmaṇeyyakaṁ.

99Ramaṇīyāni araññāni,  
yattha na ramatī jano;  
Vītarāgā ramissanti,  
na te kāmagavesino.

Arahantavaggo sattamo.
