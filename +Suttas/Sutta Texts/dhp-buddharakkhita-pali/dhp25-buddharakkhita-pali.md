## Khuddaka Nikāya - The Minor Texts

## Dhammapada - Chapter 25: Bhikkhuvagga - The Monk

- Translated from the Pali by Acharya Buddharakkhita.  
    

360Good is restraint over the eye; good is restraint over the ear; good is restraint over the nose; good is restraint over the tongue.

361Good is restraint in the body; good is restraint in speech; good is restraint in thought. Restraint everywhere is good. The monk restrained in every way is freed from all suffering.

362He who has control over his hands, feet and tongue; who is fully controlled, delights in inward development, is absorbed in meditation, keeps to himself and is contented—him do people call a monk.

363That monk who has control over his tongue, is moderate in speech, unassuming and who explains the Teaching in both letter and spirit—whatever he says is pleasing.

364The monk who abides in the Dhamma, delights in the Dhamma, meditates on the Dhamma, and bears the Dhamma well in mind—he does not fall away from the sublime Dhamma.

365One should not despise what one has received, nor envy the gains of others. The monk who envies the gains of others does not attain to meditative absorption.

366A monk who does not despise what he has received, even though it be little, who is pure in livelihood and unremitting in effort—him even the gods praise.

367He who has no attachment whatsoever for the mind and body, who does not grieve for what he has not—he is truly called a monk.

368The monk who abides in universal love and is deeply devoted to the Teaching of the Buddha attains the peace of Nibbāna, the bliss of the cessation of all conditioned things.

369Empty this boat, O monk! Emptied, it will sail lightly. Rid of lust and hatred, you shall reach Nibbāna.

370Cut off the five, abandon the five, and cultivate the five. The monk who has overcome the five bonds is called one who has crossed the flood.

371Meditate, O monk! Do not be heedless. Let not your mind whirl on sensual pleasures. Heedless, do not swallow a red-hot iron ball, lest you cry when burning, "O this is painful!"

372There is no meditative concentration for him who lacks insight, and no insight for him who lacks meditative concentration. He in whom are found both meditative concentration and insight, indeed, is close to Nibbāna.

373The monk who has retired to a solitary abode and calmed his mind, who comprehends the Dhamma with insight, in him there arises a delight that transcends all human delights.

---

374Whenever he sees with insight the rise and fall of the aggregates, he is full of joy and happiness. To the discerning one this reflects the Deathless.

375Control of the senses, contentment, restraint according to the code of monastic discipline—these form the basis of holy life here for the wise monk.

376Let him associate with friends who are noble, energetic, and pure in life, let him be cordial and refined in conduct. Thus, full of joy, he will make an end of suffering.

377Just as the jasmine creeper sheds its withered flowers, even so, O monks, should you totally shed lust and hatred!

378The monk who is calm in body, calm in speech, calm in thought, well-composed and who has spewn out worldliness—he, truly, is called serene.

379By oneself one must censure oneself and scrutinize oneself. The self-guarded and mindful monk will always live in happiness.

380One is one's own protector, one is one's own refuge. Therefore, one should control oneself, even as a trader controls a noble steed.

381Full of joy, full of faith in the Teaching of the Buddha, the monk attains the Peaceful State, the bliss of cessation of conditioned things.

382That monk who while young devotes himself to the Teaching of the Buddha illumines this world like the moon freed from clouds.

360Cakkhunā saṁvaro sādhu,  
sādhu sotena saṁvaro;  
Ghānena saṁvaro sādhu,  
sādhu jivhāya saṁvaro.

361Kāyena saṁvaro sādhu,  
sādhu vācāya saṁvaro;  
Manasā saṁvaro sādhu,

Sabbattha saṁvuto bhikkhu,  
sabbadukkhā pamuccati.

362Hatthasaṁyato pādasaṁyato,  
Vācāsaṁyato saṁyatuttamo;  
Ajjhattarato samāhito,  
Eko santusito tamāhu bhikkhuṁ.

363Yo mukhasaṁyato bhikkhu,

364Dhammārāmo dhammarato,

Dhammaṁ anussaraṁ bhikkhu,

365Salābhaṁ nātimaññeyya,  
nāññesaṁ pihayaṁ care;  
Aññesaṁ pihayaṁ bhikkhu,  
samādhiṁ nādhigacchati.

366Appalābhopi ce bhikkhu,

Taṁ ve devā pasaṁsanti,

367Sabbaso nāmarūpasmiṁ,

368Mettāvihārī yo bhikkhu,  
pasanno buddhasāsane;  
Adhigacche padaṁ santaṁ,  
saṅkhārūpasamaṁ sukhaṁ.

369Siñca bhikkhu imaṁ nāvaṁ,  
sittā te lahumessati;  
Chetvā rāgañca dosañca,  
tato nibbānamehisi.

370Pañca chinde pañca jahe,  
pañca cuttari bhāvaye;  
Pañca saṅgātigo bhikkhu,  
"oghatiṇṇo"ti vuccati.

371Jhāya bhikkhu mā pamādo,  
Mā te kāmaguṇe ramessu cittaṁ;  
Mā lohaguḷaṁ gilī pamatto,  
Mā kandi "dukkhamidan"ti dayhamāno.

372Natthi jhānaṁ apaññassa,  
paññā natthi ajhāyato;  
Yamhi jhānañca paññā ca,  
sa ve nibbānasantike.

373Suññāgāraṁ paviṭṭhassa,  
santacittassa bhikkhuno;  
Amānusī rati hoti,  
sammā dhammaṁ vipassato.

374Yato yato sammasati,  
khandhānaṁ udayabbayaṁ;  
Labhatī pītipāmojjaṁ,  
amataṁ taṁ vijānataṁ.

375Tatrāyamādi bhavati,  
idha paññassa bhikkhuno;  
Indriyagutti santuṭṭhi,  
pātimokkhe ca saṁvaro.

376Mitte bhajassu kalyāṇe,  
suddhājīve atandite;  
Paṭisanthāravutyassa,  
ācārakusalo siyā;  
Tato pāmojjabahulo,  
dukkhassantaṁ karissati.

377Vassikā viya pupphāni,  
maddavāni pamuñcati;  
Evaṁ rāgañca dosañca,  
vippamuñcetha bhikkhavo.

378Santakāyo santavāco,  
santavā susamāhito;  
Vantalokāmiso bhikkhu,  
"upasanto"ti vuccati.

379Attanā codayattānaṁ,  
paṭimaṁsetha attanā;  
So attagutto satimā,  
sukhaṁ bhikkhu vihāhisi.

380Attā hi attano nātho,  
ko hi nātho paro siyā;  
Attā hi attano gati,  
tasmā saṁyamamattānaṁ;  
Assaṁ bhadraṁva vāṇijo.

381Pāmojjabahulo bhikkhu,  
pasanno buddhasāsane;  
Adhigacche padaṁ santaṁ,  
saṅkhārūpasamaṁ sukhaṁ.

382Yo have daharo bhikkhu,  
yuñjati buddhasāsane;  
Somaṁ lokaṁ pabhāseti,  
abbhā muttova candimā.

Bhikkhuvaggo pañcavīsatimo.
