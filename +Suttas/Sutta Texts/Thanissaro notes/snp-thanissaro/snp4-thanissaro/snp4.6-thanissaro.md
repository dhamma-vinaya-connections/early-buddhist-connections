# 4:6  Old Age

How short this life!

You die this side of a century,

but even if you live past,

you die of old age.

People grieve

for what they see as _mine,_

for          nothing possessed is constant,

nothing is constantly possessed.[1](#^snp4-6-01) ^snp4-6-01-ref

Seeing this separation

simply as it is,

one shouldn’t follow the household life.

At death a person abandons

what he supposes as _mine._

Realizing this, the wise

shouldn’t incline

to be devoted to _mine-ness._

Just as a man doesn’t see

on awakening

what he met in a dream,

even so he doesn’t see,

when they are dead

—their time done—

those he held dear.

When they are seen & heard,

people are called by this name or that,

but only the name remains

to be pointed to

when they are dead.

Grief, lamentation, & selfishness

are not let go

by those greedy for _mine,_

so sages

letting go of possessions,

go about

seeing the Secure.

A monk, living withdrawn,

enjoying a dwelling secluded:

They say it’s congenial for him,

he who wouldn’t, in any realm,

display self.

Everywhere

the sage

independent

makes nothing dear or undear.

In him

lamentation & selfishness,

like water on a white lotus,

do not adhere.

As a water bead on a lotus leaf,

as water on a red lily,

doesn’t adhere,

so the sage

doesn’t adhere

to the seen, the heard, or the sensed;

for, cleansed,

he doesn’t suppose

in connection

with the seen, the heard, or the sensed.

In no other way

does he wish for purity,

for he neither takes on passion

nor puts it away.[2](#^snp4-6-02) ^snp4-6-02-ref

vv. 804–813

### Notes

1. “Nothing possessed is constant, nothing is constantly possessed”—two readings of the phrase, _na hi santi niccā pariggahā._ [↩︎](#^snp4-6-01-ref) ^snp4-6-01

2. Nd I: An arahant has put passion totally away once and for all, and so has no need to do it ever again. [↩︎](#^snp4-6-02-ref) ^snp4-6-02
