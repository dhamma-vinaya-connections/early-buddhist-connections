# 4:11  Quarrels & Disputes

“From where have there arisen

quarrels, disputes,

lamentation, sorrows, along with stinginess,

conceit & pride, along with divisiveness?

From where have they arisen?

Please tell me.”

“From what is dear

there have arisen

quarrels, disputes,

lamentation, sorrows, along with stinginess,

conceit & pride, along with divisiveness.

Tied up with stinginess

are quarrels & disputes.

In the arising of disputes

is divisiveness.”

“Where is the cause

of things dear in the world,

along with the greeds that go about in the world?

And where is the cause

of the hopes & aims

for the sake of a person’s next life?”

“Desires are the cause

of things dear in the world,

along with the greeds that go about in the world.

And here too is the cause

of the hopes & aims

for the sake of a person’s next life.”

“Now where is the cause

of desire in the world?

And from where have there arisen

decisions, anger, lies, & perplexity,

and all the qualities

described by the Contemplative?”

“What they call

‘appealing’ &

‘unappealing’

in the world:

In dependence on that,

desire arises.

Having seen becoming & not-

with regard to forms,

a person gives rise to decisions in the world;

anger, lies, & perplexity:

these qualities, too,

when there exists

that very pair.

A person perplexed

should train for the path of knowledge,

for it’s in having known

that the Contemplative has spoken

of qualities/dhammas.”[1](#^snp4-11-01) ^snp4-11-01-ref

“Where is the cause

of appealing & un-?

When what isn’t

do they not exist?

And whatever is meant

by becoming & not- :

Tell me,

Where is their cause?”

“Contact is the cause

of appealing & un-.

When contact isn’t,

they do not exist,

along with what’s meant

by becoming & not- :

I tell you,

from here is their cause.”

“Now where is the cause

of contact in the world,

and from where have graspings,

possessions, arisen?

When what isn’t

does there not exist _mine-ness?_

When what has disappeared

do contacts not touch?”

“Conditioned by name-&-form

is contact.

In longing do graspings,

possessions have their cause.

When longing isn’t,

_mine-ness_ doesn’t exist.

When forms have disappeared

contacts don’t touch.”

“For one how-arriving

does form disappear?

How do pleasure & pain disappear?

Tell me this.

My heart is set

on knowing how

they disappear.”

“One not percipient of perceptions

not percipient of aberrant perceptions,

not unpercipient,

nor percipient of what’s disappeared[2](#^snp4-11-02): ^snp4-11-02-ref

For one thus-arriving,

form disappears[3](#^snp4-11-03)— ^snp4-11-03-ref

for objectification-classifications[4](#^snp4-11-04) ^snp4-11-04-ref

have their cause in perception.”

“What we have asked,

you’ve expounded to us.

We ask one thing more.

Please tell it.

Do some of the wise

say that just this much is the utmost,

that purity of spirit[5](#^snp4-11-05) is here? ^snp4-11-05-ref

Or do they say

that it’s other than this?”

“Some of the wise

say that just this much is the utmost,

that purity of spirit is here.

But some of them,

who say they are skilled,

say it’s the moment

with no clinging remaining.

But knowing,

‘Having known, they still are dependent,’[6](#^snp4-11-06) ^snp4-11-06-ref

the sage ponders dependencies.

On knowing them, released,

he doesn’t get into disputes,

doesn’t meet with becoming & not-

: He’s enlightened.”

vv. 862–877

### Notes

1. As other passages in this poem indicate (see note 6, below), the goal is not measured in terms of knowledge, but as this passage points out, knowledge is a necessary part of the path to the goal. [↩︎](#^snp4-11-01-ref) ^snp4-11-01

2. According to Nd I, “percipient of perceptions” means having ordinary perceptions. “Percipient of aberrant perceptions” means being insane. “Unpercipient” means either having entered the cessation of perception and feeling (see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an9/an9.33-thanissaro]]) or the dimension of beings without perception ([[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/dn-thanissaro/dn1-thanissaro]] and [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/dn-thanissaro/dn15-thanissaro]]). “Percipient of what’s disappeared” (or: having perceptions that have disappeared) means having entered any of the four formless states. Of these four explanations, the last is the least likely, for as the next lines show, this passage is describing the stage of concentration practice in which one is transcending the fourth jhāna and entering the formless attainment of the infinitude of space. A more likely explanation of “percipient of what’s disappeared” would be the act of holding to perceptions of the breath and of pleasure and pain, even though these phenomena have all disappeared in the fourth jhāna (see [[sn36.11-thanissaro]], [[an9.31-thanissaro]], [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an10/an10.20-thanissaro]], and [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an10/an10.72-thanissaro]]). [↩︎](#^snp4-11-02-ref) ^snp4-11-02

3. This is the point where the meditator leaves the fourth jhāna and enters the perception of the infinitude of space. [↩︎](#^snp4-11-03-ref) ^snp4-11-03

4. Objectification-classifications _(papañca-saṅkhā)_: Nd I defines _papañca_ simply as craving, views, and conceit. A survey of how the term _papañca_ is actually used in the suttas, however, shows that it denotes the mind’s tendency to objectify itself as a being. Then, from that objectification, it searches for nourishment to keep that being in existence, classifying experience in terms conducive to that search and thus giving rise to conflict. As [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/snp-thanissaro/snp4-thanissaro/snp4.14-thanissaro]] points out, the root of the objectification-classifications is the perception, “I am the thinker.” For further discussion of this point, see note 1 to that sutta and the introduction to [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/mn-thanissaro/mn18-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^snp4-11-04-ref) ^snp4-11-04

5. “Spirit” is the usual rendering of the Pali word, _yakkha._ According to Nd I, however, in this context the word _yakkha_ means person, individual, human being, or living being. [↩︎](#^snp4-11-05-ref) ^snp4-11-05

6. In other words, the sage knows that both groups in the previous verse fall back on their knowledge as a measure of the goal, without comprehending the dependency still latent in their knowledge. The sages in the first group are mistaking the experience of neither perception nor non-perception as the goal, and so they are still dependent on that state of concentration. The sages in the second group, by the fact that they claim to be skilled, show that there is still a latent conceit in their experience of not-clinging, and thus it is not totally independent of clinging. (For more on this point, see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/mn-thanissaro/mn102-thanissaro]].) Both groups still maintain the concept of a “spirit” that is purified in the realization of purity. Once these dependencies are comprehended, one gains release from disputes and from states of becoming and not-becoming. It is in this way that knowledge is a means to the goal, but the goal itself is not measured or defined in terms of knowledge. [↩︎](#^snp4-11-06-ref) ^snp4-11-06
