# 4:4  The Pure Octet

“I see the pure, the supreme,

free from disease.

It’s in connection

with what’s seen

that a person’s purity

is.”[1](#^snp4-4-01) ^snp4-4-01-ref

Understanding thus,

having known the “supreme,”

& remaining focused

on purity,

one falls back on that knowledge.

If it’s in connection

with what is seen

that a person’s purity is,

or if stress is abandoned

in connection with knowledge,

then a person with acquisitions

is purified

in connection with something else,[2](#^snp4-4-02) ^snp4-4-02-ref

for his view betrays that

in the way he asserts it.

No brahman[3](#^snp4-4-03) ^snp4-4-03-ref

says purity

comes in connection

with anything else.

Unsmeared with regard

to what’s seen, heard, sensed,

habits or practices,

merit or evil,

not creating

anything here,

he’s let go

of what he’d embraced.[4](#^snp4-4-04) ^snp4-4-04-ref

Abandoning          what’s first,

they depend on     what’s next.[5](#^snp4-4-05) ^snp4-4-05-ref

Following perturbation,[6](#^snp4-4-06) ^snp4-4-06-ref

they don’t cross over the bond.

They embrace & reject

—like a monkey releasing a branch

to seize at another[7](#^snp4-4-07)— ^snp4-4-07-ref

a person undertaking practices on his own,

goes high & low,

latched onto perception.

But having clearly known

through vedas,[8](#^snp4-4-08) having encountered ^snp4-4-08-ref

the Dhamma,

one deeply discerning

doesn’t go

high & low.

He’s enemy-free[9](#^snp4-4-09) ^snp4-4-09-ref

with regard to     all things

seen, heard, or sensed.

By whom, with what,[10](#^snp4-4-10) ^snp4-4-10-ref

should he

be pigeonholed

here in the world?

—one who has seen in this way,

who goes around

open.[11](#^snp4-4-11) ^snp4-4-11-ref

They don’t theorize, don’t yearn,

don’t proclaim “utter purity.”

Untying the tied-up knot of grasping,

they don’t form a desire

anywhere in the world.

The brahman

gone beyond territories,[12](#^snp4-4-12) ^snp4-4-12-ref

has nothing that

—on knowing or seeing—

he’s grasped.

Unimpassionate          for passion,

not impassioned          for dis-,[13](#^snp4-4-13) ^snp4-4-13-ref

he has nothing here

that he’s grasped as supreme.

vv. 788–795

### Notes

1. An ancient Indian belief, dating back to the Vedas, was that the sight of certain things or beings was believed to purify. Thus “in connection with what’s seen” here means both that purity is brought about by means of seeing such a sight, and that one’s purity is measured in terms of having such a sight. This belief survives today in the practice of _darshan._ See [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/dn-thanissaro/dn16-thanissaro]], note 44. [↩︎](#^snp4-4-01-ref) ^snp4-4-01

2. In other words, if purity were simply a matter of seeing or knowing something, a person could be pure in this sense and yet still have acquisitions (= defilements), which would not be true purity. On the use of the phrase, “in connection with,” here, see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/snp-thanissaro/snp4-thanissaro/snp4.9-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^snp4-4-02-ref) ^snp4-4-02

3. “Brahman” in the Buddhist sense, i.e., a person born in any caste who has become an arahant. [↩︎](#^snp4-4-03-ref) ^snp4-4-03

4. Lines such as this may have been the source of the confusion in the different recensions of the Canon—and in Nd I—as to whether the poems in this vagga are concerned with letting go of views that have been embraced _(atta)_ or of self _(attā)._ The compound here, _attañjaho,_ read on its own, could be read either as “he’s let go of what has been embraced” or “he’s let go of self.” However, the following image of a monkey seizing and releasing branches as it moves from tree to tree reinforces the conclusion that the first interpretation is the correct one. [↩︎](#^snp4-4-04-ref) ^snp4-4-04

5. Nd I: Leaving one teacher and going to another; leaving one teaching and going to another. This phrase may also refer to the mind’s tendency to leave one craving to go to another. [↩︎](#^snp4-4-05-ref) ^snp4-4-05

6. For a discussion of unperturbed states of concentration, see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/mn-thanissaro/mn106-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^snp4-4-06-ref) ^snp4-4-06

7. “Like a monkey releasing a branch to seize at another”—an interesting example of a whole phrase that functions as a lamp, i.e., modifying both the phrase before it and the phrase after it. [↩︎](#^snp4-4-07-ref) ^snp4-4-07

8. “Vedas”—Just as the word “brahman” is used in a Buddhist sense above, here the word _veda_ is given a Buddhist sense. According to SnA, in this context it means the knowledge accompanying four transcendent paths: the paths to stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning, and arahantship. [↩︎](#^snp4-4-08-ref) ^snp4-4-08

9. Nd I: The enemies here are the armies of Māra—all unskillful mental qualities. For a detailed inventory of Māra’s armies, see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/snp-thanissaro/snp3/snp3.2-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^snp4-4-09-ref) ^snp4-4-09

10. “By whom, with what”—two meanings of the one Pali word, _kena._ [↩︎](#^snp4-4-10-ref) ^snp4-4-10

11. Nd I: “Open” means having a mind not covered or concealed by craving, defilement, or ignorance. This relates to the many references in Sn to the idea of having one’s roof opened up (see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/snp-thanissaro/snp2/snp2.13-thanissaro]]). This is in contrast to the image discussed [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/snp-thanissaro/snp4-thanissaro/snp4.2-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^snp4-4-11-ref) ^snp4-4-11

12. Nd I: “Territories” = the ten fetters _(saṁyojana)_ and seven obsessions _(anusaya)._ [↩︎](#^snp4-4-12-ref) ^snp4-4-12

13. Nd I: “Passion” = sensuality; “dispassion” = the jhāna states that bring about dispassion for sensuality. However, this may also be a reference to the fact that dispassion is the highest dhamma, whether fabricated or unfabricated ([[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/iti-thanissaro/iti90-thanissaro]]), and yet the arahant is described in [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/snp-thanissaro/snp5/snp5.6-thanissaro]] as having transcended all phenomena. See [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an3/an3.137-thanissaro]], note 1 and [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/snp-thanissaro/snp4-thanissaro/snp4.6-thanissaro]].
