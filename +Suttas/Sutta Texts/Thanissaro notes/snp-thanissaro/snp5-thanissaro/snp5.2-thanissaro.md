# 5:2  Tissa-metteyya’s Questions

Who

here in the world

is contented?

Who

has no agitations?

What thinker

knowing both sides,

doesn’t adhere in between?

Whom

do you call a great person?

Who here

has gone past

the seamstress?—

craving.

The Buddha:

He who

in the midst of sensualities,

follows the holy life,

always mindful, craving-free;

the monk who is

—through fathoming things—

unbound:

He has no agitations. He,

the thinker

knowing both sides,

doesn’t adhere in between.[1](#^snp5-2-01) He ^snp5-2-01-ref

I call a great person. He

here has gone past

the seamstress:          craving.[2](#^snp5-2-02) ^snp5-2-02-ref

vv. 1040–1042

### Notes

1. [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an6/an6.61-thanissaro]] reports a discussion among several elder monks as to what is meant in this poem by “both sides” and “in between.” Six of the elders express the following separate opinions: [↩︎](#^snp5-2-01-ref) ^snp5-2-01

a) Contact is the first side, the origination of contact the second side, and the cessation of contact is in between.

b) The past is the first side, the future the second, and the present is in between.

c) Pleasant feeling is the first side, painful feeling the second, and neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling is in between.

d) Name (mental phenomena) is the first side, form (physical phenomena) the second, and consciousness is in between.

e) The six internal sense media (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, intellect) are the first side, the six external sense media (sights, sounds, aromas, flavors, tactile sensations, ideas) the second side, and consciousness is in between.

f) Self-identity is the first side, the origination of self-identity the second, and the cessation of self-identity is in between.

The issue is then taken to the Buddha, who states that all six interpretations are well-spoken, but the interpretation he had in mind when speaking the poem was the first.

On the cessation of contact, see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/sn-thanissaro/sn35-44-thanissaro/sn35-thanissaro/sn35.117-thanissaro]].

2. The image of craving as a seamstress also appears in [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/thag-thanissaro/thag14-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^snp5-2-02-ref) ^snp5-2-02
