# 5:6  Upasīva’s Questions

Alone, Sakyan, with nothing to rely on,

I can’t venture across

the great flood.

Tell me, All-around Eye,

the support to rely on

for crossing over this flood.

The Buddha:

Mindfully focused on nothingness,[1](#^snp5-6-01) ^snp5-6-01-ref

relying on ‘There isn’t,’

you should cross over the flood.

Abandoning sensuality,

abstaining from conversations,

keep watch for the ending of

craving, night & day.

Upasīva:

One free from passion

for all sensuality

relying on nothingness, letting go of all else,

released in the highest emancipation of perception:

Does he stay there unaffected?

The Buddha:

One free from passion

for all sensuality

relying on nothingness, letting go of all else,

released in the highest emancipation of perception:

He stays there unaffected.

Upasīva:

If, All-around Eye, he stays there,

unaffected for many years,

right there

would he be cooled & released?

Would his consciousness be like that?[2](#^snp5-6-02) ^snp5-6-02-ref

The Buddha:

As a flame overthrown by the force of the wind

goes to an end

that cannot be classified,[3](#^snp5-6-03) ^snp5-6-03-ref

so the sage freed from the name-body[4](#^snp5-6-04) ^snp5-6-04-ref

goes to an end

that cannot be classified.

Upasīva:

One who has reached the end:

Does he not exist,

or is he for eternity

free from dis-ease?

Please, sage, declare this to me

as this phenomenon has been known by you.

The Buddha:

One who has reached the end

has no criterion[5](#^snp5-6-05) ^snp5-6-05-ref

by which anyone would say that—[6](#^snp5-6-06) ^snp5-6-06-ref

for him it doesn’t exist.

When all phenomena are done away with,[7](#^snp5-6-07) ^snp5-6-07-ref

all means of speaking

are done away with as well.

vv. 1069–1076

### Notes

1. “Nothingness” here denotes the dimension of nothingness, one of the four levels of mental absorption on formless themes. One attains this level, after surmounting the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, by focusing on the perception, “There is nothing.” [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/mn-thanissaro/mn26-thanissaro]] tells us that Āḷāra Kālāma, the Buddha’s first teacher when the latter was still a Bodhisatta, had attained this level of mental absorption and had thought that it was the highest possible attainment. The Bodhisatta left him upon realizing that it was not true liberation from stress and suffering. Nevertheless, the dimension of nothingness can be used as a basis for the insight leading to that liberation. On this point, see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/snp-thanissaro/snp5-thanissaro/snp5.14-thanissaro]], below, and [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an9/an9.36-thanissaro]]. On the strategy of relying on the formless states to cross over the flood, see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/mn-thanissaro/mn52-thanissaro]], [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/mn-thanissaro/mn106-thanissaro]], [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/mn-thanissaro/mn111-thanissaro]], and [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an9/an9.36-thanissaro]].

2. Reading _bhavetha viññāṇaṁ tathāvidhassa_ with the Thai edition, interpreting _tathāvidhassa_ as an elision of _tathāvidhaṁ_ (of that sort) and _assa_ (his). The Burmese and Sri Lankan editions read _cavetha_ (would fall; would die) instead of _bhavetha_ (would be). It’s also possible to read _tathāvidhassa_ as the genitive form of _tathāvidha._ Combined with _cavetha,_ this would yield: Would the consciousness of such a one fall? [↩︎](#^snp5-6-02-ref) ^snp5-6-02

3. For a discussion of this passage in light of early Buddhist theories of fire, see _The Mind Like Fire Unbound,_ chapter 1. [↩︎](#^snp5-6-03-ref) ^snp5-6-03

4. _Nāma-kāya_ = mental activities of all sorts. [↩︎](#^snp5-6-04-ref) ^snp5-6-04

5. For a discussion of the meaning of “criterion” in this passage, see _The Mind Like Fire Unbound,_ chapter 1. On the Tathāgata as being undescribable, see _Skill in Questions,_ chapter 8 and appendix 4. [↩︎](#^snp5-6-05-ref) ^snp5-6-05

6. Reading _vajjā_ (he would say/one would say), with the Sri Lankan edition. The Thai has _vajju,_ which is irregular; the Burmese, _vajjaṁ_ (they would say). _Vajjā_ seems to be the best reading here for at least three textual reasons: (a) It fits into the meter better than _vajjaṁ._ (b) There has been no mention of any “they” up to this point in the dialogue. (c) The same line appears in [[snp1.20-thanissaro]], and there all the major editions of the Canon read _vajjā._ [↩︎](#^snp5-6-06-ref) ^snp5-6-06

From an interpretive standpoint, _vajjā_ allows for the Buddha’s answer to respond both to Upasīva’s explicit question—does such a person not exist, or is he for eternity free from disease?—and for his implicit one: What has the Buddha’s own experience been of this state? Reading _vajjā_ as meaning “one would say,” the answer tells of how the state of the person in question would appear to someone else. Reading it as meaning “he would say,” the answer tells of how the person himself would describe the experience of that state. In neither case is there any criterion by which anyone could say, looking from within or without, that such a person doesn’t exist or that he exists for eternity free from disease.

7. This is one of the passages in the Canon that treats unbinding, not as a phenomenon _(dhamma),_ but as the end of phenomena. On this point, see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an3/an3.137-thanissaro]], note 1. [↩︎](#^snp5-6-07-ref) ^snp5-6-07

> **Edition Notice**  
Bhikkhu Thanissaro’s translations are arranged according to the Thai Tipitaka edition. Therefore, some sutta references may not align with the 6th Council or Suttacentral.net numbering schemes, especially in the Saṁyutta Nikāya (SN) and Aṅguttara Nikāya (AN).
