# 5:9  Todeyya’s Questions

One in whom

no sensualities dwell;

in whom

no craving is found;

who has crossed over perplexity—

his emancipation:

What is it like?

The Buddha:

One in whom

no sensualities dwell;

in whom

no craving is found;

who has crossed over perplexity—

his emancipation

is not other than that.[1](#^snp5-9-01) ^snp5-9-01-ref

Todeyya:

Is he without desire,

or desiring?

Discerning or

still acquiring discernment?

Describe the sage to me, Sakyan,

All-around Eye,

so that I may recognize

what he is like.

The Buddha:

He’s without desire,

not desiring;

discerning,

not still acquiring discernment.

Recognize the sage, Todeyya,

as having nothing,

unentangled

in sensuality

& becoming.

vv. 1088–1091

Note

1. Nd IIA: The ending of craving is, in and of itself, emancipation. See [[sn43-thanissaro]].
