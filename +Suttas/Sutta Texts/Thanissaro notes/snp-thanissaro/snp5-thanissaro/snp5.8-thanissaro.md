# 5:8  Hemaka’s Question

In the past,

before hearing Gotama’s message,

when anyone explained ‘It is,’ ‘It will be,’

all that was hearsay,

quotation marks.

All that promoted conjecture

and gave me no pleasure.

Now, sage, teach me the Dhamma

demolishing craving,

knowing which, living mindfully,

one would cross over beyond

entanglement in the world.

The Buddha:

Here, Hemaka,

with regard to things dear

—seen, heard, sensed, & cognized—

there is:

the dispelling of passion & desire,

the unfallen, undying[1](#^snp5-8-01) state of unbinding. ^snp5-8-01-ref

Those knowing this, mindful,

fully unbound

in the here-&-now,

are always[2](#^snp5-8-02) calmed, ^snp5-8-02-ref

have crossed over beyond

entanglement in the world.

vv. 1084–1087

### Notes

1. “Unfallen, undying”: two meanings of the word, _accuta._ [↩︎](#^snp5-8-01-ref) ^snp5-8-01

2. Reading _sadā_ with the Burmese, Sri Lankan, and PTS editions. The Thai edition read _satā,_ mindful, but this is a repetition of _satā_ in the previous line, something that Pali poetry tends to avoid except for purposes of emphasis. [↩︎](#^snp5-8-02-ref) ^snp5-8-02

> **Edition Notice**  
Bhikkhu Thanissaro’s translations are arranged according to the Thai Tipitaka edition. Therefore, some sutta references may not align with the 6th Council or Suttacentral.net numbering schemes, especially in the Saṁyutta Nikāya (SN) and Aṅguttara Nikāya (AN).
