# 1:1  The Snake

_Alternative versions of this poem—a Sanskrit version included in the Udānavarga, and a Gāndhārī version included in the Gāndhārī Dharmapada—have many of the same verses included here, but arranged in a different order. This suggests that the verses originally may have been separate poems, spoken on separate occasions, and that they were gathered together because they share the same refrain._

The monk who subdues his arisen anger

as, with herbs, snake-venom once it has spread,

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

The monk who has cut off passion

without leaving a trace,

as he would, plunging into a lake, a lotus,

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

The monk who has cut off craving

without leaving a trace,

drying up the swift-flowing flood,[1](#^snp1-1-01) ^snp1-1-01-ref

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

The monk who has uprooted conceit

without leaving a trace,

as a great flood, a very weak bridge made of reeds,

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

The monk seeing

in states of becoming

no essence,

as he would,

when examining fig trees,

no flowers,

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

The monk with no inner anger,

who has thus gone beyond

becoming & not-,

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

The monk whose discursive thoughts are dispersed,

well-dealt with inside

without leaving a trace,

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

The monk who hasn’t slipped past or held back,[2](#^snp1-1-02) ^snp1-1-02-ref

transcending all

this objectification,[3](#^snp1-1-03) ^snp1-1-03-ref

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

The monk who hasn’t slipped past or held back,

knowing with regard to the world

that “All this is unreal,”

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

The monk who hasn’t slipped past or held back,

without greed, as “All this is unreal,”

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

The monk who hasn’t slipped past or held back,

without aversion, as “All this is unreal,”

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

The monk who hasn’t slipped past or turned back,

without delusion, as “All this is unreal,”

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

The monk in whom

there are no obsessions[4](#^snp1-1-04) ^snp1-1-04-ref

—the roots of unskillfulness totally destroyed—

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

The monk in whom

there’s nothing born of disturbance[5](#^snp1-1-05) ^snp1-1-05-ref

that would lead him back to this shore,

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

The monk in whom

there’s nothing born of the underbrush[6](#^snp1-1-06) ^snp1-1-06-ref

that would act as a cause

for binding him to becoming,

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

The monk who’s abandoned five hindrances,

who, untroubled, de-arrowed,[7](#^snp1-1-07) ^snp1-1-07-ref

has crossed over doubt,

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
