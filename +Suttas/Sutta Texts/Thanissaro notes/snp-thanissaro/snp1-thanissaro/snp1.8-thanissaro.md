# 1:8  Goodwill

_(This sutta is identical with [Khp 9](../Khp/khp9.html).)_

This is to be done by one skilled in aims

appreciating the state of peace:

Be capable, upright, & straightforward,

easy to instruct, gentle, & not conceited,

content & easy to support,

with few duties, living lightly,

with peaceful faculties, astute,

modest, & no greed for supporters.

Do not do the slightest thing

that the observant would later censure.

Think: _Happy, at rest,_

_may all beings be happy at heart._

_Whatever beings there may be,_

_weak or strong, without exception,_

_long, large,_

_middling, short,_

_subtle, gross,_

_seen & unseen,_

_living near & far away,_

_born or seeking birth:_

_May all beings be happy at heart._

_Let no one deceive another_

_or despise anyone anywhere,_

_or, through anger or resistance-perception,_

_wish for another to suffer._

As a mother would risk her life

to protect her child, her only child,

even so should one cultivate the heart limitlessly

with regard to all beings.[1](#^snp1-8-01) ^snp1-8-01-ref

With goodwill for the entire cosmos,

cultivate the heart limitlessly:

above, below, & all around,

unobstructed, without hostility or hate.

Whether standing, walking,

sitting, or lying down,

as long as one has banished torpor,

one should be determined on this mindfulness.[2](#^snp1-8-02) ^snp1-8-02-ref

This is called a Brahmā abiding

here.

Not taken with views,

but virtuous & consummate in vision,

having subdued greed for sensuality,

one never again

will lie in the womb.

vv. 143–152

### Notes

1. The image here is sometimes misconstrued as saying that one should protect all beings as a mother would protect her only child. Actually, the parallel is not between the child and all living beings; it is between the child and one’s cultivation of the heart: One should protect one’s goodwill toward all beings in the same way that a mother would protect her only child. On this point, see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/mn-thanissaro/mn21-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^snp1-8-01-ref) ^snp1-8-01

2. This line has to be read in line with the Buddha’s definition of mindfulness as the ability to keep something in mind. See [[sn48.10-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^snp1-8-02-ref) ^snp1-8-02
