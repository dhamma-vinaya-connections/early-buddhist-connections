# Itivuttaka 65

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, there are these three kinds of good conduct. Which three? Bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, mental good conduct. These are the three kinds of good conduct.”

Having abandoned

bodily misconduct,

acts of verbal misconduct,

misconduct of mind,

& whatever else is flawed,

not having done what’s not skillful,

having done much that is,

at the break-up of the body,

the discerning one reappears

in heaven.
