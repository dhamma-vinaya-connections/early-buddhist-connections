# Itivuttaka 23

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “This one quality, monks, when developed & pursued, keeps both kinds of benefit secure: benefit in this life & in lives to come. Which one quality? Heedfulness with regard to skillful qualities. This is the one quality that, when developed & pursued, keeps both kinds of benefit secure: benefit in this life & in lives to come.”

They praise heedfulness, the wise,

in doing acts of merit.

When heedful, wise,

you achieve both kinds of benefit:

benefits            in this life,

& benefits            in lives to come.

By breaking through to your benefit,

you’re called enlightened,

wise.
