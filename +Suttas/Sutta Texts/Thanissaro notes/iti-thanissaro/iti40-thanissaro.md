# Itivuttaka 40

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, ignorance[1](#^iti40note01) precedes the arrival of unskillful qualities; lack of shame & lack of compunction[2](#^iti40note02) follow after. Clear knowing precedes the arrival of skillful qualities; shame & compunction follow after.” ^iti40note01-ref ^iti40note02-ref

Any bad destinations

in this world, in the next,

are rooted in ignorance–all–

accumulations

of desire & greed.

And when a person of evil desires

lacks shame & respect,

evil comes from that,

and by that he goes

to deprivation.

So cleansing away

ignorance, desire, & greed,

a monk giving rise to clear knowing

would abandon all bad destinations.

### Notes

1. Ignorance _(avijjā)_ means ignorance of stress, its origination, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation. [↩︎](#^iti40note01-ref) ^iti40note01

2. Shame _(hiri)_ means a healthy sense of shame–derived from self-esteem–at the idea of doing evil. Compunction _(ottappa)_ means fear of the consequences of doing evil. [↩︎](#^iti40note02-ref) ^iti40note02
