# Itivuttaka 36

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, this holy life is lived, not for the sake of deceiving people, not for the sake of inveigling people, not for the sake of the rewards of gain, offerings, & tribute, nor with the thought, ‘Thus may people know me.’ This holy life is lived for the sake of direct knowledge[1](#^iti36note01) & full comprehension.” ^iti36note01-ref

For the sake of direct knowledge & full

comprehension,

he, the Blessed One, taught

a holy life not handed down,

coming ashore

in Unbinding.

This path is pursued

by those great in purpose,

great seers.

Those who follow it,

as taught by the One Awakened,

heeding the Teacher’s message,

will put an end

to suffering & stress.

Note

1. Direct knowledge = _abhiññā._ The Canon lists six types of _abhiññā:_ psychic powers, clairaudience, the ability to read the minds of others, recollection of past lives, clairvoyance, and–most important of all–knowledge of the ending of the mental effluents.

> **Edition Notice**  
Bhikkhu Thanissaro’s translations are arranged according to the Thai Tipitaka edition. Therefore, some sutta references may not align with the 6th Council or Suttacentral.net numbering schemes, especially in the Saṁyutta Nikāya (SN) and Aṅguttara Nikāya (AN).
