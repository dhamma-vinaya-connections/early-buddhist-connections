# Itivuttaka 52

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, there are these three feelings. Which three? A feeling of pleasure, a feeling of pain, a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain. These are the three feelings.”

Centered,

alert,

mindful,

the Awakened One’s

disciple

discerns feelings,

how feelings come into play,

where they cease,

& the path to their ending.

With the ending of feelings, a monk

free from hunger

is totally unbound.
