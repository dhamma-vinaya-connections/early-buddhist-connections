# Itivuttaka 8

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, one who has not fully known & fully understood conceit, whose mind has not been cleansed of passion for it, has not abandoned it, is incapable of putting an end to stress. But one who has fully known & fully understood conceit, whose mind has been cleansed of passion for it, has abandoned it, is capable of putting an end to stress.”

People are

possessed by conceit

bound with conceit

delighted with becoming.

Not comprehending conceit,

they come to further becoming.

But those who, letting go of conceit,

are, in its destruction, released,

conquering the bond of conceit,

go beyond

all bonds.
