# Itivuttaka 82

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, these three divine sounds sound forth among the devas on appropriate occasions. Which three? When a disciple of the noble ones, shaving off his hair & beard, clothing himself in the ochre robe, makes up his mind to go forth from the home life into homelessness, on that occasion the divine sound sounds forth among the devas: ‘This disciple of the noble ones has made up his mind to do battle with Māra.’ This is the first divine sound that sounds forth among the devas on appropriate occasions.

“When a disciple of the noble ones lives devoted to developing the seven [sets of] qualities that are wings to awakening,[1](#^iti82note01) on that occasion the divine sound sounds forth among the devas: ‘This disciple of the noble ones is doing battle with Māra.’ This is the second divine sound that sounds forth among the devas on appropriate occasions. ^iti82note01-ref

“When a disciple of the noble ones, through the ending of effluents, enters & remains in the effluent-free awareness-release & discernment-release, directly knowing & realizing it for himself right in the here-&-now, on that occasion the divine sound sounds forth among the devas: ‘This disciple of the noble ones, having won the battle, now rules victorious at the head of the battle.’ This is the third divine sound that sounds forth among the devas on appropriate occasions.

“These are the three divine sounds that sound forth among the devas on appropriate occasions.”

Seeing he’s won the battle

–the disciple of the Rightly

Self-awakened One–

even the devas pay homage

to this great one, thoroughly mature.

“Homage to you, O thoroughbred man–

you who have won the hard victory,

defeating the army of Death,

unhindered in

emancipation.”

Thus they pay homage, the devas,

to one who has reached the heart’s goal,

for they see in him no means[2](#^iti82note02) ^iti82note02-ref

that would bring him under Death’s sway.

### Notes

1. The wings to awakening are the four establishings of mindfulness, the four right exertions, the four bases for power, the five faculties, the five strengths, the seven factors for awakening, and the noble eightfold path. [↩︎](#^iti82note01-ref) ^iti82note01

2. Reading _na passanti_ with the Sri Lankan edition. The Thai edition reads, _namassanti,_ “they pay homage,” which makes no sense. [↩︎](#^iti82note02-ref) ^iti82note02

> **Edition Notice**  
Bhikkhu Thanissaro’s translations are arranged according to the Thai Tipitaka edition. Therefore, some sutta references may not align with the 6th Council or Suttacentral.net numbering schemes, especially in the Saṁyutta Nikāya (SN) and Aṅguttara Nikāya (AN).
