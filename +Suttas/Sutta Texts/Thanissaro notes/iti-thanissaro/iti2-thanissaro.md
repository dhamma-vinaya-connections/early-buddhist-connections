# Itivuttaka 2

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Abandon one quality, monks, and I guarantee you non-return. Which one quality? Abandon aversion as the one quality, and I guarantee you non-return.”

The aversion with which

beings go to a bad destination,

upset:

from rightly knowing that aversion,

those who see clearly

let go.

Letting go,

they never come to this world

again.
