# Itivuttaka 70

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, I have seen beings who–endowed with bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, & mental misconduct; who reviled noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views–at the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. It is not from having heard this from another contemplative or brahman that I tell you that I have seen beings who–endowed with bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, & mental misconduct; who reviled noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views–at the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell. It is from having known it myself, seen it myself, realized it myself that I tell you that I have seen beings who–endowed with bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, & mental misconduct; who reviled noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views–at the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell.”

With mind wrongly directed,

speaking wrong speech,

doing wrong deeds with the body:

a person here

of next-to-nothing learning,

a doer of evil

here in this next-to-nothing life,

at the break-up of the body,

undiscerning,

reappears in hell.
