# Itivuttaka 1

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Abandon one quality, monks, and I guarantee you non-return. Which one quality? Abandon greed as the one quality, and I guarantee you non-return.”[1](#^iti1note01) _This is the meaning of what the Blessed One said. So with regard to this it was said:_[2](#^iti1note02) ^iti1note01-ref ^iti1note02-ref

The greed with which

beings go to a bad destination,[3](#^iti1note03) ^iti1note03-ref

coveting:

from rightly knowing that greed,

those who see clearly

let go.

Letting go,

they never come to this world

again.

_This, too, was the meaning of what was said by the Blessed One, so I have heard._[2](#^iti1note02) ^iti1note02-ref

### Notes

1. Non-return: The third of the four levels of awakening. On reaching this level, one will never be reborn in this world. A non-returner who does not go on to attain Arahantship in this lifetime will be reborn in the Brahma worlds called the Pure Abodes and will attain nibbāna there. [↩︎](#^iti1note01-ref) ^iti1note01

2. These two statements are repeated in each itivuttaka. To avoid monotony, they are given here only in the first and last itivuttakas. [↩︎](#^iti1note02-ref) ^iti1note02

3. The bad destinations: rebirth in hell, as a hungry ghost, as an angry demon, or as a common animal. As with the good destinations–rebirth as a human being, in heaven, or in the Brahma worlds–these states are impermanent and dependent on _kamma._ [↩︎](#^iti1note03-ref) ^iti1note03
