# Itivuttaka 28

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Endowed with two things, monks, a monk lives in stress in the present life–troubled, distressed, & feverish–and at the break-up of the body, after death, a bad destination can be expected. Which two? A lack of guarding of the doors of the sense faculties, and knowing no moderation in food. Endowed with these two things, a monk lives in stress in the present life–troubled, distressed, & feverish–and at the break-up of the body, after death, a bad destination can be expected.”

Eye & ear & nose,

tongue, body & mind:

when a monk leaves these doors unguarded

–knowing no moderation in food,

not restraining his senses–

he experiences stress:

stress in body, stress

in mind.

Burning in body,

burning in mind,

whether by day or by night,

one like this

lives in suffering & stress.
