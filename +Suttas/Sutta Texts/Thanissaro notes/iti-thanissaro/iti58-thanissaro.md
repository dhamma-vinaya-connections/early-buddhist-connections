# Itivuttaka 58

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, there are these three cravings. Which three? Craving for sensuality, craving for becoming, craving for non-becoming. These are the three cravings.”

Bound with the bondage of craving,

their minds smitten

with becoming & non-,

they are bound               with the bondage of Māra–

people                  with no safety from bondage,

beings                  going through the wandering-on,

headed for birth & death.

While those who’ve abandoned craving,

free from the craving for becoming & non-,

reaching the ending of effluents,

though in the world,

have gone            beyond.

> **Edition Notice**
