# Itivuttaka 101

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, these four things are next to nothing, both easy to gain & blameless. Which four? Cast-off cloth is next to nothing, both easy to gain & blameless. Alms food is next to nothing, both easy to gain & blameless. The root of a tree as a dwelling place is next to nothing, both easy to gain & blameless. Medicine made of smelly urine[1](#^iti101note01) is next to nothing, both easy to gain & blameless. These are the four things that are next to nothing, both easy to gain & blameless. When a monk is content with what is next to nothing, easy to gain & blameless, then I say that he has one of the component factors of the contemplative life.” ^iti101note01-ref

Content with what’s blameless,

next to nothing,

easy to gain,

his mind not vexed over

lodging, clothing,

food, or drink:

the four directions offer him

no                  obstruction.

These things, declared congenial

for the contemplative life,

are possessed by the monk

heedful, content.

Note

1. This is one of a monk’s basic requisites. There is some disagreement as to whether it refers to medicine pickled in urine, or to the use of urine as a medicine (as is still practiced in parts of Asia today).

This itivuttaka is identical with [[an4.27-thanissaro]].
