# Itivuttaka 61

_This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:_ “Monks, there are these three eyes. Which three? The eye of flesh, the divine eye,[1](#^iti61note01) & the eye of discernment. These are the three eyes.” ^iti61note01-ref

The eye of flesh,

the eye divine,

the eye of discernment

unsurpassed:

these three eyes were taught

by the Superlative Person.

The arising of the eye of flesh

is the path to the eye divine.

When knowledge arises,

the eye of discernment unsurpassed:

whoever gains this eye

is–from all suffering & stress–

released.

Note

1. For a description of what is seen with the divine eye, see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/dn-thanissaro/dn2-thanissaro]].
