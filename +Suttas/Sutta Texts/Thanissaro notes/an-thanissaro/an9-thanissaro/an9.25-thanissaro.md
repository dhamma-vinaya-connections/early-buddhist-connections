## AN9.25 Discernment

## ## Paññā Sutta


“Monks, when a monk’s mind is well shored-up by discernment, it is suitable for him to say, ‘Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.’ And how is a monk’s mind well shored-up by discernment?

“‘My mind is devoid of passion’: His mind is well shored-up by discernment.

“‘My mind is devoid of aversion’: His mind is well shored-up by discernment.

“‘My mind is devoid of delusion’: His mind is well shored-up by discernment.

“‘My mind isn’t subject to being impassioned’: His mind is well shored-up by discernment.

“‘My mind isn’t subject to being aversive’: His mind is well shored-up by discernment.

“‘My mind isn’t subject to being deluded’: His mind is well shored-up by discernment.

“‘My mind isn’t subject to returning for the sake of passion for sensuality’:[1](#^[[an9-thanissaro]].25note01) His mind is well shored-up by discernment. ^[[an9-thanissaro]].25note01-ref

“‘My mind isn’t subject to returning for the sake of passion for form’: His mind is well shored-up by discernment.

“‘My mind isn’t subject to returning for the sake of passion for the formless’: His mind is well shored-up by discernment.

“Monks, when a monk’s mind is well shored-up by discernment, it is suitable for him to say, ‘Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.’”

Note

1. Reading _kāmarāgāyāti_ with the Thai edition. The other editions read _kāmabhavāyāti,_ “for the sake of sensuality-becoming.” There are similar differences below, with the Thai reading _rūparāgāyāti_ and _arūparāgāyāti_ where the other editions read _rūpabhavāyāti_ and _arūpabhavāyāti._
