## AN8.61 Desire

## ## Icchā Sutta


“Monks, these eight persons are to be found existing in the world. Which eight?

“There is the case where a desire for gain arises in a monk living independently in seclusion. He rouses himself, strives, & makes an effort for gain, yet for him—rousing himself, striving, & making an effort for gain—gain doesn’t arise. Because of that lack of gain, he sorrows, grieves, & laments, beats his breast, becomes distraught. This is called a monk who desires gain, who rouses himself, strives, & makes an effort for gain, but not gaining it, sorrows & laments. And he has fallen away from the True Dhamma.
