## AN6.71 Capable of Realizing

## ## Sakkhibhabba Sutta


“Monks, endowed with six qualities, a monk is incapable of attaining what is to be witnessed right there whenever there is an opening.[1](#^[[an6-thanissaro]].71note01) Which six? ^[[an6-thanissaro]].71note01-ref

“There is the case where a monk doesn’t discern as it has come to be that ‘This quality has a share in decline.’ He doesn’t discern as it has come to be that ‘This quality has a share in stability.’ He doesn’t discern as it has come to be that ‘This quality has a share in distinction.’ He doesn’t discern as it has come to be that ‘This quality has a share in penetration.’[2](#^[[an6-thanissaro]].71note02) He is one who doesn’t act attentively. He is one who doesn’t act suitably. ^[[an6-thanissaro]].71note02-ref

“Endowed with these six qualities, a monk is incapable of attaining what is to be witnessed right there whenever there is an opening.

“Monks, endowed with six qualities, a monk is capable of attaining what is to be witnessed right there whenever there is an opening. Which six?

“There is the case where a monk discerns as it has come to be that ‘This quality has a share in decline.’ He discerns as it has come to be that ‘This quality has a share in stability.’ He discerns as it has come to be that ‘This quality has a share in distinction.’ He discerns as it has come to be that ‘This quality has a share in penetration.’ He is one who acts attentively. He is one who acts suitably.

“Endowed with these six qualities, a monk is capable of attaining what is to be witnessed right there whenever there is an opening.”

### Notes

1. This is a reference to the six cognitive skills. See [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an5/an5.28-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^[[an6-thanissaro]].71note01-ref) ^[[an6-thanissaro]].71note01

2. A quality with a share in decline is one that causes the mind to fall from concentration. A quality with a share in stability is one that helps to maintain concentration. A quality with a share in distinction is one that leads to higher stages of concentration. A quality with a share in penetration is one leading to liberating insight.
