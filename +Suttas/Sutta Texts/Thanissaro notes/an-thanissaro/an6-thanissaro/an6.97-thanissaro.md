## AN6.97 Rewards

## ## Ānisaṁsa Sutta


“Monks, there are these six rewards in realizing the fruit of stream-entry. Which six? One is certain of the true Dhamma. One is not subject to falling back. There is no suffering over what has had a limit placed on it.[1](#^[[an6-thanissaro]].97note01) One is endowed with uncommon knowledge.[2](#^[[an6-thanissaro]].97note02) One rightly sees cause, along with causally-originated phenomena. ^[[an6-thanissaro]].97note01-ref ^[[an6-thanissaro]].97note02-ref

“These are the six rewards in realizing the fruit of Stream-entry.”

### Notes

1. _Pariyanta-katassa na dukkhaṁ hoti:_ In other words, one has no regret over the fact that one will experience rebirth only a limited number of times, and that a limit has been placed on the amount of suffering one is still subject to (see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/sn-thanissaro/sn12-21-thanissaro/sn13-thanissaro/sn13.1-thanissaro]], [8](../SN/SN13_8.html)). This statement counteracts the notion, sometimes expressed even in Buddhist circles, that a person can get “stuck” in release against his or her will, or that an awakened person might regret putting an end to saṁsāra. [↩︎](#^[[an6-thanissaro]].97note01-ref) ^[[an6-thanissaro]].97note01

This statement may also refer to the realization, mentioned in [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/mn-thanissaro/mn140-thanissaro]] and many other suttas, that pains are limited to life and limited to the body. Seeing these limits, and what lies beyond them, allows one not to suffer over those pains.

2. According to the Commentary, uncommon knowledge is knowledge in which unawakened people have no share. [↩︎](#^[[an6-thanissaro]].97note02-ref) ^[[an6-thanissaro]].97note02
