## AN4.31 Wheels

## ## Cakka Sutta


“There are these four wheels, endowed with which human beings & devas develop a four-wheeled prosperity; endowed with which human beings & devas in no long time achieve greatness & abundance in terms of wealth. Which four? Living in a civilized land, associating with people of integrity, directing oneself rightly, and having done merit in the past. These are the four wheels, endowed with which human beings & devas develop a four-wheeled prosperity; endowed with which human beings & devas in no long time achieve greatness & abundance in terms of wealth.

“If you dwell in a civilized place,

make friends with the noble ones,

rightly direct yourself,

and have made merit in the past,

there will roll to you

crops, wealth, status, honor,

& happiness.”
