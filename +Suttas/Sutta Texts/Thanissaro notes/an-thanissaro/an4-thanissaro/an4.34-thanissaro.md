## AN4.34 Confidence

## ## Pasāda Sutta


“Monks, there are these four supreme objects of confidence. Which four?

“Among whatever beings there may be—footless, two-footed, four-footed, many footed; with form or formless; percipient, non-percipient, neither percipient nor non-percipient—the Tathāgata, worthy & rightly self-awakened, is considered supreme. Those who have confidence in the Awakened One have confidence in what is supreme; and for those with confidence in the supreme, supreme is the result.

“Among whatever fabricated qualities there may be, the noble eightfold path is considered supreme. Those who have confidence in the noble eightfold path have confidence in what is supreme; and for those with confidence in the supreme, supreme is the result.

“Among whatever dhammas there may be, fabricated or unfabricated, dispassion—the subduing of intoxication, the elimination of thirst, the uprooting of attachment, the breaking of the round, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, the realization of unbinding—is considered supreme. Those who have confidence in the dhamma of dispassion have confidence in what is supreme; and for those with confidence in the supreme, supreme is the result.

“Among whatever communities or groups there may be, the Saṅgha of the Tathāgata’s disciples is considered supreme—i.e., the four [groups of noble disciples] when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as persons.[1](#^[[an4-thanissaro]].34note01) Those who have confidence in the Saṅgha have confidence in what is supreme; and for those with confidence in the supreme, supreme will be the result. ^[[an4-thanissaro]].34note01-ref

“These, monks, are the four supreme objects of confidence.”

With 
confidence,
	realizing the supreme Dhamma 
	to be supreme;
confidence in the supreme Buddha,
	unsurpassed 
	in deserving offerings;
confidence in the supreme Dhamma,
	the bliss of stilling, dispassion;
confidence in the supreme Saṅgha,
	unsurpassed 
	as a field of merit;
having given gifts to the supreme,
	one develops supreme merit,
	supreme long life & beauty, 
	status, honor, 
bliss, & strength.
  

Having given to the supreme,
	the wise person, centered 
	in supreme Dhamma,
whether becoming a divine or human being,
	rejoices, 
having attained the supreme.
  

Note

1. The four groups of noble disciples when taken as pairs are those who have attained (1) the path to stream-entry and the fruition of stream-entry; (2) the path to once-returning and the fruition of once-returning; (3) the path to non-returning and the fruition of non-returning; and (4) the path to arahantship and the fruition of arahantship. Taking each attainment singly gives eight “individuals.”
