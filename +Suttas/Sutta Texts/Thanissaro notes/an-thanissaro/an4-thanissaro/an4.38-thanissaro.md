## AN4.38 Detached

## ## Paṭilīna Sutta


“Monks, a monk who has shaken off idiosyncratic truths _[pacceka-sacca],_[1](#^[[an4-thanissaro]].38note01) who has thoroughly given up searching, who is calmed in his bodily fabrication,[2](#^[[an4-thanissaro]].38note02) is said to be detached. ^[[an4-thanissaro]].38note01-ref ^[[an4-thanissaro]].38note02-ref

“And how has a monk shaken off idiosyncratic truths? There is the case where a monk has shaken off the run-of-the-mill idiosyncratic truths of run-of-the-mill contemplatives & brahmans—in other words, ‘The cosmos is eternal,’ ‘The cosmos is not eternal,’ ‘The cosmos is finite,’ ‘The cosmos is infinite,’ ‘The soul & the body are the same,’ ‘The soul is one thing and the body another,’ ‘After death a Tathāgata exists,’ ‘After death a Tathāgata does not exist,’ ‘After death a Tathāgata both does & does not exist,’ ‘After death a Tathāgata neither does nor does not exist.’ All of these he has thrown off, shaken off, renounced, vomited up, let go, abandoned, relinquished. This is how a monk has shaken off idiosyncratic truths.

“And how has a monk thoroughly given up searching? There is the case where a monk has abandoned his search for sensuality, has abandoned his search for becoming, and has allayed his search for a holy life.[3](#^[[an4-thanissaro]].38note03) This is how a monk has thoroughly given up searching. ^[[an4-thanissaro]].38note03-ref

“And how is a monk calmed in his bodily fabrication? There is the case where a monk, with the abandoning of pleasure & pain—as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress—enters & remains in the fourth jhāna: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is how a monk is calmed in his bodily fabrication.

“And how is a monk detached? There is the case where a monk’s conceit, ‘I am,’ is abandoned, its root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined for future arising. This is how a monk is detached.”

Sensuality-search, becoming-search,

together with the holy-life search—

i.e., grasping at ‘such is the truth’

based on an accumulation

of viewpoints:

Through the relinquishing of searches

& the abolishing of viewpoints

of one dispassionate to

all passion,

and released in the ending

of craving,

he, a monk

peaceful, mindful,

calmed, undefeated,

awakened

with the breaking-through of conceit,

is said to be

detached.

### Notes

1. _Pacceka_ can also mean “singular” or “personal.” Idiosyncratic truths are the opposite of noble truths, which are universal. See [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/snp-thanissaro/snp4/snp4.8-thanissaro]] and [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/snp-thanissaro/snp4/snp4.12-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^[[an4-thanissaro]].38note01-ref) ^[[an4-thanissaro]].38note01

2. “Bodily fabrication” _(kāya-saṅkhāra)_ is a technical term for the in-and-out breath. See [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/mn-thanissaro/mn44-thanissaro]]. On the stilling of the in-and-out breath as a defining feature of the fourth jhāna, see [[sn36.11-thanissaro]], [[an9.31-thanissaro]], and [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an10/an10.72-thanissaro]]. The definition of the calming of bodily fabrication given in this sutta helps to explain what is meant by the fourth step in mindfulness of breathing: “He trains himself, ‘I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.’ He trains himself, ‘I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.’” See [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/mn-thanissaro/mn118-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^[[an4-thanissaro]].38note02-ref) ^[[an4-thanissaro]].38note02

3. On these three searches, see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/iti-thanissaro/iti54-thanissaro]]. The Commentary to this sutta says that the search for a holy life is allayed with the path of arahantship, although the search for a holy life in the form of views subsides earlier with the path of stream-entry.
