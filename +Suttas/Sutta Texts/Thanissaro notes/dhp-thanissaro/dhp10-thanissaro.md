## Chapter 10

# Dhp X : The Rod

All

tremble at the rod,

all

are fearful of death.

Drawing the parallel to

yourself,

neither kill nor get others to kill.

All

tremble at the rod,

all

hold their life dear.

Drawing the parallel to

yourself,

neither kill nor get others to kill.

### Verse 129-130

129-130
Whoever takes a rod

to harm living beings desiring ease,

when he himself is looking for ease,

meets with no ease after death.

Whoever doesn’t take a rod

to harm living beings desiring ease,

when he himself is looking for ease,

meets with ease after death.

### Verse 131-132

131-132
Speak harshly to no one,

or the words will be thrown

right back at you.

Contentious talk is painful,

for you get struck by rods in return.

If, like a flattened metal pot

you don’t resound,

you’ve attained an Unbinding;

in you there’s found

no contention.

### Verse 133-134

133-134
As a cowherd with a rod

drives cows to the field,

so aging & death

drive the life

of living beings.

### Verse 135

135
When doing evil deeds,

the fool is oblivious.

The dullard

is tormented

by his own deeds,

as if burned by a fire.

### Verse 136

136
Whoever, with a rod,

harasses an innocent man, unarmed,

quickly falls into any of ten things:

harsh pains, devastation, a broken body, grave illness, mental derangement, trouble with the government, violent slander, relatives lost, property dissolved, houses burned down.

At the break-up of the body

this one with no discernment,

reappears in

hell.

### Verse 137-140

137-140
Neither nakedness nor matted hair

nor mud nor the refusal of food

nor sleeping on the bare ground

nor dust & dirt nor squatting austerities

cleanses the mortal

who’s not gone beyond doubt.

If, though adorned, one lives in tune

with the chaste life

–calmed, tamed, & assured–

having put down the rod toward all beings,

he’s a contemplative

a brahman

a monk.

### Verse 141-142

141-142
Who in the world

is a man constrained by conscience,

who awakens      to censure

like a fine stallion      to the whip?

### Verse 143

143
Like a fine stallion

struck with a whip,

be ardent & chastened.

Through conviction

virtue, persistence,

concentration, judgment,

consummate in knowledge & conduct,

mindful,

you’ll abandon this not-insignificant pain.

### Verse 144

144
Irrigators guide

the water.

Fletchers shape

the arrow shaft.

Carpenters shape

the wood.

Those of good practices control

themselves.

### Verse 145

145
