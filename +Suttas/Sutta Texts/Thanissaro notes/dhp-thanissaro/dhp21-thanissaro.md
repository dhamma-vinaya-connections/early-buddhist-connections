## Chapter 21

he’s not set free.

### Verse 291

291
In those who

reject what should,

& do what shouldn’t be done

–heedless, insolent–

effluents grow.

But for those who

are well-applied, constantly,

to mindfulness immersed in the body;

don’t indulge

in what shouldn’t be done;

& persist

in what should

–mindful, alert–

effluents come to an end.

### Verse 292-293

292-293
Having killed mother & father,

two warrior kings,

the kingdom & its dependency–

the brahman, untroubled, travels on.

Having killed mother & father,

two learned kings,

&, fifth, a tiger–

the brahman, untroubled, travels on.

Gotama’s disciples

whose hearts delight, both day & night,

in harmlessness.

They awaken, always wide awake:

Gotama’s disciples

whose hearts delight, both day & night,

in developing the mind.

### Verse 296-301

296-301
Hard

is the life gone forth,

hard to delight in.

Hard

is the miserable

householder’s life.

It’s painful

to stay with dissonant people,

painful to travel the road.

So be

neither traveler

nor pained.

### Verse 302

302
The man of conviction

endowed with virtue,

glory, & wealth:

wherever he goes

he is honored.

### Verse 303

303
The good shine from afar

like the snowy Himalayas.

The bad don’t appear

even when near,

like arrows shot into the night.

### Verse 304

304
Sitting alone,

resting alone,

walking alone,
