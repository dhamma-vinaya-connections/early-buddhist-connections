## Chapter 19

hostility,

fear–

is said to be wise.

Simply talking a lot

doesn’t maintain the Dhamma.

Whoever

–although he’s heard next to nothing–

sees Dhamma through his body,

is not heedless of Dhamma:

_he’s_ one who maintains the Dhamma.

### Verse 258-259

258-259
A head of gray hairs

doesn’t mean one’s an elder.

Advanced in years,

one’s called an old fool.

But one in whom there is

truth, restraint,

rectitude, gentleness,

self-control–

_he’s_ called an elder,

his impurities disgorged,

enlightened.

### Verse 260-261

260-261
Not by suave conversation

or lotus-like coloring

does an envious, miserly cheat

become an exemplary man.

But one in whom this is

cut through

up-rooted

wiped out–

he’s called exemplary,

his aversion disgorged,

intelligent.

### Verse 262-263

262-263
A shaven head

doesn’t mean a contemplative.

The liar observing no duties,

filled with greed & desire:

what kind of contemplative’s he?

But whoever tunes out

the dissonance

of his evil qualities

–large or small–

in every way

by bringing evil to consonance:

he’s called a contemplative.

### Verse 264-265

264-265
Begging from others

doesn’t mean one’s a monk.

As long as one follows

householders’ ways,

one is no monk at all.

But whoever puts aside

both merit & evil and,

living the chaste life,

judiciously

goes through the world:

_he’s_ called a monk.

### Verse 266-267

266-267
Not by silence

does someone confused

& unknowing

turn into a sage.

But whoever–wise,

as if holding the scales,

taking the excellent–

rejects evil deeds:

he is a sage,

that’s how he’s a sage.

Whoever can weigh

both sides of the world:

that’s how he’s called

a sage.

### Verse 268-269

268-269
Not by harming life

does one become noble.

One is termed

noble

for being

gentle

to all living things.

### Verse 270

270
Monk,

don’t

on account of

your habits & practices,

great erudition,

concentration attainments,

secluded dwelling,

or the thought, ‘I touch

the renunciate ease

that run-of-the-mill people
