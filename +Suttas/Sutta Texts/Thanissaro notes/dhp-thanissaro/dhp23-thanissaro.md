## Chapter 23

Excellent are tamed mules,

tamed thoroughbreds,

tamed horses from Sindh.

Excellent, tamed tuskers,

great elephants.

But even more excellent

are those         self-tamed.

For not by these mounts could you go

to the land unreached,

as the tamed one goes

by taming, well-taming, himself.

### Verse 322-323

322-323
The tusker, Dhanapalaka,

deep in rut, is hard to control.

Bound, he won’t eat a morsel:

the tusker misses

the elephant wood.

### Verse 324

324
When torpid & over-fed,

a sleepy-head lolling about

like a stout hog, fattened on fodder:

a dullard enters the womb

over &

over again.

### Verse 325

325
Before, this mind went wandering

however it pleased,

wherever it wanted,

by whatever way that it liked.

Today I will hold it aptly in check–

as one wielding a goad, an elephant in rut.

### Verse 326

326
Delight in heedfulness.

Watch over your own mind.

Lift yourself up

from the hard-going way,

like a tusker sunk in the mud.

### Verse 327

327
If you gain a mature companion–

a fellow traveler, right-living, enlightened–

overcoming all dangers

go with him, gratified,

mindful.

If you don’t gain a mature companion–

a fellow traveler, right-living, enlightened–

go alone

like a king renouncing his kingdom,

like the elephant in the Matanga wilds,

his herd.

Going alone is better.

There’s no companionship with a fool.

Go alone,

doing no evil, at peace,

like the elephant in the Matanga wilds.

### Verse 328-330

328-330
A blessing:   friends when the need arises.

A blessing:   contentment with whatever there is.

Merit at the ending of life is a blessing.

A blessing:   the abandoning of all suffering

& stress.

A blessing in the world:   reverence to your mother.

A blessing:   reverence to your father as well.

A blessing in the world:   reverence to a contemplative.

A blessing:   reverence for a brahman, too.

A blessing into old age is virtue.
