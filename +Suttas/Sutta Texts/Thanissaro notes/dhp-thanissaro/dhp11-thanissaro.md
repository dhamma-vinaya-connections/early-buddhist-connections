## Chapter 11

is bound to break up,

for life is hemmed in with death.

### Verse 148

148
On seeing these bones

discarded

like gourds in the fall,

pigeon-gray:

what delight?

### Verse 149

149
A city made of bones,

plastered over with flesh & blood,

whose hidden treasures are:

pride & contempt,

aging & death.

### Verse 150

150
Even royal chariots

well-embellished

get run down,

and so does the body

succumb to old age.

But the Dhamma of the good

doesn’t succumb to old age:

the good let the civilized know.

### Verse 151

151
This unlistening man

matures like an ox.

His muscles develop,

his discernment      not.

### Verse 152

152
Through the round of many births I roamed

without reward,

without rest,

seeking the house-builder.

Painful is birth again

& again.

House-builder, you’re seen!

You will not build a house again.

All your rafters broken,

the ridge pole dismantled,

immersed in dismantling, the mind

has attained to the end of craving.

### Verse 153-154

153-154
Neither living the chaste life

nor gaining wealth in their youth,

they waste away like old herons

in a dried-up lake

depleted of fish.

Neither living the chaste life
