## Chapter 4

the flower.

### Verse 44-45

44-45
Knowing this body

is like foam,

realizing its nature

–a mirage–

cutting out

the blossoms of Mara,

you go where the King of Death

can’t see.

### Verse 46

46
The man immersed in

gathering blossoms,

his heart distracted:

death sweeps him away–

as a great flood,

a village asleep.

The man immersed in

gathering blossoms,

his heart distracted,

insatiable in sensual pleasures:

the End-Maker holds him

under his sway.

### Verse 47-48

47-48
As a bee–without harming

the blossom,

its color,

its fragrance–

takes its nectar & flies away:

so should the sage

go through a village.

### Verse 49

49
Focus,

not on the rudenesses of others,

not on what they’ve done

or left undone,

but on what you

have & haven’t done

yourself.

### Verse 50

50
Just like a blossom,

bright colored

but scentless:

a well-spoken word

is fruitless

when not carried out.

Just like a blossom,

bright colored

& full of scent:

a well-spoken word

is fruitful

when well carried out.

### Verse 51-52

51-52
Just as from a heap of flowers

many garland strands can be made,

even so

one born & mortal

should do

–with what’s born & is mortal–

many a skillful thing.

### Verse 53

53
No flower’s scent

goes against the wind–

not sandalwood,

jasmine,

tagara.

But the scent of the good

does go against the wind.

The person of integrity

wafts a scent

in every direction.

Sandalwood, tagara,

lotus, & jasmine:

among these scents,

the scent of virtue

is unsurpassed.

Next to nothing, this scent

–sandalwood, tagara–

while the scent of virtuous conduct

wafts to the devas,

supreme.

### Verse 54-56

54-56
Those consummate in virtue,

dwelling

in heedfulness,

released

through right knowing:

Mara can’t follow their tracks.

### Verse 57

57
As in a pile of rubbish

cast by the side of a highway

a lotus might grow

clean-smelling

pleasing the heart,

so in the midst of the rubbish-like,
