_beyond-&-not-beyond_

can’t be found;

unshackled, carefree:

Sitting silent, dustless,

absorbed in jhana,

his task done, effluents gone,

ultimate goal attained:

he’s what I call

a brahman.

### Verse 386

386
By day shines the sun;

by night, the moon;

in armor, the warrior;

in jhana, the brahman.

But all day & all night,

every day & every night,

the Awakened One shines

in splendor.

### Verse 387

He’s called a brahman

for having banished his evil,

for living in consonance,

one gone forth

for having forsaken

his own impurities.

### Verse 388

388
One should not strike a brahman,

nor should the brahman

Shame on a brahman’s killer.

More shame on the brahman

### Verse 389

389
Nothing’s better for the brahman

The person from whom

you should honor him with respect–

as a brahman, the flame for a sacrifice.

### Verse 392

392
Not by matted hair,

by clan, or by birth,

is one a brahman.

Whoever has truth

& rectitude:

he is a pure one,

he, a brahman.

What’s the use of your matted hair,

you dullard?

What’s the use of your deerskin cloak?

The tangle’s inside you.

You comb the outside.

I don’t call one a brahman

for being born of a mother
