## Chapter 15

How very happily we live,

we who have nothing.

We will feed on rapture

like the Radiant gods.

### Verse 197-200

197-200
Winning gives birth to hostility.

Losing, one lies down in pain.

The calmed lie down with ease,

having set

winning & losing

aside.

### Verse 201

201
There’s no fire like passion,

no loss like anger,

no pain like the aggregates,

no ease other than peace.

Hunger: the foremost illness.

Fabrications: the foremost pain.

For one knowing this truth

as it has come to be,

Unbinding

is the foremost ease.

Freedom from illness: the foremost good fortune.

Contentment: the foremost wealth.

Trust: the foremost kinship.

Unbinding: the foremost ease.

### Verse 202-204

202-204
Drinking the nourishment,

the flavor,

of seclusion & calm,

one is freed from evil, devoid

of distress,

refreshed with the nourishment

of rapture in the Dhamma.

### Verse 205

205
It’s good to see Noble Ones.

Happy their company–always.

Through not seeing fools

constantly, constantly

one would be happy.

For, living with a fool,

one grieves a long time.

Painful is communion with fools,

as with an enemy–

always.

Happy is communion

with the enlightened,

as with a gathering of kin.

So:

the enlightened man–

discerning, learned,

enduring, dutiful, noble,

intelligent, a man of integrity:
