## Chapter 25

delighting in what is inward,

content, centered, alone:

he’s what they call

a monk.

### Verse 362

362
A monk restrained in his speaking,

giving counsel unruffled,

declaring the message & meaning:

sweet is his speech.

### Verse 363

363
Dhamma his dwelling,

Dhamma his delight,

a monk pondering Dhamma,

calling Dhamma to mind,

does not fall away

from true Dhamma.

### Verse 364

364
Gains:

don’t treat your own with scorn,

don’t go coveting those of others.

A monk who covets those of others

attains

no concentration.

Even if he gets next to nothing,

he doesn’t treat his gains with scorn.

Living purely, untiring:

he’s the one

that the devas praise.

### Verse 365-366

365-366
For whom, in name & form

in every way,

there’s no sense of mine,

& who doesn’t grieve

for what’s not:

he’s deservedly called

a monk.

### Verse 367

367
Dwelling in goodwill, a monk

with faith in the Awakened One’s teaching,

would attain the good state,

the peaceful state:

stilling-of-fabrications ease.

### Verse 368

368
Monk, bail out this boat.

It will take you lightly when bailed.

Having cut through passion, aversion,

you go from there to Unbinding.

### Verse 369

369
Cut through five,

let go of five,

& develop five above all.

A monk gone past five attachments

is said to have crossed the flood.

### Verse 370

370
Practice jhana, monk,

and don’t be heedless.

Don’t take your mind roaming

in sensual strands.

Don’t swallow–heedless–

the ball of iron aflame.

Don’t burn & complain: ‘This is pain.’

### Verse 371

371
There’s

no jhana

for one with

no discernment,

no discernment

for one with

no jhana.

But one with

both jhana

& discernment:

he’s on the verge

of Unbinding.

### Verse 372

372
A monk with his mind at peace,

going into an empty dwelling,

clearly seeing the Dhamma aright:

his delight is more

than human.

However it is,

however it is he touches

the arising-&-passing of aggregates:

he gains rapture & joy:

that, for those who know it,

is deathless,

the Deathless.

### Verse 373-374

373-374
Here the first things

for a discerning monk

are

guarding the senses,

contentment,

restraint in line with the Patimokkha.

He should associate with admirable friends.

Living purely, untiring,

hospitable by habit,

skilled in his conduct,

gaining a manifold joy,

he will put an end

to suffering & stress.

### Verse 375-376

375-376
Shed passion

& aversion, monks–

as a jasmine would,

its withered flowers.

### Verse 377

377
Calmed in body,

calmed in speech,

well-centered & calm,

having disgorged the baits of the world,

a monk is called

thoroughly

calmed.

### Verse 378

378
You yourself

should reprove yourself,

should examine yourself.

As a self-guarded monk

with guarded self,

mindful, you dwell at ease.

### Verse 379

379
Your own self is

your own mainstay.

Your own self is

your own guide.

Therefore you should

watch over yourself–

as a trader, a fine steed.

### Verse 380

380
A monk with a manifold joy,

with faith in the Awakened One’s teaching,

would attain the good state,

the peaceful state:

stilling-of-fabrications ease.

### Verse 381

381
