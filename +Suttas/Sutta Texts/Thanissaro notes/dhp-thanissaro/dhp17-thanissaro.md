## Chapter 17

# Dhp XVII : Anger

Abandon anger,

be done with conceit,

get beyond every fetter.

When for name & form

you have no attachment

–have nothing at all–

no sufferings, no stresses, invade.

### Verse 221

221
When anger arises,

whoever keeps firm control

as if with a racing chariot:

him

I call a master charioteer.

Anyone else,

a rein-holder–

that’s all.

### Verse 222

222
Conquer anger

with lack of anger;

bad with good;

stinginess with a gift;

a liar with truth.

### Verse 223

223
By telling the truth;

by not growing angry;

by giving, when asked,

no matter how little you have:

by these three things

you enter the presence of devas.

### Verse 224

224
Gentle sages,

constantly restrained in body,

go to the unwavering state

where, having gone,

there’s no grief.

### Verse 225

225
Those who always stay wakeful,

training by day & by night,

keen on Unbinding:

their effluents come to an end.

### Verse 226

226
This has come down from old, Atula,

& not just from today:

they find fault with one

who sits silent,

they find fault with one

who speaks a great deal,

they find fault with one

who measures his words.

There’s no one unfaulted in the world.

There never was,

will be,

nor at present is found

anyone entirely faulted

or entirely praised.

### Verse 227-228

227-228
If knowledgeable people praise him,

having observed him

day after day

to be blameless in conduct, intelligent,

endowed with discernment & virtue:

like an ingot of gold–

who’s fit to find fault with him?

Even devas praise him.

Even by Brahma he’s praised.

### Verse 229-230

229-230
Guard against anger

erupting in body;

in body, be restrained.

Having abandoned bodily misconduct,

live conducting yourself well

in body.

Guard against anger

erupting in speech;

in speech, be restrained.

Having abandoned verbal misconduct,

live conducting yourself well

in speech.

Guard against anger

erupting in mind;

in mind, be restrained.

Having abandoned mental misconduct,

live conducting yourself well

in mind.

Those restrained in body

–the enlightened–

restrained in speech & in mind

–enlightened–

are the ones whose restraint is secure.

### Verse 231-234

231-234
