## Chapter 3

# Dhp III : The Mind

Quivering, wavering,

hard to guard,

to hold in check:

the mind.

The sage makes it straight–

like a fletcher,

the shaft of an arrow.

Like a fish

pulled from its home in the water

& thrown on land:

this mind flips & flaps about

to escape Mara’s sway.

Hard to hold down,

nimble,

alighting wherever it likes:

the mind.

Its taming is good.

The mind well-tamed

brings ease.

So hard to see,

so very, very subtle,

alighting wherever it likes:

the mind.

The wise should guard it.

The mind protected

brings ease.

Wandering far,

going alone,

bodiless,

lying in a cave:

the mind.

Those who restrain it:

from Mara’s bonds

they’ll be freed.

### Verse 33-37

33-37
For a person of unsteady mind,

not knowing true Dhamma,

serenity

set                adrift:

discernment doesn’t grow full.

### Verse 38

38
For a person of unsoddened mind,

unassaulted awareness,

abandoning merit & evil,

wakeful,

there is

no danger

no fear.

### Verse 39

39
Knowing this body

is like a clay jar,

securing this mind

like a fort,

attack Mara

with the spear of discernment,

then guard what’s won

without settling there,

without laying claim.

### Verse 40

40
All too soon, this body

will lie on the ground

cast off,

bereft of consciousness,

like a useless scrap

of wood.

### Verse 41

41
Whatever an enemy might do

to an enemy,

or a foe to a foe,

the ill-directed mind

can do to you

even worse.

Whatever a mother, father

or other kinsman

might do for you,

the well-directed mind

can do for you

even better.

### Verse 42-43

42-43
