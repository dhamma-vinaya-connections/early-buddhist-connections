## Chapter 20

you put an end

to suffering & stress.

I have taught you this path

having known

–for your knowing–

the extraction of arrows.

It’s for you to strive

ardently.

Tathagatas simply

point out the way.

Those who practice,

absorbed in jhana:

from Mara’s bonds

they’ll be freed.

### Verse 274-276

274-276
When you see with discernment,

_‘All fabrications are inconstant’_–

you grow disenchanted with stress.

This is the path

to purity.

When you see with discernment,

_‘All fabrications are stressful’_–

you grow disenchanted with stress.

This is the path

to purity.

When you see with discernment,

_‘All phenomena are not-self’_–

you grow disenchanted with stress.

This is the path

to purity.

### Verse 277-279

277-279
At the time for initiative

he takes no initiative.

Young, strong, but lethargic,

the resolves of his heart

exhausted,

the lazy, lethargic one

loses the path

to discernment.

### Verse 280

280
Guarded

in speech,

well-restrained

in mind,

you should do nothing unskillful

in body.

Purify

these three courses of action.

Bring to fruition

the path that seers have proclaimed.

### Verse 281

281
From striving comes wisdom;

from not, wisdom’s end.

Knowing these two courses

–to

development,

decline–

conduct yourself

so that wisdom will grow.

### Verse 282

282
Cut down

the forest of desire,

not the forest of trees.

From the forest of desire

come danger & fear.

Having cut down this forest

& its underbrush, monks,

be deforested.

For as long as the least

bit of underbrush

of a man for women

is not cleared away,

the heart is fixated

like a suckling calf

on its mother.

Crush

your sense of self-allure

like an autumn lily

in the hand.

Nurture only the path to peace

–Unbinding–

as taught by the One Well Gone.

### Verse 283-285

283-285
‘Here I’ll stay for the rains.

Here, for the summer & winter.’

So imagines the fool,

unaware of obstructions.

That drunk-on-his-sons-&-cattle man,

all tangled up in the mind:

death sweeps him away–

as a great flood,

a village asleep.

There are

no sons

to give shelter,

no father,

no family

for one seized by the Ender,

no shelter among kin.

Realizing

this force of reasoning,
