## Chapter 9

# Dhp IX : Evil

Be quick in doing

what’s admirable.

Restrain your mind

from what’s evil.

When you’re slow

in making merit,

evil delights the mind.

### Verse 116

116
If a person does evil,

he shouldn’t do it again & again,

shouldn’t develop a penchant for it.

To accumulate evil

brings pain.

If a person makes merit,

he should do it again & again,

should develop a penchant for it.

To accumulate merit

brings ease.

### Verse 117-118

117-118
Even the evil

meet with good fortune

as long as their evil

has yet to mature.

But when it’s matured

that’s when they meet

with evil.

Even the good

meet with bad fortune

as long as their good

has yet to mature.

But when it’s matured

that’s when they meet

with good fortune.

### Verse 119-120

119-120
Don’t underestimate evil

(‘It won’t amount to much’).

A water jar fills,

even with water

falling     in     drops.

With evil–even if

bit

by

bit,

habitually–

the fool fills himself full.

Don’t underestimate merit

(‘It won’t amount to much’).

A water jar fills,

even with water

falling     in     drops.

With merit–even if

bit

by

bit,

habitually–

the enlightened one fills himself full.

### Verse 121-122

121-122
Like a merchant with a small

but well-laden caravan

–a dangerous road,

like a person who loves life

–a poison,

one should avoid

–evil deeds.

### Verse 123

123
If there’s no wound on the hand,

that hand can hold poison.

Poison won’t penetrate

where there’s no wound.

There’s no evil

for those who don’t do it.

### Verse 124

124
Whoever harasses

an innocent man,

a man pure, without blemish:

the evil comes right back to the fool

like fine dust

thrown against the wind.

### Verse 125

125
Some are born

in the human womb,

evildoers

in hell,

those on the good course go

to heaven,

while those without effluent:

totally unbound.

### Verse 126

126
Not up in the air,

nor in the middle of the sea,

nor going into a cleft in the mountains

–nowhere on earth–

is a spot to be found

where you could stay & escape

your evil deed.

Not up in the air,

nor in the middle of the sea,

nor going into a cleft in the mountains

–nowhere on earth–

is a spot to be found

where you could stay & not succumb

to death.

### Verse 127-128

127-128
