## Chapter 12

# Dhp XII : Self

If you hold yourself dear

then guard, guard yourself well.

The wise person would stay awake

nursing himself

in any of the three watches of the night,

the three stages of life.

### Verse 157

157
First

he’d settle himself

in what is correct,

only then

teach others.

He wouldn’t stain his name

: he is wise.

### Verse 158

158
If you’d mold yourself

the way you teach others,

then, well-trained,

go ahead & tame–

for, as they say,

what’s hard to tame is you

yourself.

### Verse 159

159
Your own self is

your own mainstay,

for who else could your mainstay be?

With you yourself well-trained

you obtain the mainstay

hard to obtain.

### Verse 160

160
The evil he himself has done

–self-born, self-created–

grinds down the dullard,

as a diamond, a precious stone.

### Verse 161

161
When overspread by extreme vice–

like a sal tree by a vine–

you do to yourself

what an enemy would wish.

### Verse 162

162
They’re easy to do–

things of no good

& no use to yourself.

What’s truly useful & good

is truly harder than hard to do.

### Verse 163

163
The teaching of those who live the Dhamma,

worthy ones, noble:

whoever maligns it

–a dullard,

inspired by evil view–

bears fruit for his own destruction,

like the fruiting of the bamboo.

### Verse 164

164
Evil is done

by oneself,

by oneself is one defiled.

Evil is left undone

by oneself,

by oneself is one cleansed.

Purity & impurity are one’s own doing.

No one purifies another.

No other purifies one.

### Verse 165

165
Don’t sacrifice your own welfare

for that of another,

no matter how great.

Realizing your own true welfare,

be intent on just that.

### Verse 166

166
