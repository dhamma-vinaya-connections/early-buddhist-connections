# Dhp II : Heedfulness

Heedfulness:

the path to the Deathless.

Heedlessness:

the path to death.

The heedful do not die.

The heedless are as if

already dead.

Knowing this as a true distinction,

those wise

in heedfulness

rejoice

in heedfulness,

enjoying the range of the noble ones.

The enlightened, constantly

absorbed in jhana,

persevering,

firm in their effort:

they touch Unbinding,

the unexcelled rest

from the yoke.

Those with initiative,

mindful,

clean in action,

acting with due consideration,

heedful, restrained,

living the Dhamma:

their glory

grows.

### Verse 21-24

21-24
Through initiative, heedfulness,

restraint, & self-control,

the wise would make

an island

no flood

can submerge.

### Verse 25

25
They’re addicted to heedlessness

–dullards, fools–

while one who is wise

cherishes heedfulness

as his highest wealth.

### Verse 26

26
Don’t give way to heedlessness

or to intimacy

with sensual delight–

for a heedful person,

absorbed in jhana,

attains an abundance of ease.

### Verse 27

27
When the wise person drives out

heedlessness

with heedfulness,

having climbed the high tower

of discernment,

sorrow-free,

he observes the sorrowing crowd–

as the enlightened man,

having scaled

a summit,

the fools on the ground below.

### Verse 28

28
Heedful among the heedless,

wakeful among those asleep,

just as a fast horse advances,

leaving the weak behind:

so the wise.

### Verse 29

29
Through heedfulness, Indra won

to lordship over the devas.

Heedfulness is praised,

heedlessness censured–

always.

### Verse 30

30
The monk delighting in heedfulness,

seeing danger in heedlessness,

advances like a fire,

burning fetters

great & small.

The monk delighting in heedfulness,

seeing danger in heedlessness

–incapable of falling back–

stands right on the verge

of Unbinding.

### Verse 31-32

31-32
