## Chapter 14

# Dhp XIV : Awakened

Whose conquest can’t be undone,

whose conquest no one in the world

can reach;

awakened, his pasture endless,

pathless:

by what path will you lead him astray?

In whom there’s no craving

–the sticky ensnarer–

to lead him anywherever at all;

awakened, his pasture endless,

pathless:

by what path will you lead him astray?

### Verse 179-180

179-180
They, the enlightened, intent on jhana,

delighting in stilling

& renunciation,

self-awakened & mindful:

even the devas

view them with envy.

### Verse 181

181
Hard   the winning of a human birth.

Hard   the life of mortals.

Hard   the chance to hear the true Dhamma.

Hard   the arising of Awakened Ones.

### Verse 182

182
The non-doing

of any evil,

the performance

of what’s skillful,

the cleansing

of one’s own mind:

this is the teaching

of the Awakened.

Patient endurance:

the foremost austerity.

Unbinding:

the foremost,

so say the Awakened.

He who injures another

is no contemplative.

He who mistreats another,

no monk.

Not disparaging, not injuring,

restraint

in line with the Patimokkha,

moderation

in food,

dwelling in                  seclusion,

commitment to the heightened mind:

this is the teaching

of the Awakened.

### Verse 183-185

183-185
Not even if it rained gold coins

would we have our fill

of sensual pleasures.

‘Stressful,

they give little enjoyment’–

knowing this, the wise one

finds no delight

even in heavenly sensual pleasures.

He is

one who delights

in the ending of craving,

a disciple of the Rightly

Self-Awakened One.

### Verse 186-187

186-187
They go to many a refuge,

to mountains & forests,

to park & tree shrines:

people threatened with danger.

That’s not the secure refuge,

not the supreme refuge,

that’s not the refuge,

having gone to which,

you gain release

from all suffering & stress.

But when, having gone

to the Buddha, Dhamma,

& Sangha for refuge,

you see with right discernment

the four noble truths–

stress,

the cause of stress,

the transcending of stress,

& the noble eightfold path,

the way to the stilling of stress:

that’s the secure refuge,

that, the supreme refuge,

that is the refuge,

having gone to which,

you gain release

from all suffering & stress.

### Verse 188-192

188-192
It’s hard to come by

a thoroughbred of a man.

It’s simply not true

that he’s born everywhere.

Wherever he’s born, an enlightened one,

the family prospers,

is happy.

### Verse 193

193
A blessing:      the arising of Awakened Ones.

A blessing:      the teaching of true Dhamma.

A blessing:      the concord of the Sangha.

The austerity of those in concord

is a blessing.

### Verse 194

194
If you worship those worthy of worship,

–Awakened Ones or their disciples–

who’ve transcended

objectification,

crossed over

lamentation

& grief,

who are unendangered,

fearless,

unbound:

there’s no measure for reckoning

that your merit’s ‘this much.’

### Verse 195-196

195-196
