## Chapter 8

brings peace.

And better than chanting hundreds

of meaningless verses is

one

Dhamma-saying

that on hearing

brings peace.

### Verse 100-102

100-102
Greater in battle

than the man who would conquer

a thousand-thousand men,

is he who would conquer

just one–

himself.

Better to conquer yourself

than others.

When you’ve trained yourself,

living in constant self-control,

neither a deva nor gandhabba,

nor a Mara banded with Brahmas,

could turn that triumph

back into defeat.

### Verse 103-105

103-105
You could, month by month,

at a cost of thousands,

conduct sacrifices

a hundred times,

or

pay a single moment’s homage

to one person,

self-cultivated.

Better than a hundred years of sacrifices

would that act of homage be.

You could, for a hundred years,

live in a forest

tending a fire,

or

pay a single moment’s homage

to one person,

self-cultivated.

Better than a hundred years of sacrifices

would that act of homage be.

Everything offered

or sacrificed in the world

for an entire year by one seeking merit

doesn’t come to a fourth.

Better to pay respect

to those who’ve gone

the straight way.

### Verse 106-108

106-108
If you’re respectful by habit,

constantly honoring the worthy,

four things increase:

long life, beauty,

happiness, strength.

### Verse 109

109
Better than a hundred years

lived without virtue, uncentered, is

one day

lived by a virtuous person

absorbed in jhana.

And better than a hundred years

lived undiscerning, uncentered, is

one day

lived by a discerning person

absorbed in jhana.

And better than a hundred years

lived apathetic & unenergetic, is

one day

lived energetic & firm.

And better than a hundred years

lived without seeing

arising & passing away, is

one day

lived seeing

arising & passing away.

And better than a hundred years

lived without seeing

the Deathless state, is

one day

lived seeing

the Deathless state.

And better than a hundred years

lived without seeing
