## Chapter 13

### Verse 168-169

168-169
See it as a bubble,

see it as a mirage:

one who regards the world this way

the King of Death doesn’t see.

### Verse 170

170
Come look at this world

all decked out

like a royal chariot,

where fools plunge in,

while those who know

don’t cling.

### Verse 171

171
Who once was heedless,

but later is not,

brightens the world

like the moon set free from a cloud.

His evil-done deed

is replaced with skillfulness:

he brightens the world

like the moon set free from a cloud.

### Verse 172-173

172-173
Blinded this world–

how few here see clearly!

Just as birds who’ve escaped

from a net are

few, few

are the people

who make it to heaven.

### Verse 174

174
Swans fly the path of the sun;

those with the power fly through space;

the enlightened flee from the world,

having defeated the armies of Mara.

### Verse 175

175
The person who tells a lie,

who transgresses in this one thing,

transcending concern for the world beyond:

there’s no evil

he might not do.

### Verse 176

176
No misers go

to the world of the devas.

Those who don’t praise giving

are fools.

The enlightened

express their approval for giving

and so find ease

in the world beyond.

### Verse 177

177
Sole dominion over the earth,
