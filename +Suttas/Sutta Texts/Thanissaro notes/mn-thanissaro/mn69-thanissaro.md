## MN69 About Golissāni

## ## Golissāni Sutta


I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Forest, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. And on that occasion a monk named Golissāni,[1](#^mn69note01) a wilderness-dweller of crude behavior, had entered into the midst of the Saṅgha on some business or other. ^mn69note01-ref

Then Ven. Sāriputta, with reference to the monk named Golissāni, addressed the monks: “Friends, when a wilderness-dwelling monk has come into the Saṅgha and is living in the Saṅgha, it should be with respect and with deference toward his fellows in the holy life. If a wilderness-dwelling monk, coming into the Saṅgha and living in the Saṅgha, is not respectful or deferential toward his fellows in the holy life, there are those who would say of him, ‘What good has it done for this venerable wilderness-dweller to be alone in the wilderness, living independently, when he is not respectful or deferential toward his fellows in the holy life?’ Because there are those who would say that of him, when a wilderness-dwelling monk has come into the Saṅgha and is living in the Saṅgha, it should be with respect and with deference toward his fellows in the holy life.

### Notes

1. This spelling follows the Thai edition. Other editions spell his name Gulissāni. [↩︎](#^mn69note01-ref) ^mn69note01

2. This is one of the protocols to be followed in the meal hall. See Cv 8:4.3 [↩︎](#^mn69note02-ref) ^mn69note02

3. says: “Should any bhikkhu, being invited for a meal and without taking leave of an available bhikkhu, go calling on families before or after the meal, except at the proper occasions, it is to be confessed. Here the proper occasions are these: a time of giving cloth, a time of making robes. These are the proper occasions here.” [↩︎](#^mn69note03-ref) ^mn69note03

4. These are the formless levels of concentration, beginning with the dimension of the infinitude of space. The Commentary says that all eight levels of concentration attainment are included here, including the four jhānas, but the injunction for the monk to have concentration, mentioned above, would already appear to cover the four jhānas. [↩︎](#^mn69note04-ref) ^mn69note04

5. This covers all of the transcendent attainments. [↩︎](#^mn69note05-ref) ^mn69note05
