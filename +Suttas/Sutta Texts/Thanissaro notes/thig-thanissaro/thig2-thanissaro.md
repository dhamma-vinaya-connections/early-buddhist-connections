## Thig2.3  Sumaṅgala’s Mother

So freed! So freed!

So thoroughly freed am I—

from my pestle,

my shameless husband

& his sun-shade making,

my moldy old pot

with its water-snake smell.

Aversion & passion

I cut with a _chop._

Having come to the foot of a tree,

I do jhāna, from the bliss thinking:

“What bliss!”

## Thig2.4  Aḍḍhkāsī

All of the Kāsi countryside:

My fee was equal to that.

Having made that my price,

the town[1](#^thig2-4note01) set me as priceless in price. ^thig2-4note01-ref

But then I became disenchanted with my body,

and—disenchanted—dispassionate:

“May I not run again & again

through birth & the wandering-on.”

The three knowledges

have been realized.

The Buddha’s bidding

done.

Note

1. Reading _nigamo_ with the Thai edition. The Burmese and Sinhalese editions read _negamo,_ “the townspeople.”

> **Edition Notice**  
Bhikkhu Thanissaro’s translations are arranged according to the Thai Tipitaka edition. Therefore, some sutta references may not align with the 6th Council or Suttacentral.net numbering schemes, especially in the Saṁyutta Nikāya (SN) and Aṅguttara Nikāya (AN).
