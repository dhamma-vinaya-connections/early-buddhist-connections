## Thig7.2  Cālā

_In [[sn5.8-thanissaro]], verses similar to these are attributed to the nun Sīsūpacālā._

Cālā:

Having established mindfulness,

a nun with developed faculties,[1](#^thig7-2note01) I ^thig7-2note01-ref

penetrated the peaceful state:

stilling-of-fabrications bliss.[2](#^thig7-2note02) ^thig7-2note02-ref

Māra:

“For whose sake

have you shaved your head?

You look like a contemplative

but don’t approve of a philosophy,

so why are you wandering here

confused?”

Cālā:

“Outside philosophers place

their confidence in views.

They don’t know the Dhamma.[3](#^thig7-2note03) ^thig7-2note03-ref

They’re not adept in the Dhamma.

But there is

the Awakened One,

born in the Sakyan clan,

a person without peer.[4](#^thig7-2note04) ^thig7-2note04-ref

He taught me the Dhamma

for the transcending of views:

stress,

the co-arising of stress,

the overcoming of stress,

& the noble eightfold path

leading to the stilling of stress.[5](#^thig7-2note05) ^thig7-2note05-ref

Having heard his words,

I dwell, delighting

in his bidding.

The three knowledges

are attained;

the Buddha’s bidding,

done.

Everywhere enjoyment

is defeated;

the mass of darkness,

burst.

So know,     Evil One,

that you have been,

End-maker,

struck down.

3. In [[sn5.8-thanissaro]], this line reads, “I don’t approve of their teaching.” [↩︎](#^thig7-2note03-ref) ^thig7-2note03

4. This is the last line that this poem has in common with [[sn5.8-thanissaro]]. The remainder of [[sn5.8-thanissaro]] reads: [↩︎](#^thig7-2note04-ref) ^thig7-2note04

all-conquering,

Māra’s subduer,

everywhere undefeated,

everywhere freed, independent;

endowed with an Eye

all-seeing, reaching the end of

all kamma—

with the ending of acquisitions,

released.

He, that Blessed One,

is my teacher.

It’s in his Dhamma

that I delight.

## Thig7.3  Upacālā

_In [[sn5.6-thanissaro]], verses similar to these are attributed to the nun Cālā._

Upacālā:

Having mindfulness, having an eye that sees,

a nun with developed faculties, I

penetrated the peaceful state

of which worthless people

don’t partake.[1](#^thig7-3note01) ^thig7-3note01-ref

Māra:

Why don’t you approve of birth?

One who is born

enjoys sensual pleasures.

Enjoy sensual delight!

Don’t later burn with regret.

Upacālā:

For one who is born

there’s death,[2](#^thig7-3note02) ^thig7-3note02-ref

the cutting-off of hands & feet,

binding, flogging, torment.

One who’s born incurs pain.

But there is

the Rightly Awakened One,

the undefeated one,

born in the Sakyan clan.

He taught me the Dhamma

for the transcending of birth:

stress,

the co-arising of stress,

the overcoming of stress,

& the noble eightfold path

leading to the stilling of stress.

Having heard his words,

I dwell, delighting

in his bidding.

The three knowledges

are attained;

the Buddha’s bidding,

done.

Everywhere enjoyment

is defeated;

the mass of darkness,

burst.

So know,     Evil One,

that you have been,

End-maker,

struck down.

### Notes

1. This stanza does not occur in [[sn5.6-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^thig7-3note01-ref) ^thig7-3note01

2. This is the last line that this poem has in common with [[sn5.6-thanissaro]]. The remainder of [[sn5.6-thanissaro]] reads: [↩︎](#^thig7-3note02-ref) ^thig7-3note02

One who is born

sees pain.

It’s a binding, a flogging, a torment.

That’s why one shouldn’t approve

of birth.

The Awakened One taught me the Dhamma

—the overcoming of birth—

for the abandoning of all pain,

he established me in

the truth.

But beings who have come to form

& those with a share in the formless,

if they don’t discern cessation,

return to becoming-again.
