## Thig 8  Sīsūpacālā

_In [[sn5.7-thanissaro]], verses similar to these are attributed to the nun Upacālā._

Sīsūpacālā:

A nun, consummate in virtue,

her faculties well-restrained,

will reach the state of peace,

a nourishment

that never cloys.[1](#^thig8note01) ^thig8note01-ref

Māra:

The Devas of the Thirty-three,

the Hours, the Contented,

devas who delight in creation,

& devas in control:

Direct your mind there

where you lived before.[2](#^thig8note02) ^thig8note02-ref

Sīsūpacālā:

The Devas of the Thirty-three,

the Hours, the Contented,

devas who delight in creation,

& devas in control:

Time & again,

from becoming to becoming,

surrounded by self-identity,

not having gone beyond self-identity,

they flow to birth & death.[3](#^thig8note03) ^thig8note03-ref

The whole world is     burning.

The whole world is     aflame.

The whole world is     blazing.

The whole world is     shaken.[4](#^thig8note04) ^thig8note04-ref

The unshaken, incomparable

—the Dhamma the Buddha taught to me,

of which people run-of-the-mill

don’t partake—

that’s where my heart

truly delights.

Having heard his words,

I dwell, delighting

in his bidding.

The three knowledges

are attained;

the Buddha’s bidding,

done.

Everywhere enjoyment

is defeated;

the mass of darkness,

burst.

So know,     Evil One,

that you have been,

End-maker,

struck down.
