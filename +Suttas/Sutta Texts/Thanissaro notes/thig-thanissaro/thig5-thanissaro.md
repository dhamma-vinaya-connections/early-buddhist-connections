## Thig5.10  Paṭācārā

[I thought:]

“Plowing the field with plows,

sowing the ground with seed,

supporting their wives & children,

young men gather up wealth.

So why is it that I,

consummate in virtue,

a doer of the teacher’s bidding,

don’t gain unbinding?

I’m not lazy or proud.”

Washing my feet, I noticed

the

water.

And in watching it flow from high

to

low,

my heart was composed

like a fine thoroughbred steed.

Then taking a lamp, I entered the hut,

checked the bedding,

sat down on the bed.

And taking a pin, I pulled out the wick:

Like the flame’s[1](#^thig5-10note01) unbinding ^thig5-10note01-ref

was the liberation

of awareness.

## Thig5.11  Paṭācārā’s Thirty Students

[Paṭācārā taught:]

“Taking the pestle,

young men grind the corn.

Supporting their wives & children,

they gather up wealth.

Do the Awakened One’s bidding,

which, having done,

you’ll have no regret.

Intent on tranquility of awareness,

do the Awakened One’s bidding.

Quickly:

Having washed your feet,

go sit to one side.”

Hearing these words,

Paṭācārā’s bidding,

they washed their feet

and retired to one side.

Intent on tranquility of awareness,

they did the Awakened One’s bidding.

In the first watch of the night,

they recollected their previous lives.

In the middle watch,

purified the divine eye.

In the last,

burst the mass of darkness.

Getting up, they bowed down to her feet.

“We have done your bidding.

Like the thirty devas honoring Indra,

unvanquished in battle,

we—

endowed with the three knowledges,

effluent-free—

will continue honoring you.”

## Thig5.12  Candā, the Beggar

Before, I had fallen on evil times:

no husband, no children,

no relatives, friends,

no way to obtain clothing & food.

So, taking a staff & bowl in hand,

begging for alms from house to house,

feverish from the cold & heat,

I wandered for seven full years.

Then seeing a nun

obtaining food & drink,

I approached her & said:

“Let me go forth

into homelessness.”

She, Paṭācārā, from sympathy,

let me go forth;

then, exhorting me,

urged me on to the highest goal.

Hearing her words,

I did her bidding.

Her exhortation was not in vain.

Endowed with the three knowledges,

I’m effluent-     free.

## Thig5.2  Vimalā, the Former Courtesan

Intoxicated with my complexion

figure, beauty, & fame;

haughty with youth,

I despised other women.

Adorning this body

embellished to delude foolish men,

I stood at the door to the brothel:

a hunter with snare laid out.

I showed off my ornaments,

and revealed many a private part.

I worked my manifold magic,

laughing out loud at the crowd.

Today, wrapped in a double cloak,

my head shaven,

having wandered for alms,

I sit at the foot of a tree

and attain the state of no-thought.

All ties—human & divine—have been cut.

Having cast off all

effluents,

cooled am I.       Unbound.

## Thig5.4  Nandā’s Vision

“Sick, putrid, unclean:

look, Nandā, at this physical heap.

Through contemplation of the foul,

develop your mind,

make it one, well-centered.

As this [your body], so that.

As that, so this.

It gives off a foul stench,

the delight of fools.”

Considering it thus,

untiring, both day & night,

I, with my own discernment

dissecting it,

saw.

And as I, heedful,

examined it aptly,

_this_ body—as it actually is—

was seen inside & out.

Then was I disenchanted with the body

& dispassionate within:

Heedful, detached,

calmed was I.

Unbound.

## Thig5.6  Mittakālī

Going forth through conviction

from home into homelessness,

I wandered this place & that,

greedy for tribute & gains.

Missing out on the foremost goal,

I pursued a lowly one.

Under the sway of defilements,

I didn’t awaken[1](#^thig5-6note01) to the goal ^thig5-6note01-ref

of the contemplative life.

Then, sitting in my dwelling,

I suddenly came to my senses:

_I’m following a miserable path._

_I’m under the sway of_

_craving._

_Next to nothing, my life,_

_crushed_

_by aging & illness._

_Before the body breaks apart,_

_I have no time_

_for heedlessness._

After watching, as it actually was,

the arising-disbanding of aggregates,

I stood up with mind released,

the Awakened One’s bidding

done.

## Thig5.8  Soṇā, Mother of Ten

Ten children I bore

from this physical heap.

Then weak from that, aged,

I went to a nun.

She taught me the Dhamma:

aggregates, sense media, & properties.

Hearing her Dhamma,

I cut off my hair & ordained.

Having purified the divine eye

while still a trainee,[1](#^thig5-8note01) ^thig5-8note01-ref

I know my previous lives,

where I lived in the past.

I develop the theme-less meditation,

well-focused oneness.

I gain the liberation of immediacy[2](#^thig5-8note02)— ^thig5-8note02-ref

from lack of clinging, unbound.

The five aggregates, comprehended,

stand like a tree with its root cut through.

I spit on wretched     birth[3](#^thig5-8note03) ^thig5-8note03-ref

old age.

There is now no further becoming.

### Notes

1. Sikkhamānā: A candidate for full ordination as a nun first had to undergo a two-year period as a trainee, in which she undertook the ten precepts of a novice and had to observe the first six without break. If she broke any of those six, she had to go back and start the two-year period again. [↩︎](#^thig5-8note01-ref) ^thig5-8note01

2. This is apparently equivalent to the concentration of unmediated knowing, mentioned in [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/snp-thanissaro/snp2/snp2.1-thanissaro]], and the concentration that is the fruit of gnosis, mentioned in [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an9/an9.37-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^thig5-8note02-ref) ^thig5-8note02

3. This line plays with the word jamme, which can mean either “wretched” or “birth.” [↩︎](#^thig5-8note03-ref) ^thig5-8note03
