## Thag4.10  Dhammika

The Dhamma protects

those who live by the Dhamma.

The Dhamma well-practiced

brings bliss.

This—the reward

when the Dhamma’s well-practiced:

One who lives by the Dhamma

doesn’t go to a bad destination.

For Dhamma and non-

don’t bear equal results.

Non-Dhamma leads you to hell;

Dhamma, to a good destination.

So you should engender desire

for acts of Dhamma,

rejoicing

in the One     Well-Gone,

the one      who is Such.

Standing firm in the Dhamma,

of the foremost

One Well-Gone,

his disciples are guided

—enlightened—

to the foremost

refuge supreme.

Burst       is the root of the boil;

the net of craving     uprooted.

He, having ended his wandering-on,

has no stain—

like the moon

on a clear full-moon night.

## Thag4.2  Bhagu

I, overcome with torpor,
left my dwelling.
Stepping up on the walking path,
	I fell on the ground
	right there.
Rubbing my limbs,
I got up on the path again.
Walking back & forth on the path,
I became well-centered within.
Apt attention arose in me,
	the drawbacks appeared,
		disenchantment stood
		at an even keel:

With that, my heart was released.

See the Dhamma’s true rightness!
The three knowledges
have been attained;
the Buddha’s bidding,
	done.

## Thag4.4  Nandaka

A curse on bodies—
full of foul smells,
siding with Māra,
			oozing,
where nine streams are always flowing.

Don’t think much of them,
Don’t offend the Tathāgatas,
who don’t delight even in heaven,
to say nothing of the human realm.

But fools of little intelligence,
with bad advisers,
cloaked in delusion:
Those sorts of people delight there
in the snare that Māra’s thrown down.

Whereas those dispassionate for
	passion,
	aversion,
	ignorance
don’t delight there,
have cut the cord,
			unsnared.

## Thag4.8  Rāhula

In both ways

consummate,[1](#^thag4-8note01) ^thag4-8note01-ref

I’m known as Rāhula

the Fortunate:

because     I’m the son of the Buddha,

because     I’ve the eye that sees Dhammas,

because     my effluents are ended,

because     I’ve no further becoming.

I’m deserving of offerings,

a worthy one

a three-knowledge man,[2](#^thag4-8note02) ^thag4-8note02-ref

one with sight

of the deathless.

Those

blinded       by sensuality

covered       by the net,

veiled       by the veil of craving,

bound       by the Kinsman of the heedless,[3](#^thag4-8note03) ^thag4-8note03-ref

are like fish in the mouth of a trap.

Throwing that sensuality aside,

cutting through Māra’s bond,

pulling out craving, root & all,

cooled am I.

Unbound.

### Notes

1. This phrase can be taken in two ways: (a) consummate in that he has a pure lineage on both his mother’s and his father’s side; and (b) consummate in that he belongs both to a well-born lineage in the worldly sense and, by means of his meditative attainments, to the lineage of the noble ones. See [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an4/an4.28-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^thag4-8note01-ref) ^thag4-8note01

2. One with knowledge of past lives, knowledge of the passing away and rearising of living beings, and knowledge of the ending of mental effluents. See [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/mn-thanissaro/mn4-thanissaro]]. This list is the Buddhist response to the brahmanical claim that a person should be a master of three knowledges. In the brahmanical case, a three-knowledge man knew the three Vedas. The Buddhists claimed that their three knowledges were superior in that they were not mere hearsay, they could be known by men and women of all castes (see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/thig-thanissaro/thig13-thanissaro]]), and they could put an end to suffering. [↩︎](#^thag4-8note02-ref) ^thag4-8note02

3. Māra. [↩︎](#^thag4-8note03-ref) ^thag4-8note03
