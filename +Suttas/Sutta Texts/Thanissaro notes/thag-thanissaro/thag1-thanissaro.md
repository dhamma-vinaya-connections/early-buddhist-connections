## Thag1.1  Subhūti

My hut is roofed, comfortable,

free of drafts;

my mind, well-centered,

released.

I remain ardent.

So, rain-deva.

Go ahead & rain.

## Thag1.10  Puṇṇamāsa

Whoever,

a master of knowing,

contented,[1](#^thag1-10note01) ^thag1-10note01-ref

restrained in mind,

destroys longing for here & beyond,

unsmeared with regard to all dhammas,

would know the arising-&-disbanding

of the world.

Note

1. Reading _santusito_ with the Thai edition. Other editions have _samito_—calmed, appeased—which doesn’t fit the meter.

## Thag1.100  Devasabha

Consummate in the right exertions,

the establishings of mindfulness his range,[1](#^thag1-100note01) ^thag1-100note01-ref

blanketed with the flowers of release,

he will, without effluent, totally unbind.[2](#^thag1-100note02) ^thag1-100note02-ref

### Notes

1. The right exertions are the four aspects of right effort; the establishings of mindfulness, the four aspects of right mindfulness. See [[sn45.8-thanissaro]]. On the image of the establishings of mindfulness as a monk’s proper range, see [[sn47.6-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^thag1-88note01-ref) ^thag1-88note01

2. Formally, this verse is noteworthy in that each of the first three lines is composed of a single long compound. This style, which became common in later Indian literature because it was considered to convey strength, is uncommonly “strong” for a verse in the Pali Canon. For a similar example, see [[dhp39-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^thag1-88note02-ref) ^thag1-88note02

“Effluent” here is a translation of the term āsava, which stands for three tendencies that “flow out” of the mind and lead to the flood of rebirth: sensuality, becoming, and ignorance. The Jains, contemporaries of the Buddha, also used the term “effluent” in their teachings, but the Buddhist use of the term differed from theirs in two important respects. First, for the Buddhists, effluents were mental, whereas for the Jains they were physical: sticky substances that kept what they regarded as the soul attached to the process of transmigration. Second, for the Jains a living person could become freed of the effluents only at his/her final death. Thus a living person could not be effluent-free. For the Buddhists, however, one became effluent-free at the point of total awakening. Thus a living arahant was effluent-free. Many of the speakers in the Theragāthā and Therīgāthā speak of themselves as effluent-free—see, for instance,[[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/thag-thanissaro/thag18-thanissaro]], [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/thig-thanissaro/thig5-thanissaro]], [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/thig-thanissaro/thig14-thanissaro]]—which means that they are employing the concept in its strictly Buddhist sense.

## Thag1.101  Belaṭṭhkāni

Abandoning the householder’s state,

but with no mastery,

lazy, gluttonous,

using his mouth as a plough

like a great hog fattened on fodder:

Again & again

he goes to the womb—

the dullard.

## Thag1.104  Khitaka

How light my body!

Touched by abundant

rapture & bliss,

—like a cotton tuft

borne on the breeze—

it seems to be floating

—my body!

## Thag1.109  Saṅgharakkhita

Why,

having gone into solitude,

does he not take account

of the message

of the one sympathetic

to his foremost well-being?

Because he dwells

with his faculties

exposed,

like a tender deer

in the forest.

## Thag1.110  Usabha

Trees on the hilltops

are flourishing,

watered by a new high-rising cloud,

giving birth to even more goodness

for Usabha—

desiring seclusion,

conscious of

“wilderness.”

See also: [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/mn-thanissaro/mn121-thanissaro]]

## Thag1.111  Jenta

Going forth is hard;

houses are hard places to live;

the Dhamma is deep;

wealth, hard to obtain;

it’s hard to keep going

with whatever we get:

So it’s right that we ponder

continually

continual

inconstancy.

See also: [[dhp302-thanissaro]]

## Thag1.113  Vanavaccha

With clear waters &

massive boulders,

frequented by monkeys &

deer,

covered with moss &

water weeds:

Those rocky crags refresh me.

## Thag1.114  Adhimutta

For one heavy

with bodily offenses,

greedy

for carcass pleasures

while life is wasting away:

From where will there come

contemplative-excellence?

## Thag1.118  Kimbila

As if sent by a curse,[1](#^thag1-118note01) ^thag1-118note01-ref

it drops on us—

aging.

The body seems     other,

though it’s still the same one.

I’m still here

& have never been absent from it,

but I remember myself

as if somebody else’s.

Note

1. Reading _abhisatto_ with the Sinhalese and Burmese editions. The Thai and PTS have _abhisattho,_ “ordered.” [↩︎](#^thag1-88note01-ref) ^thag1-88note01

See also: [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/thig-thanissaro/thig13-thanissaro]]

## Thag1.119  Vajjiputta

Coming to the bower

at the root of a tree,

placing

unbinding

in your heart,

do jhāna, Gotama,

& don’t be heedless.

What use is this

chitter-chatter

to you?[1](#^thag1-119note01) ^thag1-119note01-ref

Note

1. In [[snp9.5-thanissaro]], a deva addresses this verse to Ven. Ānanda, who has been spending too much time teaching Dhamma to laypeople. [↩︎](#^thag1-88note01-ref) ^thag1-88note01

## Thag1.120  Isidatta

The five aggregates,

having been comprehended,

stand with their root

cut through.

For me

the ending of stress

is reached;

the ending of effluents,

attained.

## Thag1.13  Vanavaccha

The color of blue-dark clouds,

glistening,

cooled with the waters

of clear-flowing streams

covered with ladybugs:

Those rocky crags

refresh me.

## Thag1.14  Vanavaccha’s pupil

My preceptor said to me:

_Let’s go from here, Sīvaka._

My body stays in the village;

my mind has gone to the wilds.

Even though lying down,

I go.

There’s no tying down

one who knows.

## Thag1.16  Belaṭṭhasīsa

Just as a fine thoroughbred steed,

with swishing tail & mane

runs with next-to-no effort,

so my days & nights

run with next-to-no effort

now that I’ve gained a pleasure

not of the flesh.[1](#^thag1-16note01) ^thag1-16note01-ref

Note

1. See [[sn36.31-thanissaro]] and [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/thag-thanissaro/thag1-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^thag1-88note01-ref) ^thag1-88note01

## Thag1.18  Siṅgālapitar

There was an heir to the One Awakened,

a monk in the Bhesakaḷā forest,

who suffused this whole earth

with the perception of

“bones.”

Quickly, I’d say, he abandoned

sensual passion.


## Thag1.21  Nigrodha

I’m not afraid

of danger,

of fear.

Our Teacher’s adept

in the deathless.

Where danger, where fear

do not remain:

That’s the path

by which the monks go.

## Thag1.22  Cittaka

Peacocks,

crested, blue, with gorgeous necks,

cry out

in the Kāraṁvī woods,

thrilled by the cold wind.

They awaken the sleeper

to meditate.

## Thag1.23  Gosāla

I—having eaten honey-rice

in a bamboo patch

and rightly grasping the aggregates’[1](#^thag1-23note01) ^thag1-23note01-ref

arising-disbanding—

will return to the hillside, intent

on seclusion.

Note

1. The aggregates of form, feeling, perception, fabrication, and consciousness. See [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/sn-thanissaro/sn22-34-thanissaro/sn22-thanissaro/sn22.48-thanissaro]], [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/sn-thanissaro/sn22-34-thanissaro/sn22-thanissaro/sn22.59-thanissaro]], and [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/sn-thanissaro/sn22-34-thanissaro/sn22-thanissaro/sn22.79-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^thag1-88note01-ref) ^thag1-88note01

## Thag1.25  Nandiya (to Māra)

Like splendor, his mind,

continually fruitful:

Attack a monk like that,

you Dark One,

and you’ll fall

into pain.

See also: SN 5; [[ud4.4-thanissaro]]; [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/snp-thanissaro/snp3/snp3.2-thanissaro]]

## Thag1.26  Abhaya

Hearing the well-spoken words

of the Awakened One,

Kinsman of the Sun,

I pierced what is subtle—

as if, with an arrow,

the tip of a horse-tail hair.

See also: [[sn56.45-thanissaro]]

## Thag1.29  Hārita

Hārita,

raise yourself up-

right

and, straightening your mind

—like a fletcher, an arrow—

shatter ignorance

to bits.

## Thag1.3  Kaṅkhā (Doubting) Revata

See this:

the discernment

of the Tathāgatas,

like a fire ablaze in the night,

giving light, giving eyes,

to those who come,

subduing their doubt.

## Thag1.31  Gahuratīriya

Touched by gnats & mosquitoes,

in the wilds, the great forest,

like a nāga elephant

at the head of a battle,

mindful,

he acquiesces to that.

## Thag1.32  Suppiya

I’ll make a trade:

aging for the ageless,

burning for the unbound—

the highest peace,

the unexcelled rest

from the yoke.

## Thag1.33  Sopāka

Just as one would be good

to one’s dear only child,

one should be good to all creatures

everywhere.[1](#^thag1-33note01) ^thag1-33note01-ref

Note

1. Notice how this image differs from a similar image in [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/snp-thanissaro/snp1/snp1.8-thanissaro]]: [↩︎](#^thag1-88note01-ref) ^thag1-88note01

As a mother would risk her life

to protect her child, her only child,

even so should one cultivate the heart limitlessly

with regard to all beings.

Whereas the image here draws a parallel between being good to one’s child and being good to others, the image in [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/snp-thanissaro/snp1/snp1.8-thanissaro]] draws a parallel between protecting one’s child and protecting one’s limitless attitude of goodwill to all beings.


## Thag1.41  Sirivaḍḍha

Lightning lands on the cleft

between Vebhāra & Paṇḍava,[1](#^thag1-41note01) ^thag1-41note01-ref

but,

having gone to the cleft in the mountains,

he’s absorbed in jhāna[2](#^thag1-41note02)—the son ^thag1-41note02-ref

of the one without compare,

the one who is Such.[3](#^thag1-41note03) ^thag1-41note03-ref

### Notes

1. Mountains near Rājagaha. [↩︎](#^thag1-88note01-ref) ^thag1-88note01

2. Meditative absorption, one of the four levels of intense concentration that constitute right concentration in the noble eightfold path. [↩︎](#^thag1-88note02-ref) ^thag1-88note02

3. Such (tādin): an epithet for an arahant, indicating that his/her attainment is indefinable and not subject to change. [↩︎](#^thag1-41note03-ref) ^thag1-41note03

## Thag1.43  Sumaṅgala

So freed! So freed!

So thoroughly freed am I

from three crooked things:

my sickles, my shovels, my plows.

Even if they were here,

right here,

I’d be done with them,

done.

Do jhāna, Sumaṅgala.

Do jhāna, Sumaṅgala.

Sumaṅgala, stay heedful.

Bhikkhu Thanissaro’s translations are arranged according to the Thai Tipitaka edition. Therefore, some sutta references may not align with the 6th Council or Suttacentral.net numbering schemes, especially in the Saṁyutta Nikāya (SN) and Aṅguttara Nikāya (AN).


## Thag1.50  Vimala

The earth’s sprinkled

with rain, wind

is blowing, lightning

wanders the sky,

but my thoughts are stilled,

well-centered

my mind.

## Thag1.56  Kuṭivihārin (1)

Who’s in the hut?

A monk’s in the hut—

free from passion,

with well-centered mind.

Know this, my friend:

The hut you built

wasn’t wasted.

## Thag1.57  Kuṭivihārin (2)

This was your old hut,

and you aspire to another,

new hut.

Discard your hope for a hut, monk.

A new hut will be

painful all over again.[1](#^thag1-57note01) ^thag1-57note01-ref

Note

1. See Thag2.32. [↩︎](#^thag1-88note01-ref) ^thag1-88note01

## Thag1.6  Dabba (“Capable”)

Whoever,

hard to tame,

has been tamed by taming,

—capable, contented,

crossed over doubt,

victorious, as his fears

are dispersed:

_He_ is capable,

unbound,

steadfast in mind.

## Thag1.61  Vappa

One who sees

sees who sees,

sees who doesn’t.

One who doesn’t see

doesn’t

see who sees

or who doesn’t.


## Thag1.7  Bhalliya

Who scatters the troops

of the King of Death—

as a great flood,

a very weak bridge made of reeds—

is victorious,

for his fears are dispersed.

He’s tamed,

unbound,

steadfast in mind.

## Thag1.73  Māṇava

On seeing an old person;

&

a person in pain, diseased;

&

a person dead, gone to life’s end,

I left

for the life gone forth,

abandoning the sensuality

that entices the heart.

## Thag1.75  Susārada

Good the sight

of the well-rectified:

Doubt is cut off,

intelligence grows.

Even fools

they make wise—

so the company of the true

is good.

## Thag1.84  Nīta

Asleep the whole night,

delighting in company by day:

When, when

will the fool

bring suffering & stress

to an end?

## Thag1.85  Sunāga

Adept in a theme for the mind,

sensing the savor of solitude,

practicing jhāna,

masterful, mindful,

you’d attain a pleasure

not of the flesh.[1](#^thag1-85note01) ^thag1-85note01-ref

Note

1. See [[sn36.31-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^thag1-88note01-ref) ^thag1-88note01

## Thag1.86  Nāgita

Outside of this path,

the path of the many

who teach other things

doesn’t go to unbinding

as does this:

Thus the Blessed One

instructs the Saṅgha,

truly showing the palms of his hands.[1](#^thag1-86note01) ^thag1-86note01-ref

Note

1. This is a reference to the fact that the Buddha was an “open-handed” teacher who did not wait to the end of his life to give his most crucial teachings. See [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/dn-thanissaro/dn16-thanissaro]]. The message of this verse may be related to the fact that the Buddha addressed three of his most plain-speaking suttas to Nāgita: [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an5/an5.30-thanissaro]], [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an6/an6.42-thanissaro]], and [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an8/an8.103-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^thag1-88note01-ref) ^thag1-88note01

## Thag1.88  Ajjuna

Able was I

to raise myself from water

to dry land.[1](#^thag1-88note01) ^thag1-88note01-ref

Swept along by the great flood,

I penetrated

the truths.[2](#^thag1-88note02) ^thag1-88note02-ref

### Notes

1. A standard image for the practice is that of making one’s way across a river from its dangerous near shore to the safety of the further shore. For other uses of this image, see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/sn-thanissaro/sn35-44-thanissaro/sn35-thanissaro/sn35.197-thanissaro]], [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an4/an4.5-thanissaro]], [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an7/an7.15-thanissaro]], and [[sn5-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^thag1-88note01-ref) ^thag1-88note01

2. The four noble truths. [↩︎](#^thag1-88note02-ref) ^thag1-88note02

## Thag1.93  Eraka

Sensual pleasures are stressful,

Eraka.

Sensual pleasures aren’t ease.

Whoever loves sensual pleasures

loves stress,     Eraka.

Whoever doesn’t,

doesn’t love stress.

## Thag1.95  Cakkhupāla

I’m blind,

my eyes are destroyed.

I’ve stumbled

on a wilderness track.

Even

if I must crawl,

I’ll go on,

but not with an evil companion.
