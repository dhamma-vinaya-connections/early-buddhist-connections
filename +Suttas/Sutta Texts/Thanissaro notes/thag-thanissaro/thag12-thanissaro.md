## Thag12.1  Sīlavat

Here master the virtue

that in this world is well-mastered,

for virtue, when cultivated,

brings every consummation near.

Wise, one should protect one’s virtue,

aspiring to three pleasures:

praise, the gaining of wealth,

and—after death—rejoicing in heaven.

The virtuous one, through restraint,

acquires many friends,

while the unvirtuous one, practicing evil,

from friends is estranged.

The unvirtuous person gains

disrepute & dishonor;

the virtuous person, always,

repute, honor, & praise.

Virtue is the beginning, the establishing,

the mother of what is fine,

the foremost of all qualities:

Therefore virtue should be purified.

Virtue is also control, restraint,

the delight of the mind,

the ford of all Buddhas:

Therefore virtue should be purified.

Virtue:     an incomparable strength.

Virtue:     the ultimate weapon.

Virtue:     the highest adornment.

Virtue:     an astounding coat of mail.

Virtue:     an imposing bridge.

Virtue:     an unexcelled fragrance.

Virtue:     the highest fragrant ointment

by which one wafts

this direction & that.

Virtue:     the supreme provision.

Virtue:     the ultimate food for the journey.

Virtue:     the highest vehicle

by which one goes[1](#^thag12-1note01) ^thag12-1note01-ref

this direction & that.

Right here he gains blame,

and after death, in deprivation,

he’s unhappy at heart:

Everywhere the fool

is unhappy at heart,

not concentrated on virtues.

Right here he gains honor

and after death, in heaven,

is happy at heart:

Everywhere the enlightened one

is happy at heart,

well-concentrated on virtues.

Here virtue is supreme,

but one with discernment is the ultimate.

Among human beings & devas

one conquers

through virtue & discernment.

Note

1. Reading _yāti_ with the PTS and Sinhalese editions. The Thai has _vāti_—“wafts”—which seems to be a mistake.

## Thag12.2  Sunīta the Outcaste

Into a lowly family I was born,

poor, with next to no food.

My work was degrading:

I gathered the spoiled,

the withered flowers from shrines

and threw them away.

People found me disgusting,

despised me, disparaged me.

Lowering my heart,

I showed reverence to many.

Then I saw the One Self-awakened,

arrayed with a squadron of monks,

the Great Hero, entering the city,

supreme, of the Magadhans.

Throwing down my carrying pole,

I approached him to do reverence.

He—the supreme man—stood still

out of sympathy

just

for me.

After paying homage

to the feet of the teacher,

I stood to one side

& requested the Going Forth from him,

supreme among all living beings.

The compassionate Teacher,

sympathetic to all the world, said:

“Come, monk.”

That was my formal Acceptance.

Alone, I stayed in the wilds,

untiring,

I followed the Teacher’s words,

just as he, the Conqueror, had taught me.

In the first watch of the night,

I recollected previous lives;

in the middle watch,

purified the divine eye;

in the last,

burst the mass of darkness.

Then, as night was ending

& the sun returning,

Indra & Brahmā came to pay homage to me,

hands palm-to-palm at their hearts:

“Homage to you,

O thoroughbred of men,

Homage to you,

O man supreme,

whose effluents are ended.

You, dear sir,

are worthy of offerings.”

Seeing me,

arrayed with a squadron of devas,

the Teacher smiled & said:

“Through austerity, celibacy,

restraint, & self-control:

That’s how one is a brahman.

He is a brahman supreme.”
