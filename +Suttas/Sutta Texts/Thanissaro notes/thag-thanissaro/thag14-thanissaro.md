## Thag14.1  Revata’s Farewell

Since I went forth

from home into homelessness,

I haven’t known

an ignoble, aversive resolve.

“May these beings

be destroyed,

be slaughtered,

fall into pain”—

I’ve not known this resolve

in this long, long time.

But I have known goodwill,

unlimited,

fully developed,

nurtured step after step,

as taught by the One

Awake:

to all, a friend;

to all, a comrade;

for all beings, sympathetic.[1](#^thag14-1note01) ^thag14-1note01-ref

And I develop a mind of goodwill,

delighting in non-malevolence

—always.

Unvanquished, unshaken,

I gladden the mind.

I develop the sublime abiding,

not frequented by

the lowly.

Attaining no-thinking,

the disciple of the Rightly

Self-awakened One

is endowed with noble silence[2](#^thag14-1note02) ^thag14-1note02-ref

straightaway.

As a mountain of rock

is unmoving,

firmly established,

so a monk,

with the ending of delusion,

like a mountain,

doesn’t quake.

To a person without blemish,

in constant quest of what’s pure,

a hair-tip of evil

seems a storm cloud.

As a frontier fortress is guarded

within & without,

you should safeguard yourselves.

Don’t let the moment

pass you by.

I don’t delight in death,

don’t delight in living.

I await my time

like a worker his wage.

I don’t delight in death,

don’t delight in living.

I await my time,

mindful, alert.

The Teacher has been served by me;

the Awakened One’s bidding,

done;

the heavy load,       laid down;

the guide to becoming,   uprooted.

And the goal for which I went forth

from home life into homelessness

I’ve reached:

the end

of all fetters.

Attain consummation

through heedfulness:

That is my message.

So then, I’m about to

unbind.

I’m released

everywhere.[3](#^thag14-1note03) ^thag14-1note03-ref

### Notes

1. On the development of goodwill as an unlimited attitude, see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/mn-thanissaro/mn21-thanissaro]] and [[sn42.8-thanissaro]]. [↩︎](#^thag14-2note01-ref) ^thag14-2note01

2. Noble silence = the second jhāna. [↩︎](#^thag14-1note02-ref) ^thag14-1note02

3. [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an3/an3.77-thanissaro]] and [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/an-thanissaro/an3/an3.78-thanissaro]] use the analogy of a field to describe becoming, in which kamma is the field, craving the moisture, and consciousness the seed. The logic of the analogy suggests that if consciousness is not watered by craving, and does not land in any place (see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/sn-thanissaro/sn12-21-thanissaro/sn12-thanissaro/sn12.64-thanissaro]]), it is like a seed without moisture or a field. Therefore it will not sprout into further becoming. Poems in the Canon often describe the arahant as being “everywhere released” (sabbattha vimutto—see [[dhp348-thanissaro]]) or “everywhere independent” (sabbattha anissito—see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro no notes/snp-thanissaro/snp4/snp4.6-thanissaro]]), referring indirectly to this analogy. Translators, lacking a sense of the underlying image of the idiom, have tended to render it in more prosaic terms: “completely released in every respect,” “not dependent on anything,” “released from everything.” However, in light of the field analogy, the idiom means precisely what it says: The arahant is released from every possible “where,” whether fabricated or not—every possible spot for renewed becoming.

## Thag14.2  Godatta

Just as a fine, well-bred bull

yoked to a load,

enduring his load,

crushed

by the heavy burden,

doesn’t throw down his yoke;

so, too, those who are filled with discernment

—as the ocean, with water—

don’t look down on others.

This is nobility among beings.

Having fallen in time

under the sway of time,

having come under the sway

of becoming & not-,

people fall subject to pain

& they grieve.

Elated       by causes of pleasure,

cast down     by causes of pain,

fools are destroyed

by both,

not seeing them

for what they are.

While those who, in the midst of

pleasure & pain

have gone past the seamstress—craving—,

stand firm

like a boundary pillar,

neither elated nor cast down.

Not to gain or loss

not to status or honor,

not to praise or blame,

not to pleasure or pain:

Everywhere

they do not adhere—

like a water bead

on a lotus.

Everywhere

they are happy, the enlightened,[1](#^thag14-2note01) ^thag14-2note01-ref

everywhere

un-

defeated.

No matter what

the unrighteous gain

or the righteous loss,

righteous loss is better

than if there were unrighteous gain.

No matter what

the status of the unaware

or the lowliness of those who know,

the lowliness of those who know

is better,

not the status of those

unaware.

No matter what

the praise from fools

or the censure from those who know,

the censure from those who know

is better

than if there were praise

from fools.

And as for the pleasure

from sensuality

and the pain from seclusion,

the pain from seclusion

is better

than if there were pleasure

from sensuality.

And as for living through unrighteousness

and dying for righteousness,

dying for righteousness

is better,

than if one were to live

through unrighteousness.

Those who’ve abandoned

sensuality & anger,

whose minds are calmed

from becoming & non-,

go through the world

unattached.

For them there is nothing

dear or undear.

Developing

the factors for awakening,

faculties,

& strengths,

attaining the foremost peace,

they, without effluent,

totally

unbind.
