## Thag3.13  Abhibhūta

Listen, kinsmen, all of you,

as many as are assembled here.

I will teach you the Dhamma:

Painful is birth,

again & again.

Rouse yourselves.

Go forth.

Apply yourselves

to the Awakened One’s bidding.

Scatter the army of Death

as an elephant would

a shed made of reeds.

He who,

in this Dhamma & Vinaya,

stays heedful,

abandoning birth,

the wandering-on,

will put an end

to suffering & stress.

## Thag3.14  Gotama

While wandering on

I went to hell;

went again & again

to the world of the hungry ghosts;

stayed countless times, long,

in the pain of the animal womb;

enjoyed

the human state;

went to heaven

from time to time;

settled in the elements of form,

the elements of formlessness,

neither perception, perception-less.

Ways of taking birth

are now known:

devoid of essence,

unstable,

conditioned,

always blown along.

Knowing them

as born from my self,

mindful

I went right to peace.

## Thag3.15  Hārita

Whoever wants to do later

what he should have done first,

falls away from the easeful state

& later repents.

One should speak

as one would act,

& not

as one wouldn’t.

When one speaks without acting,

the wise, they can tell.

How very easeful:

unbinding,

as taught by the Rightly

Self-awakened One—

sorrowless,

dustless,

secure,

where stress

& suffering

cease.

## Thag3.5  Mātaṅgaputta

_It’s too cold,_

_too hot,_

_too late in the evening—_

people who say this,

shirking their work:

The moment passes them by.

Whoever regards cold & heat

as no more than grass,

doing his manly duties,

won’t fall away

from ease.

With my chest

I push through wild grasses—

spear-grass,

ribbon-grass,

rushes—

cultivating a heart

bent on seclusion.

## Thag3.8  Yasoja

His limbs knotted

like a kālā plant,

his body lean

& lined with veins,

knowing moderation

in food & drink:

the man of undaunted heart.

Touched by gnats

& horseflies

in the wilds,

the great wood,

like an elephant

at the head of a battle:

He, mindful,

should stay there,

endure.

One alone is like Brahmā,

two, like devas,

three, like a village,

more than that:

a hullabaloo.

## Thag3.9  Satimattiya

Before, you had faith.
Today you don’t.
What is yours
is just for you.
I’ve done nothing wrong.

For I’ve seen that faith is inconstant,
	wavering.
Even they who are passionate
	lose their passion.
Why should a sage waste away over that?

A sage’s meal is cooked
little by little, in this family and that.
I will go for alms.
I have the strength of my legs.
