## SN35.20 Delight (2)

## ## Abhinanda Sutta


“Monks, whoever delights in forms delights in stress. Whoever delights in stress is not released from stress, I tell you.

“Whoever delights in sounds delights in stress…

“Whoever delights in aromas delights in stress…

“Whoever delights in flavors delights in stress…

“Whoever delights in tactile sensations delights in stress…

“Monks, whoever delights in ideas delights in stress. Whoever delights in stress is not released from stress, I tell you.

“Monks, whoever doesn’t delight in forms doesn’t delight in stress. Whoever doesn’t delight in stress is released from stress, I tell you.

“Whoever doesn’t delight in sounds doesn’t delight in stress…

“Whoever doesn’t delight in aromas doesn’t delight in stress…

“Whoever doesn’t delight in flavors doesn’t delight in stress…

“Whoever doesn’t delight in tactile sensations doesn’t delight in stress…

“Monks, whoever doesn’t delight in ideas doesn’t delight in stress. Whoever doesn’t delight in stress is released from stress, I tell you.”
