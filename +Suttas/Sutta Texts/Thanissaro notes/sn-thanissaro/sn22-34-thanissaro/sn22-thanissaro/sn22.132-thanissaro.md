## SN22.132 Origination (2)

## ## Samudaya Sutta


On one occasion Ven. Sāriputta and Ven. Mahā Koṭṭhita were staying near Vārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana. As he was sitting to one side, Ven. Mahā Koṭṭhita said to Ven. Sāriputta, “‘Clear knowing, clear knowing,’ it is said, friend Sāriputta. Which clear knowing? And to what extent is one immersed in clear knowing?”

“There is the case, my friend, where an instructed disciple of the noble ones discerns, as they have come to be, the origination, the disappearance, the allure, the drawbacks of—and the escape from—form.

“He discerns, as they have come to be, the origination, the disappearance, the allure, the drawbacks of—and the escape from—feeling.

“He discerns, as they have come to be, the origination, the disappearance, the allure, the drawbacks of—and the escape from—perception.

“He discerns, as they have come to be, the origination, the disappearance, the allure, the drawbacks of—and the escape from—fabrications.

“He discerns, as they have come to be, the origination, the disappearance, the allure, the drawbacks of—and the escape from—consciousness.

“This, my friend, is called clear knowing, and it’s to this extent that one is immersed in clear knowing.”
