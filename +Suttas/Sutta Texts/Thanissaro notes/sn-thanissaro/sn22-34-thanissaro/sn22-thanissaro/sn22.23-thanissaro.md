## SN22.23 Comprehension

## ## Pariñña Sutta


Near Sāvatthī. “Monks, I will teach you the phenomena to be comprehended, as well as comprehension. Listen & pay close attention. I will speak.”

“As you say, lord,” the monks responded to him.

The Blessed One said, “And which are the phenomena to be comprehended? Form is a phenomenon to be comprehended. Feeling… Perception… Fabrications… Consciousness is a phenomenon to be comprehended. These are called phenomena to be comprehended.

“And which is comprehension? Any ending of passion, ending of aversion, ending of delusion:[1](#sn22.23note01) This is called comprehension.”

Note

1. Comprehension here means the arahant’s full-knowing (see [[Clean Files 3/Thanissaro 2/mn-thani/mn117-thanissaro]]). As [[sn56.11-thanissaro]] shows, the first noble truth of suffering and stress is to be comprehended. As [[sn56.30-thanissaro]] further implies, when the first noble truth has been comprehended, the tasks with regard to all the other noble truths have been completed as well.
