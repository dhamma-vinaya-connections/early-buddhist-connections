## SN1.8 Thoroughly Confused

## ## Susammuṭṭha Sutta


_Like the similar sutta [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/sn-thanissaro/sn1-11-thanissaro/sn1-thanissaro/sn1.7-thanissaro]], this sutta offers evidence in support of the translation, “awakened” for the Pali term,_ Buddha. _The verses draw a direct connection between two words derived from the same root: the adjective_ sambuddha, _a variant of_ buddha, _and the verb_ pābujjhati, _which in context clearly means to awaken from sleep._

Standing to one side, a devatā addressed the Blessed One with a verse:

“Those for whom
phenomena are thoroughly confused,
who may be led
by the teachings of others:
	Asleep are they;
	they haven’t awakened.
It’s time for them
to awaken.”

The Buddha:

“Those for whom
phenomena are not confused,
may not be led
by the teachings of others.
	Awakened
	through right knowing,
they go among the discordant
harmoniously.”[1](#sn1.8note01)
