## SN1.7 Unpenetrated

## ## Appaṭividitā Sutta


_In light of the question as to how best to translate_ Buddha, _this sutta offers evidence in support of the translation, “awakened.” The verses draw a direct connection between two words derived from the same root: the adjective_ sambuddha, _a variant of_ buddha, _and the verb_ pābujjhati, _which in context clearly means to awaken from sleep._

Standing to one side, a devatā addressed the Blessed One with a verse:

“Those in whom

phenomena are unpenetrated,

who may be led

by the teachings of others:

Asleep are they;

they haven’t awakened.

It’s time for them

to awaken.”

The Buddha:

“Those in whom

phenomena are well-penetrated,

may not be led

by the teachings of others.

Awakened

through right knowing,

they go among the discordant

harmoniously.”[1](#sn1.7note01)

Note

1. “Dissonant” and “harmoniously” translate _visama_ and _sama,_ which literally mean, “uneven” and “even.” Throughout ancient cultures, the terminology of music was used to describe the moral quality of people and actions. Discordant intervals or poorly-tuned musical instruments were metaphors for evil; harmonious intervals and well-tuned instruments, metaphors for good. In Pali, the term _sama_—“even”—described an instrument tuned on-pitch. There is a famous passage ([[Clean Files 3/Thanissaro 2/an-thanissaro-topfolders/an6/an6.55-thanissaro]]) where the Buddha reminds Soṇa Koḷivisa—who had been over-exerting himself in the practice—that a lute sounds appealing only if the strings are neither too taut or too lax, but “evenly” tuned. This image would have special resonances with the Buddha's teaching on the middle way. It also adds meaning to the term _samaṇa_—monk or contemplative—which the texts frequently mention as being derived from _sama._ The word _sāmañña_—“evenness,” the quality of being in tune—also means the quality of being a contemplative: The true contemplative is always in tune with what is proper and good.

This verse has an added play on words, in that the term “well-penetrated” can also mean “well-tuned.”
