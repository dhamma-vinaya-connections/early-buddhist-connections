## SN1.36 Conviction

## ## Saddhā Sutta


On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then many devatās of the Satullapa host, in the far extreme of the night, their extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta’s Grove, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, stood to one side. As they were standing there, one devatā recited these verses in the Blessed One’s presence:

Conviction is a person’s companion.[1](#sn1.36note01)
When you don’t take a stand
in lack of conviction,
prestige & honor come to you from that.
You go to heaven
  on abandoning the body.

You should 	discard anger,[2](#sn1.36note02)
			abandon conceit,
			transcend all fetters.
When you’re not adhering to name & form,
you have nothing—
  no bonds attack you.

They’re devoted to heedlessness
—dullards, fools—
while one who is wise
protects heedfulness
as his highest wealth.

Don’t devote yourself to heedlessness
	or to intimacy
	with sensual delight—
for a heedful person,
absorbed in jhāna,
attains the foremost ease.[3](#sn1.36note03)

Notes

1. Compare this line with [[Clean Files 3/Thanissaro 2/iti-thanissaro-notes-fixed-FLAT/iti15-thanissaro]].

2. The Burmese and Sri Lankan editions indicate that another devatā recites these verses, but the Thai edition doesn’t.

3. Aside from the final line, these last two verses are identical with [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/dhp-thanissaro/dhp26-thanissaro]]. Here the final line reads, _pappoti paramaṁ sukhaṁ,_ “attains the foremost ease,” while in [[dhp27-thanissaro]] it reads, _pappoti vipulaṁ sukhaṁ,_ “attains an abundance of ease.”
