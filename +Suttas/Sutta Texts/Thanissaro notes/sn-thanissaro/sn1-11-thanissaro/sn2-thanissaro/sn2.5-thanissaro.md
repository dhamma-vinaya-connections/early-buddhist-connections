## SN2.5 Dāmali the Deva’s Son

## ## Dāmali Sutta


Then Dāmali the deva’s son, in the far extreme of the night, his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta’s Grove, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, stood to one side. As he was standing there, he recited these verses in the Blessed One’s presence:

“This should be done
by the brahman
exerting himself relentlessly:
Abandoning sensuality,
he should not, through that,
wish for becoming.”

“For the brahman, there’s no duty,
[Dāmali,” said the Blessed One,]
“for the brahman’s duty is done.
As long as he hasn’t gained a footing in the river,
a man will strain with all his limbs.
But when he’s gained a footing
and is standing on firm ground,
he doesn’t strain, for he’s gone
				beyond.

This, Dāmali, is a simile
for the brahman—effluents ended,
masterful, doing jhāna:
Having reached the end
of birth & death,
he doesn’t strain, for he’s gone
				beyond.”
