## SN2.17 Subrahma the Deva’s Son

## ## Subrahma Sutta


Standing to one side, Subrahma the deva’s son recited this verse to the Blessed One:

“Constantly troubled is this mind,

constantly trembling this heart,

over duties[1](#sn2.17note01) that have yet to arise,

and those already arisen.

If there is an Untroubled,

point it out to me, when asked.”

The Buddha:

“Apart from the factors for awakening, austerity,[2](#sn2.17note02)

apart from sense-faculty restraint,

apart from relinquishing the all,[3](#sn2.17note03)

I see no safety

for living beings.”

That is what the Blessed One said… the deva disappeared right there.

Notes

1. Reading _kiccesu_ with the Thai version. The Burmese version has _kicchesu,_ “troubles.”

2. Reading _bojjhaṅga-tapasā_ with the Thai version. The Burmese version has _bojjhā tapasā,_ “from awakening, from austerity.” The Commentary notes that _bojjhaṅga/bojjhā_ refers to the development of the factors of awakening (see [[Clean Files 3/Thanissaro 2/mn-thani/mn118-thanissaro]]). _Tapasā,_ it says, refers to undertaking the dhutaṅga practices (see [[Clean Files 3/Thanissaro 2/thag-thanissaro-notes-fixed-FLAT/thag16-thanissaro]]).

3. On the definition of the all, see [[+Suttas/Sutta Texts/Thanissaro/Thanissaro notes/sn-thanissaro/sn35-44-thanissaro/sn35-thanissaro/sn35.23-thanissaro]].

> **Edition Notice**  
Bhikkhu Thanissaro’s translations are arranged according to the Thai Tipitaka edition. Therefore, some sutta references may not align with the 6th Council or Suttacentral.net numbering schemes, especially in the Saṁyutta Nikāya (SN) and Aṅguttara Nikāya (AN).
