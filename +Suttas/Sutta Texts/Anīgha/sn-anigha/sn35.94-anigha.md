# SN 35.94 - Untamed, Unguarded

At Sāvatthī.

“Bhikkhus, these six contact-fields bring suffering when they are untamed, unguarded, unprotected, and unrestrained. What six?

The contact-field of the eye brings suffering when it is untamed, unguarded, unprotected, and unrestrained.

The contact-field of the ear … nose … tongue … body …

The contact-field of the mental faculty brings suffering when it is untamed, unguarded, unprotected, and unrestrained.

These six contact-fields bring suffering when they are untamed, unguarded, unprotected, and unrestrained.

These six contact-fields bring happiness when they are well tamed, well guarded, well protected, and well restrained. What six?

The contact-field of the eye brings happiness when it is well tamed, well guarded, well protected, and well restrained.

The contact-field of the ear … nose… tongue … body …

The contact-field of the mental faculty brings happiness when it is well tamed, well guarded, well protected, and well restrained.

These six contact-fields bring happiness when they are well tamed, well guarded, well protected, and well restrained.”

That is what the Auspicious One said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:

> “Bhikkhus, it is just these six contact-fields where one unrestrained meets with suffering. Those who understand how to restrain them live with confidence, not assailed.
> 
> When you see pleasant sights, and unpleasant ones, too, subdue all manner of desire for the pleasant, and do not pollute the mind with thoughts of antipathy.
> 
> When you hear sounds both agreeable and disagreeable, do not become enthralled with agreeable sounds, and subdue aversion for the disagreeable. Do not pollute the mind with thoughts of antipathy.
> 
> When you smell a fragrant, delightful scent, and one that is foul and unpleasant, subdue resistance against the unpleasant, and do not yield to desire for the pleasant.
> 
> When partaking of a sweet, delicious taste, and sometimes, those that are bitter, do not partake of the sweet taste fixated on it, and do not despise the bitter.
> 
> Do not become infatuated with a pleasant pressure and do not tremble at an unpleasant one. Look with equanimity at the duality of pleasant and painful pressures, without favoring or opposing anything.
> 
> People generally let their perceptions proliferate; perceiving and proliferating, they become engaged. Expel all thoughts concerned with the mundane, and go about intent on renunciation.
> 
> When the mind is well developed like this with regard to the six, it does not waver at all in face of pressure. Bhikkhus, conquer these passions and aversions and go beyond birth and death!”
