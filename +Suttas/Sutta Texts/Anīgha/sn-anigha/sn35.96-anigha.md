# SN 35.96 - Falling Away

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you about the one who is falling away, the one who is not falling away, and the six conquered fields. Listen …

And how is one falling away? When a bhikkhu sees a sight with the eye, bad, unbeneficial memories and intentions of fettering nature arise. If that bhikkhu tolerates them and does not give them up, dispel them, eliminate them, and obliterate them, he should understand:  ‘I am falling away from beneficial qualities.  For, this is what the Auspicious One calls falling away.’

Furthermore, when a bhikkhu hears a sound … smells an odor … tastes a flavor … feels a touch … knows a phenomenon with the mental faculty, bad, unbeneficial memories and intentions of fettering nature arise. If that bhikkhu tolerates them and does not give them up, dispel them, eliminate them, and obliterate them, he should understand: ‘I am regressing from beneficial qualities. For this is what the Auspicious One calls regressing.’ That is how one is regressing.

And how is one not regressing? When a bhikkhu sees a sight with the eye, bad, unbeneficial memories and intentions of fettering nature arise. If that bhikkhu does not tolerate them but gives them up, dispels them, eliminates them, and obliterates them, he should understand: ‘I am not regressing from beneficial qualities. For this is what the Auspicious One calls not falling away.’

Furthermore, when a bhikkhu hears a sound … smells an odor … tastes a flavor … touches a touch … cognizes a phenomenon with the mental faculty, bad, unbeneficial memories and intentions of fettering nature arise. If that bhikkhu does not tolerate them but gives them up, dispels them, eliminates them, and obliterates them, he should understand: ‘I am not falling away from beneficial qualities. For this is what the Auspicious One calls not falling away.’ That is how one is not falling away.

And what are the conquered fields? When a bhikkhu sees a sight with the eye, bad, unbeneficial memories and intentions of fettering nature do not arise. He should understand: ‘This sense field has been conquered. For this is what the Auspicious One calls a conquered field.’ … Furthermore, when a bhikkhu cognizes a phenomenon with the mental faculty, bad, unbeneficial memories and intentions of fettering nature do not arise. He should understand: ‘This sense field has been conquered. For this is what the Auspicious One calls a conquered field.’ These are the six conquered fields.”
