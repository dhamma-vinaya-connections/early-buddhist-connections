# SN 22.101 - The Adze


At Sāvatthī.

“Bhikkhus, I say that the destruction of the influxes is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know or see. For one who knows and sees what? ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling … Such is perception … Such are activations … Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ The destruction of the influxes is for one who knows and sees this.

Even though a bhikkhu who is not committed to development might wish: ‘If only my mind was liberated from the influxes through non-assumption!’ Even so, his mind is not liberated from the influxes through non-assumption. Why is that? You should say: ‘Because of the lack of development’. Lack of development in what? Lack of development in the four establishments of recollectedness, the four right efforts, the four bases of spiritual ability, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path.

Suppose there was a hen with eight or ten or twelve eggs. But she had not properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. Even if that hen wishes: ‘If only my chicks could emerge from the eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safely!’ But they cannot emerge and hatch safely. Why is that? Because that hen, with eight, or ten, or twelve eggs, has not properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated.

In the same way, even though a bhikkhu who is not committed to development might wish: ‘If only my mind was liberated from the influxes through non-assumption!’ Even so, his mind is not liberated from the influxes through non-assumption. Why is that? You should say: ‘Because of the lack of development’. Lack of development in what? Lack of development in the four establishments of recollectedness, the four right efforts, the four bases of spiritual ability, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path.

Even though a bhikkhu who is committed to development might not wish: ‘If only my mind was liberated from the influxes through non-assumption!’ Even so, his mind is liberated from the influxes through non-assumption. Why is that? You should say: ‘Because of development’. Development in what? Development in the four establishments of recollectedness, the four right efforts, the four bases of spiritual ability, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path.

Suppose there was a hen with eight or ten or twelve eggs. And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. Even if that hen does not wish,: ‘If only my chicks could emerge from the eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safely!’ Still, they can emerge and hatch safely. Why is that? Because that chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated.

In the same way, even though a bhikkhu who is committed to development might not wish: ‘If only my mind was liberated from the influxes through non-assumption!’ Even so, his mind is liberated from the influxes through non-assumption. Why is that? You should say: ‘Because of development’. Development in what? Development in the four establishments of recollectedness, the four right efforts, the four bases of spiritual ability, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path.

Suppose a carpenter or his apprentice sees the marks of his fingers and thumb on the handle of his adze. He does not know how much of the handle was worn away today, how much yesterday, and how much previously. He simply knows, ‘it is worn away’ once it is already worn away.

In the same way, when a bhikkhu lives committed to development, he does not know how much of the influxes were worn away today, how much yesterday, and how much previously. He simply knows, ‘it is worn away’ once it is already worn away. Suppose there was a sea-faring ship bound together with ropes. For six months, they deteriorated in the water. Then in the cold season, it was hauled up on dry land, where the ropes were weathered by wind and sun. When the clouds soaked it with rain, the ropes would readily collapse and rot away. In the same way, when a bhikkhu lives committed to development, his fetters readily collapse and rot away.”
