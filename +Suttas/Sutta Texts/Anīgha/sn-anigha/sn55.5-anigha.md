# SN 55.5 - With Sāriputta (2nd)

Then Sāriputta approached the Auspicious One, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Auspicious One said to him:

“Sāriputta, they speak of a ‘factor for stream-entry’. What is a factor for stream-entry?”

“Bhante, the factors for stream-entry are associating with righteous men, listening to the true teaching, attention in light of the origin, and practicing in line with the teaching.”

“Good, good, Sāriputta! For the factors of stream-entry are associating with righteous men, listening to the true teaching, attention in light of the origin, and practicing in line with the teaching.

Sāriputta, they speak of ‘the stream’. What is the stream?”

“Bhante, the stream is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right recollectedness, and right composure.”

“Good, good, Sāriputta! For the stream is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right recollectedness, and right composure.

Sāriputta, they speak of ‘a stream-enterer’. What is a stream-enterer?”

“Bhante, anyone who possesses this noble eightfold path is called a stream-enterer, the venerable of such and such name and clan.” 

“Good, good, Sāriputta! For the one who possesses this noble eightfold path is called a stream-enterer, the venerable of such and such name and clan.”
