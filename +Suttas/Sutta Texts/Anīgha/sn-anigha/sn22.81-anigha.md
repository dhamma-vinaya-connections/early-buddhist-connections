# SN 22.81 - At Pārileyya

At one time, the Auspicious One was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery.

Then the Auspicious One dressed in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kosambī for alms. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he set his lodgings in order himself. Taking his bowl and robe, without informing his attendants or taking leave of the bhikkhu Saṅgha, he set out to go wandering alone, with no companion.

Then, not long after the Auspicious One had left, one of the bhikkhus went to Venerable Ānanda and informed him of the matter. Venerable Ānanda said, “Venerable, when the Auspicious One departs in this manner, it means he wants to stay alone. At this time, no-one should follow him.”

Then the Auspicious One, traveling stage by stage, arrived at Pārileyya, where he stayed at the root of a sacred sal tree. Then several bhikkhus approached Venerable Ānanda and exchanged pleasantries with him.

When the amicable and cordial talk was over, they sat down to one side and said to him, “Venerable, it has been a long time since we have heard a Dhamma talk from the Auspicious One. We wish to hear a Dhamma talk from the Auspicious One.”

Then Venerable Ānanda together with those bhikkhus went to Pārileyya to see the Auspicious One. They bowed and sat down to one side, and the Auspicious One educated, encouraged, uplifted, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk.

Now at that time, one of the bhikkhus had the thought, “For one who knows and sees in which way is there immediate destruction of the influxes?”

Then the Auspicious One, knowing what that bhikkhu was thinking, addressed the bhikkhus:

“Bhikkhus, I have explained the Dhamma thoroughly. I have thoroughly explained the four establishments of recollectedness, the four right efforts, the four bases of spiritual ability, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path. That is how I have explained the Dhamma thoroughly. Though I have explained the Dhamma thoroughly like this, still, a certain bhikkhu present here has this thought: “For one who knows and sees, in which way is there immediate destruction of the influxes?”

And for one who knows and sees, in which way, bhikkhus, is there the immediate destruction of the influxes? An unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones, who has not seen the righteous men and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the righteous men,

regards form as self. But that regarding is an activity.  And what is the foundation, origin, birthplace, and source of that activity? For an unlearned ordinary person, struck by feelings born of ignorance-contact, craving has arisen. That activity is born from that. So, that activity is impermanent, determined, and dependently originated.  And that craving, that feeling, that contact, and that ignorance are also impermanent, determined, and dependently originated. For one who knows and sees in this way, bhikkhus, there is immediate destruction of the influxes. 

Or perhaps they do not regard form as self, but they still regard self as possessing form. But that regarding is an activity. …

Or perhaps they do not regard form as self, or self as possessing form, but they still regard form in self. But that regarding is an activity. …

Or perhaps they do not regard form as self, or self as possessing form, or form in self, but they still regard self in form. But that regarding is an activity. …

Or perhaps, they do not regard form as self, or self as possessing form, or form in self, or self in form. But they regard feeling as self … perception as self … activations as self … consciousness as self … But that regarding is an activity. And what is the foundation, origin, birthplace, and source of that activity? For an unlearned ordinary person, struck by feelings born of ignorance-contact, craving has arisen. That activity is born from that. So, that activity is impermanent, determined, and dependently originated. And, that craving, that feeling, that contact, and that ignorance are also impermanent, determined, and dependently originated. For one who knows and sees in this way, bhikkhus, there is immediate destruction of the influxes.

Or, perhaps, they do not regard form or feeling or perception or activites or consciousness as self. Still, they have such a view: ‘The self and the cosmos are one and the same. After passing away, I will be permanent, everlasting, eternal, and imperishable.’ But that eternalist view is an activity.  And what is the foundation of that activity? … For one who knows and sees in this way, bhikkhus, there is immediate destruction of the influxes.

Or perhaps they do not regard form or feeling or perception or activations or consciousness as self. Nor do they have such a view: ‘The self and the cosmos are one and the same. After passing away, I will be permanent, everlasting, eternal, and imperishable.’ Still, they have such a view: ‘I might not be, and it might not be mine. I will not be, and it will not be mine.’ But that annihilationist view is an activity. And what is the foundation of that activity? … For one who knows and sees in this way, bhikkhus, there is immediate destruction of the influxes.

Or perhaps they do not regard form or feeling or perception or activations or consciousness as self. Nor do they have such a view: ‘The self and the cosmos are one and the same. After passing away, I will be permanent, everlasting, eternal, and imperishable.’ Nor do they have such a view: ‘I might not be, and it might not be mine. I will not be, and it will not be mine.’ Still, they have doubts and uncertainties. They are undecided about the true Dhamma. That doubt and uncertainty, that indecision about the true Dhamma, is an activity.  And what is the foundation of that activity? For an unlearned ordinary person, struck by feelings born of ignorance-contact, craving has arisen. That activity is born from that. So, that activity is impermanent, determined, and dependently originated. And that craving, that feeling, that contact, and that ignorance are also impermanent, determined, and dependently originated. For one who knows and sees in this way, bhikkhus, there is immediate destruction of the influxes.”
