# SN 35.97 - One Who Lives Heedlessly


“Bhikkhus, I will teach you one who lives heedlessly and one who lives heedfully. Listen …

And how does one live heedlessly?

For one who lives with the eye faculty unrestrained, the mind becomes soaked in sights cognizable by the eye. When the mind is soaked, There is no gladness. When There is no gladness, There is no joy. When There is no joy, There is no calm. When There is no calm, There is suffering. For one who is suffering, the mind does not become composed. When the mind is not composed, phenomena do not become clear. Because phenomena are not clear, they are considered to be living heedlessly.

For one who lives with the ear … nose … tongue … body … mental faculty unrestrained, the mind becomes soaked in phenomena cognizable by the mental faculty. When the mind is soaked, There is no gladness. When There is no gladness, There is no joy. When There is no joy, There is no calm. When There is no calm, There is suffering. For one who is suffering, the mind does not become composed. When the mind is not composed, phenomena do not become clear. Because phenomena are not clear, they are considered to be living heedlessly.

That’s how one lives heedlessly.

And how does one live heedfully?

For one who lives with the eye faculty restrained, the mind does not become soaked in sights cognizable by the eye. When the mind is not soaked, gladness is born. Being glad, joy is born. When the mind is joyous, the body becomes calm. When the body is calm, they abide at ease. For one who is at ease, the mind becomes composed.  When the mind is composed, phenomena become clear. Because phenomena are clear, they are considered to be living heedfully.

For one who lives with the ear … nose … tongue … body … mental faculty restrained, the mind does not become soaked in phenomena cognizable by the mind. When the mind is not soaked, gladness is born. Being glad, joy is born. When the mind is joyous, the body becomes calm. When the body is calm, they abide at ease. For one who is at ease, the mind becomes composed. When the mind is composed, phenomena become clear.  Because phenomena are clear, they are considered to be living heedfully.

That’s how someone lives heedfully.”
