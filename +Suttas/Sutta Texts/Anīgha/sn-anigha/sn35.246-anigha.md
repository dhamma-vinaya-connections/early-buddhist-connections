# SN 35.246 - The Simile of the Lute

“Bhikkhus, if for any bhikkhu or bhikkhuni desire or passion or aversion or muddledness or resistance with regard to sights cognizable by the eye arises, they should restrain the mind from that:  ‘This path is dangerous and perilous, thorny and tangled; it is a wrong course, an unsuitable path, a harmful way. This path is frequented by unrighteous men, not by righteous men. It is not worthy of you.’ Therefore, they should restrain the mind from those sights cognizable by the eye.

If for any bhikkhu or bhikkhuni desire or passion or aversion or muddledness or resistance with regard to sounds cognizable by the ear … smells cognizable by the nose … tastes cognizable by the tongue … touches cognizable by the body … phenomena cognizable by the mental faculty arises, they should restrain their mind from that:  ‘This path is dangerous and perilous, thorny and tangled; it is a wrong course, an unsuitable path, a harmful way. This path is frequented by unrighteous men, not by righteous men. It is not worthy of you.’ Therefore, they should rein in the mind from those phenomena cognizable by the mental faculty.

Suppose the crops have ripened,  but the caretaker is negligent. If an ox fond of crops invades the crops, it would indulge itself as much as it desires.

In the same way, an unlearned ordinary person, failing to exercise restraint with regard to the six fields of pressure, indulges as much as they desire and falls into carelessness with regard to the five avenues of sensuality. 

Suppose the crops have ripened, and the caretaker is diligent. If an ox fond of crops invades the crops, the caretaker would seize it firmly by the muzzle. Then they would seize it above the hump and hold it fast there. Then they would give it a good beating before driving it away. For a second time, and even a third time, the same thing might happen. As a result, no matter how long it stands or sits in a village or wilderness, that ox fond of crops would never invade that crop again, remembering the beating it received earlier.

In the same way, when a bhikkhu’s mind is subdued, well subdued with regard to the six fields of pressure, it becomes established internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes composed. 

Suppose a king or his minister had never heard the sound of a lute. When he first hears the sound, he would say, ‘My man, what is making this sound, so arousing, sensuous, intoxicating, infatuating, and captivating?’

They would say to him, ‘That, sir, is a lute.’

He would say, ‘Go, my man, fetch me that lute.’

So, they would fetch it and say, ‘This, sir, is that lute, whose sound is so arousing, sensuous, intoxicating, infatuating, and captivating.’

He would say, ‘I have had enough of that lute! Fetch me just the sound.’

They would say, ‘Sir, this lute is made of many components assembled together, which make a sound when they are played. That is, it depends on the body, the skin, the neck, the head, the strings, the plectrum, and a person to play it properly. That is how a lute is made of many components assembled together, which make a sound when they are played.’

But he would split that lute into ten pieces or a hundred pieces, then splinter it. He would burn the splinters with fire, and reduce them to ashes. Then he would sweep away the ashes in a strong wind, or float them away down a swift stream.

Then he would say, ‘A poor thing indeed is this so-called lute and whatever else is called a lute! But people waste their time with it, careless and duped!’

In the same way, a bhikkhu investigates form as far as it goes, feeling as far as it goes, perception as far as it goes, activations as far as they go, and consciousness as far as it goes.  As he investigates in this way, any ideas of ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I am’ do not occur to him.”
