# SN 1.1 - Crossing the Flood


Thus have I heard. At one time, the Auspicious One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.

Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the Auspicious One, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, “Good sir, how did you cross the flood?”

“Neither standing nor swimming, good sir, I crossed the flood.”

“But in what way did you cross the flood neither standing nor swimming?”

“When I stood still, I sank. And when I swam, I was swept away. That is how I crossed the flood neither standing nor swimming.”

> “After a long time, I see a brahmin extinguished. Neither standing nor swimming, he has crossed over clinging to the world.”

This is what that deity said, and the teacher approved. Then that deity, knowing that the teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the Auspicious One, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.
