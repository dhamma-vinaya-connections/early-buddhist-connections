# SN 56.30 - With Gavampati


At one time, several bhikkhus were staying in the land of the Cetīs at Sahajāti. Now at that time, after the meal, on return from almsround, several senior bhikkhus sat together in the pavilion and this discussion arose among them:

“Venerables, does someone who sees suffering also see the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering?”

When they said this, Venerable Gavampati said to those senior bhikkhus:

“Venerables, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Auspicious One: ‘Someone who sees suffering also sees the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. Someone who sees the origin of suffering also sees suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. Someone who sees the cessation of suffering also sees suffering, the origin of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. Someone who sees the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering also sees suffering, the origin of suffering, and the cessation of suffering.’”
