# SN 35.70 - Presently Evident (With Upavāna)

Then Venerable Upavāna approached the Auspicious One … and said to him:

“Bhante, it is said that the Dhamma is presently evident. In what way is the Dhamma presently evident, not involving time, verifiable, and goading-on, to be known by the wise for themselves?”

“Upavāna, take a bhikkhu who sees a sight with the eye. He feels both the sight and passion for the sight. There being passion for sights internally, he understands: ‘There is passion for sights internally for me’. This is how the Dhamma is presently evident, not involving time, verifiable, and goading-on, to be known by the wise for themselves.

Take a bhikkhu who hears … smells … tastes … touches …

Take a bhikkhu who cognizes a phenomenon with the mental faculty. He feels both the phenomenon and passion for the phenomenon. There being passion for phenomena internally, he understands: ‘There is passion for phenomena internally for me’. This is how the Dhamma is presently evident, not involving time, verifiable, and goading-on, to be known by the wise for themselves.

Now, take a bhikkhu who sees a sight with the eye. He feels the sight, but no passion for the sight.  There being no passion for sights internally, he understands: ‘There is no passion for sights internally for me’.  This is how the Dhamma is presently evident, not involving time, verifiable, and goading-on, to be known by the wise for themselves.

Take a bhikkhu who hears … smells … tastes … touches …

Take a bhikkhu who cognizes a phenomenon with the mental faculty. He feels the phenomenon, but no passion for the phenomenon. There being no passion for phenomena internally, he understands: ‘There is no passion for phenomena internally for me’. This is how, Upavāna, the Dhamma is presently evident, not involving time, verifiable, and goading-on, to be known by the wise for themselves.
