# SN 1.20 - With Samiddhi

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Auspicious One was staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monastery.

Then Venerable Samiddhi rose at daybreak and went to the hot springs to bathe. When he had bathed and emerged from the water, he stood in one robe drying himself.

Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire hot springs, approached Venerable Samiddhi, and, standing in the air, addressed him in verse:

> “Bhikkhu, you seek alms without having eaten instead of seeking alms after having eaten. But you should eat first, then seek alms: do not let the time pass you by.”
> 
> “I do not know the time; it is covered up and unseen. That is why I seek alms without having eaten, so that the time may not pass me by!”

Then that deity landed on the ground and said to Venerable Samiddhi, “You have gone forth while young, bhikkhu. With pristine black hair, you are blessed with youth, in the prime of life, and you have never played with sensuality. Enjoy human sensuality! Do not forgo what is presently evident to pursue what involves time.”

Friend, I am not forgoing what is presently evident to pursue what involves time. I am giving up what involves time to pursue what is presently evident. For the Auspicious One has said that sensuality involves time, with much suffering and distress, and the peril there is what is greater. But this Dhamma is presently evident, not involving time, verifiable, and goading-on, to be known by the wise for themselves.”

“But in what way, bhikkhu, has the Auspicious One said that sensuality involves time, with much suffering and distress, and that the peril there is what is greater”? And how is this Dhamma presently evident, not involving time, verifiable, and goading-on, to be known by the wise for themselves?”

Friend, I am junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching-and-discipline. I am not able to explain this in detail. But the Auspicious One, the Arahant, the Rightly Self-Awakened One is abiding near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monatery. You should approach him and ask about this matter. And you should remember it in accordance with the Auspicious One’s answer.”

“It is not easy for us to approach the Auspicious One, as he is surrounded by other illustrious deities. If you go to the Auspicious One and ask him about this matter, we will join and listen to the Dhamma.”

“Yes, venerable,” Venerable Samiddhi replied. He went to the Auspicious One, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed him of the matter. Then he added:

“Bhante, if that deity spoke the truth, he will be nearby.”

When he had spoken, that deity said to Venerable Samiddhi, “Ask, bhikkhu, ask! For I have arrived.”

Then the Auspicious One addressed the deity in verse:

> “Beings perceive the describable and are established in the describable. Not understanding the describable, they fall under the yoke of Death.
> 
> But having fully understood the describable, he does not conceive of one who describes, for he has nothing by which one could designate him. Tell me if you understand, spirit.” 

“I do not understand the detailed meaning of the Auspicious One’s brief statement. Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.”

> “‘Equal, superior, or worse’ conceiving like this, one falls into conflict. Unwavering in the face of the three discriminations,  ‘equal or superior’ do not occur to him. Tell me if you understand, spirit.”

“I do not understand the detailed meaning of the Auspicious One’s brief statement. Please teach me this matter, so I can understand the detailed meaning.”

> He has given up designation; he does not come into measurement. He has severed craving here—in relation to name-and-form. He has severed all ties, untroubled, free from hope.  Though gods and humans search for him, in this world and the world beyond, they never find him,  not in heaven nor in any abode.

Tell me if you understand, spirit.”

“This is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Auspicious One’s brief statement:

> One should never do anything bad by speech or mind or body in all the world. Having given up sensuality, recollected and aware, one should not engage in what is painful and unbeneficial.”
