# SN 45.55 - Accomplishment in attention in light of the origin (1st)

“Bhikkhus, the dawn is the forerunner and precursor of the sunrise. In the same way, accomplishment in attention in light of the origin is the forerunner and precursor of the noble eightfold path for a bhikkhu.  It is expected that a bhikkhu accomplished in attention in light of the origin will develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path.

And how does a bhikkhu accomplished in attention in light of the origin develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path? It is when a bhikkhu develops right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right recollectedness, and right composure, relying on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripening in relinquishment.  That is how a bhikkhu accomplished in attention in light of the origin develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path.”
