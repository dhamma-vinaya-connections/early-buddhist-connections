# SN 36.6 - The Arrow


Bhikkhus, an unlearned ordinary person feels pleasant, unpleasant, and neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feelings. A learned noble disciple also feels pleasant, unpleasant, and neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feelings. What, then, is the distinction, disparity, and difference between a learned noble disciple and an unlearned ordinary person?” 

Our teachings are rooted in the Auspicious One. …”

An unlearned ordinary person, when struck by unpleasant feeling, sorrows, wails, laments, beats their breast, and falls into a muddle. They feel two feelings: a bodily one as well as one pertaining to the _citta_. 

It is like someone who is pierced by an arrow, and is further pierced by a second arrow. Thus, they feel the feeling of two arrows.

In the same way, bhikkhus, an unlearned ordinary person, when struck by unpleasant feeling, sorrows, wails, laments, beats their breast, and falls in to a muddle. They feel two feelings: a bodily one as well as one pertaining to the _citta_. 

Struck by that same unpleasant feeling, they resist it.  Thus, the underlying tendency to resistance against unpleasant feeling underlies them.

Struck by unpleasant feeling, they delight in the pleasure of sensuality. Why is that? Because, bhikkhus, an unlearned ordinary person does not understand any escape from unpleasant feeling apart from the pleasure of sensuality.  Since they delight in the pleasure of sensuality, the underlying tendency to passion for pleasant feeling underlies them.

They do not understand as they are the origin, ending, gratification, peril, and escape from those feelings. Since they do not understand as they are the origin, ending, gratification, peril, and escape from those feelings, the underlying tendency to ignorance with regard to neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling underlies them. 

If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it yoked. If they feel an unpleasant feeling, they feel it yoked. If they feel a neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling, they feel it yoked.

This is called an unlearned ordinary person who is yoked to birth, old age, and death, to sorrows, lamentations, pains, dissatisfactions, and tribulations; who is yoked to suffering, I say.

But, bhikkhus, a learned noble disciple, when struck by unpleasant feeling, does not sorrow, wail, lament, beat their breast, or fall into a muddle. They feel one feeling: a bodily one, not one pertaining to the _citta_. 

It is like someone who is pierced by an arrow, But not by a second arrow. Thus, they feel the feeling of one arrow.

Since they understand as they are the origin, ending, gratification, peril, and escape from those feelings, the underlying tendency to ignorance with regard to neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling does not underlie them.

If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it unyoked. If they feel an unpleasant feeling, they feel it unyoked. If they feel a neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling, they feel it unyoked.

This is called a learned noble disciple who is unyoked from birth, old age, and death, from sorrows, lamentations, pains, dissatisfactions, and tribulations; who is unyoked from suffering, I say.

This is the distinction, disparity, and difference between a learned noble disciple and an unlearned ordinary person.

> One who understands and is learned does not feel a feeling  of pleasure or unpleasure. This is the great distinction between the wise and skilled, and the ordinary person.
> 
> A learned person who has comprehended the teaching sees through this world and the next. Desirable things do not agitate their mind nor are they repelled by the undesirable.
> 
> Both welcoming and opposing are dispelled and vanished, they are absent. Knowing the stainless, sorrowless state they—gone beyond being—understand rightly. ”
