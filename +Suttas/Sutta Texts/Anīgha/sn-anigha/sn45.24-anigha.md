# SN 45.24 - The Way (2nd)


At Sāvatthī.

“Bhikkhus, whether for a layperson or one gone forth, I do not praise the wrong way. Whether it is a layperson or one gone forth who is practising wrongly, because of undertaking the wrong way of practice he does not attain the method, the Dhamma that is wholesome.

And what, bhikkhus, is the wrong way? It is: wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong recollectedness, wrong composure. This is called the wrong way. Bhikkhus, whether for a layperson or one gone forth, I do not praise the wrong way. Whether it is a layperson or one gone forth who is practising wrongly, because of undertaking the wrong way of practice he does not attain the method, the Dhamma that is wholesome.”
