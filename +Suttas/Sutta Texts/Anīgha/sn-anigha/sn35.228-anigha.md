# SN 35.228 - The Ocean (1st)

“Bhikkhus, an unlearned ordinary person speaks of the ocean. But that is not the ocean in the training of the Noble One. That is just a large body of water, a large sea of water. The eye, bhikkhus, is the ocean for a man, and its tide is made of sights.

One who withstands that tide is said to have crossed over the ocean of the eye, with its waves and whirlpools, its saltwater crocodiles and monsters.  Crossed over, the brahmin stands on dry land. 

The ear … nose … tongue … body … The mental faculty is the ocean for a man, and its tide is made of phenomena. One who withstands that tide is said to have crossed over the ocean of the mental faculty, with its waves and whirlpools, its saltwater crocodiles and monsters. Crossed over, the brahmin stands on dry land.”

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Excellent One, the Teacher, went on to say:

> “He who has crossed this ocean so hard to cross, with its saltwater crocodiles and monsters, With its waves, whirlpools, and dangers, He, perfected in understanding, who has completed the renunciate path, Is called ‘One who reached the end of the world, and went beyond’.
