# SN 40.1 - A Question About the First jhāna

At one time, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the bhikkhus: “Venerable bhikkhus!”

“Venerable,” they replied. Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:

“Just now, venerables, as I was in private retreat, this thought came to mind: ‘They speak of this thing called the “first jhāna”. What is the first jhāna?’ It occurred to me: It is when a bhikkhu, having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality, having withdrawn from unbeneficial phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of withdrawal, abides having entered upon the first jhāna. This is called the first jhāna.’

And so, having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality, having withdrawn from unbeneficial phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of withdrawal, I abided having entered upon the first jhāna. While I abided like this, attention to perceptions connected with sensuality beset me. 

Then the Auspicious One came up to me with his psychic power and said, ‘Moggallāna, Moggallāna! Do not neglect the first jhāna, brahmin! Settle your mind in the first jhāna; unify and compose your mind in the first jhāna.’

And so, after some time, having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality, having withdrawn from unbeneficial phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of withdrawal, I abided having entered upon the first jhāna.

So, venerables, if anyone should be rightly called a disciple who has attained to great higher knowledge with help from the Teacher, it is I.”
