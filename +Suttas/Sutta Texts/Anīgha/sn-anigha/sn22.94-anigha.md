# SN 22.94 - Flowers

At Sāvatthī.

“Bhikkhus, I do not argue with the world; it is the world that argues with me. When your speech is in line with the Dhamma, you do not argue with anyone in the world. What the wise deem as not existing, I too say does not exist. What the wise deem as existing, I too say exists.

And what do the wise deem as not existing, which I too say does not exist? Form that is permanent, everlasting, eternal, and imperishable.

Feeling …

Perception …

Activities …

Consciousness that is permanent, everlasting, eternal, and imperishable. This is what the wise deem as not existing, which I too say does not exist.

And what do the wise deem as existing, which I too say exists? Form that is impermanent, suffering, and perishable.

Feeling … Perception … Activities …

Consciousness that is impermanent, suffering, and perishable. This is what the wise deem as existing, which I too say exists.

There is a mundane phenomenon within the world that the Realized One awakens to and comprehends. Having done so, he explains, teaches, asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it.

And what is that mundane phenomenon within the world? Form is a mundane phenomenon within the world that the Realized One understands and comprehends. Having done so, he explains, teaches, asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it.

This being so, what can I do about a foolish ordinary person, blind and sightless, who does not know or see?

Consciousness is a mundane phenomenon within the world that the Realized One understands and comprehends. Then he explains, teaches, asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it.

This being so, what can I do about a foolish ordinary person, blind and sightless, who does not know or see?

Suppose there was a blue water lily, or a pink or white lotus. Though it sprouted and grew in the water. Having risen up above the water, it would stand unsmeared by the water. In the same way, though the Tathāgata was born and grew up in the world, he abides having surmounted the world, unsmeared by the world.”
