# SN 47.8 - The Cook


“Bhikkhus, suppose a foolish, incompetent, unskillful cook was to serve a king or his minister with a vast array of curries: superbly sour, bitter, pungent, and sweet; hot and mild, salty and bland.

But that cook did not grasp the hint of his own master:  ‘Today, my master preferred this sauce, or he reached for it, or he took a significant amount of it, or he praised it. Today, my master preferred the sour or bitter or pungent or sweet or hot or mild or salty sauce. Or he preferred the bland sauce, or he reached for the bland one, or he took a significant amount of it, or he praised it.’

That foolish, incompetent, unskillful cook is not awarded clothes, wages, or bonuses. Why is that? Because he does not grasp the hint of his own master.

In the same way, a foolish, incompetent, unskillful bhikkhu abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body—diligent, aware, and recollected, having subdued longing and upset with regard to the world.  As he abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body, his mind does not become composed, and the defilements are not given up. He does not grasp that hint.  He abides maintaining perspective of feelings concurrently with feelings … of the mind concurrently with the mind … of phenomena concurrently with phenomena—diligent, aware, and recollected, having subdued longing and upset with regard to the world. As he abides maintaining perspective of phenomena concurrently with phenomena, his mind does not become composed, and the defilements are not given up. He does not grasp that hint.

That foolish, incompetent, unskillful bhikkhu does not gain easeful abidings right in the present experience, nor does he gain recollectedness-and-awareness.  Why is that? Because that foolish, incompetent, unskillful bhikkhu does not grasp the hint of his own mind.

Suppose an astute, competent, skillful cook was to serve a ruler or their minister with a vast array of curries: superbly sour, bitter, pungent, and sweet; hot and mild, salty and bland.

And that cook grasped the hint of his own master: ‘Today my master preferred this sauce, or he reached for it, or he took a significant amount of it, or he praised it. Today my master preferred the sour, bitter, pungent, sweet, hot, mild, or salty sauce. Or he preferred the bland sauce, or he reached for the bland one, or he took a significant amount of it, or he praised it.’

That astute, competent, skillful cook is awareded clothes, wages, and bonuses. Why is that? Because he grasps the hint of his own master.

In the same way, a wise, competent, skillful bhikkhu abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body—diligent, aware, and recollected, having subdued longing and upset with regard to the world. As he abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body, his mind becomes composed, and the defilements are given up. He grasps that hint.  He abides maintaining perspective of feelings concurrently with feelings … of the mind concurrently with the mind … of phenomena concurrently with phenomena—diligent, aware, and recollected, having subdued longing and upset with regard to the world. As he abides maintaining perspective of phenomena concurrently with phenomena, his mind becomes composed, and the defilements are given up. He grasps that hint.

That wise, competent, skillful bhikkhu gains easeful abidings in the present experience, and he gains recollectedness-and-awareness.  Why is that? Because that wise, competent, skillful bhikkhu grasps the hint of his own mind.”
