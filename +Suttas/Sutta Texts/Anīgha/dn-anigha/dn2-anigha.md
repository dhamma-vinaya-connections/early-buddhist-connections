# DN 2 - The Fruits of the Ascetic Life

## 1\. A Discussion With the King’s Ministers

Thus have I heard. At one time the Auspicious One was staying near Rājagaha in the Mango Grove of Jīvaka Komārabhacca, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 bhikkhus.

Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the Komudī full moon on the fifteenth day of the fourth month—and King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, was sitting upstairs in the royal longhouse surrounded by his ministers.

Then Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, expressed this heartfelt sentiment, “Oh, sirs, this moonlit night is so very delightful, so beautiful, so glorious, so pleasant, so striking. Now, what ascetic or brahmin might I pay homage to today, paying homage to whom my mind might find peace?”

When he had spoken, one of the king’s ministers said to him, “Sire, Pūraṇa Kassapa leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He is a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” But when he had spoken, the king kept silent.

Another of the king’s ministers said to him, “Sire, the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He is a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” But when he had spoken, the king kept silent.

Another of the king’s ministers said to him, “Sire, Ajita of the hair blanket leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He is a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” But when he had spoken, the king kept silent.

Another of the king’s ministers said to him, “Sire, Pakudha Kaccāyana leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He is a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” But when he had spoken, the king kept silent.

Another of the king’s ministers said to him, “Sire, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He is a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” But when he had spoken, the king kept silent.

Another of the king’s ministers said to him, “Sire, the Jain Nāṭaputta leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He is a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” But when he had spoken, the king kept silent.

## 2\. A Discussion With Jīvaka Komārabhacca

Now at that time Jīvaka Komārabhacca was sitting silently not far from the king. Then the king said to him, “But my dear Jīvaka, why are you silent?”

“Sire, the Auspicious One, the Arahant, the Rightly Self-Awakened One is staying in my mango grove together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 bhikkhus. He has this good reputation: ‘That Auspicious One is an Arahant, a Rightly Self-Awakened One, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.”

“Well then, my dear Jīvaka, have the elephants readied.”

“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Jīvaka. He had around five hundred female elephants readied, in addition to the king’s bull elephant for riding. Then he informed the king, “The elephants are ready, sire. Please go at your convenience.”

Then King Ajātasattu had women mounted on each of the five hundred female elephants, while he mounted his bull elephant. With attendants carrying torches, he set out in full royal pomp from Rājagaha to Jīvaka’s mango grove.

But as he drew near the mango grove, the king became frightened, scared, his hair standing on end. He said to Jīvaka, “My dear Jīvaka, I hope you are not deceiving me! I hope you are not betraying me! I hope you are not turning me over to my enemies! For how in the world can there be no sound of coughing or clearing throats or any noise in such a large Saṅgha of 1,250 bhikkhus?”

“Do not fear, great king, do not fear! I am not deceiving you, or betraying you, or turning you over to your enemies. Go forward, great king, go forward! Those are lamps shining in the pavilion.”

## 3\. The Question About the Fruits of the Ascetic Life

Then King Ajātasattu rode on the elephant as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the pavilion door on foot, where he asked Jīvaka, “But my dear Jīvaka, where is the Auspicious One?”

“That is the Auspicious One, great king, that is the Auspicious One! He is sitting against the central column facing east, in front of the Saṅgha of bhikkhus.”

Then the king approached the Auspicious One and stood to one side. He looked around the Saṅgha of bhikkhus, who were so very silent, like a still, clear lake, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment, “May my son, Prince Udāyibhadda, be blessed with such peace as the Saṅgha of bhikkhus now enjoys!”

“Has your mind gone to one you love, great king?”

“Bhante, I love my son, Prince Udāyibhadda. May he be blessed with such peace as the Saṅgha of bhikkhus now enjoys!”

Then the king bowed to the Auspicious One, raised his joined palms toward the Saṅgha, and sat down to one side. He said to the Auspicious One, “Sir, I would like to ask you about a certain point, if you would take the time to answer.”

“Ask what you wish, great king.”

“Sir, there are many different professional fields. These include elephant riders, cavalry, charioteers, archers, bannermen, adjutants, food servers, warrior-chiefs, princes, chargers, great warriors, heroes, leather-clad soldiers, and sons of bondservants. They also include bakers, barbers, bathroom attendants, cooks, garland-makers, dyers, weavers, basket-makers, potters, accountants, finger-talliers, or those following any similar professions. All these live off the fruits of their profession which are presently evident. With that they make themselves happy and pleased. They make their parents, their children and partners, and their friends and colleagues happy and pleased. And they establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that is conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven. Sir, can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life that is likewise presently evident?”

“Great king, do you recall having asked this question of other ascetics and brahmins?”

“I do, Bhante.”

“If you would not mind, great king, tell me how they answered.”

“It is no trouble when someone such as the Auspicious One is sitting here.”

“Well, speak then, great king.”

### 3.1. The Doctrine of Pūraṇa Kassapa

“One time, Bhante, I approached Pūraṇa Kassapa and exchanged pleasantries with him. When the amicable and cordial talk was over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question.

He said to me: ‘Great king, the one who acts does nothing wrong when they punish, mutilate, torture, aggrieve, oppress, intimidate, or when they encourage others to do the same. They do nothing wrong when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie. If you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razor-edged chakram, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil. If you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, mutilating, and torturing, and encouraging others to do the same, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil. If you were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and sacrificing and encouraging others to do the same, no merit comes of that, and no outcome of merit. In giving, self-control, restraint, and truthfulness there is no merit or outcome of merit.’

And so, when I asked Pūraṇa Kassapa about the fruits of the ascetic life that are presently evident, he answered with the doctrine of inaction. It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. I thought: ‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Pūraṇa Kassapa. I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I arose from my seat and left.

### 3.2. The Doctrine of the Bamboo-staffed Ascetic Gosāla

One time, Bhante, I approached the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla and exchanged pleasantries with him. When the amicable and cordial talk was over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question.

He said: ‘Great king, there is no cause or reason for the defilement of beings. Beings are corrupted without cause or reason. There is no cause or reason for the purification of beings. Beings are purified without cause or reason. One does not act of one’s own volition, one does not act of another’s volition, one does not act from a person’s volition. There is no power, no effort, no human strength or vigor. All beings, all living creatures, all beings, all souls lack control, power, and energy. Molded by destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of rebirth. There are 1.4 million main wombs, and 6,000, and 600. There are 500 deeds, and five, and three. There are deeds and half-deeds. There are 62 paths, 62 sub-eons, six classes of birth, and eight stages in a person’s life. There are 4,900 Ājīvaka ascetics, 4,900 wanderers, and 4,900 naked ascetics. There are 2,000 faculties, 3,000 hells, and 36 realms of dust. There are seven percipient embryos, seven non-percipient embryos, and seven knotless embryos. There are seven gods, seven humans, and seven goblins. There are seven lakes, seven rivers, 700 rivers, seven cliffs, and 700 cliffs. There are seven dreams and 700 dreams. There are 8.4 million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of suffering. And here there is no such thing as this: “By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or renunciate life I shall force unripened deeds to bear their fruit, or eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by little,” for that cannot be. Pleasure and pain are allotted. Transmigration lasts only for a limited period, so There is no increase or decrease, no getting better or worse. It is like how, when you toss a ball of string, it rolls away unraveling. In the same way, after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of suffering.’

And so, when I asked the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla about the fruits of the ascetic life that are presently evident, he answered with the doctrine of purification through transmigration. It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. I thought: ‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla. I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I arose from my seat and left.

### 3.3. The Doctrine of Ajita of the Hair Blanket

One time, Bhante, I approached Ajita of the hair blanket and exchanged pleasantries with him. When the amicable and cordial talk was over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question.

He said: ‘There is no giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There is no fruit or result of good and bad actions. This world does not exist, nor the other world. There is no mother or father, nor beings that reappear spontaneously. And There is no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who, having comprehended and experienced it for himself, makes known this world and the other. This person is made up of the four great elements. When they die, the earth in their body merges and coalesces with the mass of earth. The water in their body merges and coalesces with the mass of water. The fire in their body merges and coalesces with the mass of fire. The air in their body merges and coalesces with the mass of air. The faculties are transferred to space. Four men with a bier carry away the corpse. Their footprints show the way to the cemetery. The bones become bleached. Offerings dedicated to the gods end in ashes. Giving is a doctrine of idiots. When anyone affirms a teaching of action and afterlife, it is just hollow, false nonsense.  Both the foolish and the astute are annihilated and destroyed on the dissolution of the body, and do not exist after death.’

And so, when I asked Ajita of the hair blanket about the fruits of the ascetic life that are presently evident, he answered with the doctrine of annihilationism. It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. I thought: ‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Ajita of the hair blanket. I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I arose from my seat and left.

### 3.4. The Doctrine of Pakudha Kaccāyana

One time, Bhante, I approached Pakudha Kaccāyana and exchanged pleasantries with him. When the amicable and cordial talk was over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question.

He said: ‘Great king, these seven masses are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They do not move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They are unable to cause pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain to each other. What seven? The masses of earth, water, fire, air; pleasure, pain, and the soul is the seventh. These seven masses are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They do not move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They are unable to cause pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain to each other. And here there is no-one who kills or who makes others kill; no-one who learns or who educates others; no-one who understands or who helps others understand. If you sever someone’s head with a sharp sword, you do not take anyone’s life. The sword simply passes through the gap between the seven masses.’ 

And so, when I asked Pakudha Kaccāyana about the fruits of the ascetic life that are presently evident, he answered with something else entirely. It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. I thought: ‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Pakudha Kaccāyana. I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I arose from my seat and left.

### 3.5. The Doctrine of the Jain Nāṭaputta

One time, Bhante, I approached the Jain Nāṭaputta and exchanged pleasantries with him. When the amicable and cordial talk was over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question.

He said: ‘Great king, consider a Jain who is restrained in the fourfold constraint. And how is a Jain restrained in the fourfold constraint? It is when a Jain is restrained in all that is to be restrained, is bridled in all that is to be restrained, has shaken off all that is to be restrained, and is curbed in all that is to be restrained. That is how a Jain is restrained in the fourfold constraint. When a Jain is restrained in the fourfold constraint, they are called a knotless one who is self-realized, self-controlled, and steadfast.’

And so, when I asked the Jain Ñātika about the fruits of the ascetic life that are presently evident, he answered with the fourfold constraint. It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. I thought: ‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the Jain Nāṭaputta. I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I arose from my seat and left.

### 3.6. The Doctrine of Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta

One time, Bhante, I approached Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta and exchanged pleasantries with him. When the amicable and cordial talk was over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question.

He said: ‘Suppose you were to ask me whether there is another world. If I believed there was, I would say so. But I do not say it is like this. I do not say it is like that. I do not say it is otherwise. I do not say it is not so. And I do not deny it is not so. Suppose you were to ask me whether there is no other world … whether there both is and is not another world … whether there neither is nor is not another world … whether there are beings who are reborn spontaneously … whether there are no beings who are reborn spontaneously … whether there both are and are not beings who are reborn spontaneously … whether there neither are nor are not beings who are reborn spontaneously … whether there is fruit and result of good and bad deeds … whether there is no fruit and result of good and bad deeds … whether there both is and is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds … whether there neither is nor is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds … whether a realized one still exists after death … whether a realized one no longer exists after death … whether a realized one both still exists and no longer exists after death … whether a realized one neither still exists nor no longer exists after death. If I believed there was, I would say so. But I do not say it is like this. I do not say it is like that. I do not say it is otherwise. I do not say it is not so. And I do not deny it is not so.’

And so, when I asked Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta about the fruits of the ascetic life that are presently evident, he answered with flip-flopping. It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. I thought: ‘This is the most foolish and muddled of all these ascetics and brahmins! How in the world can he answer with flip-flopping when asked about the fruits of the ascetic life that are presently evident?’ I thought: ‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta. I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I arose from my seat and left.

## 4\. The Fruits of the Ascetic Life

### 4.1. The First Fruit of the Ascetic Life

And so I ask the Auspicious One: Venerable sir, there are many different professional fields. These include elephant riders, cavalry, charioteers, archers, bannermen, adjutants, food servers, warrior-chiefs, princes, chargers, great warriors, heroes, leather-clad soldiers, and sons of bondservants. They also include bakers, barbers, bathroom attendants, cooks, garland-makers, dyers, weavers, basket-makers, potters, accountants, finger-talliers, or those following any similar professions. All these live off the fruits of their profession which are presently evident. With that they make themselves happy and pleased. They make their parents, their children and partners, and their friends and colleagues happy and pleased. And they establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that is conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven. Venerable sir, can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life that is likewise presently evident?”

“I can, great king. Well then, I will ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, great king? Suppose you had a man who was a bondservant, a worker. He gets up before you and goes to bed after you, and is obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely, and gazing up at your face. He would think: ‘The outcome and result of good deeds is so incredible, so amazing! For this King Ajātasattu is a human being, and so am I. Yet he amuses himself, supplied and provided with the five avenues of sensuality as if he were a god. Whereas I am his bondservant, his worker. I get up before him and go to bed after him, and am obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely, and gazing up at his face. I really should do good deeds. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ 

After some time, that is what he does. Having gone forth he would live restrained in body, speech, and thought, living content with nothing more than food and clothes, delighting in seclusion. And suppose your men were to report all this to you. Would you say to them: ‘Bring that man to me! Let him once more be my bondservant, my worker’?”

“No, Bhante. Rather, I would bow to him, rise in his presence, and offer him a seat. I would invite him to accept robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And I would organize his lawful guarding and protection.”

“What do you think, great king? If this is so, is there a fruit of the ascetic life that is presently evident or not?”

“Clearly, Bhante, there is.”

“This is the first fruit of the ascetic life that is presently evident, which I point out to you.”

### 4.2. The Second Fruit of the Ascetic Life

“But, Bhante, can you point out another fruit of the ascetic life that is likewise presently evident?”

“I can, great king. Well then, I will ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, great king? Suppose you had a man who was a farmer, a householder, a hard worker, someone who builds up his capital. He would think: ‘The outcome and result of good deeds is just so incredible, so amazing! For this King Ajātasattu is a human being, and so am I. Yet he amuses himself, supplied and provided with the five avenues of sensuality as if he were a god. Whereas I am a farmer, a householder, a hard worker, someone who builds up his capital. I really should do good deeds. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’

After some time, he gives up a large or small fortune and a large or small family circle. He shaves off hair and beard, dresses in ocher robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness. Having gone forth he would live restrained in body, speech, and thought, living content with nothing more than food and clothes, delighting in seclusion. And suppose your men were to report all this to you. Would you say to them: ‘Bring that man to me! Let him once more be a farmer, a householder, a hard worker, someone who builds up their capital’?”

“No, Bhante. Rather, I would bow to him, rise in his presence, and offer him a seat. I would invite him to accept robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And I would organize his lawful guarding and protection.”

“What do you think, great king? If this is so, is there a fruit of the ascetic life that is presently evident or not?”

“Clearly, Bhante there is.”

“This is the second fruit of the ascetic life that is presently evident, which I point out to you.”

### 4.3. The Finer Fruits of the Ascetic Life

“But, Bhante, can you point out another fruit of the ascetic life that is likewise presently evident?”

“I can, great king. Well then, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante” replied the king.

The Auspicious One said this:

“Consider when a Realized One arises in the world, an Arahant, a Rightly Self-Awakened One, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. Having for himself comprehended and experienced this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—he makes it known to others. He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a renunciate life that is entirely complete and pure.

A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s son, or someone born in some good family. He gains faith in the Realized One and reflects: ‘Household life is confined and dusty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. It is not easy for someone living at home to lead the renunciate life utterly complete and pure, like a polished shell. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’

After some time, he gives up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. He shaves off hair and beard, dresses in ocher robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness.

Once he is gone forth, he lives restrained by the code of conduct, endowed with proper behavior and a suitable environment. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, he trains in the training rules. He acts skillfully by body and speech. He is purified in livelihood and accomplished in virtue. He guards the sense doors, is endowed with recollectedness-and-awareness, and is content.

#### 4.3.1. Virtue

##### 4.3.1.2. The Middle Section on Virtue

There are some ascetics and brahmins who, while enjoying food given in faith, still engage in injuring plants and seeds. These include plants propagated from roots, stems, cuttings, or joints; and those from regular seeds as the fifth. He abstains from such injury to plants and seeds. This pertains to his virtue.

There are some ascetics and brahmins who, while enjoying food given in faith, still engage in storing up goods for their own use.

He abstains from such bedding. This pertains to his virtue.

There are some ascetics and brahmins who, while enjoying food given in faith, still engage in beautifying and adorning themselves with garlands, fragrance, and makeup.

He abstains from such beautification and adornment. This pertains to his virtue.

There are some ascetics and brahmins who, while enjoying food given in faith, still engage in low talk.

You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you have thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted.

(The longer section on virtue is finished).

#### 4.3.2. Composure

##### 4.3.2.1. Sense Restraint

And how does the bhikkhu guard the sense doors? When he sees a sight with the eye, he does not grasp at signs and features of it on account of which—due to abiding with the eye faculty unrestrained—bad, unbeneficial thoughts of longing and upset would flow in on him. He practices to restrain that; he guards the eye faculty and brings about the restraint of the eye faculty. When he hears a sound with the ear … When he smells an odor with the nose … When he tastes a flavor with the tongue … When he touches a touch with the body … When he cognizes a phenomenon with the mental faculty, he does not grasp at signs and features of it on account of which—due to abiding with the mental faculty unrestrained—bad, unbeneficial thoughts of longing and upset would flow in on him. He practices to restrain that; he guards the mental faculty and brings about the restraint of the mental faculty. Possessed of this noble sense restraint, he experiences an unsullied ease internally. That is how the bhikkhu guards the sense doors.

##### 4.3.2.2. Remembrance-and-Awareness

And how is the bhikkhu possessed of recollectedness-and-awareness? He acts with awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.  That is how the bhikkhu is possessed of recollectedness-and-awareness.

##### 4.3.2.3. Contentment

And how is the bhikkhu content? It is when the bhikkhu is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever he goes, he sets out taking only these things. He is like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. In the same way, the bhikkhu is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever he goes, he sets out taking only these things. That is how the bhikkhu is content.

##### 4.3.2.4. Giving Up the Hindrances


Possessed of noble aggregate of noble virtue, this noble sense restraint, this noble recollectedness-and-awareness, and this noble contentment, he frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. After the meal, he returns from almsround, sits down cross-legged, sets his body straight, and establishes recollectedness at the fore.

With the giving up of longing with regard to the world, he abides with a mind rid of longing; he cleanses the mind of longing. With the giving up of ill will and hatred, he abides with a mind rid of ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all creatures and beings; he cleanses the mind of ill will and hatred. With the giving up of indolence-and-lethargy, he abides with a mind rid of indolence-and-lethargy, perceiving light, recollected, and aware; he cleanses the mind of indolence-and-lethargy. With the giving up of restlessness-and-anxiety, he abides without restlessness, his mind internally appeased; he cleanses the mind of restlessness-and-anxiety. Giving up doubt, he abides having gone beyond doubt, not uncertain about beneficial qualities; he cleanses the mind of doubt.

Suppose a man who had gotten into debt applied himself to work, and his efforts proved successful. He would pay off the original loan and have enough left over to support his wife. Thinking about this, he would be filled with joy and happiness.

Suppose there was a man who was sick, suffering, gravely ill. He would lose his appetite and get physically weak. But after some time, he would recover from that illness, and regain his appetite and his strength. Thinking about this, he would be filled with joy and happiness.

Suppose a man was imprisoned in a jail. But after some time, he would be released from jail, safe and sound, with no loss of wealth. Thinking about this, he would be filled with joy and happiness.

Suppose a man was a bondservant. He would not be his own master, but indentured to another, unable to go where he wishes. But after some time, he would be freed from servitude. He would be his own master, not indentured to another, an emancipated individual able to go where he wishes. Thinking about this, he would be filled with joy and happiness.

Suppose a man with wealth and property was traveling along a perilous desert road with insufficient provisions.. But after some time, he crossed over the desert safely, arriving within a village that was safe and free from peril. Thinking about this, he would be filled with joy and happiness.

In the same way, the bhikkhu regards these five hindrances that are not given up in him as a debt, a disease, a prison, slavery, and a desert crossing.

But when these five hindrances are given up in him, the bhikkhu regards this as freedom from debt, good health, release from prison, emancipation, and a place of safety at last.

Considering that the five hindrances have been given up in him, gladness is born. When he is glad, joy is born. When the mind is joyous, the body becomes calm. When the body is calm, he feels at ease. When he is at ease, the mind becomes composed. 

##### 4.3.2.5. First jhāna

Having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality, having withdrawn from unbeneficial phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of withdrawal, he abides having entered upon the first jhāna. He tops up, suffuses, fills, and pervades his body with the joy and ease born of withdrawal. There would be no part of his whole body that is not pervaded with the joy and ease born of withdrawal. 

It is like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out. In the same way, the bhikkhu tops up, suffuses, fills, and pervades his body with the joy and ease born of withdrawal. There would be no part of his whole body that is not pervaded with the joy and ease born of withdrawal. This, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that is presently evident which is better and finer than the former ones. 

##### 4.3.2.6. Second jhāna

Furthermore, with the appeasement of thinking and pondering, with internal confidence and collectedness of mind, without thinking or pondering and with joy and ease born of composure, the bhikkhu abides having entered upon the second jhāna. He tops up, suffuses, fills, and pervades his body with the joy and ease born of composure. There would be no part of his whole body that is not pervaded with the joy and ease born of composure.

It is like a deep lake fed by spring water where there would be no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and no rainfall to replenish it from time to time. But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake would top up, suffuse, fill, and pervade the lake. There would be no part of the whole lake that is not pervaded with cool water.

In the same way, the bhikkhu tops up, suffuses, fills, and pervades his body with joy and ease born of composure. There would be no part of his whole body that is not pervaded with the joy and ease born of composure. This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that is presently evident which is better and finer than the former ones.

##### 4.3.2.7. Third jhāna

Furthermore, with the fading of joy, the bhikkhu abides equanimous, recollected, and aware, experiencing ease with the body. He abides having entered upon the third jhāna, with regard to which the noble ones say “one abides equanimous, recollected, and at ease.” He tops up, suffuses, fills, and pervades his body with the ease devoid of joy. There would be no part of his whole body that is not pervaded with the ease devoid of joy.

It is like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. From the tip to the root they are topped up, suffused, filled, and pervaded with cool water. There would be no part of them that is not pervaded with cool water. In the same way, the bhikkhu tops up, suffuses, fills, and pervades his whole body with the ease devoid of joy. There would be no part of his whole body that is not pervaded with the ease devoid of joy. This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that is presently evident which is better and finer than the former ones.

##### 4.3.2.8. Fourth jhāna

Furthermore, with the giving up of ease and unease—and with the ending of joys and upsets beforehand—without ease or unease, with purity of equanimity and recollectedness, the bhikkhu abides having entered upon the fourth jhāna. He sits having pervaded his body with a pure, bright mind. There would be no part of his whole body that is not pervaded with a pure, bright mind.

It is like a man sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth. There would be no part of his whole body that is not spread over with white cloth. In the same way, the bhikkhu sits having pervaded his body with a pure, bright mind. There would be no part of his whole body that is not pervaded with a pure, bright mind. This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that is presently evident which is better and finer than the former ones.

#### 4.3.3. The Eight Knowledges

It is made up of the four great elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction. And this consciousness of mine is dependent and tied to it.’

Suppose there was a beryl gem that was beautiful, genuine, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good qualities. And it was strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown. And a man with good eyesight were to take it in his hand and check it: ‘This beryl gem is beautiful, genuine, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good qualities.

The reed has been drawn out from the sheath.’ Or suppose a man was to draw a sword out from its scabbard. He would think: ‘This is the sword, this is the scabbard.

Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and they would check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water. If they had a spot they would know ‘I have a spot,’ and if they had no spots they would know ‘I have no spots.’ In the same way, when his mind has become composed like this—purified, bright, flawless, free from, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—he directs and extends it towards the knowledge of comprehension of minds.

I remembered: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and displeasure, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I reappeared somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and displeasure, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I reappeared here.’ And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.

Suppose a man was to leave his home village and go to another village. From that village he would go to yet another village. And from that village he would return to their his village. He would think: ‘I went from my home village to another village. There I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. From that village I went to yet another village.

He would think: ‘This lake is transparent, clear, and unclouded. And here are the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still.’

## 5\. Ajātasattu Declares Himself a Lay Follower

When the Auspicious One had spoken, King Ajātasattu said to him, “Excellent, Bhante! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what is there, the Auspicious One has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Auspicious One, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. From this day forth, may the Auspicious One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.

I have made a mistake, Bhante. It was foolish, obtuse, and unskillful of me to take the life of my father, a just and principled king, for the sake of power. Please, Bhante, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in the future.”

“Indeed, great king, you made a mistake. It was foolish, obtuse, and unskillful of you to take the life of your father, a just and principled king. But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.”

When the Auspicious One had spoken, King Ajātasattu said to him, “Well, now, Bhante, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.”

“Great king, go at your convenience.”

Then the king, having delighted in and expressed appreciation for what the Auspicious One said, arose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled him, keeping him on his right, before leaving.

Soon after the king had left, the Auspicious One addressed the bhikkhus, “The king is broken, bhikkhus, he is ruined. If he had not taken the life of his father, a just and principled king, the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma would have arisen in him in that very seat.”

That is what the Auspicious One said. Pleased, the bhikkhus delighted in what the Auspicious One said.
