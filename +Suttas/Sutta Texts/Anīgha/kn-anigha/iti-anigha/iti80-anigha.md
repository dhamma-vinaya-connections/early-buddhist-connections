# ITI 80 - Thoughts

This was said by the Auspicious One, the Arahant: that is what I heard.

“Bhikkhus, there are these three \[types of\] unbeneficial thoughts. What three? Thoughts connected with reputation, thoughts connected with gain, honor, and popularity, and thoughts of sympathy for others.  These are the three \[types of\] unbeneficial thoughts.”

The Auspicious One spoke this matter. On this it is said:

> “One fettered by reputation, by gain, honor, and respect, sharing joys with friends, is far from destroying the fetters.
> 
> But one who gives up children and livestock, marriage and acquisitions— such a bhikkhu is capable of reaching the supreme awakening.”

This too is a matter that was spoken by the Auspicious One: that is what I heard.
