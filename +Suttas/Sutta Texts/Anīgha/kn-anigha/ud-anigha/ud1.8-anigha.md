# UD 1.8 - With Saṅgāmaji


Thus have I heard. At one time the Auspicious One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time Venerable Saṅgāmaji had arrived at Sāvatthī to see the Auspicious One. His former wife heard that he had arrived, and went to the Jetavana, taking their boy.

Now at that time Venerable Saṅgāmaji was sitting at the root of a tree for the day’s abiding. Then his former wife approached him and said, “Ascetic, please raise this little boy.” When she said this, Venerable Saṅgāmaji kept silent.

For a second time she said, “Ascetic, please raise this little boy.” For a second time, Venerable Saṅgāmaji kept silent.

For a third time she said, “Ascetic, please raise this little boy.” For a third time, Venerable Saṅgāmaji kept silent.

Then she put down the boy in front of Venerable Saṅgāmaji, saying, “This is your child, ascetic. Please raise him.”

But Venerable Saṅgāmaji neither looked at the boy nor spoke to him. Then his former wife went a little distance away. Looking back, she saw Venerable Saṅgāmaji ignoring the boy, and thought, “This ascetic does not even want his child.” She returned to pick up the boy, then left. With the divine eye that is purified and superhuman, the Auspicious One saw how Venerable Saṅgāmaji’s former wife went back for the child.

Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Auspicious One expressed this heartfelt sentiment:

> “When she came he was not glad, when she left he did not grieve. Saṅgāmaji, freed from bonds—  him I call a brahmin.”
