# SNP 4.3 - The Octad on the Corrupt

> Some of corrupt mind will speak; While others speak from truthful mind. The sage does not get into arisen debate, And so, the sage is not fixed anywhere. 
> 
> How to transcend one’s very own view When settled in preference, carried by zeal? One having formed conclusions of his own Could speak just in the way he knows.
> 
> The one who, even unasked, speaks To others of his own practice and virtue Is ignoble in nature, as the skilled say, Declaring himself on his own.
> 
> The calm and self-extinguished bhikkhu Does not boast of his virtue, “I am like this” He, say the skilled, is of noble nature, protruding nowhere in the world.
> 
> Whatever ideas are made and done become polluted with preference: Wherever one sees his own advantage On that he rests his unstable peace.
> 
> It is not easy to surmount the settling in views— The taking up having judged between ideas.  And so, a man among these settlements  In dropping one idea, takes hold of the next. 
> 
> Nowhere in the world has one of clarity A view determined by any state of being. Clarified by giving up deception and conceit, In what way would he, who is disengaged, go?
> 
> One engaged among ideas embarks in debate But how to debate the disengaged – on what grounds? For him, nothing is taken up or let go, He has shaken off all views right here.
