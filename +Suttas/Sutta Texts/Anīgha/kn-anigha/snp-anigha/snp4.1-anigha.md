# SNP 4.1 - Attractions


> A man attracted to attractions— When in that he finds success— Surely becomes joyful, In gaining what he wished.
> 
> But when, for one so attracted— A person with desire aroused— Those attractions abandon him It strikes him like a piercing dart.
> 
> Whoever keeps clear of attractions  As his foot from a snake’s head, The entanglement in the world he mindfully surmounts.
> 
> Whether fields, land, gold or cattle, Horses, slaves, servants, women or family— All varieties of attractions— A man who covets these things,
> 
> Is overpowered by the powerless, And crushed by difficulties; Suffering goes along with him, Like water in a cracked boat. 
> 
> Therefore a person, always mindful, should keep clear of attractions. With these abandoned, he would cross the flood, As one who would reach the far shore, having bailed out the boat.
