# SNP 5.9 - The Questions of Hemaka

> ‘All they explained to me before,’ _said Venerable Hemaka,_ ‘Outside of the teaching of Gotama was “So it was; so it will become.“ All that was pure so-saying; All that was the growth of abstract reasoning, In which I did not delight.
> 
> Rather, sage, tell me the Dhamma, The destruction of craving, Which, having understood it, living recollected, One would cross the entanglement in the world.
> 
> Here, Hemaka, with regard to things seen, heard, thought, or cognized That are held dear— The dispelling of passion and desire there  Is Nibbāna, the unfalling state.
> 
> Those who have understood this, recollected, Are fully extinguished there and then. And always, they are at rest, Beyond entanglement in the world.
