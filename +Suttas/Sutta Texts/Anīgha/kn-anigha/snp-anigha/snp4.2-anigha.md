# SNP 4.2 - The Octad on the Cave

> Imprisoned in a cave, deeply buried, Stands the man who is sunk into ignorance. One like this is truly far from independence, For the pleasures of the world are not easy to give up.
> 
> Confined based on desire by the sweetness in being, Not to be freed by others, they are difficult to free. Now looking behind, now looking ahead, They long for these pleasures and those of before.
> 
> Greedy, absorbed and entranced with pleasures, They are hard to correct, being set in crooked ways. Brought into suffering, they lament: “What will become of us when we fall from here?”
> 
> So a person should train themselves in this way: Whatever they might recognise as crooked in the world, They should not let that cause them to act crookedly, For this life is not long, as the wise would say.
> 
> In this world I see the struggling of this generation Fallen into craving with regard to states of being.  Wretches who wail in the jaws of death, Not rid of craving with regard to various states of being.
> 
> See them struggling in what they regard as “mine”, Like fish in a pool whose stream has dried up. Seeing this, one should live without ownership, Not making attachment to states of being.
> 
> Having removed passion with regard to both ends  And comprehended experience, he cannot covet.  Creating no basis for self-reproach, A wise one is unsoiled in the seen and the heard.
> 
> Having comprehended perception and crossed over the flood, The sage who remains unsoiled by possessions— With the arrow drawn out, living in diligence— Does not yearn for this world or the other.
