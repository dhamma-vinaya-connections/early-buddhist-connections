# SNP 4.4 - The Octad on Purity

> “I see the highest purity, free from illness, A man’s purification is through what is seen.” Recollecting what he has known as the highest, He rests on this knowledge, regards it as pure. 
> 
> If a man’s purity is on account of the seen, Or if it is by knowledge that he abandons suffering, Then he, still with appropriation, is purified by something else—  His own view has denounced him as he speaks like this.
> 
> A brahman does not speak of purity from something else, Whether with regard to the seen, heard, thought, or practised and observed.  He is unaffected in terms of both evil and good, Creating nothing in dropping what was taken up.
> 
> They are embedded in the next, having left what came before; Going by impetus, they cannot get past entrapment. They let go and take up, As a monkey drops one branch to grab hold of another.
> 
> A person undertaking practices on their own terms, Goes high and low, tied up in notions.  But the wise one, knowing through discernment the nature of things, With broad understanding, does not go high and low. 
> 
> He has removed opposition with regard to all things— Whatever is seen, heard, or thought. As he lives transparently seeing like this, By what in the world could one designate him?
> 
> They do not put together or put first; They do not speak of an “utmost purity.”  Having set loose the tangled knot of grasping, They create no longing anywhere in the world.
> 
> For the brahman who has surmounted limits, Nothing known or seen is taken up. Without passion for either passion or dispassion, There is nothing here for him to hold as the highest.
