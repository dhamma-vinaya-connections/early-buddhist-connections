# SNP 4.9 - With Māgandiya

> On seeing Craving, Passion and Lust, Even then there was no sexual desire.  What of this faeces and urine-filled thing? I would not even touch it with my foot!”
> 
> “If you do not want such a jewel— A woman sought-after by many kings— Then what virtue-observance, life, view, And rebirth do you proclaim?”
> 
> “It does not occur to me ‘I proclaim this’— Something taken up having judged between ideas. Maintaining perspective amidst views, not taking up,  I saw, and recognised, internal peace.”
> 
> “When judgements have been made,  Sage, you speak of ‘not taking them up’— Then what does it mean, ‘internal peace’? How is it described by the wise?”
> 
> “Purity is not told by view or knowledge Or in terms of learning, or virtue-observance, Yet not without view, learning, knowledge, Nor again without virtue and observances. Without taking up in letting these go,  One who is calmed without support would not hope for any state of being.” 
> 
> “If purity is not told by view or knowledge Or in terms of learning, or virtue-observance Yet still not without learning, knowledge, view Nor again without virtue and observances, Then I think it all of a muddle, such teaching: Some refer to purity through view.”
> 
> “Questioning on the basis of views, You have fallen into confusion within what you already assumed. You did not glimpse the faintest notion of this, And so you take it as all of a muddle.
> 
> One thinking in terms of equal, or better, Or worse, might argue on such grounds. But when one is unshaken in these three ways, For him there is no ‘equal or better’. 
> 
> Why should a brahman assert ‘This is True!’? Who should he refute, saying ‘This is False!’? Where ‘equal’ or ‘unequal’ do not apply, In whose argument should he participate?
> 
> The household forsaken, a homeless wanderer, In the village the sage does not forge intimacies. Empty of sense desires, without insistence,  He would not quarrel with anyone.
> 
> Living apart from all that is worldly, Without taking it up, the Great would speak. Just as the spiked lotus, water-born, In the mud and in water remains unsoiled, So the sage, affirming peace, free of greed, Remains unsoiled amidst sense pleasures and the world.
> 
> The master of wisdom neither by thought nor by view Can be measured—he is not determined by that. Not led by what is done or what is learned, He is not brought to land in any domain.
> 
> One dispassionate towards perceptions has no ties; One freed through understanding has no confusion. But those who have taken up perceptions and views, Colliding, they go round the world.”
