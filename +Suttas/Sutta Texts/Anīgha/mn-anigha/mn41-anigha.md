# MN 41 - The People of Sālā

Thus have I heard. At one time the Auspicious One was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Sālā.

The brahmins and householders of Sālā heard, “It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—while wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Sālā, together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus. He has this good reputation: ‘That Auspicious One is an Arahant, a Rightly Self-Awakened One, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ Having for himself comprehended and experienced this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—he makes it known to others. He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a renunciate life that is entirely complete and pure. It is good to see such worthy ones.”

Then the brahmins and householders of Sālā approached the Auspicious One. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged pleasantries, some held up their joined palms toward the Auspicious One, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Seated to one side they said to the Auspicious One:

“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some beings, when their body breaks up, after death, reappear in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell? And what is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some beings, when their body breaks up, after death, reappear in a good place, a heavenly realm?”

“Unsuitable conduct, conduct not in line with the Dhamma, is the reason why some beings, when their body breaks up, after death, reappear in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. Principled and moral conduct is the reason why some beings, when their body breaks up, after death, reappear in a good place, a heavenly realm.”

“We do not understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama’s brief statement. Master Gotama, please teach us this matter in detail so we can understand the meaning.”

“Well then, householders, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”

“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Auspicious One said this:

“Householders, unsuitable conduct, conduct not in line with the Dhamma, is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind.

And how is unprincipled and unsuitable conduct threefold by way of body? It is when someone kills living creatures. He is violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living creatures.

He steals. With the intention to commit theft, he takes the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.

He engages in misconduct with regard to sensual pleasures. He has sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. He has sexual relations with a woman who is protected by the Dhamma, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal. This is how unsuitable conduct, conduct not in line with the Dhamma, is threefold by way of body.

And how is unsuitable conduct, conduct not in line with the Dhamma, fourfold by way of speech? It is when someone lies. He is summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, mister, say what you know.’ Not knowing, he says ‘I know.’ Knowing, he says ‘I do not know.’ Not seeing, he says ‘I see.’ And seeing, he says ‘I do not see.’ So he deliberately lies for the sake of himself or another, or for some trivial worldly reason.

They speak divisively. They repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. And so they divide those who are harmonious, supporting division, delighting in division, loving division, speaking words that promote division.

They speak harshly. They use the kinds of words that are cruel, nasty, hurtful, offensive, bordering on anger, not leading to composure.

They engage in frivolous speech. Their speech is untimely, and is neither factual nor beneficial. It has nothing to do with the teaching or the training. Their words have no value, and are untimely, unreasonable, rambling, and pointless. This is how unsuitable conduct, conduct not in line with the Dhamma, is fourfold by way of speech.

And how is unsuitable conduct, conduct not in line with the Dhamma, threefold by way of mind? It is when someone is covetous. He covets the wealth and belongings of others: ‘Oh, if only his belongings were mine!’

He harbors ill will and malicious intentions: ‘May these beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!’

He has wrong view. His perspective is distorted: ‘There is no giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There is no fruit or result of good and bad actions. This world does not exist, nor the other world. There is no mother or father, nor beings that reappear spontaneously. And there is no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who, having comprehended and experienced it for himself, makes known this world and the other.’ This is how unsuitable conduct, conduct not in line with the Dhamma, is threefold by way of mind.

That is how unsuitable conduct, conduct not in line with the Dhamma, is the reason why some beings, when their body breaks up, after death, reappear in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.

Householders, principled and moral conduct is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind.

And how is principled and moral conduct threefold by way of body? It is when someone gives up killing living creatures. He renounces the rod and the sword. He is scrupulous and kind, living compassionate for the welfare of all creatures and beings.

He gives up taking what is not given. He does not, with the intention to commit theft, take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.

He gives up misconduct with regard to sense pleasures. He does not have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. He does not have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal. This is how principled and moral conduct is threefold by way of body.

And how is principled and moral conduct fourfold by way of speech? It is when someone gives up lying. He is summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, sir, say what you know.’ Not knowing, he says ‘I do not know.’ Knowing, he says ‘I know.’ Not seeing, he says ‘I do not see.’ And seeing, he says ‘I see.’ So he does not deliberately lie for the sake of himself or another, or for some trivial worldly reason.

He gives up divisive speech. He does not repeat in one place what he heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, he reconciles those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.

He gives up harsh speech. He speaks in a way that is mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable, and agreeable to the people.

He gives up frivolous speech. His words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching-and-discipline. He says things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial. This is how principled and moral conduct is fourfold by way of speech.

And how is principled and moral conduct threefold by way of mind? It is when someone is not covetous. He does not covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‘Oh, if only his belongings were mine!’

He has a mind free from ill will and of corrupt intentions, thinking: ‘May these beings live free of enmity and affliction, untroubled, and at ease!’

He has right view, undistorted perspective: ‘There is giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad actions. There is this world, and there is the other world. There is mother and father, and beings that reappear spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who, having for themselves comprehended and experienced it, make known this world and the other.’ This is how principled and moral conduct is threefold by way of mind.

This is how principled and moral conduct is the reason why some beings, when their body breaks up, after death, reappear in a good place, a heavenly realm.

One of principled and moral conduct might wish: ‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would reappear in fellowship with well-to-do aristocrats!’ It is possible that this might happen. Why is that? Because he has principled and moral conduct.

One of principled and moral conduct might wish: ‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would reappear in the company of well-to-do brahmins … well-to-do householders … the Gods of the Four Great Kings … the Gods of the Thirty-Three … the Gods of Yama … the Contented Gods … the Gods Who Love to Create … the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others … the Gods of Brahmā’s Host … the Radiant Gods … the Gods of Limited Radiance … the Gods of Limitless Radiance … the Gods of Streaming Radiance … the Gods of Limited Glory … the Gods of Limitless Glory … the Gods Replete with Glory … the Gods of Abundant Fruit … the Gods of Aviha … the Gods of Atappa … the Gods Fair to See … the Fair Seeing Gods … the Gods of Akaniṭṭha … the gods of the extent of infinite space … the gods of the extent of infinite consciousness … the gods of the extent of nothingness … the gods of the extent of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.’ It is possible that this might happen. Why is that? Because he has principled and moral conduct.

One of principled and moral conduct might wish: ‘If only I could, with the destruction of the influxes, abide having entered upon the liberation by mind and liberation by understanding that is devoid of influxes, having for myself comprehended and realized it right in the present experience!’ It is possible that this might happen. Why is that? Because he has principled and moral conduct.”

When he had spoken, the brahmins and householders of Sālā said to the Auspicious One, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what is there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”
