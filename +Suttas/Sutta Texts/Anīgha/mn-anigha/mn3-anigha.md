# MN 3 - Heirs of the Dhamma

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Auspicious One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Auspicious One addressed the bhikkhus, “Bhikkhus!”

“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Auspicious One said this:

“Bhikkhus, be my heirs of the Dhamma, not of material things. Out of compassion for you, I think, ‘How can my disciples become heirs of the Dhamma, not of material things?’

If you become heirs of material things, not of the Dhamma, that will make you liable to reproach: ‘The Teacher’s disciples live as heirs of material things, not of the Dhamma.’ And it will make me liable to reproach: ‘The Teacher’s disciples live as heirs of material things, not of the Dhamma.’

If you become heirs of the Dhamma, not of material things, that will make you not liable to reproach: ‘The Teacher’s disciples live as heirs of the Dhamma, not of material things.’ And it will make me not liable to reproach: ‘The Teacher’s disciples live as heirs of the Dhamma, not of material things.’

So, bhikkhus, be my heirs of the Dhamma, not of material things. Out of compassion for you, I think, ‘How can my disciples become heirs of the Dhamma, not of material things?’

Suppose that I had eaten and refused more food, being full, and having had as much as I needed. And there was some extra almsfood that was going to be thrown away. Then two bhikkhus were to come who were weak with hunger. I would say to them, ‘Bhikkhus, I have eaten and refused more food, being full, and having had as much as I need. And there is this extra almsfood that is going to be thrown away. Eat it if you like. Otherwise, I will discard it where there is little that grows, or drop it into water that has no living creatures.’

Then one of those bhikkhus would think, ‘The Auspicious One has eaten and refused more food. And he has some extra almsfood that will be thrown away. If we do not eat it, he will throw it away. But the Auspicious One has also said: “Be my heirs of the Dhamma, not of material things.” And almsfood is one of the material things. Instead of eating this almsfood, why don’t I spend this day and night weak with hunger?’ And that is what he would do.

Then the second of those bhikkhus would think, ‘The Auspicious One has eaten and refused more food. And he has some extra almsfood that is going to be thrown away. If we do not eat it, he will throw it away. Why don’t I eat this almsfood, then spend the day and night having dispelled my hunger and weakness?’ And that is what he would do.

Even though that bhikkhu, after eating the almsfood, would spend the day and night free from hunger and weakness, it is the former bhikkhu who is more worthy of respect and praise. Why is that? Because for a long time, that will lead to that bhikkhu’s fewness of wishes, contentment, wearing away \[of defilements\], unburdensomeness, and arousal of effort.

So, bhikkhus, be my heirs of the Dhamma, not of material things. Out of compassion for you, I think, ‘How can my disciples become heirs of the Dhamma, not of material things?’”

That is what the Auspicious One said. When he had spoken, the Excellent One arose from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Then soon after the Auspicious One left, Venerable Sāriputta said to the bhikkhus, “Venerable bhikkhus!”

“Venerable,” they replied. Venerable Sāriputta said this:

“Venerables, how do the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion not train in seclusion? And how do they train in seclusion?”

“Venerable, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta. May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this. The bhikkhus will listen and remember it.”

”Well then, venerables, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”

“Yes, venerable,” they replied. Venerable Sāriputta said this:

“Venerables, how do the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion not train in seclusion? The disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion do not train in seclusion. They do not give up what the Teacher tells them to give up. They are indulgent and lax, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion. In this case, the senior bhikkhus should be criticized on three grounds. ‘The disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion do not train in seclusion.’ This is the first ground. ‘They do not give up what the Teacher tells them to give up.’ This is the second ground. ‘They are indulgent and lax, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion.’ This is the third ground. The senior bhikkhus should be criticized on these three grounds. In this case, the middle bhikkhus and the junior bhikkhus should be criticized on the same three grounds. This is how the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion, do not train in seclusion.

And how do the disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion, train in seclusion? The disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion, train in seclusion. They renounce what the Teacher tells them to renounce. They are not indulgent or lax; they neglect backsliding and are leaders in seclusion. In this case, the senior bhikkhus should be praised on three grounds. ‘The disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion train in seclusion.’ This is the first ground. ‘They renounce what the Teacher tells them to renounce.’ This is the second ground. ‘They are not indulgent or lax; they neglect backsliding and are leaders in seclusion.’ This is the third ground. The senior bhikkhus should be praised on these three grounds. In this case, the middle bhikkhus and the junior bhikkhus should be praised on the same three grounds. This is how the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion train in seclusion.

Venerables, what is harmful is greed and aversion. There is a middle way of practice for abandoning greed and aversion. It gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and Nibbāna. And what is that middle way of practice? It is simply this Noble Eightfold Path, that is: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right recollectedness, and right composure. This is that middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and Nibbāna.

Venerables, what is harmful is anger and resentment. … denigration and contentiousness … jealousy and stinginess … deceit and deviousness … obstinacy and insolence … conceit and arrogance … indulgence and carelessness. There is a middle way of practice for giving up indulgence and carelessness. It gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and Nibbāna. And what is that middle way of practice? It is simply this Noble Eightfold Path, that is: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right recollectedness, and right composure. This is that middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and Nibbāna.”

This is what Venerable Sāriputta said. Pleased, the bhikkhus delighted in what Venerable Sāriputta said.
