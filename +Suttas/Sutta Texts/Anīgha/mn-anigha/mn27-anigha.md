# MN 27 - The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint

Thus have I heard. At one time the Auspicious One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.

Now at that time the brahmin Jānussoṇi drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day in an all-white chariot drawn by mares. He saw the wanderer Pilotika coming off in the distance, and said to him, “So, Master Vacchāyana, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”

“Just now, good sir, I have come from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.”

“What do you think of the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of understanding? Do you think he is wise?”

“My good man, who am I to judge the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of understanding? You would really have to be on the same level to judge his lucidity of understanding.”

“Master Vacchāyana praises the ascetic Gotama with lofty praise indeed.”

“Who am I to praise the ascetic Gotama? He is praised by the praised as the first among gods and humans.”

“But for what reason are you so devoted to the ascetic Gotama?”

“Suppose that a skilled bull elephant tracker was to enter a bull elephant wood. There he would see a large elephant’s footprint, long and broad. He would come to the conclusion, ‘This must be a big bull elephant.’

In the same way, because I saw four footprints of the ascetic Gotama I came to the conclusion, ‘The Auspicious One is a Rightly Self-Awakened One. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’

What four? Firstly, I see some wise aristocrats who are astute, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. You would think they live to demolish views with their understanding. They hear, ‘So, gentlemen, that ascetic Gotama will come down to such and such village or town.’ They formulate a question, thinking, ‘We will approach the ascetic Gotama and ask him this question. If he answers like this, we will refute him like that; and if he answers like that, we will refute him like this.’

When they hear that he has come down they approach him. The ascetic Gotama instructs, encourages, fires up, and inspires them with a Dhamma talk. They do not even get around to asking their question to the ascetic Gotama, so how could they refute his answer? Invariably, they become his disciples. When I saw this first footprint of the ascetic Gotama, I came to the conclusion, ‘The Auspicious One is a Rightly Self-Awakened One. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’

Furthermore, I see some wise brahmins … some wise householders … they become his disciples.

Furthermore, I see some wise ascetics who are astute, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters … They do not even get around to asking their question to the ascetic Gotama, so how could they refute his answer? Invariably, they ask the ascetic Gotama for the chance to go forth. And he gives them the going-forth. Soon after going forth, abiding withdrawn, heedful, diligent, and resolute, they abide having entered upon the supreme goal of the renunciate life for which clansmen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness, having for themselves comprehended and realized it right in the present experience.

They say, ‘We were almost lost! We almost perished! For we used to claim that we were ascetics, brahmins, and Arahants, but we were none of these things. But now we really are ascetics, brahmins, and Arahants!’ When I saw this fourth footprint of the ascetic Gotama, I came to the conclusion, ‘The Auspicious One is a Rightly Self-Awakened One. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’

It is because I saw these four footprints of the ascetic Gotama that I came to the conclusion, ‘The Auspicious One is a Rightly Self-Awakened One. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’”

When he had spoken, Jānussoṇi got down from his chariot, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms towards the Auspicious One, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times:

“Homage to that Auspicious One, the Arahant, the Rightly Self-Awakened One!

Homage to that Auspicious One, the Arahant, the Rightly Self-Awakened One!

Homage to that Auspicious One, the Arahant, the Rightly Self-Awakened One!

Hopefully, some time or other I will get to meet Master Gotama, and we can have a discussion.”

Then the brahmin Jānussoṇi approached the Auspicious One, and exchanged pleasantries with him. When the amicable and cordial talk was over, he sat down to one side, and informed the Auspicious One of all he had discussed with the wanderer Pilotika.

When he had spoken, the Auspicious One said to him, “Brahmin, the simile of the elephant’s footprint is not yet completed in detail. As to how it is completed in detail, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”

“Yes sir,” Jānussoṇi replied. The Auspicious One said this:

“Suppose a bull elephant tracker were to enter a bull elephant wood. There he would see a large elephant’s footprint, long and broad. A skilled bull elephant tracker does not yet come to the conclusion, ‘This must be a big bull elephant.’ Why not? Because in an elephant wood there are dwarf cow elephants with big footprints, and this footprint might be one of theirs.

He keeps following the track until he sees a big footprint, long and broad, and traces high up. A skilled bull elephant tracker does not yet come to the conclusion, ‘This must be a big bull elephant.’ Why not? Because in an elephant wood, there are tall lofty cow elephants with big footprints, and this footprint might be one of theirs.

He keeps following the track until he sees a big footprint, long and broad, and traces and tusk-marks high up. A skilled bull elephant tracker does not yet come to the conclusion, ‘This must be a big bull elephant.’ Why not? Because in an elephant wood, there are tall matriarch cow elephants with big footprints, and this footprint might be one of theirs.

He keeps following the track until he sees a big footprint, long and broad, and traces, tusk-marks, and broken branches high up. And he sees that bull elephant walking, standing, sitting, or lying down at the root of a tree or in the open. Then he would come to the conclusion, ‘This is that big bull elephant.’

In the same way, brahmin, a Realized One arises in the world, an Arahant, a Rightly Self-Awakened One, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. Having for himself comprehended and experieced this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—he makes it known to others. He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a renunciate life that is entirely complete and pure.

A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s son, or someone born in some good family. He gains faith in the Realized One, and reflects: ‘Household life is confined and dusty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. It is not easy for someone living at home to lead the renunciate life utterly complete and pure, like a polished shell. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ After some time, he gives up a large or small fortune and a large or small family circle. He shaves off hair and beard, dresses in ocher robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness.

Once he is gone forth, he takes up the training and livelihood of the bhikkhus. He gives up and abstains from killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. He is scrupulous and kind, living compassionate for the welfare of all creatures and beings.

He gives up and abstains from taking what is not given. He takes only what is given, and expects only what is given. He keeps himself clean by not thieving.

He gives up and abstains from incelibacy. He is celibate, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex.

He gives up and abstains from lying. He speaks the truth and sticks to the truth. He is honest and trustworthy, and does not trick the world with his words.

He gives up and abstains from divisive speech. He does not repeat in one place what he heard in another to divide people against each other. Instead, he reconciles those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, enjoying harmony, and speaking words that promote harmony.

He gives up and abstains from harsh speech. He speaks in a way that is gentle, pleasing to the ear, affectionate, going to the heart, polite, likable, and agreeable to the people.

He gives up and abstains from frivolous speech. His words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching-and-discipline. He says things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.

He abstains from violence towards plants and seeds. He eats in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and at the wrong time. He abstains from dancing, singing, music, and watching shows. He abstains from beautifying and adorning himself with garlands, perfumes, and makeup. He abstains from high and luxurious beds. He abstains from receiving gold and money, raw grains, raw meat, women and girls, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants, cows, horses, and mares, and fields and land. He abstains from running errands and messages; buying and selling; falsifying weights, metals, or measures; bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity; mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence.

He is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever he goes, he sets out taking only these things. He is like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. In the same way, the bhikkhu is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever he goes, he sets out taking only these things. Possessed of this noble aggregate of virtue, he experiences a blameless ease internally.

Having seen a sight with the eye, he does not grasp at signs and features of it on account of which—due to abiding with the eye faculty unrestrained—bad, unbeneficial thoughts of longing and upset would flow in on him. He practices to restrain that; he guards the eye faculty and brings about the restraint of the eye faculty.  Having heard a sound with the ear … Having smelled an odor with the nose … Having tasted a flavor with the tongue … Having touched a touch with the body … Having cognized a phenomenon with the mental faculty, he does not grasp at signs and features of it  on account of which—due to abiding with the mental faculty unrestrained—bad, unbeneficial thoughts of longing and upset would flow in on him. He practices to restrain that; he guards the mental faculty and brings about the restraint of the mental faculty. Possessed of this noble sense restraint, he experiences an unsullied ease internally.

He acts with awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.

Possessed of this noble aggregate of virtue, this noble contentment, this noble sense restraint, and this noble recollectedness-and-awareness, he frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.

After the meal, he returns from almsround, sits down cross-legged, sets his body straight, and establishes recollectedness at the fore. With the giving up of longing with regard to the world, he abides with a mind rid of longing; he cleanses the mind of longing. With the giving up of ill will and hatred, he abides with a mind rid of ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all creatures and beings; he cleanses the mind of ill will and hatred. With the giving up of indolence-and-lethargy, he abides with a mind rid of indolence-and-lethargy, perceiving light, recollected, and aware; he cleanses the mind of indolence-and-lethargy. With the giving up of restlessness-and-anxiety, he abides without restlessness, his mind internally appeased; he cleanses the mind of restlessness-and-anxiety. With the giving up of doubt, he abides having gone beyond doubt, not uncertain about beneficial qualities; he cleanses the mind of doubt.

He gives up these five hindrances, defilements of the mind that weaken understanding. Then, having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality, having withdrawn from unbeneficial phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of withdrawal, he abides having entered upon the first jhāna. This, brahmin, is that which is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ and also ‘a trace of the Realized One’ and also ‘a mark of the Realized One’. But a noble disciple does not yet come to the conclusion, ‘The Auspicious One is a Rightly Self-Awakened One. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’

Furthermore, with the appeasement of thinking and pondering, with internal confidence and collectedness of mind, without thinking or pondering and with joy and ease born of composure, the bhikkhu abides having entered upon the second jhāna. This too is what is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ …

Furthermore, with the fading of joy, he abides equanimous, recollected and aware, experiencing ease with the body. The bhikkhu abides having entered upon the third jhāna, with regard to which the noble ones say “one abides equanimous, recollected, and at ease.’ This too is what is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ …

Furthermore, with the giving up of ease and unease—and with the ending of joys and upsets beforehand—without ease or unease, with purity of equanimity and recollectedness, the bhikkhu abides having entered upon the fourth jhāna. This too is what is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ …

When his mind has become composed like this—purified, bright, flawless, free from, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—he extends it towards the knowledge of recollectedness of past lives. He recollects many kinds of past lives, that is, one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand births; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding … He recollects his many kinds of past lives, with features and details. This too is what is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ …

When his mind has become composed like this—purified, bright, flawless, free from, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—he extends it towards the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings. With divine eye that is purified and superhuman … he understands how beings reappear according to their actions. This too is what is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ …

When his mind has become composed like this—purified, bright, flawless, free from, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—he extends it towards the knowledge of the destruction of the influxes. He understands as it is: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’ He understands as it is: ‘These are influxes’ … ‘This is the origin of influxes’ … ‘This is the cessation of influxes’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of influxes.’ This, brahmin, is what is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ and also ‘a trace of the Realized One’ and also ‘a mark of the Realized One’. At this point a noble disciple has not yet come to a conclusion, but he is coming to the conclusion, ‘The Auspicious One is a Rightly Self-Awakened One. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’

Knowing and seeing like this, his mind is liberated from the influxes of sensuality, being, and ignorance. When it is liberated, he knows it is liberated.

He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the renunciate life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there will be no more of this.’ This, brahmin, is what is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ and also ‘a trace of the Realized One’ and also ‘a mark of the Realized One’. At this point a noble disciple has come to the conclusion, ‘The Auspicious One is a Rightly Self-Awakened One. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’ And it is at this point that the simile of the elephant’s footprint has been completed in detail.”

When he had spoken, the brahmin Jānussoṇi said to the Auspicious One, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyesight can see what is there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
