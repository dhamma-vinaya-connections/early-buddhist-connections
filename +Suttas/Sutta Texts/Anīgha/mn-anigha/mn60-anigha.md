# MN 60 - Unfailing

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Auspicious One was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus, when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Sālā.

The brahmins and householders of Sālā heard:

“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Sālā, together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus. He has this good reputation: ‘That Auspicious One is an Arahant, a Rightly Self-Awakened One, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ Having for himself comprehended and experienced this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods, and humans—, he makes it known to others. He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a renunciate life that is entirely complete and pure. It is good to see such Arahants.”

Then the brahmins and householders of Sālā approached the Auspicious One. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged pleasantries, some held up their joined palms toward the Auspicious One, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. The Auspicious One said to them:

“So, householders, is there any teacher you are pleased with, in whom you have acquired grounded faith?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Since you have not found a teacher you are pleased with, you should undertake and implement this unfailing teaching. For when the unfailing teaching is undertaken, it will be for your lasting welfare and happiness. And what is the unfailing teaching?

There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘There is no giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There is no fruit or result of good and bad actions. This world does not exist, nor the other world. There is no mother or father, nor beings that reappear spontaneously. And there is no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who, having comprehended and experienced it for himself, makes known this world and the other.’

And there are some ascetics and brahmins whose doctrine directly contradicts this. They say: ‘There is giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad actions. There is this world, and there is the other world. There is mother and father, and beings that reappear spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who, having for themselves comprehended and experienced it, make known this world and the other.’ 

What do you think, householders? Do these doctrines not directly contradict each other?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Since this is so, consider those ascetics and brahmins whose view is that there is no giving, and so forth. One may expect that they will reject good conduct by way of body, speech, and thought, and undertake and implement bad conduct by way of body, speech, and thought. Why is that? Because those ascetics and brahmins do not see the peril, inferiority, and defilement of unbeneficial qualities, nor the benefit and cleansing aspect of renunciation.

There actually being another world, an individual’s view is that there is not; that is wrong view on their part. There actually being another world, they intend as if there is not; that is wrong intention on their part. There actually being another world, they speak words as if there is not; that is wrong speech on their part. There actually being another world, they state “there is no other world”, thereby contradicting those Arahants who know the other world. There actually being another world, they convince another that there is not, thereby convincing them of an untrue teaching. And on account of that convincing, they exalt themselves and belittle others. In this way, they gave up their former virtue and became established in unvirtue. And thus these many bad, unbeneficial qualities exist supported by wrong view—wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, contradicting the noble ones, convincing others to accept untrue teachings, and exalting oneself and belittling others.

A wise man reflects on this matter in this way: ‘If there is no other world, then on the dissolution of the body, they will keep themselves safe. And if there is another world, then on the dissolution of the body, after death, they will reappear in a place of loss, a wretched place, the underworld, hell. But let us grant that those who say that there is no other world are correct. Regardless, that individual is still criticized by the wise in the present life as being an unvirtuous individual of wrong view, a nihilist.’ But if there truly is another world, they hold a losing hand on both counts. For they are criticized by the wise in the present life, and on the dissolution of the body, after death, they will reappear in a place of loss, a wretched place, the underworld, hell. They have wrongly undertaken this unfailing teaching in such a way that it encompasses the outcomes of one side only, omitting the beneficial side.

Since this is so, consider those ascetics and brahmins whose view is that there is giving, etc. One can expect that they will reject bad conduct by way of body, speech, and thought, and undertake and implement good conduct by way of body, speech, and thought. Why is that? Because those ascetics and brahmins see the peril, inferiority, and defilement of unbeneficial qualities, and the benefit and cleansing aspect of renunciation.

There actually being another world, an individual’s view is that there is; that is right view on their part. There actually being another world, they intend as if there is; that is right intention on their part. There actually being another world, they speak as if there is; that is right speech on their part. There actually being another world, they state “there is another world”, thereby not contradicting those Arahants who know the other world. There actually being another world, they convince another that there is, thereby convincing them of an true teaching. And on account of that convincing, they do not exalt themselves or disparage others. In this way, they gave upon their former unvirtue and became established in virtue. And that is how these many beneficial qualities exist supported by right view—right view, right intention, right speech, not contradicting the noble ones, convincing others to accept true teachings, and not exalting oneself and disparaging others.

A wise man reflects on this matter in this way: ‘If there is another world, then on the dissolution of the body, they will reappear in a good place, a heavenly realm. But let us grant that those who say that there is no other world are correct. Regardless, that individual is still praised by the wise in the present life, as being a virtuous individual of right view, who holds a doctrine of affirmation.’ So, if there really is another world, they hold a perfect hand on both counts. For they are praised by the wise in the present life, and on the dissolution of the body, after death, they will reappear in a good place, a heavenly realm. They have rightly undertaken this unfailing teaching in such a way that it encompasses the outcomes of both sides, leaving out the unbeneficial premise.

There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘The one who acts does nothing wrong when they punish, mutilate, torture, aggrieve, oppress, intimidate, or when they encourage others to do the same. They do nothing wrong when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie. If someone were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razor-edged chakram, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil. If someone were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, mutilating, and torturing, and encouraging others to do the same, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil. If someone were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving, sacrificing, and encouraging others to do the same, no merit comes of that, and no outcome of merit. In giving, self-control, restraint, and truthfulness there is no merit or outcome of merit.’

And there are some ascetics and brahmins whose doctrine directly contradicts this. They say: ‘The one who acts does evil when they punish, mutilate, torture, aggrieve, oppress, intimidate, or when they encourage others to do the same. They do evil when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie. If someone were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razor-edged chakram, evil comes of that, and an outcome of evil. If someone were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, mutilating, torturing, and encouraging others to do the same, evil comes of that, and an outcome of evil. If someone were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving, sacrificing, and encouraging others to do the same, merit comes of that, and an outcome of merit. In giving, self-control, restraint, and truthfulness there is merit and outcome of merit.’

What do you think, householders? Do these doctrines not directly contradict each other?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Since this is so, consider those ascetics and brahmins whose view is that the one who acts does nothing wrong when they punish, etc. You can expect that they will reject good conduct by way of body, speech, and thought, and undertake and implement bad conduct by way of body, speech, and thought. Why is that? Because those ascetics and brahmins do not see the peril, inferiority, and defilement of unbeneficial qualities, nor the benefit and cleansing aspect of renunciation.

There actually being action, an individual’s view is that there is not; that is wrong view on their part. There actually being action, they intend as if there is not; that is wrong intention on their part. There actually being action, they speak words as if there is not; that is wrong speech on their part. There actually being action, they state “there is no action”, thereby contradicting those Arahants who affirm action. There actually being action, they convince another that there is not, thereby convincing them of an untrue teaching. And on account of that convincing, they exalt themselves and puts others down. In this way, they gave up their former virtue and became established in unvirtue. And that is how these many bad, unbeneficial qualities exist supported by wrong view—wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, contradicting the noble ones, convincing others to accept untrue teachings, and exalting oneself and disparaging others.

A wise man reflects on this matter in this way: ‘If there is no action, then on the dissolution of the body, they will keep themselves safe. And if there is action, then on the dissolution of the body, after death, they will reappear in a place of loss, a wretched place, the underworld, hell. But let us grant that those who say that there is no action are correct. Regardless, that individual is still criticized by the wise in the present life as being an unvirtuous individual of wrong view, one who denies action.’ But if there truly is action, they hold a losing hand on both counts. For they are criticized by the wise in the present life, and on the dissolution of the body, after death, they will reappear in a place of loss, a wretched place, the underworld, hell. They have wrongly undertaken this unfailing teaching in such a way that it encompasses the outcomes of one side only, omitting the beneficial side.

Since this is so, consider those ascetics and brahmins whose view is that the one who acts does evil when they punish, etc. One may expect that they will reject misconduct by way of body, speech, and thought, and undertake and implement good conduct by way of body, speech, and thought. Why is that? Because those ascetics and brahmins see the peril, inferiority, and defilement of unbeneficial qualities, and the benefit and cleansing aspect of renunciation.

There actually being action, an individual’s view is that there is; that is right view on their part. There actually being action, they intend as if there is; that is right intention on their part.

In this way, they gave up their former unvirtue and became established in virtue. And that is how these many beneficial qualities exist supported by right view—right view, right intention, right speech, not contradicting the noble ones, convincing others to accept true teachings, and not exalting oneself and disparaging others.

A wise man reflects on this matter in this way: ‘If there is action, then on the dissolution of the body, after death, they will reappear in a good place, a heavenly realm. But let us grant that those who say that there is no effective action are correct. Regardless, that individual is still praised by the wise in the present life as being a virtuous individual of right view, who affirms the existence of action.’ So if there really is action, they hold a perfect hand on both counts. For they are praised by the wise in the present life, and on the dissolution of the body, after death, they will reappear in a good place, a heavenly realm. They have rightly undertaken this unfailing teaching in such a way that it encompasses the outcomes of both sides, omitting the unbeneficial premise.

There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘There is no cause or reason for the defilement of beings. Beings are defiled without cause or reason. There is no cause or reason for the purification of beings. Beings are purified without cause or reason. There is no power, no effort, no manly fortitude or striving. All beings, all living creatures, all beings, all souls lack control, power, and effort. Molded by destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of births.’ 

And there are some ascetics and brahmins whose doctrine directly contradicts this. They say: ‘There is a cause and reason for the defilement of beings. Beings are defiled with cause and reason. There is a cause and reason for the purification of beings. Beings are purified with cause and reason. There is power, effort, manly fortitude and striving. It is not the case that all beings, all living creatures, all beings, all souls lack control, power, and effort, or that, molded by destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of births.’

What do you think, householders? Do not these doctrines directly contradict each other?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Since this is so, consider those ascetics and brahmins whose view is that there is no cause or reason for the defilement of beings, and so forth. It is to be expected that they will reject good conduct by way of body, speech, and thought, and undertake and implement bad conduct by way of body, speech, and thought. Why is that? Because those ascetics and brahmins do not see the peril, inferiority, and defilement of unbeneficial qualities, nor the benefit and cleansing aspect of renunciation.

There actually being a cause \[for the defilement of beings\], an individual’s view is that there is not; that is wrong view on their part. There actually being a cause, they intend as if there is not; that is wrong intention on their part. There actually being a cause, they speak words as if there is not; that is wrong speech on their part. There actually being a cause, they state “there is no cause”, thereby contradicting those Arahants who affirm a cause. There actually being a cause, they convince another that there is not, thereby convincing them of an untrue teaching. And on account of that convincing, they exalt themselves and disparage others. In this way, they relinquished their former virtue and became established in unvirtue. And that is how, these many detrimental, unbeneficial qualities exist supported by wrong view—wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, contradicting the noble ones, convincing others to accept untrue teachings, and exalting oneself and disparaging others.

A wise man reflects on this matter in this way: ‘If there is no cause \[for the defilement of beings\], then on the dissolution of the body, they will keep themselves safe.

They have wrongly undertaken this unfailing teaching in such a way that it encompasses the outcomes of one side only, omitting the beneficial premise.

Since this is so, consider those ascetics and brahmins whose view is that there is a cause and reason for the defilement of sentient beings, and so forth. It is to be expected that they will reject bad conduct by way of body, speech, and thought, and undertake and implement good conduct by way of body, speech, and thought. Why is that? Because those ascetics and brahmins see the peril, inferiority, and defilement of unbeneficial qualities, and the benefit and cleansing aspect of renunciation.

There actually being a cause, they state “there is a cause”, thereby not contradicting those Arahants who affirm a cause. There actually being a cause, they convince another that there is, thereby convincing them of an true teaching. And on account of that convincing, they do not exalt themselves or disparage others. In this way, they gave up their former unvirtue and became established in virtue.

But let us grant that those who say that there is no cause are correct. Regardless, that individual is still praised by the wise in the present life as being a virtuous individual of right view, who affirms causality.’ So, if there truly is a cause, they hold a perfect hand on both counts. For they are praised by the wise in the present life, and on the dissolution of the body, after death, they will reappear in a good place, a heavenly realm. They have rightly undertaken this unfailing teaching in such a way that it encompasses the outcomes of both sides, omitting the unbeneficial side.

There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘There are no totally formless states.’

And there are some ascetics and brahmins whose doctrine directly contradicts this. They say: ‘There are totally formless states.’

What do you think, householders? Do these doctrines not directly contradict each other?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

A wise man reflects on this matter in this way: ‘Some ascetics and brahmins say that there are no totally formless states, but I have not perceived that. Some ascetics and brahmins say that there are totally formless states, but I have not known that. Without knowing or seeing, it would not be appropriate for me to take one side and declare, ‘Only this is the truth, everything else is foolish.’ If those ascetics and brahmins who say that there are no totally formless states are correct, it is still certainly possible that I will reappear among the gods who possess form and are made of mind. If those ascetics and brahmins who say that there are totally formless states are correct, then it is certainly possible that I will reappear among the gods who are formless and made of perception. Now, owing to form, things like taking up the rod and the sword, quarrels, arguments, and disputes, accusations, divisive speech, and lies are seen. But those things do not exist where it is totally formless.’ Reflecting like this, they simply practice for disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation regarding form.

There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘There is no such thing as the total cessation of being.’

And there are some ascetics and brahmins whose doctrine directly contradicts this. They say: ‘There is such a thing as the total cessation of being.’

What do you think, householders? Do these doctrines not directly contradict each other?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

A wise man reflects on this matter in this way: ‘Some ascetics and brahmins say that there is no such thing as the total cessation of being, but I have not seen that. Some ascetics and brahmins say that there is such a thing as the total cessation of being, but I have not known that. Without knowing or seeing, it would not be appropriate for me to take one side and declare, ‘Only this is the truth, everything else is foolish.’ If those ascetics and brahmins who say that there is no such thing as the total cessation of being are correct, it is possible that I will reappear among the gods who are formless and made of perception. If those ascetics and brahmins who say that there is such a thing as the total cessation of being are correct, it is possible that I will be fully extinguished right in the present experience. The view of those ascetics and brahmins who say that there is no such thing as the total cessation of being is close to passion, yoking, relishing, resting-upon, and grasping. The view of those ascetics and brahmins who say that there is such a thing as the total cessation of being is close to non-passion, non-yoking, non-relishing, not resting-upon, and non-grasping.’ Reflecting like this, they simply practice for disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation of states of being.

Householders, these four people are found in the world.  What four?

1.  One individual mortifies themselves, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves.
2.  One individual mortifies others, committed to the practice of mortifying others.
3.  One individual mortifies themselves and others, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others.
4.  One individual does not mortify neither themselves nor others, committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves nor others. They live desireless right in the present experience, extinguished, cooled, feeling at ease, having themselves become divine.

And what individual mortifies themselves, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves? It is when a person goes naked, ignoring conventions. … And so, they live committed to these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body. This is called an individual who mortifies themselves and is committed to the practice of mortifying themselves.

And what individual mortifies others, committed to the practice of mortifying others? It is when an individual is a slaughterer of sheep, pigs, or poultry, a hunter or trapper, a fisher, a bandit, an executioner, a butcher, a jailer, or someone with some other kind of cruel livelihood. This is called an individual who mortifies others, being committed to the practice of mortifying others.

And what individual mortifies themselves and others, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others? It is when an individual is an anointed aristocratic king or an affluent brahmin. … His bondservants, servants, and workers perform their duties under threat of punishment and danger, weeping, with tearful faces. This is called an individual who mortifies themselves and others, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others.

And what individual does not mortify neither themselvesnor others, committed to the practice of not mortifying neither themselves nor others, living desireless right in the present experience, extinguished, cooled, feeling at ease, having themselves become divine?

It is when a Realized One arises in the world, an Arahant, a Rightly Self-Awakened One … A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s son, or someone born in some good family. … He gives up these five hindrances, defilements of the mind that weaken understanding. Then, having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality, having withdrawn from unbeneficial phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of withdrawal, he abides having entered upon the first jhāna. second jhāna … third jhāna … fourth jhāna.

When his mind has become composed like this—purified, bright, flawless, free from defilements, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—he extends it towards the knowledge of recollecting of past lives. He recollects many kinds of past lives, that is, one birth, two births … He recollects his many kinds of past lives, with features and details.

When his mind has become composed like this—purified, bright, flawless, free from defilements, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—he extends it towards the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings. With the divine eye that is purified and superhuman, he sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how beings reappear according to their actions.

When his mind has become composed like this—purified, bright, flawless, free from defilements, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—he extends it towards the knowledge of the destruction of the influxes. He understands as it is: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’ He understands as it is: ‘These are influxes’ … ‘This is the origin of influxes’ … ‘This is the cessation of influxes’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of influxes.’ Knowing and seeing like this, his mind is liberated from the influxes of sensuality, being, and ignorance. When it is liberated, he knows it is liberated.

He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the renunciate life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there will be no more of this.’

This is called an individual who neither mortifies themselves nor others, being committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves nor others. They live desireless right in the present experience, extinguished, cooled, feeling at ease, having themselves become divine.

When he had spoken, the brahmins and householders of Sālā said to the Auspicious One, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what is there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the bhikkhu Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”
