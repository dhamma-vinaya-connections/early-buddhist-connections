# MN 134 - Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night


Thus have I heard. At one time, the Auspicious One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.

Now at that time, Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya was staying in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.

Then, late at night, the glorious god Candana, lighting up the entire Banyan Tree Monastery, approached the Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, he said to Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya:

“Bhikkhu, do you remember the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine Night?”

“No, venerable, I do not. Do you?”

“I also do not. But do you remember just the verses on One Fine Night?”

“I do not. Do you?”

“I do.”

“How do you remember the verses on One Fine Night?”

“On this occasion, the Auspicious One was staying among the gods of the Thirty-Three at the root of the Shady Orchid Tree on the stone spread with a cream rug. There he taught the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine Night to the gods of the Thirty-Three:

> ‘Do not run back to the past, do not long for the future. What is past is left behind; the future has not arrived.
> 
> Whatever phenomenon is presently arisen  is clearly seen right there.  Knowing this, foster it— unfaltering, unshakable.
> 
> Today is the day to work diligently— who knows, tomorrow may bring death! For there is no bargain to be struck with Death and his mighty hordes.
> 
> The peaceful sage explained it is those who diligently abide like this, tireless all day and night,  who truly have one fine night.’

That is how I remember the verses of One Fine Night. Learn the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine Night, bhikkhu, memorize it, and remember it. It is beneficial and is fundamental to the renunciate life.” 

That is what the god Candana said before vanishing right there.

Then Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Sāvatthī. Eventually, he came to Sāvatthī and Jeta’s Grove. He approached the Auspicious One, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed him of the matter. Then, he added:

“Venerable sir, please teach me the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine night.”

“But bhikkhu, do you know that god?”

“I do not, venerable sir.”

“That god was named Candana. Candana pays attention, applies the mind, focuses wholeheartedly, and actively listens to the teaching. Well then, bhikkhu, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”

“Yes, venerable sir”, Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya replied. The Auspicious One said this:

> “Do not run back to the past, do not long for the future. What is past is left behind; the future has not arrived.
> 
> Whatever phenomenon is presently arisen is clearly seen right there. Knowing this, foster it— unfaltering, unshakable.
> 
> Today is the time to work diligently— who knows, tomorrow may bring death! For there is no bargain to be struck with Death and his mighty hordes.
> 
> The peaceful sage explained it is those who diligently abide like this, tireless all day and night, who truly have one fine night.’

And how does one run back to the past? Thinking, ‘I had such form … feeling … perception … activities … consciousness in the past,’ one musters delight there.

That is how one runs back to the past.

And how does one not run back to the past? Thinking, ‘I had such form … feeling … perception … activities … consciousness in the past,’ one does not muster delight there. 

That is how one does not run back to the past.

And how does one long for the future?  Thinking, ‘May I have such form … feeling … perception … activities … consciousness in the future,’ one musters delight there. 

That is how one longs for the future.

And how does one not long for the future?  Thinking, ‘May I have such form … feeling … perception … activities … consciousness in the past,’ one does not muster delight there.

That is how one does not long for the future.

And how does one falter amid presently arisen phenomena? It is when an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They have not seen the righteous men, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the righteous men. They regard form as self, self as possessing form, form in self, or self in form. They regard feeling … perception … activities … consciousness as self, self as possessing consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. 

That is how one falters amid presently arisen phenomena.

And how does one not falter amid presently arisen phenomena? It is when a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They have seen the righteous men, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the righteous men. They do not regard form as self, self as possessing form, form in self, or self in form. They do not regard feeling … perception … activities … consciousness as self, self as possessing consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.

That is how one does not falter amid presently arisen phenomena.

That is what the Auspicious One said. Pleased, Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya delighted in what the Auspicious One said.
