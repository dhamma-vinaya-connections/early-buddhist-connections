# MN 45 - The Shorter Discourse on Undertakings

Thus have I heard. At one time the Auspicious One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Auspicious One addressed the bhikkhus, “Bhikkhus!”

“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Auspicious One said this:

“Bhikkhus, there are these four undertakings. What four? There is an undertaking that is pleasant now but results in future pain. There is an undertaking that is painful now and results in future pain. There is an undertaking that is painful now but results in future pleasure. There is an undertaking that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure.

And what is the undertaking that is pleasant now but results in future pain? There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘There is nothing wrong with sensuality.’ They throw themselves into sensuality, frolicking with female wanderers with jeweled bands in their hair. They say, ‘What future danger do those ascetics and brahmins see in sensuality that they speak of giving up sensuality, and advocate the complete understanding of sensuality? Pleasant is the touch of this female wanderer’s arm, tender, soft, and downy!’ And they throw themselves into sensuality. When their body breaks up, after death, they reappear in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings. They say, ‘This is that future danger that those ascetics and brahmins saw. For it is because of sensuality that I am feeling painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings.’

Suppose that in the last month of summer a camel’s foot creeper pod were to burst open and a seed were to fall at the root of a sal tree. Then the deity haunting that sal tree would become apprehensive and nervous. But their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin—deities of the parks, forests, trees, and those who haunt the herbs, grass, and big trees—would come together to reassure them, ‘Do not fear, sir, do not fear! Hopefully that seed will be swallowed by a peacock, or eaten by a deer, or burnt by a forest fire, or picked up by a lumberjack, or eaten by termites, or it may not even be fertile.’ But none of these things happened. And the seed was fertile, so that when the clouds soaked it with rain, it sprouted. And the creeper wound its tender, soft, and downy tendrils around that sal tree. Then the deity thought, ‘What future danger did my friends see when they said: ‘Do not fear, sir, do not fear! Hopefully that seed will be swallowed by a peacock, or eaten by a deer, or burnt by a forest fire, or picked up by a lumberjack, or eaten by termites, or it may not even be fertile.’ Pleasant is the touch of this creeper’s tender, soft, and downy tendrils.’ Then the creeper enfolded the sal tree, made a canopy over it, draped a curtain around it, and split apart all the main branches. Then the deity thought, ‘This is the future danger that my friends saw! It is because of that camel’s foot creeper seed that I am feeling painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings.’

In the same way, there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘There is nothing wrong with sensuality’ … This is called the undertaking that is pleasant now but results in future pain.

And what is the undertaking that is painful now and results in future pain? It is when someone goes naked, ignoring conventions. He licks his hands, and does not come or wait when called. He does not consent to food brought to him, or food prepared on his behalf, or an invitation for a meal. He does not receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in his home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who has a man in her home; or where there is a dog waiting or flies buzzing. He accepts no fish or meat or liquor or wine, and drinks no beer. He goes to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls. He feeds on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day. He eats once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. He lives committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals.

He eats herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. He survives on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.

He wears robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings. He tears out his hair and beard, committed to this practice. He constantly stands, refusing seats. He squats, committed to persisting in the squatting position. He lies on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns his bed. He is committed to the practice of immersing in water three times a day, including the evening. And so he lives committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body. When his body breaks up, after death, he reappears in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. This is called the undertaking that is painful now and results in future pain. 

And what is the undertaking that is painful now but results in future pleasure? It is when someone is by nature acutely passionate, averse, and muddled. He often feels the pain and sorrow born of passion, aversion, and muddledness. He leads the complete and pure renunciate life in pain and sorrow, weeping, with a tearful face. When his body breaks up, after death, he reappears in a good place, a heavenly realm. This is called the undertaking that is painful now but results in future pleasure.

And what is the undertaking that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure? It is when someone is by nature not acutely passionate, averse, and muddled. He does not often feel the pain and sorrow born of passion, aversion, and muddledness. Having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality, having withdrawn from unbeneficial phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of withdrawal, he abides having entered upon the first jhāna. second jhāna … third jhāna … fourth jhāna. When his body breaks up, after death, he reappears in a good place, a heavenly realm. This is called the undertaking that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure. These are the four undertakings.”

That is what the Auspicious One said. Pleased, the bhikkhus delighted in what the Auspicious One said.
