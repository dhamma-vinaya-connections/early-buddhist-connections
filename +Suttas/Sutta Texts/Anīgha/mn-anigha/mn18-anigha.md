# MN 18 - The Lump of Honey

Thus have I heard.  At one time, the Auspicious One was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.

Then the Auspicious One dressed in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kapilavatthu for alms. He wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Great Wood, plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a young wood apple tree for the day’s abiding.

Daṇḍapāṇi the Sakyan, while going for a walk, plunged deep into the Great Wood. He approached the Auspicious One and exchanged pleasantries with him. When the amicable and cordial talk was over, he stood to one side leaning on his staff, and said to the Auspicious One, “What is the ascetic’s doctrine? What does he assert?”

“Venerable, my doctrine is such that one does not contend with anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. And it is such that the brahmin who lives detached from sensuality, without doubting, stripped of worry, and without craving for any kind of being, is not underlain by perceptions.  That is my doctrine, and that is what I assert.”

When he had spoken, Daṇḍapāṇi shook his head, fluttered his tongue, raised his eyebrows until his brow puckered in three furrows, and he departed leaning on his staff.

Then, in the late afternoon, the Auspicious One came out of retreat and went to the Banyan Tree Monastery, sat down on the seat spread out, and told the bhikkhus what had happened.

When he had spoken, one of the bhikkhus said to him, “But Venerable sir, asserting what does the Auspicious One not contend with anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans? And how is it that the Auspicious One, the brahmin who lives detached from sensuality, without doubting, stripped of worry, and without craving for any kind of being, is not underlain by perceptions?”

“Bhikkhus, the cause of perceptions and considerations born of proliferation besetting one—  If there is nothing to be delighted in, welcomed, or rested upon there,  just this is the end of the underlying tendencies to passion, resistance, views, doubt, conceit, passion for being, and ignorance. This is the end of taking up the rod and the sword, the end of quarrels, contention, and disputes, of accusations, slander, and lies. This is where these bad, unbeneficial things cease without remainder.” 

That is what the Auspicious One said. When he had spoken, the Excellent One arose from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Soon after the Auspicious One left, those bhikkhus thought, “The Auspicious One gave this brief explanation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail. Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief explanation given by the Auspicious One?”

Then those bhikkhus thought, “This Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his wise fellow renunciates. He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief explanation given by the Auspicious One. Let us go to him, and ask him about this matter.”

Then those bhikkhus went to Venerable Mahākaccāna, and exchanged pleasantries with him. When the amicable and cordial talk was over, they sat down to one side. They told him what had happened, and said: “May Venerable Mahākaccāna please explain this.”

“Venerables, suppose there was a man in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood, he would come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But he would pass over the roots and trunk, imagining that the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leaves. Such is how it has turned out for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Auspicious One, you overlooked him, imagining that you should ask me about this matter. For he, the Auspicious One, knows while knowing and sees while seeing. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the Dhamma, he is divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Realized One.  That was the time to approach the Auspicious One and ask about this matter. You should have remembered it in line with the Auspicious One’s answer.”

“Certainly, the Auspicious One knows while knowing and sees while seeing. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the Dhamma, he is the divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Realized One. That was the time to approach the Auspicious One and ask about this matter. We should have remembered it according to the Auspicious One’s answer. Still, the Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his wise fellow renunciates. He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief explanation given by the Auspicious One. May the Venerable Mahākaccāna explain this, without making it difficult.”

“Very well, venerables, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”

“Yes, venerable,” they replied. Venerable Mahākaccāna said this:

“Venerables, the Auspicious One gave this brief explanation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail: ‘Bhikkhus, the cause for perceptions and considerations born of proliferation besetting one— If there is nothing to be delighted in, welcomed, or rested upon there, just this is the end of the underlying tendencies to passion, resistance, views, doubt, conceit, passion for being, and ignorance. This is the end of taking up the rod and the sword, the end of quarrels, arguments, and disputes, of accusations, slander, and lies. This is where these bad, unbeneficial things cease without remainder.’ This is how I understand the detailed meaning of this explanation:

Eye-consciousness arises dependent on the eye and forms. The meeting of the three is pressure. With pressure as basis, feeling. What one feels, one perceives. What one perceives, one thinks about. What one thinks about, one proliferates. What one proliferates is the cause for perceptions and considerations born of proliferation besetting one with regard to sights cognizable by the eye pertaining to the past, present, and future.

Ear-consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds. …

Nose-consciousness arises dependent on the nose and smells. …

Tongue-consciousness arises dependent on the tongue and tastes. …

Body-consciousness arises dependent on the body and touches. …

Mental-faculty-consciousness arises dependent on the mental faculty and phenomena. The meeting of the three is pressure. With pressure as basis, feeling. What one feels, one perceives. What one perceives, one thinks about. What one thinks about, one proliferates. What one proliferates is the cause for perceptions and considerations born of proliferation besetting one with regard to sights cognizable by the mental faculty pertaining to the past, present, and future.

Venerables, there being the eye, forms, and eye-consciousness, pressure is conceivable.  Pressure being conceivable, feeling is conceivable. Feeling being conceivable, perception is conceivable. Perception being conceivable, thought is conceivable. Thought being conceivable, the besetting of perceptions and considerations born of proliferation is conceivable.

There being the ear … nose … tongue … body … Friends, there being the mental faculty, phenomena, and mental faculty consciousness, pressure is conceivable. … Pressure being conceivable, feeling is conceivable. Feeling being conceivable, perception is conceivable. Perception being conceivable, thought is conceivable. Thought being conceivable, the besetting of perceptions and considerations born of proliferation is conceivable.

Venerables, there being no eye, no forms, and no eye-consciousness, pressure is inconceivable. Pressure being inconceivable, feeling is inconceivable. Feeling being inconceivable, perception is inconceivable. Perception being inconceivable, thought is inconceivable. Thought being inconceivable, the besetting of perceptions and considerations born of proliferation is inconceivable.

Venerables, there being no ear … no nose … no tongue … no body … no mental faculty, no ideas, and no mental faculty consciousness, pressure is inconceivable. Pressure being inconceivable, feeling is inconceivable. Feeling being inconceivable, perception is inconceivable. Perception being inconceivable, thought is inconceivable. Thought being inconceivable, the besetting of perceptions and considerations born of proliferation is inconceivable.

This is how I understand the detailed meaning of that brief explanation given by the Auspicious One. If you wish, you may go to the Auspicious One and ask him about this. You should remember it in line with the Auspicious One’s answer.”

Then those bhikkhus, delighting in and appreciating what Venerable Mahākaccāna said, rose from their seats and went to the Auspicious One, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding: “Venerable Mahākaccāna clearly explained the meaning to us in this manner, with these words and phrases.”

“Mahākaccāna is wise, bhikkhus, he is of great understanding. If you came to me and asked this question, I would answer it in exactly the same way as Mahākaccāna. That is what it means, and that is how you should remember it.”

When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Auspicious One, “Venerable sir, suppose a man who was weak with hunger was to obtain a lump of honey. Wherever he tastes it, he would enjoy a sweet, refined flavor.

In the same way, whenever a sagacious and competent bhikkhu might examine with understanding the meaning of this exposition of the teaching, he would only gain gladness and confidence.  Venerable sir, what is the name of this exposition of the teaching?”

“Well then, Ānanda, you may remember this exposition of the teaching as ‘The Lump of Honey Discourse’.”

That is what the Auspicious One said. Pleased, Venerable Ānanda delighted in what the Auspicious One said.
