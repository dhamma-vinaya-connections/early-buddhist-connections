# MN 63 - The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Auspicious One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.

Then, as Venerable Māluṅkyaputta was in private retreat, this thought came to his mind:

“There are several convictions that the Auspicious One has left undeclared; he has set them aside and refused to comment on them. For example, the world is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are identical, or they are distinct; after death, a Realized One still exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists. The Auspicious One does not explain these points to me. I find that displeasing and unacceptable. I will go to him and ask him about this. If he gives me a straightforward answer on any of these points, I will lead the renunciate life under him. If he does not explain these points to me, I shall reject the training and return to the lower life.”

Then, in the late afternoon, Māluṅkyaputta emerged from retreat and went to the Auspicious One. He bowed, sat down to one side, and informed him of his thoughts. He then continued:

“If the Auspicious One knows that the world is eternal, please tell me. If you know that the world is not eternal, tell me. If you do not know whether the world is eternal or not, then what is straightforward is to simply say: ‘I neither know nor see.’ If you know that the world is finite, or infinite; that the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; that after death, a Realized One still exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists, please tell me. If you do not know any of these things, then what is straightforward is to simply say: ‘I neither know nor see.’”

“What, Māluṅkyaputta, did I ever say to you: ‘Come, Māluṅkyaputta, lead the renunciate life under me, and I will declare these things to you’?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Or did you ever say to me: ‘Venerable sir, I will lead the renunciate life under the Auspicious One, and the Auspicious One will declare these things to me’?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“So, it seems that I did not say to you: ‘Come, Māluṅkyaputta, lead the renunciate life under me, and I will declare these things to you.’ And you never said to me: ‘Venerable sir, I will lead the renunciate life under the Auspicious One, and the Auspicious One will declare these things to me.’ In that case, inept man, who are you and what are you rejecting?

Suppose someone were to say this: ‘I will not lead the renunciate life under the Auspicious One until the Auspicious One declares to me that the world is eternal, or that the world is not eternal … or that after death, a Realized One neither still exists nor no longer exists.’ That would still remain undeclared by the Realized One, and meanwhile, that person would die.

Suppose a man was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poison. His friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would have a surgeon treat him. But the man would say: ‘I will not extract this arrow as long as I do not know whether the man who wounded me was an aristocrat, a brahmin, a peasant, or a menial.’ He would say: ‘I will not extract this arrow as long as I do not know the following things about the man who wounded me: his name and clan; whether he is tall, short, or medium; whether his skin is black, brown, or tawny; and what village, town, or city he originates from. I will not extract this arrow as long as I do not know whether the bow that wounded me was straight or recurved; whether the bow-string is made of swallow-wort fibre, sunn hemp fibre, sinew, sanseveria fibre, or spurge fibre; whether the shaft is made from a bush or a plantation tree; whether the shaft was fitted with feathers from a vulture, a heron, a hawk, a peacock, or a stork; whether the shaft was bound with sinews of a cow, a buffalo, a black lion, or an ape; and whether the arrowhead was spiked, razor-tipped, barbed, made of iron or a calf’s tooth, or lancet-shaped.’ That man would still not have learned these things, and meanwhile he would die.

In the same way, suppose someone were to say this: ‘I will not lead the renunciate life under the Auspicious One until the Auspicious One declares to me that the world is eternal, or that the world is not eternal … or that after death, a Realized One neither still exists nor no longer exists.’ That would still remain undeclared by the Realized One, and meanwhile that person would die. 

It is not the case that if there were the view ‘the world is eternal’, there would be the living of the renunciate life. It is not the case that if there were the view ‘the world is not eternal’, there would be the living of the renunciate life. When there is the view that the world is eternal or that the world is not eternal, there is birth, there is aging, there is death, and there is sorrow, lamentation, displeasure, sadness, and distress. And it is the defeat of these things right in the present experience that I advocate. It is not the case that if there were the view ‘the world is finite’, … ‘the world is infinite’ … ‘the soul and the body are the same thing’ … ‘the soul and the body are different things’ … ‘a Realized One still exists after death’ … ‘a Realized One no longer exists after death’ … ‘a Realized One both still exists and no longer exists after death’ … ‘a Realized One neither still exists nor no longer exists after death’, there would be the living of the renunciate life. When there are any of these views, there is birth, there is old age, there is death, and there is sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. And it is the defeat of these things, right in the present experience, that I advocate.

So, Māluṅkyaputta, you should remember what I have not declared as undeclared, and what I have declared as declared. And what have I not declared? I have not declared the following: ‘the world is eternal,’ ‘the world is not eternal,’ ‘the world is finite,’ ‘the world is infinite,’ ‘the soul and the body are the same thing,’ ‘the soul and the body are different things,’ ‘a Realized One still exists after death,’ ‘A Realized One no longer exists after death,’ ‘a Realized One both still exists and no longer exists after death,’ ‘a Realized One neither still exists nor no longer exists after death.’

And why have not I declared these things? Because they are not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the renunciate life. They do not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, comprehension, awakening, and Nibbāna. That is why I have not declared them.

And what have I declared? I have declared the following: ‘this is suffering,’ ‘this is the origin of suffering,’ ‘this is the cessation of suffering,’ ‘this is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’

And why have I declared these things? Because they are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the renunciate life. They lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, comprehension, awakening, and Nibbāna. That is why I have declared them. So, Māluṅkyaputta, you should remember what I have not declared as undeclared, and what I have declared as declared.”

That is what the Auspicious One said. Pleased, Venerable Māluṅkyaputta delighted in what the Auspicious One said.
