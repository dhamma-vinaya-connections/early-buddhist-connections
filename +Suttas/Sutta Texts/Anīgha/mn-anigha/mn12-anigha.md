# MN 12 - The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Auspicious One was staying outside the city of Vesālī in a woodland grove west of the town.

Now at that time, Sunakkhatta the Licchavi had recently left this teaching-and-discipline. He was telling a crowd in Vesālī:

“The ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones. He expounds a teaching that he is devised by reasoning and consideration, out of his own wit. And his teaching leads those who practice it to the complete ending of suffering, the goal for which it is taught.”

Then Venerable Sāriputta donned his robe in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. He heard what Sunakkhatta was saying.

Then he wandered for alms in Vesālī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Auspicious One, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed him of the matter.

“Sāriputta, Sunakkhatta, that inept man, is angry. His words are spoken out of anger. Thinking he criticizes the Realized One, he actually praises him. For it is praise of the Realized One to say: ‘His teaching leads those who practice it to the complete ending of suffering, the goal for which it is taught.’

But it is impossible that inept man Sunakkhatta will infer about me through the Dhamma: ‘That Auspicious One is an Arahant, a Rightly Self-Awakened One, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’

And it is impossible that inept man Sunakkhatta will infer about me through the Dhamma: ‘That Auspicious One wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying himself and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm.’

And it is impossible that inept man Sunakkhatta will infer about me through the Dhamma: ‘That Auspicious One, with the divine ear that is purified and superhuman, hears both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.’

And it is impossible that inept man Sunakkhatta will infer about me through the Dhamma: ‘That Auspicious One understands the minds of other beings and individuals, having encompassed them with his own mind. He understands mind with passion as “mind with passion,” and mind without passion as “mind without passion.” He understands mind with aversion … mind without aversion … mind with muddledness … mind without muddledness … constricted mind … scattered mind … expansive mind … unexpansive mind … mind that is supreme … mind that is not supreme … mind composed … mind not composed … liberated mind as “liberated mind,” and unliberated mind as “unliberated mind.”’

There are these ten powers of a Realized One that the Realized One possesses. With these, he claims supremacy, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel. What ten?

Firstly, the Realized One understands as it is the possible as possible, and the impossible as impossible. Since he understands this as it is, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this, he claims supremacy, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.

Furthermore, the Realized One understands as it is the result of actions undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of grounds and causes. Since he understands this as it is, this is a power of the Realized One. …

Furthermore, the Realized One understands as it is the path of practice leading to any state. Since he understands this as it is, this is a power of the Realized One. …

Furthermore, the Realized One understands as it is the world with its many and diverse elements. Since he understands this as it is, this is a power of the Realized One. …

Furthermore, the Realized One understands as they are the diverse convictions of beings. Since he understands this as it is, this is a power of the Realized One. …

Furthermore, the Realized One understands as they are the faculties of other beings and other individuals. Since he understands this as it is, this is a power of the Realized One. …

Furthermore, the Realized One understands as they are the defilement, purification, and emergence with regard to the attainments of composure, the jhānas and liberations. Since he understands this as it is, this is a power of the Realized One. …

Furthermore, the Realized One recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand births; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and displeasure, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place, I reappeared somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and displeasure, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place, I reappeared here.’ And so, he recollects his many kinds of past lives, with features and details. Since he understands this as it is, this is a power of the Realized One. …

Furthermore, with the divine eye that is purified and superhuman, the Realized One sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good or a bad destination. He understands how beings reappear according to their actions. ‘These beings engaged in misconduct by way of body, speech, and thought. They found fault with the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act in accordance with that wrong view. On the dissolution of the body, after death, they reappear in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These beings, however, engaged in good conduct by way of body, speech, and thought. They did not find fault with the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act in accordance with that right view. On the dissolution of the body, after death, they reappear in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with the divine eye that is purified and superhuman, he sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good or a bad destination. He understands how beings reappear according to their actions. Since he understands this as it is, this is a power of the Realized One. …

Furthermore, the Realized One, with the destruction of the influxes, lives having entered upon the liberation by mind and liberation by understanding that is devoid of influxes, having for himself comprehended and realized it right in the present experience. Since he understands this as it is, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims supremacy, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.

A Realized One possesses these ten powers of a Realized One. With these he claims supremacy, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.

When I know and see in this way, suppose someone were to say this: ‘The ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones. He expounds a teaching that he has worked out by reasoning and consideration, out of his own wit.’ Unless he abandons that talk and that attitude, and relinquishes that view, he will be cast down to hell. Sāriputta, just as a bhikkhu accomplished in virtue, composure, and understanding would attain ultimate knowledge right in the present experience, such is the consequence of this, I say. Unless he abandons that talk and that attitude, and relinquishes that view, he will be cast down to hell.

Sāriputta, a Realized One has four kinds of self-assurance. With these, he claims supremacy, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel. What four?

I see no reason for anyone—whether ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or Brahmā, or anyone else in the world—to legitimately reproach me, saying: ‘You claim to be a Rightly Self-Awakened One, but you do not perfectly understand these things.’ Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.

I see no reason for anyone—whether ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or Brahmā, or anyone else in the world—to legitimately reproach me, saying: ‘You claim to have destroyed all influxes, but you still have these influxes.’ Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.

I see no reason for anyone—whether ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or Brahmā, or anyone else in the world—to legitimately reproach me, saying: ‘The acts that you say are obstructions are not in fact obstructions for the one who performs them.’ Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.

I see no reason for anyone—whether ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or Brahmā, or anyone else in the world—to legitimately reproach me, saying: ‘The teaching does not lead those who practice it to the complete ending of suffering, the goal for which it is taught.’ Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.

A Realized One has these four kinds of self-assurance. With these, he claims supremacy, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.

When I know and see in this way, suppose someone were to say this: ‘The ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones …’ Unless he abandons that talk and that attitude, and relinquishes that view, he will be cast down to hell. Just as a bhikkhu accomplished in virtue …

Sāriputta, there are these eight assemblies. What eight? The assemblies of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics. An assembly of the gods under the Four Great Kings. An assembly of the gods under the Thirty-Three. An assembly of Māras. An assembly of Brahmās. These are the eight assemblies. Possessing these four kinds of self-assurance, the Realized One approaches and enters directly into these eight assemblies. I recall having approached an assembly of hundreds of aristocrats. There I used to sit with them, converse, and engage in discussion. But I do not see any possibility to feel afraid or insecure. Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.

I recall having approached an assembly of hundreds of brahmins … householders … ascetics … the gods under the Four Great Kings … the gods under the Thirty-Three … Māras … Brahmās. There too, I used to sit with them, converse, and engage in discussion. But I do not see any possibility to feel afraid or insecure. Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.

When I know and see in this way, suppose someone were to say this: ‘The ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones …’ Unless he abandons that talk and that attitude, and abandons that view, he will be cast down to hell. Just as a bhikkhu accomplished in virtue …

Sāriputta, there are these four kinds of reproduction. What four? Reproduction for creatures born from an egg, from a womb, from moisture, or spontaneously.

And what is reproduction from an egg? There are beings who are born by hatching from an eggshell. This is called reproduction from an egg. And what is reproduction from a womb? There are beings who are born by emerging from the amniotic sac. This is called reproduction from a womb. And what is reproduction from moisture? There are beings who are born in a rotten fish, in a rotten carcass, in rotten dough, in a cesspool or a sump. This is called reproduction from moisture. And what is spontaneous reproduction? Gods, hell-beings, certain humans, and certain beings in the lower realms. This is called spontaneous reproduction. These are the four kinds of reproduction.

When I know and see in this way, suppose someone were to say this: ‘The ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones …’ Unless he abandons that talk and that attitude, and lets go of that view, he will be cast down to hell. Just as a bhikkhu accomplished in virtue, …

There are these five destinations. What five? Hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, humans, and gods.

I understand hell, and the path and way leading to hell. And I understand how someone following that way, when his body dissolves, after death, reappears in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. I understand the animal realm … the ghost realm … humans … gods, and the path and way leading to the world of the gods. And I understand how someone following that way, when his body dissolves, after death, reappears in a good place, a heavenly realm. And I understand Nibbāna, and the path and way leading to Nibbāna. And I understand how someone following that way, with the destruction of the influxes, lives having entered upon the liberation by mind and liberation by understanding that is devoid of influxes, having for himself comprehended and realized it right in the present experience..

When I have encompassed someone’s mind, I understand: ‘This individual is following such a way, proceeding in such a manner, and has taken such a path that when his body dissolves, after death, he will reappear in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’ Then, some time later, I see that he has indeed reappeared in hell, where he feels exclusively unpleasant feelings, sharp and severe. Suppose there was a pit of glowing coals deeper than a man’s height, full of glowing coals that neither flamed nor smoked. Then along comes a man struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched—on a path heading squarely towards that same pit of coals.  If a man with good eyesight saw him, he would say: ‘This man is following such a way, proceeding in such a manner, and has taken such a path that he will arrive at that very pit of coals.’ Then, some time later, he sees that he has indeed fallen into that pit of coals, where he feels exclusively unpleasant feelings, sharp and severe. …

When I have encompassed someone’s mind, I understand: ‘This individual … will reappear in the animal realm.’ Then, some time later, I see that he has indeed reappeared in the animal realm, where he feels unpleasant feelings, sharp and severe. Suppose there was a sewer deeper than a man’s height, full to the brim with feces. Then along comes a man struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched—on a path heading squarely towards that same sewer. If a man with good eyesight saw him, he would say: ‘This man is following such a way, proceeding in such a manner, and has taken such a path that he will arrive at that very sewer.’ Then, some time later, he sees that he has indeed fallen into that sewer, where he suffers unpleasant feelings, sharp and severe. …

When I have encompassed someone’s mind, I understand: ‘This individual … will reappear in the ghost realm.’ Then, some time later, I see that he has indeed reappeared in the ghost realm, where he experiences mostly unpleasant feelings. Suppose there was a tree growing on rugged ground, with thin foliage casting a patchy shade. Then along comes a man struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched—on a path heading squarely towards that same tree. If a man with good eyesight saw him, he would say: ‘This man is following such a way, proceeding in such a manner, and has taken such a path that he will arrive at that very tree.’ Then, some time later, he sees him sitting or lying under that tree, where he experiences mostly unpleasant feelings. …

When I have encompassed someone’s mind, I understand: ‘This individual … will reappear among human beings.’ Then, some time later, I see that he has indeed reappeared among human beings, where he experiences mostly pleasant feelings. Suppose there was a tree growing on smooth ground, with abundant foliage casting dense shade. Then along comes a man struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched—on a path heading squarely towards that same tree. If a man with good eyesight saw him, he would say: ‘This man is following such a way, proceeding in such a manner, and has taken such a path that he will arrive at that very tree.’ Then, some time later, he sees him sitting or lying under that tree, where he experiences mostly pleasant feelings. …

When I have encompassed someone’s mind, I understand: ‘This individual … will reappear in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ Then, some time later, I see that he has indeed reappeared in a heavenly realm, where he feels exclusively pleasant feelings. Suppose there was a stilt longhouse with a peaked roof, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with latches fastened and windows shuttered. And it had a couch spread with woolen covers—shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends. Then along comes a man struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched—on a path heading squarely towards that same stilt longhouse. If a man with good eyesight saw him, he would say: ‘This man is following such a way, proceeding in such a manner, and has taken such a path that he will arrive at that very stilt longhouse.’ Then, some time later, he sees him sitting or lying in that stilt longhouse, where he feels exclusively pleasant feelings. …

When I have encompassed someone’s mind, I understand: ‘This individual is following such a way, proceeding in such a manner, and has taken such a path that he will, with the destruction of the influxes, abide having entered upon the liberation by mind and liberation by understanding that is devoid of influxes, having for himself comprehended and realized it right in the present experience’ Then, some time later, I see that he indeed, with the destruction of the influxes, abides having entered upon the liberation by mind and liberation by understanding that is devoid of influxes, having for himself comprehended and realized it right in the present experience, feeling exclusively pleasant feelings. Suppose there was a lotus pond with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful. Nearby was a dense forest grove. Then along comes a man struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched—on a path heading squarely towards that same lotus pond. If a man with good eyesight saw him, he would say: ‘This man is proceeding in such a way and has taken such a path that he will arrive at that very lotus pond.’ Then, some time later, he would see that man after he had plunged into the lotus pond, bathed and drunk, with all his stress, weariness, and heat having faded away. He had emerged and sat or lain down in that forest grove, where he experienced exclusively pleasant feelings.

In the same way, when I have encompassed someone’s mind, I understand: ‘This individual is following such a way, proceeding in such a manner, and has taken such a path that he will, with the destruction of the influxes, abide having entered upon the liberation by mind and liberation by understanding that is devoid of influxes, having for himself comprehended and realized it right in the present experience..’ Then, some time later, I see that he indeed, with the destruction of the influxes, abides having entered upon the liberation by mind and liberation by understanding that is devoid of influxes, having for himself comprehended and realized it right in the present experience, feeling exclusively pleasant feelings. These are the five destinations.

When I know and see in this way, suppose someone were to say this: ‘The ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones. He expounds a teaching that he is developed by reasoning and consideration, out of his own wit.’ Unless he abandons that talk and that attitude, and relinquishes that view, he will be cast down to hell. Just as a bhikkhu accomplished in virtue, composure, and understanding would attain ultimate knowledge in the present experience, such is the consequence of this, I say. Unless he abandons that talk and that attitude, and relinquishes that view, he will be cast down to hell.

Sāriputta, I recall having lived a renunciate life consisting of four factors. I used to be a fervent ascetic, the supreme fervent ascetic. I used to be a rough-liver, the supreme rough-liver. I used to be a shunner, the supreme shunner. I used to be a recluse, the supreme recluse. 

And this is what my fervent asceticism was like. I went naked, ignoring conventions. I licked my hands, and did not come or stop when asked. I did not consent to food brought to me, or food prepared specially for me, or an invitation for a meal. I did not receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel at home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who has a man in her home; or where food for distribution is advertised; or where there is a dog waiting or flies buzzing. I accepted no fish or meat or liquor or wine, and drank no beer. I went to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls. I fed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day. I ate once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. I lived committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals.

I ate herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. I survived on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.

I wore robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings. I tore out hair and beard, committed to this practice. I constantly stood, refusing seats. I squatted, committed to the endeavor of squatting. I lay on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns my bed. I was committed to the practice of immersing in water three times a day, including the evening. And so, I lived committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body. Such was my practice of fervent mortification.

And this is what my rough living was like. The dust and dirt built up on my body over many years until it started flaking off. It is like the trunk of a pale-moon ebony tree, which builds up bark over many years until it starts flaking off. But it did not occur to me: ‘Oh, if only this dust and dirt were rubbed off by my hand or someone else’s!’ That did not occur to me. Such was my rough living.

And this is what my shunning was like. I would step forward or back with great care; my kindness was established for even a drop of water, thinking: ‘May I not injure any little creatures on unclear ground.’ Such was my shunning.

And this is what my seclusion was like. I would plunge deep into a wilderness region and stay there. When I saw a cowherd or a shepherd, or someone gathering grass or sticks, or a lumberjack, I would flee from forest to forest, from thicket to thicket, from valley to valley, from uplands to uplands. Why is that? So that I would not see them, nor they me. I fled like a wild deer seeing a human being. Such was my practice of seclusion.

I would go on all fours into the cattle pens, after the cattle had left, and eat the dung of the young suckling calves. As long as my own urine and excrement lasted, I would even eat that. Such was my eating of most gruesome things.

I would plunge deep into a frightening forest grove and stay there. It was so frightening that it would normally make the hairs of one not free from passion stand up if he entered it. And on days such as the cold spell when the snow falls in the January winter, I stayed in the open by night and in the forest by day. But in the last month of summer, I would stay in the open by day and in the forest by night. And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me:

> ‘Scorched and frozen, alone in the frightening forest. Naked, no fire to sit beside, the sage still pursues his quest.’

I would make my bed in a charnel ground, with the bones of the dead for a pillow. Then village troublemakers would come up to me. They would spit and urinate on me, throw mud on me, even poke sticks in my ears. But I do not recall ever having an evil intent towards them. Such was my abiding in equanimity.

There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘Purity comes from food.’ They say: ‘Let us live on jujubes.’ So they eat jujubes and jujube powder, and drink jujube juice. And they enjoy many jujube concoctions. I recall eating just a single jujube. You might think that at that time, the jujubes must have been very big. But you should not see it like this. The jujubes then were at most the same size as today. Eating so very little, my body became extremely emaciated. Due to eating so little, my limbs became like the joints of an eighty-year-old or a corpse, my buttocks became like a camel’s hoof, my vertebrae protruded like beads on a string, and my ribs were as gaunt as the dilapidated rafters on an old barn. Due to eating so little, the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets, like the gleam of water sunk deep within a well. Due to eating so little, my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter-gourd in the wind and sun. Due to eating so little, the skin of my abdomen stuck to my backbone, so that when I tried to rub the skin of my abdomen I grabbed my backbone, and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my abdomen. Due to eating so little, when I tried to urinate or defecate, I fell face down right there. Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out.

There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘Purity comes from food.’ They say: ‘Let us live on mung beans.’ … ‘Let us live on sesame.’ … ‘Let us live on ordinary rice.’ … Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out.

But Sāriputta, I did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones by that conduct, that way, that grueling practice. Why is that? Because I did not achieve that noble understanding that is noble and emancipating, and which leads someone who practices it to the complete ending of suffering.

There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘Purity comes from roaming (saṃsāra).’  But it is not easy to find a roaming \[place\] that I have not previously roamed in all this long time, except for the gods of the pure abodes. For if I had roamed amidst the gods of the pure abodes, I would not have returned to this world again.

There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘Purity comes from reappearance.’  But it is not easy to find a reappearance that I have not previously \[experienced\], except for the gods of the pure abodes …

There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘Purity comes from the abode.’ But it is not easy to find an abode where I have not previously abided, except for the gods of the pure abodes …

There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘Purity comes from sacrifice.’ But it is not easy to find a sacrifice that I have not previously performed in all this long time, when I was an anointed aristocratic king or a prosperous brahmin.

There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘Purity comes from serving the sacred flame.’ But it is not easy to find a fire that I have not previously served in all this long time, when I was an anointed aristocratic king or a prosperous brahmin.

There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘So long as this gentleman is youthful, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life, he will be endowed with perfect lucidity of understanding. But when he is old, elderly, and senior, advanced in years, and has reached the final stage of life—eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old—he will lose his lucidity of understanding.’ But you should not see it like this. For now I am old, elderly, and senior, I am advanced in years, and have reached the final stage of life. I am eighty years old. Suppose I had four disciples with a lifespan of a hundred years. And they each were perfect in memory, range, retention, and supreme lucidity of understanding. Imagine how easily a well-trained expert archer with a strong bow would shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree. That is how extraordinary they were in memory, range, retention, and supreme lucidity of understanding. They would raise questions about the four establishments of recollectedness again and again, and I would answer each question. They would remember the answers and not ask the same question twice. And they would pause only to eat and drink, urinate and defecate, and sleep to dispel weariness. But the Realized One’s teaching of the Dhamma, words and phrases pertaining to the Dhamma, and wit in replying to questions would not at all be exhausted. And at the end of a hundred years, my four disciples would die. Sāriputta, even if you have to transport me on a cot, there will never be any deterioration in the Realized One’s lucidity of understanding.

And if there is anyone of whom it may be rightly said, ‘A being not subject to muddledness has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans, it is of me that this should be said.’”

Now at that time, Venerable Nāgasamāla was standing behind the Auspicious One fanning him. Then he said to the Auspicious One:

“It is remarkable, venerable sir, it is extraordinary! While I was listening to this exposition of the teaching, my hair stood up! What is the name of this exposition of the teaching?”

“Well then, Nāgasamāla, you may remember this exposition of the teaching as ‘The Hair-raising Discourse’.”

That is what the Auspicious One said. Pleased, Venerable Nāgasamāla delighted in what the Auspicious One said.
