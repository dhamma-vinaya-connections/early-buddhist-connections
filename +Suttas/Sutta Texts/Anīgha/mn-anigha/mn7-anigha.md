# MN 7 - The Simile of the Cloth

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Auspicious One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Auspicious One addressed the bhikkhus, “Bhikkhus!”

“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Auspicious One said this:

“Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a cloth that was soiled and stained. No matter what dye the dyer applied—whether blue or yellow or red or magenta—it would look poorly dyed and impure in color. Why is that? Because of the impurity of the cloth.

In the same way, when the mind is defiled, a bad destination is to be expected. Suppose there was a cloth that was pure and clean. No matter what dye the dyer applied—whether blue or yellow or red or magenta—it would look well dyed and pure in color. Why is that? Because of the purity of the cloth.

In the same way, when the mind is not defiled, a good destination is to be expected.

And what are the defilements of the mind? Longing and immoral greed, ill will, anger, resentment, denigration, contentiousness, jealousy, stinginess, deceit, deviousness, obstinacy, insolence, conceit, arrogance, indulgence, and carelessness are defilements of the mind.

A bhikkhu who understands that longing and immoral greed are defilements of the mind abandons them. A bhikkhu who understands that ill will, … carelessness is a defilement of the mind abandons it.

When he has understood these defilements of the mind for what they are and has abandoned them, he has absolute confidence in the Buddha: ‘That Auspicious One is an Arahant, a Rightly Self-Awakened One, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 

He has absolute confidence in the Dhamma: ‘The Dhamma is well explained by the Auspicious One: presently evident, not involving time, verifiable, and goading-on, to be known by the wise for themselves.’ 

He has absolute confidence in the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Auspicious One’s disciples is practicing rightly and straightly, practicing the way, the proper course. It consists of the four pairs of people, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Auspicious One’s disciples that is worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’

When a bhikkhu has discarded, eliminated, released, abandoned, and relinquished to this extent, thinking, ‘I have absolute confidence in the Buddha … the Dhamma … the Saṅgha,’ he realizes the Dhamma and its meaning, and gains gladness connected with the Dhamma. Thinking: ‘I have discarded, eliminated, released, abandoned, and relinquished to this extent,’ he realizes the Dhamma and its meaning, and gains gladness connected with the Dhamma. When he is glad, joy is born. When the mind is joyous, the body becomes calm. When the body is calm, he feels at ease. When he is at ease, the mind becomes composed. 

When a bhikkhu of such virtue, such qualities, and such understanding eats boiled fine rice with the dark grains removed and served with many soups and sauces, that is no obstacle for him. Compare with cloth that is soiled and stained; it can be made pure and clean by pure water. Or unrefined gold, which can be made pure and bright by a forge. In the same way, when a bhikkhu of such virtue, such qualities, and such understanding eats boiled fine rice with the dark grains removed and served with many soups and sauces, that is no obstacle for him.

He abides having pervaded with a mind of friendliness the first direction, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth. In the same way, above, below, across, everywhere, he abides having pervaded the whole world with a mind of friendliness—abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free of enmity and ill will.  He abides having pervaded with a mind of compassion the first direction, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth. In the same way, above, below, across, everywhere, he abides having pervaded the whole world with a mind of compassion—abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free of enmity and ill will.  He abides having pervaded with a mind of contentment the first direction, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth. In the same way, above, below, across, everywhere, he abides having pervaded the whole world with a mind of contentment—abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free of enmity and ill will.  He abides having pervaded with a mind of equanimity the first direction, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth. In the same way, above, below, across, everywhere, he abides having pervaded the whole world with a mind of equanimity—abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free of enmity and ill will.

He understands: ‘There is this, there is what is inferior to this, there is what is more refined than this, and there is an escape beyond this scope of perception.’

Knowing and seeing like this, his mind is liberated from the influxes of sensuality, being, and ignorance. When it is liberated, he knows it is liberated.

He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the renunciate life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there will be no more of this.’ This is called a bhikkhu who is bathed with the inner bathing.”

Now at that time, the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja was sitting not far from the Auspicious One. He said to the Auspicious One, “But does Master Gotama go to the river Bāhuka to bathe?”

“Brahmin, why go to the river Bāhuka? What can the river Bāhuka do?”

“Many people deem that the river Bāhukā bestows liberation and merit. And many people cleanse themselves of their bad actions in the river Bāhukā.”

Then the Auspicious One addressed Sundarikabhāradvāja in verse:

> “The Bāhukā and the Adhikakkā, at Gayā and the Sundarikā also, Sarasvatī and Payāga, and the river Bāhumatī: a fool can constantly plunge into them but it will not purify his dark actions.
> 
> What can the Sundarikā do? What the Payāga or the Bāhukā? They cannot cleanse a cruel evil-doer from his bad actions.
> 
> For one who is pure, it is always the spring festival or the sabbath. For one who is pure, clean of action, his vows will always be fulfilled. It is here alone that you should bathe, brahmin, making yourself a sanctuary for all beings.
> 
> And if you speak no lies, nor harm any living creature, nor steal anything not given, and you are faithful and not uncharitable: what is the point of going to Gayā? For any well may be your Gayā!”

When he had spoken, the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja said to the Auspicious One, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark, so those with good eyesight can see what is there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. May I receive the going forth, the ordination in the ascetic Gotama’s presence?”

And the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja received the going forth, the ordination in the Auspicious One’s presence. Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, abiding alone, withdrawn, heedful, diligent, and resolute, lived having entered upon the supreme goal of the renunciate life, for which sons of good families rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness, having for himself comprehended and realized it right in the present experience.

He understood: “Birth is destroyed; the renunciate life has been lived; what had to be done has been done; there will be no more of this.” And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the Arahants.
