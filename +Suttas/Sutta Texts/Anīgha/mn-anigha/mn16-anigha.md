# MN 16 - Obstinacies


Thus have I heard. At one time, the Auspicious One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Auspicious One addressed the bhikkhus, “Bhikkhus!”

“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Auspicious One said this:

“Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu has not abandoned five obstinacies and cut off five shackles of mind, it is not possible for him to achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching-and-discipline.

What are the five obstinacies he has not abandoned? Firstly, a bhikkhu has doubts about the Teacher. He is uncertain, undecided, and lacking confidence. This being so, his mind does not incline to diligence, dedication, persistence, and striving. This is the first obstinacy he has not abandoned.

Furthermore, a bhikkhu has doubts about the Dhamma … This is the second obstinacy.

He has doubts about the Saṅgha … This is the third obstinacy.

He has doubts about the training … This is the fourth obstinacy.

Furthermore, a bhikkhu is angry and upset with his fellow renunciates, resentful and obstinate. This being so, his mind does not incline to diligence, dedication, persistence, and striving. This is the fifth obstinacy he has not abandoned. These are the five obstinacies he has not abandoned.

What are the five shackles of mind he has not severed? Firstly, a bhikkhu is not without passion, desire, fondness, thirst, burning, and craving for sensuality. This being so, his mind does not incline to diligence, dedication, persistence, and striving. This is the first shackle of mind he has not severed.

Furthermore, a bhikkhu is not without passion for the body … This is the second shackle of mind.

Furthermore, a bhikkhu is not without passion for form … This is the third shackle of mind.

He eats as much as he likes until his stomach is full, then indulges in the pleasure of sleeping, lying down, and drowsing … This is the fourth shackle of mind.

He leads the renunciate life for the sake of a certain heavenly existence, thinking: ‘By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or renunciate life, may I become one of the gods!’ This being so, his mind does not incline to diligence, dedication, persistence, and striving. This is the fifth shackle of mind, he has not cut off. These are the five shackles of mind, he has not cut off.

When a bhikkhu has not abandoned these five obstinacies and cut off these five shackles of mind, it is not possible for him to achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching-and-discipline. 

When a bhikkhu has abandoned these five obstinacies and cut off these five shackles of mind, it is possible for him to achieve growth, improvement, and maturity in this teaching-and-discipline.

What are the five shackles of mind he has cut off? Firstly, a bhikkhu is without passion, desire, fondness, thirst, burning, and craving for sensuality. This being so, his mind inclines to diligence, zeal, persistence, and striving. This is the first shackle of mind he has cut off.

Furthermore, a bhikkhu is without passion for the body …

He is without passion for form …

He does not eat as much as he likes until his belly is full, then indulge in the pleasure of sleeping, lying down, and drowsing …

He does not lead the renunciate life for the sake of a certain heavenly existence, thinking: ‘By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or renunciate life, may I become one of the gods!’ This being so, his mind inclines to diligence, dedication, persistence, and striving. This is the fifth shackle of mind he has cut off. These are the five shackles of mind he has severed.

When a bhikkhu has relinquished these five obstinacies and severed these five shackles of mind, it is possible for him to achieve growth, improvement, and maturity in this teaching-and-discipline.

He develops the basis of spiritual ability that has composure due to interest and is coupled with active striving …  the basis of spiritual ability that has composure due to effort and is coupled with active striving … the basis of spiritual ability that has composure due to mind and is coupled with active striving … the basis of spiritual ability that has composure due to investigation and is coupled with active striving. And the fifth is merely zeal. A bhikkhu who possesses these fifteen factors, including zeal, is capable of breaking free, of awakening, of achieving the supreme safety from the yoke. Suppose there was a hen with eight or ten or twelve eggs. And she properly brooded over them to keep them warm and incubated. Even if that hen does not wish: ‘If only my chicks could emerge from the eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safely!’ Still they can emerge and hatch safely.

In the same way, a bhikkhu who possesses these fifteen factors, including zeal, is capable of breaking free, becoming awakened, and reaching the supreme safety from the yoke.”

That is what the Auspicious One said. Pleased, the bhikkhus delighted in what the Auspicious One said.
