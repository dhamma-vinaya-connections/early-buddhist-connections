# MN 64 - The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Auspicious One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Auspicious One addressed the bhikkhus, “Bhikkhus!”

“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Auspicious One said this:

“Bhikkhus, do you remember the five lower fetters taught by me?”

When he said this, Venerable Māluṅkyaputta said to him, “Venerable sir, I remember them.”

“But how do you remember them?”

“I remember the lower fetters taught by the Auspicious One as follows: personality-view, doubt, grasping at virtue-and-duty, sensual desire, and ill will. That is how I remember the five lower fetters taught by the Auspicious One.”

“Māluṅkyaputta, who in the world do you remember being taught the five lower fetters in that way? Would the wanderers of other teachings not fault you using the simile of the infant? For a young tender infant lying prone lying prone does not even have a concept of ‘personality’, so how could personality-view possibly arise in him? Yet, the underlying tendency to personality-view still underlies him.  A young tender infant lying prone lying prone does not even have a concept of ‘teachings’, so how could doubt about teachings possibly arise in him? Yet, the underlying tendency to doubt still underlies him. A young tender infant lying prone does not even have a concept of ‘virtue’, so how could grasping at virtue-and-duty possibly arise in him? Yet, the underlying tendency to grasping at virtue-and-duty still underlies him. A young tender infant lying prone does not even have a concept of ‘sensuality’, so how could sensual desire possibly arise in him? Yet, the underlying tendency to sensual desire still underlies him. A young tender infant lying prone does not even have a concept of ‘beings’, so how could ill will towards beings possibly arise in him? Yet, the underlying tendency to ill will still underlies him. Would the wanderers of other teachings not fault you, using the simile of the infant?”

When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Auspicious One, “Now is the time, Auspicious One! Now is the time, Excellent One! May the Auspicious One teach the five lower fetters. The bhikkhus will listen and remember it.”

“Well then, Ānanda, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”

“Yes, venerable sir” Ānanda replied. The Auspicious One said this:

“Ānanda, take an unlearned, ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They have not seen the righteous men, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the righteous men. They live with a mind that is prepossessed and overcome by personality-view, and they do not understand, as it is, the escape from arisen personality-view.  That personality-view is entrenched in them, not eliminated: it is a lower fetter.

They live with a mind that is prepossessed and overcome by doubt, and they do not understand as it is the escape from arisen doubt. That doubt is entrenched in them, not eliminated: it is a lower fetter.

They live with a mind that is prepossessed and overcome by the grasping at virtue-and-duty, and they do not understand as it is the escape from arisen grasping at virtue-and-duty. That grasping at virtue-and-duty is entrenched in them, not eliminated: it is a lower fetter.

They live with a mind that is prepossessed and overcome by sensual desire, and they do not understand as it is the escape from arisen sensual desire. That sensual desire is entrenched in them, not eliminated: it is a lower fetter.

They live with a mind that is prepossessed and overcome by ill will, and they do not understand as it is the escape from arisen ill will. That ill will is entrenched in them, not eliminated: it is a lower fetter.

But a learned noble disciple who has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones, who has seen the righteous men, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the righteous men, lives with a mind that is not prepossessed and overcome by personality-view, and they understand as it is the escape from arisen personality-view. That personality-view, along with any underlying tendency to it, is abandoned in them. 

They live with a mind that is not prepossessed and overcome by doubt, and they understand as it is the escape from arisen doubt. That doubt, along with any underlying tendency to it, is abandoned in them.

They live with a mind that is not prepossessed and overcome by the grasping at virtue-and-duty, and they understand as it is the escape from arisen grasping at virtue-and-duty. That grasping at virtue-and-duty, along with any underlying tendency to it, is abandoned in them.

They live with a mind that is not prepossessed and overcome by sensual desire, and they understand as it is the escape from arisen sensual desire. That sensual desire, along with any underlying tendency to it, is abandoned in them.

They live with a mind that is not prepossessed and overcome by ill will, and they understand as it is the escape from arisen ill will. That ill will, along with any underlying tendency to it, is abandoned in them.

There is a path and a practice for giving up the five lower fetters. It is not possible to know or see or give up the five lower fetters without relying on that path and that practice. Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood. It is not possible to remove the heartwood without having severed the bark and the softwood. In the same way, there is a path and a practice for giving up the five lower fetters. It is not possible to know or see or give up the five lower fetters without relying on that path and that practice.

But it is possible to know and see and give up the five lower fetters by relying on that path and that practice.

Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood. It is possible to extract the heartwood after having cut through the bark and the softwood. In the same way, there is a path and a practice for giving up the five lower fetters. It is possible to know and see and give up the five lower fetters by relying on that path and that practice. Suppose the river Ganges was full to the brim, so a crow could drink from it. Then along comes a feeble man, who thinks: ‘By swimming with my arms, I will safely cross to the far shore of the Ganges.’ But he is not able to do so. In the same way, when the Dhamma is being taught for the cessation of personality-view, someone whose mind does not leap at it, and is not confident, settled, and liberated in it, should be regarded as being like that feeble man. Suppose the river Ganges was full to the brim, so a crow could drink from it. Then along comes a strong man, who thinks: ‘By swimming with my arms, I will safely cross over to the far shore of the Ganges.’ And he is able to do so.

In the same way, when the Dhamma is being taught for the cessation of personality-view, someone whose mind leaps at it it, and is confident, settled, and liberated in it, should be regarded as being like that strong man.

And what, Ānanda, is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters? It is when a bhikkhu—owing to withdrawal from appropriation, abandonment of unbeneficial qualities, and complete calming of bodily discomforts—having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality, having withdrawn from unbeneficial phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of withdrawal, abides having entered upon the first jhāna.  He regards whatever is there that is included in form, feeling, perception, activations, and consciousness as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as a boil, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as empty, as not-self.  He averts his mind from those phenomena, and directs it to the Deathless element: ‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the appeasement of all activations, the relinquishment of all appropriation, the ending of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna.’ When he is steady in that, he attains the destruction of the influxes. If he does not attain the destruction of the influxes, then due to that passion and delight in the Dhamma, with the complete destruction of the five lower fetters, he reappears spontaneously. He is extinguished there, and is not liable to return from that world. This is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.

‘Furthermore, with the appeasement of thinking and pondering … abides having entered upon the second jhāna.’ third jhāna … fourth jhāna. He regards whatever is there that is included in form, feeling, perception, activations, and consciousness … He averts his mind from those phenomena … If he does not attain the destruction of the influxes … and is not liable to return from that world. This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.

Furthermore, a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of resistance, not attending to perceptions of multiplicity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, abides having entered upon the extent of infinite space. He regards whatever is there that is included in feeling, perception, activations, and consciousness … He averts his mind from those things … If he does not attain the destruction of the influxes … and is not liable to return from that world. This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.

Furthermore, a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted the extent of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, abides having entered upon the extent of infinite consciousness. He regards whatever is there that is included in feeling, perception, activations, and consciousness … He averts his mind from those things … If he does not attain the destruction of the influxes, … and is not liable to return from that world. This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.

Furthermore, a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted the extent of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, abides having entered upon the extent of nothingness. He regards whatever is there that is included in feeling, perception, activations, and consciousness … He averts his mind from those things … If he does not attain the destruction of the influxes … and is not liable to return from that world. This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.”

“Venerable sir, if this is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters, why is it that some bhikkhus here are liberated by mind while others are liberated by understanding?”

“In that case, I say that it is the multiplicity of their faculties.”

That is what the Auspicious One said. Pleased, Venerable Ānanda delighted in what the Auspicious One said.
