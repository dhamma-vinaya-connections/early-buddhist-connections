# MN 13 - The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Auspicious One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.

Then several bhikkhus donned their robes in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then it occurred to them, “It is too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī. Why do not we visit the monastery of the wanderers of other teachings?” Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers of other teachings and exchanged pleasantries with the wanderers there. When the amicable and cordial talk was over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them:

“Venerables, the ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of sensuality, and so do we. The ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of form, and so do we. The ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of feelings, and so do we. What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?”

Those bhikkhus neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers of other teachings. They arose from their seats, \[thinking\]: “We will learn the meaning of what was said from the Auspicious One himself.”

Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they approached the Auspicious One, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Auspicious One said:

“Bhikkhus, when wanderers of other teachings say this, you should say to them: ‘But venerables, what is the gratification of sensuality, what is its peril, and what is the escape from it?  What is the gratification of form, what is its peril, and what is the escape from it? What is the gratification of feelings, what is their peril, and what is the escape from them? Questioned like this, the wanderers of other teachings would be perplexed, and, in addition, would become frustrated. Why is that? Because this lies beyond their range. I do not see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them.

And what is the gratification of sensuality? There are these five avenues of sensuality. What five? Sights cognizable by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and enticing.  Sounds cognizable by the ear … Smells cognizable by the nose … Tastes cognizable by the tongue … Touches cognizable by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing. These are the five avenues of sensuality. The pleasure and joy that arise based on these five avenues of sensuality: this is the gratification of sensuality.

And what is the peril of sensuality?  It is when a son of a good family earns a living by means such as arithmetic, accounting, calculating, farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or some other profession. But he must face cold and heat, being hurt by the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles, and risking death from hunger and thirst. This, too, is a peril of sensuality that is presently evident, a mass of suffering with sensuality as it is reason, source, and basis, purely caused by sensuality.

If, when that son of a good family strives, labors, and makes an effort, wealth does not accrue to him, he sorrows, wails, and laments, beating his breast and falling into a state of confusion, saying: ‘Oh, my labor is futile! My efforts are fruitless!’ This, too, is a peril of sensuality that is presently evident, a mass of suffering with sensuality as it is reason, source, and basis, purely caused by sensuality.

If, when that son of a good family strives, labors, and makes an effort, wealth does accrue to him, he experiences unease and distress due to the need to protect it, \[thinking\]: ‘How can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?’ And even though he protects it and wards it, rulers or bandits take it, or fire consumes it, or flood sweeps it away, or unloved heirs take it. He sorrows, wails, and laments, beating his breast and falling into a muddle, \[thinking\]: ‘What once was mine is gone.’ This too is a peril of sensuality that is presently evident, a mass of suffering with sensuality as it is reason, source, and basis, purely caused by sensuality.

Furthermore, on account of sensuality, kings fight with kings, aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders. Mother fights with son, son with mother, father with son, and son with father. Brother fights with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, and friend fights with friend. Once they have started quarreling, arguing, and disputing, they attack each other with fists, stones, rods, and swords, and there they undergo death and deadly suffering. This too is a peril of sensuality that is presently evident, a mass of suffering with sensuality as it is reason, source, and basis, purely caused by sensuality.

Furthermore, on account of sensuality, \[people\] don their sword and shield, fasten their bow and arrows, and plunge into a battle massed on both sides, with arrows and spears flying and swords flashing. There, \[others\] strike them with arrows and spears and sever their heads, and there they undergo death and deadly suffering. This too is a peril of sensuality that is presently evident, a mass of suffering with sensuality as it is reason, source, and basis, purely caused by sensuality.

Furthermore, on account of sensuality, \[people\] don their sword and shield, fasten their bow and arrows, and charge wetly plastered bastions, with arrows and spears flying and swords flashing. There, \[others\] strike them with arrows and spears, splash them with dung, crush them with superior force, and sever their heads, and there they undergo death and deadly suffering. This too is a peril of sensuality that is presently evident, a mass of suffering with sensuality as it is reason, source, and basis, purely caused by sensuality.

Furthermore, on account of sensuality, \[people\] burgle houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, and commit adultery. The rulers arrest them and subject them to various punishments— whipping, caning, and clubbing; amputating hands or feet, or both; mutilating ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘Rāhu’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘bulrush twist’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded. And there they undergo death and deadly suffering. This too is a peril of sensuality that is presently evident, a mass of suffering with sensuality as it is reason, source, and basis, purely caused by sensuality.

Furthermore, on account of sensuality, people engage in misconduct by way of body, speech, and thought. on the dissolution of the body, after death, they reappear in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. This too is a peril of sensuality relating to the future, a mass of suffering with sensuality as it is reason, source, and basis, purely caused by sensuality.

And what is the escape from sensuality? Removing and abandoning desire-and-passion for sensuality: this is the escape from sensuality.

That any ascetics or brahmins who do not understand as they are the gratification, peril, and escape from sensuality in this way will themselves completely understand sensuality, or instruct another so that, practicing accordingly, they will completely understand sensuality—that is impossible. And that any ascetics or brahmins who do understand as they are the gratification, peril, and escape from sensuality in this way will themselves completely understand sensuality, or instruct another so that, practicing accordingly, they will completely understand sensuality—that is possible.

And what is the gratification of form?  Suppose there was a girl of the brahmins, aristocrats, or householders in her fifteenth or sixteenth year, neither too tall nor too short, neither too thin nor too fat, neither too dark nor too fair. Is she not at the height of her beauty and attractiveness?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“The pleasure and joy that arise based on this beauty and attractiveness is the gratification of form.

And what is the peril of form? Suppose that some time later, you were to see that same lady—eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old—bent double, crooked, leaning on a staff, trembling as she walks, ailing, past her prime, with teeth broken, hair grey and scanty or bald, skin wrinkled, and limbs blotchy.

What do you think, bhikkhus? Has not that former beauty vanished and the peril become clear?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“This is the peril of form.

Furthermore, suppose that you were to see that same lady sick, suffering, gravely ill, collapsed in her own urine and feces, being picked up by some and put down by others.

What do you think, bhikkhus? Has not that former beauty vanished and the peril become clear?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“This too is the peril of form.

Furthermore, suppose that you were to see that same lady as a corpse discarded in a charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering.

What do you think, bhikkhus? Has not that former beauty vanished and the peril become clear?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“This too is the peril of form.”

Furthermore, suppose that you were to see that same lady as a corpse discarded in a charnel ground. And it was being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, herons, dogs, tigers, leopards, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures …

Furthermore, suppose that you were to see that same lady as a corpse discarded in a charnel ground. And it had been reduced to a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together by sinews … a skeleton without flesh but smeared with blood, and held together by sinews … a skeleton without flesh and blood, held together by sinews … bones rid of sinews, scattered in every direction. Here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here a shin-bone, there a thigh-bone, here a hip-bone, there a rib-bone, here a back-bone, there an arm-bone, here a neck-bone, there a jaw-bone, here a tooth, there the skull. …

Furthermore, suppose that you were to see that same lady as a corpse discarded in a charnel ground. And it had been reduced to white bones, the color of shells … decrepit bones, heaped in a pile … bones rotted and crumbled to powder.

What do you think, bhikkhus? Has not that former beauty vanished and the peril become clear?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“This too is the peril of form.

And what is the escape from form? Removing and giving up desire-and-passion for form: this is the escape from form.

That any ascetics or brahmins who do not understand as they are the gratification, peril, and escape from form in this way will themselves completely understand form, or instruct another so that, practicing accordingly, they will completely understand form—that is impossible. That any ascetics or brahmins who do understand as they are the gratification, peril, and escape from form in this way will themselves completely understand form, or instruct another so that, practicing accordingly, they will completely understand form—that is possible.

And what is the gratification of feelings? It is when a bhikkhu, having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality, having withdrawn from unbeneficial phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of withdrawal, abides having entered upon the first jhāna. At that time, a bhikkhu does not intend to for his own affliction, for that of others, or for that of both; he feels only feelings that are non-afflictive. Non-affliction is the supreme gratification of feelings, I say. 

Furthermore, a bhikkhu abides having entered upon the second jhāna … third jhāna … fourth jhāna. At that time, a bhikkhu does not intend for his own affliction, for that of others, or for that of both; he feels only feelings that are non-afflictive. Non-affliction is the supreme gratification of feelings, I say.

And what is the peril of feelings? That feelings are impermanent, suffering, and of the nature to change: this is their peril.

And what is the escape from feelings? Removing and giving up desire-and-passion for feelings: this is the escape from feelings.

That any ascetics or brahmins who do not understand as they are the gratification, peril, and escape from feelings in this way will themselves completely understand feelings, or instruct another so that, practicing accordingly, they will completely understand feelings—that is impossible. That any ascetics or brahmins who do understand as they are the gratification, peril, and escape from feelings in this way will themselves completely understand feelings, or instruct another so that, practicing accordingly, they will completely understand feelings—that is possible.

That is what the Auspicious One said. Pleased, the bhikkhus delighted in what the Auspicious One said.
