# MN 29 - The Longer Simile of the Heartwood

Thus have I heard. At one time the Auspicious One was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain, not long after Devadatta had left. There the Auspicious One spoke to the bhikkhus in relation to Devadatta:

“Bhikkhus, take a clansman who has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, thinking, ‘I am swamped by birth, aging, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, displeasure, sadness, and distress. I am swamped by suffering, mired in suffering. Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’ When he has gone forth he generates gain, honor, and popularity. He is pleased with that, and his intention is fulfilled.  And he glorifies himself and puts others down because of that: ‘I am the one with gain, honor, and popularity. These other bhikkhus are obscure and insignificant.’ And so he becomes indulgent and falls into carelessness on account of that gain, honor, and popularity. Being careless, he lives in suffering.

Suppose there was a man in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he would come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But, passing over the heartwood, sapwood, bark, and shoots, he would cut off the branches and leaves and depart imagining they were heartwood. If a man with good eyesight saw him, he would say, ‘This gentleman does not know what heartwood, sapwood, bark, shoots, or branches and leaves are. That is why he passed them over, cut off the branches and leaves, and departed imagining they were heartwood. Whatever he needs to make from heartwood, he will not succeed.’ …

This is called a bhikkhu who has grabbed the branches and leaves of the renunciate life and stopped short with that.

Now take a clansman who has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness … When he has gone forth he generates gain, honor, and popularity. He is not pleased with that, and his intention is not fulfilled. He does not exalt himself and put others down on account of that. Nor does he becomes indulgent and fall into carelessness on account of that gain, honor, and popularity. Being heedful, he gains success in virtue. He is pleased with that, and his intention is fulfilled. And he glorifies himself and puts others down on account of that: ‘I am the one who is virtuous, of good character. These other bhikkhus are unvirtuous, of bad character.’ And so he becomes indulgent and falls into carelessness with regard to his success in virtue. Being careless, he lives in suffering.

Suppose there was a man in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he would come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But, passing over the heartwood, sapwood, and bark, he would cut off the shoots and depart imagining they were heartwood. If a man with good eyesight saw him, he would say, ‘This gentleman does not know what heartwood, sapwood, bark, shoots, or branches and leaves are. That is why he passed them over, cut off the shoots, and departed imagining they were heartwood. Whatever he needs to make from heartwood, he will not succeed.’ …

This is called a bhikkhu who has grabbed the shoots of the renunciate life and stopped short with that.

Next, take a clansman who has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness … When he has gone forth he generates gain, honor, and popularity. … Being heedful, he gains success in composure. He is pleased with that, and his intention is fulfilled. And he glorifies himself and disparages others on account of that: ‘I am the one with composure and a collected mind. These other bhikkhus lack composure, they have straying minds.’ And so he becomes indulgent and falls into carelessness with regard to that success in composure. Being careless, he lives in suffering.

Suppose there was a man in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he would come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But, passing over the heartwood and sapwood, he would cut off the bark and depart imagining it was heartwood. If a man with good eyesight saw him, he would say: ‘This gentleman does not know what heartwood, sapwood, bark, shoots, or branches and leaves are. That is why he passed them over, cut off the bark, and departed imagining it was heartwood. Whatever he needs to make from heartwood, he will not succeed.’ …

This is called a bhikkhu who has grabbed the bark of the renunciate life and stopped short with that.

Next, take a clansman who has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness … When he is gone forth he generates gain, honor, and popularity. … Being heedful, he gains knowledge-and-vision. He is pleased with that, and his intention is fulfilled. And he glorifies himself and disparages others on account of that, ‘I am the one who lives knowing and seeing. These other bhikkhus live without knowing and seeing.’ And so he becomes indulgent and falls into carelessness with regard to that knowledge-and-vision. Being careless, he lives in suffering.

Suppose there was a man in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he would come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But, passing over the heartwood, he would cut out the sapwood and depart imagining it was heartwood. If a man with good eyesight saw him, he would say, ‘This gentleman does not know what heartwood, sapwood, bark, shoots, or branches and leaves are. That is why he passed them over, cut out the sapwood, and departed imagining it was heartwood. Whatever he needs to make from heartwood, he will not succeed.’ …

This is a bhikkhu who has grabbed the sapwood of the renunciate life  and stopped short with that.

Next, take a clansman who has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, thinking, ‘I am swamped by birth, aging, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, displeasure, sadness, and distress. I am swamped by suffering, mired in suffering. Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’ When he has gone forth he generates gain, honor, and popularity. He is not pleased with that, and his intention is not fulfilled. He does not exalt himself and put others down on account of that. Nor does he becomes indulgent and fall into carelessness on account of that gain, honor, and popularity. Being heedful, he gains success in virtue. He is pleased with that, but his intention is not fulfilled. He does not exalt himself and put others down on account of that. Nor does he become indulgent and fall into carelessness with regard to that success in virtue. Being heedful, he gains success in composure. He is pleased with that, but his intention is not fulfilled. He does not exalt himself and put others down on account of that. Nor does he become indulgent and fall into carelessness with regard to that success in composure. Being heedful, he gains knowledge-and-vision. He is pleased with that, but his intention is not fulfilled. He does not exalt himself and put others down on account of that. Nor does he become indulgent and fall into carelessness with regard to that knowledge-and-vision. Being heedful, he gains irreversible liberation. And it is impossible for that bhikkhu to fall away from that irreversible liberation. 

Suppose there was a man in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he would come across a large tree standing with heartwood. He would cut out just the heartwood and depart knowing it was heartwood. If a man with good eyesight saw him, he would say, ‘This gentleman knows what heartwood, sapwood, bark, shoots, and branches and leaves are. That is why he cut out just the heartwood and departed knowing it was heartwood. Whatever he needs to make from heartwood, he will succeed.’

In the same way, take a clansman who goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, thinking: … It is impossible for that bhikkhu to fall away from that irreversible liberation.

And so, bhikkhus, this renunciate life is not led for the sake of gain, honor, and popularity, or for success in virtue, or for success in composure, or for knowledge-and-vision. Rather, the goal, heartwood, and final end of the renunciate life is the unshakable liberation of the mind.”

That is what the Auspicious One said. Pleased, the bhikkhus delighted in what the Auspicious One said.
