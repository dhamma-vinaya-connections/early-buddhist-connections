# MN 23 - The Ant-Hill

Thus have I heard. At one time the Auspicious One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time Venerable Kassapa the Prince was staying in the Dark Forest.

Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Dark Forest, approached Kassapa the Prince, stood to one side, and said:

“Bhikkhu, bhikkhu! This ant-hill fumes by night and flames by day. The brahmin said, ‘Take the scalpel and dig deeper, wise one!’

Having taken the scalpel, digging deeper, the wise one saw a crossbar: ‘A crossbar, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the crossbar! Take the scalpel and dig deeper, wise one!’

Having taken the scalpel, digging deeper, the wise one saw a bullfrog: ‘A bullfrog, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the bullfrog! Take the scalpel and dig deeper, wise one!’

Having taken the scalpel, digging deeper, the wise one saw a forked path: ‘A forked path, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the forked path! Take the scalpel and dig deeper, wise one!’

Having taken the scalpel, digging deeper, the wise one saw a sieve: ‘A sieve, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the sieve! Take the scalpel and dig deeper, wise one!’

Having taken the scalpel, digging deeper, the wise one saw a tortoise: ‘A tortoise, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the tortoise! Take the scalpel and dig deeper, wise one!’

Having taken the scalpel, digging deeper, the wise one saw a butcher’s knife and chopping block: ‘A butcher’s knife and chopping block, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the butcher’s knife and chopping block! Take the scalpel and dig deeper, wise one!’

Having taken the scalpel, digging deeper, the wise one saw a scrap of meat: ‘A scrap of meat, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the scrap of meat! Take the scalpel and dig deeper, wise one!’

Having taken the scalpel, digging deeper, the wise one saw a mighty serpent: ‘A mighty serpent, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Leave the mighty serpent! Do not disturb the mighty serpent! Worship the mighty serpent!’

Bhikkhu, go to the Auspicious One and ask him about this riddle. You should remember it in line with his answer. I do not see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to this riddle except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them.”

That is what that deity said before vanishing right there.

Then, when the night had passed, Kassapa the Prince went to the Auspicious One, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed him of the matter. Then he asked:

… “Venerable sir, what is the ant-hill? What is the fuming by night and flaming by day? Who is the brahmin, and who the wise one? What are the scalpel, the digging deeper, the crossbar, the bullfrog, the forked path, the sieve, the tortoise, the butcher’s knife and chopping block, and the scrap of meat? And what is the mighty serpent?”

“Bhikkhu, ‘ant-hill’ is a term for this body made up of the four great elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.

Thinking and pondering all night about what you did during the day— this is the fuming at night. The work you apply yourself to during the day by body, speech, and thought after thinking about it all night— this is the flaming by day.

‘Brahmin’ is a term for the Realized One, the Arahant, the Rightly Self-Awakened One. ‘Wise one’ is a term for the trainee bhikkhu.

‘Scalpel’ is a term for noble understanding. ‘Digging deeper’ is a term for rousing effort.

‘Crossbar’ is a term for ignorance. ‘Throw out the crossbar’ means ‘give up ignorance, Take the scalpel and dig deeper, wise one!’.

‘Bullfrog’ is a term for anger and distress. ‘Throw out the bullfrog’ means ‘give up anger and distress’ …

‘A forked path’ is a term for doubt. ‘Throw out the forked path’ means ‘give up doubt’ …

‘A sieve’ is a term for the five hindrances, that is: the hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, indolence-and-lethargy, restlessness-and-anxiety, and doubt. ‘Throw out the sieve’ means ‘give up the five hindrances’ …

‘Tortoise’ is a term for the five assumption-aggregates, that is: form, feeling, perception, activations, and consciousness. ‘Throw out the tortoise’ means ‘give up the five grasping aggregates’ …

‘Butcher’s knife and chopping block’ is a term for the five avenues of sensuality— sights cognizable by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and enticing. Sounds cognizable by the ear … Smells cognizable by the nose … Tastes cognizable by the tongue … Touches cognizable by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and enticing. ‘Throw out the butcher’s knife and chopping block’ means ‘give up the five avenues of sensuality’ …

‘Scrap of meat’ is a term for delight-and-passion. ‘Throw out the scrap of meat’ means ‘give up delight-and-passion’ …

‘Mighty serpent’ is a term for the bhikkhu who has destroyed the influxes. This is the meaning of: ‘Leave the mighty serpent! Do not disturb the mighty serpent! Worship the mighty serpent.’”

That is what the Auspicious One said. Pleased, Venerable Kassapa the Prince delighted in what the Auspicious One said.
