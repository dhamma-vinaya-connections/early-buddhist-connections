# MN 35 - The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka

Thus have I heard. At one time the Auspicious One was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.

Now at that time Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, was staying in Vesālī. He was a debater and astute speaker respected by many people. He was telling a crowd in Vesālī, “I do not see any ascetic or brahmin who would not shake and rock and tremble, sweating from the armpits, were I to take him on in debate—not a leader of an order or a community, or the teacher of a community, and not even one who claims to be a perfected one, a Rightly Self-Awakened One. Even an insentient post would shake and rock and tremble were I to take it on in debate. How much more then a human being!”

Then Venerable Assaji robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. As Saccaka was going for a walk he saw Assaji coming off in the distance. He approached him and exchanged pleasantries with him.

When the amicable and cordial talk was over, Saccaka stood to one side and said to Assaji, “Master Assaji, how does the ascetic Gotama guide his disciples? And on what topics does instruction to his disciples generally proceed?”

“Aggivessana, this is how the ascetic Gotama guides his disciples, and his instructions to disciples generally proceed on these topics: ‘Form, feeling, perception, activations, and consciousness are impermanent. Form, feeling, perception, activations, and consciousness are not-self. All activations are impermanent. All phenomena are not-self.’  This is how the ascetic Gotama guides his disciples, and how instruction to his disciples generally proceeds.”

“It is sad to hear, Master Assaji, that the ascetic Gotama has such a doctrine. Hopefully, some time or other I shall get to meet Master Gotama, and we can have a discussion. And hopefully I can dissuade him from this harmful view.”

Now at that time around five hundred Licchavis were sitting together at the town hall on some business. Then Saccaka approached them and said, “Come forth, good Licchavīs, come forth! Today I am going to have a discussion with the ascetic Gotama. If he stands by the position stated to me by one of his well-known disciples—a bhikkhu named Assaji—I shall take him on in debate and drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong man would grab a long-fleeced sheep by its fleece and drag it to and fro and round about! Taking him on in debate, I shall drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong brewer’s worker would toss a large brewer’s sieve into a deep lake, grab it by the corners, and drag it to and fro and round about! Taking him on in debate, I shall shake him down and about, and give him a beating, like a strong brewer’s mixer would grab a strainer by the corners and shake it down and about, and give it a beating! I shall play a game of ear-washing with the ascetic Gotama, like a sixty-year-old elephant would plunge into a deep lotus pond and play a game of ear-washing! Come forth, good Licchavīs, come forth! Today I am going to have a discussion with the ascetic Gotama.”

At that, some of the Licchavis said, “How can the ascetic Gotama refute Saccaka’s doctrine, when it is Saccaka who will refute Gotama’s doctrine?”

But some of the Licchavis said, “Who is Saccaka to refute the Auspicious One’s doctrine, when it is the Auspicious One who will refute Saccaka’s doctrine?”

Then Saccaka, escorted by the five hundred Licchavis, went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.

At that time several bhikkhus were walking in the open air. Then Saccaka approached them and said, “Good sirs, where is Master Gotama at present? For we wish to see him.”

“Aggivessana, the Auspicious One has plunged deep into the Great Wood and is sitting at the root of a tree for the day’s abiding.”

Then Saccaka, together with a large group of Licchavis, went to see the Auspicious One in the Great Wood, and exchanged pleasantries with him. When the amicable and cordial talk was over, he sat down to one side. Before sitting down to one side, some of the Licchavīs bowed, some exchanged pleasantries, some held up their joined palms toward the Auspicious One, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.

Then Saccaka said to the Auspicious One, “I would like to ask Master Gotama about a certain point, if you would take the time to answer.”

“Ask what you wish, Aggivessana.”

“How does the ascetic Gotama guide his disciples? And on what topics does instruction to his disciples generally proceed?”

“This is how I guide my disciples, and my instructions to disciples generally proceed on these topics: ‘Bhikkhus, form, feeling, perception, activations, and consciousness are impermanent. ‘Bhikkhus, form, feeling, perception, activations, and consciousness are not-self. All activations are impermanent. All phenomena are not-self.’ This is how I guide my disciples, and how instruction to my disciples generally proceeds.”

“A simile strikes me, Master Gotama.”

“Then speak as it occurs to you, ” said the Auspicious One.

“All the plants and seeds that achieve growth, increase, and maturity do so depending on the earth and grounded on the earth. All the hard work that gets done depends on the earth and is grounded on the earth.

In the same way, an individual’s self is form. Grounded on form he creates merit and demerit. An individual’s self is feeling … perception … activations … consciousness. Grounded on consciousness he creates merit and demerit.”

“Aggivessana, are you not saying this: ‘Form is my self, feeling is my self, perception is my self, activations are my self, consciousness is my self’?”

“Indeed, Master Gotama, that is what I am saying. And this large crowd agrees with me!”

“What has this big crowd to do with you? Please just unpack your own statement.”

“Then, Master Gotama, what I am saying is this: ‘Form is my self, feeling is my self, perception is my self, activations are my self, consciousness is my self’.”

“Well then, Aggivessana, I will ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, Aggivessana? Consider an anointed aristocratic king such as Pasenadi of Kosala or Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha. Would they have the power in their own realm to execute those who have incurred execution, fine those who have incurred fines, or banish those who have incurred banishment?”

“An anointed king would have such power, Master Gotama. Even federations such as the Vajjis and Mallas have such power in their own realm. So of course an anointed king such as Pasenadi or Ajātasattu would wield such power, as is his right.”

“What do you think, Aggivessana? When you say, ‘Form is my self,’ do you have power over that form to say: ‘May my form be like this! May it not be like that’?” When he said this, Saccaka kept silent. The Auspicious One asked the question a second time, but Saccaka still kept silent. So the Auspicious One said to Saccaka, “Answer now, Aggivessana. Now is not the time for silence. If someone fails to answer a legitimate question when asked three times by the Realized One, his head explodes into seven pieces there and then.”

Now at that time the spirit Vajirapāṇī, taking up a burning iron thunderbolt, blazing and glowing, stood in the sky above Saccaka, thinking, “If this Saccaka does not answer when asked a third time, I will blow his head into seven pieces there and then!” And both the Auspicious One and Saccaka could see Vajirapāṇī.

Saccaka was terrified, shocked, and awestruck. Looking to the Auspicious One for shelter, protection, and refuge, he said, “Ask me, Master Gotama. I will answer.”

“What do you think, Aggivessana? When you say, ‘Form is my self,’ do you have power over that form to say: ‘May my form be like this! May it not be like that’?”

“No, Master Gotama.” 

“Think about it, Aggivessana! You should think before answering. What you said before and what you said after do not match up. What do you think, Aggivessana? When you say, ‘Feeling is my self,’ do you have power over that feeling to say: ‘May my feeling be like this! May it not be like that’?” 

“No, Master Gotama.”

“Think about it, Aggivessana! You should think before answering. What you said before and what you said after do not match up. What do you think, Aggivessana? When you say, ‘Perception is my self,’ do you have power over that perception to say: ‘May my perception be like this! May it not be like that’?”

“No, Master Gotama.”

“Think about it, Aggivessana! You should think before answering. What you said before and what you said after do not match up. What do you think, Aggivessana? When you say, ‘Activities are my self,’ do you have power over those activations to say: ‘May my activations be like this! May they not be like that’?”

“No, Master Gotama.” 

“Think about it, Aggivessana! You should think before answering. What you said before and what you said after do not match up. What do you think, Aggivessana? When you say, ‘Consciousness is my self,’ do you have power over that consciousness to say: ‘May my consciousness be like this! May it not be like that’?”

“No, Master Gotama.” 

“Think about it, Aggivessana! You should think before answering. What you said before and what you said after do not match up. What do you think, Aggivessana? Is form permanent or impermanent?”

“Impermanent.”

“But if it is impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”

“Suffering.”

“But if it is impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”

“No, Master Gotama.” 

“What do you think, Aggivessana? Is feeling … perception … activations … consciousness permanent or impermanent?”

“Impermanent.” 

“But if it is impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”

“Suffering.”

“But if it is impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”

“No, Master Gotama.”

“What do you think, Aggivessana? Consider someone who clings to, holds to, and rests upon suffering, regarding it thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’ Would such a one be able to completely understand suffering himself, or live having cast away suffering?”

“How could they? No, Master Gotama.”

“What do you think, Aggivessana? This being so, are you not someone who clings to, holds to, and rests upon suffering, regarding it thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”

“How could I not? Yes, Master Gotama.”

“Suppose, Aggivessana, there was a man in need of heartwood. Wandering in search of heartwood, he would take a sharp axe and enter a forest. There he would see a big banana tree, straight and young and grown free of defects. He would cut it down at the base, cut off the top, and unroll the coiled sheaths. But he would not even find sapwood, much less heartwood.

In the same way, when pursued, pressed, and grilled by me on your own doctrine, you turn out to be void, hollow, and mistaken. But it was you who stated before the assembly of Vesālī: ‘I do not see any ascetic or brahmin who would not shake and rock and tremble, sweating from the armpits, were I to take him on in debate—not a leader of an order or a community, or the teacher of a community, and not even one who claims to be a perfected one, a Rightly Self-Awakened One. Even an insentient post would shake and rock and tremble were I to take it on in debate. How much more then a human being!’ But sweat is pouring from your forehead; it is soaked through your robe and drips on the ground. While I now have no sweat on my body.” So the Auspicious One revealed his gold-colored body to the assembly. When this was said, Saccaka sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.

Knowing this, the Licchavi Dummukha said to the Auspicious One, “A simile strikes me, Auspicious One.”

“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Auspicious One.

“Venerable sir, suppose there was a lotus pond not far from a town or village, and a crab lived there. Then several boys or girls would leave the town or village and go to the pond, where they would pull out the crab and put it on dry land. Whenever that crab extended a claw, those boys or girls would snap, crack, and break it off with a stick or a stone. And when that crab’s claws had all been snapped, cracked, and broken off it would not be able to return down into that lotus pond. In the same way, venerable sir, the Auspicious One has snapped, cracked, and broken off all Saccaka is twists, ducks, and dodges. Now he cannot get near the Auspicious One again looking for a debate.”

But Saccaka said to him, “Hold on, Dummukha, hold on! I was not talking with you, I was talking with Master Gotama.

Master Gotama, leave aside that statement of mine—made also by various other ascetics and brahmins. It was just nonsense. How do you define a disciple of Master Gotama who follows instructions and responds to advice; who has gone beyond doubt, gotten rid of indecision, gained assurance, and is independent of others in the Teacher’s instructions?”

“It is when one of my disciples sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: all form—with right understanding as it is: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ He sees any kind of feeling … perception … activations … consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: all consciousness—with right understanding as it is: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ That is how to define one of my disciples who follows instructions and responds to advice; who has gone beyond doubt, gotten rid of indecision, gained assurance, and is independent of others in the Teacher’s instructions.”

“But how do you define a bhikkhu who is an Arahant, with influxes destroyed, who is consummate, has done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved the highest goal, utterly destroyed the fetter of being, and is liberated by right understanding?”

“It is when, having seen any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: all form—with right understanding as it is: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self,’ a bhikkhu is liberated through non-assumption.  Having seen any kind of feeling … perception … activations … Having seen any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: all consciousness—with right understanding as it is: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self,’ a bhikkhu is liberated through non-assumption. That is how a bhikkhu is an Arahant, with influxes destroyed, who is consummate, has done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved the highest goal, utterly destroyed the fetter of being, and is liberated by right understanding.

A bhikkhu whose mind is liberated like this has three unsurpassable qualities: unsurpassable seeing, unsurpassable practice, and unsurpassable liberation. He honors, respects, esteems, and venerates only the Realized One: ‘The Auspicious One is awakened, tamed, appeased, crossed over, and extinguished. And he teaches the Dhamma for awakening, taming, appeasing, crossing over, and extinguishing.’”

When he had spoken, Saccaka said to him, “Master Gotama, it was rude and impudent of me to imagine I could attack you in debate. For a man might find safety after attacking a rutting elephant, but not after attacking Master Gotama. A man might find safety after attacking a blazing mass of fire, but not after attacking Master Gotama. A man might find safety after attacking a poisonous viper, but not after attacking Master Gotama. It was rude and impudent of me to imagine I could attack Master Gotama in debate. Would Master Gotama together with the bhikkhu Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?” The Auspicious One consented with silence.

Then, knowing that the Auspicious One had consented, Saccaka addressed those Licchavis, “Listen, gentlemen. I have invited the ascetic Gotama together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus for tomorrow’s meal. You may all bring me what you think is suitable.”

Then, when the night had passed, those Licchavis presented Saccaka with an offering of five hundred servings of food. And Saccaka had fine fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Auspicious One informed of the time, saying, “It is time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.”

Then the Auspicious One robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Saccaka’s park, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Then Saccaka served and satisfied the bhikkhu Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with fine fresh and cooked foods. When the Auspicious One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Saccaka took a low seat and sat to one side.

Then Saccaka said to the Auspicious One, “Master Gotama, may the merit and the growth of merit in this gift be for the happiness of the donors.”

“Aggivessana, whatever comes from giving to a recipient of a religious donation such as yourself—who is not rid of passion, aversion, and muddledness—will accrue to the donors. Whatever comes from giving to a recipient of an offering such as myself—who is rid of passion, aversion, and muddledness—will accrue to you.”
