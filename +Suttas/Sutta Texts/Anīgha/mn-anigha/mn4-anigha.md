# MN 4 - Fear and Dread

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Auspicious One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.

Then the brahmin Jānussoṇi approached the Auspicious One, and exchanged pleasantries with him. When the amicable and cordial talk was over, he sat down to one side and said to the Auspicious One:

“Master Gotama, those sons of good families who have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith in Master Gotama have Master Gotama to lead the way, assist them, and give them encouragement. And those people follow Master Gotama’s example.”

“That is exactly how it is, Brahmin.”

“But Master Gotama, remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest are challenging. Seclusion is hard, and finding joy in solitude is difficult. The forests seem to rob the mind of a bhikkhu who cannot achieve composure.” 

“That is exactly how it is, Brahmin.

Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought, ‘Remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest are challenging. Seclusion is hard, and finding joy in solitude is difficult. The forests seem to rob the mind of a bhikkhu who cannot achieve composure.’

Then I thought, ‘There are ascetics and brahmins with unpurified conduct of body, speech, and thought who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. Those ascetics and brahmins give rise to unbeneficial fear and dread because of this defect in their conduct. But I do not frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with unpurified conduct of body, speech, and thought. My conduct is purified. I am one of those noble ones who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with purified conduct of body, speech, and thought.’ Seeing this purity of conduct in myself, I felt even more unconcerned about staying in the forest.

Then I thought, ‘There are ascetics and brahmins with unpurified livelihood who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. Those ascetics and brahmins give rise to unbeneficial fear and dread because of this defect in their livelihood. But I do not frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with unpurified livelihood. My livelihood is purified. I am one of those noble ones who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with purified livelihood.’ Seeing this purity of livelihood in myself, I felt even more unconcerned about staying in the forest.

Then I thought, ‘There are ascetics and brahmins who have longing and acute passion for sensuality… I am without longing …’

‘There are ascetics and brahmins with minds of ill-will, with malicious intentions … I have a mind of friendliness …’

‘There are ascetics and brahmins overcome with indolence-and-lethargy … I am without indolence-and-lethargy …’

‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are restless, with unappeased minds … My mind is appeased …’

‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are doubting and uncertain … I have gone beyond doubt …’

‘There are ascetics and brahmins who exalt themselves and denigrate others … I do not exalt myself and denigrate others …’

‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are cowardly and easy to frighten … I am free from trepidation …’

‘There are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy possessions, honor, and popularity … I have few wishes …’

‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are lazy and lack effort … I am effortful …’

‘There are ascetics and brahmins who lack recollectedness-and-awareness … My recollectedness is established …’

‘There are ascetics and brahmins who lack composure, with straying minds … I am endowed with composure …’

‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are witless and obtuse who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. Those ascetics and brahmins give rise to unbeneficial fear and dread because of the defect of witlessness and stupidity. But I do not frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest, witless and obtuse. I am endowed with understanding. I am one of those noble ones who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest, endowed with understanding.’ Seeing this accomplishment of understanding in myself, I felt even more unconcerned about staying in the forest.

Then I thought, ‘There are certain nights that are well-known and designated: the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight. On such nights, why don’t I stay in frightening and hair-raising shrines in parks, forests, and trees? In such lodgings, hopefully I might see that fear and dread.’ Sometime later, that is what I did. As I was staying there, a deer approached, or a peacock snapped a twig, or the wind rustled the leaves. Then I thought, ‘Is this that fear and dread coming?’ Then I thought, ‘Why am I always expecting that fear and dread to come? Why don’t I dispel that fear and dread in whichever way I am, when it comes?’ Then that fear and dread came upon me, as I was walking. I did not stand still, or sit down, or lie down until I had dispelled that fear and dread while walking. Then that fear and dread came upon me, as I was standing. I did not walk, or sit down, or lie down until I had dispelled that fear and dread while standing. Then that fear and dread came upon me as I was sitting. I did not lie down or stand still or walk until I had dispelled that fear and dread while sitting. Then that fear and dread came upon me as I was lying down. I did not sit up or stand still or walk until I had dispelled that fear and dread while lying down.

There are some ascetics and brahmins who perceive that it is day when in fact it is night, or perceive that it is night when in fact it is day.  This way of being of theirs is muddled, I say. I perceive that it is night when in fact it is night, and perceive that it is day when in fact it is day. And if there is anyone of whom it may be rightly said that a being not liable to muddledness has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans, it is of me that this should be said.

My effort was roused up and steadfast, my recollectedness was established and lucid, my body was tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind was composed and collected. Then, having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality, having withdrawn from unbeneficial phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of withdrawal, I abided having entered upon the first jhāna. With the appeasement of thinking and pondering, with internal confidence and collectedness of mind, without thinking or pondering and with joy and ease born of composure, I abided having entered upon the second jhāna. With the fading of joy, I abided equanimous, recollected, and aware, experiencing ease with the body. I abided having entered upon the third jhāna, with regard to which the noble ones say “one abides equanimous, recollected, and at ease.” With the giving up of ease and unease—and with the ending of joys and upsets beforehand—without ease or unease, with purity of equanimity and recollectedness, I abided having entered upon the fourth jhāna.

When my mind had become composed like this—purified, bright, flawless, free from, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it towards the knowledge of recollecting of past lives. I recollected many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand births; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. I remembered: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and displeasure, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place, I reappeared somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and displeasure, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place, I reappeared here.’ And so, I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.

This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for one who lives heedful, diligent, and resolute.

When my mind had become composed like this—purified, bright, flawless, free from, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it towards the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings.  With the divine eye that is purified and superhuman, I saw beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good or a bad destination. I understood how beings reappear according to their actions: ‘These beings engaged in misconduct by way of body, speech, and thought. They found fault with the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act in line with that wrong view. On the dissolution of the body, after death, they reappear in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These other beings, however, engaged in good conduct by way of body, speech, and thought. They did not find fault with the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act in line with that right view. On the dissolution of the body, after death, they reappear in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with the divine eye that is purified and superhuman, I saw beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good or a bad destination. I understood how beings reappear according to their actions.

This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed, and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed, and light arose, as happens for one who lives heedful, diligent, and resolute.

When my mind had become composed like this—purified, bright, flawless, free from, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it towards the knowledge of the destruction of the influxes. I understood as it is: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. I understood as it is: ‘These are influxes’ … ‘This is the origin of influxes’ … ‘This is the cessation of influxes’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of influxes’.

Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was liberated from the defilements of sensuality, being, and ignorance. When it was liberated, I knew it was liberated.

I understood: ‘Birth is destroyed, the renunciate life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there will be no more of this.’”

This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the final watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed, and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed, and light arose, as happens for one who abides heedful, diligent, and resolute.

Brahmin, you might think: ‘Perhaps the Master Gotama is not free from passion, aversion, and muddledness even today, and that is why he still frequents remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.’ But you should not see it like this. I see two reasons to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. I see an easeful abiding in the present experience for myself, and I have compassion for future generations.”

“Indeed, Master Gotama has compassion for future generations, since he is an Arahant, a Rightly Self-Awakened One. Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so those with good eyesight can see what is there, Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
