# MN 56 - With Upāli

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Auspicious One was staying near Nāḷandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove.

At that time, the Jain Nāṭaputta was residing at Nāḷandā together with a large assembly of Jains. Then the Jain Dīgha Tapassī wandered for alms in Nāḷandā. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to Pāvārika’s mango grove. There, he approached the Auspicious One, and exchanged pleasantries with him.

When the amicable and cordial talk was over, he stood to one side. The Auspicious One said to him, “There are seats, Tapassī. Please sit if you wish.”

When he said this, Dīgha Tapassī took a low seat and sat to one side. The Auspicious One said to him, “Tapassī, how many kinds of action does the Jain Nāṭaputta describe for the performance of bad actions, for the production of bad actions?”

“Venerable Gotama, the Jain Nāṭaputta does not usually speak in terms of ‘actions’. He usually speaks in terms of ‘rods’.”

“Then how many kinds of rod does the Jain Nāṭaputta describe for the performance of bad actions, for the production of bad actions?”

“The Jain Nāṭaputta describes three kinds of rod for the performance of bad actions, for the production of bad actions: the bodily rod, the verbal rod, and the mental rod.”

“But are these kinds of rod all distinct from each other?”

“Yes, each is quite distinct.”

“Of the three rods thus analyzed and differentiated, which rod does the Jain Nāṭaputta describe as being the most blameworthy for the performance of bad actions, for the production of bad actions: the bodily rod, the verbal rod, or the mental rod?”

The Jain Nāṭaputta describes the bodily rod as being the most blameworthy for the performance of bad actions, for the production of bad actions, less so the verbal rod or the mental rod.”

“Do you say the bodily rod, Tapassī?”

“I say the bodily rod, Venerable Gotama.”

“Do you say the bodily rod, Tapassī?”

“I say the bodily rod, Venerable Gotama.”

“Do you say the bodily rod, Tapassī?”

“I say the bodily rod, Venerable Gotama.”

Thus, the Auspicious One made Dīgha Tapassī stand by this point up to the third time.

When this was said, Dīgha Tapassī said to the Auspicious One, “But Venerable Gotama, how many kinds of rod do you describe for the performance of bad actions, for the production of bad actions?”

“Tapassī, the Realized One does not usually speak in terms of ‘rods’. He usually speaks in terms of ‘actions’.”

“Then how many kinds of action do you describe for the performance of bad actions, for the production of bad actions?”

“I describe three kinds of action for the production of bad actions, for the production of bad actions: bodily action, verbal action, and mental action.”

“But are these kinds of action all distinct from each other?”

“Yes, each is quite distinct.”

“Of the three actions thus analyzed and differentiated, which action do you describe as being the most blameworthy for the performance of bad actions, for the production of bad actions: bodily actions, verbal actions, or mental actions?”

“I describe mental action as being the most blameworthy for the performance of bad actions, for the production of bad actions, less so bodily action or verbal action.”

“Do you say mental action, Venerable Gotama?”

“I say mental action, Tapassī.”

“Do you say mental action, Venerable Gotama?”

“I say mental action, Tapassī.”

“Do you say mental action, Venerable Gotama?”

“I say mental action, Tapassī.”

Thus, the Jain Dīgha Tapassī made the Auspicious One stand by this point up to the third time, after which he arose from his seat and went to see the Jain Nāṭaputta.

Now at that time, the Jain Nāṭaputta was sitting together with a large assembly of Bālaki laypeople headed by Upāli. The Jain Nāṭaputta saw Dīgha Tapassī approaching in the distance and said to him, “Tapassī, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”

“Venerable sir, just now, I have come from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.”

“But did you have some discussion with him?”

“I did.”

“And what kind of discussion did you have with him?” Dīgha Tapassī informed the Jain Nāṭaputta of all they had discussed. When he had spoken, the Jain Nāṭaputta said to him, “Good, good, Tapassī! Dīgha Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like a learned disciple who rightly understands his teacher’s instructions. For what does the measly mental rod matter when compared with the substantial bodily rod? Rather, the bodily rod is the most blameworthy for the performance of bad actions, for the production of bad actions, less so the verbal rod or the mental rod.”

When he said this, the householder Upāli said to him, “Good, venerable Dīgha Tapassī! The Venerable Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like a learned disciple who rightly understands his teacher’s instructions. For what does the measly mental rod matter when compared with the substantial bodily rod? Rather, the bodily rod is the most blameworthy for the performance of bad actions, for the production of bad actions, less so the verbal rod or the mental rod.

Now, venerable sir, I shall go and refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine regarding this point. If he stands by the position that he stated to Dīgha Tapassī, then just as a strong man would seize a shaggy sheep by its fleece and drag it to and fro and round about, so too I shall drag the ascetic Gotama to and fro and round about in debate. Just as a strong brewer’s worker would toss a large brewer’s sieve into a deep water tank, seize it by the corners, and drag it to and fro and round about, so too I shall drag the ascetic Gotama to and fro and round about in debate. Just as a strong brewer’s mixer would seize a strainer by the corners and shake it up and down and squeeze it, so too I shall shake the ascetic Gotama up and down and squeeze him in debate. Just as a sixty-year-old elephant would plunge into a deep lotus pond and play the game called “hemp-washing,” I shall, as it were, play the game of “hemp-washing” with the ascetic Gotama. Well, venerable sir, I had better go and refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine regarding this point.”

“Go, householder, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine on this point. For either I should do so, or Dīgha Tapassī, or you.”

When he said this, Dīgha Tapassī said to the Jain Nāṭaputta, “Venerable sir, I am not pleased by the householder Upāli rebutting the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine. For the ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a conversion magic, and uses it to convert the disciples of other teachings.”

“It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that Upāli could become the ascetic Gotama’s disciple. But it is possible that the ascetic Gotama could become Upāli’s disciple. Go, householder, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine on this point. For either I should do so, or Dīgha Tapassī, or you.”

For a second time … and a third time, Dīgha Tapassī said to the Jain Nāṭaputta, “Venerable sir, I am not pleased by the householder Upāli rebutting the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine. For the ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a conversion magic, and uses it to convert the disciples of other teachings.”

“It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that Upāli could become the ascetic Gotama’s disciple. But it is possible that the ascetic Gotama could become Upāli’s disciple. Go, householder, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine on this point. For either I should do so, or Dīgha Tapassī, or you.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” replied the householder Upāli to the Jain Nāṭaputta. He arose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled him, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Auspicious One, bowed, took his seat to one side, and said to him, “Venerable sir, did the Jain Dīgha Tapassī come here?”

“He did, householder.”

“But did you have some discussion with him?”

“I did.”

“And what kind of discussion did you have with him?”

Then the Auspicious One informed Upāli of all they had discussed.

When he said this, the householder Upāli said this: “Good, venerable Tapassī! The Venerable Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like a learned disciple who rightly understands his teacher’s instructions. For does the measly mental rod matter when compared with the substantial bodily rod? Rather, the bodily rod is the most blameworthy for the performance of bad actions, for the production of bad actions, less so the verbal rod or the mental rod.”

“Householder, so long as you debate on the basis of truth, we can have some discussion about this.”

“I will debate on the basis of truth, venerable sir. Let us have some discussion about this.”

“What do you think, householder? Take a Jain who is sick, suffering, gravely ill. He rejects cold water and uses only hot water. Not getting cold water, he might die. Now, where does the Jain Nāṭaputta say he would reappear?”

“Venerable sir, there are gods called ‘mind-bound’. He would reappear there. Why is that? Because he died attached to the mind.”

“Think about it, householder! You should think before answering. What you said before and what you said after do not correspond. But you said that you would debate on the basis of truth.”

“Even though the Auspicious One says this, still the bodily rod is the most blameworthy for the performance of bad actions, for the production of bad actions, less so the verbal rod or the mental rod.”

“What do you think, householder? Take a Jain who is restrained in all that is to be restrained, is bridled in all that is to be restrained, has cast off all that is to be restrained, and is curbed in all that is to be restrained. When going out and coming back, he accidentally injures many small creatures. Now, what result does the Jain Nāṭaputta say he would incur?”

“Venerable sir, the Jain Nāṭaputta says that unintentional acts are not particularly blameworthy.”

“But if they are intentional?”

“Then they are very blameworthy.”

“But where does the Jain Nāṭaputta say that intention is classified?”

“In the mental rod, venerable sir.”

“Think about it, householder! You should think before answering. What you said before and what you said after do not correspond. But you said that you would debate on the basis of truth.”

“Even though the Auspicious One says this, still, the bodily rod is the most blameworthy for the performance of bad actions, for the production of bad actions, less so the verbal rod or the mental rod.”

“What do you think, householder? Is this Nāḷandā successful and prosperous, populous, full of people?”

“Indeed it is, venerable sir.”

“What do you think, householder? Suppose a man were to come along with a drawn sword and say: ‘In one moment, I will reduce all the living creatures within the bounds of Nāḷandā to one heap and mass of flesh!’ What do you think, householder? Could he do that?”

“Venerable sir, even ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty men could not do that. What does one measly man matter?”

“What do you think, householder? Suppose an ascetic or brahmin with psychic power, who has achieved mastery of the mind, were to come along and say: ‘I will reduce Nāḷandā to ashes with a single malicious mental act!’ What do you think, householder? Could he do that?”

“Venerable sir, an ascetic or brahmin with psychic power, who has achieved mastery of the mind, could reduce ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty Nāḷandās to ashes with a single malicious act of will. What does one measly Nāḷandā matter?”

“Think about it, householder! You should think before answering. What you said before and what you said after do not correspond. But you said that you would debate on the basis of truth.”

“Even though the Auspicious One says this, still the bodily rod is the most blameworthy for the performance of bad actions, for the production of bad actions, less so the verbal rod or the mental rod.”

“What do you think, householder? Have you heard how the wildernesses of Daṇḍaka, Kaliṅga, Mejjha, and Mātaṅga came to be that way?”

“I have, venerable sir.”

“What have you heard?”

“I heard that it was because of a malicious act of will by sages that the wildernesses of Daṇḍaka, Kaliṅga, Mejjha, and Mātaṅga came to be that way.”

“Think about it, householder! You should think before answering. What you said before and what you said after do not correspond. But you said that you would debate on the basis of truth.”

“Venerable sir, I was already pleased and satisfied by the Auspicious One’s very first simile. Nevertheless, I wanted to hear the Auspicious One’s various solutions to the problem, so I thought I would oppose him in this way.

Excellent, venerable sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or indicating the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark, so people with clear eyes can see what is there, the Auspicious One has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Auspicious One, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. From this day forth, may the Auspicious One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

“Householder, you should act after careful consideration. It is good for prominent people such as yourself to act after careful consideration.”

“Now, I am even more pleased and satisfied with the Auspicious One, since he advises me to act after careful consideration. For if the followers of other teachings were to gain me as a disciple, they would carry a banner all over Nāḷandā, saying: ‘The householder Upāli has become our disciple!’ And yet, the Auspicious One says: ‘Householder, you should act after careful consideration. It is good for prominent people such as yourself to act after careful consideration.’

For a second time, I go for refuge to the Auspicious One, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. From this day forth, may the Auspicious One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

“For a long time now, householder, your family has been a well-spring of support for the Jains. You should consider giving to them when they come.”

“Now I am even more pleased and satisfied with the Auspicious One, since he tells me to consider giving to the Jains when they come. Venerable sir, I have heard the following: ‘The ascetic Gotama says this: “Gifts should only be given to me, not to others. Gifts should only be given to my disciples, not to the disciples of others. Only what is given to me is very fruitful, not what is given to others. Only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to the disciples of others.”’ Yet the Auspicious One encourages me to give to the Jains. Well, venerable sir, we will know the proper time for that.

For a third time, I go for refuge to the Auspicious One, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. From this day forth, may the Auspicious One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

Then the Auspicious One taught the householder Upāli step by step, with a discourse on generosity, virtue, and heaven. He explained the peril, inferiority, and defilement of sensuality, and the benefit of renunciation. And, when he knew that Upāli’s mind was ready, pliable, free from hindrances, elated, and confident, he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth free from stains would properly absorb dye, so too, in that very seat, the stainless, immaculate eye of the Dhamma arose in Upāli: “Whatever has the nature of arising has the nature of ceasing.” Then Upāli saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, dispelled indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Auspicious One: 

“Well, venerable sir, now I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.”

“Householder, go at your convenience.”

And then the householder Upāli, having delighted in and expressed appreciation for what the Auspicious One said, arose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Auspicious One, keeping him on his right. Then, he returned to his own home, where he addressed the gatekeeper, “My good gatekeeper, from this day forth, close the gate to the Jains, and open it for the Auspicious One’s bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, laymen, and laywomen. If any Jains come, say this to them: ‘Wait, venerable sir, do not enter. From now on, the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama. His gate is closed to the Jains, and opened for the Auspicious One’s bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, laymen, and laywomen. If you require almsfood, wait here, they will bring it to you.’”

“Yes, sir,” replied the gatekeeper.

Dīgha Tapassī heard that Upāli had become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama. He went to the Jain Nāṭaputta and said to him, “Venerable sir, they say that the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama.”

“It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that Upāli could become the ascetic Gotama’s disciple. But it is possible that the ascetic Gotama could become Upāli’s disciple.”

For a second time, … and a third time, Dīgha Tapassī said to the Jain Nāṭaputta, “Venerable sir, they say that the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama.”

“It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that Upāli could become the ascetic Gotama’s disciple. But it is possible that the ascetic Gotama could become Upāli’s disciple.”

“Well, venerable sir, I had better go and ascertain whether or not Upāli has become Gotama’s disciple.”

“Go, Tapassī, and ascertain whether or not Upāli has become the ascetic Gotama’s disciple.”

Then Dīgha Tapassī went to Upāli’s home. The gatekeeper saw him approaching in the distance and said to him, “Wait, venerable sir, do not enter. Henceforth, the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama. His gate is closed to Nigaṇthas, and open for the Auspicious One’s bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, laymen, and laywomen. If you require almsfood, wait here, they will bring it to you.”

Saying, “No, venerable, I do not require almsfood,” he turned back and went to the Jain Nāṭaputta and said to him, “Venerable sir, it is indeed true that Upāli has become Gotama’s disciple. Venerable sir, I could not persuade you to accept that it was not advisable for the householder Upāli to rebut the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine. For the ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a conversion magic, and uses it to convert the disciples of other teachings. The householder Upāli has been converted by the ascetic Gotama’s conversion magic!”

“It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotama’s disciple. But it is possible that Gotama could become Upāli’s disciple.”

For a second time … and a third time, Dīgha Tapassī told the Jain Nāṭaputta that it was indeed true.

“It is impossible …

Well, Tapassī, I had better go and ascertain for myself whether or not Upāli has become Gotama’s disciple.”

Then the Jain Nāṭaputta went to Upāli’s home together with a large following of Jains. The gatekeeper saw him approaching in the distance and said to him: “Wait, venerable sir, do not enter. From now on, the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama. His gate is closed to Nigaṇthas, and open for the Auspicious One’s bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, laymen, and laywomen. If you require almsfood, wait here, they will bring it to you.”

“Very well, my good gatekeeper, go to Upāli and say: ‘Sir, the Jain Nāṭaputta is waiting outside the gates together with a large following of Jains. He wishes to see you.’”

“Yes, venerable sir,” replied the gatekeeper. He went to Upāli and relayed what was said. Upāli said to him, “In that case, my good gatekeeper, prepare seats in the hall of the middle gate.”

“Yes, sir,” replied the gatekeeper. He did as he was asked, then returned to Upāli and said, “Sir, seats have been prepared in the hall of the middle gate. Please go at your convenience.”

Then Upāli went to the hall of the middle gate, where he sat on the highest and finest seat. He addressed the gatekeeper, “In that case, my good gatekeeper, go to the Jain Nāṭaputta and say to him: ‘Venerable sir, the householder Upāli says you may enter if you wish.’”

“Yes, sir,” replied the gatekeeper. He went to the Jain Nāṭaputta and relayed what was said.

Then the Jain Nāṭaputta went to the hall of the middle gate together with a large following of Jains. Previously, when Upāli saw the Jain Nāṭaputta coming, he would go out to greet him and, having wiped off with his upper robe and straightened the highest and finest seat, he would have him sit there. But today, having seated himself on the highest and finest seat, he said to the Jain Nāṭaputta, “There are seats, venerable sir. Please sit if you wish.”

When he said this, the Jain Nāṭaputta said to him: “You are insane, householder! You are a fool! You said: ‘I will go and refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.’ But you return caught in the vast net of his doctrine. Suppose a man went with to castrate someone, but returned castrated. Or he went to remove someone’s eyes, but returned with eyes removed. In the same way, you said: ‘I will go and refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.’ But you return caught in the vast net of his doctrine. You have been converted by the ascetic Gotama’s conversion magic!”

“Venerable sir, this conversion magic is excellent. This conversion magic is lovely! If my loved ones—relatives and kin—were to be converted by this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness. If all the aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials were to be converted by this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness. If the whole world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—were to be converted by this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness. Well then, venerable sir, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile, some wise men understand the meaning of what is said.

Once upon a time there was an old brahmin, elderly and senior. His wife was a young brahmin lady who was pregnant and about to give birth. Then she said to the brahmin, ‘Go, brahmin, buy an infant monkey from the market and bring it back so it can be a playmate for my child.’

When she said this, the brahmin said to her, ‘Wait, my dear, until you give birth. If your child is a boy, I will buy you a male monkey, but if it is a girl, I will buy a female monkey.’

For a second time, and a third time, she said to the brahmin, ‘Go, brahmin, buy an infant monkey from the market and bring it back so it can be a playmate for my child.’

Then that brahmin, because of his love for the brahmin lady, bought a male infant monkey at the market, brought it to her, and said, ‘I have bought this male infant monkey for you so it can be a playmate for your child.’

When he said this, she said to him, ‘Go, brahmin, take this monkey to Rattapāṇi the dyer and say, “Sir Rattapāṇi, I wish to have this monkey dyed the color of yellow greasepaint, pounded and re-pounded, and pressed on both sides.”’

Then that brahmin, because of his love for the brahmin lady, took the monkey to Rattapāṇi the dyer and said, ‘Sir Rattapāṇi, I wish to have this monkey dyed the color of yellow greasepaint, pounded and re-pounded, and pressed out on both sides.’

When he said this, Rattapāṇi said to him, ‘Sir, this monkey can withstand a dying, but not a pounding or a pressing.’

In the same way, the doctrine of the foolish Jains can withstand a dyeing—for fools, not for the wise—but cannot withstand being scrutinized or pressed. 

Then, some time later, that brahmin took a new pair of garments to Rattapāṇi the dyer and said, ‘My good Rattapāṇi, I wish to have this new pair of garments dyed the color of yellow greasepaint, pounded and re-pounded, and pressed on both sides.’

When he said this, Rattapāṇi said to him, ‘Sir, this pair of garments can withstand a dying, a pounding, and a pressing.’

In the same way, the doctrine of the Buddha can withstand a dyeing—for the wise, not for fools—and it can withstand being scrutinized and pressed.”

“Householder, the king and his retinue know you as a disciple of the Jain Nāṭaputta. Whose disciple should we remember you as?”

When he had spoken, the householder Upāli stood up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms in the direction of the Auspicious One, and said to the Jain Nāṭaputta, “Well then, venerable sir, hear whose disciple I am:

> The wise one, free of muddledness, free from recalcitrance, victor in battle;  he is untroubled and even-minded, mature in virtue and of excellent understanding; immaculate in the midst of disarray:  he is the Auspicious One, and I am his disciple.
> 
> Free from indecision and content, he has spat out the world’s bait, joyful; he has completed the ascetic’s task as a human, a man who bears his final body; he is beyond compare, he is stainless: he is the Auspicious One, and I am his disciple.
> 
> He is free of anxiety, he is skillful, he is a trainer, an excellent charioteer; supreme and of splendid nature, free from doubt, his light shines forth; he has cut off conceit, he is a hero: he is the Auspicious One, and I am his disciple.
> 
> The chief bull, immeasurable, profound, sagacious; he is the maker of safety, knowledgeable, standing in the Dhamma and restrained; he has overcome bonds and is liberated: he is the Auspicious One, and I am his disciple.
> 
> He is a giant, living remotely, he has destroyed the fetters and is liberated; he is skilled in debate and cleansed, with banner lowered, passionless; he is tamed, and free from proliferation: he is the Auspicious One, and I am his disciple.
> 
> He is the seventh sage, free of deceit, with three knowledges, he has attained to divinity, he has bathed, he is well-studied, he is tranquil, he understands what is experienced; he is Sakka the Able, Purindada the Firstgiver: he is the Auspicious One, and I am his disciple.
> 
> The noble one, self-developed, he has attained the goal and explains it; he is mindful, discerning, neither leaning forward nor pulling back, he is imperturbable, attained to mastery: he is the Auspicious One, and I am his disciple.
> 
> Emerged, he practices jhāna,  not going along internally, he is pure, Detached and benevolent; secluded, he has reached the peak, crossed over, he helps others across: he is the Auspicious One, and I am his disciple.
> 
> He is peaceful, of vast understanding with great wisdom, he is free from greed; he is the Realized One, the Excellent One, unrivaled, unequaled, assured, and subtle: he is the Auspicious One, and I am his disciple.
> 
> He has cut off craving and is awakened, free of fuming, unsullied; a mighty entity worthy of offerings, best of men, inestimable, grand, he has attained the pinnacle of glory: he is the Auspicious One, and I am his disciple.”

“But when did you compose these praises of the ascetic Gotama’s, householder?”

“Venerable sir, suppose there was a large heap of many different flowers. A deft garland-maker or their apprentice could tie them into a colorful garland. In the same way, the Auspicious One has many qualities to praise, many hundreds of such qualities. Who, venerable sir, would not praise the praiseworthy?”

Unable to bear this honor paid to the Auspicious One, the Jain Nāṭaputta spewed hot blood from his mouth there and then.
