# MN 10 - Establishments of Remembrance

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Auspicious One was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadhamma. There the Auspicious One addressed the bhikkhus, “Bhikkhus!”

“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Auspicious One said this: 

“Bhikkhus, this is the path that leads squarely to the purification of beings, to overcoming sorrow and lamentation, to making an end of suffering and upset, to accomplishing the method, and to realizing Nibbāna, namely the four establishments of recollectedness. 

What four? Here, a bhikkhu abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body—diligent, aware, and recollected, having dispelled longing and upset with regard to the world.  He abides maintaining perspective of feelings concurrently with feelings—diligent, aware, and recollected, having dispelled longing and upset with regard to the world. He abides maintaining perspective of the mind concurrently with the mind—diligent, aware, and recollected, having dispelled longing and upset with regard to the world. He abides maintaining perspective of phenomena concurrently with phenomena—diligent, aware, and recollected, having dispelled longing and upset with regard to the world.

## 1\. The Body

### 1.1. Remembrance of Breathing


And how does a bhikkhu abide maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body?

Here, a bhikkhu—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets his body straight, and establishes recollectedness at the fore.  Recollected, he breathes in; recollected, he breathes out. 

Breathing in long, he understands: ‘I am breathing in long.’ Breathing out long, he understands: ‘I am breathing out long.’ 

Breathing in short, he understands: ‘I am breathing in short.’ Breathing out short, he understands: ‘I am breathing out short.’

He trains like this: ‘I will breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ He trains like this: ‘I will breathe out experiencing the whole body.’ 

He trains like this: ‘I will breathe in calming the bodily activity.’ He trains like this: ‘I will breathe out calming the bodily activity.’

Just as a skilled lathe worker or his apprentice, when making a long turn understands ‘I am making a long turn,’ or when making a short turn understands ‘I am making a short turn,’ so too, breathing in long, a bhikkhu understands ‘I am breathing in long’ … he trains like this: ‘I will breathe out calming the bodily activity.’

And so, he abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally. He abides maintaining perspective of the body as liable to rise, or as liable to wane, or as liable to both rise and wane concurrently with the body.  Or the memory that ‘the body is there’ is established for him just to the extent necessary for knowledge and recollectedness. He abides disengaged, not taking up anything in the world. 

That is how a bhikkhu abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body.

### 1.2. The Postures

Furthermore, when a bhikkhu is walking, he understands: ‘I am walking.’ When standing, he understands: ‘I am standing.’ When sitting, he understands: ‘I am sitting.’ And when lying down, he understands: ‘I am lying down.’  Whatever posture his body is in, he understands that.

And so, he abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally. He abides maintaining perspective of the body as liable to rise, or as liable to wane, or as liable to both rise and wane concurrently with the body. Or the memory that ‘the body is there’ is established for him just to the extent necessary for knowledge and recollectedness. He abides disengaged, not taking up anything in the world.

That too, is how a bhikkhu abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body.

### 1.3. Awareness

Furthermore, a bhikkhu acts with awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent. 

And so, he abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body internally …

That too, is how a bhikkhu abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body.

### 1.4. Non-beauty

Furthermore, a bhikkhu reflects on his own body, up from the soles of the feet, and down from the tips of the hairs, as full of many kinds of impure things surrounded by skin.  ‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, mucus, synovial fluid, urine.’ 

It is as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with various kinds of grains, such as fine rice, wheat, mung beans, peas, sesame, and ordinary rice. And a man with good eyesight were to open it and reflect on the contents: ‘These grains are fine rice, these are wheat, these are mung beans, these are peas, these are sesame, and these are ordinary rice.’

And so, he abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body internally …

That, too, is how a bhikkhu abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body.

### 1.5. The Elements

Furthermore, a bhikkhu reflects on his own body, regardless of its placement or posture, according to the elements:  ‘In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’

It is as if a skilled butcher or butcher’s apprentice were to kill a cow and sit down at the crossroads with the meat cut into portions.

And so, he abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body internally …

That too, is how a bhikkhu abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body.

### 1.6. The Charnel Ground Contemplations

Furthermore, suppose a bhikkhu were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering. He would compare it with his own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’ And so, he abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body internally …

That too, is how a bhikkhu abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body.

Furthermore, suppose he were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, herons, dogs, tigers, leopards, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures. He would compare it with his own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’ And so, he abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body internally …

That too, is how a bhikkhu abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body.

Furthermore, suppose he were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together by sinews …

A skeleton without flesh but smeared with blood, and held together by sinews …

A skeleton rid of flesh and blood, held together by sinews …

Bones rid of sinews scattered in every direction. Here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here a shin-bone, there a thigh-bone, here a hip-bone, there a rib-bone, here a back-bone, there an arm-bone, here a neck-bone, there a jaw-bone, here a tooth, there the skull …

White bones, the color of shells …

Decrepit bones, heaped in a pile …

Bones rotted and crumbled to powder. He would compare it with his own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’

And so, he abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally. He abides maintaining perspective of the body as liable to rise, or as liable to wane, or as liable to both rise and wane concurrently with the body. Or the memory that ‘the body is there’ is established for him just to the extent necessary for knowledge and recollectedness. He abides disengaged, not taking up anything in the world.

That too is how a bhikkhu abides maintaining perspective of the body concurrently with the body.

## 2\. Feelings

Here, a bhikkhu, feeling a pleasant feeling, understands: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling.’

Feeling an unpleasant feeling, he understands: ‘I feel an unpleasant feeling.’

Feeling a neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling.’

Feeling a pleasant feeling of the flesh, he understands: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling of the flesh.’

Feeling a pleasant feeling not of the flesh, he understands: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling not of the flesh.’ 

Feeling an unpleasant feeling of the flesh, he understands: ‘I feel an unpleasant feeling of the flesh.’

Feeling an unpleasant feeling not of the flesh, he understands: ‘I feel an unpleasant feeling not of the flesh.’

Feeling a neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling of the flesh, he understands: ‘I feel a neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling of the flesh.’

Feeling a neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling not of the flesh, he understands: ‘I feel a neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling not of the flesh.’

And so, he abides maintaining perspective of feelings concurrently with feelings internally, externally, and both internally and externally. He abides maintaining perspective of feelings as liable to rise, or as liable to wane, or as liable to both rise and wane concurrently with feelings. Or the memory that ‘feeling is there’ is established for him just to the extent necessary for knowledge and recollectedness. He abides disengaged, not taking up anything in the world.

That is how a bhikkhu abides maintaining perspective of feelings concurrently with feelings. 

## 3\. Mind

And how does a bhikkhu abide, maintaining perspective of the mind concurrently with the mind?

Here, a bhikkhu understands mind with passion as ‘mind with passion,’ and mind without passion as ‘mind without passion.’ He understands mind with aversion as ‘mind with aversion,’ and mind without aversion as ‘mind without aversion.’ He understands mind with muddledness as ‘mind with muddledness,’ and mind without muddledness as ‘mind without muddledness.’ He understands constricted mind as ‘constricted mind,’ and scattered mind as ‘scattered mind.’ He understands expansive mind as ‘expansive mind,’ and unexpansive mind as ‘unexpansive mind.’ He understands mind that is not supreme as ‘mind that is not supreme,’ and mind that is supreme as ‘mind that is supreme.’ He understands mind composed as ‘mind composed,’ and mind not composed as ‘mind not composed.’ He understands liberated mind as ‘liberated mind,’ and unliberated mind as ‘unliberated mind.’

And so, he abides maintaining perspective of the mind concurrently with the mind internally, externally, and both internally and externally.
