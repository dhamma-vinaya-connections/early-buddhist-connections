# MN 31 - The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga

Thus have I heard. At one time the Auspicious One was staying at Ñātika in the brick house.

Now at that time the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila were staying in the sal forest park at Gosiṅga.

Then, in the late afternoon, the Auspicious One came out of retreat and went to that park. The park keeper saw the Auspicious One coming off in the distance and said to him, “Do not come into this park, ascetic. There are three clansmen here who live desiring \[to be only by\] themselves. Do not disturb them.”

Anuruddha heard the park keeper conversing with the Auspicious One, and said to him, “Do not keep the Auspicious One out, good park keeper! Our Teacher, the Auspicious One, has arrived.” Then Anuruddha went to Nandiya and Kimbila, and said to them, “Come forth, venerables, come forth! Our Teacher, the Auspicious One, has arrived!”

Then Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila came out to greet the Auspicious One. One received his bowl and robe, one spread out a seat, and one set out water for washing his feet. The Auspicious One sat on the seat spread out, and washed his feet. Those venerables bowed and sat down to one side.

The Auspicious One said to Anuruddha, “I hope you are keeping well, Anuruddha and friends; I hope you are getting by. And I hope you are having no trouble getting almsfood.”

“We are keeping well, Auspicious One, we are getting by. And we have no trouble getting almsfood.”

“I hope you are living in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes?” 

“Indeed, venerable sir, we live in harmony like this.”

“But how do you live this way?”

“In this case, venerable sir, I think, ‘I am fortunate, so very fortunate, to live together with fellow renunciates such as these.’ My bodily, verbal, and mental actions towards these venerables are friendly, whether in public or in private. I think, ‘Why don’t I set aside my own ideas and just go along with these venerables’ ideas?’ And that is what I do. Though we are different in body, venerable sir, we are one in mind, it seems to me.” 

And the venerables Nandiya and Kimbila spoke likewise, and they added: “That is how we live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.”

“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends! But I hope you are living heedful, diligent, and resolute?”

“Indeed, venerable sir, we live heedful, diligent, and resolute.”

“But how do you live this way?”

“In this case, venerable sir, whoever returns first from almsround prepares the seats, and puts out the drinking water and the rubbish bin. If there is anything left over, whoever returns last eats it if he likes. Otherwise he throws it out where there is little that grows, or drops it into water that has no living creatures. Then he puts away the seats, drinking water, and rubbish bin, and sweeps the refectory. If someone sees that the pot of water for washing, drinking, or the toilet is empty he sets it up. If he cannot do it, he summons another with a wave of the hand, and he sets it up by lending each other a hand to lift. But we do not break into speech for that reason. And every five days we sit together for the whole night and discuss the teachings. That is how we live heedful, diligent, and resolute.”

“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends! But as you live diligently like this, have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones, an easeful abiding?”

“How could we not, venerable sir? Whenever we want, having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality, having withdrawn from unbeneficial phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of withdrawal, we abide having entered upon the first jhāna. This is a superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones, an easeful abiding, that we have achieved while living heedful, diligent, and resolute.”

“Good, good! But have you achieved any other superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones, an easeful abiding, for surmounting and calming that abiding?”

“How could we not, venerable sir? Whenever we want, with the appeasement of thinking and pondering, with internal confidence and collectedness of mind, without thinking or pondering and with joy and ease born of composure, we abide having entered upon the second jhāna. This is another superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones, an easeful abiding, that we have achieved for surmounting and calming that abiding.

“Good, good! But have you achieved any other superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones, an easeful abiding, for surmounting and calming that abiding?”

“How could we not, venerable sir? Whenever we want, with the fading of joy, we abide equanimous, recollected and aware, experiencing ease with the body. We abide having entered upon the third jhāna, with regard to which the noble ones say “one abides equanimous, recollected, and at ease.” This is another superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones, an easeful abiding, that we have achieved for surmounting and calming that abiding.

“Good, good! But have you achieved any other superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones, an easeful abiding, for surmounting and calming that abiding?”

“How could we not, venerable sir? Whenever we want, with the giving up of ease and unease—and with the ending of joys and upsets beforehand—without ease or unease, with purity of equanimity and recollectedness, we abide having entered upon the fourth jhāna. This is another superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones, an easeful abiding, that we have achieved for surmounting and calming that abiding.

“Good, good! But have you achieved any other superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones, an easeful abiding, for surmounting and calming that abiding?”

“How could we not, venerable sir? Whenever we want, having fully surmounted perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of resistance, not attending to perceptions of multiplicity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, we abide having entered upon the extent of infinite space. This is another superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones, an easeful abiding, that we have achieved for surmounting and calming that abiding.

“Good, good! But have you achieved any other superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones, an easeful abiding, for surmounting and calming that abiding?”

“How could we not, venerable sir? Whenever we want, going totally beyond the extent of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, we abide in the extent of infinite consciousness. … Having fully surmounted the extent of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing’, we abide having entered upon the extent of nothingness. … Having fully surmounted the extent of nothingness, we abide having entered upon the extent of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. This is another superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones, an easeful abiding, that we have achieved for surmounting and calming that abiding.

“Good, good! But have you achieved any other superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones, an easeful abiding, for surmounting and calming that abiding?”

“How could we not, venerable sir? Whenever we want, having fully surmounted the extent of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, we abide having entered upon the cessation of perception-and-feeling. And, having seen with understanding, our influxes have been destroyed. This is another superhuman distinction in knowledge-and-vision worthy of the noble ones, an easeful abiding, that we have achieved for surmounting and calming that abiding. And we do not see any better or finer way of abiding at ease than this.”

“Good, good! There is no better or finer easeful abiding than this.”

Then the Auspicious One educated, encouraged, uplifted, and inspired the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.

The venerables then accompanied the Auspicious One for a little way before turning back. Nandiya and Kimbila said to Anuruddha, “Did we ever tell you that we had gained such and such abidings and attainments, up to the destruction of the influxes, as you revealed to the Auspicious One?”

“The venerables did not tell me that they had gained such abidings and attainments. But I discovered it by comprehending your minds, and deities also told me. So I answered when the Auspicious One directly asked about it.”

Then the native spirit Dīgha Parajana approached the Auspicious One, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, “The Vajjis are lucky! The Vajjian people are so very lucky that the Realized One, the Arahant, the Rightly Self-Awakened One stays there, as well as these three clansmen, the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila.”

Hearing the cry of Dīgha Parajana, the Earth Gods raised the cry …

Hearing the cry of the Earth Gods, the Gods of the Four Great Kings … the Gods of the Thirty-Three … the Gods of Yama … the Contented Gods … the Gods Who Delight in Creation … the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others … the Gods of Brahmā’s Host raised the cry, “The Vajjis are fortunate! The Vajjian people are so very fortunate that the Realized One, the Arahant, the Rightly Self-Awakened One stays there, as well as these three clansmen, the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila.”

And so at that moment, in that instant, those venerables were known as far as the Brahmā realm.

“That is so true, Dīgha! That is so true! If the family from which those three clansmen went forth from the lay life to homelessness were to recollect those venerables with confident mind, that would be for that family’s lasting welfare and happiness. If the family circle … village … town … city … country … all the aristocrats … all the brahmins … all the peasants … all the workers were to recollect those venerables with confident mind, that would be for all those workers’ lasting welfare and happiness.

If the whole world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—were to recollect those venerables with confident mind, that would be for the whole world’s lasting welfare and happiness.

See, Dīgha, how those three clansmen are practicing for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!”

That is what the Auspicious One said. Pleased, the spirit Dīgha Parajana delighted in what the Auspicious One said.
