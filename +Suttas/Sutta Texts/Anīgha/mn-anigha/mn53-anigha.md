# MN 53 - A Trainee


Thus have I heard. At one time, the Auspicious One was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.

Now at that time, a new town hall had recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all. Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu approached the Auspicious One, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:

“Venerable sir, a new town hall has recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all. May the Auspicious One be the first to use it, and only then will the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu use it. That would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu.” The Auspicious One consented with silence.

Then, knowing that the Auspicious One had consented, the Sakyans arose from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Auspicious One, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the new town hall, where they spread carpets throughout, prepared seats, arranged a water jar, and placed an oil lamp. Then they returned to the Auspicious One, bowed, stood to one side, and informed him of their preparations, saying, “Venerable sir, please come at your convenience.”

Then the Auspicious One dressed and, taking his bowl and robe, proceeded to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Having washed his feet, he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing east. The Saṅgha of bhikkhus also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Auspicious One directly in front of them. The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Auspicious One directly in front of them.

The Auspicious One spent much of the night educating, encouraging, invigorating, and inspiring the Sakyans with a Dhamma talk. Then he addressed Venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, speak as you deem appropriate about the practicing trainee to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. My back is aching, I will stretch it.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” Ānanda replied. And then, the Auspicious One spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—recollected and aware, having set the intention to arise.

Then Ānanda addressed Mahānāma the Sakyan:

“Mahānāma, there is the case where a noble disciple is accomplished in virtue, guards the sense doors, is moderate in eating, and is dedicated to vigilance. They have seven good qualities, and they attain the four jhānas—easeful abidings in the present experience that involve an elevated mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.

And how is a noble disciple accomplished in virtue? It is when a noble disciple is virtuous and lives restrained by the code of conduct, endowed with proper behavior and a suitable environment. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they train in the training rules. That is how a noble disciple is accomplished in virtue.

And how does a noble disciple guard the sense doors? When they see a sight with the eye, they do not grasp at signs and features of it on account of which—due to abiding with the eye faculty unrestrained—bad, unbeneficial thoughts of longing and upset would arise in them. They practice to restrain that; they guard the eye faculty and bring about the restraint of the eye faculty. When they hear a sound with the ear … When they smell an odor with the nose … When they taste a flavor with the tongue … When they touch a touch with the body … When they cognize a phenomenon with the mental faculty, they do not adhere to signs and features of it on account of which—due to abiding with the mental faculty unrestrained—bad, unbeneficial thoughts of longing and upset would arise in them. They practice to restrain that; they guard the mental faculty and bring about the restraint of the mental faculty. That is how a noble disciple guards the sense doors. 

And how is a noble disciple moderate in eating? It is when a noble disciple eats with reflection in light of the origin:  ‘Not for entertainment, indulgence, beautification, or adornment, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support the renunciate life. In this way, I shall put an end to old feelings and not give rise to new feelings, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’  That is how a noble disciple is moderate in eating.

And how is a noble disciple dedicated to vigilance? During the day, a noble disciple cleanses their mind of obstructive states while walking or sitting. During the first watch of the night, a noble disciple cleanses their mind of obstructive states while walking or sitting. During the second watch of the night, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—recollected and aware, having set the intention to arise. Having arisen in the last watch of the night, they continue to cleanse the mind of obstructive states while waking or sitting. That is how a noble disciple is dedicated to vigilance. 

And how does a noble disciple have seven good qualities? It is when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening: ‘That Auspicious One is an Arahant, a Rightly Self-Awakened One, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’

They have a sense of shame. They are ashamed of bad conduct by way of body, speech, and thought, and ashamed of acquiring any bad, unbeneficial qualities.

They have a sense of remorse. They are remorseful for bad conduct by way of body, speech, and thought, and remorseful of acquiring any bad, unbeneficial qualities. 

They are highly learned, remembering and keeping what they have learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the \[right\] meaning and phrasing, and which describe a renunciate life that is entirely complete and pure—such teachings he has learned much of, remembered, rehearsed verbally, investigated with the mind, and penetrated well by view.

They live with effort aroused for relinquishing unbeneficial qualities and embracing beneficial qualities. They are resilient, vigorous, and not abating their efforts with respect to beneficial qualities.

They are recollected. They possess utmost recollectedness and judiciousness, and can remember and recall what was said and done from a considerable time past.

They are wise. They have the wisdom related to arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. That is how a noble disciple has seven good qualities.

And how does a noble disciple attain the four jhānas—easeful abidings in the present experience that involve an elevated mind—at will, without trouble or difficulty? It is when a noble disciple, completely disjoined from sensuality … abides having entered upon the first jhāna. second jhāna … third jhāna … fourth jhāna. That is how a noble disciple attains the four jhānas—easeful abidings in the present experience that involve an elevated mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.

When a noble disciple is accomplished in virtue, guards the sense doors, is moderate in eating, and is dedicated to vigilance, has seven good qualities, and attains the four jhānas—easeful abidings in the present experience that involve an elevated mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty, they are called a noble disciple who is a practicing trainee. Their eggs are unspoiled, and they are capable of emerging from their shell, becoming awakened, and achieving the supreme safety from the yoke. Suppose there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs. And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. Even if that chicken does not wish, ‘If only my chicks could emerge from the eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safely!’ Still, they can emerge and hatch safely.

In the same way, when a noble disciple is endowed with all these factors, they are called a noble disciple who is a practicing trainee. Their eggs are unspoiled, and they are capable of emerging from their shell, becoming awakened, and achieving the supreme safety from the yoke.

Relying on this supreme purity of recollectedness and equanimity, that noble disciple recollects their many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand births; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. … And so, they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. This is their first emergence, like a chick from an eggshell.

Relying on this supreme purity of recollectedness and equanimity, that noble disciple, with the divine eye that is purified and superhuman, sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. … They understand how beings are reborn according to their actions. This is their second emergence, like a chick from an eggshell.

Relying on this supreme purity of recollectedness and equanimity, that noble disciple abides having entered upon the liberation by mind and liberation by understanding that is devoid of influxes, having for themselves comprehended and realized it right in the present experience. This is their third emergence, like a chick from an eggshell.

A noble disciple’s conduct includes the following: being accomplished in virtue, guarding the sense doors, moderation in eating, being dedicated to wakefulness, having seven good qualities, and attaining the four jhānas when they wish, without trouble or difficulty.

A noble disciple’s knowledge includes the following: recollecting their past lives, the divine eye that is purified and superhuman, and the fact that they abide having entered upon the liberation by mind and liberation by understanding that is devoid of influxes, having for themselves comprehended and realized it directly in the present experience.

This noble disciple is said to be ‘accomplished in knowledge’, and also ‘accomplished in conduct’, and also ‘accomplished in knowledge and conduct’.

And Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra also spoke this verse:

> ‘The aristocrat is best among people who take clan as the standard. But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct is best among gods and humans.’

And that verse was well sung by Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra, not poorly sung; well spoken, not poorly spoken, beneficial, not harmful, and it was approved by the Auspicious One.”

Then the Auspicious One arose and said to Venerable Ānanda, “Good, good, Ānanda! It is good that you spoke to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu about the practicing trainee.”

This is what Venerable Ānanda said, and the teacher approved. Pleased, the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu delighted in what Venerable Ānanda said.
