# MN 52 - The Wealthy Citizen

Thus have I heard. At one time, Venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva.

Now at that time, the householder Dasama, a wealthy citizen, had arrived at Pāṭaliputta on some business. He went to the Chicken Monastery, approached a certain bhikkhu, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Venerable sir, where is Venerable Ānanda now staying? For I want to see him.”

“Householder, Venerable Ānanda is staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva.”

Then the householder Dasama, having concluded his business there, went to the little village of Beluva in Vesālī to see Ānanda. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to Ānanda:

“Venerable Ānanda, is there one thing that has been rightly explained by the Auspicious One—who knows and sees, the Arahant, the Rightly Self-Awakened One—practicing which a heedful, diligent, and resolute bhikkhu’s mind is liberated, his influxes are destroyed, and he arrives at the supreme safety from the yoke?”

“There is, householder.”

“And what is that one thing?”

“It is when a bhikkhu, having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality, having withdrawn from unbeneficial phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of withdrawal, abides having entered upon the first jhāna. He reflects: ‘Even this first jhāna is produced and devised.’ He understands: ‘But whatever is produced and devised is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ Abiding in that, he attains the destruction of the influxes.  If he does not attain the destruction of the influxes, with the destruction of the five lower fetters, he reappears spontaneously, because of that passion and delight in the Dhamma. He is extinguished there, and is not liable to return from that world. This is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Auspicious One—who knows and sees, the Arahant, the Rightly Self-Awakened One—practicing which a heedful, diligent, and resolute bhikkhu’s mind is liberated, his influxes are destroyed, and he arrives at the supreme safety from the yoke.

Furthermore, with the appeasement of thinking and pondering, with internal confidence and collectedness of mind … third jhāna … fourth jhāna …

Furthermore, a bhikkhu abides having pervaded with a mind of friendliness the first direction, likewise second, likewise third, likewise the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, he abides having pervaded the whole world with a mind of friendliness—abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free of enmity and ill will.  He reflects: ‘Even this liberation of mind through friendliness is produced and devised.’ He understands: ‘But whatever is produced and devised is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ …

He abides having pervaded with a mind of compassion … contentment … equanimity …

Furthermore, a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of resistance, not attending to perceptions of multiplicity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, abides having entered upon the extent of infinite space. He reflects: ‘Even this attainment of the extent of infinite space is produced, made by choices.’ He understands: ‘But whatever is produced and devised is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ …

Furthermore, a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted the extent of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, abides having entered upon the extent of infinite consciousness. …

Furthermore, a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted the extent of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, abides having entered upon the extent of nothingness. … He reflects: ‘Even this attainment of the extent of nothingness is produced and devised.’ He understands: ‘But whatever is produced and devised is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ … Abiding in that, he attains the destruction of the influxes. If he does not attain the destruction of the influxes, with the destruction of the five lower fetters, he reappears spontaneously, because of that passion and delight in the Dhamma. He is extinguished there, and is not liable to return from that world. This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Auspicious One—who knows and sees, the Arahant, the Rightly Self-Awakened One—practicing which, a heedful, diligent and resolute bhikkhu’s mind is liberated, his influxes are destroyed, and he arrives at the supreme safety from the yoke.

When he said this, the householder Dasama said to Venerable Ānanda, “Venerable Ānanda, suppose a person was looking for an entrance to a hidden treasure. And suddenly they would encounter eleven entrances! In the same way, I was searching for the door to the Deathless. And suddenly I found eleven doors to the Deathless for cultivation. Suppose a person had a house with eleven doors. If the house caught fire, they would be able to flee to safety through any one of those doors. In the same way, I am able to flee to safety through any one of these eleven doors to the Deathless. Venerable sir, those of other teachings seek a fee for the teacher. Why should not I make an offering to Venerable Ānanda?”

Then the householder Dasama, having assembled the Saṅgha from Vesālī and Pāṭaliputta, served and satisfied them with his own hands with fine fresh and cooked foods. He clothed every bhikkhu in a pair of garments, with a set of three robes for Ānanda. And he had a dwelling worth five hundred built for Ānanda.
