# MN 50 - The Rebuke of Māra

Thus have I heard. At one time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.

At that time Moggallāna was walking in the open air.

Now at that time Māra the Wicked had gotten inside Moggallāna’s belly. Moggallāna thought, “Why now is my belly so very heavy, as if I have just eaten a load of beans?” Then he stepped down from the walking path, entered his dwelling, sat down on the seat spread out, and looked reflexively for the cause. 

He saw that Māra the Wicked had gotten inside his belly. So he said to Māra, “Come out, Wicked One, come out! Do not harass the Realized One or his disciple. Do not create lasting harm and suffering for yourself!”

Then Māra thought, “This ascetic does not really know me or see me when he tells me to come out. Not even the Teacher could recognize me so quickly, so how could a disciple?”

Then Moggallāna said to Māra, “I know you even when you are like this, Wicked One. Do not think, ‘He does not know me.’ You are Māra the Wicked. And you think, ‘This ascetic does not really know me or see me when he tells me to come out. Not even the Teacher could recognize me so quickly, so how could a disciple?’”

Then Māra thought, “This ascetic really does know me and see me when he tells me to come out.”

Then Māra came up out of Moggallāna’s mouth and stood against the door bar. Moggallāna saw him there and said, “I see you even there, Wicked One. Do not think, ‘He does not see me.’ That is you, Wicked One, standing against the door bar.

Once upon a time, Wicked One, I was a Māra named Dūsī, and I had a sister named Kāḷī. You were her son, which made you my nephew.

At that time Kakusandha the Auspicious One, the Arahant, the Rightly Self-Awakened One, arose in the world. Kakusandha had a fine pair of chief disciples named Vidhura and Sañjīva. Of all the disciples of the Buddha Kakusandha, none were the equal of Venerable Vidhura in teaching Dhamma. And that is how he came to be known as Vidhura.

But when Venerable Sañjīva had gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, he easily attained the cessation of perception-and-feeling. Once upon a time, Venerable Sañjīva was sitting at the root of a certain tree having attained the cessation of perception-and-feeling. Some cowherds, shepherds, farmers, and passers-by saw him sitting there and said, ‘Oh, how incredible, how amazing! This ascetic passed away while seated. We should cremate him.’ They collected grass, wood, and cow-dung, heaped it all on Venerable Sañjīva’s body, set it on fire, and left.

Then, when the night had passed, Venerable Sañjīva emerged from that attainment, shook out his robes, and, since it was morning, he robed up and entered the village for alms. Those cowherds, shepherds, farmers, and passers-by saw him wandering for alms and said, ‘Oh, how incredible, how amazing! This ascetic passed away while seated, and now he has come back to life!’ And that is how he came to be known as Sañjīva. 

Then it occurred to Māra Dūsī, ‘I do not know the course of rebirth of these virtuous bhikkhus of good character. Why don’t I take possession of these brahmins and householders and say, “Come, all of you, abuse, attack, harass, and trouble the virtuous bhikkhus of good character. Hopefully by doing this we can disconcert their minds so that Māra Dūsī can find a vulnerability.”’ And that is exactly what he did.

Then those brahmins and householders abused, attacked, harassed, and troubled the virtuous bhikkhus of good character: ‘These shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman, say, “We practice jhāna! We practice jhāna!” Slouching, downcast, and dopey, they meditate and contemplate and cogitate and ruminate.  Just as an owl on a branch meditates and contemplates and cogitates and ruminates as it hunts a mouse, so too, these shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman, say, “We practice jhāna! We practice jhāna!” Slouching and downcast, as if intoxicated, they meditate and contemplate and cogitate and ruminate. Just as a jackal on a river-bank meditates and contemplates and cogitates and ruminates as it hunts a fish, so too, these shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman, say, “We practice jhāna! We practice jhāna!” Slouching and downcast, as if intoxicated, they meditate and contemplate and cogitate and ruminate. Just as a cat by an alley or a drain or a dustbin meditates and contemplates and cogitates and ruminates as it hunts a mouse, so too, these shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman, say, “We practice jhāna! We practice jhāna!” Slouching and downcast, as if intoxicated, they meditate and contemplate and cogitate and ruminate. Just as an unladen donkey by an alley or a drain or a dustbin meditates and contemplates and cogitates and ruminates, so too, these shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman, say, “We practice jhāna! We practice jhāna!” Slouching and downcast, as if intoxicated, they meditate and contemplate and cogitate and ruminate.

Most of the people who died at that time—when their body broke up, after death—were reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.

Then Kakusandha the Auspicious One, the Arahant, the Rightly Self-Awakened One, addressed the bhikkhus: ‘Bhikkhus, the brahmins and householders have been possessed by Māra Dūsī. He told them to abuse you in the hope of disconcerting your minds so that he can find a vulnerability. Come, all of you bhikkhus, abide having pervaded with a mind of friendliness the first direction, likewise second, likewise third, likewise the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, abide having pervaded the whole world with a mind of friendliness—abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free of enmity and ill will.  Abide having pervaded with a mind of compassion … Abide having pervaded with a mind of contentment … Abide having pervaded with a mind of equanimity the first direction, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, abide having pervaded the whole world with a mind of equanimity—abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free of enmity and ill will.

When those bhikkhus were instructed and advised by the Buddha Kakusandha in this way, they went to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, where they abided having pervaded the whole world with a mind of friendliness … compassion … contentment … equanimity.

Then it occurred to Māra Dūsī, ‘Even when I do this I do not know the course of these virtuous bhikkhus of good character. Why don’t I take possession of these brahmins and householders and say, “Come, all of you, honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the virtuous bhikkhus of good character. Hopefully by doing this we can disconcert their minds so that Māra Dūsī can find a vulnerability.”’

And that is exactly what he did. Then those brahmins and householders honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated the virtuous bhikkhus of good character.

Most of the people who died at that time—when their body broke up, after death—were reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.

Then Kakusandha the Auspicious One, the Arahant, the Rightly Self-Awakened One, addressed the bhikkhus: ‘Bhikkhus, the brahmins and householders have been possessed by Māra Dūsī. He told them to venerate you in the hope of disconcerting your minds so that he can find a vulnerability. Come, all you bhikkhus, abide maintaining perspective of the non-beauty of the body, perceiving the disagreeability of nutriment, perceiving dissatisfaction with the whole world, and maintaining perspective of the impermanence of all determinations.’ 

When those bhikkhus were instructed and advised by the Buddha Kakusandha in this way, they went to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, where they abided maintaining perspective of the non-beauty of the body, perceiving the disagreeability of nutriment, perceiving dissatisfaction with the whole world, and maintaining perspective of the impermanence of all determinations.

Then the Buddha Kakusandha robed up in the morning and, taking this bowl and robe, entered the village for alms with Venerable Vidhura as his second monk.

Then Māra Dūsī took possession of a certain boy, picked up a rock, and struck Vidhura on the head, cracking it open. Then Vidhura, with blood pouring from his cracked skull, still followed behind the Buddha Kakusandha. Then the Buddha Kakusandha turned to gaze back, the way that elephants do, saying, ‘This Māra Dūsī knows no bounds.’ And as he was gazing, Māra Dūsī fell from that place and was reborn in the Great Hell.

Now that Great Hell is known by three names: ‘The Six Fields of Contact’ and also ‘The Impaling With Spikes’ and also ‘Felt Individually’. Then the wardens of hell came to me and said, ‘When spike meets spike in your heart, you will know that you have been roasting in hell for a thousand years.’

I roasted for many years, many centuries, many millennia in that Great Hell. For ten thousand years I roasted in the annex of that Great Hell, experiencing the feeling called ‘this is emergence’. My body was in human form, but I had the head of a fish.

> What kind of hell was that, where Dūsī was roasted after attacking the disciple Vidhura along with the brahmin Kakusandha?
> 
> There were 100 iron spikes, each one felt individually. That is the kind of hell where Dūsī roasted after attacking the disciple Vidhura along with the brahmin Kakusandha.
> 
> Dark One, if you attack a bhikkhu who knows this, a disciple of the Buddha, you will fall into suffering.
> 
> There are mansions that last an eon standing in the middle of a lake. Sapphire-colored, brilliant, they sparkle and shine. Dancing there are nymphs shining in all different colors.
> 
> Dark One, if you attack a bhikkhu who knows this, a disciple of the Buddha, you will fall into suffering.
> 
> I am the one who, urged by the Buddha, shook the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother with his big toe as the Saṅgha of bhikkhus watched.
> 
> Dark One, if you attack a bhikkhu who knows this, a disciple of the Buddha, you will fall into suffering.
> 
> I am the one who shook the Palace of Victory with his big toe owing to psychic power, inspiring deities to awe.
> 
> Dark One, if you attack a bhikkhu who knows this, a disciple of the Buddha, you will fall into suffering.
> 
> I am the one who asked Sakka in the Palace of Victory: ‘Vāsava, I hope you recall the liberation through the destruction of craving?’ And I am the one to whom Sakka admitted the truth when asked.
> 
> Dark One, if you attack a bhikkhu who knows this, a disciple of the Buddha, you will fall into suffering.
> 
> I am the one who asked Brahmā in the Hall of Justice before the assembly: ‘Venerable, do you still have the same view that you had in the past? Or do you see the radiance transcending the Brahmā realm?’
> 
> And I am the one to whom Brahmā truthfully admitted his progress: ‘Good sir, I do not have that view that I had in the past.
> 
> I see the radiance transcending the Brahmā realm. So how could I say today that I am permanent and eternal?’
> 
> Dark One, if you attack a bhikkhu who knows this, a disciple of the Buddha, you will fall into suffering.
> 
> I am the one who, by liberation, touched the peak of mount Meru. I have visited the forests of the people who dwell in the Eastern Continent.
> 
> Dark One, if you attack a bhikkhu who knows this, a disciple of the Buddha, you will fall into suffering.
> 
> Though a fire does not think, ‘I will burn the fool!’ Still the fool who attacks the fire gets burnt.
> 
> In the same way, Māra, in attacking the Realized One, you will only burn yourself, like a fool touching the flames.
> 
> Māra has done a bad thing in attacking the Realized One. Wicked One, do you imagine that your wickedness will not bear fruit?
> 
> Your actions heap up wickedness that will last a long time, terminator! Give up on the Buddha, Māra! And hold no hope for the bhikkhus!”
> 
> That is how, in the Bhesekaḷā grove, the bhikkhu rebuked Māra. That spirit, downcast, disappeared right there!
