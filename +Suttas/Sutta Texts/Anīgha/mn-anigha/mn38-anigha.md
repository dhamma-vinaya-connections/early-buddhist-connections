# MN 38 - The Longer Discourse on the Destruction of Craving

Thus have I heard. At one time the Auspicious One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.

Now at that time a bhikkhu called Sāti, the fisherman’s son, had the following pernicious view: “As I understand the Auspicious One’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”

Several bhikkhus heard about this. They approached Sāti and said to him, “Is it really true, Venerable Sāti, that you have such a pernicious view: ‘As I understand the Auspicious One’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another’?”

“Absolutely, venerables. As I understand the Auspicious One’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”

Then, wishing to dissuade Sāti from his view, the bhikkhus pursued, pressed, and grilled him, “Do not say that, Sāti! Do not misrepresent the Auspicious One, for misrepresentation of the Auspicious One is not good. And the Auspicious One would not say that. In many ways the Auspicious One has said that consciousness is dependently arisen, since without a support, consciousness cannot exist.”

But even though the bhikkhus pressed him in this way, Sāti obstinately stuck to his pernicious view and insisted on it.

When they were not able to dissuade Sāti from his view, the bhikkhus went to the Auspicious One, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.

So the Auspicious One addressed one of the bhikkhus, “Please, bhikkhu, in my name tell the bhikkhu Sāti that the teacher summons him.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” that bhikkhu replied. He went to Sāti and said to him, “Venerable Sāti, the teacher summons you.”

“Yes, venerable,” Venerable Sāti replied. He went to the Auspicious One, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Auspicious One said to him, “Is it really true, Sāti, that you have such a pernicious view: ‘As I understand the Auspicious One’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another’?”

“Absolutely, venerable sir. As I understand the Auspicious One’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”

“Sāti, what is that consciousness?”

“Venerable sir, he is the speaker, the knower who experiences the results of good and bad actions in all the different realms.”

“Inept man, who in the world have you ever known me to teach in that way? Have not I said in many ways that consciousness is dependently arisen, since without a support, consciousness cannot exist? But still you misrepresent me by your wrong grasp, harm yourself, and create much wickedness.  This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.”

Then the Auspicious One said to the bhikkhus, “What do you think, bhikkhus? Is this bhikkhu Sāti even warmed up in this teaching-and-discipline?”

“How could that be, venerable sir? No, venerable sir.” When this was said, Sāti sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.

Knowing this, the Auspicious One said, “Inept man, you will be known by your own pernicious view. I will question the bhikkhus about this.”

Then the Auspicious One said to the bhikkhus, “Bhikkhus, do you understand my teaching as Sāti does, when he misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and creates much wickedness?”

“No, venerable sir. For in many ways the Auspicious One has told us that consciousness is dependently arisen, since without a support, consciousness cannot exist.”

“Good, good, bhikkhus! It is good that you understand my teaching like this. For in many ways I have told you that consciousness is dependently arisen, since without a support, consciousness cannot exist. But still this Sāti misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and creates much wickedness. This will be for his lasting harm and suffering.

Consciousness is reckoned according to the very same support dependent upon which it arises. Consciousness that arises dependent on the eye and sights is reckoned as eye-consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the ear and sounds is reckoned as ear-consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the nose and smells is reckoned as nose-consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the tongue and tastes is reckoned as tongue consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the body and touches is reckoned as body-consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the mental faculty and phenomena is reckoned as mental faculty-consciousness.

It is like fire, which is reckoned according to the very same support dependent upon which it burns. A fire that burns dependent on logs is reckoned as a log fire. A fire that burns dependent on twigs is reckoned as a twig fire. A fire that burns dependent on grass is reckoned as a grass fire. A fire that burns dependent on cow-dung is reckoned as a cow-dung fire. A fire that burns dependent on husks is reckoned as a husk fire. A fire that burns dependent on rubbish is reckoned as a rubbish fire.

In the same way, consciousness is reckoned according to the very same support dependent upon which it arises. … 

Bhikkhus, do you see ‘this is’?” 

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Do you see that it exists with that as nutriment?” 

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Do you see that when that nutriment ceases, that which exists is of the nature to cease?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Does doubt arise when you are uncertain whether or not ‘this is’?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Does doubt arise when you are uncertain whether or not it exists with that as nutriment?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Does doubt arise when you are uncertain whether or not when that nutriment ceases, that which is exists is of the nature to cease?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Is doubt given up in someone who sees as it is with right understanding that ‘this is’?” 

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Is doubt given up in someone who sees as it is with right understanding that it exists with that as nutriment?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Is doubt given up in someone who sees as it is with right understanding that when that nutriment ceases, that which exists is of the nature to cease?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Are you free of doubt as to whether ‘this is’?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Are you free of doubt as to whether it exists with that as nutriment?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Are you free of doubt as to whether when that nutriment ceases, that which exists is of the nature to cease?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Have you seen clearly as it is with right understanding that ‘this is’?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Have you seen clearly as it is with right understanding that it exists with that as nutriment?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Have you seen clearly as it is with right understanding that when that nutriment ceases, that which exists is of the nature to cease?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Pure and bright as this view is, bhikkhus, if you cherish it, fancy it, treasure it, and treat it as ‘mine’, would you be understanding my simile of the teaching as a raft: for crossing over, not for holding on?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Pure and bright as this view is, bhikkhus, if you do not cherish it, fancy it, treasure it, and treat it ‘mine’, would you be understanding my simile of the teaching as a raft: for crossing over, not for holding on?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Bhikkhus, there are these four nutriments. They maintain beings that already exist and provide a hold to those seeking existence. What four? Edible food, whether coarse or fine; pressure is the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth. 

Now, bhikkhus, what is the foundation, origin, birthplace, and source of these four nutriments? Craving.

And what is the foundation, origin, birthplace, and source of craving? Feeling.

And what is the foundation … of feeling? Pressure. 

And what is the foundation … of pressure? The six sense fields.

And what is the foundation … of the six sense fields? Name-and-form.

And what is the foundation … of name-and-form? Consciousness.

And what is the foundation … of consciousness? Activities.

And what is the foundation, origin, birthplace, and source of activations? Ignorance.

So, bhikkhus, with ignorance as basis, activations. With activations as basis, consciousness. With consciousness as basis, name-and-form. With name-and-form as basis, the six sense fields. With the six sense fields as basis, pressure. With pressure as basis, feeling. With feeling as basis, craving. With craving as basis, assumption. With assumption as basis, being. With being as basis, birth. With birth as basis, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, displeasure, sadness, and distress exist.  That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.

‘With birth as basis, aging and death.’ That is what I said. Is that how you see this or not?”

“That is how we see it.”

‘With being as basis, birth.’ …

‘With ignorance as basis, activations.’ That is what I said. Is that how you see this or not?”

“That is how we see it.”

“Good, bhikkhus! So both you and I say this. With this, this is; when this arises, that arises. That is: With ignorance as basis, activations. With activations as basis, consciousness. With consciousness as basis, name-and-form. With name-and-form as basis, the six sense fields. With the six sense fields as basis, pressure. With pressure as basis, feeling. With feeling as basis, craving. With craving as basis, assumption. With assumption as basis, being. With being as basis, birth. With birth as basis, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, displeasure, sadness, and distress exist. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.

With the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance, cessation of activations. With the cessation of activations, cessation of consciousness. With the cessation of consciousness, cessation of name-and-form. With the cessation of name-and-form, cessation of the six sense fields. With the cessation of the six sense fields, cessation of pressure. With the cessation of pressure, cessation of feeling. With the cessation of feeling, cessation of craving. With the cessation of craving, cessation of assumption. With the cessation of assumption, cessation of being. With the cessation of being, cessation of birth. With the cessation of birth, cessation of aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, displeasure, sadness, and distress. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.

‘With the cessation of birth, cessation of aging and death.’ That is what I said. Is that how you see this or not?”

“That is how we see it.”

‘With the cessation of being, cessation of birth.’ …

‘With the cessation of ignorance, cessation of activations.’ That is what I said. Is that how you see this or not?”

“That is how we see it.”

“Good, bhikkhus! So both you and I say this. Without this, this is not; when this ceases, this ceases. That is: With the cessation of ignorance, cessation of activations. With the cessation of activations, cessation of consciousness. With the cessation of consciousness, cessation of name-and-form. With the cessation of name-and-form, cessation of the six sense fields. With the cessation of the six sense fields, cessation of pressure. With the cessation of pressure, cessation of feeling. With the cessation of feeling, cessation of craving. With the cessation of craving, cessation of assumption. With the cessation of assumption, cessation of being. With the cessation of being, cessation of birth. With the cessation of birth, cessation of aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, displeasure, sadness, and distress. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.

Knowing and seeing in this way, bhikkhus, would you turn back to the past, thinking, ‘Did we exist in the past? Did we not exist in the past? What were we in the past? How were we in the past? After being what, what did we become in the past?’?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Knowing and seeing in this way, bhikkhus, would you turn forward to the future, thinking, ‘Will we exist in the future? Will we not exist in the future? What will we be in the future? How will we be in the future? After being what, what will we become in the future?’?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Knowing and seeing in this way, bhikkhus, would you be undecided about the present, thinking, ‘Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? This sentient being—where did it come from? And where will it go?’?”

“No, venerable sir.” 

“Knowing and seeing in this way, would you say, ‘We respect our teacher, and we speak like this out of respect for our teacher’?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Knowing and seeing in this way, would you say, ‘This ascetic says this. We speak like this because it is what he says’?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Knowing and seeing in this way, would you dedicate yourself to another teacher?” 

“No, venerable sir.”

“Knowing and seeing in this way, would you regard the observances and boisterous, superstitious rites of the various ascetics and brahmins as valuable?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Are you not speaking only of what you have known and seen and realized for yourselves?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Good, bhikkhus! You have been guided by me with this Dhamma that is evident, not involving time, verifiable, and goading-on, to be known by the wise for themselves. For when I said that this Dhamma is presently evident, not involving time, verifiable, and goading-on, to be known by the wise for themselves, this is what I was referring to. 

Bhikkhus, when three things come together an embryo is conceived. In a case where the mother and father come together, but the mother is not in the fertile phase of her menstrual cycle, and the incoming being is not ready, the embryo is not conceived.  In a case where the mother and father come together, the mother is in the fertile phase of her menstrual cycle, but the incoming being is not ready, the embryo is not conceived. But when these three things come together—the mother and father come together, the mother is in the fertile phase of her menstrual cycle, and the incoming being is ready—an embryo is conceived.

The mother nurtures the embryo in her womb for nine or ten months with great anxiety, as a heavy burden. When nine or ten months have passed, the mother gives birth with great anxiety, as a heavy burden. When the infant is born she nourishes it with her own blood. For mother’s milk is regarded as blood in the training of the Noble One. 

That boy grows up and his faculties mature. He plays childish games such as toy plows, tipcat, somersaults, pinwheels, toy measures, toy carts, and toy bows.

That boy grows up and his faculties mature further. He amuses himself, supplied and provided with the five avenues of sensuality. Sights cognizable by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensuality, and enticing.

Sounds cognizable by the ear …

Smells cognizable by the nose …

Tastes cognizable by the tongue …

Touches cognizable by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensuality, and enticing.

When he sees a sight with the eye, if it is agreeable he harbors passion for it, if it is disagreeable he is averse to it. He lives with recollectedness of the body unestablished and with a limited mind. And he does not understand as it is the liberation by mind and liberation by understanding where those bad, unbeneficial qualities cease without remainder.

Engaged in this way in favoring and opposing, when he experiences any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—he delights in it, welcomes it, and rests upon it. This gives rise to delight. That delight in feelings is assumption. With this assumption of his as basis, being. With being as basis, birth. With birth as basis, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, displeasure, sadness, and distress exist. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.

When he hears a sound with the ear …

When he smells an odor with the nose …

When he tastes a flavor with the tongue …

When he touches a touch with the body …

When he cognizes a phenomenon with the mental faculty, if it is agreeable he harbors passion for it, if it is disagreeable he is averse to it. He lives with recollectedness of the body unestablished and with a limited mind. And he does not understand as it is the liberation by mind and liberation by understanding where those bad, unbeneficial qualities cease without remainder.

Engaged in this way in favoring and opposing, when he experiences any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—he delights in it, welcomes it, and rests upon it. This gives rise to delight. That delight in feelings is assumption. With this assumption of his as basis, being. With being as basis, birth. With birth as basis, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, displeasure, sadness, and distress exist. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.

But when a Realized One arises in the world—an Arahant, a Rightly Self-Awakened One, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed— he makes known this world to others—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—having for himself comprehended and experienced it. He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a renunciate life that is entirely complete and pure.

A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s son, or someone born in some good family. He gains faith in the Realized One and reflects, ‘Household life is confined and dusty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. It is not easy for someone living at home to lead the renunciate life utterly complete and pure, like a polished shell. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from lay life to homelessness?’ After some time, he gives up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. He shaves off hair and beard, dresses in ocher robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness.

Once he is gone forth, he takes up the training and livelihood of the bhikkhus. He gives up and abstains from killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. He is scrupulous and kind, living compassionate for the welfare of all creatures and beings.

He gives up and abstains from taking what is not given. He takes only what is given, and expects only what is given. He keeps himself clean by not thieving.

He gives up and abstains from incelibacy. He is celibate, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex.

He gives up and abstains from lying. He speaks the truth and sticks to the truth. He is honest and trustworthy, and does not trick the world with his words.

He gives up and abstains from divisive speech. He does not repeat in one place what he heard in another to divide people against each other. Instead, he reconciles those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, enjoying harmony, and speaking words that promote harmony.

He gives up and abstains from harsh speech. He speaks in a way that is gentle, pleasing to the ear, affectionate, going to the heart, polite, likable, and agreeable to the people.

He gives up and abstains from frivolous speech. His words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching-and-discipline. He says things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.

He abstains from violence towards plants and seeds. He eats in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and at the wrong time. He abstains from dancing, singing, music, and watching shows. He abstains from beautifying and adorning himself with garlands, perfumes, and makeup. He abstains from high and luxurious beds. He abstains from receiving gold and money, raw grains, raw meat, women and girls, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants, cows, horses, and mares, and fields and land. He abstains from running errands and messages; buying and selling; falsifying weights, metals, or measures; bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity; mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence.

He is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever he goes, he sets out taking only these things. He is like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. In the same way, the bhikkhu is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever he goes, he sets out taking only these things. Possessed of this noble aggregate of virtue, he experiences a blameless ease internally.

When he sees a sight with the eye, he does not grasp at signs and features of it on account of which—due to abiding with the eye faculty unrestrained—bad, unbeneficial thoughts of longing and upset would flow in on him. He practices to restrain that; he guards the eye faculty and brings about the restraint of the eye faculty.

When he hears a sound with the ear …

When he smells an odor with the nose …

When he tastes a flavor with the tongue …

When he touches a touch with the body …

When he cognizes a phenomenon with the mental faculty, he does not grasp at signs and features of it on account of which—due to abiding with the mental faculty unrestrained—bad, unbeneficial thoughts of longing and upset would flow in on him. He practices to restrain that; he guards the mental faculty and brings about the restraint of the mental faculty. Possessed of this noble sense restraint, he experiences an unsullied ease internally. 

He acts with awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent. 

Possessed of this noble aggregate of virtue, this noble contentment, this noble sense restraint, and this noble recollectedness-and-awareness, he frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.

After the meal, he returns from almsround, sits down cross-legged, sets his body straight, and establishes recollectedness at the fore. With the giving up of longing with regard to the world, he abides with a mind rid of longing; he cleanses the mind of longing. With the giving up of ill will and hatred, he abides with a mind rid of ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all creatures and beings; he cleanses the mind of ill will and hatred. With the giving up of indolence-and-lethargy, he abides with a mind rid of indolence-and-lethargy, perceiving light, recollected, and aware; he cleanses the mind of indolence-and-lethargy. With the giving up of restlessness and anxiety, he abides without restlessness, his mind internally appeased; he cleanses the mind of restlessness and anxiety. With the giving up of doubt, he abides having gone beyond doubt, not uncertain about beneficial qualities; he cleanses the mind of doubt.

He gives up these five hindrances, defilements of the mind that weaken understanding. Then, having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality, having withdrawn from unbeneficial phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of withdrawal, he abides having entered upon the first jhāna. Furthermore, with the appeasement of thinking and pondering, with internal confidence and collectedness of mind, without thinking or pondering and with joy and ease born of composure, the bhikkhu abides having entered upon the second jhāna. third jhāna … fourth jhāna.

When he sees a sight with the eye, if it is agreeable he does not harbor passion for it, if it is disagreeable he is not averse to it. He lives with recollectedness of the body established and with an immeasurable mind.  And he understands as it is the liberation by mind and liberation by understanding where those bad, unbeneficial qualities cease without remainder.

Having thus given up favoring and opposing, when he experiences any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—he does not delight in it, welcome it, or rest upon it. As a result, delight in feelings ceases. With the cessation of his delight, cessation of assumption. With the cessation of assumption, cessation of being. With the cessation of being, cessation of birth. When cessation of birth, cessation of aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, displeasure, sadness, and distress. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.

With the cessation of being, cessation of birth. When cessation of birth, cessation of aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, displeasure, sadness, and distress. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.

Bhikkhus, you should memorize this brief statement on liberation through the destruction of craving. But the bhikkhu Sāti, the fisherman’s son, is caught in a vast net of craving, a tangle of craving.”

That is what the Auspicious One said. Pleased, the bhikkhus delighted in what the Auspicious One said.
