# MN 34 - The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd

Thus have I heard. At one time the Auspicious One was staying in the land of the Vajjis near Ukkacelā on the bank of the Ganges river. There the Auspicious One addressed the bhikkhus, “Bhikkhus!”

“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Auspicious One said this:

“Once upon a time, bhikkhus, there was an unwise Magadhan cowherd. In the last month of the rainy season, without inspecting the near shore or the far shore, he drove his cattle across a place with no ford on the Ganges river to the the northern shore among the Suvidehans.

But the cattle bunched up in mid-stream and came to ruin right there. Why is that? Because that unwise cowherd failed to inspect the shores before driving the cattle across at a place with no ford. In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who are unskilled in this world and the other world, unskilled in Māra’s domain and its opposite, and unskilled in Death’s domain and its opposite. If anyone thinks they are worth listening to and trusting, it will be for their lasting harm and suffering.

Once upon a time, bhikkhus, there was a wise Magadhan cowherd. In the last month of the rainy season, after inspecting the near shore and the far shore, he drove his cattle across a ford on the Ganges river to the northern shore among the Suvidehans.

First he drove across the bulls, the fathers and leaders of the herd. They breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shore. Then he drove across the strong and tractable cattle. They too breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shore. Then he drove across the bullocks and heifers. They too breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shore. Then he drove across the calves and weak cattle. They too breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shore. Once it happened that a baby calf had just been born. Urged on by its mother’s lowing, even it managed to breast the stream of the Ganges and safely reach the far shore. Why is that? Because the wise cowherd inspected both shores before driving the cattle across at a ford.

In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who are skilled in this world and the other world, skilled in Māra’s domain and its opposite, and skilled in Death’s domain and its opposite. If anyone thinks they are worth listening to and trusting, it will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.

Just like the bulls, fathers and leaders of the herd, who crossed the Ganges to safety are the bhikkhus who are Arahants, who have destroyed the influxes, fulfilled \[the training\], done what had to be done, laid down the burden, arrived at the highest goal, utterly destroyed the fetter of being, and are liberated by right understanding. Having breasted Māra’s stream, they have safely crossed over to the far shore.

Just like the strong and tractable cattle who crossed the Ganges to safety are the bhikkhus who, with the complete destruction of the five lower fetters, reappear spontaneously. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. They too, having breasted Māra’s stream, will safely cross over to the far shore.

Just like the bullocks and heifers who crossed the Ganges to safety are the bhikkhus who, with the complete destruction of three fetters, and the weakening of passion, aversion, and muddledness, are once-returners. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. They too, having breasted Māra’s stream, will safely cross over to the far shore.

Just like the calves and weak cattle who crossed the Ganges to safety are the bhikkhus who, with the complete destruction of three fetters are stream-enterers, not liable to reappear in the underworld, bound for awakening. They too, having breasted Māra’s stream, will safely cross over to the far shore.

Just like the baby calf who had just been born, but, urged on by its mother’s lowing, still managed to cross the Ganges to safety are the bhikkhus who are Dhamma-followers and faith-followers. They too, having breasted Māra’s stream, will safely cross over to the far shore. 

Bhikkhus, I am skilled in this world and the other world, skilled in Māra’s domain and its opposite, and skilled in Death’s domain and its opposite. If anyone thinks I am worth listening to and trusting, it will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.”

That is what the Auspicious One said. Then the Excellent One, the Teacher, went on to say:

> “This world and the other world have been clearly explained by the one who knows; as well as Māra’s reach, and what is out of Death’s reach.
> 
> Having comprehended the whole world, the Buddha who understands has opened the door to the Deathless, for finding the safety, Nibbāna.
> 
> The Wicked One’s stream has been cut, it is blown away and mown down. Be very glad, bhikkhus, and set your heart where safety lies.”
