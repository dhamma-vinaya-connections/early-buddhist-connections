# MN 17 - Jungle Thickets

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Auspicious One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Auspicious One addressed the bhikkhus, “Bhikkhus!”

“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Auspicious One said this:

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you an exposition about jungle thickets. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” they replied. The Auspicious One said this:

“Bhikkhus, take the case of a bhikkhu who lives in a certain jungle thicket. As he does so, his recollectedness does not become established, his mind does not become composed, his undestroyed influxes do not become destroyed, and he does not reach the unreached supreme safety from the yoke. And the necessities of life that a renunciate requires—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—are difficult to obtain. That bhikkhu should reflect: ‘While living close by this jungle thicket, my recollectedness does not become established, my mind does not become composed, my undestroyed influxes do not become destroyed, and I do not reach the unreached supreme safety from the yoke.  And the necessities of life that a renunciate requires—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—are difficult to obtain.’ That bhikkhu should leave that jungle thicket that very time of night or day; he should not stay there.

Take another case of a bhikkhu who lives in a certain jungle thicket. His recollectedness does not become established … But the necessities of life are readily available. That bhikkhu should reflect: ‘While living close by this jungle thicket, my recollectedness does not become established … But the necessities of life are readily available. But I did not go forth from the lay life to homelessness for the sake of a robe, almsfood, lodgings, or medicines and supplies for the sick. Moreover, while living close by this jungle thicket, my recollectedness does not become established …’ That bhikkhu should, after appraisal, leave that jungle thicket; he should not stay there.

In another case of a bhikkhu who lives in a certain jungle thicket. As he does so, his recollectedness becomes established, his mind becomes composed, his undestroyed influxes become destroyed, and he reaches the unreached supreme safety from the yoke. But the necessities of life that a renunciate requires—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—are difficult to obtain. That bhikkhu should reflect: ‘While living near this jungle thicket, my recollectedness becomes established … But the necessities of life are difficult to obtain. But I did not go forth from the lay life to homelessness for the sake of a robe, almsfood, lodgings, or medicines and supplies for the sick. Moreover, while living near this jungle thicket, my recollectedness does not become established …’ That bhikkhu should, after appraisal, stay in that jungle thicket; he should not leave.

Take another case of a bhikkhu who lives in a certain jungle thicket. His recollectedness becomes established … And the necessities of life are readily available. That bhikkhu should reflect: ‘While living close by this jungle thicket, my recollectedness becomes established … And the necessities of life are readily available.’ That bhikkhu should stay in that jungle thicket even for the rest of his life; he should not leave.

Take the case of a bhikkhu who lives in dependence on a village … town … city … country … an individual. As he does so, his recollectedness does not become established, his mind does not become composed, his undestroyed influxes do not become destroyed, and he does not reach the unreached supreme safety from the yoke. And the necessities of life that a renunciate requires—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—are difficult to obtain. That bhikkhu should reflect: ‘… my recollectedness does not become established … And the necessities of life are difficult to obtain.’ That bhikkhu should leave that individual at any time of the day or night, without taking leave; he should not follow him. …

Take another case of a bhikkhu who lives supported by an individual. His recollectedness does not become established … But the necessities of life are readily available. That bhikkhu should reflect: ‘… my recollectedness does not become established … But the necessities of life are readily available.’ … That bhikkhu should, after appraisal, leave that individual having taken leave; he should not follow him. …

Take another case of a bhikkhu who lives supported by an individual. His recollectedness becomes established … But the necessities of life are hard to come by. That bhikkhu should reflect: ‘… my recollectedness becomes established … But the necessities of life are hard to come by.’ … That bhikkhu should, after appraisal, follow that individual; he should not leave.

Take another case of a bhikkhu who lives supported by an individual. As he does so, his recollectedness becomes established, his mind becomes composed, his undestroyed influxes become destroyed, and he reaches the unreached supreme safety from the yoke. And the necessities of life that a renunciate requires—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—are readily available. That bhikkhu should reflect: ‘While living supported by this individual, my recollectedness becomes established … And the necessities of life are readily available.’ That bhikkhu should follow that individual even for the rest of his life; he should not leave him, even if dismissed.”

That is what the Auspicious One said. Pleased, the bhikkhus delighted in what the Auspicious One said.
