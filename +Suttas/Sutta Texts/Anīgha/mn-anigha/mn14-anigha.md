# MN 14 - The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering

Thus have I heard.  At one time, the Auspicious One was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.

Then Mahānāma the Sakyan approached the Auspicious One, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “For a long time, venerable sir, I have understood the Auspicious One’s teaching like this: ‘Greed, aversion, and muddledness are defilements of the mind.’ Despite understanding this, sometimes states of greed, aversion, and muddledness endure with a hold on my mind. I wonder what I have not abandoned internally, because of which sometimes states of greed, aversion, and muddledness endure with a hold on my mind?”

“Mahānāma, this very thing is what you have not abandoned internally, because of which sometimes states of passion, aversion, and muddledness endure with a hold on your mind. For if you had given this up, you would not still be living at home and enjoying sensuality.  But because you have not given this up, you are still living at home and enjoying sensuality.

Sensuality gives little gratification and much suffering and distress, and the peril there is what is greater. Mahānāma, even though a noble disciple has seen this as it is with right understanding, as long as he does not achieve the joy and ease that are apart from sensuality and unbeneficial phenomena, or something even more peaceful than that, he still might return to sensuality.  But when he does achieve that joy and ease, or something more peaceful than that, then he does not return to sensuality. 

Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too clearly saw with right understanding that: ‘Sensuality gives little gratification and much suffering and distress, and the peril there is what is greater.’ But so long as I did not achieve the joy and ease that are apart from sensuality and unbeneficial phenomena, or something even more peaceful than that, I did not claim that I would not return to sensuality. But when I did achieve that joy and ease, or something more peaceful than that, then I claimed that I would not return to sensuality.

And what is the gratification of sensuality? There are these five avenues of sensuality. What five? What five? Sights cognizable by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensuality, and enticing.  Sounds cognizable by the ear … Smells cognizable by the nose … Tastes cognizable by the tongue … Touches cognizable by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensuality, and enticing. These are the five avenues of sensuality. The pleasure and joy that arise based on these five avenues of sensuality: this is the gratification of sensuality.

And what is the peril of sensuality? It is when a son of a good family earns a living by means such as arithmetic, accounting, calculating, farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions. But he must face cold and heat, being hurt by the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles, and risking death from hunger and thirst. This too is a peril of sensuality that is presently evident, a mass of suffering with sensuality as it is reason, source, and basis, purely caused by sensuality.

If when that son of a good family strives, labors, and makes an effort, wealth does not accrue to him, he sorrows, wails, and laments, beating his breast and falling into a muddle, \[thinking\]: ‘Oh, my hard work is wasted. My efforts are fruitless!’ This too is a peril of sensuality that is presently evident, a mass of suffering with sensuality as it is reason, source, and basis, purely caused by sensuality.

If, when that son of a good family strives, labors, and makes an effort, wealth does accrue to him, he experiences unease and distress due to needing to protect it, \[thinking\]: ‘How can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?’ And even though he protect its and wards it, rulers or bandits take it, or fire consumes it, or flood sweeps it away, or unloved heirs take it. He sorrows, wails, and laments, beating his breast and falling into a muddle, \[thinking\]: ‘What once was mine is gone.’ This too is a peril of sensuality that is presently evident, a mass of suffering with sensuality as it is reason, source, and basis, purely caused by sensuality.

Furthermore, on account of sensuality, kings fight with kings, aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders. A mother fights with her child, child with mother, father with child, and child with father. Brother fights with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, and friend fights with friend. Once they have started quarreling, arguing, and disputing, they attack each other with fists, stones, rods, and swords, and there they undergo death and deadly suffering. This too is a peril of sensuality that is presently evident, a mass of suffering with sensuality as it is reason, source, and basis, purely caused by sensuality.

Furthermore, on account of sensuality, \[people\] don their sword and shield, fasten their bow and arrows, and plunge into a battle massed on both sides, with arrows and spears flying and swords flashing. There, \[others\] strike them with arrows and spears and chop their head off, and there they undergo death and deadly suffering. This too is a peril of sensuality that is presently evident, a mass of suffering with sensuality as it is reason, source, and basis, purely caused by sensuality.

Furthermore, on account of sensuality, \[people\] don their sword and shield, fasten their bow and arrows, and charge wetly plastered bastions, with arrows and spears flying and swords flashing. There, \[others\] strike them with arrows and spears, splash them with dung, crush them with superior force, and sever their heads, and there they undergo death and deadly suffering. This too is a peril of sensuality that is presently evident, a mass of suffering with sensuality as it is reason, source, and basis, purely caused by sensuality.

Furthermore, on account of sensuality, \[people\] break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, and commit adultery. The rulers would arrest them and subject them to various punishments— whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘Rāhu’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘bulrush twist’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded. And there they undergo death and deadly suffering. This too is a peril of sensuality that is presently evident, a mass of suffering with sensuality as it is reason, source, and basis, purely caused by sensuality.

Furthermore, on account of sensuality, \[people\] engage in misconduct by way of body, speech, and thought. On the dissolution of the body, after death, they reappear in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. This too is a peril of sensuality relating to the future, a mass of suffering with sensuality as it is reason, source, and basis, purely caused by sensuality. 

Mahānāma, on one occasion I was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. Now at that time several Jains on the slopes of Isigili at the Black Rock were constantly standing, refusing seats. And they experienced painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion.

Then, in the late afternoon, I came out of retreat and went to the Black Rock to visit those Jains. I said to them, ‘Venerables, why are you constantly standing, refusing seats, so that you suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion?’

When I said this, those Jains said to me, ‘Venerable, the Jain Nāṭaputta, omniscient and all-seeing, claims to have complete knowledge-and-vision, thus: “knowledge-and-vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.”

He says, “O Jains, you have done bad actions in a past life. Wear them away with these severe and grueling austerities. And when in the present you are restrained in body, speech, and thought, you are not doing any bad actions for the future. So, due to eliminating past actions by fervent mortification, and not doing any new actions, there is nothing to arise in the future. With no future consequence, actions end. With the ending of actions, suffering ends. With the ending of suffering, feeling ends. And with the ending of feeling, all suffering will be worn away.” We endorse and accept this, and we are pleased by it.’

When they said this, I said to them, ‘But venerables, do you know with certainty that you existed in the past, and it is not the case that you did not exist?’

‘No we do not, venerable.’

‘But venerables, do you know with certainty that you did bad actions in the past?’

‘No we do not, venerable.’

‘But venerables, do you know that you did such and such bad actions?’

‘No we do not, venerable.’

‘But venerables, do you know that so much suffering has already been exhausted? Or that so much suffering still remains to be exhausted? Or that when so much suffering is exhausted, all suffering will be exhausted?’

‘No we do not, venerable.’

‘But venerables, do you know about giving up unbeneficial qualities and undertaking beneficial qualities right in the present experience?’

‘No we do not, venerable.’

‘So it seems that you do not know any of these things. That being so, then when those in the world who are violent and bloody-handed and of cruel livelihood reappear among humans they go forth as Jains?’

‘Venerable Gotama, pleasure is not gained through pleasure; pleasure is gained through displeasure. For if pleasure were to be gained through pleasure, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha would gain pleasure, since he lives in greater pleasure than Venerable Gotama.’

‘Clearly the venerables have spoken rashly, without reflection. Rather, I am the one who should be asked about who lives in greater pleasure, King Bimbisāra or Venerable Gotama?’

‘Clearly we spoke rashly and without reflection. But let that be. Now we ask Venerable Gotama: “Who lives in greater pleasure, King Bimbisāra or Venerable Gotama?”'

‘Well then, venerables, I will ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, venerables? Is King Bimbisāra capable of experiencing total pleasure for seven days and nights without moving his body or speaking?’

‘No, he is not, venerable.’

‘What do you think, venerables? Is King Bimbisāra capable of experiencing total pleasure for six days … five days … four days … three days … two days … one day?’

‘No, he is not, venerable.’

‘But I am capable of experiencing total pleasure for one day and night without moving his body or speaking. I am capable of experiencing total pleasure for two days … three days … four days … five days … six days … seven days. What do you think, venerables? This being so, who lives in greater pleasure, King Bimbisāra or I?’

‘This being so, Venerable Gotama lives in greater pleasure than King Bimbisāra.’”

That is what the Auspicious One said. Pleased, Mahānāma the Sakyan delighted in what the Auspicious One said.
