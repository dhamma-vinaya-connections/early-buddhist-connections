# MN 59 - The Many Kinds of Feeling

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Auspicious One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.

Then the chamberlain Pañcakaṅga approached Venerable Udāyī, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Venerable sir, how many feelings has the Auspicious One spoken of?”

“Chamberlain, the Auspicious One has spoken of three feelings: pleasant, unpleasant, and neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant. The Auspicious One has spoken of these three feelings.”

When he said this, Pañcakaṅga said to Venerable Udāyī, “Venerable sir Udāyī, the Auspicious One has not spoken of three feelings. He has spoken of two feelings: pleasant and unpleasant. The Auspicious One said that neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling is a peaceful and refined kind of pleasure.”

For a second time, Venerable Udāyī said to Pañcakaṅga, “The Auspicious One has not spoken of two feelings, he has spoken of three.” For a second time, Pañcakaṅga said to Venerable Udāyī, “The Auspicious One has not spoken of three feelings, he has spoken of two.”

And for a third time, Venerable Udāyī said to Pañcakaṅga, “The Auspicious One has not spoken of two feelings, he has spoken of three.”

And for a third time, Pañcakaṅga said to Venerable Udāyī, “The Auspicious One has not spoken of three feelings, he has spoken of two.”

But neither was able to persuade the other.

Venerable Ānanda heard this discussion between Venerable Udāyī and Pañcakaṅga. Then he approached the Auspicious One, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed the Auspicious One of all they had discussed. When he had spoken, the Auspicious One said to him,

“Ānanda, the explanation by the bhikkhu Udāyī, which the chamberlain Pañcakaṅga did not agree with, was quite correct. But, the explanation by Pañcakaṅga, which Udāyī did not agree with, was also quite correct. In one explanation, I have spoken of two feelings. In another explanation, I have spoken of three feelings, or five, six, eighteen, thirty-six, or a hundred and eight feelings. I have explained the teaching in all these different ways. This being so, you can expect that those who do not concede, approve, or agree with what has been well spoken, will argue, quarrel, and fight, continually wounding each other with barbed words. I have explained the teaching in all these different ways. This being so, you can expect that those who do concede, approve, or agree with what has been well spoken, will live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.

There are these five avenues of sensuality. What five? Sights cognizable by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensuality, and enticing. Sounds cognizable by the ear … Smells cognizable by the nose … Tastes cognizable by the tongue … Touches cognizable by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensuality, and enticing. These are the five avenues of sensuality. The pleasure and joy that arises based on these five avenues of sensuality is called the pleasure of sensuality.

There are those who would say that this is the highest pleasure and joy that beings experience. But I do not grant them that. Why is that? Because there is another pleasure that is finer than that. And what is that pleasure? It is when a bhikkhu, having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality, having withdrawn from unbeneficial phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and pleasure born of withdrawal, abides having entered upon the first jhāna. This is a pleasure that is finer than that.

There are those who would say that this is the highest pleasure and joy that beings experience. But I do not grant them that. Why is that? Because there is another pleasure that is finer than that. And what is that pleasure? It is when a bhikkhu, with the appeasement of thinking and pondering, with internal confidence and collectedness of mind, without thinking or pondering and with joy and pleasure born of composure, abides having entered upon second jhāna.

There is another pleasure that is finer than that. And what is that pleasure? It is when a bhikkhu, with the fading of joy, abides equanimous, recollected, and aware, experiencing pleasure with the body. He abides having entered upon the third jhāna, with regard to which the noble ones say “one abides equanimous, recollected, and at ease.”

There is another pleasure that is finer than that. And what is that pleasure? It is when a bhikkhu, with the giving up of pleasure and displeasure—and with the ending of joys and upsets beforehand—without ease or unease, with purity of equanimity and recollectedness, abides having entered upon the fourth jhāna.

There is another pleasure that is finer than that. And what is that pleasure? It is when a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of resistance, not attending to perceptions of multiplicity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, abides having entered upon the extent of infinite space.

There is another pleasure that is finer than that. And what is that pleasure? It is when a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted the extent of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, abides having entered upon the extent of infinite consciousness. …

There is another pleasure that is finer than that. And what is that pleasure? It is when a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted the extent of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing’, abide having entered upon the extent of nothingness. …

There is another pleasure that is finer than that. And what is that pleasure? It is when a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted the extent of nothingness, abides having entered upon the extent of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. This is a pleasure that is finer than that.

There are those who would say that this is the highest pleasure and joy that beings experience. But I do not grant them that. Why is that? Because there is another pleasure that is finer than that. And what is that pleasure? It is when a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted the extent of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, abides having entered upon the cessation of perception-and-feeling. This is a pleasure that is finer than that.

It is possible that wanderers of other teachings might say, ‘The ascetic Gotama spoke of the cessation of perception-and-feeling, and he defines it as a kind of pleasure. Why is that? How can that be?’

When wanderers of other teachings say this, you should say to them, ‘Venerables, the Auspicious One does not define only pleasant feeling as pleasure. Wherever pleasure can be found and in whichever way, the Realized One defines that as a kind of pleasure.’” 

That is what the Auspicious One said. Pleased, Venerable Ānanda delighted in what the Auspicious One said.
