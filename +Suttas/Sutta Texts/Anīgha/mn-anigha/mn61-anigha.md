# MN 61 - Advice to Venerable Rāhula at Ambalaṭṭhika

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Auspicious One was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.

Now at that time, Venerable Rāhula was staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā. Then, in the late afternoon, the Auspicious One came out of retreat and went to Ambalaṭṭhika to see Venerable Rāhula. Venerable Rāhula saw the Auspicious One coming off in the distance. He spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feet. The Auspicious One sat on the seat spread out, and washed his feet. Venerable Rāhula bowed to the Auspicious One and sat down to one side.

Then the Auspicious One, leaving a little water in the pot, addressed Venerable Rāhula, “Rāhula, do you see this little bit of water left in the pot?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“That is how little of the ascetic’s nature is left in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.”

Then the Auspicious One, discarding what little water was left in the pot, said to Venerable Rāhula, “Do you see this small amount of water that was discarded?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“That is how the ascetic’s nature is discarded in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.”

Then the Auspicious One, turning the pot upside down, said to Venerable Rāhula, “Do you see how this pot is turned upside down?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“That is how the ascetic’s nature is turned upside down in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.”

Then the Auspicious One, turning the pot right side up, said to Venerable Rāhula, “Do you see how this pot is vacant and hollow?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“That is how vacant and hollow the ascetic’s nature is in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.

Suppose there was a royal bull elephant with tusks like chariot-poles, able to draw a heavy load, pedigree, and battle-hardened. In battle it uses its fore-feet and hind-feet, its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, and tail, but it still protects its trunk. So, its rider thinks: ‘This royal bull elephant still protects its trunk. It has not yet given its life.’ But when that royal bull elephant … in battle uses its fore-feet and hind-feet, its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, and tail, and its trunk, its rider thinks: ‘This royal bull elephant … in battle uses its fore-feet and hind-feet, its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, and tail, and its trunk. It has given its life. Now there is nothing that royal bull elephant would not do.’

In the same way, when someone is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie, there is no bad deed they would not do, I say. So you should train like this: ‘I will not tell a lie, even for a joke.’

What do you think, Rāhula? What is the purpose of a mirror?”

“It is for inspection, venerable sir.”

“In the same way, actions of body, speech, and thought should be done only after repeated inspection. 

When you want to act with the body, you should inspect that act: ‘Does this act with the body that I want to do lead to my affliction, to that of others, or to that of both? Is it unbeneficial, yielding suffering and resulting in suffering?’  If, while inspecting in this way, you know: ‘This act with the body that I want to do leads to my affliction, to that of others, or to that of both. It is unbeneficial, it yields suffering and results in suffering.’ To the best of your ability, Rāhula, you should not do such an action. But if, while inspecting in this way, you know: ‘This act with the body that I want to do does not lead to my affliction, to that of others, or that of both. It is beneficial, yielding ease and resulting in ease.’ Then, Rāhula, you should do such an action.

While you are acting with the body, you should inspect that same act: ‘Does this act with the body that I am doing lead to my affliction, to that of others, or to that of both? Is it unbeneficial, yielding suffering and resulting in suffering?’ If, while inspecting in this way, you know: ‘This act with the body that I am doing leads to my affliction, to that of others, or to that of both. It is unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should desist from such an act. But if, while inspecting in this way, you know: ‘This act with the body that I am doing does not lead to my affliction, to that of others, or to that of both. It is beneficial, yielding ease and resulting in ease.’ Then, Rāhula, you should continue such an act.

After you have acted with the body, you should inspect that same act: ‘Does this act with the body that I have done lead to my affliction, to that of others, or to that of both? Is it unbeneficial, yielding suffering and resulting in suffering?’ If, while inspecting in this way, you know: ‘This act with the body that I have done leads to my affliction, to that of others, or to that of both. It is unbeneficial, yielding suffering and resulting in suffering.’ Then, Rāhula, you should confess, reveal, and clarify such an act to the Teacher or a wise fellow renunciate. And, having revealed it, you should restrain yourself in the future. But if, while inspecting in this way, you know: ‘This act with the body that I have done does not lead to my affliction, to that of others, or to that of both. It is beneficial, yielding ease and resulting in ease.’  Then, Rāhula, you should live in joy and gladness because of this, training day and night in beneficial qualities.

When you want to act with speech, you should inspect that same act: ‘Does this act of speech that I want to do lead to my affliction, to that of others, or to that of both? …’ …

If, while checking in this way, you know: ‘This act of speech that I have done leads to my affliction, to that of others, or to that of both. It is unbeneficial, yielding suffering and resulting in suffering.’ Then, Rāhula, you should confess, reveal, and clarify such an act to the Teacher or a wise fellow renunciate. And having revealed it, you should restrain yourself in the future. But if, while checking in this way, you know: ‘This act of speech that I have done does not lead to my affliction, to that of others, or to that of both. It is beneficial, yielding ease and resulting in ease.’  Then, Rāhula, you should live in joy and gladness because of this, training day and night in beneficial qualities.

When you want to act by thought, you should inspect that same act: ‘Does this act by thought that I want to do lead to my affliction, to that of others, or to that of both? …’ … 

If, while inspecting in this way, you know: ‘This act by thought that I have done leads to my affliction, to that of others, or to that of both. It is unbeneficial, yielding suffering and resulting in suffering.’ Then, Rāhula, you should be horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that act. And being repelled, you should restrain yourself in the future. But if, while inspecting in this way, you know: ‘This act by thought that I have done does not lead to my affliction, to that of others, or to that of both. It is beneficial, yielding ease and resulting in ease.’  Then, Rāhula, you should live in joy and gladness because of this, training day and night in beneficial qualities.

All the ascetics and brahmins of the past, future, and present who purify their physical, verbal, and mental actions do so after repeatedly inspecting. So, Rāhula, you should train yourself like this: ‘Repeatedly inspecting, I will purify my physical, verbal, and mental actions.’”

That is what the Auspicious One said. Pleased, Venerable Rāhula delighted in what the Auspicious One said.
