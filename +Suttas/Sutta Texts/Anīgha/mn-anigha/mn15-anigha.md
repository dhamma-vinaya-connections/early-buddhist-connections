# MN 15 - Evaluation


Thus have I heard. At one time, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood. There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the bhikkhus: “Venerables, bhikkhus!”

“Venerable,” they replied. Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:

“Suppose a bhikkhu invites other bhikkhus to admonish him. But he is hard to admonish, having qualities that make him hard to admonish. He is not forbearing, and does not take instruction respectfully. So his fellow renunciates do not think it is worth advising and instructing him, and they do not regard him as trustworthy.

And what are the qualities that make him hard to admonish? Firstly, a bhikkhu has evil wishes, having fallen under the sway of evil wishes. This is a quality that makes him difficult to admonish.

Furthermore, a bhikkhu glorifies himself and denigrates others. …

He is prone to anger, overcome by anger …

He is prone to anger, and resentful due to anger …

He is prone to anger, and stubborn due to anger …

He is prone to anger, and utters words bordering on anger …

When accused, he objects to the accuser …

When accused, he rebukes the accuser …

When accused, he retorts to the accuser …

When accused, he evades the issue, distracts the discussion with irrelevant points, becomes agitated, and displays hate and bitterness …

When accused, he is unable to account for the evidence …

He denigrates and is contentious …

He is jealous and stingy …

He is devious and deceitful …

He is obstinate and arrogant …

Furthermore, a bhikkhu is attached to his own views, holding them firmly, and refusing to relinquish them. This too is a quality that makes him difficult to admonish.

These are the qualities that make him difficult to admonish.

Suppose a bhikkhu does not invite other bhikkhus to admonish him. But he is easy to admonish, having qualities that make him easy to admonish. He is accepting, and takes instruction respectfully. So his fellow renunciates think it is worth advising and instructing him, and regard him as trustworthy.

And what are the qualities that make him easy to admonish? Firstly, a bhikkhu does not have evil wishes …

Furthermore, a bhikkhu is not attached to his own views, not holding them firmly, but letting them go easily.

These are the qualities that make him easy to admonish.

In such a case, a bhikkhu should evaluate himself like this. ‘This individual has evil wishes, having fallen under the sway of evil wishes. And I do not like or approve of this individual. And if I were to fall under the sway of evil wishes, others would not like or approve of me.’ A bhikkhu who knows this should give rise to the intent: ‘I will not fall under the sway of evil wishes.’ …

‘This individual is attached to his own views, holding them firmly and refusing to relinquish them. And I do not like or approve of this individual. And if I were to be attached to my own views, holding them firmly and refusing to relinquish them, others would not like or approve of me.’ A bhikkhu who knows this should give rise to the intent: ‘I will not be attached to my own views, holding them firmly, but will relinquish them easily.’

In such a case, a bhikkhu should inspect himself like this: ‘Do I have evil wishes? Have I fallen under the sway of evil wishes?’ Suppose that, upon inspection, a bhikkhu knows that he has fallen under the sway of evil wishes. Then, he should make an effort to abandon those bad, unbeneficial qualities. But suppose that, upon inspection, a bhikkhu knows that he has not fallen under the sway of evil wishes. Then he should live with joy and gladness on account of that, training day and night in beneficial qualities. …

Suppose that, upon inspection, a bhikkhu knows that he is attached to his own views, holding them firmly, and refusing to relinquish them. Then, he should make an effort to abandon those bad, unbeneficial qualities. Suppose that, upon inspection, a bhikkhu knows that he is not attached to his own views, holding them firmly, but relinquishes them easily. Then, he should live with joy and gladness on account of that, training day and night in beneficial qualities.

Suppose that, upon inspection, a bhikkhu sees that he has not abandoned all these bad, unbeneficial qualities. Then, he should make an effort to abandon them all. But suppose that, upon inspection, a bhikkhu sees that he has abandoned all these bad, unbeneficial qualities. Then, he should live with joy and gladness on account of that, training day and night in beneficial qualities.

Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and they examine their own reflection in a clean, bright mirror or a clear bowl of water. If they see any dirt or blemish there, they would endeavor to remove it. But if they do not see any dirt or blemish there, they are pleased, thinking: ‘How fortunate that I am clean!’

In the same way, suppose that, upon inspection, a bhikkhu sees that he has not abandoned all these bad, unbeneficial qualities. Then, he should make an effort to abandon them all. But suppose that, upon inspection, a bhikkhu sees that he has abandoned all these bad, unbeneficial qualities. Then, he should live with joy and gladness on account of that, training day and night in beneficial qualities.” 

This is what Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said. Pleased, the bhikkhus delighted in what Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said.
