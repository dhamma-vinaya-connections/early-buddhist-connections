# AN 10.62 - Craving

“Bhikkhus, this is said: ‘No first point of craving for being is evident, before which there was no craving for being, and afterwards it came to be.’  Still, it is evident that ‘craving for being depends on this.’

I say that craving for being has its nutriment, it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for craving for being? You should say: ‘Ignorance.’

I say that ignorance has its nutriment, it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for ignorance? You should say: ‘The five hindrances.’

I say that the five hindrances have their nutriment, they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the five hindrances? You should say: ‘The three kinds of misconduct.’ 

I say that the three kinds of misconduct have their nutriment, they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the three kinds of misconduct? You should say: ‘Lack of sense restraint.’ 

I say that lack of sense restraint has it is nutriment, it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for lack of sense restraint? You should say: ‘Lack of recollectedness-and-awareness.’

I say that lack of recollectedness-and-awareness has it is nutriment, it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for lack of recollectedness-and-awareness? You should say: ‘Attention not in light of the origin.’ 

I say that attention not in light of the origin has it is nutriment, it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for attention not in light of the origin? You should say: ‘Lack of faith.’ 

I say that lack of faith has it is nutriment, it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for lack of faith? You should say: ‘Not listening to the true teaching.’

I say that not listening to the true teaching has its nutriment, it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for not listening to the true teaching? You should say: ‘Not associating with righteous men.’

In this way, when the factor of not associating with righteous men is fulfilled, it fulfills the factor of not listening to the true teaching. When the factor of not listening to the true teaching is fulfilled, it fulfills the factor of lack of faith … attention not in light of the origin … lack of recollectedness-and-awareness … lack of sense restraint …the three kinds of misconduct … the five hindrances. When the five hindrances are fulfilled, they fulfill ignorance.  When ignorance is fulfilled, it fulfills craving for being. That is how craving for being is nourished, and that is how it is fulfilled.

It is like when it rains heavily on a mountain top, and the water flows downhill to fill the hollows, crevices, and creeks. As they become full, they fill up the pools. The pools fill up the lakes, the lakes fill up the streams, and the streams fill up the rivers. And as the rivers become full, they fill up the ocean. That is how the ocean is nourished, and that is how it is filled.

In the same way, when the factor of not associating with righteous men is fulfilled, it fulfills the factor of not listening to the true teaching. When the factor of not listening to the true teaching is fulfilled, it fulfills the factor of lack of faith … attention not in light of the origin … lack of recollectedness-and-awareness … lack of sense restraint …the three kinds of misconduct … the five hindrances. When the five hindrances are fulfilled, they fulfill ignorance.  When ignorance is fulfilled, it fulfills craving for being. That is how craving for being is nourished, and that is how it is fulfilled.

I say that knowledge-and-liberation has its nutriment, it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for knowledge-and-liberation? You should say, ‘The seven awakening factors.’

I say that the seven awakening factors have their nutriment, they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the seven awakening factors? You should say, ‘The four foundations of recollectedness.’

I say that the four foundations of recollectedness have their nutriment, they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the four foundations of recollectedness? You should say, ‘The three kinds of good conduct.’ 

I say that the three kinds of good conduct have their nutriment, they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the three kinds of good conduct? You should say, ‘Sense restraint.’

I say that sense restraint has it is nutriment, it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for sense restraint? You should say: ‘recollectedness-and-awareness.’

I say that recollectedness-and-awareness has it is nutriment, it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for recollectedness-and-awareness? You should say: ‘Attention in light of the origin.’

I say that attention in light of the origin has it is nutriment, it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for attention in light of the origin? You should say: ‘Faith.’

I say that faith has it is nutriment, it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for faith? You should say: ‘Listening to the true teaching.’

I say that listening to the true teaching has it is nutriment, it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for listening to the true teaching? You should say: ‘Associating with righteous men.’

In the same way, when the factor of associating with righteous men is fulfilled, it fulfills the factor of listening to the true teaching. When the factor of listening to the true teaching is fulfilled, it fulfills the factor of faith … attention in light of the origin … recollectedness-and-awareness … sense restraint …the three kinds of good conduct … the four foundations of recollectedness … the seven awakening factors. When the seven awakening factors are fulfilled, they fulfill knowledge-and-liberation. That is how knowledge-and-liberation is nourished, and that is how it is fulfilled.

It is like when it rains heavily on a mountain top, and the water flows downhill to fill the hollows, crevices, and creeks. As they become full, they fill up the pools. The pools fill up the lakes, the lakes fill up the streams, and the streams fill up the rivers. And as the rivers become full, they fill up the ocean. That is how the ocean is nourished, and that is how it is filled.

When the seven awakening factors are fulfilled, they fulfill knowledge-and-liberation. That is how knowledge-and-liberation is nourished, and that is how it is fulfilled.”
