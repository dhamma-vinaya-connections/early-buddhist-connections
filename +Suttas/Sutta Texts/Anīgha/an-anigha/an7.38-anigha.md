# AN 7.38 - Discriminative Insight (1st)

“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu with seven qualities will soon live having for himself comprehended, experienced, and entered upon the four kinds of discriminative insight. What seven?

Here, a bhikkhu understands as it is: ‘This is sluggishness of my mind’. 

When his mind is internally constricted, he understands that as it is.

When his mind is externally scattered, he understands that as it is.

Knowingly feelings arise for him, knowingly they endure, knowingly they subside. 

Knowingly perceptions arise for him, knowingly they endure, knowingly they subside.

Knowingly thoughts arise for him, knowingly they endure, knowingly they subside.

The indication of qualities—suitable or unsuitable, inferior or superior, or those on the side of dark or bright—is properly grasped, kept in mind, remembered, and comprehended with wisdom. 

A bhikkhu with these seven qualities will soon live having for himself comprehended, experienced, and entered upon the four kinds of discriminative insight.
