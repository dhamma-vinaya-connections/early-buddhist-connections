# AN 3.84 - The Vajji

At one time the Auspicious One was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then a certain Vajji bhikkhu approached the Auspicious One, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:

“Bhante, each fortnight over a hundred and fifty training rules are recited. I am not able to train in them.”

“But bhikkhu, are you able to train in three trainings: the higher virtue, the higher mind, and the higher understanding?”

“I am, Bhante.”

“So, bhikkhu, you should train in these three trainings: the higher virtue, the higher mind, and the higher understanding.

As you train in these, you will give up passion, aversion, and muddledness. Then you will not do anything unbeneficial, or engage in anything harmful.”

After some time, that bhikkhu trained in the higher virtue, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom. He gave up passion, aversion, and muddledness. With the abandoning of passion, aversion, and muddledness, he did not do anything unbeneficial, or engage in anything harmful.
