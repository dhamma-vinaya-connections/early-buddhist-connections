# AN 4.163 - Ugly


“Bhikkhus, there are four kinds of practice. What four?

1.  Unpleasant practice with slow insight,
2.  unpleasant practice with swift insight,
3.  pleasant practice with slow insight, and
4.  pleasant practice with swift insight.

And what is the unpleasant practice with slow insight? It is when a bhikkhu abides maintaining perspective of the non-beauty of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness of food, perceiving the lack of satisfaction in the whole world, maintaining perspective of the impermanence of all activations, and has well established the perception of death internally. He relies on these five powers of a trainee: faith, shame, remorse \[for wrongdoing\], effort, and understanding. But these five faculties manifest in him weakly: faith, effort, recollectedness, composure, and understanding. Because of this, he only slowly comes into proximity of the destruction of the influxes. This is called the unpleasant practice with slow insight.

And what is the unpleasant practice with swift insight? It is when a bhikkhu abides maintaining perspective of the non-beauty of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness of food, perceiving the lack of satisfaction in the whole world, maintaining perspective of the impermanence of all activations, and has well established the perception of death internally. He relies on these five powers of a trainee: faith, shame, remorse \[for wrongdoing\], effort, and understanding. And these five faculties manifest in him strongly: faith, effort, recollectedness, composure, and understanding. Because of this, he swiftly comes into proximity of the destruction of the influxes. This is called the unpleasant practice with swift insight.

And what is the pleasant practice with slow insight? It is when a bhikkhu, having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality, having withdrawn from unbeneficial phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of withdrawal, abides having entered upon the first jhāna. With the appeasement of thinking and pondering, with internal confidence and collectedness of mind, without thinking or pondering and with joy and ease born of composure, a bhikkhu abides having entered upon the second jhāna. With the fading of joy, a bhikkhu abides equanimous, recollected, and aware, experiencing ease with the body. He abides having entered upon the third jhāna, with regard to which the noble ones say “one abides equanimous, recollected, and at ease.” With the giving up of ease and unease—and with the ending of joys and upsets beforehand—without ease or unease, with purity of equanimity and recollectedness, a bhikkhu abides having entered upon the fourth jhāna. He relies on these five powers of a trainee: faith, shame, remorse \[for wrongdoing\], effort, and understanding. But these five faculties manifest in him weakly: faith, effort, recollectedness, composure, and understanding. Because of this, he only slowly comes into proximity of the destruction of the influxes. This is called the pleasant practice with slow insight.

And what is the pleasant practice with swift insight? It is when a bhikkhu … abides having entered upon the first jhāna … second jhāna … third jhāna … fourth jhāna … He relies on these five powers of a trainee: faith, shame, remorse \[for wrongdoing\], effort, and understanding. And these five faculties manifest in him strongly: faith, effort, recollectedness, composure, and understanding. Because of this, he swiftly comes into proximity of the destruction of the influxes. This is called the pleasant practice with swift insight.

These are the four kinds of practice.”
