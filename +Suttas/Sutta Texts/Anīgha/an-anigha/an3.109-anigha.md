# AN 3.109 - Unguarded

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Auspicious One, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Auspicious One said to him:

“Householder, when the _citta_ is unguarded, actions of body, speech, and thought are unguarded.  For one whose actions by body, speech, and thought are unguarded, those actions are “soaked”. For one whose actions by, body, speech, and thought are “soaked”, those actions become rotten. For one whose actions of body, speech, and thought are rotten, there will not be a good death, a good passing.

It is like a bungalow with a bad roof. The roof peak, rafters, and walls are unguarded. They become soaked, and rotten.

In the same way, when the _citta_ is unguarded, actions of body, speech, and thought are unguarded. … For one whose actions of body, speech, and thought are rotten, there will not be a good death, a good passing.

“Householder, when the _citta_ is guarded, actions of body, speech, and thought are guarded. For one whose actions of body, speech, and thought are guarded, those actions do not become “soaked”. For one whose actions by body, speech, and thought are not “soaked”, those actions do not become rotten. For one whose actions of body, speech, and thought are not rotten, there will be a good death, a good passing.

It is like a bungalow with a good roof. The roof peak, rafters, and walls are guarded. They do not become soaked, and rotten.

In the same way, when the _citta_ is guarded, actions of body, speech, and thought are guarded. … For one whose actions of body, speech, and thought are not rotten, there will be a good death, a good passing.”
