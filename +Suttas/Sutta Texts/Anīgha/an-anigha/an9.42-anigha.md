# AN 9.42 - Confinement

At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. Then Venerable Udāyī approached Venerable Ānanda and exchanged pleasantries with him. When the amicable and cordial talk was over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda, “Venerable, this was said by the god Pañcālacaṇḍa:

> ‘The opening amid confinement was discovered by the Buddha of vast wisdom, who awakened to jhāna, the sage, the solitary bull.’

But what is confinement, and what is the opening amid confinement that the Auspicious One spoke of?”

“Venerable, these five avenues of sensuality are called ‘confinement’ by the Auspicious One. What five? Sights cognizable by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensuality, and enticing. Sounds cognizable by the ear … Smells cognizable by the nose … Tastes cognizable by the tongue … Touches cognizable by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensuality, and enticing. “Venerable, these five avenues of sensuality are called ‘confinement’ by the Auspicious One.

Now, take a bhikkhu who, having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality … abides having entered upon the first jhāna. To this extent the Auspicious One spoke of an opening amid confinement from a certain angle.  But there is still confinement there. And what is the confinement there? Whatever thinking and pondering has not ceased there is the confinement in this case.

‘Furthermore, take a bhikkhu who, with the appeasement of thinking and pondering … abides having entered upon the second jhāna.’ To this extent the Auspicious One spoke of an opening amid confinement from a certain angle. But there is still confinement there. And what is the confinement there? Whatever joy has not ceased there is the confinement in this case.

‘Furthermore, take a bhikkhu who, with the fading of joy … abides having entered upon the third jhāna.’ To this extent the Auspicious One spoke of an opening amid confinement from a certain angle. But there is still confinement there. And what is the confinement there? Whatever joy of equanimity has not ceased there is the confinement in this case.

Furthermore, take a bhikkhu who, with the giving up of ease and unease … abides having entered upon the fourth jhāna. To this extent the Auspicious One spoke of an opening amid confinement from a certain angle. But there is still confinement there. And what is the confinement there? Whatever perception of form has not ceased there is the confinement in this case.

Furthermore, a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of resistance, not attending to perceptions of multiplicity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, abides having entered upon the extent of infinite space. To this extent the Auspicious One spoke of an opening amid confinement from a certain angle. But there is still confinement there. And what is the confinement there? Whatever perception of the extent of infinite space has not ceased there is the confinement in this case.

Furthermore, a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted the extent of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, abides having entered upon the extent of infinite consciousness. To this extent the Auspicious One spoke of an opening amid confinement from a certain angle. But there is still confinement there. And what is the confinement there? Whatever perception of the extent of infinite consciousness has not ceased there is the confinement in this case.

Furthermore, a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted the extent of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing’, abides having entered upon the extent of nothingness. To this extent the Auspicious One spoke of an opening amid confinement from a certain angle. But there is still confinement there. And what is the confinement there? Whatever perception of the extent of nothingness has not ceased there is the confinement in this case.

Furthermore, a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted the extent of nothingness, abides having entered upon the extent of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. To this extent the Auspicious One spoke of an opening amid confinement from a certain angle. But there is still confinement there. And what is the confinement there? Whatever perception of the extent of neither-perception-nor-non-perception has not ceased there is the confinement in this case.

Furthermore, a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted the extent of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, abides having entered upon the cessation of perception-and-feeling. And, having seen with understanding, his influxes are destroyed. To this extent the Auspicious One spoke of an opportunity amid confinement in a definitive sense.”
