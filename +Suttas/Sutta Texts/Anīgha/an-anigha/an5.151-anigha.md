# AN 5.151 - Surety in the Right Way (1st)

“Bhikkhus, someone with five qualities is unable to enter the sure path with regard to beneficial qualities even when listening to the true teaching. What five? They discredit the talk, the speaker, or themselves. They listen with a scattered and distracted mind. They attend not in light of the origin. Someone with these five qualities is unable to enter the sure path with regard to beneficial qualities even when listening to the true teaching.

Someone with five qualities is able to enter the sure path with regard to beneficial qualities when listening to the true teaching. What five? They do not discredit the talk, the speaker, or themselves. They listen with an unscattered and unified mind. They attend in light of the origin.  Someone with these five qualities is able to enter the sure path with regard to beneficial qualities when listening to the true teaching.”
