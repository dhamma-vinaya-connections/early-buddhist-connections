# AN 5.152 - Surety in the Right Way (2nd)

“Bhikkhus, someone with five qualities is unable to enter the sure path with regard to beneficial qualities even when listening to the true teaching. What five? They discredit the talk, the speaker, or themselves. They are witless, dull, and obtuse. They think they understand what they do not understand. Someone with these five qualities is unable to enter the sure path with regard to beneficial qualities even when listening to the true teaching.
