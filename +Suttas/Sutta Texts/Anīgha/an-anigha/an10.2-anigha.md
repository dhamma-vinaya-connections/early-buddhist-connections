# AN 10.2 - Exerting an Intention

“Bhikkhus, for a virtuous person, one who is accomplished in virtue, no intention need be exerted: ‘May non-regret arise in me!’ It is only natural that non-regret arises in a virtuous person who is accomplished in virtue.  For one without regret, no intention need be exerted: ‘May gladness arise in me!’ It is only natural that gladness is born for one without regret.  For one who is glad, no intention need be exerted: ‘May joy arise in me!’ It is only natural that joy arises for one who is glad. For one whose mind is joyous, no intention need be exerted: ‘May my body become calm!’ It is only natural that for one whose mind is joyous, the body becomes calm. For one whose body is calm, no intention need be exerted: ‘May I feel at ease!’ It is only natural that one whose body is calm feels at ease. For one who is at ease, no volition need be exerted: ‘May my mind become composed!’ It is only natural that for one who is at ease, the mind becomes composed. For one who is composed, no intention need be exerted: ‘May I know and see accurately!’ It is only natural that one who is composed knows and sees accurately. For one who knows and sees accurately, no intention need be exerted: ‘May I become disenchanted and dispassionate!’ It is only natural that one who knows and sees accurately becomes disenchanted and dispassionate. For one who is disenchanted and dispassionate, no intention need be exerted: ‘May I realize the knowledge-and-vision of liberation!’ It is only natural that one who is disenchanted and dispassionate realizes the knowledge-and-vision of liberation.

And so, bhikkhus, the knowledge-and-vision of freedom is the purpose and benefit of disenchantment and dispassion. Disenchantment and dispassion is the purpose and benefit of truly knowing and seeing. Knowing and seeing accurately is the purpose and benefit of composure. Composure is the purpose and benefit of ease. Ease is the purpose and benefit of calm. Calm is the purpose and benefit of joy. Joy is the purpose and benefit of gladness. Gladness is the purpose and benefit of non-regret. Non-regret is the purpose and benefit of virtuous behavior. And so, bhikkhus, things flow on and fill up from one to the other, for going from the near shore to the far shore.”
