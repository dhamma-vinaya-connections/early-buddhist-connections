# AN 9.41 - With the Householder Tapussa

At one time the Auspicious One was staying in the land of the Mallas, near the Mallian town named Uruvelakappa.

Then the Auspicious One dressed in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Uruvelakappa for alms. Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, you stay here, while I plunge deep into the Great Wood for the day’s abiding.”

“Yes, Bhante,” Ānanda replied. Then the Auspicious One plunged deep into the Great Wood and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s abiding.

The householder Tapussa approached Venerable Ānanda, bowed, sat to one side, and said to him:

“Bhante Ānanda, we are laypeople who partake in sensuality. We enjoy sensuality, we are fond of it and are pleased by it. To us laypeople who partake in sensuality, who enjoy it, are fond of it, and are pleased by it, renunciation seems like an abyss. I have heard that in this teaching-and-discipline there are very young bhikkhus whose minds leap at renunciation; their minds, seeing it as peaceful, are confident, settled, and liberated in it. It is precisely renunciation that is the dividing line between the multitude and the bhikkhus in this teaching-and-discipline.”

“Householder, we should see the Auspicious One regarding this discussion. Come, let us approach the Auspicious One and inform him of this matter. As he answers, so we will remember it.”

“Yes, Bhante,” replied Tapussa. Then Venerable Ānanda together with Tapussa approached the Auspicious One, bowed, and sat down to one side. Venerable Ānanda informed him of the matter.

“That is exactly how it is, Ānanda. Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought, ‘Renunciation is good! Seclusion is good!’ But my mind did not see renunciation as peaceful, and so it did not leap at it, and was not confident, settled, and liberated in it. Then I thought, ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind does not see renunciation as peaceful, and so it does not leap at it, and is not confident, settled, and liberated in it?’ Then I thought, ‘I have not seen the peril of sensuality, and I have not cultivated that. I have not realized the value of renunciation, and I have not fostered that. That is why my mind does not see renunciation as peaceful, and so does not leap at it, and is not confident, settled, and liberated in it.’  Then I thought, ‘Suppose that, having seen the peril of sensuality, I were to cultivate that. And suppose that, having realized the value of renunciation, I were to foster that.  It is possible that, seeing it as peaceful, my mind would leap at renunciation, and be confident, settled, and liberated in it.’ And so, after some time, having seen the peril of sensuality, I cultivated that, and having realized the value of renunciation, I fostered that. Then, seeing it as peaceful, my mind leapt at renunciation, and was confident, settled, and liberated in it. And so, having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality, having withdrawn from unbeneficial phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of withdrawal, I abided having entered upon the first jhāna.  As I abided in that way, perceptions and attentions connected with sensuality beset me, and that was an affliction for me. Suppose unease would arise for someone who is at ease; that would be an affliction for them. In the same way, perceptions and attentions connected with sensuality beset me, and that was an affliction for me. 

Then I thought, ‘Why don’t I, with the appeasement of thinking and pondering … abide having entered upon the second jhāna?’ But my mind did not see the absence of thinking as peaceful, and so it did not leap at it, and was not confident, settled, and liberated in it. Then I thought, ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind does not see the absence of thinking as peaceful, and so it does not leap at it, and is not confident, settled, and liberated in it?’ Then I thought, ‘I have not seen the peril of thinking, and I have not cultivated that. I have not realized the value of the absence of thinking, and I have not fostered that. That is why my mind does not see the absence of thinking as peaceful, and so it does not leap at it, and is not confident, settled, and liberated in it.’ Then I thought, ‘Suppose that, having seen the peril of thinking, I were to cultivate that. And suppose that, having realized the value of the absence of thinking, I were to foster that. It is possible that, seeing it as peaceful, my mind would leap at the absence of thinking, and be confident, settled, and liberated in it.’  And so, after some time, having seen the peril of thinking, I cultivated that, and having realized the value of the absence of thinking, I fostered that. Then, seeing it as peaceful, my mind leapt at the absence of thinking, and was confident, settled, and liberated in it. ‘And so, with the appeasement of thinking and pondering … I abided having entered upon the second jhāna.’ As I abided in that way, perceptions and attentions connected with thinking beset me, and that was an affliction for me. Suppose unease would arise for someone who is at ease; that would be an affliction for them. In the same way, perceptions and attentions connected with thinking beset me, and that was an affliction for me.

Then I thought, ‘Why don’t I—with the fading of joy, abiding equanimous, recollected, and comprehending, experiencing ease with the body—abide having entered upon the third jhāna, with regard to which the noble ones say “one abides equanimous, recollected, and at ease”?’. But my mind did not see the absence of joy as peaceful, and so it did not leap at it, and was not confident, settled, and liberated in it. Then I thought, ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind does not see the absence of joy as peaceful, and so it does not leap at it, and is not confident, settled, and liberated in it?’ Then I thought, ‘I have not seen the peril of joy, and I have not cultivated that. I have not realized the value of the absence of joy, and I have not fostered that. That is why my mind does not see the absence of joy as peaceful, and so it does not leap at it, and is not confident, settled, and liberated in it.’ Then I thought, ‘Suppose that, having seen the peril of joy, I were to cultivate that. And suppose that, having realized the value of the absence of joy, I were to foster that. It is possible that, seeing it as peaceful, my mind would leap at the absence of joy, and be confident, settled, and liberated in it.’ And so, after some time, having seen the peril of joy, I cultivated that, and having realized the value of the absence of joy, I fostered that. Then, seeing it as peaceful, my mind leapt at the absence of joy, and was confident, settled, and liberated in it. And so, with the fading of joy … I abided having entered upon the third jhāna. As I abided in that way, perceptions and attentions connected with joy beset me, and that was an affliction for me. Suppose unease would arise for someone who is at ease; that would be an affliction for them. In the same way, perceptions and attentions connected with joy beset me, and that was an affliction for me.

Then I thought, ‘Why don’t I, with the giving up of ease and unease—and with the ending of joys and upsets beforehand—without ease or unease, with purity of equanimity and recollectedness, abide having entered upon the fourth jhāna?’ But my mind did not see the absence of ease and unease as peaceful, and so it did not leap at it, and was not confident, settled, and liberated in it. Then I thought, ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind does not see the absence of ease and unease as peaceful, and so it does not leap at it, and is not confident, settled, and liberated in it?’ Then I thought, ‘I have not seen the peril of the equanimity-ease, and I have not cultivated that. I have not realized the value of the absence of ease and unease, and I have not fostered that. ‘That is why my mind does not see the absence of ease and unease as peaceful, and so it does not leap at it, and is not confident, settled, and liberated in it.’ Then I thought, ‘Suppose that, having seen the peril of the equanimity-ease, I were to cultivate that. And suppose that, having realized the value of the absence of ease and unease, I were to foster that. It is possible that, seeing it as peaceful, my mind would leap at the absence of ease and unease, and be confident, settled, and liberated in it.’ And so, after some time, having seen the peril of the equanimity-ease, I cultivated that, and having realized the value of the absence of ease and unease, I fostered that. Then, seeing it as peaceful, my mind leapt at the absence of ease and unease, and was confident, settled, and liberated in it. And so, with the giving up of ease and unease … I abided having entered upon the fourth jhāna. As I abided in that way, perceptions and attentions connected with equanimity beset me, and that was an affliction for me. Suppose unease would arise for someone who is at ease; that would be an affliction for them. In the same way, perceptions and attentions connected with equanimity beset me, and that was an affliction for me.

Then I thought, ‘Why don’t I, having fully surmounted perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of resistance, not attending to perceptions of multiplicity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, abide having entered upon the extent of infinite space?’ But my mind did not see the extent of infinite space as peaceful, and so it did not leap at it, and was not confident, settled, and liberated in it. Then I thought, ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind does not see the extent of infinite space as peaceful, and so it does not leap at it, and is not confident, settled, and liberated in it?’ Then I thought, ‘I have not seen the peril of form, and I have not cultivated that. I have not realized the value of the extent of infinite space, and I have not fostered that. That is why my mind does not see the extent of infinite space as peaceful, and so it does not leap at it, and is not confident, settled, and liberated in it.’ Then I thought, ‘Suppose that, having seen the peril of form, I were to cultivate that. And suppose that, having realized the value of the extent of infinite space, I were to foster that. It is possible that, seeing it as peaceful, my mind would leap at the extent of infinite space, and be confident, settled, and liberated in it.’ And so, after some time, having seen the peril of thinking, I cultivated that, and having realized the value of the absence of thinking, I fostered that. Then, seeing it as peaceful, my mind leapt at the extent of infinite space, and was confident, settled, and liberated in it. And so, having fully surmounted perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of resistance, not attending to perceptions of multiplicity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, I abided having entered upon the extent of infinite space. As I abided in that way, perceptions and attentions connected with form beset me, and that was an affliction for me. Suppose unease would arise for someone who is at ease; that would be an affliction for them. In the same way, perceptions and attentions connected with form beset me, and that was an affliction for me.

Then I thought, ‘Why don’t I, having fully surmounted the extent of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, abide having entered upon the extent of infinite consciousness?’ But my mind did not see the extent of infinite consciousness as peaceful, and so it did not leap at it, and was not confident, settled, and liberated in it. Then I thought, ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind does not see the extent of infinite consciousness as peaceful, and so it does not leap at it, and is not confident, settled, and liberated in it?’ Then I thought, ‘I have not seen the peril of the extent of infinite space, and I have not cultivated that. I have not realized the value of the extent of infinite consciousness, and I have not fostered that. That is why my mind does not see the field of field infinite consciousness as peaceful, and so it does not leap at it, and is not confident, settled, and liberated in it.’ Then I thought, ‘Suppose that, having seen the peril of the extent of infinite space, I were to cultivate that. And suppose that, having realized the value of the extent of infinite consciousness, I were to foster that. It is possible that, seeing it as peaceful, my mind would leap at the extent of infinite consciousness, and be confident, settled, and liberated in it.’ And so, after some time, having seen the peril of the extent of infinite space, I cultivated that, and having realized the value of the extent of infinite consciousness, I fostered that.

Suppose unease would arise for someone who is at ease; that would be an affliction for them. In the same way, perceptions and attentions connected with the extent of infinite space beset me, and that was an affliction for me.

Then I thought, ‘Why don’t I, having fully surmounted the extent of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing’, abide having entered upon the extent of nothingness?’ But my mind did not see the extent of nothingness as peaceful, and so it did not leap at it, and was not confident, settled, and liberated in it. Then I thought, ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind does not see the extent of nothingness as peaceful, and so it does not leap at it, and is not confident, settled, and liberated in it?’ Then I thought, ‘I have not seen the peril of the extent of infinite consciousness, and I have not cultivated that. I have not realized the value of the extent of nothingness, and I have not fostered that. That is why my mind does not see the extent of nothingness as peaceful, and so it does not leap at it, and is not confident, settled, and liberated in it.’ Then I thought, ‘Suppose that, having seen the peril of the extent of infinite consciousness, I were to cultivate that.

Then, seeing it as peaceful, my mind leapt at the extent of nothingness, and was confident, settled, and liberated in it. And so, having fully surmounted the extent of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing’, I abided abide having entered upon the extent of nothingness.

Suppose unease would arise for someone who is at ease; that would be an affliction for them. In the same way, perceptions and attentions connected with the extent of infinite consciousness beset me, and that was an affliction for me.

Then I thought, ‘Why don’t I, having fully surmounted the extent of nothingness, abide having entered upon the extent of neither-perception-nor-non-perception?’ But my mind did not see the extent of neither-perception-nor-non-perception as peaceful, and so it did not leap at it, and was not confident, settled, and liberated in it. Then I thought, ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind does not see the extent of neither-perception-nor-non-perception as peaceful, and so it does not leap at it, and is not confident, settled, and liberated in it?’ Then I thought, ‘I have not seen the peril of the extent of nothingness, and I have not cultivated that.

Then I thought, ‘Why don’t I, having fully surmounted the extent of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, abide having entered upon the cessation of perception-and-feeling?’ But my mind did not see the cessation of perception-and-feeling as peaceful, and so it did not leap at it, and was not confident, settled, and liberated in it. Then I thought, ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind does not see the cessation of perception-and-feeling as peaceful, and so it does not leap at it, and is not confident, settled, and liberated in it?’ Then I thought, ‘I have not seen the peril of the extent of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, and I have not cultivated that.

And so, having fully surmounted the extent of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, I abided having entered upon the cessation of perception-and-feeling. And, having seen with understanding, my influxes were destroyed.

As long as I had not entered upon and withdrawn from these nine progressive attainments of abiding in both forward and reverse order, I did not announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.

But when I had entered upon and withdrawn from these nine progressive attainments of abiding in both forward and reverse order, I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.

Knowledge-and-vision arose in me: ‘My liberation of mind is unshakable; this is my last birth; now there will be no renewal of being.’
