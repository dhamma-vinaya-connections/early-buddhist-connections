# AN 10.93 - What Is Your View?


At one time, the Auspicious One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day to see the Auspicious One. Then it occurred to him, “It is the wrong time to see the Auspicious One, as he is in retreat. And it is the wrong time to see the esteemed bhikkhus, as they are in retreat. Why don’t I visit the monastery of the wanderers of other teachings?”

Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers of other teachings. Now at that time, the wanderers of other teachings had come together, making an uproar, a dreadful racket as they sat and talked about all kinds of low topics.

They saw Anāthapiṇḍika coming off in the distance, and stopped each other, saying, “Be quiet, good sirs, do not make a sound. The householder Anāthapiṇḍika, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming into our monastery. He is one among the white-clothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing in Sāvatthī. Such venerables like the quiet, are trained to be quiet, and praise the quiet. Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he will see fit to approach.”

Then those wanderers of other teachings fell silent. Then Anāthapiṇḍika approached them, and exchanged pleasantries with those wanderers. When the amicable and cordial talk was over, he sat down to one side. The wanderers said to him, “Tell us, householder, what is the view of the ascetic Gotama?”

“Venerable sirs, I do not know all his views.”

“Well then, since it seems you do not know all the views of the ascetic Gotama, tell us, what are the views of the bhikkhus?”

“Venerable sirs, I do not know all the bhikkhus’ views.”

“Well then, since it seems you do not know all the views of the ascetic Gotama or of the bhikkhus, tell us, householder, what is your view?”

“Venerable sirs, it is not hard for me to explain what my views are. But please, let the venerables explain their own convictions first. Afterwards it will not be hard for me to explain my views.”

When he said this, one of the wanderers said to him, “The cosmos is eternal. Only this matters; all else is irrelevant.  That is my view, householder.”

Another wanderer said, “The cosmos is not eternal. Only this matters; all else is irrelevant. That is my view, householder.”

Another wanderer said, “The cosmos is finite …” … “The cosmos is infinite …” … “The soul and the body are the same thing …” … “The soul and the body are different things …” … “A realized one still exists after death …” … “A realized one no longer exists after death …” … “A realized one both still exists and no longer exists after death …” … “A realized one neither still exists nor no longer exists after death. Only this matters; all else is irrelevant. That is my view, householder.”

When this was said, Anāthapiṇḍika said this, “Venerable sirs, regarding the venerable who said this: ‘The cosmos is eternal. Only this matters; all else is irrelevant. That is my view, householder.’ This view of his has either arisen from his own attention not in light of the origin, or based on the utterance of another.  But that view is arisen, determined, chosen, dependently originated. Anything that is arisen, determined, chosen, and dependently originated is impermanent. And what is impermanent is suffering. That which is suffering is what he clings to and holds to.

But that view is arisen, determined, chosen, dependently originated. Anything that is arisen, determined, chosen, and dependently originated is impermanent. And what is impermanent is suffering.

Only this matters; all else is irrelevant. That is my view, householder.’ This view of his has either arisen from his own attention diverging from the origin, or based upon the utterance of another. But that view is arisen, determined, chosen, dependently originated. Anything that is arisen, determined, chosen, and dependently originated is impermanent. And what is impermanent is suffering. That which is suffering is what he clings to and holds to.”

When he said this, the wanderers said to him, “Householder, we have each explained our own convictions. Tell us, householder, what is your view?”

“Venerable sirs, anything that is arisen, determined, chosen, and dependently originated is impermanent. And what is impermanent is suffering. And what is suffering is not mine, I am not that, that is not my self. That is my view, venerable sirs.”

“Householder, anything that is arisen, determined, chosen, and dependently originated is impermanent. And what is impermanent is suffering. That which is suffering is what you, householder, cling to and hold to.”

“Venerable sirs, anything that is arisen, determined, chosen, and dependently originated is impermanent. And what is impermanent is suffering. And I have seen clearly as it is, with right understanding, that what is suffering is not mine, I am not that, that is not my self. And I understand as it is the escape beyond that.”

When this was said, those wanderers sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. Seeing this, Anāthapiṇḍika arose from his seat. He went to the Auspicious One, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed the Auspicious One of all they had discussed.

“Good, good, householder! That is how you should legitimately and completely refute those inept men from time to time.”

Then the Auspicious One educated, encouraged, uplifted, and inspired the householder Anāthapiṇḍika with a Dhamma talk, after which Anāthapiṇḍika arose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Auspicious One before leaving.

Then, not long after Anāthapiṇḍika had left, the Auspicious One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, even a bhikkhu who has been ordained for a hundred years in this teaching-and-discipline would thoroughly and legitimately refute those wanderers of other teachings in just the same way as the householder Anāthapiṇḍika did.”
