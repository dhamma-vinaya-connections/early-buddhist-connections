# AN 3.101 - A Panner

“Bhikkhus, gold has coarse defilements: sand, soil, and gravel. A panner or his apprentice pours it into a pan, where he washes, rinses, and cleans it. When that has been eliminated, there are medium defilements in the gold: fine grit and coarse sand. The panner washes it again. When that has been eliminated, there are fine defilements in the gold: fine sand and black grime. The panner washes it again. When that has been eliminated, only gold dust is left. A goldsmith or his apprentice places the gold in a crucible where he blows, melts, and smelts it. Still the gold is not settled and the dross is not entirely gone. It is not pliable, workable, or radiant, but is brittle and not completely ready for working. But the goldsmith continues blowing, melting, and smelting it. The gold becomes pliable, workable, and radiant, not brittle, and ready to be worked. Then the goldsmith can successfully create any kind of ornament he wants, whether a bracelet, earrings, a necklace, or a golden garland.

In the same way, a bhikkhu who is committed to the higher mind has coarse defilements: misconduct by body, speech, and thought. A sincere, capable bhikkhu gives these up, dispels, eliminates, and obliterates them. 

When they have been given up and eliminated, there are middling defilements: sensual, averse, or cruel thoughts. A sincere, capable bhikkhu gives these up, dispels, eliminates, and obliterates them. 

When they have been given up and eliminated, there are fine defilements: thoughts of family, country, and reputation. A sincere, capable bhikkhu gives these up, dispels, eliminates, and obliterates them.

When they have been given up and eliminated, only thoughts about the Dhamma remain.  That composure is not peaceful or sublime or calm or unified, but is held in place by active repression.

But there comes a time when that mind is established, settled, unified, and composed internally. That composure is peaceful and sublime and calm and unified, not held in place by active repression. By directing his mind towards it, he is able to realize whatever phenomenon is to be realized by comprehension, provided there is the \[required\] extent of recollectedness (_sati_). 

If he wishes: ‘May I wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying myself and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with my hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling my body as far as the Brahmā realm.’ He is able to realize it, provided there is the \[required\] extent of recollectedness (_sati_).

If he wishes: ‘With the divine ear element that is purified and superhuman, may I hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.’ He is able to realize it, provided there is the \[required\] extent of recollectedness (_sati_).

If he wishes: ‘May I understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with my mind. May I understand mind with passion as ‘mind with passion’, and mind without passion as ‘mind without passion’; mind with aversion as “mind with aversion”, and mind without aversion as “mind without aversion”; mind with muddledness as “mind with muddledness”, and mind without muddledness as “mind without muddledness”; constricted mind as “constricted mind”, and scattered mind as “scattered mind”; expansive mind as “expansive mind”, and unexpansive mind as “unexpansive mind”; mind that is not supreme as “mind that is not supreme”, and mind that is supreme as “mind that is supreme”; mind composed as “mind composed”, and mind not composed as “mind not composed”; liberated mind as “liberated mind”, and unliberated mind as “unliberated mind”.’ He is able to realize it, provided there is the \[required\] extent of recollectedness (_sati_).

If he wishes: ‘May I recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand births; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. May I remember: “There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and displeasure, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place, I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and displeasure, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place, I was reborn here.” May I recollect my many past lives, with features and details.’ He is able to realize it, provided there is the \[required\] extent of recollectedness (_sati_).

If he wishes: ‘With the divine eye that is purified and superhuman, may I see beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good or a bad destination—and understand how beings reappear according to their actions: “These dear beings engaged in misconduct by way of body, speech, and thought. They found fault with the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act in line with that wrong view. On the dissolution of the body, after death, they reappear in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and thought. They did not find fault with the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act in line with that right view. On the dissolution of the body, after death, they reappear in a good place, a heavenly realm.” And so, with the divine eye that is purified and superhuman, may I see beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good or a bad destination. And may I understand how beings reappear according to their actions.’ He is able to realize it, provided there is the \[required\] extent of recollectedness (_sati_).

If he wishes: ‘May I, with the destruction of the influxes, abide having entered upon the liberation by mind and liberation by understanding that is devoid of influxes, having for myself comprehended and realized it right in the present experience.’ He is able to realize it, provided there is the \[required\] extent of recollectedness (_sati_).
