# AN 1.51-60 - The Chapter on a Finger-Snap

## 51

“This mind, bhikkhus, is radiant.  But it is blemished by adventitious defilements. The unlearned ordinary person does not understand this as it is.  Therefore, I say that for the unlearned ordinary person there is no development of the mind.” 

## 52

“This mind, bhikkhus, is radiant. And it is freed from adventitious defilements. A learned noble disciple understands this as it is. Therefore, I say that for the learned noble disciple there is development of the mind.”

## 53

“If, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu cultivates a mind of friendliness even as long as a finger-snap, he is called a bhikkhu who does not lack jhāna, who follows the Teacher’s instructions, who responds to advice, and who does not eat the country’s alms in vain. How much more so those who make much of it!”

## 54

“If, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops a mind of friendliness even as long as a finger-snap, he is called a bhikkhu who does not lack jhāna, who follows the Teacher’s instructions, who responds to advice, and who does not eat the country’s alms in vain. How much more so those who make much of it!”

## 55

“If, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu attends to the mind of friendliness even as long as a finger-snap, he is called a bhikkhu who does not lack jhāna, who follows the Teacher’s instructions, who responds to advice, and who does not eat the country’s alms in vain. How much more so those who make much of it!”

## 56

“Bhikkhus, the mind shapes all phenomena whatsoever that are unbeneficial, part of the unbeneficial, on the side of the unbeneficial. The mind is the first of those phenomena to arise, and unbeneficial phenomena follow immediately thereafter.”

## 57

“Bhikkhus, the mind shapes all phenomena whatsoever that are beneficial, part of the beneficial, on the side of the beneficial. The mind is the first of those phenomena to arise, and beneficial phenomena follow immediately thereafter.”

## 58

“Bhikkhus, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to unarisen unbeneficial qualities, or makes arisen beneficial qualities decline like carelessness. When you are careless, unarisen unbeneficial qualities arise and arisen beneficial qualities decline.”

## 59

“Bhikkhus, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to unarisen beneficial qualities, or makes arisen unbeneficial qualities decline like heedfulness. When you are heedful, unarisen beneficial qualities arise and arisen unbeneficial qualities decline.”

## 60

“Bhikkhus, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to unarisen unbeneficial qualities, or makes arisen beneficial qualities decline like laziness. When you are lazy, unarisen unbeneficial qualities arise and arisen beneficial qualities decline.”
