# AN 5.153 - Surety in the Right Way (3rd)

“Bhikkhus, someone with five qualities is unable to enter the sure path with regard to beneficial qualities even when listening to the true teaching. What five? They listen to the teaching bent on disparaging it. They listen to the teaching with a hostile, fault-finding mind. They are antagonistic to the teacher, planning to attack them. They are witless, dull, and obtuse. And they think they understand what they do not understand.  Someone with these five qualities is unable to enter the sure path with regard to beneficial qualities even when listening to the true teaching.

Someone with five qualities is able to enter the sure path with regard to beneficial qualities when listening to the true teaching. What five? They do not listen to the teaching bent on disparaging it. They do not listen to the teaching with a hostile, fault-finding mind. They are not antagonistic to the teacher, and not planning to attack them. They are wise, not dull or obtuse. And they do not think they understand what they do not understand. Someone with these five qualities is able to enter the sure path with regard to beneficial qualities, when listening to the true teaching.”
