# AN 5.114 - At Andhakavinda


At one time the Auspicious One was staying in the land of the Magadhans at Andhakavinda. Then Venerable Ānanda approached the Auspicious One, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Auspicious One said to him:

“Ānanda, those bhikkhus who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching-and-discipline should be encouraged, supported, and established in five things. What five?

They should be encouraged, supported, and established in restraint in the monastic code: ‘Venerables, please be virtuous. Live restrained in the monastic code, conducting yourselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, keep the rules you have undertaken.’ 

They should be encouraged, supported, and established in sense restraint: ‘Venerables, please live with sense doors guarded, remembering to be judicious and on guard, with a mind guarded by recollectedness.’ 

They should be encouraged, supported, and established in limiting their speech: ‘Venerables, please speak little. Put a limit on your speech.’ 

They should be encouraged, supported, and established in seclusion: ‘Venerables, please be forest-dwellers. Frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.’ 

They should be encouraged, supported, and established in right perspective: ‘Venerables, please have right view and right perspective.’ 

Those bhikkhus who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching-and-discipline, should be encouraged, supported, and established in these five things.”
