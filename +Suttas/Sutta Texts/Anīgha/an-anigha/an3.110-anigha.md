# AN 3.110 - Amiss

Seated to one side, the Auspicious One said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika:

“Householder, when the mind is amiss, bodily, verbal, and mental actions are also amiss.  One whose bodily, verbal, and mental actions are amiss will not have a good death. Just as when a bungalow is  poorly roofed, the roof peak, rafters, and walls are also amiss, in the same way, when the mind is amiss, bodily, verbal, and mental actions are also amiss. One whose bodily, verbal, and mental actions are amiss will not have a good death.

When the mind is not amiss, bodily, verbal, and mental actions are also not amiss. One whose bodily, verbal, and mental actions are not amiss will have a good death. Just as when a bungalow is well-roofed, the roof peak, rafters, and walls are also not amiss, in the same way, when the mind is not amiss, bodily, verbal, and mental actions are also not amiss. One whose bodily, verbal, and mental actions are not amiss will have a good death.”
