# AN 5.24 - Unvirtuous

“Bhikkhus, for an unvirtuous person, one who lacks virtue, the vital condition for right composure has been destroyed.  There being no right composure, for one who lacks right composure, the vital condition for true knowledge-and-vision has been destroyed. There being no accurate knowledge-and-vision, for one who lacks accurate knowledge-and-vision, the vital condition for disenchantment and dispassion has been destroyed. There being no disenchantment and dispassion, for one who lacks disenchantment and dispassion, the vital condition for the knowledge-and-vision of liberation has been destroyed.

Suppose there was a tree that lacked branches and foliage. Its shoots, bark, softwood, and heartwood would not grow to fullness.
