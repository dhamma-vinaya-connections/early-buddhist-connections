# AN 6.68 - Enjoying Company

“Bhikkhus, it is impossible that a bhikkhu who enjoys association and company, who is fond of them and is devoted to enjoying them, would enjoy being alone in seclusion.  Not enjoying being alone in seclusion, it is impossible that he will pick up the sign of the mind.  Not picking up the sign of the mind, it is impossible that he will fulfill Right View.  Having not fulfilled Right View, it is impossible that he will fulfill Right Composure.  Having not fulfilled Right Composure, it is impossible that he will give up the fetters. Having not given up the fetters, it is impossible that he will realize Nibbāna.
