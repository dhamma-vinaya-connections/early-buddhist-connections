# AN 3.94 - Springtime


“Bhikkhus, just as how after the rainy season the sky is clear and cloudless, and when the sun rises, it dispels all the darkness from the sky as it shines and glows and radiates,

so too, when the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arises for a noble disciple, three fetters are given up: personality-view, doubt, and the grasping at virtue-and-duty.

Afterwards they abandon two things: longing and ill will. Having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality, having withdrawn from unbeneficial phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of withdrawal, they abide having entered upon the first jhāna. If that noble disciple passed away at that time, they are bound by no fetter owing to which they might return to this world.”
