# AN 4.162 - In Detail


“Bhikkhus, there are four kinds of practice. What four?

1.  Unpleasant practice with slow insight,
2.  unpleasant practice with swift insight,
3.  pleasant practice with slow insight, and
4.  pleasant practice with swift insight.

And what is the unpleasant practice with slow insight? It is when someone is by nature acutely given to passion, and often experiences the pain and displeasure born of passion. They are by nature acutely given to aversion, and often experience the pain and displeasure born of aversion. They are by nature acutely given to muddledness, and often experience the pain and displeasure born of muddledness. These five faculties manifest in them weakly: faith, effort, recollectedness, composure, and understanding.  Because of this, they only slowly come into proximity of the destruction of the influxes. This is called the unpleasant practice with slow insight.

And what is the unpleasant practice with swift insight? It is when someone is by nature acutely given to passion, and often experiences the pain and displeasure born of passion. They are by nature acutely given to aversion, and often experience the pain and displeasure born of aversion. They are by nature acutely given to muddledness, and often experience the pain and displeasure born of muddledness. And these five faculties manifest in them strongly: faith, effort, recollectedness, composure, and understanding. Because of this, they swiftly come into proximity of the destruction of the influxes. This is called the unpleasant practice with swift insight.

And what is pleasant practice with slow insight? It is when someone is by nature not acutely given to passion, and does not often experience the pain and displeasure born of passion. They are by nature not acutely given to aversion, and do not often experience the pain and displeasure born of aversion. They are by nature not acutely given to muddledness, and do not often experience the pain and displeasure born of muddledness. These five faculties manifest in them weakly: faith, effort, recollectedness, composure, and understanding. Because of this, they only slowly come into proximity of the destruction of the influxes. This is called the pleasant practice with slow insight.

And what is the pleasant practice with swift insight? It is when someone is by nature not acutely given to passion, and does not often experience the pain and displeasure born of passion. They are by nature not acutely given to aversion, and do not often experience the pain and displeasure born of aversion.

This is called the pleasant practice with swift insight.

These are the four kinds of practice.”
