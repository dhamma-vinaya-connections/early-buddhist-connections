# AN 4.12 - After Virtue


“Bhikkhus, live fulfilling virtue and the training rules. Live restrained by the code of conduct, endowed with proper behavior and a suitable environment. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, train in the training rules. When you have done this, what more is there to do? 

If while walking, a bhikkhu is free from longing and ill will, and has given up indolence and lethargy, restlessness and anxiety, and doubt, and his effort is roused up and steadfast, his recollectedness is established and lucid, his body is calm and unperturbed, and his mind is composed and collected, he is said to be—while walking—‘diligent and judicious, consistently effortful and resolute’.

If while standing … sitting … If while lying down, a bhikkhu is free from longing and ill will, and has given up indolence and lethargy, restlessness and anxiety, and doubt, and his effort is roused up and steadfast, his recollectedness is established and lucid, his body is calm and unperturbed, and his mind is composed and collected, he is said to be—while lying down—‘diligent and judicious, consistently effortful and resolute’.

> Restrained in walking, restrained in standing,  restrained in sitting, and restrained in lying down. A bhikkhu bends his limbs restrained, and extends them restrained.
> 
> Above, below, all round, as far as the earth extends; he reflects on the rising and waning of phenomena—of the aggregates. 
> 
> Training in the proper course of mental calm, always recollected, they call such a bhikkhu ‘continuously resolute’.”
