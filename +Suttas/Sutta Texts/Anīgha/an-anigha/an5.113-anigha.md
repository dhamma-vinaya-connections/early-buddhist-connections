# AN 5.113 - Right Composure

“Bhikkhus, endowed with five qualities, a bhikkhu cannot abide having entered upon right composure. What five? It is when a bhikkhu cannot endure sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches.  Endowed with these five qualities, a bhikkhu cannot abide having entered upon right composure.
