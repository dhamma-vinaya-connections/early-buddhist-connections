# AN 11.9 - With Sandha


At one time, the Auspicious One was staying at Ñātika in the brick house.

Then Venerable Sandha approached the Auspicious One, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Auspicious One said to him:

“Sandha, meditate like a thoroughbred, not like a wild colt.

And how does a wild colt meditate? A wild colt, tied by the feeding trough, meditates: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ Why is that? Because it does not occur to the wild colt tied by the feeding trough: ‘What task will the horse trainer have me do today? How should I respond?’ Tied by the feeding trough, it meditates: ‘Fodder, fodder!’

In the same way, take a certain unruly man who has gone to the forest, the root of a tree, or an empty hut. His mind is overcome and mired in sensual desire, and he does not understand as it is the escape from arisen sensual desire. Harboring sensual desire internally, he meditates and contemplates and cogitates and ruminates. His mind is overcome by ill will … indolence-and-lethargy … restlessness-and-anxiety … doubt … Harboring doubt internally, he meditates and contemplates and cogitates and ruminates. He meditates dependent on earth, water, fire, and air. He meditates dependent on the extent of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, or neither-perception-nor-non-perception. He meditates dependent on this world or the other world. He meditates dependent on what is seen, heard, thought, cognized, attained, sought, or explored by the mental faculty. That is how an untrained person meditates.

And how does a thoroughbred meditate? A fine thoroughbred, tied by the feeding trough, does not meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ Why is that? Because it occurs to the fine thoroughbred tied by the feeding trough: ‘What task will the horse trainer have me do today? How should I respond?’ Tied by the feeding trough, it does not meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ For that fine thoroughbred regards the use of the goad as a debt, a bond, a loss, a misfortune.

In the same way, take a certain fine thoroughbred man who has gone to the forest, the root of a tree, or an empty hut. His mind is not overcome and mired in sensual desire, and he understands as it is the escape from arisen sensual desire.  His mind is not overcome by ill will … indolence-and-lethargy … restlessness-and-anxiety … doubt … He does not meditate dependent on earth, water, fire, and air. He does not meditate dependent on the extent of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, or neither-perception-nor-non-perception. He does not meditate dependent on this world or the other world. He does not meditate dependent on what is seen, heard, thought, cognized, attained, sought, or explored by the mental faculty. Yet he does meditate.

When a fine thoroughbred meditates like this, the gods together with Indra, Brahmā, and the Progenitor worship him from afar:

> ‘Homage to you, O thoroughbred! Homage to you, supreme among men! We do not understand what your meditation depends on.’”

When he said this, Venerable Sandha asked the Auspicious One, “But Bhante, how does that fine thoroughbred meditate?”

“Sandha, for a fine thoroughbred, the perception of earth is absent while earth is there. The perception of water … fire … air is absent while air is there. The perception of the extent of infinite space is absent while the extent of infinite space is there. The perception of the extent of infinite consciousness … nothingness … neither-perception-nor-non-perception is absent while the extent of neither-perception-nor-non-perception is there. The perception of this world is absent while this world is there. The perception of the other world is absent while the other world is there. And the perception of what is seen, heard, thought, cognized, attained, sought, or explored by the mental faculty is absent while that is there.  That is how that fine thoroughbred man does not meditate dependent on earth, water, fire, and air. He does not meditate dependent on the extent of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, or neither-perception-nor-non-perception. He does not meditate dependent on this world or the other world. He does not meditate dependent on what is seen, heard, thought, cognized, attained, sought, or explored by the mental faculty.  Yet he does meditate.

When a fine thoroughbred meditates like this, the gods together with Indra, Brahmā, and the Progenitor worship him from afar:

> ‘Homage to you, O thoroughbred! Homage to you, supreme among men! We do not understand what your meditation depends on.’”
