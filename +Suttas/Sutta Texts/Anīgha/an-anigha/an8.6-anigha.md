# AN 8.6 - Worldly phenomena (2nd)

“Bhikkhus, the eight worldly phenomena revolve around the world, and the world revolves around the eight worldly phenomena. What eight? Gain and loss, honor and dishonor, blame and praise, pleasure and pain. These eight worldly phenomena revolve around the world, and the world revolves around these eight worldly phenomena.

An unlearned ordinary person encounters gain and loss, honor and dishonor, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain. And so does a learned noble disciple. What, then, is the difference between a learned noble disciple and an ordinary unlearned person?”

“Our teachings are rooted in the Auspicious One. He is our guide and our refuge. Bhante, may the Auspicious One himself please clarify the meaning of this. The bhikkhus will listen and remember it.”

“Well then, bhikkhus, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante” they replied. The Auspicious One said this:

“Bhikkhus, an unlearned ordinary person encounters gain. They do not reflect: ‘This gain has arisen for me. It is impermanent, suffering, and perishable.’ They do not understand it as it is. They encounter loss … honor … dishonor … blame … praise … pleasure … pain. They do not reflect: ‘This pain has arisen for me. It is impermanent, suffering, and perishable.’ They do not understand it as it is.

So gain and loss, honor and dishonor, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain endure with a grip on their mind. They favor gain and resist loss. They favor honor and resist dishonor. They favor praise and resist blame. They favor pleasure and resist pain. Being thus engaged in favoring and resisting, they are not freed from birth, aging, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, displeasure, sadness, and distress. They are not freed from suffering, I say.

A learned noble disciple encounters gain. They reflect: ‘This gain has arisen for me. It is impermanent, suffering, and perishable.’ They understand it as it is. They encounter loss … honor … dishonor … blame … praise … pleasure … pain. They reflect: ‘This pain has arisen for me. It is impermanent, suffering, and perishable.’ They understand it as it is.

So gain and loss, honor and dishonor, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain do not endure with a grip on their mind. They do not favor gain or resist loss. They do not favor honor or resist dishonor. They do not favor praise or resist blame. They do not favor pleasure or resist pain. Being thus devoid of favoring and opposing, they are freed from birth, aging, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, displeasure, sadness, and distress. They are freed from suffering, I say. This is the difference between a learned noble disciple and an unlearned ordinary person.

> Gain and loss, honor and dishonor, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain. These qualities among people are impermanent, transient, and perishable.
> 
> A wise and mindful person, having known these things, sees them as liable to perish. Desirable things do not disturb their mind, nor are they repelled by the undesirable.
> 
> Both favoring and resisting are cleared and ended, they are no more. Knowing the untainted, sorrowless state, one who has gone beyond being understands rightly.”
