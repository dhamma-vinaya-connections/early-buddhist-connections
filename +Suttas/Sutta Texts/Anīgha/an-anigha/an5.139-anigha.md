# AN 5.139 - Cannot Endure

“Bhikkhus, a royal bull elephant with five factors is not worthy of a king, not fit to serve a king, and is not considered a factor of kingship. What five? It is when a royal bull elephant cannot endure sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches.

And how is it that a royal bull elephant cannot endure sights? It is when a royal bull elephant gone to battle falters and founders at the sight of a division of elephants, of cavalry, of chariots, or of infantry. It does not stay firm, and fails to plunge into battle. That is how a royal bull elephant cannot endure sights.

And how is it that a royal bull elephant cannot endure sounds? It is when a royal bull elephant, gone to battle, falters and founders at the sound of a division of elephants, of cavalry, of chariots, or of infantry, or the thunder of the drums, kettledrums, horns, and cymbals. It does not stay firm, and fails to plunge into battle. That is how a royal bull elephant cannot endure sounds.

And how is it that a royal bull elephant cannot endure smells? It is when a royal bull elephant, gone to battle, falters and founders when it smells the odor of the feces and urine of battle-hardened, pedigree royal bull elephants. It does not stay firm, and fails to plunge into battle. That is how a royal bull elephant cannot endure smells.

And how is it that a royal bull elephant cannot endure tastes? It is when a royal bull elephant, gone to battle, falters and founders when it misses a meal of grass and water, or it misses two, three, four, or five meals. It does not stay firm, and fails to plunge into battle. That is how a royal bull elephant cannot endure tastes.

And how is it that a royal bull elephant cannot endure touches? It is when a royal bull elephant, gone to battle, falters and founders when struck by a swift arrow, or by two, three, four, or five swift arrows. It does not stay firm, and fails to plunge into battle. That is how a royal bull elephant cannot endure touches.

A royal bull elephant with these five factors is not worthy of a king, not fit to serve a king, and is not considered a factor of kingship.

In the same way, a bhikkhu with five qualities is not worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, not worthy of hospitality, not worthy of a religious donation, not worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is not the supreme field of merit for the world. What five? It is when a bhikkhu cannot endure sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches.

And how is it that a bhikkhu cannot endure sights? It is when a bhikkhu, seeing a sight with his eyes, is aroused by a desirable sight—he is not able to compose the mind. That is how a bhikkhu cannot endure sights.

And how is it that a bhikkhu cannot endure sounds? It is when a bhikkhu, hearing a sound with his ears, is aroused by a desirable sound—he is not able to compose the mind. That is how a bhikkhu cannot endure sounds.

And how is it that a bhikkhu cannot endure smells? It is when a bhikkhu, smelling an odor with his nose, is aroused by a desirable smell—he is not able to compose the mind. That is how a bhikkhu cannot endure smells.

And how is it that a bhikkhu cannot endure tastes? It is when a bhikkhu, tasting a flavor with his tongue, is aroused by desirable tastes—he is not able to compose the mind. That is how a bhikkhu cannot endure tastes.

And how is it that a bhikkhu cannot endure touches? It is when a bhikkhu, feeling a touch with his body, is aroused by a desirable touch—he is not able to compose the mind. That is how a bhikkhu cannot endure touches.

A bhikkhu with these five qualities is not worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, not worthy of hospitality, not worthy of a religious donation, not worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is not the supreme field of merit for the world.
