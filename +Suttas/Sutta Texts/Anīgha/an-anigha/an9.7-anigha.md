# AN 9.7 - With Sutavā the Wanderer

At one time the Auspicious One was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. Then the wanderer Sutavā approached the Auspicious One, and exchanged pleasantries with him. When the amicable and cordial talk was over, he sat down to one side and said to the Auspicious One:

“Bhante, one time the Auspicious One was staying right here in Rājagaha, the Mountainfold. There I heard and learned this in the presence of the Auspicious One: ‘A bhikkhu who is an Arahant—with influxes destroyed, who is consummate, has done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved the highest goal, utterly destroyed the fetter of being, and is rightly liberated by right understanding—cannot transgress in five respects. A bhikkhu with influxes destroyed cannot deliberately take the life of a living creature, take something that was not given with the intention to steal, engage in sexual activity, tell a deliberate lie, or store up pleasures for the sake of enjoyment like he did before when living at home.’ I trust I properly heard, learned, applied the mind, and remembered that from the Auspicious One?”

“Indeed, Sutavā, you properly heard, learned, applied the mind, and remembered that. In the past, as today, I say this: ‘A bhikkhu who is an Arahant—with influxes destroyed, who is consummate, has done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved the highest goal, utterly destroyed the fetter of being, and is rightly liberated by right understanding—cannot transgress in nine respects. A bhikkhu with influxes destroyed cannot deliberately take the life of a living creature, take something that was not given with the intention to steal, engage in sexual activity, tell a deliberate lie, or store up pleasures for the sake of enjoyment like he did before when living at home. And he cannot take a course of action influenced by desire, aversion, muddledness, or fear.’ In the past, as today, I say this: ‘A bhikkhu who is an Arahant—with defilements ended, who is consummate, has done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved the highest goal, utterly destroyed the fetter of being, and is rightly liberated by right understanding—cannot transgress in these nine respects.
