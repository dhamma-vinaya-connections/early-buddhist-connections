# AN 8.53 - Brief Advice to Gotamī


At one time the Auspicious One was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Auspicious One, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:

“Bhante, may the Auspicious One please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I have heard it, I will live alone, withdrawn, heedful, diligent, and resolute.”

“Gotamī, the things that you would know lead to passion, not dispassion; to attachment, not to detachment; to accumulation, not diminution; to abundance of desires, not fewness of desires; to discontent, not contentment; to socializing, not seclusion; to laziness, not effort; to being burdensome, not being unburdensome: Categorically, you should remember them as not the Dhamma, not the Vinaya, and not the Teacher’s instructions.
