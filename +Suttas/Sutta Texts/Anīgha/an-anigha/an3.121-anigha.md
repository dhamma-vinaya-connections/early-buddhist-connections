# AN 3.121 - Purity (2nd)

“Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of purity. What three? Purity of body, speech, and thought.

And what is purity of body? It is when a bhikkhu abstains from killing living creatures, stealing, and incelibacy. This is called ‘purity of body’.

And what is purity of speech? It is when a bhikkhu abstains from false, malicious, harsh, and trivial speech. This is called ‘purity of speech’.

And what is purity of mind?

It is when a bhikkhu, when there is sensual desire internally, understands ‘There is sensual desire internally for me.’ When there is no sensual desire internally, he understands, ‘There is no sensual desire internally for me.’ He understands how unarisen sensual desire arises; how arisen sensual desire is abandoned; and how abandoned sensual desire does not arise again in the future.

When there is ill will internally, he understands, ‘There is ill will internally for me.’ When there is no ill will internally, he understands, ‘There is no ill will internally for me.’ He understands how unarisen ill will arises; how arisen ill will is abandoned; and how abandoned ill will does not arise again in the future.

When there is indolence-and-lethargy internally, he understands, ‘There is indolence-and-lethargy internally for me.’ When there is no indolence-and-lethargy internally, he understands, ‘There is no indolence-and-lethargy internally for me.’ He understands how unarisen indolence-and-lethargy arises; how arisen indolence-and-lethargy is abandoned; and how abandoned indolence-and-lethargy does not arise again in the future.

When there is restlessness-and-anxiety internally, he understands, ‘There is restlessness-and-anxiety internally for me.’ When there is no restlessness-and-anxiety internally, he understands, ‘There is no restlessness-and-anxiety internally for me.’ He understands how unarisen restlessness-and-anxiety arises; how arisen restlessness-and-anxiety is abandoned; and how abandoned restlessness-and-anxiety does not arise again in the future.

When there is doubt internally, he understands, ‘There is doubt internally for me.’ When there is no doubt internally, he understands, ‘There is no doubt internally for me.’ He understands how unarisen doubt arises; how arisen doubt is abandoned; and how abandoned doubt does not arise again in the future.

This is called ‘purity of mind’. 

These are the three kinds of purity.

> Purity of body, purity of speech, and undefiled purity of mind. One who is clean, endowed with purity, has washed off all evil, they say.”
