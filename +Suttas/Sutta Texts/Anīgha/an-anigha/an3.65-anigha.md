# AN 3.65 - With the Kālāmas of Kesamutta


Thus have I heard. At one time the Auspicious One, wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus, arrived at a town of the Kālāmas named Kesamutta. The Kālāmas of Kesamutta heard:

“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Kesamutta. He has this good reputation: ‘That Auspicious One is an Arahant, a fully awakened Auspicious One …’ It is good to see such Arahants.”

Then the Kālāmas approached the Auspicious One. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged pleasantries, some held up their joined palms toward the Auspicious One, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Seated to one side, the Kālāmas said to the Auspicious One:

“Bhante, there are some ascetics and brahmins who come to Kesamutta. They explain and promote only their own doctrine, while they attack, deride, disparage, and smear the doctrines of others. Then some other ascetics and brahmins come to Kesamutta. They too explain and promote only their own doctrine, while they attack, deride, disparage, and smear the doctrines of others. So, Bhante, we are doubting and uncertain: ‘I wonder who of these respected ascetics and brahmins speaks the truth, and who speaks falsehood?’”

“It is appropriate, Kālāmas, for you to be doubting and uncertain. Doubt has come up in you about an uncertain matter.

Kālāmas, do not go by oral transmission, by lineage, by hearsay, by canonical authority, by logic, by inference, by analysis of properties, by the acceptance of a view after consideration, by the appearance of competence, or by the thought ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ When you know for yourselves: ‘These things are unbeneficial, blameworthy, criticized by the wise, and, when undertaken, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up. 

What do you think, Kālāmas? When greed arises for a person internally, does it do so for their welfare or harm?”

“Harm, Bhante.”

“A greedy individual, overcome by greed, kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

“What do you think, Kālāmas? When aversion arises for a person internally, does it do so for their welfare or harm?”

“Harm, Bhante.”

“An averse individual, overcome by aversion, kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

“What do you think, Kālāmas? When muddledness arises for a person internally, does it do so for their welfare or harm?”

“Harm, Bhante.”

“A muddled individual, overcome by muddledness, kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

“What do you think, Kālāmas, are these things beneficial or unbeneficial?”

“Unbeneficial, Bhante.”

“Blameworthy or blameless?”

“Blameworthy, Bhante.”

“Criticized or praised by the wise?”

“Criticized by the wise, Bhante.”

“When undertaken, do they lead to harm and suffering, or not? Or how do you see this?”

“When undertaken, they lead to harm and suffering, Bhante. That is how we see it.”

“So, Kālāmas, when I said: ‘Kālāmas, do not go by oral transmission, by lineage, by hearsay, by canonical authority, by logic, by inference, by analysis of properties, by the acceptance of a view after consideration, by the appearance of competence, or by the thought ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But, when you know for yourselves: ‘These things are unbeneficial, blameworthy, criticized by the wise, and when undertaken, they lead to harm and suffering,’ then you should give them up. That is what I said, and this is why I said it.

Kālāmas, do not go by oral transmission,  by lineage, by hearsay, by canonical authority, by logic, by inference, by analysis of properties, by the acceptance of a view after consideration, by the appearance of competence, or by the thought ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But, when you know for yourselves: ‘These things are beneficial, blameless, praised by the wise, and when undertaken, they lead to welfare and ease,’ then you should abide having entered upon them.

What do you think, Kālāmas? When non-greed arises for a person internally, does it do so for their welfare or harm?”

“Welfare, Bhante.”

“An individual who is not greedy, not overcome by greed, does not kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, or encourage others to do the same. Is that for their lasting welfare and happiness?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

“What do you think, Kālāmas? When non-aversion arises for a person internally, does it do so for their welfare or harm? … When non-muddledness arises for a person internally, does it do so for their welfare or harm? … Is that for their lasting welfare and happiness?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

“What do you think, Kālāmas, are these things beneficial or unbeneficial?”

“Beneficial, Bhante.”

“Blameworthy or blameless?”

“Blameless, Bhante.”

“Criticized or praised by the wise?”

“Praised by the wise, Bhante.”

“When you undertake them, do they lead to welfare and happiness, or not? Or how do you see this?”

“When you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness. That is how we see it.”

“So, Kālāmas, when I said: ‘Kālāmas, do not go by oral transmission,  by lineage, by hearsay, by canonical authority, by logic, by inference, by analysis of properties, by the acceptance of a view after consideration, by the appearance of competence, or by the thought ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when you know for yourselves:

“These things are beneficial, blameless, praised by the wise, and when undertaken, they lead to welfare and ease,” then you should abide having entered upon them.’ That is what I said, and this is why I said it.

Then that noble disciple is rid of longing, rid of ill will, unmuddled, aware, and recollected. He abides having pervaded with a mind of friendliness the first direction, likewise second, likewise third, likewise the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, he abides having pervaded the whole world with a mind of friendliness—abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free of enmity and ill will.

He abides having pervaded with a mind of compassion …

He abides having pervaded with a mind of contentment …

He abides having pervaded with a mind of equanimity the first direction, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, he abides having pervaded the whole world with a mind of equanimity—abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free of enmity and ill will.

When that noble disciple has a mind that is thus free of enmity and ill will, undefiled and purified, they have won four consolations right in the present experience. ‘If it turns out there is another world, and good and bad actions have a result, then—when the body breaks up, after death—I will reappear in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ This is the first consolation they have won.

‘If it turns out there is no other world, and good and bad actions do not have a result, then in the present life I will keep myself free of enmity and ill will, untroubled and at ease.’ This is the second consolation they have won.

‘If it turns out that bad things happen to one who does bad things, then I still do not do anything bad. Since I do not do anything bad, how can suffering touch me?’ This is the third consolation they have won.

‘If it turns out that bad things do not happen to one who does bad things, then I still see myself pure in both respects.’ This is the fourth consolation they have won.

When that noble disciple has a mind that is thus free of enmity and ill will, undefiled and purified, they have won these four consolations right in the present experience.”

“Thus it is, Auspicious One! Thus it is, Excellent One! When that noble disciple has a mind that is thus free of enmity and ill will, undefiled and purified, they have won four consolations right in the present experience. …

Excellent, Bhante! Excellent! … We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the bhikkhu Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Auspicious One remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”
