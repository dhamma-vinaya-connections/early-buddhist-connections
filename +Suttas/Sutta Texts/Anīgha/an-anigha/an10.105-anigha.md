For one of wrong intention, wrong speech arises. For one of wrong speech, wrong action arises. For one of wrong action, wrong speech arises. For one of wrong action, wrong livelihood arises. For one of wrong livelihood, wrong effort arises. For one of wrong effort, wrong recollectedness arises. For one of wrong recollectedness, wrong composure arises. For one of wrong composure, wrong knowledge arises. For one of wrong knowledge, wrong liberation arises.
