### 219. The [Second] Discourse by Anuruddha

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time, in the afternoon, some monks rose from their meditation and approached the venerable Anuruddha. Having paid homage with their heads at his feet, they stepped back and sat to one side. They said, “We would like to ask a question. If permitted, may we venture to state it?” The venerable Anuruddha answered, “Venerable friends, ask whatever you wish to ask. Having heard it, I will consider it.” Then the monks asked, “What does it mean for a monk to die untroubled, to die an untroubled death?” The venerable Anuruddha answered: Venerable friends, suppose that a monk has straight views and has adopted the moral precepts cherished by the noble ones. Such a monk is said to die untroubled, to die an untroubled death.” Then the monks asked further, “Is this the best way for a monk to die untroubled, the best way to die an untroubled death?” The venerable Anuruddha answered: Venerable friends, this is not the best way for a monk to die untroubled, to die an untroubled death. Again, venerable friends, suppose that a monk internally contemplates the body as a body... feelings... [states of] mind... dharmas as dharmas. Such a monk is said to die untroubled, to die an untroubled death. Then the monks asked further, “Is this the best way for a monk to die untroubled, the best way to die an untroubled death?” The venerable Anuruddha answered: Venerable friends, this is not the best way for a monk to die untroubled, to die an untroubled death. Again, venerable friends, suppose that a monk with a mind imbued with loving-kindness dwells pervading one direction, likewise the second, the third, and the fourth direction, and also the four intermediate directions, above and below, all around, everywhere. With

a mind imbued with loving-kindness, without fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention, he dwells pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well-cultivated. Likewise, he imbues his mind with compassion... with empathic joy... with equa nimity, without fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention, he dwells pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well-cultivated. Such a monk is said to die untroubled, to die an untroubled death. Then the monks asked further, “Is this the best way for a monk to die untroubled, the best way to die an untroubled death?” The venerable Anuruddha answered: Venerable friends, this is not the best way for a monk to die untroubled, to die an untroubled death. Again, venerable friends, suppose that a monk, completely transcending perception of form... up to... dwells having attained the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception. Such a monk is said to die untroubled, to die an untroubled death. Then the monks asked further, “Is this the best way for a monk to die untroubled, the best way to die an untroubled death?” The venerable Anuruddha answered: Venerable friends, this is not the best way for a monk to die untroubled, to die an untroubled death. Again, venerable friends, suppose that a monk, transcending the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, dwells personally experiencing the cessation of perception and knowing, and observes with wisdom that all taints have been eradicated. Such a monk is said to die untroubled, to die an untroubled death. Then the monks asked further, “Is this the best way for a monk to die untroubled, the best way to die an untroubled death?” The venerable Anuruddha answered, “Venerable friends, this is [indeed] the best way for a monk to die untroubled, to die an untroubled death.” Then the monks, having heard what the venerable Anuruddha had said, received and remembered it well. They rose from their seats, paid homage with their heads at the venerable Anuruddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and left.

This is what the venerable Anuruddha said. Having heard what the venerable Anuruddha had said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
