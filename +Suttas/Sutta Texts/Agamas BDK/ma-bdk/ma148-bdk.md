### 148. The Discourse on What Is Suffering

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi, while roaming around in the afternoon, approached the Buddha. He exchanged friendly greetings, stepped back, sat to one side, and said, “Gotama, I would like to ask a question. Will you listen if I venture to express it?” The World-honored One said, “Brahmin, feel free to ask.” The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi then asked, “Gotama, what is suffering for one who lives at home? What is suffering for one who has gone forth to train in the path?” The World-honored One replied, “Brahmin, for one who lives at home, constraint is suffering; for one who has gone forth to train in the path, lack of constraint is suffering.” The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked further, “Gotama, why is constraint suffering for one who lives at home? Why is lack of constraint suffering for one who has gone forth to train in the path?” The World-honored One replied: Brahmin, for one who lives at home, if money does not increase, [if] gold, silver, pearl, beryl, and crystal all do not increase; [if] livestock, grain, and male and female servants do not increase, then at such a time there

is sorrow and suffering, worry and woe in the home. For this reason one living at home has much sorrow and suffering, harbors much worry and woe. Brahmin, for one who has gone forth to train in the path, if they act under the influence of sensual desire, act under the influence of ill will and delusion, then at such a time there is sorrow and suffering, worry and woe in having gone forth to train in the path. For this reason one who has gone forth to train in the path has much sorrow and suffering, harbors much worry and woe. In this way, brahmin, for one who lives at home constraint is suffering; for one who has gone forth to train in the path lack of constraint is suffering. The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked further, “Gotama, what is happiness for one who lives at home? What is happiness for one who has gone forth to train in the path?” The World-honored One replied, “Brahmin, for one who lives at home lack of constraint is happiness; for one who has gone forth to train in the path constraint is happiness.” The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked further, “Gotama, why is lack of constraint happiness for one who lives at home? Why is constraint happiness for one who has gone forth to train in the path?” The World-honored One replied: Brahmin, for one who lives at home, if money increases, [if] gold, silver, pearl, beryl, and crystal all increase; [if] livestock, grain, and male and female servants increase, then at such a time there is joy and delight in the home. For this reason one living at home has much joy and delight. Brahmin, for one who has gone forth to train in the path, if they do not act under the influence of sensual desire, do not act under the influence of ill will and delusion, then at such a time there is joy and delight in having gone forth to train in the path. For this reason one gone forth to train in the path has much joy and delight. In this way, brahmin, for one who lives at home lack of constraint is happiness; for one who has gone forth to train in the path constraint is happiness. The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked further:

Gotama, what kind of activity is certain to be of no benefit to _deva_ s and human beings? What kind of activity is certain to be of benefit to _deva_ s and human beings?

The World-honored One replied:

Brahmin, when _deva_ s and human beings quarrel with one another, this is certain to be of no benefit to them. When _deva_ s and human beings do not quarrel with one another, this is certain to be of benefit to them.

The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked further:

Gotama, why is it certain to be of no benefit to _deva_ s and human beings to quarrel with one another? Why is it certain to be of benefit to _deva_ s and human beings not to quarrel with one another?

The World-honored One replied:

Brahmin, if _deva_ s and human beings quarrel and detest one another, then at such a time there is sorrow and suffering, worry and woe for _deva_ s and human beings. For this reason _deva_ s and human beings have much sorrow and suffering, harbor much worry and woe. Brahmin, if _deva_ s and human beings do not quarrel and do not detest one another, then at such a time there is joy and delight for _deva_ s and human beings. For this reason _deva_ s and human beings have much joy and delight. In this way, brahmin, when _deva_ s and human beings quarrel with one another, this is certain to be of no benefit to them; but when _deva_ s and human beings do not quarrel with one another, this is certain to be of benefit to them.

The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked further:

Gotama, what kind of activity is certain not to lead to the flourishing of _deva_ s and human beings, certain to lead to their suffering? What kind of activity is certain to lead to the flourishing of _deva_ s and human beings, and certain to lead to their happiness?

The World-honored One replied:

Brahmin, when _deva_ s and human beings engage in acts that are contrary to the Dharma, acts that are evil, this is certain not to lead to their flour- ishing, certain to lead to their suffering. When _deva_ s and human beings are able to engage in acts that are in accordance with the Dharma, acts that are not evil, this is certain to lead to their flourishing, and certain to lead to their happiness. The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked further: Gotama, why are acts that are contrary to the Dharma, acts that are evil, certain not to lead to the flourishing of _deva_ s and human beings, certain to lead to their suffering? Why are acts that are in accordance with the Dharma, acts that are not evil, certain to lead to the flourishing of _deva_ s and human beings, and certain to lead to their happiness? The World-honored One replied: Brahmin, when _deva_ s and human beings engage in bodily acts that are con- trary to the Dharma, acts that are evil... verbal acts... mental acts that are contrary to the Dharma, acts that are evil; at that time _deva_ s and human beings are certain to become diminished, [while] the _asura_ s are certain to prosper. Brahmin, when _deva_ s and human beings engage in bodily acts that are in accordance with the Dharma, when they guard the body... vocal acts... mental acts, acts that are in accordance with the Dharma, when they guard their speech and mind, at that time _deva_ s and human beings are certain to prosper, [while] the _asura_ s are certain to decline. In this way, brahmin, when _deva_ s and human beings engage in acts that are contrary to the Dharma, acts that are evil, this is certain not to lead to their flourishing, certain to lead to their suffering. Brahmin, when _deva_ s and human beings are able to engage in acts that are in accordance with the Dharma, acts that are not evil, this is certain to lead to their flour- ishing, and certain to lead to their happiness. The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked further, “Gotama, how should one look upon a bad friend?” The World-honored One replied, “Brahmin, one should look upon a bad friend as similar to the [waning] moon.”

The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked further, “Gotama, how should one look upon a bad friend as similar to the [waning] moon?” The World-honored One replied: Brahmin, [a bad friend] is just like the waning moon, decreasing a little day by day. The moon-palace also decreases, its brightness also decreases, its shape also decreases day by day [until] it is gone. Brahmin, there comes a time when the moon has reached extinction and is not visible anymore. Brahmin, persons who have a bad friend, gain such faith in the Tathā- gata’s true Dharma and discipline. Then, having gained faith, at a later time they no longer have devotion, no longer have respect. Their practice becomes inappropriate. They do not establish right comprehension and do not progress in the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma. They lose their faith, and then they also lose their keeping of the precepts, their wide learn- ing, their generosity, and their wisdom. Brahmin, there comes a time when, being instructed by this bad friend, their wholesome states entirely cease to exist, just like the disappearance of the [waning] moon. Brahmin, this is how one should look upon a bad friend as similar to the [waning] moon. The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked further, “Gotama, how should one look upon a good friend?” The World-honored One replied, “Brahmin, one should look upon a good friend as similar to the [waxing] moon.” The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked further, “Gotama, how should one look upon a good friend as similar to the [waxing] moon?” The World-honored One replied: Brahmin, a good friend is just like the [waxing] moon, whose brightness is at first weak but increases day by day. Brahmin, there comes a time, on the fifteenth day of the month, when the moon-palace is full and complete. In the same way, brahmin, persons who have a good friend gain faith in the Tathāgata’s true Dharma and discipline. Having gained faith, at a later time they have devotion and respect. Their practice is appropriate. They establish right comprehension and they progress in the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma. They increase their faith, and they also increase their keeping of the precepts, their wide learning, their generosity,

and their wisdom. Brahmin, there comes a time when, being endowed with a good friend, their wholesome states come to completion, just like the moon on the fifteenth day. Brahmin, this is how one should look upon a good friend as similar to the moon. Then the World-honored One said these verses:^156 It is just as the stainless moon, Moving through empty space, Which outshines all constellations in the world With its bright radiance. In the same way [those who have] faith and wide learning, And generosity free from stinginess and greed Outshine all stinginess in the world With the bright radiance of their giving. They are like a great _nāga_ Which raises clouds, thunder, and lightning, And pours down rain abundantly So that the whole earth is drenched. In the same way, [those who have] faith, wide learning, And generosity free of stinginess and greed Give food and drink plentifully And delight in urging [others] to increase their giving. In this way, like the strongest thunder When the _deva_ s send down timely rain, Such is the wide and heavy rain of merit That is rained down by this donor. Wealthy and with much fame, They shall be reborn in a good realm. They shall receive the reward for their merit After death by being reborn in heaven. Thus said the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi was delighted and received it respectfully.
