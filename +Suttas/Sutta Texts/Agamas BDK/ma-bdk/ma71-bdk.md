### 71. The Discourse to Pāyāsi

Thus have I heard: At one time Venerable Kumāra Kassapa was staying in the country of Kosala. Together with a large company of monks he approached Setavyā, and stayed to the north of the village in a rosewood grove. At that time in Setavyā there was a king named Pāyāsi, who was extremely rich, possessing limitless wealth and countless livestock and prop- erty, endowed with various feudatories and manors. The manors, springs, ponds, grass, and trees in Setavyā all belonged to the king, having been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala. Then the brahmins and householders in Setavyā heard this: A renunciant named Kumāra Kassapa is dwelling in the country of Kosala together with a large company of monks; he has arrived in Setavyā and is staying to the north of the village in the Rosewood Grove. The renunciant Kumāra Kassapa has a great reputation, is well known in all the ten directions. [Thus they thought:] Kumāra Kassapa has unhindered eloquence and what he says is subtle. He is a learned arahant. Those who visit this arahant, pay respect to him, and serve him respectfully quickly gain good benefits. Let us go and see the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa! [So] the people of Setavyā, walking in groups, brahmins with brahmins, householders with householders, went together out of Setavyā toward the north, heading for the Rosewood Grove.

At that time King Pāyāsi, who was in his main hall, saw in the distance the people of Setavyā, walking in groups, brahmins with brahmins, house holders with householders, going together out of Setavyā toward the north, heading for the Rosewood Grove. Seeing this, King Pāyāsi said to an atten dant: Why are the people of Setavyā, walking in groups, brahmins with brah mins, householders with householders, going together out of Setavyā today toward the north, heading for the Rosewood Grove? The attendant said: Your majesty, those brahmins and householders in Setavyā have heard this: A renunciant named Kumāra Kassapa is dwelling in the country of Kosala together with a large company of monks; he has arrived in Setavyā and is staying to the north of the village in the Rosewood Grove. Your majesty, the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa has a great reputation, being well known widely in the ten directions. [Thus they thought]: Kumāra Kassapa has unhindered eloquence and what he says is subtle. He is a learned arahant. If one sees this arahant, pays respect to him and serves him respectfully, one will quickly gain good benefits. Let us go and see the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa! For this reason, your majesty, the people of Setavyā, walking in groups, brahmins with brahmins, householders with householders, are going together out of Setavyā toward the north, heading for the Rosewood Grove. Hearing this, King Pāyāsi told the attendant: Go to the brahmins and householders of Setavyā and tell them: King Pāyāsi tells the brahmins and householders of Setavyā: Please wait, friends. Let me go with you to see the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa. You are foolish. Do not be deceived by him

[into believing that] there are future lives, [that] beings are reborn. I hold this view, this tenet: “There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.” Following the king’s instructions, the attendant approached the brahmins and householders of Setavyā and said to them:

King Pāyāsi tells the brahmins and householders of Setavyā: Please wait, friends. Let me go with you to see the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa. You are foolish. Do not be deceived by him [into believing that] there are future lives, that beings are reborn. I hold this view, this tenet: “There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.” Having heard this message, the brahmins and householders of Setavyā replied to the attendant: “We shall wait as commanded.” The attendant returned and reported: “I have delivered your command.^182 The brahmins and householders of Setavyā await your majesty. May your majesty know the right time.” Then King Pāyāsi commanded a charioteer: “Prepare a chariot imme- diately. I wish to go now.” Following the king’s instruction, the charioteer immediately prepared a chariot and returned to tell the king: “The chariot is ready. It is at your majesty’s disposal.” Then King Pāyāsi boarded the chariot and departed. Approaching the brahmins and householders of Setavyā, he went with them to the Rosewood Grove. Then, on seeing in the distance the venerable Kumāra Kassapa among the trees in the grove, King Pāyāsi alighted from the chariot and proceeded on foot toward the venerable Kumāra Kassapa. After having exchanged greetings with Venerable Kumāra Kassapa, he sat down to one side and asked: “Kassapa, I now want to ask a question. Would you listen?” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said, “Pāyāsi, ask what you will. Having heard it, I will consider it.” So King Pāyāsi asked:

Kassapa, I hold this view, this tenet: “There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.” Renunciant Kumāra Kassapa, what do you think [of this]? Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said: Pāyāsi, I will now question you, king. Please reply as you see fit. What do you think, king? The present sun and moon, are they [only] in this life or [also in] future lives? Pāyāsi replied, “Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, still I hold this view, this tenet: ‘There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.’” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said, “Pāyāsi, have you another counter - argument beyond this?” Pāyāsi replied: Yes, Kassapa, I have another counterargument.^183 Kassapa, [once] some of my relatives were critically ill, so I went to their place. Having arrived there, I said: You should know that I hold this view, this tenet: “There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.” [But], relatives, some renun- ciants and brahmins hold this view, this tenet: “There are future lives; beings are reborn.” I have always disbelieved what they say. They say further: “If men or women perform evil deeds, if they are indolent, idle, negligent, jealous, stingy, greedy, closefisted, not virtuous, and strongly attached to property, then owing to these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they will certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell.” [Let us] suppose that what those renunciants and brahmins say is true. You, my relatives, have performed evil deeds, you have been indolent, idle, negligent, jealous, stingy, greedy, closefisted, not virtuous, and strongly attached to property. If, at the breaking up of the body, after death, you do [indeed] have to go to a bad realm of existence and are reborn in hell, then come back and tell me: “Pāyāsi, in hell the torments are thus and thus.” If that happens, then I will see it in the present.

They heard what I said, they received my instructions, yet none of them has come to tell me: “Pāyāsi, in hell the torments are thus and thus.” For this reason, Kassapa, I think: “There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.”

Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:

Pāyāsi, I will question you again. Please reply as you see fit. Suppose the king’s men arrest a criminal and bring him before the king, saying, “Your majesty, this man has committed a crime. The king should punish him.” The king tells them: Take him away. Bind his hands behind him and set him on a donkey. Beat a broken drum that makes a sound like a donkey’s braying. Having announced the sentence widely, lead him out through the southern gate, seat him beneath a tall signpost, and behead him. Following his instructions, the king’s men bind the criminal’s hands behind him and set him on a donkey. They beat a broken drum that makes a sound like a donkey’s braying. Having announced the sentence widely, they lead him out through the southern gate, seat him beneath a tall signpost, and are about to behead him. This man, on the point of death, says to the executioner, “Please wait a while. I wish to see my parents, wife and children, my male and female servants and messen gers. Let me go temporarily.” What do you think, king? Would the executioner release the criminal and let him go temporarily?

Pāyāsi replied, “No, Kassapa.” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:

Pāyāsi, such is also the case with your relatives who had performed evil deeds, who had been indolent, idle, negligent, jealous, stingy, greedy, closefisted, not virtuous, and strongly attached to property, and who, owing to these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, certainly went to a bad realm of existence and were reborn in hell.

When the wardens of hell caught them and tortured them, [suppose that] they told the wardens of hell: Wardens of hell, please wait a while and stop torturing me. I wish to go temporarily and visit King Pāyāsi to tell him: “In hell the torments are thus and thus,” so that he can see it in the present. What do you think, king? Would the wardens of hell release your rel atives and let them come [back] temporarily? Pāyāsi replied, “No, Kassapa.” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said: Pāyāsi, you should contemplate future lives in this way, since you cannot see them with your physical eyes. Pāyāsi, if a renunciant or a brahmin cuts off and abandons desire, inclines toward abandoning desire; if he cuts off and abandons hatred, inclines towards abandoning hatred; if he cuts off and abandons delu sion, inclines towards abandoning delusion—then with the purified divine eye, which surpasses human [vision], he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly, excellent or not excellent, as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their [previous] deeds. He sees this as it really is. King Pāyāsi again said, “Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold this view, this tenet: ‘There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.’” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said: “Pāyāsi, have you another counter argument beyond this?” Pāyāsi replied: Yes, Kassapa, I have another counterargument. Kassapa, [once] some of my relatives were critically ill, so I went to their place. Having arrived there, I said: You should know that I hold this view, this tenet: “There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.” [But,] relatives, some renun ciants and brahmins hold this view, this tenet: “There are future

lives; beings are reborn.” I have always disbelieved what they say. They say further, “If men or women perform good deeds, if they are energetic, diligent, not negligent, not jealous, not stingy, not greedy, openhanded, virtuous; if they generously renounce [their wealth] and give it to orphans and the poor, always enjoy practicing charity, and are not attached to property—then owing to these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they will certainly ascend to a good realm of existence, and be reborn in a heavenly realm.” Let us suppose that what those renunciants and brahmins say is true. You, my relatives, have performed good deeds, you are energetic, diligent, not negligent, not jealous, not stingy or greedy, openhanded, virtuous; you have generously renounced [your wealth] and given it to orphans and the poor, you have always enjoyed practicing charity, and you are not attached to property. If, at the breaking up of the body, after death, you do [indeed] ascend to a good realm of existence and are reborn in heaven, then come back and tell me, “Pāyāsi, in heaven the pleasures are thus and thus.” If that happens, I will see it in the present. They heard what I said, they received my instructions, yet none of them has ever come to tell me, “Pāyāsi, in heaven the pleasures are thus and thus.” For this reason, Kassapa, I think: “There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.”

Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:

Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you a parable. The wise, on hearing a parable, understand its implication. Suppose, Pāyāsi, that outside a village or a town there is a cesspit full of feces, so deep that a man could be sub merged in it up to his head. A man has fallen into this cesspit and sunk to the bottom. Suppose that another man, pitying him, seeking his pros perity, benefit, peace, and happiness, pulls him gently from the cesspit, wipes him down with a slice of bamboo, brushes him with leaves, and bathes him with warm water.

Later on, after [the first man] has been cleaned and bathed, perfume is applied to his body. He ascends to the main hall, and is entertained with the pleasures of the five senses. What do you think, king? Would that man enjoy recalling that cesspit, delight in praising it, and wish to revisit it? Pāyāsi replied: No, Kassapa. If someone else were to recall that cesspit [to him], delight in praising it, and wish [him] to revisit it, then he would not love this person. How much less would he himself recall that cesspit, delight in praising it, and wish to see it again! This is not possible. [Venerable Kumāra Kassapa continued:] Pāyāsi, if your relatives performed good deeds, if they were energetic, diligent, not negligent, not jealous, not stingy or greedy, openhanded, virtuous; if they generously renounced [their wealth] and gave it to orphans and the poor, always enjoyed practicing charity, and were not attached to property—then owing to these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they certainly ascended to a good realm of existence, were reborn in a heavenly realm. Having been reborn in heaven, they would entertain themselves with the heavenly pleasures of the five senses. What do you think, king? Would those gods in heaven give up the heavenly pleasures of the five senses and, recalling the pleasures of the five senses in this human realm, delight in praising them, and wish to revisit them? Pāyāsi replied: No, Kassapa. Why is that? The pleasures of the five senses of this human realm are putrid, unclean, utterly abhorrent, unattractive, unde sirable, coarse, and impure. Kassapa, compared with the pleasures of the five senses in this human realm, heavenly sensual pleasures are the utmost, the supreme, the best, the most wonderful and excellent. It cannot be that a god in heaven would give up the heavenly pleasures of the five senses, recall the pleasures of the five senses in this human realm, delight in praising them, and wish to see them again.

[Venerable Kumāra Kassapa continued:] Pāyāsi, you should contemplate future lives in this way, since you cannot see them with your physical eyes. Pāyāsi, if a renunciant or a brahmin cuts off and abandons desire, inclines toward abandoning desire; if he cuts off and abandons hatred, inclines toward abandoning hatred; if he cuts off and abandons delusion, inclines toward abandoning delusion—then with the purified divine eye, which surpasses human [vision], he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly, excellent or not excellent, as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their [previous] deeds. He sees this as it really is. King Pāyāsi again said, “Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold this view, this tenet: ‘There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.’” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said, “Pāyāsi, have you another counterar- gument beyond this?” Pāyāsi replied: Yes, Kassapa, I have another counterargument. Kassapa, [once] some of my relatives were critically ill, so I went to their place. Having arrived there, I said: You should know that I hold this view, this tenet: “There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.” [But], relatives, some renun- ciants and brahmins hold this view, this tenet: “There are future lives; beings are reborn.” I have always disbelieved what they say. [But] they say further: “If men or women perform good deeds, if they are energetic, diligent, not negligent, not jealous, not stingy, not greedy, openhanded, virtuous; if they generously renounce [their wealth] and give it to orphans and the poor, always enjoy practicing charity, and are not attached to property—then owing to these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they will certainly ascend to a good realm of existence, and be reborn in a heavenly realm.”

Let us suppose that what those renunciants and brahmins say is true. You, my relatives, have performed good deeds, you are energetic, diligent, not negligent, not jealous, not stingy or greedy, openhanded, virtuous; you have generously renounced [your wealth] and given it to orphans and the poor, you have always enjoyed practicing charity, and you are not attached to property. If, at the breaking up of the body, after death, you do [indeed] go to a good realm of existence and are reborn in heaven, then come back and tell me: “Pāyāsi, in heaven the pleasures are thus and thus.” In heaven you might think thus: “What shall I gain by going back?” [However,] in King Pāyāsi’s household there is much wealth. I will give [some] to you. They heard what I said, they received my instructions, yet none of them has ever come to tell me, “Pāyāsi, in heaven the pleasures are thus and thus.” For this reason, Kassapa, I think: “There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said: Pāyāsi, the life span in heaven is long, while the life span in the human realm is short. What is a hundred years for human beings is one day and night for the thirty-three gods. Thirty such days and nights make a month, twelve such months make a year, and a thousand such years are the heavenly life span of the thirty-three gods. What do you think, king? If your relatives performed good deeds, if they were energetic, diligent, not negligent, not jealous, not stingy, not greedy, openhanded, virtuous; if they generously renounced [their wealth] and gave it to orphans and the poor, always enjoyed practicing charity, and were not attached to property—then owing to these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they certainly ascended to a good realm of existence, were reborn in a heavenly realm. Having been reborn in heaven, they might think: We should first entertain ourselves with the heavenly pleasures of the five senses for one day and night, or entertain ourselves with

the heavenly pleasures of the five senses for two, three, four, or even six or seven days. After that we shall go to tell King Pāyāsi that the pleasures in heaven are thus and thus. What do you think, king? Would you be still alive [when they came back]?

Pāyāsi asked:

Kassapa, who has come back from his afterlife to tell you: “Renunciant Kumāra Kassapa, the life span in heaven is long, while the life span in the human realm is short. What is a hundred years for human beings is one day and night for the thirty-three gods. Thirty such days and nights make a month, twelve such months make a year, and a thousand such years are the heavenly life span of the thirty-three gods”?

Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:

Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you a parable. The wise, on hearing a parable, understand its implication. Suppose, Pāyāsi, that a blind man were to say this: There are no black or white objects, nor is there seeing of black or white objects. There are no long or short objects, nor is there seeing of long or short objects. There are no near or far objects, nor is there seeing of near or far objects. There are no rough or smooth objects, nor is there seeing of rough or smooth objects. Why? There are no objects because from the beginning I have never seen or known them. [If] the blind man spoke like this, would it be true?

Pāyāsi replied:

No, Kassapa. Why is that? Kassapa, there are black and white objects, and also there is seeing of black and white objects. There are long and short objects, and also there is seeing of long and short objects. There are near and far objects, and also there is seeing of near and far objects. There are rough and smooth objects, and also there is seeing of rough and smooth objects. If the blind man were to say “There are no objects

because from the beginning I have never seen or known them,” then what he said would not be true. Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said: King Pāyāsi, you are also like a blind man if you say: Kassapa, who has come back from his afterlife to tell you: “Renun ciant Kumāra Kassapa, the life span in heaven is long, while the life span in the human realm is short. What is a hundred years for human beings is one day and night for the thirty-three gods. Thirty such days and nights make a month, twelve such months make a year, and a thousand such years are the heavenly life span of the thirty-three gods”? King Pāyāsi said: Renunciant Kumāra Kassapa, you certainly must not and should not speak so. Why is that? Renunciant Kumāra Kassapa, you go so far as to compare me to a blind man. Kassapa, assuming it was known to me or known to my relatives who performed good deeds, who were energetic, diligent, not negligent, not jealous, not stingy, not greedy, openhanded, virtuous; who generously renounced [their wealth] and gave it to orphans and the poor, always enjoyed practicing charity, and were not attached to property, that owing to these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they certainly would ascend to a good realm of existence, and be reborn in heaven—then, Kassapa, I would now practice charity, perform meritorious actions, observe the uposatha and the precepts, and then commit suicide by using a knife, or taking poison, or throwing [myself] into a hole or a well, or hanging myself. Renunciant Kumāra Kassapa, you should not go so far as to compare me to that blind man. Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said: Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you another parable. The wise, on hearing a parable, understand its implication.

Suppose, Pāyāsi, that a brahmin has a young wife who has just become pregnant, and that he already has a son by his former wife; and then in the midst of this that brahmin suddenly dies. After his death, the former wife’s son says to his stepmother, “Step- mother, you should know that all the property of this household should now belong to me. I see no one else anymore who should share in it.” The stepmother replies, “I am pregnant now. If I give birth to a boy, you should share with him. If I give birth to a girl, all the property belongs to you.” The former wife’s son says to his stepmother a second and a third time, “All the property of this household should now belong to me. I see no one else anymore who should share in it.” And the stepmother also replies a second and a third time, “I am pregnant now. If I give birth to a boy, you should share with him. If I give birth to a girl, all the property belongs to you.” Then the stepmother, being foolish, ignorant, of poor understanding, lacking wisdom, [though] desiring to protect her life, on the contrary harms herself. She enters an inner room, takes a sharp knife and cuts open her belly, to see whether it is a boy or a girl. Being foolish, igno- rant, of poor understanding, lacking wisdom, [though] desiring to protect her life, she on the contrary harms herself and the child in her belly. It should be known that Pāyāsi is likewise foolish, ignorant, of poor understanding, lacking wisdom, in that [though] desiring to protect his life, he on the contrary thinks like this:

Kassapa, if it were known to me or known to my relatives who performed good deeds, who were energetic, diligent, not negligent, not jealous, not stingy, not greedy, openhanded, virtuous; who generously renounced [their wealth] and gave it to orphans and the poor, always enjoyed practicing charity, and were not attached to property, that owing to these causes and conditions, at the break ing up of the body, after death, they certainly would ascend to a good realm of existence, and be reborn in heaven—then, Kassapa, I would now practice charity, perform meritorious actions, observe

the uposatha and the precepts, and then commit suicide by using a knife, or taking poison, or throwing [myself] into a hole or a well, or hanging myself. [And Pāyāsi also says:] “Renunciant Kumāra Kassapa, you should not go so far as to compare me to that blind man.” Pāyāsi, if an energetic man lives long, he will acquire great merit. If he acquires great merit, he will be reborn in heaven and enjoy longevity. Pāyāsi, you should contemplate future lives thus, [since you] cannot see them with your physical eyes: Pāyāsi, if a renunciant or a brahmin cuts off and abandons desire, inclines toward abandoning desire; if he cuts off and abandons hatred, inclines toward abandoning hatred; if he cuts off and abandons delusion, inclines toward abandoning delusion—then with the purified divine eye, which surpasses human [vision], he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly, excellent or not excellent, as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their [previous] deeds. He sees this as it really is. King Pāyāsi again said, “Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold this view, this tenet: ‘There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.’” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said, “Pāyāsi, have you another counterar gument beyond this?” Pāyāsi replied: Yes, Kassapa, I have another counterargument. Kassapa, [once] some of my relatives were critically ill. I went to their place to visit and greet them, and they also visited and greeted me. When they died, I visited and greeted them again, but they did not visit and greet me again; so I also do not visit and greet them. Kassapa, for this reason I think, “Beings are not reborn.” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said: Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you another parable. The wise, on hearing a parable, understand its implication.

Suppose, Pāyāsi, there is a skilled conch-blower. He goes to a place where nobody has ever heard the sound of a conch. He mounts a high hill on a dark night, and with all his might he blows the conch. Because the people there have never heard the sound of a conch, on hearing it, they think, “What is this sound that is so wonderful, very extraordinary, truly delightful, pleasant to the ear, and gladdening to the heart?” Then that crowd together approaches the skilled conch-blower. Having arrived, they ask: “What is this sound that is so wonderful, very extraordinary, truly delightful, pleasant to the ear, and gladdening to the heart?” The skilled conch-blower puts the conch down on the ground and tells the crowd: “Sirs, you should know that it is the sound of this conch.” Thereupon, the people kick the conch, saying, “Make a sound, conch! Make a sound, conch!” But it is silent, producing no sound. The skilled conch-blower thinks: Now, these people are foolish, ignorant, poor in understanding, lacking wisdom. Why so? They seek to get sound from a senseless object.

Then the skilled conch-blower takes the conch, washes it with water, raises it to his mouth, and blows it with all his might. Hearing it, the people in the crowd think:

The conch is marvelous! Why so? Because by means of hands, water, and the blowing of wind from the mouth it produces a fine sound that pervades the four directions.

In the same way, Pāyāsi, if a man is still alive, he can talk with and greet others. [But] when he is dead, he can no longer talk with or greet others. Pāyāsi, you should contemplate the rebirth of beings thus, [since you] cannot see it with your physical eyes. Pāyāsi, if a renunciant or a brahmin cuts off and abandons desire, inclines toward abandoning desire; if he cuts off and abandons hatred, inclines toward abandoning

hatred; if he cuts off and abandons delusion, inclines toward abandoning delusion—then with the purified divine eye, which surpasses human [vision], he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly, excellent or not excellent, as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their [previous] deeds. He sees this as it really is. King Pāyāsi again said, “Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold this view, this tenet: ‘Beings are not reborn.’” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said, “Pāyāsi, have you another counterar gument beyond this?” Pāyāsi replied: Yes, Kassapa, I have another counterargument. Kassapa, [once] my officers arrested a criminal and brought him before me. Having arrived, they said, “Your majesty, this man has committed a crime. May your majesty punish him!” I told them: Take this criminal away and weigh him on the scales alive. After having weighed him alive, put him down on the ground and stran gle him with a rope. Having killed him, weigh him again. I want to know when this man is light, soft, and has a lustrous appearance: when he is dead or when he is alive. Following my instructions, they took this criminal away and weighed him on the scales alive. Having done so, they put him down on the ground and strangled him with a rope. Having killed him, they weighed him again. When the criminal was alive, he was very light and soft, with lustrous appearance. When dead, his skin became thick and he became heavy, stiff, not soft, and lost his lustrous appearance. For this reason, Kassapa, I think, “Beings are not reborn.” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said: Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you another parable. The wise, on hearing a parable, understand its implication. Suppose, Pāyāsi, that an iron ball or an iron ploughshare has been heated by fire all day. At that time, it is very light and soft, with

a lustrous appearance. [But] once the fire is extinguished, it gradually cools down, becomes solid, thick, and heavy, and becomes stiff, not soft, and loses its lustrous appearance. In the same way, Pāyāsi, if a man is alive, his body is very light and soft, with lustrous appearance. [But] once he is dead, he becomes thick, heavy, stiff, not soft, and loses his lustrous appearance. Pāyāsi, you should contemplate the rebirth of beings thus, [since you] cannot see it with your physical eyes. Pāyāsi, if a renunciant or a brahmin cuts off and abandons desire, inclines toward abandoning desire; if he cuts off and abandons hatred, inclines toward abandoning hatred; if he cuts off and abandons delusion, inclines toward abandoning delusion—then with the purified divine eye, which surpasses human [vision], he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly, excellent or not excellent, as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their [previous] deeds. He sees this as it really is. King Pāyāsi again said, “Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold this view, this tenet: ‘Beings are not reborn.’” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said, “Pāyāsi, have you another counterar- gument beyond this?” Pāyāsi replied: Yes, Kassapa, I have another counterargument. Kassapa, [once] my officers arrested a criminal and brought him before me. Having arrived, they said, “Your majesty, this man has com- mitted a crime. May your majesty punish him!” I told them: Take this criminal and put him head downward into an iron caul- dron or a copper cauldron. Seal its mouth and light a fire underneath it. Having lit the fire, watch to see [if any] being enters or leaves, comes or goes, or moves around. Following my instructions, they took this criminal away and put him head downward into an iron cauldron or a copper cauldron. They sealed its mouth and lit a fire underneath it. Having lit the fire, they watched to see [if any] being entered or left, came or went, or moved around.

Kassapa, by such means I saw no rebirth of any being. For this reason, Kassapa, I think: “Beings are not reborn.” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said: Pāyāsi, I will question you now. Please reply as you see fit. What do you think? Do you recall that, while taking the noontide rest on your bed [after having] eaten excellent, delicious food, you saw in a dream pleasure parks, bathing pools, groves, flowers, fruits, clear springs, and long streams, and saw yourself taking recreation there, moving around, coming and going to your heart’s content? Pāyāsi replied, “Yes, I do recall so.” Kassapa asked further, “While you were taking the noontide rest on your bed [after having] eaten excellent, delicious food, were any attendants present?” He replied, “Yes.” Kassapa asked further: While you were taking the noontide rest on your bed [after having] eaten excellent, delicious food, at that time did the attendants to [your] left and right see you entering or leaving, moving around, or coming and going? Pāyāsi replied, “How could even the most remarkable individual see this, let alone the attendants to [my] left and right?” [Kassapa said:] Pāyāsi, you should contemplate the rebirth of beings thus, [since you] cannot see it with your physical eyes. Pāyāsi, if a renunciant or a brah- min cuts off and abandons desire, inclines toward abandoning desire; if he cuts off and abandons hatred, inclines toward abandoning hatred; if he cuts off and abandons delusion, inclines toward abandoning delu- sion—then with the purified divine eye, which surpasses human [vision], he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly, excellent or not excellent, as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their [previous] deeds. He sees this as it really is.

King Pāyāsi again said, “Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold this view, this tenet: ‘Beings are not reborn.’” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said, “Pāyāsi, have you another counterar- gument beyond this?” Pāyāsi replied: Yes, Kassapa, I have another counterargument. Kassapa, [once] my officers arrested a criminal and brought him before me. Having arrived, they said, “Your majesty, this man has committed a crime. May your majesty punish him!” I told them: Take this criminal away. Peel off his skin and tear off his flesh. Cut off his sinews and break his bones to the marrow. Search for the being to be reborn. Following my instructions, they took this criminal away, peeled off his skin, tore off his flesh, cut off his sinews, and broke his bones to the mar- row, searching for the being to be reborn. Kassapa, I used such means to search for the being to be reborn, but in the end I could not see any being to be reborn. For this reason, Kassapa, I think: “Beings are not reborn.” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said: Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you another parable. The wise, on hearing a parable, understand its implication. Suppose, Pāyāsi, that a fire-worshiping matted-hair brahmin is living near a road. Some merchants stay the night at a place not far away from him. Then, when the night has passed and dawn has broken, the merchants set out hastily, forgetfully leaving behind a small child. Then the fire-worshiping matted-hair brahmin, having risen early, looks around the place where the merchants stayed and sees the small child left alone without an owner. Seeing it, he thinks, “This small child has nobody to depend on. He will definitely die unless I support him.” So he carries the small child away, returns to his own place, and rears him. The small child grows up, endowed with all his faculties. Then the fire-worshiping matted-hair brahmin has some small matter for which he has to go among the people. The fire-worshiping matted-hair brahmin therefore instructs the boy:

I have some small matter for which I have to go among the people for a while. You must feed the fire and be careful not to let it go out. If it should go out, use these fire-sticks to make fire. Then, having instructed him well, the fire-worshiping matted-hair brah min goes among the people. Later on the boy goes out to play, and the fire goes out. When he returns he tries to make fire. He takes the fire-sticks and hits them on the ground, saying, “Come out, fire! Come out, fire!” But no fire comes out. He exerts more effort, hitting it on a stone, [saying,] “Come out, fire! Come out, fire!” But still no fire comes out. As no fire comes out, he breaks the fire-sticks into ten and even a hundred pieces, throws them away, and sits down on the ground, anxiously saying, “I cannot get fire. What should I do?” Then the fire-worshiping matted-hair brahmin, having finished what he had to do among the people, returns to his own place. Having arrived, he asks, “Boy, did you look after the fire without playing and not let it go out?” The boy said: Venerable sir, I went out to play, and the fire went out. When I returned, I tried to make fire. I took the fire-sticks and hit them on the ground, saying: “Come out, fire! Come out, fire!” But no fire came out. I exerted more effort, hitting them on a stone, [saying,] “Come out, fire! Come out, fire!” But still no fire came out. As no fire came out, I broke the fire-sticks into ten and even a hundred pieces, threw them away and sat down on the ground. Venerable sir, I tried like this, but could not get fire. What should I have done? Then the fire-worshiping matted-hair brahmin thinks: This boy is foolish, ignorant, poor in understanding, and lacking wisdom. Why so? How else could one implore the non-intelligent fire-sticks [with words] to render fire? The fire-worshiping matted-hair brahmin then takes dry sticks to use as the upper and lower fire-sticks, places them on the ground and, by

rubbing, causes [sparks of] fire to come out, which gradually become flames. He tells the boy: Boy, this is how one should make fire. One should not be like you, foolish, ignorant, poor in understanding, lacking wisdom, and try to implore the non-intelligent fire-sticks to render fire. Pāyāsi, it should be known that you are likewise foolish, ignorant, poor in understanding, and lacking wisdom, searching in dead flesh and even in marrow for a being to be reborn. Pāyāsi, you should contemplate the rebirth of beings thus, [since you] cannot see it with your physical eyes. Pāyāsi, if a renunciant or a brahmin cuts off and abandons desire, inclines toward abandoning desire; if he cuts off and abandons hatred, inclines toward abandoning hatred; if he cuts off and abandons delusion, inclines toward abandoning delusion—then with the purified divine eye, which surpasses human [vision], he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly, excellent or not excellent, as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their [previous] deeds. He sees this as it really is.

King Pāyāsi again said:

Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold on to this view, out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it. Why is that? If other people in other countries heard of this, they would say, “King Pāyāsi held his view for a long time, but he has been refuted, defeated, and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa.” For this reason, Kassapa, I hold on to this view, out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it.

Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:

Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you a parable. The wise, on hearing a parable, understand its implication. Suppose, Pāyāsi, two friends leave home to make a living. On

their way, they first see a large amount of hemp without an owner. On seeing it, one of the men tells his companion: You should know that there is a large amount of hemp here without an owner. Let us take it, make up a heavy load for each of us, and carry it back home as our source of livelihood. So they carry off their heavy load. Further on, they see a large amount of cotton thread and cotton clothes without an owner. Further on again, they see a large amount of silver without an owner. On seeing it, one of them lays down his load of hemp, takes the silver, and loads himself up with it. Still further on they see a large amount of gold without an owner. Then the man loaded with silver tells the one loaded with hemp: Now, you should know that there is a great amount of gold here without an owner. You discard your hemp and I will discard my silver. I want you and me to take this gold and carry a heavy load of it home, as our source of livelihood. The man loaded with hemp tells the one loaded with silver: My load of hemp is fine. It is well packed and tied up, and I have carried it a long way. I cannot let go of it. You know what is fit for you. Don’t worry about me! At this the man loaded with silver grabs the load of hemp by force and throws it to the ground, damaging it. The one with the hemp tells the one with the silver: You have damaged my load. My load of hemp is well tied up, and I have carried it a long way. I want to carry this hemp back home myself. I will never let go of it. You know what is fit for you. Don’t worry about me! Then the man with the load of silver discards it, loads himself up heavily with gold, and heads back home. As this man loaded with gold approaches his home, his father and mother, seeing him in the distance coming back with a load of gold, exclaim:

Welcome, good son! Come quickly, good son! Thanks to this gold, you will make a good living, support your father and mother, and sustain your wife, children, your male and female servants, and messengers. Furthermore, you can make offerings to renunciants and brahmins, make merit and uplift [yourself], [experience] good fruits and good results, being reborn in heaven and enjoying longevity. [But when] the man loaded with hemp returns to his home, his father and mother, seeing him in the distance coming back with a load of hemp, reprove him saying: Here you come, criminal! Here you come, man without virtue! With this hemp you will not make a living, or support your father and mother, or sustain your wife, children, male and female ser vants, and messengers. Neither can you make offerings to renun ciants and brahmins, make merit and uplift [yourself], [experience] good fruits and good results, or be reborn in heaven and enjoy longevity. Pāyāsi, you should know that such is also the case with you. If you hold on to this view out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion, and do not let go of it, you will be subject to immeasurable misfortune and be abhorred by many people.

King Pāyāsi again said:

Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold on to this view, out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it. Why is that? If other people in other countries heard of this, they would say, “King Pāyāsi held his view for a long time, but he has been refuted, defeated, and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa.” For this reason, Kassapa, I hold on to this view, out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it.

Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:

Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you another parable. The wise, on hearing a parable, understand its implication.

Suppose, Pāyāsi, some merchants and a crowd of associates, with a thousand carts, are traveling on a road [through an area] of scarce provisions. The crowd has two leaders. They think: “How can we get out of this trouble?” They think further: “This crowd should be divided into two groups of five hundred carts each.” So those merchants divide into two groups of five hundred carts each. Then one leader of the merchants leads five hundred carts along the road [through the area] of scarce provisions. That merchant leader often goes ahead [by himself]. He sees a man coming from a side road with his clothes all wet, with dark body, yellow head, and two deep red eyes, wearing a garland of hibiscus flowers, and driving a donkey cart whose two wheels are splashed with mud. On seeing him, the mer chant leader asks, “Has it been raining on the road [through the area] of scarce provisions? Is there new water, firewood, and grass [ahead]?” That man replies: There has been a great deal of rain on the road [through the area] of scarce provisions. There is plenty of new water, firewood, and grass. Friend, throw away the water, firewood, and grass that you already have, so as not to tire your vehicles. You will find new water, good firewood, and grass before long. Hearing this, the merchant leader returns to the merchants and says: As I was going ahead, I saw a man coming from a side road with his clothes all wet, with dark body, yellow head, and two deep red eyes, wearing a garland of hibiscus flowers, and driving a donkey cart whose two wheels were splashed with mud. I asked him, “Has it been raining on the road [through the area] of scarce provisions? Is there new water, firewood, and grass [ahead]?” He replied to me, saying, “There has been a great deal of rain on the road [through the area] of scarce provisions. There is plenty of new water, fire wood, and grass. Friend, throw away the water, firewood, and grass that you already have, so as not to tire your vehicles. You will find new water, good firewood, and grass before long.” Merchants, let us throw away the water, firewood, and grass

that we already have. We will find new water, firewood, and grass before long. Let us not tire our vehicles!

So those merchants throw away the water, firewood, and grass that they already have. After one day’s journey, they find no new water, firewood, or grass. After two days... three days... even after seven days of travel, they still find no new water, firewood, or grass. After seven days have passed, they are killed by man-eating ghosts. The second merchant leader thinks, “The first merchant leader has crossed over the danger. By what means can we now overcome the hardships?” Having thought thus, the second merchant leader proceeds along the road [through the area] of scarce provisions together with the five hundred carts. The second merchant leader goes ahead by him- self. He sees a man coming from a side road with his clothes all wet, with dark body, yellow head, and two deep red eyes, wearing a garland of hibiscus flowers, and driving a donkey chart whose two wheels are splashed with mud. On seeing him, the second merchant leader asks, “Has it been rain- ing on the road [through the area] of scarce provisions? Are there new water, firewood, and grass [ahead]?” That man replies:

There has been a great deal of rain on the road [through the area] of scarce provisions. There is plenty of new water, firewood, and grass. Friend, throw away the water, firewood, and grass that you already have, so as not to tire your vehicles. You will find new water, good firewood, and grass before long.

Hearing this, the second merchant leader returns to the merchants and says:

While I was going ahead, I saw a man coming from a side road with his clothes all wet, with a dark body, yellow head, and two deep red eyes, wearing a garland of hibiscus flowers, and driving a donkey cart whose two wheels were splashed with mud. I asked him, “Has it been raining on the road [through the area] of scarce provisions? Are there new water, firewood, and grass [ahead]?”

He replied, “There has been a great deal of rain on the road [through the area] of scarce provisions. There is plenty of new water, firewood, and grass. Friend, throw away the water, firewood, and grass that you already have, so as not to tire your vehicles. You will find new water, good firewood, and grass before long.” [But,] merchants, we cannot throw away the water, firewood, or grass that we already have. We should throw them away only if we find new water, firewood, and grass. [So] they do not throw away the water, firewood, and grass that they already have. After one day’s journey, they find no new water, firewood, or grass. After two days... three days... even after seven days of travel, they still find no new water, firewood, or grass. While going ahead, the second merchant leader finds that the first merchant leader and his merchants have been killed by man-eating ghosts. Seeing this, the second merchant leader tells the merchants: You see! The first merchant leader was foolish, ignorant, poor in understanding, and lacking wisdom. He himself has been killed, and all his people too have been killed. Merchants, if you would like to take the belongings of the first group of merchants, do so at will! Pāyāsi, you should know that such is also the case with you. If you hold on to this view out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion, and do not let go of it, you will be subject to immeasurable misfortune and also be abhorred by many people, just like the first merchant leader and his merchants. King Pāyāsi said again: Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold on to this view, out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it. Why is that? If other people in other countries heard of this, they would say, “King Pāyāsi held his view for a long time, but he has been refuted, defeated, and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa.” For this reason, Kassapa, I hold on to this view, out of desire, aver sion, fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it.

Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:

Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you another parable. The wise, on hearing a parable, understand its implication. Suppose, Pāyāsi, that two men wanted to gamble with grains^184 [as tokens]. The first player [on losing] furtively eats the [extra] grains [that cause him to lose]: once, twice, three times, again and again. The second player thinks, “I am playing against this man, but he has cheated me many times, furtively eating the [extra] grains: once, twice, three times, again and again.” Seeing this, he tells his companion, “Now I want to rest. Let us resume the game later.” Thereupon the second player leaves that place and smears the grains with poison. Having smeared them, he returns and tells his companion, “Come and [resume] the game with me!” So he comes and they play together. Again the first player furtively eats the grains: once, twice, three times, again and again. Having eaten the grains, his eyes become vacant, he foams at the mouth, and is almost dying. Then the second player utters this verse to the first player: These grains are smeared with poison. You ate them greedily without noticing. You cheated me with the grains, That was bound to make you suffer! Pāyāsi, you should know that such is also the case with you. If you hold on to this view out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion, and do not let go of it, you will be subject to immeasurable misfortune and be abhorred by many people, just as the player who cheated the other out of grains brought disaster on himself.

King Pāyāsi again said:

Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold on to this view, out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it. Why is that? If other people in other countries heard of this, they would say “King Pāyāsi held his view for a long time, but he has been refuted, defeated, and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa.”

Therefore, Kassapa, I hold on to this view, out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it. Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said: Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you another parable. The wise, on hearing a parable, understand its implication. Suppose, Pāyāsi, a pig farmer, while walking along a road, sees a large amount of dry dung without an owner. He thinks, “This dung can feed many pigs. Let me take it, load myself up, and leave.” So he takes it and leaves. On the way he encounters heavy rain. The dung, dissolving and oozing, fouls his body, but he keeps on carrying it along, never dis carding it. Consequently he experiences immeasurable misfortune and is abhorred by many people. You should know, Pāyāsi, that such is also the case with you. If you hold on to this view out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion, and do not let go of it, you will experience immeasurable misfortune and be abhorred by many people, just like that pig farmer. King Pāyāsi again said: Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold on to this view, out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it. Why is that? If other people in other countries heard of this, they would say, “King Pāyāsi held his view for a long time, but he has been refuted, defeated, and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa.” Therefore, Kassapa, I hold on to this view, out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it. Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said: Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you one last parable. It will be good if you understand it. If not, I will not teach you the Dharma any more. Suppose, Pāyāsi, a large pig, the king of five hundred pigs, while walking along a dangerous road, encounters a tiger on the way. On seeing the tiger, the pig thinks:

If I fight with this tiger, he will definitely kill me. If I run away in fear, my kinsmen will slight me. By what means can I get out of this trouble?

Having thought thus, he tells the tiger, “If you want to fight, I can fight with you. If not, then let me pass.” Hearing this, the tiger tells the pig, “I allow you to fight with me. I will not let you pass.” The pig says further, “Tiger, wait a little, while I put on the armor of my grandfather’s time, and then I will return to fight.” Hearing this, the tiger thinks, “He is no match for me, let alone in the armor of his grandfather’s time.” So he tells the pig, “Do as you like!” Then the pig returns to his own cesspit and rolls around in feces, smearing his body with it up to the eyes. Then he goes to the tiger and says, “If you want to fight, I can fight with you. If not, let me pass.” On seeing the pig, the tiger thinks, “I never even eat food that has worms in it, in order to protect my teeth, so I certainly won’t get close to this foul pig.” Thinking thus, the tiger tells the pig, “I will let you pass rather than fight with you.” Having passed, the pig utters a verse to the tiger:

Tiger, you have four feet. I too have four feet. Come and fight with me! What do you fear that you walk away?

Then, on hearing this, the tiger also utters a verse in response to the pig:

Your bristles stand up like a dense forest, You lowest among animals! Go away, pig! Quickly! The stench of feces is unbearable.

Then the pig, boasting, utters another verse:

[Citizens of] the two countries of Magadha and Aṅga Will hear that I fought with you. Come and battle with me! What do you fear that you walk away?

Hearing this, the tiger uttered another verse: With all the bristles on your body fouled, Your stench chokes me, pig. If you want to fight for victory, I now concede you victory. Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said: Pāyāsi, such is also the case with you. If you hold on to this view out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion, and do not let go of it, you will be subject to immeasurable misfortune and be abhorred by many people, just as the tiger conceded victory to the pig. Having heard this, King Pāyāsi said: When the venerable one told the first parable, about the sun and the moon, I understood it on hearing it and joyfully received it with respect. However, I wanted to get further excellent and wise teachings from the venerable Kumāra Kassapa, and for this reason I asked you again and again. I now go for refuge to the venerable Kumāra Kassapa. Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said, “Pāyāsi, you should not go to me for refuge. I go to the Buddha for refuge. You too should go to him for refuge.” King Pāyāsi said: Venerable sir, I now go for refuge to the Buddha, the Dharma and the community of monks. May the venerable Kumāra Kassapa accept me, on behalf of the Buddha, as a lay follower. From this day forth I take refuge until the end of my life. Venerable Kumāra Kassapa, from this day forth I will practice charity and make merit. Venerable Kumāra Kassapa asked, “Pāyāsi, you want to practice charity and make merit, but how many people will you give to? And how long will it last?” King Pāyāsi said, “I will give to a hundred people or even a thousand people, for one day, two days, or even seven days.” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:

King, if you practice charity and make merit by giving to a hundred people or even a thousand people, for one day, two days, or even seven days, then renunciants and brahmins in the various directions will all hear that King Pāyāsi held on to his view for a long time, but has [now] been refuted, defeated, and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa. Hearing this, people in the various directions will all come from afar. But if within those seven days, some do not get to eat the food that the king gives in faith, then the king will make no merit and will not get to experience long-lasting happiness. Suppose, King Pāyāsi, [that there are] seeds that are neither broken nor spoiled, neither split nor damaged, not harmed by wind, sun, or water, and that have been stored away safely since the autumn; and suppose that a householder thoroughly ploughs a fertile field. Having thoroughly prepared the land, he sows the seeds at the appropriate time, but there is no timely rain or other supply of water. What do you think, Pāyāsi? Would those seeds germinate and grow?

He replied, “They would not.” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:

Pāyāsi, such is also the case with you if you practice charity to produce merit by giving to a hundred people, or even a thousand people, for one day, two days, or even seven days. Renunciants and brahmins in the various directions will all hear that King Pāyāsi held on to his view for a long time, but has [now] been refuted, defeated, and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa. Hearing this, people in the various directions will all come from afar. But if within those seven days, some do not get to eat the almsfood that the king gives in faith, then the king will make no merit and will not get to experience long-lasting happiness.

King Pāyāsi asked further, “Venerable sir, what should I do?” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa replied:

Pāyāsi, you should practice charity and make merit by providing alms food constantly. If, King Pāyāsi, you practice charity and make merit

by supplying almsfood constantly, then renunciants and brahmins in the various directions will all hear that King Pāyāsi held on to his view for a long time, but has [now] been refuted, defeated, and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa. Hearing this, people in the various directions will all come from afar, and will be able to receive the almsfood that the king gives in faith. Then the king will make merit and experience long-lasting happiness. Suppose, King Pāyāsi, [that there are] seeds that are neither broken nor spoiled, neither split nor damaged, not harmed by wind, sun, or water, and that were stored away safely in the autumn; and suppose that a householder thoroughly ploughs a fertile field. Having thoroughly prepared the land, he sows the seeds at the appropriate time, and there is timely rain or some other supply of water. What do you think, Pāyāsi? Would those seeds germinate and grow? He replied, “They would.” Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said: Pāyāsi, such is also the case with you. If you practice charity and make merit by providing almsfood constantly, then renunciants and brahmins in the various directions will all hear that King Pāyāsi held on to his view for a long time, but has [now] been refuted, defeated, and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa. Hearing this, people in the various directions will all come from afar, and all of them will be able to receive the almsfood that the king gives in faith. Then the king will make merit and experience long-lasting happiness. Thereupon King Pāyāsi said, “Venerable sir, from now on I will practice charity and make merit by providing almsfood constantly.” Then with innumerable skillful means, Venerable Kumāra Kassapa taught the Dharma to King Pāyāsi and to the brahmins and householders of Setavyā, exhorting, encouraging, and delighting them. Having with innumerable skillful means taught them the Dharma, having exhorted, encouraged, and delighted them, he remained silent. Then, after Venerable Kumāra Kassapa had taught the Dharma to King Pāyāsi and the brahmins and householders of Setavyā, exhorting, encouraging,

and delighting them, they got up from their seats, paid homage to Venerable Kumāra Kassapa, circumambulated him three times, and departed. Although King Pāyāsi practiced charity and made merit, [the almsfood included] very bad, coarse, and inferior bean gruel and vegetables, and only one piece of ginger. He also gave coarse and inferior robes. The kitchen supervisor at that time was named Uttara. While practicing charity to produce merit on behalf of King Pāyāsi he asked some elder monks to make this aspi- ration: “If this charity brings retribution for merit, let King Pāyāsi not expe- rience it either in this life or the next.” King Pāyāsi heard that Uttara, while practicing charity and making merit, always asked some elder monks to make this aspiration: “If this charity brings retribution for merit, let King Pāyāsi not experience it either in this life or the next.” Having heard this, he sent for him and asked:

Uttara, is it true that while practicing charity to make merit on my behalf you ask elder monks to make this aspiration, “If this charity brings retribution for merit, let King Pāyāsi not experience it either in this life or the next”? Uttara replied: Yes, your majesty. Why is that? Although your majesty practices charity and makes merit, [the alms include] very bad, coarse, and inferior bean gruel, vegetables, and only one piece of ginger. Your majesty, such food cannot even be touched by hands, much less eaten. [Also] your majesty gives coarse and inferior robes. Your majesty, such robes cannot even be stepped on with one’s feet, much less worn. I respect your majesty rather than what is given. Therefore, your majesty, I do not wish your majesty to experience the retribution for such inferior alms. On hearing this, King Pāyāsi said, “Uttara, from now on you should pro- vide food such as I eat and give robes such as I wear.” So, from then on Uttara provided food such as the king ate and gave robes such as the king wore. Then, because of his supervising the practice of charity for King Pāyāsi, Uttara was reborn at the breaking up of the body, after death, among the four divine kings. King Pāyāsi, for his practice of charity without sincerity, was

reborn at the breaking up of the body, after death, in the empty palace of the Acacia Grove. Venerable Gavampati often wandered near the empty palace of the Acacia Grove. Venerable Gavampati saw King Pāyāsi in the distance and asked, “Who are you?” King Pāyāsi replied, “Venerable Gavampati, have you ever heard that in the continent of Jambudīpa there was a king of Setavyā named Pāyāsi?” Venerable Gavampati replied, “I have heard that in the continent of Jam budīpa there was a king of Setavyā named Pāyāsi.” King Pāyāsi said, “Venerable Gavampati, I was he, originally named Pāyāsi.” Venerable Gavampati asked further: King Pāyāsi held to this view, this tenet: “There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.” For what reason was he reborn here in the little empty palace of the Acacia Grove dependent on the four divine kings? King Pāyāsi said: Venerable Gavampati, I did indeed hold this view, but I had been refuted, defeated, and made to abandon it by the venerable renunciant Kumāra Kassapa. If, Venerable Gavampati, you return to the continent of Jam budīpa, please tell the people in the continent of Jambudīpa that when practicing charity to make merit, they should give with sincerity, give with their own hands, give having gone there themselves, give with steadfast faith, give with understanding of deeds and the results of deeds. Why? So that they may not experience the results of [malpracticed] charity, in the manner of King Pāyāsi of Setavyā. King Pāyāsi was a practitioner of charity, but because he gave without sincerity, he was reborn in the little empty palace of the Acacia Grove, dependent on the four divine kings. Then Venerable Gavampati consented by remaining silent. Thereafter, on his occasional descents to the continent of Jambudīpa, Venerable Gavampati told people all over the continent of Jambudīpa: Give with sincerity, give with your own hands, give having gone there yourselves, give with steadfast faith, give with understanding of deeds

and the results of deeds. Why? So that you may not experience the results of [malpracticed] charity, in the manner of King Pāyāsi of Setavyā. King Pāyāsi was a practitioner of charity, but because he gave without sincerity he was reborn [only] in the little empty palace of the Acacia Grove, dependent on the four divine kings. This is what Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said. Having heard what Ven- erable Kumāra Kassapa said, King Pāyāsi, the brahmins and householders of Setavyā, and the monks were delighted and remembered it well.

(^2) The three others are the _Chang ahan jing_ ( _Dīrghāgama,_ T. 1), the _Za ahan jing_ ( _Saṃ - yuk tāgama,_ T. 99), and the _Zengyi ahan jing_ ( _Ekottarikāgama,_ T. 125). (^3) All Chinese Āgamas have been translated into Japanese and Korean. (^4) In the Pāli canon the _Sutta-piṭaka_ includes a fifth collection of texts, the _Khudda - kanikāya._ The schools of the northern tradition knew a similar group of texts, but some established it as a separate _piṭaka,_ the _Kṣudraka-piṭaka,_ instead of including it in the _Sūtra-piṭaka_ (though the designation _Kṣudrakāgama_ is also found in some sources: Egaku Mayeda, “Japanese Studies on the Schools of the Chinese Āgamas,” in Heinz Bechert, ed., _Zur Schulzugehörigkeit von Werken der Hīnayāna-Literatur_ [Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1985], p. 95; Étienne Lamotte, _Le Traité de la Grande Vertu de Sagesse de Nāgārjuna,_ vol. 3 [Louvain: Université de Louvain Institut Orientaliste, 1970]). _Piṭaka_ or _Āgama,_ the fifth collection was never translated as such into Chinese. (^5) For want of better terms we subsume under the term “northern tradition” the textual traditions of the schools in Northern India and Central Asia that were codified in lan- guages other than Pāli; the textual traditions that were transmitted to Sri Lanka and eventually resulted in the Pāli canon are correspondingly termed “southern.” This distinction may be blunt, but is nevertheless useful. (^6) See Bhikkhu Anālayo, “The Chinese _Madhyama-āgama_ and the Pāli _Majjhima- nikāya_ —In the Footsteps of Thich Minh Chau,” _Indian International Journal of Buddhist Studies_ 9 (2008): 1–21. (^7) The figures cited here are query results from the digital version of Chizen Akanuma’s _Kan pa shibu shiagon goshōroku_ (comcatV3.xml, available at [http://mbingenheimer.net/](http://mbingenheimer.net/) tools/comcat/indexComcat.html). Added together, these numbers slightly exceed the total of two hundred and twenty-two, because in some cases one sutra has more than one parallel. Moreover, these numbers are subject to debate. Bhikkhu Anālayo, in his detailed study, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya_ (Taipei: Dharma Drum, 2011, p. 9), allows for only ninety-six parallels of the _Zhong ahan jing_ in the MN. While the absolute numbers will always depend on the definition of “parallel,” this

general ratio will hold true: less than half of the sutras of T. 26 are found in the MN, most of the rest are found in the three other Nikāyas, and for a small percentage there seems to be no clear parallel in the Pāli corpus. Akanuma’s catalogue, Kanpa shibu shiagon goshōroku ( The Comparative Catalogue of Chinese Āgamas and Pāli Nikāyas ) (Nagoya: Hajinkaku shobō, 1929) is now dated; for the MN parallels one should refer to Bhikkhu Anālayo and Roderick S. Bucknell, “Correspondence Table for Parallels to the Discourses of the Majjhima Nikāya: Toward a Revision of Akanuma’s Com parative Catalogue,” Journal of the Centre for Buddhist Studies, Sri Lanka 4 (2006): 215–243, which has also been included in a recent attempt to synthesize the available data in database format (http://www.suttacentral.net/).

(^8) Only a few Āgama sutras were translated into Tibetan. For an in-depth discussion of these, see Peter Skilling, “Theravādin Literature in Tibetan Translation,” _Journal of the Pali Text Society_ 19 (1993): 69–203. (^9) See Oskar von Hinüber, “Origin and Varieties of Buddhist Sanskrit,” in Colette Caillat, ed., _Dialectes dans les Littératures Indo-aryennes_ (Paris: de Boccard, 1989), pp. 341– 367, on the varieties of Buddhist Sanskrit. See Richard Salomon, _Ancient Buddhist Scrolls from Gandhāra—The British Library Kharoṣṭī Fragments_ (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1999), pp. 110–140, for an overview of Gāndhārī and evidence that Gāndhārī was indeed one single Prakritic language that exerted a strong influence on the transmission of Buddhist texts. It has been argued that the source texts of the _Chang ahan jing_ ( _Dīrghāgama,_ T. 1) (Ernst Waldschmidt, “Remarks on the Mad- hyamāgama Ms. Cat.-no.412,” in Ernst Waldschmidt, Walter Clawiter, Lore Sander, and Preussische Turfan-Expeditionen, eds., _Sanskrithandschriften aus den Turfan- funden_ , vol. IV, pp. 1–5 [Wiesbaden: F. Steiner, 1980]), and the _Pu yao jing_ ( _Lali- tavistara,_ T. 186) (John Brough, “The Arapacana Syllabary on the Old Lalita vistara,” _Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies_ 40 [1977]: 85–95) were in Gāndhārī. On the language of the source text for the _Chang ahan jing_ (T. 1), see Seishi Karashima, _Chōagonkyō no gengo no kenkyū_ ( _A Study of the Original Language of the Chinese Dīrghaāgama_ ) (Tokyo: Hirakawa shuppan, 1994). Daniel Boucher, in “Gāndhārī and the Early Chinese Buddhist Translations Reconsidered: The Case of the _Saddharmapuṇḍarīkasūtra,_ ” _The Journal of the American Oriental Society_ 118 (4) (October 1998): 471–506, has criticized the trend to assume by default that Gāndhārī was the original language of most of the early translations, and emphasizes that other factors connected to the orality of the translation process must be taken into account when reconstructing the Indian source text from the Chinese.

(^16) T.1.26:. (^17) T.2.99:199a14. (^18) T.1.26:. The identity of Daoci is unclear. The _Lidai sanbao ji_ (T.49.2034:70c3) names Daozu (probably identical with Zhu Daozu [347–419]) as the scribe for this translation and this is also the name that appears in the Taishō byline (T.1.26:421a7). The Taishō edition, following the Tripiṭaka Koreana, has included Daoci’s text as postscript without mentioning the name of the author (though the text itself clearly identifies Daoci as the author). There are other early sources that give Daoci as the author of the preface (cf. the independent report in the _Kaiyuan shijiao lu_ (T.55.2154:505b6). The _Lidai sanbao ji_ is much less reliable than the _Chu sanzang jiji_ and is responsible for many spurious attributions of pre-Sui Chinese Buddhist texts. Naming Daozu of Wu as the scribe who set down T. 26 should therefore be considered one of the many mistakes made by Fei Changfang, the author of the _Lidai sanbao ji_ (a mere scribal error of _zu_ for _ci_ is unlikely). The mistake found its way into later catalogues (e.g., T.55.2149:246b21), the Tripiṭaka Koreana, and from there into the Taishō edition. (^19) T.2.125:549a10. This version of events is taken up in Dharmanandin’s biography in the _Liang gaoseng zhuan_ (T.50.2059:328b19). Dharmanandin was also involved in the translation of Abhidharma scriptures, which he recorded as recited by Saṁgha - bhūti (T.50.2059:328b8). (^20) E.g., T.55.2146:129a2. (^21) Dao’an refers to this earlier preface in his preface to the _Zengyi ahan jing_ (T. 125) (T.55.2145:64b1). It is also attested in Fajing’s _Zhongjing mulu_ (T.55.2146:147b27).

It does, however, state that Huiyuan’s disciple Huichi (337–413) (T.50.2059:361b25–26 and 329a22) was involved in the translation. On the other hand, the _Gaoseng zhuan_ (T.50.2059: 374c23) mentions a Daoci from Yuzhou, but at a time some hundred years later. The contradiction can be settled on logical grounds. If we accept Daoci’s preface in the _Chu sanzang jiji_ as genuine, and there is little reason to doubt its authenticity, we also have to accept its account as authoritative, since Daoci was directly involved in the translation process. The Daoci mentioned in the _Gaoseng zhuan_ must have been another monk with the same name. (^30) T.50.2059:328b12. (^31) T.1.26:809b6–8.

the Dharma guptakas should be considered as well, since this is the school most closely associated with this language. In the light of later research by von Hinüber (“Origin and Varieties of Buddhist Sanskrit,” p. 354) and Fumio Enomoto ( A Comprehensive Study of the Chinese Saṃyuktāgama, p. 106), this has become unlikely. Among other reasons, the fact that there is an overlap of seven sutras between T. 26 and the Chang ahan jing (T. 1), which is widely believed to be a translation of the Dharmaguptaka Dīrghāgama, makes an attribution of T. 26 to the Dharmaguptakas unlikely. For more details, see Chung and Fukita, A Survey of the Sanskrit Fragments Corresponding to the Chinese Madhyamagama.

(^35) I am grateful to Dr. Chung for making a draft copy of the section available to me.

Of this earliest print witness of the _Zhong ahan jing_ only fascicles 2–4, 6–9, 21, and 51–54 have survived. (Parts of the first edition of the Tripiṭaka Koreana have been digitized by the Research Institute of Tripiṭaka Koreana, Koryo Daejanggyeong Yongguso, Seoul.) Character counts for the _Zhong ahan jing_ are also included in the Jin or Zhaocheng edition (printed 1139–1178). Character counts are a form of metadata attached to help with preserving the integrity of the text. A standardized layout seems to be a precondition for character counts, since only if the number of characters per line and the number of lines per sheet or woodblock are fixed is it possible to calculate them easily and reliably. (^38) Zhongguo Fojiao Xiehui, ed., _Fangshan shijing_ (Beijing: Zhongguo fojiao tushu wenwu guan, 1989), vol. 21, pp. 1–592. (^39) As mentioned above (n. 37), only twelve fascicles from the first carving of the Tripi - ṭaka Koreana (1011–1029) have survived. Next to that we have the Jin edition as an early witness. It is contemporaneous with the Fangshan edition, but its version of the _Zhong ahan jing_ is not complete; fascicles 2–3, 9, 25, 41, 51–52, 56, and 59 are lost. The remains of the Jin canon are reproduced in the _Zhonghua dazang jing_ (Shanghai: Zhonghua shuju, 1984–1996). One single fascicle (no. 36) of the _Zhong ahan jing_ contained in the Liao canon (c. 983–1031) has survived: item no. 9 in Shanxi wenwuju and Zhongguo lishi bowuguan, _Yingxian muta Liaodai mizang_ (Beijing: Wenwu chubanshe, 1991), according to Stefano Zachetti, _In Praise of the Light—A Critical Synoptic Edition with an Annotated Translation of Chapters 1–3 of Dharma rakṣa’s Guang zan jing_ 光贊經 , _being the Earliest Chinese Translation of the Larger Prajñā- pāramitā_ (Tokyo: The International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology, Soka University, 2005), p. 103n.

Notes

(^40) TransHelp is open-sourced and available at the SourceForge repository. (^41) Cf. _Dhammaññū-sutta,_ AN IV 113. (^42) We chose to use the Pāli term _khattiya_ instead of the translation “warrior,” to make clear that the term refers to the caste, not to a specific group of warriors. (^43) AN IV 115 speaks instead of having a desire to see noble ones, _ariyānaṃ dassanakāmo._ Perhaps the original used for the Chinese translation also referred to such a “desire,” as the character _wang,_ used in the present context, could be a result of mistaking _kāma,_ “desire,” for _kama,_ “going” (√ _kram_ ). (^44) _Fengxing,_ probably corresponding to the Indian _dharati/dhāreti,_ e.g., in the frequently used phrase _bhagavato sutvā bhikkhū dhāressantī._ The Chinese characters mean lit- erally, “receive [orders/teachings] and act upon,” hence it is often translated as “to practice accordingly” or the like. To judge from the Indian corpus, the phrase was originally understood as “to uphold,” “to bear in mind,” “to remember.” Later Chinese commentators and lexicographers were aware of this at times (T.40.1819: 844a29– b1 and, probably based on this, HDC [s.v.]). Moreover, in T. 26 and elsewhere one finds _fengxing_ in contexts where only “remember” makes sense (e.g., in Sāriputta’s answers to Mahā Koṭṭhita in sutra 29). Based on this and other passages, we chose to render _fengxing_ as “remember well” in the closing formula. For a more detailed discussion see Bingenheimer, _Studies in Āgama Literature—With Special Reference to the Shorter Chinese Saṃyuktāgama,_ pp. 51–55. (^45) Cf. _Pāricchattaka-sutta,_ AN IV 117. (^46) _Wang._ The translator(s) apparently took an Indic equivalent of _jālaka_ to mean “net,” which indeed is one possible meaning. Here, however, the relevant meaning is “bud.” (^47) _Le zhu shi,_ Pāli _sukha-vihāra._ In the Chinese textual tradition the final character _shi,_ “room, abode,” is sometimes mistaken as _kong,_ “emptiness.” Another variant is _ding,_ “concentration.” That _kong_ is a scribal error is supported by the lack of a corresponding term in the Pāli version of the formula. (^48) Cf. _Nagaropama-sutta,_ AN IV 106. (^49) Here the text adds “emptiness,” probably owing to a copyist’s error, as explained in note 47, for _le zhu shi,_ above. (^50) Cf. _Udakūpama-sutta,_ AN IV 11. (^51) The formulation found at this point in MĀ 4 could be understood to imply that the fetters are already abandoned before the attainment of stream-entry. The Pāli parallel AN IV 12, however, reads _tiṇṇaṃ saññojanānaṃ parikkhayā sotāpanno hoti,_ “by abandoning the three fetters he becomes a stream-enterer.” That the eradication of the three fetters takes place at the moment of stream-entry itself can be seen more explicitly in Sn 231 and AN I 242. (^52) The present passage reads literally, “born in that interval,” Pāli _opapātika_ (AN IV 12).

(^53) Cf. _Aggikkhandhopama-sutta,_ AN IV 128. (^54) _Cheng_ can render _pratijñā_ (Akira Hirakawa, _Bukkyō kanbon daijiten_ [ _Buddhist Chi- nese-Sanskrit Dictionary_ ] (Tokyo: Reiyūkai, 1997], p. 903), so that the intended sense would be similar to the Pāli parallel, AN IV 128: _assamaṇassa samaṇapaṭiññassa abrahmacārissa brahmacāripaṭiññassa._ (^55) No reference to a fireplace is found in the Pāli parallel. Since Buddhist monks and nuns in ancient India were not allowed to kindle a fire to warm themselves, one would not expect them to be given a hut with a fireplace.

(^60) Adopting the variant reading _yi._ (^61) Adopting the variant reading _hui._ (^62) _Wu suo zhuo._ For an explanation of how the second epithet of the Buddha, “Arahant,” came to be translated in this way, see Jan Nattier, “The Ten Epithets of the Buddha in the Translations of Zhi Qian,” _Annual Report of the International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology at Soka University_ 6 (2003): 217–219. (^63) On the pre-Kumārajīva Chinese translation of _anuttarapuruṣadamyasārathi_ as _wushang shi_ and _daofayu,_ see Thich Minh Chau, _The Chinese Madhyama Āgama and the Pāli Majjhima Nikāya_ (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1991, reprint), p. 326; Nattier, “The Ten Epithets of the Buddha in the Translations of Zhi Qian,” pp. 244–245, 247. Even though this seeming misreading of _damya_ for _dharma_ might reflect an independent interpretation of the term that already existed in India, we here assume, against our text, that the correct form of the epithet is as rendered above. (^64) Cf. _Rathavinīta-sutta,_ MN I 145. (^65) The use of the expression “renunciant Gotama” would have been chosen by Sāriputta on purpose in order not to give away his identity as a co-disciple of the Buddha. For a disciple the proper way to refer to the Buddha would rather be “World-honored One” ( _bhagavā_ ). (^66) Adopting the variant reading _er._ (^67) The text gives the name of the mother just as _ci,_ Mettā. (^68) Cf. _Sabbāsava-sutta,_ MN I 6. (^69) The passage actually reads “does not remove, discard, forsake, and get rid of them,” which is a textual corruption.

Notes

(^70) Cf. _Loṇaphala-sutta,_ AN I 249. (^71) In the Chinese, this assertion and the preceding one are identically worded. However, from the Pāli parallel (AN I 249) and the context, it is clear that a distinction is being made between two different assertions: first, that karmic retribution is exactly com- mensurate with the deed, resulting in a determinism that precludes the holy life and the ending of suffering; second, the general proposition that the results of deeds will inevitably be experienced. (^72) Cf. _Vappa-sutta,_ AN II 196. (^73) AN II 196 adds that he also has eradicated ignorance and aroused knowledge, thereby indicating that the person in question is a fully awakened one. (^74) Cf. _Titthāyatanādi-sutta,_ AN I 173. (^75) Taking the _shi_ in the meaning of “to approve, to endorse” (HDC, s.v.). (^76) _Nei yin nei. Yin nei_ signifies “reason and authority” (William E. Soothill and Lewis Hodous, _A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms_ [London: Kegan, 1937], p. 205), and _nei_ can render _antargata_ (Hirakawa, _Bukkyō kanbon daijiten,_ p. 160); hence, the sense appears to be “on being included in this reason,” or, more freely, “it would follow logically.” (^77) Cf. _Ambalaṭṭhikārāhulovāda-sutta,_ MN I 414. (^78) Here and below the text actually reads “pure,” which must be a textual error; cf. the discussion in Anālayo, “Oral Dimensions of Pāli Discourses,” pp. 38–40. (^79) Here and below the text actually reads “impure”; cf. n. 78, above. (^80) Cf. AN V 292-302. (^81) Cf. _Kesamutti-sutta,_ AN I 188. (^82) Cf. _Asibandhakaputta-sutta,_ SN IV 311. (^83) The _bi_ here is probably a mistake for _dang,_ as in the parallel passage below. (^84) Cf. _Sīha-sutta,_ AN IV 179. (^85) _Zu xing zi,_ Pāli _kulaputta._ Often translated as “son of good family.” With “clansman” we follow Bhikkhu Bodhi. Margaret Cone’s suggestion of “noble youth (of whatever birth)” ( _A Dictionary of Pāli,_ vol. 1. [a-kh] [Oxford: Pāli Text Society, 2001]) is also possible, perhaps preferable, in most cases, but there are passages where the term does not seem to encompass only the young. (^86) Cf. _Devadaha-sutta,_ MN II 214. (^87) _Zeng e,_ Skt. _kutsana_ (Hirakawa, _Bukkyō kanbon daijiten,_ p. 503). (^88) _Zi duan ku._ This is one of several cases in T. 26 where Chinese _duan_ seems to have resulted from a confusion of _prahāṇa_ (“getting rid of,” “eliminate,” _duan_ )

Notes

and pra dhāna (“exertion”). This could be due to a Prakritic conflation of Skt. prahāṇa and pradhāna in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit prahāna, or else due to a genuine alternative interpretation of the passage in the northern tradition. (There are other instances in the northern tradition where prahāṇa is preferred over pradhāna; e.g., in the list of the “four correct kinds of elimination,” catvāri samyak-prahāṇāni/si zheng duan. The Saṅghadeva team consistently rendered the pra- √ ha in their Prakrit source as duan.

(^89) The dialogic structure in the Chinese is ambivalent here. Following the Pāli, we con- sider the rhetorical question and its answer as part of the monks’ speech. (^90) Cf. _Pāṭaliya–sutta,_ SN IV 340. (^91) Here and in the two instances above, the term _shi huan_ appears to be a translation error. The text makes sense when, as in the Pāli, the headman asks first only if the Buddha knows magic. There it is only after the Buddha answers in the affirmative that the headman equates knowing magic with being a magician and is reproached for doing so. (^92) The Chinese character _ji_ is usually restricted to female singers and has the connotation of “prostitute.” Here it is perhaps used rather like the English “songstress” or “crooner.” (^93) _Zhai,_ Pāli _yiṭṭha_ (SN IV 348). (^94) _Wu shang ren shang zhi fa._ We follow the variant readings found in the Chinese editions of the canon, which omit the second _shang._ (^95) Cf. AN I 63. (^96) _Deng xin tian,_ Pāli _samacittā devatā._ (^97) Cf. _Nirodha-sutta,_ AN III 192. (^98) Baijing, lit., “spotless, pure.” The Taishō note for this name gives Upavāna, the name of the protagonist in the Pāli parallel. It is difficult, however, to see how Upavāna could have been rendered as Baijing. The name in the Indic original could have been Vimala or perhaps Suddha, Subha, or Sukka. However, the name of the well-attested elder Vimala is rendered differently below, being transcribed as Weimoluo (T.01.26.472a2–3). In sutra 32 of our text (Shi) Baijing renders the name of the Buddha’s father, Suddhodana. Elsewhere in the canon Baijing renders the name of the nun Subhā (e.g., at T.2.100:483b27, or at T.4.200:239b16). (^99) Cf. _Kaḷāra-sutta,_ SN II 50. (^100) Cf. _Sīhanāda-sutta,_ AN IV 373. (^101) Cf. _Dutiya-āghātapaṭivinaya-sutta,_ AN III 186. (^102) _Chu nao,_ Pāli _āghātapaṭinvinaya._ (^103) Cf. _Gulissāni-sutta,_ MN I 469.

Notes

(^104) _Wu shi,_ Pāli _arañña._ (^105) Cf. _Dhanañjāni-sutta,_ MN II 184. (^106) Adopting the variant _guan._ (^107) _Nu bi,_ Pāli _dāsidāsā._ In some places perhaps only _dāsā,_ “servants,” without empha- sizing both genders, but in the absence of an Indic original this cannot be decided. (^108) Adopting the variant _fei_ instead of _yi._ (^109) Cf. _Paṭhama-anāthapiṇḍika-sutta,_ SN V 380, _Sudatta-sutta,_ SN I 210; and Vin II 154. (^110) Adopting the variant _mi_ (“honey”). (^111) _Zhang zhe,_ Pāli _gahapati/seṭṭhi._ Elsewhere translated as “householder.” (^112) Cf. _Sammādiṭṭhi-sutta,_ MN I 46. (^113) Cf. _Mahāhatthipadopama-sutta,_ MN I 184. (^114) This appears to be an error (mind objects do not require light), an unwarranted repetition of the corresponding passage from the description of visual cognition. (^115) The text literally has “the external forms and mind objects cognized by mind con- sciousness.” This appears to be another case of confusion with the earlier passage referring to visual cognition. The same applies for the passage stating that the mind and its objects belong to the material form aggregate. (^116) Cf. _Saccavibhaṅga-sutta,_ MN III 248. (^117) Adopting the variant _zheng_ instead of _xin._ (^118) Cf. _Acchariya-abbhūta-sutta,_ MN III 118. (^119) From the context it is clear that _ru yi zu_ refers to “supernormal power” (Pāli _iddhi - vidhā/iddhi-ānubhāva_ ), both in this sutra and in nos. 36 and 60. Elsewhere, however (e.g., sutras 35, 37, 62, 69), it has its more usual meaning, “bases of supernormal power” ( _iddhi-pāda_ ), and is translated accordingly. (^120) This may be the elder Gavāṃpati, though his name is transcribed differently at T01.26:532a25–29, where it is confirmed by the Pāli (unlike the present case, for which there is no parallel Pāli discourse). Since transcriptions of names are usually very consistent in T. 26, this case needs further research. (^121) Xutuoye. According to the _Ding Fubao Foxue Dacidian_ (s.v.) this is a variant tran- scription of Sutuoyi, for which again the _Ding Fubao_ gives Sudāya, Sudāna, and to which the _Foguang dacidian_ adds “Pāli: Sudāyi.” However, Sudāyi seems not to be attested. The case is problematic and needs further research. (^122) The Chinese transcription is unique; the intended name may have been Pūrṇamāśa/ Puṇṇamāsa or Pindola Bhāradvāja. The name Binnoujiatuniao is listed under Puṇṇa

(^123) Adopting the variant _suo luo luo._ The identification of Salaḷāgāra is tentative. According to Malalasekera (s.v.), Salaḷāgāra is a building in Jeta’s Grove, apparently made out of _salaḷa_ wood, and not a mountain. (^124) Cf. _Bakkula-sutta,_ MN III 124. (^125) Cf. _Pahārāda-sutta,_ AN IV 197. (^126) Cf. _Bhūmicala-sutta,_ AN IV 308. (^127) Cf. _Uposatha-sutta,_ AN IV 204. (^128) The exact meaning of the term _che chuan_ is doubtful. Also doubtful is whether the simile is refers to the relentlessness of the rain or to the size of the raindrops. An alter- native solution might be “[large] drops, [long] like the linchpins on the axle caps [of a chariot].” (^129) Cf. _Ugga-sutta,_ AN IV 208. (^130) Cf. _Dutiyahatthaka-sutta,_ AN IV 218. (^131) The four _saṅgahavatthu_ s are not translated clearly in the Chinese. Our translation relies heavily on the Pāli version. (^132) The Chinese has only Dharma hall ( _fa tang_ ). It is clear from the context that this is the Sudhamma Hall ( _shanfa tang_ ), the usual assembly place for the thirty-three gods (Gunapala Malalasekera, _Dictionary of Pali Proper Names_ [London: Pali Text Society, 1974], s.v.). (^133) Cf. _Paṭhamahatthaka-sutta,_ AN IV 216. (^134) Cf. _Kimatthiya-sutta,_ AN V 1. _Yi,_ Pāli _attha._ Depending on the context, _attha_ can denote “goal,” “purpose,” “profit,” “benefit,” “wealth,” “concern,” “meaning,” and more. “Purpose” makes sense for both the Chinese _yi_ a nd the Indic _attha._ Frank Woodward, _The Book of Gradual Sayings_ (London: Pali Text Society, 1936), vol. V, p. 1, translates the corresponding question in the _Kimatthiya- sutta_ as “What is the object?” See also his note on this, and the remarks on _attha_ by C. A. F. Rhys Davids in her Introduction, p. viii. (^135) Cf. _Cetanākaraṇīya-sutta,_ AN V 2. (^136) Cf. _Satisampajañña-sutta,_ AN IV 336. (^137) Cf. _Hirī-ottappa-sutta,_ AN IV 99.

Notes

(^138) This structure is also used in the following sutras: 1) some tenet X (from the conditionally linked chain of concepts); 2) analogy illustrating X; 3) X again as moral of the analogy;

4. X reversed/negated; 5) analogy reversed/negated; 6) moral reversed/ negated. (^139) Cf. _Paṭhama-upanisā-sutta,_ A V 313. (^140) Cf. _Dutiya-upanisā-sutta,_ A V 314. The number of this sutra is mistakenly printed as “47” in the Taishō. (^141) _Shi xi nie pan._ Here _shi_ is probably a mistake for _bian._ (^142) Cf. _Paṭhama-agārava-sutta,_ AN III 14. (^143) _Shen_ for _skandha/khandha._ These are the “five groups or parts which constitute the factors of right living” ( _Pāli-English Dictionary,_ s.v. _khandha_ ). (^144) Cf. _Dutiya-agārava-sutta,_ AN III 15. (^145) Cf. _Avijjā-sutta,_ AN V 113 and _Taṇhā-sutta,_ A V 116. (^146) Older comparative catalogues list no Pāli parallel for this sutra, which combines the two sets developed in sutras nos. 42–48 and 51–53, and adds a number of new links ( _ñāṇa-dassana, āsavakkhaya,_ etc., at the beginning and _atthūpaparikkhā,_ etc., at the end). These additional links of the chain appear in MN 70 ( _Kitagiri-sutta_ ) and MN 95 ( _Caṅkī-sutta_ ). (^147) _Guan fa ren,_ Pāli _dhammanijjhānakkhanti_ (Hirakawa, _Bukkyō kanbon daijiten,_ no. 3427: _dharma-nidhyāna-kṣānti_ ). (^148) The Taishō text is garbled here. We follow the suggested reading in the CBETA edition (T01.26.490c29). (^149) Cf. _Meghiya-sutta,_ AN IV 354. (^150) _She dou._ The Taishō note (p. 491, note 6) gives _jantu,_ the reading in the Pāli _sutta._ The reading _jatu,_ which appears in the Pāli commentary ( _Manoratha pūraṇī_ IV 164), is preferable. (^151) _Xue duan._ See the footnote on _zi duan ku_ in sutra 19. (^152) _Duan._ Here too probably “striving” ( _padhāna_ ) is meant rather than “abandoning” ( _pahāna_ ). See footnote on _zi duan ku_ in sutra 19. (^153) Cf. _Sambodhi-sutta,_ AN IV 351. (^154) Cf. _Cakkavatti-sutta,_ SN V 99. (^155) Cf. _Lakkhaṇa-sutta,_ DN III 142. (^156) Cf.

Senart_ (Paris: Imprimerie Nationale, 1882–1897), vol. 3, pp. 441–449. (^160) Cf. _Ghaṭikāra-sutta,_ MN II 45. (^161) Probably rendering the variously attested name Nigrodha (Skt. Nyagrodha). Cf. Analayo, “Zhong A-han,” in W. G. Weeraratne, ed., _Encyclopaedia of Buddhism_ (Sri Lanka: Department of Buddhist Affairs, 2009), vol. 8, no. 3, pp. 827–830. (^162) Cf. _Devadūta-sutta,_ MN III 178. (^163) The final _shan_ in this half-line is probably a mistake for _jing. Shan qing jing_ = Pāli _suparisuddha._ (^164) Perhaps the _gungla_ or _ghungil_ ( _Anastomus oscitans_ ), a small stork that feeds on shell- fish. (^165) _Wu huan,_ literally, “not hurt.” _Huan_ may have been used to translate _riṣṭa/riṭṭha._ (^166) Cf. _Theragāthā_ 910-919. (^167) Cf. _Cakkavatti-sutta,_ DN III 75. (^168) Cf. _Makhādeva-sutta,_ MN II 74. (^169) “Seven limbs”: the elephant’s four legs, two tusks, and trunk. (^170) _Yu sha he,_ Pāli _usabha._ (^171) _Xianren wang,_ or (below) _wang xianren,_ Skt. _rāja-ṛṣi._ Outside this compound we translate _xianren_ as “seer.” (^172) The meaning of this passage is unclear. _Jian,_ besides its usual meaning of “view,” can also render _ā-_ √ _gam_ (Hirakawa, _Bukkyō kanbon daijiten,_ s.v.). (^173) _Fa zhai:_ charitable events where food is given to the poor, probably in the context of recitations and other rituals. Chinese readers through the ages would have understood this to mean vegetarian food, but it is not necessary to assume this for the Indian con- text. (^174) Cf. _Mahāsudassana-sutta,_ DN II 169. (^175) _Bo luo tou._ Probably a mistake for _bo tou luo,_ transcribing a word equivalent to Skt./Pāli _pāṭala._ (^176) Pāli _pañcaṅgika tūriya_. (^177) Cf. _Cakkavattisīhanāda-sutta,_ DN III 58.

Notes

(^178) _Dang zi ran fadeng._ “You should yourself be a lamp of the Dharma” would be a more literal translation. For the phrasing of this passage, cf. T.12.380:972c13. (^179) _Ding sheng,_ Pāli _muddhābhisitta. Ding sheng_ was used in sutra 60 to translate the name Māndhāta. (^180) _Feifayu_ [ _e_ ] _tan xiefa._ Other passages (e.g., below T.1.26:524b16) insert the character _e,_ “evil,” for this triad. (^181) Cf. _Pāyāsi-sutta,_ DN II 316. (^182) _Ru lai chi,_ lit., “the Tathāgatha’s command.” The _lai_ is probably a mistake for the particle _suo._ (^183) The text reads _wu/e,_ which, according to Hirakawa ( _Bukkyō kanbon daijiten,_ p. 486), can render _pratikūla._ (^184) _Bing,_ perhaps for Skt. _bhakta._ The Pāli has _kali,_ the “losing number of dice,” “the extra die” (Cone, _A Dictionary of Pāli,_ vol. 1 [a-kh], s.v.). It seems that the Indian game was played with edible seeds of the _vibīthaka_ tree; Thomas W. and Caroline A. Rhys Davids, _Dialogues of the Buddha, Translated from the Pāli of the Dīgha Nikāya_ (London: H. Frowde, Oxford University Press, 1899–1921), vol. II, p. 368, n. 1. The idea is that losing could be prevented by eating a token.
