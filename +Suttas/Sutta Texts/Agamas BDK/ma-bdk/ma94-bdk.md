### 94. The Discourse on the Monk Kālaka

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Eastern Park, in the Hall of Migāra’s Mother. At this time the monk Kālaka, Migāra’s mother’s son, who always liked disputing, approached the Buddha. Seeing the monk Kālaka approaching in the distance, the World-honored One addressed the monks on account of the monk Kālaka:^186 Suppose a person always likes disputing and does not praise the ending of disputes. If a person always likes disputing and does not praise the ending of disputes, then this state of things is not agreeable, not likeable, cannot be thought of fondly, cannot be respected. It is not conducive to training, not conducive to restraint, not conducive to being a renunciant, not con ducive to attaining mental unification, not conducive to attaining nirvana.^187 Suppose a person has evil desires and does not praise the ending of evil desires. If a person has evil desires and does not praise the ending of evil desires, then this state of things is not agreeable, not likeable, cannot be thought of fondly, cannot be respected. It is not conducive to training, not conducive to restraint, not conducive to being a renunciant, not con ducive to attaining mental unification, not conducive to attaining nirvana. Suppose a person violates the precepts, transgresses the precepts; his precepts are deficient, his precepts are in tatters, his precepts are corrupted, and he does not praise observance of the precepts. If a person violates the precepts, transgresses the precepts; if his precepts are deficient, if his pre cepts are in tatters, if his precepts are corrupted, and he does not praise observance of the precepts, then this state of things is not agreeable, not likeable, cannot be thought of fondly, cannot be respected. It is not con ducive to training, not conducive to restraint, not conducive to being a renunciant, not conducive to attaining mental unification, not conducive to attaining nirvana. Suppose a person is given to ill-will,... uncommunicativeness,... avarice,... envy,... flattery,... deceit,... lacks shame and scruples and does not praise shame and scruples. If a person is given to ill-will,... uncommunicativeness,... avarice,... envy,... flattery,... deceit,...

lacks shame and scruples and does not praise shame and scruples, then this state of things is not agreeable, not likeable, cannot be thought of fondly, cannot be respected. It is not conducive to training, not conducive to restraint, not conducive to being a renunciant, not conducive to attaining mental unification, not conducive to attaining nirvana. Suppose a person does not show support for his companions in the holy life and does not praise the showing of support for one’s companions in the holy life. If a person does not show support for his companions in the holy life and does not praise the showing of support for one’s com- panions in the holy life, then this state of things is not agreeable, not like- able, cannot be thought of fondly, cannot be respected. It is not conducive to training, to restraint, not conducive to being a renunciant, not conducive to attaining mental unification, not conducive to attaining nirvana. Suppose a person does not contemplate the teachings and does not praise contemplation of the teachings. If a person does not contemplate the teachings, and does not praise contemplation of the teachings, then this state of things is not agreeable, not likeable, cannot be thought of fondly, cannot be respected. It is not conducive to training, not conducive to restraint, not conducive to being a renunciant, not conducive to attaining mental unification, not conducive to attaining nirvana. Suppose a person does not sit in meditation and does not praise sitting in meditation. If a person does not sit in meditation and does not praise sitting in meditation, then this state of things is not agreeable, not likeable, cannot be thought of fondly, cannot be respected. It is not conducive to training, not conducive to restraint, not conducive to being a renunciant, not conducive to attaining mental unification, not conducive to attaining nirvana. Even though that person may think, “May my companions in the holy life support me, respect me, and honor me!”, his companions in the holy life still do not support him, respect him, or honor him. Why is that? That person has these countless evil qualities. Because he has these countless evil qualities, his companions in the holy life do not support him, respect him, or honor him. Suppose that a bad-natured horse is tethered in a stable to be fed. Even though it may think, “May people tether me in a comfortable place, give me good water and fodder, and look after me well!” people still do not

tether it in a comfortable place, give it good water and fodder, or look after it well. Why is that? Because that horse has a bad nature, it is extremely rough and disobedient, not docile and well-behaved and this causes people not to tether it in a comfortable place, give it good water and fodder, or look after it well. In the same way, even though a person may think, “May my compan ions in the holy life support me, respect me, and honor me!” his compan ions in the holy life still do not support him, respect him, or honor him. Why is that? That person has these countless evil qualities. Because he has these countless evil qualities this causes his companions in the holy life not to support to him, respect him, or honor him. [In contrast to this,] suppose a person does not like disputing and praises the ending of disputes. If a person does not like disputing and praises the ending of disputes, then this state of things is agreeable, likeable, enjoyable, can be thought of fondly, can be respected. It is conducive to training, is conducive to restraint, is conducive to being a renunciant, is conducive to attaining mental unification, is conducive to attaining nirvana. Suppose a person does not have evil desires and praises the ending of evil desires. If a person does not have evil desires and praises the ending of evil desires, then this state of things is agreeable, likeable, enjoyable, can be thought of fondly, can be respected. It is conducive to training, is conducive to restraint, is conducive to being a renunciant, is conducive to attaining mental unification, is conducive to attaining nirvana. Suppose a person does not violate the precepts, does not transgress the precepts; his precepts are not deficient, his precepts are not in tatters, his precepts are not corrupted, and he praises observance of the precepts. If a person does not violate the precepts, does not transgress the precepts; if his precepts are not deficient, if his precepts are not in tatters, if his pre cepts are not corrupted, and if he praises observance of the precepts, then this state of things is agreeable, likeable, enjoyable, can be thought of fondly, can be respected. It is conducive to training, is conducive to restraint, is conducive to being a renunciant, is conducive to attaining mental unification, is conducive to attaining nirvana. Suppose a person is not given to ill-will,... uncommunicativeness,... avarice,... envy,... flattery,... deceit,... lack of shame and scruples,

and praises possession of shame and scruples. If a person is not given to ill-will,... uncommunicativeness,... avarice,... envy,... flattery,... deceit,... does not lack shame and scruples, and praises possession of shame and scruples, then this state of things is agreeable, likeable, enjoy- able, can be thought of fondly, can be respected. It is conducive to training, is conducive to restraint, is conducive to being a renunciant, is conducive to attaining mental unification, is conducive to attaining nirvana. Suppose a person shows support for his companions in the holy life and praises showing support for one’s companions in the holy life.

It is conducive to training, is conducive to restraint, is conducive to being a renunciant, is conducive to attaining mental unification, is conducive to attaining nirvana. Suppose a person contemplates the teachings and praises contemplation of the teachings. If a person contemplates the teachings and praises con- templation of the teachings, then this state of things is agreeable, likeable, enjoyable, can be thought of fondly, can be respected. It is conducive to training, is conducive to restraint, is conducive to being a renunciant, is conducive to attaining mental unification, is conducive to attaining nirvana. Suppose a person sits in meditation and praises sitting in meditation.

It is conducive to training, is conducive to restraint, is conducive to being a renunciant, is conducive to attaining mental unifi- cation, is conducive to attaining nirvana. Even though this person may not think, “May my companions in the holy life support me, respect me, and honor me!” yet his companions in the holy life do support him, respect him, and honor him. Why is that? That person has these countless wholesome qualities. Because he has these countless wholesome qualities, his companions in the holy life support him, respect him, and honor him. Suppose an excellent horse is tethered in a stable to be fed. Even though it may not think, “May people tether me in a comfortable place, give me

good water and fodder, and look after me well!” yet people do tether it in a comfortable place, give it good water and fodder, and look after it well. Why is that? Because that horse has a good nature, is docile and obedient, extremely gentle, and well-behaved; this causes people to tether it in a comfortable place, give it good water and fodder, and look after it well. In the same way, even though this person may not think, “May my companions in the holy life support me, respect me, and honor me!” yet his companions in the holy life do support him, respect him, and honor him. [Why is that? That person has these countless wholesome qualities. Because he has these countless wholesome qualities, his companions in the holy life support him, respect him, and honor him.] Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
