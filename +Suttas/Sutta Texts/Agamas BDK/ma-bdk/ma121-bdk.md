### 121. The Discourse on the Invitation Ceremony ( Pavāraṇā )

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary, spending the rains retreat together with a large assembly of five hundred monks.

At that time on the fifteenth of the month, at the time of the recitation of the code of rules, at the invitation ceremony ( _pavāraṇā_ ), the World-honored One sat down on a seat arranged before the assembly of monks. He addressed the monks:

I am a brahmin, having attained complete cessation. [I am] the unsurpass- able King of Physicians and this present body is the last one for me. Being a brahmin, having attained complete cessation, being the unexcelled King of Physicians, and this present body being the last one for me, I say that you are my true sons, born from my mouth and transformed by the nature of the Dharma. Being my true sons, born from my mouth and transformed by the nature of the Dharma, you should through instruction transform [others, and also] teach and admonish one another.^373 At that time Venerable Sāriputta was also seated among the assembly. Then Venerable Sāriputta rose from his seat, arranged his robe to bare one shoulder, extended his hands with palms together toward the Buddha, and said:

Just now the World-honored One said [this]: “I am a brahmin, having attained complete cessation. [I am] the unsurpassable King of Physicians, and this present body is the last one for me. Being a brahmin, having attained complete cessation, being the unsurpassable King of Physicians, and this present body being the last one for me, I say that you are my true sons, born from my mouth and transformed by the nature of the Dharma. Being my true sons, born from my mouth and transformed by the nature of the Dharma, you should through instruction transform [others, and also] teach and admonish one another.” The World-honored One tames those who are not [yet] tamed, stills those who are not [yet] stilled, delivers those who are not [yet] delivered, liberates those who are not [yet] liberated, quenches those who are not [yet] quenched, brings to attainment of the path those who have not [yet] attained the path, establishes in the holy life those who are not [yet] estab lished in the holy life. [He causes them to] know the path, awaken to the path, recognize the path, and talk about the path. From the World-honored One the disciples obtain the Dharma, receive instruction, and receive admonition. Having received instruction and admonition, following the World-honored One’s words, they then put it

into practice and gain a good understanding of the true Dharma in accor- dance with its purport. That is so. World-honored One, is there not some- thing to censure in my bodily, verbal, and mental conduct? Then the World-honored One said: Sāriputta, I do not censure your bodily, verbal, and mental conduct. Why is that? Sāriputta, you possess intelligent wisdom, great wisdom, quick wisdom, swift wisdom, sharp wisdom, wide wisdom, deep wisdom, eman- cipating wisdom, brightly penetrating wisdom. Sāriputta, you have achieved true wisdom. Sāriputta, it is just as the crown prince of a wheel-turning monarch, if he does not overstep the instructions he has received but respectfully accepts what his father, the king, transmits to him, he is then able to transmit it in turn. In the same way, Sāriputta, you are able to keep turning the wheel of Dharma that I have set turning. For this reason, Sāriputta, I do not censure your bodily, verbal, and mental conduct. Venerable Sāriputta again extended his hands with palms together toward the Buddha and said:

That is so. The World-honored One does not censure my bodily, verbal, and mental conduct. Does the World-honored One not censure the bodily, verbal, and mental conduct of these five hundred monks? The World-honored One said: Sāriputta, I also do not censure the bodily, verbal, and mental conduct of these five hundred monks. Why is that? Sāriputta, these five hundred monks have all attained freedom from attachment. In them the taints have been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, the heavy burden has been discarded, the fetter of existence has been eradicated, and they have attained the good benefit of right knowl edge and right liberation. The only exception is one monk, of whom I earlier foretold that he would, here and now, attain final knowledge, understanding as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, there will not be another experience of existence.”^374

For this reason, Sāriputta, I do not censure the bodily, verbal, and mental conduct of these five hundred monks. A third time Venerable Sāriputta extended his hands with palms together toward the Buddha and said:

That is so. The World-honored One does not censure my bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and he also does not censure the bodily, verbal, and mental conduct of these five hundred monks. World-honored One, among these five hundred monks, how many monks have attained the three higher knowledges, how many monks have attained liberation both ways, and how many monks have attained liberation by wisdom? The World-honored One said: Sāriputta, among these five hundred monks, ninety monks have attained the three higher knowledges, ninety monks have attained liberation both ways, and the remaining monks have attained liberation by wisdom. Sāriputta, this assembly is without branches, without leaves, and without knots or faults. It is pure and genuine [heartwood], having become rightly established.^375 At that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa was seated among the assembly. Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa rose from his seat, arranged his robe to bare one shoulder, extended his hands with palms together toward the Buddha, and said:

That is so. The World-honored One has uplifted me. May the Well-gone One [further] uplift me, so that I may, in the presence of the Buddha and the assembly of monks, utter suitable verses of praise. The World-honored One said, “Vaṅgīsa, do as you wish!” Then in the presence of the Buddha and the assembly of monks, Venerable Vaṅgīsa uttered suitable verses of praise:

Today, on the fifteenth, the day of invitation, An assembly of five hundred monks is seated together. Having gotten rid of all fetters, They are without obstructions, seers for whom [repeated] existence is ended.

Shining with pure light, [They are] liberated from every kind of existence. They have put an end to birth, old age, disease, and death, Eliminated the taints, and done what had to be done. [They] have put an end to restlessness-and-worry and the fetter of doubt, To pride and the taint of existence, And they have cut off the thorn that is the fetter of craving. [Thanks to] the Highest Physician, these no longer exist. Brave as lions, [They] have removed all fear. They have crossed over birth and death, With all taints completely eradicated.^376 Just as a wheel-turning monarch, Surrounded by his many courtiers, Rules over his entire territory, As far as the great ocean, In the same way, the heroic conqueror, The unsurpassable caravan leader, Is revered gladly by his disciples, Who have realized the three [higher knowledges] and abandoned the fear of death. All are sons of the Buddha, Who have permanently removed the branches, leaves, and knots. They pay homage to the foremost Honored One, Who set turning the unsurpassable wheel of the Dharma.^377 Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
