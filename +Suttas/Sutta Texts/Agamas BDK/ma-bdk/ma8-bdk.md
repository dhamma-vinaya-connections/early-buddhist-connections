### 8. The Discourse on Seven Suns

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī, in Ambapālī’s Grove. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: All formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly chang- ing by nature, unreliable by nature.^60 Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them. Why is that? There will be a time when it will not rain. At that time when it does not rain, all the trees, the hundreds of grains, and all medicinal shrubs will wither entirely, come to destruction and extinction, unable to continue existing. This is why [I say that] all for- mations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them. Again, there will be a time when a second sun will appear in the world. When the second sun appears, the flow of all the streams and rivulets will become exhausted, unable to continue existing. This is why [I say that] all formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them. Again, there will be a time when a third sun appears in the world. When the third sun appears, all the great rivers will become exhausted, unable to continue existing. This is why [I say that] all formations are imper- manent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable

by nature. Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them. Again, there will be a time when a fourth sun appears in the world. When the fourth sun appears, the great springs from which the five rivers of Jambudīpa emerge—the Ganges being the first, the Yamunā the second, the Sarabhū the third, the Aciravatī the fourth, and the Mahī the fifth—those great springs will all become exhausted, unable to con tinue existing. This is why [I say that] all formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them. Again, there will be a time when a fifth sun appears in the world. When the fifth sun appears, the water of the great ocean will recede by one hundred leagues, and continue receding gradually until it is [only] seven hundred leagues [in extent]. When the fifth sun appears, and the remaining water in the ocean is [only] seven hundred leagues [in extent], it will continue receding gradually until it is [only] one hundred leagues [in extent]. When the fifth sun appears, the water of the great ocean will decrease [by the height of] one palm tree, and con tinue decreasing gradually until it has [a depth of only] seven palm trees. When the fifth sun appears and the remaining water in the ocean has [a depth of only] seven palm trees, it will continue decreasing grad ually until it has [a depth of only] a single palm tree. When the fifth sun appears, the water of the great ocean will decrease [by the height of] a person, and continue decreasing gradually until it has [a depth of only] seven persons. When the fifth sun appears and the remaining water in the ocean has [a depth of only] seven persons, it will again decrease gradually until it has [a depth of only] one person. When the fifth sun appears, the water in the ocean will decrease to the level of a person’s neck, to the level of the shoulders, of the waist, of the hips, of the knees, to the level of the ankles, and [eventually] there will be

a time when the water of the ocean will be completely exhausted, being not sufficient to submerge [even] one finger. This is why [I say that] all formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations; one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them. Again, there will be a time when a sixth sun appears in the world. When the sixth sun appears, the whole great earth, together with Meru, king of mountains, will be totally submerged in smoke, a single mass of smoke. Just as a potter’s kiln, at the time of being ignited, is totally sub- merged in smoke, a single mass of smoke—in the same way, when the sixth sun appears, the whole great earth, together with Meru, king of mountains, will be totally submerged in smoke, a single mass of smoke. This is why [I say that] all formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them. Again, there will be a time when a seventh sun appears in the world. When the seventh sun appears, the whole great earth, together with Meru, king of mountains, will be all ablaze, intensely hot, a single mass of flame. In this way, when the seventh sun appears and the whole great earth, together with Meru, king of mountains, is all ablaze, intensely hot, a single mass of flame, [then] the wind will carry the flames even up to the Brahmā world. Then the gods of radiance, who have just been born as gods and have never experienced, seen, or known the world’s [cyclic] creation and destruction, on seeing that great fire will all be terrified, with their hair standing on end, and will think: “The fire will not reach up to here, will it? The fire will not reach up to here, will it?” Those who were born as gods at an earlier time and have experienced, seen, and known the world’s [cyclic] creation and destruction will, on seeing that great fire, calm the distress of those gods, telling them, “Don’t be afraid! That fire is of such a nature that it will not reach up to here.”

When the seventh sun appears, Meru, king of mountains, will col lapse, will be completely destroyed and cease to be, [decreasing in height by] one hundred leagues, two hundred leagues, three hundred leagues, and so on until [decreasing in height by] seven hundred leagues, it will be completely destroyed and cease to be. When the seventh sun appears, Meru, king of mountains, together with this great earth, will be burned to destruction and extinction, with not even ash remaining.^61 Just as hot ghee or oil that is cooked or fried until it is completely exhausted and not even smoke or soot remains, in the same way, when the seventh sun appears, Meru, king of moun tains, together with the great earth, will be [exhausted] with not even ash remaining. This is why [I say that] all formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them. I have now told you that Meru, king of mountains, will collapse and be completely destroyed. Who can believe this? Only those who have seen the truth. I have now told you that the water of the great ocean will be exhausted and eliminated. Who can believe this? Only those who have seen the truth. I have now told you that the whole great earth will be burnt up and eliminated. Who can believe this? Only those who have seen the truth. Why is that? Monks, in ancient times there was a great teacher called Sunetta. He was the teacher of a school of non-Buddhist seers. Abandoning sensual desire, he had attained the bases of supernormal powers. The great teacher Sunetta had countless hundreds of thousands of disciples. The great teacher Sunetta gave his disciples teachings about [the way to] the Brahmā world. When the great teacher Sunetta gave teachings about the [way to] the Brahmā world, some of his disciples did not adequately put his teaching into practice.

At the end of life, some of them were reborn among the four great kings, some were reborn among the thirty-three gods, some were reborn among the Yama gods, some were reborn among the Tusita gods, some were reborn among the gods who delight in creating, and some were reborn among the gods who delight in the creations of others. If, when the great teacher Sunetta gave teachings about the [way to] the Brahmā world, all the disciples had remembered them well, they would have practiced the four divine abodes and, overcoming sensual desire, would, at the end of life, have attained rebirth in the Brahmā world. At that time the great teacher Sunetta had this thought, “In my next life I should not be reborn in the same place as my disciples. I would now rather develop and cultivate loving-kindness.” Having developed and cultivated loving-kindness, at the end of life he attained rebirth among the gods of radiance. At that time, the great teacher Sunetta developed and cultivated loving-kindness, and, having developed and cultivated loving-kindness, at the end of life I attained rebirth among the gods of radiance. The practice of the path by the great teacher Sunetta and his disciples was not in vain; they obtained great reward. Monks, what do you think? The great teacher in ancient times called Sunetta, who was the teacher of a school of non-Buddhist seers and who, overcoming sensual desire, attained the bases of supernormal powers, do you think this was someone else? Do not think that. Know that it was me. At that time I was called Sunetta, a great teacher, the leader of a school of non-Buddhist seers. Overcoming sensual desire, I attained supernormal powers. I had countless hundreds of thousands of disciples. I gave my disciples teachings about [the way to] the Brahmā world. When I gave teachings about the [way to] the Brahmā world, not all of my disciples adequately put my teaching into practice. At the end of life, some were reborn among the four great kings, some were reborn among the thirty-three gods, some were reborn among the Yama gods, some were reborn among the Tusita gods, some were reborn among the gods who delight in creating, and some were reborn among the

gods who delight in the creations of others. When I gave teachings about the [way to] the Brahmā world, if all of my disciples had put my teaching into practice, they would have developed the four divine abodes and, overcoming sensual desire, at the end of life they would have attained rebirth in the Brahmā world. At that time I had this thought, “It is not proper for me to be reborn in the next world in the same realm as my disciples. I would now rather develop and cultivate loving-kindness.” Having developed and culti- vated loving-kindness, at the end of life, I attained rebirth among the gods of radiance. Later, I developed and cultivated loving-kindness and, having developed and cultivated loving-kindness, at the end of life attained rebirth among the gods of radiance. The practice of the path by me and my disciples was not in vain; we obtained great reward. At that time I personally practiced that path, which was of benefit to myself and of benefit to others, benefiting many people, out of com- passion for the world, seeking the advantage and benefit of gods and human beings, seeking their peace and happiness. The teaching I gave at that time did not lead to the ultimate, was not the ultimate purity, not the ultimate holy life, not the ultimate completion of the holy life. At that time I was not able to abandon birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and distress. I was not able to attain complete liberation from suffering. But now, monks, I have appeared in the world as a Tathāgata, free from attachment,^62 fully awakened, endowed with knowledge and [good] conduct, well gone, a knower of the world, an unsurpassable being, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed,^63 teacher of gods and human beings, called Buddha, protector of the world. I now benefit myself and benefit others, benefit many people. Out of compassion for the world I seek the advantage and benefit of gods and human beings, seek [their] peace and happiness. The teaching I now give leads to the ultimate, is the ultimate purity, the ultimate completion of the holy life. I have now abandoned birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and distress. I have now attained complete liberation from suffering. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
