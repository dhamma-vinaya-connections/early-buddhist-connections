### 150. The Discourse to Esukārī

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. At that time the brahmin Esukārī, while roaming around in the afternoon, approached the Buddha. Having exchanged friendly greetings, he stepped back, sat to one side, and said, “Gotama, I have a question that I would like to ask. Will you listen if I venture to express it?” The World-honored One said, “Brahmin, feel free to ask.” Then the brahmin Esukārī asked: Gotama, the brahmins declare four types of service for the four castes. They declare service for brahmins, and they declare service for warriors, merchants, and workers. Gotama, the brahmins declare [these types of] service for brahmins: a brahmin should serve a brahmin; a warrior, a

merchant, and a worker should serve a brahmin. Gotama, these four castes should serve a brahmin. Gotama, the brahmins declare [these types of] service for warriors: a warrior should serve a warrior; a merchant and a worker should serve a warrior. Gotama, these three castes should serve a warrior. Gotama, the brahmins declare [these types of] service for merchants: a merchant should serve a merchant and a worker should serve a merchant. Gotama, these two castes should serve a merchant. Gotama, the brahmins declare [this type of] service for workers: a worker should serve a worker. Who else is so low that they should be declared to serve a worker? Only a worker serves a worker.

The World-honored One asked:

Brahmin, do the brahmins themselves know what four types of service to declare for the four castes, so that they declare service for brahmins and declare service for warriors, merchants, and workers?^161

The brahmin Esukārī replied:

They do not know, Gotama; but the brahmins themselves make this state- ment, “In this world with its _deva_ s and _māra_ s, Brahmās, renunciants, brahmins, from human beings to _deva_ s, we brahmins, [although] not knowing ourselves what four types of service to declare for the four castes, [nevertheless] declare service for brahmins, and declare service for warriors, merchants, and workers.”

The World-honored One said:

Brahmin, it is just as if a person were to force a piece of meat on another saying, “Good man, eat this and pay me the of it!”^162 Brahmin, what you say on behalf of the brahmins is just like that. Why is that? The brahmins themselves do not know what four types of service to declare for the four castes, [yet] they declare service for brahmins and they declare service for warriors, merchants, and workers.

The World-honored One asked:

Brahmin, how should one do service? If there is service [to be done], and

if because of that service one remains the same and does not become better, should one do such service? If there is service [to be done], and if because of that service one becomes better and does not remain the same, should one do such service? Brahmin, if one serves a brahmin, and if because of that service one remains the same and does not become better, should one do such service? If one serves a warrior, a merchant, a worker, and if because of that service one remains the same and does not become better, should one do such service? Brahmin, if one serves a brahmin, and if because of that service one becomes better and does not remain the same, should one do such service? If one serves a warrior, a merchant, [or] a worker, and if because of that service one becomes better and does not remain the same, should one do such service?^163 The brahmin Esukārī replied: Gotama, if I serve [someone], and if because of that service I remain the same and do not become better, then I should not serve them. If I serve [someone] and if because of that service I become better and do not remain the same, then I should serve them. Gotama, if I serve a brahmin and if because of that service I remain the same and do not become better, then I should not serve them. If I serve a warrior, a merchant, or a worker, and if because of that service I remain the same and do not become better, then I should not serve them. Gotama, if I serve a brahmin and if because of that service I become better and do not remain the same, then I should serve them. If I serve a warrior, a merchant, or a worker and if because of that service I become better and do not remain the same, then I should serve them. The World-honored One said: Brahmin, suppose that another brahmin were to come by, one who is not stupid, not deluded, not deranged, who does not have a deranged mind, who is free and unrestrained, and I were to ask him, “Brahmin, what do you think? If there is service [to be done], and if because of that service one remains the same and does not become better, should one do such service?

If there is service [to be done], and if because of that service one becomes better and does not remain the same, should one do such service? “Brahmin, if one serves a brahmin and if because of that service one remains the same and does not become better, should one do such service? If one serves a warrior, a merchant, or a worker, and if because of that service one remains the same and does not become better, should one do such service? “Brahmin, if one serves a brahmin and if because of that service one becomes better and does not remain the same, should one do such service? If one serves a warrior, a merchant, or a worker, and if because of that service one becomes better and does not remain the same, should one do such service?” Brahmin, that [other] brahmin, who is not stupid, not deluded, not deranged, who does not have a deranged mind, who is free and unre- strained, would answer me, “Gotama, if I serve [someone], and if because of that service I remain the same and do not become better, then I should not serve them. If I serve [someone], and if because of that service I become better and do not remain the same, then I should serve them. “Gotama, if I serve a brahmin and if because of that service I remain the same and do not become better, then I should not serve them. If I serve a warrior, a merchant, or a worker, and if because of that service I remain the same and do not become better, then I should not serve them. “Gotama, if I serve a brahmin, and if because of that service I become better and do not remain the same, then I should serve them. If I serve a warrior, a merchant, a worker, and if because of that service I become better and do not remain the same, then I should serve them.”

The World-honored One said:

Brahmin, what do you think?^164 If there is service [to be done], and if because of that service one loses faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then should one do such service? If there is service [to be done], and if because of that service one increases in faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then should one do such service? Brahmin, if one serves a brahmin, and if because of that service one loses faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then should

one do such service? If one serves a warrior, a merchant, a worker, and if because of that service one loses faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then should one do such service? Brahmin if one serves a brahmin, and if because of that service one increases in faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then should one do such service? If one serves a warrior, a merchant, a worker, and if because of that service one increases in faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then should one do such service? The brahmin Esukārī replied: Gotama, if I serve [someone], and if because of that service I lose faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then I should not serve them. If I serve [someone], and if because of that service I increase in faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then I should serve them. Gotama, if I serve a brahmin, and if because of that service I lose faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then I should not serve them. If I serve a warrior, a merchant, a worker, and if because of that service I lose faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then I should not serve them. Gotama, if I serve a brahmin, and if because of that service I increase in faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then I should serve them. If I serve a warrior, a merchant, a worker, and if because of that service I increase in faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then I should serve them. The World-honored One said: Brahmin, suppose that another brahmin were to come by who is not stupid, not deluded, not deranged, who does not have a deranged mind, who is free and unrestrained, and I were to ask him, “Brahmin, what do you think?

If there is service [to be done], and if because of that service one increases in faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then should one do such service?

“Brahmin, if one serves a brahmin, and if because of that service one loses faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then should one do such service? If one serves a warrior, a merchant, a worker, and if because of that service one loses faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then should one do such service? “Brahmin, if one serves a brahmin, and if because of that service one increases in faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then should one do such service?

If I serve [someone], and if because of that service I increase in faith, morality, wide learning, gen- erosity, and wisdom, then I should serve them. “Gotama, if I serve a brahmin, and if because of that service I lose faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then I should not serve them. If I serve a warrior, a merchant, a worker, and if because of that service I lose faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then I should not serve them. “Gotama, if I serve a brahmin, and if because of that service I increase in faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then I should serve them. If I serve a warrior, a merchant, a worker, and if because of that service I increase in faith, morality, wide learning, generosity, and wisdom, then I should serve them.”

The brahmin Esukārī said:

Gotama, the brahmins declare for the four castes four types of property. They declare for brahmins their property, they declare for warriors... merchants... workers their property. And what, Gotama, do the brahmins declare for brahmins as their property? Gotama, the brahmins declare for brahmin begging as their property. If brahmins disdain begging, they are disdaining their property. Having

disdained their property, they consequently suffer loss. It is just as a cowherd who is unable to watch over his cows consequently suffers loss.^165 In the same way, Gotama, the brahmins declare for the brahmin begging as his property. If brahmins disdain begging, they are disdaining their property. Having disdained their property, they consequently suffer loss. Gotama, what do the brahmins declare for warriors as their property? Gotama, the brahmins declare for warriors the bow and arrow as their property. If a warrior disdains the bow and arrow, they are disdaining their property. Having disdained their property, they consequently suffer loss. It is just as a cowherd who is unable to watch over his cows suffers loss. In the same way, Gotama, the brahmins declare for the warriors the bow and arrow as their property. If warriors disdain the bow and arrow, they are disdaining their property. Having disdained their property, they con sequently suffer loss. Gotama, what do the brahmins declare for merchants as their property? Gotama, the brahmins declare for merchants farming as their property. If merchants disdain farming, they are disdaining their property. Having disdained their property, they consequently suffer loss. It is just as a cowherd who is unable to watch over his cows suffers loss. In the same way, Gotama, the brahmins declare for merchants farming as their property. If merchants disdain farming, they are disdaining their property. Having disdained their property, they consequently suffer loss. Gotama, what do the brahmins declare for workers as their property? Gotama, the brahmins declare for workers hemp as their property.^166 If workers disdain hemp, they disdaining their property. Having disdained their property, they consequently suffer loss. It is just as a cowherd who is unable to watch over his cows consequently suffers loss. In the same way, Gotama, the brahmins declare for workers hemp as their property. If workers disdain hemp, they are disdaining their property. Having dis dained their property, they consequently suffer loss. The World-honored One asked: Brahmin, do the brahmins themselves know what four types of property to declare for the four castes, so that they declare for brahmins their prop erty, declare for warrior... the merchants... workers their property?”^167

The brahmin Esukārī replied:

They do not know, Gotama; but the brahmins themselves make this state- ment, “In this world with its _deva_ s and _māra_ s, Brahmās, renunciants, brahmins, from human beings to _deva_ s, we brahmins, [although] not knowing ourselves what four types of property to declare for the four castes, [nevertheless] declare property for the brahmin, and declare property for the warrior... the merchant... the worker.”

The World-honored One said:

Brahmin, it is just as if a person were to force a piece of meat on another and say, “Good man, eat it, and you must give me the price of it!” Brahmin, what you say on behalf of the brahmins is just like this. Why is that? The brahmins themselves do not know what four types of property to declare for the four castes, [yet] they declare for brahmins their property, and they declare for warriors... merchants... workers their property. Brahmin, having in this way myself come to understand well and know well all principles, I declare to people the principle of appeasement, the principle of complete cessation, the principle of the path to awakening, and the principle of good progress [in the practice].^168 I declare [these] as their property.

The World-honored One asked:

Brahmin, what do you think? Is it only brahmins that are not affected by empty space, not bound by it, not touched by it, not obstructed by it, unlike warriors, merchants, and workers?^169

The brahmin Esukārī replied:

Gotama, brahmins are not affected by empty space, not bound by it, not touched by it, not obstructed by it—and for warriors, merchants, and workers it is the same.

[The World-honored One said]:

Brahmin, having myself come to understand well and know well all prin- ciples, I declare to people the principle of appeasement, the principle of

complete cessation, the principle of the path to awakening, and the principle of good progress [in the practice]. I declare [these] as their property. The World-honored One asked: Brahmin, what do you think? Is it only brahmins who are able to dwell with a mind of loving-kindness, without fetters, without resentment, without ill will, without contention—unlike warriors, merchants, and workers? The brahmin Esukārī replied: Gotama, brahmins are able to dwell with a mind of loving-kindness, with out fetters, without resentment, without ill will, without contention—and for warriors, merchants, and workers it is the same. [The World-honored One said]: Brahmin, having myself come to understand well and know well all prin ciples, I declare for people the principle of appeasement, the principle of complete cessation, the principle of the path to awakening, and the principle of good progress [in the practice]. I declare [these] as their property. The World-honored One asked: Brahmin, what do you think? Suppose that one hundred types of people were to come by and someone were to tell them, “Come, all of you. Only those of you who are born into the warrior caste or the brahmin caste are able, by taking soap powder and going to bathe in the water, to get rid of your dirt and to become fully clean.”^170 Brahmin, what do you think? Are [only] those from the warrior caste or the brahmin caste able, by taking soap powder and going to bathe in the water, to get rid of their dirt and to become fully clean? Are those from the merchant caste or the worker caste not able, by taking soap powder and going to bathe in the water, to get rid of their dirt and to become fully clean? [Or] are all one hundred types of people able, by taking soap powder and going to bathe in the water, to get rid of their dirt and to become fully clean? The brahmin Esukārī replied:

Gotama, all one hundred types of people are able, by taking soap powder and going to bathe in the water, to get rid of their dirt and to become fully clean.

[The World-honored One said]:

Brahmin, having in this way myself come to understand well and know well all principles, I declare for people the principle of appeasement, the principle of complete cessation, the principle of the path to awakening, and the principle of good progress [in the practice]. I declare [these] as their property.

The World-honored One asked:

Brahmin, what do you think? Suppose that one hundred types of people were to come by and someone were to tell them, “Come, all of you. Only those of you who are born in the warrior caste or the brahmin caste are able, by using totally dry _sāla_ wood and sandalwood as a fire base and drilling it with a drill, to produce fire and to make it grow.” Brahmin, what do you think? Is it that [only] those from the warrior caste or the brahmin caste would be able, by using totally dry _sāla_ wood and sandalwood as a fire base and drilling it with a drill, to produce fire and to make it grow? Is it that those from the merchant caste or the worker caste [would be unable], by using a dried-out pig trough or dog trough or castor oil wood or some other inferior wood as a fire base and drilling it with a drill, to produce fire and to make it grow? [Or] is it that all one hun- dred types of people would be able, by using various kinds of wood as a fire base and drilling it with a drill, to produce fire and to make it grow?

The brahmin Esukārī replied:

Gotama, all of those one hundred types of people would be able, by using various kinds of wood as a fire base and drilling it with a drill, to produce fire and to make it grow.

[The World-honored One said:]

Brahmin, having in this way myself come to understand well and know well all principles, I declare for people the principle of appeasement, the

principle of complete cessation, the principle of the path to awakening, and the principle of good progress [in the practice]. I declare [these] as their property. The World-honored One asked: Brahmin, what do you think? If all of those one hundred types of people, using various kinds of wood as a fire base and drilling it with a drill, were to produce fire and to make it grow, then would all those fires have flames, color, heat, and light, and would they all be capable of fulfilling the func tions of fire? [Or] is it that only some of the fires would have flames, color, heat, and light, and be capable of fulfilling the functions of fire? Is it that some of the fires would have no flames, no color, no heat, no light, and would not be capable of fulfilling the functions of fire? [Or] is it that all the fires would have flames, color, heat, light, and that they would all be capable of fulfilling the functions of fire? The brahmin Esukārī replied: Gotama, if all of those one hundred types of people, by using various kinds of wood as a fire base and drilling it with a drill, were to produce fire and to make it grow, then all of the fires would have flames, color, heat, light, and all of them would be capable of fulfilling the functions of fire. That only some [of the fires] would have flames, color, heat, light and be capable of fulfilling the functions of fire—that is not possible. That only some [of the fires] would have no flames, no color, no heat, no light, and would not be capable of fulfilling the functions of fire—that too is not possible. Gotama, all those fires would have flames, color, heat, and light, and all of them would be capable of fulfilling the functions of fire. [The World-honored One said:] Brahmin, having in this way myself come to understand well and know well all principles, I declare for people the principle of appeasement, the principle of complete cessation, the principle of the path to awakening, and the principle of good progress [in the practice]. I declare [these] as their property.

The World-honored One asked: Brahmin, what do you think? Suppose that all of those one hundred types of people, using various kinds of wood as a fire base and drilling it with a drill, were to produce fire and to make it grow; and one of them were to fuel their fire with dry grass and wood and produce flames, color, heat, and smoke. Would there be differences between [those] flames, color, heat, and smoke and the flames, color, heat, and smoke [of the others]?^171 The brahmin Esukārī replied: Gotama, if all of those one hundred types of people, using various kinds of wood as a fire base and drilling it with a drill, were to produce fire and to make it grow; and if one of those people were to fuel their fire with dry grass and wood and produce flames, color, heat, and smoke, then I would not be able to declare any difference between the flames, color, heat, and smoke of that fire and the flames, color, heat, and smoke [of the others]. The World-honored One said: Brahmin, it is the same with the fire that I acquired, the diligence that I acquired. It is able to eliminate negligence and also conceit, yet I cannot declare any [corresponding] difference in this fire. The brahmin Esukārī said: World-honored One, I have understood. Well-gone One, I have compre- hended. World-honored One, from now on I go for refuge to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha of monks. May the World-honored One accept me as a lay disciple from this day forth until the end of life, as having personally gone for refuge for my whole life. Thus said the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the brahmin Esukārī was delighted and received it respectfully.
