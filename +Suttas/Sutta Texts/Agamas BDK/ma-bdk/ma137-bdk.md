### 137. The Discourse on the World

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: The Tathāgata has himself awakened to the world and expounds it to others. The Tathāgata has understood the world. The Tathāgata has himself awakened to the arising of the world and expounds it to others. The Tathāgata has abandoned the arising of the world.

The Tathāgata has himself awakened to the cessation of the world and expounds it to others. The Tathāgata has realized the cessation of the world. The Tathāgata has himself awakened to the path [leading to the ces- sation] of the world and expounds it to others. The Tathāgata has developed the path [leading to the cessation] of the world. If there is [anyone who] is completely and fully correct about all things, then it is he, the Tathāgata, who has understood, seen, awakened to, and attained everything. Why is that? From the night in the past, when the Tathāgata awakened to the unsur- passable right and complete awakening, up until the night in the present when he will attain complete extinction in the remainderless nirvana element, throughout this period whatever is spoken by the Tathāgata, either on his own account or in response to others, all of that is true, not false, not departing from reality, not confused. It is the truth and is indeed correct.^86 If [people] speak of “the Lion,” you should know that they are speaking of the Tathāgata.^87 Why is that? What the Tathāgata declares in assemblies is known as “the lion’s roar.” In the entire world, with its _deva_ s, _māra_ s, Brahmās, renunciants, and brahmins, from human beings to _deva_ s, the Tathāgata has the status of Brahmā. The Tathāgata has attained coolness, being without vexation and without heat. He is possessed of truth and devoid of falsity.^88

Then the World-honored One uttered these verses:

Knowing the entire world, Surpassing the entire world, He expounds the entire world, The entire world as it really is.

The supremely and highly regarded hero, Able to untie all bonds, He has put an end to all karma, And is totally liberated from birth and death.

Whether _deva_ or human being, Those who take lifelong refuge in the Buddha

Bow their heads in homage to the Tathāgata, Who is very profound, like the great ocean. Knowing this, one also practices reverence. The _deva_ s and _gandhabba_ s Also bow their heads in homage, And follow him until death. Bowing their heads in homage to the Wise One, They take lifelong refuge in the supreme human being, Who is without grief, free of defilements, at peace, Unobstructed, totally liberated.^89 For the purpose of delighting in meditation, Dwell secluded, becoming fully concentrated. You should be your own lamp, [Thinking,] “I must not waste time!” Those who waste time experience grief and worry, That is, they fall into hell. Thus said the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
