### 61. The Discourse with the Cow Dung Parable

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time, a monk, who was sitting in meditation reflecting in a quiet place, had this thought:

Is there any form that is eternal and unchanging, is entirely pleasant, and exists forever? Is there any feeling, any perception, any volitional formation, any consciousness that is eternal and unchanging, is entirely pleasant, and exists forever? Then, in the evening, that monk rose from sitting in meditation, approached the Buddha, made obeisance with his head [at the Buddha’s feet], and sat down to one side. He said: World-honored One, today I was sitting in meditation in a quiet place, reflecting, and I had this thought: Is there any material form that is eternal and unchanging, is entirely pleasant, and exists forever? Is there any feeling, any perception, any volitional formation, any consciousness that is eternal and unchanging, is entirely pleasant, and exists forever? The Buddha told the monk: There is no material form that is eternal and unchanging, is entirely pleasant, and exists forever. There is no feeling, no perception, no voli tional formation, no consciousness that is eternal and unchanging, is entirely pleasant, and exists forever. Then the World-honored One took up a little bit of cow dung with his fingernail, and said, “Monk, do you see the little bit of cow dung that I have taken up with my fingernail?” The monk said, “Yes, World-honored One. I see it.” The Buddha further told the monk: [Small as this is], there is not even such a small amount of material form that is eternal and unchanging, is entirely pleasant, and exists forever. [Small as this is], there is not even such a small amount of feeling, of perception, of volitional formations, of consciousness that is eternal and unchanging, is entirely pleasant, and exists forever. Why is that? Monk, I recall how, in the distant past, I practiced meritorious deeds for a long time. Having practiced meritorious deeds for a long time, I experienced pleasant results for a long time. Monk,

[because] in the distant past I had practiced loving-kindness for seven years, I did not come to [be born in] this world for seven cosmic periods of emergence and destruction. When the world went to destruction, I was born into the heaven of radiance. When the world emerged [again], I descended to take birth in a vacant Brahmā palace. Among the Brahmās [there] I was the Great Brahmā, being the self-created heavenly king over other places for a thousand cosmic periods. [Again,] I was Sakka, king of the gods, for thirty-six cosmic periods, and I was the _khattiya_ king Mandhātu for countless cosmic periods. Monk, when I was the _khattiya_ king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand great elephants, equipped with fine chariot equipment, dec- orated with various treasures, with white pearls and jade, the chief of which was the royal elephant, Uposatha. Monk, when I was the _khattiya_ king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand horses equipped with fine chariot equipment, decorated with various treasures, gold and silver entwined with jade, the chief of which was the royal horse Valāhaka. Monk, when I was the _khattiya_ king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand chariots, decorated with four kinds of ornaments and various beautiful things, such as the hides of lions, tigers, and leopards, woven with decorations of varied colors and various decorations, very fast chariots, the chief of which was the chariot Vejayanta. Monk, when I was the _khattiya_ king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand cities, very large and pleasant, with many inhabitants, the chief of which was Kusāvatī. Monk, when I was the _khattiya_ king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand multistoried buildings, made of four kinds of precious mate- rial, gold, silver, beryl, and crystal, the chief of which was the Su - dhamma Hall. Monk, when I was the _khattiya_ king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand thrones, made of four kinds of precious materials, gold, silver, beryl, and crystal, and upholstered with woolen textiles, draped with brocades and fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted coverlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends.

Monk, when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand suits of clothing: clothing of flax, clothing of brocade, clothing of silk, clothing of cotton, and clothing of antelope hide. Monk, when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand women, each with a splendid, clear, bright, fresh body, of extraordinary beauty, exceeding human [beauty], almost divine [beauty], dignified beauty that delighted those who saw it, adorned with various treasures and necklaces of jade and pearl for dignified decoration, pure khattiya women, as well as countless women from other castes. Monk, when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand kinds of food, served day and night constantly for me to eat when I wished. Monk, of those eighty-four thousand kinds of food there was one that was particularly delicious and fresh, with numerous flavors, which I often ate. Monk, of those eighty-four thousand women there was one khattiya woman, the most dignified and beautiful, who often waited on me. Monk, of those eighty-four thousand suits of clothes there was one suit, of flax or brocade or silk or cotton or antelope hide, that I often wore. Monk, of those eighty-four thousand thrones there was one throne, of gold or silver or beryl or crystal, upholstered with woolen textiles, draped with brocade or fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted coverlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends, on which I often sat. Monk, of those eighty-four thousand multistoried buildings, there was one [made of] gold or of silver or of beryl or of crystal, called the Sudhamma Hall, in which I often stayed. Monk, of those eighty-four thousand cities there was one, very wealthy and pleasant, with many inhabitants, named Kusāvatī, in which I often resided. Monk, of those eighty-four thousand chariots there was one, dec orated with various beautiful things such as the hide of lions, tigers, and leopards, woven with designs of varied colors, a chariot that was very fast, named Vejayanta, that I often rode in when visiting pleasure parks.

Monk, of those eighty-four thousand horses there was one, with bluish body and crow-like head, the royal horse named Valāhaka that I often rode when visiting pleasure parks. Monk, of those eighty-four thousand elephants there was one whose entire body was very white and whose seven parts were perfect, the royal elephant named Uposatha that I often rode when visiting pleasure parks. Monk, I thought: The fruit and result of what kinds of action have caused me to be endowed today with [such] great supernormal power, great and mighty virtue, great merit, great and mighty power? Monk, again I thought: The fruits and results of three kinds of action cause me to be endowed today with [such] great supernormal power, great and mighty virtue, great merit, great and mighty power. The first is charitable giving, the second self-discipline, and the third restraint. Contemplate on it, monk: All of that, the whole of it, ceased to be. The supernormal power too was lost. What do you think, monk? Is material form permanent or impermanent? [The monk] answered, “It is impermanent, World-honored One.” [The Buddha] asked further, “If it is impermanent, is it suffering or not suffering?” [The monk] answered, “It is suffering, [since] it changes, World-honored One.” [The Buddha] asked further: “If it is impermanent, suffering and subject to change, would a learned noble disciple take it as: ‘This I am, this is mine, or I belong to that’?” [The monk] answered, “No, World-honored One.” [The Buddha] asked further, “What do you think, monk? Are feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness permanent or imper- manent?” [The monk] answered, “They are impermanent, World-honored One.”

[The Buddha] asked further, “If they are impermanent, are they suffering or not suffering?” [The monk] answered, “They are suffering since they change, World- honored One.” [The Buddha] asked further: If they are impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, would a learned noble disciple take them as: “This I am, this is mine, or I belong to that”? [The monk] answered, “No, World-honored One.” [The Buddha said:] Therefore, monk, you should train like this: Whatever there is of material form, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, good or bad, near or far—all that should be seen as it really is with wisdom thus: all that I am not, that is not mine, I do not belong to that. Whatever there is of feeling... of perception... of volitional formations... of consciousness, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, good or bad, near or far—all that should be seen as it really is with wisdom thus: all that I am not, that is not mine, I do not belong to that. If, monk, a learned noble disciple contemplates in this way, he becomes disenchanted with material form, he becomes disenchanted with feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness. Being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Having become dispassionate, he is liberated. Having been liberated, he knows that he is liberated. He knows as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence.” Then that monk, having heard what the Buddha said, received it well and kept it [in mind]. He rose from his seat, paid respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times and departed. Having received the Buddha’s instruction, that monk lived alone in a secluded place and practiced diligently, without negligence. Having lived

alone in a secluded place and practiced diligently, without negligence—he attained fully the summit of the holy life, for the sake of which a clansman shaves off his hair and beard, dons the yellow robe, leaves home out of faith, and goes forth to practice the path. In that very life, he personally attained understanding and awakening, and dwelled having personally realized. He knew as it really was: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence.” Thus that monk, having understood the Dharma (and so on up to), became an arahant. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
