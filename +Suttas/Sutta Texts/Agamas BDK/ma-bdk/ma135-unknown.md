### 135. The Discourse on Sujāta

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the Grove of Many Toads. At that time there was a householder’s son named Sujāta.^67 His father, when near to death, had passed on to him instructions regarding the six direc- tions, teaching him well and admonishing him well thus:^68

Sujāta, after my death you should pay homage to the six directions, extending your hands with joined palms, saying this, “Whatever sentient beings are in the east, I respect, serve, and revere them all. Since I have respected, served, and revered them all, they should also respect, serve, and revere me.” In the same way [say this]: “Whatever sentient beings are in the south ... in the west... in the north... at the nadir... at the zenith, I respect, serve, and revere them all. Since I have respected, served, and revered them all, they should also respect, serve, and revere me.”

Having heard his father’s instruction, the householder’s son Sujāta told his father, “Very well. I will do as you command.” Then, after his father’s death, the householder’s son Sujāta, having bathed at dawn, put on new linen clothes, took fresh kusa grass in his hand, and went to the water’s edge. He paid homage to the six directions, extending his hands with joined palms [saying], “Whatever sentient beings are in the east, I respect, serve, and revere them all. Since I have respected, served, and revered them all, they should also respect, serve, and revere me.” In the same way, “Whatever sentient beings are in the south... in the west... in the north... at the nadir... at the zenith, I respect, serve, and revere them all. Since I have respected, served, and revered them all, they should also respect, serve, and revere me.” At that time, the night being over, at dawn, the World-honored One put on his robes and took his bowl and went into Rājagaha to beg for almsfood. As the World-honored One was going into Rājagaha to beg for almsfood, he saw in the distance that the householder’s son Sujāta, having bathed at dawn, put on new linen clothes, and taken fresh kusa grass in his hand, had gone to the water’s edge. He was paying homage to the six directions, extending his hands with joined palms, saying, “Whatever sentient beings are in the east, I respect, serve, and revere them all. Since I have respected, served, and revered them all, they should also respect, serve, and revere me.” In the same way, “Whatever sentient beings are in the south... in the west... in the north... at the nadir... at the zenith, I respect, serve, and revere them all. Since I have respected, served, and revered them all, they should also respect, serve, and revere me.” Having seen this, the World-honored One went to the householder’s son Sujāta and asked him: Householder’s son, from which renunciant or brahmin have you received instruction on respecting, serving, and revering, that you have bathed at dawn, put on new linen clothes, taken fresh kusa grass in your hand, gone to the water’s edge, and paid homage to the six directions, extending your hands with joined palms [saying], “Whatever sentient beings are in the east, I respect, serve, and revere them all. Since I have respected, served, and revered them all, they should also respect, serve, and revere me.” In the

same way, “Whatever sentient beings are in the south... in the west... in the north... at the nadir... at the zenith, I respect, serve, and revere them all. Since I have respected, served, and revered them all, they should also respect, serve, and revere me”?

The householder’s son Sujāta answered:

World-honored One, I did not receive instruction from another renunciant or brahmin. World-honored One, when my father was near to death, he passed on to me instructions regarding the six directions, teaching me well and admonishing me well thus, “Sujāta, after my death you should pay homage to the six directions, extending your hands with joined palms [saying], ‘Whatever sentient beings are in the east, I respect, serve, and revere them all. Since I have respected, served, and revered them all, they should also respect, serve, and revere me.’ In the same way, ‘Whatever sentient beings are in the south... in the west... in the north... at the nadir... at the zenith, I respect, serve, and revere them all. Since I have respected, served, and revered them all, they should also respect, serve, and revere me.’” World-honored One, I received as my father’s legacy his instructions about how to respect, serve, and revere. Therefore, I bathe at dawn, put on new linen clothes, take fresh _kusa_ grass in my hand, and go to the water’s edge. I pay homage to the six directions, extending my hands with joined palms [saying], “Whatever sentient beings are in the east, I respect, serve, and revere them all. Since I have respected, served, and revered them, they should also respect, serve, and revere me.” In the same way, “Whatever sentient beings are in the south... in the west... in the north... at the nadir... at the zenith, I respect, serve, and revere them all. Since I have respected, served, and revered them all, they should also respect, serve, and revere me.”

Having heard this, the World-honored One said:

Householder’s son, I affirm the existence of the six directions; I do not deny it.^69 Householder’s son, if a person is able to differentiate skillfully the six directions and to separate themselves from the defilement of evil and unwholesome actions in the four directions, then they will be worthy

of respect and reverence in the present; and on the breaking up of their body after death they will certainly go to a good realm of existence, being reborn in heaven. Householder’s son, for sentient beings there are four types of action, four types of defilement. What are the four? Householder’s son, killing living beings is a type of action of sentient beings, a type of defilement. Taking what is not given... sexual misconduct... false speech is a type of action of sentient beings, a type of defilement. Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: Killing living beings, taking what is not given, Sexual misconduct with another’s wife, And saying what is not true, These the wise do not praise. Householder’s son, owing to four causes, a person will acquire much guilt. What are the four? They are: acting from desire, acting from hatred, acting from fear, and acting from ignorance. Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: Acting from desire, hatred, fear, and ignorance, Evilly, contrary to the Dharma, One will certainly destroy one’s reputation, Like the vanishing of the waning moon. Householder’s son, owing to four causes, a person will acquire much merit. What are the four? They are: not acting from desire, not acting from hatred, not acting from fear, and not acting from ignorance. Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: Discarding desire, being without hatred and fear, Acting without ignorance, acting in accordance with the Dharma, One’s reputation comes to be known everywhere, Like the gradual filling out of the waxing moon. Householder’s son, you should know that for one pursuing wealth there are six wrong paths. What are the six? The first wrong path for one pursuing

wealth is indulging in various kinds of gambling. The second wrong path for one pursuing wealth is roaming [the streets] at unseemly times. The third wrong path for one pursuing wealth is drinking intoxicating liquor [which leads to] negligence. The fourth wrong path for one pursuing wealth is associating with bad friends. The fifth wrong path for one pur- suing wealth is constant fondness for entertainment. The sixth wrong path for one pursuing wealth is laziness. Householder’s son, if a person indulges in various kinds of gambling, one should know that there are six dangers inherent in that. What are the six? First, defeat gives rise to resentment; second, loss gives rise to humil- iation; third, defeat leads to uneasy sleep; fourth, one’s enemies feel happy; fifth, one’s family members feel unhappy; sixth, what one says in assem- blies is not believed.^70 Householder’s son, a person who indulges in gam- bling will neglect their business, and if they neglect the business, it will not be successful. They will be unable to gain new wealth not yet gained, and their existing wealth will be used up. Householder’s son, if a person roams [the streets] at unseemly times, one should know that there are six dangers inherent in that. What are the six? First, they leave themselves unprotected; second, they leave their wealth unprotected; third, he leaves his wife unprotected;^71 fourth, they are suspected by others; fifth, they are subject to many miseries; sixth, they are condemned by others. Householder’s son, a person who roams [the streets] at unseemly times will neglect their business, and if they neg- lect their business, it will not be successful. They will be unable to gain new wealth not yet gained, and the existing wealth will be used up. Householder’s son, if a person drinks intoxicating liquor [which leads to] negligence, one should know that there are six dangers inherent in that. [What are the six?] First, loss of one’s present wealth; second, [sus- ceptibility] to much illness; third, increased quarreling; fourth, indecent exposure; fifth, gaining a bad reputation; sixth, loss of wisdom and the arising of ignorance. Householder’s son, a person who drinks intoxicating liquor and becomes negligent will neglect their business, and if they neglect their business, it will not be successful. They will be unable to gain new wealth not yet gained, and the existing wealth will be used up.

Householder’s son, if a person associates with bad friends, one should know that there are six dangers inherent in that. What are the six? First, companionship with thieves; second, companionship with swindlers; third, companionship with drunkards; fourth, companionship with people of loose character; fifth, pursuit of fun and games; sixth, regarding these [above-mentioned people] as one’s intimates. Regarding these as one’s intimates, householder’s son, a person who associates with bad friends will neglect their business, and if they neglect their business, it will not succeed. They will be unable to gain new wealth not yet gained, and their existing wealth will be used up. Householder’s son, if a person delights in entertainment, one should know that there are six dangers inherent in that. What are the six? First, fondness for listening to singing; second, fondness for watching dancers; third, fondness for going after amusement; fourth, fondness for watching the playing of bells; fifth, fondness for hand-clapping; sixth, fondness for big crowds and gatherings. Householder’s son, a person who delights in entertainment will neglect their business, and if they neglect their business, it will not be successful. They will be unable to gain new wealth not yet gained, and their existing wealth will be used up. Householder’s son, a person who is lazy should know that there are six dangers inherent in that. What are the six? First, [saying] “It’s too early,” they do not work; second, [saying] “It’s too late,” they do not work; third, [saying] “It’s too cold,” they do not work; fourth, [saying] “It’s too hot,” they do not work; fifth, [saying] “I’m too full,” they do not work; sixth, [saying] “I’m too hungry,” they do not work. Householder’s son, a person who is lazy will neglect their business, and if they neglect their business, it will not be successful. They will be unable to gain new wealth not yet gained, and their existing wealth will be used up. Then the World-honored One spoke these verses:^72 The various kinds of gambling, [roaming] in search of sex, Addiction to intoxicating liquor, delighting in entertainment, Keeping company with bad friends, Laziness and not doing one’s work,

Dissipation and lack of self-guarding— These situations destroy a person.

Going and coming without self-guarding, Sexual misconduct with another’s wife, A mind constantly fettered by resentment, Wishful seeking for what is unbeneficial, Drinking intoxicating liquor, thinking of women and sex— These things destroy a person.

Recurrent unwholesome behavior, Violence, rejection of others’ guidance, Insulting renunciants and brahmins, Confusion, holding wrong views, Brutality and doing black deeds— These things destroy a person.

Self-inflicted deprivation and poverty, Drinking intoxicating liquor, indecent exposure, With debt [unending] like a spring of water, Will certainly ruin the family.

Frequenting liquor shops, Associating with bad friends, They fail to earn the wealth they should, Regarding [bad] companionship as enjoyable.

Having many bad friends, Constantly keeping bad company, In this world and the future world, In both they will come to ruin.

A person who practices evil comes to decline; One who practices good comes to prosperity. One who practices for achievement comes to increase; Therefore, one should practice for achievement.

One who practices ascending gets to ascend,

Constantly gaining wisdom and ascending. In turn they achieve pure morality And ascend in what is subtle and sublime. By one who likes to sleep in the daytime, And likes roaming about at night, Who is negligent and constantly drinking liquor, Family life cannot be maintained. “It is too cold!” or “It is too hot!”, So says the lazy person. In the end they do not succeed in their business; Ultimately they get no financial profit. If [however], cold and heat Are not reckoned with, being like [mere] straws, A person doing their work in this way Will never lack happiness. Householder’s son, there are four enemies who have the appearance of friends. What are the four? The first enemy who has the appearance of a friend is one who knows about your affairs; the second enemy who has the appearance of a friend is a flatterer; the third enemy who has the appearance of a friend is one who is all talk [and no action]; the fourth enemy who has the appearance of a friend is a bad companion. Householder’s son, for four reasons one who knows about your affairs is an enemy who has the appearance of a friend. What are the four? First, knowing about your affairs, they carry off your property; second, while giving little, they take a lot; third, they may exploit your fears; fourth, they become intimate for [their own] benefit. Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: A person who uses their knowledge of your affairs, Who speaks in a very gentle way, [Who exploits your] fears, [or] who becomes intimate for [their own] benefit, Know them as enemies who resemble a friend.

You should always keep far away from them, As [you would from] a terrifying path.

Householder’s son, for four reasons the flatterer is an enemy who has the appearance of a friend. What are the four? First, they hold you back from doing good; second, they incite you to do evil; third, they praise you to your face; fourth, behind your back they speak ill of you.

Then the World-honored One spoke these verses:

If [someone] holds you back from fine wholesome things, [Or] incites you to do what is evil and unwholesome, [Or] praises you to your face [But] behind your back speaks ill of you; If you know [the distinction between] good and evil And also recognize these two kinds of talk, [Then you know that] this [seeming] friend should not be befriended.

Knowing that person to be like this, You should always keep far away from them, As [you would from] a terrifying path.

Householder’s son, for four reasons the one who is all talk [and no action] is an enemy who has the appearance of a friend. What are the four? First, that person reminds you of their support in the past; second, they keep promising future support; third, they speak what is void or untrue; fourth, their present support will certainly disappear, as they say, “I will do it” but do not do it.

Then the World-honored One spoke these verses:

[If someone] reminds you of their past [support] and [promises] future [support]; [If someone] talks empty words and his present support disappears, [If someone says,] “I will do it” [but then] does not do as they have said, Then know them as an enemy who resembles a friend. You should always keep far away from them, As [you would from] a terrifying path.

Householder’s son, for four reasons a bad companion is an enemy who has the appearance of a friend. What are the four? First, they incite you to engage in various kinds of gambling; second, they incite you to roam [the streets] at unseemly times; third, they incite you to drink liquor; fourth, they incite you to associate with bad friends. Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: Incited to various kinds of gambling, Incited to drink liquor, or to commit adultery, Practicing what is low, not practicing what is supreme, You will decline, like the waning moon. You should always keep far away from them, As you would from a terrifying path.^73 Householder’s son, as to good friends, you should know that they are of four kinds. What are the four? First, one who is the same in bad and good [times] should be recognized as a good friend; second, one who is com passionate [toward you] should be recognized as a good friend; third, one who seeks what is advantageous [to you] should be recognized as a good friend; fourth, one who greatly benefits [you] should be recognized as a good friend.^74 Householder’s son, for four reasons one who is the same in bad and good [times] should be recognized as a good friend. What are the four? First, they will give themselves up for you; second, they will give up their wealth for you; third, they will give up their spouse for you; fourth, they are patient with what you say [to them]. Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: One who will give up their desired property or spouse, Who is able to be patient with what you say [to them], Knowing them to be a friend who is the same in bad and good [times], A wise person should associate [with them]. Householder’s son, for four reasons one who is compassionate [toward you] should be recognized as a good friend. What are the four? First, they incite

in you sublime states; second, they restrain you from evil states; third, they praise you to your face; fourth, they protect you from your enemies.

Then the World-honored One spoke these verses:

One who incites in you what is good and wholesome, who restrains you from evil, Who praises you to your face, and who protects you from your enemies— You should know them as a good friend who is compassionate [toward you]. A wise person should associate with [such a person].

Householder’s son, for four reasons one who seeks what is of advantage [to you] should be recognized as a good friend. What are the four? First, they reveal their secrets [to you]; second, they do not conceal any secrets [from you]; third, they delight in what is to [your] advantage; fourth, they are not distressed about what is not to their advantage.

Then the World-honored One spoke these verses:

One who tells you their secrets and does not conceal them, Who delights in what is to your advantage and is not distressed by what is not, Know them as a good friend who seeks [your] advantage. A wise person should associate [with them].

Householder’s son, for four reasons one who greatly benefits you should be recognized as a good friend. What are the four? First, they know when your property is exhausted; second, knowing that your property is exhausted, they give you property; third, they teach and admonish you when they see you being negligent; fourth, they are always compassionate [toward you].

Then the World-honored One spoke these verses:

One who knows when your property is exhausted, who [then] gives you property, Who admonishes you when you are negligent, and who is compassionate [toward you]—

You should know them as a good friend who benefits you greatly. A wise person should associate [with such a person]. Householder’s son, in the noble Dharma and discipline there are the six directions: east, south, west, north, the nadir, and the zenith.^75 Householder’s son, as to the east, it concerns how a child regards the parents.

First, generosity; second, loving words; third, acting beneficently; fourth, benefiting equally.^76

Then the World-honored One spoke these verses:

[By] generosity, loving words, Constantly acting for others’ benefit, And benefiting sentient beings equally, [One’s] reputation spreads far and wide.

These [four ways of] taking care of the world Are like the driver steering the chariot. Without these [ways of] caring, A mother does not, from her child, Receive support and respect, Nor does a father [receive their support and respect].

If [however], these ways of caring are present, Then great merit is thereby gained. Shining far like the light of the sun, Quickly bringing benefit, Gentle in speech, intelligent— Such a person gains a good reputation.

Decisive, protective, and free of pride,^77 Quickly bringing benefit,

Accomplished in faith and moral precepts— Such a person gains a good reputation. Always rising [to the occasion], not lazy, Delighting in offering food and drink to others, Well disciplined in their movements when about to depart— Such a person gains a good reputation. Friends and colleagues being mutually empathic, Caring for each other equally. The caring that exists between friends Is very refined, like that between teacher and disciple. One should first learn technical skills, And after that seek wealth. Having afterward obtained wealth, [One should] divide it into <six> parts:^78 One part for food and drink, one part for farming, One part set aside and saved In case of need in emergencies. To cultivators or merchants One part [should be] lent out for interest. The fifth is for marriage [expenses], The sixth for constructing a house. If a household is equipped with these six parts, Will it not increase and quickly attain happiness? [Such a householder] will certainly amass wealth, Like water flowing into the sea. Pursuing property in this way, He is like a bee gathering [nectar] from flowers. Having pursued wealth for a long time, He will derive pleasure from it. Do not spend [your] money too far, Nor too widely.

Do not give money To one who is violent and aggressive. The east is parents; The south is teachers; The west is the wife; The north is servants; The nadir [is] friends and colleagues; The zenith [is] renunciants and brahmins. Wishing to revere all these directions In two ways, one gains a great reputation. Having revered all these directions, A donor will be reborn in heaven. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the house- holder’s son Sujāta was delighted and received it respectfully.^79
