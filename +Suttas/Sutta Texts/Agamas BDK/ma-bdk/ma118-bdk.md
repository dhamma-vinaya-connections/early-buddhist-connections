### 118. The Discourse on the Elephant

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Eastern Park, in the Hall of Migāra’s Mother. At that time, in the afternoon, the World-honored One rose from sitting in seclusion, came down from the hall, and said, “Udāyin, let us go together to the Eastern River to bathe.”^359 Venerable Udāyin answered, “Yes.” Then the World-honored One went to the Eastern River together with Venerable Udāyin. He took off his robes, left them on the bank, and entered the water to bathe. Having bathed, he came out, wiped his body [dry], and put on his robes. At that time King Pasenadi had an elephant ( nāga ) named Sati.^360 It was crossing the Eastern River to the accompaniment of all kinds of entertaining music. On seeing it, the multitude said, “This is a nāga among nāga s, a great royal nāga. What is its name?” Venerable Udāyin extended his hands with palms together toward the Buddha and said: World-honored One, this elephant has a massive body, and the multitude, on seeing it, say, ‘“This is a nāga among nāga s, a great royal nāga. What is its name?” The World-honored One said: That is so, Udāyin. That is so, Udāyin. This elephant has a massive body, and the multitude, on seeing it, say, “This is a nāga among nāga s, a great royal nāga. What is its name?” Udāyin, if a horse, a camel, an ox, a donkey, a serpent, a human being, or a tree has grown to have a massive bodily form, then Udāyin, the mul titude, on seeing it, say, “This is a nāga among nāga s, a great royal nāga. What is its name?” Udāyin, in this world with its deva s, māra s, Brahmās, renunciants, and brahmins, from human beings to deva s, of anyone who does not harm [others] through [acts of] body, speech, or mind I say, “he is a nāga. ”^361 Udāyin, in this world with its deva s, māra s, Brahmās, renunciants,

and brahmins, from human beings to _deva_ s, the Tathāgata does not harm [others] through [acts of] body, speech, or mind. For this reason I am called a _nāga._ Then Venerable Udāyin extended his hands with palms together toward the Buddha and said:

World-honored One! May the World-honored One enhance my inspira- tional power! May the Well-gone One enhance my inspirational power! Allow me, in the presence of the Buddha, to chant in praise of the World- honored One with verses related to the characteristics of a _nāga_! The World-honored One said, “Do as you wish.” Then, Venerable Udāyin, in the presence of the Buddha, praised the World- honored One with verses related to the characteristics of a _nāga:_

The Fully Awakened One, born among humans, Taming himself, attained right concentration. Practicing the holy path, He calmed his mind and was able by himself to attain happiness. Respected by men For transcending all things, He is also respected by deva s [As] one who has become an arahant, without attachment. He has gone beyond all fetters, From being in the jungle [of fetters], he has left the jungle behind [by attaining nirvana].^362 Having discarded sensual pleasures, he delights in dispassion, Like true gold extracted from ore. Renowned as the Fully Awakened One, Like the sun ascending in the sky, [He is] supreme among all nāga s, Like the highest summit among a multitude of mountains. Praised as a great nāga , He does no harm anywhere.

The nāga among all nāga s, Truly is an unsurpassable nāga. Gentleness and harmlessness— These two are the nāga ’s [hind] legs. Asceticism and celibacy Are the nāga ’s practice. The great nāga has faith as his trunk, Two kinds of virtue as his tusks; Mindfulness as his neck, and wisdom as his head, To contemplate and analyze the teaching; Receiving and retaining the teachings is his belly, Delight in seclusion is his two forelegs.^363 Settled well on the in- and out-breaths, [His] mind attains perfect concentration. The nāga remains concentrated when walking and when standing still; When seated he is concentrated and also when lying down. The nāga is concentrated at all times. This is the constant state of the nāga. He accepts food from a household that is without fault. He does not accept it from one that is with fault. [If] he receives food that is bad or impure, He discards it, as a lion does. The food that is offered to him He accepts out of compassion for others. The nāga, in eating the faithful offerings of others, Maintains his life without attachment. He has cut off all fetters, big and small, Attained liberation from all bonds. Wherever he travels, His mind is not bound by any attachment. Just as a white lotus

Is born in water and grows up nourished by water, [Yet] the muddy water cannot become attached To its fine fragrance and delightful form— In the same way, the supremely Awakened One Was born into the world and is active in the world, [Yet] is not defiled by sensual pleasures, Just as the [lotus] flower to which the [muddy] water does not become attached. It is just as a blazing fire Will cease burning if not supplied with fuel. Without fuel a fire will not continue; Such a fire is said to have ceased. Wise men deliver these similes, Wishing their meaning to be understood. This is what the _nāga_ has come to know, And what the _nāga_ among _nāga_ s teaches. Free from sexual desire and hatred, Having discarded ignorance and attained the [state] without taints, [When] the _nāga_ abandons his body, This _nāga_ is said to have ceased. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, Venerable Udāyin was delighted and received it respectfully.
