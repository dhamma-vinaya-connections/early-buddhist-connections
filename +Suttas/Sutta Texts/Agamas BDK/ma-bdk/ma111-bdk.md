### 111. The Discourse on Fulfilling the Holy Life

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying among the Kurus, in the Kuru city of Kammāsadhamma. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: I will teach you the Dharma, which is sublime in the beginning, sublime in the middle, and also sublime in the end, with its meaning and phrasing, endowed with purity, revealing the holy life, namely, fulfilling the holy life and being capable of ending the taints. Listen closely and pay proper attention! Then the monks listened to receive the teaching. The World-honored One said: You should know the taints, know the cause for the arising of the taints, know the result of the taints, know the diversity of the taints, know the cessation of the taints, and know the path to the cessation of the taints.^314 You should know feelings, know the cause for the arising of feelings, know the result of feelings, know the diversity of feelings, know the ces sation of feelings, and know the path to the cessation of feelings. You should know perception, know the cause for the arising of per ception, know the result of perception, know the diversity of perception, know the cessation of perception, and know the path to the cessation of perception. You should know sensual pleasures, know the cause for the arising of sensual pleasures, know the result of sensual pleasures, know the diversity

of sensual pleasures, know the cessation of sensual pleasures, and know the path to the cessation of sensual pleasures. You should know karma, know the cause for the arising of karma, know the result of karma, know the diversity of karma, know the cessation of karma, and know the path to the cessation of karma. You should know _dukkha,_ know the cause for the arising of _dukkha,_ know the result of _dukkha,_ know the diversity of _dukkha,_ know the ces- sation of _dukkha,_ and know the path to the cessation of _dukkha._ What is “knowing the taints”? There are three taints: the taint of sensual desire, the taint of existence, and the taint of ignorance. This is called “knowing the taints.” What is “knowing the cause for the arising of the taints”? It is ignorance. Because of ignorance, the taints come into being. This is called “knowing the cause for the arising of the taints.” What is “knowing the result of the taints”? It is bondage due to igno- rance. Because of being stained by the taints, one receives the result: either attaining a good realm of existence, or attaining a bad realm of existence. This is called “knowing the result of the taints.” What is “knowing the diversity of the taints”? There are taints [leading to] rebirth in hell, there are taints [leading to] rebirth among animals, there are taints [leading to] rebirth among hungry ghosts, there are taints [leading to] rebirth in a heaven, there are taints [leading to] rebirth as a human being. This is called “knowing the diversity of the taints.” What is “knowing the cessation of the taints”? When ignorance is erad- icated, the taints are eradicated. This is called “knowing the cessation of the taints.” What is “knowing the path to the cessation of the taints”? It is the noble eightfold path: right view... up to... right concentration; these are the eight. This is called “knowing the path to the cessation of the taints.” If a monk knows the taints in this way, knows the cause for the arising of the taints, knows the result of the taints, knows the diversity of the taints, knows the cessation of the taints, and knows the path to the cessation of the taints, then he is reckoned as fulfilling the holy life and being capable of ending all the taints.

What is “knowing feelings”? There are three kinds of feeling: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neutral feeling. This is called “knowing feelings.” What is “knowing the cause for the arising of feelings”? It is contact. Because of contact there is feeling. This is called “knowing the cause for the arising of feelings.” What is “knowing the result of feelings”? It is craving. Craving is the result of feelings. This is called “knowing the result of feelings.”^315 What is “knowing the diversity of feelings”? When a monk feels a pleasant feeling, he knows he is feeling a pleasant feeling. When a monk feels a painful feeling, he knows he is feeling a painful feeling. When a monk feels a neutral feeling, he knows he is feeling a neutral feeling. When he feels a bodily pleasant... a bodily painful... a bodily neutral feeling... a mental pleasant... a mental painful... a mental neutral feeling... a worldly pleasant... a worldly painful... a worldly neutral feeling... an unworldly pleasant... an unworldly painful... an unworldly neutral feeling... a pleasant... a painful... a neutral feeling related to sensuality... a pleasant... a painful... a neutral feeling unrelated to sensuality, then he knows he is feeling a neutral feeling unrelated to sen suality.

This is called “knowing the cessation of feelings.” What is “knowing the path to the cessation of feelings”?

A monk knows narrow perception, knows great perception, knows perception of boundlessness, and knows perception of the sphere of nothingness. This is called “knowing perception.”^317

An unlearned ignorant worldling, who has not found a good spiritual friend and has not encountered the noble Dharma, experiences the arising of extreme pain in his body, pain so severe that one would wish to end one’s life to escape it. He seeks [a remedy] from outsiders [thinking]: “There may be some renunciant or brahmin who knows a spell consisting of one verse, or two verses, three verses, four verses, a spell of many verses, or [even] a spell consisting of a hundred verses, that will cure my _dukkha_ !” Because he seeks like this, _dukkha_ arises [in him].

Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
