### 34. The Discourse by Bakkula

Thus have I heard: At one time, not long after the final nirvana of the Buddha, Venerable Bakkula was staying at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, at the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. At that time, one afternoon while wandering around, a non-Buddhist practitioner who had been a good friend of Venerable Bakkula from the time before he had gone forth, approached Venerable Bakkula, exchanged greetings, and sat down to one side.

The non-Buddhist practitioner said, “Friend Bakkula, I would like to ask you a question. Will you listen to it?” Venerable Bakkula replied, “Practitioner of another school, ask what you wish. After hearing it, I will consider it.” The non-Buddhist practitioner asked, “Friend Bakkula, how long have you been practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline?” Venerable Bakkula answered, “Practitioner of another school, I have been practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline for eighty years already.” The non-Buddhist practitioner asked further: Friend Bakkula, during your eighty years of practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline, do you recall ever having had sexual inter course? Venerable Bakkula answered the non-Buddhist practitioner: You should not ask such a question. Instead [you should] ask a different question, “Friend Bakkula, during your eighty years of practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline, do you recall ever having given rise to any thought of sexual desire?” This, practitioner of another school, is the question you should ask. Then the non-Buddhist practitioner said this: I now ask a different question, friend Bakkula: During your eighty years of practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline, do you recall ever having given rise to any thought of sexual desire? At this, [only] because the non-Buddhist practitioner asked the question, Venerable Bakkula said to the monks: Venerable friends, I have been practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline for eighty years, but that for this reason conceit should arise [in me], this is not the case. That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula. Again, Venerable Bakkula declared:

Venerable friends, during my eighty years of practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline I have never had any thought of sexual desire. That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula. Again, Venerable Bakkula declared, “Venerable friends, I have been wearing rag robes for eighty years, but that for this reason conceit should arise [in me], this is not the case.” That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula. Again, Venerable Bakkula declared: Venerable friends, I have been wearing rag robes for eighty years, I do not recall ever having accepted a robe from a lay follower, having cut up cloth to make a robe, having had other monks make a robe [for me], or having sewn a robe or bag with a needle, not even a single thread. That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula. Again, Venerable Bakkula declared, “Venerable friends, I have been begging food for eighty years, but that for this reason conceit should arise [in me], this is not the case.” That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula. Again, Venerable Bakkula declared: Venerable friends, in my eighty years of begging food I do not recall ever having accepted an invitation from a lay follower, ever having gone beyond [the right time for] begging food, ever having begged food from a large household so as to get clean, good, very fine and luxurious food to eat, savor, and digest. I have never looked at a woman’s face. I do not recall ever having entered a nunnery. I do not recall ever having exchanged greetings with a nun, or even having spo- ken [to a nun] on the road. That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula.

Again, Venerable Bakkula declared: Venerable friends, during my eighty years of practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline I do not recall ever having trained a novice, nor do I recall ever having taught the Dharma to a lay follower, not even a verse of four lines. That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula. Again, Venerable Bakkula declared: Venerable friends, during my eighty years of practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline I have never been ill, not even having a headache for a moment. I do not recall ever having taken medicine, not even a single piece of myrobalan. That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula. Again, Venerable Bakkula declared: Venerable friends, in my eighty years of practicing sitting meditation in the cross-legged posture, I have never leaned against a wall or a tree. That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula. Again, Venerable Bakkula declared, “Venerable friends, within three days and nights, I attained the threefold realization.” That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula. Again, Venerable Bakkula declared, “Venerable friends, I will attain final Nirvana in the cross-legged sitting posture.” Then Venerable Bakkula attained final nirvana in the cross-legged sitting posture. That Venerable Bakkula attained final nirvana in the cross-legged sitting posture, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula. Such were the declarations made by Venerable Bakkula. At that time, the non-Buddhist practitioner and the [Buddhist] monks, having heard these declarations, were delighted and remembered them well.
