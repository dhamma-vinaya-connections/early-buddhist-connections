### 17. The Discourse to Gāmaṇi

Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was staying at Nālandā, in Pāvārika’s mango grove. At that time, [the seer] Asita Devala had a son named Gāmaṇi, who was of majestic complexion and build, radiant and bright. Just before dawn [Gāmaṇi] approached the place where the Buddha was, paid homage at the Buddha’s feet, and stood to one side. Gāmaṇi, the son of Asita Devala, said: World-honored One, brahmins arrogantly claim that they serve various gods, and that they can, at will, cause beings to reach a good realm of existence after death, to be reborn in a heavenly realm. The World-honored

One is the King of Dharma. May the World-honored One cause people to reach a good realm of existence after death, to be reborn in a heavenly realm!

The World-honored One said:

Now, Gāmaṇi, I shall ask you something. Answer according to your understanding. What do you think, Gāmaṇi? If in a village there are men and women who are lazy and indolent and who behave in evil ways, undertaking the ten unwholesome courses of action—killing living beings, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech,... (and so on up to) wrong view—and at the time of their death crowds of people come, placing their palms together, praising and imploring, saying: You men and women, who have been lazy and indolent and have behaved in evil ways, undertaking the ten unwholesome courses of action—killing living beings, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech... (and so on up to) wrong view— because of this, conditioned by this, after the breaking up of the body, at death, you shall^83 reach a good realm of existence, and be reborn in a heavenly realm. Gāmaṇi, those men and women, who have been lazy and indolent and have behaved in evil ways, undertaking the ten unwholesome courses of action—killing living beings, taking what is not given, sexual mis conduct, false speech... (and so on up to) wrong view—on being urged [when near death] by those crowds of people who come, placing their palms together, praising and imploring them, will they because of this, conditioned by this, after the breaking up of the body, at death, reach a good realm of existence, and be reborn in a heavenly realm?

Gāmaṇi replied: “No, World-honored One.” The World-honored One praised him saying:

Very good, Gāmaṇi! Why so? That those men and women who have been lazy and indolent and who behaved in evil ways, undertaking the ten unwholesome courses of action—killing living beings, taking what

is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech,... (and so on up to) wrong view—on being approached [when near death] by crowds of people, placing their palms together, praising and imploring them; that because of this, conditioned by this, after the breaking up of the body, at death, they should reach a good realm of existence, and be reborn in a heavenly realm, this is not possible. Suppose, Gāmaṇi, there was a deep lake full of water located not far from a village, and a man was to throw a large heavy rock into it. If a crowd of people came along and, placing their palms together, praising and imploring, said: “Rock! May you float up and come out!”—what do you think, Gāmaṇi? On being urged by that crowd of people who have come, placing their palms together, praising and imploring, because of this, conditioned by this, would that large heavy rock come out? Gāmaṇi replied: “No, World-honored One.” [The Buddha continued:] So it is, Gāmaṇi. Those men and women who have been lazy and indo lent and have behaved in evil ways, having undertaken the ten unwhole some courses of action—killing living beings, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech,... (and so on up to) wrong view— on being approached [when near death] by crowds of people, placing their palms together, praising and imploring them; that because of this, conditioned by this, after the breaking up of the body, at death, they should reach a good realm of existence, and be reborn in a heavenly realm, this is not possible. And why not? These ten unwholesome courses of action are black and have black results; by nature they incline downward, certainly leading to a bad realm of existence. What do you think, Gāmaṇi? If in a village there are men and women who are diligent and energetic and practice the sublime Dharma, undertaking the ten wholesome courses of action—they refrain from killing and have abandoned killing,... taking what is not given,... sexual misconduct,... false speech,... (and so on up to) they abstain from wrong view and have abandoned wrong view, they have acquired

right view—and at the time of their death crowds of people come, plac ing their palms together, praising and imploring them, saying: You men and women have been diligent and energetic and have practiced the sublime Dharma, undertaking the ten wholesome courses of action—you refrained from killing and had abandoned killing,... taking what is not given,... sexual misconduct,... false speech,... (and so on up to) you abstained from wrong view and had abandoned wrong view, had acquired right view—and because of this, conditioned by this, after the breaking up of the body, at death, you shall reach a bad realm of existence, be reborn in hell. What do you think, Gāmaṇi? Those men and women who have been diligent and energetic and have practiced the sublime Dharma, under taking the ten wholesome courses of action—[who] refrained from killing and had abandoned killing,... taking what is not given,... sexual misconduct,... false speech,... (and so on up to) [who] abstained from wrong view and had abandoned wrong view, had acquired right view—on being urged by the crowds of people who come, placing their palms together, praising and imploring, will they because of this, conditioned by this, after the breaking up of the body, at death, reach a bad realm of existence, and be reborn in hell?

Gāmaṇi replied: “No, World-honored One.” The World-honored One praised him saying:

Very good, Gāmaṇi. Why? Gāmaṇi, those men and women who have been diligent and energetic and practiced the sublime Dharma, under taking the ten wholesome courses of action—they refrained from killing and had abandoned killing,... taking what is not given,... sexual misconduct,... false speech,... (and so on up to) they abstained from wrong view and abandoned wrong view, had acquired right view—on being urged by crowds of people, placing their palms together, praising and imploring; that because of this, conditioned by this, after the break ing up of the body, at death, they should reach a bad realm of existence, and be reborn in hell; this is not possible.

Why so? Gāmaṇi, these ten wholesome courses of action are white and have white results, by nature they ascend, certainly reaching a good realm of existence. Gāmaṇi, suppose there were a deep lake full of water located not far from a village, and a man were to throw into the water a jar full of ghee and oil and then break it, so that fragments of the jar sank down ward, while the ghee and oil floated upward. Gāmaṇi, it is the same with those men and women who have been diligent and energetic and have practiced the sublime Dharma, under taking the ten wholesome courses of action— they refrained from killing and had abandoned killing,... taking what is not given,... sexual mis conduct,... false speech,... (and so on up to) they abstained from wrong view and abandoned wrong view, had acquired right view— At the time of their death, the body, which is gross matter, com posed of the four elements, was born of father and mother, nourished and raised in dependence on food, and [in old age] endured being sat down or laid down to be massaged and bathed, is of a nature to break up, of a nature to cease, of a nature to be dispersed. After death, it will be pecked at by ravens, or eaten by tigers and wolves, or burned, or buried, and finally become ashes and dust. [However,] their mind, their mental faculty, their consciousness, having been constantly pervaded by faith, diligence, much learning, generosity, and wisdom, because of this, conditioned by this, by nature they will ascend, to be reborn in a good realm of existence. Gāmaṇi, those who kill living beings, if they refrain from killing and abandon killing, then they are on the path of uplift, the path of ascent and progress, the path to a good realm of existence. Gāmaṇi, those who take what is not given... [who engage in] sexual misconduct

... false speech... (and so on up to) those who have wrong view, if they abstain from wrong view and acquire right view, then they are on the path of uplift, the path of ascent and progress, the path to a good realm of existence. Moreover, Gāmaṇi, there is another path of uplift, [another] path of ascent and progress, [another] path to a good realm of existence. What, Gāmaṇi, is this other path of uplift, the path of ascent and

progress, the path to a good realm of existence? It is the eightfold noble path: right view... (and so on up to) right concentration—these eight. Gāmaṇi, this too is a path of uplift, a path of ascent and progress, a path to a good realm of existence. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, Gāmaṇi and the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
