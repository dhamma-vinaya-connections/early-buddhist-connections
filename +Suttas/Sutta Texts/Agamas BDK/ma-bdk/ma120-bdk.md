### 120. The Discourse on a Teaching about Impermanence

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: Form is impermanent; what is impermanent, that it is dukkha; what is dukkha, that is not-self. Feeling too is impermanent; what is impermanent,

that is _dukkha;_ what is _dukkha,_ that is not-self. Perception too is imper- manent; what is impermanent, that is _dukkha;_ what is _dukkha,_ that is not- self. Volitional formations too are impermanent; what is impermanent, that is _dukkha;_ what is _dukkha,_ that is not-self. Consciousness too is imper- manent; what is impermanent, that is _dukkha;_ what is _dukkha,_ that is not- self. That is to say: Form is impermanent... feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness is impermanent; what is imper- manent, that is _dukkha;_ what is _dukkha,_ that is not-self. A learned noble disciple, contemplating in this way, cultivates the thirty-seven requisites of awakening with unobstructed right attention and right mindfulness^370 Knowing like this and seeing like this, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire, from the taint of existence, and from the taint of ignorance. Being liberated, he knows that he is liberated, and he knows as it really is: “Birth has been ended for me, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing of existence.” Among existing sentient beings whatsoever—including the nine abodes of sentient beings, up to the stage beyond the sphere of neither-percep- tion-nor-nonperception, [called] “the pinnacle of existence”—among [all of] these this is the foremost, this is the greatest, this is the victor, this is the utmost, this is the most admirable, this is the most excellent, namely: an arahant in the world. Why is that? Because an arahant in the world has attained [true] peace and happiness.

Then the World-honored One uttered these verses:

Freedom from attachment is the foremost happiness. [An arahant] has abandoned sensual desires, and is without craving for existence. He has forever discarded the “I”-conceit, Having torn asunder the net of ignorance.

He has attained imperturbability, His mind is without defilements. He is not defiled by attachment to the world, Having lived the holy life and attained freedom from taints.

He understands and knows the five aggregates, His province is the seven wholesome states.^371 A great hero, he dwells in a place That is free from all fear. Having attained the seven treasures of awakening, And trained in the threefold training, He is well reputed as a superior friend, The Buddha’s supreme and true son. He has attained the tenfold path, A great nāga with a supremely concentrated mind. Foremost in this world, He is without craving for existence. Unperturbed by the myriad affairs, Liberated from future existence, Having cut off birth, old age, disease, and death. What was to be done is done: he has eradicated the taints. He has generated the knowledge of one beyond training Having made this body his last. Equipped with the foremost holy life, His mind is not dependent on others. Above, below, and in all directions, Nowhere does he find delight. He can roar a lion’s roar, Supremely awakened in the world. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
