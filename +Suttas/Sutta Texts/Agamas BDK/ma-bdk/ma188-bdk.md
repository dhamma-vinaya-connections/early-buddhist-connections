### 188. The Discourse to Ajita

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in the Eastern Park, in the Hall of Migāra’s Mother. At that time, in the afternoon, the World-honored One had risen from sitting in meditation and had come down from the hall to do walking med itation in the open, in the shade of the hall, while giving the monks a detailed exposition of the deep and sublime Dharma. At that time the heterodox practitioner Ajita, a disciple of the renunciant Paṇḍita, saw from afar that the World-honored One had risen from sitting in meditation and had come down from the hall to do walking meditation in the open, in the shade of the hall, while giving the monks a detailed exposition of the deep and sublime Dharma. The heterodox practitioner Ajita, a disciple of the renunciant Paṇḍita, approached the Buddha, exchanged friendly greetings, and followed the Buddha as he walked.^37 The World-honored One turned to him and said: Ajita, is it true that the renunciant Paṇḍita has thought out five hundred thoughts, [so that] when other renunciants and brahmins, who [supposedly] know all and see all, claim to be without remainder and to know [that

they are] without remainder, they will see that they are wrong and that their claims about themselves are wrong? The heterodox practitioner Ajita, a disciple of the renunciant Paṇḍita, replied:

Gotama, it is true that the renunciant Paṇḍita has thought out five hundred thoughts, [so that] when other renunciants and brahmins, who [supposedly] know all and see all, claim to be without remainder and to know [that they are] without remainder, they will see that they are wrong and that their claims about themselves are wrong. The World-honored One asked further: Ajita, how has the renunciant Paṇḍita thought out five hundred thoughts, [so that] when other renunciants and brahmins, who [supposedly] know all and see all, claim to be without remainder and to know [that they are] without remainder, they will see that they are wrong and that their claims about themselves are wrong? The heterodox practitioner Ajita, a disciple of the renunciant Paṇḍita, replied:

Gotama, the renunciant Paṇḍita declares this: “[Suppose someone claims], ‘Whether I am walking, or standing, or sitting, or lying down, whether I am going to sleep or waking up, whether by day or by night, I know and see constantly and without obstruction.’^38 “It may happen that at some time I encounter a charging elephant, a runaway horse, a speeding chariot, rebelling soldiers, a running man, or a running woman. It may be that I am walking along a path like this and encounter a vicious elephant, a vicious horse, a vicious ox, or a vicious dog. It may be that I come upon a cluster of snakes, or have clods thrown at me, or get beaten up with sticks, or fall into a ditch, or fall into a cesspit, or tread on a sleeping cow, or fall into a deep trench, or wander into a thornbush. It may be that, on seeing a village or town, I ask its name or ask the way to it; or on seeing a man or woman, I ask their name. It may be that I see an empty house or enter a family [home] and, having entered,

am asked, ‘Venerable sir, where are you going?’ I answer them, saying, ‘Friends, I am on the wrong path.’” Gotama, the renunciant Paṇḍita has thought out five hundred thoughts like this, [so that] when other renunciants and brahmins who [supposedly] know all and see all claim to be without remainder and to know [that they are] without remainder, they will see that they are wrong. Then the World-honored One left off his walking meditation, went to the end of the walking meditation [path], spread out his sitting mat, and sat down cross-legged. He asked the monks, “Do you recall what I have taught on the subject of wisdom?” The monks remained silent and did not reply. Three times the World-honored One asked the monks, “Do you recall what I have taught on the subject of wisdom?” and three times the monks remained silent and did not reply. At that time one monk rose from his seat, arranged his robes so as to bare one shoulder, extended his hands with joined palms toward the Buddha and said: World-honored One, now is the right time. Well-gone One, now is the right time. If the World-honored One teaches the monks on the subject of wisdom, having heard it from the World-honored One the monks will remember it well. The World-honored One said, “Monks, listen closely and pay proper atten tion. I shall explain it to you in detail.” Then the monks replied, “Yes, indeed. We shall listen to receive the teaching.” The Buddha said: In general there are two [kinds of] assemblies. The first is called a Dharma assembly and the second is called a non-Dharma assembly. What is a non Dharma assembly? Suppose there is someone who practices non-Dharma and speaks non Dharma, and that his assembly also practices non-Dharma and speaks non-Dharma. That non-Dharma person stands before the non-Dharma assembly and speaks of what he himself knows, with false words and untruths. Presenting an analysis and propounding his practice, he conveys

his teaching in an orderly manner. He seeks to cut down others’ opinions as corrupt by closely questioning them with an improper manner of speaking. In the true Dharma and discipline, this way of setting out what one knows oneself is not praiseworthy. That non-Dharma person standing before his non-Dharma assembly praises himself saying: “I have wisdom. I have wide knowledge.” This situation, where claims regarding wisdom are made in this way, is what is called a non-Dharma assembly. What is a Dharma assembly? Suppose that someone practices Dharma and speaks Dharma, and his assembly also practices Dharma and speaks Dharma. That Dharma person stands before the Dharma assembly and speaks of what he himself knows with words that are true, correct, not false. Presenting an analysis and propounding his practice, he conveys his teaching in an orderly manner. He seeks to cut down others’ opinions as corrupt by closely questioning them with a proper manner of speaking. In the true Dharma this way of setting out what one knows oneself is praiseworthy. That Dharma person standing before a Dharma assembly praises himself, saying: “I have wisdom. I have wide knowledge.” This situation, where claims regarding wisdom are made in this way, is what is called a Dharma assembly. For this reason, you should know what is Dharma and what is non-Dharma, what is beneficial and what is not beneficial. Having known what is Dharma and what is non-Dharma, what is beneficial and what is not beneficial, you should train according to Dharma, according to what is beneficial. Having spoken thus, the Buddha got up from his seat and entered his dwelling to sit in meditation.^39 At this the monks thought, “Venerable friends, you should know that the World-honored One has got up from his seat and entered his dwelling to sit in meditation, having expressed the meaning of this in brief, without explaining it in detail, [namely], ‘For this reason, you should know what is Dharma and what is non-Dharma, what is beneficial and what is not beneficial. Having known what is Dharma and what is non- Dharma, what is beneficial and what is not beneficial, you should train accord- ing to Dharma, according to what is beneficial.”’ They further thought this: “Venerable friends, who would be able to explain in detail the meaning of what the World-honored One has just said in brief?”

They further thought this: “The venerable Ānanda is the attendant of the Buddha and knows the Buddha’s intentions, and he is often praised by the World-honored One and by his wise companions in the holy life. The ven- erable Ānanda will be able to explain in detail the meaning of what the World- honored One has just said in brief. Venerable friends, let us together approach the venerable Ānanda and request him to explain its meaning. As the venerable Ānanda explains it, we shall receive and remember it well.” Thereupon the monks approached the venerable Ānanda, exchanged greet- ings, stepped back, and sat to one side. They said:

The venerable Ānanda should know that the World-honored One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling to sit in meditation, having expressed the meaning of this in brief, without explaining it in detail, [namely], “For this reason, you should know what is Dharma and what is non-Dharma, what is beneficial and what is not beneficial. Having known what is Dharma and what is non-Dharma, what is beneficial and what is not beneficial, you should train according to Dharma, according to what is beneficial.” Then we thought this: “Venerable friends, who would be able to explain in detail the meaning of what the World-honored One has just said in brief?” We further thought: “The venerable Ānanda is the attendant of the Buddha and knows the Buddha’s intentions and he is often praised by the World-honored One and by his wise companions in the holy life. The venerable Ānanda will be able to explain in detail the meaning of what the World-honored One has just said in brief.” May the venerable Ānanda, out of compassion, explain it in detail! The venerable Ānanda said: Venerable friends, listen while I tell you a simile. On hearing a simile, wise people understand its meaning. Venerable friends, it is just like a man who wants to find heartwood. In order to find heartwood, he enters the forest, carrying an ax. He sees a great tree possessed of roots, branches, joints, twigs, leaves, flowers, and heartwood. That man does not seize the roots, branches, joints, and heartwood, but seizes only the twigs and leaves. Venerable friends, what you have said is just like that. [Although] the World-honored One was present you left him and have come to ask me the

meaning. Why is that? Venerable friends, please know that the World-honored One is the eye, is knowledge, is meaning, is the Dharma, is the master of the Dharma, is the general of the Dharma. He teaches the true meaning. The revelation of all meanings comes from that World-honored One. Venerable friends, you should have approached the World-honored One to ask about the meaning, [saying], “World-honored One, how is this? What is the meaning of this?” As the World-honored One would have explained it, so you, venerable friends, should have received and remembered it well.

Then the monks said:

Yes, venerable Ānanda, the World-honored One indeed is the eye, is knowledge, is meaning, is the Dharma, is the master of the Dharma, is the general of the Dharma. He teaches the true meaning. The revelation of all meanings comes from the World-honored One. Yet the venerable Ānanda is the attendant of the Buddha and knows the Buddha’s intentions. He is often praised by the World-honored One and by his wise companions in the holy life. The venerable Ānanda is able to explain in detail the meaning of what the World-honored One said in brief. May the venerable Ānanda, out of compassion, explain it in detail!

The venerable Ānanda said to the monks:

Venerable friends, listen together to what I shall say. Venerable friends, wrong view is non-Dharma, right view is Dharma. Whatever innumerable evil and unwholesome states arise in dependence on wrong view, these are not beneficial. Whatever innumerable wholesome states arise in depend- ence on right view, these are beneficial. Venerable friends... up to... wrong knowledge is non-Dharma, right knowledge is Dharma. Whatever innumerable evil and unwholesome states arise in dependence on wrong knowledge, these are not beneficial. Whatever innumerable wholesome states arise in dependence on right knowledge, these are beneficial. Venerable friends, regarding the instruction that the World-honored One gave in brief and, without explaining it in detail, got up from his seat and entered his dwelling to sit in meditation, [namely], “For this reason,

you should know what is Dharma and what is non-Dharma, what is beneficial and what is not beneficial. Having known what is Dharma and what is non Dharma, what is beneficial and what is not beneficial, you should train according to the Dharma, according to what is beneficial”—this instruction, which the World-honored One gave in brief, without explaining its meaning in detail, I have explained in detail in this way, employing these phrases and words. Venerable friends, approach the Buddha and set out [my expla nation] in full [to him]. As the World-honored One explains its meaning, [you], venerable friends, can receive and remember it. Then the monks, having heard the venerable Ānanda’s explanation, having received and remembered it well for recitation, rose from their seats, cir cumambulated the venerable Ānanda three times, and left. They approached the Buddha, paid homage with their heads, stepped back, and sat to one side. They said: World-honored One, regarding the instruction that the World-honored One gave us in brief without explaining its meaning in detail, but got up from his seat and entered his dwelling to sit in meditation—the venerable Ānanda has explained it in detail, employing these phrases and words. Having heard it, the World-honored One praised it, saying: It is well, it is well, [Ānanda] is one among my disciples who is endowed with the eye, with knowledge, with Dharma, with meaning. Why is that? Because in regard to what the teacher said to [you] disciples in brief without explaining its meaning in detail, that disciple has explained it in detail employing these phrases and words. As Ānanda has explained it, so you should remember it. Why is that? Contemplating the meaning [of the discourse] according to this explanation is how it should be done. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
