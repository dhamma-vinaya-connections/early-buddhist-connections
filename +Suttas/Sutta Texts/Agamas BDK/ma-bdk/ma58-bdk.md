### 58. The Discourse on the Seven Treasures

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time, the World-honored One addressed the monks: You should know that when a wheel-turning monarch appears in the world, seven treasures also appear in the world. What are the seven? The wheel treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse treasure, the jewel treasure, the woman treasure, the steward treasure, and the counselor treasure—these are the seven. You should know that when a wheel-turning monarch appears in the world, these seven treasures appear in the world. In the same way, you should know that when a Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened, appears in the world, there also appear in the world the seven treasures of the awakening factors. What are the seven? The treasure of the awakening factor of mindfulness, the awakening factor of investigation of phenomena, the awakening factor of effort, the awakening factor of joy, the awakening factor of tranquility, the awakening factor of concentration, and the treasure of the awakening factor of equanimity—these are the seven. You should know that when a Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened, appears in the world, these seven awakening factors appear in the world. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
