### 117. The Discourse on Delicate [Upbringing]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: In the past, [before] I had left the household life to practice the path, I [lived] at leisure, composed and happy, being brought up in an extremely delicate [manner]. While I was [still] living in the home of my father, Suddho dana, he built various palaces for me: a spring palace, a summer palace, and a winter palace. To provide for my recreation, he had various kinds of flower ponds constructed not far from these palaces: flower ponds for blue lotuses, for pink lotuses, for red lotuses, and for white lotuses. In those ponds he had various water flowers planted: blue lotus, pink lotus, red lotus, and white lotus. He had them constantly supplied with water and flowers; and he had them guarded, so that no one else could gain access to them. To provide for my recreation, he had various kinds of land-dwelling flowers planted on the banks of the ponds: great-flowered jasmine, Arabian jasmine, champak, fragrant lily, honey-scent flower, rose flower, and water lily.^355 To provide for my recreation, he assigned four people to bathe me. Having bathed me, they would apply red sandalwood paste to my body. Having applied sandalwood paste to my body, they would dress me in new silk clothes, brand new from top to bottom, inside and out, surface and interior. By day and by night they constantly held a parasol over me, the Crown Prince, so that I would not be dampened by dew at night or scorched by the sun during the day.

Whereas in other, ordinary households coarse grains, wheat, bean soup, and ginger were the primary foods, within the household of my father, Suddhodana, even the lowest-ranking servants had rice and sumptuous dishes as their primary foods. Again, meals were constantly prepared for me from game birds and beasts, the most beautiful birds and beasts—pheasant or partridge, and deer or roe—such game birds and beasts, the most beautiful birds and beasts. I recall how, long ago, when I was [still] living in the home of my father, Suddhodana, I would go up to the main palace to spend the four months of the summer season. There were no other men there, only women for my entertainment. Once there, I had no [thought of] coming down again. When I wanted to visit parks, thirty renowned cavalrymen of the best quality were selected to provide a ceremonial escort, both ahead of me and behind me, to wait on me and guide me—not to mention my other [servants]. Such was my prestige and power. So exceedingly delicate [was my upbringing]. I also recall how, long ago, I saw farmers resting in their fields. I went to the base of a rose-apple tree and sat down cross-legged. Secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from evil and unwholesome states, I entered and abided in the first absorption, which is with [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion.^356 I thought, “Unlearned ignorant worldlings are themselves subject to disease, not exempt from disease. On seeing other people become sick, they feel disgust and slight them as undesirable and unpleasant, not observ ing their own [condition].” Again, I thought, “I am myself subject to disease, not exempt from disease. If on seeing other people become sick I were to feel disgust and slight them as undesirable and unpleasant, then that would not be appro priate for me, since I too am subject to this [condition].” On my having observed in this way, the pride caused by being without sickness naturally vanished. Again, I thought, “Unlearned ignorant worldlings are themselves subject to old age, not exempt from old age. On seeing other people become old, they feel disgust and slight them as undesirable and unpleasant, not observ ing their own [condition].”

Again I thought, “I am myself subject to old age, not exempt from old age. If on seeing other people become old I were to feel disgust and slight them as undesirable and unpleasant, that would not be appropriate for me, since I too am subject to this [condition].” On my having contemplated in this way, the pride caused by [youthful] age naturally vanished.^357 Unlearned ignorant worldlings are proud, conceited, and become neg- ligent due to being without disease. Due to sensual desires their ignorance grows and they do not practice the holy life. Unlearned ignorant worldlings are proud, conceited, and become negligent due to being [youthful]. Because of sensual desires their ignorance grows and they do not practice the holy life. Unlearned ignorant worldlings are proud, conceited, and become negligent due to being alive. Due to sensual desires their ignorance grows and they do not practice the holy life. Then the World-honored One uttered these verses: Subject to disease, subject to old age, and subject to death. [Despite] being themselves similarly subject [to these], Worldlings view [these conditions] with disgust. If I were to feel disgust [at these conditions], [Despite] not having gone beyond them, That would not be appropriate for me, Since I too am subject to this. One who practices like this Realizes the Dharma that [leads to] freedom from rebirth As for pride in being without disease, Youthful, and of long life. Eliminating all [such] pride, One sees the peace of dispassion. By awakening in this way, One is not anxious in regard to sensual pleasures. Attaining the perception that there is nothing [in sensual pleasures], He practices the pure holy life. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
