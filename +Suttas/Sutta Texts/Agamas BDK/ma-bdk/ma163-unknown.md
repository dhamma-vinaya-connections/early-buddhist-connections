### 163. The Discourse on an Analysis of the Six Sense Spheres

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, staying in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: I shall teach you the Dharma that is sublime in the beginning, sublime in the middle, and also sublime in the end, with its meaning and phrasing, endowed with purity, and revealing the holy life,^328 namely a discourse on an analysis of the six sense spheres. Listen closely, listen closely and pay proper attention. Then the monks replied, “Yes, World-honored One, we shall receive the teaching.” The Buddha said: You should internally understand the six sense spheres. You should inter- nally understand the six contacts.^329 You should internally understand the eighteen mental activities. You should internally understand the thirty- six implements [of experience].^330 Herein, abandoning that, accomplish this. [You] should internally understand that the teaching of the Dharma is infinite. There are three establishments of mindfulness developed by the Noble One, having developed which the Noble One is capable of teaching the assemblies, as an unsurpassable trainer who trains people to advance in any direction. These are the topics of this discourse on an analysis of the six sense spheres. “The six sense spheres should be internally understood”—why has this been said? There are the eye sense sphere, the ear... nose... tongue... body and mind sense sphere. “The six sense spheres should be internally understood”—this has been said for this reason.

“The six contacts should be internally understood”—why has this been said? There is eye contact on seeing forms, ear contact on hearing sounds, nose contact on smelling odors, tongue contact on tasting flavors, body contact on touching tangibles, and mind contact on cognizing mind objects.^331 “The six contacts should be internally understood”—this has been said for this reason. “The eighteen mental activities should be internally understood”— why has this been said? Monks, having seen a form with the eye, one dis cerns the form and abides in joy, [or] one discerns the form and abides in sadness, [or] one discerns the form and abides in equanimity. In the same way with the ear... nose... tongue... body... having cognized a mental object with the mind, one discerns the mental object and abides in joy, [or] one discerns the mental object and abides in sadness, [or] one discerns the mental object and abides in equanimity. This is reckoned as discerning six [types] of joy, discerning six [types] of sadness, discerning six [types] of equanimity. These are collectively called the eighteen mental activities. “The eighteen mental activities should be internally under stood”—this has been said for this reason. “The thirty-six implements [of experience] should be internally under stood”—why has this been said? There are six [types] of joy that are based on attachment, six [types] of joy that are based on dispassion, six [types] of sadness that are based on attachment, six [types] of sadness that are based on dispassion, six [types] of equanimity that are based on attachment, and six [types] of equanimity that are based on dispassion. What are the six [types] of joy that are based on attachment and what are the six [types] of joy that are based on dispassion? The eye having seen a form, there arises joy. One should know that this [can be] of two types, either based on attachment or based on dispassion. What is joy based on attachment? The eye comes to know forms that are conducive to joy and the mind reflects on them, desiring those forms, expe riencing happiness conjoined with desire. Those [forms] which one has not gotten, one desires to get; those which one has already gotten are recollected and give rise to joy. Joy of this type is called joy based on attachment. What is joy based on dispassion? One understands that forms are imper manent, changing, [bound to] disappear, fade away, and cease; that all

forms, both formerly and in the present, are impermanent, _dukkha,_ and bound to cease. Recollecting this gives rise to joy. Joy of this type is called joy based on dispassion.^332 In the same way the ear... the nose... the tongue... the body... the mind having cognized a mental object, there arises joy. One should know that this [can be] of two types, either based on attachment or based on dispassion. What is joy based on attachment? The mind comes to know mental objects that are conducive to joy and the mind reflects on them, desiring those mental objects, experiencing happiness conjoined with desire. Those [mental objects] which one has not yet got, one desires to get; those which one has already got are recollected and give rise to joy. Joy of this type is called joy based on attachment. What is joy based on dispassion? One understands that mental objects are impermanent, changing, [bound to] disappear, to fade away and cease; that all mental objects, both formerly and in the present, are impermanent, _dukkha,_ and bound to cease. Recollecting this gives rise to joy. Joy of this type is called joy based on dispassion. What are the six [types] of sadness that are based on attachment and what are the six [types] of sadness that are based on dispassion? The eye having seen a form, there arises sadness. One should know that this [can be] of two types, either based on attachment or based on dispassion. What is sadness based on attachment? The eye comes to know forms that are conducive to joy and the mind reflects on them, desiring those forms, experiencing happiness conjoined with desire. Those [forms] which one has not yet got, one is not able to get; those which one has already got are [soon] past and gone, scattered and decayed, having ceased or changed, which gives rise to sadness. Sadness of this type is called sadness based on attachment. What is sadness based on dispassion? One understands that forms are impermanent, changing, [bound to] disappear, to fade away and cease; that all forms, both formerly and in the present, are impermanent, _dukkha,_ and bound to cease. Recollecting this, one reflects, “When will I attain and dwell in that sphere, namely the sphere that the noble ones attain and dwell in?” This

is [one’s] aspiration for the highest liberation. The frightening knowledge of dukkha and sadness gives rise to sadness. Sadness of this type is called sadness based on dispassion. In the same way, the ear... the nose... the tongue... the body... the mind having cognized a mental object, there arises sadness. One should know that this [can be] of two types, either based on attachment or based on dispassion. What is sadness based on attachment? The mind comes to know mental objects that are conducive to joy and the mind reflects on them, desiring those mental objects, experiencing happiness conjoined with desire. Those [mental objects] which one has not yet gotten, one is not able to get; those which one has already gotten are [soon] past and gone, scattered and decayed, having ceased or changed, which gives rise to sadness. Sadness of this type is called sadness based on attachment. What is sadness based on dispassion? One understands that mental objects are impermanent, changing, [bound to] disappear, to fade away and cease; that all mental objects, both formerly and in the present, are impermanent, dukkha, and bound to cease. Recollecting this, one reflects, “When will I attain and dwell in that sphere, namely the sphere that the noble ones attain and dwell in?” This is [one’s] aspiration for the highest liberation. The frightening knowledge of dukkha and sadness gives rise to sadness. Sadness of this type is called sadness based on dispassion. What are the six [types] of equanimity that are based on attachment and what are the six [types] of equanimity that are based on dispassion? The eye having seen a form, there arises equanimity. One should know that this [can be] of two types, either based on attachment or based on dispassion. What is equanimity based on attachment? The eye comes to know forms and there arises equanimity. That is the indifference [of one] who is not learned, who lacks wisdom, an unlearned ignorant worldling. Such equanimity toward form is not detached from form. This is called equa nimity based on attachment. What is equanimity based on dispassion? One understands that forms are impermanent, changing, [bound to] disappear, to fade away and cease; that all forms, both formerly and in the present, are impermanent, dukkha,

and bound to cease. Recollecting this, one is established in equanimity, equanimity that has been attained through mental development.^333 This is called equanimity based on dispassion. In the same way, the ear... the nose... the tongue... the body... the mind having cognized a mental object, there arises equanimity. One should know that this [can be] of two types, either based on attachment or based on dispassion. What is equanimity based on attachment? The mind comes to know mental objects and there arises equanimity that is the indifference [of one] who is not learned, who lacks wisdom, an unlearned ignorant worldling. Such equanimity toward mental objects is not detached from mental objects. This is called equanimity based on attachment. What is equanimity based on dispassion? One understands that mental objects are impermanent, changing, [bound to] disappear, to fade away and cease; that all mental objects, both formerly and in the present, are impermanent, _dukkha,_ and bound to cease. Recollecting this, one is estab- lished in equanimity, equanimity that has been attained through mental development. This is called equanimity based on dispassion. Thus, there are six [types] of joy based on attachment, six [types] of joy based on dispassion, six [types] of sadness based on attachment, six [types] of sadness based on dispassion, six [types] of equanimity based on attachment, six [types] of equanimity based on dispassion. These are collectively called [the thirty-six implements of experience]. “The thirty- six implements [of experience] should be internally understood”—this has been said for this reason. “Herein, abandoning that, accomplish this!”—why has this been said? By holding to the six [types] of joy that are based on dispassion, by depend- ing on them and dwelling in them, extinguish the six [types] of joy that are based on attachment, remove them, vomit them out. In this way they are to be eradicated. By holding to the six [types] of sadness that are based on dispassion, by depending on them and dwelling in them, extinguish the six [types] of sadness that are based on attachment, remove them, vomit them out. In this way they are to be eradicated.

By holding to the six [types] of equanimity that are based on dispassion, by depending on them and dwelling in them, extinguish the six [types] of equanimity that are based on attachment, remove them, vomit them out. In this way they are to be eradicated. By holding to the six [types] of sadness that are based on dispassion, by depending on them and dwelling in them, extinguish the six [types] of joy based on dispassion, remove them, vomit them out. In this way they are to be eradicated.^334 By holding to the six [types] of equanimity that are based on dispassion, by depending on them and dwelling in them, extinguish the six [types] of sadness that are based on dispassion, remove them, vomit them out. In this way they are to be eradicated. There is equanimity that is of countless contacts, diverse contacts, and there is equanimity that is of a single contact, not of diverse contacts. What is equanimity that is of countless contacts, diverse contacts? Equa nimity in regard to forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles—this is equa nimity that is of countless contacts, diverse contacts. What is equanimity that is of a single contact, not of diverse contacts? This is equanimity that depends on the sphere of infinite space, or on the sphere of infinite consciousness, or on the sphere of nothingness, or on the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception—this is equanimity that is of a single contact, not of diverse contacts. By holding to the equanimity that is of a single contact, not of diverse contacts, by depending on it and dwelling in it, extinguish the equanimity that is of countless contacts, diverse contacts, remove it, vomit it out. In this way it is to be eradicated. Holding to boundlessness, depending on boundlessness, and dwelling in boundlessness—this is reckoned as the type of equanimity that is of a single contact, not of diverse contacts. Holding to this, depending on this, dwelling in this—this is reckoned as extinguishing the equanimity that is of countless contacts, diverse contacts, as removing that, vomiting that out. In this way it is to be eradicated.^335 “Herein, abandoning that, accomplish this!”—this has been said for this reason.

“One should internally understand that the teaching of the Dharma is infinite”—why has this been said?^336 [Suppose that] the Tathāgata had four disciples who were of superior conduct, superior understanding, supe- rior mindfulness, and superior wisdom, who were skilled in eloquence, having achieved foremost skill in eloquence, and had a life span of a hun- dred years. The Tathāgata could teach them the Dharma for one hundred years continuously—except for the time [required] for eating and drinking, the time for obeying the calls of nature, the time for resting when weary, and the time for [Sangha] meetings— and they would quickly see, with wisdom, the meaning of the Dharma taught by the Tathāgata, as regards wording, phrasing, and import, without needing to ask the Tathāgata further questions about the Dharma. Why is that? [Because] the Tathāgata’s teach- ing of the Dharma is without limit and could not be exhausted, as regards wording, phrasing, and import, before the lives of those four disciples would come to an end. They would be just like four skilled archers, well trained, knowledge- able, and endowed with energy, who, powerfully shooting [their arrows], immediately penetrate [the target]. In the same way, [suppose that] the Tathāgata had four disciples who were of superior conduct, superior understanding, superior mindfulness, and superior wisdom, who were skilled in eloquence, having achieved foremost skill in eloquence, and had a life span of a hundred years. The Tathāgata could teach them the Dharma [even] for one hundred years con- tinuously—except for the time [required] for eating and drinking, the time for obeying the calls of nature, the time for resting when weary, and the time for [Sangha] meetings— and they would quickly see, with wisdom, the meaning of the Dharma taught by the Tathāgata, as regards wording, phrasing, and import, without needing to ask the Tathāgata further questions about the Dharma. Why is that? [Because] the Tathāgata’s teaching of the Dharma is without limit and could not be exhausted. “One should internally understand that the teaching of the Dharma is infinite”—this has been said for this reason. “[There are] three establishments of mindfulness that are developed by the Noble One, having developed which the Noble One is capable of

teaching the assemblies”—why has this been said? The Tathāgata teaches the Dharma to his disciples with thoughts of sympathy and consideration, seeking their benefit and welfare, seeking their peace and happiness, with a mind full of compassion and kindness, [telling them,] “This is for your welfare, this is for your happiness, this is for your welfare and happiness.” If those disciples are not respectful and do not act accordingly, not becoming established in knowledge, their minds not progressing in the Dharma, not following the Dharma, not receiving the true Dharma, dis regarding the World-honored One’s instruction, and unable to attain cer tainty in it; then the World-honored One is not sad or sorrowful because of this.^337 Instead, the World-honored One is equanimous and unaffected, constantly mindful and constantly aware. This is reckoned the first estab lishment of mindfulness that is developed by the Noble One, such that, having developed it, the Noble One is capable of teaching the assemblies. Again, the Tathāgata teaches the Dharma to his disciples with thoughts of sympathy and consideration, seeking their benefit and welfare, seeking their peace and happiness, with a mind full of compassion and kindness, [telling them,] “This is for your welfare, this is for your happiness, this is for your welfare and happiness.” If the disciples are respectful and act accordingly, becoming established in knowledge, their minds surrendering and progressing in the Dharma, following the Dharma, receiving the true Dharma, not disregarding the World-honored One’s instruction and able to attain certainty in it; then the World-honored One is not glad or joyful because of this.^338 Instead, the World-honored One is equanimous and unaffected, constantly mindful and constantly aware. This is reckoned the second establishment of mind fulness that is developed by the Noble One, such that, having developed it, the Noble One is capable of teaching the assemblies. Again, the Tathāgata teaches the Dharma to his disciples with thoughts of sympathy and consideration, seeking their benefit and welfare, seeking their peace and happiness, with a mind full of compassion and kindness, [telling them,] “This is for your welfare, this is for your happiness, this is for your welfare and happiness.” Some disciples are not respectful and do not act accordingly, not becom ing established in knowledge, their minds not progressing in the Dharma,

not following the Dharma, not receiving the true Dharma, disregarding the World-honored One’s instruction, and unable to attain certainty in it. Some disciples are respectful and act accordingly, becoming established in knowledge, their minds surrendering to and progressing in the Dharma, following the Dharma, receiving the true Dharma, not disregarding the World-honored One’s instruction, and able to attain certainty in it; the World-honored One is not sad or sorrowful because of this, nor is he glad or joyful. Instead, the World-honored One is equanimous and unaffected, constantly mindful and constantly aware. This is reckoned the third establishment of mindfulness that is developed by the Noble One, such that, having developed it, the Noble One is capable of teaching the assemblies. “There are three establishments of mindfulness that are developed by the Noble One, such that, having developed them, the Noble One is capable of teaching the assemblies”—this has been said for this reason. “The unsurpassable trainer of able men trains able men to advance in any direction”—why has this been said? “Trainer of able men”: this is said of one who trains able men to advance in a certain direction: the eastern direction, or the southern direction, or the western direction, or the northern direction. A trainer of elephants trains elephants to advance in a certain direction: the eastern direction, or the southern direction, or the western direction, or the northern direction. A trainer of horses trains horses to advance in a certain direction: the eastern direction, or the southern direction, or the western direction, or the northern direction. A trainer of oxen trains oxen to advance in a certain direction: the eastern direction, or the southern direction, or the western direction, or the northern direction. The unsurpassable trainer of able men trains able men to advance in any direction. Herein, “direction” [signifies this]: One who is [possessed of] form contemplates form—this is reckoned the first direction. Not perceiving forms internally, one contemplates forms externally— this is the second direction. One dwells having accomplished direct experience of the liberation by purity—this is the third direction.

Completely transcending perceptions of form, with the cessation of perceptions of sensory impact, not attending to perceptions of diversity, [being instead aware] of infinite space, one dwells having attained the sphere of infinite space—this is the fourth direction. Completely transcending the sphere of infinite space, [aware] of infinite consciousness, one dwells having attained the sphere of infinite conscious ness—this is the fifth direction. Completely transcending the sphere of infinite consciousness, [aware] of nothingness, one dwells having attained the sphere of nothingness— this is the sixth direction. Completely transcending the sphere of nothingness, [aware] of nei ther-perception-nor-nonperception, one dwells having attained the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception—this is the seventh direction. Completely transcending the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonper ception, one dwells having directly realized and accomplished the liberation that is the cessation of perception and knowing, and seeing with wisdom one knows that all taints have been eradicated—this is the eighth direction. “The unsurpassable trainer of able men trains able men to advance in any direction”—this has been said for this reason. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
