### 183. The Discourse at Assapura (2)

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha, who was dwelling in the country of Aṅga together with a large sangha of monks, approached Assapura and stayed with that sangha of monks in a forest retreat at Assa[pura]. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks, “People regard you renunciants as renunciants. When people ask you if you are renunciants, do you claim to be renunciants?” The monks replied, “Yes, World-honored One.” The Buddha said further: This being the case, because of this, you need to be [true] renunciants. You should train in the path of the renunciant. Do not be nonrenunciants. Training in the path of the renunciant, you will be true renunciants, not fake renunciants. Then if you receive robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, medicine, or the various other requisites of life, those who provide them will gain great merit, great fruit, great virtue, great and ample reward. This is how you should train. What is the path of the nonrenunciant? What is a nonrenunciant? If one who is covetous does not allay their covetousness, if one who has ill will does not allay their ill will, if one who has anger does not allay their anger, if one who is uncommunicative does not allay their uncommunica tiveness, if one who has fetters does not allay their fetters, if one who is avaricious does not allay their avarice, if one who is envious does not allay their envy, if one who is flattering does not allay their flattery, if one who is deceitful does not allay their deceit, if one who is shameless does not allay their shamelessness, if one who lacks scruples does not allay their lack of scruples, if one who has evil desires does not allay their evil desires, if one who has wrong view does not allay their wrong view—if one does not eradicate a renunciant’s defilement, a renunciant’s flattery, a renunciant’s deception, a renunciant’s deviousness, which lead toward a bad destiny, then they are training in the path of the nonrenunciant; they are a nonrenunciant.

Such a one is like a battle ax, with cutting edge and blade, newly made and extremely sharp, which is wrapped up in a monk’s robe. Just like this, I say, is that foolish one training in the path of the renunciant. That is to say, if one who is covetous does not allay their covetousness, if one who has ill will does not allay their ill will, if one who has anger does not allay their anger, if one who is uncommunicative does not allay their uncommunicativeness, if one who has fetters does not allay their fetters, if one who is avaricious does not allay their avarice, if one who is envious does not allay their envy, if one who is flattering does not allay their flattery, if one who is deceitful does not allay their deceit, if one who is shameless does not allay their shamelessness, if one who lacks scruples does not allay their lack of scruples, if one who has evil desires does not allay their evil desires, if one who has wrong view does not allay their wrong view—then [even though] they are wearing the monk’s robes, I do not call such a one a renunciant. If it were the case that anyone who donned the monk’s robes, being covetous allayed their covetousness, having ill will allayed their ill will, having anger allayed their anger, being uncommunicative allayed their uncommunicativeness, having fetters allayed their fetters, being avaricious allayed their avarice, being envious allayed their envy, being flattering allayed their flattery, being deceitful allayed their deceit, being shameless allayed their shamelessness, lacking scruples allayed their lack of scruples, having evil desires allayed the evil desires, having wrong view allayed their wrong view—[if this were the case], then all their dear friends would approach them and say, “Venerable one, you should train in wearing the monk’s robes. Venerable one, if you train in wearing the monk’s robes, that will allay any covetousness that you may have, allay any ill will that you may have, allay any anger that you may have, allay any uncommu- nicativeness that you may have, allay any fetters that you may have, allay any avarice that you may have, allay any envy that you may have, allay any flattery that you may have, [allay any deceit that you may have], allay any shamelessness that you may have, allay any lack of scruples that you may have, allay any evil desires that you may have, allay any wrong view that you may have.”^8

However, because I see those who wear the monk’s robes being cov etous, having ill will, having anger, being uncommunicative, having fetters, being avaricious, being envious, being flattering, [being deceitful], being shameless, lacking scruples, having evil desires, or having wrong view— therefore I declare that [just] wearing the monk’s robes does not make one a renunciant. In the same way for practicing nudity... wearing matted locks... practicing never sitting down... eating only once [a day]... constantly practicing purification with water, upholding [purification with] water. I declare that [just] upholding [purification with] water does not make one a renunciant. If it were the case that upholding [purification with] water allayed any covetousness that one might have, allayed any ill will that one might have, allayed any anger that one might have, allayed any uncommunicativeness that one might have, allayed any fetters that one might have, allayed any avarice that one might have, allayed any envy that one might have, allayed any flattery that one might have, [allayed any deceit that one might have], allayed any shamelessness that one might have, allayed any lack of scruples that one might have, allayed any evil desires that one might have, allayed any wrong view that one might have—[if this were the case], then one’s dear friends would come and say, “Venerable one, you should train in upholding [purification with] water. If you train in upholding [purification with] water, that will allay any covetousness that you may have, allay any ill will that you may have, allay any anger that you may have, allay any uncommunicativeness that you may have, allay any fetters that you may have, allay any avarice that you may have, allay any envy that you may have, allay any flattery that you may have, [allay any deceit that you may have], allay any shamelessness that you may have, allay any lack of scru ples that you may have, allay any evil desires that you may have, allay any wrong view that you may have.” However, because I see those who uphold [purification with] water being covetous, having ill will, having anger, being uncommunicative, having fetters, being avaricious, being envious, being flattering, [being deceitful], being shameless, lacking scruples, having evil desires, or having wrong view—therefore I declare that [just] upholding [purification with]

water does not make one a renunciant. This is what is meant by the path of the nonrenunciant, by being a nonrenunciant. What is the path of the renunciant? What is not being a nonrenunciant? If one allays any covetousness that one may have, allays any ill will that one may have, allays any anger that one may have, allays any uncommu- nicativeness that one may have, allays any fetters that one may have, allays any avarice that one may have, allays any envy that one may have, allays any flattery that one may have, [allays any deceit that one may have], allays any shamelessness that one may have, allays any lack of scruples that one may have, allays any evil desires that one may have, allays any wrong view that one may have—then, having eradicated a renunciant’s envy,^9 a renunciant’s flattery, a renunciant’s deception, a renunciant’s deviousness, which lead toward a bad destiny, one is training in the path of the renunciant, one is not a nonrenunciant. This is what is meant by the path of the renun- ciant, by not being a nonrenunciant. Having in this way accomplished morality and bodily, verbal, and men- tal purity, one [cultivates] a mind that is free of covetousness, free of ill will, free of sloth-and-torpor, free of restlessness-and-worry, and eradicating doubt and going beyond perplexity, with right mindfulness and right com- prehension, without bewilderment.^10 With a mind imbued with loving-kindness, one dwells [mentally] per- vading one direction, likewise the second, the third, and the fourth directions, and also the four intermediate directions and above and below, all around, everywhere. With a mind imbued with loving-kindness, free of fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention, one dwells pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well- cultivated. In the same way with a mind imbued with compassion... with empathic joy... with equanimity, free of fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention, one dwells pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well cultivated. Then one thinks, “There is becoming,^11 there is the gross, there is the subtle, there is perception and what goes beyond it, what is an escape from it,” knowing this at it really is. When one has come to know and see like this, the mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire, from the taint of becoming, and from the taint of ignorance. Being liberated, one

knows that one is liberated, knowing as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing of existence.” It is just as there might be, not far from a village, a delightful pond fed from a clear spring, with its banks covered in verdant grass, and with flowering trees all around; and there might come, from the eastern direction, a man who is extremely hungry, thirsty, and weary. He takes off his clothes, leaves them on the bank, and enters the pond to take a pleasant bath; he removes the grime, gets relief from the heat, and quenches his thirst. In the same way, there might come a man from the southern... the western... the northern direction, who is extremely hungry, thirsty, and weary; and he takes off his clothes, leaves them on the bank, and enters the pond to take a pleasant bath; he removes the grime, gets relief from the heat, and quenches his thirst. In the same way, a warrior clansman shaves off his hair and beard, dons the yellow robes and, out of faith, gives up the household life and becomes a homeless one to train in the path. He practices inner stillness, attains inner stillness. Of one who has inner stillness I declare that he is a renunciant, I declare that he is a brahmin, I declare that he is a noble one, I declare that he is purified [through having] “bathed.”^12 In the same way, a brahmin clansman... a householder clansman... a worker clansman shaves off his hair and beard, dons the yellow robes and, out of faith, gives up the household life and becomes a homeless one to train in the path. He practices inner stillness, attains inner stillness. Of one who has inner stillness I declare that he is a renunciant, I declare that he is a brahmin, I declare that he is a noble one, I declare that he is purified [through having] “bathed.”^13 What is a renunciant? It is one who has allayed all evil and unwhole some states, all taints and pollutants, which are the root of future becoming, have vexation and suffering as their result, and are the cause of birth, old age, disease, and death. This is what is meant by a renunciant. What is a brahmin? It is one who is far removed from all evil and unwholesome states, all taints and pollutants, which are the root of future becoming, have vexation and suffering as their result, and are the cause of birth, old age, disease, and death. This is what is meant by a brahmin.

What is a noble one? It is one who is far removed from all evil and unwholesome states, all taints and pollutants, which are the root of future becoming, have vexation and suffering as their result, and are the cause of birth, old age, disease, and death. This is what is meant by a noble one. What is one who is purified [through having] “bathed”? It is one who [through an inner] “bathing” has purified himself of all evil and unwhole- some states, all taints and pollutants, which are the root of future becoming, have vexation and suffering as their result, and are the cause of birth, old age, disease, and death. This is what is meant by one who is purified [through having] “bathed.” This is what is meant by a renunciant; this is what is meant by a brah- min; this is what is meant by a noble one; this is what is meant by one who is purified [through having] “bathed.” Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
