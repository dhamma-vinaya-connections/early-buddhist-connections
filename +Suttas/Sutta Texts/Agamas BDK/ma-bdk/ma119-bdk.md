### 119. The Discourse on the Grounds for Speaking

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: Herein there are [just] three grounds for speaking,^365 not four and not five. If a monk has seen [something], then based on that he may speak, saying, “I saw it.” [If he has] heard... recognized... known [something, then based on that] a monk may speak, saying, “This is what I know.”

What are the three [grounds for speaking]? Based on the past a monk may speak, saying, “Like this it was in the past.” Based on the future a monk may speak, saying, “Like this it will be in the future.” Based on the present a monk may speak, saying, “Like this it is now.” These are the three grounds for speaking, not four and not five. If a monk has seen [something], then based on that he may speak, say ing, “I saw it.” [If he has] heard... cognized... known [something, then based on that] a monk may speak, saying, “This is what I know.” Since what he says is wholesome, he gains benefit. Since he does not say what is unwholesome, he gains benefit. A disciple of the noble ones listens attentively with both ears to the Dharma. Having listened attentively with both ears to the Dharma, he abandons one factor, practices one factor, and realizes one factor. Having abandoned one factor, practiced one factor, and realized one factor, he attains right concentration. A disciple of the noble ones, having attained right concentration of mind, then abandons all sensual passion, hatred, and ignorance. In this way a disciple of the noble ones attains liberation of the mind. Having attained liberation, he knows that he is liberated. He knows as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, there will not be another experience of existence.”^366 Based on what a person says, there are four grounds on which one should observe him, [thinking,] “Is this venerable one fit to engage in dis cussion or not fit to engage in discussion?” If this venerable one does not respond definitively to a definitive argument, does not respond analytically to an analytical argument, does not respond conclusively to a conclusive argument, and does not respond with finality to a final argument, then in these ways this venerable one is not fit to engage in discussion, not fit to engage in argumentation. If [however] this venerable one does respond definitively to a definitive argument, does respond analytically to an analytical argument, does respond conclusively to a conclusive argument, and does respond with finality to a final argument, then in these ways this venerable one is fit to engage in discussion, fit to engage in argumentation.^367

Again, based on what a person has said, there are a further four grounds on which one should observe him, [thinking,] “Is this venerable one fit to engage in discussion or not fit to engage in discussion?” If this venerable one is inconsistent about standpoints and their opposites, inconsistent about what is known, inconsistent about what has been explained through similes, and inconsistent about procedure, then in these ways this venerable one is not fit to engage in discussion, not fit to engage in argumentation. If [however] this venerable one is consistent about standpoints and their opposites, consistent about what is known, consistent about what has been explained through similes, and consistent about procedure, then in these ways this venerable one is fit to engage in discussion, fit to engage in argumentation.^368 Depending on what is being spoken of, he curbs his verbal activity at the [proper] time. He discards his preformed views, discards resentful states of mind, discards sensual desire, discards hatred, discards delusion, discards pride, discards obstinate silence, discards stinginess and jealousy. He does not pursue victory, does not prevail over others, and does not seize on their mistakes. He talks only about what is meaningful, about Dharma. Having talked about what is meaningful, about Dharma, and having taught it and again taught it, he himself is delighted and causes others to be delighted. Such talk about what is meaningful, such talk on [these] subjects is noble talk about what is meaningful, noble talk about [these] matters. It leads all the way to total destruction of the taints.

Then the World-honored One uttered these verses:

If when arguing in a discussion, The confused mind harbors cherishing and pride, Then this is not noble; it destroys virtue, With each seeking advantage over the other.

Just seeking to find fault with the other, Wishing to defeat him; Striving ever more for victory over each other— Noble ones do not speak like this.

If he wants to be competent in discussion, A wise one should know the [proper] timing. With Dharma and with meaning, This is how the noble ones discuss. The wise speak like this: Without dispute, without pride, Without feelings of aversion, Without fetters, without taints. Compliant and unconfused, They speak with right knowledge. They accept what is well said, And they themselves never speak evil. In discussion they do not remonstrate, And are not affected by others’ remonstration. They know the standpoints and grounds for their speech, This is [the way] they discuss. Thus speak the noble ones, The wise ones who completely get the meaning. For happiness in the present, And for peace in the hereafter, You should know that an intelligent person Speaks without bias or banality. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
