### 199. The Discourse on the Stages of the Fool and the Wise

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks, “I will now teach you the nature of being foolish and the nature of being wise. Listen closely, listen closely and pay proper attention!” Then the monks listened to receive the instruction. The Buddha said: What is the nature of foolishness? A fool has three characteristics that mark him as foolish, that show him to be foolish, and possessing which he qualifies as a fool and is said to be foolish. What are the three? A fool thinks evil thoughts, speaks evil speech, and does evil deeds. This is why he is a fool and is said to be foolish. If a fool did not think evil thoughts, did not speak evil speech, and did not do evil deeds, then he would not be reckoned a fool and said to be foolish. It is because a fool thinks evil thoughts, speaks evil speech, and does evil deeds that he is reckoned a fool and said to be foolish. Right here and now a fool experiences three types of distress in body and mind. What are the three types of distress in body and mind that a fool experiences? Whatever he is doing, be it sitting in an assembly meeting, or being in a street or alley, or in a marketplace, or at a crossroads, there is talk about matters relating to fools: “A fool kills living beings, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsehood... up to... has wrong view, and possesses countless other evil and unwholesome qualities.”^156 Having seen that someone possesses countless evil and unwholesome qualities, other people speak badly of him.

Hearing this, the fool then thinks, “Having seen that someone possesses countless evil and unwholesome qualities, other people speak badly of him. I too possess these countless evil and unwholesome qualities. If they knew this, they would speak badly of me.” This is the first type of distress in body and mind that a fool experiences right here and now. Again, a fool sees the king’s men arresting a criminal and subjecting him to various kinds of painful punishment: cutting off his hands, cutting off his feet, cutting off both his hands and his feet, cutting off his ears, cutting off his nose, cutting off both his ears and his nose; or slicing strips off him, or tearing out his beard, or tearing out his hair, or tearing out both his beard and his hair; or putting him in a cage and setting fire to his clothes; or wrapping him in straw and setting fire to it; or placing him in the belly of the “iron donkey,” or in the mouth of the “iron pig,” or in the mouth of the “iron tiger” and then heating it over a fire; or placing him in a copper cauldron or an iron cauldron and stewing him; or cutting him into pieces, or stabbing him with a sharp fork, or hooking him with iron hooks, or laying him down on an iron bed and scalding him with boiling oil, or seating him in an iron mortar and pounding him with an iron pestle, or having him be bitten by poisonous snakes, or whipping him with whips, or beating him with sticks, or hitting him with clubs, or impaling him alive, or cutting off his head. Seeing this, the fool thinks, “Being known to the king and arrested for possessing countless evil and unwholesome qualities, one will be punished like this.^157 I too possess these countless evil and unwholesome qualities. If the king knew this, he would have me too subjected to painful punish- ment.” Such is the second type of distress in body and mind that a fool experiences right here and now. Again the fool engages in evil bodily conduct, engages in evil verbal and mental conduct. Suppose he becomes sick and experiences pain.^158 As he is sitting or lying on a bed, or sitting or lying on a bench, or sitting or lying on the ground, great pain, extreme suffering arises in his body such as to make him wish to end his life. At that time his evil bodily con- duct, evil verbal and mental conduct hangs over him. It is just as, in the late afternoon when the sun is going down behind a tall mountain, the shadow hangs over the ground; in the same way his evil bodily conduct, evil verbal and mental conduct hangs over him at

that time. He thinks, “This is my evil bodily conduct, evil verbal and mental conduct hanging over me. In former times I have not done what is meritorious; I have done much evil. “If there is a place for those who have done evil, who have been fierce and brutal, who have been unprincipled in their affairs, who have not done what is meritorious and not done what is wholesome, who have not made for themselves a lifelong reliable refuge from fear, then I will be going to that bad place.” From this arises regret; and regret having arisen, [he knows] that he will die unworthy, that his life will end in an unwholesome way. This is the third type of distress in body and mind that the fool experiences right here and now. Again, the fool engages in evil bodily conduct, engages in evil verbal and mental conduct. Having engaged in evil bodily conduct, engaged in evil verbal and mental conduct, because of this condition, with the breaking up of the body at death he will certainly go to a bad destiny and be reborn in hell. On being reborn there he will experience the painful consequences, which are entirely unwanted, displeasing, such as the mind would not like to think about. If it is said, “It is entirely unwanted, displeasing, such as the mind would not like to think about,” then it is about hell that this is said. Why is that? Hell is entirely unwanted, displeasing, such as the mind would not like to think about. At that time one monk rose from his seat, arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder, extended his hands with joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, “World-honored One, how is the suffering in hell?” The World-honored One replied, “Monk, hell cannot be completely described—that is, the suffering in hell. Monk, hell is pure suffering.” The monk asked again, “World-honored One, can the meaning of this be expressed through a simile?” The World-honored One replied: The meaning of this can be expressed through a simile. Monk, it is just as if the king’s men, having caught a thief, were to bring him to the head- anointed warrior king and say, “Your Majesty, this thief has committed a

crime. May Your Majesty punish him.” The head-anointed warrior king says, “You go in the morning and punish this man’s crime by stabbing him a hundred times with spears.” On receiving the instruction, the king’s men go in the morning and punish him by stabbing him a hundred times with spears; [yet] that man is still alive. The head-anointed warrior king asks them, “How is that man?” The king’s men reply, “Your Majesty, that man is still alive.” The head-anointed warrior king says again, “You go at midday and again stab him a hundred times with spears.” On receiving the instruction, the king’s men go at midday and again stab him a hundred times with spears, [yet] that man is still alive. The head-anointed warrior king again asks them, “How is that man?” The king’s men reply, “Your Majesty, that man is still alive.” The head-anointed warrior king again says, “You go at sundown and again stab him a hundred times with spears.” On receiving the instruction the king’s men go at sundown and again stab him a hundred times with spears; [yet] that man is still alive. However, that man’s body is completely perforated, broken up, and destroyed. No part of it, even the size of the hole in a coin, remains intact. The head anointed warrior king asks them, “How is that man?” The king’s men reply, “Your Majesty, that man is still alive. However, his body is com pletely perforated, broken up, and destroyed. No part of it, even the size of the hole in a coin, remains intact.” Monks, what do you think? When that man was stabbed with spears three hundred times in a single day, would he have experienced distress, extreme anguish, and pain in body and mind because of this? The monks replied: World-honored One, he would have already experienced extreme pain on being stabbed by one spear, let alone being stabbed three hundred times by spears.^159 How could that person not have experienced distress, extreme anguish, and pain in body and mind? Then the World-honored One took in his hand a pebble as small as a pea and said, “Monks, do you see this pebble as small as a pea that I have taken in my hand?”

The monks replied, “We see it, World-honored One.” The World-honored One asked them further:

Monks, what do you think? If this pebble, small as a pea, that I have taken in my hand, is compared with the Himalaya, king of mountains, which is the larger?

The monks replied:

Compared with the pebble, small as a pea, that the World-honored One has taken in his hand, the Himalaya, king of mountains, is a hundred times larger, a thousand times, ten thousand, a hundred thousand times larger, immeasur- ably, incalculably, incomparably larger, larger beyond reckoning, since the Himalaya, king of mountains, is extremely large, exceedingly large.

The World-honored One said:

Monks, it is just as, compared with the pebble, small as a pea, that I have taken in my hand, the Himalaya, king of mountains, is a hundred times greater, a thousand times, ten thousand, a hundred thousand times greater, immeasurably, incalculably, incomparably greater, greater beyond reck- oning, since the Himalaya, king of mountains, is extremely large, exceed- ingly large. In the same way, monks, compared with the distress, extreme anguish, and pain in body and mind experienced by that man because he was stabbed with spears three hundred times in a single day, the suffering in hell is a hundred times greater, a thousand times, ten thousand, a hundred thousand times greater, immeasurably, incalculably, incomparably greater, greater beyond reckoning, since the suffering in hell is extremely painful, exceedingly painful. Monks, how is the suffering in hell? When living beings are reborn in hell, as soon as they have been born there, the guardians of hell seize them with their hands and, with blazing red-hot iron axes, chop and trim their bodies so that they become octagonal or hexagonal,^160 square or round, tall or short, neat or unshapely. Being tortured in this way, [those beings] are overwhelmed by pain for very many years, up to hundreds or thousands, experiencing immeas- urable pain, extremely severe and acute pain; yet after all they do not die

until their evil and unwholesome deeds have been exhausted. Such is the suffering in hell. Monks, how is the suffering in hell?^161 When living beings are reborn in hell, as soon as they have been born there, the guardians of hell seize them with their hands and, with blazing red-hot iron hatchets, chop and trim their bodies so that they become octagonal or hexagonal, square or round, tall or short, neat or unshapely. Being tortured in this way, [those beings] are overwhelmed by pain for very many years, up to hundreds or thousands, experiencing immeas urable pain, extremely severe and acute pain; yet after all they do not die until their evil and unwholesome deeds have been exhausted. Such is the suffering in hell. Monks, how is the suffering in hell? When living beings are reborn in hell, as soon as they have been born there, the guardians of hell seize them with their hands and force them to sit on blazing red-hot iron spears. With iron pincers they force their mouths open and then place in their mouths blazing red-hot iron balls, which burn their lips, burn their tongue, burn their palate,^162 burn their throat, burn their heart, burn their stomach, and then come out of the body lower down. Being tortured in this way, [those beings] are overwhelmed by pain for very many years, up to hundreds or thousands, experiencing immeas urable pain, extremely severe and acute pain; yet after all they do not die until their evil and unwholesome deeds have been exhausted. Such is the suffering in hell. Monks, how is the suffering in hell? When living beings are reborn in hell, as soon as they have been born there, the guardians of hell seize them with their hands, and force them to sit on blazing red-hot iron stakes. With iron pincers they force their mouths open and then pour molten copper into their mouths, which burns their lips, burns their tongue, burns their palate, burns their throat, burns their heart, burns their stomach, and then comes out of the body lower down. Being tortured in this way, [those beings] are overwhelmed by pain for very many years, up to hundreds or thousands, experiencing immeas urable pain, extremely severe and acute pain; yet after all they do not die until their evil and unwholesome deeds have been exhausted. Such is the suffering in hell.

Monks, how is the suffering in hell? When living beings are reborn in hell, as soon as they have been born there, the guardians of hell seize them with their hands and force them to lie down on their backs on a blazing red-hot iron floor, and punish them with the fivefold fixing: they nail both hands and both feet [to the floor] with iron nails, and nail their belly with another nail. Being tortured in this way, [those beings] are overwhelmed by pain for very many years, up to hundreds or thousands, experiencing immeas- urable pain, extremely severe and acute pain; yet after all they do not die until their evil and unwholesome deeds have been exhausted. Such is the suffering in hell. Monks, how is the suffering in hell? When living beings are reborn in hell, as soon as they have been born there, the guardians of hell seize them with their hands, and force them to lie down on the blazing red-hot iron floor. Pulling out their tongue, they stretch it [and fix it] with a hundred nails so that it is without wrinkles and does not shrink. It is just like using a hundred nails to stretch an ox hide so that it is without wrinkles and does not shrink. In the same way, [when] living beings are reborn in hell, as soon as they have been born there, the guardians of hell seize them with their hands and force them to lie down on the blazing red-hot iron floor. Pulling out their tongue, they stretch it [and fix it] with a hundred nails so that it is without wrinkles and does not shrink. Being tortured in this way, [those beings] are overwhelmed by pain for very many years, up to hundreds or thousands, experiencing immeas- urable pain, extremely severe and acute pain; yet after all they do not die until their evil and unwholesome deeds have been exhausted. Such is the suffering in hell. Monks, how is the suffering in hell? When living beings are reborn in hell, as soon as they have been born there, the guardians of hell seize them with their hands, and tear off their skin from head to feet or tear off their skin from feet to head. [Then] they bind them to a chariot and drag them back and forth on the blazing red-hot iron floor. Being tortured in this way, [those beings] are overwhelmed by pain for very many years, up to hundreds or thousands, experiencing immeasurable

pain, extremely severe and acute pain; yet after all they do not die until their evil and unwholesome deeds have been exhausted. Such is the suffering in hell. Monks, how is the suffering in hell? When living beings are reborn in hell, as soon as they have been born there, the guardians of hell force them down on the ground and, having taken what is blazing red-hot and burning, they force them to take it in their hands and sprinkle it over their own bodies. Being tortured in this way, [those beings] are overwhelmed by pain for very many years, up to hundreds and thousands, experiencing immeas urable pain, extremely severe and acute pain; yet after all they do not die until their evil and unwholesome deeds have been exhausted. Such is the suffering in hell. Monks, how is the suffering in hell? When living beings are reborn in hell, as soon as they are born there, the guardians of hell force them to go up and down a blazing red-hot mountain of fire. When they put one foot down, the flesh, skin, and blood are completely burned up, and when they lift up that foot, the flesh, skin, and blood become again as before. Being tortured in this way, [those beings] are overwhelmed by pain for very many years, up to hundreds or thousands, experiencing immeas urable pain, extremely severe and acute pain; yet after all they do not die until their evil and unwholesome deeds have been exhausted. Such is the suffering in hell. Monks, how is the suffering in hell? When living beings are reborn in hell, as soon as they have been born there, the guardians of hell seize them with their hands and, having lifted them up above a big blazing red-hot iron cauldron, they put them upside down into that iron cauldron. They are tossed up and down and in the [eight] directions, and froth comes out of their bodies, surrounding them as they cook. It is just as when big beans, lentils, pod beans, bitter beans, and mustard seed are placed into a cauldron, with plenty of water and a very hot fire below, the beans in it are tossed up and down and in the [eight] directions, and become surrounded by their own froth as they cook. In the same way, when living beings are reborn in hell, as soon as they have been born there, the guardians of hell seize them with their hands

and, having lifted them up above a big blazing red-hot iron cauldron, they put them upside down into that iron cauldron. They are tossed up and down and in the [eight] directions, and froth comes out of their bodies, surrounding them as they cook. Being tortured in this way, [those beings] are overwhelmed by pain for very many years, up to hundreds or thousands, experiencing immeas- urable pain, extremely severe and acute pain; yet after all they do not die until their evil and unwholesome deeds have been exhausted. Such is the suffering in hell. Monks, how is the suffering in hell? Among the hells there is one hell called the Six Sensory Contacts.^163 When living beings are reborn in it, as soon as they have been born there, the forms they see with their eyes are not enjoyable, not likable. [Finding them] truly not enjoyable, not lik- able, the mind does not desire them; they are truly not desirable. The mind does not delight in them, as they are truly not delightful. The sounds they hear with the ear... the odors they smell with the nose... the flavors they taste with the tongue... the tangibles they feel with the body... the mind-objects they cognize with their minds are not enjoyable, not likable. [Finding them] truly not enjoyable, not likable, the mind does not desire them; they are truly not desirable. The mind does not delight in them, as they are truly not delightful. Such is the suffering in hell. Monks, I could with countless skillful means describe to you those hells, and describe the situation in those hells; but the suffering in those hells cannot be completely described, since hell is pure suffering. Monks, the fool may at some time emerge from hell and be reborn as an animal. Life as an animal is also very painful. Monks, how is the suffering of animals?^164 Some of the living beings that are reborn among animals are born in darkness, grow up in darkness, and die in darkness. Which [animals] are they? They are earth-dwelling worms. At an earlier time the fool, out of greedy attachment to tasty food, engaged in evil bodily conduct, engaged in evil verbal and mental conduct. Having engaged in evil bodily conduct, engaged in evil verbal and mental conduct, because of that reason, with the breaking up of the body at death he is reborn among animals that are born in darkness, grow up in darkness, and die in darkness. Such is the suffering of animals.

Monks, how is the suffering of animals? Some of the living beings that are reborn among animals are born in the bodies [of others], grow up in the bodies [of others], and die in the bodies [of others]. Which [animals] are they? They are called ulcer worms. At an earlier time the fool, out of greedy attachment to tasty food, engaged in evil bodily conduct, engaged in evil verbal and mental conduct. Having engaged in evil bodily conduct, engaged in evil verbal and mental conduct, because of that reason, with the breaking up of the body at death he is reborn among animals that are born in the bodies [of others], grow up in the bodies [of others], and die in the bodies [of others]. Such is the suffering of animals. Monks, how is the suffering of animals? Some living beings are reborn among animals that are born in water, grow up in water, and die in water. Which [animals] are they? They are fish, sea monsters ( makara s), tortoises, alligators, water serpents, timi s, timiṅgala s, and timirapiṅgala s.^165 At an earlier time the fool, out of greedy attachment to tasty food, engaged in evil bodily conduct, engaged in evil verbal and mental conduct. Having engaged in evil bodily conduct, engaged in evil verbal and mental conduct, because of that reason, with the breaking up of the body at death he is reborn among animals that are born in water, grow up in water, and die in water. Such is the suffering of animals. Monks, how is the suffering of animals? Some living beings are reborn among animals that eat by chewing on fresh grass, shrubs, and trees. Which [animals] are they? They are elephants, horses, camels, cows, don keys, deer, water buffalo, and swine. At an earlier time the fool, out of greedy attachment to tasty food, engaged in evil bodily conduct, engaged in evil verbal and mental conduct. Having engaged in evil bodily conduct, engaged in evil verbal and mental conduct, because of that reason, with the breaking up of the body at death he is reborn among animals that eat by chewing fresh grass, shrubs, and trees. Such is the suffering of animals. Monks, how is the suffering of animals? Some living beings are reborn among animals that, on smelling the odor of human feces and urine, run toward it and eat it as food.

It is just as boys and girls, on smelling the odor of food and drink, run toward it [saying,] “That is food, that is food!”^166 In the same way, monks, some living beings are reborn among animals that, on smelling the odor of human feces and urine, run toward it and eat it as food. Which [animals] are they? They are chickens, pigs, dogs, jackals, crows, and [the animals called] _julouluo_ and _julengjia._^167 At an earlier time the fool, out of greedy attachment to tasty food, engaged in evil bodily conduct, engaged in evil verbal and mental conduct. Having engaged in evil bodily conduct, engaged in evil verbal and mental conduct, because of that reason, with the breaking up of the body at death he is reborn among animals that feed on excrement and filth. Such is the suffering of animals. Monks, I could with countless skillful means describe to you those animals and describe the situation of animals; but the suffering of animals cannot be completely described, since the life of animals is pure suffering. Monks, for the fool to emerge from being an animal and return to be born as a human being is extremely difficult. Why is that? Among animals there is no practice of benevolence and virtue. They do not act according to the principles of proper conduct. They do not act in a refined and whole- some way. Those animals eat one another. The strong eat the weak; the big eat the small. Monks, it is as if this earth were completely immersed in water and there were a blind turtle with a life span of countless hundreds and thou- sands of years; and on the surface of the water, being blown about by the wind, there were a small, light wooden plank with just a single hole through it. Monks, what do you think? Would the head of that blind turtle get to go into the single hole in that small, light wooden plank? The monks replied, “World-honored One, it might get to go into it, but only after a very long time and with great difficulty.” The World-honored One said: Monks, perhaps after a hundred years have passed the blind turtle, coming from the east, raises its head once, [but] that small wooden plank with just a single hole has been blown by an easterly wind toward the south.

Perhaps after a hundred years have passed the blind turtle, coming from the south, raises its head once, [but] that plank with a single hole has been blown by a southerly wind toward the west. Perhaps after a hundred years have passed the blind turtle, coming from the west, raises its head once, [but] that plank with a single hole has been blown by a westerly wind toward the north. Perhaps after a hundred years have passed the blind turtle, coming from the north, raises its head once, [but] that plank with a single hole has been blown by a northerly wind in all directions. Monks, what do you think? Would the head of that blind turtle get to go into the one hole in this plank? The monks replied, “World-honored One, it might get to go into it, but only after a very long time and with great difficulty.” [The World-honored One said]: Monks, in the same way, for the fool to emerge from being an animal and return to be born as a human being is extremely difficult. Why is that? Among animals there is no practice of benevolence and virtue. They do not act according to the principles of proper conduct; they do not act in a refined and wholesome way. Those animals eat one another. The strong eat the weak; the big eat the small. Monks, if the fool at some time emerges from being an animal and returns to be born as a human being, then he will be in some inferior family of a lowly clan, debased and poor, with meager food and drink, getting food only with great difficulty. Which are such [families]? They are families of prison guards, workers, artisans, and potters, such relatively lowly families that are debased and poor, with meager food and drink, getting food only with great difficulty. Born into such a family, at birth he may be blind, or lame, or with a withered arm, or hunchbacked, or left-handed, with a bad complexion, having a face like a sheep, ugly, of short life span, and at the service of others. He engages in evil bodily conduct, engages in evil verbal and mental conduct. Having engaged in evil bodily conduct, engaged in evil verbal and mental conduct, because of that reason, with the breaking up of the body at death he will again go to a bad destiny, being reborn in hell.

It is like two men gambling. One of them, on making his first draw, acts in such a way that he loses his male and female servants and loses his wife and children. [Then after] drawing again [and losing] he is hung upside down in a smoke-filled room [as punishment for nonpayment]. He thinks, “I have nothing to eat or drink. On my first draw I acted in such a way that I lost my male and female servants and lost my wife and children. [Then after] drawing again, I was hung upside down in a smoke-filled room.” Monks, this way of acting—[whereby] he lost his male and female servants, lost his wife and children, and [then after] drawing again, was hung upside down in a smoke-filled room—is trifling [compared with] the ways of acting one might engage in, namely engaging in evil bodily conduct, engaging in evil verbal and mental conduct. Monks, having engaged in evil bodily conduct, engaged in evil verbal and mental conduct, because of this, conditioned by this, with the breaking up of the body at death one will go to a bad destiny, being reborn in hell. Monks, these ways of acting are most unwished for, truly displeasing, not such as the mind would think about. Monks, have I not taught you completely about the nature of foolishness? The monks replied, “Yes, the World-honored One has indeed taught us completely about the nature of foolishness.” The World-honored One said: What is the nature of wisdom? The wise man has three characteristics that mark him as wise, that show him to be wise, and possessing which he qual- ifies as a wise man and is said to be wise. What are the three? It is because a wise man thinks wholesome thoughts, speaks wholesome speech, and does wholesome deeds that he is a wise man and is said to be wise. If a wise man did not think wholesome thoughts, did not speak whole- some speech, and did not do wholesome deeds, then he would not be reck- oned a wise man and said to be wise. It is because a wise man thinks wholesome thoughts, speaks wholesome speech, and does wholesome deeds that he is reckoned a wise man and is said to be wise. Right here and now the wise man experiences three types of delight in body and mind. What are the three types of delight in body and mind that a wise man experiences right here and now?

Whatever the wise man is doing, be it sitting in an assembly meeting, or being in a street or alley, or in a marketplace, or at a crossroads, there is talk about matters relating to wise men: “A wise man has abandoned killing and abstains from killing... taking what is not given... engaging in sexual misconduct... speaking falsehood... up to... has abandoned wrong view and acquired right view; and he possesses countless other wholesome qualities.”^168 Having seen that someone possesses countless wholesome qualities, other persons praise him. Hearing this, the wise man then thinks, “Having seen that someone possesses countless wholesome qualities, other people praise him. I too possess these countless wholesome qualities. If they knew, they would praise me.” This is the first type of delight in body and mind that a wise man experiences right here and now. Again, a wise man sees the king’s men arresting a criminal and sub jecting him to various kinds of painful punishment: cutting off his hands, cutting off his feet, cutting off both his hands and his feet, cutting off his ears, cutting off his nose, cutting off both his ears and his nose; or slicing strips off him, or tearing out his beard, or tearing out his hair, or tearing out both his beard and his hair; or putting him in a cage and setting fire to his clothes; or wrapping him in straw and setting fire to it; or placing him in the belly of the “iron donkey,”’ or in the mouth of the “iron pig,” or in the mouth of the “iron tiger,” and then heating it over a fire; or placing him in a copper cauldron or an iron cauldron and stewing him; or cutting him into pieces, or stabbing him with a sharp fork, or hooking him with iron hooks, or laying him down on an iron bed and scalding him with boiling oil, or seating him in an iron mortar and pounding him with an iron pestle, or having him be bitten by poisonous snakes, or whipping him with whips, or beating him with sticks, or hitting him with clubs, or impaling him alive, or cutting off his head. Seeing this, the wise man thinks, “Being known to the king and arrested for possessing countless evil and unwholesome qualities, one would be subjected to such punishment. I do not possess these countless evil and unwholesome qualities. If the king came to know this, he would certainly not have me subjected to such punishment.” Such is the second type of delight in body and mind that a wise man experiences right here and now.

Again, the wise man engages in sublime bodily conduct, engages in sublime verbal and mental conduct. Suppose he becomes sick and expe- riences pain. As he is sitting or lying on a bed, or sitting or lying on a bench, or sitting or lying on the ground, great pain, extreme suffering arises in his body such as to make him wish to end his life. At that time his sublime bodily conduct, sublime verbal and mental conduct hangs over him. It is just as in the late afternoon when the sun is going down behind a tall mountain, the shadow hangs over the ground. In the same way his sublime bodily conduct, sublime verbal and mental conduct hangs over him at that time. He thinks, “This is my sublime bodily conduct, sublime verbal and mental conduct hanging over me. In former times I have not done what is evil; I have done much that is meritorious. If there is a place for those who have not done evil, who have not been fierce and brutal, who have not been unprincipled in their affairs, who have done what is meritorious, done what is wholesome, who have made for themselves a lifelong reliable refuge from fear, then I will be going to that good place.” From this arises absence of regret; and absence of regret having arisen, [he knows] he will die worthy, his life will end in a wholesome way. This is the third type of delight in body and mind that a wise man experiences right here and now. Again, the wise man engages in sublime bodily conduct, engages in sublime verbal and mental conduct. Having engaged in sublime bodily conduct, engaged in sublime verbal and mental conduct, because of that reason, with the breaking up of the body at death he will certainly ascend to a good destiny and be reborn up in heaven. On being reborn in heaven he will experience a happy fruition, which is entirely wanted, entirely pleasing, such that the mind likes to think about. If one thinks, “‘Entirely wanted, entirely pleasing, such that the mind likes to think about,’ then this is said about the good realms of existence. Why is that? The good realms of existence are entirely wanted, entirely pleasing, such as the mind likes to think about.” At that time one monk rose from his seat, arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder, extended his hands with joined palms toward the Buddha and said, “World-honored One, how is the happiness in the good realms of existence?”

The World-honored One replied: Monk, the good realms of existence cannot be completely described— that is, the happiness in the good realms of existence. The good realms of existence are pure happiness. The monk asked again, “World-honored One, can the meaning of this be expressed through a simile?” The World-honored One replied: The meaning of this can be expressed through a simile. It is just as when a wheel-turning monarch possesses the seven treasures and the four types of human supernormal power.^169 Monk, what do you think? Possessing the seven treasures and the four types of human supernormal power, would the wheel-turning monarch because of that experience supreme delight in body and mind? The monk replied: World-honored One, possessing one treasure or one human supernormal power, one would already experience supreme delight. How could the wheel-turning monarch not be supremely delighted at possessing the seven treasures and the four types of human supernormal power? Then the World-honored One took in his hand a pebble as small as a pea and said, “Monks, do you see the pebble, small as a pea, that I have taken in my hand?” The monks replied, “We see it, World-honored One.” The World-honored One asked them further: Monks, what do you think? If this pebble, small as a pea, that I have taken in my hand is compared with the Himalaya, king of mountains, which is the larger? The monks replied: Compared with the pebble, small as a pea, that the World-honored One has taken in his hand, the Himalaya, king of mountains, is a hundred times larger, a thousand times, ten thousand, a hundred thousand times larger,

immeasurably, incalculably, incomparably larger, larger beyond reckoning, since the Himalaya, king of mountains, is extremely large, exceedingly large.

The World-honored One said:

Monks, it is just as, compared with the pebble, small as a pea, that I have taken in my hand, the Himalaya, king of mountains, is a hundred times larger, a thousand times larger, ten thousand, a hundred thousand times larger, immeasurably, incalculably, incomparably larger, larger beyond reckoning, since the Himalaya, king of mountains, is extremely large, exceedingly large. In the same way, monks, compared with the supreme delight in body and mind experienced by the wheel-turning monarch who possesses the seven treasures and the four types of human supernormal power, the divine happiness of the good realms of existence is a hundred times greater, a thousand times, ten thousand, a hundred thousand times greater, immea- surably, incalculably, incomparably greater, since the good realms of exis- tence are pure happiness. Monks, how is the happiness in the good realms of existence? There is a good destiny called the Six Sensory Contacts.^170 When living beings are reborn in it, as soon as they have been born there, the forms they see with their eyes are enjoyable, likable. [Finding them] truly enjoyable, lik- able, the mind desires them; they are truly desirable. The mind delights in them, as they are truly delightful. The sounds they hear with the ear... the odors they smell with the nose... the flavors they taste with the tongue... the tangibles they feel with the body... the mind-objects they cognize with their minds are enjoyable, likable. [Finding them] truly enjoyable, likable, the mind desires them; they are truly desirable. The mind delights in them, as they are truly delightful. Such is the happiness of the good realms of existence. Monks, I could with countless skillful means describe to you those good realms of existence, and describe the situation in those good realms of existence; but the happiness in those good realms of existence cannot be completely described, since the good realms of existence are pure happiness. Monks, the wise man may at some time come down from the good realms of existence to be reborn among human beings. The family [into

which he is born] is one that enjoys extremely great riches, immeasurable wealth, with an abundance of all kinds of livestock, feudal lands, and manors, with plenty of rice and other grains, and with all the various req uisites of life. Which are [these families]? They are families of great warrior house holders, families of great brahmin householders, families of great merchant householders, and others that enjoy extremely great riches, immeasurable wealth, with an abundance of all kinds of livestock, feudatories, and manors, with plenty of rice and other grains, and with all the various req uisites of life. Being born into such a family, he is good-looking and lovable, respected by many people, extremely famous, greatly powerful, loved by many peo ple, and thought of by many people. He engages in sublime bodily conduct, engages in sublime verbal and mental conduct. Having engaged in sublime bodily conduct, engaged in sublime verbal and mental conduct, because of this, conditioned by this, with the breaking up of the body at death, he will in turn go to a good destiny, being reborn in heaven. It is like two men gambling. One of them, on making his first draw, acts in such a way that he gains much wealth. He thinks, “I did not work in the fields, yet on making my first draw I acted in such a way that I gained much wealth.” Monks, this way of acting, [whereby] he gained much wealth, is trivial [compared with] these [other] ways of acting, namely engaging in sublime bodily conduct, engaging in sublime verbal and mental conduct. Having engaged in sublime bodily conduct, engaged in sublime verbal and mental conduct, because of this, conditioned by this, with the breaking up of the body at death one will in turn go to a good destiny, being reborn in heaven. Monks, these ways of acting are highly wanted, most pleasing, such that the mind would most like to think about. Monks, have I not taught you completely about the nature of being a wise man? The monks replied, “Yes, the World-honored One has indeed taught us completely about the nature of being a wise man.” The World-honored One said: Such is the nature of a fool and the nature of a wise man. You should

understand the nature of a fool and the nature of a wise man. Having understood the nature of a fool and the nature of a wise man, give up the nature of a fool and take up the nature of a wise man! You should train yourselves in this way.^171 Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
