### 52. The [First] Discourse on Nutriments

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: One cannot know the point at which craving for existence began, the point before which there was no craving for existence and at which craving for existence arose. But one can understand the causes for craving for existence. Craving for existence has its nutriment; it is not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of craving for existence? The answer is: its nutriment is ignorance. Ignorance too has its nutriment; it is not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of ignorance? The answer is: its nutri ment is the five hindrances. The five hindrances too have their nutriment; they are not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of the five hindrances? The answer is: their nutriment is the three types of wrong conduct. The three types of wrong conduct too have their nutriment; they are not without nutriment.

What is the nutriment of the three types of wrong conduct? The answer is: their nutriment is failure to guard the sense faculties. Failure to guard the sense faculties too has its nutriment; it is not without nutri- ment. What is the nutriment of failure to guard the sense faculties? The answer is: its nutriment is lack of right mindfulness and right atten- tiveness. Lack of right mindfulness and right attentiveness too has its nutriment; it is not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of lack of right mindfulness and right atten- tiveness? The answer is: its nutriment is lack of right attention. Lack of right attention too has its nutriment; it is not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of lack of right attention? The answer is: its nutriment is lack of faith. Lack of faith too has its nutriment; it is not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of lack of faith? The answer is: its nutriment is hearing wrong teachings. Hearing wrong teachings too has its nutriment; it is not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of hearing wrong teachings? The answer is: its nutriment is association with bad friends. Association with bad friends too has its nutriment; it is not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of association with bad friends? The answer is: its nutriment is bad people. That is to say, because there are bad people, there will be associ- ation with bad friends. Once there is association with bad friends, there will be hearing of wrong teachings. Once there is hearing of wrong teachings, there will be lack of faith. Once there is lack of faith, there will be lack of right attention. Once there is lack of right attention, there will be lack of right mindfulness and right attentiveness. Once there is lack of right mindfulness and right attentiveness, there will be failure to guard the sense faculties. Once there is failure to guard the sense faculties, there will be the three types of wrong conduct. Once there are the three types of wrong conduct, there will be the five hindrances. Once there are the five hindrances, there will be ignorance. Once there is ignorance, there will be craving for existence. This is how, step by step, craving for existence comes about.

[It is just as it is] with the great ocean. It too has its nutriment; it is not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of the great ocean? The answer is: the large rivers are its nutriment. The large rivers too have their nutriment; they are not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of the large rivers? The answer is: the small rivers are their nutriment. The small rivers too have their nutriment; they are not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of the small rivers? The answer is: the large streams are their nutriment. The large streams too have their nutriment; they are not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of the large streams? The answer is: the small streams are their nutriment. The small streams too have their nutriment; they are not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of the small streams? The answer is: the mountain creeks and the marshes of the plains are their nutriment. The mountain creeks and the marshes of the plains too have their nutriment; they are not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of the mountain creeks and the marshes of the plains? The answer is: the rain is their nutriment. At times it rains heavily and after the rain the mountain creeks and the marshes of the plains are filled with water. The mountain creeks and the marshes of the plains being filled, the small streams are filled. The small streams being filled, the large streams are filled. The large streams being filled, the small rivers are filled. The small rivers being filled, the large rivers are filled. The large rivers being filled, the great ocean is filled. This is how, step by step, the great ocean is filled. In the same way, craving for existence has its nutriment; it is not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of craving for existence? The answer is: its nutriment is ignorance. Ignorance too has its nutriment; it is not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of ignorance? The answer is: its nutriment is the five hindrances.

The answer is: their nutriment is failure to guard the sense faculties. Failure to guard the sense faculties too has its nutriment; it is not without nutri- ment. What is the nutriment of failure to guard the sense faculties? The answer is: its nutriment is lack of right mindfulness and right atten- tiveness.

The answer is: its nutriment is lack of right attention. Lack of right attention too has its nutriment; it is not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of lack of right attention?

The answer is: its nutriment is association with bad friends. Association with bad friends too has its nutriment; it is not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of association with bad friends? The answer is: its nutriment is bad people. That is to say, because there are bad people, there will be associ- ation with bad friends. Once there is association with bad friends, there will be hearing of wrong teachings. Once there is hearing of wrong teachings, there will be lack of faith. Once there is lack of faith, there will be lack of right attention. Once there is lack of right attention, there will be lack of right mindfulness and right attentiveness. Once there is lack of right mindfulness and right attentiveness, there will be failure to guard the sense faculties. Once there is failure to guard the sense faculties, there will be the three types of wrong conduct. Once there are the three types of wrong conduct, there will be the five hin- drances. Once there are the five hindrances, there will be ignorance.

Once there is ignorance, there will be craving for existence. This is how, step by step, craving for existence comes about. [Likewise,] wisdom and liberation have their nutriment; they are not without nutriment. What is the nutriment of wisdom and liberation? The answer is: their nutriment is the seven factors of awakening. The seven factors of awakening too have their nutriment; they are not without nutriment.
