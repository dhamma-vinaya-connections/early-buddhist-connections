### 138. The Discourse on Meritorious Deeds

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One told the monks: Do not fear meritorious action, for it is delightful when recalled to mind. Why is that? Meritorious action is what is called happiness. Fear of meri- torious action is not delightful when recalled to mind. Why is that? Lack of meritorious action is what is called _dukkha._^91 What is the reason for that? I recall how, in the distant past, I engaged in meritorious action for a long time, and I experienced the results for a long time; and that is delight- ful when recalled to mind. Having, in the distant past, practiced loving- kindness for seven years, I did not come to [be born in] this world [of

human sensuality] for seven eons of cosmic evolution and destruction. When the world went to destruction, I was reborn in the Heaven of Radi- ance ( _ābhassara_ ). When the world evolved [again], I descended to take birth in a vacant Brahmā palace. Among those Brahmās I was the Great Brahmā. In other places I was king of the _deva_ s, experiencing freedom and ease for a thousand eons. For thirty-six eons I was Sakka, ruler of the _deva_ s; and again for countless eons I was the warrior king Mandhātu.^92 Monks, when I was the warrior king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thou- sand elephants equipped with fine harnesses, adorned with numerous pre- cious decorations, draped with strings of white pearls, with the royal ele- phant Uposatha as the chief. Monks, when I was the warrior king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thou- sand horses equipped with fine harnesses, adorned with numerous precious decorations, entwined with gold and silver, with the king of horses [Vala- hassa] as the chief. Monks, when I was the warrior king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thou- sand chariots, adorned with four kinds of decoration and various beautiful things, such as the hides of lions, tigers, and leopards woven with designs of varied colors and various decorations—very swift chariots, the chief of which was the chariot Vejayanta. Monks, when I was the warrior king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thou- sand cities, very large and pleasant, with many inhabitants, the chief of which was the royal city of Kusāvatī. Monks, when I was the warrior king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thou- sand multistoried buildings, made of four kinds of precious material, gold, silver, beryl, and crystal, the chief of which was the Sudhamma Hall. Monks, when I was the warrior king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thou- sand thrones, made of four kinds of precious material, gold, silver, beryl, and crystal, upholstered with woolen textiles, draped with brocades and fine silk fabrics, with lined and quilted coverlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends. Monks, when I was the warrior king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thou- sand suits of clothing, clothing of linen, clothing of brocade and silk, clothing of cotton, and clothing of antelope hide.

Monks, when I was the warrior king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thou sand women, each with a splendid, clear, bright, fresh body, of extraor dinary beauty exceeding human [beauty], almost divine [beauty], dignified beauty that delighted those who saw it, richly adorned with various kinds of precious jewelry, jade and pearl necklaces in abundance, pure warrior [caste] women, as well as countless women of other castes. Monks, when I was the warrior king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand kinds of food, served constantly day and night, for me to eat when I wished. Monks, of those eighty-four thousand kinds of food there was one that was particularly delicious and fresh, with numerous flavors, which I often ate. Monks, of those eighty-four thousand women there was one woman of the warrior caste, the most dignified and beautiful, who often waited on me. Monks, of those eighty-four thousand suits of clothes there was one suit of clothes, of linen or brocade or silk or cotton or antelope hide, that I often wore. Monks, of those eighty-four thousand thrones there was one throne, of gold or silver or beryl or crystal, upholstered with woolen textiles, draped with brocade or fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted coverlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends, on which I often reclined. Monks, of those eighty-four thousand multistoried buildings, there was one [made of] gold or silver or beryl or crystal, called Sudhamma Hall, in which I often stayed. Monk, of those eighty-four thousand cities there was one, very wealthy and pleasant, with many inhabitants, named Kusāvatī, in which I often resided. Monks, of those eighty-four thousand chariots there was one, decorated with various beautiful things, such as the hides of lions, tigers, and leopards, woven with designs of varied colors, a very swift chariot, named Vejayanta, in which I often rode when visiting pleasure parks and viewing terraces. Monks, of those eighty-four thousand horses there was one, with bluish body and crow-like head, the royal horse named Valahassa, which I often rode when visiting pleasure parks and viewing terraces. Monks, of those eighty-four thousand elephants there was one whose entire body was very white and whose seven parts were perfect, the royal

elephant named Uposatha, which I often rode when visiting pleasure parks and viewing terraces. Monks, I had this thought, “What are the kinds of action whose fruit and result have caused me to be endowed today with this great supernormal power, great and mighty virtue, great merit, great and mighty power?” Monks, again I had this thought, “There are three kinds of action whose fruits and results have caused me to be endowed today with this great supernormal power, great and mighty virtue, great merit, great and mighty power. The first is charitable giving, the second is self-discipline, and the third is restraint.”

Then the World-honored One uttered these verses:^93

Look at these results of meritorious action, So wonderful and so abundant! Monks, [because] in the distant past, I had practiced loving-kindness for seven years, For seven eons of evolution and destruction, I did not come to [birth in] this world [of human sensuality].

When the world went to destruction, I was born in the Heaven of Radiance. When the world evolved [again], I took birth in Brahmā Heaven.

Among the Brahmās I was the Great Brahmā, And for a thousand births I experienced freedom and ease as a _deva_. For thirty-six [births] I was Sakka; And for countless hundreds [of births] I was the king Mandhātu. The warrior king Mandhātu Is the most honored by human beings.

In accordance with Dharma, without relying on sword or club, He reigned over the entire world. In accordance with Dharma, without abusive oppression, He taught genuine peace and happiness. In accordance with Dharma, [his teaching] was passed on And spread over the whole great earth.

Of great wealth and much property— Such was the clan into which he was born, Endowed with abundant property and grain crops, He acquired the seven treasures. Because of this great merit, Wherever he was born, he experienced freedom and ease. Buddhas guide the world By what a buddha teaches. Knowing this very special [fact], One sees their abundant supernormal power. Whoever knows it, yet is without faith, Such a one is born into darkness. Therefore, one should take action oneself, Seeking great merit and fortune. One should be respectful toward the Dharma, Always recollecting the Buddha and his Dharma and discipline. Thus said the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, those monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
