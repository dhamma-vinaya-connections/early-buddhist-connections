### 41. The Discourse on the Householder Hatthaka

Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was staying at Aggāḷava near Āḷavī, in a rosewood grove. At that time the World-honored One said to the monks: The householder Hatthaka possesses eight marvelous and wonderful qualities. What are they? The householder Hatthaka has few desires; he has faith, a sense of shame, scruples, energy, mindfulness, concen tration, and wisdom. On account of what is the householder Hatthaka said to have few desires? The householder Hatthaka has few desires himself, [yet] he does not wish to let others know, “I have few desires.” [He]... has faith... a sense of shame... scruples... energy... mindfulness... concentration... wisdom. The householder Hatthaka has wisdom himself, [yet] he does not wish to let others know, “I have wisdom.” On account of this the householder Hatthaka is said to have few desires. On account of what is the householder Hatthaka said to have faith? The householder Hatthaka has firm and deep faith in the Tathāgata. His faculty of faith is stable; he will never follow other renunciants or brahmins, or gods, Māras, Brahmās, or any other beings in the world. On account of this the householder Hatthaka is said to have faith. On account of what is the householder Hatthaka said to have a sense of shame? The householder Hatthaka has at all times a sense of shame. He approves of having a sense of shame and knows shame. [He knows] that evil, unwholesome states, being defiled and afflictive,

lead to evil retribution and are the root cause for birth and death. On account of this the householder Hatthaka is said to have a sense of shame. On account of what is the householder Hatthaka said to have scru ples? The householder Hatthaka has at all times scruples. He approves of the scruples and knows scruples. [He knows] that evil, unwholesome states, being defiled and afflictive, lead to evil retribution and are the root cause for birth and death. On account of this the householder Hatthaka is said to have scruples. On account of what is the householder Hatthaka said to have energy? The householder Hatthaka has energy at all times in discarding what is evil and unwholesome, and in cultivating wholesome states. He takes the initiative constantly and remains wholeheartedly and steadfastly established in the roots of wholesomeness, without giving up his task. On account of this the householder Hatthaka is said to have energy. On account of what is the householder Hatthaka said to be mindful? The householder Hatthaka internally contemplates the body as body.

.. feeling... the mind... _dhamma_ s as _dhamma_ s. On account of this the householder Hatthaka is said to be mindful. On account of what is the householder Hatthaka said to have con- centration? The householder Hatthaka, separated from desires, separated from evil and unwholesome states... (and so on up to)... dwells having attained the fourth absorption. On account of this the householder Hatthaka is said to have concentration. On account of what is the householder Hatthaka said to have wis- dom? The householder Hatthaka develops comprehension and wisdom, attains understanding concerning the rise and fall of phenomena, attains noble penetrative knowledge and discriminative understanding con- cerning the true cessation of suffering. On account of this the house- holder Hatthaka is said to have wisdom. It is on account of this that the householder Hatthaka is said to have eight wonderful and marvelous qualities. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
