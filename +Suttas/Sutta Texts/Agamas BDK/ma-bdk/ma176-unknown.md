### 176. The Discourse on Practitioners of the Absorptions

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: In the world there are actually four types of practitioners of the absorptions. What are the four? There is the practitioner of the absorptions who is progressing but thinks he is regressing; there is the practitioner of the absorptions who is regressing but thinks he is progressing; there is the practitioner of the absorptions who is regressing and knows, as it really is, that he is regress- ing; and there is the practitioner of the absorptions who is progressing and knows, as it really is, that he is progressing. How does a practitioner of the absorptions who is progressing think that he is regressing? The practitioner of the absorptions, secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states, with [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion, dwells having attained the first absorption. Cultivating right attention, his mind moves on from the first absorption to the second absorption, which is superior in calm and quietude. That practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “My mind has separated from the earlier characteristics and has moved to another sphere [of experience]. It has lost the first absorption; [that level of] concentration has ceased.” That practitioner of the absorptions does not know as it really is, that: “By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, has moved on from the first absorption to the second absorption, which is superior in calm and quietude.” Not knowing this as it really is, he [feels] as if he had regressed and his mind had lost [that level of] concentration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions progresses but thinks he is regressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, with the calming of [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with inner stillness and mental unification, without [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation,

with rapture and happiness born of concentration, dwells having attained the second absorption. Cultivating right attention, his mind moves on from the second absorp tion to the third absorption, which is superior in calm and quietude. That practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “My mind has separated from the earlier characteristics and has moved to another sphere [of experience]. It has lost the second absorption; [that level of] concentration has ceased.” That practitioner of the absorptions does not know as it really is, that: “By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, has pro gressed from the second absorption to the third absorption, which is supe rior in calm and quietude.” Not knowing this as it really is, he [feels] as if he had regressed and his mind had lost [that level of] concentration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions progresses but thinks he is regressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, secluded from rapture and pleasure, dwelling in equanimity and without seeking anything, with right mindfulness and right comprehension, experiencing happiness with the body, dwells having attained the third absorption, which the noble ones speak of as noble equanimity and mindfulness, a happy abode. Cultivating right attention, his mind moves on from the third absorption to the fourth absorption, which is superior in calm and quietude. That practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “My mind has separated from the earlier characteristics and has moved to another sphere [of experience]. It has lost the third absorption; [that level of] concentration has ceased.” That practitioner of the absorptions does not know as it really is, that: “By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, has moved on from the third absorption to the fourth absorption, which is superior in calm and quietude.” Not knowing this as it really is, he [feels] as if he had regressed and his mind had lost [that level of] concentration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions progresses but thinks he is regressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, with the cessation of pleasure and the cessation of pain, and with the earlier cessation of rapture and displeasure, with neither-pain-nor-pleasure, with purity of equanimity and mindfulness, dwells having attained the fourth absorption.

Cultivating right attention, his mind moves on from the fourth absorption to the sphere of infinite space, which is superior in calm and quietude. That practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “My mind has separated from the earlier characteristics and has moved to another sphere [of experience]. It has lost the fourth absorption; [that level of] concentration has ceased.” That practitioner of the absorptions does not know as it really is, that: “By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, has moved on from the fourth absorption to the sphere of infinite space, which is superior in calm and quietude.” Not knowing this as it really is, he [feels] as if he had regressed and his mind had lost [that level of] concentration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions progresses but thinks he is regressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, by completely transcending perceptions of form, with the cessation of perceptions of sensory impact, unaware of perceptions of diversity, [being instead aware of] infinite space, dwells having attained the sphere of infinite space. Cultivating right attention, his mind moves on from the sphere of infinite space to the sphere of infinite consciousness, which is superior in calm and quietude. That practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “My mind has separated from the earlier characteristics and has moved to another sphere [of experience]. It has lost the sphere of infinite space; [that level of] concentration has ceased.” That practitioner of the absorptions does not know as it really is, that: “By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, has moved on from the sphere of infinite space to the sphere of infinite consciousness, which is superior in calm and quietude.” Not knowing this as it really is, he [feels] as if he had regressed and his mind had lost [that level of] concentration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions progresses but thinks he is regressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, by completely transcending the sphere of infinite space, [aware] of infinite consciousness, dwells having attained the sphere of infinite consciousness. Cultivating right attention, his mind moves on from the sphere of infinite consciousness to the sphere of nothingness, which is superior in calm and quietude. That practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “My

mind has separated from the earlier characteristics and has moved to another sphere [of experience]. It has lost the sphere of infinite conscious- ness; [that level of] concentration has ceased.” That practitioner of the absorptions does not know as it really is, that: “By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, has moved on from the sphere of infinite consciousness to the sphere of nothingness, which is superior in calm and quietude.” Not knowing this as it really is, he [feels] as if he had regressed and his mind had lost [that level of] concentration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions progresses but thinks he is regressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, by completely transcending the sphere of infinite consciousness, [aware] that “there is nothing,” dwells having attained the sphere of nothingness. Cultivating right attention, his mind moves on from the sphere of noth- ingness to the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, which is superior in calm and quietude. That practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “My mind has separated from the earlier characteristics and has moved to another sphere [of experience]. It has lost the sphere of noth- ingness; [that level of] concentration has ceased.” That practitioner of the absorptions does not know as it really is, that: “By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, has moved on from the sphere of nothingness to the sphere of neither-perception- nor-nonperception, which is superior in calm and quietude.” Not knowing this as it really is, he [feels] as if he had regressed and his mind had lost [that level of] concentration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions progresses but thinks he is regressing. How does a practitioner of the absorptions who is regressing think he is progressing? The practitioner of the absorptions, secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states, with [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion, dwells having attained the first absorption. He gives attention to some other small perception in order to develop the path to the second absorption. That practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, will move from the first absorption toward the second absorption, which is superior in calm and quietude.”

[However,] that practitioner of the absorptions does not know, as it really is, that he should rather attend to a perception connected with disenchantment and enter the first absorption; he should not attend to some other small per- ception in order to enter the second absorption. Not knowing this as it really is, his mind inadvertently loses [that level of] concentration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions regresses but thinks he is progressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, with the calming of [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with inner stillness and mental unification, without [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with rapture and happiness born of concentration, dwells having attained the second absorption. He gives attention to some other small perception in order to develop the path to the third absorption. That practitioner of the absorptions thinks, “By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, will move on from the second absorption to the third absorption, which is superior in calm and quietude.” [However,] that practitioner of the absorptions does not know, as it really is, that he should rather attend to a perception connected with dis- enchantment and enter the second absorption; he should not attend to some other small perception in order to enter the third absorption. Not knowing this, as it really is, his mind inadvertently loses [that level of] concentration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions regresses but thinks he is progressing.

That practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, will move from the third absorption to the fourth absorption, which is superior in calm and quietude.” [However,] that practitioner of the absorptions does not know, as it really is, that he should rather attend to a perception connected with disenchantment

and enter the third absorption; he should not attend to some other small per ception in order to enter the fourth absorption. Not knowing this as it really is, his mind inadvertently loses [that level of] concentration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions regresses but thinks he is progressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, with the cessation of pleasure and the cessation of pain, and with the earlier cessation of rapture and displeasure, with neither-pain-nor-pleasure, with purity of equanimity and mindfulness, dwells having attained the fourth absorption. He gives attention to some other small perception in order to develop the path to the sphere of infinite space.

He attends to some other small perception in order to develop the path to the sphere of infinite consciousness. That practitioner of the absorptions thinks, “By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, will progress from the sphere of infinite space to the sphere of infinite consciousness, which is superior in calm and quietude.” [However,] that practitioner of the absorptions does not know, as it really is, that he should rather attend to a perception connected with dis enchantment and enter the sphere of infinite space; he should not attend to some other small perception in order to enter the sphere of infinite

consciousness. Not knowing this as it really is, his mind inadvertently loses [that level of] concentration. This is how a practitioner of the absorp- tions regresses but thinks he is progressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, by completely transcending the sphere of infinite space, [aware] of infinite consciousness, dwells having attained the sphere of infinite consciousness. He gives attention to some other small perception in order to develop the path to the sphere of nothingness. That practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, will progress from the sphere of infinite consciousness to the sphere of nothingness, which is superior in calm and quietude.” [However,] that practitioner of the absorptions does not know, as it really is, that he should rather attend to a perception connected with dis- enchantment and enter the sphere of infinite consciousness; he should not attend to some other small perception in order to enter the sphere of noth- ingness. Not knowing this as it really is, his mind inadvertently loses [that level of] concentration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions regresses but thinks he is progressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, by completely transcending the sphere of infinite consciousness, [aware] that “there is nothing,” dwells having attained the sphere of nothingness. He gives attention to some other small perception in order to develop the path to the sphere of nei- ther-perception-nor-nonperception. That practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, will move from the sphere of nothingness to the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, which is superior in calm and quietude.” [However,] that practitioner of the absorptions does not know, as it really is, that he should rather attend to a perception connected with dis- enchantment and enter the sphere of nothingness; he should not attend to some other small perception in order to enter the sphere of neither-per- ception-nor-nonperception. Not knowing this as it really is, his mind inad- vertently loses [that level of] concentration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions regresses but thinks he is progressing.

How does a practitioner of the absorptions who regresses know, as it really is, that he is regressing? The practitioner of the absorptions, having by a [certain] practice, a [certain] characteristic, and a [certain] mark, completely transcended the sphere of nothingness, [aware] of neither-per ception-nor-nonperception, dwells having attained the sphere of neither perception-nor-nonperception. He does not keep to that practice and is not mindful of that characteristic and that mark. He practices only mindfulness and perception connected with the sphere of nothingness, thereby fully regressing to that former [attainment]. The practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “My mind has separated from the earlier characteristics and is moving toward another sphere [of experience]. It has lost the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception; [that level of] concentration has ceased.” He knows as it really is: “Had it not regressed, the mind would not have lost [that level of] concentration.” This is how a practitioner of the absorptions regresses and knows, as it really is, that he is regressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, having by a [certain] practice, a [certain] characteristic, and a [certain] mark, completely transcended the sphere of infinite consciousness, [aware] that “there is nothing,” dwells having attained the sphere of nothingness. He does not keep to this practice, is not mindful of this characteristic and this mark. He practices only mindfulness and perception connected with the sphere of infinite consciousness, thereby fully regressing to that former [attainment].^412 The practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “My mind has separated from the earlier characteristics and is moving toward another sphere [of experience]. It has lost the sphere of nothingness; [that level of] concen tration has ceased.” He knows as it really is: “Had it not regressed, the mind would not have lost [that level of] concentration.” This is how a practitioner of the absorptions regresses and knows, as it really is, that he is regressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, having by a [certain] practice, a [certain] characteristic, and a [certain] mark, completely transcended

the sphere of infinite space, [aware] of infinite consciousness, dwells having attained the sphere of infinite consciousness. He does not keep to that practice, is not mindful of that characteristic and that mark. He practices only mindfulness and perception connected with the sphere of infinite space, thereby fully regressing to that former [attainment]. The practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “My mind is separated from the earlier characteristics and is moving toward another sphere [of experience]. It has lost the sphere of infinite ; [that level of] concentration has ceased.”^413 He knows as it really is: “Had it not regressed, the mind would not have lost [that level of] concentration.” This is how a practitioner of the absorptions regresses and knows, as it really is, that he is regressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, having by a [certain] practice, a [certain] characteristic, and a [certain] mark, completely transcended perceptions of form, with the cessation of perceptions of sensory impact, unaware of perceptions of diversity, [being instead aware] of infinite space, dwells having attained the sphere of infinite space. He does not keep to that practice, is not mindful of that characteristic and that mark. He practices only mindfulness and perception connected with delight in forms, thereby fully regressing to that former [experience]. The practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “My mind has separated from the earlier characteristics and is moving toward another sphere [of experience]. It has lost the sphere of infinite space; [that level of] concen- tration has ceased.” He knows as it really is: “Had it not regressed, the mind would not have lost [that level of] concentration.” This is how a practitioner of the absorp- tions regresses and knows, as it really is, that he is regressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, by a [certain] practice, a [cer- tain] characteristic, and a [certain] mark, with the cessation of pleasure and the cessation of pain, and with the earlier cessation of rapture and displeasure, with neither-pain-nor-pleasure, with purity of equanimity and mindfulness, dwells having attained the fourth absorption. He does not keep to that practice, is not mindful of that characteristic and

that mark. He practices only mindfulness and perception connected with the third absorption, thereby fully regressing to that former [attainment]. That practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “My mind has separated from the earlier characteristics and is moving toward another sphere [of experience]. It has lost the fourth absorption; [that level of] concentration has ceased.” He knows as it really is: “Had it not regressed, the mind would not have lost [that level of] concentration.” This is how a practitioner of the absorptions regresses and knows, as it really is, that he is regressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, having by a [certain] practice, a [certain] characteristic, and a [certain] mark become secluded from rap ture and pleasure, dwelling in equanimity and without seeking anything, with right mindfulness and right comprehension, experiencing happiness with the body, dwells having attained the third absorption, which the noble ones speak of as noble equanimity, mindfulness, a happy abode. He does not keep to that practice, is not mindful of that characteristic and that mark.

Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, by a [certain] practice, a [cer tain] characteristic, and a [certain] mark, with the calming of [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with inner stillness and mental unification, without [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with rapture and happiness born of concentration, dwells having attained the second absorption. He does not keep to that practice, is not mindful of that characteristic and that mark. He practices only mindfulness and perception connected with the first absorption, thereby fully regressing to that former [attainment]. That practitioner of the absorptions thinks, “My mind has separated

from the earlier characteristics and is moving toward another sphere [of experience]. It has lost the second absorption; [that level of] concentration has ceased.” He knows as it really is: “Had it not retrogressed, the mind would not have lost [that level of] concentration.” This is how a practitioner of the absorptions regresses and knows, as it really is, that he is regressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, having by a [certain] practice, a [certain] characteristic, and a [certain] mark, become secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states, with [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion, dwells having attained the first absorption. He does not keep to that practice, is not mindful of that characteristic and that mark. He practices only mindfulness and perception connected with delight in sensual pleasures, thereby fully regressing to that former [state]. That practitioner of the absorptions thinks, “My mind has separated from the earlier characteristics and is moving toward another sphere [of experience]. It has lost the first absorption; [that level of] concentration has ceased.” He knows as it really is: “Had it not regressed, the mind would not have lost [that level of] concentration.” This is how a practitioner of the absorptions regresses and knows, as it really is, that he is regressing. How does a practitioner of the absorptions who is progressing know, as it really is, that he is progressing? A practitioner of the absorptions, secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states, with [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with rapture and hap- piness born of seclusion, dwells having attained the first absorption. By cultivating right attention his mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, moves on from the first absorption toward the second absorption, which is superior in calm and quietude. The practitioner of the absorptions thinks, “By cul- tivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, is moving on from the first absorption toward the second absorption, which is superior in calm and quietude.” Knowing this as it really is, he realizes that his mind has not lost con- centration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions who is progressing knows, as it really is, that he is progressing.

Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, with the calming of [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with inner stillness and mental unification, without [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with rapture and happiness born of concentration, dwells having attained the second absorption. By cultivating right attention his mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, moves on from the second absorption toward the third absorption, which is supe rior in calm and quietude. That practitioner of the absorptions thinks, “By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, is moving on from the second absorption toward the third absorption, which is superior in calm and quietude.” Knowing this it as it really is, he realizes that his mind has not lost concentration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions progresses and knows, as it really is, that he is progressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, secluded from rapture and pleasure, dwelling in equanimity, not seeking anything, with right mind fulness and right comprehension, experiencing happiness with the body, dwells having attained the third absorption, which the noble ones speak of as noble equanimity and mindfulness, a happy abode. By cultivating right attention his mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, moves on from the third absorption toward the fourth absorption, which is superior in calm and quietude. The practitioner of the absorptions thinks, “By cul tivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, is moving on from the third absorption toward the fourth absorption, which is superior in calm and quietude.” Knowing this as it really is, he realizes that his mind has not lost con centration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions progresses and knows, as it really is, that he is progressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, with the cessation of pleasure and the cessation of pain, and with the earlier cessation of rapture and displeasure, with neither-pain-nor-pleasure, with purity of equanimity and mindfulness, dwells having attained the fourth absorption. By cultivating right attention his mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, moves on from the fourth absorption toward the sphere of infinite space, which is superior in calm and quietude. The practitioner of the absorptions thinks,

“By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, is moving on from the fourth absorption toward the sphere of infinite space, which is superior in calm and quietude.” Knowing this as it really is, he realizes that his mind has not lost con- centration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions progresses and knows, as it really is, that he is progressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, by completely transcending perceptions of form, with the cessation of perceptions of sensory impact, unaware of perceptions of diversity, [being instead aware] of infinite space, dwells having attained the sphere of infinite space. By cultivating right attention his mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, moves on from the sphere of infinite space toward the sphere of infinite conscious- ness, which is superior in calm and quietude. The practitioner of the absorp- tions thinks, “By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, is moving on from the sphere of infinite space toward the sphere of infinite consciousness, which is superior in calm and quietude.” Knowing this as it really is, he realizes that his mind has not lost con- centration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions progresses and knows, as it really is, that he is progressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, by completely transcending the sphere of infinite space, [aware] of infinite consciousness, dwells having attained the sphere of infinite consciousness. By cultivating right attention his mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, moves on from the sphere of infinite consciousness toward the sphere of noth- ingness, which is superior in calm and quietude. The practitioner of the absorptions thinks, “By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, is moving on from the sphere of infinite consciousness to the sphere of nothingness, which is superior in calm and quietude.” Knowing this as it really is, he realizes that his mind has not lost con- centration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions progresses and knows, as it really is, that he is progressing. Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, by completely transcending the sphere of infinite consciousness, [aware] that “there is nothing,” dwells having attained the sphere of nothingness.

By cultivating right attention his mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, moves on from the sphere of nothingness toward the sphere of neither-percep- tion-nor-nonperception, which is superior in calm and quietude. The prac- titioner of the absorptions thinks, “By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, is moving on from the sphere of nothingness toward the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, which is supe- rior in calm and quietude.” Knowing this as it really is, he realizes that his mind has not lost con- centration. This is how a practitioner of the absorptions progresses and knows, as it really is, that he is progressing. It was in relation to this that [I] earlier said, “In the world there are actually four types of practitioners of the absorptions.” Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
