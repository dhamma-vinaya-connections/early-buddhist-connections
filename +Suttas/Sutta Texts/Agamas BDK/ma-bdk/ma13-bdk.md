### 13. The Discourse on [Tenets to Be] Transcended

Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time, the World-honored One said to the monks:

There are three tenets to be transcended, [tenets held by those] of different affiliation, different appellation, different school, and different doctrine that, despite being well accepted, firmly held, and declared to others by so-called wise men, are not beneficial. What are these three? There are renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and declare: “All that a person does is caused by what was done in previous lives.” Again, there are renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and declare: “All that a person does is caused and created by a supreme divine being.” Again, there are renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and declare: “All that a person does is without any cause or condition.” Herein, if there are renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and declare: “All that a person does is caused by what was done in pre vious lives,” then I approach them and, having approached them, I ask: Venerable friends, is it true that you hold this view and declare: “All that a person does is caused by what was done in previous lives?” They reply: “Yes.” Then I say to them: If that is so, venerable friends, then you all endorse^75 killing living beings. Why is that? Because all is caused by what was done in previous lives[, therefore people cannot have moral responsibility for their actions]. In the same way, venerable friends, you endorse taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech... (and so on up to) wrong views. Why is that? Because all of that is caused by what was done in previous lives. Venerable friends, if the view that all is caused by what was done in previous lives were true, then it would follow logically^76 that all that one does or does not, takes place without desire, without effort. Venerable friends, if in doing a deed or not doing it, a person lacks true understanding, then he has lost right mindfulness and lacks right attentiveness, and hence is unteachable. If renunciants [and brahmins] proclaim such a teaching, then those renunciants and brahmins can be refuted by such reasoning.

Herein, if there are renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and declare: “All that a person does is caused and created by a supreme divine being,” then I approach them and, having approached, I ask:

Venerable friends, is it true that you hold this view and declare: “All that a person does is caused and created by a supreme divine being?”

They reply: “Yes.” Then I say to them:

If that is so, venerable friends, then you all endorse killing living beings. Why is that? Because all is caused and created by a supreme divine being. In the same way, venerable friends, you endorse tak ing what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech... (and so on up to) wrong views. Why? Because all of that is caused and created by a supreme divine being. Venerable friends, if the view that all is caused and created by a supreme divine being were true, then it would follow logically that all that one does or does not, takes place without desire, without effort. Venerable friends, if in doing a deed or not doing it, a person lacks true understanding, then he has lost right mindfulness and lacks right attentiveness, and hence is unteachable.

If renunciants [and brahmins] proclaim this teaching, then those renun- ciants and brahmins can be refuted by such reasoning. Herein, if there are renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and declare: “All that a person does is without any cause or condition,” then I approach them and, having approached, I ask:

Venerable friends, is it true that you hold this view and declare: “All that a person does is without any cause or condition?”

They reply: “Yes.” Then I say to them:

If that is so, venerable friends, then you all endorse killing living beings. Why is that? Because all is without any cause or condition. In the same way, venerable friends, you endorse taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech... (and so on up to) wrong views. Why? Because all of that is without any cause or

condition. Venerable friends, if the view that all is without any cause or condition were true, then it would follow logically that all that one does or does not, takes place without desire, without effort. Venerable friends, if in doing a deed or not doing it, a person lacks true understanding, then he has lost right mindfulness and lacks right attentiveness, and hence is unteachable. If renunciants [and brahmins] proclaim such a teaching, then those renunciants and brahmins can be refuted by such reasoning. The Dharma I teach to you, which I have known and realized by myself, cannot be refuted, cannot be defiled, and cannot be prevailed over by any renunciant, brahmin, gods, Māras, Brahmās, or anyone else in the world. Why can the Dharma I teach to you, which I have known and realized by myself, not be refuted, defiled, or prevailed over by any renunciant, brahmin, gods, Māras, Brahmās, or anyone else in the world? There is the teaching on the six sense bases, which, having known and realized it by myself, I have taught to you; it cannot be refuted, cannot be defiled, and cannot be prevailed over by any renunciant, brahmin, gods, Māras, Brahmās, or anyone else in the world. Again, there is the teaching on the six elements, which, having known and realized it by myself, I have taught to you; it cannot be refuted, cannot be defiled, and cannot be prevailed over by any renunciant, brahmin, gods, Māras, Brahmās, or anyone else in the world. What is the teaching on the six sense bases, which, having known and realized it by myself, I have taught to you? [The six] are the eye sense base, the ear... nose... tongue... body... [and] the mind sense base. This is the teaching on the six sense bases which, having known and realized it by myself, I have taught to you. What is the teaching on the six elements which, having known and realized it by myself, I have taught to you? [The six] are the elements of earth... water... fire... air... space... and the element of consciousness. This is the teaching on the six elements which, having known and real ized it by myself, I have taught to you. Because of the combination of the six elements, there is rebirth from a mother’s womb; because of the six elements, there are the six sense bases; because of the six sense bases, there is contact; and because

of contact there is feeling. Monks, one who has feeling will [be able to] know suffering as it really is, know the arising of suffering, know the cessation of suffering, and know the path to the cessation of the suffering as it really is. What is knowing suffering as it really is? It is this: birth is suffering, old age is suffering, disease is suffering, death is suffering, association with what is disliked is suffering, dissociation from what is liked is suffering, not getting what one wants is suffering; in brief, the five aggregates of clinging are suffering—this is called knowing suffering as it really is. What is knowing the arising of suffering as it really is? It is craving for and clinging to future existence, with delight and desire, seeking after this and that [state of] existence—this is called knowing the arising of suffering as it really is. What is knowing the cessation of suffering as it really is? It is the cutting off without remainder, abandoning, disgorging, fading away, cessation, stopping, and disappearance of this craving for and clinging to future existence, with delight and desire, seeking after this and that [state of] existence—this is called knowing the cessation of suffering as it really is. What is knowing the path to the cessation of suffering as it really is? It is the noble eightfold path: right view... (and so on up to) right concentration, these eight—this is called knowing the path to the ces- sation of suffering as it really is. Monks, you should know suffering as it really is, you should cut off the arising of suffering, you should realize the cessation of suffering, and you should cultivate the path to the cessation of suffering. If a monk knows suffering as it really is, cuts off the arising of suffering, realizes the cessation of suffering, and cultivates the path to the cessation of suffering, then that monk, having abandoning all taints, having loos- ened all fetters, is able through right attentiveness to attain the end of suffering. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
