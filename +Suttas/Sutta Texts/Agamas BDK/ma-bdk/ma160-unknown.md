### 160. The Discourse on Araka

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time, after the midday meal, the monks were sitting together in the assembly hall discussing this matter:

Venerable friends, it is extraordinary. It is extraordinary how very short is human life, [after which] one has to pass on to the next life. One should do what is wholesome, one should practice the holy life, for whoever is born will die. Yet, as regards practice of the Dharma, practice that is ben- eficial, practice that is wholesome, practice that is sublime, people in this present life do not act and strive [accordingly]. At that time the World-honored One was passing the day’s abiding else- where. With the purified divine ear, which surpasses the human [ear], he heard those monks sitting together in the assembly hall after the midday meal discussing this matter:

Venerable friends, it is extraordinary. It is extraordinary how very short is human life, [after which] one has to pass on to the next life. One should

do what is wholesome, one should practice the holy life, for whoever is born will die. Yet, as regards practice of the Dharma, practice that is ben eficial, practice that is wholesome, practice that is sublime, people in this present life do not act and strive [accordingly]. Having heard this, in the late afternoon the World-honored One rose from sitting in meditation and approached the assembly hall. He sat down on a seat prepared in front of the assembly of monks and asked the monks, “What matter were you discussing? For what purpose have you come to sit together in the assembly hall?” Then the monks said: World-honored One, we monks assembled and, being seated together in the assembly hall after the midday meal, were discussing this matter: “Venerable friends, it is extraordinary. It is extraordinary how very short is human life, [after which] one has to pass on to the next life. One should do what is wholesome, one should practice the holy life, for whoever is born will die. Yet, as regards practice of the Dharma, practice that is ben eficial, practice that is wholesome, practice that is sublime, people in this present life do not act and strive [accordingly].” World-honored One, this is the matter we have been discussing. It is for this reason that we are seated together in the assembly hall. The World-honored One exclaimed: It is well, it is well, monks, that you were talking like this: “Venerable friends, it is extraordinary. It is extraordinary how very short is human life, [after which] one has to pass on to the next life. One should do what is wholesome; one should practice the holy life, for whoever is born will die. Yet, as regards practice of the Dharma, practice that is beneficial, practice that is wholesome, practice that is sublime, people in this present life do not act and strive [accordingly].” Why is that? I too say this: “It is extraordinary. It is extraordinary how very short is human life, [after which] one has to pass on to the next life. One should do what is whole some, one should practice the holy life, for whoever is born will die. Yet, as regards practice of the Dharma, practice that is beneficial, practice that

is wholesome, practice that is sublime, people in this present life do not act and strive [accordingly].” Why is that? In former times, in the past, the life span of living beings was eighty thousand years. Monks, when the human life span was eighty thousand years, this Jambudīpa was flourishing greatly and delightful, with plenty of wealth and treasures, and with villages and towns close together, only a chicken’s flight apart. Monks, when the human life span was eighty thousand years, women were marriageable at five hundred years of age. Monks, when the human life span was eighty thousand years, the only diseases that existed were these: cold, heat, the need to urinate and defecate, sensual desire, hunger, and old age. There were no other afflictions. Monks, when the human life span was eighty thousand years, there was a king named Koravya, who was a wheel-turning monarch, intelligent and wise. Equipped with a fourfold army, he reigned over the entire world, freely, as he liked. Being a righteous Dharma king, he had attained the seven treasures. Those seven treasures are: the wheel treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse treasure, the jewel treasure, the woman treasure, the steward treasure, and the counselor treasure—these are the seven. He had a thousand sons, handsome, brave, fearless, and able to overcome the troops of others. He certainly ruled over the whole earth, as far as the ocean, without relying on sword or club, just by teaching the Dharma, bringing peace and happiness. Monks, King Koravya had a brahmin named Araka, a great elder, who was born of parents of pure descent. For seven generations on both his father’s and his mother’s sides there had been uninterrupted continuity of births without blemish. He had learned much and retained it, and was able to recite it. He was a master of the four Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth. Monks, the brahmin Araka had countless hundreds and thousands of young brahmin students. Dwelling in a secluded place, the brahmin Araka taught the sacred texts to his countless hundreds and thousands of young brahmin students. At that time the brahmin Araka, dwelling alone in a secluded place, sat in meditation and reflection. He had this thought in his mind: “It is

extraordinary. It is extraordinary how very short is human life, [after which] one has to pass on to the next life. One should do what is whole some; one should practice the holy life, for whoever is born will die. Yet, as regards practice of the Dharma, practice that is beneficial, practice that is wholesome, practice that is sublime, people in this present life do not act and strive [accordingly]. Let me now shave off hair and beard, don the yellow robes and, out of faith, go forth from the household life to train in the path.” Then the brahmin Araka approached his group of many young brahmin students from various countries and said, “Young brahmin students, while dwelling alone in a secluded place, I sat in meditation and reflection. I had this thought in my mind: ‘It is extraordinary. It is extraordinary how very short is human life, [after which] one has to pass on to the next life. One should do what is wholesome; one should practice the holy life, for whoever is born will die. Yet, as regards practice of the Dharma, practice that is beneficial, practice that is wholesome, practice that is sublime, people in this present life do not act and strive [accordingly]. Let me now shave off hair and beard, don the yellow robes, and, out of faith, go forth from the household life to train in the path.’ Young brahmin students, I now wish to shave off hair and beard, don the yellow robes, and, out of faith, go forth from the household life to train in the path. What will you do?” The group of many young brahmin students from various countries said, “Venerable teacher, whatever we know, we have received it all through the teacher’s kindness. If the venerable teacher shaves off hair and beard, dons the yellow robes, and, out of faith, goes forth from the household life to train in the path, then we too will shave off hair and beard, don the yellow robes, and, out of faith, go forth from the household life to train in the path under our venerable teacher.” Then at a later time the brahmin Araka shaved off hair and beard, donned the yellow robes, and, out of faith, went forth from the household life to train in the path; and the group of many young brahmin students from various countries also shaved off hair and beard, donned the yellow robes, and, out of faith, went forth from the household life to train in the path under their venerable teacher. Thus arose the designations “the venerable teacher Araka” and “the disciples of the venerable teacher Araka.”

At that time the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma:^280 “Brahmin students, it is extraordinary. It is extraordinary how very short is human life, [after which] one has to pass on to the next life. One should do what is wholesome, one should practice the holy life, for whoever is born will die. Yet, as regards practice of the Dharma, practice that is beneficial, practice that is wholesome, practice that is sublime, people in this present life do not act and strive [accordingly].” Thus at that time the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma: “Brahmin students, it is extraordinary. It is extraordinary how very short is human life, [after which] one has to pass on to the next life. One should do what is wholesome, one should practice the holy life, for whoever is born will die. Yet, as regards practice of the Dharma, practice that is beneficial, practice that is wholesome, practice that is sublime, people in this present life do not act and strive [accordingly].” In this way the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma. Again, the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma: “Brahmin students, it is just like a drop of dew on grass in the morning. It disappears [as] the sun rises, not lasting long. Such, brahmin students, is human life, it is like dew in the morning. To get even a trifling amount of gratification is very difficult; and it [brings] great suffering and adversity, exceedingly much adversity.” In this way the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma. Again, the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma: “Brahmin students, it is just as, at a time of great rain, the water drops form bubbles which arise and pass away. Such, brahmin students, is human life, it is like a bubble. To get even a trifling amount of gratification is very difficult; and it [brings] great suffering and adversity, exceedingly much adversity.” In this way the venerable teacher Araka taught his dis- ciples the Dharma. Again, the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma: “Brahmin students, it is just as writing with a stick by inserting it into water, which quickly returns again [to its former condition].^281 Such, brah- min students, is human life, it is like writing with a stick by inserting it into water, which quickly returns again [to its former condition]. To get even a trifling amount of gratification is very difficult; and it [brings] great

suffering and adversity, exceedingly much adversity.” In this way the ven- erable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma. Again, the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma: “Brahmin students, it is just like putting a new earthenware pot into water and quickly taking it out again;^282 exposed to wind and heat, it quickly dries out.^283 Such, brahmin students, is human life, it is like a new earth- enware pot that after being placed in water quickly dries out. To get even a trifling amount of gratification is very difficult; and it [brings] great suf- fering and adversity, exceedingly much adversity.” In this way the ven- erable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma. Again, the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma: “Brahmin students, it is just as a small piece of meat placed in a big caldron of water under which a blazing fire is burning, it quickly disappears com- pletely.^284 Such, brahmin students, is human life, it is like meat melting away. To get even a trifling amount of gratification is very difficult; and it [brings] great suffering and adversity, exceedingly much adversity.” In this way the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma. Again, the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma: “Brahmin students, it is just like a thief who has been bound and is being taken to the signpost beneath which he is to be executed.^285 As he lifts his feet, step by step he approaches death, step by step he approaches the end of his life. Such, brahmin students, is human life, it is like a thief who has been bound and is being taken to the signpost beneath which he is to be exe- cuted. To get even a trifling amount of gratification is very difficult; and it [brings] great suffering and adversity, exceedingly much adversity.” In this way the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma. Again, the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma: “Brahmin students, it is just like an ox being led by a butcher to be slaugh- tered. As it lifts its feet, step by step it approaches death, step by step it approaches the end of its life. Such, brahmin students, is human life, it is like an ox being led to be slaughtered. To get even a trifling amount of gratification is very difficult; and it [brings] great suffering and adversity, exceedingly much adversity.” In this way the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma.

Again, the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma: “Brahmin students, it is just like a loom weaving [cloth]; with each movement, it comes nearer to completion, nearer to the end.^286 Such, brahmin students, is the life of a human being: it is like a loom nearing completion of the weav- ing. To get even a trifling amount of gratification is very difficult; and it [brings] great suffering and adversity, exceedingly much adversity.” In this way the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma. Again, the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma: “Brahmin students, it is just like a mountain stream which, having grown rapidly, flows quickly,^287 carrying flotsam along with it. Its water flows swiftly, not stopping for a moment.^288 Such, brahmin students, is the human life span, moving quickly and not stopping for a moment. Such, brahmin students, is human life, like a quickly flowing river. To get even a trifling amount of gratification is very difficult; and it [brings] great suffering and adversity, exceedingly much adversity.” In this way the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma. Again, the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma: “Brahmin students, it is just as when, in the dark of night, one throws a staff onto the ground.^289 It may land with its head down, it may land with its head up, again it may land on its side; it may land in a clean place, or it may land in an unclean place. Such, brahmin students, are living beings obscured by ignorance and bound by craving. They may be reborn in hell, they may be reborn as animals, they may be reborn as hungry ghosts, they may be reborn in a heaven, or they may be reborn in the human realm. Such, brahmin stu- dents, is human life, like a staff thrown onto the ground in the dark. To get even a trifling amount of gratification is very difficult; and it [brings] great suffering and adversity, exceedingly much adversity.” In this way the ven- erable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma.^290 Again, the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma: “Brahmin students, I have abandoned and discarded covetousness regard- ing the world. With my mind free of agitation, on seeing others’ wealth and all their requisites of life, I do not give rise to covetousness with the wish ‘May I get it!’ I have purified my mind of covetousness. In the same way, I have abandoned ill will... sloth-and-torpor... restlessness-and- worry.... I have abandoned doubt regarding the world and overcome

uncertainty. Being without vacillation in regard to wholesome states, I have purified my mind of doubt. “Brahmin students, you too should abandon and remove covetousness regarding the world. Having a mind without strife, on seeing others’ wealth and all their requisites of life, do not give rise to covetousness with the wish ‘May I get it!’ Purify your mind of covetousness. In the same way, abandon ill will... sloth-and-torpor... restlessness-and-worry... abandon doubt regarding the world and overcome uncertainty, being without vac illation regarding wholesome states.” In this way the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma. Again, the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma: “Brahmin students, with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, I dwell [men tally] pervading one direction, likewise the second, the third, and the fourth direction, and also the four intermediate directions and above and below, all around, everywhere. With a mind imbued with loving-kindness, free of fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention, I dwell pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well-cul tivated. In the same way, with a mind imbued with compassion... with empathic joy... with equanimity, free of fetters or resentment, without ill will or conflict, I dwell pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well-cultivated. “Brahmin students, with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, you too should dwell [mentally] pervading one direction, likewise the second, the third, and the fourth direction, and also the four intermediate directions and above and below, all around, everywhere. With a mind imbued with loving kindness, free of fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention, dwell pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeas urable, and well cultivated. In the same way, with a mind imbued with com passion... with empathic joy... with equanimity, free of fetters or resentment, without ill will or conflict, dwell pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well-cultivated.” In this way the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma. Again, the venerable teacher Araka explained to his disciples the teach ing of the Brahmā realm. When the venerable teacher Araka explained the teaching of the Brahmā realm, there were some of the disciples who

did not completely accept the teaching. After death they were reborn among the Four Heavenly Kings, or they were reborn among the _deva_ s of the Thirty-three, or they were reborn among the Yāma _deva_ s, or they were reborn among the Tusita _deva_ s, or they were reborn among the _deva_ s who Delight in Creating, or they were reborn among the _deva_ s who Wield Power over Others’ Creations. When the venerable teacher Araka explained the teaching of the Brahmā realm, there were some of the disciples who completely accepted the teaching. Cultivating the four divine abodes ( _brahmavihāra_ s) and separating themselves from sensual desires, after death they were reborn among the Brahmā _deva_ s. At that time the venerable teacher Araka thought, “It is not appropriate for me to be equal to my disciples, being reborn together with them in the next life in one place. Let me now further cultivate a superior loving-kind- ness. Having further cultivated a superior loving-kindness, after death I will be reborn among the Ābhassara _deva_ s.” At a later time the venerable teacher Araka further cultivated a superior loving-kindness. Having further cultivated a superior loving-kindness, after death he was reborn among the Ābhassara _deva_ s. The path in which the venerable teacher Araka and his disciples trained was not vain. They attained great fruit. Monks, what do you think? Was the venerable teacher Araka of ancient times someone else? Do not think this. Why is that? Monks, you should know that he was myself. At that time I was called “the venerable teacher Araka.” At that time I had countless hundreds and thousands of disciples. At that time I explained to my disciples the teaching about the Brahmā realm. When I explained the teaching about the Brahmā realm, some of my disciples did not fully accept the teaching, and after death they were reborn among the Four Heavenly Kings, or they were reborn among the _deva_ s of the Thirty-three, or they were reborn among the Yāma _deva_ s, or they were reborn among the Tusita _deva_ s, or they were reborn among the _deva_ s who Delight in Creating, or they were reborn among the _deva_ s who Wield Power over Others’ Creations. When I explained the teaching about the Brahmā realm, some of my disciples completely accepted the teaching. Cultivating the four divine abodes and separating themselves from sensual desires, after death they were reborn among the Brahmā _deva_ s. At that time I thought, “It is not appropriate for me to be equal to my

disciples, being reborn together with them in one place in the next life. Let me now further cultivate a superior loving-kindness. Having further cultivated a superior loving-kindness, after death I will be reborn among the Ābhassara deva s.” At a later time I further cultivated a superior lov ing-kindness. Having cultivated a superior loving-kindness, after death I was reborn among the Ābhassara deva s. The path in which I and my dis ciples trained at that time was not vain. We attained great fruit. At that time I benefited myself, benefited others, benefited many people. I had compassion for the whole world and I sought prosperity, benefit, peace, and happiness for deva s and human beings. [However,] the teaching that I taught at that time did not reach fulfillment, it did not fulfill purification, it did not fulfill the holy life. Not having fulfilled the holy life, at that time I did not become free from birth, aging, disease, death, sorrow, and distress, and I was not yet able to attain liberation from all dukkha. Monks, I have now appeared in this world as a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a well-gone one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassable person, a leader on the path of Dharma, a teacher of deva s and human beings, called a buddha, an exalted one. I now benefit myself, benefit others, benefit many people. I have compassion for the whole world and I seek prosperity, ben efit, peace, and happiness for deva s and human beings. I now teach the Dharma, having reached fulfillment, having fulfilled purification, having fulfilled the holy life. Having completely fulfilled the holy life, I am now free from birth, aging, disease, death, sorrow, and distress. I have now attained liberation from all dukkha. Monks, “Very short is human life, [after which] one has to pass on to the next life. One should do what is wholesome, one should practice the holy life, for whoever is born will die.” Monks, this is rightly spoken now. Why is that? Because the [human] life span now extends to only a hundred years, or perhaps a little more. One who has such a life span lives for three hundred seasons—a hun dred springs, a hundred summers, and a hundred winters. He lives for one thousand two hundred months—four hundred months of spring, four hundred months of summer, and four hundred months of winter—so he lives for one thousand two hundred months.

He lives for two thousand four hundred fortnights—eight hundred fort- nights of spring, eight hundred fortnights of summer, and eight hundred fortnights of winter—so he lives for two thousand four hundred fortnights. [He lives] for thirty-six thousand days and nights—twelve thousand days and nights of spring, twelve thousand days and nights of summer, and twelve thousand days and nights of winter—so he lives for thirty-six thousand days and nights. He eats seventy-two thousand meals, including the times of being pre- vented [from eating] and the times of being breastfed. Being prevented [from eating] happens when one cannot eat because of pain, cannot eat because of anger, cannot eat because of sickness, cannot eat because of being busy, cannot eat because one is traveling, cannot eat because one is with the king, cannot eat because one is observing a day of purification, or cannot eat because one cannot get [food]. That is to say, monks, [a person] with a one-hundred-year life span lives to the age of one hundred counted by years, [which alternatively could be] counted by seasons, counted by years and seasons, counted by months, counted by fortnights, counted by months and fortnights, counted by days, counted by nights, counted by days and nights, counted by meals, counted by prevention [from eating], or counted by meals and prevention [from eating]. Monks, what a teacher should do for his disciples out of great com- passion, mercy, sympathy, and concern, seeking their benefit and welfare, seeking their safety and well-being, that I have now already done. You too should do your part. Go and sit in meditation and contemplation in a secluded place, on a mountain, in a forest, at the base of a tree, in an empty and quiet place. Do not be negligent. Make a diligent effort, lest you regret it later. This is my instruction, this is my teaching. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
