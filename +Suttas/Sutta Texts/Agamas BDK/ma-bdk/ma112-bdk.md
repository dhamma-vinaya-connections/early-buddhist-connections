### 112. The Discourse Spoken at Anupiya

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying among the Vajjīs in the Vajjī village of Anupiya. At that time the World-honored One rose from his meditation seat in the late afternoon, came down from the hall, and said, “Ānanda, come with me to the Aciravatī River to bathe.” Venerable Ānanda replied, “Yes.” Thereupon, the World-honored One, followed by Venerable Ānanda, went to the Aciravatī River. They took off their robes, placed them on the bank, and entered the water to bathe. Having bathed, they came out again, wiped their bodies dry, and put on their robes. At that time Venerable Ānanda was holding a fan and fanning the Buddha. The World-honored One turned to him and said: Ānanda, because Devadatta is negligent, he will fall into extreme suffering. He will certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell to stay for an entire eon, unable to find relief. Ānanda, have you not heard from the [other] monks that I have definitely declared that Devadatta will certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell to stay for an entire eon, unable to find relief? Venerable Ānanda replied, “Yes, I have.”

At that time there was a certain monk who had asked Venerable Ānanda, “Is it because the World-honored One used the knowledge of the minds of others to discern Devadatta’s mind that he has definitely declared that Deva- datta will certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell to stay for an entire eon, unable to find relief?”^323 [In relation to that question,] the World-honored One said:

Ānanda, that monk may have been young, middle-aged, or old, [but] he was as ignorant as a youngster. Why is that? He had doubts because the Tathāgata has definitely declared this. Ānanda, I do not see in this world, with its deva s, māra s, Brahmās, renunciants, and brahmins, from human beings to deva s, [anyone else] about whom I would definitely declare what I have declared about Devadatta. Why is that? Ānanda, I have declared that Devadatta will certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell to stay for an entire eon, unable to find relief. Ānanda, if I saw that Devadatta had any pure state in him, amounting even to a single hair, then I would not definitely declare that Devadatta will certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell to stay for an entire eon, unable to find relief. [However,] Ānanda, I do not see that Devadatta has any pure state, amounting even to a single hair, within him. Therefore I have definitely declared that Devadatta will certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell to stay for an entire eon, unable to find relief. Ānanda, it is as if not far from a village there is a big deep cesspit, and someone had fallen into it and sunk to the bottom. Suppose that someone else comes along and is moved to much compassion, mercy, sympathy, and concern, seeking to benefit him, seeking his security and happiness. That person, having come [to the pit], walks around it looking at him and says, “Does this man have even one spot, amounting to a single hair, that is not contaminated by excrement, by which I could grasp him and pull him out?” [But] having looked him over carefully he does not see that the man has even one clean spot, amounting to a single hair, that is not contaminated by excrement, that he could grasp with his hand and pull him out. In the same way, Ānanda, if I saw that Devadatta had any pure state in him, even amounting to a single hair, then I would not definitely declare

that Devadatta will certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell to stay for an entire eon, unable to find relief. [But,] Ānanda, I do not see that Devadatta has any pure state in him, not even amounting to a single hair. Therefore I have definitely declared that Devadatta will cer- tainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell to stay for an entire eon, unable to find relief. Thereupon, Venerable Ānanda wept.^324 Wiping the tears away with his hands, he said:

It is marvelous, World-honored One, it is extraordinary that the World- honored One has definitely declared that Devadatta will certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell, to stay for an entire eon, unable to find relief. The World-honored One said: Indeed, Ānanda. Indeed, Ānanda, I have declared that Devadatta will cer- tainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell to stay for an entire eon, unable to find relief. Ānanda, if you hear from the Tathāgata the explanation of the “great knowledge of discerning people’s faculties,” then you will certainly gain supreme faith in the Tathāgata and your heart will be delighted. At this, Venerable Ānanda extended his hands with palms together toward the Buddha and said:

World-honored One, now is the right time. Well-gone One, now is the right time. May the World-honored One explain to the monks the great knowledge of discerning people’s faculties. The monks, on hearing it from the World-honored One, will remember it well. The World-honored One said, “Ānanda, listen closely and pay proper attention. I will now explain to you the great knowledge of discerning people’s faculties.” Venerable Ānanda listened to receive the instruction. The World-honored One said: Ānanda, the Tathāgata uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe another person’s mind, and knows that this person has accomplished

wholesome qualities and accomplished unwholesome qualities. Later the Tathāgata again uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe this person’s mind and knows that this person’s wholesome qualities have ceased and unwholesome qualities have arisen. [Although] this per- son’s wholesome qualities have ceased and unwholesome qualities have arisen, a remainder of wholesome roots has not been cut off, and from these wholesome roots the wholesome will grow back again. In this way this person gains in pure qualities. Ānanda, it is just as when the morning sun first appears, the darkness ceases and light arises. What do you think, Ānanda: when the sun rises higher and mealtime arrives [at midday], has not the darkness already ceased and the light arisen?^325

Venerable Ānanda replied, “It is like this, World-honored One.” [The World-honored One said:]

In the same way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe another person’s mind, and knows that this person has accomplished wholesome qualities and accomplished unwholesome qualities. Later the Tathāgata again uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe this person’s mind and knows that this person’s whole- some qualities have ceased and his unwholesome qualities have arisen. [Although] this person’s wholesome qualities have ceased and his unwhole- some qualities have arisen, a remainder of his wholesome roots has not been cut off, and from these wholesome roots the wholesome will grow back again. In this way, this person gains in pure qualities. Ānanda, it is like seeds of grain, unspoiled and undamaged, not rotten or broken, unharmed by wind and heat, which were stored safely in autumn. If a householder tends the seeds well in a fertile field and they are watered by timely rain, what do you think, Ānanda: will those seeds grow and thrive?

Venerable Ānanda replied, “They will, World-honored One.” [The World-honored One said:]

In the same way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe another person’s mind, and knows that this person has accomplished wholesome qualities and accomplished unwholesome

qualities. Later the Tathāgata again uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe this person’s mind, and knows that this person’s whole some qualities have ceased and his unwholesome qualities have arisen. [Although] this person’s wholesome qualities have ceased and his unwhole some qualities have arisen, a remainder of his wholesome roots has not been cut off, and from these wholesome roots the wholesome will grow back again. In this way this person gains in pure qualities. Ānanda, this is what is called the Tathāgata’s great knowledge of people’s faculties. This is how the Tathāgata correctly knows the roots of all qualities. Again, Ānanda, the Tathāgata uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe another person’s mind, and he knows that this person has accomplished wholesome qualities and accomplished unwholesome qualities. Later the Tathāgata again uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe this person’s mind, and knows that this person’s whole some qualities have ceased and his unwholesome qualities have arisen. [Although] this person’s wholesome qualities have ceased and his unwhole some qualities have arisen, a remainder of his wholesome roots has not been cut off, [yet] they certainly will be cut off in the future. Thus, this person is of a nature to decline and regress.^326 Ānanda, it is just as when the sun is sinking in the late afternoon the light [begins to] cease and darkness descends. What do you think, Ānanda, once the sun has set, will not the light [totally] cease and [total] darkness descend? Venerable Ānanda replied, “It will be so, World-honored One.” [The World-honored One said:] In the same way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe another person’s mind, and knows that this person has accomplished wholesome qualities and accomplished unwholesome qualities. Later the Tathāgata again uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe this person’s mind, and knows that this person’s whole some qualities have ceased and his unwholesome qualities have arisen. [Although] this person’s wholesome qualities have ceased and his unwhole some qualities have arisen, a remainder of his wholesome roots has not been cut off, [yet] they certainly will be cut off in the future. In this way, this person is of a nature to decline and regress.

Ānanda, it is like seeds of grain, unspoiled and undamaged, not rotten or broken, unharmed by wind and heat, which were stored safely in autumn. If a householder tends the seeds well in a fertile field but they are not watered by timely rain, what do you think, Ānanda: will those seeds grow and thrive?

Venerable Ānanda replied, “They will not, World-honored One.” [The World-honored One said:]

In the same way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe another person’s mind, and knows that this person has accomplished wholesome qualities and accomplished unwholesome qualities. Later the Tathāgata again uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe this person’s mind, and knows that this person’s whole- some qualities have ceased and his unwholesome qualities have arisen. [Although] this person’s wholesome qualities have ceased and his unwhole- some qualities have arisen, a remainder of his wholesome roots has not been cut off, [yet] they certainly will be cut off in the future. Thus this person is of a nature to decline and regress. Ānanda, this is what is called the Tathāgata’s great knowledge of people’s faculties. This is how the Tathāgata correctly knows the roots of all qualities. Again, Ānanda, the Tathāgata uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe another person’s mind, [realizing,] “I do not see in this person any pure quality at all, not even amounting to a single hair. This person is definitely filled with evil and unwholesome defiling qualities. These are the roots of future becoming, resulting in trouble and suffering, the cause of birth, old age, disease, and death. On the breaking up of the body at death, such a person will certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell.” Ānanda, it is like seeds of grain that are spoiled and damaged, rotten and broken, harmed by wind and heat, not having been stored safely in autumn. If a householder sows these seeds in a barren field, does not tend them well, and the rains are not timely, what do you think, Ānanda: will those seeds grow and thrive?

Venerable Ānanda replied, “They will not, World-honored One.”

[The World-honored One said:] In the same way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe another person’s mind, [realizing,] “I do not see in that person any pure quality at all, not even amounting to a single hair. That person is definitely filled with evil and unwholesome defiling qualities. These are the roots of future becoming, resulting in trouble and suffering, the cause of birth, old age, disease, and death. On the breaking up of the body at death, such a person will certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell.” Ānanda, this is what is called the Tathāgata’s great knowledge of people’s faculties. This is how the Tathāgata correctly knows the roots of all qualities. At this Venerable Ānanda extended his hands with palms together toward the Buddha and said, “The World-honored One has now explained three types of person in this way. Could he also explain the [corresponding] other three types of person?” The World-honored One said: He can explain them. Ānanda, the Tathāgata uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe another person’s mind, and knows that this person has accomplished unwholesome qualities and accomplished whole some qualities. Later the Tathāgata again uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe this person’s mind, and finds that this person’s unwholesome qualities have ceased and his wholesome qualities have arisen. [Although] this person’s unwholesome qualities have ceased and his wholesome qualities have arisen, a remainder of his unwholesome roots has not been cut off, and from these unwholesome roots the unwhole some can grow back again. In this way this person is of a nature to decline and regress.^327 Ānanda, it is as with a fire that has just begun burning, when only a single tongue of flame is burning, and then someone feeds it with dry grass or dead wood. What do you think, Ānanda: will that fire increase and flare up? Venerable Ānanda replied, “It will, World-honored One.” [The World-honored One said:]

In the same way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe another person’s mind, and knows that this person has accomplished unwholesome qualities and accomplished wholesome qualities. Later the Tathāgata again uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe this person’s mind, and finds that this person’s unwhole- some qualities have ceased and his wholesome qualities have arisen. [Although] this person’s unwholesome qualities have ceased and his wholesome qualities have arisen, a remainder of his unwholesome roots has not yet been cut off, and from these unwholesome roots the unwhole- some can grow back again. In this way this person is of a nature to decline and regress. Ānanda, this is what is called the Tathāgata’s great knowledge of people’s faculties. This is how the Tathāgata correctly discerns the roots of all qualities. Again, Ānanda, the Tathāgata uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe another person’s mind, and knows that this person has accomplished unwholesome qualities and accomplished wholesome qual- ities. Later the Tathāgata again uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe this person’s mind, and finds that this person’s unwholesome qualities have ceased and his wholesome qualities have arisen. [Although] this person’s unwholesome qualities have ceased and his wholesome qual- ities have arisen, a remainder of his unwholesome roots has not been cut off, [yet] they will certainly be cut off in the future, and in this way this person will be of a nature to attain purity. Ānanda, it is just as when a fire has burned down to just one tongue of flame and someone comes and puts it on level clear ground or places it on a rock. What do you think, Ānanda: will that fire increase and flare up?

Venerable Ānanda replied, “It will not, World-honored One.” [The World-honored One said:]

In the same way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe another person’s mind, and knows that this person has accomplished unwholesome qualities and accomplished wholesome qual- ities. Later the Tathāgata again uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe this person’s mind, and finds that this person’s unwholesome qualities have ceased and his wholesome qualities have arisen. [Although]

this person’s unwholesome qualities have ceased and his wholesome qual ities have arisen, a remainder of his unwholesome roots has not been cut off, [yet] they certainly will be cut off in the future, and in this way this person gains in pure qualities. Ānanda, this is what is called the Tathāgata’s great knowledge of people’s faculties. This is how the Tathāgata correctly discerns the roots of all qualities. Again, Ānanda, the Tathāgata uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe another person’s mind, and sees that this person does not have even a small amount of black karma, not even amounting to a single hair. This person is definitely full of wholesome qualities, which give happiness and bring happy results, and will certainly lead to his being reborn in a good realm of existence and attaining a long life [there]. A person like this will certainly attain final nirvana in this very life. Ānanda, it is just as when burning coals have long gone out and become cold, yet someone feeds them with dry grass or lots of dead wood. What do you think, Ānanda: will those dead coals begin burning again? Venerable Ānanda replied, “They will not, World-honored One.” [The World-honored One said:] In the same way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe another person’s mind, and sees that this person does not have even a small amount of black karma, not even amounting to a single hair.

A person like this will certainly attain final nirvana in this very life. Ānanda, this is what is called the Tathāgata’s great knowledge of people’s faculties. This is how the Tathāgata correctly knows the roots of all qualities. Ānanda, of the three types of person I described earlier, the first gains in pure qualities, the second is of a nature to decline and regress, and the third, on the breaking up of the body at death, will certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell. Of the three types of person I described later, the first is of a nature to decline and regress, the second gains in pure qualities, and the third will attain final nirvana in this very life.^328

Ānanda, I have now explained to you the great knowledge of people’s faculties. What a teacher should do for his disciples out of great compas- sion, mercy, sympathy, and concern, seeking their benefit and welfare, seeking their safety and well-being—that I have now done. All of you should do your part. Go sit in meditation and contemplation in a secluded place, on a mountain, in a forest, at the base of a tree, in an empty and quiet place. Do not be negligent. Make diligent efforts, lest you regret it later. This is my instruction; this is my teaching. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
