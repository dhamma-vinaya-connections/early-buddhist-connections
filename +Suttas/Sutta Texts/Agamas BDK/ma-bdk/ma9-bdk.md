### 9. The Discourse on Seven Chariots

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, together with a great assembly of monks who were spending the rains retreat there. [At the same time] Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta was spending the rains retreat in the [Buddha’s] native region. Then, a number of monks who had concluded the rains retreat in the [Buddha’s] native region, the three months being over, having mended their robes, they put on their robes, took their bowls, and left the [Buddha’s] native region for Rājagaha. Traveling by stages, they reached Rājagaha, where they went to stay in the Bamboo Grove. Then those monks from the [Buddha’s] native region approached the Buddha, paid their respects by bowing down their heads, and sat to one side. The World-honored One asked them: “Monks, where have you come from, and in what place did you spend the rains retreat?” The monks from the [Buddha’s] native region replied: “World-honored One, we have come from the [World-honored One’s] native region, having spent the rains retreat there.” The World-honored One asked them: Among the monks living in [my] native region, which monk is praised by the other monks [thus]: Having few wishes and being contented himself, he speaks [to others] in praise of having few wishes and being contented; living in seclusion himself, he speaks in praise of living in seclusion; being energetic himself, he speaks in praise of being ener- getic; having right mindfulness himself, he speaks in praise of right mindfulness; having mental one-pointedness himself, he speaks in praise of mental one-pointedness; having wisdom himself, he speaks in praise of wisdom; having himself destroyed the taints, he speaks in praise of destroying the taints; having himself exhorted, inspired, and fully delighted [others], he speaks in praise of exhorting, inspiring, and fully delighting [others]. The monks from the [Buddha’s] native region replied: World-honored One, the monks living in [the World-honored One’s]

native region praise Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta [thus]: Having few wishes and being contented himself, he speaks [to others] in praise of having few wishes and being contented; living in seclusion himself, he speaks in praise of living in seclusion; being energetic himself, he speaks in praise of being energetic; having right mindfulness himself, he speaks in praise of right mindfulness; having mental one-pointedness himself, he speaks in praise of mental one-pointedness; having wisdom himself, he speaks in praise of wisdom; having himself destroyed the taints, he speaks in praise of destroying the taints; having himself exhorted, inspired, and fully delighted [others], he speaks in praise of exhorting, inspiring, and fully delighting [others]. At that time, Venerable Sāriputta was seated among the assembly. Then Venerable Sāriputta thought: The World-honored One has questioned those monks from [his] native region about this matter and the monks from [his] native region have given the greatest praise to Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta [thus]: Hav ing few wishes and being contented himself, he speaks [to others] in praise of having few wishes and being contented; living in seclusion himself, he speaks in praise of living in seclusion; being energetic him self, he speaks in praise of being energetic; having right mindfulness himself, he speaks in praise of right mindfulness; having mental one pointedness himself, he speaks in praise of mental one-pointedness; having wisdom himself, he speaks in praise of wisdom; having himself destroyed the taints, he speaks in praise of destroying the taints; having himself exhorted, inspired, and fully delighted [others], he speaks in praise of exhorting, inspiring, and fully delighting [others]. Venerable Sāriputta thought further: “When I get to meet Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, I will ask him a few things. He would probably be com petent in understanding [and replying to] my questions.” At that time the World-honored One, who had concluded the rains retreat at Rājagaha, the three months being over, having mended his robes, put on his robes and took his bowl, left Rājagaha for Sāvatthī. Traveling by stages, he reached Sāvatthī, where he went to stay in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

[Meanwhile,] after staying for a few days at Rājagaha, Venerable Sāriputta and the monks [who had come] from the [Buddha’s] native region put on their robes, took their bowls, and left Rājagaha for Sāvatthī. Traveling by stages, they reached Sāvatthī, where they went to stay in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, who had concluded the rains retreat in the [Buddha’s] native region, the three months being over, having mended his robes, put on his robes, took his bowl, and left the [Buddha’s] native region for Sāvatthī. Traveling by stages, he reached Sāvatthī, where he went to stay in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta approached the Buddha and paid his respects by bowing down his head. Then he spread his sitting mat [at some distance] in front of the Buddha and sat down cross-legged. Then Venerable Sāriputta asked some other monks: “Venerable friends, is that Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta?” The monks answered Venerable Sāriputta: “That is so. The venerable one who is seated in front of the Tathāgata, with fair skin and a prominent nose resembling a parrot’s beak, that is he.” Then Venerable Sāriputta, having taken note of Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta’s facial appearance, retained a clear memory of it. When the night was over, at dawn, Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta put on his robes, took his bowl, and entered Sāvatthī to beg for food. After having taken his midday meal, he put away his robes and bowl, washed his hands and feet, put his sitting mat over his shoulder, and went to a place for walking meditation in the Blind Men’s Grove. Venerable Sāriputta also, when the night was over, at dawn, put on his robes, took his bowl and entered Sāvatthī to beg for food. After having taken his midday meal, he put away his robes and bowl, washed his hands and feet, put his sitting mat over his shoulder, and went to a place for walking meditation in the Blind Men’s Grove. Then, when Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta had reached Blind Men’s Grove, he spread his sitting mat beneath a tree and sat down cross-legged. Venerable Sāriputta also, on reaching Blind Men’s Grove, spread his sitting mat beneath a tree not far from Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, and sat down cross- legged.

In the late afternoon, after rising from sitting in meditation, Venerable Sāriputta approached Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, exchanged friendly greetings, and, sitting down to one side, asked Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta: “Is the venerable one practicing the holy life under the renunciant Gotama?”^65 [Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta] replied: “That is so.” [Sāriputta asked]: “How is it, venerable friend, are you practicing the holy life under the renunciant Gotama for the sake of purification of virtue?” [Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta] replied: “Not so.” [Sāriputta asked further]: Are you practicing the holy life under the renunciant Gotama for the sake of purification of mind... , for the sake of purification of view... , for the sake of purification [from] the hindrance of doubt... , for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path... , for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of the way... , for the sake of purification by knowledge of the way to abandoning? [To each question Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta] replied: “Not so.” [Sāriputta] asked further: Just before, I asked the venerable one if he is practicing the holy life under the renunciant Gotama, and he said that this is so. Now I have asked the venerable one if he is practicing the holy life under the renun ciant Gotama for the sake of purification of virtue, and he has said “Not so.” [I have also asked the venerable one if] he is practicing the holy life under the renunciant Gotama for the sake of purification of mind... , for the sake of purification of view... , for the sake of purification [from] the hindrance of doubt... , for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path... , for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of the way... , for the sake of purification by knowledge of the way to abandoning; and [to each question] he has said, “Not so.” In that case, for the sake of what are you practicing the holy life under the renunciant Gotama? [Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta] replied: “Venerable friend, for the sake of nirvana without remainder.”

[Sāriputta] asked further: “How is it, then, venerable friend? Is it for the sake of purification of virtue that the renunciant Gotama designates nirvana without remainder?” [Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta] replied: “Not so.” [Sāriputta asked further]: Is it for the sake of purification of mind... , for the sake of purification of view... ,for the sake of purification [from] the hindrance of doubt... ,for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path... , for the sake of purifi- cation by knowledge and vision of the way... , for the sake of purifi- cation by knowledge of the way to abandoning that the renunciant Gotama designates nirvana without remainder? [And to each question Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta] replied: “Not so.” [Sāriputta] asked again: Just now, I asked the venerable one if it is for the sake of purification of virtue that the renunciant Gotama designates nirvana without remain- der, and he replied “Not so.” [And I asked] is it for the sake of purifi- cation of mind... , for the sake of purification of view... , for the sake of purification [from] the hindrance of doubt... , for the sake of purifi- cation by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path... , for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of the way [of practice]... , for the sake of purification by knowledge of the way to abandoning, that the renunciant Gotama designates nirvana without remainder; and [to each question] the venerable one has replied “Not so.” What is the meaning of what the venerable one has said? How can one come to understand it? [Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta] replied: Venerable friend, if the World-honored One, the renunciant Gotama, were to designate nirvana without remainder for the sake of purification of virtue, then that would be to praise what is with a remainder [of clinging] as being without a remainder [of clinging]. If the World-hon- ored One, the renunciant Gotama, were to designate nirvana without

remainder for the sake of purification of mind... , for the sake of purifi cation of view... , for the sake of purification [from] the hindrance of doubt... , for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path... , for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of the way... , for the sake of purification by knowledge of the way to abandoning, then that would be to praise what is with a remainder [of clinging] as being without a remainder [of clinging]. [On the other hand,] venerable friend, if the World-honored One were to designate nirvana without remainder apart from these things, then a worldling should also [be able to attain] nirvana without remain der, because a worldling is also apart from these things. Rather, venerable friend, [it is] through purification of virtue, [that] one attains purification of mind; through purification of mind, one attains purification of view; through purification of view, one attains purification [from] the hindrance of doubt; through purification [from] the hindrance of doubt, one attains purification by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path; through purifi cation by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path, one attains purification by knowledge and vision of the way; through purification by knowledge and vision of the way, one attains purification by knowledge of the way to abandoning; through purifi cation by knowledge of the way of abandoning, the World-honored One, the renunciant Gotama, designates nirvana without remainder. Venerable friend, listen further. Once King Pasenadi of Kosala was in Sāvatthī and had some matter [to attend to] in Sāketa. He thought, “Using what expedient means can I reach Sāketa from Sāvatthī in a single day’s journey?” He further thought, “I shall now have seven chariots arranged [along the road] from Sāvatthī to Sāketa.” So, he had seven chariots arranged [along the road] from Sāvatthī to Sāketa. Having arranged the seven chariots, he set out from Sāvatthī in the first chariot. Riding in the first chariot, he reached the second chariot; leaving behind the first chariot and riding in the second^66 chariot, he reached the third chariot; leaving behind the second chariot and riding in the third chariot, he reached the fourth chariot; leaving behind the

third chariot and riding in the fourth chariot, he reached the fifth chariot; leaving behind the fourth chariot and riding in the fifth chariot, he reached the sixth chariot; leaving behind the fifth chariot and riding in the sixth chariot, he reached the seventh chariot; leaving behind the sixth chariot and riding in the seventh chariot, he reached Sāketa within a single day. When the king had dealt with the matter in Sāketa, the great courtiers gathered and surrounded the king, who was seated in the main hall, and respectfully said: “Great King, did you come in a single day from Sāvatthī to Sāketa?” The king replied: “That is so.” [The courtiers asked]: “Did the Great King come in a single day from Sāvatthī to Sāketa by riding in the first chariot?” The king replied: “Not so.” [The courtiers asked further]: “Did you come from Sāvatthī to Sāketa by riding in the second chariot... , by riding in the third chariot.

.. , (and so on up to) by riding in the seventh chariot?” [And to each question] the king replied: “Not so.” What do you say, venerable friend: in what way should King Pase- nadi of Kosala answer on being asked this by the gathering of courtiers?

[Sāriputta answered:]

The king [should] answer the gathering of courtiers: “I was in Sāvatthī and I had some matter [to attend to] in Sāketa. Then I thought, ‘Using what expedient means can I reach Sāketa from Sāvatthī in a single day’s journey?’ I further thought, ‘I shall now have seven chariots arranged [along the road] from Sāvatthī to Sāketa.’ So, I had seven chariots arranged [along the road] from Sāvatthī to Sāketa. Having arranged the seven chariots, I set out from Sāvatthī in the first chariot. Riding in the first chariot, I reached the second chariot; leaving behind the first chariot and riding in the second chariot, I reached the third chariot; leaving behind the second chariot and riding in the third chariot, I reached the fourth chariot; leaving behind the third chariot and riding in the fourth chariot, I reached the fifth chariot; leaving behind the fourth chariot and riding in the fifth chariot, I reached the sixth chariot;

leaving behind the fifth chariot and riding in the sixth chariot, I reached the seventh chariot; leaving behind the sixth chariot and riding in the seventh chariot, I reached Sāketa within a single day.” Thus, venerable friend, [should] King Pasenadi of Kosala reply to the questions put in this way by the gathering of courtiers. [Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta said:] In the same way, venerable friend, through purification of virtue, one attains purification of mind; through purification of mind, one attains purification of view; through purification of view, one attains purification [from] the hindrance of doubt; through purification [from] the hindrance of doubt, one attains purification by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path; through purification by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path, one attains purification by knowledge and vision of the way; through purification by knowledge and vision of the way, one attains purification by knowl- edge of the way to abandoning; through purification by knowledge of the way to abandoning, the World-honored One designates nirvana without remainder. Then Venerable Sāriputta asked Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta: “What is the venerable one’s name? How do his companions in the holy life call the venerable one?” Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta replied: “Venerable friend, I am called Puṇṇa and my mother’s name is Mantāṇī;^67 therefore, my companions in the holy life call me Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta.” Venerable Sāriputta expressed his praise: Excellent, excellent, Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta! As befits a disciple of the Tathāgata, [the venerable one] has explained wisely, with intel- ligence and determination, calm and without wavering, being an accom- plished trainer who has achieved great eloquence, has attained the ban- ner of the deathless, and dwells having himself realized the element of deathlessness—for the venerable one has been able, on being ques- tioned, to respond fully on a profound issue. Venerable Puṇṇa Man- tāṇiputta’s companions in the holy life will obtain great benefit if they

get to meet Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, to visit and pay homage to him on a suitable occasion. Now I too have obtained great benefit on visiting and paying homage to him on [this] suitable occasion. Great benefit would be obtained by his companions in the holy life if they were to roll up their robes and put them on their heads to carry Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta [around on their heads]. Now I too have obtained great benefit on visiting and paying homage to him on [this] suitable occasion. Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta asked Venerable Sāriputta: “What is the venerable one’s name? How do his companions in the holy life call the ven- erable one?” Venerable Sāriputta replied: “Venerable friend, my name is Upatissa and my mother’s name is Sārī; therefore my companions in the holy life call me Sāriputta.” Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta expressed his praise: Today, unwittingly, I have discussed with a disciple of the World-hon- ored One, unwittingly I have discussed with the second most respected one, unwittingly I have discussed with the general of the Dharma, unwittingly I have discussed with the disciple who keeps the wheel of Dharma turning. If I had known that this was Venerable Sāriputta, I would not have been able to answer with even one sentence, let alone discuss so deeply. Excellent, excellent, Venerable Sāriputta! As befits a disciple of the Tathāgata, [the venerable one] has explained wisely, with intelligence and determination, calm and without wavering, being an accomplished trainer who has achieved great eloquence, has attained the banner of the deathless, and dwells having himself realized the ele- ment of deathlessness—for the venerable one has posed very profound questions. Venerable Sāriputta’s companions in the holy life will obtain great benefit if they get to meet Venerable Sāriputta, to visit and pay homage to him on a suitable occasion. Now I too have obtained great benefit on visiting and paying homage to him on this suitable occasion. Great benefit would be obtained by his companions in the holy life if they were to roll up their robes and put them on their heads to carry Venerable Sāriputta [around on their heads]. Now I too have obtained

great benefit on visiting and paying homage to him on [this] suitable occasion. In this way these two venerable ones praised each other. Having com- mended each other, they were delighted and remembered [the exchange] well. Each rose from his seat and returned to his dwelling place.
