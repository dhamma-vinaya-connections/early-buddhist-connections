### 198. The Discourse on the Stages of Taming

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Rājagaha, staying in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.

At that time the novice Aciravata was also dwelling at Rājagaha, staying in a meditation hut in the forest. At that time Prince Jīvasena, who was roaming about in the afternoon, came to where the novice Aciravata was staying. Having exchanged greetings with him, he stepped back, sat to one side, and said, “Venerable Aciravata, I would like to ask a question. Am I permitted to ask it?” The novice Aciravata replied, “Good prince, ask what you wish to ask. Having heard it, I will consider it.” The prince asked, “Aciravata, is it true that in this Dharma and discipline a monk who is not negligent and who practices diligently attains unification of mind?” The novice answered, “Good prince, it is true that in this Dharma and dis- cipline a monk who is not negligent and who practices diligently attains uni- fication of mind.” The prince asked further: Venerable Aciravata, would you tell me in full, according to what you have heard and according to what you have learned through recitation, how in this Dharma and discipline a monk who is not negligent and who practices diligently attains unification of mind? The novice answered: Good prince, I am not able to tell you in full, according to the Dharma as I have heard it and according to what I have learned through recitation, how in this Dharma and discipline a monk who is not negligent and who practices diligently attains unification of mind. Good prince, if I were to tell the good prince, according to the Dharma as I have heard it and accord- ing to what I have learned through recitation, how in this Dharma and discipline a monk who is not negligent and who practices diligently attains unification of mind, the good prince might not understand; and that would be wearisome for me. The prince said to the novice: Venerable Aciravata, you are not being ambushed by anyone. With what reason in mind are you retreating? Venerable Aciravata, tell me, according

to the Dharma as you have heard it and according to what you have learned through recitation, how in this Dharma and discipline a monk who is not negligent and who practices diligently attains unification of mind. If I understand, then that is good. If I do not understand, then I will not ask you any more questions about anything. Then the novice Aciravata told Prince Jīvasena, according to the Dharma as he had heard it and according to what he had learned through recitation, how in this Dharma and discipline a monk who is not negligent and who practices diligently attains unification of mind. Then Prince Jīvasena said: Venerable Aciravata, it is impossible that in this Dharma and discipline a monk who is not negligent and who practices diligently should attain unification of mind. Having declared it impossible, he promptly got up from his seat and left without bidding farewell. Not long after Prince Jīvasena had left, the novice Aciravata approached the Buddha. Having paid homage with his head [at the Buddha’s feet], he stepped back, sat to one side, and told the Buddha the whole conversation with Prince Jīvasena. Having heard it, the World-honored one said to the novice: Aciravata, let it be! How could Prince Jīvasena grasp [what you were talking about]? He engages in sensual pleasures, he is attached to sensual pleasures, consumed by craving for sensual pleasures, subject to the fever of sensual pleasures. As to the stage [of meditation attained by] abandoning sensual pleasures, by abandoning the craving for sensual pleasures, by abandoning the fever of sensual pleasures, by knowledge of dispassion, by vision of dispassion, by realization of dispassion, that Prince Jīvasena should [get to] know and see this stage, that is not possible. Why is that? Aciravata, it is [because] Prince Jīvasena constantly engages in sensual pleasures. Aciravata, it is just as with taming four [kinds of beings]; taming ele- phants, taming horses, taming oxen, and taming people. In each case two [kinds of beings] to be tamed resist taming and two [kinds of beings] to be tamed accept taming. Aciravata, what do you think? That these two

[kinds of beings] to be tamed which resist taming, which have never been tamed and, never having been tamed, are at the stage of being untamed— that they should experience the tamed state, that is not possible. That these two [kinds of beings] to be tamed which accept taming, which have been well-tamed and, having been well-tamed, have [gone beyond] the stage of being untamed^146 —that they should experience the tamed state, that is certainly possible. So, Aciravata, let it be! How could Prince Jīvasena get [what you were talking about]? He engages in sensual pleasures, he is attached to sensual pleasures, consumed by craving for sensual pleasures, subject to the fever of sensual pleasures. As to the stage [of meditation attained by] abandoning sensual pleasures, by abandoning the craving for sensual pleasures, by aban doning the fever of sensual pleasures, by knowledge of dispassion, by vision of dispassion, by realization of dispassion—that the prince should [get to] know or see this stage, that is not possible. Why is that? Aciravata, it is [because] Prince Jīvasena constantly engages in sensual pleasures. Aciravata, it is just as if there were a great rocky mountain not far from a village, which is without cavities, without crevices, solid, without hollows, firm and immovable, being altogether a single [mass]. Suppose that two men are wanting to see [the view]. One of the men quickly climbs up the mountain; the second man stays at the bottom of the mountain. The man on top of the rocky mountain sees that on the [other] side of the rocky mountain there is beautiful level ground, with scenic gardens, woodland groves, clear springs, flower ponds, and long flowing rivers. Having seen this, the man on top of the mountain says to the man at the bottom of the mountain, “Did you [ever] see that on the [other] side of the mountain there is beautiful level ground, with scenic gardens, woodland groves, clear springs, flower ponds, and long flowing rivers?” The man standing at the bottom of the mountain replies, “From what I see of the mountain, that on its [other] side there should be beautiful level ground, with scenic gardens, woodland groves, clear springs, flower ponds, and long flowing rivers, that is not possible.” Then the man on top of the rocky mountain quickly comes down. He takes hold of the man at the bottom of the mountain and quickly leads him up. Having reached the top of the rocky mountain, he asks him, “Do you

[now] see that on the [other] side of the mountain there is beautiful level ground, with scenic gardens, woodland groves, clear springs, flower ponds, and long flowing rivers?” The other man replies, “Only now do I see it.” Then [the first man] again asks the other man, “At first you said that to see this was not possible, but now you say you see it. What is the reason for this?” The other man replies, “At first my [view] was obstructed by the mountain, so I could not see it.” So, Aciravata, let it be! How could Prince Jīvasena get [what you were talking about]? He engages in sensual pleasures, he is attached to sensual pleasures, consumed by craving for sensual pleasures, subject to the fever of sensual pleasures. As to the stage [of meditation attained by] abandoning sensual pleasures, by abandoning the craving for sensual pleasures, by abandoning the fever of sensual pleasures, by knowledge of dispassion, by vision of dispassion, by realization of dispassion, that the prince should [get to] know this, to see this, that is not possible.^147 Aciravata, long ago there was a head-anointed warrior king who had an elephant catcher. The king said to him: “Elephant catcher, catch a forest elephant for me and bring him here. When you have caught him, tell me.” Then, having received the king’s instructions, the elephant catcher mounted the royal elephant and went into the forest. The elephant catcher saw a large forest elephant in the forest. Having seen him, he caught and bound him, attaching him to the royal elephant’s neck. Then the royal elephant led the forest elephant out into the open. The elephant catcher returned to the head-anointed warrior king and said, “Your Majesty, the forest elephant has been caught; he is bound and out in the open. May Your Majesty do as he pleases!” Hearing this, the head-anointed warrior king said [to his skilled elephant tamer], “Skilled elephant tamer, now quickly tame this forest elephant. Make him submit so that he becomes a well-tamed elephant. When he is well-tamed, come back and tell me.” Having received the king’s instructions, the skilled elephant tamer took hold of a large post, placed it on his right shoulder, and went to where the forest elephant was. He planted the post in the ground and bound the forest elephant to it by the neck. He did this to control [the elephant’s] intentions of enjoying the forest, to remove its thoughts of desire for the forest, detain

him from the forest and weary him of it, so that he would enjoy villages and towns, and develop a liking for human beings. The skilled elephant tamer began by providing [the forest elephant] with fodder and drink. Aciravata, once that forest elephant had accepted the first fodder and drink from the elephant tamer, the skilled elephant tamer thought, “Now this forest elephant will certainly survive. Why is that? [It is because] this forest elephant has for the first time accepted fodder and drink.” Once that forest elephant had accepted the first fodder and drink from the elephant tamer, the skilled elephant tamer addressed him with soft, agreeable words, “Lie down, get up! Go, come back! Take up, put down! Bend, stretch!” That forest elephant, on being addressed by the elephant tamer with soft, agreeable words, lay down and got up, went and came back, took up and put down, bent and stretched. In this way the forest ele phant followed the instructions of the elephant tamer. Aciravata, once that forest elephant had obeyed the instructions of the elephant tamer, the skilled elephant tamer bound his two front feet, his [two] back feet, his two hind parts, his two flanks, his tail, his forehead, his ears, his tusks, and also his trunk. He got a man holding a goad to mount [the elephant’s] head, and many [other] men to stand in front of it holding swords, shields, spears, lances, halberds, hatchets, and axes. Hold ing a sharp halberd in his hand, the skilled elephant tamer stood in front of the forest elephant and said, “I will now train you in imperturbability. I will train you not to move.” While being trained in imperturbability by the elephant tamer, that forest elephant did not lift his front feet and did not move his back feet. His two hind parts, his two flanks, his tail, his forehead, his ears, his tusks, and his trunk all did not move. In this way the forest elephant submitted to the elephant tamer by remaining imperturbable. Aciravata, when that forest elephant submitted to the elephant tamer by remaining imperturbable, at that time he was putting up with swords, shields, spears, lances, halberds, hatchets, and axes, and with the sound of loud shouting. If there was any yelling, blowing of conchs, beating of drums, or striking of bells, he was capable of enduring it all. Once that forest elephant was capable of enduring that, at that time he was tamed, well-tamed; he had achieved the higher taming, achieved the unsurpassable

taming. [Being also endowed with] superior swiftness, unsurpassable swiftness, he was fit to be ridden by a king, to receive fodder from a king’s granary, and to be called a royal elephant. It is the same, Aciravata, at the time when there appears in the world a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened, accomplished in knowl- edge and conduct, a well-gone one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassable person, leader on the path of Dharma, teacher of _deva_ s and human beings, called a buddha, an exalted one. He has known and realized for himself this world [with its] _deva_ s and _māra_ s, [with its] Brahmās, [with its] renun- ciants and brahmins, from human beings to _deva_ s, and he dwells having himself achieved realization. He teaches the Dharma, which is sublime in the beginning, sublime in the middle, and sublime in the end, with its meaning and phrasing, endowed with purity, and he reveals the holy life. That Dharma taught by him is heard by a householder’s son. On hearing it, the householder’s son gains faith in the Dharma taught by the Tathāgata. Having gained faith, he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on monastic robes and out of faith leaves home and becomes homeless to train in the path. Aciravata, at that time the noble disciple comes out into the open, just as the king’s forest elephant [came out of the forest]. Just as a forest ele- phant has lust, desire, delight, and attachment, namely for staying in the forest, Aciravata, in the same way _deva_ s and human beings have desire, lust, delight, and attachment, namely for the five strands of sensual pleasure, for visible forms, sounds, odors, tastes, and tangibles. The Tathāgata begins by taming that monk, “You should maintain purity of body and livelihood, maintain purity of speech... and of mind and livelihood.” When the noble disciple maintains purity of body and livelihood, maintains purity of speech... and of mind and livelihood, the Tathāgata tames the monk further,^148 “You should contemplate the body as a body internally... up to... contemplate feelings, mental states, and dharmas as dharmas.” When the noble disciple contemplates the body as a body internally... up to... contemplates feelings, mental states, and dharmas as dharmas, then the four establishments of mindfulness are present in the mind of the noble disciple. They bind his mind, control intentions of delighting in the household [life], and remove thoughts of desire for the household [life],

detain him from the household [life] and weary him of it. They cause him to delight in the true Dharma and to develop noble morality. Aciravata, it is just as the elephant tamer, having received the order from the head-anointed warrior king, took hold of a large post, placed it on his right shoulder, went to where the forest elephant was, planted the post in the ground, and bound the forest elephant to it by the neck. This controlled [the elephant’s] intentions of delighting in the forest and removed his thoughts of desire for the forest, detained him from the forest and wea ried him of it. It caused him to delight in villages and towns and to develop a liking for human beings. In the same way, Aciravata, the four establishings of mindfulness are present in the mind of the noble disciple. They bind his mind, control his intentions of delighting in the household [life], and remove thoughts of desire for the household [life], detain him from the household [life] and weary him of it. They cause him to delight in the true Dharma, and to develop noble morality. When the noble disciple contemplates the body as a body internally... up to... contemplates feelings, mental states, and dharmas as dharmas, then the Tathāgata tames the monk further, “You should contemplate the body as a body internally, without thinking thoughts related to sensual pleasures... up to... contemplate feelings, mental states, dharmas as dharmas, without thinking thoughts related to what is not Dharma.” When the noble disciple contemplates the body as a body internally without thinking thoughts related to sensual pleasures... up to... con templates feelings, mental states, dharmas as dharmas, without thinking thoughts related to what is not Dharma, then in this way the noble disciple is following the instructions of the Tathāgata. Aciravata, it is just as the forest elephant which, on being addressed by the elephant tamer with soft and agreeable words, lay down and got up, went and came back, took up and put down, bent and stretched, in this way the forest elephant followed the instructions of the elephant tamer.^149 In the same way, Aciravata, when the noble disciple contemplates the body as a body internally, without thinking thoughts related to sensual pleas ures... up to... contemplates feelings, mental states, dharmas as dharmas,

without thinking thoughts related to what is not Dharma, then in this way the noble disciple is following the instructions of the Tathāgata. When the noble disciple follows the instructions of the Tathāgata, the Tathāgata further tames the monk, “You should dwell secluded from sen- sual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states... up to... attain and dwell having attained the fourth absorption.”^150 When the noble disciple dwells secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states... up to... attains and dwells having attained the fourth absorption, then in this way the noble disciple has fol- lowed the Tathāgata and become established in imperturbability. Aciravata, it is just as when, through being instructed in imperturbability by the elephant tamer, the forest elephant did not lift his front feet, did not move his back feet, his two hind parts, his two flanks, his tail, his forehead, his ears, his tusks, and also his trunk, then in this way the forest elephant was following the elephant tamer’s instructions on imperturbability.^151 In the same way, Aciravata, when the noble disciple dwells secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states... up to... attains and dwells having achieved the fourth absorption, then in this way the noble disciple has followed the Tathāgata and become estab- lished in imperturbability. When, by following the Tathāgata, the noble disciple has become estab- lished in imperturbability, at that time he is capable of enduring affliction by hunger and thirst, cold and heat, mosquitoes and gadflies, flies and fleas, wind and sun. He is also capable of enduring abusive words and being beaten with sticks. Any diseases of the body causing the utmost pain, such as to make him wish to end his life, all of these unpleasant afflictions he is able to endure. Aciravata, it is just as the forest elephant, when he submitted to the elephant tamer and remained imperturbable, put up with swords, shields, spears, lances, halberds, hatchets, and axes, and the sound of loud shouting. He was capable of enduring any yelling, blowing of conchs, beating of drums, and striking of bells. All of that he was able to endure.^152 In the same way, Aciravata, when by following the Tathāgata, the noble disciple has become established in imperturbability, at that time he is

capable of enduring affliction by hunger and thirst, cold and heat, mos quitoes and gadflies, flies and fleas, wind and sun. He is also capable of enduring abusive words and being beaten with sticks. Any diseases of the body causing the utmost pain, such as to make him wish to end his life, all of these unpleasant afflictions he is able to endure. Aciravata, when the noble disciple, through following the Tathāgata, is able to put up [with all of this], at that time he is tamed, well-tamed, has reached the higher taming, the supreme taming; he has reached the higher peace, the supreme peace; he has discarded all crookedness, fear, stupidity, and deceitfulness; he has become pure, has settled the dust, become free of dirt, free of impurity; he is worthy of praise, worthy of being invited, worthy of reverence, worthy of respect, truly worthy of offerings, an excel lent field of merit for all deva s and human beings.^153 Aciravata, it is just as that forest elephant, when he had become capable of enduring all, at that time he was tamed, well-tamed, had achieved the higher taming, had achieved the unsurpassable taming, [was endowed with] superior swiftness, unsurpassable swiftness, was fit to be ridden by a king, to receive fodder from a king’s granary, and to be called a royal elephant. In the same way, Aciravata, when the noble disciple, through following the Tathāgata, is able to put up [with all of this], at that time he is tamed, well-tamed, has achieved the higher taming, the supreme taming; has attained the higher peace, the supreme peace; he has discarded all crooked ness, fear, stupidity, and deceitfulness; he has become pure, has settled the dust, become free of dirt, free of impurity; he is worthy of praise, worthy of being invited, worthy of reverence, worthy of respect, truly worthy of offerings, an excellent field of merit for all deva s and human beings. Aciravata, a young forest elephant who dies untamed is reckoned to have “died untamed,” a middle-aged elephant... an old elephant who dies untamed is reckoned to have “died untamed.” Aciravata, a young noble disciple who dies untamed is reckoned to have “died untamed,” a middle-aged noble disciple... an old noble disciple who dies untamed is reckoned to have “died untamed.”^154 Aciravata, a young forest elephant who dies well-tamed is reckoned to have “died well-tamed,” a middle-aged elephant... an old elephant

who dies well-tamed is reckoned to have “died well-tamed.” Aciravata, a young noble disciple who dies well-tamed is reckoned to have “died well-tamed,” a middle-aged noble disciple... an old noble disciple who dies well-tamed is reckoned to have “died well-tamed.” Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the novice Aciravata and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
