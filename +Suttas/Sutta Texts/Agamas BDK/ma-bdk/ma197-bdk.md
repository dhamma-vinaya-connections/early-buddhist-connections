### 197. The Discourse to Upāli

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Campa, on the bank of the river Ganges.

At that time, in the afternoon, the venerable Upāli rose from sitting in meditation and approached the Buddha. Having paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, he stepped back, sat to one side, and said: World-honored One, if a completely assembled sangha of monks perform a transaction that is different [from what is appropriate to the case] and declare a transaction that is different [from what is appropriate to the case], then is this a transaction in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction in accordance with the discipline? The World-honored One replied, “It is not, Upāli.” The venerable Upāli asked further: World-honored One, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should do it by [the procedure for settlement of litigation called] encounter but instead do it by [loss of] memory, or if they should do it by [loss of] mem ory but instead do it by encounter, then is this a transaction in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction in accordance with the discipline? The World-honored One replied, “It is not, Upāli.” The venerable Upāli asked further: World-honored One, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should do it by [loss of] memory but instead do it by non-insanity, or if they should do it by non-insanity but instead do it by [loss of] memory, then is this a transaction in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction in accor dance with the discipline? The World-honored One replied, “It is not, Upāli.” The venerable Upāli asked further: World-honored One, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should do it by non-insanity but instead do it by self-confession, or if they should do it by self-confession but instead do it by non-insanity, then is this a transaction in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction in accordance with the discipline? The World-honored One replied, “It is not, Upāli.” The venerable Upāli asked further:

World-honored One, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should do it by self-confession but instead do it by [pronouncement of] , or if they should do it by [pronouncement of] but instead do it by self-confession, then is this a transaction in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction in accordance with the discipline?

The World-honored One replied, “It is not, Upāli.” The venerable Upāli asked further:

World-honored One, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should do it by [pronouncement of] but instead reprove, or if they should reprove but instead do it by [pronouncement of] , then is this a transaction in accordance with the Dharma, a trans- action in accordance with the discipline?

The World-honored One replied, “It is not, Upāli.” The venerable Upāli asked further:

World-honored One, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should reprove but instead demote, or if they should demote but instead reprove, then is this a transaction in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction in accordance with the discipline?

The World-honored One replied, “It is not, Upāli.” The venerable Upāli asked further:

World-honored One, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should demote but instead promote, or if they should promote but instead demote, then is this a transaction in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction in accordance with the discipline?

The World-honored One replied, “It is not, Upāli.” The venerable Upāli asked further:

World-honored One, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should promote but instead expel, or if they should expel but instead promote, then is this a transaction in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction in accordance with the discipline?

The World-honored One replied, “It is not, Upāli.” The venerable Upāli asked further: “World-honored One, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should expel but instead remind, or if they should remind but instead expel, then is this a transaction in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction in accordance with the discipline? The World-honored One replied, “It is not, Upāli.” The venerable Upāli asked further: World-honored One, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should remind but instead correct at the root, or if they should correct at the root but instead remind, then is this a transaction in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction in accordance with the discipline? The World-honored One replied, “It is not, Upāli.” The venerable Upāli asked further: World-honored One, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should correct at the root but instead send away, or if they should send away but instead correct at the root, then is this a transaction in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction in accordance with the discipline? The World-honored One replied, “It is not, Upāli.” The venerable Upāli asked further: World-honored One, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should send away but instead prescribe penance, or if they should prescribe penance but instead send away, then is this a transaction in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction in accordance with the discipline? The World-honored One replied, “It is not, Upāli.” The venerable Upāli asked further: World-honored One, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should prescribe penance but instead correct, or if they should correct but instead prescribe penance, then is this a transaction in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction in accordance with the discipline? The World-honored One replied:

It is not, Upāli. Upāli, if a completely assembled sangha of monks perform a transaction that is different [from what is appropriate to the case] and declare a transaction that is different [from what is appropriate to the case], then this is a transaction that is not in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction that is not in accordance with the discipline; and that sangha is at fault. Upāli, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should do it by encounter but instead do it by [loss of] memory, or if they should do it by [loss of] memory but instead do it by encounter, then this is a transaction that is not in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction that is not in accordance with the discipline; and that sangha too is at fault. Upāli, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should do it by [loss of] memory but instead do it by non-insanity, or if they should do it by non-insanity but instead do it by [loss of] memory, then this is a transaction that is not in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction that is not in accordance with the discipline; and that sangha too is at fault. Upāli, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should do it by non- insanity but instead do it by self-confession, or if they should do it by self-confession but instead do it by non-insanity, then this is a transaction that is not in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction that is not in accordance with the discipline; and that sangha too is at fault. Upāli, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should do it by self- confession but instead do it by [pronouncement of] , or if they should do it by [pronouncement of] but instead do it by self-confession, then this is a transaction that is not in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction that is not in accordance with the discipline; and that sangha too is at fault. Upāli, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should do it by [pro- nouncement of] but instead reprove, or if they should reprove but instead do it by [pronouncement of] , then this is a transaction that is not in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction that is not in accordance with the discipline; and that sangha too is at fault. Upāli, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should reprove but instead demote, or if they should demote but instead reprove, then this is a transaction that is not in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction that is not in accordance with the discipline; and that sangha too is at fault.

Upāli, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should demote but instead promote, or if they should promote but instead demote, then this is a transaction that is not in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction that is not in accordance with the discipline; and that sangha too is at fault. Upāli, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should promote but instead expel, or if they should expel but instead promote, then this is a trans action that is not in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction that is not in accordance with the discipline; and that sangha too is at fault. Upāli, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should expel but instead remind, or if they should remind but instead expel, then this is a transaction that is not in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction that is not in accor dance with the discipline; and that sangha too is at fault. Upāli, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should remind but instead correct at the root, or if they should correct at the root but instead remind, then this is a transaction that is not in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction that is not in accordance with the discipline; and that sangha too is at fault. Upāli, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should correct at the root but instead send away, or if they should send away but instead correct at the root, then this is a transaction that is not in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction that is not in accordance with the discipline; and that sangha too is at fault. Upāli, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should send away but instead prescribe penance, or if they should prescribe penance but instead send away, then this is a transaction that is not in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction that is not in accordance with the discipline; and that sangha too is at fault. Upāli, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should prescribe penance but instead correct, or if they should correct but instead prescribe penance, then this is a transaction that is not in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction that is not in accordance with the discipline; and that sangha too is at fault. Upāli, if a completely assembled sangha of monks perform a transaction that is appropriate [to the case] and then declare this transaction, then this

is a transaction in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction in accordance with the discipline; and that sangha is not at fault. Upāli, if a completely assembled sangha of monks should do it by encounter and then do it by encounter... should do it by [loss of] memory and then do it by [loss of] memory... should do it by non-insanity and then do it by non-insanity... should do it by self-confession and then do it by self-confession... should do it by [pronouncement of] and then do it by [pronouncement of] ... should reprove and then reprove... should demote and then demote... should promote and then promote... should expel and then expel... should remind and then remind... should correct at the root and then correct at the root... should send away and then send away... should prescribe penance and then prescribe penance... should correct and then correct, then this is a transaction in accordance with the Dharma, a transaction in accordance with the discipline; and that sangha is not at fault. Upāli, you should train in doing the transaction that is appropriate to the case and then declare this transaction. Do by encounter what should be done by encounter. Do by [loss of] memory what should be done by [loss of] memory. Do by non-insanity what should be done by non-insanity. Do by self-confession what should be done by self-confession. Do by [pronouncement of] what should be done by [pronounce- ment of] . Reprove who should be reproved. Demote who should be demoted. Promote who should be promoted. Expel who should be expelled. Remind who should be reminded. Discipline from the outset who should be disciplined from the outset. Correct at the root who should be corrected at the root. Send away who should be sent away. Prescribe penance for who should be prescribed penance. Discipline who should be disciplined. Upāli, you should train in this way. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the venerable Upāli and the [other] monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
