### 11. The Discourse with the Parable [of the Ounce] of Salt

Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One said to the monks: [If one were to say]: “According to the actions a person does, he will experience the [exactly corresponding] result of those actions,” then in that case there could be no practice of the holy life and no attainment of the end of suffering. If [however,] one says: “According to the actions a person does, he will experience the result of those actions,”^71 then in that case there can be the practice of the holy life and attainment of the end of suffering. Why so? Consider the case of a person who has done an unwhole- some action and must experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result. Why must a person who has done an unwholesome action experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result? This is the case when a person has not cultivated the body, has not cultivated virtue, has not cultivated the mind, has not cultivated wisdom, and his life span is very short. This is the case of a person who, having done unwholesome actions, must experience suffering as their fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result. It is just as if a person were to drop an ounce of salt into a small amount of water, intending to make the water salty and undrinkable. What do you think? Could this ounce of salt make that small amount of water salty and undrinkable?” [The monks] replied:

Yes indeed, World-honored One. And why so? Because there is much salt but little water, therefore the salt can make the water salty and undrinkable. [The Buddha continued:] It is the same with a person who has done an unwholesome action and must experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result. Why must a person who has done an unwholesome action expe rience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result? This is the case when a person has not cultivated the body, has not cultivated virtue, has not cultivated the mind, has not cultivated wisdom, and his life span is very short. This is the case of a person who, having done an unwholesome action, must experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result. Again, there is a person who has done an unwholesome action and must experience suffering as its fruit by [experiencing] the result in this life. Why must a person who has done an unwholesome action experience suffering as its fruit by [experiencing] the result in this life? This is the case when a person has cultivated the body, has cultivated virtue, has cultivated the mind, has cultivated wisdom, and his life span is very long. This is the case of a person who, having done an unwholesome action, must experience suffering as its fruit by [expe riencing] the result in this life. Suppose a person were to drop an ounce of salt into the waters of the Ganges, intending to make the water salty and undrinkable. What do you think? Could this ounce of salt cause the water of the Ganges to become salty and undrinkable? [The monks] replied: No, World-honored One. And why not? Because, the water of the Ganges is much while an ounce of salt is little, therefore the salt cannot make the water salty and undrinkable. [The Buddha continued:] It is the same with a person who has done an unwholesome action and

must experience suffering as its fruit by [experiencing] the result in this life. Why must a person who has done an unwholesome action experience suffering as its fruit by [experiencing] the result in this life? This is the case when a person has cultivated the body, has cultivated virtue, has cultivated the mind, has cultivated wisdom, and his life span is very long; this is the case of a person who, having done an unwholesome action, must experience suffering as its fruit by [expe- riencing] the result in this life. Again, there is a person who has done an unwholesome action and must experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result. Why must a person who has done an unwholesome action experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result? This is the case when a person has not cultivated the body, has not cul- tivated virtue, has not cultivated the mind, has not cultivated wisdom, and his life span is very short. This is the case of a person who, having done an unwholesome action, must experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result. It is just as when a person takes a goat belonging to another person. What is the case of a person who has taken away another person’s goat? The one who took the goat is perhaps a king or a king’s minister, someone possessing much power. The owner of the goat is poor and powerless. Because of his lack of power, he can only hope against hope and, with his palms placed together, implore the other: “Sire! Please return the goat to me, or give me the price of the goat!” This is the case of a person who takes away another person’s goat. In the same way, when a person has done an unwholesome action, he must experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result. Why is it that a person who has done an unwholesome action must experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result? This is the case when a person has not cultivated the body, has not cultivated virtue, has not cultivated the mind, has not cultivated wisdom, and his life span is very short. This is the case of a person who, having done an unwholesome action, must experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result. Again, there is a person who has done an unwholesome action

and must experience suffering as its fruit by [experiencing] the result in this life. Why must a person who has done an unwholesome action experience suffering as its fruit by [experiencing] the result in this life? This is the case when a person has cultivated the body, has cultivated virtue, has cultivated the mind, has cultivated wisdom, and his life span is very long. This is the case of a person who, having done an unwholesome action, must experience suffering as its fruit by [expe riencing] the result in this life. It is just as when a person steals another’s goat and the owner of the goat takes it back by force. What is the case of a person who has stolen another’s goat, and the owner of the goat takes it back by force? [Here] the person who steals the goat is poor and powerless, while the owner of the goat is perhaps a king or a king’s minister, someone pos sessing much power. Because of their power they can detain and arrest the thief, and take the goat back by force. This is the case of a person who has stolen another’s goat, and the owner of the goat takes it back by force. It is the same with a person who has done an unwholesome action and must experience suffering as its fruit by [experiencing] the result in this life. Why is it that a person who has done an unwholesome action must experience suffering as its fruit by [experiencing] the result in this life? This is the case when a person has cultivated the body, has cultivated virtue, has cultivated the mind, has cultivated wisdom, and his life span is very long. This is the case of a person who, having done an unwholesome deed, must experience suffering as its fruit by [expe riencing] the result in this life. Again, there is a person who has done an unwholesome action and must experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result. Why must a person who has done an unwholesome action experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result? This is the case when a person has not cultivated the body, has not cul tivated virtue, has not cultivated the mind, has not cultivated wisdom, and his life span is very short. This is the case of a person who, having done an unwholesome action, must experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result.

It is just as when a person owes another person five coins and is arrested by the creditor, or is arrested by him even for owing just one coin. Why would a person who owes another person five coins be arrested by the creditor, or even be arrested by him for owing just one coin? This is the case when the debtor is poor and powerless. Because he is poor and powerless, when he owes another person five coins, he will be arrested by the creditor, or will even be arrested by him for owing just one coin. This is the case of a person who owes another person five coins and is arrested by the creditor, or even is arrested by him for owing just one coin. It is the same with a person who has done an unwholesome action and must experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result. Why must a person who has done an unwholesome action experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result? This is the case when a person has not cultivated the body, has not cul- tivated virtue, has not cultivated the mind, has not cultivated wisdom, and his life span is very short. This is the case of a person who, having done an unwholesome action, must experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result Again, there is a person who has done an unwholesome action and must experience suffering as its fruit by [experiencing] the result in this life. Why must a person who has done an unwholesome action experience suffering as its fruit by [experiencing] the result in this life? This is the case when a person has cultivated the body, has cultivated virtue, has cultivated the mind, has cultivated wisdom, and his life span is very long. This is the case of a person who, having done an unwholesome action, must experience suffering as its fruit by [expe- riencing] the result in this life. It is just as when a person owes another person a hundred coins, yet is not arrested by the creditor, and would not be arrested by him even for owing a thousand or ten thousand coins. Why is it that a person who owes another person a hundred coins is not arrested by the creditor, and would not be arrested by him even for owing a thousand or ten thousand coins? This is the case when the debtor has property beyond measure and is extremely powerful, and because of that, despite owing

another person a hundred coins, is not arrested by the creditor, and would not be arrested by him even for owing a thousand or ten thousand coins. This is the case of a person who owes another person a hundred coins, yet is not arrested by the creditor, and would not be arrested by him even for owing a thousand or ten thousand coins. It is the same with a person who has done an unwholesome action, he must experience suffering as its fruit by [experiencing] the result in this life. Why is it that a person who has done an unwholesome action must experience suffering as its fruit by [experiencing] the result in this life? This is the case when a person has cultivated the body, has cultivated virtue, has cultivated the mind, has cultivated wisdom, and his life span is very long. This is the case of a person who, having done an unwhole some action, must experience suffering as its fruit by [experiencing] the result in this life. He experiences the result for wholesome and unwholesome actions in this life, and only to a moderate degree. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
