### 126. The Discourse on Engaging in Sensual Pleasures

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Buddha, paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, stepped back, and sat to one side. He said, “World-honored One, in the world how many kinds of persons are there who engage in sensual pleasures?” The World-honored One said: Householder, in the world there are altogether ten kinds of persons who engage in sensual pleasures. What are the ten? Householder, one kind of person who engages in sensual pleasures seeks wealth in improper ways, contrary to the Dharma. Having sought wealth in improper ways, contrary to the Dharma, he does not [use it to] support himself or provide for the comfort of his mother and father, wife and children, servants and employees; nor does he [use it to] make offerings to renunciants and brahmins whereby he might ascend to higher kinds of pleasure, experiencing pleasurable results by being reborn into a heaven of long life. There is this kind of person who engages in sensual pleasures. Again, householder, one kind of person who engages in sensual pleas- ures seeks wealth in improper ways, contrary to the Dharma. Having sought wealth in improper ways, contrary to the Dharma, he is able to support himself and provide for the comfort of his mother and father, wife and children, servants and employees; [yet he] does not make offerings to renunciants and brahmins whereby he might ascend to higher kinds of pleasure, experiencing pleasurable results by being reborn in a heaven of long life. There is this kind of person who engages in sensual pleasures. Again, householder, one kind of person who engages in sensual pleasures seeks wealth in improper ways, contrary to the Dharma. Having sought wealth in improper ways, contrary to the Dharma, he is able to support himself and provide for the comfort of his mother and father, wife and children, servants and employees, and he also makes offerings to renunciants and brahmins whereby he may ascend to higher kinds of pleasure, expe- riencing pleasurable results by being reborn into a heaven of long life. There is this kind of person who engages in sensual pleasures. Again, householder, one kind of person who engages in sensual pleas- ures seeks wealth both in accordance with the Dharma and contrary to the Dharma. Having sought wealth both in accordance with the Dharma

and contrary to the Dharma, he does not [use it to] support himself or pro vide for the comfort of his mother and father, wife and children, servants and employees; nor does he [use it to] make offerings to renunciants and brahmins whereby he might ascend to higher kinds of pleasure, experi encing pleasurable results by being reborn into a heaven of long life. There is this kind of person who engages in sensual pleasures. Again, householder, one kind of person who engages in sensual pleas ures seeks wealth both in accordance with the Dharma and contrary to the Dharma. Having sought wealth both in accordance with the Dharma and contrary to the Dharma, he is able to support himself and provide for the comfort of his mother and father, wife and children, servants and employees; [yet he] does not make offerings to renunciants and brahmins whereby he might ascend to higher kinds of pleasure, experiencing pleas urable results by being reborn into a heaven of long life. There is this kind of person who engages in sensual pleasures. Again, householder, one kind of person who engages in sensual pleas ures seeks wealth both in accordance with the Dharma and contrary to the Dharma. Having sought wealth both in accordance with the Dharma and contrary to the Dharma, he is able to support himself and provide for the comfort of his mother and father, wife and children, servants and employees; and he also makes offerings to renunciants and brahmins whereby he may ascend to higher kinds of pleasure, experiencing pleas urable results by being reborn into a heaven of long life. There is this kind of person who engages in sensual pleasures. Again, householder, one kind of person who engages in sensual pleas ures seeks wealth in proper ways, in accordance with the Dharma. Having sought wealth in proper ways, in accordance with the Dharma, he does not [use it to] support himself or provide for the comfort of his mother and father, wife and children, servants and employees; nor does he [use it to] make offerings to renunciants and brahmins whereby he might ascend to higher kinds of pleasure, experiencing pleasurable results by being reborn into a heaven of long life. There is this kind of person who engages in sensual pleasures. Again, householder, one kind of person who engages in sensual pleas ures seeks wealth in proper ways, in accordance with the Dharma. Having

sought wealth in proper ways, in accordance with the Dharma, he is able to support himself and provide for the comfort of his mother and father, wife and children, servants and employees, [yet he] does not make offerings to renunciants and brahmins whereby he might ascend to higher kinds of pleasure, experiencing pleasurable results by being reborn into a heaven of long life. There is this kind of person who engages in sensual pleasures. Again, householder, one kind of person who engages in sensual pleasures seeks wealth in proper ways, in accordance with the Dharma. Having sought wealth in proper ways, in accordance with the Dharma, he is able to support himself and provide for the comfort of his mother and father, wife and chil- dren, servants and employees; and he also makes offerings to renunciants and brahmins whereby he may ascend to higher kinds of pleasure, experi- encing pleasurable results by being reborn into a heaven of long life. Having obtained wealth, he is defiled [by it], attached, bound, and tied [to it]. Being defiled [by it], attached, bound, and tied [to it], he uses [that wealth] without seeing the danger [in it] and without knowing how to transcend it. There is this kind of person who engages in sensual pleasures. Again, householder, one kind of person who engages in sensual pleasures seeks wealth in proper ways, in accordance with the Dharma. Having sought wealth in proper ways, in accordance with the Dharma, he is able to support himself and provide for the comfort of his mother and father, wife and chil- dren, servants and employees; and he also makes offerings to renunciants and brahmins whereby he may ascend to higher kinds of pleasure, experi- encing pleasurable results by being reborn into a heaven of long life. Having obtained wealth, he is not defiled by it, not attached, bound, and tied to it. Being not defiled by it, not attached, bound, and tied to it, he uses [that wealth] while seeing the danger in it, and knows how to transcend it. There is this [tenth] kind of person who engages in sensual pleasures. Householder, suppose there is a person who engages in sensual pleasures and seeks wealth in improper ways, contrary to the Dharma; who, having sought wealth in improper ways, contrary to the Dharma, does not [use it to] support himself or provide for the comfort of his mother and father, wife and children, servants and employees; and who does not [use it to] make offerings to renunciants and brahmins whereby he might ascend to higher kinds of pleasure, experiencing pleasurable results by being reborn

into a heaven of long life. This kind of person who engages in sensual pleasures rates as the lowest among all the kinds of persons who engage in sensual pleasures.^399 Householder, suppose there is a person who engages in sensual pleasures and seeks wealth both in accordance with the Dharma and contrary to the Dharma; and who, having sought wealth both in accordance with the Dharma and contrary to the Dharma, supports himself and provides for the comfort of his mother and father, wife and children, servants and employees; and who also makes offerings to renunciants and brahmins whereby he may ascend to higher kinds of pleasure, experiencing pleas urable results by being reborn into a heaven of long life. This kind of person who engages in sensual pleasures is rated the highest among all the kinds of persons who engage in sensual pleasures [and who seek wealth both in accordance with the Dharma and contrary to the Dharma].^400 Householder, suppose there is a person who engages in sensual pleasures who seeks wealth in proper ways, in accordance with the Dharma; who, having sought wealth in proper ways, in accordance with the Dharma, sup ports himself and provides for the comfort of his mother and father, wife and children, servants and employees; and who also makes offerings to renunciants and brahmins whereby he may ascend to higher kinds of pleas ure, experiencing pleasurable results by being reborn into a heaven of long life. Having obtained wealth, he is not defiled by it, not attached, bound, and tied to it. Being not defiled by it, not attached, bound, and tied to it, he uses [that wealth] while seeing the danger in it, and knows how to tran scend it. This kind of person who engages in sensual pleasures is the fore most, the greatest, the superior, the best, the most excellent. He is the most sublime of all the kinds of persons who engage in sensual pleasures. It is just as from a cow comes milk, from milk comes cream, from cream comes butter, from butter comes ghee, from ghee comes clarified ghee—[among these] clarified ghee is the foremost, the greatest, the high est, the best, the most excellent and sublime. In the same way, householder, this [kind of] person who engages in sensual pleasures is the foremost, the greatest, the highest, the best, the most excellent, and the most sublime of all the kinds of persons who engage in sensual pleasures.

Then the World-honored One uttered these verses:^401 If someone seeks wealth in ways contrary to the Dharma, And if someone seeks it both in accordance with the Dharma and contrary to the Dharma, [Then,] by not using [that wealth] to provide for [others] and themselves, And also not using it as offerings to make merit, Both of them are at fault; They are the lowest among those who engage in sensual pleasures [in such ways]. If someone seeks wealth according to the Dharma, And gains it through his own effort, By using it to provide for himself and others, And also as offerings to make merit, On both accounts this is virtuous, He is the highest among those who engage in sensual pleasures [with attachment]. If one attains the wisdom of transcendence [While] engaging in sensual pleasures and living the domestic life, Seeing the danger in wealth, being contented, and using it frugally— Such a one attains the wisdom that transcends sensual pleasures. He is [in all respects] the highest among those who engage in sensual pleasures. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
