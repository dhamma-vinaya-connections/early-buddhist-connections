### 47. The [First] Discourse on the Precepts

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: If a monk breaks the precepts, then this is detrimental to being without regret, experiencing joy, rapture, tranquility, happiness, concentration, seeing and knowing things as they really are, disenchantment, dispas sion, and liberation. And lack of liberation is detrimental to [attaining] nirvana. If, [however,] a monk keeps the precepts, the condition exists for being without regret, experiencing joy, rapture, tranquility, happiness, concentration, seeing and knowing as it really is, disenchantment, dis passion, and liberation. And if there is liberation, the condition exists for [attaining] nirvana. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, those monks were delighted and remembered them well.
