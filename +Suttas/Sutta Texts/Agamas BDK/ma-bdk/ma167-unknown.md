### 167. The Discourse Spoken by Ānanda

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, staying in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the venerable Ānanda was teaching the monks, who had gath ered at night in the assembly hall, the verses on an auspicious night and their meaning. Then, when the night was over, toward dawn, a certain monk approached the Buddha. Having paid homage with his head, he stepped back, sat to one side, and said: World-honored One, the venerable Ānanda taught the monks, who had gathered at night in the assembly hall, the verses on an auspicious night and also their meaning.^362

Then the World-honored One told a certain monk, “Go to the monk Ānanda and say this, ‘Ānanda, the World-honored One summons you.’” That monk, on receiving the World-honored One’s instruction, rose from his seat, paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and left. He approached the venerable Ānanda and said, “The World-honored One summons the venerable Ānanda.” The venerable Ānanda then approached the Buddha. Having paid homage with his head, he stepped back, and stood to one side. The World-honored One asked, “Ānanda, is it true that you taught the monks, who had gathered at night in the assembly hall, the verses on an auspicious night and also their meaning?” The venerable Ānanda replied, “Yes, indeed.” The World-honored One asked, “Ānanda, how did you teach the monks the verses on an auspicious night and also their meaning?” Then the venerable Ānanda said: Be careful not to think about the past, And do not long for the future. Matters of the past have already ceased, And the future has not yet arrived. Phenomena in the present Are what one should contemplate,^363 Mindful of [their] lack of stability. The wise awaken in this way. Undertaking [such] practice of noble ones, Who need worry about death? “I shall disengage from that, [This] great suffering and misery shall end!” Practice diligently like this, Day and night without negligence! Therefore, one should regularly teach The verses on an auspicious night. The World-honored One asked further, “Ānanda, how does a monk think about the past?”^364

The venerable Ānanda replied: World-honored One, if a monk delights in form of the past, has desire for it, is attached to it, is established in it; if he delights in feeling... in perception... in formations... in consciousness of the past, has desire for it, is attached to it, is established in it—this is how a monk thinks about the past. The World-honored One asked further, “Ānanda, how does a monk not think about the past?” The venerable Ānanda replied: World-honored One, if a monk does not delight in form of the past, has no desire for it, is not attached to it, is not established in it; if he does not delight in feeling... in perception... in formations... in consciousness of the past, has no desire for it, is not attached to it, is not established in it—this is how a monk does not think about the past. The World-honored One asked further, “Ānanda, how does a monk long for the future?” The venerable Ānanda replied: World-honored One, if a monk delights in form of the future, has desire for it, is attached to it, is established in it; if he delights in feeling... in perception... in formations... in consciousness of the future, has desire for it, is attached to it, is established in it—this is how a monk longs for the future. The World-honored One asked further, “Ānanda, how does a monk not long for the future?” The venerable Ānanda replied: World-honored One, if a monk does not delight in form of the future, has no desire for it, is not attached to it, is not established in it; if he does not delight in feeling... in perception... in formations... in consciousness of the future, has no desire for it, is not attached to it, is not established in it—this is how a monk does not long for the future.

The World-honored One asked further, “Ānanda, how does a monk cling to phenomena in the present?” The venerable Ānanda replied: World-honored One, if a monk delights in form of the present, has desire for it, is attached to it, is established in it; if he delights in feeling... in perception... in formations... in consciousness of the present, has desire for it, is attached to it, is established in it—this is how a monk clings to phenomena in the present.^365 The World-honored One asked further, “Ānanda, how does a monk not cling to phenomena in the present?” The venerable Ānanda replied: World-honored One, if a monk does not delight in form of the present, has no desire for it, is not attached to it, is not established in it; if he does not delight in feeling... in perception... in formations... in consciousness of the present, has no desire for it, is not attached to it, is not established in it—this is how a monk does not cling to phenomena in the present. World-honored One, this is how I taught the monks, who had gathered at night in the assembly hall, the verses on an auspicious night and also their meaning. Then the World-honored One told the monks: It is well, it is well, my disciple is endowed with the eye, with knowledge, with meaning, with Dharma. Why is that? [Because my] disciple has explained the meaning [of the verses] in detail in the presence of the Teacher, employing these phrases and words. Just as the monk Ānanda has explained it, so you all should remember it. Why is that? [Because] this explanation is how [you] should contemplate the meaning. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the venerable Ānanda and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
