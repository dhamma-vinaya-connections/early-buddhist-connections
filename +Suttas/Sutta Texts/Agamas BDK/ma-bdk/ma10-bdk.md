### 10. The Discourse on the Cessation of the Taints

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying among the Kurus, at a Kuru town called Kammāsadhamma. At that time, the World-honored One addressed the monks: Through knowing and seeing, one attains the cessation of the taints, not without knowing and seeing. How does one attain the cessation of the taints through knowing and seeing? There is right attention and there is wrong attention. If one engages in wrong attention, then the not yet arisen taint of sensual desire will arise and the arisen [taint of sensual desire] will increase; the not yet arisen taints of existence and of ignorance will arise and the arisen [taints of existence and of ignorance] will increase. If, [however,] one engages in right attention, then the not yet arisen taint of sensual desire will not arise and the arisen [taint of sensual desire] will cease; the not yet arisen taints of existence and of ignorance will not arise and the arisen [taints of existence and of ignorance] will cease. The foolish worldling, who has not got to hear the right Dharma, has not met genuine good friends, does not know the noble Dharma, has not been trained in the noble Dharma, and does not know the Dharma as it really is—[if such a person] engages in wrong attention, then the not yet arisen taint of sensual desire will arise, and the arisen [taint of sensual desire] will increase; the not yet arisen taints of exis- tence and of ignorance will arise, and the arisen [taints of existence and of ignorance] will increase. [If, however, this person] engages in right attention, then the not yet arisen taint of sensual desire will not arise, and the arisen [taint of sensual desire] will cease; the not yet

arisen taints of existence and of ignorance will not arise, and the arisen [taints of existence and of ignorance] will cease. Through not knowing the Dharma as it really is, [the foolish worldling] thinks thoughts that should not be thought, and does not think thoughts that should be thought. Through his thinking thoughts that should not be thought, and not thinking thoughts that should be thought, the not yet arisen taint of sensual desire will arise, and the arisen [taint of sensual desire] will increase; the not yet arisen taints of existence and of ignorance will arise, and the arisen [taints of exis- tence and of ignorance] will increase. The learned noble disciple who has got to hear the right Dharma, has met genuine good friends, has been trained in the noble Dharma, and knows the Dharma as it really is—[if such a person nevertheless] engages in wrong attention, then the not yet arisen taint of sensual desire will arise, and the arisen [taint of sensual desire] will increase; the not yet arisen taints of existence and of ignorance will arise, and the arisen [taints of existence and of ignorance] will increase. [If, however, such a person] engages in right attention, then the not yet arisen taint of sensual desire will not arise, and the arisen [taint of sensual desire] will cease; the not yet arisen taints of existence and of ignorance will not arise, and the arisen [taints of existence and of ignorance] will cease. Through knowing the Dharma as it really is, [the learned noble disciple] does not think thoughts that should not be thought, and thinks thoughts that should be thought. Through his not thinking thoughts that should not be thought, and thinking thoughts that should be thought, the not yet arisen taint of sensual desire will not arise, and the arisen [taint of sensual desire] will cease; the not yet arisen taints of existence and of ignorance will not arise, and the arisen [taints of existence and of ignorance] will cease. There are seven [ways] of abandoning the taints, which [cause] distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow. What are the seven? There are taints that are to be abandoned through seeing, there are taints to be abandoned through guarding, there are taints to be abandoned through

avoiding, there are taints to be abandoned through using, there are taints to be abandoned through enduring, there are taints to be aban doned through removing, and there are taints to be abandoned through attending. How are taints abandoned through seeing? The foolish worldling, who has not got to hear the right Dharma, has not met genuine good friends, does not know the noble Dharma, and has not been trained in the noble Dharma—he does not know the Dharma as it really is. [Such a person,] through not practicing right attention, has the following thoughts: “I was in the past! I was not in the past! From what cause was I in the past? How was I in the past? I will be in the future! I will not be in the future! From what cause will I be in the future? How will I be in the future?” He wonders about himself [in the present]: “What is this so-called self? How did it come to be? This present sentient being, from where has it come? Where will it go? Rooted in what cause does it exist? From what future cause will it exist?” As he engages in wrong attention in this way, there arises [one or another of] six views. The view arises that there truly is a self; or the view arises that there truly is no self; or the view arises that the self perceives the self; or the view arises that the self perceives the not self; or the view arises that the not-self perceives the self; or the view arises that this is the self, namely that which is able to talk, able to know, able to act and to teach, and which acts and teaches, which is born in this or that realm and experiences the fruits of good and evil [actions], which certainly has come from nowhere, certainly does not exist, and certainly will not exist. This is called the deception of views, the agitation of views, the bondage of views, because of which the foolish worldling undergoes the suffering of birth, old age, disease, and death. [On the other hand,] the learned noble disciple, who has got to hear the right Dharma, has met genuine good friends, and has been trained in the noble Dharma—he knows the Dharma as it really is, knows suffering as it really is, knows the arising of suffering, knows the cessation of suffering, and knows the path [leading] to the cessation of suffering as it really is. Through his having come to know this as it

really is, three fetters cease: personality view, clinging to precepts, and doubt. Through the cessation of these three fetters, he attains stream- entry. He will not fall into evil conditions and is assured of progress towards right awakening within at most seven existences. Having gone through [at most] seven existences in the heavens or among human beings, he will attain the ending of suffering. If one does not know and see, then distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will arise; but if one does know and see, then distress, vex- ation, dejection, and sorrow will not arise. This is called abandoning the taints through seeing. How are taints abandoned through guarding? A monk, on seeing a form with the eye, guards the eye faculty and, with right attention, con- templates impurity. He is not guarding the eye faculty if, without right attention, he is contemplating purity. If one does not guard [the eye fac- ulty], then distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will arise; but if one does guard it, distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will not arise. Similarly for the ear, nose, tongue, body.... On knowing a mind-object with the mind, [a monk] guards the mind faculty and, with right attention, contemplates impurity. He is not guarding the mind faculty if, without right attention, he is contemplating purity. If one does not guard [the mind faculty], distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will arise; but if one does guard it, distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will not arise. This is called abandoning taints through guarding. How are taints abandoned through avoiding? A monk, on seeing a vicious elephant, should avoid it;... and similarly a vicious horse, a vicious ox, a vicious dog, a poisonous snake, a dangerous path, a ditch or pit, a cesspool, a river, a deep spring, a mountain precipice, a bad companion, a bad friend, an evil heretic, an evil neighbor, a bad abode, [or] anything that would cause doubt to arise in his [previously] undoubting companions in the holy life. A monk should completely avoid a bad companion, a bad friend, an evil heretic, an evil neighbor, a bad abode, [or] anything that would cause doubt to arise in his [pre- viously] undoubting companions in the holy life. If one does not avoid these, then distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will arise; but if one does avoid them, then distress, vexation,

dejection, and sorrow will not arise. This is called abandoning taints through avoiding. How are taints abandoned through using? A monk does not use his robes for the sake of gain, nor out of pride, nor for the sake of adorn ment, but for [protection against] mosquitoes, gadflies, wind, rain, cold, and heat, and out of shame [to conceal the private parts]. He does not use food and drink for the sake of gain, nor out of pride, nor for the pleasure of growing stout, but to maintain the body and remove distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow; for the sake of living the holy life, out of a wish to overcome former discomfort and prevent the arising of new discomfort; for the sake of living peacefully and without disease. He does not use abodes and dwelling places, beds and bedding, for the sake of gain, nor out of pride, nor for the sake of adornment, but to allay fatigue and be able to meditate. He does not use decoctions and medicines for the sake of gain, nor out of pride, nor for the pleasure of growing stout, but to remove sickness and vexation, to preserve the life faculty and [remain] safe from disease. If one does not use [these requisites properly], then distress, vex ation, dejection, and sorrow will arise; but if one does use [them prop erly], then distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will not arise. This is called abandoning taints through using. How are taints abandoned through enduring? To energetically abandon evil and unwholesome [states] and develop wholesome states, a monk continuously arouses the mind to wholehearted diligent effort, [thinking]: “Even if the body, skin, flesh, tendons, bones, blood, and marrow should all dry up, I will not stop striving. Not until the goal has been attained will I stop striving.” A monk should also endure hunger and thirst; cold and heat; mos quitoes, gadflies, flies, fleas, and lice; being assailed by wind and sun; being verbally abused and being beaten with sticks—he is able to endure it [all]. [Even if] the body suffers disease causing such extreme pain that his life seems to come to an end—whatever is unpleasant, he is able to endure it all.

If one does not endure [such things], then distress, vexation, dejec- tion, and sorrow will arise; but if one does endure them, then distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will not arise. This is called abandoning taints through enduring. How are taints abandoned through removing? When thoughts of sensual desire arise, a monk removes, discards, abandons, and gets rid of them.^69 When thoughts of ill will or harming arise, he removes, dis- cards, abandons, and gets rid of them. If one does not remove [such thoughts], then distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will arise; but if one does remove them, then distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will not arise. This is called abandoning taints through removing. How are taints abandoned through attending? A monk attends to mindfulness, the first factor of awakening, based on seclusion, dispas- sion, and cessation, and leading to emancipation. [He attends to inves- tigation of] phenomena... energy... joy... tranquility... concen- tration... ; he attends to equanimity, the seventh factor of awakening, based on seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, and leading to emanci- pation. If one does not attend to [the factors of awakening], then distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will arise; but if one does attend to them, then distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will not arise. This is called abandoning taints through attending. If a monk, through seeing, abandons the taints that are to be aban- doned through seeing; through guarding, abandons the taints that are to be abandoned through guarding; through avoiding, abandons the taints that are to be abandoned through avoiding; through using, aban- dons the taints that are to be abandoned through using; through enduring, abandons the taints that are to be abandoned through enduring; through removing, abandons the taints that are to be abandoned through remov- ing; through attending, abandons the taints that are to be abandoned through attending—then he is called a monk who has abandoned all taints and has been liberated from all bondage, who has, through right knowledge, been able to make an end of suffering. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
