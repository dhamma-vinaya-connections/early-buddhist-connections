### 109. The [First] Discourse on Examining One’s Own Mind

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: If a monk is not able to skillfully examine the minds of others, then he should skillfully examine his own mind; he should train himself like this.^306 How does a monk skillfully examine his own mind? A monk will certainly ensure much benefit for himself if he contemplates like this: “Have I attained inner tranquility while not having attained supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena? Have I attained supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena while not having attained inner tranquility? Have I attained neither inner tranquility nor supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena? Have I attained both inner tranquility and supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena?” If a monk, having examined himself, knows: “I have attained inner tran quility while not having attained supreme wisdom of insight into phenom ena,” then this monk, having attained inner tranquility, should strive to attain supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena. Later, having attained inner tranquility, he also attains supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena. If a monk, having examined himself, knows: “I have attained supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena while not having attained inner tranquility,” then that monk, having attained supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena, should strive to attain inner tranquility. Later, having attained supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena, he also attains inner tranquility. If a monk, having examined himself, knows: “I have attained neither inner tranquility nor supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena,” then such a monk, having not yet attained these wholesome states, because of wanting to attain them, should strive quickly by every means, training with utmost diligence, relentlessly, with right mindfulness and right comprehension. It is just as a person whose head is on fire or whose clothes are on fire would quickly seek means to save his head and save his clothes. In the

same way, a monk who has not yet attained these wholesome states, due to wanting to attain them should strive quickly by every means, training with utmost diligence, relentlessly, with right mindfulness and right com- prehension. Later, having attained inner tranquility, he also attains supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena. If a monk, having examined himself, knows, “I have attained inner tranquility and also attained supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena,” then that monk, established in these wholesome states, should strive to realize the higher knowledge of the destruction of the taints. Why is that? I say of robes that not every one of them can be kept, [but] I also say of robes that every one of them can be kept. What kind of robe do I say cannot be kept? If by the keeping of a [certain] robe evil and unwholesome states increase and wholesome states decrease, then I say that kind of robe cannot be kept. What kind of robe do I say can be kept? If by the keeping of a [certain] robe wholesome states increase and evil and unwholesome states decrease, then I say that kind of robe can be kept. As with robes, in the same way it is also with food and drink, beds and bedding, and villages and towns. I say [further] that one cannot associate with every person, [but] I also say that one can associate with every person. What kind of person do I say cannot be associated with? If through association with a person evil and unwholesome states increase and wholesome states decrease, then I say that kind of person should not be associated with. What kind of person do I say can be associated with? If through association with a person wholesome states increase and evil and unwholesome states decrease, then I say that kind of person can be associated with.^307 [Thus] one knows the qualities to be cultivated as they really are, and one knows the qualities not to be cultivated as they really are. Knowing the qualities to be cultivated and the qualities not to be cultivated as they really are, one does not cultivate the qualities that are not to be cultivated and one cultivates the qualities that are to be cultivated. When one does not cultivate the qualities that are not to be cultivated,^308 and cultivates the qualities that are to be cultivated, wholesome qualities increase and evil and unwholesome qualities decrease. This is how a monk skillfully examines

his own mind, skillfully knows his own mind, skillfully takes up [some qualities] and skillfully gives up [other qualities]. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
