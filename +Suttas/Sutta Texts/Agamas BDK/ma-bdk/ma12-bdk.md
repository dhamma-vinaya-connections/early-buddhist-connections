### 12. The Discourse to Vappa

Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu, in the Nigrodha Park. At that time, after the midday meal, Venerable Mahā Moggallāna was sitting in the assembly hall together with a company of monks for some pur pose. Then a Sakyan by the name of Vappa, a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas, wan dering around after noon, approached Venerable Mahā Moggallāna and, after exchanging greetings, sat down to one side. Then Venerable Mahā Moggallāna asked [the visitor] about this matter: What do you think, Vappa? If a monk is restrained in body, speech, and mind,^73 do you see any possible cause owing to which unwholesome taints might arise, leading to future existence? Vappa replied: Mahā Moggallāna, if a monk is restrained in body, speech, and mind, I do see a possible cause owing to which unwholesome taints might

arise, leading to future existence. Mahā Moggallāna, if someone has done unwholesome actions in a previous existence, then owing to that, unwholesome taints will arise, leading to future existence. [Soon] after this the World-honored One, who was meditating in a solitary place, heard with the purified divine ear, which surpasses that of [ordinary] human beings, the conversation between Venerable Mahā Moggallāna and Vappa the Sakyan, a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas. Hearing it, the World-honored One rose from his afternoon meditation, went toward the assembly hall, and sat down on a prepared seat in front of the assembly of monks. Having sat down, the World-honored One asked: Moggallāna, what matter were you discussing with Vappa the Sakyan, a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas? For what matter were you sitting together in the assembly hall? Venerable Mahā Moggallāna replied: World-honored One, today after the midday meal I was sitting in the assembly hall together with a company of monks for some purpose. Then Vappa the Sakyan, a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas, wandering around after noon, approached me and, after exchanging greetings, sat down to one side. I asked him this: “What do you think, Vappa? If a monk is restrained in body, speech, and mind, do you see a possible cause owing to which unwholesome taints might arise, leading to future exis- tence?” Then Vappa the Sakyan, a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas, replied: “If a monk is restrained in body, speech, and mind, I do see a possible cause owing to which unwholesome taints might arise, leading to future existence. Mahā Moggallāna, if someone has done unwholesome actions in a previous existence, then, owing to that, unwholesome taints will arise, leading to future existence.” World-honored One, that was the discussion I was having with Vappa the Sakyan, a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas. Because of this matter, we were sitting together in the assembly hall. Then the World-honored One said to Vappa the Sakyan, a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas:

If you agree with what I say, you should say “yes”; if you disagree, you should say “no”; and if you have any uncertainty, you should ask me further thus: “Renunciant Gotama, how is this? What is the meaning of this?” If you can accept what I have just proposed, I could discuss this matter with you. Vappa replied: Renunciant Gotama, if I agree with what you say, I will say “yes”; if I disagree, I will say “no”; and if I have any uncertainty, I will ask you further thus: “Renunciant Gotama, how is this? What is the meaning of this?” As the renunciant Gotama has just proposed, I accept it. May the renunciant Gotama discuss this matter with me! The World-honored One asked: What do you think, Vappa? Suppose that a monk has [in the past] given rise to unwholesome bodily activities, [resulting in the arising of] taints, vexation, and worry, [but] that at a later time he ceases unwholesome bodily activities. Creating no new karma, and having abandoned old karma, he, in this very life, attains the goal and, free from vexation, remains permanently and unchangingly [in this condition], which is spoken of as “something to be seen by noble wisdom and to be known by noble wisdom.” [In the past] he gave rise to unwholesome verbal activities... , unwholesome mental activities... , unwholesome activities based on ignorance, [but] that at a later time he ceases unwholesome activities based on ignorance. Creating no new karma, and having abandoned old karma, he in this very life attains the goal and, free from vexation, remains permanently and unchangingly [in this condition], which is spoken of as “something to be seen by noble wisdom and to be known by noble wisdom.” What do you think, Vappa? For a monk who is restrained in body, speech, and mind in this way, do you see a possible cause owing to which unwholesome taints might arise, leading to future existence? Vappa replied:

Gotama, if a monk is restrained in body, speech, and mind in this way, I see no possible cause owing to which unwholesome taints might arise, leading to future existence.

The World-honored One praised him, saying:

Very good, Vappa! Why is that, Vappa? If in a monk ignorance has been extinguished and knowledge has arisen, then with ignorance extin guished and knowledge arisen, when there arises the feeling of the body nearing its end, he knows that there has arisen the feeling of the body nearing its end. When there arises the feeling of life nearing its end, he knows that there has arisen the feeling of life nearing its end. And when the body breaks up and life ends, the life span having expired, then all that is felt in this life will be exhausted and come to an end. It should be understood that it will end and become cold. Vappa, it is just like a shadow that exists in dependence on a tree. Suppose that someone comes with a sharp axe and chops down the tree at its root, cuts it into pieces; then breaks [each piece] into ten or a hundred fragments, burns them in a fire so that they become ash, which is then blown away by a strong wind, or carried away by water. What do you think, Vappa? That shadow existed in dependence on the tree, so once the cause of the shadow has been cut off, will the shadow disappear and not arise again?

Vappa replied: “Indeed, Gotama.” [The Buddha continued:]

Vappa, it should be understood in the same way in the case of a monk in whom ignorance has been extinguished and knowledge has arisen. With ignorance extinguished and knowledge arisen, when there arises the feeling of the body nearing its end, he knows that there has arisen the feeling of the body nearing its end. When there arises the feeling of life nearing its end, he knows that there has arisen the feeling of life nearing its end. And when the body breaks up and life ends, the life span having expired, then all that is felt in this life will be exhausted and come to an end. It should be understood that it will end and become cold.

Vappa, a monk whose mind has been rightly liberated like this attains six wholesome abodes. What are the six? Vappa, on seeing a form with the eye, [such] a monk is neither pleased nor displeased; he remains equanimous and unaffected, with right mindfulness and right attentiveness. Vappa, a monk whose mind has been rightly liberated like this attains the first wholesome abode. Similarly, [on hearing a sound with] the ear... [on smelling an odor with] the nose... [on tasting a flavor with] the tongue... [on experiencing a touch with] the body... on cognizing a mental phenomenon with the mind, he is neither pleased nor displeased; he remains equanimous and unaffected, with right mindfulness and right attentiveness. Vappa, a monk whose mind has been rightly liberated like this attains the sixth wholesome abode. Vappa, a monk whose mind has been rightly liberated like this attains these six wholesome abodes. Vappa replied: Indeed, Gotama. A learned noble disciple whose mind has been rightly liberated like this attains six wholesome abodes. What are the six? Gotama, a learned noble disciple, on seeing a form with the eye, is neither pleased nor displeased; he remains equanimous and unaf fected, with right mindfulness and right attentiveness. Gotama, this is the first wholesome abode for a noble disciple who has learned much and whose mind has been rightly liberated. Similarly, [on hearing a sound with] the ear... [on smelling an odor with] the nose... [on tasting a flavor with] the tongue... [on experiencing a touch with] the body... on cognizing a mental phenomenon with the mind, he is neither pleased nor displeased; he remains equanimous and unaffected, with right mindfulness and right attentiveness. Indeed, Gotama, a learned noble disciple whose mind has been rightly liberated like this attains the sixth wholesome abode. Indeed, Gotama, a learned noble disciple whose mind has been rightly liberated like this attains these six wholesome abodes. Thereupon, Vappa [continued and] said to the World-honored One: Gotama, I have known it! Well-gone One, I have understood it! Gotama,

it is just as when someone with clear vision uncovers what was covered, exposes what was covered, or shows the way to one who was lost, or offers a light in the darkness, so that those with eyes can see forms. In the same way, the renunciant Gotama has taught me the Dharma using countless skillful means to reveal its meaning in various ways. World-honored One, I now go for refuge to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community of monks (Sangha). May the World-hon- ored One accept me as a lay follower! From this day forth until life ends I go [to him] for refuge. World-honored One, just as a person who raises a bad horse, expecting to get benefit from it, only tires himself and gets no bene- fit—World-honored One, I was like this. Those foolish Nigaṇṭhas lack right knowledge; they are unable to understand and know. Not recog- nizing the fertile field [of the Buddha’s teaching], and not examining for myself, [I] revered them for a long time, made offerings, and paid them homage, expecting to get benefit from it; but I only suffered in vain. World-honored One, for a second time I now go for refuge to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community of monks. May the World- honored One accept me as a lay follower! From this day forth until life ends I go [to him] for refuge. World-honored One, formerly I was ignorant. Whatever faith and respect I had for those foolish Nigaṇṭhas has today been cut off. Why? Because I was deceived. World-honored One, for a third time, I now go for refuge to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community of monks. May the World-honored One accept me as a lay follower! From this day forth until life ends I go [to him] for refuge. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the Sakyan Vappa and the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
