### 114. The Discourse on Uddaka [Rāmaputta]

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: In assemblies Uddaka Rāmaputta often spoke like this, “In this lifetime I have contemplated this and realized this. Not knowing the root of the tumor, I have subsequently come to know fully the root of the tumor.”^332 Uddaka Rāmaputta was not omniscient yet he claimed to be omnis- cient;^333 he had not actually realized but claimed to have realized. Uddaka Rāmaputta had this view and taught like this, “Existence is an illness, a tumor, a thorn. Those who advocate nonperception are foolish. Those who have realized [know]: this is tranquil, this is sublime, namely attaining the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception.” He delighted in his own identity and clung to his own identity. Attached to his own identity, he practiced attaining the sphere of neither-percep- tion-nor-nonperception. On the breaking up of the body at death, he was reborn among the _deva_ s of neither-perception-nor-nonperception. When his life span there is exhausted he will return to this world and be reborn as a lowly person.^334 As to this, a monk [in my dispensation] might rightly say, “In this life- time I have contemplated this and realized this. Not knowing the root of the tumor, I have subsequently come to know fully the root of the tumor.” For a monk, what is right contemplation? A monk knows the six bases of contact, knows their arising, knows their passing away, knows their attrac- tion, knows their peril, and knows the escape from them. He knows [this] with wisdom, as it really is. For a monk this is called right contemplation. For a monk, what is realization? A monk knows the three [types of] feeling, knows their arising, knows their passing away, knows their attrac- tion, knows their peril, and knows the escape from them. He knows this with wisdom, as it really is. For a monk, this is called right realization.^335 For a monk, what is not knowing the root of the tumor but subsequently coming to know fully the root of the tumor? A monk knows that craving can be brought to cessation and pulls it out by its roots completely, so that

it does not arise again. For a monk, this is called not knowing the root of the tumor but subsequently coming to know fully the root of the tumor. As to the tumor, this is the body, with its coarse form made of the four elements, born of father and mother, to be nourished by food and drink, to be covered by clothing and blankets, to be massaged and bathed, having to endure being mishandled—it is impermanent by nature, of a nature to deteriorate and fall apart. This is called the tumor. As to the root of the tumor, this is the threefold craving.^336 Craving for sensual pleasures, craving for form, and craving for the formless: these are called the root of the tumor. As to the taints of the tumor, these are the six bases of sense contact. The taint [related to] the eye on seeing forms, the taint [related to] the ear on hearing sounds, the taint [related to] the nose on smelling odors, the taint [related to] the tongue on tasting flavors, the taint [related to] the body on experiencing tangibles, the taint [related to] the mind on knowing mental objects: these are called the taints of the tumor. Monks, I have taught you about the tumor, and about the root of the tumor.^337 What a teacher should do for his disciples out of great compassion, mercy, sympathy, and concern, seeking their benefit and welfare, seeking their safety and well-being, that I have now done. You too should do your part. Go sit in meditation and contemplation in a secluded place, on a mountain, in a forest, at the base of a tree, in an empty and quiet place. Do not be negligent. Make diligent efforts, lest you regret it later. This is my instruction; this is my teaching. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
