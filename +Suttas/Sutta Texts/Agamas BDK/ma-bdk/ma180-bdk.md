### 180. The Discourse to Gotamī

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling among the Sakyans, in the Nigrodha Park at Kapilavatthu. At that time Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Buddha, holding a new robe of yellow color made out of thread with a golden [hue].^436 Having paid

homage with her head at the Buddha’s feet, she stepped back, sat to one side, and said: World-honored One, I have made this new robe myself out of yellow-col ored thread with a golden [hue] for the World-honored One. May he con descend to accept it, out of compassion for me. The World-honored One said: Gotamī, take this robe and offer it to the Sangha of monks. In offering it to the Sangha of monks, you will be honoring and supporting me as well as honoring and supporting the Sangha. Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī made her request three times, saying: World-honored One, I have made this new robe myself out of yellow-col ored thread with a golden [hue] for the World-honored One. May he con descend to accept it, out of compassion for me. The World-honored One replied three times, saying: Gotamī, take this robe and offer it to the Sangha of monks. In offering it to the Sangha of monks, you will be honoring and supporting me as well as honoring and supporting the Sangha. At that time the venerable Ānanda was standing behind the Buddha, hold ing a whisk and attending on him. Then the venerable Ānanda said: World-honored One, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī has been of much benefit to the World-honored One. After the death of the World-honored One’s mother she suckled and raised the World-honored One. The World-honored One said: Indeed, Ānanda. Indeed, Ānanda. Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī has been of much benefit to me. After the death of my mother she suckled and raised me. Ānanda, I have also been of much benefit to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī.^437 Why is that? Because of me, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī took refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha of monks. She is free of doubt in regard to the Three Jewels and in regard to dukkha, its arising, its cessation,

and the path [to its cessation]. She is accomplished in faith, morality, much learning, generosity, and wisdom. She abstains from killing, having abandoned killing; [she abstains] from taking what is not given... from sexual misconduct... from false speech... and she abstains from alcoholic beverages, having abandoned alcoholic beverages. Ānanda, if because of a certain person one takes refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha of monks; [if one becomes] free of doubt in regard to the Three Jewels and in regard to _dukkha,_ its arising, its cessation, and the path [to its cessation]; becomes accomplished in faith, morality, much learning, generosity, and wisdom; abstains from killing, having abandoned killing; [abstains] from taking what is not given... from sexual misconduct... from false speech... and abstains from alcoholic bever- ages, having abandoned alcoholic beverages—then one cannot possibly repay the kindness of such a person even if, for one’s whole life, one were to honor and support him with food and drink, robes and blankets, beds and seats, medicines, and the various [other] kinds of requisites. Again, Ānanda, there are seven [types of] offering to the Sangha and fourteen [types of] offering to individuals that bring great merit, great fruit, great virtue, great and extensive results.^438 Ānanda, what are the seven [types of] offering to the Sangha that bring great merit, great fruit, great virtue, great and extensive results? At a time when the Buddha is still in the world, a faithful clansman or clanswoman makes offerings to the Buddha and to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.^439 This is the first [type of] offering to the Sangha that brings great merit, great fruit, great virtue, great and extensive results. A faithful clansman or clanswoman makes offerings to the two com- munities at a time not long after the World-honored One has attained final nirvana... makes offerings to the Sangha of monks... makes offerings to the Sangha of nuns... goes to a monastic dwelling for monks and says to the Sangha [there], “Whichever monks from this Sangha come, I will make offerings to them”... goes to a monastic dwelling for nuns and says to the Sangha [there], “Whichever nuns from this Sangha come, I will make offerings to them.” This is the ^440 [type of] offering to the Sangha that brings great merit, great fruit, great virtue, great and extensive results.

Ānanda, at a future time there will be monks called “of the lineage,” who are not diligent, who wear the yellow robe but are not diligent.^441 I say that when an offering is intentionally made to these [monks] who are not diligent, then because [it is made] in dependence on the Sangha, because [it is made] with the Sangha as its cause, because [it is made] in honor of the Sangha, because [it is made] with the Sangha as its condition, the donor will gain merit that is immeasurable, that cannot be counted or calculated, attaining what is wholesome and pleasant. What is to be said, then, of [offerings made] to monks in the present who are accomplished in undertaking things, accomplished in discarding things, accomplished in undertaking and discarding things; accomplished in upright ness, accomplished in gentleness, accomplished in uprightness and gentle ness; accomplished in patience, accomplished in joyfulness, accomplished in patience and joyfulness; accomplished in being accommodating, accom plished in getting things done, accomplished in being accommodating and getting things done; accomplished in decorum, accomplished in [proper behavior when] going, coming, and remaining still, accomplished in decorum and in [proper behavior when] going, coming, and remaining still; accom plished in faith, accomplished in morality, accomplished in much learning, accomplished in generosity, accomplished in wisdom, accomplished in faith, morality, much learning, generosity, and wisdom! This is the seventh [type of] offering to the Sangha that brings great merit, great fruit, great virtue, great and extensive results. These are the seven [types of] offering to the Sangha that bring great merit, great fruit, great virtue, great and extensive results. Ānanda, what are the fourteen [types of] offering to individuals that bring great merit, great fruit, great virtue, great and extensive results? A faithful clansman or clanswoman makes an offering to the Tathā gata... makes an offering to a paccekabuddha... makes an offering to an arahant... makes an offering to one on the path to arahantship... makes an offering to a nonreturner... makes an offering to one on the path to nonreturning... makes an offering to a once-returner... makes an offering to one on the path to once-returning... makes an offering to a stream-enterer... makes an offering to one on the path to stream-entry... makes an offering to a non-Buddhist seer who is free of sensual desires...

makes an offering to a diligent person... makes an offering to a person who is not diligent... makes an offering to an animal. Ānanda, making an offering to an animal brings hundredfold merit; making an offering to a person who is not diligent brings thousandfold merit; making an offering to a diligent person brings hundred-thousandfold merit; making an offering to a non-Buddhist seer who is free of sensual desires brings hun- dred thousand times hundred-thousandfold merit; making an offering to one on the path to stream-entry brings immeasurable [merit]; making an offering to a stream-enterer brings immeasurable [merit]; making an offering to one on the path to once-returning brings immeasurable [merit]; making an offering to a once-returner brings immeasurable [merit]; making an offering to one on the path to nonreturning brings immeasurable [merit]; making an offering to a nonreturner brings immeasurable [merit]; making an offering to one on the path to arahantship brings immeasurable [merit]; making an offering to an arahant brings immeasurable [merit]; making an offering to a _pacceka - buddha_ brings immeasurable [merit]; what is to be said of making an offering to the Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened! These are the fourteen [types of] offering to individuals that bring great merit, great fruit, great virtue, great and extensive results. Again, Ānanda, there are four types of offering and three purifications of gifts. What are the four? There is the offering that is purified on account of the donor but not the recipient; there is the offering that is purified on account of the recipient but not the donor; there is the offering that is not purified on account of either the donor or the recipient; and there is the offering that is purified on account of both the donor and the recipient. Ānanda, what is the offering that is purified on account of the donor but not the recipient? The donor is diligent, they practice the sublime teachings, they look toward the future, look toward the fruits [of deeds], they have such a view and make such a declaration: “There is giving, and there are fruits of giving.” The recipient is not diligent, they practice evil teachings, they do not look toward the future, do not look toward the fruits [of deeds], they have such a view and make such a declaration: “There is no giving, and there are no fruits of giving.”^442

This is the offering that is purified on account of the donor but not the recipient. Ānanda, what is the offering that is purified on account of the recipient but not the donor? The donor is not diligent, they practice evil teachings, they do not look toward the future, do not look toward the fruits [of deeds], they have such a view and make such a declaration: “There is no giving, and there are no fruits of giving.” The recipient is diligent, they practice the sublime teachings, they look toward the future, look toward the fruits [of deeds], they have such a view and make such a declaration: “There is giving, and there are fruits of giving.” This is the offering that is purified on account of the recipient but not the donor. Ānanda, what is the offering that is not purified on account of either the donor or the recipient? The donor is not diligent, they practice evil teachings, they do not look toward the future, do not look toward the fruits [of deeds], they have such a view and make such a declaration: “There is no giving, and there are no fruits of giving.” The recipient is also not diligent, they practice evil teachings, they do not look toward the future, do not look toward the fruits [of deeds], they have such a view and make such a declaration: “There is no giving, and there are no fruits of giving.” This is the offering that is not purified on account of either the donor or the recipient. Ānanda, what is the offering that is purified on account of both the donor and the recipient? The donor is diligent, they practice the sublime teachings, they look toward the future, look toward the fruits [of deeds], they have such a view and make such a declaration: “There is giving, and there are fruits of giving.” The recipient is also diligent, they practice the sublime teachings, they look toward the future, look toward the fruits [of deeds], they have such a view and make such a declaration: “There is giving, and there are fruits of giving.” This is the offering that is purified on account of both the donor and the recipient.

Then, the World-honored One spoke these stanzas: A diligent one offers to one who is not diligent, In accordance with the Dharma, attaining a joyful mind, With faith that there are deeds and their results; Such an offering is purified on account of the donor. One who is not diligent offers to a diligent one, Not in accordance with the Dharma and without a joyful mind, Without faith in deeds and their results; Such an offering is purified on account of the recipient. A negligent one offers to one who is not diligent, Not in accordance with the Dharma and without a joyful mind, Without faith in deeds and their results; Such an offering is not of great result. A diligent one offers to one who is diligent, In accordance with the Dharma, attaining a joyful mind, With faith in deeds and their results; Such an offering is of great result. Male and female slaves and the poor^443 Joyfully part with their own [property] to make an offering, With faith in deeds and their results; Such an offering is wholesome and people praise it. With right restraint, with wholesome bodily and verbal [actions], As he holds out [his bowl] when begging for alms according to the Dharma, A dispassionate one makes an offering to a dispassionate one; This is foremost among material offerings. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the venerable Ānanda and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
