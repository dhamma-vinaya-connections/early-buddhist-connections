### 96. The Discourse on Absence

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks:^194 Venerable friends, if a monk or nun does not listen to a teaching that he or she has not yet heard; if he or she forgets teachings that he or she has heard; if he or she cannot recollect a teaching that he or she has practiced, developed, recited, and understood through wisdom, if he or she no longer knows what he or she knew, then, venerable friends, this is called the decline of pure states in that monk or nun.

Venerable friends, if a monk or a nun listens to a teaching that he or she has not yet heard; if he or she does not forget teachings that he or she has heard; if he or she frequently recollects teachings that he or she has practiced, developed, recited, and understood through wisdom, if he or she still knows what he or she knew, then this is called the increase of pure states in that monk or nun. Venerable friends, a monk should contemplate like this:^195 “Do I have covetousness, or do I not have covetousness? Do I have hatred, or do I not have hatred? Do I have sloth-and-torpor, or do I not have sloth-and- torpor? Do I have restlessness and arrogance, or do I not have restlessness and arrogance? Do I have doubt, or do I not have doubt? Am I disputatious, or am I not disputatious? Do I have a defiled and stained mind, or do I not have a defiled and stained mind? “Do I have faith, or do I not have faith? Do I have energy, or do I not have energy? Do I have mindfulness, or do I not have mindfulness? Do I have concentration, or do I not have concentration? Do I have faulty wisdom, or do I not have faulty wisdom?” Venerable friends, suppose that a monk, while contemplating, knows, “I have covetousness,... I have hatred,... I have sloth-and-torpor,... I have restlessness and arrogance,... I have doubt,... I am disputatious,... I have a defiled and stained mind,... I lack faith,... I lack energy,... I lack mindfulness,... I lack concentration,... I have faulty wisdom.” Venerable friends, that monk, wishing to eradicate these evil unwholesome states, should quickly seek the means to train with great diligence, with right mindfulness and right comprehension, persevering in order not to regress. Venerable friends, it is just as a person whose head is on fire or whose clothes are on fire will quickly seek the means to save his head and save his clothes. In the same way, venerable friends, a monk, wishing to erad- icate these evil and unwholesome states, will quickly seek the means to train with great diligence, with right mindfulness and right comprehension, persevering in order not to regress. Venerable friends, suppose that a monk, while contemplating, knows, “I am free of covetousness,... free of hatred,... free of sloth-and-torpor,... free of restlessness and arrogance,... free of doubt;... I am not dispu- tatious,... I do not have a defiled and stained mind,... I have faith,...

I have energy,... I have mindfulness,... I have concentration,... and I am free of faulty wisdom.” That monk, wishing to maintain these wholesome states, wishing not to lose them, not to regress but to develop them further, will quickly seek the means to train with great diligence, with right mindfulness and right comprehension, persevering in order not to regress. It is just as a person whose head is on fire or whose clothes are on fire will quickly seek the means to save his head and to save his clothes. In the same way, venerable friends, a monk, wishing to maintain these wholesome states, wishing not to lose them, not to regress but to develop them further, will quickly seek the means to train with great diligence, with right mind- fulness and right comprehension, persevering in order not to regress.^196 Thus spoke Venerable Sāriputta. Having heard what Venerable Sāriputta said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
