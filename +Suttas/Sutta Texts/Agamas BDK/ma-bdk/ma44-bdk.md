### 44. The Discourse on Mindfulness

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks:

If a monk is often forgetful and not rightly attentive, this is detrimental to right mindfulness and right attentiveness. Lack of right mindfulness and right attentiveness is detrimental to guarding the sense faculties, keeping the precepts, being without regret, experiencing joy, rapture, tranquility, happiness, concentration, seeing and knowing things as they really are, disenchantment, dispassion, and liberation. And absence of liberation is detrimental to [attaining] nirvana. If a monk is not forgetful and has right attentiveness, the condition exists for right mindfulness and right attentiveness. If he has right mindfulness and right attentiveness, the condition exists for guarding the sense faculties, keeping the precepts, being without regret, experiencing joy, rapture, tranquility, happiness, concentration, seeing and knowing things as they really are, disenchant- ment, dispassion, and liberation. And if he has liberation, the condition exists for [attaining] nirvana. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, those monks were delighted and remembered them well.
