### 66. The Discourse on Origins

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Benares, in the Deer Park, the Place of Seers. At that time, the monks were seated together in the assembly hall after the midday meal on account of some small matter and had the following discussion: Venerable friends, what do you say? Which is better for a lay fol lower—that a monk, who keeps the precepts of the sublime Dharma and is endowed with imposing deportment should enter his house to receive food, or that he [should gain] material benefits a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand times each day? A certain monk said: Venerable friends, what is the use of material benefits a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand times? Only this is important, namely that a monk who keeps the precepts of the sublime Dharma and is endowed

with imposing deportment should enter his house to receive food, not that [he should gain] material benefits a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand times each day. At that time Venerable Anuruddha was seated among the assembly. Then the Venerable Anuruddha addressed the monks:

Venerable friends, what is the use of material benefits a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand times, or [even] more than that? Only this is important, namely that a monk who keeps the precepts of the sublime Dharma and is endowed with imposing deportment should enter his house to receive food, not [that he should gain] material benefits a hun dred, a thousand, or ten thousand times a day. Why is that? I recall how, in the distant past, I was a poor man in this country of Benares. I relied on gleaning to earn my living. At that time, the country of Benares was afflicted by drought, early frost, and locusts, so [the crops] did not ripen. The people suffered from famine and alms food was difficult to obtain. At that time, there was a paccekabuddha named Upariṭṭha,^165 who was living in dependence on Benares. Then, when the night was over, at dawn, the paccekabuddha Upariṭṭha put on his robes, took his bowl, and went into Benares to beg for food. At that time, in the morning, I was going out of Benares to glean. Venerable friends, as I was going out, I saw the paccekabuddha Upariṭṭha coming in. Then the pacceka buddha Upariṭṭha, having come in carrying an empty bowl, went out [again] with the bowl empty as before. Venerable friends, at that time I was returning to Benares from gleaning, and saw the paccekabuddha Upariṭṭha going out again. Seeing me, he thought: As I was coming in at dawn, I saw this person going out; now as I am going out, I see this person again, coming in. This person may not yet have had his meal. Let me now follow this person. Then the paccekabuddha followed me like a shadow following a form. Venerable friends, when I had got back home with my gleanings, I put down what I had gathered, and turning around, I saw that the

paccekabuddha Upariṭṭha had been following me like a shadow fol lowing a form. Seeing him, I thought: As I was going out at dawn, I saw this seer entering the city to beg for food. Now this seer may not yet have obtained any food. Let me forgo my own meal and give it to this seer! Thinking this, I gave my meal to the paccekabuddha saying, “Seer, you should know that this food is my portion. May you accept it out of compassion!” Then the paccekabuddha replied to me saying: Householder, you should know that this year [the country] is afflicted by drought, early frost, and locusts, [so] the five crops do not ripen. The people are suffering from famine and almsfood is difficult to obtain. Put half of [the food] into my bowl, and eat the other half yourself, so that [we] can both survive. That would be better. I said further: Seer, you should know that in my home I have a pot and a stove, firewood, grains, and rice; moreover, I have no restrictions as to when I may eat and drink. Seer, out of compassion for me, accept the whole meal! So the paccekabuddha accepted the whole meal out of compassion. Venerable friends, because of the merit of giving him a bowlful of food, I was reborn in a heavenly realm seven times, becoming king of the gods; and I was reborn as a human being seven times, becoming the king of human beings. Venerable friends, because of the merit of giving him a bowlful of food, I was reborn in Sakya clans that were very wealthy and prosperous, possessing in abundance all kinds of livestock, feudatories, and manors, limitless wealth and endowed with valuable treasures. Venerable friends, because of the merit of giving him a bowlful of food, I gave up kingship worth hundreds, thousands, millions of gold coins, not to mention various other possessions, and went forth

to practice the path. Venerable friends, because of the merit of giving him a bowlful of food, I was regarded and treated with admiration by kings, ministers, brahmins, householders, and all the citizens, and was regarded with respect by the four assemblies of monks, nuns, male lay followers, and female lay followers. Venerable friends, because of the merit of giving him a bowlful of food, I was constantly invited by people to accept food and drink, clothing and bedding, woolen blankets, carpets, beds and mattresses, shawls, medicine, and all [that is required for] living, and I never failed to receive invitations. Had I known at that time that that renunciant was a True Person, free of attachment, then the merit I gained would have been multiplied again. I would have received a great reward, the most excellent of ben- efits, its bright splendor boundless and vast. Then the Venerable Anuruddha, a True Person, free of attachment, who had attained right liberation, uttered this verse:^166

I recall how in the past I was poor, Relying entirely on gleaning to earn a living. Already short of food, I offered it to the renunciant Upariṭṭha, of utmost virtue. Because of this, I was reborn in the Sakya clan, Given the name Anuruddha. Knowing well how to sing and dance, I made merry and constantly delighted [in it]. [Then] I got to see the World-honored One, Fully awakened, [preaching the Dharma that is] like ambrosia. When I saw him, confidence and joy arose in me, And I gave up the household life to train in the path. I attained the recollection of past lives, Knowing my former births. [I saw that] I was [previously] born among the thirty-three gods, Dwelling there for seven [life]times.

I was [born] seven times here, in addition to the seven times there. [Thus,] I had experienced fourteen [life]times In the human realm and in the heavens, Without ever descending into a bad realm. I now [also] know the death and rebirth Of beings, their destinations as they depart and are reborn. I know [the states of] mind of others, right or wrong, And the five kinds of enjoyment of the noble ones. [Having] attained the fivefold absorption, [By] constantly quieting and silencing the mind, Having attained quiescence, rightly abiding, I have gained the purified divine eye. What is considered training in the path, Secluded, having given up the household life, I now have obtained its benefit, And entered the sphere of the Buddha. I take no delight in death, Nor do I wish for rebirth. When the time comes, when it is appropriate, With right mindfulness and attentiveness established, In the Bamboo Grove at Vesālī, My life will end. Beneath the bamboos of the grove, [I shall attain] nirvana without remainder. At that time, the World-honored One was sitting in meditation, and with the divine ear, which is purified and surpasses human [hearing], he heard the monks, sitting together in the assembly hall after the midday meal, discussing this topic. Having heard it, in the late afternoon the World-honored One rose from sitting in meditation, went to the assembly hall and sat on a seat arranged before the assembly of monks. He asked the monks, “On account of what matter are you assembled in the assembly hall today?”

Then the monks answered: World-honored One, we are assembled in the assembly hall today because Venerable Anuruddha was teaching the Dharma in relation to events of the past. Then the World-honored One told the monks, “Would you like to hear the Tathāgata teach the Dharma in relation to an event of the future?” The monks answered: World-honored One, now is the right occasion. Well-gone One, now is the right occasion. If the World-honored One would teach the monks the Dharma in relation to an event of the future, the monks, hearing it, will receive and remember it well. The World-honored One said, “Listen carefully, monks. Listen carefully and pay proper attention, and I will explain it to you in full.” Then the monks listened in order to receive instruction. The World-hon- ored One said:

Monks, in the distant future the human life span will be eighty thousand years.^167 When the human life span is eighty thousand years, [this con tinent of] Jambudīpa will be very wealthy and pleasant, with many inhabitants; villages and cities will be as close [together] as a single cock’s flight. Monks, when the human life span is eighty thousand years, women will get married at the age of five hundred. Monks, when the human life span is eighty thousand years, there will be only such problems as [being afflicted by] cold or heat, [having to] defecate and urinate, [having sexual] desires, [having to] eat and drink, and old age. There will be no other afflictions. Monks, when the human life span is eighty thousand years, there will be a king called Saṅkha, a wheel turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world, freely, as he likes. Being a righteous Dharma king, he will attain seven treasures. Those seven treasures are the wheel treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse treasure, the jewel treasure, the woman treasure, the steward treasure, and the counselor treasure—these are the seven. He will have a thousand sons, of hand some appearance, brave, fearless, and able to overcome others. He will

certainly rule over the whole earth, as far as the ocean, without relying on blade and cudgel, just by teaching the Dharma, bringing peace and happiness. He will have a great golden banner, gloriously decorated with various precious things, a thousand feet in height when raised, and sixteen feet in circumference. He will have it set up; and after it has been set up, beneath it he will make offerings of food and drink, clothes and bedding, vehicles, flower garlands, scattered flowers, per fume, dwellings, mattresses, woolen blankets, shawls, servants, and lamps, offering these to renunciants and brahmins, [as well as to] those in poverty, those without kin, and beggars from far away. Having made these offerings, he will then shave off his hair and beard, don the yellow robe, leave the household life out of faith, and go forth to practice the path. [He will do like those] clansmen, who shave off their hair and beards, don the yellow robe, leave the household life out of faith, and go forth to practice the path until the unsurpassable holy life has been established. He will, in that lifetime, personally [attain] understanding and awakening, and dwell having personally realized it. He will know as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence.” At that time Venerable Ajita was seated among the assembly. Then Ven erable Ajita rose from his seat, arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder, placed his palms together [in respect] toward the Buddha, and said: World-honored One, in the distant future when the human life span is eighty thousand years, may I become a king called Saṅkha, a wheel turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world, freely, as I like. Being a righteous Dharma king, I will attain seven treasures. Those seven treasures are the wheel treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse treasure, the jewel treasure, the woman treasure, the steward treasure, and the counselor treasure— these are the seven. I will have a thousand sons, of handsome appear ance, brave, fearless, and able to overcome others. I will certainly rule over the whole earth, as far as the ocean, without relying on blade or cudgel, just by teaching the Dharma, bringing peace and happiness. [I

will] have a great golden banner, gloriously decorated with various precious things, a thousand feet in height when raised, and sixteen feet in circumference. I will have it set up; and after it has been set up, beneath it I will make offerings of food and drink, clothes and bedding, vehicles, flower garlands, scattered flowers, perfume, dwellings, mat tresses, woolen blankets, shawls, servants, and lamps, offering these to renunciants and brahmins, [as well as to] those in poverty, those without kin, and beggars from far away. Having made these offerings, I will then shave off my hair and beard, don the yellow robe, leave the household life out of faith, and go forth to practice the path. [I will do like those] clansmen, who shave off their hair and beards, don the yellow robe, leave the household life out of faith, and go forth to practice the path until the unsurpassable holy life has been established. I will, in this very life, personally attain understanding and awakening, and dwell having personally realized it. I will understand as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence.”

Then the World-honored One reprimanded Venerable Ajita:

You foolish man, accepting to die one more time and [only] then trying to end it! Why is that? Because you have the thought: World-honored One, in the distant future when the human life span is eighty thousand years, I will be a king called Saṅkha, a wheel-turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a four fold army to reign over the entire world, freely, as I like. Being a righteous Dharma king, I will attain seven treasures. Those seven treasures are the wheel treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse treasure, the jewel treasure, the woman treasure, the steward treas ure, and the counselor treasure—these are the seven. I will have a thousand sons, handsome, brave, fearless, and able to overcome others. I will certainly rule over the whole earth, as far as the ocean, without relying on blade or cudgel, just by teaching the Dharma, bringing peace and happiness. [I will] have a great golden banner, gloriously decorated with various precious things, a thousand feet

in height when raised, and sixteen feet in circumference. I will have it set up; and after it has been set up, beneath it I will make offerings of food and drink, clothes and bedding, vehicles, flower garlands, scattered flowers, perfume, dwellings, mattresses, woolen blankets, shawls, servants, and lamps, offering these to renunciants and brahmins, [as well as to] those in poverty, those without kin, and beggars from far away. Having made these offerings, I will then shave off my hair and beard, don the yellow robe, leave the household life out of faith, and go forth to practice the path. [I will do like those] clansmen, who shave off their hair and beards, don the yellow robe, leave the household life out of faith, and go forth to practice the path until the unsurpassable holy life has been estab lished. I will, in this lifetime, personally attain understanding and awakening, and dwell having personally realized it. I will under stand as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been estab lished, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence.” The World-honored One said: Ajita, in the distant future when the human life span is eighty thousand years, you will be a king called Saṅkha, a wheel-turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world, freely, as you like. Being a righteous Dharma king, you will attain seven treasures. Those seven treasures are the wheel treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse treasure, the jewel treasure, the woman treasure, the steward treasure, and the counselor treasure—these are the seven. You will have a thousand sons, handsome, brave, fearless, and able to overcome others. You will certainly rule over the whole earth, as far as the ocean, without relying on blade or cudgel, just by teaching the Dharma, bringing peace and happiness. [You] will have a great golden banner, gloriously decorated with various precious things, a thousand feet in height when raised, and six teen feet in circumference. You will have it set up; and after it has been set up, beneath it you will make offerings of food and drink, clothes and bedding, vehicles, flower garlands, scattered flowers, perfume,

dwellings, mattresses, woolen blankets, shawls, servants, and lamps, offering these to renunciants and brahmins, [as well as to] those in poverty, those without kin, and beggars from far away. Having made these offerings, you will then shave off your hair and beard, don the yellow robe, leave the household life out of faith, and go forth to practice the path. [You will do like those] clansmen who shave off their hair and beards, don the yellow robe, leave home out of faith, and go forth to practice the path until the unsurpassable holy life has been established. You will, in this lifetime, personally attain understanding and awakening, and dwell having personally real ized it. You will understand as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence.”

The Buddha addressed the monks:

In the distant future, when the human life span is eighty thousand years, there will be a buddha called Metteyya Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened, accomplished in knowledge and con duct, a Well-gone One, a knower of the world, unsurpassable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and human beings, a buddha, a Fortunate One—just as I now have become a Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened, accomplished in knowledge and con duct, a Well-gone One, a knower of the world, unsurpassable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and human beings, a buddha, a Fortunate One. In this world with its gods, Māras, Brahmās, renunciants, and brah mins, from human beings to gods, he will [attain] understanding and awakening by himself and dwell having personally realized it—just as, in this world with its gods, Māras, Brahmās, renunciants and brah mins, from human beings to gods, I have [attained] understanding and awakening by myself, and dwell having personally realized it. He will teach the Dharma that is sublime in the beginning, sub lime in the middle, and also sublime in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, revealing a holy life endowed with purity—just as I now teach the Dharma that is sublime in the beginning, sublime in

the middle, and also sublime in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, revealing a holy life endowed with purity. He will spread widely the holy life, revealing it widely to countless great assemblies, from human beings to gods—just as I now spread widely the holy life, revealing it well to countless great assemblies, from human beings to gods. He will have a community of countless hundreds and thousands of monks—just as I now have a community of countless hundreds and thousands of monks. At that time Venerable Metteyya was seated among the assembly. Then Venerable Metteyya rose from his seat, arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder, placed his palms together [in respect] toward the Buddha, and said:

World-honored One, in the distant future, when the human life span is eighty thousand years, may I become a buddha called Metteyya Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a Well-gone One, a knower of the world, unsurpassable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and human beings, a buddha, a Fortunate One—just as the World-honored One now is a Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened, accom plished in knowledge and conduct, a Well-gone One, a knower of the world, unsurpassable leader of persons to be tamed, a teacher of gods and human beings, a buddha, a Fortunate One. In this world with its gods, Māras, Brahmās, renunciants, and brahmins, from human beings to gods, I will [attain] understanding and awakening by myself and dwell having personally realized it—just as, in this world with its gods, Māras, Brahmās, renunciants, and brahmins, from human beings to gods, the World-honored One has [attained] understanding and awak ening by himself, and dwells having personally realized it. I will teach the Dharma that is sublime in the beginning, sublime in the middle, and also sublime in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, revealing a holy life endowed with purity—just as the World honored One now teaches the Dharma that is sublime in the beginning, sublime in the middle, and also sublime in the end, with the right mean ing and phrasing, revealing a holy life endowed with purity.

I will spread widely the holy life, revealing it widely to countless great assemblies, from human beings to gods—just as the World-hon ored One now spreads widely the holy life, revealing it well to countless great assemblies, from human beings to gods. I will have a community of countless hundreds and thousands of monks—just as the World honored One now has a community of countless hundreds and thou sands of monks.

Then the World-honored One praised Metteyya, saying:

Very good, very good, Metteyya! You have expressed a wonderful wish, namely to lead great assemblies. Why is that? You had this thought: World-honored One, in the distant future, when the human life span is eighty thousand years, may I become a buddha called Metteyya Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a Well-gone One, a knower of the world, unsurpassable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and human beings, a buddha, a Fortunate One— just as the World-honored One now is a Tathāgata, free from attach ment and fully awakened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a Well-gone One, a knower of the world, unsurpassable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and human beings, a buddha, a Fortunate One. In this world with its gods, Māras, Brahmās, renunciants, and brahmins, from human beings to gods, I will [attain] understanding and awakening by myself and dwell having personally realized it—just as, in this world with its gods, Māras, Brahmās, renunciants and brahmins, from human beings to gods, the World-honored One has [attained] understanding and awakening by himself, and dwells having personally realized it. I will teach the Dharma that is sublime in the beginning, sub lime in the middle, and also sublime in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, revealing a holy life endowed with purity— just as the World-honored One now teaches the Dharma that is

sublime in the beginning, sublime in the middle, and also sublime in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, revealing a holy life endowed with purity. I will spread widely the holy life, revealing it widely to innu merable great assemblies, from human beings to gods—just as the World-honored One now spreads widely the holy life, revealing it well to innumerable great assemblies, from human beings to gods. I will have a community of countless hundreds and thousands of monks—just as the World-honored One now has a community of countless hundreds and thousands of monks. The Buddha also told Metteyya: Metteyya, in the distant future, when the human life span is eighty thou sand years, you will be a buddha called Metteyya Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a Well-gone One, a knower of the world, unsurpassable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and human beings, a buddha, a Fortunate One—just as I now am a Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awak ened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a Well-gone One, a knower of the world, unsurpassable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and human beings, a buddha, a Fortunate One. In this world with its gods, Māras, Brahmās, renunciants, and brah mins, from human beings to gods, you will [attain] understanding and awakening by yourself and dwell having personally realized it—just as, in this world with its gods, Māras, Brahmās, renunciants and brah mins, from human beings to gods, I have [attained] understanding and awakening by myself, and dwell having personally realized it. You will teach the Dharma that is sublime in the beginning, sublime in the middle, and also sublime in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, revealing a holy life endowed with purity—just as I now teach the Dharma that is sublime in the beginning, sublime in the mid dle, and also sublime in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, revealing a holy life endowed with purity. You will spread widely the holy life, revealing it widely to countless great assemblies, from human beings to gods—just as I now spread

widely the holy life, revealing it well to countless great assemblies, from human beings to gods. You will have a community of countless hundreds and thousands of monks—just as I now have a community of countless hundreds and thousands of monks. At that time, Venerable Ānanda was holding a fly whisk and attending on the Buddha. Then the World-honored One turned to him and said, “Ānanda, bring me the robes woven with golden thread. I now wish to present them to the monk Metteyya.” Then Venerable Ānanda, following the instruction of the World-honored One, brought the robes woven with golden thread and gave them to the World- honored One. Then, having received from Venerable Ānanda the robes woven with golden thread, the World-honored One said:

Metteyya, take these robes woven with golden thread from the Tathāgata and offer them to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community of monks. Why? Metteyya, all Tathāgatas, free from attachment and fully awakened, are the protectors of the world, seeking its prosperity, benefit, peace, and happiness. Then Venerable Metteyya, having taken the robes woven with golden thread from the Tathāgata, offered them to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community of monks. At that time, Māra the Bad had this thought: The renunciant Gotama, who is staying at Benares, in the Deer Park, the Place of Seers, is teaching his disciples the Dharma for the sake of the future. Let me go and hinder and confuse them. Then Māra the Bad approached the Buddha. Having arrived there, he recited a verse to the Buddha:

One will certainly attain The most wonderful appearance Wearing flower garlands and jade necklaces on one’s body And brilliant pearls on ones arms, If one stays in the town of Ketumatī, In the realm of King Saṅkha.

Thereupon the World-honored One thought: “This Māra the Bad has come here, wanting to hinder and confuse [my disciples].” Knowing [this], the World-honored One recited a verse to Māra the Bad: One will certainly attain [the state] Free of oppression, free of doubt and delusion, Eradicating birth, old age, disease, and death, [Attaining] freedom from the taints, completing what has to be done, If one practices the holy life In the realm of Metteyya. Then Māra the Bad again recited a verse: One will certainly obtain Fame and superior, excellent clothes Sandalwood [oil] to apply to the body, And an even, straight, beautiful, and slender body, If one stays in the town of Ketumatī, In the realm of King Saṅkha. Then, the World-honored One again recited a verse: One will certainly attain [the state] of Non-ownership and homelessness, Holding no golden treasures in his hands, Free from activity, with nothing to fear, If one practices the holy life In the realm of Metteyya. Then Māra the Bad again recited a verse: One will certainly obtain Fame, wealth, and fine food and drink. Knowing well how to sing and dance, [One] will make merry and constantly delight [in it]. If one stays in the town of Ketumatī, In the realm of King Saṅkha. Then, the World-honored One again recited a verse:

One will certainly cross to the other shore, As a bird breaks a net and escapes, And achieve absorption, abiding in it freely, Possessed of happiness, always joyful. Māra, you must know That I have overcome [you]. Then King Māra thought: “The World-honored One knows me. The Well-gone One has seen me.” Anxious, worried, aggrieved, and unable to remain there, he suddenly disappeared from that place. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, Metteyya, Ajita, the venerable Ānanda, and the [other] monks were delighted and remembered them well.
