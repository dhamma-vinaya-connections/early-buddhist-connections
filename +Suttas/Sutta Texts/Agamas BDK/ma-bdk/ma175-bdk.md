### 175. The Discourse on Ways of Practice (2)

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying among the Kurus, at a Kuru town called Kammāsadhamma. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: People in this world have a desire like this, a hope like this, a craving like this, a source of happiness like this, an expectation like this: “May states that are not enjoyable, not desirable, and not agreeable cease! May states that are enjoyable, desirable, and agreeable arise!” They have a desire like this, a hope like this, a craving like this, a source of happiness like this, an expectation like this. Yet, states that are not enjoyable, not desirable, and not agreeable arise, and states that are enjoyable, desirable, and agree- able cease. This is a state of delusion. My teaching is profound, difficult to see, difficult to awaken to, difficult to penetrate. In my teaching, which is profound, difficult to see, difficult to awaken to, difficult to penetrate, states that are not enjoyable, not desir- able, and not agreeable do cease, and states that are enjoyable, desirable, and agreeable do arise. This is a state of nondelusion.^408 In the world there are actually four ways of practice. What are the four? There is a way of practice that is pleasant now but results in future pain; there

is a way of practice that is painful now but results in future pleasure; there is a way of practice that is painful now and results in future pain; and there is a way of practice that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure.^409 What is the way of practice that is pleasant now but results in future pain? Suppose there is someone who is himself happy and joyful when he kills living beings, for whom killing living beings gives rise to happiness and joy. He is himself happy and joyful when he takes what is not given... commits sexual misconduct... speaks falsehood... up to... has wrong view, and for him having wrong view gives rise to happiness and joy. In these ways he has bodily pleasure and mental pleasure. [However,] unwhole someness follows him, unwholesomeness arises. He does not advance toward knowledge, does not advance toward awakening, does not advance toward nirvana.^410 This is the way of practice that is pleasant now but results in future pain. What is the way of practice that is painful now but results in future pleasure? Suppose there is someone who himself experiences pain and grief when he abstains from killing living beings, for whom abstaining from killing living beings gives rise to pain and grief. He himself experiences pain and grief when he abstains from taking what is not given... from sexual misconduct... from falsehood... up to... from wrong view, and for him abstaining from wrong view gives rise to pain and grief. In these ways he has bodily pain and mental pain. [However,] wholesomeness follows him, wholesomeness arises. He advances toward knowledge, advances toward awakening, advances toward nirvana. This is the way of practice that is painful now but results in future pleasure. What is the way of practice that is painful now and results in future pain? Suppose there is someone who himself experiences pain and grief when he kills living beings, for whom killing living beings gives rise to pain and grief. He himself experiences pain and grief when he takes what is not given... commits sexual misconduct... speaks falsehood... up to... has wrong view, and for him having wrong view gives rise to pain and grief. In these ways he has bodily pain and mental pain. Unwholesomeness follows him, unwholesomeness arises. He does not advance toward knowledge, does not advance toward awakening, does not advance toward nirvana. This is the way of practice that is painful now and results in future pain.

What is the way of practice that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure? Suppose there is someone who is himself happy and joyful when he abstains from killing living beings, for whom abstaining from killing living beings gives rise to happiness and joy. He is himself happy and joyful when he abstains from taking what is not given... from sexual misconduct... from falsehood... up to... from wrong view, and for him abstaining from wrong view gives rise to happiness and joy. In these ways he has bodily pleasure and mental pleasure. Wholesomeness follows him, wholesomeness arises. He advances toward knowledge, advances toward awakening, advances toward nirvana. This is the way of practice that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure. That there is a way of practice that is pleasant now but results in future pain, this the deluded one does not understand as it really is. Not under- standing as it really is that this way of practice is pleasant now but results in future pain, he cultivates it and does not refrain from it. Through his having cultivated it and not refrained from it, states that are not enjoyable, not desirable, and not agreeable arise, and states that are enjoyable, desir- able, and agreeable cease. It is just like a cupful of medicine that has an entirely attractive color, odor, and taste but is mixed with poison. Suppose a man swallows it because he is sick. At the time of being swallowed its attractive color, odor, and taste, make it palatable, and it does not afflict his throat; but when it has been swallowed and is in his stomach, it does not effect a cure.^411 Such is the way of practice that is pleasant now but results in future pain, which the deluded one does not understand as it really is. Not under- standing as it really is that this way of practice is pleasant now but results in future pain, he cultivates it and does not refrain from it. Through his having cultivated it and not refrained from it, states that are not enjoyable, not desirable, not agreeable arise, and states that are enjoyable, desirable, and agreeable cease. This is a state of delusion. That there is a way of practice that is painful now but results in future pleasure, this the deluded one does not understand as it really is. Not understanding as it really is that this way of practice is painful now but results in future pleasure, he does not cultivate it but refrains from it. Through his not having cultivated it and having refrained from it, states that are not

enjoyable, not desirable, and not agreeable arise, and states that are enjoyable, desirable, and agreeable cease. This is a state of delusion. That there is a way of practice that is painful now and results in future pain, this the deluded one does not understand as it really is. Not under standing as it really is that this way of practice is painful now and results in future pain, he cultivates and practices it and does not refrain from it. Through his having cultivated and practiced it and not refrained from it, states that are not enjoyable, not desirable, and not agreeable arise, and states that are enjoyable, desirable, and agreeable cease. It is just like feces and urine mixed with poison. Suppose a man swallows it [as medicine] because he is sick. At the time of being swallowed its bad color, stench, and foul taste make it unpalatable, and it afflicts his throat; and when it has been swallowed and is in his stomach, it does not effect a cure. Such is the way of practice that is painful now and results in future pain, which the deluded one does not understand as it really is. Not understanding as it really is that this way of practice is painful now and results in future pain, he cultivates and practices it and does not refrain from it.

Not understanding as it really is that this way of practice is pleasant now and results in future pleasure, he does not cultivate and practice it but refrains from it. Through his not having cultivated and practiced it but having refrained from it, states that are not enjoyable, not desirable, and not agree able arise, and states that are enjoyable, desirable, and agreeable cease. This is a state of delusion. He does not know as it really is what should be cultivated and practiced, and he does not know as it really is what should not be cultivated and prac ticed. Not knowing as it really is what should be cultivated and practiced, and not knowing as it really is what should not be cultivated and practiced, he cultivates what should not be cultivated and practiced, and he does not cultivate what should be cultivated and practiced. Through his cultivating what should not be cultivated and practiced, and not cultivating what should

be cultivated and practiced, states that are not enjoyable, not desirable, and not agreeable arise, and states that are enjoyable, desirable, and agree- able cease. This is a state of delusion. That there is a way of practice that is pleasant now but results in future pain, this the wise one understands as it really is. Understanding as it really is that this way of practice is pleasant now but results in future pain, he does not cultivate or practice it but refrains from it. Through his not having cultivated or practiced it but having refrained from it, states that are enjoyable, desirable, and agreeable arise, and states that are not enjoy- able, not desirable, and not agreeable cease.

It is just like feces and urine mixed with several types of medicine. Suppose a man swallows it because he is sick. At the time of being swallowed its bad color, stench, and foul taste make it unpalatable, and it afflicts his throat; but once it has been swallowed and is in his stomach, it effects a cure.

That there is a way of practice that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure, this the wise one understands as it really is. Understanding as it really is that this way of practice is pleasant now and results in future pleasure, he cultivates and practices it and does not refrain from it. Through his having cultivated and practiced it and not refrained from it, states that are enjoyable, desirable, and agreeable arise, and states that are not enjoy able, not desirable, and not agreeable cease. It is just like curd and honey mixed with several types of medicine. Suppose a man swallows it because he is sick. At the time of being swal lowed its attractive color, odor, and taste make it palatable, and it does not afflict his throat; and once it has been swallowed and is in his stomach, it effects a cure. Such is the way of practice that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure, which the wise one understands as it really is.

This is a state of wisdom. He knows as it really is what should be cultivated and practiced, and he knows as it really is what should not be cultivated and practiced. Know ing as it really is what should be cultivated and practiced, and knowing as it really is what should not be cultivated and practiced, he cultivates what should be cultivated and practiced and does not cultivate what should not be cultivated and practiced. Through his having cultivated what should be cultivated and practiced, and not having cultivated what should not be cultivated and practiced, states that are enjoyable, desirable, and agreeable arise, and states that are not enjoyable, not desirable, and not agreeable cease. This is a state of wisdom. It was because of this that I said, “In the world there are actually these four ways of practice.” Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
