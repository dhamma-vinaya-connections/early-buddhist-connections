### 90. The Discourse on Knowledge of the Dharma

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Park. At that time Venerable Cunda addressed the monks: Suppose that a monk makes this proclamation: “I know all the teachings and what can be known about the teaching, and I am free from covetousness”;^170 yet in that venerable one’s mind the evil of covetousness arises and remains. In the same way for disputatiousness,... anger,... ill-will,... uncommu nicativeness,... avarice,... envy,... deceit,... flattery,... lack of shame and scruples,... <evil> desires and evil views;^171 yet in that ven erable one’s mind evil desires and evil views arise and remain.^172

His companions in the holy life will know that venerable one as a person who does not know all the teachings and what can be known about the teach- ing, and who is not free from covetousness. Why is that? Because in that venerable one’s mind covetousness arises and remains. In the same way, disputatiousness,... anger,... ill-will,... uncommunicativeness,... avarice,... envy,... deceit,... flattery,... lack of shame and scruples,... and desires and evil views. Why is that? Because in that venerable one’s mind evil desires and evil views arise and remain. Venerable friends, he is like a person who is not wealthy but claims to be wealthy, has no fiefdom but claims to have a fiefdom, possesses no livestock but claims to possess livestock. When a time of need comes he has no gold, silver, pearls, beryl, crystal, or amber, no livestock, grain, or servants [of which he could make use]. His relatives and friends approach him and say, “You are in fact not wealthy but claim to be wealthy. You have no fiefdom but claim to have a fiefdom. You possess no livestock but claim to possess livestock. When a time of need comes you have no gold, silver, pearls, beryl, crystal, or amber, you have no livestock, grain, or servants [of which you could make use].”^173 In the same way, venerable friends, suppose that a monk makes this proclamation: “I know all the teachings and what can be known about the teaching, and I am free from covetousness”; yet in that venerable one’s mind the evil of covetousness arises and remains. In the same way, disputatiousness,... anger,... ill-will,... uncommunicativeness,... avarice,... envy,... deceit,... flattery,... lack of shame and scruples,... and desires and evil views; yet in that venerable one’s mind evil desires and evil views arise and remain. His companions in the holy life will know that venerable one as a person who does not know all the teachings and what can be known about the teaching, and who is not free from covetousness. Why is that? Because the mind of that venerable one does not tend toward the cessation of cov- etousness and toward remainderless nirvana. In the same way, disputatiousness,... anger,... ill-will,... uncom- municativeness,... avarice,... envy,... deceit,... flattery,... lack of shame and scruples,... and desires and evil views. Why is that?

Because the mind of that venerable one does not tend toward the cessation of evil views and toward remainderless nirvana. Venerable friends, suppose that a monk does not make this proclamation: “I know all the teachings and what can be known about the teaching, and I am free from covetousness”; yet in that venerable one’s mind the evil of covetousness does not arise and remain. In the same way, disputatiousness,... anger,... ill-will,... uncom municativeness,... avarice,... envy,... deceit,... flattery,... lack of shame and scruples,... and <evil> desires and evil views; yet in that ven erable one’s mind evil desires and evil views do not arise and remain. His companions in the holy life will know that venerable one as a person who really knows all the teachings and what can be known about the teach ing, and who is free from covetousness. Why is that? Because in that ven erable one’s mind covetousness does not arise and remain. In the same way, disputatiousness,... anger,... ill-will,... uncommunicativeness,... avarice,... envy,... deceit,... flattery,... lack of shame and scruples,... and <evil> desires and evil views. Why is that? Because in that venerable one’s mind evil desires and evil views do not arise and remain. Venerable friends, suppose a person is very wealthy but does not claim to be wealthy, has a fiefdom but does not claim to have a fiefdom, possesses livestock but does not claim to possess livestock. When a time of need comes he has gold, silver, pearls, beryl, crystal, amber, livestock, grain, and servants [of which he can make use]. His relatives and friends approach him and say, “You are in fact very wealthy but do not claim to be wealthy. You have a fiefdom but do not claim to have a fiefdom. You have livestock but do not claim to have live stock. When a time of need comes you have gold, silver, pearls, beryl, crystal, and amber, you have livestock, grain, and servants [of which you can make use].” In the same way, venerable friends, suppose a monk does not make this proclamation: “I know all the teachings and what can be known about the teaching, and I am free from covetousness,” and in that venerable one’s mind the evil of covetousness does not arise and remain. In the same way, disputatiousness,... anger,... ill-will,... uncommunica tiveness,... avarice,... envy,... deceit,... flattery,... lack of shame

and scruples,... desires and evil views; and in that venerable one’s mind evil desires and evil views do not arise and remain. His companions in the holy life will know that venerable one as a person who [really] knows all the teachings and what can be known about the teach- ing, and who is free from covetousness. Why is that? Because the mind of that venerable one tends toward the cessation of covetousness and toward remainderless nirvana. In the same way, disputatiousness,... anger,... ill- will,... uncommunicativeness,... avarice,... envy,... deceit,... flattery,... lack of shame and scruples,... and desires and evil views. Why is that? Because the mind of that venerable one tends toward the cessation of evil views and toward remainderless nirvana. Thus spoke Venerable Cunda. Having heard what Venerable Cunda said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
