### 35. The Discourse to the Asura

Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was staying at Verañjā, in the Yellow Reed Grove. At that time, when night was about to turn to dawn, Pahārāda, the _asura_ king, son of the _asura_ Malejā, of lofty appearance and radiant aura, approached the Buddha, bowed down at the World-honored One’s feet, and stood to one side. The World-honored One asked: Pahārāda, for the _asura_ s in the ocean, is there no decline in the life span of the _asura_ s, or in the appearance of the _asura_ s, the joy of the _asura_ s, or the strength of the _asura_ s? Do the _asura_ s delight in the ocean? Pahārāda, the _asura_ king, son of the _asura_ Malejā, replied: World-honored One, for us _asura_ s in the ocean there is no decline in the life span of the _asura_ s, or in the appearance of the _asura_ s, the joy of the _asura_ s, or the strength of the _asura_ s. We _asura_ s all delight in the ocean.

The World-honored One asked further, “Pahārāda, how many extraor- dinary qualities does the ocean possess that the _asura_ s delight in on seeing them?” Pahārāda replied: World-honored One, our ocean possesses eight extraordinary qualities that delight the _asura_ s. What are these eight qualities? World-honored One, from the bottom to the surface our ocean becomes gradually larger in circumference, evenly and uniformly increasing up to the shore; and its water is always full but never overflowing. World-hon- ored One, that from the bottom to the surface our ocean becomes grad- ually larger in circumference, evenly and uniformly increasing up to the shore; and that its water is always full but never overflowing— this is said to be the first extraordinary quality of our ocean, which delights the _asura_ s.

Again, World-honored One, our ocean’s tide is never out of time. World-honored One, that our ocean’s tide is never out of time—this is said to be the second extraordinary quality of our ocean, which delights the asura s. Again, World-honored One, the water of our ocean is very deep, bottomless, and extremely broad, boundless. World-honored One, that the water of our ocean is very deep, bottomless, and extremely broad, boundless—this is said to be the third extraordinary quality of our ocean, which delights the asura s. Again, World-honored One, the water of our ocean is salty, having everywhere the same taste. World-honored One, that the water of our ocean is salty, having everywhere the same taste—this is said to be the fourth extraordinary quality of our ocean, which delights the asura s. Again, World-honored One, our ocean abounds with treasures, countless precious things, and many varieties of exotic gems. It is full of precious materials such as gold, silver, crystal, beryl, precious stone, pearl, green jade, white jade, conch shell, coral, amber, agate, tortoise shell, ruby, and stone-bead. World-honored One, that our ocean abounds with treasures, count less precious things, varieties of exotic jewels, being full of precious materials, such as gold, silver, crystal, beryl, precious stone, pearl, green jade, white jade, conch shell, coral, amber, agate, tortoise shell, ruby, and stone-bead—this is said to be the fifth extraordinary quality of our ocean, which delights the asura s. Again, World-honored One, our ocean is the abode of mighty deities, such as asura s, gandhabba s, rakkhasa s, makara s, tortoises, crocodiles, vāruṇī serpents, [other, huge fishlike creatures such as] timi s, timingala s, and timitimingala s. Moreover, in the ocean dwell most wonderful and most remarkable beings with bodies as long as one hundred leagues, two hundred leagues, up to three hundred leagues, or even up to seven hundred leagues; crea tures [with such] bodies all live in the ocean. World-honored One, that our ocean is the abode of mighty deities, such as asura s, gandhabba s, rakkhasa s, makara s, tortoises, crocodiles, vāruṇī serpents, and [other, huge fishlike creatures such as] timi s, timin-

gala s, and timitimingala s; and that, moreover, there dwell in the ocean most wonderful and most remarkable beings with bodies as long as one hundred leagues, two hundred leagues, up to three hundred leagues, or even up to seven hundred leagues; that creatures [with such] bodies all live in the ocean—this is said to be the sixth extraordinary quality of our ocean, which delights the asura s. Again, World-honored One, our ocean is pure and does not accept corpses. If someone dies in the ocean, the body is blown by the wind and thrown up on the shore overnight. World-honored One, that our ocean is pure and does not accept corpses, and that if someone dies in the ocean, the body is blown by the wind and thrown up on the shore overnight—this is said to be the seventh extraordinary quality of our ocean, which delights the asura s. Again, World-honored One, there are five large rivers of Jambudīpa that enter our ocean, namely the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Sarabhū, the Aciravatī, and the Mahī. They all enter the great ocean, and once they have entered it, they forsake their original names and are all called “great ocean.” World-honored One, that there are five large rivers of Jambudīpa that enter our great ocean, namely the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Sarabhū, the Aciravatī, and the Mahī; and that they all enter the great ocean and, once they have entered it, forsake their original names and are all called “great ocean”—this is said to be the eighth extraordinary quality of our ocean, which delights the asura s. World-honored One, these are the eight extraordinary qualities of our great ocean, which delight the asura s. World-honored One, how many extraordinary qualities are there in the Buddha’s true teaching and discipline, having seen which the monks delight in it?

The World-honored One replied:

Pahārāda, there are likewise eight extraordinary qualities of my true teaching and discipline, having seen which the monks delight in it. What are the eight? Pahārāda, just as from the bottom to the surface the ocean becomes gradually greater in circumference, evenly and uni formly increasing up to the shore; and just as its water is always full

but never overflowing, similarly, Pahārāda, my true teaching and dis cipline is [to be] gradually practiced, gradually trained in, gradually completed, and gradually taught. Pahārāda, that my true teaching and discipline is [to be] gradually practiced, gradually trained in, gradually completed, and gradually taught—this is said to be the first extraordinary quality of my true teaching and discipline, having seen which the monks delight in it. Again, Pahārāda, just as the ocean’s tide is never out of time, sim ilarly, Pahārāda, in my true teaching and discipline, the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen will never, until the end of their lives, break the precepts, which I have established for these clansmen. Pahārāda, that in my true teaching and discipline, the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen will never, until the end of their lives, break the precepts, which I have established for these clansmen—this is said to be the second extraordinary quality of my true teaching and discipline, having seen which the monks delight in it. Again, Pahārāda, just as the water of the ocean is very deep, bot tomless, and extremely broad, boundless, similarly, Pahārāda, in my true teaching and discipline, the teachings are profound. They are pro found and bottomless, extremely broad and boundless. Pahārāda, that in my true teaching and discipline, the teachings are profound, that they are profound and bottomless, extremely broad and boundless—this is said to be the third extraordinary quality of my true teaching and discipline, having seen which the monks delight in it. Again, Pahārāda, just as the water of the ocean is salty, having everywhere the same taste, similarly, Pahārāda, my true teaching and discipline has the taste of dispassion, the taste of awakening, the taste of tranquility, as well as the taste of the path. Pahārāda, that my true teaching and discipline has the taste of dis passion, the taste of awakening, the taste of tranquility, as well as the taste of the path—this is said to be the fourth extraordinary quality of my true teaching and discipline, having seen which the monks delight in it. Again, Pahārāda, just as the ocean abounds with treasures, countless precious things, and many varieties of exotic gems, being full of pre cious materials, such as gold, silver, crystal, beryl, precious stone,

pearl, green jade, white jade, conch shell, coral, amber, agate, tortoise shell, ruby, and stone-beads, similarly, Pahārāda, my true teaching and discipline abounds with treasures, countless precious things, and many varieties of “exotic gems,” such as the four establishments of mind- fulness, the four right efforts, the four bases of supernormal power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven factors of awakening, and the eightfold noble path. Pahārāda, that my true teaching and discipline abounds with treas- ures, countless precious things, and many varieties of exotic gems such as the four establishments of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four bases of supernormal power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven factors of awakening, and the eightfold noble path—this is said to be the fifth extraordinary quality of my true teaching and dis- cipline, having seen which the monks delight in it. Again, Pahārāda, just as the ocean is the abode of mighty deities, namely _asura_ s, _gandhabba_ s, _rakkhasa_ s, _makara_ s, tortoises, crocodiles, _vāruṇī_ serpents, and [other, huge fishlike creatures such as] _timi_ s, _timin- gala_ s, and _timitimingala_ s; and just as in the ocean dwell most wonderful and most remarkable beings with bodies as long as one hundred leagues, two hundred leagues, up to three hundred leagues, or even up to seven hundred leagues, creatures [with such] bodies all living in the ocean, similarly, Pahārāda, in my true teaching and discipline there is the com- munity of nobles, of great spiritual beings all dwelling within it, namely arahants and those who are on the path to arahantship, non-returners and those who are on the path to non-returning, once-returners and those who are on the path to once-returning, and stream-enterers and those who are on the path to stream-entry. Pahārāda, that in my true teaching and discipline there is the com- munity of nobles, of great spiritual beings that all dwell within it, namely arahants and those who are on the path to arahantship, non- returners and those who are on the path to non-returning, once-returners and those who are on the path to once-returning, and stream-enterers and those who are on the path to stream-entry—this is said to be the sixth extraordinary quality of my true teaching and discipline, having seen which the monks delight in it.

Again, Pahārāda, just as the ocean is pure and does not accept corpses, and if someone dies in the ocean, the body is blown by the wind and thrown up on the shore overnight, similarly, Pahārāda, in my true teaching and discipline, the noble assembly is pure; it does not accept “corpses.” If there are those who are without vigor, wicked, fake celibates though professing to be celibates, fake renunciants though professing to be renunciants, then even though they may be in the midst of the community of nobles, they are far away from the community of nobles and the community of nobles is far away from them. Pahārāda, that in my true teaching and discipline, the community of nobles is pure and does not accept “corpses”; that if there are those who are without vigor, wicked, fake celibates though professing to be celibates, fake renunciants though professing to be renunciants, who, even though they may be in the midst of the community of nobles, are far away from the community of nobles and the community of nobles is far away from them— this is said to be the seventh extraordinary quality of my true teaching and discipline, having seen which the monks delight in it. Again, Pahārāda, just as there are five large rivers of Jambudīpa that enter the ocean, namely the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Sarabhū, the Aciravatī, and the Mahī, that all enter the great ocean and, having entered it, forsake their original names and are all [just] called “great ocean,” similarly, Pahārāda, in my true teaching and discipline, the khattiya clansmen who shave off hair and beards, don the yellow robe, leave home out of faith, and go forth to practice the path, these forsake their original names and are all called renunciants; [also the]... brah mins... householders... workers, who shave off hair and beards, don the yellow robe, leave home out of faith, and go forth to practice the path, these forsake their original names and are all called renunciants. Pahārāda, that in my true teaching and discipline, the khattiya clans men who shave off hair and beard, don the yellow robe, leave home out of faith, and go forth to practice the path, these forsake their original names and are all called renunciants; [also the]... brahmins... house holders... workers who shave off hair and beards, don the yellow robe, leave home out of faith, and go forth to practice the path, these

forsake their original names and are all called renunciants—this is said to be the eighth extraordinary quality of my true teaching and discipline, having seen which the monks delight in it. Pahārāda, these are the eight extraordinary qualities of my true teaching and discipline, which,having seen it, the monks delight in it. Pahārāda, what do you think? Between the eight extraordinary qualities of my true teaching and discipline and the eight extraordinary qualities of the ocean, of these two types of extraordinary qualities, which is superior, more excellent, more wonderful, which is supreme? Pahārāda replied: World-honored One, the eight extraordinary qualities of the ocean are inferior to the eight extraordinary qualities of the Tathāgata’s true teaching and discipline by a thousand or ten thousand times; they cannot be compared, likened, measured, or counted. The eight extraordinary qualities of the World-honored One’s true teaching and discipline are superior, more excellent, more won- derful, and supreme. World-honored One, I now take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community of monks. May the World- honored One accept me as a lay follower. From this day forth I take refuge until the end of my life. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, Pahā - rāda, the _asura_ king, together with the monks, was delighted and remembered them well.
