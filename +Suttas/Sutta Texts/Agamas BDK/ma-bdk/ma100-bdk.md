### 100. The [Second] Discourse on the Mass of Dukkha

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu, in Nigrodha Park. At that time Mahānāma the Sakyan, while walking about after midday, approached the Buddha. Having paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, stepped back, and sat to one side, he said: World-honored One, as I understand the teaching of the World-honored One, I must bring about the cessation of the three defilements in my mind: the defilement of mind by greed, the defilement of mind by hatred, and the defilement of mind by delusion. World-honored One, [although] I understand the teaching like this, yet states of greed, states of hatred, and states of delusion still arise in my mind. World-honored One, I am thinking: What condition have I not erad icated that still causes states of greed, states of hatred, and states of delusion to arise in my mind? The World-honored One said: Mahānāma, [within] you there is one condition that has not been eradicated, namely [that because of which] you remain a householder, instead of leav ing the household life out of faith and becoming a homeless one to practice the path. Mahānāma, if you had eradicated this one condition, you would

certainly not remain a householder but would certainly leave the household life out of faith and become a homeless one to practice the path. It is because this one condition has not been eradicated that you have remained a householder instead of leaving the household life out of faith and becom- ing a homeless one to practice the path. At this Mahānāma the Sakyan rose from his seat, arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder, extended his hands with palms joined toward the Buddha, and said to the World-honored One, “May the World-honored One teach me the Dharma, so that my mind may become purified, free itself of doubt, and attain the path!”^245 The World-honored One said:^246 Mahānāma, there are the five strands of sensual pleasure that are desirable, thought about, delighted in, connected with desire, and enjoyed by people. What are the five? They are visible forms known by the eye, sounds known by the ear, odors known by the nose, flavors known by the tongue, and tangibles known by the body. From these, kings and the retinue of kings gain pleasure and delight. Mahānāma, this is the foremost gratification in sensual pleasures. Nothing excels it, [yet] it is beset by much danger. Mahānāma, what is the danger in sensual pleasures? Mahānāma, a clansman may use whatever ability or skill he has to gain his livelihood, whether it is farming, trading, using scholarly knowledge, skill in account- ancy, knowledge of calculation, skill in carving seals, composing docu- ments, making pens, understanding sacred texts, serving as a brave general, or attending the king. When it is cold, he is [afflicted by] cold; when it is hot, he is [afflicted by] heat; he becomes hungry, thirsty, and tired, and is stung by mosquitoes and gadflies as he undertakes such work in his quest for wealth. Mahānāma, if that clansmen, making such efforts, engaged in such activity and such striving, does not obtain wealth, then he experiences sorrow and unhap- piness, he worries and grieves, is upset and vexed, and bewilderment arises in his mind. He says [to himself], “My undertakings are in vain, my suffering is in vain, my striving is unsuccessful!”

[However,] Mahānāma, if that clansman, making such effort, engaged in such activity and such striving, does obtain wealth, then he cherishes and values it, guarding it in a concealed storeroom. Why is that? [Because he thinks,] “May this wealth of mine not be taken away forcibly by kings, stolen by thieves, or burned in a fire; may it not rot or decay or become lost! May none of my money go out without [making a] profit, or be employed for any undertaking that fails!” [For these reasons] he guards [his wealth] thus in a concealed storeroom. If [his wealth] is taken away forcibly by kings, stolen by thieves, or burned in a fire; if it rots or decays or becomes lost, then sorrow and unhappiness arise. He worries and grieves, is upset and vexed, and bewil derment arises in his mind, and he says [to himself], “That which I long cherished is lost!” Like this, Mahānāma, is the mass of dukkha in the pres ent, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its con dition, and sensual pleasures as its source.^247 Again, Mahānāma, [among] living beings, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, a mother quarrels with her child, or a child quarrels with its mother, a father [quarrels with] his child... an elder brother with his younger brother,... an elder sister with her younger sister,... or relatives quarrel with one another. Having quarreled like this, a mother speaks badly of her child, a child speaks badly of its mother, a father [speaks badly] of his child... an elder brother of his younger brother,... an elder sister of her younger sister,... or relatives speak badly of one another, let alone other people.^248 This, Mahānāma, is what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the present, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. Again, Mahānāma, [among] living beings, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, kings quarrel with kings, brahmins quarrel with brahmins, house holders quarrel with householders, citizens quarrel with citizens, countries quarrel with countries. Because they quarrel and hate each other, they take up various kinds of weapons to harm each other, striking [each other] with their fists, or

hurling stones [at each other], or hitting [each other] with sticks, or cutting [each other] with swords. During the quarrel they may die or become ter- rified, experiencing extreme suffering. This, Mahānāma, is what is meant by a mass of _dukkha_ in the present, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. Again, Mahānāma, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleas- ures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, living beings put on armor and coats [of mail], take up lances or bows and arrows, or wield swords and shields, and go into battle. They fight on elephants, horses, or chariots, or as foot soldiers, or they fight as [ordinary] people.^249 During the battle they may die or become terrified, experiencing extreme suffering. This, Mahānāma, is what is meant by a mass of _dukkha_ in the present, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. Again, Mahānāma, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleas- ures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, living beings put on armor and coats [of mail], take up lances or bows and arrows, or wield swords and shields, and [set out to] conquer another country. They besiege a city and destroy its fortifications, lining up in battle array to the beating of drums, the blowing of horns, and loud shouting. They strike with hammers, or they use spears and halberds, or they use cutting wheels, or they shoot arrows, or they hurl down rocks, or they use great catapults, or they pour down molten copper pellets. During the battle they may die or become terrified, experiencing extreme suffering. This, Mahānāma, is what is meant by a mass of _dukkha_ in the present, which has sensual pleas- ures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. Again, Mahānāma, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleas- ures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, living beings put on armor and coats [of mail], take up a lance or a bow and arrows, or wield a sword and a shield, and advance into a village, a town, a country, or a city. They break through walls and open up storerooms to steal prop- erty. They interrupt the king’s highway or reach out to other streets. They destroy villages, damage towns, wipe out countries, and break up cities.

In the process they may be caught by the king’s men, who subject them to various punishments, such as cutting off their hands, feet, or both hands and feet; cutting off their ears, nose, or both ears and nose; or slicing strips [of flesh] off them, or tearing out their beards or hair, or tearing out both beards and hair, or putting them in a cage and setting fire to their clothing, or wrapping them in straw and setting fire to it; or placing them in the belly of an “iron donkey” or in the mouth of an “iron pig” or in the mouth of an “iron tiger” and then heating it up, or putting them into a copper or iron cauldron and boiling them; or cutting them into pieces, or stabbing them with sharp forks, or hooking them with iron hooks, or laying them down on an iron bed and scalding them with boiling oil, or seating them in an iron mortar and pounding them with an iron pestle, or letting them be bitten by snakes or serpents, or whipping them with whips, beating them with sticks, or hitting them with clubs, or impaling them alive on a tall post, or decapitating them. In the process they will die or become terrified, experiencing extreme suffering. This, Mahānāma, is what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the present, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. Again, Mahānāma, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleas ures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, living beings do evil bodily, verbal, and mental deeds. At a later time they are afflicted by disease and lie on a bed, or sit or lie on the ground, with pain oppressing their body, experiencing extremely severe pain that is not at all desirable. At the time of death their evil bodily, verbal, and mental deeds manifest before them and envelop them. Just as when at sunset, the shadow of a great mountain peak envelops the earth, in the same way their evil bodily, verbal, and mental deeds manifest before them and envelop them.^250 They think: “Formerly I did evil deeds, which are [now] manifesting before me and enveloping me. Formerly I did not perform meritorious acts; I performed many evil acts. If there is a place where people are reborn who do what is evil, bad, and harmful, who only commit crimes, who make no merit and do no good deeds, who are without fear [of the con sequences], without reliance, without a refuge—then I will certainly be reborn there.”

From this they feel regret, and being regretful they have an unwholesome death and their life ends without merit. This, Mahānāma, is what is meant by a mass of _dukkha_ in the present, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. Again, Mahānāma, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleas- ures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, living beings do evil bodily, verbal, and mental deeds. Because of those evil bodily, verbal, and mental deeds, with this as the cause, with this as the condition, on the breaking up of the body at death they will certainly go to a bad realm and are reborn in hell. This, Mahānāma, is what is meant by a mass of _dukkha_ in the next life that has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. Mahānāma, for this reason it should be understood that there is no hap- piness at all in sensual pleasures; [there is only] immeasurable suffering and misery. [If] a learned noble disciple does not see this as it really is, then he is enveloped by sensual pleasures and will not attain the happiness of relinquishment and unsurpassable peace. Mahānāma, in this way a learned noble disciple regresses because of sen- sual pleasures. Mahānāma, I know that there is no happiness in sensual pleas- ures, but only immeasurable misery. Knowing this as it really is, Mahānāma, I am not enveloped by sensual pleasures and not overcome by what is evil, and so I attain the happiness of relinquishment and unsurpassable peace. Mahānāma, for this reason I do not regress because of sensual pleasures.^251 Mahānāma, once I was dwelling near Rājagaha, on Mount Vebhāra in the Sattapaṇṇi Cave [frequented by] seers.^252 Mahānāma, in the late afternoon, having risen from sitting in meditation, I approached the mountainside. There I saw many Nigaṇṭhas engaged in the practice of not sitting down, standing continuously without sitting down, experiencing extremely severe pain. I approached them and asked, “Nigaṇṭhas, for what reason do you engage in this practice of not sitting down, standing continuously without sitting down, experiencing pain like this?” They said, “Gotama, we have a teacher, a Nigaṇṭha called Nātaputta, who teaches us, saying,^253 ‘Nigaṇṭhas, any unwholesome karma done in your former lives will certainly be eradicated through these ascetic practices.

If you now maintain good bodily verbal, and mental conduct, then because of that you will perform no further evil and unwholesome karma.’” Mahānāma, I questioned them further, “Nigaṇṭhas, do you have faith in your teacher and are you free of doubt?”^254 They replied, “Yes indeed, Gotama. We have faith in our teacher and are free of doubt.” Mahānāma, I questioned them further, “Nigaṇṭhas, if this is the case, then [does this mean that] in a former life you and your Nigaṇṭha teacher repeatedly performed evil and unwholesome deeds,^255 and having formerly performed [such deeds] you Nigaṇṭhas, on passing away and being reborn now in the human realm, went forth as Nigaṇṭhas to engage in the practice of not sitting down, standing continuously without sitting down, experi encing pain like this, just as you and your disciples are doing?” They replied, “Gotama, happiness is attained not through happiness but through pain. The happiness experienced by the renunciant Gotama cannot match that of King Bimbisāra.” I said further, “You are confused. What you say lacks meaning. Why is that? Unskilled, lacking in understanding, and not knowing the right time, you have made this statement:^256 ‘The happiness experienced by the renunciant Gotama cannot match that of King Bimbisāra.’ Nigaṇṭhas, you should have first asked, ‘Who [experiences] the higher happiness, King Bimbisāra or the renunciant Gotama?’ Nigaṇṭhas, I would have answered like this, ‘I [experience] the higher happiness; King Bimbisāra cannot match it.’ However, Nigaṇṭhas, you stated that ‘The happiness experienced by the renunciant Gotama cannot match that of King Bimbisāra.’” Then the Nigaṇṭhas said, “Gotama, we now ask the renunciant Gotama: Who [experiences] the higher happiness, King Bimbisāra or the renunciant Gotama?” I replied further, “Nigaṇṭhas, I shall now ask you a question. Answer according to your understanding. Nigaṇṭhas, what do you think? Can King Bimbisāra, according to his wish, remain in silence, not speaking a word, and thereby obtain joy and happiness for seven days and seven nights?” The Nigaṇṭhas answered, “No, Gotama.” [I asked further, “Can he, according to his wish, remain in silence, not speaking a word, and thereby] obtain joy and happiness for six days,...

five,... four,... three,... two days,... or one day and one night?” The Nigaṇṭhas answered, “No, Gotama.” I again asked, “Nigaṇṭhas, can I, according to my wish, remain in silence, not speaking a word, and thereby obtain joy and happiness for one day and one night?”^257 The Nigaṇṭhas answered, “Yes indeed, Gotama.” [I again asked, “Can I, according to my wish, remain in silence, not speak- ing a word, and thereby] obtain joy and happiness for two,... three,... four,... five,... six,... or seven days and seven nights?” The Nigaṇṭhas answered, “Yes indeed, Gotama.” I again asked, “Nigaṇṭhas, what do you think, who [experiences] the higher happiness, King Bimbisāra or myself?” The Nigaṇṭhas answered, “Gotama, as we receive and understand what the renunciant Gotama has said, Gotama [experiences] the higher happiness; King Bimbisāra cannot match it.”^258 Mahānāma, for this reason know that there is no happiness in sensual pleasures; there is only immeasurable suffering and misery. [If] a learned noble disciple does not see this as it really is, then he is enveloped by sen- sual pleasures, entangled in what is evil and unwholesome, and will not attain the happiness of relinquishment and unsurpassable peace. Mahānāma, in this way a learned noble disciple regresses on account of sensual pleasures. Mahānāma, I know that there is no happiness in sen- sual pleasures; there is only immeasurable suffering and misery. Knowing this as it really is, I am not enveloped by sensual pleasures, not entangled by evil and unwholesome states, and thus attain the happiness of relin- quishment and unsurpassable peace. Mahānāma, for this reason I do not regress on account of sensual pleasures. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, Mahānāma the Sakyan and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
