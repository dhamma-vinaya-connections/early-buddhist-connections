### 2. The Discourse on the Coral tree

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: When the leaves of the coral tree of the thirty-three gods become with ered, the thirty-three gods are happy and rejoice, [saying]: “The leaves of the coral tree will soon fall!” Again, when the leaves of the coral tree of the thirty-three gods have fallen, the thirty-three gods are happy and rejoice: “The [new] leaves of the coral tree will soon appear!” Again, when the [new] leaves of the coral tree of the thirty-three gods have appeared, the thirty-three gods are happy and rejoice: “The coral tree will soon grow buds!”^46 Again, when the coral tree of the thirty three gods has grown buds, the thirty-three gods are happy and rejoice: “The [buds of the] coral tree will soon resemble a bird’s beak!” Again, when the [buds of the] coral tree of the thirty-three gods resemble a bird’s beak, the thirty-three gods are happy and rejoice: “The [buds of the] coral tree will soon open up and resemble bowls!” Again, [when the buds of] the coral tree of the thirty-three gods have opened up and resemble bowls, the thirty-three gods are happy and rejoice: “The coral tree will soon be in full bloom!” When the coral tree is in full bloom, the radiance it emits, the color it reflects, and the fragrance it emits spread a hundred leagues around. Then, for the four months of the summer season the thirty-three gods amuse themselves equipped with the five types of divine sense pleasure. This is [how] the thirty-three gods assemble and amuse themselves beneath their coral tree.

It is just the same with the noble disciple. When thinking of leaving the household life, the noble disciple is reckoned as having withered leaves, like the withered leaves of the coral tree of the thirty-three gods. Again, the noble disciple shaves off [his] hair and beard, dons the yellow robe, and, out of faith, leaves the household life, becomes home- less, and practices the path. At this time the noble disciple is reckoned as one whose leaves have fallen, like the falling of the leaves of the coral tree of the thirty-three gods. Again, the noble disciple, separated from desires, separated from evil and unwholesome states, with initial and sustained application of the mind, with joy and happiness born of separation, dwells having attained the first absorption. At this time the noble disciple is reckoned as one whose new leaves have appeared, like the appearing of the new leaves on the coral tree of the thirty-three gods. Again, the noble disciple, through the calming of initial and sus- tained application of the mind, with inward stillness and mental one- pointedness, without initial and sustained application of the mind, with joy and happiness born of concentration, dwells having attained the second absorption. At this time the noble disciple is reckoned to have grown buds, like the growing of the buds on the coral tree of the thirty- three gods. Again, the noble disciple, separated from joy and desire, dwelling in equanimity and not seeking anything, with right mindfulness and right attentiveness, experiencing pleasure with the body, dwells having attained the third absorption, which the noble ones speak of as noble equanimity and mindfulness, a happy abode.^47 At this time the noble disciple is reckoned to have grown [buds] resembling a bird’s beak, like the [buds] resembling a bird’s beak on the coral tree of the thirty- three gods. Again, the noble disciple, with the cessation of pleasure and pain, and with the earlier cessation of joy and displeasure, with neither-pain- nor-pleasure, equanimity, mindfulness, and purity, dwells having attained the fourth absorption. At this time the noble disciple is reckoned to have grown [buds] resembling bowls, like the [buds] resembling bowls on the coral tree of the thirty-three gods.

Again, the noble disciple destroys the taints, [attains] liberation of the mind, and liberation through wisdom, and in this very life, per sonally attains understanding and awakening, and dwells having per sonally realized. He knows as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence.” At this time the noble disciple is reckoned to be in full bloom, like the full blooming of the coral tree of the thirty-three gods. This monk is one whose taints are destroyed, an arahant. The thirty-three gods assemble in the Hall of the True Dharma and, sighing in admiration, praise him: Venerable disciple So-and-so, from such-and-such a village or town, having shaved off [his] hair and beard, donned the yellow robe, and having left the household life out of faith to become a homeless one, having practiced the path, he has destroyed the taints. He has [attained] liberation of the mind and liberation through wisdom, and in this very life [he has] personally attained under standing and awakening, and dwells having personally realized. He knows as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence.” This is [how] an arahant, with taints destroyed, joins the community [of liberated ones], like the assembling of the thirty-three gods beneath their coral tree. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
