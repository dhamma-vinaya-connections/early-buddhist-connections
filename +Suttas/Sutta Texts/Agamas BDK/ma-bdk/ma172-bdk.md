### 172. The Discourse on the Mind Division

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time there was a monk who, while sitting in meditation in peaceful seclusion, had this thought in his mind: “By what are [people of] the world led? By what are they defiled and attached? By the arising of what are they controlled?”^392 Then, in the afternoon, the monk rose from his seated medi- tation and approached the Buddha. Having paid homage with his head at [the Buddha’s] feet, he stepped back and sat to one side. He said:

World-honored One, just now, while sitting in meditation in peaceful seclusion, I had this thought in my mind, “By what are [people of] the world led? By what are they defiled and attached? By the arising of what are they controlled?” On hearing this, the World-honored One praised him, saying: It is well, monk, it is well, namely that, having a skillful approach, skillful contemplation, and superb eloquence, you have the proper reflection: “By what are [people of] the world led? By what are they defiled and attached? By the arising of what are they controlled?” Monk, is this what you are asking? The monk replied, “That is so, World-honored One.” The World-honored One said: Monk, by the mind [people of] the world are led, by the mind they are defiled and attached, by the arising of the mind they are controlled. By that [people of] the world are led, by that they are defiled and attached, by the arising of that they are controlled.

Monk, the learned noble disciple is not led by the mind, he is not defiled and attached by the mind, he is not controlled by the mind. Monk, the learned noble disciple does not follow the mind’s control; rather, the mind follows the learned noble disciple.^393 The monk said, “It is well, World-honored One, it is well indeed!” Then, having heard what the Buddha said, the monk was delighted and received it respectfully. He asked: World-honored One, “a learned monk”; one speaks of “a learned monk.” World-honored One, what makes a monk learned? How does one designate a monk as “learned”? On hearing this, the World-honored One praised him, saying: It is well, monk, it is well, namely that, having a skillful approach, skillful contemplation, and superb eloquence, you have the proper reflection: “World-honored One, ‘a learned monk’; one speaks of ‘a learned monk.’ World-honored One, what makes a monk learned? Whom does one des ignate as ‘a learned monk’?” Monk, is this what you are asking? The monk replied, “That is so, World-honored One.” The World-honored One said: Monk, I have taught a great many things, namely: discourses ( sutta ), stan zas ( geyya ), expositions ( veyyākaraṇa ), verses ( gāthā ), causes ( nidāna ), inspired utterances ( udāna ), heroic tales ( apadāna ), [what has been] “thus said” ( itivuttaka ), birth stories ( jātaka ), answers to questions ( vedalla ), marvels ( abbhutadhamma ), and explanations of meaning ( upadesa ).^394 Monk, if a son of good family, on being taught by me [just] a four-line verse, comes to know its meaning, comes to know the Dharma, progresses in the Dharma, moves toward the Dharma, progresses in the holy life, then, monk, what one speaks of as “a learned monk” is nothing more than this. Monk, such is a learned monk. Such a one the Tathāgata designates as a learned monk. The monk said, “It is well, World-honored One, it is well indeed!” Then, having heard what the Buddha said, the monk was delighted and received it respectfully. He asked:

World-honored One, “a learned monk with penetrative wisdom”; one speaks of “a learned monk with penetrative wisdom.” World-honored One, what makes a monk learned with penetrative wisdom? Whom does one designate as “a learned monk with penetrative wisdom”? On hearing this, the World-honored One praised him, saying: It is well, monk, it is well, namely that, having a skillful approach, skillful contemplation, and superb eloquence, you have the proper reflection: “World-honored One, ‘a learned monk with penetrative wisdom’; one speaks of ‘a learned monk with penetrative wisdom.’ World-honored One, what makes a monk learned with penetrative wisdom? Whom does one designate as ‘a learned monk with penetrative wisdom’?” Monk, is this what you are asking? The monk replied, “That is so, World-honored One.” The World-honored One said: Monk, if a monk hears: “This is _dukkha,_ ” and with wisdom rightly sees _dukkha_ as it really is; if he hears of the arising of _dukkha_... of the cessation of _dukkha_... of the path to the cessation of _dukkha,_ and with wisdom rightly sees the path to the cessation of _dukkha_ as it really is, then, monk, such is “a learned monk with penetrative wisdom.” This is what the Tathā- gata designates as “a learned monk with penetrative wisdom.” The monk said, “It is well, World-honored One, it is well indeed!” Then, having heard what the Buddha said, the monk was delighted and received it respectfully. He asked:

World-honored One, “an intelligent monk, clever, and with vast wisdom”; one speaks of “an intelligent monk, clever, and with vast wisdom.” World honored One, what makes a monk intelligent, clever, and with vast wis dom? Whom does one designate as “an intelligent monk, clever, and with vast wisdom”? On hearing this, the World-honored One praised him, saying: It is well, monk, it is well, namely that, having a skillful approach, skillful contemplation, and superb eloquence, you have the proper reflection: [“World-honored One, ‘an intelligent monk, clever, and with vast wisdom’;

one speaks of ‘an intelligent monk, clever, and with vast wisdom.’] World- honored One, what makes a monk intelligent, clever, and with vast wis- dom? Whom does one designate as ‘an intelligent monk, clever, and with vast wisdom’?” Monk, is this what you are asking? The monk replied, “That is so, World-honored One.” The World-honored One said: If a monk does not think of harming himself, does not think of harming others, does not think of harming both; [if] instead a monk thinks of ben- efiting himself and others, benefiting many, with empathy for the world, seeking what is meaningful and of benefit for _deva_ s and human beings, seeking their ease and happiness; then monk, such is “an intelligent monk, clever, and with vast wisdom.” Such a one the Tathāgata designates as an intelligent monk, clever, and with vast wisdom.^395 The monk said, “It is well, World-honored One, it is well indeed!” Then the monk, having heard what the Buddha said, received it well, retained it well, and recited it well. He rose from his seat, paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and returned. Then the monk, having heard the World-honored One’s teaching, went and dwelled alone in a secluded place and practiced diligently, with his mind free of negligence. Having dwelled alone in a secluded place and practiced diligently, with his mind free of negligence, being a son of a good family who had shaved off hair and beard, donned the yellow robe, left home out of faith, and gone forth to practice the path, he attained fully the summit of the holy life. He dwelled having personally attained understanding, awakening, and realization here and now. He knew as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, there will not be another experiencing of existence.” That venerable one, having come to know the Dharma... up to... became an arahant. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
