### 151. The Discourse to Assalāyana

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time many brahmins from Kosala had gathered in their study hall and were discussing this matter: The brahmin caste is the highest; the others are not equal to it. The brahmin caste is white; all the others are black. The brahmins achieve purity; non brahmins do not achieve purity. Brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth. The brahmins were created by Brahmā. Yet the renunciant Gotama says that all four castes are able to achieve purity, declaring it and proclaiming it.^173 They thought: Friends, who has the power and ability to approach the renunciant Gotama and defeat him in debate in relation to this matter, in accordance with the Dharma? They further thought: The young brahmin Assalāyana is born of parents of pure descent. For seven generations on both his father’s and mother’s sides there has been uninterrupted continuity of births without blemish. He has learned much, has retained it, and is able to recite it. He is a master of the four Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth.^174 The young brahmin Assalāyana has the power and ability to approach the renunciant Gotama and defeat him in debate in relation to this matter, in accordance with the Dharma. Friends, we could together approach the young brahmin Assalāyana and tell him about this matter. According to what the young brahmin Assalāyana says, we will accept it. Then the many brahmins from Kosala approached the young brahmin Assalāyana. Having exchanged polite greetings with him, they stepped back, sat to one side, and said: Young brahmin, we many brahmins from Kosala had gathered in the study hall and were discussing this matter: “The brahmin caste is the highest; the others are not equal to it. The brahmin caste is white; all of the others are black. The brahmins achieve purity; nonbrahmins do not achieve

purity. Brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth. The brah- mins were created by Brahmā. Yet the renunciant Gotama says that all four castes are able to achieve purity, declaring it and proclaiming it.” We thought, “Friends, who has the power and ability to approach the renunciant Gotama and defeat him in debate in relation to this matter, in accordance with the Dharma?” We further thought, “The young brahmin Assalāyana is born of parents of pure descent. For seven generations on both his father’s and mother’s sides there has been uninterrupted continuity of births without blemish. He has learned much, has retained it, and is able to recite it. He is a master of the four Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth. The young brahmin Assalāyana has the power and ability to approach the renunciant Gotama and defeat him in debate in relation to this matter in accordance with the Dharma.” Let the young brahmin Assalāyana approach the renunciant Gotama and defeat him in debate in relation to this matter, in accordance with the Dharma!

The young brahmin Assalāyana said to the brahmins:

Friends, the renunciant Gotama teaches the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma. If someone teaches the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma, it is not possible to defeat them in debate.

The many Kosalan brahmins said:

Young brahmin, you have not yet been defeated [in debate]. You should not surrender in advance. Why is that? The young brahmin Assalāyana is born of parents of pure descent. For seven generations on both his father’s and mother’s sides there has been uninterrupted continuity of births without blemish. He has learned much, has retained it, and is able to recite it. He is a master of the four Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth. The young brahmin Assalāyana has the power and ability to approach the renunciant Gotama and defeat him in debate in relation to this matter, in accordance with the Dharma. Let the young brahmin Assalāyana approach the renunciant Gotama and

defeat him in debate in relation to this matter, in accordance with the Dharma! The young brahmin Assalāyana accepted [the suggestion] of the many Kosalan brahmins by remaining silent.^175 Then the young brahmin Assalāyana, together with those many Kosalan brahmins, approached the Buddha. Having exchanged polite greetings, he stepped back, sat to one side, and said, “Gotama, I would like to ask a question. Will you listen to my question?” The World-honored One said, “Young brahmin, you can feel free to ask.” Then the young brahmin Assalāyana asked, saying: Gotama, the brahmins speak like this, “The brahmin caste is the highest; the others are not equal to it. The brahmin caste is white; all of the others are black. The brahmins achieve purity; nonbrahmins do not achieve purity. Brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth. The brah- mins were created by Brahmā.” I do not know what the renunciant Gotama will say about this. The World-honored One said: I will now ask you something. Answer according to your understanding.^176 Young brahmin, have you heard that in the countries of Yona and Kamboja there are two castes, masters and slaves, and that the masters [can] become slaves and the slaves [can] become masters? The young brahmin Assalāyana replied: Gotama, I have heard that in the countries of Yona and Kamboja there are two castes, masters and slaves, and that the masters [can] become slaves and the slaves [can] become masters. [The World-honored One said:] In the same way, young brahmin, if brahmins progress rightly, they will become well liberated and know for themselves, according to the Dharma; and if warriors, merchants, or workers progress rightly, they will become well liberated and know for themselves, according to the Dharma.^177

The young brahmin Assalāyana said:

Gotama, it is wonderful, it is remarkable, how promptly you have come out with this simile.^178 Yet the brahmins speak like this, “The brahmin caste is the highest; the others are not equal to it. The brahmin caste is white; all of the others are black. The brahmins achieve purity; nonbrahmins do not achieve purity. Brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth. The brahmins were created by Brahmā.”

The World-honored One asked:

Young brahmin, what do you think? Are only brahmins not affected by empty space, not bound by it, not touched by it, not obstructed by it— unlike warriors, merchants, and workers?^179

The young brahmin Assalāyana replied:

Gotama, brahmins are not affected by empty space, not bound by it, not touched by it, not obstructed by it, and for warriors, merchants, and workers it is the same.

[The World-honored One said:]

In the same way, young brahmin, if brahmins progress rightly, they will become well liberated and know for themselves, according to the Dharma; and if warriors, merchants, or workers progress rightly, they will become well liberated and know for themselves, according to the Dharma.

The young brahmin Assalāyana said:

Gotama, it is wonderful, it is remarkable, how promptly you have come out with this simile. Yet the brahmins speak like this, “The brahmin caste is the highest; the others are not equal to it. The brahmin caste is white; all of the others are black. The brahmins achieve purity; nonbrahmins do not achieve purity. Brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth. The brahmins were created by Brahmā.”

The World-honored One asked:

Young brahmin, what do you think?^180 Is it only brahmins who are able

to dwell with a mind of loving-kindness, without fetters, without resent ment, without ill will, without contention—unlike warriors, merchants, and workers? The young brahmin Assalāyana replied: Gotama, brahmins are able to dwell with a mind of loving-kindness, with out fetters, without resentment, without ill will, without contention, and for warriors, merchants, and workers it is the same. [The World-honored One said:] In the same way, young brahmin, if brahmins progress rightly, they will become well liberated and know for themselves, according to the Dharma; and if warriors, merchants, or workers progress rightly, they will become well liberated and know for themselves, according to the Dharma. The young brahmin Assalāyana said: Gotama, it is wonderful, it is remarkable, how promptly you have come out with this simile. Yet the brahmins speak like this, “The brahmin caste is the highest; the others are not equal to it. The brahmin caste is white; all of the others are black. The brahmins achieve purity; nonbrahmins do not achieve purity. Brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth. The brahmins were created by Brahmā.” The World-honored One asked: Young brahmin, what do you think? Suppose that one hundred types of people were to come by and someone were to tell them, “Come, all of you. Only those of you who are born in the warrior caste or the brahmin caste are able, by taking soap powder and going to bathe in the water, to get rid of your dirt and to become fully clean.” Young brahmin, what do you think? Are [only] those from the warrior caste or the brahmin caste able, by taking soap powder and going to bathe in the water, to get rid of their dirt and to become fully clean? Are those from the merchant caste or the worker caste not able, by taking soap powder and going to bathe in the water, to get rid of their dirt and to become fully clean? [Or] are all one hundred types of people able, by

taking soap powder and going to bathe in the water, to get rid of their dirt and to become fully clean?^181

The young brahmin Assalāyana replied:

Gotama, all one hundred types of people are able, by taking soap powder and going to bathe in the water, to get rid of their dirt and to become fully clean.

[The World-honored One said:]

In the same way, young brahmin, if brahmins progress rightly, they will become well liberated and know for themselves, according to the Dharma; and if warriors, merchants, or workers progress rightly, they will become well liberated and know for themselves, according to the Dharma.

The young brahmin Assalāyana said:

Gotama, it is wonderful, it is remarkable, how promptly you have come out with this simile. Yet the brahmins speak like this, “The brahmin caste is the highest; the others are not equal to it. The brahmin caste is white; all of the others are black. The brahmins achieve purity; nonbrahmins do not achieve purity. Brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth. The brahmins were created by Brahmā.”

The World-honored One asked:

Young brahmin, what do you think? Suppose that one hundred types of people were to come by and someone were to tell them, “Come, all of you. Only those of you who are born in the warrior caste or the brahmin caste are able, by using totally dry _sāla_ wood and sandalwood as a fire base and drilling it with a drill, to produce fire and to make it grow.” Young brahmin, what do you think? Is it that [only] those from the warrior caste or the brahmin caste would be able, by using totally dry _sāla_ wood and sandalwood as a fire base and drilling it with a drill, to produce fire and to make it grow? Is it that those from the merchant caste or the worker caste [would be unable], by using a dried-out pig trough or dog trough, or castor oil wood, or some other inferior wood as a fire base, and drilling it with a drill, to produce fire and to make it grow? [Or] is it that

all one hundred types of people would be able, by using various kinds of wood as a fire base and drilling it with a drill, to produce fire and to make it grow? The young brahmin Assalāyana replied: Gotama, all of those one hundred types of people would be able, by using various kinds of wood as a fire base and drilling it with a drill, to produce fire and to make it grow. [The World-honored One said]: In the same way, young brahmin, if brahmins progress rightly, they will become well liberated and know for themselves, according to the Dharma; and if warriors, merchants, or workers progress rightly, they will become well liberated and know for themselves, according to the Dharma. The young brahmin Assalāyana said: Gotama, it is wonderful, it is remarkable, how promptly you have come out with this simile. Yet the brahmins speak like this, “The brahmin caste is the highest; the others are not equal to it. The brahmin caste is white; all of the others are black. The brahmins achieve purity; nonbrahmins do not achieve purity. Brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth. The brahmins were created by Brahmā.” The World-honored One asked: Young brahmin, what do you think? If all of those one hundred types of people, using various kinds of wood as a fire base and drilling it with a drill, were to produce fire and to make it grow, then would all of those fires have flames, color, heat, and light, and would they all be capable of fulfilling the functions of fire? [Or] is it that only some of the fires would have flames, color, heat, and light, and be capable of fulfilling the functions of fire? Is it that some of the fires would have no flames, no color, no heat, no light, and would not be capable of fulfilling the functions of fire? [Or] is it that all the fires would have flames, color, heat, light, and that they would all be capable of fulfilling the functions of fire?

The young brahmin Assalāyana replied:

Gotama, if all of those one hundred types of people, by using various kinds of wood as a fire base and drilling it with a drill, were to produce fire and to make it grow, then all of the fires would have flames, color, heat, light, and all of them would be capable of fulfilling the functions of fire. That only some fires would have flames, color, heat, light, and be capable of fulfilling the functions of fire—that is not possible. That only some fires would have no flames, no color, no heat, no light, and would not be capable of fulfilling the functions of fire—that too is not possible. Gotama, all those fires would have flames, color, heat, and light, and all of them would be capable of fulfilling the functions of fire.

[The World-honored One said:]

In the same way, young brahmin, if brahmins progress rightly, they will become well liberated and know for themselves, according to the Dharma; and if warriors, merchants, or workers progress rightly, they will become well liberated and know for themselves, according to the Dharma.

The young brahmin Assalāyana said:

Gotama, it is wonderful, it is remarkable, how promptly you have come out with this simile. Yet the brahmins speak like this, “The brahmin caste is the highest; the others are not equal to it. The brahmin caste is white; all of the others are black. The brahmins achieve purity; nonbrahmins do not achieve purity. Brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth. The brahmins were created by Brahmā.”

The World-honored One said:

Young brahmin, one is reckoned according to where this body is born. If one is born in a brahmin clan, one is reckoned to be of the brahmin clan. If one is born in a warrior... merchant... worker clan, one is reckoned to be of the worker clan. Young brahmin, it is just as a fire is reckoned according to what gives rise to it. If it arises in dependence on twigs, it is reckoned to be a “twig fire”; if it arises in dependence on grass... on dung... on firewood, it

is reckoned to be a “firewood fire.” In the same way, young brahmin, one is reckoned according to where this body is born. If one is born in a brah min clan, one is reckoned to be of the brahmin clan, if one is born in a warrior... merchant... worker clan, one is reckoned to be of the worker clan.^182 The World-honored One asked: Young brahmin, what do you think? Suppose that a warrior female and a brahmin male cohabit and a child is later born of their cohabitation. It could resemble the father, or it could resemble the mother, or it could resemble neither the father nor the mother. What do you say? Is it a warrior [child] or a brahmin [child]? The young brahmin Assalāyana replied: Gotama, if a warrior female and a brahmin male cohabit and a child is later born of their cohabitation, which could resemble the father, or could resemble the mother, or could resemble neither the father nor the mother; I do not say it is a warrior [child] and I also do not say it is a brahmin [child]. Gotama, I say only that it is another body. [The World-honored One said:] In the same way, young brahmin, one is reckoned according to where this body is born. If one is born in a brahmin clan, one is reckoned to be of the brahmin clan, if one is born in a warrior... merchant... worker clan, one is reckoned to be of the worker clan. The World-honored One asked: Young brahmin, suppose that a brahmin female and a warrior male cohabit and a child is later born of their cohabitation. It could resemble the father, or it could resemble the mother, or it could resemble neither the father nor the mother. What do you say? Is it a brahmin [child] or a warrior [child]? The young brahmin Assalāyana replied: Gotama, if a brahmin female and a warrior male cohabit and a child is later born of their cohabitation, which could resemble the father, or could

resemble the mother, or could resemble neither the father nor the mother; I do not say it is a brahmin [child] and I also do not say it is a warrior [child]. Gotama, I say only that it is another body.

[The World-honored One said:]

In the same way, young brahmin, one is reckoned according to where this body is born. If one is born in a brahmin clan, one is reckoned to be of the brahmin clan; if one is born in a warrior... merchant... worker clan, one is reckoned to be of the worker clan.

The World-honored One asked:

Young brahmin, what do you think? Suppose that someone has many female horses and lets loose a male donkey among them, and one female horse cohabits with the male donkey, and a foal is later born of their cohab- itation. What do you say? Is it a donkey or a horse?

The young brahmin Assalāyana replied:

Gotama, if a horse cohabits with a donkey, and a foal is later born of their cohabitation, then I do not say it is a donkey and I also do not say it is a horse. Gotama, I say only that it is a mule.

[The World-honored One said:]

In the same way, young brahmin, one is reckoned according to where this body is born. If one is born in a brahmin clan, one is reckoned to be of the brahmin clan, if one is born in a warrior... merchant... worker clan, one is reckoned to be of the worker clan.

The World-honored One said:^183

Young brahmin, in the distant past there were many seers who were staying together in a high forest area and who had given rise to this evil view, “The brahmin caste is the highest; the others are not equal to it. The brah- min caste is white; all of the others are black. The brahmins achieve purity; nonbrahmins do not achieve purity. Brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth. The brahmins were created by Brahmā.”

Then the seer Asita Devala heard that the many seers who were staying together in that high forest area had given rise to this evil view. He put on yellow robes and wrapped a yellow cloth around his head; then, sup porting himself with a stick, holding an umbrella, and wearing the sandals of a white-clothed [lay person],^184 he entered without using the gate, went to the seers’ retreat, and walked up and down.^185 Then one of the seers who was dwelling there in the high forest area saw the seer Asita Devala who, having put on yellow robes and wrapped a yellow cloth around his head, supporting himself with a stick, holding an umbrella, and wearing the sandals of a white-clothed [layperson], had entered without using the gate, gone to the seers’ retreat, and was walking up and down. Having seen this, he approached the many seers who were dwelling together in the high forest area and said, “Friends, right now there is a person who, having put on yellow robes and wrapped a yellow cloth around his head, supporting himself with a stick, holding an umbrella, and wearing the sandals of a white-clothed [layperson], has entered without using the gate and gone to the seers’ retreat, and is walking up and down. Shall we together curse him [saying], ‘You, become ashes! You, become ashes!’?” Then the many seers who were dwelling together in the high forest area approached the seer Asita Devala. On reaching him, they together cursed him [saying], “You, become ashes! You, become ashes!” They cursed him according to their procedure for cursing [saying], “You, become ashes! You, become ashes!” [However,] the more they cursed him, the more his complexion became bright and beautiful and his body pleasantly bright. Then the many seers thought, “Previously when we cursed someone [saying], ‘You, become ashes! You, become ashes!’ he became ashes. Now we are cursing this person [saying], ‘You, become ashes! You, become ashes!’ but the more we curse this person according to our procedure for cursing, the more his complexion becomes bright and beautiful and his body pleasantly bright. Let us rather ask him [who he is].”^186 So they asked him, “Who are you?” The seer Asita Devala replied, “Friends, have you heard of the seer Asita Devala?” They replied, “We have heard of the seer Asita Devala.” He said again, “I am he.” Then the many seers together apologized to the

seer Asita Devala, “Please forgive us! We did not know that the venerable one was the seer Asita Devala.” Then the seer Asita Devala said to the seers, “I have already forgiven you. Is it true that you have given rise to this evil view, ‘The brahmin caste is the highest; the others are not equal to it. The brahmin caste is white; all the others are black. The brahmins achieve purity; nonbrahmins do not achieve purity. Brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth. The brahmins were created by Brahmā’?” The seers replied, “Yes, that is so.” Asita again asked the seers, “Do you yourself know your own father?” The seers replied, “We know him. He was a brahmin who took a brahmin wife, not a nonbrahmin; and that father’s father, and so on up to seven generations of fathers, were brahmins [each of whom] took a brahmin wife, not a nonbrahmin.”^187 Asita asked the seers further, “Do you yourself know your own mother?” The seers replied, “We know her. She was a brahmin who took a brahmin husband, not a nonbrahmin; and that mother’s mother, and so on up to seven generations of mothers, were brahmins [each of whom] took a brah- min husband, not a nonbrahmin.” Asita asked the seers further, “Do you yourself know how the reception of an embryo takes place?” The seers answered, “We know. Due to the conjunction of three things the reception of an embryo takes place: there is a coming together of the father and mother, the [mother’s womb] is vacant and capable, and the _gandhabba_ has arrived. Asita, on these things coming together there is reception of the fetus by the mother.” Asita asked the seers further, “Do you know if the one to be born is male or female? Do you know where it came from? Did it come from a warrior clan, a brahmin, a merchant, or a worker clan? Did it come from the east, south, west, or north?”^188 The seers replied, “We do not know.” Asita also said to the seers, “Friends, you do not see and do not know these things, you do not know whether there has been reception of an embryo, who it is and from where it came, whether it is male or female, whether it came from a warrior clan, a brahmin, a merchant or a worker clan, and whether it came from the east, south, west, or north. Yet you make this statement: ‘The brahmin caste is the highest; the others are not

equal to it. The brahmin caste is white; all of the others are black. The brahmins achieve purity; nonbrahmins do not achieve purity. Brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth. The brahmins were created by Brahmā.’” Young brahmin, those many seers staying in a high forest area, on being thus well instructed and well rebuked by the seer Asita Devala, were unable to declare the purity of brahmins—let alone of your teachers and their followers, who dressed in hides and straw.^189 Then the young brahmin Assalāyana, being rebuked to his face by the World-honored One, was sad and distressed within. He lowered his head in silence, unable to reply. Then the World-honored One, having rebuked the young brahmin Assalāyana to his face, in order to cheer him up, said: Young brahmin, [suppose] a brahmin performs a sacrifice and makes an offering, and he has four sons, of whom two are fond of learning and two are not learned. Young brahmin, what do you think? To whom will that brahmin first offer the best seat, the best water for washing, and the best food?^190 The young brahmin Assalāyana replied: Gotama, if that brahmin has two sons who are fond of learning, he will certainly first offer them the best seat, the best water for washing, and the best food. The World-honored One asked further: Again, young brahmin, suppose a brahmin performs a sacrifice and makes an offering, and he has four sons, of whom two are fond of learning but are not energetic and delight in doing evil things, and two are not learned but are fond of being energetic and delight in doing good things. Young brahmin, what do you think? To whom will that brahmin first offer the best seats, the best water for washing, and the best food? The young brahmin Assalāyana replied: Gotama, if that brahmin has two sons who, although not learned, are fond

of being energetic and delight in doing good things, he will certainly first offer them the best seats, the best water for washing, and the best food. The World-honored One said: Young brahmin, you first commended learning, and then commended the upholding of morality. Young brahmin, I say that all four castes are able to achieve purity; I declare it and proclaim it. You too are [now] saying that all four castes are able to achieve purity; you are declaring it and pro- claiming it. At this the young brahmin Assalāyana got up from his seat, wishing to pay homage by bowing his head to the Buddha’s feet.^191 Then that big assem- bly made a huge uproar:

The renunciant Gotama is very wonderful, very remarkable! He has great spiritual power, great virtue, great merit, great power! Why is that? [Because] as the renunciant Gotama says that all of the four castes are able to achieve purity, as he declares it and proclaims it, he causes the young brahmin Assalāyana also to say that all of the four castes are able to achieve purity. Then the World-honored One, knowing the thoughts in the minds of the big assembly, said:

Stop, stop, Assalāyana! Although your mind is pleased and satisfied [mak- ing you wish to pay homage], you may return to your seat. I will teach you the Dharma. Then the young brahmin Assalāyana, having paid homage by bowing his head to the Buddha’s feet, stepped back and sat to one side. The World-hon- ored One taught him the Dharma, exhorting and inspiring him, fully delighting him, teaching him the Dharma with countless skillful means. Having exhorted and inspired him, fully delighting him, he remained silent. Then the young brahmin Assalāyana, having been taught the Dharma by the Buddha, having been exhorted and inspired, fully delighted, rose from his seat, paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and left.

Then the many Kosalan brahmins, before they had gone far, rebuked Assalāyana with all sorts of talk: What did you want to do? You wanted to defeat the renunciant Gotama, but instead you return having been defeated by the renunciant Gotama. You are just like someone who goes into the forest [in search of a cure] for their eyes,^192 but instead returns having lost their sight. Assalāyana, you too are like that. You wanted to defeat the renunciant Gotama, but instead you return having been defeated by the renunciant Gotama. You are just like someone who goes into a pool to drink, but instead returns still thirsty. Assalāyana, you too are like that. You wanted to defeat the renunciant Gotama, but instead you return having been defeated by the renunciant Gotama. Assalāyana, what did you want to do? Then the young brahmin Assalāyana said to the many Kosalan brahmins: Friends, earlier I had already said, “The renunciant Gotama teaches the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma. If someone teaches the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma, it is not possible to defeat him in debate.” Thus said the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the young brahmin Assalāyana was delighted and received it respectfully.
