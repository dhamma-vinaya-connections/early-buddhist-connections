### 125. The Discourse on Poverty

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks, “For a worldly person who has sensual desires, is poverty a great suffering?” The monks answered, “Yes, World-honored One, it is.” The World-honored One further asked the monks: If a person who has sensual desires is poor, he may raise a loan from another family’s wealth. Is raising a loan from another family’s wealth a great suffering in the world? The monks answered, “Yes, World-honored One, it is.” The World-honored One further asked the monks: If a person who has sensual desires raises a loan and is unable to repay it on time, the interest increases day by day. Is the increasing interest a great suffering in the world? The monks answered, “Yes, World-honored One, it is.”

The World-honored One further asked the monks:

If a person who has sensual desires is unable to pay the increasing interest the creditor asks for repayment [of the debt]. Is being asked by a creditor [for repayment of a debt] a great suffering in the world?

The monks answered, “Yes, World-honored One, it is.” The World-honored One further asked the monks:

If a person who has sensual desires is asked by the creditor [for repayment of a debt] and is unable to repay it, the creditor pursues him and asks again and again [for repayment]. Is being pursued by a creditor and asked again and again [for repayment] a great suffering in the world?

The monks answered, “Yes, World-honored One, it is.” The World-honored One further asked the monks:

For a person who has sensual desires, if the creditor pursues him and asks again and again [for repayment], and because of being unable to repay [the loan] he is arrested and bound by the creditor. Is being arrested and bound by a creditor a great suffering in the world?

The monks answered, “Yes, World-honored One, it is.” [The World-honored One said:]

This means that for a person who has sensual desires, poverty is a great suffering in the world; for a person who has sensual desires, raising a loan is a great suffering in the world; for a person who has sensual desires, the increasing interest from raising a loan is a great suffering in the world; for a person who has sensual desires, being asked by a creditor [for repayment of a loan] is a great suffering in the world; for a person who has sensual desires, being pursued by a creditor and asked again and again [for repay- ment] is a great suffering in the world; for a person who has sensual desires, being arrested and bound by a creditor is a great suffering in the world. In the same way, if someone in this noble Dharma has no faith in [the value of] wholesome states, does not keep the precepts, is not learned, is not generous, and lacks wisdom regarding wholesome states, then for that reason he is poor and powerless, even if he possesses great amounts of

gold, silver, beryl, crystal, maṇi jewels, white jade, conch shell, coral, amber, agate, tortoise shell, cornelian, green jade, ruby, and jade pearl.^394 This is what I speak of in my noble teaching as the unwholesomeness [resembling] poverty. [This person] engages in evil conduct of body, speech, and mind. This is what I speak of in my noble teaching as the unwholesomeness [resem bling] raising a loan. He wishes to cover up his evil bodily conduct; he does not disclose it himself, does not want to talk about it, does not want to be rebuked by others, and does not do as they ask. He wishes to cover up his evil verbal and mental conduct; he does not disclose it himself, does not want to talk about it, does not want to be rebuked by others, and does not do as they ask. This is what I speak of in my noble teaching as the unwholesomeness [resembling] the increase in interest due. Whether he is practicing inside a village or town or outside a village or town, his companions in the holy life, on seeing him, speak like this, “Venerable friends, this man acts like this, behaves like this, is evil like this, is impure like this; he is a thorn to the village or town.” He speaks like this, “Venerable sirs, I do not act like this, do not behave like this, am not evil like this, not impure like this; I am not a thorn to the village or town.” This is what I speak of in my noble teaching as the unwhole someness [resembling] the demand for repayment. Whether he is dwelling in a secluded place, on a mountain, at the base of a tree in a forest, or in an open place, he thinks three kinds of unwhole some thoughts, [namely,] thoughts of sensual desire, thoughts of hatred, and thoughts of harming. This is what I speak of in my noble teaching as the unwholesomeness [resembling] repeated pursuit. He engages in evil bodily, verbal, and mental conduct. Owing to his evil bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, because of this, at the breaking up of the body at death, he will certainly go to a bad realm of existence, and be reborn in hell. This is what I speak of in my noble teaching as the unwholesomeness [resembling] arrest and bondage. I see no other bondage as miserable, as severe, as harsh, and as unde sirable as the bondage of hell or of [rebirth] as an animal or a hungry ghost. A monk who is an arahant, who has achieved destruction of the taints, knows that these three miserable kinds of bondage have been

destroyed completely, that they have been pulled out by the roots, never to grow again.^395

Then the World-honored One uttered these verses:

In the world poverty is suffering, [So too is] raising a loan from another’s wealth. Having raised such a loan, Being asked [to repay it] is suffering and distress.

The creditor approaches him and asks [for repayment]; Because of this, [being unable to repay it,] he is arrested and bound. This bondage is very severe suffering For a worldly person who delights in sensual pleasures.

It is the same in the noble Dharma For one who is without right faith, Who has no sense of shame or guilt, And performs evil, unwholesome deeds.

With his body he performs unwholesome deeds, And also with his speech and mind. He covers them up, does not want to talk about them, And does not like being rightly instructed and admonished.

If someone performs [such deeds] again and again, His mind and thoughts experience suffering. Whether in a village or in a secluded place, He will certainly experience regret because of it.

With body and speech he performs such deeds, And also with the thoughts in his mind. His evil deeds increase more and more, [As] he performs them again and again.

[Committing] evil actions and lacking wisdom, Having done much that is unwholesome, Accordingly, when his life comes to its end, He will certainly go to the bondage of hell.

This bondage is the most profound suffering. A “hero,” [however,] is free from it. One who obtains wealth in accordance with the Dharma Will not incur debt but will be at peace. Giving brings happiness; It is profitable in both respects [in present and future lives]. In this way householders Increase their merit through giving. It is the same in the noble Dharma; For one who has good and sincere faith And is equipped with a sense of shame and guilt Who will certainly be without stinginess or greed. Having abandoned the five hindrances, He always delights in practicing diligently. Attaining the concentrative absorptions, He is filled with lasting peace and happiness.^396 Having attained an unworldly happiness, Purified as if bathed with water, His imperturbable mind is liberated, And all bonds of existence are eradicated. Nirvana is freedom from ailment; It is called the unsurpassable lamp.^397 Freedom from grief, freedom from dust, and peace: This is called “the imperturbable.” Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
