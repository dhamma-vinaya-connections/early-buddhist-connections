### 42. The Discourse on What is the Purpose?”

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time, in the late afternoon, Venerable Ānanda rose from sitting in meditation and went to the Buddha, paid homage at his feet, stood to one side, and said: “World-honored One, what is the purpose of keeping the precepts?” The World-honored One answered: Ānanda, keeping the precepts has the purpose of [allowing one] to be without regret. Ānanda, if one keeps the precepts, one attains [the state of] being without regret. Again Ānanda asked: “World-honored One, what is the purpose of being without regret?” The World-honored One answered: “Ānanda, being without regret has the purpose of joy. Ānanda, if one is without regret, one attains joy.” Again Ānanda asked: “World-honored One, what is the purpose of joy?” The World-honored One answered: “Ānanda, joy has the purpose of rap- ture. Ānanda, if one is joyful, one attains rapture.” Again Ānanda asked: “World-honored One, what is the purpose of rap- ture?” The World-honored One answered: “Ānanda, rapture has the purpose of tranquility. Ānanda, if one has rapture, one attains tranquility of the body.” Again Ānanda asked: “World-honored One, what is the purpose of tran- quility?” The World-honored One answered: “Ānanda, tranquility has the purpose of happiness. Ānanda, if one has tranquility, one attains the experience of happiness.”

Again Ānanda asked: “World-honored One, what is the purpose of hap piness?” The World-honored One answered: “Ānanda, happiness has the purpose of concentration. Ānanda, if one has happiness one attains concentration of the mind.” Again Ānanda asked: “World-honored One, what is the purpose of con centration?” The World-honored One answered: Ānanda, concentration has the purpose of seeing things as they really are, knowing things as they really are. Ānanda, if one has concentration, one attains [the ability] to see and know things as they really are. Again Ānanda asked: “World-honored One, what is the purpose of seeing and knowing things as they really are?” The World-honored One answered: Ānanda, seeing and knowing things as they really are has the purpose of disenchantment. Ānanda, if one sees and knows things as they really are, one attains disenchantment. Again Ānanda asked: “World-honored One, what is the purpose of dis enchantment?” The World-honored One answered: “Ānanda, disenchantment has the pur pose of dispassion. Ānanda, if one is disenchanted, one attains dispassion.” Again Ānanda asked: “World-honored One, what is the purpose of dis passion?” The World-honored One answered: Ānanda, dispassion has the purpose of liberation. Ānanda, if one is dispassionate, one attains liberation from all lust, anger, and ignorance. Ānanda, through keeping the precepts one has no regrets; through having no regrets one attains joy; through joy one attains rapture; through rapture one attains tranquility; through tranquility one attains happiness; through happiness one attains concentration. Ānanda, through concentration the learned noble disciple sees and knows things as they really are; through seeing and knowing things as they really are, he attains disenchantment; through disenchantment he attains dispassion;

through dispassion he attains liberation. Through liberation he knows he is liberated: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. He knows as it really is: there will not be another existence.” Thus, Ānanda, one state is beneficial for another, one state is the means for another, and the precepts eventually lead to the highest goal, that is to say, to crossing over from this bank to the other bank. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, Venerable Ānanda and the other monks were delighted and remembered them well.
