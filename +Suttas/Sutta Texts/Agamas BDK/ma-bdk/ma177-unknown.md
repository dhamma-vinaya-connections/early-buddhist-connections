### 177. The Discourse on [Four Modes of ] Explanation

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling in the Kuru country, at Kammāsadhamma, a town of the Kurus. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: I will now teach you the Dharma that is excellent in the beginning, excellent in the middle, and excellent in the end, with its meaning and phrasing, endowed with purity, and revealing the holy life, which is called the “Dis- course on Four Modes of Explanation.” I will analyze the meaning [of the absorptions] according to the “Dis- course on Four Modes of Explanation.” Listen closely, listen closely and pay proper attention to what I will now teach you. Then the monks listened to receive the instruction. The Buddha said: How does one analyze the meaning according to the “Discourse on Four Modes of Explanation”? Suppose that by a [certain] practice, a [certain] characteristic, and a [certain] mark, a monk dwells secluded from sensual desires, secluded

from evil and unwholesome states, with [directed] awareness and [sus- tained] contemplation, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion, having attained the first absorption. Yet, he does not keep to that practice, is not mindful of that characteristic and that mark, but practices mindfulness and perception connected with delight in sensual pleasures, and [thereby] fully regresses. That monk should know: “This state having arisen in me, I will neither remain [at my level of concentration] nor advance it, nor will I [develop] disenchantment. This state having arisen in me, I will regress. This [level of] concentration of mine will not last long.” That monk should know this. Again, by a [certain] practice, a [certain] characteristic, and a [certain] mark, a monk dwells secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states, with [directed] awareness and [sustained] con- templation, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion, having attained the first absorption. He keeps up that practice, is mindful of that characteristic and that mark, with mindfulness established in accordance with the Dharma so as to maintain mental unification. That monk should know: “This state having arisen in me, I will neither regress nor advance [in concentration]; nor will I [develop] disenchantment. This state having arisen in me, I am able to maintain my [level of] con- centration; it will certainly last a long time.” That monk should know this. Again, by a [certain] practice, a [certain] characteristic, and a [certain] mark, a monk dwells secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states, with [directed] awareness and [sustained] con- templation, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion, having attained the first absorption. He does not keep to that practice, is not mindful of that characteristic and that mark, but practices mindfulness and perception connected with the second absorption, and [thereby] fully advances. That monk should know: “This state having arisen in me, I will neither regress nor remain [at my level of concentration]; nor will I [develop] dis- enchantment. This state having arisen in me, I will advance. In this way I will soon attain the second absorption.” That monk should know this.

Again, by a [certain] practice, a [certain] characteristic, and a [certain] mark, a monk dwells secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states, with [directed] awareness and [sustained] con templation, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion, having attained the first absorption.^414 He does not keep to that practice, is not mindful of that characteristic and that mark, but practices mindfulness and perception connected with cessation and endowed with dispassion. That monk should know: “This state having arisen in me, I will not regress, nor maintain, nor advance [in concentration]. This state having arisen in me, I am able [to develop] disenchantment. In this way I will soon achieve the destruction of the taints.” That monk should know this. Again, by a [certain] practice, a [certain] characteristic, and a [certain] mark, a monk dwells with the calming of [directed] awareness and [sus tained] contemplation, with inner stillness and mental unification, without [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with rapture and hap piness born of concentration, having attained the second absorption. He does not keep to that practice, is not mindful of that characteristic and that mark, but practices mindfulness and perception connected with the first absorption, and [thereby] fully regresses. That monk should know: “This state having arisen in me, I will neither maintain nor advance [my level of concentration]; nor will I [develop] dis enchantment. This state having arisen in me, I will regress. This [level of] concentration of mine will not last long.” That monk should know this.

He keeps up that practice, is mindful of that characteristic and that mark, with mindfulness established in accordance with the Dharma so as to maintain mental unification. That monk should know: “This state having arisen in me, I will neither regress nor advance [in concentration]; nor will I [develop] disenchantment.

This state having arisen in me, I am able to maintain my [level of] con- centration; it will certainly last long.” That monk should know this. Again, by a [certain] practice, a [certain] characteristic, and a [certain] mark, a monk dwells with the calming of [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with inner stillness and mental unification, without [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with rapture and happiness born of concentration, having attained the second absorption. He does not keep to that practice, is not mindful of that characteristic and that mark, but practices mindfulness and perception connected with the third absorption, and [thereby] fully advances. That monk should know: “This state having arisen in me, I will neither regress nor remain [at my level of concentration]; nor will I [develop] disenchantment. This state having arisen in me, I will advance. In this way I will soon attain the third absorption.” That monk should know this.

He does not keep to that practice, is not mindful of that characteristic and that mark, but practices mindfulness and perception connected with cessation and endowed with dispassion. That monk should know: “This state having arisen in me, I will not regress, nor maintain, nor advance [in concentration]. This state having arisen in me, I am able [to develop] disenchantment. In this way I will soon achieve the destruction of the taints.” That monk should know this. Again, by a [certain] practice, a [certain] characteristic, and a [certain] mark, a monk dwells secluded from rapture and pleasure, dwelling in equanimity and without seeking anything, with right mindfulness and right comprehension, experiencing happiness with the body, having attained the third absorption, which the noble ones speak of as noble equanimity and mindfulness, a happy abode. He does not keep to that practice, is not mindful of that characteristic and that mark, but practices mindfulness and perception connected with the second absorption, and [thereby] fully regresses.

That monk should know: “This state having arisen in me, I will neither maintain nor advance [my level of concentration]; nor will I [develop] dis enchantment. This state having arisen in me, I will regress. This [level of] concentration of mine will not last long.” That monk should know this.

He does not keep to that practice, is not mindful of that characteristic and that mark, but practices mindfulness and perception connected with the fourth absorption, and [thereby] fully advances. That monk should know: “This state having arisen in me, I will neither regress nor maintain my [level of concentration]; nor will I [develop] dis enchantment. This state having arisen in me, I will advance. In this way I will soon attain the fourth absorption.” That monk should know this. Again, by a [certain] practice, a [certain] characteristic, and a [certain] mark, a monk dwells secluded from rapture and pleasure, dwelling in equanimity and without seeking anything, with right mindfulness and right comprehension, experiencing happiness with the body, having attained

the third absorption, which the noble ones speak of as noble equanimity and mindfulness, a happy abode.

In this way I will soon achieve the destruction of the taints.” That monk should know this. Again, by a [certain] practice, a [certain] characteristic, and a [certain] mark, a monk dwells with the cessation of pleasure and the cessation of pain, and with the earlier cessation of rapture and displeasure, with nei- ther-pain-nor-pleasure, with purity of equanimity and mindfulness, having attained the fourth absorption. He does not keep to that practice, is not mindful of that characteristic and that mark, but practices mindfulness and perception connected with the third absorption, and [thereby] fully regresses.

pain, and with the earlier cessation of rapture and displeasure, with nei ther-pain-nor-pleasure, with purity of equanimity and mindfulness, having attained the fourth absorption. He does not keep to that practice, is not mindful of that characteristic and that mark, but practices mindfulness and perception connected with the sphere of infinite space, and [thereby] fully advances.

In this way I will soon achieve the destruction of the taints.” That monk should know this. Again, by a [certain] practice, a [certain] characteristic, and a [certain] mark, a monk dwells completely transcending perceptions of form, with the cessation of perceptions of sensory impact, unaware of perceptions of diversity, [being instead aware] of infinite space, having attained the sphere of infinite space. He does not keep to that practice, is not mindful of that characteristic and that mark, but practices mindfulness and perception connected with delight in form, and [thereby] fully regresses. That monk should know: “This state having arisen in me, I will neither maintain nor advance [my level of concentration]; nor will I [develop] dis enchantment.

All of these are to be known, up to the sphere of neither-perception-nor nonperception, which is foremost among them. The monk who practices the absorptions, on emerging from them, should explain this to others. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
