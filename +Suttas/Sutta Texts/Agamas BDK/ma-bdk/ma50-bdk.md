### 50. The [Second] Discourse on Respect

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: A monk should practice respect and be considerate and courteous to his companions in the holy life. If he does not practice respect and is not considerate and courteous to his companions in the holy life, then it is impossible to fulfill even the most basic rules of proper conduct. If the basic rules of proper conduct are not fulfilled, it is impossible to fulfill the rules for a learner. If the rules for a learner are not fulfilled, it is impossible to guard the sense faculties, to keep the precepts, to be without regret, to experience joy, rapture, tranquility, happiness, con- centration, seeing and knowing things as they really are, disenchantment,

dispassion, and liberation. And if liberation is not fulfilled, it is impos- sible to attain nirvana. If, [however,] a monk does practice respect and is considerate and courteous to his companions in the holy life, then it is possible to fulfill the basic rules of proper conduct. If the basic rules of proper conduct are fulfilled, it is possible to fulfill the rules for a learner. If the rules for a learner are fulfilled, it is possible to guard the sense faculties, to keep the precepts, to be without regret, to experience joy, rapture, tran- quility, happiness, concentration, seeing and knowing things as they really are, disenchantment, dispassion, and liberation. And if liberation is attained, it is possible to attain nirvana. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
