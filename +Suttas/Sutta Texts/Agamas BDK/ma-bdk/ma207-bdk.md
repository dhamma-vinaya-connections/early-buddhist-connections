### 207. The Discourse to Sakuludāyī (1)

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Rājagaha, staying in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary, accompanied by a great sangha of one thousand two hundred and fifty monks who were observing the rains retreat.^275 At that time, when the night was over, at dawn, the World-honored One put on his [outer] robe, took his bowl, and entered Rājagaha to beg almsfood. Having begged almsfood [and partaken of it], he put away his [outer] robe and bowl, washed his hands and feet, put his sitting mat over his shoulder, and went into the Peacocks’ Grove, a park [frequented by] heterodox practitioners. At that time there was, in the Peacocks’ Grove, a heterodox practitioner named Sakuludāyī, a renowned leader and teacher of a congregation, of great fame and respected by the people, the head of a great congregation of disciples, five hundred heterodox practitioners who honored him.

He was staying with a great congregation that was noisy, agitated and dis- orderly, creating a great clamor, discussing various kinds of irrelevant talk, namely talk about kings, talk about thieves, talk about battles, talk about food, talk about robes and blankets, talk about married women, talk about girls, talk about adulterous women, talk about the world, talk about wilderness areas, talk about what is in the ocean, talk about the people of the country— they were seated together talking such kinds of irrelevant talk. Seeing the Buddha coming in the distance, the heterodox practitioner Sakuludāyī admonished his congregation, “Keep quiet, all of you! The renun- ciant Gotama is coming. His congregation is silent, they always delight in silence and praise silence. If he sees that this congregation [of ours] is silent, perhaps he will come and join us.” Having ordered his congregation to be silent, the heterodox practitioner Sakuludāyī remained silent himself. The World-honored One approached the heterodox practitioner Sakuludāyī. The heterodox practitioner Sakuludāyī promptly rose from his seat, arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder, extended his hands with joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,^276 “Welcome, renunciant Gotama! It is a long time since the renunciant Gotama came here. Please be seated on this seat.” The World-honored One sat on the seat prepared by the heterodox prac- titioner Sakuludāyī. Having exchanged greetings with the World-honored One, the heterodox practitioner Sakuludāyī stepped back and sat to one side. The World-honored One asked, “Udāyī, what were you discussing just now? For what matter have you been seated together here?” The heterodox practitioner Sakuludāyī replied, “Gotama, let be that talk. That talk was not profound. [If] the renunciant Gotama wishes to hear about that talk, it will not be difficult to hear about it on a later occasion.” Three times the World-honored One asked like this, “Udāyī, what were you discussing just now? For what matter have you been seated together here?”^277 And three times the heterodox practitioner Sakuludāyī replied, “Gotama, let be that talk. That talk was not profound. [If] the renunciant Gotama wishes to hear about that talk, it will not be difficult to hear about it on a later occasion.” [Then Sakuludāyī said]: But since the renunciant Gotama has three times expressed his wish to hear it, I shall now report it.

Gotama, we were seated together with many brahmins from the country of Kosala in the teaching hall of the Kosalans, having the following dis cussion: “It is of great benefit for the people of Aṅga and Magadha, the people of Aṅga and Magadha are getting great benefit, in that a congre gation that is such a great field of merit, namely [the congregation of] Pūraṇa Kassapa, is spending the rains retreat at Rājagaha.” Why is that? Gotama, Pūraṇa Kassapa is a renowned leader and teacher of a congre gation, of great fame and respected by the people, head of a great congre gation of disciples, five hundred heterodox practitioners who honor him, and he is spending the rains retreat here in Rājagaha. In the same way Makkhali Gosāla... Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta... Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta... Pakudha Kaccāyana... Ajita Kesakambalī ... Gotama, Ajita Kesakambalī is a renowned leader and teacher of a con gregation, of great fame and respected by the people. He is the head of a great congregation of disciples, five hundred heterodox practitioners who honor him, and he is spending the rains retreat here in Rājagaha. Continuing like this, we also talked about the renunciant Gotama, [say ing]: “This renunciant Gotama is a renowned leader and teacher of a con gregation, of great fame and respected by the people. He is leading a great sangha of one thousand two hundred and fifty monks who honor him and are spending the rains retreat [with him] here in Rājagaha.”^278 Gotama, we then had this thought, “Now, out of these honorable renun ciants and brahmins, which one is respected by his disciples, honored, venerated, and treated with respect?^279 [Which one is] not disparaged by his disciples’ disparaging his teaching? [Which one] has no disciples that challenge their teacher, [saying,] ‘This can never be; it does not match up; it does not fit,’ and, so saying, abandon him and leave?” Gotama, we then thought, “Pūraṇa Kassapa is not respected by his dis ciples, he is not honored, venerated, and treated with respect by them. He is disparaged by his disciples’ disparaging his teaching. Many of his dis ciples challenge their teacher, [saying,] ‘This is not possible; it does not match up; it does not fit,’ and, so saying, they abandon him and leave.” Gotama, once in the past Pūraṇa Kassapa, while with his congregation of disciples, repeatedly raised his hand and called out, “Stop, all of you! These persons have not come to ask you about [this] matter; they are

asking me about this matter. You are not capable of resolving this matter; [only] I am capable of resolving this matter.” However, the disciples went on talking among themselves about other matters, not waiting for their teacher to finish his explanation of the matter [in question].^280 Gotama, we then thought, “In these ways Pūraṇa Kassapa is not respected by his disciples. He is not honored, venerated, and treated with respect by them. He is disparaged by his disciples’ disparaging his teaching. Many of his disciples challenge their teacher, [saying,] ‘This is not possible; it does not match up; it does not fit,’ and, so saying, they abandon him and leave.” In the same way Makkhali Gosāla... Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta... Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta... Pakudha Kaccāyana... Ajita Kesakambalī.... Gotama, we thought, “Ajita Kesakambalī is not respected by his dis- ciples. He is not honored, venerated, and treated with respect by them. He is disparaged by his disciples’ disparaging his teaching. Many of his disciples challenge their teacher, [saying,] ‘This is not possible; it does not match up; it does not fit,’ and, so saying, they abandon him and leave.” Gotama, once in the past Ajita Kesakambalī, while with his congregation of disciples, repeatedly raised his hand and called out, “Stop, all of you! These persons have not come to ask you about [that] matter; they are asking me about this matter. You are not capable of resolving this matter; [only] I am capable of resolving this matter.” However, the disciples went on talking among themselves about other matters, not waiting for their teacher to finish his explanation of the matter [in question]. Gotama, we then thought, “In these ways Ajita Kesakambalī is not respected by his disciples. He is not honored, venerated and treated with respect by them. He is disparaged by his disciples’ disparaging his teaching. Many of his disciples challenge their teacher, [saying,] ‘This is not possible; it does not match up; it does not fit,’ and, so saying, they abandon him and leave.” Gotama, we then had this further thought, “The renunciant Gotama is respected by his disciples. He is honored, venerated, and treated with respect by them. He is not disparaged by his disciples’ disparaging his teaching. None of his disciples challenge their teacher, [saying,] ‘This is not possible; it is not proper; it does not fit,’ and, so saying, abandon him and leave.”

Gotama, once in the past the renunciant Gotama was teaching the Dharma surrounded by an immeasurable congregation of hundreds of thousands.^281 Among them was one man who had nodded off and was making a noise by snoring.^282 Another man then addressed this man, saying, “Do not make a noise by snoring after nodding off! Do you not want to hear the sublime teachings taught by the World-honored One, which are like ambrosia?” That other man immediately became silent and made no [more] noise. Gotama, we then thought, “In these ways the renunciant Gotama is respected by his disciples. He is honored, venerated, and treated with respect by them. He is not disparaged by his disciples’ disparaging his teaching. None of his disciples challenge their teacher, [saying,] ‘This is not possible; this does not match up; this does not fit,’ and, so saying, abandon him and leave.” Having heard this, the World-honored One asked the heterodox practitioner Sakuludāyī: Udāyī, how many qualities do you see in me that cause my disciples to respect, honor, and venerate me, to treat me with respect, always following me and not leaving me? The heterodox practitioner Sakuludāyī said: Gotama, I see in Gotama five qualities that cause his disciples to respect, honor, and venerate him, to treat him with respect, always following him and not leaving him. What are the five?^283 The renunciant Gotama is contented with coarse robes and praises con tentment with coarse robes. That the renunciant Gotama is contented with coarse robes and praises contentment with coarse robes—this is the first quality I see in the renunciant Gotama that causes his disciples to respect, honor, and venerate him, to treat him with respect, always following him and not leaving him. Again, the renunciant Gotama is contented with coarse food and praises contentment with coarse food. That the renunciant Gotama is contented with coarse food and praises contentment with coarse food—this is the second quality I see in the renunciant Gotama that causes his disciples to

respect, honor, and venerate him, to treat him with respect, always fol- lowing him and not leaving him. Again, the renunciant Gotama takes little food and praises taking little food. That the renunciant Gotama takes little food and praises taking little food—this is the third quality I see in the renunciant Gotama that causes his disciples to respect, honor, and venerate him, to treat him with respect, always following him and not leaving him. Again, the renunciant Gotama is contented with coarse dwellings, beds, and seats, and praises contentment with coarse dwellings, beds, and seats. That the renunciant Gotama is contented with coarse dwellings, beds, and seats, and praises contentment with coarse dwellings, beds, and seats— this is the fourth quality I see in the renunciant Gotama that causes his disciples to respect, honor, and venerate him, to treat him with respect, always following him and not leaving him. Again, the renunciant Gotama dwells in seclusion and praises dwelling in seclusion. That the renunciant Gotama dwells in seclusion and praises dwelling in seclusion—this is the fifth quality I see in the renunciant Gotama that causes his disciples to respect, honor, and venerate him, to treat him with respect, always following him and not leaving him. These are the five qualities I see in the renunciant Gotama that cause his disciples to respect, honor, and venerate him, to treat him with respect, always following him and not leaving him.

The World-honored One replied:

Udāyī, it is not these five qualities in me that cause my disciples to respect, honor, and venerate me, to treat me with respect, always following me and not leaving me. Udāyī, the robes I wear have been perfectly cut with a blade and [then] dyed an unattractive color.^284 Thus, they are perfect robes [although] dyed an unattractive color. Udāyī, some of my disciples are lifelong wearers of robes made of discarded rags. Udāyī, if in saying “Our World-honored One is contented with coarse robes and praises contentment with coarse robes” such disciples were praising me for being contented with coarse robes, then according to this reasoning, they would not respect, honor, worship and treat me with respect, nor would they follow me.

Again, Udāyī, [at times] I eat rice and other grains, well cooked, free of husks and with a limitless variety of flavors. Udāyī, some of my disciples are lifelong practitioners of begging for almsfood consisting of discarded leftovers. Udāyī, if in saying “Our World-honored One is contented with coarse food and praises contentment with coarse food” such disciples were praising me for being contented with coarse food, then according to this reasoning, they would not respect, honor, and venerate me and treat me with respect; nor would they follow me. Again, Udāyī, I [at times] take food amounting to <a cupful or half a cupful>.^285 Udāyī, some of my disciples might [at times] take food amount ing to <a single bilva fruit or half a bilva fruit>. Udāyī, if in saying “Our World-honored One takes little food and praises taking little food” such disciples were praising me for being contented with taking little food, then according to this reasoning, they would not respect, honor, and ven erate me and treat me with respect; nor would they follow me. Again, Udāyī, [at times] I may stay in a tall building, or in a pavilion. Udāyī, some of my disciples sleep in the open each night for nine or ten months [of the year].^286 Udāyī, if in saying “Our World-honored One is contented with coarse dwellings, beds, and seats, and praises contentment with coarse dwellings, beds, and seats” such disciples were praising me for being contented with coarse dwellings, beds, and seats, then according to this reasoning, they would not respect, honor, and venerate me and treat me with respect; nor would they follow me. Again, Udāyī, I am constantly crowded in by monks, nuns, male lay disciples, and female lay disciples. Udāyī, some of my disciples come together in sangha gatherings only once a fortnight, for the sake of the Dharma and [to declare their] purity [at the pāṭimokkha recital]. Udāyī, if in saying “Our World-honored One dwells in seclusion and praises dwelling in seclusion” such disciples were praising me for dwelling in seclusion, then according to this reasoning they would not respect, honor, and venerate me and treat me with respect; nor would they follow me. Udāyī, it is not because of these five qualities in me that my disciples respect, honor, and venerate me and treat me with respect, always following me and not leaving me.

Udāyī, there are five other qualities in me that cause my disciples to respect, honor, and venerate me, to treat me with respect, always following me and not leaving me. What are the five? Udāyī, there are among my disciples those who praise me for unsur- passable virtue, saying, “The World-honored One practices virtue and is of great virtue; he does what he says and he says what he does.”^287 Udāyī, in this way my disciples praise me for unsurpassable virtue, and it is because of this that they respect, honor, and venerate me and treat me with respect, always following me and not leaving me. Again, Udāyī, there are among my disciples those who praise me for unsurpassable wisdom, saying, “The World-honored One practices wisdom and is of supremely great wisdom. If a disputant comes with counterar- guments, he will certainly be defeated [by the World-honored One], that is to say, he will be unable to give [satisfactory] explanations in terms of the true Dharma and discipline, and will thus be unable to [satisfactorily] explain his own proclamations.”^288 Udāyī, in this way my disciples praise me for unsurpassable wisdom, and it is because of this that they respect, honor, and venerate me, treating me with respect, always following me and not leaving me. Again, Udāyī, there are among my disciples those who praise me for unsurpassable knowledge and vision, saying, “The World-honored One dwells with knowledge, not without knowledge; he dwells with vision, not without vision. The Dharma he teaches to his disciples is with causes, not without causes; it is with conditions, not without conditions; it is answerable, not unanswerable; it is with distinctions, not without distinctions.” Udāyī, in this way my disciples praise me for unsurpassable knowledge and vision, and it is because of this that they respect, honor, and venerate me, treating me with respect, always following me and not leaving me. Again, Udāyī, there are among my disciples those who, feeling disen- chanted with the arrow of craving, come and ask me about _dukkha_ as _dukkha,_ about its arising as arising, about its cessation as cessation, and about the path [to its cessation] as the path [to its cessation]. I then answer them about _dukkha_ as _dukkha,_ about its arising as arising, about its cessation as cessation, and about the path [to its cessation] as the path [to its cessation].

Udāyī, in this way if my disciples come and ask me, I satisfy their minds with my answers and arouse their delight. It is because of this that they respect, honor, and venerate me, treating me with respect, always following me and not leaving me. Again, Udāyī, I explain to my disciples how to attain realization of the higher knowledge of recollection of past lives, or how to attain realization of the higher knowledge of the destruction of the taints.^289 Udāyī, when my disciples gain experience and deliverance in this true Dharma and discipline and are able to reach the other shore, having become free from doubt and confusion, without vacillation in regard to the wholesome teaching, then it is because of this that they respect, honor, and venerate me, treating me with respect, always following me and not leaving me. Udāyī, these are the other five qualities in me that cause my disciples to respect, honor, and venerate me, treating me with respect, always fol lowing me and not leaving me. At this the heterodox practitioner Sakuludāyī rose from his seat, arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder, extended his hands with joined palms toward the Buddha and said: It is wonderful, Gotama. It is remarkable how well you have explained this profound matter, as if nourishing my body with ambrosia. Gotama, just as a great rain nourishes the earth, high and low, in the same way the renunciant Gotama has explained well a profound matter to me, as if nour ishing my body with ambrosia. World-honored One, I have understood. Well-gone One, I have com prehended. World-honored One, I now take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha of monks. May the World-honored One accept me as a lay disciple from this day on until the end of life, as having per sonally taken refuge for my whole life!^290 Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the heterodox practitioner Sakuludāyī was delighted and received it respectfully.
