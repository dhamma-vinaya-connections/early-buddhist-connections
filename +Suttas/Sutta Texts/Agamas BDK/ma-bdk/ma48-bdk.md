### 48. The [Second] Discourse on the Precepts

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks: Venerable friends, if a monk breaks the precepts, this is detrimental to being without regret, experiencing joy, rapture, tranquility, happiness, concentration, seeing and knowing things as they really are, disen chantment, dispassion, and liberation. And lack of liberation is detri mental to [attaining] nirvana. Venerable friends, it is just as with a tree. If its roots are damaged, then the trunk, stem, heartwood, boughs and branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit all cannot develop successfully. Venerable friends, know that it is the same with a monk. If he breaks the precepts, then this is detrimental to being without regret, experiencing joy, rapture, tranquility, happiness, concentration,

seeing and knowing things as they really are, disenchantment, dispas- sion, and liberation. And lack of liberation is detrimental to [attaining] nirvana. If, [however], venerable friends, a monk keeps the precepts, the condition exists for being without regret, experiencing joy, rapture, tranquility, happiness, concentration, seeing and knowing things as they really are, disenchantment, dispassion, and liberation. And if there is liberation, the condition exists for [attaining] nirvana. Venerable friends, it is just as with a tree. If its root is undamaged, then the trunk, stem, heartwood, boughs and branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit can all develop successfully. Venerable friends, you should know that it is the same with a monk. If he keeps the precepts, the condition exists for being without regret, experiencing joy, rapture, tranquility, happiness, concentration, seeing and knowing things as they really are, disen- chantment, dispassion, and liberation. And if there is liberation, the condition exists for [attaining] nirvana.^141 This is what Venerable Sāriputta said. Having heard Venerable Sāriputta’s words, those monks were delighted and remembered them well.
