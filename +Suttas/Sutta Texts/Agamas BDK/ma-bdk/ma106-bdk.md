### 106. The Discourse on Perception

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: If in regard to earth, a renunciant or brahmin has a perception of earth [in terms of] “earth is the self,” “earth belongs to the self,” “the self belongs to earth,” speculating that earth is the self—then he does not know earth. In the same way with regard to water,... fire,... wind,... spirits,... _deva_ s,... Pajāpati,... Brahmā,... [the _deva_ s of] nonanxiety,... [and the _deva_ s of] nonaffliction.... [If] in regard to purity he has a perception of purity [in terms of] “purity is the self,” “purity belongs to the self,” “the self belongs to purity,” speculating that purity is the self—then he does not know purity. [In the same way with] the sphere of infinite space,... the sphere of infinite consciousness,... the sphere of nothingness,... the sphere of nei- ther-perception-nor-nonperception,... unity,... diversity,... variety,... the seen,... the heard,... the cognized,... the known,... the ability to contemplate thoughts in the mind,... [the ability to contemplate] mental intentions,... from this world to that world,... from that world to this world.... [If] in regard to the all he has a perception of the all [in terms of] “the all is the self,” “the all belongs to the self,” “the self belongs to the all,” speculating that the all is the self, then he does not know the all. If, [however,] in regard to earth a renunciant or brahmin knows earth [in terms of] “earth is not the self,” “earth does not belong to the self,” “the self does not belong to earth,” not speculating that earth is the self— then he knows earth. In the same way with regard to water,... fire,... wind,... spirits,... _deva_ s,... Pajāpati,... Brahmā,... [the _deva_ s of] nonanxiety,... [the _deva_ s of] nonaffliction.... [If] in regard to purity he knows purity [in terms of] “purity is not the self,” “purity does not belong to the self,” “the self does not belong to purity,” not speculating that purity is the self— then he knows purity.

[In the same way in regard to] the sphere of infinite space,... the sphere of infinite consciousness,... the sphere of nothingness,... the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception,... unity,... diversity,... variety,... the seen,... the heard,... the cognized,... the known,... the ability to contemplate thoughts in the mind,... [the ability to contemplate] mental intentions,... from this world to that world,... from that world to this world.... [If] in regard to the all he knows the all [in terms of] “the all is not the self,” “the all does not belong to the self,” “the self does not belong to the all,” not speculating that the all is the self—then he knows the all. In regard to earth, I know earth [in terms of] “earth is not the self,” “earth does not belong to the self,” “the self does not belong to earth.” Not speculating that earth is the self, I know earth. In the same way in regard to water,... fire,... wind,... spirits,... deva s,... Pajāpati,... Brahmā,... [the deva s of] nonanxiety,... [the deva s of] nonaffliction.... In regard to purity, I know purity [in terms of] “purity is not the self,” “purity does not belong to the self,” “the self does not belong to purity.” Not speculating that purity is the self, I know purity. [In the same way in regard to] the sphere of infinite space,... the sphere of infinite consciousness,... the sphere of nothingness,... the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception,... unity,... diversity,... variety,... the seen,... the heard,... the cognized,... the known,... the ability to contemplate thoughts in the mind,... [the ability to contemplate] mental intentions,... from this world to that world,... from that world to this world.... In regard to the all, I know the all [in terms of] “the all is not the self,” “the all does not belong to the self,” “the self does not belong to the all.” Not speculating that the all is the self, I know the all. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
