### 64. The Discourse on the Divine Messengers

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time, the World-honored One addressed the monks: With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses human [vision], I see beings as they die and as they are reborn handsome or ugly, excel- lent or not excellent, as they come and go between good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their [previous] deeds. I see this as it really is. If these beings were ill conducted in body, speech, and mind, reviled noble ones, held wrong views, and performed actions [based on] wrong views, then because of these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they certainly are reborn in a bad realm of existence, in hell. If [however] these beings were well conducted in body, speech, and mind, did not revile noble ones, held right views, and performed actions [based on] right views, then because of these causes and con- ditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they certainly are reborn in a good realm of existence, in a heavenly realm. It is just as, when it is raining heavily and bubbles are appearing and disappearing on the water surface, then if a man with good eyesight is standing in a place [close by], he [can] observe the [bubbles] as they appear and as they disappear. In the same way, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses human [vision], I see beings as they die and as they are reborn handsome or ugly, excellent or not excellent, as they come and go between good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their [previous] deeds. I see this as it really is.

If these beings were ill conducted in body, speech, and mind, reviled noble ones, held wrong views, and performed actions [based on] wrong views, then because of these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they certainly are reborn in a bad realm of existence, in hell. If [however] these beings were well conducted in body, speech, and mind, did not revile noble ones, held right views, and performed actions [based on] right views, then because of these causes and con ditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they certainly are reborn in a good realm of existence, in a heavenly realm. It is just as, when it is raining heavily and the raindrops are falling on higher [places] or on lower [places], then if a man with good eyesight is standing in a place [close by], he [can] observe them as they fall on higher [places] or on lower [places]. In the same way, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses human [vision], I see beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly, excellent or not excellent, as they come and go between good or bad realms of existence, in accor dance with their [previous] deeds. I see this as it really is. If these beings were ill conducted in body, speech, and mind, reviled noble ones, held wrong views, and performed actions [based on] wrong views, then because of these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they certainly are reborn in a bad realm of existence, in hell. If [however] these beings were well conducted in body, speech, and mind, did not revile noble ones, held right views, and performed actions [based on] right views, then because of these causes and con ditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they certainly are reborn in a good realm of existence, even in a heavenly realm. It is just as if there were a beryl gem, naturally pure and clear, without any flaw or impurity, eight-faceted, well cut, which is strung on a fine thread colored blue, yellow, red, black, or white; if a man with good eyesight is standing in a place [close by], he [can] observe this beryl gem, naturally pure and clear, without any flaw or impurity, eight-faceted, well cut, which is strung on a fine thread colored blue, yellow, red, black, or white. In the same way, with the divine eye,

which is purified and surpasses human [vision], I see beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly, excellent or not excellent, as they come and go between good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their [previous] deeds. I see this as it really is. If these beings were ill conducted in body, speech, and mind, reviled noble ones, held wrong views, and performed actions [based on] wrong views, then because of these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they certainly are reborn in a bad realm of existence, in hell. If [however] these beings were well conducted in body, speech, and mind, did not revile noble ones, held right views, and performed actions [based on] right views, then because of these causes and con- ditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they certainly are reborn in a good realm of existence, in a heavenly realm. It is just as if there were two rooms connected by a single door through which many people go in or out; if a man with good eyesight is standing in a place [close by], he [can] observe them as they go in or out. In the same way, with the divine eye, which is purified and sur- passes human [vision], I see beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly, excellent or not excellent, as they come and go between good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their [previous] deeds. I see this as it really is. If these beings were ill conducted in body, speech, and mind, reviled noble ones, held wrong views, and performed actions [based on] wrong views, then because of these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they certainly are reborn in a bad realm of existence, in hell. If [however] these beings were well conducted in body, speech, and mind, did not revile noble ones, held right views, and performed actions [based on] right views, then because of these causes and con- ditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they certainly are reborn in a good realm of existence, in a heavenly realm. It is just as a man with good eyesight, standing on top of a tall building, [can] observe the people below coming and going, circling around, sitting, lying, walking, or [even] jumping. In the same way,

with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses human [vision], I see beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly, excellent or not excellent, as they come and go between good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their [previous] deeds. I see this as it really is. If these beings were ill conducted in body, speech, and mind, reviled noble ones, held wrong views, and performed actions [based on] wrong views, then because of these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they certainly are reborn in a bad realm of existence, in hell. If [however] these beings were well conducted in body, speech, and mind, did not revile noble ones, held right views, and performed actions [based on] right views, then because of these causes and con ditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they certainly are reborn in a good realm of existence, in a heavenly realm. If a being, born in the human realm, was unfilial to his parents, did not respect renunciants and brahmins, did not behave honestly, did not do meritorious acts, and was not afraid of the results that evil deeds bring in the next life, then because of these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, he is born in the realm of King Yama. King Yama’s wardens bring [the culprit] to him, saying: Your majesty, formerly, while a human, this being was unfilial to his parents, did not respect renunciants and brahmins, did not behave honestly, did not do meritorious acts, and was not afraid of the results that evil deeds bring in the next life. May your majesty judge his evil deeds! Then King Yama employs [the parable of] the first divine messenger to thoroughly question, examine, teach, and reprimand him: “Did you ever see the coming of the first divine messenger?” The man answers, “No, your majesty, I did not see him.” King Yama asks again: Have you never seen, in a village or town, a small infant, male or female, with weak, tender body, lying in its own excrement and

urine, unable to tell its parents: “Father, mother, take me away from this dirty place! Bathe this body and make it clean!”?

The man answers, “I have seen it, your majesty.” King Yama asks again: On recalling this later, why did you not think, “I myself am [also] subject to the law of birth, I am not exempt from birth, and therefore I should do good acts of body, speech, and mind”?

The man says, “Your majesty, I was truly corrupt. Will my prolonged decadence [cause me] enduring loss?” King Yama says: You truly were corrupt, and your prolonged decadence [will cause you] enduring loss. Now I will examine and punish you as a neg- ligent person acting with negligence. Your evil actions were not done by your parents, nor by kings, gods, renunciants, or brahmins. You did the evil and unwholesome actions yourself. Therefore, you will now certainly experience retribution [for them].

Having employed [the parable of] the first divine messenger to thor- oughly question, examine, teach, and reprimand him, King Yama also employs [the parable of] the second divine messenger to thoroughly question, examine, teach, and reprimand him: “Did you ever see the coming of the second divine messenger?” The man answers, “No, your majesty, I did not see him.” Then King Yama asks again: Have you never seen, in a village or town, a very old man or woman, excessively aged, in great pain and near death, with teeth fallen out and hair gone white, with hunched body, walking sup- ported by a stick, and with body trembling?

That man answers, “I have seen it, your majesty.” King Yama asks again: On recalling this later, why did you not think, “I myself am [also]

subject to old age, I am not exempt from old age, and therefore I should do good acts of body, speech, and mind”? The man says, “Your majesty, I was truly corrupt. Will my prolonged decadence [cause me] enduring loss?” King Yama says: You truly were corrupt, and [your] prolonged decadence [will cause you] enduring loss. Now I will examine and punish you as a negligent person acting with negligence. Your evil actions were not done by your parents, nor by kings, gods, renunciants, or brah mins. You did the evil and unwholesome actions yourself. There fore, you will now certainly experience retribution [for them]. Having employed [the parable of] the second divine messenger to thor oughly question, examine, teach, and reprimand him, King Yama employs [the parable of] the third divine messenger to thoroughly ques tion, examine, teach, and reprimand him: “Did you ever see the coming of the third divine messenger?” The man answers, “No, your majesty, I did not see him.” King Yama asks again: Have you never seen, in a village or town, a man or a woman who is seriously ill, sitting or lying on a bed or couch, or on the ground, with extreme pain, severe pain arising in the body, which is [totally] undesired and will [eventually] cause death? The man answers, “I have seen it, your majesty.” King Yama asks again: On recalling this later, why did you not think, “I myself am [also] subject to disease, I am not exempt from disease, and therefore I should do good acts of body, speech, and mind”? The man says, “Your majesty, I was truly corrupt. Will [my] prolonged decadence [cause me] enduring loss?” King Yama says: You truly were corrupt, and your prolonged decadence [will cause

you] enduring loss. Now I will examine and punish you as a neg ligent person acting with negligence. Your evil actions were not done by your parents, nor by kings, gods, renunciants, or brahmins. You did the evil and unwholesome actions yourself. Therefore, you will now certainly experience retribution [for them].

Having employed [the parable of] the third divine messenger to thor- oughly question, examine, teach, and reprimand him, King Yama employs [the parable of] the fourth divine messenger to thoroughly question, examine, teach, and reprimand him: “Did you ever see the coming of the fourth divine messenger?” The man answers, “No, your majesty, I did not see him.” The King Yama asks again: Have you never seen, in a village or town, a man or a woman, at the time of death, or already one day dead, or two days, or up to six or seven days dead, pecked at by crows, eaten by jackals and wolves, or already burned by fire, buried in the ground, or rotten and decaying?

The man answers, “I have seen it, your majesty.” King Yama asks again: On recalling this later, why did you not think, “I myself am [also] subject to death, I am not exempt from death, and therefore I should do good acts of body, speech, and mind”?

The man says, “Your majesty, I was truly corrupt. Will my prolonged decadence [cause me] enduring loss?” King Yama says: You truly were corrupt, and your prolonged decadence [will cause you] enduring loss. Now I will examine and punish you as a neg- ligent person acting with negligence. Your evil actions were not done by your parents, nor by kings, gods, renunciants, or brahmins. You did the evil and unwholesome actions yourself. Therefore, you will now certainly experience retribution [for them].

Having employed [the parable of] the fourth divine messenger to thor oughly question, examine, teach, and reprimand him, King Yama employs [the parable of] the fifth divine messenger to thoroughly ques tion, examine, teach, and reprimand him, “Did you ever see the coming of the fifth divine messenger?” The man answers, “No, your majesty, I did not see him.” King Yama asks again: Have you never seen that the officers of the king arrest criminals and punish them with various tortures such as cutting off their hands or cutting off their feet, or cutting off both hands and feet, or cutting off their ears, or cutting off their nose, or cutting off both ears and nose, chopping or cutting [them to pieces], tearing out their beard, or tearing out their hair, or tearing out both beard and hair, putting them in a cage and setting fire to their clothing, or wrapping them in straw and setting fire to it, putting [them] in the belly of an iron donkey, in the mouth of an iron pig, or in the mouth of an iron tiger that is then [heated] with fire, placing them in a copper cauldron or an iron cauldron and boiling them, or cut ting them into pieces, or stabbing them with a sharp fork, or hook ing them with hooks, or laying them down on an iron bed and scalding them with boiling oil, or sitting them in an iron mortar and pounding them with an iron pestle, or [having them be bitten by] serpents, snakes, and lizards, or whipping them with whips, or beating them with sticks, or hitting them with clubs, or impaling them alive on a tall post, or cutting off their heads? The man answered, “I have seen it, your majesty.” King Yama asks again, “On recalling this later, why did you not think, ‘I am subject, here and now in the present, to the [effects of past] evil, unwholesome [deeds]’?” The man says, “Your majesty, I was truly corrupt. Will my pro longed decadence [cause me] enduring loss?” King Yama says: You truly were corrupt, and your prolonged decadence [will cause

you] enduring loss. Now I will examine and punish you as a neg ligent person who acted with negligence. Your evil actions were not done by your parents, nor by kings, gods, renunciants, or brah mins. You did the evil and unwholesome actions yourself. There fore, you will now certainly experience retribution [for them].” Having employed [the parable of] the fifth divine messenger to thor oughly question, examine, teach, and reprimand him, King Yama hands him over to the wardens of hell. The wardens of hell take hold of him and put him into the great hell with four gates.

[Then the Buddha] recited a verse:

It has four columns and four gates, Its twelve sides are surrounded by Walls made of iron, Above, it is covered with an iron [roof]. Inside the hell the floor is of iron, Iron, all ablaze with flames and fire. It is immeasurable leagues in depth, Reaching to the bottom of the earth. [It is] extremely harsh, unbearable. The light of its fire is hard to look at. Seeing it, one’s body hairs stand on end, Out of fear and terror of this great suffering. [That man], reborn in [this] hell, Descends head over heels, [Because he] reviled noble ones, Who are disciplined, well purified.^163 [There comes] a time after a very long period when, for the sake of those beings, the eastern gate of the great hell with four gates opens. After the eastern gate has opened, those beings rush towards it, seeking a safe place, a refuge. [But when] countless hundreds and thousands of beings have gath ered there, the eastern gate of the hell closes again on its own. The

[beings] inside experience extreme suffering, weeping and wailing, lying on the ground in utter despair; yet they are unable to die until [the results of] their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted. Again, [after] a very long period the southern gate... the western gate... the northern gate opens. After the northern gate has opened, those beings rush toward it, seeking a safe place, a refuge. [But when] countless hundreds and thousands of beings have gathered there, the northern gate of the hell closes again on its own. The [beings] inside experience extreme suffering, weeping and wailing, lying on the ground in utter despair; yet they are unable to die until [the results of] their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted. Again, after a very long period, those beings emerge from the great hell with four gates. After [having been] in the great hell With four gates, they appear in the [great] hell with a high peak, which is burning with fire within [yet] not [manifesting] smoke or flames. They are forced to walk on it, to walk to and fro and round and round. The skin, flesh, and blood of their two feet disappears [through being burnt] when they put their feet down, but it reappears and becomes as before once they lift their feet up. They are punished in this way for countless hundreds and thousands of years, enduring extreme pain; yet they are unable to die until [the results of] their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted. Again, after a very long period, those beings emerge from the great hell with a high peak. After [having been] in the great hell with a high peak, they appear in the great hell of excrement, which is filled with excrement, countless thousands of feet deep. Those beings all fall into it. Inside the great hell of excrement there appear numerous worms called lingqu-lai, with white body, black head, and a needle-like mouth. These worms gnaw into the feet of those beings and devour them. Having devoured the feet, they gnaw into and devour the calf bones. Having devoured the calf bones, they gnaw into and devour the thigh bones. Having devoured the thigh bones, they gnaw into and devour the hip bones. Having devoured the hipbones, they gnaw into and devour the back bones.

Having devoured the back bones, they gnaw into and devour the shoulder bones, the neck bones, and the skull. Having devoured the skull, they eat the brain. Those beings are tormented in this way for countless hundreds and thousands of years, enduring extreme pain; yet they are unable to die until [the results of] their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted. Again, after a very long period, those beings emerge from the great hell of excrement. After [having been] in the great hell of excre- ment, they appear in the great hell of the iron-leaved forest. Having seen it, those beings have an impression of coolness and they think: “Let us go there quickly to cool down!” Those beings go toward [this forest], seeking a safe place, a refuge. Then the countless hundreds and thousands of beings that have gathered enter the great hell of the iron-leaved forest. In the great hell of the iron-leaved Forest, a great hot wind blows from the four direc- tions. After the blowing of the hot wind, the iron leaves fall. When the iron leaves fall, they cut the hands, the feet, or the hands and feet; they cut the ears, the nose, or the ears and nose, as well as other limbs. [Those beings] have their bodies cut and smeared with blood for count- less hundreds and thousands of years, enduring extreme pain; yet they are unable to die until [the results of] their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted. Again, in the great hell of the iron-leaved forest there appear giant dogs with very long fangs. They bite those beings, tearing off their skin from foot to head and eating it, or tearing off their skin from head to foot and eating it. [Those beings] are tormented in this way for count- less hundreds and thousands of years, enduring extreme pain; yet they are unable to die until [the results of] their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted. Again, in the great hell of the iron-leaved forest there appear giant ravens with two heads and iron beaks. They stand on the forehead of those beings, pick out their living eyes and swallow them, split the skull with their beak, and take out the brain and eat it. Those beings are tormented in this way for countless hundreds and thousands of

years, enduring extreme pain; yet they are unable to die until [the results of] their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted. Again, after a very long period those beings emerge from the great hell of the iron-leaved forest. After [having been] in the great hell of the iron-leaved forest, they appear in the great hell of the iron sword tree forest. Those great iron sword-trees are one league high and have thorns some six feet long. Those beings are made to climb up and down them. When they climb up the trees, the thorns turn downward. When they climb down the trees, the thorns turn upward. The thorns of the sword trees pierce those beings, piercing their hands, their feet, or their hands and feet; piercing their ears, their nose, or their ears and nose, as well as the other limbs. [Those beings] have their bodies pierced and smeared with blood for countless hundreds and thousands of years, enduring extreme pain; yet they are unable to die until [the results of] their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted. Again, after a very long period, those beings emerge from the great hell of the iron sword-tree forest. After [having been] in the great hell of the iron sword-tree forest they appear by [the side of] the caustic river, which has very high banks surrounded everywhere by thorns. The caustic water is boiling and very dark. Seeing this, those beings have the impression that this is cool water [thinking]: “There will be cool water.” Having this impression, they think, “Let us go there, bathe in it, and drink as we please, to quickly cool down and be at ease.” Those beings, competing with one another, run toward [the caustic river] and enter it, seeking a pleasant place, a refuge. Then the countless hundreds and thousands of beings that have gathered there fall into the caustic river. Having fallen into the caustic river, they are swept downstream, or swept upstream, or swept down stream and upstream. As those beings are swept downstream, swept upstream, or swept downstream and upstream, their skin is cooked and peels off, their flesh is cooked and peels off, their skin and flesh are cooked and peel off, [until] only the skeleton remains. On both banks of the caustic river there are wardens of hell holding swords, big clubs,

and iron hooks in their hands. When those beings want to climb up on to the bank, the wardens of hell push them back again. Again, on both banks of the caustic river there are wardens of hell, holding hooks and nets in their hands. With the hooks they pull those beings out of the caustic river and put them on the ground of red-hot iron, burning, glowing, and all ablaze. They lift those beings up and then throw them on the ground [again], roll them [all over] the ground, and ask them, “Where do you come from?” Those beings answer, “We do not know where we come from, but we are now suffering from great hunger.” Those wardens of hell then put those beings on a bed of red-hot iron, which is burning, glowing, and all ablaze, forcing them to sit on it. They open their mouths with red-hot iron pincers, and put red-hot iron balls, burning brightly and all ablaze, into their mouths. Those red-hot iron balls burn the lips. Having burned the lips, they burn the tongue. Having burned the tongue, they burn the palate. Having burned the palate, they burn the throat. Having burned the throat, they burn the heart. Having burned the heart, they burn the large intestine. Having burned the large intestine, they burn the small intestine. Having burned the small intestine, they burn the stomach. Having burned the stomach, they come out from the lower part of the body. Those [beings] are tor- mented in this way for countless hundreds and thousands of years, enduring extreme pain; yet they are unable to die until [the results of] their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted. Again, the wardens of hell ask those beings, “Where do you want to go?” Those beings answer, “We do not know where we want to go, but we are suffering from great thirst.” The wardens of hell then put those beings on a bed of red-hot iron, which is burning, glowing, and all ablaze, forcing them to sit on it. They open their mouths with red- hot iron pincers, and pour boiling molten copper into their mouths. That boiling molten copper burns the lips. Having burned the lips, it burns the tongue. Having burned the tongue, it burns the palate. Having burned the palate, it burns the throat. Having burned the throat, it burns the heart. Having burned the heart, it burns the large intestine. Having

burned the large intestine, it burns the small intestine. Having burned the small intestine, it burns the stomach. Having burned the stomach, it comes out from the lower part of the body. The [beings] are tormented in this way for countless hundreds and thousands of years, enduring extreme pain; yet they are unable to die until [the results of] their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted. If those beings in hell have [still] not completely exhausted [the results of] their evil and unwholesome actions, have not exhausted all of it, have not exhausted it without any remainder, then those beings again fall into the caustic river, are again [made to climb] up and down the [trees] in the great hell of the iron sword-tree forest, have to again enter the great hell of the iron-leaved forest, fall again into the great hell of excrement, are again made to walk to and fro in the great hell with a high peak, and again have to enter the great hell with four gates. If [however,] those beings in hell have completely exhausted [the results of] their evil and unwholesome actions, exhausted all of it, exhausted it without any remainder, then some of those beings proceed to the [realm of] beasts, some fall into the [realm of] hungry ghosts, and some are reborn in a heavenly realm. If a being was formerly a human who was unfilial to his parents, who had no respect for renunciants and brahmins, behaved dishonestly, did no meritorious acts, and was not afraid of the results that evil deeds bring in the next life—then such a being experiences such undesirable, inconceivably unpleasant and painful results, as in those hells. If [however,] a being was formerly a human who was filial to his parents, who had respect for renunciants and brahmins, behaved hon estly, did meritorious acts, and was afraid of the results that evil deeds bring in the next life—then such a being experiences such desirable, conceivably pleasant and happy results, as in a heavenly palace in the sky. In the past, King Yama made the following aspiration [while] in his pleasure park: when this life ends, may I be reborn in the human realm! If there are very wealthy and prosperous clans, with immeas urable wealth, and possessing in abundance all kinds of livestock,

property, feudatories, and manors—that is, a great clan of _khattiya_ householders, a great clan of brahmin householders, or a great clan of merchant householders, or any other such very wealthy and prosperous clan, with immeasurable wealth, and possessing in abundance all kinds of livestock, property, feudatories, and manors—may I be reborn in such a family! Having been born there, may I develop my faculty of understand- ing, and may I gain pure confidence in the true Dharma and discipline taught by a Tathāgata! Having gained pure confidence, may I shave off hair and beard, don the robes of a monk, leave the household life out of faith, and go forth to practice the path! [Just] as a clansman, who shaves off his hair and beard, dons the robes of a monk, leaves home out of faith, and goes forth to practice the path [in order] to estab- lish the unsurpassable holy life, [so too, may I] in that very life, per- sonally attain understanding and awakening, and dwell having person- ally realized it, knowing as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence.” In the past, King Yama had made this aspiration [while] in his pleasure park; and he recited these verses:

Reprimanded by the divine messengers, A man who has been negligent, Will feel distress and grief for a long time. He is reckoned as hindered by harmful desires. Reprimanded by the divine messengers, A truly superior person, Will not be negligent again, [But will practice] the well-taught, wonderful, noble Dharma. Seeing clinging causes him to be fearful, And to aspire to the extinction of birth and old age. [Once he is] free of clinging, [having] extinguished it without remainder, That is the end of birth and old age. That [person] attains the happiness of peace,

Attains cessation in this lifetime, Transcending all that is fearful, And crossing over this worldly stream. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
