### 110. The [Second] Discourse on Examining One’s Own Mind

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: If a monk is not able to skillfully examine the minds of others, then he should skillfully examine his own mind; in this way he should train himself. How does a monk skillfully examine his own mind?^310 A monk will certainly ensure much benefit for himself if he contem plates thus: “Do I often abide with covetousness, or do I often abide without covetousness? Do I often abide with hatred in the mind, or do I often abide without hatred in the mind? Do I often abide overcome by sloth-and-torpor, or do I often abide not overcome by sloth-and-torpor? Do I often abide with agitation and conceit, or do I often abide without agitation and conceit? Do I often abide with doubt, or do I often abide without doubt? Do I often abide being disputatious, or do I often abide not being disputatious? Do I often abide with a defiled mind, or do I often abide without a defiled mind? Do I often abide with faith or do I often abide without faith? Do I often abide with energy, or do I often abide with laziness? Do I often abide with mindfulness, or do I often abide without mindfulness? Do I often abide with concentration, or do I often abide without concentration? Do I often abide with faulty wisdom, or do I often abide without faulty wisdom?”^311 If, when examining himself, a monk knows: “I often abide with covetous ness... with hatred in the mind... overcome by sloth-and-torpor... with agitation and conceit... with doubt... being disputatious... with a defiled mind... without faith... with laziness... without mindfulness... without concentration... I often abide with faulty wisdom,” then that monk, want ing to eradicate these evil, unwholesome states, should strive quickly by

every means, training with utmost diligence, relentlessly, with right mind- fulness and right comprehension. It is just as a person whose head is on fire or whose clothes are on fire quickly seeks means to save his head and save his clothes. In the same way, a monk who wants to eradicate these evil and unwholesome states should strive quickly by every means, training with utmost diligence, relentlessly, with right mindfulness and right comprehension. If, when examining himself, a monk knows: “I often abide without cov- etousness... without hatred in the mind... not overcome by sloth-and- torpor... without agitation and conceit... without doubt... not being disputatious... without a defiled mind... with faith... with energy... with mindfulness... with concentration... I often abide without faulty wisdom,” then that monk, established in these wholesome states, should strive to realize the higher knowledge of the destruction of the taints.^312 Why do I say of robes that not every one of them can be kept but also say of robes that every one of them can be kept? What kind of robe do I say cannot be kept? If by keeping a [certain] robe evil and unwholesome states increase and wholesome states decrease, then I say that kind of robe cannot be kept. What kind of robe do I say can be kept? If by keeping a [certain] robe wholesome states increase and evil and unwholesome states decrease, then I say that kind of robe can be kept. As with robes, in the same way it is also with food and drink, beds and bedding, villages and towns. I say [further] that one cannot associate with every person, but I also say that one can associate with every person. What kind of person do I say cannot be associated with? If, through association with a [certain] person, evil and unwholesome states increase and wholesome states decrease, then I say that kind of person cannot be associated with. What kind of person do I say can be associated with? If, through association with a [certain] person, wholesome states increase and evil and unwholesome states decrease, then I say that kind of person can be associated with. [Thus] one knows as they really are the qualities to be cultivated, and also knows as they really are the qualities not to be cultivated. Knowing as they really are the qualities to be cultivated and the qualities not to be cultivated, one does not cultivate the qualities that should not be cultivated

but cultivates the qualities that should be cultivated. When one does not cultivate the qualities that should not be cultivated and cultivates the qual ities that should be cultivated, wholesome qualities increase and evil and unwholesome qualities decrease. This is how a monk skillfully examines his own mind, skillfully knows his own mind, skillfully takes up [some qualities] and skillfully gives up [other qualities]. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
