### 185. The Discourse in the Gosiṅga Sāla Forest (2)

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Nādikā, staying in the Brick House. At that time, when the night was over, toward dawn, the World-honored One put on his [outer] robe and took his bowl and entered Nādika to beg for almsfood. Having completed his meal, after noon, he went to the Gosiṅga sāla forest. At that time in the Gosiṅga sāla forest there were three clansmen staying together: the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nandiya, and the venerable Kimbila. Those venerable ones were practicing in the following way.^21 Whichever one of them came back first from begging for almsfood, he would set out the seats, draw water, put out the utensils for washing feet, place the foot mat and the cloth for wiping feet, the water containers, and the jar for bathing. If he was able to finish the food he had collected, he would finish it. If there were leftovers, he would place them in containers, cover

them, and put them aside. Having completed his meal, he would store away his bowl, wash his hands and feet and, with a sitting mat over his shoulder, enter a hut to sit in meditation. Whichever one of them came back last from begging for almsfood would finish the food if he was able to. If it was not enough, he would take enough from the previously leftover food and eat it. If there were leftovers [after he had finished], he would pour them out on to a clear piece of ground or into water that contained no living beings. He would take the eating utensils and, having washed them clean and wiped them, would put them away to one side. He would gather and roll up the sitting mats, collect the foot mat and gather the cloth for wiping feet, put away the utensils for washing feet, the water containers, and the jar for bathing. He would sweep the dining hall with a broom and take out the sweep- ings so that all was clean. He would store away his [outer] robe and bowl, wash his hands and feet, and with a sitting mat over his shoulder, enter a hut to sit in meditation.^22 In the afternoon, whichever one of those venerable ones was the first to rise from sitting in meditation, he would check to see whether the water con- tainers or the jar for bathing were empty, and if they were, he would take them and go and fill them. If he was able to carry them [after filling them], he would carry them back and set them up to one side. If he was not able to carry one of them, then he would beckon to another monk with his hand, and both of them would lift it together, carry it back, and set it up to one side, all without speaking to each other or asking each other anything. Once in every five days those venerable ones would assemble and either discuss the Dharma together or maintain noble silence. As the World-honored One approached [the Gosiṅga _sāla_ forest], the forest warden, seeing him coming in the distance, sought to stop him by calling out:

Renuciant, renunciant, do not enter this forest! Why is that? In this forest there are three clansmen, the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nandiya, and the venerable Kimbila. If they see you, they may disapprove. The World-honored One said, “Forest warden, if they see me, they will certainly approve. They will not disapprove.”

Then, the venerable Anuruddha, seeing from afar that the World-honored One was coming, rebuked the forest warden: Do not admonish the World-honored One, forest warden! Do not admonish the Well-gone One! Why is that? This is our venerable [teacher] who is coming. It is our Well-gone One who is coming. The venerable Anuruddha came out to receive the World-honored One. He took the Buddha’s [outer] robe and bowl. The venerable Nandiya set out a seat for the Buddha, and the venerable Kimbila brought water for the Buddha. Then the Buddha, having washed his hands and feet, sat down on the seat set out by the venerable [Nandiya]. Having sat down, he asked, “Anuruddha, are you always at ease, lacking nothing?” The venerable Anuruddha replied, “World-honored One, I am always at ease, lacking nothing.” The World-honored One asked further, “Anuruddha, how is it that you are at ease, lacking nothing?” The venerable Anuruddha replied: World-honored One, I think to myself: “It is a great gain for me, a great blessing, to have such companions practicing the holy life with me.” World honored One, I constantly practice physical deeds of loving-kindness, whether seen or unseen, toward these companions in the holy life, equally and without discrimination. I practice verbal deeds of loving-kindness... I practice mental deeds of loving-kindness, whether seen or unseen, [toward them], equally and without discrimination. World-honored One, I think to myself: “Let me now set aside my own wishes and follow the wishes of those venerable friends.” Then I set aside my own wishes and follow the wishes of those venerable friends. I never have a single disapproving mental state. World-honored One, it is in this way that I am always at ease, lacking nothing. The venerable Nandiya, on being asked [the same questions], replied in the same way. Then [the Buddha] also asked the venerable Kimbila, “Are you always at ease, lacking nothing?”

The venerable Kimbila said, “World-honored One, I am always at ease, lacking nothing.” [The Buddha] asked, “Kimbila, how is it that you are at ease, lacking nothing?” The venerable Kimbila replied: World-honored One, I think to myself, “It is a great gain for me, a great blessing, to have such companions practicing the holy life with me.” World-honored One, I constantly practice physical deeds of loving-kind- ness, whether seen or unseen, toward these companions in the holy life, equally and without discrimination. I practice verbal deeds of loving- kindness... I practice mental deeds of loving-kindness, whether seen or unseen, [toward them], equally and without discrimination. World-honored One, I think to myself: “Let me now set aside my own wishes and follow the wishes of those venerable friends.” Then I set aside my own wishes and follow the wishes of those venerable friends. I never have a single disapproving mental state. World-honored One, it is in this way that I am always at ease, lacking nothing. The World-honored One praised them, saying: It is well, it is well, Anuruddha, in this way you are constantly together in harmony, at ease and without dissention, of a single mind, of a single teacher, blending like water and milk. Have you [also] attained any superhuman state, a distinction in peaceful happiness, a tranquil abiding? The venerable Anuruddha replied: World-honored One, in this way we are [indeed] constantly together in harmony, at ease without dissention, of a single mind, of a single teacher, blending like water and milk, and we have attained a superhuman state, a distinction in peaceful happiness, a tranquil abiding. World-honored One, secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states... up to... we dwell having attained the fourth absorption. World-honored One, in this way we are [indeed] con- stantly together in harmony, at ease without dissention, of a single mind, of a single teacher, blending like water and milk, and we have attained

this superhuman state, this distinction in peaceful happiness, this tranquil abiding. The World-honored One praised them, saying: It is well, it is well, Anuruddha, on leaving this tranquil abiding, going beyond it, transcending it, do you attain any other superhuman state, a distinction in peaceful happiness, a tranquil abiding? The venerable Anuruddha replied: World-honored One, on leaving this tranquil abiding, going beyond it, transcending it, we do attain another superhuman state, a distinction in peaceful happiness, a tranquil abiding. World-honored One, we dwell pervading one direction with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, likewise the second, the third, and the fourth directions, and also the four intermediate directions, above and below, all around, everywhere. With a mind imbued with loving-kindness, free of fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention, we dwell pervading the entire world [with a mind] that is boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well-cultivated. In the same way... compassion... empathic joy... equa nimity, free from fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention, we dwell pervading the entire world [with a mind] that is boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well-cultivated.^23 World-honored One, on leaving the [afore-mentioned] tranquil abiding, going beyond it, transcending it, we do attain this other superhuman state, this distinction in peaceful happiness, this tranquil abiding. The World-honored One praised them, saying: It is well, it is well, Anuruddha, on leaving this tranquil abiding, going beyond it, transcending it, do you attain any other superhuman state, a distinction in peaceful happiness, a tranquil abiding? The venerable Anuruddha replied: World-honored One, on leaving this tranquil abiding, going beyond it, transcending it, we do attain another superhuman state, a distinction in peaceful happiness, a tranquil abiding.

World-honored One, transcending all perceptions of form... up to... we dwell having attained the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonper- ception. World-honored One, on leaving the [aforementioned] tranquil abiding, going beyond it, transcending it, we attain this other superhuman state, this distinction in peaceful happiness, this tranquil abiding.

The World-honored One praised them, saying:

It is well, it is well, Anuruddha, on leaving this tranquil abiding, going beyond it, transcending it, do you attain any other superhuman state, a distinction in peaceful happiness, a tranquil abiding?

The venerable Anuruddha replied:

World-honored One, on leaving this tranquil abiding, going beyond it, transcending it, we do attain another superhuman state, a distinction in peaceful happiness, a tranquil abiding. World-honored One, we attain the supernormal powers... the knowl- edge of the divine ear... the knowledge of the minds of others... the knowledge of former lives... the knowledge of the passing away and arising [of beings]... and, eradicating the taints, we attain the taintless liberation of the mind and liberation through wisdom, in this very life personally understanding and awakening to it; and we dwell having per- sonally realized it, understanding as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing of existence.”^24 World-honored One, on leaving the [aforementioned] tranquil abiding, going beyond it, transcending it, we attain this other superhuman state, this distinction in peaceful happiness, this tranquil abiding.

The World-honored One praised them, saying:

It is well, it is well, Anuruddha, on leaving this tranquil abiding, going beyond it, transcending it, do you attain any other superhuman state, a distinction in peaceful happiness, a tranquil abiding?

The venerable Anuruddha replied:

World-honored One, on leaving this tranquil abiding, going beyond it,

transcending it, we do not attain another superhuman state, a distinction in peaceful happiness, a tranquil abiding. Then, the World-honored One thought, “These clansmen dwell happily and at ease. Let me now teach them the Dharma.” Having had this thought, the World-honored One taught the Dharma to the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nandiya, and the venerable Kimbila, exhorting and inspiring them, fully delighting them, teaching them the Dharma with countless skillful means. Having exhorted, and inspired them, fully delighting them, he rose from his seat and left. Then the venerable Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila accompanied the World-honored One a little way to see him off and then returned to their dwelling. The venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila praised the venerable Anuruddha, saying:

It is well! It is well, venerable Anuruddha! We have never before heard the venerable Anuruddha say such things, [namely] that we have such great supernormal powers, great and mighty virtue, great merit, great and mighty power. Yet the venerable Anuruddha praised us extremely highly to the World-honored One. The venerable Anuruddha praised the venerable Nandiya and Kimbila, saying:

It is well! It is well, venerable ones! I had never before heard the venerable ones say that they are endowed with great supernormal powers, great and mighty virtue, great merit, great and mighty power. However, through knowing the venerable ones’ minds with my own mind, I have for a long time known that the venerable ones are endowed with great supernormal powers, great and mighty virtue, great merit, great and mighty power.^25 It is for this reason that I said it just like this to the World-honored One. Then, when the night was over, toward dawn, the celestial Dīgha, of fine physique and lofty brilliance, approached the Buddha. Having paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, he stepped back, stood to one side, and said to the World-honored One:

Great Seer, it is of great profit to the Vajjians that the World-honored One is here now and also the three clansmen: the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nandiya, and the venerable Kimbila. The earth spirits, hearing what the celestial Dīgha had said, loudly exclaimed:

Great Seer, it is of great profit to the Vajjians that the World-honored One is present here, and also the three clansmen: the venerable Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila. On hearing this from the earth spirits, the sky _deva_ s, [namely] the Four Heavenly Kings... the _deva_ s of the Thirty-three... the Yāma _deva_ s ... the Tusita _deva_ s... the _deva_ s who delight in creating... and the _deva_ s who wield power over others’ creations instantly relayed this exclamation right up to the Brahmā _deva_ s:

Great Seer, it is of great profit to the Vajjians that the World-honored One is present here, and also the three clansmen: the venerable Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila. The World-honored One replied: It is like this, celestial Dīgha, it is like this. It is of great profit to the Vajjians that the World-honored One is present here, and also the three clansmen: the venerable Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila. Celestial Dīgha, the earth spirits, hearing what you said, loudly exclaimed, “Great Seer, it is of great profit to the Vajjians that the World honored One is present here, and also the three clansmen: the venerable Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila.” On hearing this from the earth spirits, the sky deva s, [namely] the Four Heavenly Kings... the deva s of the Thirty-three... the Yāma deva s... the Tusita deva s... the deva s who delight in creating... and the deva s who wield power over others’ creations, instantly relayed this exclamation right up to the Brahmā deva s, “Great Seer, it is of great profit to the Vajjians that the World-honored One is present here, and also the three clansmen: the venerable Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila.”

Celestial Dīgha, as for the three households which these three clansmen gave up out of faith, shaving off hair and beard, donning the yellow robes, and becoming homeless to train in the path, if the [members of those] three households recollect these three clansmen’s motivation and practice, then they will for a long time attain great profit, ease, and happiness. If [anyone] in that village or town, as well as [any] deva, māra, Brahmā, renunciant, or brahmin, [anyone] from human beings to deva s, recollects these three clansmen’s motivation and practice, then they will for a long time attain great profit, ease, and happiness. Celestial Dīgha, these three clansmen are endowed with great supernormal powers, great and mighty virtue, great merit, great and mighty power. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, those three clansmen and the celestial Dīgha were delighted and received it respectfully.
