### 149. The Discourse on What One Desires

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi, while roaming around in the afternoon, approached the Buddha. Having exchanged friendly greetings, he stepped back, sat to one side, and said, “Gotama, I have a question I would like to ask. Will you listen if I venture to express it?” The World-honored One said, “Feel free to ask.” Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked, “Gotama, what are the desires of war- riors? What do they engage in? What is their support? On what do they depend? What is their end?” The World-honored One replied, “Warriors desire to gain wealth; they engage in wisdom; their support is the use of the sword; they rely on the peo- ple; being in control is their end.”^158 The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked, “Gotama, what are the desires of house- holders? What do they engage in? What is their support? On what do they depend? What is their end?” The World-honored One replied, “Householders desire to gain wealth; they engage in wisdom; their support is their abilities and skills; they rely on doing work; completing the work is their end.” The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked, “Gotama, what are the desires of women? What do they engage in? What is their support? On what do they depend? What is their end?” The World-honored One replied, “Women desire to get a husband and children; they engage in adornment; their support is their sons; they rely on having no rival; being in control is their end.” The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked, “Gotama, what are the desires of thieves? What do they engage in? What is their support? On what do they depend? What is their end?” The World-honored One replied, “Thieves desire to take what is not given; they engage in hiding; their support is the use of the sword; they rely on dark- ness; not being seen is their end.” The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked, “Gotama, what are the desires of brahmins?

What do they engage in? What is their support? On what do they depend? What is their end?” The World-honored One replied, “Brahmins desire to gain wealth; they engage in wisdom; their support is the sacred texts; they rely on the sacrifice; Brahmā is their end.” The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked, “Gotama, what are the desires of renun ciants? What do they engage in? What is their support? On what do they depend? What is their end?” The World-honored One replied, “Renunciants desire to gain the truth; they engage in wisdom; their support is morality; they rely on secluded places; nirvana is their end.”^159 The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi said: World-honored One, I have understood. Well-gone One, I have compre hended. World-honored One, from now on I go for refuge to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha of monks. May the World-honored One accept me as a lay disciple from this day forth until the end of life, as having personally gone for refuge for my whole life. Thus said the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi was delighted and received it respectfully.
