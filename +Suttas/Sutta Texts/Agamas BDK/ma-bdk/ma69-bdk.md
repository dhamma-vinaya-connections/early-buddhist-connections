### 69. The Discourse with the Thirty Analogies

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary, together with a large company of monks, who were observing the rains retreat. At that time, on the fifteenth day [of the half-month], the time for reciting the code of rules, the World-honored One sat down on a seat arranged before the monks. Having sat down, the World-honored One entered meditative absorption and investigated the monks’ minds. Thereupon, the World-honored One saw that the company of monks was sitting in meditation silently, in deep silence, without sloth or torpor, through having eliminated the hindrances; [he saw that] the company of monks was seated in [meditation] that was profound, extremely profound, tranquil, extremely tranquil, excellent, extremely excel- lent. At that time Venerable Sāriputta was also among them. Then the World- honored One said: Sāriputta, the company of monks is sitting in meditation silently, in deep silence, without sloth or torpor, through having eliminated the hindrances. The company of monks is seated in [meditation that is] pro- found, extremely profound, tranquil, extremely tranquil, excellent, extremely excellent. Sāriputta, who can respect and support [such a] company of monks? Thereupon, Venerable Sāriputta got up from his seat, arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder, placed his palms together [in respect] toward the Buddha, and said:

So it is, World-honored One. The company of monks is sitting in med itation silently, in deep silence, without sloth or torpor, through having eliminated the hindrances. The company of monks is seated in [med itation] that is profound, extremely profound, tranquil, extremely tran quil, excellent, extremely excellent. World-honored One, nobody [else] can respect and support [such a] company of monks. Only the World-honored One can respect and support the Dharma and the company of monks, as well as morality, diligence, charity, and concentration. Only the World-honored One can respect and support them. The World-honored One said: So it is, Sāriputta, so it is. Nobody [else] can respect and support [such a] company of monks.
