### 140. The Discourse on the Lowliest

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: Of all kinds of livelihood, the lowliest one by far is begging for almsfood. Worldly people shun it vehemently, speaking of bald-pated ones walking around holding out their bowls. [Yet some] of those clansmen accept it as beneficial. Why is that? Because of disenchantment with birth, aging, disease, death, grief, worry, weeping, sorrow, and distress [they think], “Perhaps by this means I can achieve the ending of this entire great mass of _dukkha._ ” Didn’t you have such an intention when you went forth to train in the path?

Then the monks answered, “That is so.” The World-honored One addressed the monks further:

Ignorant fools may go forth to train in the path with a similar intention, and yet they are serving their desires. They are very heavily contaminated with attachment, mentally polluted and entangled with hatred, envy, and lack of faith. Negligent, lacking right mindfulness, without right concen- tration, with their minds deranged by stupidity and with their faculties distracted, they keep the precepts very loosely. They are not cultivating [the path of] a renunciant and do not advance in their practice. It is as if a person were [trying] to wash out an ink stain with ink, to remove blood with blood, to remove filth with filth, to remove turbidity with turbidity, or to remove excrement with excrement.^95 [This person] is thereby merely increasing the impurity, [going] from obscurity into obscurity, from darkness into darkness. It is the same, I say, with ignorant fools [very loosely] keeping the pre- cepts of a renunciant. That is to say, these people are serving their desires. They are very heavily contaminated with attachment, mentally polluted and entangled with hatred, envy, and lack of faith. Negligent, lacking right mindfulness, without right concentration, with their minds deranged by stupidity and their faculties distracted, they keep the precepts very loosely. They are not cultivating [the path of] a renunciant and do not advance in their practice. It is like the remnants of wood left over from a cremation place in a forest; the burned-out cinders are of no use in the forest and of no use in a village or town. It is the same, I say, with ignorant fools [very loosely] keeping the precepts of a renunciant; for those [people] are serving their desires. They are very heavily contaminated with attachment, mentally polluted, and entangled with hatred, envy, and lack of faith. Negligent, lacking right mindfulness, without right concentration, with their minds deranged by stupidity and their faculties distracted, they keep the precepts very loosely. They are not cultivating [the path of] a renunciant and do not advance in their practice.

Then the World-honored One uttered these verses:

Ignorant fools lose the desires and pleasures [of sensuality] And also lose the benefits of being a renunciant. They completely lose out on both sides, Just like the cinders remaining from a fire. Just as in a forest The cinders remaining from a cremation fire, Are of no use in either forest or village, So it is with a person who has attachment and desire. [This person] is just like the cinders remaining from a fire: Completely losing out on both sides.^96 Thus said the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
