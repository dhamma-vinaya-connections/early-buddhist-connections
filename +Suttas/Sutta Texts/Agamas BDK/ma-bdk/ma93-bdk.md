### 93. Brahmin [Practitioner of] Purification by Bathing^

Thus have I heard. At one time, when the Buddha had just recently attained awakening,^178 he was staying under an ajapāla-nigrodha tree in Uruvelā, by the bank of the Nerañjarā River. At that time there was a brahmin [practitioner of] purification by bathing who, while taking a stroll in the afternoon, approached the Buddha. Seeing that brahmin [practitioner of] purification by bathing coming in the distance, the World-honored One addressed the monks on his account:^179

If someone’s mind is defiled by [any of the] twenty-one defilements, then he will certainly go to a bad realm, take birth in a hell realm.^180 What are the twenty-one defilements? Wrong view is a mental defilement; desire contrary to the Dharma is a mental defilement; covetousness is a mental defilement; [adhering to] wrong teachings is a mental defilement; greed is a mental defilement; anger is a mental defilement; sloth-and-torpor is a mental defilement; rest lessness-and-worry is a mental defilement; doubt is a mental defilement; ill-will is a mental defilement; uncommunicativeness is a mental defilement; avarice is a mental defilement; envy is a mental defilement; deceit is a mental defilement; flattery is a mental defilement; lack of shame is a mental defilement; lack of scruples is a mental defilement; conceit is a mental

defilement; overbearing pride is a mental defilement; arrogance is a mental defilement; negligence is a mental defilement. If someone’s mind is defiled by [any of these] twenty-one defilements, then he will certainly go to a bad realm, taking birth in a hell realm. Suppose that a dirty and stained cloth is given to a dyer [to be dyed]. Having received it, the dyer washes the cloth thoroughly with ash, soap beans, or clay in order to remove the dirt and stains from it. But even though the dyer washes the cloth thoroughly with ash, soap beans, or clay in order to make it clean, the dirty cloth still remains defiled and stained.^181 In the same way, if someone’s mind is defiled by [any of the] twenty one defilements, then he will certainly go to a bad realm, take birth in a hell realm. What are the twenty-one defilements? Wrong view is a mental defilement; desire contrary to the Dharma is a mental defilement; cov etousness is a mental defilement; [adhering to] wrong teachings is a mental defilement; greed is a mental defilement; anger is a mental defilement; sloth-and-torpor is a mental defilement; restlessness-and-worry is a mental defilement; doubt is a mental defilement; ill-will is a mental defilement; uncommunicativeness is a mental defilement; avarice is a mental defile ment; envy is a mental defilement; deceit is a mental defilement; flattery is a mental defilement; lack of shame is a mental defilement; lack of scru ples is a mental defilement; conceit is a mental defilement; overbearing pride is a mental defilement; arrogance is a mental defilement; negligence is a mental defilement. If someone’s mind is defiled by [any of these] twenty-one defilements, then he will certainly go to a bad realm, take birth in a hell realm. If someone’s mind is not defiled by [any of] the twenty-one defilements, then he will certainly go to a good realm, take birth in a heavenly realm. What are the twenty-one defilements? Wrong view is a mental defilement; desire contrary to the Dharma is a mental defilement; covetousness is a mental defilement; [adhering to] wrong teachings is a mental defilement; greed is a mental defilement; anger is a mental defilement; sloth-and-torpor is a mental defilement; restlessness-and-worry is a mental defilement; doubt is a mental defilement; ill-will is a mental defilement; uncommunicativeness is a mental defilement; avarice is a mental defilement; envy is a mental defilement; deceit is a mental defilement; flattery is a mental defilement;

lack of shame is a mental defilement; lack of scruples is a mental defile- ment; conceit is a mental defilement; overbearing pride is a mental defile- ment; arrogance is a mental defilement; negligence is a mental defilement. If someone’s mind is not defiled by [any of these] twenty-one defilements, then he will certainly go to a good realm, take birth in a heavenly realm. Suppose that a clean, white Benares cloth is given to a dyer [to be dyed]. Having received it, the dyer washes the cloth thoroughly with ash, soap beans, or clay in order to clean it. As the dyer thoroughly washes this clean, white Benares cloth with ash, soap beans, or clay in order to make it clean, this clean, white Benares cloth that was already clean becomes even cleaner.^182 In the same way, if someone’s mind is not defiled by [any of] the twenty- one defilements, then he will certainly go to a good realm, take birth in a heavenly realm. What are the twenty-one defilements? Wrong view is a mental defilement; desire contrary to the Dharma is a mental defilement; covetousness is a mental defilement; [adhering to] wrong teachings is a mental defilement; greed is a mental defilement; anger is a mental defile- ment; sloth-and-torpor is a mental defilement; restlessness-and-worry is a mental defilement; doubt is a mental defilement; ill-will is a mental defilement; uncommunicativeness is a mental defilement; avarice is a mental defilement; envy is a mental defilement; deceit is a mental defile- ment; flattery is a mental defilement; lack of shame is a mental defilement; lack of scruples is a mental defilement; conceit is a mental defilement; overbearing pride is a mental defilement; arrogance is a mental defilement; negligence is a mental defilement. If a person’s mind is not defiled by [any of these] twenty-one defilements, he will certainly go to a good realm, take birth in a heavenly realm. If someone knows wrong view to be a mental defilement, then, having known this, he should abandon it. In the same way, if someone knows desire contrary to the Dharma to be a mental defilement,... covetousness to be a mental defilement,... [adhering to] wrong teachings to be a mental defilement,... greed to be a mental defilement,... anger to be a mental defilement,... sloth-and-torpor to be a mental defilement,... restlessness and worry to be a mental defilement,... doubt to be a mental defilement,... ill-will to be a mental defilement,... uncommunicativeness

to be a mental defilement,... avarice to be a mental defilement,... envy to be a mental defilement,... deceit to be a mental defilement,... flattery to be a mental defilement,... lack of shame to be a mental defilement,... lack of scruples to be a mental defilement,... conceit to be a mental defile- ment,... overbearing pride to be a mental defilement,... arrogance to be a mental defilement,... negligence to be a mental defilement, then, having known this, he should abandon it. He imbues the mind with loving-kindness, mentally pervading one direction [with loving-kindness], likewise the second, third, and fourth directions, the four intermediate directions, and also above and below, all around, everywhere. With a mind imbued with loving-kindness, free from fetters or resentment, without ill-will or contention, he dwells having per- vaded the entire world [with a mind] that is boundless, exalted, immeas- urable, and well developed. In the same way, he imbues the mind with compassion,... with empathetic joy,... with equanimity, free from fetters or resentment, without ill-will or contention; he dwells having pervaded the entire world [with a mind] that has become boundless, exalted, immeas- urable, and well developed.^183 Brahmin, this is what is called bathing the inner mind instead of bathing the outer body. Then the brahmin said to the World-honored One, “Gotama, you should go to the Bāhukā River to bathe.” The World-honored One asked, “Brahmin, what do people gain from bathing in the Bāhukā River?” The brahmin replied: Gotama, bathing in the Bāhukā River is a sign of religious purification in the world, a sign of deliverance, a sign of merit. Gotama, one who bathes in the Bāhukā River thereby becomes purified and eliminates all evil. The World-honored One then spoke to the brahmin in verse: Brahmin Sundarika, Entering the Bāhukā River Is a common recreation of fools, Which cannot purify dark deeds.

Sundarika, of what use is going to springs? Of what benefit is the Bāhukā River? If a person performs unwholesome deeds, What good does clean water do him? A pure person has no stains and defilements; A pure person always speaks of morality. A pure person’s clean bright deeds Always lead to pure conduct. If you do not kill living beings, Always abstain from taking what is not given, Speak the truth, do not speak lies, Always have right mindfulness and right comprehension, Then, brahmin, training in this way, All living beings are at peace. Brahmin, why return home [to bathe]? The spring at home purifies no one. Brahmin, you should train In purification through wholesome teachings. What need have you of lowly water, Which removes only bodily filth? The brahmin said to the Buddha, “I also think in this way. I shall purify myself through wholesome teachings. What need have I of lowly water?” Hearing what the Buddha taught, the brahmin was greatly gladdened in mind. He paid homage at the Buddha’s feet, and took refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. The brahmin said:

World-honored One, I have understood. Well-gone One, I have comprehended. I now personally take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. May the World-honored One accept me as a male lay disciple from this day forward until the end of life. I personally take refuge for my whole life.^184 Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the brahmin Sundarika [who practiced] purification through bathing and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
