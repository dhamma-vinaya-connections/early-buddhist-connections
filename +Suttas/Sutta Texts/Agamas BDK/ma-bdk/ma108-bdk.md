### 108. The [Second] Discourse on the Forest

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: A monk who dwells in dependence on a certain forest [contemplates thus]: “While I dwell in dependence on this forest, it may be that I will attain the goal of the renunciant, for the sake of which I have gone forth to train in the path,^303 [also] that everything needed by one who is training in the path— robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that will be obtained easily, without difficulty.”^304 That monk then dwells in dependence on that forest. Having dwelled in dependence on that forest [he contemplates thus]: “The goal of the renunciant, for the sake of which I have gone forth to train in the path, that goal I do not attain, [though] everything needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that is obtained easily, without difficulty.” That monk should contemplate thus: “I have left the household life to train in the path, not for the sake of robes and blankets, not for food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, [that is to say,] not for all the req- uisites of life. While I dwell in dependence on this forest, the goal of the renunciant, for the sake of which I have gone forth to train in the path, that goal I do not attain, [though] everything needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that is obtained easily, without difficulty.” That monk, having contemplated like this, should abandon that forest and leave.

[Again,] a monk who dwells in dependence on a certain forest [con templates thus]: “While I dwell in dependence on this forest, it may be that I will attain the goal of the renunciant, for the sake of which I have gone forth to train in the path, [also] that everything needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bed ding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that will be obtained easily, without difficulty.” That monk then dwells in dependence on that forest, and having dwelled in dependence on that forest [he contemplates thus]: “The goal of the renunciant, for the sake of which I have gone forth to train in the path, that goal I attain, [though] everything needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that is obtained only with great difficulty.” That monk should contemplate thus: “I have left the household life to train in the path, not for the sake of robes and blankets, not for food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, [that is to say,] not for all the requisites of life. While I dwell in dependence on this forest, the goal of the renunciant, for the sake of which I have gone forth to train in the path, that goal I attain, [though] everything needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that is obtained only with great difficulty.” That monk, having contemplated like this, should remain in that forest. [Again,] a monk who dwells in dependence on a certain forest [con templates thus]: “While I dwell in dependence on this forest, it may be that I will attain the goal of the renunciant, for the sake of which I have gone forth to train in the path, [also] that everything needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bed ding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that will be obtained easily, without difficulty.” That monk then dwells in dependence on that forest. Having dwelled in dependence on that forest [he contemplates thus:] “The goal of the renunciant, for the sake of which I have gone forth to train in the path, that goal I do not attain; [also] everything needed by one who is training

in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that is obtained only with great difficulty.” That monk should contemplate thus: “While I dwell in dependence on this forest, the goal of the renunciant, for the sake of which I have gone forth to train in the path, that goal I do not attain; [also] everything needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that is obtained only with great difficulty.” That monk, having contemplated like this, should abandon that forest, even in the middle of the night, and leave without taking leave of others. [Again,] a monk who dwells in dependence on a certain forest [con- templates thus]: “While I dwell in dependence on this forest, it may be that I will attain the goal of the renunciant, for the sake of which I have gone forth to train in the path, [also] that everything needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bed- ding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that will be obtained easily, without difficulty.” That monk then dwells in dependence on that forest. Having dwelled in dependence on that forest [he contemplates thus:] “The goal of the renunciant, for the sake of which I have gone forth to train in the path, that goal I attain; [also] everything needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that is obtained easily, without difficulty.” That monk should contemplate thus: “While I dwell in dependence on this forest, the goal of the renunciant, for the sake of which I have gone forth to train in the path, that goal I attain; [also] everything needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that is obtained easily, without difficulty.” That monk, having contemplated like this, should continue to dwell in dependence on that forest until the end of his life. As with dwelling in dependence on a forest, in the same way it is with dwelling in dependence on a cemetery, on a village or town, or on a person.

Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
