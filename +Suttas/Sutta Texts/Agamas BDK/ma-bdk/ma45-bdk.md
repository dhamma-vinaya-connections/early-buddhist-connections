### 45. The [First] Discourse on Shame and Scruples

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: If a monk is without shame or scruples, this is detrimental to love and respect. Lack of love and respect is detrimental to faith. Lack of faith is detrimental to right attention. Lack of right attention is detrimental to right mindfulness and right attentiveness. Lack of right mindfulness and right attentiveness is detrimental to guarding the sense faculties, keeping the precepts, being without regret, experiencing joy, rapture, tranquility, happiness, concentration, seeing and knowing things as they really are, disenchantment, dispassion, and liberation. And lack of liberation is detrimental to [attaining] nirvana. If, [however,] a monk has shame and scruples, the condition for love and respect exists. If there is love and respect, the condition for

faith exists. If there is faith, the condition for right attention exists. If there is right attention, the condition for right mindfulness and right attentiveness exists. If there is right mindfulness and right attentiveness, the condition exists for guarding the sense faculties, keeping the pre cepts, being without regret, experiencing joy, rapture, tranquility, hap piness, concentration, seeing and knowing things are they really are, disenchantment, dispassion, and liberation. And if there is liberation, the condition exists for [attaining] nirvana. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, those monks were delighted and remembered them well.
