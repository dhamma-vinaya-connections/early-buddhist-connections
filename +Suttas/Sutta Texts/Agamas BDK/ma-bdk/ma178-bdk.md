### 178. The Discourse on the Hunter

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: A hunter who puts out fodder for deer does not have a state of mind like

this: “May the deer become fat! May they look good, be strong, be happy, and live long!” A hunter who puts out fodder for deer has a state of mind like this: “May they come close in order to eat it! Having come close to eat, may they become careless and negligent! Having become negligent, they will come under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s following.”^416 A hunter who puts out fodder for deer has a state of mind like this. The first herd of deer came close in order to eat the hunter’s fodder. Having come close in order to eat it, they became careless and negligent; and having become negligent, they came under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s following. In this way that first herd of deer was unable to escape from the territory [controlled by] the hunter and the hunter’s following. A second herd of deer had this thought: “The first herd of deer came close in order to eat the hunter’s fodder. Having come close in order to eat it, they became careless and negligent; and having become negligent, they came under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s following. In this way the first herd of deer was unable to escape from the territory [controlled by] the hunter and the hunter’s following. Now let us not eat the hunter’s fodder, avoiding it out of fear, and instead depend on the forest for eating grass and drinking water.” Having had this thought, the second herd of deer abandoned the hunter’s fodder, avoiding it out of fear, and depended on the forest for eating grass and drinking water. In the last month of the hot season, when the grass and water came to an end, their bodies became emaciated, their strength declined, and they came under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s following. In this way the second herd of deer too was unable to escape from the territory [con- trolled by] the hunter and the hunter’s following. A third herd of deer had this thought: “The first and second herds of deer were both unable to escape from the territory [controlled by] the hunter and the hunter’s following. Now let us avoid the hunter and the hunter’s following, and instead live in dependence [on a place] not far away. Living not far away, we will not come close in order to eat the hunter’s fodder. Not coming close in order to eat, we will not become careless and negligent; and not becoming negligent, we will not come under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s following.”

Having had this thought, the third herd of deer avoided the hunter and the hunter’s following, living in dependence [on a place] not far away. Living not far away, they did not come close in order to eat the hunter’s fodder; not coming close in order to eat, they did not become careless and negligent; and not becoming negligent, they did not come under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s following. The hunter and the hunter’s following had this thought: “The third herd of deer is very cunning, extremely cunning. Why is that? Even if they eat our fodder, they cannot be caught. Now let us put up a long sur rounding fence. By putting up a long surrounding fence, we will get control over the place in dependence on which the third herd of deer is living.” Having had this thought, the hunter and the hunter’s following put up a long surrounding fence. By putting up this long surrounding fence, they took over the place in dependence on which the third herd of deer was living. In this way the third herd of deer was also unable to escape from the territory [controlled by] the hunter and the hunter’s following. A fourth herd of deer had this thought: “The first, second, and third herds of deer were all unable to escape from the territory [controlled by] the hunter and the hunter’s following. Now let us live in dependence on [a place] that the hunter and the hunter’s following cannot reach. Living in dependence on that [place], we will not come close in order to eat the hunter’s fodder. Not coming close in order to eat, we will not become careless and negligent; and not becoming negligent, we will not come under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s following.” Having had this thought, the fourth herd of deer lived in dependence on [a place] that the hunter and the hunter’s following could not reach. Living in dependence on that [place], they did not come close in order to eat the hunter’s fodder. Not coming close in order to eat, they did not become careless and negligent; and not becoming negligent, they did not come under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s following. The hunter and the hunter’s following had this thought: “The fourth herd of deer is very cunning, supremely cunning. If we were to chase after them, we would certainly not be able to catch them, and the other deer would become frightened and scatter in fear. Now let us abandon the fence and the fourth herd of deer.”^417

Having had this thought, the hunter and the hunter’s following aban- doned the fence. In this way the fourth herd of deer escaped from the ter- ritory [controlled by] the hunter and the hunter’s following. Monks, I have delivered this simile, wishing you to understand its meaning. I will now explain how you should contemplate its meaning. You should know that “the hunter’s fodder” stands for the five strands of sensual pleasure: forms known by the eye, sounds known by the ear, odors known by the nose, flavors known by the tongue, and tangibles known by the body. You should know that “the hunter’s fodder” stands for these five strands of sensual pleasure. You should know that “the hunter” stands for the evil King Māra, and you should know that “the hunter’s following” stands for King Māra’s following. You should know that “the herd of deer” stands for renunciants and brahmins. Renunciants and brahmins of the first [type] come close in order to eat King Māra’s fodder, [that is,] the almsfood offered by the faithful of the world. Coming close in order to eat it, they become careless and negligent; and in becoming negligent they come under the sway of King Māra and King Māra’s following. In this way renunciants and brahmins of the first [type] are unable to escape from the territory [controlled by] King Māra. They are just like the first herd of deer, which came close in order to eat the hunter’s fodder; and having come close in order to eat it, became careless and negligent; and having become negligent, came under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s following. In this way the first herd of deer was unable to escape from the territory [controlled by] the hunter and the hunter’s following. Renunciants and brahmins of the first [type] should be seen as also like this. Renunciants and brahmins of a second [type] have this thought: “Renun- ciants and brahmins of the first [type] come close in order to eat King Māra’s fodder, [that is,] the almsfood offered by the faithful of the world. Having come close in order to eat it, they become careless and negligent; and having become negligent, they come under the sway of King Māra and King Māra’s following. In this way renunciants and brahmins of the first [type] are unable to escape from the territory [controlled by] King Māra and King Māra’s following. Now let us forgo the almsfood offered

by the faithful of the world, avoiding it out of fear, and instead depend on eating fruit and roots in the forest.” Having had this thought, renunciants and brahmins of the second [type] forgo the almsfood offered by the faithful of the world, avoiding it out of fear, and instead depend on eating fruit and roots in the forest. In the last month of the hot season, when all fruit and roots come to an end, their bodies become emaciated, and their strength declines. [Their strength] having declined, their liberation of the mind and liberation by wisdom decline.^418 Their liberation of the mind and liberation by wisdom having declined, they come under the sway of King Māra and King Māra’s following. In this way renunciants and brahmins of the second [type] are unable to escape from the territory [controlled by] King Māra and King Māra’s following. They are just like the second herd of deer, which had this thought: “The first herd of deer came close in order to eat the hunter’s fodder. Having come close in order to eat it, they became careless and negligent; and having become negligent, they came under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s following. In this way the first herd of deer was unable to escape from the territory [controlled by] the hunter and the hunter’s following. Now, let us not eat the hunter’s fodder, avoiding it out of fear, and instead depend on the forest for eating grass and drinking water.” Having had this thought, the second herd of deer abandoned the hunter’s fodder, avoiding it out of fear, and depended on the forest for eating grass and drinking water. In the last month of the hot season, when the grass and water came to an end, their bodies became emaciated, their strength declined, and they came under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s following. In this way the second herd of deer was also unable to escape from the territory [controlled by] the hunter and the hunter’s following. Renunciants and brah mins of the second [type] should be seen as also like this. Renunciants and brahmins of a third [type] have this thought: “Renun ciants and brahmins of the first and second [types] are both unable to escape from the territory [controlled by] King Māra and King Māra’s fol lowing. Now let us avoid King Māra and King Māra’s following, instead living in dependence on [a place] not far away. Living not far away, we will not come close in order to eat the almsfood offered by the faithful of the world. Not coming close in order to eat almsfood, we will not become

careless and negligent; and not becoming negligent, we will not come under the sway of King Māra and King Māra’s following.” Having had this thought, renunciants and brahmins of the third [type] avoid King Māra and King Māra’s following, living in dependence on [a place] not far away. Living not far away, they do not come close to eat the almsfood offered by the faithful of the world; not coming close to eat the almsfood, they do not become careless and negligent; and not becoming negligent, they do not come under the sway of King Māra and King Māra’s following. However, they come to hold [either of] two views: the view of existence or the view of nonexistence.^419 Through holding [either of] these two views, they come under the sway of King Māra and King Māra’s following. In this way renunciants and brahmins of the third [type] are unable to escape from the territory [controlled by] King Māra and King Māra’s following. They are just like the third herd of deer, which had this thought: “The first and second herds of deer were both unable to escape from the territory [controlled by] the hunter and the hunter’s following. Now let us avoid the hunter and the hunter’s following, and instead live in dependence on [a place] not far away. Living not far away, we will not come close in order to eat the hunter’s fodder; not coming close in order to eat, we will not become careless and negligent; and not becoming negligent, we will not come under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s following.” Having had this thought, the third herd of deer avoided the hunter and the hunter’s following, living in dependence on [a place] not far away. Living not far away, they did not come close in order to eat the hunter’s fodder; not coming close in order to eat, they did not become careless and negligent; and not becoming negligent, they did not come under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s following. The hunter and the hunter’s following had this thought: “The third herd of deer is very cunning, extremely cunning. Why is that? Even if they eat our fodder, they cannot be caught. Now let us put up a long surrounding fence. By putting up a long surrounding fence, we will get control over the place in dependence on which the third herd of deer is living.” Having had this thought, the hunter and the hunter’s following put up a long surrounding fence. By putting up a long surrounding fence, they

took over the place in dependence on which the third herd of deer was living. In this way the third herd of deer was also unable to escape from the territory [controlled by] the hunter and the hunter’s following. You should know that being “in dependence on” stands for the view of existence, and “living” stands for the view of nonexistence.^420 Renunciants and brahmins of the third [type] should also be seen like this. Renunciants and brahmins of the fourth [type] have this thought: “Renunciants and brahmins of the first, second, and third [types] are all unable to escape from the territory [controlled by] King Māra and King Māra’s following. Now let us rather live in dependence on [a place] that King Māra and King Māra’s following cannot reach. Living in dependence on such [a place], we will not come close to eat the almsfood offered by the faithful of the world. Not coming close to eat almsfood, we will not become careless and negligent; and not becoming negligent, we will not come under the sway of King Māra and King Māra’s following.” Having had this thought, renunciants and brahmins of the fourth [type] live in dependence on [a place] which King Māra and King Māra’s fol lowing cannot reach. Living in dependence on such [a place], they do not come close to eat the almsfood offered by the faithful of the world; not coming close to eat the almsfood, they do not become careless and neg ligent; and not becoming negligent, they do not come under the sway of King Māra and King Māra’s following. In this way renunciants and brah mins of the fourth [type] escape from the territory [controlled by] King Māra and King Māra’s following. They are just like the fourth herd of deer, which had this thought: "The first, second, and third herds of deer were all unable to escape from the ter ritory [controlled by] the hunter and the hunter’s following. Now let us live in dependence on [a place] that the hunter and the hunter’s following cannot reach. Living in dependence on such [a place], we will not come close in order to eat the hunter’s fodder. Not coming close in order to eat, we will not become careless and negligent; and not becoming negligent, we will not come under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s following.” Having had this thought, the fourth herd of deer lived in dependence on [a place] that the hunter and the hunter’s following could not reach. Living in dependence on such [a place], they did not come close in order

to eat the hunter’s fodder. Not coming close in order to eat it, they did not become careless and negligent; and not becoming negligent, they did not come under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s following. The hunter and the hunter’s following had this thought: “The fourth herd of deer is very cunning, supremely cunning. If we were to chase after them, we would certainly not be able to catch them, and the other deer would become frightened and scatter in fear. Now let us abandon the fence and the fourth herd of deer.” Having had this thought, the hunter and the hunter’s following aban- doned the fence. In this way the fourth herd of deer escaped from the ter- ritory [controlled by] the hunter and the hunter’s following. Renunciants and brahmins of the fourth [type] should also be seen like this. Monks, you should train by living in dependence on places that Māra and King Māra’s following cannot reach. What are the places that King Māra and King Māra’s following cannot reach? Here a monk, secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states... up to... dwells having attained the fourth absorption. These are places that King Māra and King Māra’s following cannot reach. What are other places that King Māra and King Māra’s following cannot reach? Here a monk imbues his mind with loving-kindness. He dwells mentally pervading one direction [with loving-kindness], likewise the sec- ond, the third, and the fourth directions, the four intermediate directions, and also above and below, all around, everywhere. With a mind imbued with loving-kindness—without bondage, resentment, ill will, and con- tention—[with a mind] that has become boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well cultivated, he dwells pervading the entire world. In the same way, he imbues [his mind] with compassion... with altruistic joy... with equa- nimity—without bondage, resentment, ill will, and contention—[with a mind] that has become boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well culti- vated, he dwells pervading the entire world.^421 These are places that King Māra and King Māra’s following cannot reach. What are other places that King Māra and King Māra’s following cannot reach? Here a monk, by completely transcending perceptions of form... up to... dwells having attained the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non- perception. These are places that King Māra and King Māra’s following cannot reach.

What is another place that King Māra and King Māra’s following cannot reach? Here a monk, by completely transcending the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, dwells having attained and per sonally contacted the cessation of perception and knowing, and having seen with wisdom, all his taints are eradicated, and he knows it. This is a place that King Māra and King Māra’s following cannot reach.^422 Monks, dwell in dependence on such places,^423 which King Māra and King Māra’s following cannot reach. You should train like this. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
