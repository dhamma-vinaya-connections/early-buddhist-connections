### 156. The Discourse to the Pārāyana Brahmins

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time a group of brahmins from the Kosala country, who were taking an afternoon walk, approached the Buddha. Having exchanged polite greetings, they stepped back, sat to one side, and said, “Gotama, we would like to ask a question. Will you listen to our question?” The World-honored One said, “Feel free to ask.” Then the brahmins asked, “Gotama, are brahmins now practicing the Dharma of former brahmins or are they transgressing the Dharma of former brahmins?” The World-honored One replied: There are no brahmins now who practice the Dharma of former brahmins. For a long time brahmins have been transgressing the Dharma of former brahmins.

Then the brahmins asked: Gotama, why are no brahmins now practicing the Dharma of former brah mins? Since when have brahmins been transgressing the Dharma of former brahmins? Then the World-honored One said these stanzas:^256 In so-called ancient times there were those Who were self-restrained and intent on their practice. Relinquishing the five strands of sensuality, They practiced the pure holy life. Practicing celibacy and morality Led them to become soft and tender by nature. Their minds shone with forgiveness and harmlessness. Patient and forbearing, they guarded their thoughts. In ancient times this was the Dharma, Which [present-day] brahmins have not preserved. [In ancient times] brahmins did not keep watch over Wealth or grain as their possessions. Chanting [of hymns] was their wealth and grain; This was the treasure that brahmins guarded, [Rather than] variously colored garments, Houses, beds, and couches. [In] prosperous cities and in all countries [The ancient] brahmins trained like this. These brahmins did no harm; They led the way in protecting all things. When they went to others’ doors, No one turned them away. [People] opened their homes [to them] When mealtime came and they went begging.^257 When brahmins were at home, Visitors wished to make offerings to them.

For fully forty-eight years They practiced pure celibacy.

Seeking accomplishment in knowledge and conduct Was the practice of brahmins in ancient times. They did not steal [others’] wealth And they had nothing to fear.

If mutual affection matched up, Then it was proper for them to cohabit, [But] not out of annoyance Or resentment toward sexual customs.

Not all brahmins Were capable of practicing like this. If there were some of outstanding practice, Brahmins extremely firm in their quest, Then they, as regards sexual matters, Did not engage in them even in their dreams.

Because of this practice of celibacy They called themselves brahmins [saying], “I am a brahmin.” Knowing they had this conduct, The wise always recognized them As using thin beds and simple clothes And surviving on ghee and milk as food.

Begging was always done according to the Dharma During a sacrifice and in the ritual of giving. During a sacrifice they did not have others beg for them, But begged for themselves.

When making offerings at a sacrifice, They did not kill cows, Which are like one’s parents or brothers Or one’s other relatives.

Cows are also like human beings. The reason they give rise to happiness

Are the food and drink [they provide, which gives us] bodily strength; As a means of conveyance [they provide] ease and happiness. Understanding this principle, They did not delight in killing cows, Whose soft bodies are so large, With a refined appearance that is renowned. Eagerly seeking their own benefit, The brahmins of ancient times pursued their practice. For their own benefit brahmins Engaged in [some] affairs and abstained from [other] affairs. They had to come into this world, Yet they were committed to liberation from this world. [However] as month succeeded month, Their minds were seen to incline toward that [worldliness]. They enjoyed themselves at night With finely adorned women. They were surrounded by auspicious cows [But also by] very handsome women. The subtle sensual pleasures of society [Became] for brahmins a constant source of longing. Possession of chariots Well-made and finely finished, Household life, and marriage [Became] for brahmins a constant source of longing. Having created this bond, [they thought,] “Come, let us pursue that!” [They then approached the king and said,] “Great king, perform a sacrifice and practice giving! Do not miss [this opportunity] to profit from your wealth, From your abundant property and grain. “If you have surplus [wealth] and cows, Great king, it is appropriate [to expend it on] this:

On brahmins and chariots For an elephant sacrifice, a horse sacrifice, And a cow sacrifice.^258 Do not guard the gates [of your stables].

“Gather crowds and perform a sacrificial giving, With wealth as gifts to brahmins. From this you will gain profit, Beloved and cherished wealth!”

Thus they aroused [the king’s] desire, Increasing his craving more and more For wealth immeasurable Like water in a vast reservoir.

[They thought,] “Men who own cows are in this way Provided with their livelihood.” They created this bondage [with the thought], “Come, let us pursue that!”

[They approached the king again and said,] “Great king, perform a sacrifice and practice giving! Do not miss [this opportunity] to profit from your wealth, From your abundant property and grain.

“If you have surplus wealth, Great king, it is appropriate [to expend it on] this: On brahmins and chariots And countless hundreds and thousands of cows To be killed in a sacrifice.”

The horns on their heads disturbed no one; The cows of ancient times were [harmless] as pigs. Going and seizing them by the horns [Brahmins] took sharp knives and killed the cows.

“Cows are just like our fathers!” Exclaimed a spirit named Fragrance. He cried, “This is against the Dharma!” As they stabbed the cows with knives.

This custom of undertaking sacrifices Was the principal transgression. There is no reason to kill. Stay far away from this decadent custom! In ancient times there were three diseases: Desire, lack of food, and old age.^259 Through hatred of cows Diseases increased to ninety-eight. Such [behavior] caused quarrels to grow, And therefore was disliked by the wise. If people saw such [behavior], Who did not dislike it? Such behavior in this world Lacked wisdom; it was the lowest. Everyone had desire and hatred. Wives even slandered their husbands. Some women of the warrior and brahmin classes, Although guarded by their clans, Violating their birth customs, Became unrestrained in sensual pleasures. Thus, brahmins, brahmins now are not practicing the Dharma of former brahmins. For a long time brahmins have been transgressing the Dharma of former brahmins. Then the group of brahmins from Kosala country said: World-honored One, we have understood. Well-gone One, we have com- prehended.^260 World-honored One, from now on we go for refuge to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha of monks. May the World-honored One accept us as lay disciples from this day forth until the end of life, as having personally gone for refuge for our whole life. Thus said the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the group of brahmins from the Kosala country and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
