### 84. The Discourse on Being without Thorns

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī, in the Gabled Hall beside the Monkey Pond. Well-known virtuous senior elders, great disciples, such as Cāla, Upacāla, Bhadda, Ariṭṭha, Upariṭṭha, and Yasa the supremely praised,^126 such well-known virtuous senior elders, and great

disciples were also staying at Vesālī in the Gabled Hall beside the Monkey Pond. They were all residing near the Buddha, next to his leaf hut. The Licchavis of Vesālī heard that the World-honored One was staying at Vesālī in the Gabled Hall beside the Monkey Pond. They thought, “Let us, with our great power and royal might, loudly singing, go out of Vesālī and approach the Buddha to pay homage.” Then the well-known virtuous senior elders, the great disciples, heard that the Licchavis of Vesālī, with their great power and royal might, and loudly singing, were coming out of Vesālī to approach the Buddha and pay homage. They thought, “Noise is a thorn to absorption. The World-honored One has declared that noise is a thorn to absorption. Let us instead go to Gosiṅga Grove. Staying there we will not be disturbed, and will stay secluded and alone to sit in meditation.” The well-known virtuous senior elders, the great disciples, went to Gosiṅga Grove. There, undisturbed, they stayed secluded and alone to sit in meditation. At that time the Licchavis of Vesālī, with their great power and royal might, loudly singing, went out of Vesālī and approached the Buddha to pay homage.^127 Some of the Licchavis of Vesālī paid homage with their heads at the Buddha’s feet, stepped back, and sat to one side; some exchanged greetings with the Buddha, stepped back, and sat to one side; some extended their hands with palms joined toward the Buddha, stepped back, and sat to one side; and some, seeing the Buddha from afar, remained silent and sat down. Then, when the multitude of Licchavis from Vesālī had all settled down, the World-honored One taught them the Dharma. He exhorted and inspired them, fully delighting them, teaching the Dharma with countless skillful means. Having exhorted and inspired them, and fully delighted them, he became silent. Then the multitude of Licchavis from Vesālī, having been taught the Dharma by the World-honored One, having been exhorted, inspired, and fully delighted, rose from their seats, paid homage with their heads at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and left. Soon after the Licchavis from Vesālī had left, the World-honored One asked the monks, “Where have the senior elders, the great disciples, gone?” The monks replied: World-honored One, the senior elders, the great disciples, heard that the Licchavis of Vesālī, with their great power and royal might, loudly singing,

were coming out of Vesālī to approach the Buddha and pay homage. They thought, “Noise is a thorn to absorption. The World-honored One has declared that noise is a thorn to absorption. Let us instead go to Gosiṅga Grove. Staying there we will not be disturbed, and will stay secluded and alone to sit in meditation.” The World-honored One, the senior elders, the great disciples, all went there together.

On hearing this, the World-honored One praised them, saying:

It is well, it is well that the senior elders, the great disciples, should speak like this: “Noise is a thorn to absorption. The World-honored One has declared that noise is a thorn to absorption.” Why is that? I do indeed speak like this. [Noise is indeed] a thorn to absorption. To one who is keeping morality, breaches of morality are a thorn; to one guarding the senses, bodily adornments are a thorn; to one cultivating [the perception] of foulness, an appearance of purity is a thorn; to one cultivating loving-kindness, anger is a thorn; to one abstaining from liquor, drinking liquor is a thorn; to one leading a celibate life, looking at the female form is a thorn; to one entering the first absorption, noise is a thorn; to one entering the second absorption, [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation ( _vitakka-vicāra_ ) is a thorn; to one entering the third absorp- tion, rapture is a thorn; to one entering the fourth absorption, the inhalations and exhalations are a thorn; to one entering the sphere of [boundless] space, the perception of form is a thorn; to one entering the sphere of [boundless] consciousness, the perception of the sphere of [boundless] space is a thorn; to one entering the sphere of nothingness, the perception of the sphere of [boundless] consciousness is a thorn; to one entering the sphere of [neither-perception-nor-]nonperception, the perception of the sphere of nothingness is a thorn; to one entering the concentration by the cessation of perception and knowing, perception and knowing are a thorn.^128 Again, there are three thorns: the thorn of desire, the thorn of anger, and the thorn of ignorance. An arahant, who has eradicated the taints has already cut off these three thorns, knows that they have been pulled out by the root and destroyed so that they will not arise again. That is, an ara- hant is without thorns; an arahant is separated from thorns; [thus] an arahant is without thorns and separated from thorns.

Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
