### 7. The Discourse on [Sources of] Worldly Merit

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī, in Ghosita’s park. At that time, in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahā Cunda rose from sit ting in meditation and approached the Buddha. On arriving, he paid his respects and, sitting to one side, said: “World-honored One, is it possible to describe [the nature of] worldly merit?” The World-honored One answered: It is possible, Cunda. There are seven [sources of] worldly merit that lead to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit. What are the seven? Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family offers a dwelling place or an assembly hall to the community of monks. This, Cunda, is the first [source] of worldly merit that leads to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit. Again, Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family offers [to those] in that dwelling place beds, seats, woolen blankets, felt mattresses, or bedding. This, Cunda, is the second [source] of worldly merit that leads to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit. Again, Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family offers to all [those] in that dwelling place new, clean robes of superior quality. This, Cunda, is the third [source] of worldly merit that leads to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit. Again, Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family constantly offers to the community in that dwelling place morning rice gruel and the midday meal... providesmonastic park

attendants to serve them... personally approaches the monastic park to make still more offerings, regardless of wind or rain, cold or snow

... [ensures that after] the monks have eaten, their robes do not get soaked^58 by wind or rain, cold or snow, [so that they can] enjoy med- itation and quiet reflection by day and by night. This, Cunda, is the seventh [source] of worldly merit that leads to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit. Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family who has attained these seven [sources] of worldly merit, whether going or coming, whether standing or sitting, whether sleeping or awake, whether by day or by night, their merit will continuously grow, increase, and become more extensive. Cunda, just as, from its emergence at its source to its entry into the great ocean, the river Ganges becomes increasingly deep and increasingly wide, in the same way, Cunda, the merit of a faithful son or daughter of good family who has attained these seven [sources] of worldly merit, whether going or coming, whether standing or sitting, whether sleeping or awake, whether by day or by night, will continuously grow, increase, and become more extensive. Thereupon, Venerable Mahā Cunda rose from his seat and, having bared his right shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground and, placing his palms together [in respect], said: “World-honored One, is it possible to describe [the nature of] merit that transcends the world?” The World-honored One answered: It is possible, Cunda. There are also seven [sources of] merit tran- scending the world that lead to great merit, great reward, great repu- tation, and great benefit. What are the seven? Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family hears that the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata is staying in a certain place. Having heard this, they are delighted and supremely inspired. This, Cunda, is the first [source] of merit transcending the world that leads to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit. Again, Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family hears that the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata intends to come from there to here. Having heard this, they are delighted and supremely inspired. This, Cunda, is the second

[source] of merit transcending the world that leads to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit. Again, Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family hears that the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata has come from there to here. Having heard this, they are delighted and supremely inspired... they personally go to see them and pay their respects with a pure mind... they present offerings to them... having paid their respects and presented offerings, they perform the threefold taking of refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community of monks (Sangha)... they take the precepts. This, Cunda, is the seventh [source] of merit transcending the world that leads to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great ben efit. Cunda, if a faithful son or daughter of good family attains these seven [sources] of worldly merit and also these seven [sources] of merit transcending the world, their merit cannot be measured [in terms of] “so much merit,” “so much fruit of merit,” “so much result of merit”; it just cannot be encompassed, cannot be measured. This great merit cannot be calculated. Cunda, it is just as in [this land of] Jam budīpa there are five rivers, the Ganges being reckoned the first, the Yamunā the second, the Sarabhū the third, the Aciravatī the fourth, and the Mahī the fifth; and upon flowing into the great ocean, once within it, their water cannot be measured as “so many gallons”; it just cannot be encompassed, cannot be measured. This great water cannot be calculated. In the same way, Cunda, if a faithful son or daughter of good family attains these seven [sources of] worldly merit and again these seven [sources of] merit transcending the world, that merit cannot be measured as “so much merit,” “so much fruit of merit,” “so much result of merit”; it just cannot be encompassed, cannot be meas ured. This great merit cannot be calculated. Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: The river Ganges is pure and easily crossed, The ocean, with its many treasures, is king of all waters. Like the river’s water is the honor and respect of people in the world. [Just as] all rivers reach and enter the great ocean, So it is with people who offer robes, food and drink,

Beds, couches, bedding, and seats, Measureless is the fruit of their merit, leading them to a sublime realm, Just like the rivers’ water entering the great ocean. This is what the Buddha said. Venerable Mahā Cunda and the [other] monks heard the Buddha’s words, were delighted, and remembered them well.
