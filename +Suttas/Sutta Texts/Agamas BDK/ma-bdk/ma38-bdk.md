### 38. The [First] Discourse on the Precepts Householder Ugga

Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was at Vesālī, staying in the Great Forest. At that time, the householder Ugga, who was waited on only by women, went out of Vesālī followed by all his women and, [part way] between Vesālī and the Great Forest, enjoyed himself like a king with his concubines. Then the householder Ugga, having become very drunk on alco hol, left the women and went into the Great Forest. The householder Ugga, very drunk on alcohol, saw from afar the World honored One, among the trees of the forest, dignified and beautiful, like the moon amidst the stars, with radiant aura, shining like a golden mountain, endowed with majestic appearance and lofty dignity, with sense faculties calm, free of obstruction, accomplished and disciplined, with his mind calm and quiet. On seeing the Buddha, the householder Ugga sobered up instantly; and, having sobered up, he approached the Buddha. Paying respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet, he sat down to one side. Then the World-honored One taught him the Dharma, exhorted, encouraged, and delighted him. Having with countless skillful means taught [Ugga] the Dharma, having exhorted, encouraged, and delighted him, [he did] as all buddhas do when first teaching the true Dharma to delight their hearers: he taught about gen erosity, virtue, rebirth in heaven, the disadvantages of sensual desire, and the defilement of [continued] birth and death, and he extolled the excellence of dispassion and the purity of the constituents of the path. Having taught him the Dharma in this way, the Buddha knew that [Ugga’s] mind was delighted, prepared, pliant, able to endure, uplifted, one pointed, free of doubt, free of hindrances, capable, and strong enough to receive the true teaching. Then the World-honored One taught him the essence of the true teaching taught by all buddhas: suffering, its arising, its cessation, and the path [leading to its cessation]. Instantly, while seated [right there], the householder Ugga saw the four noble truths: suffering, its arising, its cessation, and the path [leading to its cessation]. Just as a piece of white cloth is easily dyed, so the householder Ugga instantly, while seated [right there], saw the four noble truths: suffering, its arising, its cessation, and the path [leading to its cessation].

Then the householder Ugga, having seen the Dharma, having attained the Dharma, awakened of his own accord to the pure Dharma, cut off doubt and overcame uncertainty. [For him] there was no other teacher; he would no longer follow others. Without hesitation, he abided in the realization of the fruit. In the teaching of the World-honored One he had attained fearlessness. Then the householder Ugga rose from his seat, made obeisance to the Buddha, and said:

World-honored One, I now take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the assembly of monks. May the World-honored One accept me as a lay follower. From this day forth I take refuge [in the Triple Gem] until the end of my life. World-honored One, from this day forth, I [vow to] follow the World-honored One, lead a life of celibacy, and keep the five precepts for the rest of my life. Having [vowed to] follow the World-honored One, lead a life of celibacy, and keep the five precepts for the rest of his life, the householder Ugga paid respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and departed. On returning home, he promptly assembled all the women [of the house]. Having assembled them, he said:

Know that I [have vowed to] follow the World-honored One, lead a life of celibacy, and keep the five precepts for the rest of my life. Who- ever of you wishes to [continue to] live here may do so, practicing gen- erosity and making merit; whoever does not wish to stay may return to her own home; and whoever wishes to be [re]married, I will have you [re]married. Thereupon the first wife said to the householder Ugga: Master, since you [have vowed] to follow the Buddha, lead a life of celibacy, and observe the five precepts for the rest of your life, you may marry me to such and such a man. Then the householder Ugga had that man summoned. With his left hand holding his first wife’s arm and his right hand holding a golden pitcher [for the wedding ceremony], he told that man, “I now marry my first wife to you.”

Hearing this, the man was terrified, and his bodily hair stood on end. He said to the householder Ugga, “Master, do you want to kill me? Do you want to kill me?” The householder replied: I am not going to kill you. However, I [have vowed to] follow the Buddha, lead a life of celibacy, and observe the five precepts for the rest of my life, and for that reason I am marrying my first wife to you. After giving away his first wife, before giving her away, and at the time of giving her away, the householder Ugga had no thought of regret. At that time the World-honored One was surrounded by countless hun dreds and thousands of people. In that great crowd he praised the householder Ugga, [saying]: “The householder Ugga possesses eight extraordinary qual ities.” Then after the night had passed, at dawn, a certain monk put on his robes, took his almsbowl, and went to the house of the householder Ugga. Seeing from afar that a monk was coming, the householder Ugga promptly rose from his seat and arranged his clothes so as to bare one shoulder. Placing his palms together [in respect] toward the monk, he said “Welcome, venerable sir! The venerable one has not come here for a long time. Please take a seat on this bed.” Then the monk took a seat on the bed. The householder Ugga paid respect with his head at the monk’s feet and sat to one side. The monk said: Householder, you have had great gains and great merit. Why is that? Because in an assembly of countless hundreds and thousands of people the World-honored One has praised you, [saying] “The householder Ugga possesses eight extraordinary qualities.” Householder, what are those qualities that you possess? The householder Ugga answered the monk, saying: Venerable sir, [as] the World-honored One previously did not explain this further, I do not know in relation to what the World-honored One said this. In any case, venerable sir, please hear what qualities I possess. At one time, venerable sir, the World-honored One was staying at Vesālī, in the Great Forest. At that time, waited on only by women, I

went out of Vesālī followed by them and, [part way] between Vesālī and the Great Forest, I enjoyed myself like a king with his concubines. At that time, venerable sir, I was very drunk on alcohol. I left the women and went into the Great Forest. At that time, venerable sir, very drunk on alcohol, I saw from afar the World-honored One, among the trees of the forest, dignified and beautiful, like the moon amid the stars, with radiant aura, shining like a golden mountain, endowed with handsome appearance and lofty dig- nity, with sense faculties calm, free of obstruction, accomplished and disciplined, with his mind calm and quiet. On seeing the Buddha, I sobered up instantly. Venerable sir, I possess this quality. The monk spoke in praise, “Householder, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that you possess this quality.” [The householder Ugga said:] Venerable sir, I possess not only this quality. Moreover, venerable sir, having sobered up, I approached the Buddha. Paying respect with my head at the Buddha’s feet, I sat to one side. Then the World-honored One taught me the Dharma, exhorted, encouraged, and delighted me. Having with countless skillful means taught me the Dharma, having exhorted, encouraged, and delighted me, [he did] as all buddhas do when first teaching the true Dharma to delight their hearers: he taught me about generosity, virtue, rebirth in heaven, the disadvantages of sensual desire, and the defilement of [continued] birth and death, extolling the excellence of dispassion and the purity of the constituents of the path. Having taught me the Dharma in this way, the Buddha knew that my mind was delighted, prepared, pliant, able to endure, uplifted, one-pointed, free of doubt, free of hindrances, capable, and strong enough to receive the true teaching. Then the World-honored One taught me the essence of the true teaching taught by all buddhas: suffering, its arising, its cessation, and the path [leading to its cessation]. Instantly, while sitting [right there], I saw the four noble truths, namely: suffering, its arising, its cessation, and the path [leading to its cessation]. Just as a piece of white cloth is easily dyed, so, venerable sir, I instantly, while sitting [right there], saw

the four noble truths, namely: suffering, its arising, its cessation, and the path [leading to its cessation]. Venerable sir, I possess this quality. The monk spoke in praise, “Householder, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that you possess this quality.” [The householder Ugga continued:] Venerable sir, I possess not only this quality. Moreover, venerable sir, having seen the Dharma, having attained the Dharma, I awakened on my own to the pure Dharma, cut off doubt, and overcame uncertainty. [For me] there was no other teacher; I would no longer follow others. Without hesitation, I abided in the realization of the fruit. In the teaching of the World-honored One I had attained fearlessness. Then, venerable sir, I rose from my seat, made obeisance to the Buddha, and said: World-honored One, I now take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the assembly of monks. May the World-honored One accept me as a lay follower. From this day forth I take refuge [in the Triple Gem] until the end of my life. World-honored One, from this day forth, I [vow to] follow the World-honored One, lead a life of celibacy, and observe the five precepts for the rest of my life. Venerable sir, given that I [vowed to] follow the World-honored One, lead a life of celibacy, and observe the five precepts for the rest of my life—and, to my knowledge, have never broken those precepts—I pos- sess this quality, venerable sir. The monk spoke in praise, “Householder, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that you possess this quality.” [The householder Ugga continued:] Venerable sir, I possess not only this quality. Moreover, having [vowed to] follow the World-honored One, lead a life of celibacy, and observe the five precepts for the rest of my life, I paid respect with my head at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and departed. On returning home, I assembled all the women [of the house]. Having assembled them, I said:

Know that I [have vowed to] follow the World-honored One, lead a life of celibacy, and observe the five precepts for the rest of my life? Whoever of you wishes to [continue to] live here may do so, practicing generosity and making merit; whoever does not wish to stay may return to her own home; and whoever wishes to be [re]married, I will have her [re]married. Thereupon my first wife said to me: Master, since you [have vowed] to follow the Buddha, lead a life of celibacy, and observe the five precepts for the rest of your life, you may marry me to such-and-such a man. Then, venerable sir, I promptly had that man summoned. With my left hand holding my first wife’s arm and my right hand holding a golden pitcher, I told that man, “I now marry my first wife to you.” Hearing this, the man was terrified, and his bodily hair stood on end. He said to me, “Master, do you want to kill me? Do you want to kill me?” Venerable sir, I said to him: I am not going to kill you. However, I [have vowed] to follow the Buddha, lead a life of celibacy, and observe the five precepts for the rest of my life, and for that reason I marry my first wife to you. Venerable sir, after giving away my first wife, before giving her away, and at the time of giving her away, I had no thought of regret. Venerable sir, I possess this quality. The monk spoke in praise, “Householder, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that you possess this quality.” [The householder Ugga continued:] Venerable sir, I possess not only this quality. Moreover, venerable sir, when I visit a monastic dwelling, as soon as I see a monk I make obei- sance to him. If he is practicing walking meditation, I follow him in practicing walking meditation. If he is seated, then I sit to one side and, having sat down, I listen to the Dharma. That venerable one teaches the Dharma to me and I also [in turn] teach the Dharma to that venerable

one. That venerable one asks me questions and I also ask him questions. That venerable one answers me and I also answer him. Venerable sir, I do not recall ever having looked down on any monk, whether he is a junior [monk], one of middle rank, or an elder. Venerable sir, I possess this quality. The monk spoke in praise, “Householder, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that you possess this quality.” [The householder Ugga continued:] Venerable sir, I possess not only this quality. Moreover, venerable sir, when I make offerings to the assembly of monks, a deity in the sky informs me thus: Householder, this one is an arahant, this one is on the path to ara- hantship, this one is a non-returner, this one is on the path to non- returning, this one is a once-returner, this one is on the path to once-returning, this one is a stream-enterer, this one is on the path to stream-entry, this one is diligent, this one is not diligent. However, venerable sir, I do not recall that, when making offerings to the assembly of monks, I have ever discriminated among them. Ven- erable sir, I possess this quality. The monk spoke in praise, “Householder, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that you possess this quality.” [The householder Ugga continued:] Venerable sir, I possess not only this quality. Moreover, venerable sir, when I make offerings to the assembly of monks, a deity in the sky informs me thus: Householder, there is the Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened; the teaching of the World-honored One is well taught; the community of nobles of the Tathāgata is progressing well [in the practice]. Venerable sir, not out of faith in that deity’s words, nor out of delight in his words, nor because of having heard it from him, but instead by

my own purified knowledge I know: the Tathāgata is one who is free from attachment, fully awakened; the teaching of the World-honored One is well taught; the community of nobles of the Tathāgata is pro- gressing well [in the practice]. Venerable sir, I possess this quality. The monk spoke in praise, “Householder, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that you possess this quality.” [The householder Ugga continued:] Venerable sir, I possess not only this quality. Moreover, venerable sir, those five lower fetters that the Buddha has declared, namely sensual desire, hatred, view of a self, clinging to precepts, and doubt, I have seen that of these five, which could bind me to returning to this world and entering a womb, not a single one has not been eradicated. Venerable sir, I possess this quality. The monk spoke in praise, “Householder, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that you possess this quality.” The householder Ugga said to the monk, “May the venerable one please take his meal here.” For the householder Ugga’s sake, the monk accepted the invitation by remaining silent. Understanding that the monk had accepted the invitation by remaining silent, the householder Ugga rose from his seat, and personally prepared water for washing. With his own hands he prepared assorted pure and tasty dishes to eat, savor, and digest, making sure there was enough to eat. After [the monk] had finished eating, put aside his bowl, and washed his hands, [Ugga] took a low seat and sat to one side to listen to the Dharma. The monk taught the householder the Dharma, exhorted, encouraged, and delighted him. Having, with countless skillful means, taught him the Dharma, having exhorted, encouraged, and delighted him, [the monk] rose from his seat and departed. He approached the Buddha. Paying respect with his head at [the Buddha’s] feet, he sat down to one side and reported in detail the conversation he had had with the householder Ugga. Then the World-honored One told the monks, “It was for this reason that I praised the householder Ugga, for possessing eight extraordinary qualities.” This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
