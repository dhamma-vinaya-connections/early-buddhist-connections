### 107. The [First] Discourse on the Forest

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: A monk who dwells in dependence on a certain forest [contemplates thus]: “While I am dwelling in dependence on this forest, it may be that, lacking right mindfulness, I will attain right mindfulness; that having a mind with- out concentration, I will attain a concentrated mind; that not being liberated, I will attain liberation; that not having brought the taints to cessation, I will attain the cessation of the taints; that not having attained the unsur- passable peace of nirvana, I will attain nirvana; [also] that everything needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that will be obtained easily, without difficulty.” That monk [therefore] dwells in dependence on that forest. Having dwelled in dependence on that forest, if he was lacking right mindfulness, he does not attain right mindfulness; having a mind without concentration, he does not attain concentration of the mind; not being liberated, he does not attain liberation; not having brought the taints to cessation, he does not attain the cessation of the taints; not having attained the unsurpassable peace of nirvana, he does not attain nirvana; [however] everything needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that is obtained easily, without difficulty.^301 That monk should contemplate thus: “I have left the household life to train in the path, not for the sake of robes and blankets, not for the sake of food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, and also not for the

sake of all the requisites of life. While dwelling in dependence on this forest, lacking right mindfulness, I do not attain right mindfulness; having a mind without concentration, I do not attain a concentrated mind; not being liberated, I do not attain liberation; not having brought the taints to cessation, I do not attain the cessation of the taints; not having attained the unsurpassable peace of nirvana, I do not attain nirvana, [though] every thing needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that is obtained easily, without difficulty.” That monk, having contem plated like this, should abandon that forest and leave. [Again,] a monk who dwells in dependence on a certain forest [con templates thus]: “While I dwell in dependence on this forest, it may be that lacking right mindfulness, I will attain right mindfulness; that having a mind without concentration, I will attain a concentrated mind; that not being liberated, I will attain liberation; that not having brought the taints to cessation, I will attain the cessation of the taints; that not having attained the unsurpassable peace of nirvana, I will attain nirvana; [also] that every thing needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that will be obtained easily, without difficulty.” That monk then dwells in dependence on that forest. Having dwelled in dependence on that forest, lacking right mindfulness, he attains right mindfulness; having a mind without concentration, he attains a concentrated mind; not being liberated, he attains liberation; not having brought the taints to cessation, he attains the cessation of the taints; not having attained the unsurpassable peace of nirvana, he attains nirvana, [though] everything needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that is obtained only with great difficulty. That monk should contemplate thus: “I have left the household life to train in the path, not for the sake of robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, medicine, and also not for the sake of all the requisites of life. While dwelling in dependence on this forest, lacking right mindfulness, I have attained right mindfulness; having a mind without concentration, I

have attained a concentrated mind; not being liberated, I have attained liberation; not having brought the taints to cessation, I have attained the cessation of the taints; not having attained the unsurpassable peace of nir- vana, I have attained nirvana, [though] everything needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that is obtained only with great difficulty.” That monk, having contemplated like this, should remain in that forest. [Again,] a monk who dwells in dependence on a certain forest [con- templates thus]: “While I dwell in dependence on this forest, it may be that lacking right mindfulness, I will attain right mindfulness; that having a mind without concentration, I will attain a concentrated mind; that not being liberated, I will attain liberation; that not having brought the taints to cessation, I will attain the cessation of the taints; that not having attained the unsurpassable peace of nirvana, I will attain nirvana; [also] that every- thing needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that will be obtained easily, without difficulty.” That monk then dwells in dependence on that forest. Having dwelled in dependence on that forest, lacking right mindfulness, he does not attain right mindfulness; having a mind without concentration, he does not attain a concentrated mind; not being liberated, he does not attain liberation; not having brought the taints to cessation, he does not attain cessation of the taints; not having attained the unsurpassable peace of nirvana, he does not attain nirvana; [also] everything needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that is obtained only with great difficulty. That monk should contemplate thus: “While dwelling in dependence on this forest, lacking right mindfulness, I do not attain right mindfulness; having a mind without concentration, I do not attain a concentrated mind; not being liberated, I do not attain liberation; not having brought the taints to cessation, I do not attain cessation of the taints; not having attained the unsurpassable peace of nirvana, I do not attain nirvana; [also] everything needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and

drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that is obtained only with great difficulty.” That monk, having contemplated like this, should abandon that forest, even in the middle of the night, and leave, without taking leave of others. [Again,] a monk who dwells in dependence on a certain forest [con templates thus]: “While I dwell in dependence on this forest, it may be that lacking right mindfulness, I will attain right mindfulness; that having a mind without concentration, I will attain a concentrated mind; that not being liberated, I will attain liberation; that not having brought the taints to cessation, I will attain the cessation of the taints; that not having attained the unsurpassable peace of nirvana, I will attain nirvana; [also] that every thing needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, medicine, and all the requisites of life—all of that will be obtained easily, without difficulty.” That monk then dwells in dependence on that forest. Having dwelled in dependence on that forest, lacking right mindfulness, he attains right mindfulness; having a mind without concentration, he attains a concentrated mind; not being liberated, he attains liberation; not having brought the taints to cessation, he attains the cessation of the taints; not having attained the unsurpassable peace of nirvana, he attains nirvana; [also] everything needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that is obtained easily, without difficulty. That monk should contemplate thus: “While dwelling in dependence on this forest, lacking right mindfulness, I have attained right mindfulness; having a mind without concentration, I have attained a concentrated mind; not being liberated, I have attained liberation; not having brought the taints to cessation, I have attained cessation of the taints; not having attained the unsurpassable peace of nirvana, I have attained nirvana; [also] everything needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life— all of that is obtained easily, without difficulty.” That monk, having con templated like this, should continue to dwell in dependence on that forest until the end of his life.

As with dwelling in dependence on a forest, in the same way it is with dwelling in dependence on a cemetery, on a village or town, or on a person. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
