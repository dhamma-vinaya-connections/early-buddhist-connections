### 217. The Discourse at Aṭṭhakanāgara

Thus have I heard. At one time, not long after the Buddha’s final nirvana, there was a group of well-known and virtuous senior monks staying in the Rooster’s Park near the city of Pāṭaliputta.

At that time the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhakanāgara had gone to Pāṭaliputta bearing many goods of high quality, to do business by selling them. Then the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhakanāgara sold those many goods of high quality quickly and at a large profit, which made him leap up with great joy. Leaving the city of Pāṭaliputta, he went to the Rooster’s Park, the abode of many well-known and virtuous senior monks. He paid homage with his head at their feet, stepped back, and sat to one side. Then the well known and virtuous senior monks taught him the Dharma. They exhorted and inspired him, fully delighting him, teaching him the Dharma with count less skillful means. Having exhorted and inspired him, fully delighting him, they remained silent. Then, after the senior monks had taught him the Dharma, exhorted and inspired him, fully delighting him, the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhakanāgara said, “Venerable sirs, where is the venerable Ānanda now? I would like to go and visit him.”^395 The senior monks answered, “Householder, the venerable Ānanda is now staying in Vesālī, in the Gabled Hall by the Monkey Lake. If you would like to visit him, you can go there.” Then the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhakanāgara rose from his seat, paid homage with his head at the senior monks’ feet, circumambulated them three times, and left. He went to where the venerable Ānanda was. Having paid homage with his head at his feet, stepped back, and sat to one side, he said, “Venerable Ānanda, I would like to ask a question. Am I permitted to ask it?” The venerable Ānanda said, “Householder, ask whatever you wish to ask. Having heard it, I will consider it.” The householder asked: Venerable Ānanda, the World-honored One, the Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened, who had attained the eye of wisdom and had seen the supreme benefit, did he teach one teaching whereby a noble disciple can make an end of all taints without remainder and attain liber ation of the mind? The venerable Ānanda answered, “Yes, he did.” The householder asked:

Venerable Ānanda, what is this one teaching taught by the World-honored One, the Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened, who had attained the eye of wisdom and had seen the highest truth, whereby a noble disciple can make an end of all taints without remainder and attain liberation of the mind?

The venerable Ānanda answered:

Householder, a learned noble disciple secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil, unwholesome states... up to... dwells having attained the fourth absorption. Relying on this attainment, he then contemplates dharmas as dharmas.^396 Relying on this attainment and contemplating dharmas as dharmas, being established in it, he may attain the cessation of the taints. This is possible. If, however, [despite] being established in that, he does not achieve the cessation of the taints, then it may be that, because of [contemplating] this Dharma, because of his desire for the Dharma, his love for the Dharma, his joy in the Dharma, his delight in the Dharma, his enjoyment and delight in it, he cuts off the five lower fetters and will be reborn spontaneously and attain final nirvana there.^397 Attaining the condition of nonreturn, he will never return to this [world]. Again, householder, the learned noble disciple, with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, dwells pervading one direction, likewise the second, the third, and the fourth direction, and also the four intermediate directions, above, and below, all around, everywhere. With a mind imbued with lov- ing-kindness, free of fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention, he dwells pervading the entire world [with a mind] that is boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well-cultivated. In the same way he imbues his mind with compassion... with empathic joy... with equanimity, free of fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention, he dwells per- vading the entire world [with a mind] that is boundless, exalted, immeas- urable, and well-cultivated. Relying on this attainment, he then contemplates dharmas as dharmas. Relying on this attainment and contemplating dharmas as dharmas, being established in it, he may attain the cessation of the taints. This is possible. If, however, [despite] being established in that, he does not attain the cessation

of the taints, then it may be that, because of [contemplating] this Dharma, because of his desire for the Dharma, his love for the Dharma, his joy in the Dharma, his delight in the Dharma, his enjoyment and delight in it, he cuts off the five lower fetters and will be reborn spontaneously <in between> and attain final nirvana there. Attaining the condition of non return, he will never return to this [world]. This is one teaching taught by the Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened, who had attained the eye of wisdom and had seen the highest truth, whereby a noble disciple will make an end of all taints with out remainder and attain liberation of the mind. Again, householder, the learned noble disciple completely transcends perception of form... up to... dwells having attained the sphere of nei ther-perception-nor-nonperception.^398 [Relying] on this attainment, he then contemplates dharmas as dharmas. Relying on this attainment and contem plating dharmas as dharmas, being established in it, he may attain the cessation of the taints. This is possible. If, however, [despite] being established in that, he does not attain the cessation of the taints, then it may be that, because of [contemplating] this Dharma, because of his desire for the Dharma, his love for the Dharma, his joy in the Dharma, his delight in the Dharma, his enjoy ment and delight in it, he cuts off the five lower fetters and will be reborn spontaneously <in between> and attain final nirvana there. Attaining the condition of nonreturn, he will never return to this [world]. This is one teaching taught by the Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened, who had attained the eye of wisdom and had seen the highest truth, whereby a noble disciple will make an end of all taints with out remainder and attain liberation of the mind. Then the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhakanāgara rose from his seat, arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder, extended his hands with joined palms and said: Marvelous, venerable Ānanda! Extraordinary! I asked the venerable Ānanda about one door to the deathless and the venerable Ānanda has at once explained to me twelve Dharma doors to the deathless.^399 Now, by using these twelve Dharma doors, by relying on them, one will certainly emerge to safety.

Venerable Ānanda, it is as if, not far from a village, there were a large house with twelve doors. A man for some reason enters the house, and another man comes along who, not wishing for this man’s benefit, gain, and safety, sets fire to the house. Venerable Ānanda, the man [in the house] will certainly escape through [one of] the twelve doors and reach safety for himself. In the same way, I asked the venerable Ānanda about one door to the deathless and the venerable Ānanda has at once explained to me twelve Dharma doors to the deathless. Now by using these twelve doors, by relying on them, one will certainly emerge to safety. Venerable Ānanda, the teaching and discipline of the brahmins contain unwholesome teachings and disciplines, but even the brahmins make offerings to their teacher. How, then, could I fail to make offerings to the great teacher, the venerable Ānanda! Then the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhakanāgara spent the night preparing an offering of fine dishes, delicious, plentiful, and easy to digest. Having prepared this food, in the morning he spread out sitting mats and invited the monastic communities of both the Rooster’s Park and Vesālī to gather in a certain place. He personally brought water for washing, and with his own hands served up fine dishes, delicious, plentiful, and easy to digest. Having let everybody eat his fill, he put away the utensils and finally brought water for washing. He purchased a building worth five hundred and presented it as a separate gift to the venerable Ānanda. The venerable Ānanda accepted it and presented it for the common use of the sangha.^400 This is what the venerable Ānanda said. Having heard what the venerable Ānanda had said, the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhakanāgara was delighted and received it respectfully.
