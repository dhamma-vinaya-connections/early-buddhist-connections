### 186. The Discourse on Investigating

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling in the Kuru country, in Kammāsadhamma, a town of the Kurus. At that time the World-honored One said to the monks: If someone, relying on his own mind, does not [have the ability to] know the mind of another as it really is, then he cannot know whether the World honored One is rightly and completely awakened. How [then] could he investigate the Tathāgata? Then the monks said to the World-honored One: The World-honored One is the root of the Dharma, the World-honored One is the master of the Dharma, the Dharma comes from the World-hon ored One. May he explain it! Having heard it, we will fully understand its meaning. The Buddha said, “Monks, listen closely and pay proper attention. I will explain it to you in detail.” The monks listened to receive the instruction. The World-honored One said: If someone, relying on his own mind, does not [have the ability to] know the mind of another as it really is, then he should investigate the Tathāgata

in two ways: first through visible forms known by the eye, and second through sounds heard by the ear, [as follows]: “Do defiling mental states knowable through the eye or the ear exist in that venerable one or not?” If, on investigating, one comes to know that defiling mental states knowable through the eye or the ear do not exist in that venerable one, if they are absent, then one should investigate further: “Do mixed mental states knowable through the eye or the ear exist in that venerable one or not?” If, on investigating, one comes to know that mixed mental states knowable through the eye or the ear do not exist in that venerable one, if they are absent, then one should investigate further: “Do pure mental states knowable through the eye or the ear exist in that venerable one or not?” If, on investigating, one comes to know that pure mental states knowable through the eye or the ear do exist in that venerable one, if they are present, then one should investigate further: “Has that venerable one been practicing this Dharma for a long time, or has he been practicing it for just a short time?” If, on investigating, one comes to know that that venerable one has been practicing this Dharma for a long time, not practicing it for just a short time, and if he has been practicing it constantly, then one should investigate further: “Does that venerable one enter meditation for the sake of fame or gain, or does he enter meditation not for the sake of fame or gain?”^27 If, on investigating, one comes to know that that venerable one enters meditation without any evil motive, [then one should investigate further].^28 Suppose someone makes this declaration: “That venerable one delights in the practice. He is without fear. Free from desire, he does not engage in sensuality. [In him] sensual desire has been eradicated.” Then one should ask that [person], “Venerable friend, what is the practice, what is the power, what is the knowledge that enables you, venerable friend, to observe this rightly for yourself and make this declaration: ‘That venerable one delights in the practice. He is without fear. Free from desire, he does not engage in sensuality. [In him] sensual desire has been eradicated’?” Suppose he gives this answer, “Venerable friend, I do not know his mind, nor do I know other things [about him]. Yet, that venerable one— whether he is in seclusion, or among the sangha, or in an assembly—as regards material things, I am able to see that venerable one, [to see] whether

he is progressing well, and whether through progressing well he has become a master. “Although I have not come to know it [directly] myself, I have, by asking him face to face, heard that venerable one say this: ‘I delight in the practice. I am without fear. Free from desire, I do not engage in sen suality. I have eradicated sensual desire.’ “Venerable friend, this is the practice, this is the power, this is the knowledge that enables me to see this rightly for myself and make this declaration: ‘That venerable one delights in the practice. He is without fear. Free from desire, he does not engage in sensuality. In him sensual desire has been eradicated.’” Herein one should further ask the Tathāgata concerning his mental states, whether he has defiling states knowable through the eye or the ear, [or whether] he has realized the attainment in which these states cease completely without remainder; whether he has mixed mental states knowable through the eye or the ear, [or whether] he has realized the attainment in which these states cease completely without remainder; whether he has pure mental states knowable through the eye or the ear, [or whether] he has realized the attainment in which these states cease completely without remainder. The Tathāgata will reply by telling whether he has defiling states knowable through the eye or the ear, [or whether] he has realized the attainment in which these states cease completely without remainder; whether he has mixed states knowable through the eye or the ear, [or whether] he has realized the attainment in which these states cease completely without remainder. As to defiling states knowable through the eye or the ear, the Tathāgata has completely eliminated and uprooted them, so that they will never arise again. As to mixed states knowable through the eye or the ear, the Tathāgata has completely eradicated and uprooted them, so that they will never arise again. As to pure states, just so is my purity, just so is my domain, just so is the [true] renunciant, just so am I accomplished in this true Dharma and discipline. A disciple who has confidence in the Tathāgata goes to visit him. He behaves respectfully toward the Tathāgata and hears the Dharma from the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata teaches him the Dharma, leading him ever higher, to ever more sublime levels, skillfully discarding black and white.

As the Tathāgata teaches him the Dharma, leading him ever higher, to ever more sublime levels, skillfully discarding black and white, [the dis- ciple] hearing it just like this comes to know thoroughly one [particular aspect of the] Dharma. He attains the highest of all [aspects of] the Dharma, gaining pure confidence in the World-honored One [thus]: “The World- honored One is rightly and completely awakened!” Again, one should ask [the disciple], “Venerable friend, what is the practice, what is the power, what is the knowledge, through which you, venerable one, came to know thoroughly one [particular aspect of the] Dharma, attained the highest of all [aspects of the] Dharma, and gained pure confidence in the World-honored One [thus]: ‘The World-honored One is rightly and completely awakened’?” He may answer thus, “Venerable friend, I do not know the mind of the World-honored One, nor do I know other things [about him]. Yet, because of the World-honored One I have such pure confidence. The World-honored One taught me the Dharma, leading me ever higher, to ever more sublime levels, skillfully discarding black and white. “Venerable friend, in whichever way the World-honored One taught me the Dharma, just like this I heard it. Teaching me the Dharma, the Tathāgata led me ever higher, to ever more sublime levels, skillfully dis- carding black and white. Hearing it just like this, I came to know thoroughly one [particular aspect of the] Dharma, attained the highest [aspect of the] Dharma, and gained pure confidence in the World-honored One [thus]: ‘The World-honored One is rightly and completely awakened!’ “Venerable friend, this is the practice, this is the power, this is the knowledge, through which I came to know thoroughly one [particular aspect of the] Dharma, attained the highest [aspect of the] Dharma, and gained pure confidence in the World-honored One [thus]: ‘The World- honored One is fully and completely awakened!’” If one has such practice and such power, and one’s confidence is deeply settled in the Tathāgata, its roots having been established, then this is called confidence that is rooted in seeing, indestructible, and united with knowledge. It cannot be taken away by any renunciant or brahmin, god, _māra,_ or Brahmā, or anyone else in the world. This is how one investigates the Tathāgata, and this is how one comes to fully know the Tathāgata.

Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks delighted in it and remembered it well.
