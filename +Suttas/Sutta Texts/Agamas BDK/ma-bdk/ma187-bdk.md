### 187. The Discourse on Declaring the Knowledge [of Awakening]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: Suppose a monk approaches you and declares that he has attained the knowledge [of awakening]: “I know, as it really is: ‘Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing of existence.’” Hearing this, you should approve of it as good and acceptable, rejoice in it, and receive it respectfully.^30 Having approved of it as good and acceptable, having rejoiced in it and received it respectfully, you should further ask that monk this: “Venerable friend, the World-honored One has spoken of the five aggregates affected by clinging, the bodily form aggre gate affected by clinging... feeling... perception... formations... the consciousness aggregate affected by clinging.^31 Venerable friend, knowing what, seeing what in regard to these five aggregates affected by clinging have you attained knowledge such that, through not clinging, the mind has been liberated by the destruction of the taints?” A monk whose taints are destroyed and who has attained the knowledge of having established the holy life, will properly answer like this: “Venerable friends, the bodily form aggregate affected by clinging is without result, empty and void, it is undesirable, it has no permanent existence, it cannot be relied on, and it is of a changing nature. I know it to be like this. “[Whatever] I had of desire, defilement, attachment, bondage, and underlying tendency to bondage and attachment in regard to the bodily form aggregate affected by clinging, that has ceased, faded away, been extinguished, stopped. Having attained this knowledge, through not cling ing, the mind has been liberated by the destruction of the taints. “In the same way for feeling... perception... formations... the con sciousness aggregate affected by clinging is without result, empty and

void, it is undesirable, it has no permanent existence, it cannot be relied on, and it is of a changing nature. I know it to be like this. “Whatever I had of desire, defilement, attachment, bondage, and under- lying tendency to bondage and attachment in regard to the consciousness aggregate affected by clinging, that has ceased, faded away, been extin- guished, stopped. Having attained this knowledge, through not clinging, the mind has been liberated by the destruction of the taints. “Venerable friends, knowing like this and seeing like this in regard to these five aggregates affected by clinging, I have attained knowledge and, through not clinging, the mind has been liberated by the destruction of the taints.” A monk whose taints are destroyed, who has attained the knowledge of having established the holy life, will properly answer like this. Hearing this, you should approve of it as good and acceptable, rejoice in it, and receive it respectfully. Having approved of it as good and accept- able, having rejoiced in it and received it respectfully, you should further ask that monk this: “Venerable friend, the World-honored One has taught four nutriments due to which living beings are able to exist and continue growing. What are the four? The first is edible food, coarse and fine; the second is contact; the third is volition; and the fourth is consciousness.^32 Venerable friend, knowing what, seeing what in regard to these four nutri- ments have you attained knowledge such that, through not clinging, the mind has been liberated by the destruction of the taints?” A monk, whose taints are destroyed and who has attained the knowledge of having established the holy life, will properly answer like this: “Ven- erable friends, being neither elated nor depressed in regard to edible food, not dependent on it, not bound by it, not defiled by it, and not attached to it, I have attained release, attained emancipation, attained total liberation, freed the mind from the perversions. I know as it really is: ‘Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing of existence.’ “In the same way for contact... volition... being neither mentally elated nor depressed in regard to the nutriment that is consciousness, not dependent on it, not bound by it, not defiled by it, and not attached to it, I have attained release, attained emancipation, attained total liberation,

freed the mind from the perversions. I know as it really is: ‘Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing of existence.’ “Venerable friends, knowing like this and seeing like this in regard to these four nutriments, I attained knowledge and, through not clinging, the mind has been liberated by the destruction of the taints.” A monk, whose taints are destroyed and who has attained the knowledge of having established the holy life, will properly answer like this. Hearing this you should approve of it as good and acceptable, rejoice in it, and receive it respectfully. Having approved of it as good and accept able, having rejoiced in it and received it respectfully, you should further ask that monk this: “Venerable friend, the World-honored One has taught four [ways of] declaring. What are the four? The first is declaring to have seen [what one has] seen; the second is declaring to have heard [what one has] heard; the third is declaring to have experienced [what one has] expe rienced; the fourth is declaring to have come to know [what one has] come to know. Venerable friend, knowing what, seeing what in regard to these four [ways of] declaring have you attained knowledge such that through not clinging, the mind has been liberated by the destruction of the taints?” A monk, whose taints are destroyed and who has attained the knowledge of having established the holy life will properly answer like this: “Venerable friends, being neither elated nor depressed in regard to declaring to have seen [what I have] seen, not depending on it, not bound by it, not defiled by it, not attached to it, I have attained release, attained emancipation, attained total liberation, freed the mind from the perversions. I know as it really is: ‘Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing of existence.’ “In the same way for [declaring] to have heard [what I have] heard... [declaring] to have experienced [what I have] experienced... being neither elated nor depressed in regard to [declaring] to have come to know [what I have] come to know, not dependent on it, not bound by it, not defiled by it, not attached to it, I have attained release, attained emancipation, attained total liberation, freed the mind from the perversions. I know as it really is: ‘Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing of existence.’

“Venerable friends, knowing like this and seeing like this in regard to these four [ways of] declaring, I have attained knowledge and, through not clinging, the mind has been liberated by the destruction of the taints.” A monk, whose taints are destroyed and who has attained the knowledge of having established the holy life, will properly answer like this. Hearing this, you should approve of it as good and acceptable, rejoice in it, and receive it respectfully. Having approved of it as good and accept- able, having rejoiced in it and received it respectfully, you should further ask that monk this: “Venerable friend, the World-honored One has taught six internal sense spheres: the sense sphere of the eye, of the ear, of the nose, of the tongue, of the body, and of the mind. Venerable friend, knowing what, seeing what in regard to these six internal sense spheres have you attained knowledge such that, through not clinging, the mind has been liberated by the destruction of the taints?” A monk, whose taints are destroyed and who has attained the knowledge of having established the holy life, will properly answer like this, “Venerable friends, in regard to the eye, as well as eye consciousness and objects to be experienced by eye consciousness, I have complete knowledge. Having come to know these two aspects [of experience], venerable friends, delight [in regard to] the eye, as well as eye consciousness and objects to be expe- rienced by eye consciousness, has ceased. [Through] that cessation, fading, extinction, and stopping I have attained knowledge and, through not cling- ing, the mind has been liberated by the destruction of the taints. “In the same way for the ear... the nose... the tongue... the body... in regard to the mind as well as mind consciousness and objects to be expe- rienced by mind consciousness, I have complete knowledge. These two aspects [of experience] being known, venerable friends, delight [in regard to] the mind, as well as mind consciousness and objects to be experienced by mind consciousness, has ceased. [Through] that cessation, fading, extinc- tion, and stopping I have attained knowledge and, through not clinging, the mind has been liberated by the destruction of the taints. “Venerable friends, knowing like this and seeing like this in regard to these six internal sense spheres, I have attained knowledge and, through not clinging, the mind has been liberated by the destruction of the taints.”

A monk, whose taints are destroyed and who has attained the knowledge of having established the holy life, will properly answer like this. Hearing this, you should approve of it as good and acceptable, rejoice in it, and receive it respectfully. Having approved of it as good and accept able, having rejoiced in it and received it respectfully, you should further ask that monk this: “Venerable friend, the World-honored One has taught six elements: the earth element, the water element, the fire element, the wind element, the space element, and the consciousness element. Venerable friend, knowing what, seeing what in regard to these six elements have you attained knowledge such that, through not clinging, the mind has been liberated by the destruction of the taints?” A monk, whose taints are destroyed and who has attained the knowledge of having established the holy life, will properly answer like this: “Ven erable friends, I do not see the earth element as mine, nor [do I see] myself as belonging to the earth element, nor [do I see] the earth element as a self. That is to say, [in regard to] these three [types of] clinging that come into existence in dependence on the earth element, [through] the cessation, fading away, extinction, and stopping of any underlying tendency to attach ment,^33 I have attained knowledge and, through not clinging, the mind has been liberated by the destruction of the taints. “In the same way for water... fire... wind... space... I do not see the consciousness element as mine, nor [do I see] myself as belonging to the consciousness element, nor [do I see] the consciousness element as a self. That is to say, [in regard to] the three [types of] clinging that come into existence in dependence on the consciousness element, [through] the cessation, fading away, extinction, and stopping of any underlying tendency to attachment, I have attained knowledge and, through not clinging, the mind has been liberated by the destruction of the taints. “Venerable friends, knowing like this and seeing like this in regard to these six elements, I have attained knowledge and, through not clinging, the mind has been liberated by the destruction of the taints.” A monk, whose taints are destroyed and who has attained the knowledge of having established the holy life, will properly answer like this. Hearing this, you should approve of it as good and acceptable, rejoice in it, and receive it respectfully. Having approved of it as good and acceptable,

having rejoiced in it and received it respectfully, you should further ask that monk this: “Venerable friend, knowing what, seeing what in regard to this internal body with consciousness and all external signs, are ‘I,’ ‘I’- making, and the underling tendency to conceit known to have been totally cut off, uprooted, never to arise again?” A monk, whose taints are destroyed and who has attained the knowledge of having established the holy life, will properly answer like this: “Ven- erable friends, formerly when I had not yet gone forth to train in the path, I felt weary of birth, old age, disease, and death, of sorrow, lamentation, and distress, of worry, mourning, dejection, and grief, and wished to aban- don this great mass of _dukkha._ “Venerable friends, feeling weary of this misery, I had this reflection: ‘Life in the home is extremely confined, a dusty place; going forth to train in the path is [like] emerging into a great open space. For me now, at home, chained by such chains, it is not possible to manifest completely for my [whole] life the practice of the holy life in purity. Let me rather forsake my wealth, little or much, forsake my relatives, few or many, shave off beard and hair, don the yellow robes, and out of faith leave the home life, become homeless, to train in the path.’ “Venerable friends, at a later time I forsook my wealth, little or much, forsook my relatives, few or many, shaved off beard and hair, donned yel- low robes, and out of faith left the home life, became homeless, to train in the path. “Venerable friends, having gone forth to train in the path, having for- saken the signs of being a family [man] and received the essentials of monkhood, I practiced the precepts, guarded [against breaking] the code of rules, and I also adopted proper conduct and manners, always fearing the slightest fault, upholding the essentials of the training. “Venerable friends, I abstained from killing, had abandoned killing, having discarded sword and club. I had a sense of shame and fear of blame, a mind of loving-kindness and compassion, [wishing to] benefit all [beings], including insects. I purified my mind with regard to killing living beings. “I abstained from taking what was not given, had abandoned taking what was not given. I took [only] what was given, delighting in taking [only] what was given. I was always fond of giving with generosity, rejoicing in

it, without stinginess, not expecting a reward. I purified my mind with regard to taking what was not given. “Venerable friends, I abstained from sexual activity, had abandoned sexual activity. I diligently cultivated the practice of celibacy, was energetic in this immaculate conduct, with unsoiled purity, free of sensual desires, having given up sexual desires. I purified my mind with regard to sexual activity. “Venerable friends, I abstained from false speech, had abandoned false speech. I spoke the truth, delighted in the truth, was unshakably established in speaking the truth, was completely trustworthy, not deceiving [anyone in] the world. I purified my mind with regard to false speech. “Venerable friends, I abstained from divisive speech, had abandoned divisive speech. I engaged in speech that was not divisive, that would not harm others. I did not tell those what I had heard here, out of a wish to harm these; nor did I tell these what I had heard there, out of a wish to harm those. I had the wish to unite those that were divided, delighting in their unity. I did not create factions, did not delight in or praise the [forming of] factions. I purified my mind with regard to divisive speech. “Venerable friends, I abstained from harsh speech, had abandoned harsh speech. Whatever speech there is that is rough and rude in tone, offensive words that grate on the ear, that people neither enjoy nor desire, that cause others suffering and vexation and that do not lead to calmness, such speech I had given up. “Whatever speech there is that is clear, peaceful, gentle, and beneficial, that is pleasant to the ear and [easily] enters the mind, that is enjoyable and desirable, that gives others happiness, words endowed with meaning, that do not make others afraid and that lead to calmness in others, such speech I spoke. I purified my mind with regard to harsh speech. “Venerable friends, I abstained from frivolous speech, had abandoned frivolous speech. I spoke at the [proper] time, speaking what is true, what is Dharma, what is meaningful, what is peaceful, delighting in speech that is peaceful in all matters at the proper time and in a proper way,^34 I would teach well and admonish well. I purified my mind with regard to frivolous speech. “Venerable friends, I abstained from earning profits, had abandoned earning profits. I had discarded weights and measures and did not accept

goods [on commission], I did not bind people [with debts], I did not try to cheat with measures, nor did I deceive others for the sake of some small profit. I purified my mind with regard to earning profits. “Venerable friends, I abstained from accepting widows or girls, had abandoned accepting widows or girls. I purified my mind with regard to accepting widows or girls. “Venerable friends, I abstained from accepting servants, had abandoned accepting servants. I purified my mind with regard to accepting servants. “Venerable friends, I abstained from accepting elephants, horses, cattle, or sheep, had abandoned accepting elephants, horses, cattle, or sheep.

I purified my mind with regard to flower garlands, necklaces, perfumes, and cosmetics. “Venerable friends, I abstained from singing, dancing, and acting, and from going to see or hear them; I had abandoned singing, dancing, and acting, and going to see or hear them. I purified my mind with regard to singing, dancing, and acting, and with regard to going to see or hear them. “Venerable friends, I abstained from accepting gold and silver, had

abandoned accepting gold or silver. I purified my mind with regard to accepting gold or silver. “Venerable friends, I abstained from eating after noon, had abandoned eating after noon. I always took a single meal [per day], not eating at night, training in eating at the [proper] time. I purified my mind with regard to eating after noon. “Venerable friends, having accomplished this noble aggregate of virtue I also practiced contentment, taking robes [just] to cover the body, taking food [just] to sustain the physical body. Wherever I went, I took my robes and bowl with me, without concerns or longings. I was like a wild goose that flies through the air with [just] its two wings. “Venerable friends, having accomplished this noble aggregate of virtue and supreme contentment, I also guarded the sense faculties, always mind ful of blocking thoughts of desire, with clear understanding protecting the mind through mindfulness and attaining perfection [therein], constantly striving to arouse the mind. On seeing a form with the eye I did not grasp at its appearance nor did I savor the form. That is to say, for the sake of restraint, I guarded the eye faculty so that no covetousness, sadness, and worry, evil and unwholesome states would arise in the mind. For that pur pose I guarded the eye faculty. “In the same way, on [hearing a sound] with the ear... [smelling an odor] with the nose... [tasting a flavor] with the tongue... [experiencing a tangible] with the body... cognizing a mind-object with the mind I did not grasp at its appearance nor did I savor the mind-object. That is to say, for the sake of restraint, I guarded the mind faculty so that no covetousness, sadness, and worry, evil and unwholesome states would arise in the mind. For that purpose I guarded the mind faculty. “Venerable friends, having accomplished this noble aggregate of virtue and supreme contentment, and this noble guarding of the sense faculties, I practiced right comprehension when going out or coming in, contem plating and distinguishing well when bending or stretching [a limb] or looking down or up; with orderly manners and appearance, I properly wore the outer robe, the other robes, and the bowl; when walking, standing, sitting, and reclining, when sleeping or awake, when talking or keeping silent, I always practiced right comprehension.

“Venerable friends, having accomplished this noble aggregate of virtue and supreme contentment, this noble guarding of the senses, and having attained right comprehension when going out or coming in, I stayed alone in secluded forests, going to an empty peaceful place at the base of a tree, [or to] a mountain cave, [or to] a heap of straw in an open place, or to a forest, or in a cemetery. Venerable friends, dwelling alone and in seclusion in a forest, or having gone to an empty peaceful place at the base of a tree, I would spread the sitting mat and sit down cross-legged with upright body and upright aspiration, and with mindfulness that was not scattered. “I abandoned and removed covetousness. My mind was free of agita- tion. Seeing others’ wealth and requisites of life, I did not give rise to cov- etousness with the wish ‘May I get it!’ I purified my mind of covetousness. In the same way I abandoned ill will... sloth-and-torpor... restlessness- and-worry... doubt and overcame uncertainty. Freeing myself of vacil- lation in regard to wholesome things, I purified my mind of doubt. “Venerable friends, when I had abandoned these five hindrances, which defile the mind and weaken wisdom, secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states... up to... I dwelled having attained the fourth absorption. Venerable friends, when I had thus attained concen- tration, with a mind that was purified and without defilement, without afflic- tion, malleable, well steadied, having attained imperturbability, I directed the mind toward knowledge and realization of the destruction of the taints. “Venerable friends, I knew: ‘This is _dukkha_ ’ as it really is; I knew: ‘This is the arising of _dukkha_ ’; I knew: ‘This is the cessation of _dukkha_ ’; I knew: ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of _dukkha,_ ’ as it really is. “I knew: ‘These are the taints’; I knew: ‘This is the arising of the taints’; I knew: ‘This is the cessation of the taints’; I knew: ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of the taints,’ as it really is. “Knowing like this and seeing like this, the mind was liberated from the taint of sensual desire, from the taint of becoming, and from the taint of ignorance. It being liberated, I knew it was liberated, knowing as it really is: ‘Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing of existence.’ “Venerable friends, knowing like this and seeing like this in regard to this internal body together with consciousness and all external signs. ‘I,’

‘I’-making, I totally abandoned the underlying tendency to conceit. They are known to have been uprooted, never to arise again.” A monk, whose taints are destroyed and who has attained the knowledge of having established the holy life, will properly answer like this. Hearing this, you should approve of it as good and acceptable, rejoice in it, and receive it respectfully. Having approved of it as good and accept able, having rejoiced in it and received it respectfully, you should further tell that monk this: “Venerable friend, at your first declaration we already approved and rejoiced in it. However, we wished to follow as the venerable one [went] higher and higher, to seek out his wisdom and eloquence in replying. It is for this reason that we pursued the venerable one, asking him again and again.”^35 Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
