### 113. The Discourse on the Root of all Phenomena

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: If heterodox practitioners ask you, “What is the root of all phenomena?”, you should answer them in this way, “All phenomena have desire as their root.” If they ask further, “What connects all phenomena?”, you should answer in this way, “Contact connects all phenomena.” If they ask further, “From what do they come?”, you should answer in this way, “They come from feelings.” If they ask further, “Because of what do they exist?”, you should answer in this way, “They exist because of intentions and perceptions.” If they ask further, “What is their leader?”, you should answer in this way, “Mindfulness is their leader.” If they ask further, “What is foremost among them?”, you should answer in this way, “Concentration is foremost among them.” If they ask further, “What is supreme among them?”, you should answer in this way, “Wisdom is supreme among them.” If they ask further: “What is their true [essence]?” you should answer in this way: “Liberation is their true [essence].”

If they ask further, “What is their culmination?”, you should answer in this way, “Nirvana is their culmination.” Thus, monks, desire is the root of all phenomena, contact connects them, they come from feelings, they exist because of intentions and per- ceptions, mindfulness is their leader, concentration is foremost among them, wisdom is supreme among them, liberation is their true [essence], and nirvana is their culmination. Therefore, monks, you should train in this way:^330 practice the mental attitude of [one who has] gone forth to train in the path, practice the perception of impermanence, practice the perception of _dukkha_ in impermanence, practice the perception of not-self in _dukkha,_ practice the perception of impu- rity, practice the perception of the repulsiveness of food, practice the perception of not delighting in the entire world, practice the perception of death. Knowing likes and dislikes in regard to the world, practice perceiving them like this in the mind. Knowing the arising and existence of the world, practice perceiving it like this in the mind. Knowing, as it really is, the world’s arising and ceasing, its attraction, its peril, and the escape from it, practice perceiving it like this in the mind. If a monk is able to practice the mental attitude of [one who has] gone forth to train in the path, then he is able to practice the perception of impermanence, to practice the perception of _dukkha_ in impermanence, to practice the perception of not-self in _dukkha,_ to practice the perception of impurity, to practice the perception of the repulsiveness of food, to practice the perception of not delighting in the entire world, and to practice the perception of death. Knowing likes and dislikes in regard to the world, he is able to practice perceiving them like this in the mind; knowing the arising and existence of the world, he is able to practice perceiving it like this in the mind. If, knowing as it really is, the world’s arising, its ceasing, its attraction, its peril, and the escape from it, he is able to practice perceiving it like this in the mind, then such a monk is said to have abandoned craving and removed the fetters. Having rightly known and rightly contemplated all phenomena, he has attained the end of _dukkha._ Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
