### 59. The Discourse on the Thirty-two Marks

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time, after the midday meal, the monks were sitting together in the assembly hall discussing this topic: Venerable friends, it is most wonderful, most remarkable, that for a great man who is endowed with the thirty-two marks there really and truly are [only] two possibilities: If he lives the home life, he will certainly become a wheel-turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world, freely, as he likes. Being a righteous Dharma king, he attains seven treasures. Those seven treasures are the wheel treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse treasure, the jewel treasure, the woman treasure, the steward treasure, and the counselor treasure— these are the seven. He will have a thousand sons, handsome, brave, fearless, and able to overcome others. He will certainly rule over the whole earth, as far as the ocean, without relying on blade or cudgel, just by teaching the Dharma, bringing peace and happiness. If, [however,] he shaves off his hair and beard, dons the yellow robe, leaves home out of faith, and goes forth to practice the path, then he will certainly become a Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened. His fame will spread and be known in all directions. At that time the World-honored One was sitting in meditation. With the divine ear, which is pure and surpasses human [hearing], he heard the monks, sitting together in the assembly hall after the midday meal, discussing this topic: Venerable friends, it is most wonderful, most remarkable, that for a great man who is endowed with the thirty-two marks there really and truly are [only] two possibilities: If he lives the home life, he will cer tainly become a wheel-turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world, freely, as he likes. Being a righteous Dharma king, he attains seven treasures. Those seven

treasures are the wheel treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse treasure, the jewel treasure, the woman treasure, the steward treasure, and the counselor treasure—these are the seven. He will have a thousand sons, handsome, brave, fearless, and able to overcome others. He will cer- tainly rule over the whole earth, as far as the ocean, without relying on blade or cudgel, just by teaching the Dharma, bringing peace and happiness. If, [however,] he shaves off his hair and beard, dons the yellow robe, leaves home out of faith, and goes forth to practice the path, then he will certainly become a Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened. His fame will spread and be known in all directions. Having heard this, in the afternoon the World-honored One rose from seclusion, went to the assembly hall, and sat down on a seat arranged before the company of monks. He asked the monks, “What topic were you discussing while sitting together in the assembly hall today?” The monks answered: World-honored One, while sitting together in the assembly hall today, we were discussing this topic: Venerable friends, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that for a great man who is endowed with the thirty-two marks there really and truly are [only] two possibilities. If he lives the home life, he will certainly become a wheel-turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world, freely, as he likes. Being a righteous Dharma king, he attains seven treasures. Those seven treasures are the wheel treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse treasure, the jewel treasure, the woman treasure, the steward treasure, and the counselor treasure—these are the seven. He will have a thousand sons, handsome, brave, fearless, and able to overcome others. He will certainly rule over the whole earth, as far as the ocean, without relying on blade or cudgel, just by teaching the Dharma, bringing peace and happiness. If, [however,] he shaves off his hair and beard, dons the yellow robe, leaves home out of faith, and goes forth to practice the path,

then he will certainly become a Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened. His fame will spread and be known in all directions. World-honored One, it was to discuss this topic that we sat together in the assembly hall. Then the World-honored One told them: Monks, would you like to hear from the Tathāgata the thirty-two marks, with which a so-called great man is endowed, [for whom] there are really and truly [only] two possibilities? If he lives the home life, he will certainly become a wheel-turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world, freely, as he likes. Being a righteous Dharma king, he attains seven treasures. Those seven treasures are the wheel treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse treasure, the jewel treasure, the woman treasure, the steward treasure, and the counselor treasure— these are the seven. He will have a thousand sons, handsome, brave, fearless, and able to overcome others. He will certainly rule over the whole earth, as far as the ocean, without relying on blade or cudgel, just by teaching the Dharma, bringing peace and happiness. If, [however,] he shaves off his hair and beard, dons the yellow robe, leaves home out of faith, and goes forth to practice the path, then he will certainly become a Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened. His fame will spread and be known in all directions. Hearing this, the monks replied: World-honored One, this is the right occasion. Well-gone One, this is the right occasion. If the World-honored One would explain to the monks the thirty-two marks, the monks, hearing it, will receive and retain it well. The World-honored One said, “Monks, listen carefully. Listen carefully, and pay proper attention. I will explain it in full for you.” Then the monks listened to receive instruction.

The Buddha said:

A great man’s feet stand flat and even on the earth. This is called a great man’s mark of a great man. Again, the soles of the feet of a great man bear the wheel with a thousand spokes, all complete. This is called a great man’s mark of a great man. Again, the toes of a great man are long and slender. This is called a great man’s mark of a great man. Again, the outline of a great man’s feet is level and straight. This is called a great man’s mark of a great man. Again, the heels and ankles of a great man are equal and full on both sides. This is called a great man’s mark of a great man. Again, both ankles of a great man are even. This is called a great man’s mark of a great man. Again, the body hairs of a great man are turned upward.

Again, the skin of a great man is soft and fine; dust and water do not adhere to it. This is called a great man’s mark of a great man. Again, every single bodily hair of a great man is separate, grows from a single pore, has a dark purple color, and curls to the right like a spiral shell. This is called a great man’s mark of a great man. Again, a great man’s thighs are like those of a royal deer. This is called a great man’s mark of a great man.

Again, a great man’s body is of a golden complexion like pure gold with a purple tinge. This is called a great man’s mark of a great man. Again, the seven parts of a great man’s body are complete. The seven complete parts are the two hands, the two legs, the two shoulders, and the neck. This is called a great man’s mark of a great man.

This is called a great man’s mark of a great man. Again, a great man has white hairs that curl to the right growing between his eyebrows. This is called a great man’s mark of a great man. Monks, for a great man who is endowed with these thirty-two marks there really and truly are [only] two possibilities. If he lives the home life, he will certainly become a wheel-turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world,

freely, as he likes. Being a righteous Dharma king, he attains seven treas- ures. Those seven treasures are the wheel treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse treasure, the jewel treasure, the woman treasure, the steward treasure, and the counselor treasure—these are the seven. He will have a thousand sons, handsome, brave, fearless, and able to overcome others. He will certainly rule over the whole earth, as far as the ocean, without relying on blade or cudgel, just by teaching the Dharma, bringing peace and happiness. If, [however,] he shaves off his hair and beard, dons the yellow robe, leaves home out of faith, and goes forth to practice the path, then he will certainly become a Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened. His fame will spread and be known in all directions. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
