### 5. The Discourse with the Parable of the Heap of Wood

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha, while dwelling among the people of Kosala, was traveling accompanied by a great gathering of monks. At that time the World-honored One, while on the road, suddenly saw in a certain place a great heap of wood, all ablaze, intensely hot. On seeing it, the World-honored One went down from the side of the road, spread his sitting mat under a tree, and sat down cross-legged. Having seated himself, the World-honored One addressed the monks: “Do you see that great heap of wood, all ablaze, intensely hot?” The monks answered: “We see it, World-honored One.” The World-honored One said to the monks: What do you think? To embrace, or to sit or lie [beside] that great heap of wood, all ablaze, intensely hot; or to embrace, or to sit or lie [beside] a woman from the _khattiya_ , brahmin, merchant, or worker [castes], a

woman who is in the full bloom of youth, who has bathed and perfumed herself, has put on bright, clean clothes, is wearing garlands, and has adorned her body with jeweled necklaces—which [of these two] would be the more pleasurable? The monks answered: World-honored One, to embrace, or to sit or lie [beside] that great heap of wood, all ablaze, intensely hot—that would be very painful. World honored One, to embrace, or to sit or lie [beside] a woman from the khattiya , brahmin, merchant, or worker [castes], who is in the fullbloom of youth, who has bathed and perfumed herself, has put on bright clean clothes, is wearing flowers in her hair, and has adorned her body with jeweled necklaces—that, World-honored One, would be very pleasur able. The World-honored One said: I tell you: while training as a renunciant, do not lose the path of the renunciant. If you wish to perfect the holy life, it would be better to embrace that great heap of wood, all ablaze, intensely hot, or to sit or lie [beside it]. Although one would, because of that, experience suffering or even death, yet, one would not, when the body breaks up and life ends, go to a bad realm and be born in hell. If an ignorant person violates the precepts and is lax, giving rise to evil and unwholesome states, not practicing the holy life though professing to practice it,^54 not a renunciant though professing to be a renunciant, if he embraces or sits or lies [beside] a woman from the khattiya , brahmin, merchant, or worker [castes], who is in the full bloom of youth, who has bathed and perfumed herself, has put on bright clean clothes, is wearing garlands, and has adorned her body with jew eled necklaces—that ignorant person will, because of this unwholesome and unbeneficial [conduct], experience the fruits of his evil states for a long time. When the body breaks up and life ends, he will go to a bad realm of existence and be born in hell. For this reason you should contemplate your own benefit, the ben efit of others, and the benefit of both, reflecting thus:

My leaving the household life to train is not in vain, not empty. It has results and fruits that are very agreeable, leading to a long life and to rebirth in good realms of existence. I accept from people, as offerings made in faith, robes, food and drink, bed and bedding, and medicine. May all those donors obtain great merit, great reward, great splendor! You should train like this.

The World-honored One further said to the monks:

What do you think? If a strong man were to take a stout rope or a cord made of hair and pull it around one’s thighs so that it cut the skin, and having cut the skin it cut the flesh, and having cut the flesh it cut the tendons, and having cut the tendons it cut the bone, and having cut the bone it reached the marrow and remained there; or if one were to receive, as an offering made in faith by [someone from] the khattiya , brahmin, merchant, or worker [castes], a massage of one’s body, limbs, hands, and feet, which [of these two] would be the more pleasurable?

The monks answered:

World-honored One, if a strong man were to take a stout rope or a cord made of hair and pull it around one’s thighs so that it cut the skin, and having cut the skin it cut the flesh, and having cut the flesh it cut the tendons, and having cut the tendons it cut the bone, and having cut the bone it reached the marrow and remained there, that would be very painful. World-honored One, if one were to receive, as an offering made in faith by [someone from] the khattiya , brahmin, merchant, or worker [castes], a massage of one’s body, limbs, hands, and feet, that, World-honored One, would be very pleasurable.

cut the flesh, and having cut the flesh it cut the tendons, and having cut the tendons it cut the bone, and having cut the bone it reached the marrow and remained there. Although one would, because of that, experience suffering or even death, yet one would not, when the body breaks up and life ends, go to a bad realm of existence and be born in hell. If an ignorant person violates the precepts and is lax, giving rise to evil and unwholesome states, not practicing the holy life though pro fessing to practice it, not a renunciant though professing to be a renun ciant, if he receives, as an offering made in faith by [someone from] the khattiya , brahmin, merchant, or worker [castes], a massage of his body, limbs, hands, and feet, then that ignorant person will, because of this unwholesome and unbeneficial [conduct], experience the fruits of his evil states for a long time.

I accept from people, as offerings made in faith, robes, food and drink, bed and bedding, and medicine. May all those donors obtain great merit, great reward, great splendor! You should train like this. The World-honored One further said to the monks: What do you think? If a strong man were to cut off one’s leg with a knife that had been sharpened on a whetstone; or if one were to receive, as an offering made in faith by [someone from] the khattiya , brahmin, merchant, or worker [castes], homage, respect, and greetings—which [of these two] would be the more pleasurable? The monks answered: World-honored One, if a strong man were to cut off one’s leg with a knife that had been sharpened on a whetstone, that would be very

painful. World-honored One, if one were to receive, as an offering made in faith by [someone from] the khattiya , brahmin, merchant, or worker [castes], homage, respect, and greetings, that, World-honored One, would be very pleasurable.

The World-honored One further said to the monks:

What do you think? If a strong man were to encase one’s body in iron or copper plates that were all ablaze, intensely hot; or if one were to

receive robes, as an offering made in faith by [someone from] the khat tiya , brahmin, merchant, or worker [castes]—which [of these two] would be the more pleasurable? The monks answered: World-honored One, if a strong man were to encase one’s body in iron or copper plates that were all ablaze, intensely hot, that would be very painful. World-honored One, if one were to receive robes, as an offering made in faith by [someone from] the khattiya , brahmin, merchant, or worker [castes], that, World-honored One, would be very pleasurable.

The World-honored One further said to the monks:

What do you think? If a strong man were to open one’s mouth with a pair of hot iron tongs and then were to place inside one’s mouth an iron ball that was all ablaze, intensely hot; and that hot iron ball were to burn the lips; and having burned the lips, it were to burn the tongue; and having burned the tongue, it were to burn the gums; and having burned the gums, it were to burn the throat; and having burned the throat, it were to burn the heart; and having burned the heart, it were to burn the stomach and intestines; and having burned the stomach and intestines, it were to come out below; or if, [instead,] one were to receive, as an offering made in faith by [someone from] the khattiya , brahmin, merchant, or worker [castes], food with a countless variety of tastes—which [of these two] would be the more pleasurable?

The monks answered:

World-honored One, if a strong man were to open one’s mouth with a pair of hot iron tongs, and then were to place inside one’s mouth an iron ball that was all ablaze, intensely hot; and that hot iron ball were to burn the lips; and having burned the lips, it were to burn the tongue; and having burned the tongue, it were to burn the gums; and having burned the gums, it were to burn the throat; and having burned the throat, it were to burn the heart; and having burned the heart, it were to burn the stomach and intestines; and having burned the stomach and intestines, it were to come out below, that would be very painful.

If a strong man were to take an iron or copper bed that was all ablaze, intensely hot, and then force and compel one to sit or lie on it; or if one were to receive bedding, as an offering made in

faith by [someone from] the khattiya , brahmin, merchant, or worker [castes]—which [of these two] would be the more pleasurable?

If a strong man were to take a great cauldron, of iron or copper, all ablaze, intensely hot, and having taken hold of and lifted up a person, were to turn him upside down and place him in that cauldron; or if one were to receive, as an offering made in faith by [someone from] the khattiya , brahmin, merchant, or worker [castes], a dwelling place, plastered with mud and painted with whitewash, with windows and doors, tight and secure, with a fireplace, warm and cozy^55 —which [of these two] would be the more pleasurable?

You should train like this. As this teaching was being given, sixty monks were liberated from the fetters through cessation of the taints, [while another] sixty monks gave up the precepts and returned to household life. Why is that? The World-honored One’s teaching and admonishment was profound and very difficult, and train- ing in the path is also profound and very difficult. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
