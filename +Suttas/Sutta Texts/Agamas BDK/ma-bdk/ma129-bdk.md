### 129. The Discourse on the Enemy

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: There are seven states of enmity that make for the enmity that comes upon a man or a woman when they become angry. What are the seven? An enemy does not want his enemy to be good-looking. Why is that? [Because] an enemy does not delight in his enemy being good-looking. A person who is angry, who repeatedly becomes angry, who is overcome by anger, and whose mind does not abandon anger has an ugly appearance because of this, even if he is well bathed and his body is anointed with fine fragrance. Why is that? Because he is overcome by anger and his mind does not abandon anger. This is the first state of enmity that makes for the enmity that comes upon a man or woman when they become angry. Again, an enemy does not want his enemy to sleep in peace. Why is that? [Because] an enemy does not delight in his enemy sleeping in peace. A person who is angry, who repeatedly becomes angry, who is overcome by anger, and whose mind does not abandon anger sleeps in distress because of this, even if he is lying on a royal bed upholstered with wool textiles, draped with brocades and fine silk fabrics, with lined and quilted coverlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends. Why is that? Because he is overcome by anger and his mind does not abandon anger. This is the second state of enmity that makes for the enmity that comes upon a man or woman when they become angry. Again, an enemy does not want his enemy to make a large profit. Why is that? [Because] an enemy does not delight in his enemy making a large profit. A person who is angry, who repeatedly becomes angry, who is overcome by anger, and whose mind does not abandon anger does not [try to] make a profit when he should [try to] make a profit, and [tries to] make a profit when he should not [try to] make a profit. In both cases he acts contrary [to what is appropriate], so he has a big loss. Why is that? Because he is

overcome by anger and his mind does not abandon anger. This is the third state of enmity that makes for the enmity that comes upon a man or woman when they become angry. Again, an enemy does not want his enemy to have friends. Why is that? [Because] an enemy does not delight in his enemy having friends. For a person who is angry, who repeatedly becomes angry, who is over come by anger, and whose mind does not abandon anger, if he has good friends they leave him and go away. Why is that? Because he is overcome by anger and his mind does not abandon anger. This is the fourth state of enmity that makes for the enmity that comes upon a man or woman when they become angry. Again, an enemy does not want his enemy to have a good reputation. Why is that? [Because] an enemy does not delight in his enemy having a good reputation. A person who is angry, who repeatedly becomes angry, who is overcome by anger, and whose mind does not abandon anger gains ill fame, a bad reputation, which becomes widely known in all directions. Why is that? Because he is overcome by anger and his mind does not abandon anger. This is the fifth state of enmity that makes for the enmity that comes upon a man or woman when they become angry. Again, an enemy does not want his enemy to be very wealthy. Why is that? [Because] an enemy does not delight in his enemy being very wealthy. A person who is angry, who repeatedly becomes angry, who is overcome by anger, and whose mind does not abandon anger engages in conduct of body, speech, and mind that causes him to lose a great deal of wealth.^416 Why is that? Because he is overcome by anger and his mind does not abandon anger. This is the sixth state of enmity that makes for the enmity that comes upon a man or woman when they become angry. Again, an enemy does not want his enemy, at the breaking up of the body at death, to be certain of going to a good realm of existence, a heav enly world. Why is that? [Because] an enemy does not delight in his enemy going to a good realm of existence. A person who is angry, who repeatedly becomes angry, who is overcome by anger, and whose mind does not abandon anger engages in evil conduct of body, speech, and mind. Having engaged in evil conduct of body,

speech, and mind, at the breaking up of the body at death, he will certainly go to a bad realm of existence, being reborn in hell. Why is that? Because he is overcome by anger and his mind does not abandon anger. This is the seventh state of enmity that makes for the enmity that comes upon a man or woman when they become angry. These are the seven states of enmity that make for the enmity that comes upon a man or woman when they become angry.

Then the World-honored One uttered these verses:

One who is angry acquires an ugly appearance, He sleeps uneasily and in distress. Though he should gain great wealth, He instead incurs loss.

[Even those who were his] close good friends Keep their distance from a person who becomes angry. As he repeatedly becomes angry, His bad reputation spreads in all directions.

He is angry when engaging in activities of body or speech, And entangled in anger when engaging in activities of the mind. A person overcome by anger Loses all his wealth.

Anger produces disadvantage; Anger produces defilement of the mind. Fear arises within [such] a person, Yet he is unable to realize this.

One who is angry does not recognize what is advantageous; One who is angry does not know the Dharma. Lacking sight, blind, enveloped in darkness: Such is the person who delights in anger.

Anger first manifests as an ugly appearance, Just as fire first starts by giving out smoke. From this arise hatred and jealousy; And as a consequence of this, everyone becomes angry.

What an angry person does, Whether wholesome or unwholesome deeds, After having become full of anger,^417 He feels scorched as if burned by fire. What I have called scorching deeds And entangling [mental] states I will now explain one by one. All of you, listen attentively! One who is angry will turn against his father and harm him, And against his brothers too. He will even kill his sisters. So harmful is one who is angry. [The one] who gave birth to him and raised him, Who enabled him to see this world, Who enabled him to survive: his mother. Even her the angry one will harm.^418 Without shame, without scruple, For one who is entangled by anger there is nothing he will [not be ready] to say. For a person overcome by anger, There is nothing [bad] that his mouth will not utter. He performs ignorant and immoral deeds,^419 And takes his own life at a young age. When doing this he lacks self-awareness; Because of anger, terrifying things occur. He is attached to himself, And loves himself extremely; Yet despite loving himself, One who is angry also harms himself. He stabs himself with a knife, Or flings himself off a cliff,

Or hangs himself with a rope, Or takes various kinds of poison. Such is the nature of anger; His death is due to anger. All of this can be abandoned, By understanding it with wisdom. As for tiny unwholesome deeds, A wise person is able to discard them by understanding them. One should be patient with such behavior, If one wishes to be free of ugliness, To be free of anger and free of worry, To remove the smoke of conceit and be free of it, To tame anger and abandon it, To eradicate it completely and be free of the taints. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
