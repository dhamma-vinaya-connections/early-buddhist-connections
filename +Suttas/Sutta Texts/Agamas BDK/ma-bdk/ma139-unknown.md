### 139. The Discourse on the Path of Stillness

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: A young monk who has just been ordained should often approach the path of stillness, to contemplate the signs [of a corpse, namely], the sign of bones, the sign of blue color, the sign of decay, the sign of being devoured [by scavenging animals], and the sign of a skeleton. Having received and retained these signs well, he returns to his dwelling place, washes his hands and feet, spreads his sitting mat, sits down cross-legged on the seat, and recollects these signs, [namely,] the sign of bones, the sign of blue color, the sign of decay, the sign of being devoured, and the sign of a

skeleton. Why is that? If that monk cultivates these signs, he will quickly remove the defects of craving and hatred from his mind.

Then the World-honored One uttered these verses:

If a young monk, In his practice has not yet achieved stilling of the mind, Then he should approach the path of stillness, Wishing to remove his sensual passion, With a mind free of hatred and quarrel, With loving-kindness and compassion for all sentient beings, He pervades all directions.

As he goes [there] to contemplate the [dead] bodies, He should contemplate the sign of blue color, As well as that of decay, Contemplate [the signs of] being devoured by birds and worms, [And the signs of] bones and bone joints linked together.

After cultivating the signs in this way, He returns to his former place, Washes his hands and feet, Spreads his sitting mat, and sits upright on it.

[He] should contemplate, as it truly is, The body, both internally and externally, Filled with excrement and urine, With heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, and so on.

If, wanting to do the almsround, He goes to a village or town, Then, like a general clad in his armor, He constantly keeps right mindfulness before him.

If he sees a visible form as desirable, Associated purely with desire, Then, seeing this, he contemplates it as it really is, With right mindfulness of the Buddha and his Dharma and discipline.

Herein [he contemplates] not bones and tendons, Not flesh and not blood, Not kidneys, heart, liver, and lungs, Not tears, saliva, brain; [Rather, he contemplates] it all as the earth [element], totally empty, And [as] the water element in the same way. Empty entirely is the fire element, The wind element too is empty. If there are any feelings Associated purely with desire, He stills them all, And contemplates them as the wise ones do. In this way he practices energetically, Constantly recollecting the perception of impurity. He totally removes sensual passion, hatred, and delusion. Discarding all ignorance, And arousing pure understanding, The monk attains the end of _dukkha_. Thus said the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
