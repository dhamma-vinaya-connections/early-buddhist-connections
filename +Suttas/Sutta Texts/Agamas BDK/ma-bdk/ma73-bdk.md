### 73. The Discourse on Devas

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling in Sandbank Forest in Ceti country. At that time, the World-honored One told the monks: At a former time, when I had not yet attained realization of the unsurpassable, right, and true awakening, I had this thought, “I would rather give rise [inwardly] to bright light and, because of that bright light, see forms.^32 In this way my knowledge and vision will become supremely bright and pure.” In order that my knowledge and vision became supremely bright and pure, I went to stay in a remote and solitary place, where I practiced dili- gently with a mind free of indolence. Through staying in a remote and solitary place and practicing diligently with a mind free of indolence, I attained bright light and then saw forms. However, I did not meet those _deva_ s, did not exchange greetings with them, did not converse with them, and did not get a response from them. I further had this thought, “I would rather give rise to bright light and, because of that bright light, see forms; and [I wish to] meet those _deva_ s, exchange greetings with them, converse with them, and get a response from them. In this way my knowledge and vision will become supremely bright and pure.” In order that my knowledge and vision became supremely bright and pure, I went to stay in a remote and solitary place, where I practiced dili- gently with a mind free of indolence. Through staying in a remote and solitary place and practicing diligently with a mind free of indolence, I attained bright light and saw forms, and then I met those _deva_ s, exchanged

greetings with them, conversed with them, and got a response from them. However, I did not know the family names of those _deva_ s, their given names, or [the nature of] their births.^33 I further had this thought, “I would rather give rise to bright light and, because of that bright light, see forms; [I wish to] meet those _deva_ s, exchange greetings with them, converse with them, get a response from them, and come to know the family names of those _deva_ s, their given names, and [the nature of] their births. In this way my knowledge and vision will become supremely bright and pure.” In order that my knowledge and vision became supremely bright and pure, I went to stay in a remote and solitary place, where I practiced dili- gently with a mind free of indolence. Through staying in a remote and soli- tary place and practicing diligently with a mind free of indolence, I attained bright light and saw forms; I met those _deva_ s, exchanged greetings with them, conversed with them, and got a response from them; and I came to know the family names of those _deva_ s, their given names, and [the nature of] their births. However, I did not know how those _deva_ s nourished them- selves or what types of pleasure and pain they experienced. I further had this thought, “I would rather give rise to bright light and, because of that bright light, see forms; meet those _deva_ s, exchange greet- ings with them, converse with them, and get a response from them; know the family names of those _deva_ s, their given names, and [the nature of] their births; and come to know how those _deva_ s nourish themselves and what types of pleasure and pain they experience. In this way my knowledge and vision will become supremely bright and pure.” In order that my knowledge and vision became supremely bright and pure, I went to stay in a remote and solitary place, where I practiced diligently with a mind free of indolence. Through staying in a remote and solitary place and practicing diligently with a mind free of indolence, I attained bright light and saw forms; I met those _deva_ s, exchanged greetings with them, conversed with them, and got a response from them; I knew the family names of those _deva_ s, their given names, and [the nature of] their births; and I came to know how those _deva_ s nourished themselves and what types of pleasure and pain they experienced. However, I did not know the life span of those _deva_ s, how long they will remain, and how their lives will end.

I further had this thought, “I would rather give rise to bright light and, because of that bright light, see forms; meet those deva s, exchange greet ings with them, converse with them, and get a response from them; know the family names of those deva s, their given names, and [the nature of] their births; know how those deva s nourish themselves and what types of pleasure and pain they experience; and know the life span of those deva s, how long they will remain, and how their lives will end. In this way my knowledge and vision will become supremely bright and pure.” In order that my knowledge and vision would become supremely bright and pure, I went to stay in a remote and solitary place, where I practiced diligently with a mind free of indolence.

However, I did not know that those deva s had done such and such kinds of deeds that caused them to be reborn there after dying here.^34 I further had this thought, “I would rather give rise to bright light and, because of that bright light, see forms; meet those deva s, exchange greet ings with them, converse with them, and get a response from them; know the family names of those deva s, their given names, and [the nature of] their births; know how those deva s nourish themselves and what types of pleasure and pain they experience; know the life span of those deva s, how long they will remain, and how their lives will end; and come to know that those deva s did such and such kinds of deeds that caused them to be reborn there after dying here.

However, I did not recognize [individual] _deva_ s among these and those _deva_ s.^35 I further had this thought, “I would rather give rise to bright light and, because of that bright light, see forms; meet those _deva_ s, exchange greet- ings with them, converse with them, and get a response from them; know the family names of those _deva_ s, their given names, and [the nature of] their births; know how those _deva_ s nourish themselves and what types of pleasure and pain they experience; know the life span of those _deva_ s, how long they will remain, and how their lives will end; know that those _deva_ s had done such and such kinds of deeds that caused them to be reborn there after dying here; and recognize [individual] _deva_ s among these and those _deva_ s.

However, I did not know whether or not I had ever pre- viously taken birth in those heavens. I further had this thought, “I would rather give rise to bright light and, because of that bright light, see forms; meet those _deva_ s, exchange greetings

with them, converse with them, and get a response from them; know the family names of those deva s, their given names, and [the nature of] their births; know how those deva s nourish themselves and what types of pleas ure and pain they experience; know the life span of those deva s, how long they will remain, and how their lives will end; know that those deva s had done such and such kinds of deeds that caused them to be reborn there after dying here; recognize [individual] deva s among these and those deva s; and know whether or not I had previously taken birth in those heav ens. In this way my knowledge and vision will become supremely bright and pure.” In order that my knowledge and vision would become supremely bright and pure, I went to stay in a remote and solitary place, where I practiced diligently with a mind free of indolence.

So long as I had not rightly come to know these eight courses, I could not claim with certainty to have attained them. [Since] I also did not understand having attained realization of the unsur passable, right, and true awakening, I was unable to transcend this world with its deva s, māra s, Brahmās, renunciants, and brahmins; and I also was unable to be freed through the various liberations. I did not become separated from all distortions and did not come to know as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing of existence.” Once I had rightly come to know these eight courses, then I could claim with certainty to have attained them.

I was separated from all distortions and knew as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done. There will not be another experiencing of existence.” Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
