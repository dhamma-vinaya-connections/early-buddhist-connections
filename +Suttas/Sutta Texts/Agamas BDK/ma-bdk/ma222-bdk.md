He abandons... up to... the five hindrances, which defile the mind and weaken wisdom; and he internally contemplates the body as a body, con templates feeling... mental states... dharmas as dharmas. This is how a person who wants to abandon ignorance should develop the four estab lishments of mindfulness.

### Appendix

## Tables of Parallels

### Compiled by Roderick S. Bucknell

Readers familiar with the Pāli texts may find it instructive to compare the dis- courses translated here with their Pāli counterparts. To facilitate such comparison the following two tables are provided: Table 1 is designed for finding the Pāli parallel(s) to a given _Madhyama-āgama_ discourse, and Table 2 for finding the _Madhyama-āgama_ parallel(s) to a given discourse contained in the Pāli canon.^406 In Table 1 the first column identifies each _Madhyama-āgama_ discourse by its serial number (from MĀ 1 to MĀ 222) and its translated title. Only those discourses are listed which have known Pāli parallels; for example, _Madhyama- āgama_ discourse no. 7 (MĀ 7) is absent because it has no known Pāli parallel.^407 The second column displays: (1) the location of the listed discourse in the Taishō Tripiṭaka edition (T) by volume, page number, and register (a, b, or c); and (2) immediately below this, the location of the English translation within the present four-volume set (BDK English Tripiṭaka Series), cited by volume and page num- ber. The third column lists known parallel discourses contained in the Pāli canon. The fourth column shows the location of each of those parallels. Partial parallels are marked with an asterisk * and listed after full parallels. The eighteen divisions into which the _Madhyama-āgama_ discourses are traditionally grouped are readily identified by their headings, each showing the relevant division number and title. This means that Table 1 can also serve as a guide to the overall structure of the _Madhyama-āgama._ Table 2 amounts to a mirror image of Table 1, listing Pāli discourses on the left and their _Madhyama-āgama_ parallels on the right. Accordingly, it has four sections corresponding to the four main Pāli Nikāyas, together with a small fifth section to accommodate the few known parallels found in the _Khuddaka-nikāya_ or in the Vinaya. Only those Pāli discourses are listed for which known parallels exist in the _Madhyama-āgama._

## Appendix: Tables of Parallels

In both tables, the pagination and numbering of Pāli discourses are as in the PTS editions, with _Saṃyutta-nikāya,_ Vol. I conforming to M. Léon Feer’s 1884 edition. These tables are not intended to be exhaustive. Most notably, they do not list parallels in Chinese other than those contained in the _Madhyama-āgama,_ nor do they list parallels preserved in languages other than Chinese and Pāli. Additional Chinese parallels and fragmentary Sanskrit parallels can be found in the detailed survey by Jin-il Chung and Takamichi Fukita, _A Survey of the Sanskrit Fragments Corresponding to the Chinese Madhyamāgama, Including References to Sanskrit Parallels, Citations, Numerical Categories of Doctrinal Concepts and Stock Phrase_ s (Tokyo: Sankibo Press, 2011). Tibetan parallels preserved in Śamathadeva’s _Abhidharmakośopāyikāṭīkā_ are listed in Yoshifumi Honjō, _A Table of Āgama Citations in the Abhidharmakośa and the Abhidhar- makośopāyikā_ (Kyoto: n.p., 1984).

### Further Evidence of Structural Change

The introduction to this volume has presented preliminary evidence that both the _Madhyama-āgama_ and the _Majjhima-nikāya_ have undergone extensive structural change with the passage of time. Such evidence comes mainly from the two tables of discourse parallels presented below. The following paragraphs will show how close examination of these tables can yield further data of this kind. The examination begins with Table 2, specifically its second section, headed “2. Pāli Discourses in the _Majjhima-nikāya._ ” Of the one hundred and fifty-two discourses that make up the _Majjhima-nikāya,_ only ninety-five have parallels in the _Madhyama-āgama;_ of the remaining fifty-seven, some have Chinese parallels outside of the _Madhyama-āgama_ and some have no known parallel at all. In Table 2 these cases of missing _Madhyama-āgama_ parallels manifest as gaps in the series of identifiers in the first column of section 2. For example, “MN 4” is missing from that column, since no _Madhyama-āgama_ parallel for MN 4 is known. Whereas most of the _Majjhima-nikāya_ discourses that lack _Madhyama-āgama_ parallels appear to be randomly scattered through the total set of one hundred and fifty-two, the last ten of them, numbered 143 to 152, are placed together as a continuous block at the end of the list. To express it differently: in Table 2 the series of _Majjhima-nikāya_ discourses in the first column ends abruptly at MN 142 rather than continuing on to MN 152. This irregularity has been analyzed

Appendix: Tables of Parallels

and interpreted in a recently published study.^408 The resulting explanation for it can be summarized, very briefly, as follows. The decade of discourses MN 143–152, which is the last division of the exist- ing _Majjhima-nikāya,_ bears the title _Saḷāyatana-vagga,_ “Division on the Six Sense Bases,” a title that accurately reflects its content. Several pieces of evidence indicate that this decade was formerly located not in the _Majjhima-nikāya_ but in the _Saṃyutta-nikāya,_ where it was contained within the _Saḷāyatana-saṃyutta,_ “Connected with the Six Sense Bases.” At some early time it was transferred, perhaps accidentally, from there to its present location. This resulted in the anomaly noted above: the seeming lack of _Madhyama-āgama_ parallels for the last ten discourses of the _Majjhima-nikāya._ Chinese parallels for these ten dis- courses do exist, but they are instead located in the _Saṃyukta-āgama._ This inferred transfer accounts for ten of the fifty-seven cases where a _Majjhima-nikāya_ discourse lacks a known parallel in the _Madhyama-āgama._ Besides clarifying the observed anomaly, it indirectly supports the proposition, tentatively advanced above, that the first _Madhyama-āgama_ decade, MĀ 1–10, was transferred to that spot from an earlier location in a Sarvāstivādin Numerical Collection. It does this by providing evidence that such movements of blocks of discourses, from one _nikāya/āgama_ to another within the Sutra _-piṭaka_ of a given school, did sometimes occur. Further evidence of this kind is reported elsewhere in Bucknell, “The Structure of the Sanskrit _Dīrgha-āgama_ from Gilgit vis-à-vis the Pali _Dīgha-nikāya,”_ pp 64–66, esp. p. 65. The relevant data are reproduced in the _Dīgha-nikāya_ section of the present Table 2. There eleven of the thirty-four discourses that make up the _Dīgha-nikāya_ are listed, as each of these eleven has a parallel (in two cases actually two partial parallels) in the _Madhyama-āgama._ This information can also be discerned, though less readily, in Table 1, where the same eleven _Dīgha- nikāya_ discourses are shown as having parallels (again, in two cases two partial parallels) to thirteen partly scattered discourses of the _Madhyama-āgama_ (for example, DN 15 has a parallel in MĀ 97, and DN 22 has partial parallels in MĀ 31 and MĀ 98). As before, the natural interpretation is that these eleven discourses have been transferred from one collection to another within the Pāli line of trans- mission—in this instance, from _Majjhima-nikāya_ to _Dīgha-nikāya._ The present case differs in one respect from the one considered just above, in which a decade of discourses has been transferred from the _Saṃyutta-nikāya_ to the end of the

Appendix: Tables of Parallels

_Majjhima-nikāya._ The difference is that here the transferred discourses do not form a clearly defined block in their new location, but are partly scattered. This can be seen in Table 2, where the sequence of their numbers is 15, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31.^409 The same article documents yet another instance of this phenomenon.^410 In this case the relevant body of textual data is Jens-Uwe Hartmann’s comparative table showing the forty-seven discourses that make up the Sanskrit _Dīrgha- āgama_ from Gilgit.^411 Analysis indicates that, of those forty-seven _Dīrgha-āgama_ discourses, nine are likely to have been transferred into the _Dīrgha-āgama_ from the corresponding _Madhyama-āgama._ Here again the transfer was accompanied by partial scattering, as seen in the serial numbers of the nine discourses in the extant Sanskrit text: 7, 10, 11, 12, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22.^412 The _Majjhima-nikāya_ parallels to these nine are again among the fifty-seven discourses that are missing from the list in the _Majjhima-nikāya_ section of the present Table 2; they are MN 60, 105, 4, 12, 102, 95, 36, 85, 100. The above paragraphs have documented three instances of the seeming transfer of a decade of discourses from one collection to another within the corpus of a single school, namely the following. Within the Sarvāstivāda trans- mission, a set of nine discourses was transferred from the _Madhyama-āgama_ to the _Dīrgha-āgama._ Independently of this, within the Theravāda transmission, a completely different set of eleven discourses (or perhaps ten; the two partial parallels of DN 16 obscure the picture) was transferred from the _Majjhima- nikāya_ to the _Dīgha-nikāya._ And, again within the Theravāda transmission, a set of ten discourses was transferred, evidently at a later time, from the _Saṃyutta- nikāya_ to the _Majjhima-nikāya._ For the three transfers of discourse material just summarized, no motive is easily discerned. Nevertheless, the demonstration that these transfers probably did occur contributes to an understanding of the structure of both the _Madhya ma-āgama_ and its Pāli counterpart, the _Majjhima-nikāya._ To begin with, it provides further sup- port for the proposition, advanced earlier in this introduction, that the presence of _Ekottarika-_ type material in the _Madhyama-āgama_ is similarly due to impor- tation of such material, either as entire decades or as smaller units. Looking further back in time, one can also see it pointing to an early stage in the devel- opment of the _Collection of Middle-length Discourses_ —a stage at which both the Sarvāstivāda and Theravāda versions of it still included the two decades that

Appendix: Tables of Parallels

would later be transferred to the respective versions of the _Collection of Long Discourses._ That is, it points to a stage in which the two versions of the _Collection of Middle-length Discourses_ resembled each other much more closely than do their present derivatives.

## Notes

****

(^1) The Pāli parallel is the _Mahā-assapura-sutta,_ MN 39 at MN I 271; for a comparative study see Bhikkhu Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya_ (Taipei: Dharma Drum Publishing Corporation, 2011), pp. 256–259. (^2) Before turning to bodily conduct, the _Mahā-assapura-sutta_ mentions the need to have a sense of shame. (^3) The _Mahā-assapura-sutta_ next mentions moderation with food and wakefulness, before coming to clear comprehension with various activities. (^4) The _Mahā-assapura-sutta_ also mentions eating, drinking, consuming food, tasting, defecating, and urinating. (^5) Before coming to destruction of the taints (the third higher knowledge), the _Mahā- assapura-sutta_ also mentions the first and second higher knowledges: recollection of past lives and the divine eye. (^6) The _Mahā-assapura-sutta_ has some additional epithets. (^7) The Pāli parallel is the _Cūḷa-assapura-sutta,_ MN 40 at MN I 281; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 260–261. (^8) The _Cūḷa-assapura-sutta_ additionally specifies that the relatives would do so already as soon as the person is born. (^9) The earlier listing instead spoke of a renunciant’s defilement. (^10) Instead of the removal of the five hindrances, the _Cūḷa-assapura-sutta_ describes the arising of joy on seeing the mind free from defilements, which then leads on to tran- quillity and concentration. (^11) Adopting a variant that adds 有有, in conformity with a similar passage found in the _Vatthū pama-sutta,_ MN 7 at MN I 38: _atthi idaṃ, atthi hīnaṃ, atthi paṇītaṃ, atthi imassa saññāgatassa uttariṃ nissaraṇaṃ._ The _Cūḷa-assapura-sutta_ does not describe the cultivation of insight at all, but turns from the _brahmavihāra_ s directly to the simile of the pond. (^12) The _Cūḷa-assapura-sutta_ distinguishes between one who practices the proper way to recluseship by tranquillizing the mind and one who has become a true recluse by destroying the taints.

Notes

(^13) The remainder of MĀ 183 has no counterpart in the _Cūḷa-assapura-sutta._ (^14) The Pāli parallel is the _Mahāgosiṅga-sutta,_ MN 32 at MN I 212; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 209–216. (^15) The _Mahāgosiṅga-sutta_ does not mention Mahākaccāna. (^16) In the _Mahāgosiṅga-sutta_ Anuruddha illustrates such ability with the example of a thousand wheel rims. (^17) The _Mahāgosiṅga-sutta_ instead attributes a similar description to Mahāmoggallāna. (^18) For a comparative survey of variations in Mahākassapa’s listing of such qualities see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ p. 212, table 4.4. (^19) In the _Mahāgosiṅga-sutta_ Mahāmoggallāna instead describes competence in talking about the higher Dharma. (^20) The Pāli parallel is the _Cūḷagosiṅga-sutta,_ MN 31 at MN I 205; for comparative studies see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 203–209; Blair Alan Silverlock, “An Edition and Study of the Gosiga-sutra, The Cow-horn Discourse (Senior Collection Scroll no. 12): An Account of the Harmonious Aṇarudha Monks” (Ph.D thesis, University of Sydney, 2015). (^21) In the _Cūḷagosiṅga-sutta_ a comparable description is found only later, as part of the report given to the Buddha by Anuruddha. (^22) The corresponding description in the _Cūḷagosiṅga-sutta_ does not refer to their practice of meditation; and in relation to their regular meetings every five days it says only that they discuss the Dharma, without mentioning that they might alternatively sit together in silence. (^23) The _Cūḷagosiṅga-sutta_ does not mention the _brahmavihāra_ s. (^24) Instead of the six higher knowledges, the _Cūḷagosiṅga-sutta_ reports the attainment of cessation. (^25) According to the _Cūḷagosiṅga-sutta,_ he had also been informed about their attainments by _deva_ s. (^26) The Pāli parallel is the _Vīmaṃsaka-sutta,_ MN 47 at MN I 317, which has Jeta’s Grove at Sāvatthī as its location; for comparative studies see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 291–293; _Madhyama-āgama Studie_ s (Taipei: Dharma Drum Publishing Corporation 2012), pp. 67–80. (^27) In the _Vīmaṃsaka-sutta_ the inquiry is if he has succumbed to the danger that comes with fame. (^28) A section of the text appears to be missing here. (^29) The Pāli parallel is the _Chabbisodhana-sutta,_ MN 112 at MN III 29; for comparative

Notes

studies see Anālayo A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 635–639; and Madhyama-āgama Studies, pp. 223–248.

(^30) According to the _Chabbisodhana-sutta,_ such a claim should not receive immediate approval, but should first be investigated. (^31) In the _Chabbisodhana-sutta_ the five aggregates of clinging is the second topic of investigation, preceded by what is seen, heard, etc., and followed by the six elements, the six senses, and an account of the gradual path. (^32) The four nutriments are not mentioned at all in the _Chabbisodhana-sutta._ (^33) Here and below adopting the variant 諸 instead of 識. (^34) Adopting the variant 說 instead of 諍. (^35) In the _Chabbisodhana-sutta_ the monks approve of and rejoice in the claimant’s attain- ment only after having completed the entire investigation. (^36) For the first part of MĀ 188 the Pāli parallel is the _Ajita-sutta,_ AN 10.116 at AN V 229; for the latter part the parallel is the _Adhamma-sutta,_ AN 10.115 at AN V 224. (^37) In the _Ajita-sutta_ the conversation partners are seated; and Ajita is the one who broaches the topic of the teaching given by Paṇḍita, who here is his co-practitioner ( _sabrahmacārin_ ). This then leads directly to the Buddha expounding the topic to the monks, without any further appearance of Ajita in the text. (^38) The ensuing description of the vicissitudes of claiming to be omniscient has a coun- terpart in the _Sandaka-sutta,_ MN 76 at MN I 519. (^39) In the _Ajita-sutta_ the Buddha continues expounding the topic, whereas in the _Adhamma- sutta_ he departs and the monks then ask Ānanda to expound it. (^40) The Pāli parallel is the _Mahācattārīsaka-sutta,_ MN 117 at MN III 71, which has Jeta’s Grove at Sāvatthī as its location; for comparative studies see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 657–664; _Madhyama-āgama Studies,_ pp. 289–324. (^41) The introductory statement on the one path has no counterpart in the _Mahācattārīsaka- sutta._ (^42) The _Mahācattārīsaka-sutta_ expounds the successive conditional arising of the path factors at a later point; it has no counterpart to the ensuing description of the noble disciple’s swift progress to liberation. (^43) Here and below, the _Mahācattārīsaka-sutta_ distinguishes between two types of right path factors, presenting supramundane right path factors as the second type. (^44) Here and below the emendation is based on the context, which clearly requires a ref- erence to “right view,” as in the _Mahācattārīsaka-sutta._ (^45) The _Mahācattārīsaka-sutta_ does not continue after right livelihood with descriptions of right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration, right knowledge, and right lib- eration.

Notes

(^46) The exposition of the ten path factors in the _Mahācattārīsaka-sutta_ has right knowledge before right liberation. (^47) The Pāli parallel is the _Cūḷasuññata-sutta,_ MN 121 at MN III 104; for comparative studies see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ 683–688; _Madhya - ma-āgama Studies,_ pp. 325–349. (^48) The _Cūḷasuññata-sutta_ continues at this point with neither-perception-nor-non-per- ception. (^49) Here and below, the translation is based on the emending 想 to read 相, corresponding to the reading found in the Pāli parallel, _animitta._ (^50) The insight contemplation in the _Cūḷasuññata-sutta_ requires the meditator to see that whatever is conditioned and the product of volition is impermanent and subject to cessation. (^51) According to the _Cūḷasuññata-sutta,_ this is the supreme dwelling in emptiness. (^52) Instead of tathāgatas, the _Cūḷasuññata-sutta_ speaks of renunciants and brahmins. (^53) The Pāli parallel is the _Mahāsuññata-sutta,_ MN 122 at MN III 109; for comparative studies see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 688–701; _Madhyama-āgama Studies,_ pp. 349–363. (^54) The _Mahāsuññata-sutta_ does not describe Ānanda’s reception of the Buddha. (^55) The _Mahāsuññata-sutta_ describes the Buddha’s abiding as being internal and by way of not giving attention to any sign, _nimitta._ It does not mention the arising of joy, etc., described in MĀ 191. (^56) The _Mahāsuññata-sutta_ has no such statement. (^57) According to the _Mahāsuññata-sutta,_ all four absorptions are required. (^58) The translation is based on emending 彼彼心 to read just 彼心, in line with the for- mulation found later in the text. (^59) The _Mahāsuññata-sutta_ also mentions practice in the standing and reclining postures. (^60) The _Mahāsuññata-sutta_ discusses speech before turning to thoughts. (^61) Such a statement about the Dharma and the ensuing exposition of diligence have no counterpart in the _Mahāsuññata-sutta._ (^62) The _Mahāsuññata-sutta_ does not explore why the Buddha dwelled in seclusion. (^63) Such a distinction between imperturbable liberation and attainment of the four absorp- tions is not explicitly made in the _Mahāsuññata-sutta._ (^64) The translation is based on emending 往 to read 住.

Notes

****

(^65) The Pāli parallel is the _Laṭukikopama-sutta,_ MN 66 at MN I 447; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 362–367. (^66) The _Laṭukikopama-sutta_ reports no such reflection. (^67) Instead of an inquiry by the Buddha, in the _Laṭukikopama-sutta_ Udāyin straightaway reports his reflection. (^68) In the _Laṭukikopama-sutta_ the monk who went begging at night is Udāyin himself. (^69) The simile in the _Laṭukikopama-sutta_ describes a quail bound by a rotting creeper. (^70) Adopting the variant 止 instead of 正. (^71) In the _Laṭukikopama-sutta,_ here and below, instead of pointing out that all fetters are unwholesome, the Buddha explains that he knows the diversity of faculties of this person. (^72) The translation “joy” is based on emending 善 to 喜. (^73) Adopting the variant 室 instead of 空. (^74) The translation of 無 follows the indication by Akira Hirakawa, _Buddhist Chinese- Sanskrit Dictionary_ (Tokyo: Reiyukai), p. 752, that on its own this character can render terms such as _ayoga, niḥsaṅga, vipramukta,_ etc. (^75) The exposition in the _Laṭukikopama-sutta_ proceeds beyond neither-perception-nor- nonperception to attainment of cessation. (^76) The _Laṭukikopama-sutta_ does not come back to the earlier theme of foolish people’s reactions to the Buddha’s regulations on food. (^77) The Pāli parallel is the _Kakacūpama-sutta,_ MN 21 at MN I 122; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 145–147. (^78) In the _Kakacūpama-sutta_ the Buddha adds that Moliya Phagguṇa should remain unaf- fected if anyone were to maltreat the nuns. (^79) The corresponding instruction in the _Kakacūpama-sutta_ has no reference to being of much or little renown. (^80) After the simile of the _sāla_ tree grove, the _Kakacūpama-sutta_ continues directly with the tale of the housewife Vedehikā. (^81) Adopting a variant without 彼. (^82) Adopting the variant 五 instead of 互. (^83) The _Kakacūpama-sutta_ does not mention the other three of the four _brahmavihāra_ s. (^84) In the _Kakacūpama-sutta_ the simile of trying to burn up the Ganges is preceded by the simile of painting on space.

Notes

(^85) In the _Kakacūpama-sutta_ the cat skin simile, illustrating the five ways of speech, is immediately followed by the simile of the saw. There is no mention of the possibility of being punched, beaten, etc. (^86) The instruction in the _Kakacūpama-sutta_ for the case of being cut up by thieves men- tions only _mettā,_ not the other three of the four _brahmavihāra_ s. (^87) The _Kakacūpama-sutta_ only notes that recollecting the simile of the saw will be for the welfare and happiness of the monks, without a reference to wandering in the four directions or a proclamation regarding the attainment of nonreturn or full awakening. (^88) The Pāli parallel is the _Bhaddāli-sutta,_ MN 65 at MN I 437; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 358–362. (^89) In the _Bhaddāli-sutta_ the Buddha does not twice repeat his instruction. After Bhaddāli’s refusal, the Buddha just once mentions the alternative that Bhaddāli, on being invited for a meal, can take food from it with him for later consumption. (^90) Here and below, the _Bhaddāli-sutta_ does not explain why Bhaddāli acted in this way. (^91) The _Bhaddāli-sutta_ begins a similar criticism by pointing out that the Buddha would know him as one who does not fulfill the training. (^92) The _Bhaddāli-sutta_ clarifies that to lie down in the mud was to serve as a plank for the Buddha to walk over. (^93) In the _Bhaddāli-sutta_ at this point he confesses again and the Buddha accepts his confession, which in MĀ 194 happens later. (^94) Adopting the variant 已 instead of 以. (^95) Instead of listing the factors, beginning with delight, whose successive arising leads to knowing and seeing as it really is, the _Bhaddāli-sutta_ states only that such a monk will not attain realization. Conversely below. (^96) Instead of qualifying the first absorption as a higher state of mind, etc., making for advance toward nirvana, the _Bhaddāli-sutta_ just links such attainment to fulfilling the training. (^97) The addition of “[not]” here and below is motivated by the fact that the context clearly requires a negative formulation; see also Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ p. 360f, n. 114. (^98) The addition of “[a little]” or “[the little]” is based on the subsequent repetition of this passage, which includes 少 at the points in question. It also seems needed for the passage to make sense, which indicates that the absence of the expected 少 would be due to a transmission error. (^99) Following an emendation in the CBETA edition which adds 一, “one.” (^100) In the _Bhaddāli-sutta_ the inquiry contrasts former times, when there were fewer rules

and more monks reached final knowledge, with later times when there were more rules and fewer monks reaching final knowledge.

(^101) Before taking up the topic of gains, the _Bhaddāli-sutta_ first mentions that the sangha has reached greatness. Instead of “fine things,” the Pāli version speaks of “things that are the basis for taints.” (^102) The theme of great merit is not mentioned in the _Bhaddāli-sutta._ (^103) In the _Bhaddāli-sutta_ the Buddha first asks if Bhaddāli remembers the simile. (^104) In the _Bhaddāli-sutta_ he does not explicitly request the Buddha to teach the simile. (^105) Adopting the variant 鬪. (^106) The Pāli parallel is the _Kīṭāgiri-sutta,_ MN 70 at MN I 473; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 377–387. (^107) The expression used in the present context differs from the injunction to take only a single meal in the preceding discourse; the point of the injunction here is to eat only during the day, i.e., to abstain from eating at night. (^108) The _Kīṭāgiri-sutta_ does not provide information about Assaji’s and Punabbasuka’s former positions in society. (^109) In the _Kīṭāgiri-sutta_ this first instance of informing Assaji and Punabbasuka does not come with an anticipation that they will disobey the Buddha’s instruction. (^110) The _Kīṭāgiri-sutta_ does not report that the same exchange took place three times. (^111) In the _Kīṭāgiri-sutta_ the question is whether they had heard the Buddha state that experiencing any type of feeling will lead to decrease of unwholesome states and increase of wholesome states, which they deny. (^112) In the _Kīṭāgiri-sutta_ they have not misunderstood the Buddha’s teaching, wherefore they are not being rebuked on that account. (^113) The corresponding exposition in the _Kīṭāgiri-sutta_ also covers neutral feeling. (^114) The _Kīṭāgiri-sutta_ does not have a counterpart to the exposition that distinguishes feelings into bodily and mental types. (^115) The _Kīṭāgiri-sutta_ contains no such summary statement of the principle behind the distinction between what is to be cultivated and what is not to be cultivated. (^116) The _Kīṭāgiri-sutta_ instead defines this type of arahant as one who has mastered the imma- terial attainments. The same difference recurs in relation to the body witness. (^117) The addition of “[not yet]” here and in the next section (faith follower) is a makeshift device adopted to accommodate a seemingly erroneous duplication of textual material. The description of the Dharma follower virtually replicates that of the one arrived at view; and the description of the faith follower virtually replicates that of the one

liberated by faith. Adding “not yet” signals that the Dharma follower and the faith fol lower are at earlier stages of the path than the one arrived at view and the one liberated by faith.

(^118) The _Kīṭāgiri-sutta_ mentions possession of the five faculties ( _indriya_ ) in its definition of the Dharma follower and the faith follower. (^119) Before announcing the four-phrase teaching (which here comes without the question whether the monks wish to know it), in the _Kīṭāgiri-sutta_ the Buddha points out that Assaji and Punabbasuka are devoid of the qualities required for attaining final knowledge. (^120) The _Kīṭāgiri-sutta_ instead recommends the attitude that the Buddha knows, the disciple does not know, and then depicts strong determination using the image of continuous striving even if flesh and blood were to dry up. (^121) The _Kīṭāgiri-sutta_ does not refer to wandering in the four directions or describe an increase in wholesomeness by day and night. (^122) The Pāli parallel is the _Sāmagāma-sutta,_ MN 104 at MN II 243, which has Sāmagāma as its location; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 603–610. (^123) Adopting a variant that adds another 汝. (^124) Here and below, adopting the variant 住 instead of 柱. (^125) Adopting a correction suggested in the CBETA edition of adopting 住 instead of 往. (^126) It is somewhat unexpected that the novice should sit down while the fully ordained monk remains standing, in fact in the _Sāmagāma-sutta_ they both sit down to one side. (^127) The _Sāmagāma-sutta_ does not have the description of a monk well-restrained in the presence of the Buddha. (^128) In the _Sāmagāma-sutta_ the Buddha instead inquires if Ānanda could envisage a dis- agreement among monks regarding the constituents of awakening. (^129) The addition of “[not]” seems to be required to make sense of this statement in its context, as a dispute about the higher morality, higher mind, and higher insight would be precisely a dispute about the path and the stages of the path; see also Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ p. 604f, n. 100. (^130) No rebuttal of Ñātaputta’s claim to omniscience is found in the _Sāmagāma-sutta._ (^131) This simile is not found in the _Sāmagāma-sutta._ (^132) Instead of silent sulking the _Sāmagāma-sutta_ has contempt, and instead of shame- lessness it has dogmatism. (^133) Before listing these seven, the _Sāmagāma-sutta_ names four types of litigation. The

Notes

sequence of the seven settlements of litigation differs in the two versions; see Anālayo A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, p. 608, table 11.5.

(^134) The original employs just the term to be used when addressing the accused monk: 君, “sir” (in contrast to the expression “venerable friend” used regularly when monks address each other). Since “sir” as a name for this type of settlement fails to make sense, it seems fair to assume that the original name for this procedure and the mode of address to be used during the procedure have been confused with each other. There- fore in the translation “sir” has been emended to “bad character,” in line with the type of terminology found in other listings of the seven kinds of settlement of litigation for what corresponds to the present case. (^135) The _Sāmagāma-sutta_ speaks of drawing out the guideline of the Dharma to settle a disagreement between monks regarding Dharma and discipline; it does not work through variations in the number of those who are in disagreement. (^136) Adopting the variant 曾 instead of 曹. (^137) Here and in the next case, the _Sāmagāma-sutta_ does not give comparable details on the procedure to be adopted by the monk. (^138) In the _Sāmagāma-sutta_ the case of past insanity requires cross-questioning by the other monks. (^139) The description is cryptically worded. In order to fit the context, which is clearly about someone denying having violated a rule, addition of “[not]” seems to be required. The point then is that the defendant declares either that he does not know about the alleged violation or that he does not see it as a violation. (^140) After repeated cross-questioning, in the _Sāmagāma-sutta_ the one of bad character finally admits his wrongdoing. (^141) The _Sāmagāma-sutta_ again speaks of drawing out the guideline of the Dharma. (^142) Adopting a variant that reverses the sequence of 法 and 是. (^143) The _Sāmagāma-sutta_ concludes that the six principles of cordiality conduce to enduring any type of speech. (^144) A comparable exchange can be found in the _Upālipucchā_ of the _Mahāvagga,_ Mv 9.6 at Vin I 325. (^145) The Pāli parallel is the _Dantabhūmi-sutta,_ MN 125 at MN III 128; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 717–722; _Madhya ma-āgama Studies,_ pp. 395–419. (^146) The addition of “[gone beyond]” is required to accommodate what appears to be a textual error in the original. To judge from the context, the reference at this point should rather be to the stage of being tamed.

Notes

(^147) In the _Dantabhūmi-sutta_ the Buddha concludes that if Aciravata had delivered the two similes, the prince would have gained confidence in him. (^148) Before turning to _satipaṭṭhāna,_ the _Dantabhūmi-sutta_ has the standard account of the gradual path covering sense restraint, moderation in eating, wakefulness, clear com- prehension, and removal of the five hindrances. (^149) The _Dantabhūmi-sutta_ does not relate _satipaṭṭhāna_ without thoughts to the elephant simile. (^150) The corresponding part in the _Dantabhūmi-sutta_ omits the first absorption and continues after the fourth absorption with the three higher knowledges. (^151) The _Dantabhūmi-sutta_ does not relate the imperturbability reached with the fourth absorption to the elephant simile. (^152) The _Dantabhūmi-sutta_ does not relate the ability to endure various vicissitudes (which here do not include being beaten with sticks) to the elephant simile. (^153) In the _Dantabhūmi-sutta_ worthiness comes about through having reached full liberation. (^154) In the _Dantabhūmi-sutta_ such a disciple, instead of being called “untamed,” is said to have not eradicated the taints. (^155) The Pāli parallel is the _Bālapaṇḍita-sutta,_ MN 129 at MN III 163; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 741–746. (^156) Instead of the ten courses of action, the _Bālapaṇḍita-sutta_ lists breaches of the five precepts. (^157) Adopting the variant 拷 instead of 考. (^158) Here and below in the _Bālapaṇḍita-sutta_ the person is just taking a rest, not necessarily suffering illness. (^159) Adopting the variant 被 instead of 受. (^160) Adopting the variant 同燃 instead of 洞然. (^161) The text here repeats the description just given above. (^162) Here and below, adopting the variant 齶 instead of 齗. (^163) The _Bālapaṇḍita-sutta_ instead describes the Great Hell, which is made of blazing hot iron. (^164) The list of animals in the _Bālapaṇḍita-sutta_ is in a different sequence, proceeding from animals that feed on grass or dung to those that live in darkness, water, and filth. (^165) As explained by Bhikkhu Bodhi, _The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, A Trans- lation of the Aṅguttara Nikāya_ (Boston: Wisdom Publications, 2012) p. 1796, n. 1672 (in relation to an occurrence of these three in AN IV 200), _timi_ s, _timiṅgala_ s, and _timi- rapiṅgala_ s are “legendary fish of gigantic size.”

Notes

(^166) In the _Bālapaṇḍita-sutta_ those who come running are brahmins smelling a sacrifice. (^167) It is not clear what these last two animals, _julouluo_ and _julengjia,_ could be referring to. (^168) As earlier, the _Bālapaṇḍita-sutta_ describes wise conduct with reference to the five precepts, not by way of the ten courses of action. (^169) The _Bālapaṇḍita-sutta_ offers a detailed description of the seven treasures and four types of endowments of a wheel-turning king. (^170) No such description of heaven is found in the _Bālapaṇḍita-sutta._ (^171) The _Bālapaṇḍita-sutta_ contains no explicit injunction that the monks should train accordingly. (^172) The Pāli parallel is the _Alagaddūpama-sutta,_ MN 22 at MN I 130; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 147–158. (^173) In the _Alagaddūpama-sutta_ the monks quote a series of similes to illustrate the nature of sensuality, which are later repeated by the Buddha and then by the monks again. (^174) The listing of similes in the _Alagaddūpama-sutta_ has a slaughterhouse and an impaling stake as two additional illustrations. (^175) In the _Alagaddūpama-sutta_ the Buddha states that it is impossible to engage in sensual pleasures without having sensual desire. (^176) Adopting the variant 耶 instead of 也. (^177) The _Alagaddūpama-sutta_ lists only nine _aṅga_ s. (^178) The translation is based on emending 脫 to read 說. (^179) Adopting the variant 意 instead of 竟. (^180) The _Alagaddūpama-sutta_ introduces the six standpoints for views by first describing the case of an unlearned worldling. (^181) This supplementation is based on the fact that in MĀ 200 a later recapitulation of the present exposition includes formations, although out of sequence and with a variant that fits the context better. The corresponding passage in the _Alagaddūpama-sutta_ mentions formations in both cases. (^182) This view, which appears to be a type of annihilationism, has no counterpart in the _Alagaddūpama-sutta._ (^183) In the _Alagaddūpama-sutta_ longing for the past arises because of what does not exist externally and fear of annihilation because of what does not exist internally. (^184) Adopting the variant 則 instead of 見. (^185) The _Alagaddūpama-sutta_ continues with a teaching on the impermanent, _dukkha,_ and not-self nature of the five aggregates.

Notes

(^186) Adopting the variant 所 instead of 行; and inferring the former presence of 所有行 preceding 所有此見. (^187) In the _Alagaddūpama-sutta_ the Buddha clarifies that he just teaches _dukkha_ and its cessation. (^188) In the _Alagaddūpama-sutta_ the simile of twigs in Jeta’s Grove is preceded by an instruction to the monks to give up the five aggregates. (^189) In the _Alagaddūpama-sutta_ the Buddha asks the monks whether, on seeing the grass and twigs being carried away, they would think that they themselves are being carried away. (^190) The _Alagaddūpama-sutta_ continues by describing the Dharma follower and the faith follower, as well as those who have sufficient faith to be reborn in heaven. (^191) The Pāli parallel is the _Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhaya-sutta,_ MN 38 at MN I 256; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 251–256. (^192) Adopting a variant that adds 緣. (^193) In the _Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhaya-sutta_ Sāti’s silent dismay is described earlier. (^194) 真說見耶, literally, “do you see that this has been truly said,” which appears to be a trans- lation error; cf. Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ p. 252, n. 233. (^195) 如來真說見耶, which appears to involve another misunderstanding by the translators. Fumimaro Watanabe, “Logical Arguments in the Dialogues (Suttas),” _Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies_ 20/2 (1972): 981, suggests it is based on misreading “nutriment” ( _āhāra_ ) as “worthy” ( _araha_ ), leading in turn to an intrusion of tathāgata. (^196) The _Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhaya-sutta_ has no reference to opening up a channel. (^197) Such an inquiry and its response are not reported in the _Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhaya-sutta._ (^198) Adopting the variant 淳 instead of 等. (^199) Adopting the variant 也 instead of 耶. (^200) The _Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhaya-sutta_ introduces a recapitulation of dependent arising with a statement of specific conditionality in the form “when this is, that exists; with the arising of this, that arises.” (The same holds below for the cessation mode, with appro- priate changes in the formulation of specific conditionality). (^201) Adopting a variant that adds 佛. (^202) The _Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhaya-sutta_ does not explicitly mention the impossibility of com- mitting the five heinous crimes, as well as some other impossibilities mentioned sub- sequently in MĀ 201. (^203) Adopting the variant 仰 instead of 作. (^204) The translation is based on disregarding one instance of 苦.

Notes

(^205) The _Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhaya-sutta_ also states that in the absence of some of these con- ditions, conception does not take place. (^206) Adopting the variant 酥 instead of 蘇. (^207) The _Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhaya-sutta_ at this juncture gives a full account of the gradual path. (^208) No earthquake is reported in the _Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhaya-sutta_ , which instead concludes by speaking of the monk Sāti as caught in the vast net of craving. **** (^209) The Pāli parallel is the _Uposatha-sutta,_ AN 3.70 at AN I 205; cf. also AN 8.43 at AN IV 255. (^210) The criticism seems to be of protection being directed only to living beings that dwell beyond the range of a hundred _yojana_ s, while ignoring those that dwell close by. (^211) The translation is based on the variant 主, instead of 生. (^212) The _Uposatha-sutta_ takes up the conduct of arahants only later in its exposition. (^213) In the _Uposatha-sutta_ taking a single meal is mentioned earlier, before the reference to dancing etc. and to the use of luxurious beds. (^214) The present translation follows a CBETA emendation of 往 to 住. (^215) In the _Uposatha-sutta_ the list of recollections comes earlier. (^216) The supplementation follows a gloss in the Pāli commentary, Mp II 322, on the similar reference to Brahmā in the _Uposatha-sutta._ (^217) The translation is based on the variant 鉗 instead of 鉆. (^218) The _Uposatha-sutta_ speaks of Gandhāra instead of Yona. (^219) Adopting the variant 儴 instead of 壞. (^220) Adopting the variant 比 instead of 比丘. (^221) In the _Uposatha-sutta_ the Buddha delivers a poem at this juncture, after which the discourse concludes without reporting Visākhā’s reaction. (^222) The Pāli parallel is the _Potaliya-sutta,_ MN 54 at MN I 359, which has Āpaṇa among the Aṅguttarāpans as its location; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 313–317. (^223) The _Potaliya-sutta_ does not describe Potaliya’s earlier meetings with renunciants and brahmins. (^224) Sexual misconduct is not mentioned in the _Potaliya-sutta._ (^225) In the _Potaliya-sutta_ the first set of eight leads to the cutting off of worldly affairs; the next set completes the cutting off of worldly affairs

Notes

(^226) The _Potaliya-sutta_ clarifies that the problem of being chased by the other birds is that these will peck and claw the bird with the meat. (^227) This question is not found in the _Potaliya-sutta._ (^228) In the _Potaliya-sutta_ two strong men have overpowered this man and drag him toward the charcoal pit. (^229) The _Potaliya-sutta_ does not contain the simile of the poisonous snake. (^230) In the _Potaliya-sutta_ he dreams he is seeing lovely parks and groves. (^231) This question is not found in the _Potaliya-sutta._ (^232) The expected description of the first absorption is lacking here. It could be restored as follows: “Secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states, he dwells having attained the first absorption, which is with directed awareness and sustained contemplation, with rapture and happiness born of separation.” (^233) The _Potaliya-sutta_ does not explicitly bring in the four absorptions, although in relation to each simile it describes the noble disciple leaving behind diversified equa- nimity and cultivating unified equanimity, which according to the commentary, Ps III 43, is a reference to the fourth absorption. (^234) Before coming to the destruction of the taints, the _Potaliya-sutta_ describes the attainment of the other two higher knowledges, recollection of past lives and the divine eye. (^235) The _Potaliya-sutta_ does not report his stream-entry. (^236) The _Potaliya-sutta_ only reports Potaliya proclaiming that he will in future give to the Buddha’s disciples. In the Pāli version Potaliya then illustrates the nature of the expo- sition received with a standard set of similes that describe setting upright what had been overturned, revealing what was hidden, etc. (^237) The Pāli parallel is the _Ariyapariyesanā-sutta,_ MN 26 at MN I 160, which has Jeta’s Grove at Sāvatthī as its location; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 170–189; _Madhyama-āgama Studies,_ pp. 11–37. (^238) Before the episode about going to bathe, in the _Ariyapariyesanā-sutta_ a group of monks had approached Ānanda and expressed their wish to hear a discourse from the Buddha. (^239) The _Ariyapariyesanā-sutta_ also mentions being subject to birth. (^240) Adopting the variant 污 instead of 法. (^241) The _Ariyapariyesanā-sutta_ does not refer to the Bodhisattva’s moral purification undertaken before meeting Āḷāra Kālāma. (^242) A similar inquiry in the _Ariyapariyesanā-sutta_ is preceded by a description of the Bodhisattva becoming accomplished in the doctrine of Āḷāra Kālāma (and later of Uddaka Rāmaputta).

Notes

(^243) Here and below, the _Ariyapariyesanā-sutta_ names all five faculties, including mind- fulness and concentration. (^244) Adopting the variant reading 父羅摩 instead of 羅摩子. (^245) In the _Ariyapariyesanā-sutta_ he invites the Bodhisattva to be the sole leader of the group. (^246) The Bodhisattva’s strong determination not to change posture until awakening is attained is not mentioned in the the _Ariyapariyesanā-sutta._ It is, however, found in the _Mahāgosiṅga-sutta,_ MN 32 at MN I 219. (^247) The _Ariyapariyesanā-sutta_ at this point reports that the Buddha is hesitant to teach, whereupon Brahmā intervenes and convinces him that there are some who will under- stand his teaching. (^248) The text reads 二七日. A reference to “twenty-seven” would instead be 二十七日. The adopted rendering as “fourteen” follows André Bareau, _Recherches sur la Biographie du Buddha dans les Sūtrapiṭaka et les Vinayapiṭaka Anciens: De la Quête de l’Éveil a la Conversion de Śāriputra et de Maudgalyāyana_ (Paris: École Française d’Ex- trême-Orient, 1963), p. 145; this also matches the classical expression 二八 , meaning “sixteen [years of age]”. (^249) In the _Ariyapariyesanā-sutta_ Uddaka has passed away just the night before. (^250) The sequence of the stanzas spoken in reply to Uddaka is different in the _Ariyapariye- sanā-sutta,_ where the Buddha’s plan to go to Benares does not form a reply to Uddaka’s question about where the Buddha wishes to go. (^251) Adopting the variant 徑 instead of 經. (^252) The _Ariyapariyesanā-sutta_ does not have such a reflection by the Buddha on the con- fused condition of the five monks. (^253) In the _Ariyapariyesanā-sutta_ they express their disbelief three times. (^254) In the _Ariyapariyesanā-sutta_ the Buddha asks them if they have ever heard him speak like this before. (^255) The _Ariyapariyesanā-sutta_ makes no reference to the first discourse delivered by the Buddha, which is mentioned only in its commentary, Ps II 192. (^256) Adopting a variant without 求. (^257) Adopting a variant without 見. (^258) The _Ariyapariyesanā-sutta_ does not refer to the arising of a tathāgata. (^259) The _Ariyapariyesanā-sutta_ instead continues after the fourth absorption with the immaterial attainments and cessation. (^260) Adopting the variant 坐 instead of 伏, in keeping with earlier instances of this description.

Notes

(^261) The Pāli parallel is the _Mahāmālunkya-sutta,_ MN 64 at MN I 432; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 355–358. (^262) The _Mahāmālunkya-sutta_ does not report three instances of the Buddha’s query meeting with no reply. (^263) In the _Mahāmālunkya-sutta_ the path is insightful contemplation of _jhāna_ attainment. (^264) The simile of a mountain stream is not found in the _Mahāmālunkya-sutta._ (^265) The _Mahāmālunkya-sutta_ instead describes contemplation of an absorption in terms of the five aggregates and their characteristics of impermanence etc. (^266) The translation follows the variant 上 instead of 止. The _Mahāmālunkya-sutta_ differs in that, instead of progress to a higher attainment in tranquility it mentions the attain- ment of nonreturn as the alternative result. (^267) Adopting a variant that adds 空, in line with the earlier description of this attainment. (^268) The simile of the plantain tree is not found in the _Mahāmālunkya-sutta._ (^269) In the _Mahāmālunkya-sutta_ Ānanda asks why some monks are liberated by mind and others through wisdom. The Buddha attributes this to differences in their faculties. (^270) The Pāli parallel is the _Cetokhila-sutta,_ MN 16 at MN I 101; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 127–132. (^271) In the _Cetokhila-sutta_ the doubt is about the sangha, not about the precepts. (^272) The corresponding five mental bondages in the _Cetokhila-sutta_ are desire for sensual pleasures, desire for the body, desire for form, excessive eating and sleeping, and the wish for a heavenly rebirth. (^273) Adopting the variant reading 至 instead of 得, which is in line with the earlier for- mulation of the same phrase. (^274) The Pāli parallel is the _Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta,_ MN 77 at MN II 1; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 416–424; _Madhya - ma-āgama Studies,_ pp. 81–103. (^275) The _Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta_ does not mention the number of monks accompanying the Buddha or the number of followers of Sakuludāyī. (^276) The _Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta_ does not report that Sakuludāyī got up and received the Buddha with joined palms. (^277) In the _Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta_ the Buddha asks only once about the talk that has been going on. (^278) The _Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta_ does not state the number of followers of the other teachers or of the Buddha. (^279) Adopting a CBETA correction of 養 to read 奉.

Notes

(^280) In the _Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta_ the disciples even publicly state that their teacher is not able to answer a question posed by visitors, suggesting that, to get a proper reply, such a question should better be addressed to them, the disciples. (^281) The _Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta_ speaks of a company of several hundred. (^282) In the _Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta_ he merely clears his throat. (^283) The _Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta_ lists these five qualities in a different sequence, beginning with taking little food. (^284) Adopting the variant 刀 instead of 力. (^285) The translation is based on emending the Chinese text by exchanging the descriptions of the disciples and of the Buddha. The existing Chinese text has the Buddha eating a single fruit or half a fruit, whereas the diciples eat much more. Yet the general trend of the exposition requires that he eats plenty of food whereas the disciples eat relatively little. This is indeed the presentation in the _Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta._ It seems safe, therefore, to assume that an error in transmission has led to an interchanging of these two descriptions in MĀ 207. (^286) The translation is based on the variant 露 instead of 覆. (^287) The _Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta_ instead mentions the Buddha’s endowment with the supreme aggregate of virtue. (^288) The _Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta_ ’s description of the Buddha’s higher wisdom, which forms the third topic, does not refer to the inabilities of the opponent and additionally reports the Buddha as asking Sakuludāyī if he thinks the Buddha’s disciples would nevertheless interrupt their teacher. (^289) Instead of these two higher knowledges, the _Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta_ lists a range of different aspects of the path to liberation. (^290) The _Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta_ does not record that Sakuludāyī expressed his respect or that he took refuge. (^291) The Pāli parallel is the _Cūḷasakuludāyi-sutta,_ MN 79 at MN II 29; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 431–436. (^292) In the _Cūḷasakuludāyi-sutta_ the Buddha realizes that it is still too early to go begging alms and therefore goes to the park. (^293) The _Cūḷasakuludāyi-sutta_ does not report that Sakuludāyī got up and received the Buddha with joined palms. (^294) In the _Cūḷasakuludāyi-sutta_ the Buddha asks only once about the talk that has been going on. (^295) In the _Cūḷasakuludāyi-sutta_ the claimant to omniscience becomes irritated and pre- varicates.

Notes

(^296) Instead of mentioning all six teachers, the _Cūḷasakuludāyi-sutta_ attributes the claim to omniscience only to Nigaṇṭha Ñātaputta. (^297) No such remark is found in the _Cūḷasakuludāyi-sutta._ Since the Buddha has not yet delivered a teaching that Sakuludāyī might misunderstand, this remark does not fit the context well. Its presence here could have resulted from accidental replication of this passage from the otherwise fairly similar nearby discourse to Vekhanassa, MĀ 209, where such a remark does fit the context. (^298) In the _Cūḷasakuludāyi-sutta_ the Buddha at this juncture also gives a brief teaching on conditionality. (^299) Instead of taking the listing up to wrong view, the _Cūḷasakuludāyi-sutta_ continues after false speech with the undertaking of some asceticism. (^300) The _Cūḷasakuludāyi-sutta_ does not introduce the attainment of absorption with the gradual path account, which it brings in only at a later point. (^301) The _Cūḷasakuludāyi-sutta_ speaks of the fourth absorption as the realization of an entirely pleasant world, for reaching which the other three absorptions are the path. (^302) A distinction between _jhāna_ attainment with or without having the same virtue, etc., like the corresponding _deva_ s is not found in the _Cūḷasakuludāyi-sutta._ (^303) The _Cūḷasakuludāyi-sutta_ also mentions the attainment of the three higher knowledges. (^304) In the _Cūḷasakuludāyi-sutta_ he does not get up from his seat, wanting to pay homage; he does, however, take refuge and request the going forth under the Buddha. (^305) In the _Cūḷasakuludāyi-sutta_ they employ a simile to illustrate the inappropriateness of Sakuludāyī going forth under the Buddha. (^306) The Pāli parallel is the _Vekhanassa-sutta,_ MN 80 at MN II 40; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 437–440; _Madhya - ma-āgama Studies,_ pp. 139–154. (^307) The translation is based on the variant 彷徉 instead of 仿佯. (^308) The simile of the fire is not found in the _Vekhanassa-sutta._ (^309) In the _Vekhanassa-sutta_ the Buddha instead agrees to Vekhanassa’s criticism. (^310) Adopting a variant without 縛. (^311) The simile of the lamp is not found in the _Vekhanassa-sutta._ (^312) The translation is based on the variant 炯 instead of 洞. (^313) The simile of fuel for fire is not found in the _Vekhanassa-sutta._ (^314) The _Vekhanassa-sutta_ does not report his stream-entry, his going forth, or his eventually becoming an arahant, instead of which he just takes refuge as a lay follower.

Notes

(^315) The translation is based on the variant 來 instead of 哉. (^316) The Pāli parallel is the _Cūḷavedalla-sutta,_ MN 44 at MN I 299, which has the Squirrels’ Sanctuary at Rājagaha as its location; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Com- parative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 276–289. (^317) In the _Cūḷavedalla-sutta_ the two discussants are the male lay disciple Visākha and the nun Dhammadinnā. (^318) In the _Cūḷavedalla-sutta_ the arising of personality is followed by the topic of its ces- sation by giving up craving, and then by the noble eightfold path as what leads to that cessation. (^319) The _Cūḷavedalla-sutta_ allocates right effort to the concentration group. (^320) The topic of the five factors of the first absorption is covered in the _Mahāvedalla- sutta,_ MN 43 at MN I 294, instead of the _Cūḷavedalla-sutta._ (^321) The _Cūḷavedalla-sutta_ does not take up the achievement of concentration. (^322) The translation follows a variant without 服. (^323) This topic is found in the _Mahāvedalla-sutta,_ MN 43 at MN I 296, instead of the _Cūḷa vedalla-sutta._ (^324) This inquiry has no counterpart in the _Cūḷavedalla-sutta_ (or the _Mahāvedalla-sutta_ ). (^325) This topic is not discussed in the _Cūḷavedalla-sutta_ (or the _Mahāvedalla-sutta_ ). (^326) The _Cūḷavedalla-sutta_ mentions three contacts experienced on emerging from cessation, namely: empty, signless, and desireless contact. (^327) The corresponding inquiry in the _Cūḷavedalla-sutta_ is concerned only with what is pleasant and unpleasant in relation to each of the three feelings. (^328) The translation is based on an emendation that disregards the negation in the second case; according to the original reading not knowing neutral feeling would be pleasant. Given that not knowing painful feeling is said just above to be painful, the present formulation makes little sense and can safely be attributed to a textual error. (^329) This question is not found in the _Cūḷavedalla-sutta._ (^330) According to the _Cūḷavedalla-sutta,_ the counterpart to knowledge is liberation (and nirvana is then the counterpart to liberation). (^331) In the _Cūḷavedalla-sutta_ it is Visākha who approaches the Buddha and reports Dham- madinnā’s exposition, which similarly meets with the Buddha’s approval. (^332) The Pāli parallel is the _Mahāvedalla-sutta,_ MN 43 at MN I 292, which has Jeta’s Grove at Sāvatthī as its location; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 268–276. (^333) In the _Mahāvedalla-sutta_ Mahākoṭṭhita asks the questions and Sāriputta replies to them.

Notes

(^334) This question is not found in the _Mahāvedalla-sutta._ (^335) The translation is based on the variant 知 instead of 如. (^336) The _Mahāvedalla-sutta_ instead explains consciousness in terms of being conscious of the three types of feeling. (^337) The _Mahāvedalla-sutta_ adds that wisdom should be developed and consciousness should be understood. It does not explain that one knows through wisdom. (^338) The _Mahāvedalla-sutta_ explains the purpose of wisdom as direct understanding, pen- etrative understanding, and abandoning. (^339) Instead of “truth,” _sacca,_ the _Mahāvedalla-sutta_ mentions “discussion,” _sākacchā._ (^340) The _Mahāvedalla-sutta_ points in particular to the craving of ignorant beings as respon- sible for future becoming. (^341) The _Mahāvedalla-sutta_ explicitly mentions the cessation of craving, which would be implicit in the reference to the cessation of ignorance in MĀ 211. (^342) The corresponding discussion in the _Mahāvedalla-sutta_ covers feeling, perception, and consciousness. (^343) This question is not found in the _Mahāvedalla-sutta._ (^344) In the _Mahāvedalla-sutta_ the question that leads up to the answer with the simile of the lamp concerns what heat depends on. The reply that heat depends on vitality then elicits the question how it should be understood that according to the preceding state- ment vitality depends on heat, yet heat is now said to depend on vitality. (^345) This question and the next are not found in the _Mahāvedalla-sutta._ (^346) This discussion has a counterpart in the _Cūlavedalla-sutta,_ MN 44 at MN I 302. (^347) According to the _Cūlavedalla-sutta,_ verbal formations cease first. (^348) According to the _Cūlavedalla-sutta,_ the sequence of arising is first mental activity, next bodily activity, and last verbal activity. (^349) In the _Cūlavedalla-sutta_ the three are: empty contact, signless contact, and desireless contact. (^350) The corresponding discussion in the _Mahāvedalla-sutta_ concerns the “neither pleasant nor unpleasant deliverance of the mind.” (^351) Here and in what follows the translation is based on the variant 無相, instead of 無想. (^352) According to the _Mahāvedalla-sutta,_ prior determination is a third condition for remaining in the signless deliverance of the mind. (^353) For this third condition (not mentioned in the _Mahāvedalla-sutta_ ) the rendering is based on the variant reading for the second 因, namely 及, “with.”

Notes

****

(^354) The Pāli parallel is the _Kaṇṇakatthala-sutta,_ MN 90 at MN II 125; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 519–525. (^355) The _Kaṇṇakatthala-sutta_ does not report a reply by the Buddha or preparations of the place where the meeting with the king is to take place. (^356) The _Kaṇṇakatthala-sutta_ just describes that the king approached the Buddha and paid respect, without giving any further details. (^357) In the _Kaṇṇakatthala-sutta_ the king does not praise the Buddha’s reply. (^358) In the _Kaṇṇakatthala-sutta_ the general only takes an active part in the discussion after the Buddha has explained that only _deva_ s subject to ill-will are reborn in this world. In the Pāli version the general then just asks if the one type of _deva_ can topple the other one. (^359) Adopting a variant without 天天. (^360) Instead of a remark on purity as the basis for designating Brahmās, in the _Kaṇṇa - katthala-sutta_ the Buddha just queries why the king had asked this. When the king explains that he wants to know if Brahmās are reborn in this world, the Buddha replies that this is the case for Brahmās who still have ill-will. (^361) The Pāli parallel is the _Dhammacetiya-sutta,_ MN 89 at MN II 118 (see also AN 10.30 at AN V 65); for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 510–519. (^362) Adopting a variant without 外. (^363) In the _Dhammacetiya-sutta_ he kisses and caresses the Buddha’s feet. (^364) The translation is based on emending the sequence of two characters, reading 法有 instead of 有法. (^365) Adopting a variant without 諸. (^366) This reason for the king’s faith is not mentioned in the _Dhammacetiya-sutta;_ for a survey of variations between the two lists see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ p. 513, table 9.6. (^367) The _Dhammacetiya-sutta_ describes clever debaters who are warriors, brahmins, house- holders, or renunciants, each of whom is converted. (^368) In the _Dhammacetiya-sutta_ the person merely clears his throat. (^369) Adopting the variant reading 征 instead of 仙. (^370) In the _Dhammacetiya-sutta,_ where the topic of the two courtiers amounts to a single reason for the king’s faith, the two spend most of the night in talk about the Dharma.

Notes

(^371) The _Dhammacetiya-sutta_ does not have a comparison of the Buddha’s “kingship” to that of Pasenadi. (^372) In the _Dhammacetiya-sutta_ the Buddha just addresses the monks present, without asking Ānanda to summon them. (^373) The Pāli parallel is the _Bāhitika-sutta,_ MN 88 at MN II 112; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 505–510; _Madhyama- āgama Studies,_ pp. 175–194. (^374) Such an inquiry by Ānanda is not found in the _Bāhitika-sutta._ (^375) The _Bāhitika-sutta_ reports only a single instance of the king’s invitation and Ānanda’s declining. (^376) Adopting the variant 聞 instead of 問. (^377) The ensuing exposition has no counterpart in the _Bāhitika-sutta,_ which instead takes up verbal and mental conduct. The same difference holds for the case of wholesome conduct. (^378) In the _Bāhitika-sutta_ Ānanda offers the cloth to the Buddha. (^379) The question of a possible misrepresentation by Ānanda does not arise in the _Bāhitika- sutta,_ where the Buddha just tells the other monks that it is a great gain for the king to have met Ānanda. (^380) The Pāli parallel is the _Paṭhamakosala-sutta,_ AN 10.29 at AN V 59. (^381) The otherwise similar list in the _Paṭhamakosala-sutta_ does not mention any sons of _deva_ s. (^382) The sequence of topics differs in the _Paṭhamakosala-sutta,_ which at this juncture lists the ten all-encompassing spheres ( _kasiṇa_ s). (^383) The association of the flowers with colors in the _Paṭhamakosala-sutta_ differs. (^384) Adopting the CBETA emendation of 大白 to 太白. (^385) For the passage from here to the end of the discourse the Taishō edition offers two versions. The first version (800b19–25) is kept in the main text; the second (800c1–

14. is given as an indented block at the beginning of register “c.” The second version is the more coherent, despite the discrepancy mentioned in the following note 386. It is therefore adopted as the basis for the present translation. (^386) The translation is based on emending “also inferior” to become “superior.” In the _Paṭhamakosala-sutta_ the pleasant and swift mode of progress is reckoned the best of the four. (^387) Adopting a variant without 知. (^388) The Pāli parallel is the _Piyajātika-sutta,_ MN 87 at MN II 106; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 502–505.

Notes

(^389) In the _Piyajātika-sutta_ Mallikā herself sends the brahmin to inquire about this statement by the Buddha. (^390) Here and below, the _Piyajātika-sutta_ separately takes up the case of a woman and of a man afflicted by the death of a close relative. (^391) In the _Piyajātika-sutta_ the brahmin reports the conversation to Mallikā. (^392) In the _Piyajātika-sutta_ those for whom the king feels affection are listed in a different sequence, namely: the princess Vajīrī, the queen Vāsabhā, the general Viḍūḍabha, Mallikā herself, and lastly Kāsi and Kosala. The minister Sirivaḍḍha and the king’s elephant are not mentioned. (^393) The _Piyajātika-sutta_ does not report that King Pasenadi took refuge. (^394) The Pāli parallel is the _Aṭṭhakanāgara-sutta,_ MN 52 at MN I 349, which reports that Ānanda was staying at Beluvagāmaka near Vesālī; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 309–313. (^395) The introductory narration to the _Aṭṭhakanāgara-sutta_ is shorter, reporting only that the householder had come to Pāṭaliputta for some business and had then inquired from one monk where Ānanda is staying. It also differs in not referring to the Buddha’s _parinirvāṇa,_ though this event is implicit in its failure to mention the Buddha’s whereabouts. (^396) Instead of contemplation of dharmas, the _Aṭṭhakanāgara-sutta_ recommends reviewing the attainment as impermanent and conditioned. (^397) The translation is based on emending 彼 to read 彼間, in line with the formulation usually employed in the _Madhyama-āgama_ to describe the rebirth of a nonreturner. (^398) The _Aṭṭhakanāgara-sutta_ does not mention the attainment of neither-perception-nor- nonperception. (^399) The twelve Dharma doors are the four _jhāna_ s, the four _brahmavihāra_ s, and the four immaterial spheres. The _Aṭṭhakanāgara-sutta_ has eleven, as it does not refer to the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception. (^400) The _Aṭṭhakanāgara-sutta_ does not mention that Ānanda handed the building over to the sangha. (^401) Chizen Akanuma, _The Comparative Catalogue of Chinese Āgamas & Pāli Nikāyas_ (1929) (Delhi: Sri Satguru, 1990), p. 25, lists as a parallel for MĀ 220 the _Avyākata- sutta,_ AN 7.51 at AN IV 67. Yet this discourse differs substantially from MĀ 220. It features the Buddha and a monk, the topic is only the four undeclared questions regard- ing the tathāgata, and the issue at stake is not the Buddha’s understanding of these, but rather the contrast between the worlding and the stream-enterer. This makes it safe to conclude that AN 7.51 and MĀ 220 are not parallels properly speaking. (^402) Adopting the variant 見 instead of 具.

Notes

(^403) The formulation adopts the standard pericope, even though the Buddha, having already passed away, will no longer be able to accept the brahmin as a lay disciple. (^404) The Pāli parallel is the _Cūḷamāluṅkya-sutta,_ MN 63 at MN I 426; for a comparative study see Anālayo, _A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya,_ pp. 353–355. (^405) In the _Cūḷamāluṅkya-sutta_ he even states before the Buddha that he will disrobe unless he receives a reply. **Appendix: Tables of Parallels** (^406) These two tables draw, in part, on earlier published tables of parallel discourses, espe- cially Bhikkhu Anālayo and Roderick S. Bucknell, “Correspondence Table for Parallels to the Discourses of _Majjhima Nikāya:_ Toward a Revision of Akanuma’s _Comparative Catalogue,_ ” _Journal of the Centre for Buddhist Studies, Sri Lanka_ 4 (2006): 215–

238. Such tables, particularly between Pāli and Chinese, are an increasingly widely used research tool for the study of Early Buddhism. The best-known example is Akanuma’s _The Comparative Catalogue of Chinese Āgamas & Pāli Nikāyas._ For a historical survey of such tables and catalogues, from their beginnings in 1883 to the present, see Roderick S. Bucknell, “Catalogues of Parallel Buddhist Sūtras in Pali, Chinese, Sanskrit, and Other Languages,” in _Proceedings of the 13th Wuyue Buddhist Academic Forum_ (Hangzhou: Hangzhou Buddhist Academy, 2016) pp. 427–441.

(^407) Twenty-one _Madhyama-āgama_ discourses have no known Pāli parallel, namely: MĀ 7 (T I /BDK I 38), MĀ 39 (T I /BDK I 300), MĀ 54 (T I /BDK I 343), MĀ 60 (T I /BDK I 365), MĀ 65 (T I /BDK I 422), MĀ 69 (T I /BDK I 477), MĀ 80 (T I /BDK II 87), MĀ 86 (T I /BDK II 132), MĀ 92 (T I /BDK II 188), MĀ 106 (T I /BDK II 293), MĀ 139 (T I /BDK III 108), MĀ 147 (T I /BDK III 162), MĀ 148 (T I /BDK III 167), MĀ 159 (T I /BDK III 268), MĀ 168 (T I /BDK III 353), MĀ 176 (T I /BDK III 415), MĀ 177 (T I /BDK III 428), MĀ 218 (T I /BDK IV 359), MĀ 219 (T I /BDK IV 360), MĀ 220 (T I /BDK IV 362), MĀ 222 (T I /BDK IV 371).

(^409) The probable mechanism of this partial scattering is discussed in Bucknell, “The Structure of the Sanskrit _Dīrgha-āgama,_ ” pp. 86, 89–91. (^410) Bucknell, “The Structure of the Sanskrit _Dīrgha-āgama,_ ” pp. 61–64.

(^412) Here, too, the analysis yields a viable explanation for this scattering; see Bucknell, “The Structure of the Sanskrit _Dīrgha-āgama,_ ” pp. 86–89.
