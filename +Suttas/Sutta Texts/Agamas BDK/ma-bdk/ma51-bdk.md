### 51. The Discourse on the Beginning

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: One cannot know the point where craving for existence began, the point before which there was no craving for existence and at which craving for existence arose. But one can understand the causes for crav- ing for existence. Craving for existence is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is craving for existence conditioned? The answer is: it is conditioned by ignorance. Ignorance too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is ignorance conditioned? The answer is: it is conditioned by the five hindrances. The five hindrances too are conditioned; they are not without conditions. By what are the five hindrances conditioned? The answer is: they are conditioned by the three types of wrong conduct (bodily, verbal, and mental). The three types of wrong conduct too are conditioned; they are not without conditions.

By what are the three types of wrong conduct conditioned? The answer is: they are conditioned by failure to guard the sense faculties. Failure to guard the sense faculties too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is failure to guard the sense faculties conditioned? The answer is: it is conditioned by lack of right mindfulness and right atten tiveness. Lack of right mindfulness and right attentiveness too is con ditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is lack of right mindfulness and right attentiveness con ditioned? The answer is: it is conditioned by lack of right attention. Lack of right attention too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is lack of right attention conditioned? The answer is: it is conditioned by lack of faith. Lack of faith too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is lack of faith conditioned? The answer is: it is conditioned by hearing wrong teachings. Hearing wrong teachings too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is hearing wrong teachings conditioned? The answer is: it is conditioned by association with bad friends. Association with bad friends too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is association with bad friends conditioned? The answer is: it is conditioned by bad people. That is to say, once there are bad people, there will be association with bad friends. Once there is asso ciation with bad friends, there will be hearing of wrong teachings. Once there is hearing of wrong teachings, there will be lack of faith. Once there is lack of faith, there will be lack of right attention. Once there is lack of right attention, there will be lack of right mindfulness and right attentiveness. Once there is lack of right mindfulness and right attentiveness, there will be failure to guard the sense faculties. Once there is failure to guard the sense faculties, there will be the three types of wrong conduct. Once there are the three types of wrong con duct, there will be the five hindrances. Once there are the five hin drances, there will be ignorance. And once there is ignorance, there will be craving for existence. This is how, step by step, craving for existence comes about.

[Likewise,] wisdom and liberation are conditioned; they are not without conditions. By what are wisdom and liberation conditioned? The answer is: they are conditioned by the seven factors of awakening. The seven fac- tors of awakening too are conditioned; they are not without conditions. By what are the seven factors of awakening conditioned? The answer is: they are conditioned by the four establishments of mindful- ness. The four establishments of mindfulness too are conditioned; they are not without conditions. By what are the four establishments of mindfulness conditioned? The answer is: they are conditioned by the three types of good conduct. The three types of good conduct too are conditioned; they are not with- out conditions. By what are the three types of good conduct conditioned? The answer is: they are conditioned by guarding the sense faculties. Guarding the sense faculties too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is guarding of the sense faculties conditioned? The answer is: it is conditioned by right mindfulness and right attentiveness. Right mindfulness and right attentiveness too are conditioned; they are not without conditions. By what are right mindfulness and right attentiveness conditioned? The answer is: they are conditioned by right attention. Right attention too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is right attention conditioned? The answer is: it is con- ditioned by faith. Faith too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is faith conditioned? The answer is: it is conditioned by hearing the true Dharma. Hearing the true Dharma too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is hearing the true Dharma conditioned? The answer is: it is conditioned by association with good friends. Association with good friends too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is association with good friends conditioned? The answer is: it is conditioned by good people. That is to say, because there are good people, there will be association with good friends. Once there

is association with good friends, there will be hearing of the true Dharma. Once there is hearing of the true Dharma, faith will be engen dered. Once faith is engendered, there will be right attention. Once there is right attention, there will be right mindfulness and right atten tiveness. Once there is right mindfulness and right attentiveness, there will be guarding of the sense faculties. Once there is guarding of the sense faculties, there will be the three types of good conduct. Once there are the three types of good conduct, there will be the four estab lishments of mindfulness. Once there are the four establishments of mindfulness, there will be the seven factors of awakening. Once there are the seven factors of awakening, there will be wisdom and liberation. This is how, step by step, wisdom and liberation come about. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
