### 174. The Discourse on Ways of Practice (1)

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: In the world there are actually four ways of practice. What are the four? There is a way of practice that is pleasant now but results in future pain; there is a way of practice that is painful now but results in future pleasure; there is a way of practice that is painful now and results in future pain; and there is a way of practice that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure.^403 What is the way of practice that is pleasant now but results in future pain? There are some renunciants and brahmins who amuse themselves with prettily adorned girls, saying, “What is the future dread that these [other] renunciants and brahmins see in sensual desires? What is the disaster [on account of which] they cut off sensual desires and advocate the cutting off of sensual desires? The bodies of these prettily adorned girls are pleas- urable, pleasant to touch!” They amuse themselves with these girls, indulging themselves with them. While engaging in this practice, they are

fully satisfied with it. [But] with the breaking up of the body at death they go to a bad realm, being reborn in hell. [Only] then do they think, “This is the future dread that those [other] renunciants and brahmins saw in sensual desires. This is the disaster on account of which they cut off sensual desires and advocated the cutting off of sensual desires. It is because of sensual desires, through being subject to sensual desires, on account of sensual desires, that we are now experiencing such extreme suffering, such severe suffering.” It is just as when, in the last month of the hot season, in the extreme daytime heat, a pod of the _māluva_ creeper splits open and a seed from it falls at the foot of a _sāla_ tree. Then, because of that, dread arises in the tree spirit in that _sāla_ tree. At this the relatives and friends of that tree spirit—village spirits in the vicinity of that seed [such as] the tree spirits of the numerous village cereal crops and medicinal plants—see future dread and disaster in that seed, and they therefore approach that tree spirit and console it, saying, “Tree spirit, do not be afraid! Tree spirit, do not be afraid! This seed will be eaten by a deer, or it will be eaten by a peacock, or it will be blown away by the wind, or it will be burned in a village fire, or it will be burned in a grass fire, or it will rot and become unable to sprout. In these ways, tree spirit, you will be safe.” [But] suppose that this seed is not eaten by a deer, not eaten by a peacock, not blown away by the wind, not burned in a village fire, not burned in a grass fire, and does not rot and become unable to sprout; this seed is not deficient, not punc- tured, and not cracked; it is not damaged by wind, rain, or sun. It is sprin- kled with abundant rain and quickly grows. Then that tree spirit thinks, “How is this? What is the future dread that my relatives and friends—village spirits in the vicinity of that seed [such as] the tree spirits of the numerous village cereal crops and medicinal plants—saw in that seed? What is the disaster on account of which they came and consoled me, saying, ‘Tree spirit, do not be afraid! Tree spirit, do not be afraid! This seed will be eaten by a deer, or it will be eaten by a peacock, or it will be blown away by the wind, or it will be burned in a village fire, or it will be burned in a grass fire, or it will rot and become unable to sprout. In these ways, tree spirit, you will be safe.’

“For this seed was not eaten by a deer, not eaten by a peacock, not blown away by the wind, not burned in a village fire, not burned in a grass fire, and did not rot and become unable to sprout; this seed was not defi cient, not punctured, and not cracked; it was not damaged by wind, rain, or sun. It was sprinkled by abundant rain and has quickly grown. “It has developed stems, branches, and leaves, tender and soft. It has developed joints and become very pleasant to the touch!” Those stems, branches, and leaves, tender and soft, and those joints that have become very pleasant to the touch become ever more pleasant to the touch. Because of the tree they develop into great branches, joints, and leaves, which surround that tree and cover it up to the top. [Only] when it has become covered up right to the top does the tree spirit think, “This is the future dread that my relatives and friends—village spirits in the vicinity of that seed [such as] the tree spirits of the numerous village cereal crops and medicinal plants—saw in that seed. This is the disaster on account of which they came and consoled me, saying, ‘Tree spirit, do not be afraid! Tree spirit, do not be afraid! This seed will be eaten by a deer, or it will be eaten by a peacock, or it will be blown away by the wind, or it will be burned in a village fire, or it will be burned in a grass fire, or it will rot and become unable to sprout. In these ways, tree spirit, you will be safe.’ “Yet, this seed was not eaten by a deer, not eaten by a peacock, not blown away by the wind, not burned in a village fire, not burned in a grass fire, and did not rot and become unable to sprout; this seed was not defi cient, not punctured, and not cracked; it was not damaged by wind, rain, or sun. It was sprinkled by abundant rain and quickly grew. It is because of that seed, on account of that seed, that I am now experiencing such extreme suffering, such severe suffering.” In the same way, there are some renunciants and brahmins who amuse themselves with prettily adorned girls, saying, “What is the future dread that these [other] renunciants and brahmins see in sensual desires? What is the disaster [on account of which] they cut off sensual desires and advo cate the cutting off of sensual desires? The bodies of these prettily adorned girls are pleasurable, pleasant to the touch.” They amuse themselves with these girls, indulging themselves with it. While engaging in this practice,

they are fully satisfied with it. [But] with the breaking up of the body at death they go to a bad realm, being reborn in hell. Only then do they think, “This is the future dread that those renunciants and brahmins saw in sensual desires; this is the disaster on account of which they cut off sensual desires and advocated the cutting off of sensual desires. It is because of sensual desires, through being subject to sensual desires, on account of sensual desires, that we are now experiencing such extreme suffering, such severe suffering.” This is the way of practice that is pleasant now but results in future pain. What is the way of practice that is painful now but results in future pleasure? Suppose that someone is by nature strongly polluted by sensual desire, strongly polluted by anger, strongly polluted by delusion. Being frequently under the influence of sensual desire, his mind experiences pain, grief, and sorrow. Being frequently under the influence of anger... of delusion, his mind experiences pain, grief, and sorrow. Pained and aggrieved, he lives the holy life for his whole life... up to... crying and in tears. While engaging in this practice, he is fully satisfied with it; and with the breaking up of the body at death he certainly ascends to a good realm, being reborn in heaven. This is the way of practice that is painful now but results in future pleasure. What is the way of practice that is painful now and results in future pain? There are some renunciants and brahmins who go naked, unclothed, who use their hands as clothes [to cover their private parts], or use leaves as clothes, or use beads as clothes; who will not use a pot to get water, or will not use a ladle to get water; who will not eat food [obtained by others] by robbery with blade and cudgel; who will not eat food obtained by deception, or by personally approaching [a donor], or by sending a mes- senger [to get it], or [when called thus]: “Come, venerable sir!” or “Wel- come, venerable sir!” or “Stay, venerable sir!” Or who, when two are eating together, will not eat with them; or who will not eat food from a house where there is a pregnant woman, or from a house where there is a pet dog; or who will not eat food from a house where there are flies that have been around excrement; or who do not eat fish, do not eat meat, do not drink liquor, do not drink water [considered

as] evil, or do not drink at all but train in the practice of not drinking; or who eat one mouthful and are content with one mouthful, or eat two mouthfuls, or three, four... or at most seven mouthfuls and are content with seven mouthfuls. Or who eat [only the almsfood] they obtain at a single [house] and are content with what they obtain at a single [house], or at two [houses], or three, four... or at most seven [houses] and are content with what they obtain at seven [houses]; or who have one meal a day and are content with one meal, or one meal in two days, or in three, four, five, six, or seven days, or in a fortnight, or who have one meal in a month and are content with one meal [in a month]. Or who eat edible roots, or wild rice, or millet, or rice bran, or rice scum, or coarse food; who go to the forest and live off [what they find] in the forest, or eat roots or eat fruit, or eat fallen fruit. Or who clothe themselves in patchwork robes, or in robes made of hair, or in robes made of coarse fabric, or in robes made of hair and coarse fabric; or who wear complete hides, or wear pierced hides, or wear com plete pierced hides; who keep their hair disheveled, or keep their hair in braids, or keep their hair disheveled and in braids, or shave off their hair, or shave off their beard, or shave off their hair and beard,^404 or tear out their hair, or tear out their beard, or tear out their hair and beard. Or who stand continuously, abstaining from sitting; or move about in a squatting position; or lie down on thorns, using a bed of thorns; or lie down on fruits, using a bed of fruit; or who worship water day and night, pouring it out with their hands; or who worship fire, keeping it burning continuously. Or who worship the sun and moon, revering them as spirits of great might, and extending their hands with joined palms toward them. In these ways they experience immeasurable suffering, practicing self mortification. While engaging in this practice, they are fully satisfied with it; and with the breaking up of the body at death they certainly go to a bad realm, being reborn in hell. This is the way of practice that is painful now and results in future pain. What is the way of practice that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure? Suppose someone is by nature not strongly polluted by sensual desire, not strongly polluted by anger, not strongly polluted by delusion.

Not being frequently under the influence of sensual desire, his mind does not experience pain, grief, and sorrow. Not being frequently under the influence of anger... of delusion, his mind does not experience pain, grief, and sorrow. Happy and joyful, he lives the holy life for his whole life... up to... with a cheerful mind. While engaging in this practice, he is fully satisfied with it; and, having eradicated the five lower fetters, he will be spontaneously born and attain final nirvana there.^405 Having attained the condition of nonreturning, he will not come back to this world.^406 This is the way of practice that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure. It was in relation to this that I said, “In the world there are actually these four ways of practice.” Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
