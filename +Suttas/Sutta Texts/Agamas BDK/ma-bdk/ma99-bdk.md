### 99. The [First] Discourse on the Mass of Dukkha

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time, after the midday meal, the monks were seated together in the assembly hall for some small matter, when many heterodox practitioners, who were roaming around after midday, approached the monks.^239 Having exchanged greetings, stepped back, and sat to one side, they said to the monks:

Venerable friends, the renunciant Gotama sets forth penetrative knowledge of sensual pleasures, he sets forth penetrative knowledge of material form, and he sets forth penetrative knowledge of feelings. Venerable friends, we too set forth penetrative knowledge of sensual pleasures, set forth pen- etrative knowledge of material form, and set forth penetrative knowledge of feelings. In regard to these two knowledges and these two penetrations [set forth by] the renunciant Gotama and by ourselves, which is superior [or inferior] and what is different? Then the monks, hearing what the many heterodox practitioners had said, neither agreed nor disagreed but silently got up and left, thinking: “From the World-honored One we shall obtain an understanding of what has thus been said.” Then they approached the Buddha. Having paid homage with their heads [at his feet], stepped back, and sat to one side, they told the Buddha the whole discussion they had had with the many heterodox practitioners. Then the World-honored One told the monks: You should have right away asked the many heterodox practitioners this: “Venerable friends, what is the gratification ( _assāda_ ) in sensual pleasures, what is the danger ( _ādīnava_ ) in sensual pleasures, and what is the escape ( _nissaraṇa_ ) from sensual pleasures? What is the gratification in material form, what is the danger in material form, and what is the escape from material form? What is the gratification in feelings, what is the danger in feelings, and what is the escape from feelings?” Monks, if you had asked them this, then on hearing [these questions] they would have found it hard to respond. They would have [diverted the] talk to some other topic, would have become more and more upset, and [in the end] would certainly have risen up from their seats and withdrawn in silence. Why is that?

I do not see in this world, with its _deva_ s and _māra_ s, Brahmās, renun- ciants, and brahmins, and all other assemblies, anyone who is able to understand and expound the significance of this, excepting the Tathāgata, a disciple of the Tathāgata, or someone who has heard it from them.

The Buddha said:

What is the gratification in sensual pleasures? It is the pleasure and joy that arises in dependence on the five cords of sensual pleasure. This is the foremost gratification in sensual pleasures with nothing beyond it, [yet] it is beset by much danger. What is the danger in sensual pleasures? A clansman uses whatever ability or skill he has to gain his livelihood, whether it is farming, trading, using scholarly knowledge, skill in accountancy, knowledge of calculation, skill in carving seals, composing documents, making pens, understanding sacred texts, serving as a brave general, or attending the king. When it is cold, he is [afflicted by] cold; when it is hot, he is [afflicted by] heat; he becomes hungry, thirsty, and tired, and is stung by mosquitoes and gadflies as he undertakes such work in his quest for wealth. If that clansman, making such efforts, engaged in such activity and such striving, does not obtain wealth, then he experiences sorrow and pain, he worries and grieves, is upset and vexed, and bewilderment arises in his mind. He says [to himself], “My undertakings are in vain, my suf- fering is in vain, my striving is unsuccessful!” If, [however,] that clansman, making such efforts, engaged in such activity and such striving, does obtain wealth, then he cherishes and values it, guarding it in a concealed storeroom. Why is that? [Because he thinks,] “May this wealth of mine not be taken away forcibly by kings, stolen by thieves, or burned up in fire; may it not rot and decay or become lost! May none of my money go out without making profit, or be employed for any undertaking that fails!” [For these reasons,] he guards [his wealth] thus, in a concealed storeroom. If it is taken away forcibly by kings, stolen by thieves, burned in a fire, spoiled, destroyed, ruined, or lost, then sorrow and pain arise. He worries and grieves, is upset and vexed, and bewilderment arises in his mind, as

he says [to himself,] “That which I cherished for a long time is now ruined and lost.” This is what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the present, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source.^240 Again, [among] living beings, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, a mother quarrels with her child, or a child quarrels with its mother, a father [quarrels with] his child,... an elder brother with his younger brother,... an elder sister with her younger sister,... or relatives quarrel with one another. Having quarreled like this, a mother speaks badly of her child, a child speaks badly of its mother, a father [speaks badly] of his child... an elder brother of his younger brother,... an elder sister of her younger sister,... and relatives speak badly of one another, let alone other people.^241 This is what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the present, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleas ures as its source. Again, [among] living beings, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sen sual pleasures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, kings quarrel with kings, brahmins quarrel with brahmins, householders quarrel with householders, citizens quarrel with citizens, and countries quarrel with countries. Because they quarrel with and hate one another they take up various kinds of weapons to harm each other, striking [each other] with their fists, or hurling stones [at each other], or hitting [each other] with sticks, or cutting [each other] with swords. During the quarrel they may die or become terrified, experiencing extreme suffering. This is what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the present, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as the condition, sensual pleasures as the source, living beings put on armor and coats [of mail], take up lances or bows and arrows, or wield swords and shields and go into battle. They fight on elephants, horses, or chariots, or as foot soldiers, or they fight as [ordinary] people.^242 During the battle they may die or become terrified, experiencing extreme suffering. This is what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the present, which has sensual

pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleas- ures as its source. Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, living beings put on armor and coats [of mail], take up lances or bows and arrows, or wield swords and shields, and [set out to] conquer another country. They besiege a city and destroy its fortifications, lining up in battle array to the beating of drums, the blowing of horns, and loud shouting. They strike with hammers, or they use spears and halberds, or they use cutting wheels, or they shoot arrows, or they hurl down rocks, or they use great catapults, or they pour down molten copper pellets. During the battle they may die or become terrified, experiencing extreme suffering. This is what is meant by a mass of _dukkha_ in the present, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, living beings put on armor or coats [of mail], take up lances or bows and arrows, or wield swords and shields, and advance into a village, a town, a country, or a city. They break through walls and open up storerooms to steal property. They inter- cept [travelers] on the king’s highway or reach out to other streets. They destroy villages, damage towns, wipe out countries, and break up cities. In the process they may be caught by the king’s men, who subject them to various punishments, such as cutting off their hands, their feet, or both hands and feet; cutting off their ears, their nose, or both ears and nose; or slicing strips [of flesh] off them, or tearing out their beards, their hair, or both beards and hair; or putting them in a cage and setting fire to their clothing, or wrapping them in straw and setting fire to it, or placing them in the belly of an “iron donkey” or in the mouth of an “iron pig” or in the mouth of an “iron tiger” and then heating it up; or placing them in a copper or iron cauldron and boiling them; or cutting them into pieces, or stabbing them with sharp forks, or hooking them with iron hooks, or laying them down on an iron bed and scalding them with boiling oil, or seating them in an iron mortar and pounding them with an iron pestle, or letting them be bitten by snakes or serpents, or whipping them with whips, or beating them with staves, or hitting them with clubs, or impaling them alive on a tall post, or decapitating them.

In the process they will die or become terrified, experiencing extreme suffering. This is what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the present, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, living beings do evil bodily verbal, and mental deeds. At a later time they are afflicted by disease and lie on their beds, or sit or lie on the ground, with pain oppressing their body, experiencing extremely severe pain that is not at all desirable. At the time of death their evil bodily, verbal, and mental deeds manifest before them and envelop them. It is just as when at sunset, the shadow of a great mountain peak envelops the earth—in the same way their evil bodily, verbal, and mental deeds manifest before them and envelop them.^243 They think: “Formerly I did evil deeds, which are [now] manifesting before me and enveloping me. Formerly I did not perform meritorious acts; I performed many evil acts. If there is a place where people are reborn who do what is evil, bad, and harmful, who only commit crimes, who make no merit and do no good deeds, who are without fear [of the con sequences of their deeds], without reliance, without a refuge, then I will certainly be reborn there.” From this they feel regret, and being regretful they have a bad death, and their life ends without merit. This is what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the present, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, living beings do evil bodily, verbal, and mental deeds. Because of those evil bodily, verbal, and mental deeds, with this as the cause, with this as the condition, on the breaking up of the body at death they will certainly go to a bad realm and be reborn in hell. This is what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the next life that has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. This is what is meant by the danger of sensual pleasures. What is the escape from sensual pleasures? The abandoning and dis carding of sensual pleasures, the relinquishing and renunciation of sensual

pleasures, the cessation of sensual pleasures, the eradication of sensual pleasures, the transcending of and escaping from sensual pleasures—this is what is meant by the escape from sensual pleasures. Any renunciants or brahmins who do not know, as it really is, the grat- ification in sensual pleasures, the danger in sensual pleasures, and the escape from sensual pleasures are totally unable to abandon sensual pleasures them- selves. How then could they cause others to abandon sensual pleasures? Any renunciants or brahmins who know, as it really is, the gratification in sensual pleasures, the danger in sensual pleasures, and the escape from sensual pleasures are able to discard [sensual pleasures] themselves and also able to cause others to abandon sensual pleasures. What is the gratification in material form? Suppose there is a girl from the warrior, brahmin, merchant, or worker [caste], fourteen or fifteen years old. At that time her physical beauty is at its most excellent. The pleasure and joy that arise with her physical beauty as its cause, with her physical beauty as its condition, that is the foremost gratification in material form. Nothing excels it, [yet] it is beset by much danger. What is the danger in material form? Suppose one were to see that beautiful girl at a later time when she has become extremely old and feeble, her hair turned white and teeth fallen out, with hunched back and unsteady on her feet, leaning on a stick to walk, with deteriorating health, her life span approaching its end, her body trembling, and her sense fac- ulties failing. What do you think? Has her former physical beauty ceased and its dan- ger manifested?

[The monks] replied, “Yes indeed.” [The Buddha said:]

Again, suppose one were to see that [formerly] beautiful girl afflicted with disease, lying on a bed, or sitting or lying on the ground, with pain oppressing her body, experiencing extremely severe pain. What do you think? Has her former physical beauty ceased and its danger manifested?

[The monks] replied, “Yes indeed.” [The Buddha said:]

Again, suppose one were to see [the corpse of] that [formerly] beautiful girl, dead for one, two days, or up to six or seven days, being pecked at by crows and hawks, devoured by jackals and wolves, burned by fire or buried in the earth, or completely rotten and decomposed. What do you think? Has her former physical beauty ceased and its danger manifested? [The monks] replied, “Yes indeed.” [The Buddha said:] Again, suppose one were to see [the corpse of] that [formerly] beautiful girl in a charnel ground as a carcass of bluish color, decomposed and half eaten [by animals], with the skeleton lying on the ground still connected together. What do you think? Has her former physical beauty ceased and its danger manifested? [The monks] replied, “Yes indeed.” [The Buddha said:] Again, suppose one were to see [the skeleton of] that beautiful girl in a charnel ground without skin, flesh, or blood, held together only by sinews. What do you think: has her former physical beauty ceased and its danger manifested? [The monks] replied, “Yes indeed.” [The Buddha said:] Again, suppose one were to see [the bones of] that [formerly] beautiful girl in a charnel ground, disconnected bones scattered in all directions: feet bones, shin bones, thigh bones, hip bone, vertebrae, shoulder bones, neck bones, and a skull, all in different places. What do you think: has her former physical beauty ceased and its danger manifested? [The monks] replied, “Yes indeed.” [The Buddha said:] Again, suppose one were to see [the bones of] that [formerly] beautiful girl in a charnel ground, bones white like shells, or bluish like the color of pigeons, or red as if smeared with blood, rotting and decomposing, in

bits and pieces. What do you think? Has her former physical beauty ceased and its danger manifested?

[The monks] replied, “Yes indeed.” [The Buddha said:]

This is what is meant by the danger in material form. What is the escape from material form? The abandoning and discarding of material form, the relinquishing and renouncing of material form, the cessation of material form, the eradicating of material form, the transcending of and escape from material form—this is what is meant by the escape from material form. Any renunciants or brahmins who do not know, as it really is, the grat- ification in material form, the danger in material form, and the escape from material form are totally unable to abandon material form themselves. How then could they cause others to abandon material form? Any renunciants or brahmins who know, as it really is, the gratification in material form, the danger in material form, and the escape from material form are able to discard [material form] themselves and also able to cause others to abandon material form. What is the gratification in feelings? Secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states, a monk dwells having attained... up to... the fourth absorption. At that time he has neither harmful intentions toward himself nor harmful intentions toward others. Being without harmful intentions is what is meant by the pleasure and gratification in feeling. Why is that? [Because] one who is without harmful intentions accomplishes such happiness. This is what is meant by the grat- ification in feelings. What is the danger in feelings? Feelings are of an impermanent nature, of an unsatisfactory nature, of a nature to cease. This is what is meant by the danger in feelings. What is the escape from feelings? The abandoning and discarding of feelings, the relinquishing and renouncing of feelings, the cessation of feelings, the eradication of feelings, the transcending of and escape from feelings—this is what is meant by the escape from feelings.

Any renunciants or brahmins who do not know, as it really is, the grat ification in feelings, the danger in feelings, and the escape from feelings are totally unable to abandon feelings themselves. How then could they cause others to abandon feelings? Any renunciants or brahmins who know, as it really is, the gratification in feelings, the danger in feelings, and the escape from feelings definitely are able to discard [feelings] themselves and also able to cause others to abandon feelings. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
