### 46. The [Second] Discourse on Shame and Scruples

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks: Venerable friends, if a monk is without shame or scruples, this is detri mental to love and respect. Lack of love and respect is detrimental to faith. Lack of faith is detrimental to right attention. Lack of right atten tion is detrimental to right mindfulness and right attentiveness. Lack of right mindfulness and right attentiveness is detrimental to guarding the sense faculties, keeping the precepts, being without regret, expe riencing joy, rapture, tranquility, happiness, concentration, seeing and knowing things as they really are, disenchantment, dispassion, and lib eration. And lack of liberation is detrimental to [attaining] nirvana. Venerable friends, it is just as with a tree. If the outer bark is dam aged, then the sapwood does not develop successfully. If the sapwood does not develop successfully, then the trunk, stem, heartwood, boughs and branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit all cannot develop successfully. Venerable friends, know that it is the same with a monk. If he is without shame or scruple, then this is detrimental to love and respect. Lack of love and respect is detrimental to faith. Lack of faith is detrimental to right attention. Lack of right attention is detrimental to right mindfulness

and right attentiveness. Lack of right mindfulness and right attentiveness is detrimental to guarding the sense faculties, keeping the precepts, being without regret, experiencing joy, rapture, tranquility, happiness, concentration, seeing and knowing things as they really are, disen- chantment, dispassion, and liberation. And lack of liberation is detri- mental to [attaining] nirvana. If, [however,] venerable friends, a monk has shame and scruple, the condition for love and respect exists. If there is love and respect, the condition for faith exists. If there is faith, the condition for right attention exists. If there is right attention, the condition for right mind- fulness and right attentiveness exists. If there is right mindfulness and right attentiveness, the condition exists for guarding the sense faculties, keeping the precepts, being without regret, experiencing joy, rapture, tranquility, happiness, concentration, seeing and knowing things as they really are, disenchantment, dispassion, and liberation. And if there is liberation, the condition exists for [attaining] nirvana. Venerable friends, it is just as with a tree. If the outer bark is not damaged, the sapwood can develop successfully. If the sapwood devel- ops successfully, then the trunk, stem, heartwood, boughs and branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit all can develop successfully. Venerable friends, know that it is the same with a monk. If there is shame and scruples, the condition for love and respect exists. If there is love and respect, the condition for faith exists. If there is faith, the condition for right attention exists. If there is right attention, the con- dition for right mindfulness and right attentiveness exists. If there are right mindfulness and right attentiveness, the condition exists for guard- ing the sense faculties, keeping the precepts, being without regret, experiencing joy, rapture, tranquility, happiness, concentration, seeing and knowing things as they really are, disenchantment, dispassion, and liberation. And if there is liberation, the condition exists for [attaining] nirvana. This is what Venerable Sāriputta said. Having heard the words of Ven- erable Sāriputta, those monks were delighted and remembered them well.
