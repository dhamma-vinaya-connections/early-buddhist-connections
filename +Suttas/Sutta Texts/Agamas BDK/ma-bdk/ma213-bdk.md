### 213. The Discourse on Adornments of the Dharma

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans in a Sakyan town called Medaḷumpa. At that time King Pasenadi of Kosala and [his commander-in-chief] Dīgha Kārāyaṇa had for some matter gone out together to a town called Nagaraka. On arriving at its pleasure park, King Pasenadi of Kosala saw places beneath the trees that were quiet, free of noise, secluded, without disturbance, without people, suitable for sitting in meditation. Seeing this, he was reminded of the World-honored One. King Pasenadi of Kosala said: Now, Dīgha Kārāyaṇa, these places beneath the trees are quiet, free of noise, secluded, without disturbance, without people, suitable for sitting in meditation. In such places I have often seen the Buddha. Dīgha Kārāyaṇa, where is the World-honored One now? I wish to go and visit him. Dīgha Kārāyaṇa answered, “Your Majesty, I heard that the World-honored One is staying among the Sakyans in a Sakyan town called Medaḷumpa.” King Pasenadi of Kosala said again, “Dīgha Kārāyaṇa, how far from here is the Sakyan town called Medaḷumpa?” Dīgha Kārāyaṇa answered, “Your Majesty, it is three leagues away.” King Pasenadi of Kosala said, “Dīgha Kārāyaṇa, prepare the chariot. I wish to go to the Buddha.” On receiving this instruction, Dīgha Kārāyaṇa prepared the chariot and then said, “Your Majesty, the chariot is ready and at Your Majesty’s disposal.” King Pasenadi of Kosala mounted the chariot, left the city, and went to the Sakyan town called Medaḷumpa.^362

At that time, outside the gate of Medaḷumpa, many monks were practicing walking meditation in the open. King Pasenadi of Kosala approached these monks and asked, “Venerable sirs, where is the World-honored One spending the day’s abiding?” The many monks answered: Great King, the World-honored One is now spending the day’s abiding in the Eastern Hall, whose windows are open and the door is closed. Go there, Great King, if you wish to see him. On arriving, stand outside, clear your throat, and knock on the door. On hearing it, the World-honored One will certainly open the door for you. King Pasenadi of Kosala descended from his chariot. As a duly anointed warrior king with command over people in a vast territory, he had five [royal] insignia: a sword, a parasol, a royal headdress, a flywhisk with bejeweled handle, and ornate sandals. He took all of them off and handed them to Dīgha Kārāyaṇa. Dīgha Kārāyaṇa thought, “His Majesty is certainly now going to enter alone. We must wait together here.” Then King Pasenadi of Kosala, surrounded by his retinue, walked to the Eastern Hall. On arriving there, he stood outside, cleared his throat, and knocked on the door. Having heard it, the World-honored One had the door opened and King Pasenadi of Kosala entered the hall. On reaching the Buddha, he paid homage with his head at [the Buddha’s] feet and announced his full name three times: “I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala. I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala.”^363 The World-honored One answered, “It is like this, Great King, you are King Pasenadi of Kosala; you are King Pasenadi of Kosala.” When King Pasenadi of Kosala had announced his full name three times and had paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, he stepped back and sat to one side. The World-honored One asked: Great King, what benefit is there in seeing me, such that you lower your- self by paying homage with your head at my feet, offering such formal veneration? King Pasenadi of Kosala answered: World-honored One, I have gained faith regarding the Buddha and the Dharma.^364 For this reason I have this thought, “The Tathāgata is free from

attachment and fully awakened; his Dharma is well taught; and the Sangha of the World-honored One’s disciples is progressing well.” World-honored One, when I sit with all seated [in court], I see mothers disputing with sons and sons disputing with mothers; fathers with sons, elder brothers with younger brothers, elder sisters with younger sisters, relatives disputing back and forth with one another. When quarreling and disputing, mothers speak harsh words to their sons, sons speak harsh words to their mothers; fathers to sons, elder brothers to younger brothers, elder sisters to younger sisters. Relatives speak harsh words to one another; how much more so to other persons! I see the World-honored One’s disciples, the sangha of monks who prac tice the holy life under the World-honored One. If there are monks who, because of some dispute that has arisen, abandon the precepts and leave the path [of monasticism], they do not speak ill of the Buddha, the Dharma, or the Sangha of monks.^365 Rather, they blame themselves: “I have acted badly; I am without virtue. Why is that? Because I was not able to practice the holy life under the World-honored One for my whole life.”^366 This is the faith I have gained regarding the Buddha and the Dharma. For this reason I have this thought, “The Tathāgata is free from attachment, fully awakened; his Dharma is well taught; and the Sangha of the World honored One’s disciples is progressing well.” Again, World-honored One, I see a certain renunciant or brahmin who for nine or ten months trains in some practice of the holy life, but then gives it up and returns to layman’s dress. He is again tainted by sensual pleasures; and being tainted by sensual pleasures, he is attached to sensual pleasures. Bound by sensual pleasures and arrogance, he accepts them and is involved with them. He does not see the danger in them, does not see the escape from them, but delights in engaging in sensual pleasures. World-honored One, I see the disciples of the World-honored One, the sangha of monks, practice the holy life for their whole life and that even in very large numbers. Nowhere else do I see a holy life so purely lived as in the tradition of the World-honored One. This is the faith I have gained regard ing the Buddha and the Dharma. For this reason I have this thought, “The Tathāgata is free from attachment, fully awakened; his Dharma is well taught; and the Sangha of the World-honored One’s disciples is progressing well.”

Again, World-honored One, I see some renunciants or brahmins who are emaciated and haggard, ugly in form and complexion, their bodies cov- ered with white pimples, so that people do not like to see them. It occurs to me, “Why are these venerable ones emaciated and haggard, ugly in form and complexion, their bodies covered with white pimples, so that people do not like to see them? These venerable ones certainly do not delight in practicing the holy life; or perhaps their bodies are afflicted; or perhaps it is because they are hiding some unwholesome deeds that they are emaciated and haggard, ugly in form and complexion, their bodies covered with white pimples, so that people do not like to see them.” So I approach and ask them, “Venerable sirs, why are you emaciated and haggard, ugly in form and complexion, your bodies covered with white pimples, so that people do not like to see you? Is it that you do not delight in practicing the holy life? Or are your bodies afflicted? Or is it because you are hiding some unwholesome deeds that you are emaciated and hag- gard, ugly in form and complexion, your bodies covered with white pimples, so that people do not like to see you?” They reply to me, “Great King, it is the white disease. Great King, it is the white disease.” World-honored One, I see the disciples of the World-honored One, the sangha of monks. They dwell happily and look well, with bright and shining complexions, clean bodies, naturally and without concern, sustained by food [given] by the wives of others, [aloof] like deer, practicing the holy life for their whole life. Having seen them, I think, “These venerable ones dwell happily and look well, with bright and shining complexions, clean bodies, naturally and without concern, sustained by food [given] by the wives of others, [aloof] like deer, practicing the holy life for their whole life. These venerable ones have attained detachment from sensual pleasures, a higher state of mind, a happy abiding in the present life, attaining it with ease, without difficulty. This is why these venerable ones dwell happily and look well, with bright and shining complexions, clean bodies, naturally and without concern, sustained by food [given] by the wives of others, [aloof] like deer, practicing the holy life for their whole life.” If those engaging in sensual pleasures were dwelling happily and look- ing well, I too should be dwelling happily and looking well. Why is that? I obtain the five strands of sensual pleasure with ease, without difficulty.

[However], these venerable ones have attained detachment from sensual pleasures, a higher state of mind, a happy abiding in the present life, attaining it with ease, without difficulty. Consequently these venerable ones dwell happily and look well, with bright and shining complexions, clean bodies, naturally and without concern, sustained by the food [given] by the wives of others, [aloof] like deer, practicing the holy life for their whole life. This is the faith I have gained regarding the Buddha and the Dharma. For this reason I have this thought, “The Tathāgata is free from attachment, fully awakened; his Dharma is well taught; and the Sangha of the World- honored One’s disciples is progressing well.” Again, World-honored One, I see some renunciants or brahmins who are clever and wise, and proclaim themselves clever and wise.^367 Learned and opinionated, they know the various discourses by heart, and with their clear understanding they vigorously defeat their opponents in debate. The reputation of their good qualities has spread widely and nowhere in the world has their fame not become known. Wherever they go, they demolish the views of others and establish their own doctrine. They say, “Let us go to the renunciant Gotama and ask him about this and that matter. If he can answer, we will refute him; if he cannot answer, he has already been refuted and we will abandon him and leave.” They hear that the World-honored One has traveled to some village or town. They approach the Buddha [there], yet they do not dare to question the World-honored One on any matter, much less try to refute him. This is the faith I have gained regarding the Buddha and the Dharma. For this reason I have this thought, “The Tathāgata is free from attachment, fully awakened; his Dharma is well taught; and the Sangha of the World- honored One’s disciples is progressing well.” Again, World-honored One, I see some renunciants or brahmins who are clever and wise, and proclaim themselves clever and wise.

They say, “Let us go to the renunciant Gotama, and ask him about this and that matter. If he

can answer, we will refute him; if he cannot answer, he has already been refuted and we will abandon him and leave.” They hear that the World-honored One has traveled to some village or town. They approach the Buddha [there]. They ask the World-honored One about some matter, and the World-honored One replies. Having heard his reply they are delighted by it, pay homage with their heads at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulate him three times, and leave. This is the faith I have gained regarding the Buddha and the Dharma. For this reason I have this thought, “The Tathāgata is free from attachment, fully awakened; his Dharma is well taught; and the Sangha of the World- honored One’s disciples is progressing well.” Again, World-honored One, I see some renunciants or brahmins who are clever and wise, and proclaim themselves clever and wise.

They ask the World-honored One about some matter, and the World-honored One replies. On hearing his reply, they are so delighted by it that they take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha of monks. The World-honored One accepts them as lay followers until the end of life, as having gone to him for refuge for their whole life. This is the faith I have gained regarding the Buddha and the Dharma. For this reason I have this thought, “The Tathāgata is free from attachment, fully awakened; his Dharma is well taught; and the Sangha of the World- honored One’s disciples is progressing well.” Again, World-honored One, I see some renunciants or brahmins who are clever and wise, and proclaim themselves clever and wise.

They ask the World-honored One about some matter and the World-honored One replies. On hearing his reply they are so delighted by it that they ask the World-honored One to let them go forth, train, receive full ordination, and become monks. The Buddha then accepts them. They receive full ordination and become monks. Then those venerable ones, having gone forth to train in the path, having received full ordination and become monks, live alone in a secluded place, and practice diligently with a mind free of negligence. Having lived alone in a secluded place and practiced diligently with a mind free of negligence, they attain fully the summit of the holy life, for the sake of which a clans man shaves off hair and beard, dons the yellow robe, leaves home out of faith, and goes forth to practice the path. In that very life they personally attain understanding and awakening and dwell having personally realized it. They know as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing of existence.” Thus those monks, having understood the Dharma... up to... become arahants. Having become arahants, they think: “Venerable ones, formerly we were almost done for, almost lost. Why is that? Formerly although we were not renunciants, we claimed to be renunciants; although not living the holy life, we claimed to be living the holy life; although not arahants, we claimed to be arahants. Now we [truly] are renunciants, [truly] are living the holy life, and [truly] have become arahants.” This is the faith I have gained regarding the Buddha and the Dharma. For this reason I have this thought, “The Tathāgata is free from attachment, fully awakened; his Dharma is well taught; and the Sangha of the World honored One’s disciples is progressing well.”

Again, World-honored One, within my own country I can order innocent persons to be executed and I can order guilty persons to be executed. Yet, when I sit with all seated [in court], I am not, simply for that reason, able to get [my way] by speaking like this: “Ministers, stop that now! No one asked you about that matter. They asked me about that matter. You ministers cannot decide this matter. Only I can decide this matter.” And then, in the midst of that, they start arguing about some other matter, without waiting until the current discussion has been concluded. I have often seen the World-honored One teaching the Dharma sur- rounded by a great assembly. If one of them nods off and starts snoring,^368 someone will tell that person, “Do not nod off and snore! Do you not need to listen to the World-honored One teaching the Dharma, which is like ambrosia?” Having heard this, that person falls silent. [On such occasions] I think, “How wonderful, how extraordinary is the Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened, trainer of those to be tamed! Why is that? Without blade and cudgel everybody naturally behaves according to the Dharma, in peace and happiness.” This is the faith I have gained regarding the Buddha and the Dharma. For this reason I have this thought, “The Tathāgata is free from attachment, fully awakened; his Dharma is well taught; and the Sangha of the World- honored One’s disciples is progressing well.” Again, World-honored One, my two ministers, Isidatta and Purāṇa, owe their wealth, their common reputation, and their livelihood to me, but I cannot get my two ministers, Isidatta and Purāṇa, to respect me, ven- erate me, honor me, and support me in the way that they respect, venerate, honor, and support the World-honored One. This is the faith I have gained regarding the Buddha and the Dharma. For this reason I have this thought, “The Tathāgata is free from attachment, fully awakened; his Dharma is well taught; and the Sangha of the World- honored One’s disciples is progressing well.” Again, World-honored One, once long ago, while on a military exercise,^369 I spent the night in a small room with my two ministers, Isidatta and Purāṇa. I wanted to test them, by seeing which direction their heads would be facing as they slept: toward me or toward the World-honored One. As it happened, during the beginning of the night my two ministers, Isidatta and Purāṇa, sat

cross-legged in silent meditation.^370 Then, in the middle of the night, because they had heard that the World-honored One was staying in a certain region, they [lay down] with their heads toward him and their feet toward me. Seeing that, I thought, “These two ministers, Isidatta and Purāṇa, consider not just what is superior in the present situation. Consequently, the way they respect me, venerate me, honor me, and support me is not equal to the way they respect, venerate, honor, and support the World-honored One.” This is the faith I have gained regarding the Buddha and the Dharma. For this reason I have this thought, “The Tathāgata is free from attachment, fully awakened; his Dharma is well taught; and the Sangha of the World- honored One’s disciples is progressing well.” Again, World-honored One, I am the king of the country [but] the World-honored One is the king of the Dharma.^371 I am of the warrior [caste] and the World-honored One is also of the warrior [caste]; I am a Kosalan and the World-honored One also is a Kosalan; I am eighty years of age and the World-honored One is also eighty. For this reason, World- honored One, I am able for my whole life to respect and venerate the World-honored One, to make offerings to him and support him. But now, World-honored One, I have many matters to attend to. Wishing to return, I ask permission to leave. The World-honored One said, “Great king, you yourself know the proper time.” Then, having heard what the Buddha said, King Pasenadi of Kosala received and remembered it well, rose from his seat, paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and left. At that time the venerable Ānanda was standing behind the World-honored One holding a flywhisk and attending on the Buddha. Then the World-honored One turned to him and said, “Ānanda, let all the monks who are now staying in the forest around Medaḷumpa gather in the assembly hall.”^372 Then, having received this instruction, the venerable Ānanda got the monks who were staying in the forest around Medaḷumpa to gather in the assembly hall. He returned to the Buddha and said:

World-honored One, all the monks that are staying in the forest around Medaḷumpa have now gathered. May the World-honored One know the right time.

Then the World-honored One went with the venerable Ānanda to the assembly hall, sat down on a seat arranged before the company of monks, and said:

Monks, today King Pasenadi of Kosala has spoken before me this “Dis- course on the Adornments of the Dharma” and [then] risen from his seat, paid homage with his head at my feet, circumambulated me three times and left. Monks, you should memorize this “Discourse on the Adornments of the Dharma,” recite it well, and rehearse it well. Why is that? Monks, this “Discourse on the Adornments of the Dharma” is [spoken] according to the right meaning, according to Dharma, and is a basis for the holy life. It leads to wisdom, leads to awakening, and leads to nirvana. Persons of good family who leave home out of faith and go forth to practice the path should memorize this “Discourse on the Adornments of the Dharma,” recite it, and rehearse it. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha had said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
