### 29. The Discourse by Mahā Koṭṭhita

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. At that time, in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta rose from sitting in meditation and approached Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita. Having exchanged courteous greetings, he sat down to one side.

Venerable Sāriputta said to Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita: “I would like to ask you some questions. Would you care to hear them?” Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita replied: “Venerable Sāriputta, ask whatever you wish. Having heard [your questions], I will [carefully] consider them.” Venerable Sāriputta then asked: Venerable friend Mahā Koṭṭhita, is there a condition owing to which a monk accomplishes view, acquires right view and, having attained unwavering pure [confidence] in the Dharma, arrives at the true Dharma? [Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita] replied: There is, Venerable Sāriputta. It is this: a monk knows the unwholesome and knows the roots of the unwholesome. What is knowledge of the unwholesome? It is this: evil bodily actions are unwholesome, evil verbal actions and evil mental actions are unwholesome. This is reckoned to be knowledge of the unwholesome. What is knowledge of the roots of the unwholesome? It is this: greed is a root of the unwholesome; hatred and ignorance are roots of the unwholesome. This is reckoned to be knowledge of the roots of the unwholesome. Venerable Sāriputta, if there is a monk who, in this manner, knows the unwholesome and the roots of the unwholesome, then he is said to be a monk who has accomplished view, acquired right view, and, having attained unwavering pure [con fidence] in the Dharma, has arrived at the true Dharma. On hearing this, Venerable Sāriputta spoke in praise: “Very good! Very good, friend Mahā Koṭṭhita!” Having done so, Venerable Sāriputta was delighted and remembered it well. Venerable Sāriputta then asked further: Friend Mahā Koṭṭhita, is there another condition owing to which a monk accomplishes view, acquires right view, and, having attained unwavering pure [confidence] in the Dharma, arrives at the true Dharma? [Mahā Koṭṭhita] replied: There is, Venerable Sāriputta. It is this: a monk knows the wholesome and knows the roots of the wholesome.

What is knowledge of the wholesome? It is this: good bodily actions are wholesome, good verbal actions and good mental actions are wholesome. This is reckoned to be knowledge of the wholesome. What is knowledge of the roots of the wholesome? It is this: absence of lust is a root of the wholesome; absence of aversion and absence of ignorance are roots of the wholesome. Venerable Sāriputta, if there is a monk who, in this manner, knows the wholesome and knows their roots, then he is said to be a monk who has accomplished view, acquired right view, and, having attained unwa- vering pure [confidence] in the Dharma, has arrived at the true Dharma. On hearing this, Venerable Sāriputta spoke in praise: “Very good! Very good, friend Mahā Koṭṭhita!” Having done so, Venerable Sāriputta was delighted and remembered it well. Venerable Sāriputta then asked: Friend Mahā Koṭṭhita, is there yet another condition owing to which a monk accomplishes view, acquires right view, and, having attained unwavering pure [confidence] in the Dharma, arrives at the true Dharma? [Mahā Koṭṭhita] replied: There is, Venerable Sāriputta. It is this: a monk knows nutriment as it really is, knows the arising of nutriment, knows the cessation of nutri- ment, and knows the path [leading to] the cessation of nutriment as it really is. What is knowledge of nutriment as it really is? It is this: there are four nutriments: the first nutriment is physical food, coarse or fine; the second nutriment is contact; the third nutriment is intention; and the fourth nutriment is consciousness. This is reckoned to be knowledge of nutriment as it really is. What is knowledge of the arising of nutriment as it really is? It is this: in dependence on craving, nutriment comes to be. This is reckoned to be knowledge of the arising of nutriment as it really is. What is knowledge of the cessation of nutriment as it really is? It is this: with the cessation of craving, nutriment also ceases. This is reckoned to be knowledge of the cessation of nutriment as it really is.

What is knowledge of the path [leading to] the cessation of nutri- ment as it really is? It is this: the noble eightfold path, from right view to right concentration—eight [factors].

Venerable Sāriputta, if there is a monk who, in this manner, knows nutriment as it really is, knows the arising of nutriment, knows the ces- sation of nutriment, and knows the path [leading to] the cessation of nutriment as it really is, then he is said to be a monk who has accom- plished view, acquired right view and, having attained unwavering pure [confidence] in the Dharma, has arrived at the true Dharma.

This is reckoned to be knowledge of the cessation of formations as it really is. What is knowledge of the path [leading to] the cessation of for- mations as it really is? It is this: the noble eightfold path, from right view to right concentration—eight [factors]. This is reckoned to be knowledge of the path [leading to] the cessation of formations as it really is. Venerable Sāriputta, if there is a monk who, in this manner, knows formations as they really are, knows the arising of formations, knows the cessation of formations, and knows the path [leading to] the ces- sation of formations as it really is, then he is said to be a monk who has accomplished view, acquired right view, and, having attained unwa- vering pure [confidence] in the Dharma, has arrived at the true Dharma. On hearing this, Venerable Sāriputta spoke in praise: “Very good! Very good, friend Mahā Koṭṭhita!” Having done so, Venerable Sāriputta was delighted and remembered it well. Venerable Sāriputta then asked further: “Friend Mahā Koṭṭhita, when a monk has caused ignorance to cease and knowledge to arise, what further does he need to do?” Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita replied: “Venerable Sāriputta, when a monk has caused ignorance to cease and knowledge to arise, there is nothing further that he needs to do.” On hearing this, Venerable Sāriputta spoke in praise: “Very good! Very good, friend Mahā Koṭṭhita!” Having discussed the meaning [of the Dharma] in this manner, those two venerable ones were both delighted and [would] remember [this exchange] well; they rose from their seats and departed.
