### 36. The Discourse on Earthquakes

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying in the Vajjian country in a town named Bhūmi. At that time, there was a violent earthquake. As the earth was quaking violently, a gale began blowing in all four directions, mete- ors appeared in all four directions, and all the houses and walls collapsed and were destroyed utterly. Then Venerable Ānanda saw that there was a violent earthquake, and that as the earth was quaking violently, a gale began blowing in all four direc- tions, meteors appeared in all four directions, and all the houses and walls collapsed and were destroyed utterly. Seeing this, Venerable Ānanda was

terrified and his body hairs stood on end. He then approached the Buddha and, after paying respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet, stood to one side, and said: World-honored One, just now the earth was quaking violently, and as the earth was quaking violently, a gale began blowing in all four direc tions, meteors appeared in all four directions, and all the houses and walls collapsed and were destroyed utterly. Then the World-honored One spoke to Venerable Ānanda, saying: Indeed, Ānanda. Just now the earth was quaking violently. Indeed, Ānanda. As the earth was quaking violently, a gale began blowing in all four directions, meteors appeared in all four directions, and all the houses and walls collapsed and were destroyed utterly. Then Venerable Ānanda asked: World-honored One, how many causes are there due to which the earth quakes violently, and as the earth quakes violently a gale begins blowing in all four directions, meteors appear in all four directions, and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly? The World-honored One replied: Ānanda, there are three causes due to which the earth quakes violently, and as the earth quakes violently a gale begins blowing in all four direc tions, meteors appear in all four directions, and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly. What are the three? Ānanda, this earth rests upon water; the water rests upon wind; and the wind depends upon space. Ānanda, there comes a time when a great wind begins blowing in the sky. When the wind begins blowing, the water becomes disturbed; and when the water is disturbed, the earth quakes. This is the first cause due to which the earth quakes violently, and as the earth quakes violently, a gale begins blowing in all four directions, meteors appear in all four directions, and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly.

Again, Ānanda, a monk who possesses great supernormal power, great and mighty virtue, great merit, great and mighty power, is able, with the supernormal power of mastery over the mind, to develop per- ception of earth as minute and perception of water as infinite. On account of this, this earth behaves according to his wish, accord- ing to his will, being disturbed again and again, quaking again and again. Not only a monk, a god too, who has self-mastery, one who pos- sesses great supernormal power, great and mighty virtue, great merit, great and mighty power, is able to develop perception of earth as minute and perception of water as infinite with his supernormal power of mas- tery over the mind. On account of this, this earth behaves according to his wish, accord- ing to his will, being disturbed again and again, quaking again and again. This is the second cause due to which the earth quakes violently, and as the earth quakes violently, a gale begins blowing in all four directions, meteors appear in all four directions, and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly. Again, Ānanda, if a Tathāgata will be attaining final nirvana soon, within three months, for this reason the earth quakes violently, and as the earth quakes violently, a gale begins blowing in all four directions, meteors appear in all four directions, and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly. This is the third cause due to which the earth quakes violently, and as the earth quakes violently, a gale begins blowing in all four directions, meteors appear in all four directions, and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly. Hearing this, Venerable Ānanda began to weep and shed tears. Placing his palms together [in respect] toward the Buddha, he said:

World-honored One, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that the Tathāgata, who is free from attachment, fully awakened, has accom plished [all] meritorious deeds and acquired such extraordinary qualities. Why is that? [Because] the Tathāgata will enter final nirvana soon, within three months. [Therefore] at this time [now], the earth quakes

violently, and as the earth quakes violently, a gale begins to blow in all four directions, meteors appear in all four directions, and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly. Then the World-honored One said to Venerable Ānanda: Indeed, Ānanda, indeed. It is most wonderful, most remarkable that the Tathāgata, who is free from attachment, fully awakened, has accomplished [all] meritorious deeds and acquired such extraordinary qualities. Why is that? [Because] the Tathāgata will enter final nirvana soon, within three months. [Therefore] at this time [now], the earth quakes violently, and as the earth quakes violently, a gale begins to blow in all four directions, meteors appear in all four directions, and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly. Furthermore, Ānanda, I have approached countless hundreds and thousands of khattiya assemblies, sat and discussed with them, and made them feel at ease. Having sat down with them, I take on an appear ance that resembles their appearance, a voice that sounds like their voices, and comportment and etiquette that resemble their comportment and etiquette. If they ask questions, I respond to those questions. Moreover, I teach them the Dharma, exhorting, encouraging, and delighting them. Having taught them the Dharma using countless skillful means, having exhorted, encouraged, and delighted them, I then disappear from that place. After I have disappeared, they do not know who I was, whether I was human or not human. Similarly, Ānanda, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that the Tathāgata, who is free from attachment, fully awakened, has accom plished [all] meritorious deeds and acquired such extraordinary qualities, has done the same with assemblies of brahmins... assemblies of householders... assemblies of renunciants. [Furthermore,] Ānanda, I have approached countless hundreds and thousands of assemblies of the four celestial kings, sat and discussed with them, and made them feel at ease. Having sat down with them, I take on an appearance that resembles their appearance, a voice that sounds like their voices, and comportment

and etiquette that resemble their comportment and etiquette. If they ask questions, I respond to those questions. Moreover, I teach them the Dharma, exhorting, encouraging, and delighting them. Having taught them the Dharma using countless skillful means, having exhorted, encouraged, and delighted them, I then disappear from that place. After I have disappeared, they do not know who I was, whether I was a god or not a god. Similarly, Ānanda, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that the Tathāgata, who is free from attachment, fully awakened, has accom- plished [all] meritorious deeds and acquired such extraordinary qualities, has done the same with the thirty-three gods... the Yama gods... the Tusita gods... the gods that delight in creation... the gods that delight in others’ creation... the gods that are the retinue of Brahmā... the gods that are the attendants and ministers of Brahmā... the gods of limited radiance... the gods of immeasurable radiance... the gods of streaming radiance... the gods of limited glory... the gods of immeasurable glory... the gods of refulgent glory... the unclouded gods... the gods of abundant merit... the gods of great reward... the gods of non-vexation... the gods of non-affliction... the gods of good sight... the gods of good appearance. [Again,] Ānanda, I have approached countless hundreds of thou- sands of assemblies of the gods of ultimate form, sat and discussed with them, and made them feel at ease. Having sat down with them, I take on an appearance that resembles their appearance, a voice that sounds like their voices, and comportment and etiquette that resemble their comportment and etiquette. If they ask questions, I respond to those questions. Moreover, I teach them the Dharma, exhorting, encouraging, and delighting them. Having taught them the Dharma using countless skillful means, having exhorted, encouraged, and delighted them, I then disappear from that place. After I have disappeared, they do not know who I was, whether I was a god or not a god. In this way, Ānanda, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that the Tathāgata, who is free from attachment, fully awakened, has accomplished [all] meritorious deeds and acquired such extraordinary qualities.

This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, Ven- erable Ānanda and the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
