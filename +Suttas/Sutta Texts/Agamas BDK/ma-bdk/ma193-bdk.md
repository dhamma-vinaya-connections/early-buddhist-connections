### 193. The Discourse on Moliya Phagguṇa

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time Moliya Phagguṇa was frequently associating with the nuns. If people said something about the nuns in the presence of the monk Moliya Phag- guṇa, then on hearing it he would become angry and displeased, even going so far as to quarrel with them. If people said something about the monk Moliya Phagguṇa in the presence of the nuns, then on hearing it the nuns would become angry and displeased, even going so far as to quarrel with them. Many monks heard of this and approached the Buddha. Having paid hom- age with their heads at the Buddha’s feet, they stepped back, sat to one side, and said:

World-honored One, Moliya Phagguṇa frequently associates with the nuns. If people say something about the nuns in the presence of the monk Moliya Phagguṇa, then on hearing it, he becomes angry and displeased, even going so far as to quarrel with them. If people say something about the monk Moliya Phagguṇa in the presence of the nuns, then on hearing it, the nuns become angry and displeased, even going so far as to quarrel with them. On hearing this, the World-honored One said to one monk, “Approach the monk Moliya Phagguṇa and tell him, ‘The World-honored One summons you.’” On hearing this, the monk [said], “Yes, World-honored One,” rose from his seat, paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and left. He approached the monk Moliya Phagguṇa and told him, “The World-honored One summons you.” On hearing this, the monk Moliya Phagguṇa approached the Buddha, paid homage to the Buddha, stepped back, and sat to one side. The World-honored One said: Phagguṇa, is it true that you frequently associate with the nuns; that if people say something about the nuns in your presence, then on hearing it you become angry and displeased, even going so far as to quarrel with them; and that if people say something about you in the presence of the nuns, then

on hearing it the nuns become angry and displeased, even going so far as to quarrel with them? Phagguṇa, is it true that it is like this with you?” [Moliya] Phagguṇa replied, “It is true, World-honored One.” The World-honored One asked further, “Phagguṇa, have you not, out of faith, given up the household life and become homeless to train in the path?” Phagguṇa replied, “I have, World-honored One.” The World-honored One said: Phagguṇa, since you have, out of faith, given up the household life and become homeless to train in the path, you should train [as follows]. If you have desires and thoughts based on the household life, abandon them! If you have desires and thoughts based on dispassion, practice them, cultivate them, make much of them! Phagguṇa, you should train in this way.^78 Then the World-honored One asked the monks, “Have you not, out of faith, given up the household life and become homeless to train in the path?” The monks replied, “We have, World-honored One.” The World-honored One said further to the monks: Since you have, out of faith, given up the household life and become homeless to train in the path, you should train [as follows]. If you have desires and thoughts based on the household life, abandon them! If you have desires and thoughts based on dispassion, practice them, cultivate them, make much of them! You should train in this way. A long time ago I told the monks, “Whether a monk is of much renown or of little renown, he [should] always and without exception train in eating just one meal [each day].^79 Having trained in eating just one meal [a day], he will be without preoccupation, without pursuit, and without sickness and pain. His body will be light, strong, and healthy. He will be happy and at ease.” Those monks, both those of much renown and those of little renown, all without exception trained in eating just one meal [a day]. Having trained in eating just one meal [a day], they were without preoccupation, without pursuit, and without sickness and pain. Their bodies were light, strong, and healthy. They were happy and at ease. Those monks pleased my mind and I did not often [need to] reprimand them. Based on this, the monks

developed mindfulness and practiced the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma. It is just like a horse-drawn chariot. The charioteer mounts it and, hold- ing the bridle in his left hand and the whip in his right hand, proceeds at will along roads in any of the eight directions. In the same way the monks pleased my mind and I did not often [need to] reprimand them. Based on this, the monks developed mindfulness and practiced the Dharma in accor- dance with the Dharma. It is just like a grove of _sāla_ trees on good ground, with a forester who is intelligent, wise, and not neglectful. At appropriate times he attends to the roots of the _sāla_ trees, repeatedly applying manure with a hoe, irrigating it with water, leveling the high parts, and filling in the hollows. If weeds grow up alongside [a tree], he pulls them out and discards them. If [saplings] grow that are twisted and crooked, not straight, he uproots them and puts them aside. If branches grow crosswise or crookedly, he removes them. If new [saplings] that are straight and attractive grow up close by, he attends to them at appropriate times, repeatedly applying manure with a hoe and irrigating it with water. In this way that _sāla_ tree grove on good ground comes to flourish. In the same way the monks pleased my mind and I did not often [need to] reprimand them.^80 I do not say that [a monk] is well-spoken and respectful if he behaves thus just for the sake of robes, bowl, food and drink, bed, and medicines, the various requisites of life.^81 Why is that? If a monk does not receive these [requisites], he may not be well-spoken and respectful; he might qualify as being by nature not well-spoken and respectful. If [however] there is a monk who for the sake of seclusion, being based in seclusion and established in seclusion, is well-spoken and respectful and qualifies as being by nature well-spoken and respectful, then I say that he is well-spoken and respectful. Why is that? Suppose there is a [monk] who is well-disciplined and well-behaved, namely because others do not utter bad speech. If others do not utter bad speech, he does not become angry or displeased. He does not become stuck in a tangle of worry, nor become filled with hatred and dislike. He does not display any bad quality. Seeing this, the [other] monks think,

“This venerable one is patient, humble, and tolerant. He is well-disciplined, well-settled, and at peace.” If [however], others utter bad speech, then he becomes angry and dis pleased. He becomes stuck in a tangle of worry and filled with hatred and dislike. He displays bad qualities. Seeing this, the [other] monks think, “This venerable one is bad-natured, impatient, corrupt, and coarse. He is not settled, not disciplined, and not at peace.” Why is that? Monks, long ago there was a housewife named Vedehikā who was very rich. She had much wealth, livestock, and property beyond measure, feuda tories, manors, and abundant granaries, as well as possessing many kinds of requisites of life. At that time the housewife Vedehikā’s reputation had spread widely in all directions to this effect: “The housewife Vedehikā is patient, tolerant, and gentle. She is well-disciplined, well-settled, and at peace.” At that time the housewife Vedehikā had as her principal attendant a maidservant named Kālī, who was nimble, well-spoken, and good at her work, whether small or great. That maidservant Kālī thought, “The rep utation of my mistress, the housewife Vedehikā, has spread widely in all directions to this effect: ‘The housewife Vedehikā is patient, tolerant, and gentle. She is well-disciplined, well-settled, and at peace.’ Let me now test my mistress, the housewife Vedehikā: does she actually become angry or does she actually not become angry?” Then the maidservant Kālī remained lying [in bed] rather than getting up early. The lady shouted at her, “Kālī! Why did you not get up early?” Hearing this, the maidservant Kālī thought, “My mistress, the housewife Vedehikā, actually does become angry. It is not true that she does not become angry. It is only because I am good at doing the housework, good at managing [the house], and good at maintaining it that the reputation of my mistress, the housewife Vedehikā, has spread widely in all directions to this effect: ‘The housewife Vedehikā is patient, tolerant, and gentle. She is well-disciplined, well-settled, and at peace.’ Let me now further test my mistress, the housewife Vedehikā: does she actually become angry or does she actually not become angry?” Then the maidservant Kālī [again] remained lying [in bed], not getting up until extremely late. The lady shouted at her, “Kālī, why didn’t you get up until extremely late?” Hearing this, the maidservant Kālī thought,

“My mistress, the housewife Vedehikā, actually does become angry. It is not true that she does not become angry. It is only because I am good at doing the housework, good at managing [the house], and good at main- taining it that the reputation of my mistress, the housewife Vedehikā, has spread widely in all directions to this effect: ‘The housewife Vedehikā is patient, tolerant, and gentle. She is well-disciplined, well-settled, and at peace.’ Let me now further test my mistress, the housewife Vedehikā: does she actually become angry or does she actually not become angry?” Then the maidservant Kālī remained lying [in bed], not getting up until the afternoon. The lady shouted at her: “Kālī, why did you get up only in the afternoon? I do not do that myself and I have not told you to do it. This maidservant Kālī does not follow my instructions. This maidservant Kālī is disrespectful toward me.” Then she became very angry and filled with hatred. Three veins stood out on her forehead and her face became contorted. She personally went and shut the doors, took a big cane in her hand, and hit [Kālī] on the head. The head was injured and began bleeding. Then the maidservant Kālī, with her head injured and bleeding, went out and told the neighbors, accusing her [mistress] in various ways and telling many people about it, “Sirs! Do you see in this the behavior of a practitioner of patience, tolerance, and gentleness, of one who is well- disciplined, well-settled, and at peace? She has scolded me, saying, ‘Kālī, why did you get up only in the afternoon? I do not do that myself and I have not told you to do it. This maidservant Kālī does not follow my instructions. This maidservant Kālī is disrespectful toward me.’ Then she became very angry and filled with hatred. Three veins stood out on her forehead and her face became contorted. She personally came and shut the doors, took a big cane in her hand, and hit me on the head. My head was injured and began bleeding.” Then a very bad report about the housewife Vedehikā spread in all directions to this effect: “The housewife Vedehikā is evil by nature. She is impatient, corrupt, and coarse. She is not settled, not disciplined, and not at peace.” In the same way, suppose there is a [monk] who is well-disciplined and well-behaved. He is reckoned as such because no other person is there

uttering bad speech. If no other person is uttering bad speech, he does not become angry or displeased. He does not become stuck in a tangle of worry, nor become filled with hatred and dislike. He does not display any bad quality. Seeing this, the [other] monks think, “This venerable one is patient, humble, mild, and tolerant. He is well-disciplined, well-settled, and at peace.” If [however] another person does utter bad speech, then [that monk] becomes angry and displeased. He becomes stuck in a tangle of worry and filled with hatred and dislike. He displays bad qualities. Seeing this, the [other] monks think, “This venerable one is bad-natured, impatient, corrupt, and coarse. He is not settled, not disciplined, and not at peace.” Again, there are five ways of speaking^82 Another person’s speech may be timely or untimely, truthful or untruthful, gentle or harsh, kindly or angry, meaningful or trivial. When someone speaks in any of these five ways, if your mind changes or your mouth says something bad, then I say that because of that you are definitely in decline. You should train so that when someone speaks in any of these five ways, your mind will not change, your mouth will be free of bad speech, and based on that you generate a mental attitude of loving-kindness and compassion toward people who are hostile. With your mind imbued with loving-kindness, dwell pervading one direction [with it], likewise the second, the third, and the fourth directions, and also the four intermediate directions and above and below, all around, everywhere. With your mind imbued with loving-kindness, free from fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention, dwell pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well cultivated. In the same way, with your mind imbued with compassion... with empathic joy... with equanimity, free from fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention, dwell pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well-cultivated. You should train in this way.^83 It is just as if a person were to come along holding a big shovel and were to say, “I am able to make this great earth become non-earth.” Then he digs and digs [the earth] in various places, pollutes it by spitting and urinating on it, and curses it, saying, “Let this great earth become non-earth!” What

do you think? Would that person be able, by these means, to make this great earth become non-earth?

The monks replied:

No, World-honored One. Why is that? This great earth is very deep and extremely wide, beyond measure. Therefore that person is not able, by these means, to make this great earth become non-earth. World-honored One, that man will just tire himself in vain.

[The Buddha said:]

In the same way, there are these five ways of speaking. Another person’s speech may be timely or untimely, truthful or untruthful, gentle or harsh, kindly or angry, meaningful or trivial. When someone speaks in any of these five ways, if your mind changes or your mouth utters bad speech, then I say that because of that you are definitely in decline. You should train so that, when someone speaks in any of these five ways, your mind will not change, your mouth will be free of bad speech, and based on that you generate a mental attitude of loving-kindness and compassion toward people who speak [in that way]. Practice with a mental attitude resem- bling the earth, free from fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention. Dwell pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well-cultivated. You should train in this way. It is just as if a person holding a large grass torch were to say, “With this grass torch I will heat the water of the Ganges [River] and make it boil.” What do you think, will that person be able, by this means, to heat the water of the Ganges and make it boil?^84

The monks replied:

No, World-honored One. Why is that? World-honored One, the water of the Ganges is very deep and extremely wide, beyond measuring. Therefore, that person would not be able, by this means, to heat the water of the Ganges and make it boil. World-honored One, that man will just tire himself in vain.

[The Buddha said:]

In the same way, there are these five ways of speaking. Another person’s speech may be timely or untimely, truthful or untruthful, gentle or harsh, kindly or angry, meaningful or trivial. When someone speaks in any of these five ways, if your mind changes or your mouth utters bad speech, then I say that because of that you are definitely in decline. You should train so that, when someone speaks in any of these five ways, your mind will not change, your mouth will be free of bad speech, and based on that you generate a mental attitude of loving-kindness and compassion toward people who speak [in that way]. Practice with a mental attitude resembling the water of the Ganges, free from fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention. Dwell pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well-cultivated. You should train in this way. It is just as if a painter or a painter’s apprentice were to come along carrying various colors and say, “I will trace forms and images in empty space and adorn them with these colored paints.” What do you think? Will that painter or that painter’s apprentice be able, by this means, to trace forms and images in empty space and adorn them with colored paints? The monks replied: No, World-honored One. Why is that? World-honored One, empty space is nonmaterial, invisible, and without resistance. Therefore that painter or that painter’s apprentice is not able, by this means, to trace forms and images in empty space and adorn them with colored paints. World-honored One, that painter or that painter’s apprentice will just tire himself in vain. [The Buddha said:] In the same way, there are these five ways of speaking. Another person’s speech may be timely or untimely, truthful or untruthful, gentle or harsh, kindly or angry, meaningful or trivial. When someone speaks in any of these five ways, if your mind changes or your mouth utters bad speech, then I say that because of that you are definitely in decline. You should train so that, when someone speaks in any of these five ways, your mind will not change, your mouth will be free of bad speech, and based on that you generate a mental attitude of loving-kindness and

compassion toward people who speak [in this way]. Practice with a mental attitude resembling empty space, free from fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention. Dwell pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well-cultivated. You should train in this way. It is just like a cat-skin bag that is pliant and has been cured so as to become very soft and to make no crackling sound, to be devoid of any crackling sound. Suppose there is a person who punches it with his fists, throws stones at it, beats it with a stick, cuts it with a knife, or flings it on to the ground. What do you think? That cat-skin bag which is pliant and has been cured so as to become very soft and to make no crackling sound, to be devoid of any crackling sound—will it again make a crackling sound?

The monks replied:

No, World-honored One. Why is that? World-honored One, that cat-skin bag is pliant and has been cured so as to become very soft and to make no crackling sound, to be devoid of any crackling sound. Therefore, it will no longer make a crackling sound.

[The Buddha said:]

In the same way, monks, if other people punch you, stone you, beat you with sticks, or cut you with knives; and if, while you are being punched, stoned, beaten with sticks, or cut with knives, your mind changes or your mouth utters bad speech, then I say that because of that you are definitely in decline.^85 You should train so that if others punch you, stone you, beat you with sticks, or cut you with knives, your mind does not change, you will not utter bad speech, and based on that you should arouse a mental attitude of loving-kindness and compassion toward the people who beat you. Prac- tice with a mental attitude resembling a cat-skin bag, free from fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention. Dwell pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well- cultivated. You should train in this way. If thieves were to come along and cut you apart, section by section, with a sharp saw; and if while being cut apart, section by section, by those

thieves with a sharp saw, your mind were to change or you were to utter bad speech, then I say you would, for that reason, certainly be in decline. You should train so that if thieves were to come by and cut you apart, section by section, with a sharp saw, your mind would not change, you would not utter bad speech to those who were cutting you up and, based on that, you should generate a mental attitude of loving-kindness and compassion. With your mind imbued with loving-kindness, you should dwell [men tally] pervading one direction, likewise the second, the third, and the fourth directions, and also the four intermediate directions and above and below, all around, everywhere. With a mind imbued with loving-kindness, free from fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention, you should dwell pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well-cultivated. In the same way with a mind imbued with compassion... with empathic joy... with equanimity, free from fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention, you should dwell per vading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeas urable, and well-cultivated. You should train in this way.^86 Then the World-honored One praised the monks, saying: It is well, it is well, you should repeatedly recollect the simile of being cut up with a sharp saw as a teaching for renunciants. Having repeatedly rec ollected the simile of being cut up with a sharp saw as a teaching for renun ciants, would you ever encounter [the situation of] being unable to endure hearing others directing unpleasant and bad speech at you? The monks replied, “No, World-honored One.” The World-honored One again praised the monks, saying: It is well, it is well, you should repeatedly recollect the simile of being cut up with a sharp saw as a teaching for renunciants. Having repeatedly rec ollected the simile of being cut up with a sharp saw as a teaching for renun ciants, if you wander in the eastern region, you will certainly be at ease, free of affliction by the multitude of sufferings. If you wander in the southern region... the western region... the northern region, you will certainly be at ease, free of affliction by the multitude of sufferings.^87

It is well, it is well, you should repeatedly recollect the simile of being cut up with a sharp saw as a teaching for renunciants. If you repeatedly recollect the simile of being cut up with a sharp saw as a teaching for renunciants, then I do not say merely that you are established in wholesome states, let alone that you will regress. Rather [I say] that by day and by night you will increase in wholesome states and will not regress. It is well, it is well, you should repeatedly recollect the simile of being cut up with a sharp saw as a teaching for renunciants. Having repeatedly recollected the simile of being cut up with a sharp saw as a teaching for renunciants, you will certainly attain either of two fruits: you will attain final knowledge here and now or, if there is a remainder [of clinging], you will attain nonreturning. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
