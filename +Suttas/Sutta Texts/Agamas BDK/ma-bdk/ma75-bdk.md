### 75. The Discourse on the Path to Pure Imperturbability

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in Kuru country, in the Kuru town of Kammāssadhamma. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: Sensual pleasures are impermanent, unreal, false, of a false nature, being indeed illusory, deceptive, and delusive. Sensual pleasures now or in the future, material forms now or in the future—all of these are the domain of Māra;^46 they are indeed Māra’s bait, due to which countless evil and unwholesome states, [such as] covetousness and anger, arise in the mind, leading to quarrelling, [all of] which create an obstruction for a noble dis- ciple in training. A learned noble disciple contemplates, “The World-honored One has taught that sensual pleasures are impermanent, unreal, false, of a false nature, being indeed illusory, deceptive, and delusive. “Sensual pleasures now or in the future, material forms now or in the future—all of these are the domain of Māra; they are indeed Māra’s bait, since because of them countless evil and unwholesome states, [such as] covetousness and anger, arise in the mind, leading to quarrelling, [all of] which create obstructions for a noble disciple in training.” He reflects thus, “Let me attain an expansive state of mind and dwell in it, overcoming worldliness [by] taking control of my mind. If I attain an expansive state of mind and dwell in it, overcoming worldliness [by] taking control of my mind, then in this way countless evil and unwholesome states, [such as] covetousness and anger, will not arise in the mind, leading to quar- relling, [all of] which create obstructions for a noble disciple in training.”

By means of this practice, by means of this training, by cultivating in this way, broadly and extensively, he attains purity of the mind in regard to that sphere. Having attained purity of the mind in regard to that sphere, such a monk will either gain entry into imperturbability right here, or else employ wisdom for the sake of liberation. At a later time, when the body breaks up and life ends, because of that former mental disposition he will certainly attain the imperturbable. This is reckoned the first explanation of the path to pure imperturbability. Again, a learned noble disciple contemplates thus, “If there are material forms, they are all [made up] of the four elements and what is derived from the four elements.^47 The four elements are of an impermanent nature, _dukkha,_ and [subject] to cessation.” Practicing in this way, training in this way, cultivating in this way, broadly and extensively, he attains purity of the mind in regard to that sphere. Having attained purity of the mind in regard to that sphere, such a monk will either gain entry into imperturbability right here, or else employ wisdom for the sake of liberation. At a later time, when the body breaks up and life ends, because of that former mental disposition he will certainly reach the imperturbable. This is reckoned the second explanation of the path to pure imperturbability. Again, a learned noble disciple contemplates thus, “Sensual pleasures now or in the future, forms now or in the future, sensual perceptions now or in the future, perceptions of form now or in the future—all of these per- ceptions are of an impermanent nature, _dukkha,_ and [subject] to cessation.” At that time he will certainly attain the perception of imperturbability. Practicing in this way, training in this way, cultivating in this way, broadly and extensively, he attains purity of the mind in regard to that sphere. Having attained purity of the mind in regard to that sphere, such a monk will either gain entry into imperturbability right here, or else employ wis- dom for the sake of liberation. At a later time, when the body breaks up and life ends, because of that former mental disposition he will certainly attain the imperturbable. This is reckoned the third explanation of the path to pure imperturbability.

Again, a learned noble disciple contemplates thus, “Sensual perceptions now or in the future, perceptions of form now or in the future, and the perception of imperturbability—all of these perceptions are of an imper- manent nature, _dukkha,_ and [subject] to cessation.”^48 At that time he will attain the perception of nothingness. Practicing in this way, training in this way, cultivating in this way, broadly and exten- sively, he attains purity of the mind in regard to that sphere. Having attained purity of the mind in regard to that sphere, such a monk will either gain entry into here, or else employ wisdom for the sake of lib- eration. At a later time, when the body breaks up and life ends, because of that former mental disposition he will certainly attain .^49 This is reckoned the first explanation of the path to the sphere of pure nothingness. Again, a learned noble disciple contemplates, “This world is empty, empty of a self and of anything belonging to a self, empty of anything permanent, empty of anything enduring, empty of continuous existence, empty of being unchanging.”^50 Practicing in this way, training in this way, cultivating in this way, broadly and extensively, he attains purity of the mind in regard to that sphere. Having attained purity of the mind in regard to that sphere, such a monk will either gain entry into the sphere of nothingness right here, or else employ wisdom for the sake of liberation. At a later time, when the body breaks up and life ends, because of that former mental disposition he will certainly attain the sphere of nothingness. This is reckoned the second explanation of the path to the sphere of pure nothingness. Again, a learned noble disciple contemplates thus, “I am not another’s possession and I do not have possessions myself.”^51 Practicing in this way, training in this way, cultivating in this way, broadly and extensively, he attains purity of the mind in regard to that sphere. Having attained purity of the mind in regard to that sphere, such a monk will either gain entry into the sphere of nothingness right here, or else employ wisdom for the sake of liberation. At a later time, when the body breaks up and life ends, because of that former mental disposition he will certainly attain the sphere of nothingness. This is reckoned the third explanation of the path to the sphere of pure nothingness.

Again, a learned noble disciple contemplates, thus: “Sensual pleasures now or in the future, material forms now or in the future, sensual percep- tions now or in the future, perceptions of form now or in the future, the perception of imperturbability, and the perception of the sphere of noth- ingness—all of these perceptions are of an impermanent nature, _dukkha,_ and [subject] to cessation.”^52 At that time he will attain [neither-perception-nor-]nonperception. Practicing in this way, training in this way, cultivating in this way, broadly and extensively, he attains purity of the mind in regard to that sphere. Having attained purity of the mind in regard to that sphere, such a monk will gain entry into [neither-perception-nor-]nonperception right here, or else employ wisdom for the sake of liberation. At a later time, when the body breaks up and life ends, because of that former mental disposition he will certainly attain the sphere of [neither-perception-nor-]nonperception. This is reckoned the explanation of the path to pure [neither-perception- nor-]nonperception. At that time Venerable Ānanda was fanning the Buddha. Then Venerable Ānanda extended his hands with palms joined towards the Buddha and said:

World-honored One, suppose a monk practices thus: “There is no I, nor anything belonging to me; I will not be, what belongs to me will not be. If [something] has earlier [come to] exist, it will be extinguished,” and he attains equanimity [by practicing in this way]. World-honored One, will a monk who practices in this way ultimately attain final nirvana?” The World-honored One replied, “Ānanda, this matter is uncertain. There are some who attain it; there are some who do not attain it.” Venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, [through] practicing in what way does a monk not attain final nirvana?” The World-honored One said: Ānanda, suppose a monk practices in this way: “[There is] no I, nor any- thing belonging to me; I will not be, what belongs to me will not be. If [something] has earlier [come to] exist, it will be extinguished,” and he attains equanimity [by practicing in this way]. Ānanda, if the monk delights in that equanimity, becomes attached to that equanimity, becomes established

in that equanimity, then, Ānanda, practicing in this way the monk will certainly not attain final nirvana.” Venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, if a monk has such clinging he will then not attain final nirvana?” The World-honored One said, “Ānanda, if a monk has such clinging he will certainly not attain final nirvana.” Venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, to what is that monk clinging?” The World-honored One said, “Ānanda, in his practice there is a remainder [of clinging], namely, to the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception. Among [states of] existence this is foremost, and that monk is clinging to it.” Venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, so that monk is practicing with a remainder of clinging?” The World-honored One said, “Ānanda, in this way the monk is indeed practicing with a remainder of clinging.” Venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, by practicing in what way will a monk certainly attain final nirvana?” The World-honored One said: Ānanda, suppose a monk practices in this way: “[There is] no I, nor any thing belonging to me; I will not be, and what belongs to me will not be. If [something] has earlier [come to] exist, it will be extinguished” and he [thereby] attains equanimity. Ānanda, if the monk does not delight in that equanimity, does not become attached to that equanimity, does not become established in that equanimity, then, Ānanda, practicing in this way the monk will certainly attain final nirvana. Venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, if a monk clings to nothing, then will he certainly attain final nirvana?” The World-honored One said, “Ānanda, if a monk clings to nothing he will certainly attain final nirvana.” Then Venerable Ānanda extended his hands with palms joined toward the Buddha and said: The World-honored One has explained the path to pure imperturbability, he has explained the path to the sphere of pure nothingness, he has

explained the path to pure [neither-perception-nor-]nonperception, he has explained nirvana without remainder.^53 World-honored One, what is noble liberation?

The World-honored One replied:

Ānanda, a learned noble disciple contemplates in this way: “Sensual pleas- ures now or in the future, forms now or in the future, sensual perceptions now or in the future, perceptions of form now or in the future, the perception of imperturbability, the perception of the sphere of nothingness, and the perception of [neither-perception-nor-]nonperception—all of these per- ceptions are of an impermanent nature, _dukkha,_ and [subject] to cessation. This is what is called one’s own existence ( _sakkāya_ ). If there is one’s own existence, [then] there is birth, old age, disease, and death.” Ānanda, if there is this reality—total extinction, cessation without remainder, no further existence—then there will be no birth, old age, dis- ease, and death. A noble [disciple] contemplates thus: “If this exists, it certainly has the nature of liberation. If there is nirvana without remainder, that is called the deathless.” With such contemplation and such a view he will certainly attain liberation of the mind from the taint of sensual desire, liberation of the mind from the taint of existence and from the taint of ignorance. Being liberated, he knows he is liberated, knowing as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done. There will not be another experiencing of existence.” Ānanda, I have now explained to you the path to pure imperturbability, I have explained the path to the sphere of pure nothingness, I have explained the path to pure [neither-perception-nor-]nonperception, I have explained nirvana without remainder, and I have explained noble liberation. What a teacher should do for his disciples out of great compassion, mercy, sympathy, and concern, seeking their benefit and welfare, seeking their safety and happiness, that I have now already done. You too should do your part. Go and sit in meditation and contemplation in a secluded place, in a forest, at the base of a tree, in an empty and quiet place. Do not be negligent, make diligent effort, lest you [come to] regret it later. This is my instruction, this is my teaching!

Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, Venerable Ānanda and the [other] monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
