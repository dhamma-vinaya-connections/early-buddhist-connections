### 95. The Discourse on Maintaining [Wholesome] States

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: I shall explain what is regressing in wholesome states, neither maintaining them nor increasing them; I shall explain what is maintaining wholesome states, neither regressing in them nor increasing them; and I shall explain what is increasing wholesome states, neither regressing in them nor [merely] maintaining them.^189 What is regressing in wholesome states, neither maintaining them nor increasing them? Monks, if, in regard to possessing firm faith, restraint through the precepts, broad learning, generosity, wisdom, eloquence, and [knowing] the Āgamas and their benefits, a person regresses in regard to these states, neither maintaining nor increasing them, then this is what is called regressing in wholesome states, neither maintaining them nor increasing them.^190 What is maintaining wholesome states, neither regressing in them nor increasing them? Monks, in regard to possessing firm faith, restraint through

the precepts, broad learning, generosity, wisdom, eloquence, and [knowing] the Āgamas and their benefits, a person maintains these states, not regressing in them and not increasing them. This is what is called maintaining whole- some states, neither regressing in them nor increasing them. What is increasing wholesome states, neither regressing in them nor [merely] maintaining them? Monks, in regard to possessing firm faith, restraint through the precepts, broad learning, generosity, wisdom, elo- quence, and [knowing] the Āgamas and their benefits, here a person increases in regard to these states, neither regressing in them nor [merely] maintaining them. This is what is called increasing wholesome states, nei- ther regressing in them nor [merely] maintaining them. A monk will ensure much benefit for himself if he contemplates like this:^191 “Am I often given to covetousness, or am I often free of covetous- ness? Am I often given to hatred, or am I often free of hatred? Am I often given to sloth-and-torpor, or am I often free of sloth-and-torpor? Am I often given to restlessness and arrogance, or am I often free of restlessness and arrogance? Am I often given to doubt, or am I often free of doubt? Am I often disputatious, or am I often not disputatious? Do I often have a defiled and stained mind, or do I often not have a defiled and stained mind? “Do I often have faith, or do I often lack faith? Do I often have energy, or am I often given to indolence? Do I often have mindfulness, or do I often lack mindfulness? Do I often have concentration, or do I often lack concentration? Do I often have faulty wisdom, or am I often free of faulty wisdom?” Suppose that a monk, while contemplating, knows, “I am often given to covetousness,... hatred,... sloth-and-torpor,... restlessness and arro- gance,... doubt,... disputatiousness,... a defiled and stained mind,... lack of faith,... indolence,... lack of mindfulness,... lack of concen- tration,... faulty wisdom.” That monk, wishing to eradicate these evil unwholesome states, will seek the means to train with great diligence, with right mindfulness and right comprehension, persevering in order not to regress. It is just as a person whose head is on fire or whose clothes are on fire will quickly seek the means to save his head and save his clothes. In the

same way a monk, wishing to eradicate these evil unwholesome states, will quickly seek the means to train with great diligence, with right mind- fulness and right comprehension, persevering in order not to regress. Suppose a monk, while contemplating, knows, “I am often free of cov- etousness,... free of hatred,... free of sloth-and-torpor,... free of rest- lessness and arrogance,... free of doubt,... free of disputatiousness,... and free of a defiled and stained mind;... I have faith,... have energy,... have mindfulness,... and have concentration;... and I often dwell free of faulty wisdom.” Then that monk, wishing to maintain these wholesome states, wishing not to lose them, not to regress, but to develop them further, will quickly seek the means to train with great diligence, with right mindfulness and right comprehension, persevering in order not to regress. It is just as a person whose head is on fire or whose clothes are on fire will quickly seek the means to save his head and clothes. In the same way a monk, wishing to maintain these wholesome states, wishing not to lose them, not to regress, but to develop them further, will quickly seek the means to train with great diligence, with right mindfulness and right com- prehension, persevering in order not to regress.^192 Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
