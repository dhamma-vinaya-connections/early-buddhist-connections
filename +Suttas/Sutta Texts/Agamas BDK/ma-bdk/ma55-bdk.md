### 55. The Discourse on Nirvana

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks:

[The attainment of] nirvana is conditioned; it is not without condition. By what is [the attainment of] nirvana conditioned? The answer is: [the attainment of] nirvana is conditioned by liberation. Liberation too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is liberation conditioned? The answer is: liberation is conditioned by dispassion. Dispassion too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is dispassion conditioned? The answer is: dispassion is conditioned by disenchantment. Disenchantment too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is disenchantment conditioned? The answer is: disenchantment is conditioned by seeing and knowing things as they really are. Seeing and knowing things as they really are is conditioned too; it is not without conditions. By what is seeing and knowing things as they really are conditioned? The answer is: seeing and knowing things as they really are is conditioned by concentration. Concentration too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is concentration conditioned? The answer is: concentration is conditioned by happiness. Happiness too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is happiness conditioned? The answer is: happiness is conditioned by tranquility. Tranquility too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is tranquility conditioned? The answer is: tranquility is conditioned by rapture. Rapture too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is rapture conditioned? The answer is: rapture is conditioned by joy. Joy too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is joy conditioned? The answer is: Joy is conditioned by being without regret. Being without regret too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is being without regret conditioned? The answer is: being without regret is conditioned by keeping the precepts. Keeping the precepts too is conditioned; it is not without conditions.

By what is keeping the precepts conditioned? The answer is: keeping the precepts is conditioned by guarding the sense faculties. Guarding the sense faculties too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is guarding the sense faculties conditioned? The answer is: guarding the sense faculties is conditioned by right mind fulness and right attentiveness. Right mindfulness and right attentiveness too are conditioned; they are not without conditions. By what are right mindfulness and right attentiveness conditioned? The answer is: right mindfulness and right attentiveness are conditioned by right attention. Right attention too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is right attention conditioned? The answer is: right attention is conditioned by faith. Faith too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is faith conditioned? The answer is: faith is conditioned by suffering. Suffering too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is suffering conditioned? The answer is: suffering is conditioned by old age and death. Old age and death too are conditioned; they are not without con ditions. By what are old age and death conditioned? The answer is: old age and death are conditioned by birth. Birth too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is birth conditioned? The answer is: birth is conditioned by the process of existence. The process of existence too is conditioned; it is not without con ditions. By what is the process of existence conditioned? The answer is: the process of existence is conditioned by clinging. Clinging too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is clinging conditioned? The answer is: clinging is conditioned by crav ing. Craving too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is craving conditioned? The answer is: craving is conditioned by feeling. Feeling too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is feeling conditioned? The answer is: feeling is conditioned by contact. Contact too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what

is contact conditioned? The answer is: contact is conditioned by the six senses. The six senses too are conditioned; they are not without condi- tions.^148 By what are the six senses conditioned? The answer is: the six senses are conditioned by name-and-form. Name-and-form too is con- ditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is name-and-form con- ditioned? The answer is: name-and-form is conditioned by conscious- ness. Consciousness too is conditioned; it is not without conditions. By what is consciousness conditioned? The answer is: consciousness is conditioned by karmic formations. Karmic formations too are con- ditioned; they are not without conditions. By what are karmic formations conditioned? The answer is: karmic formations are conditioned by ignorance. Thus, based on ignorance there are karmic formations. Based on karmic formations there is consciousness. Based on consciousness there is name-and-form. Based on name-and-form there are the six senses. Based on the six senses there is contact. Based on contact there is feeling. Based on feeling there is craving. Based on craving there is clinging. Based on clinging there is the process of existence. Based on the process of existence there is birth. Based on birth there is old age and death. Based on old age and death there is suffering. Conditioned by suffering there is faith. Conditioned by faith there is right attention. Conditioned by right attention there are right mind- fulness and right attentiveness. Conditioned by right mindfulness and right attentiveness there is guarding of the sense faculties, keeping of the precepts, being without regret, experiencing joy, rapture, tranquility, happiness, concentration, seeing and knowing things as they really are, disenchantment, dispas- sion, liberation. And conditioned by liberation, nirvana is attained. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
