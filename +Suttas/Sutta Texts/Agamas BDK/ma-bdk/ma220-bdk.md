### 220. The Discourse on Views

Thus have I heard. At one time, not long after the final nirvana of the Buddha, the venerable Ānanda was staying at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. At that time there was a brahmin, a heterodox practitioner who had been a friend of the venerable Ānanda before Ānanda had gone forth. Wandering about in the afternoon, this brahmin approached the venerable Ānanda. Having exchanged greetings, he stepped back, sat to one side and said to the venerable Ānanda, “I would like to ask a question. Am I permitted to ask it?” The venerable Ānanda answered, “Brahmin, ask whatever you wish to ask. Having heard it, I will consider it.” The brahmin who was a heterodox practitioner asked this: There are these views that were abandoned and set aside [by the Buddha], on which no exhaustive statement was made [by him], namely, “the world is eternal,” “the world is not eternal”; “the world is finite,”’ ‘the world is infi- nite”; “the life-force is the same as the body,” ‘the life-force is different from the body”; “the Tathāgata exists after death,” “the Tathāgata does not exist after death,” “the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death,” “the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.” Did the renunciant Gotama understand these views as they should be understood? The venerable Ānanda answered: Brahmin, concerning these views, which the World-honored One, the Tathā- gata, free from attachment and fully awakened, abandoned and set aside, on which he did not make an exhaustive statement, namely, “the world is eternal,” “the world is not eternal”; “the world is finite,” “the world is infi- nite”; “the life-force is the same as the body,” “the life-force is different from the body”; “the Tathāgata exists after death,” “the Tathāgata does not exist after death,” “the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death,” “the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death”—the World- honored One, the Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened, understood these views as they should be understood.

The brahmin who was a heterodox practitioner asked further: Concerning these views that the renunciant Gotama abandoned and set aside, on which he did not make an exhaustive statement, namely, “the world is eternal,” “the world is not eternal”; “the world is finite,” “the world is infinite”; “the life-force is the same as the body,” “the life-force is different from the body”; “the Tathāgata exists after death,” “the Tathā gata does not exist after death,” “the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death,” “the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death”—how did the renunciant Gotama understand these views as they should be understood? The venerable Ānanda answered: Brahmin, concerning these views, namely, “the world is eternal,” “the world is not eternal”; “the world is finite,” “the world is infinite”; “the life-force is the same as the body,” “the life-force is different from the body”; “the Tathā gata exists after death,” “the Tathāgata does not exist after death,” “the Tathā gata both exists and does not exist after death,” “the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death”—why did the World-honored One, the Tathā gata, free from attachment and fully awakened, abandon them, set them aside, and not make an exhaustive statement on them? Brahmin, heterodox practitioner have views like this,^402 cling to them like this, attend to them like this, generate them like this, arrive at the next life like this, namely, “the world is eternal,” “the world is not eternal”; “the world is finite,” “the world is infinite”; “the life-force is the same as the body,” “the life-force is different from the body”; “the Tathāgata exists after death,” “the Tathāgata does not exist after death,” “the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death,” “the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.” [Yet] all of these views the World-honored One, the Tathā gata, free from attachment and fully awakened, abandoned, set aside, without making an exhaustive statement on them. Thus did he understand these views, and thus should these views be understood [by us].

The brahmin who was a heterodox practitioner said, “I now take refuge in Ānanda.”

The venerable Ānanda told him, “Brahmin, do not take refuge in me. Since I myself have taken refuge in the Buddha, you too should take refuge in him.” The brahmin who was a heterodox practitioner said: Ānanda, I now take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha of monks. May the World-honored One receive me as a lay disciple,^403 from this day on until the end of life, I take refuge for my whole life. This is what the venerable Ānanda said. Having heard what the venerable Ānanda said, the brahmin who [formerly] was a heterodox practitioner was delighted and received it respectfully.
