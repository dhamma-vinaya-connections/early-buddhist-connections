### 57. The Discourse Spoken for the Monks

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: There are five supporting conditions that are conducive to maturing liberation of the mind that has not yet matured. What are the five? A monk is himself a good friend [to others] and associates with good friends, keeps the company of good friends—this is the first sup porting condition conducive to maturing liberation of the mind that has not yet matured.

Again, a monk observes the training in the precepts, guards [against breaking] the code of rules, and skillfully controls his comportment [in accordance with] proper conduct, seeing great danger in even the slightest transgression and being apprehensive of it. Keeping the pre- cepts is the second supporting condition conducive to maturing liber- ation of the mind that has not yet matured. Again, a monk speaks about noble, meaningful matters, matters that cause the mind to become gentle, cause it to be without hindrances, namely, talk about the precepts, about concentration, wisdom, liberation, the knowledge and vision that come with liberation, talk about self- effacement, about not enjoying socializing, about reducing desire, about contentment, abandoning, dispassion, extinction, sitting in seclu- sion, and about dependent origination. To obtain, in this way, the [kind of] talk appropriate for renunciants, fully, easily, without difficulty— this is the third supporting condition conducive to maturing liberation of the mind that has not yet matured. Again, a monk makes relentless effort to abandon what is unwhole- some, and to cultivate all wholesome states. He constantly arouses the single-minded and unwavering intention to cultivate wholesome roots, and does not give up his task. This is the fourth supporting condition conducive to maturing liberation of the mind that has not yet matured. Again, a monk develops comprehension and wisdom, attains under- standing concerning the rise and fall of phenomena, attains noble pen- etrative knowledge and discriminative understanding concerning the true cessation of suffering. This is the fifth supporting condition con- ducive to maturing liberation of the mind that has not yet matured. Once endowed with these five supporting conditions, [a monk] should practice further in four ways. What are the four ways? He prac- tices meditation on impurity [of the body] in order to cut off desire. He practices loving-kindness meditation in order to cut off hatred. He practices mindfulness of breathing in order to cut off distracting thoughts. He practices perception of impermanence in order to cut off the conceit “I am.” If a monk is himself a good friend [to others] and associates with good friends, keeps the company of good friends, then know that he

is bound to observe the training in the precepts, to guard [against break ing] the code of rules, and skillfully control his comportment [in accor dance with] proper conduct, seeing great danger in even the slightest transgression and being apprehensive of it. If a monk is himself a good friend [to others] and associates with good friends, keeps the company of good friends, then know that he is bound to speak about noble, meaningful matters, matters that cause the mind to become gentle, cause it to be without hindrances, namely, talk about the precepts, concentration, wisdom, liberation, about the knowl edge and vision that come with liberation, talk about self-effacement, about not enjoying socializing, about reducing desire, about contentment, abandoning, dispassion, extinction, about sitting in meditation, and about dependent origination. He will obtain, in this way, [the kind of] talk appropriate for renunciants, fully, easily, without difficulty. If a monk is himself a good friend [to others] and associates with good friends, keeps the company of good friends, then know that he is bound to make relentless effort to cut off what is unwholesome and practice all wholesome states. He will constantly arouse single-minded and unwavering intention to cultivate wholesome roots, and will not give up his task. If a monk is himself a good friend [to others] and associates with good friends, keeps the company of good friends, then know that he is bound to develop comprehension and wisdom, attain understanding concerning the rise and fall of phenomena, attain noble penetrative knowledge and discriminative understanding concerning the true ces sation of suffering. If a monk is himself a good friend [to others] and associates with good friends, keeps the company of good friends, then know that he is bound to practice meditation on impurity [of the body] in order to cut off desire. He will practice loving-kindness meditation in order to cut off hatred. He will practice mindfulness of breathing in order to cut off distracting thoughts. He will practice the perception of impermanence in order to cut off the conceit “I am.” If a monk has gained perception of impermanence, he is bound to attain perception of no-self.

If a monk has attained awareness of no-self, he is bound to com- pletely abandon the conceit “I am” in this lifetime, to attain peace, ces- sation, extinction, the unconditioned, nirvana. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
