### 141. The Discourse with Similes

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: Of the countless wholesome states that are attainable, all are based on being without negligence; they are practiced by being without negligence, will arise through being without negligence, and are headed by being without negligence. Being without negligence is foremost among all wholesome states. It is just as, in agriculture, everything is accomplished based on the earth, depends on the earth, and is established on the earth. In the same way, of the countless wholesome states that are attainable, all are based on being without negligence; they are practiced by being without negligence, will arise through being without negligence, and are headed by being without negligence. Being without negligence is foremost of all wholesome states. It is just as with seed for planting—in a village or even in a deserted village—of the hundreds of edible grains and medicinal herbs that are able to grow and flourish, all grow and flourish based on the earth, depend ing on the earth, and established on the earth.

In the same way, of the countless wholesome states that are attainable, all are based on being without negligence; they are practiced by being without negligence, will arise through being without negligence, and are headed by being without negligence. Being without negligence is foremost of all wholesome states. It is just as, of all root fragrances, the fragrance of aloeswood is fore- most; just as of all tree fragrances, the fragrance of red sandalwood is foremost; just as of all water flowers, the blue lotus is foremost; just as of all earth-dwelling flowers, jasmine is foremost; just as of animal foot- prints, all of which are included in the footprint of the elephant, the footprint of the elephant is foremost, since it is so broad. In the same way, of the countless wholesome states that are attainable, all are based on being without negligence; they are practiced by being without negligence, will arise through being without negligence, and are headed by being without negligence. Being without negligence is foremost of all wholesome states. It is just as, of all animals, the lion king is foremost; just as when fighting in battle formation, swearing a single oath is foremost; just as of the rafters of a multistoried building, which are all established on the ridge beam, and the ridge beam supports them all, the ridge beam is foremost since it supports them all. In the same way, of the countless wholesome states that are attainable, all are based on being without negligence; they are practiced by being without negligence, will arise through being without negligence, and are headed by being without negligence. Being without negligence is foremost of all wholesome states. It is just as, of all mountains, Sumeru, king of mountains, is foremost; just as, of all springs, great springs that accumulate water, the great ocean is foremost; just as, of all great bodies, the king of _asura_ s is foremost; just as, of all those who wait expectantly, King Māra is foremost; just as, of all those who engage in sensuality, King Mandhātu is foremost; just as of all lesser kings, the wheel-turning monarch is foremost; just as, of all the stars and constellations in space, the moon is foremost; just as, of all silk garments, softened whitened silk is foremost; just as of all radiances, the radiance of wisdom is foremost; just as, of all assemblies, the assembly

of the Tathāgata’s disciples is foremost; just as, of all dharmas, conditioned and unconditioned, the eradication of craving, dispassion, cessation, nirvana is foremost; just as, of all sentient beings—those with no legs, two legs, four legs, or many legs, material or immaterial, those with per ception, without perception, or even neither-with-perception-nor-with out-perception—the Tathāgata is foremost in terms of being great, being supreme, being the utmost, being superb, being worthy of respect, and being sublime. It is just as, based on cows there is milk; based on milk there is cream; based on cream there is fresh butter; based on fresh butter there is butter; based on butter there is ghee. [Of all these,] ghee is foremost in terms of being great, being supreme, being the utmost, being the superb, being worthy of respect, and being sublime. In the same way, of all sentient beings—those with no legs, two legs, four legs, or many legs, those with form or without form, those with per ception, without perception, or even neither-with-perception-nor-with out-perception—the Tathāgata is foremost in terms of being great, being supreme, being the utmost, being the superb, being worthy of respect, and being sublime. Then the World-honored One uttered these verses: If someone wishes their property To be excellent and to increase greatly, Then praise being without negligence, Whether in worldly life or in seclusion—so say the wise. Those who are without negligence Definitely obtain benefit both ways. They obtain it immediately in this world, And also obtain it in the future world. Bravely contemplating these benefits, Those who are wise will certainly attain liberation. Thus said the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
