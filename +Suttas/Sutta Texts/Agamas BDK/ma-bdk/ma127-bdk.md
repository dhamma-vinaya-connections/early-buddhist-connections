### 127. The Discourse on Fields of Merit

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Buddha, paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, stepped back, and sat to one side. He said, “World-honored One, how many kinds of persons are there in the world who are fields of merit?”

The World-honored One said: Householder, in the world there are altogether two kinds of persons who are fields of merit. What are the two? The first is the person who is in training. The second is the person who is beyond training. Of persons who are in training there are eighteen kinds, and of persons who are beyond training there are nine kinds.^403 Householder, what are the eighteen kinds of persons in training? The faith follower, the Dharma follower, the one liberated by faith, the one who has attained vision, the body witness, the one who goes from clan to clan, the one-seeder,^404 the one on the path to stream-entry, the one who has attained stream-entry, the one on the path to once-returning, the one who has attained once-returning, the one on the path to nonreturning, the one who has attained nonreturning, the one who attains final nirvana in between, the one who attains final nirvana on being reborn, the one who attains final nirvana with effort, the one who attains final nirvana without effort, and the one who proceeds upstream to Akaniṭṭha Heaven; these are the eighteen kinds of persons in training. Householder, what are the nine kinds of persons beyond training?^405 [They are] the one who is capable at will [of putting an end to existence] ( cetanādharman ); the one who is capable of penetrating [without effort] ( prativedhanādharman ); the one who is in an immovable condition ( akopya dharman ); the one who is liable to regress ( parihāṇadharman ); the one who is not liable to regress ( aparihāṇadharman ); the one who is capable of protecting ( anurakṣaṇādharman ), [that is,] who while protecting himself will not regress, but if he does not protect himself he will regress; the one who is in a condition of standing firmly ( sthitākampya ); the one who is liberated by wisdom; and the one who is liberated on both sides. These are the nine kinds of persons who are beyond training. Then the World-honored One uttered these verses: In the world those who are in training and those who are beyond training Are worthy of respect, worthy of offerings. They are accomplished in maintaining correct [conduct of] body, And of speech and mind as well.

Householder, these are excellent fields [of merit]; One who makes offerings to them gains great merit. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
