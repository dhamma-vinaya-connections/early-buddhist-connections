### 92. The Discourse on the Simile of Blue and White Lotuses

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: There are states that are extinguished by the body and not extinguished by speech. There are states that are extinguished by speech and not

extinguished by the body. And there are states that are not extinguished by the body or by speech, but are extinguished only by wisdom and vision. What are states that are extinguished by the body and not extinguished by speech? Here a monk is filled with unwholesome bodily action, endowed with it and maintaining it, adhering to it bodily. Having seen this, other monks admonish that monk, “Venerable friend, you are filled with unwholesome bodily action, endowed with it and maintaining it. Why do you adhere to it bodily? Venerable friend, you should abandon unwholesome bodily action and cultivate wholesome bodily action.” At a later time that person abandons unwholesome bodily action and cultivates wholesome bodily action. This is what is meant by states that are extin- guished by the body and not extinguished by speech. What are states that are extinguished by speech and not extinguished by the body? Here a monk is filled with unwholesome verbal action, endowed with it and maintaining it, adhering to it verbally. Seeing this, other monks admonish that monk thus, “Venerable friend, you are filled with unwholesome verbal action, endowed with it and maintaining it. Why do you adhere to it verbally? Venerable friend, you should abandon unwholesome verbal action and cultivate wholesome verbal action.” At a later time that person abandons unwholesome verbal action and cultivates wholesome verbal action. This is what is meant by states that are extin- guished by speech and not extinguished by the body. What are states that are not extinguished by the body or by speech, but are extinguished only by wisdom and vision? Covetousness is not extinguished by the body or by speech, but is extinguished only by wisdom and vision. In the same way, disputatiousness,... anger,... ill-will,... uncom- municativeness,... avarice,... envy,... deceit,... flattery,... lack of shame and scruples,... evil desires and evil views are not extinguished by the body or by speech, but are extinguished only by wisdom and vision. This is what is meant by states that are not extinguished by the body or by speech, but are extinguished only by wisdom and vision. The Tathāgata at times practices examination, examining the mind of another person. He knows that this person is not cultivating the body, cultivating morality, cultivating his mind, and cultivating wisdom in such

a way that through cultivating the body, cultivating morality, cultivating the mind, and cultivating wisdom he could extinguish covetousness. Why is that? Because in the mind of that person evil [states] of covetousness are arising and remaining. In the same way, disputatiousness,... anger,... ill-will,... uncom municativeness,... avarice,... envy,... deceit,... flattery,... lack of shame and scruples,... he could extinguish evil desires and evil views. Why is that? Because in the mind of that person evil desires and evil views are arising and remaining. [The Tathāgata at times] knows that this [other] person is cultivating the body, cultivating morality, cultivating the mind, and cultivating wisdom in such a way that through cultivating the body, cultivating morality, cul tivating the mind, and cultivating wisdom, he could extinguish covetous ness. Why is that? Because in the mind of this person evil [states of] cov etousness are not arising and remaining. In the same way, disputatiousness,... anger,... ill-will,... uncom municativeness,... avarice,... envy,... deceit,... flattery,... lack of shame and scruples,... he could extinguish evil desires and evil views. Why is that? Because in the mind of that person evil desires and evil views are not arising and remaining. It is just as when a blue lotus, or a red, crimson, or white lotus is born in water and grows in water, but rises above the water and is not attached to the water. In the same way, a tathāgata is born in the world and grows up in the world, but rises above worldly conduct and is not attached to worldly states. Why is that? [Because] a tathāgata is free from attachment and fully awakened, having risen above all that is worldly.

At that time, Venerable Ānanda was holding a fan and attending on the Buddha. Then, extending his hands with palms joined toward the Buddha, Venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, what is the name of this dis course? How should we remember it?” The World-honored One said, “Ānanda, this discourse is called the ‘Sim ile of the Blue and White Lotuses.’ This is how you should remember and recite it.” Then the World-honored One addressed all the monks:

You should together remember this “Discourse on the Simile of the Blue and White Lotuses,” recite it, and commit it to memory. Why is that? This “Discourse on the Simile of the Blue and White Lotuses” accords with the Dharma and is conducive for benefit. It is a basis for the holy life, leading to penetration, awakening, and nirvana. Clansmen who have shaved off their hair and beards, donned the yellow robe, and out of faith given up the household life to become homeless and train in the path should memorize this “Discourse on the Simile of the Blue and White Lotuses,” reciting it and retaining it well. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, Venerable Ānanda and the [other] monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
