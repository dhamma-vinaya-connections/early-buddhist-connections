### 23. The Discourse on Wisdom

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time, the monk Moliyaphagguna had given up the precepts and stopped practicing the path. When the monk Kaḷārakhattiya heard that the monk Moliyaphagguna had given up the precepts and stopped practicing the path, he approached Venerable Sāriputta. After paying homage at [Sāriputta’s] feet, [Kaḷārakhattiya] sat down to one side. Having seated himself, he said: “Venerable Sāriputta, know that the monk Moliyaphagguna has given up the precepts and stopped practicing the path.” Venerable Sāriputta asked: “Was the monk Moliyaphagguna happy in the teaching?” The monk Kaḷārakhattiya asked in return: “Is Venerable Sāriputta happy in the teaching?” Venerable Sāriputta replied: “Kaḷārakhattiya, I harbor no doubts about the teaching.” The monk Kaḷārakhattiya further asked: “Venerable Sāriputta, how is it in regard to things yet to come?” Venerable Sāriputta replied: “Kaḷārakhattiya, I am also without perplexity in regard to things yet to come.” On hearing this, Kaḷārakhattiya rose from his seat and approached the Buddha. Having paid homage, he sat down to one side and addressed the Buddha:

World-honored One, Venerable Sāriputta has just now proclaimed that he has attained [final] knowledge, that he knows as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence.” On hearing this, the World-honored One said to one of the monks: “Go to Sāriputta and tell him, ‘The World-honored One summons you.’” Having been so instructed, that monk rose from his seat, saluted the Buddha, went to Venerable Sāriputta, and said: “The World-honored One summons Venerable Sāriputta.” Hearing this, Venerable Sāriputta approached the Buddha, and, having paid homage, sat down to one side. The World-honored One asked: Sāriputta, is it true that you declared having attained final knowledge, knowing as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence”? Venerable Sāriputta replied: “World-honored One, I did express that meaning, but not in those words, not in those phrases.” The World-honored One said: “Sāriputta, a clansman declares things in his own way. If he has attained final knowledge, then let him declare final knowledge.” Venerable Sāriputta replied: “World-honored One, as I have just said, I did express that meaning, but not in those words, not in those phrases.” The World-honored One asked: Sāriputta, if companions in the holy life come and ask you, “Venerable Sāriputta, knowing what and seeing what, do you declare having attained knowledge, declare knowing as it really is: ‘Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence”?—Sāriputta, on hearing this, how would you answer? Venerable Sāriputta replied: World-honored One, if my companions in the holy life come and ask me, “Venerable Sāriputta, knowing what and seeing what, do you

declare having attained knowledge, declare knowing as it really is: ‘Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence?’” World-honored One, on hearing this, I will answer in the following manner: “Venerable friends, birth has a cause. This cause for birth has been brought to an end. Knowing that the cause for birth has been brought to an end, I declare having attained final knowledge, knowing as it really is: ‘Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence.’” World-honored One, if companions in the holy life come and ask me this, I will answer in this manner. The World-honored One spoke in praise: Very good! Very good, Sāriputta! If companions in the holy life come and ask you this, you should answer in this manner. Why? Because if you speak in this manner, they will know what you mean. The World-honored One [further] asked: Sāriputta, if companions in the holy life come and ask you, “Venerable Sāriputta, what are the causes and conditions for birth? From what does birth arise? What is its basis?”—on hearing this question, how will you respond? Venerable Sāriputta replied: World-honored One, if companions in the holy life come and ask me: “Venerable Sāriputta, what are the causes and conditions for birth? From what does birth arise? What is its basis?”—on hearing this question, World-honored One, I will answer in the following manner: “Venerable friends, birth is caused by the process of existence, conditioned by the process of existence, it arises from the process of existence, has the process of existence as its basis.” World-honored One, if companions in the holy life come and ask me this, I will answer in this manner. The World-honored One spoke in praise: Very good! Very good, Sāriputta! If companions in the holy life and

ask you this, you should answer in this manner. Why? Because if you speak in this manner, they will know what you mean.

The World-honored One [further] asked:

Sāriputta, if companions in the holy life come and ask you, “Venerable Sāriputta, what are the causes and conditions for the process of exis tence? From what does it arise? What is its basis?”—on hearing this question, how would you answer?

Venerable Sāriputta replied:

World-honored One, if companions in the holy life come and ask me, “Venerable Sāriputta, what are the causes and conditions for the process of existence? From what does it arise? What is its basis?”—on hearing this question, World-honored One, I will answer in the following man ner: “Venerable friends, the process of existence is caused by clinging, conditioned by clinging, it arises from clinging, has clinging as its basis.” World-honored One, if companions in the holy life come and ask me this, I will answer in this manner.

The World-honored One spoke in praise:

Very good! Very good, Sāriputta! If companions in the holy life come and ask you this, you should answer in this manner. Why? Because if you speak in this manner, they will know what you mean.

The World-honored One [further] asked:

Sāriputta, if companions in the holy life come and ask you, “Venerable Sāriputta, what are the causes and conditions for clinging? From what does clinging arise? What is its basis?”—on hearing this question, how would you answer?

Venerable Sāriputta replied:

World-honored One, if companions in the holy life come and ask me: “Venerable Sāriputta, what are the causes and conditions for clinging? From what does it arise? What is its basis?”—on hearing this question, World-honored One, I will answer in the following manner: “Venerable

friends, clinging is caused by craving, conditioned by craving; it arises from craving, has craving as its basis.” World-honored One, if com panions in the holy life come and ask me this, I will answer in this manner. The World-honored One spoke in praise: Very good! Very good, Sāriputta! If companions in the holy life come and ask you this, you should answer in this manner. Why? Because if you speak in this manner, they will know what you mean. The World-honored One [further] asked: Sāriputta, if companions in the holy life come and ask you: “Venerable Sāriputta, and what about craving?”—on hearing this question, how would you answer? Venerable Sāriputta replied: World-honored One, if companions in the holy life come and ask me, “Venerable Sāriputta, and what about craving?”—on hearing this ques tion, World-honored One, I will answer in the following manner: “Ven erable friends, there are three kinds of feeling—pleasant feeling, unpleasant feeling, and neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant-feeling. Delight ing in, desiring, and grasping at these feelings is what is called craving.” World-honored One, if companions in the holy life come and ask me this, I will answer in this manner. The World-honored One spoke in praise: Very good! Very good, Sāriputta! If companions in the holy life come and ask you this, you should answer in this manner. Why? Because if you speak in this manner, they will know what you mean. The World-honored One [further] asked: Sāriputta, if companions in the holy life come and ask you, “Venerable Sāriputta, by knowing what and by seeing what is there no delighting in these three kinds of feeling, no desire for them or grasping at them?”—on hearing this question, how would you answer?

Venerable Sāriputta replied:

World-honored One, if companions in the holy life come and ask me, “Venerable Sāriputta, by knowing what and by seeing what is there no delighting in these three kinds of feeling, no desire for them or grasping at them?”—on hearing this question, World-honored One, I will answer in this manner: “Venerable friends, these three kinds of feelings are impermanent by nature, unsatisfactory by nature, of a nature to disin tegrate. What is impermanent by nature is unsatisfactory. Seeing this unsatisfactoriness, there is no more delighting in these three kinds of feeling, no desire for them or grasping at them.” World-honored One, if companions in the holy life come and ask me this, I will answer in this manner.

The World-honored One spoke in praise:

Very good! Very good, Sāriputta! If companions in the holy life come and ask you this, you should answer in this manner. Why? Because if you speak in this manner, they will know what you mean.

At that time, the World-honored One said:

Sāriputta, one could also give a brief summary of what you have just said. And what, Sāriputta, is this brief summary of what you have just said? It is this: “Whatever is felt and acted upon is all unsatisfactory”— Sāriputta, this is a brief summary of what you have just said.

The World-honored One [further] asked:

Sāriputta, if companions in the holy life come and ask you: “Venerable Sāriputta, how is it that by turning away [from grasping at feeling] you declare having attained final knowledge, declare knowing as it really is: ‘Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence’?”

Venerable Sāriputta replied:

World-honored One, if companions in the holy life come and ask me, “Venerable Sāriputta, how is it that by turning away [from grasping at

feeling] you declare having attained final knowledge, declare knowing as it really is: ‘Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence’?”— World-honored One, on hearing this question, I would answer in the following manner: “Venerable friends, through my inwardly turning away [from grasping at feeling], all craving has come to an end, there is no apprehension, no fear, no doubt, no perplexity. I live protected in this way. Through my living protected in this way, unwholesome taints do not arise.” World-honored One, if companions in the holy life come and ask me this, I will answer in this manner. The World-honored One spoke in praise: Very good! Very good, Sāriputta! If companions in the holy life come and ask you this, you should answer in this manner. Why? Because if you speak in this manner, they will know what you mean. The World-honored One said: Sāriputta, one could also give a brief summary of what you have just said: “Whatever fetters have been spoken of by the Renunciant (i.e., the Buddha), those fetters do not exist in me. I live protected in this way. Through my living protected in this manner, unwholesome taints do not arise”—Sāriputta, this is the brief summary of what you have just said. After saying this, the World-honored One rose from his seat and returned to his hut to sit in meditation. Soon after the World-honored One had returned to his hut, Venerable Sāriputta told the monks [in the assembly]:

Venerable friends, earlier I had not considered [these matters]; thus, when the World-honored One suddenly asked those questions, I thought: “I’m afraid I won’t be able to answer.” [But,] venerable friends, my first answer was approved and praised by the World-honored One, and I then thought: “If the World-honored One were to question me on this matter for a whole day and night, posing his questions in different words and phrases, I would be able to answer in [correspondingly] dif ferent words and phrases. If the World-honored One were to question me on this matter for two, three, four, even up to seven days and nights,

posing his questions in different words and phrases, I would be able to answer the World-honored One in [correspondingly] different words and phrases.” On hearing Venerable Sāriputta speak in this way, the monk Kaḷārakhat- tiya rose from his seat and right away approached the Buddha. He said to the World-honored One:

Soon after the World-honored One returned to his hut, Venerable Sāriputta made a weighty proclamation, roared a lion’s roar, saying: “Venerable friends, earlier I had not considered [these matters]; thus, when the World-honored One suddenly asked those questions, I thought: ‘I’m afraid I won’t be able to answer.’ [But,] venerable friends, my first answer was approved and praised by the World-honored One, and I then thought: ‘If the World-honored One were to question me on this matter for a whole day and night, posing his questions in different words and phrases, I would be able to answer the World-honored One in [correspondingly] different words and phrases for a whole day and night. Venerable friends, if the World-honored One were to question me on this matter for two, three, four, even up to seven days and nights, posing his questions in different words and phrases, I would be able to answer in [correspondingly] different words and phrases.’” The World-honored One said: Indeed so, Kaḷārakhattiya! If I were to question the monk Sāriputta on this matter for a whole day and night, posing questions in different words and phrases, he would be able to reply with [correspondingly] different words and phrases. Kaḷārakhattiya, if I were to question the monk Sāriputta on this matter for two, three, four, even up to seven days and nights, posing questions in different words and phrases, he would be able to reply with [correspondingly] different words and phrases. Why? Because, Kaḷārakhattiya, the monk Sāriputta has deeply comprehended the realm of thought. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, Venerable Sāriputta and the other monks were delighted and remembered them well.
