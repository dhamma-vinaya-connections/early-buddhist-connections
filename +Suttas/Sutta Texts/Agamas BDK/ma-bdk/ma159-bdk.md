### 159. The Discourse to Aggilāyana

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the brahmin Aggilāyana, while roaming around in the afternoon, approached the Buddha, exchanged polite greetings, stepped back, sat to one

side, and said, “Gotama, I wish to ask a question. Will you listen if I venture to express it?” The World-honored One said, “Feel free to ask.” Then the brahmin asked, “Gotama, dependent on what do the brahmin texts remain?” The World-honored One replied, “Dependent on the people, the brahmin texts remain.” The brahmin asked again, “Gotama, dependent on what do the people remain?” The World-honored One replied, “Dependent on rice and wheat, the people remain.” The brahmin asked again, “Gotama, dependent on what do rice and wheat remain?” The World-honored One replied, “Dependent on the earth, rice and wheat remain.” The brahmin asked again, “Gotama, dependent on what does the earth remain?” The World-honored One replied, “Dependent on water, the earth remains.” The brahmin asked again, “Gotama, dependent on what does water remain?” The World-honored One replied, “Dependent on wind, water remains.” The brahmin asked again, “Gotama, dependent on what does wind remain?” The World-honored One replied, “Dependent on space, wind remains.” The brahmin asked again, “Gotama, dependent on what does space remain?” The World-honored One replied, “Space is dependent on nothing, yet because of the sun and moon, therefore there is empty space.” The brahmin asked again, “Gotama, dependent on what do the sun and moon remain?” The World-honored One replied, “Dependent on the Four Heavenly Kings, the sun and moon remain.” The brahmin asked again, “Gotama, dependent on what do the Four Heav- enly Kings remain?” The World-honored One replied, “Dependent on the _deva_ s of the Thirty- three, the Four Heavenly Kings remain.”

The brahmin asked again, “Gotama, dependent on what do the _deva_ s of the Thirty-three remain?” The World-honored One replied, “Dependent on the Yāma _deva_ s, the _deva_ s of the Thirty-three remain.” The brahmin asked again, “Gotama, dependent on what do the Yāma _deva_ s remain?” The World-honored One replied, “Dependent on the Tusita _deva_ s, the Yāma _deva_ s remain.” The brahmin asked again, “Gotama, dependent on what do the Tusita _deva_ s remain?” The World-honored One replied, “Dependent on the _deva_ s who Delight in Creating, the Tusita _deva_ s remain.” The brahmin asked again, “Gotama, dependent on what do the _deva_ s who Delight in Creating remain?” The World-honored One replied, “Dependent on the _deva_ s who Wield Power over Others’ Creations, the _deva_ s who Delight in Creating remain.” The brahmin asked again, “Gotama, dependent on what do the _deva_ s who Wield Power Over Others’ Creations remain?” The World-honored One replied, “Dependent on the Brahmā world, the _deva_ s who Wield Power Over Others’ Creations remain.” The brahmin asked again, “Gotama, dependent on what does the Brahmā world remain?” The World-honored One replied, “Dependent on the Great Brahmā, the Brahmā world remains.” The brahmin asked again, “Gotama, dependent on what does the Great Brahmā remain?” The World-honored One replied, “Dependent on patience, humility, gen- tleness, and goodness, the Great Brahmā remains.” The brahmin asked again, “Gotama, dependent on what do patience, humility, gentleness, and goodness remain?” The World-honored One replied, “Dependent on nirvana, patience, humility, gentleness, and goodness remain.” The brahmin asked again, “Gotama, dependent on what does nirvana remain?”

The World-honored One replied: Brahmin, you are asking for a dependence of what is infinite. You are now asking me about what is limitless. Indeed, nirvana is not dependent on anything to remain. Nirvana is total cessation. Nirvana is supreme. Brah- min, it is for the sake of this that one practices the holy life under me. The brahmin said: World-honored One, I have understood. Well-gone One, I have compre- hended. World-honored One, from now on I go for refuge to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha of monks. May the World-honored One accept me as a lay disciple from this day forth until the end of life, as having personally gone for refuge for my whole life. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the brahmin Aggilāyana was delighted and received it respectfully.
