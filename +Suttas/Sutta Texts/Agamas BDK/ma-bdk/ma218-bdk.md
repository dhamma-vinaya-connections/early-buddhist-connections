### 218. The [First] Discourse by Anuruddha

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time, in the afternoon, some monks rose from their meditation and approached the venerable Anuruddha. Having paid homage with their heads at his feet, they stepped back and sat to one side. They said, “We would like to ask a question. If permitted, may we venture to state it?”

The venerable Anuruddha answered, “Venerable friends, ask whatever you wish to ask. Having heard it, I will consider it.” Then the monks asked, “What does it mean for a monk to die well, to die a good death?” The venerable Anuruddha answered: Venerable friends, suppose that a monk, secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states... up to... dwells having attained the fourth absorption. Such a monk is said to die well, to die a good death. Then the monks asked further, “Is this the best way for a monk to die? Is this the best death?” The venerable Anuruddha answered: Venerable friends, this is not the best way for a monk to die. It is not the best death. Again, venerable friends, suppose a monk attains the supernormal powers... the divine hearing... knowledge of the minds of others... knowledge of former existences... knowledge of death and rebirth... and the cessation of the taints. Being without taints, [he attains] liberation of the mind, liberation through wisdom. In this very life he personally attains understanding and awakening, and dwells having personally realized it. He understands as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing of existence.” Such a monk is said to die well, to die a good death. Then the monks asked further, “Is this the best way for a monk to die? Is this the best death?” The venerable Anuruddha answered, “Venerable friends, this is [indeed] the best way for a monk to die. This is the best death.” Then the monks, having heard what the venerable Anuruddha had said, having received and remembered it well, rose from their seats, paid homage at the venerable Anuruddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and left. This is what the venerable Anuruddha said. Having heard what the venerable Anuruddha had said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
