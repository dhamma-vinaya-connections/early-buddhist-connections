### 124. The Discourse on Eight Obstacles

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: For one who [intends to] practice the holy life, there are eight obstacles, eight untimely conditions. What are the eight? At the time when a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a well-gone one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassable person, leader on the path of Dharma, teacher of deva s and human beings, called a buddha, an exalted one, has appeared in the world and teaches the Dharma that leads to calmness, leads to com plete cessation, leads to the path of awakening expounded by the Well gone One—at that time this person is reborn in hell. This is the first obstacle, the first untimely condition for one who [intends to] practice the holy life. Again, at the time when a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awak ened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a well-gone one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassable person, leader on the path of Dharma, teacher of deva s and human beings, called a buddha, an exalted one, has appeared in the world and teaches the Dharma that leads to calmness, leads to complete cessation, leads to the path of awakening expounded by the Well-gone One—at that time this person is reborn in the realm of animals... is reborn in the realm of hungry ghosts... is reborn in a

heaven of long life... is reborn in a border country among barbarians who have no faith and no kindness, who are ungrateful, where there are no monks, nuns, or male and female lay disciples. This is the fifth obstacle, the fifth untimely condition for one who [intends to] practice the holy life. Again, at the time when a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awak- ened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a well-gone one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassable person, leader on the path of Dharma, teacher of _deva_ s and human beings, called a buddha, an exalted one, has appeared in the world and teaches the Dharma that leads to calmness, leads to complete cessation, leads to the path of awakening expounded by the Well-gone One—at that time this person is reborn in the Middle Kingdom, but he is deaf and dumb like a bleating sheep, only able to com- municate through sign language, unable to understand whether the meaning of what is said is good or evil. This is the sixth obstacle, the sixth untimely condition for one who [intends to] practice the holy life. Again, at the time when a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awak- ened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a well-gone one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassable person, leader on the path of Dharma, teacher of _deva_ s and human beings, called a buddha, an exalted one, has appeared in the world and teaches the Dharma that leads to calmness, leads to complete cessation, leads to the path of awakening expounded by the Well-gone One—at that time this person is reborn in the Middle Kingdom, he is not deaf and not dumb like a bleating sheep, does not only communicate through sign language, is able to understand whether the meaning of what is said is good or evil, yet he possesses wrong and per- verted views, holding views and doctrines such as these: there is no [merit in] giving, no offering, and no recitation of hymns; there is no [distinction between] wholesome and unwholesome actions; there is no result of wholesome and unwholesome actions; there is neither this life nor the next life; there is no [responsibility toward one’s] mother or father; in this world there are no arahants who have reached a good attainment, who are well gone, well advanced, who have personally realized this world and the next world through understanding, awakening, and realization. This is the seventh obstacle, the seventh untimely condition for one who [intends to] practice the holy life.^392

Again, at the time when a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awak ened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a well-gone one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassable person, leader on the path of Dharma, teacher of deva s and human beings, called a buddha, an exalted one, has not appeared in the world and does not teach the Dharma that leads to calmness, leads to complete cessation, leads to the path of awakening expounded by the Well-gone One—at that time this person is reborn in the Middle Kingdom, he is not deaf and not dumb like a bleating sheep, does not communicate only through sign language, is able to understand whether the meaning of what is said is good or evil, and is equipped with right views, not perverted views, holding views and doctrines such as these: there is [merit in] giving, offering, and recitation of charms; there is [a distinction between] wholesome and unwholesome actions; there are results of wholesome and unwholesome actions; there is this life and the next life; there is [responsibility toward one’s] mother or father; in this world there are arahants who have reached a good attainment, who are well gone, well advanced, who have personally realized this world and the next world through understanding, awakening, and realization. This is the eighth obstacle, the eighth untimely condition for one who [intends to] practice the holy life. For one who [intends to] practice the holy life, there is [one occasion] that is without obstacle, that is the timely condition. What is the [one occa sion] for one who [intends to] practice the holy life that is without obstacle and is the timely condition? At the time when a tathāgata, free from attach ment, fully awakened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a well gone one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassable person, leader on the path of Dharma, teacher of deva s and human beings, called a buddha, an exalted one, has appeared in the world and teaches the Dharma that leads to calmness, leads to complete cessation, leads to the path of awakening expounded by the Well-gone One—at that time this person is reborn in the Middle Kingdom, he is not deaf and not dumb like a bleating sheep, does not only communicate through sign language, is able to understand whether the meaning of what is said is good or evil, and is equipped with right view, not perverted views, holding such views and doctrines as these: there is [merit in] giving, offerings, and the recitation of charms; there is

[a distinction between] wholesome and unwholesome actions; there is a result of wholesome and unwholesome actions; there is this life and the next life; there is [responsibility toward one’s] mother or father; in this world there are arahants who have reached a good attainment, who are well gone, well advanced, who have personally realized this world and the next world through understanding, awakening, and realization. This is [the one occasion] for one who [intends to] practice the holy life that is without obstacle, that is a timely condition.

Then the World-honored One uttered these verses:

If one has obtained a human body And the most sublime Dharma is being taught, Yet he does not attain any fruit, Then this is certainly because he did not encounter the [right] time for it.

Many obstacles to [practicing] the holy life have been taught. For a person to encounter The [right] time in the next life Is very rare in the world.

If one wishes to obtain a human body again And to hear the sublime Dharma, Then one should practice diligently, Out of concern for oneself.

As for talking about and hearing the good Dharma, Do not miss the [right] time for it. If [one] misses this [right] time, One should certainly worry about falling into hell.

If one does not encounter the [right] time, And does not hear the good Dharma taught, Then [one is] like a merchant who loses his wealth; One will endure countless births and deaths.

If one obtains a human body, Hears the right and good Dharma being taught,

And respectfully follows the teaching of the World-honored One, Then one must have encountered the [right] time for it. If one encounters this [right] time, And is able to practice the right holy life, Then one will achieve the unsurpassable vision, Taught by the Kinsman of the Sun. Such a person constantly guards himself, And practices in abandoning the latent tendencies. By removing and extinguishing all fetters, And by defeating the Evil One [Māra] and the Evil One’s retinue, He transcends the world; That is, he achieves the cessation of the taints. Thus spoke the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
