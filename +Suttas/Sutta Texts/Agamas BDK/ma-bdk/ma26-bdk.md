### 26. The Discourse to Gulissāni

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. At that time, the monk Gulissāni was also staying at Rājagaha. Living in a forest dwelling,^104 Gulissāni [was given to] joking frivolously and bragging about himself. Acting in a restless and agitated manner, he was lacking in mindfulness, and his mind was like a monkey. For some small matter, the monk Gulissāni had gone to Rājagaha. At that time, at midday after having taken their meal, Venerable Sāriputta and an assembly of monks had congregated in the assembly hall over some small matter. Having settled what he had to do at Rājagaha, the monk Gulissāni also went toward the assembly hall. Seeing Gulissāni approaching in the distance, Venerable Sāriputta spoke to the [assembled] monks in relation to Gulissāni:

Venerable friends, a forest-dwelling monk, when practicing forest dwelling, should train in being respectful and compliant.
