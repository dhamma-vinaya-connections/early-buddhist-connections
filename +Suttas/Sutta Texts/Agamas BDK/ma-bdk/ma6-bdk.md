### 6. The Discourse on the Destination of a Good Person

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks:

I shall teach you about the seven destinations of good persons and about nirvana without remainder. Listen closely, listen closely and pay careful attention! The monks listened to receive instruction. The Buddha said: What are the seven? A monk practices thus: There is no self, nor is there anything belonging to a self; in the future there will be no self and nothing belonging to a self. What has already come to exist will be abandoned; when it has been abandoned, equanimity will be attained; [I shall be] neither defiled by delight in existence nor attached to contact [through the senses]. Such a practitioner sees the unsurpassable state of peace^57 through his wisdom, but has not yet attained [final] realization. Practicing thus, to which destination will such a monk go? It is just like a burning wheat husk which, having caught fire, quickly exhausts itself. You should know that this monk is like that. Having cut off the five lower fetters, but with a remnant of conceit not yet extinguished, he attains final nirvana [immediately after entering] the intermediate state of existence. This is the first destination of good persons, who are indeed to be found in the world. Again, a monk practices thus: There is no self, nor is there anything belonging to a self; in the future there will be no self and nothing belonging to a self. What has already come to exist will be abandoned; and when it has been abandoned, equanimity will be attained. [I shall be] neither defiled by delight in existence nor attached to contact [through the senses]. Such a practitioner sees the unsurpassable state of peace through his wisdom, but has not yet attained [final] realization. Practicing thus, to which destination will such a monk go? It is just as when [a slab of] iron that is all ablaze, intensely hot, is hit with a hammer, a burning splinter flies up into the air, but on moving upward, becomes extinguished immediately. You should know

that this monk is like that. Having cut off the five lower fetters, but with a remnant of conceit not yet extinguished, he attains final nirvana [after a short while spent in] the intermediate state of existence. This is the second destination of good persons, really to be found in the world. Again, a monk practices thus: There is no self, nor is there anything belonging to a self; in the future there will be no self and nothing belonging to a self. What has already come to exist will be abandoned; and when it has been abandoned, equanimity will be attained. [I shall be] neither defiled by delight in existence nor attached to contact [through the senses].

Such a practitioner sees the unsurpassable state of peace through his wisdom, but has not yet attained [final] realization. Practicing thus, to which destination will such a monk go? It is just as when [a slab of] iron that is all ablaze, intensely hot, is hit with a hammer, a burning splinter flies up into the air, which, having moved upward comes back down, but becomes extinguished before hitting the ground. You should know that this monk is like that. Having cut off the five lower fetters, but with a remnant of conceit not yet extinguished, he attains final nirvana [after spending some time in] the intermediate state of existence. This is the third destination of good persons, really to be found in the world. Again, a monk practices thus: There is no self, nor is there anything belonging to a self; in the future there will be no self and nothing belonging to a self. What has already come to exist will be abandoned; and when it has been abandoned, equanimity will be attained. [I shall be] neither defiled by delight in existence nor attached to contact [through the senses].

Such a practitioner sees the unsurpassable state of peace through his wisdom, but has not yet attained [final] realization. Practicing thus, to which destination will such a monk go? It is just as when [a slab of] iron that is all ablaze, intensely hot, is hit with a hammer, a burning splinter flies up into the air, and becomes

extinguished on hitting the ground. You should know that this monk is like that. Having cut off the five lower fetters, but with a remnant of conceit not yet extinguished, he attains final nirvana in his next exis tence. This is the fourth destination of good persons, really to be found in the world. Again, a monk practices thus: There is no self, nor is there anything belonging to a self; in the future there will be no self and nothing belonging to a self. What has already come to exist will be abandoned; and when it has been abandoned, equanimity will be attained. [I shall be] neither defiled by delight in existence nor attached to contact [through the senses]. Such a practitioner sees the unsurpassable state of peace through his wisdom, but has not yet attained [final] realization. Practicing thus, to which destination will such a monk go?It is just as when [a slab of] iron that is all ablaze, intensely hot, is hit with a hammer, a burning splinter flies up into the air and then falls on a small amount of sticks and grass, causing it to smoke and burn, and becomes extinguished after that has burned out. You should know that this monk is like that. Having cut off the five lower fetters, but with a remnant of conceit not yet extinguished, he attains final nirvana with effort. This is the fifth destination of good persons, really to be found in the world. Again, a monk practices thus: There is no self, nor is there anything belonging to a self; in the future there will be no self and nothing belonging to a self. What has already come to exist will be abandoned; and when it has been abandoned, equanimity will be attained. [I shall be] neither defiled by delight in existence nor attached to contact [through the senses]. Such a practitioner sees the unsurpassable state of peace through his wisdom, but has not yet attained [final] realization. Practicing thus, to which destination will such a monk go?It is just as when [a slab of] iron that is all ablaze, intensely hot, is hit with a hammer, a burning splinter flies up into the air and then falls on a large amount of sticks and grass, causing it to smoke and burn, and becomes extinguished

after that has burned out. You should know that this monk is like that. Having cut off the five lower fetters, but with a remnant of conceit not yet extinguished, he attains final nirvana without effort. This is the sixth destination of good persons. Such people are really to be found in the world. Again, a monk practices thus: There is no self, nor is there anything belonging to a self; in the future there will be no self and nothing belonging to a self. What has already come to exist will be abandoned; and when it has been abandoned, equanimity will be attained. [I shall be] neither defiled by delight in existence nor attached to contact [through the senses].

Such a practitioner sees the unsurpassable state of peace through his wisdom, but has not yet attained [final] realization. Practicing thus, to which destination will such a monk go? It is just as when [a slab of] iron that is all ablaze, intensely hot, is hit with a hammer, a burning splinter flies up into the air and falls on to a large amount of sticks and grass, causing it to smoke and burn; and after that has burned, the fire spreads to villages, towns, mountain forests, and wilderness; and having burned out the villages, towns, mountain forests, and wilderness, it reaches a road, or reaches water, or reaches level ground, and becomes extinguished. You should know that this monk is like that. Having cut off the five lower fetters, but with a remnant of conceit not yet extinguished, he [first] goes upstream [all the way] to the Akaniṭṭha realm where he attains final nirvana. This is the seventh destination of good persons, really to be found in the world. What is nirvana without remainder? A monk practices thus: There is no self, nor is there anything belonging to a self; in the future there will be no self and nothing belonging to a self. What has already come to exist will be abandoned; and when it has been abandoned, equanimity will be attained. [I shall be] neither defiled by delight in existence nor attached to contact [through the senses].

Such a practitioner sees the unsurpassable state of peace through his wisdom. Having attained [final] realization, I say, that monk will not

go to the east, nor to the west, nor to the south, nor to the north, nor to [any of] the four intermediate directions, nor above, nor below, but will attain the state of peace, final nirvana, right here and now.When I said earlier, “I shall teach you about the seven destinations of good persons and about nirvana without remainder,” it was on account of this that I said it. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
