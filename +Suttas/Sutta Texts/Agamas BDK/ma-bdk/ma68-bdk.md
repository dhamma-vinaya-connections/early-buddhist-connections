### 68. The Discourse on Mahāsudassana

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Kusinārā, staying in the Sāla Grove of the Mallas at Upavattana. At that time the World-honored One, who was about to attain final nir vana, said:

Ānanda, go to the twin _sāla_ trees and prepare a bed for the Tathāgata between the trees with its head toward the north. The Tathāgata will attain final nirvana at midnight. Following the Tathāgata’s instruction, Venerable Ānanda went to the twin trees and prepared a bed for the Tathāgata, between the twin trees with its head toward the north. Having prepared the bed, he returned to where the Buddha was. After making obeisance with his head at the Buddha’s feet, he stood to one side and said:

World-honored One, I have prepared a bed for the Tathāgata between the twin trees with its head toward the north. May the World-honored One know the [right] time! Then the World-honored One, together with Venerable Ānanda, approached the place between the twin trees. He folded his outer robe in four and placed it on the bed, folded the inner robe to use as a pillow, and lay down on his right side, one foot on the other, ready to attain final nirvana. At that time Venerable Ānanda, holding a fly whisk, was attending on the Buddha. Venerable Ānanda placed his palms together [in respect] toward the Buddha and said:

World-honored One, there are also great cities, such as Campā, Sāvatthī, Vesālī, Rājagaha, Benares, and Kapilavatthu. Rather than attaining final nirvana in [one of] these cities, why is the World-honored One [attaining final nirvana] in this small mud-built town, this lowliest of all towns? Then the World-honored One said: Ānanda, do not call this “a small mud-built town, the lowliest of all towns.” Why is that? In the past, this Kusinārā was called “the royal city of Kusinārā.” It was extremely rich and pleasant, with many inhab itants. Ānanda, the royal city of Kusinārā was twelve leagues long and seven leagues wide. Ānanda, the watchtowers that had been set up were as tall as a man, or two, three, four, or even seven times a man’s height. Ānanda, the royal city of Kusinārā was surrounded on all sides by seven moats, which were built of four precious materials: gold, silver,

beryl, and crystal. The bottom of each moat was covered with sand of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. Ānanda, the royal city of Kusinārā was surrounded on all sides by seven walls, which were also built out of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. Ānanda, the royal city of Kusinārā was surrounded by seven rows of palm trees made of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden palm trees had silver leaves, flowers, and fruits. The silver palm trees had golden leaves, flowers, and fruits. The beryl palm trees had crystal leaves, flowers, and fruits. The crystal palm trees had beryl leaves, flowers, and fruits. Ānanda, between the palm trees were ponds with various flowers: ponds with blue lotuses, ponds with pink lotuses, ponds with red lotuses, and ponds with white lotuses. Ānanda, the banks of those lotus ponds were built of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The bottom of each pond was covered with sand of four precious mate rials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. Ānanda, the ponds were equipped with staircases made of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden staircases had silver stairs. The silver staircases had golden stairs. The beryl staircases had crystal stairs. The crystal staircases had beryl stairs. Ānanda, the ponds were surrounded by railings made of four pre cious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden railings had silver fittings. The silver railings had golden fittings. The beryl railings had crystal fittings. The crystal railings had beryl fittings. Ānanda, the ponds were draped with canopies, from which hung bells made of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden bells had silver clappers. The silver bells had golden clap pers. The beryl bells had crystal clappers. The crystal bells had beryl clappers. Ānanda, in those ponds grew various water flowers: blue lotuses, pink lotuses, red lotuses, and white lotuses. Water and flowers were always there, under no guard, and accessible to everyone. Ānanda, on the banks of the ponds grew various terrestrial flowers: jasmine, great-flowered-jasmine, campaka, white water lily, honey tree, pearl bush, and trumpet flower.^175

Ānanda, on the banks of the lotus ponds were a multitude of women, with lustrous bodies, splendid and pure, with a beauty sur- passing that of human beings, almost like goddesses. Their appearance was graceful, and pleasing to whoever saw them. They were sumptu- ously adorned with many strings of gems. They practiced charity accord- ing to what the people needed, providing food and drink, clothes and bedding, vehicles, dwellings, mattresses, woolen blankets, servants, and lamps—all of this they gave away. Ānanda, the leaves of the palm trees, when stirred by the wind, produced sounds of the most marvelous kind of music. Just like the five kinds of music produced by skillful musicians,^176 marvelous and harmonious sounds, Ānanda, such [was the sound of] the leaves of the palm trees when stirred by the wind. Ānanda, in the city of Kusinārā, if low-class libertines desired to hear the five kinds of music, they would go together to the palm trees, all indulging and enjoying them- selves to the full. Ānanda, the royal city of Kusinārā was never free of twelve sounds: the sound of elephants, the sound of horses, the sound of carriages, the sound of footsteps, the sound of conchs being blown, the sound of drums, the sound of kettledrums, the sound of side drums, the sound of singing, the sound of dancing, the sound of eating and drinking, and the sound of charitable giving. Ānanda, in the city of Kusinārā lived a king named Mahā sudassana, a wheel-turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world, freely, as he liked. As a righteous Dharma king he possessed the seven treasures and had acquired the four kinds of success. What are the seven treasures that King Mahāsudassana possessed and the four kinds of success that he had acquired?... (as described above)— these were the seven treasures and the four kinds of success. Then, Ānanda, brahmins and householders in the royal city of Kusinārā took many jewels and precious fabrics and went to King Mahāsudassana, saying, “Your majesty, here are many jewels and pre- cious fabrics. May your majesty accept them out of compassion!” King Mahāsudassana told the brahmins and householders, “I do not really

need what you are offering, as I already have [enough of] such things myself.” Again, Ānanda, the kings of eighty-four thousand small countries approached King Mahāsudassana, saying, “Your majesty, we wish to build a palace for you.” King Mahāsudassana told these minor kings, “You wish to build a palace for me, but I do not need it, as I already have one.” The kings of the eighty-four thousand small countries all lifted their hands, placed their palms together [in respect] toward [the king] and said a second and a third time, “Your majesty, we wish to build a palace for you. We wish to build a palace for you.” Thereupon, King Mahāsudassana consented by remaining silent for the sake of the eighty-four thousand minor kings. Then the kings of the eighty-four thousand small countries, understanding that King Mahāsudassana had consented by remaining silent, paid homage to take leave of him, circumambulated him three times, and departed. Returning to their respective countries, they loaded eighty-four thousand carriages with their own weight in gold, coin, and wrought and unwrought treasures, and jeweled pillars, and transported them to the city of Kusinārā. They built a great palace not far away from the city. Ānanda, the great palace was one league long and one league wide. Ānanda, the great palace was built of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. Ānanda, the great palace was equipped with staircases made of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crys tal. The golden staircases had silver stairs. The silver staircases had golden stairs. The beryl staircases had crystal stairs. The crystal stair cases had beryl stairs. Ānanda, in the great palace there were eighty-four thousand pillars made of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden pillars had silver capitals and bases. The silver pillars had golden capitals and bases. The beryl pillars had crystal capitals and bases. The crystal pillars had beryl capitals and bases. Ānanda, in the great palace stood eighty-four thousand buildings made of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden buildings had silver coverings. The silver buildings had golden

coverings. The beryl buildings had crystal coverings. The crystal build- ings had beryl coverings. Ānanda, the great palace was furnished with eighty-four thousand thrones, which were also made of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden buildings were furnished with silver thrones, which were covered with woolen blankets, draped with bro- cades and fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted coverlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends. Likewise, the silver buildings were furnished with golden thrones.... The beryl buildings were furnished with crystal thrones.... The crystal buildings were furnished with beryl thrones, which were covered with woolen blankets, draped with brocades and fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted coverlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends. Ānanda, the great palace was surrounded by railings made of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden railings had silver fittings. The silver railings had golden fittings. The beryl railings had crystal fittings. The crystal railings had beryl fittings. Ānanda, the great palace was draped with canopies, from which hung bells made of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden bells had silver clappers. The silver bells had golden clap- pers. The beryl bells had crystal clappers. The crystal bells had beryl clappers. Ānanda, when the great palace had been completed, the kings of the eighty-four thousand small countries built a great flower pond not far from the palace. Ānanda, the great flower pond was one league long and one league wide. Ānanda, the great flower pond was built of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. Its bottom was covered with sand of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. Ānanda, the great flower pond was equipped with staircases made of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden staircases had silver stairs. The silver staircases had golden stairs. The beryl staircases had crystal stairs. The crystal staircases had beryl stairs. Ānanda, the great flower pond was surrounded by railings made of

four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden rail ings had silver fittings. The silver railings had golden fittings. The beryl railings had crystal fittings. The crystal railings had beryl fittings. Ānanda, the great flower pond was draped with canopies, from which hung bells made of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden bells had silver clappers. The silver bells had golden clappers. The beryl bells had crystal clappers. The crystal bells had beryl clappers. Ānanda, in the great flower pond grew various water flowers: blue lotuses, pink lotuses, red lotuses, and white lotuses. Water and flowers were always there, [but] were guarded and not acces sible to everyone. Ānanda, on the banks of the great flower pond grew various ter restrial flowers: jasmine, great-flowered jasmine, campaka, white water lily, honey tree, pearl bush, and trumpet flower. Then, Ānanda, when the great palace and the great flower pond had been completed, the kings of the eighty-four thousand small countries built a grove of palm trees, not far from the palace. Ānanda, the grove of palm trees was one league long and one league wide. Ānanda, in the grove of palm trees there were eighty-four thousand palm trees made of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden palm trees had silver leaves, flowers, and fruits. The silver palm trees had golden leaves, flowers, and fruits. The beryl palm trees had crystal leaves, flowers, and fruits. The crystal palm trees had beryl leaves, flowers, and fruits. Ānanda, the grove of palm trees was surrounded by railings made of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden railings had silver fittings. The silver railings had golden fittings. The beryl railings had crystal fittings. The crystal railings had beryl fittings. Ānanda, the grove of palm trees was draped with canopies, from which hung bells made of four precious materials: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden bells had silver clappers. The silver bells had golden clappers. The beryl bells had crystal clappers. The crystal bells had beryl clappers. Ānanda, when the great palace, the flower pond, and the grove of palm trees had been completed in this way, the kings of the eighty-four

thousand small countries went together to King Mahāsudassana and said:

May your majesty know that the great palace, the flower pond, and the grove of palm trees have all been completed! They are at your majesty’s disposal.

Then, Ānanda, King Mahāsudassana thought:

I should not be the first to ascend to this great palace. There are most highly regarded renunciants and brahmins living in this royal city of Kusinārā. Let me invite them all to sit together in this great palace. I will have delicious, wonderful, delicate food prepared, various rich food to eat, savor and digest, and serve it with my own hands, making sure everybody will eat his fill. After the meal is finished, the utensils have been cleared away, and water for washing has been offered, they will be dismissed and allowed to return.

Ānanda, having thought thus, King Mahāsudassana invited all of the most highly regarded renunciants and brahmins living in that royal city of Kusinārā to ascend to the great palace. Having had them seated, [the king] himself brought water for washing. Then delicious, wonderful, delicate food was brought. And with his own hands he served the various rich food to eat, savor and digest, making sure everybody ate his fill. After the meal was finished, the utensils had been cleared away, and water for washing had been offered, [the king], having received a blessing, dismissed them and allowed them to return. Ānanda, again King Mahāsudassana thought: It would not be proper for me to engage in sensual pleasures in the great palace. Let me rather take a single attendant and ascend to the great palace and reside there.

Ānanda, King Mahāsudassana therefore took a single attendant and ascended to the great palace. Then he entered a golden building and sat on a silver royal couch, which was covered with woolen blankets, draped with brocades and fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted cov- erlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends. After

sitting down, separated from desires, separated from evil and unwhole some states, he dwelled having attained the first absorption, which is accompanied by initial and sustained application of mind, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. He came out of the golden building and entered a silver building. He sat on a golden royal couch, which was covered with woolen blan kets, draped with brocades and fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted coverlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends. After sitting down, separated from desires, separated from evil and unwholesome states, he dwelled having attained the first absorption, which is accompanied by initial and sustained application of mind, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. He came out of the silver building and entered a beryl building. He sat on a crystal royal couch, which was covered with woolen blan kets, draped with brocades and fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted coverlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends. After sitting down, separated from desires, separated from evil and unwholesome states, he dwelled having attained the first absorption, which is accompanied by initial and sustained application of mind, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. He came out of the beryl building and entered a crystal building. He sat on a beryl royal couch, which was covered with woolen blankets, draped with brocades and fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted cov erlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends. After sitting down, separated from desire, separated from evil and unwhole some states, he dwelled having attained the first absorption, which is accompanied by initial and sustained application of mind, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. At that time, Ānanda, the eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure had not seen King Mahāsudassana for a long time, and were keen and eager to see him. Therefore, his eighty-four thousand wives approached the woman treasure and said: Your majesty, may you know that we have not had an audience with the great king for a long time. Your majesty, we now wish to [go and] see the great king together.

Having heard that, the woman treasure told the counselor treasure, “May you know that we have not had an audience with the great king for a long time. We now wish to go and see him.” On hearing this, the counselor treasure accompanied the [king’s] eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure to the great palace. They were also escorted by eighty-four thousand elephants, eighty- four thousand horses, eighty-four thousand chariots, eighty-four thou- sand infantry troops, and eighty-four thousand minor kings. As they approached, they produced a tremendous noise, reverberating [all around]. King Mahāsudassana heard the tremendous noise, reverberating [all around]. Hearing it, he asked the attendant at his side, “Who is making that tremendous noise, reverberating [all around]?” The attendant said: Your majesty, it is being made by your eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure, who are all coming to the great palace; the eighty-four thousand elephants, eighty-four thousand horses, eighty-four thousand chariots, eighty-four thousand infantry troops, and eighty-four thousand minor kings are also coming together to the great palace; consequently there is this tremendous noise, reverberating [all around].

On hearing this, King Mahāsudassana told the attendant, “Descend from the palace immediately and promptly prepare a golden couch out of doors. Return and tell me when this is finished.” Following these instructions, the attendant descended from the palace and promptly prepared a golden couch out of doors. When he had finished, he returned and said, “I have finished preparing a golden couch out of doors for your majesty. It is at your majesty’s disposal.” Then, Ānanda, King Mahāsudassana, accompanied by the attendant, descended from the palace and sat down cross-legged on the golden couch. Then, Ānanda, King Mahāsudassana’s eighty-four thousand wives and the woman-treasure all advanced toward him. Ānanda, King Mahā- sudassana saw his eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure in the distance. Having seen them, he swiftly restrained his senses.

Then, having noticed that the king had restrained his senses, his eighty four thousand wives and the woman treasure thought, “His majesty must have no need of us. Why is that? His majesty restrained his senses as soon as he saw us.” Thereupon, Ānanda, the woman treasure approached King Mahā sudassana. Having arrived, she said: May your majesty know that these eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure all belong to your majesty! May your majesty be always attentive to us, until death! The eighty-four thousand elephants, eighty-four thousand horses, eighty-four thou sand chariots, eighty-four thousand infantry troops, and eighty four thousand minor kings all belong to your majesty. May your majesty be always attentive to us, until death! Then, having heard those words, King Mahāsudassana told the woman treasure: Sister, all of you have long encouraged me into evil ways and not into the way of practicing loving-kindness. Sister, from now on you should all encourage me into the way of practicing loving kindness and not into evil ways. Ānanda, the eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure stood to one side, weeping and crying with grief, and said, “We are not his majesty’s sisters, yet now he calls us sisters.” Ānanda, those eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure each wiped away their tears with their clothes. They approached nearer to King Mahāsudassana. Having arrived there, they said, “Your majesty, how should we encourage you into the way of practicing loving-kind ness and not into evil ways?” King Mahāsudassana answered: Sisters, for my sake you should say this: Did your majesty know that a human being has a very short life span and will soon pass on to the next life? One should practice the holy life, because whatever is born is bound to end.

May your majesty know this: there will surely come the phe nomenon which is neither desirable nor agreeable and which destroys everything in the world, namely death. Therefore, if your majesty has any longing or desire for the eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure, may your majesty completely abandon and renounce it, and never have such longing, until death! If your majesty has any longing or desire for the eighty-four thousand elephants, eighty-four thou sand horses, eighty-four thousand chariots, eighty-four thousand infantry troops, and eighty-four thousand minor kings, may your majesty completely abandon and renounce it, and never have such longing, until death! Thus, sisters, should you encourage me to practice loving-kindness and not cause [me] to do evil.

Ānanda, those eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure said:

Your majesty, from now on we will encourage you to practice lov ing-kindness and not cause you to do evil. Your majesty, a human being has a very short life span and will soon pass on to the next life. There will surely come the phenomenon which is neither desirable nor agreeable and which destroys everything in the world, namely death. Therefore, if your majesty has any longing or desire for the eighty-four thousand wives and the woman-treasure, may your majesty completely abandon and renounce it, and never have such longing, until death! If your majesty has any longing or desire for the eighty-four thousand elephants, eighty-four thousand horses, eighty-four thousand chariots, eighty-four thousand infantry troops, and eighty-four thousand minor kings, may your majesty com pletely abandon and renounce it, and never have such longing until death!

Ānanda, King Mahāsudassana taught the Dharma to his eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure, exhorting, encouraging, and

delighting them. Having with countless skillful means taught them the Dharma, having exhorted, encouraged, and delighted them, he dismissed them and allowed them to return. Ānanda, understanding that King Mahāsudassana had dismissed them, his eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure each paid homage to him and returned. Ānanda, not long after his eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure had left, King Mahāsudassana ascended to the great palace together with his attendant. Then he entered a golden building and sat on a silver royal couch, which was covered with woolen blan kets, draped with brocades and fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted coverlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends. Having sat down, he contemplated thus: I am putting an end to thoughts of desire, thoughts of anger, thoughts of malice, strife, hatred, flattery, hypocrisy, deceit, and false speech. These countless evil and unwholesome states shall come to an end. He [then] abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lov ing-kindness, likewise the second, the third, and the fourth quarters, the four intermediate directions, above and below, encompassing all. Free from fetters or resentment, without ill will or quarrel, he dwelled pervading the entire world [with a mind that was] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well cultivated. He came out of the golden building and in turn entered a silver building. He sat on a golden royal couch, which was covered with woolen blankets, draped with brocades and fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted coverlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends. Having sat down, he contemplated thus: I am putting an end to thoughts of desire, thoughts of anger, thoughts of malice, strife, hatred, flattery, hypocrisy, deceit, and false speech. These countless evil and unwholesome states shall come to an end. He [then] abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with com passion, likewise the second, the third, and the fourth quarters, the four

intermediate directions, above and below, encompassing all. Free from fetters or resentment, without ill will or quarrel, he abided pervading the entire world [with a mind that was] boundless, exalted, immeas- urable, and well cultivated. He came out of the silver building and entered a beryl building. He sat on a crystal royal couch, which was covered with woolen blan- kets, draped with brocades and fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted coverlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends. Having sat down, he contemplated thus:

I am putting an end to thoughts of desire, thoughts of anger, thoughts of malice, strife, hatred, flattery, hypocrisy, deceit, and false speech. These countless evil and unwholesome states shall come to an end.

He [then] abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with empathic joy, likewise the second, the third, and the fourth quarters, the four intermediate directions, above and below, encompassing all. Free from fetters or resentment, without ill will or quarrel, he abided pervading the entire world [with a mind that was] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well cultivated. He came out of the beryl building and entered a crystal building. He sat on a beryl royal couch, which was covered with woolen blankets, draped with brocades and fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted cov- erlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends. Having sat down, he contemplated thus:

I am putting an end to thoughts of desire, thoughts of anger, thoughts of malice, strife, hatred, flattery, hypocrisy, deceit, and false speech. These countless evil and unwholesome states shall come to an end.

He [then] abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with equa- nimity, likewise the second, the third, and the fourth quarters, the four intermediate directions, above and below, encompassing all. Free from fetters or resentment, without ill will or quarrel, he abided pervading

the entire world [with a mind that was] boundless, exalted, immeas urable, and well cultivated. Ānanda, [only] a slight death pain arose in King Mahāsudassana in his last moments. Just as a slight affliction may arise in a householder or a householder’s son after eating marvelous food, so only a slight death pain arose in King Mahāsudassana in his last moments. Ānanda, at that time King Mahāsudassana, having practiced the four divine abodes and having abandoned longing and desire, passed on and, after death, was reborn in a Brahmā world. Ānanda, do you consider King Mahāsudassana on that former occasion to be someone other [than me]? Do not think thus. You should know that he was me. Ānanda, at that time I benefited myself, benefited others, and ben efited many people. I had compassion for the whole world and I sought prosperity, benefit, peace, and happiness for gods and human beings. The teaching I gave at that time did not lead to the ultimate, was not the ultimate purity, not the ultimate holy life, not the ultimate completion of the holy life. Not having fulfilled the holy life, I did not at that time become free from birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and distress, and I was not able to attain liberation from all suffering. Ānanda, I have now appeared in this world as a Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a Well gone One, a knower of the world, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and human beings, a buddha, a Fortunate One. I now benefit myself, benefit others, benefit many people. I have compassion for the whole world, and I seek prosperity, benefit, peace, and happiness for gods and human beings. My teaching of the Dharma has now reached fulfillment, I have fulfilled my purification, fulfilled the holy life. Having fulfilled the holy life, I am now free from birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and distress. I have now attained lib eration from all suffering. Ānanda, at Kusinārā, in the Sāla Grove of the Mallas at Upavattana, by the Nerañjarā River, by the Vaggumudā River, at the Makuṭaband hana shrine, at the spot where a couch has been prepared for me— within these places I will have discarded the body seven times: six

times as a wheel-turning monarch, and now on the seventh [occasion] as a Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened. Ānanda, I see no place in this world with its gods, Māras, Brahmās, renunciants, and brahmins, from gods to humans, where I will discard the body again. That is not possible [anymore], Ānanda. This is my final birth, my final existence, my final body, my final form, this is the end of me. I say: “This is the end of suffering.” This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, Ven- erable Ānanda and the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
