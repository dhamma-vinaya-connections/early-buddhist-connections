### 49. The [First] Discourse on Respect

Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: A monk should practice respect and be considerate and courteous to his companions in the holy life. If he does not practice respect and is not considerate and courteous to his companions in the holy life, then it is impossible to fulfill even the most basic rules of proper conduct. If the basic rules of proper conduct are not fulfilled, then it is impossible to fulfill the rules for a learner. If the rules for a learner are not fulfilled, it is impossible to fulfill the [practices that are part of the] precept group.^143 If the precept group is not fulfilled, it is impossible to fulfill the [practices that are part of the] concentration group. If the concen- tration group is not fulfilled, it is impossible to fulfill the [practices

that are part of the] wisdom group. If the wisdom group is not fulfilled, it is impossible to fulfill the [practices that are part of the] liberation group. If the liberation group is not fulfilled, it is impossible to fulfill the [practices that are part of the] knowledge and vision of liberation group. If the knowledge and vision of liberation group is not fulfilled, it is impossible to attain nirvana. If, [however,] a monk practices respect and is considerate and courteous to his companions in the holy life, it is possible to fulfill the basic rules of proper conduct. If the basic rules of proper conduct are fulfilled, it is possible to fulfill the rules for a learner. If the rules for a learner are fulfilled, it is possible to fulfill the precept group. If the pre- cept group is fulfilled, it is possible to fulfill the concentration group. If the concentration group is fulfilled, it is possible to fulfill the wisdom group. If the wisdom group is fulfilled, it is possible to fulfill the liber- ation group. If the liberation group is fulfilled, it is possible to fulfill the knowledge and vision of liberation group. If the knowledge and vision of liberation group is fulfilled, it is possible to attain nirvana. This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.
