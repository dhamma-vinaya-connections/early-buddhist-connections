### 154. The Discourse to Vāseṭṭha at the Hall [of Migāra's Mother]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in the Eastern Park, in the Hall of Migāra’s Mother. At that time there were two members of the brahmin class, Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja, who had shaved off their hair and beards, donned the yellow robes, and out of faith left the household life and become homeless to train in the path.^231 Any brahmins who saw them rebuked them severely and with much bitterness, saying: Brahmins are the highest class; others are not equal to it. The brahmin class is white; all others are black. Brahmins attain purity; nonbrahmins do not attain purity. Brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth; brahmins were created by Brahmā. You have given up what is superior to follow what is not equal to it. You have given up what is white to follow what is black. Those bald-pated renunciants are bound by [their own] darkness, their lineage is severed since they are without sons. There fore, what you have done is a great evil, the ultimate crime, a great fault.^232

At that time the World-honored One, having risen from sitting in medi- tation, had come down from the hall in the afternoon and was walking back and forth in the open, in the shade of the hall, teaching the monks the profound and sublime Dharma. Venerable Vāseṭṭha saw from afar that the World-hon- ored One, having risen from sitting in meditation, had come down from the hall in the afternoon and was walking back and forth in the open in the shade of the hall, teaching the monks the profound and sublime Dharma. Seeing this, Venerable Vāseṭṭha said: Venerable Bhāradvāja, you should know that the World-honored One, having risen from sitting in meditation, has come down from the hall in the afternoon and is walking back and forth in the open in the shade of the hall, teaching the monks the profound and sublime Dharma. Venerable Bhāradvāja, let us together approach the Buddha. Perhaps we will thereby be able to hear the Dharma from the Buddha. Then Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja approached the Buddha, paid homage by bowing their heads [to his feet], and followed him, walking back and forth. The World-honored One turned around and said to the two: Vāseṭṭha, you two are brahmins who have left the brahmin class, shaved off hair and beards, donned the yellow robes, and out of faith left the household life and became homeless to train in the path. On seeing this, do the brahmins not greatly rebuke you? [Vāseṭṭha] replied, “Indeed, World-honored One, on seeing this, the brah- mins severely scold and rebuke us with much bitterness.” The World-honored One asked, “Vāseṭṭha, how do the brahmins, on seeing this, severely scold and rebuke you with much bitterness?” [Vāseṭṭha] replied: World-honored One, on seeing us, the brahmins say, “Brahmins are the highest class; the others are not equal to it. The brahmin class is white; all the others are black. Brahmins attain purity; nonbrahmins do not attain purity. Brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth; brahmins were created by Brahmā. You have given up what is superior to follow what is not equal to it. You have given up the white to follow the black.

Those bald-pated renunciants are bound by [their own] darkness. Their lineage is severed, since they are without sons. Therefore, what you have done is a great evil, the ultimate crime, a great fault.” World-honored One, on seeing us, this is how the brahmins severely scold and rebuke us with much bitterness. The World-honored One said: Vāseṭṭha, what those brahmins say is most evil, extremely troublesome,^233 and lacking foundation. Why is that? It is because they are foolish, have poor understanding, do not recognize a fertile field [of merit], and cannot know for themselves, that they say,^234 “We brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth. We brahmins were created by Brahmā.” Why is that? Vāseṭṭha, regarding this unsurpassable knowledge and conduct that I have realized, I do not talk about superiority based on birth, I do not talk about lineage, I do not talk about matters of pride, about someone being to my liking or not to my liking because of status or because of [ritual purification by] water, or [because of] the sacred texts they study.^235 Vāseṭṭha, if people are getting married, they ought to talk about their birth, they ought to talk about their lineage, they ought to talk about matters of pride, about someone being to their liking or not to their liking because of status or because of [ritual purification by] water, or [because of] the sacred texts they study. Vāseṭṭha, if someone values birth, values lineage, values matters of pride, then [this person] is very far from the unsurpassable knowledge and conduct that I have realized. Vāseṭṭha, one who talks about birth, talks about lineage, talks about matters of pride, about someone being to their liking or not to their liking because of status or because of [ritual purifi cation by] water, or [because of] the sacred texts they study, is separated from the supreme knowledge and conduct that I have realized. Again, Vāseṭṭha, as for the three classes, they do not make all people quarrel with one another about their various wholesome and unwholesome qualities. They are praised or not praised by noble ones. What are the three? The warrior class, the brahmin class, and the mer chant class.^236 Vāseṭṭha, what do you think? Is it that a warrior kills living

beings, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsehood... up to... has wrong view, and a merchant does the same but a brahmin does not?

[Vāseṭṭha] replied:

World-honored One, a warrior may kill living beings, take what is not given, engage in sexual misconduct, speak falsehood... up to... have wrong view; and so too may a brahmin or a merchant.

The World-honored One asked:

Vāseṭṭha, what do you think? Is it that a brahmin abstains from killing, having abandoned killing... taking what is not given... engaging in sexual misconduct... speaking falsehood... up to... abstaining from wrong view having gained right view; but a warrior or a merchant does not?

[Vāseṭṭha] replied:

World-honored One, a brahmin may abstain from killing, having abandoned killing... taking what is not given... engaging in sexual misconduct... speaking falsehood... up to... abstaining from wrong view having gained right view; and so too may a warrior or a merchant.

The World-honored One asked:

Vāseṭṭha, what do you think? Are the countless evil and unwholesome things practiced [only] by warriors and merchants and not by brahmins? Are the countless wholesome things practiced [only] by brahmins and not by warriors and merchants?

[Vāseṭṭha] replied:

World-honored One, there being countless evil and unwholesome things, they may be practiced by warriors and merchants, and similarly also by brahmins. There being countless wholesome things, they may be practiced by brahmins, and similarly also by warriors and merchants.

[The World-honored One said:]

Vāseṭṭha, if the countless evil and unwholesome things were consistently

practiced only by warriors and merchants and not by brahmins, and if the countless wholesome things were consistently practiced by brahmins and not by warriors and merchants, then the brahmins would be able to make this statement, “We brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth; brahmins are created by Brahmā.” Why is that? Vāseṭṭha, it is seen that brahmin women first get married; and after having been married it is seen that they at some time become pregnant; and after having become pregnant it is seen that they at some time give birth to a boy or a girl. Thus, Vāseṭṭha, brahmins are born in the usual way, through the [mother’s] birth canal. However, they lie and slander Brahmā by saying, “We brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth. Brahmins are created by Brahmā.” Vāseṭṭha, if clansmen, from various clans, with various surnames, leave those various clans and, having shaved off their hair and beards, don the yellow robes, and out of faith leave the household life and become home less to train in the path under me, then they should say, “We brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth, brahmins created by Brahmā.” Why is that? Vāseṭṭha, those sons of clansmen who have entered my true Dharma and discipline and accepted my true Dharma and discipline reach the further shore. Abandoning doubt, transcending perplexity, becom ing free of hesitation, they attain fearlessness in the Dharma of the World honored One. Therefore they can say, “We brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth, brahmins created by Brahmā.” Vāseṭṭha, that “Brahmā” refers to the Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened. “Brahmā” is the Tathāgata. “The Cool” is the Tathāgata, who is without distress, without heat, and who never leaves that state. This is the Tathāgata. Vāseṭṭha, what do you think? Do the Sakyans humble themselves and, with affectionate respect, support and revere King Pasenadi of Kosala? He replied, “That is so, World-honored One.” The World-honored One asked: Vāseṭṭha, what do you think? As the Sakyans humble themselves and, with affectionate respect, support and revere King Pasenadi of Kosala,

does Pasenadi, the king of Kosala, in this way humble himself and, with affectionate respect, support and revere me?

[Vāseṭṭha] answered the World-honored One, saying:

That the Sakyans humble themselves and, with affectionate respect, support and revere King Pasenadi of Kosala—this is not remarkable. That King Pasenadi of Kosala humbles himself and, with affectionate respect, supports and reveres the World-honored One—this is indeed remarkable.

The World-honored One said:

Vāseṭṭha, when King Pasenadi of Kosala humbles himself before my body and, with affectionate respect, supports and reveres me, he does not have this in his mind, “The renunciant Gotama is from the superior class; my class is inferior. The renunciant Gotama has much wealth; I have little wealth.^237 The renunciant Gotama is of beautiful appearance; my appearance is not beautiful. The renunciant Gotama has great might; I have little might. The renunciant Gotama has good knowledge; I have bad knowledge.”^238 Instead, Vāseṭṭha, because King Pasenadi of Kosala has affectionate respect for the Dharma, supports it and reveres it, therefore he humbles himself before my body and, with affectionate respect, supports and reveres me.

Then the World-honored One said to the monks:

Vāseṭṭha, there comes a time when this world goes to total destruction. When this world goes to destruction, any living beings that exist are reborn among the _deva_ s of Radiance ( _ābhassarā-devā_ ). There they have subtle bodies that are mind-made, completely endowed with all limbs and fac- ulties, and feeding on joy. With [their] self-luminous bodies they rise up into space, pure and beautiful, and remain [there] for a long time. Vāseṭṭha, there comes a time when [the space that was formerly occupied by] the great earth becomes filled with water. The surface of that ocean is stirred up by the wind and condenses as an essence that coagulates. It is just as when milk is churned, butter condenses as an essence that coagulates. In the same way, Vāseṭṭha, there comes a time when [the space that was formerly occupied by] the great earth becomes filled with water; and

the surface of that ocean is stirred up by the wind and condenses as an essence that coagulates. From this arises an earthly savor that has color, fragrance, and flavor. What color is it? It is like the color of fresh butter and mature butter. What flavor does it have? It is like the flavor of honey balls. Vāseṭṭha, there comes a time when this world again comes into being. At that time any living beings that have been reborn among the deva s of Radiance, with the exhaustion of their life span, the exhaustion of their karma, and the exhaustion of their merit, die and are reborn here as people. Having been reborn here, they [still] have subtle bodies that are mind made, completely endowed with all limbs and faculties, and feeding on joy. With [their] self-luminous bodies they rise up into space, pure and beautiful, and remain there for a long time. Vāseṭṭha, at that time in the world there were no sun and moon, no constellations of stars, no day and night, no month or half month, and no seasons and no years. Vāseṭṭha, at that time there was no [distinction between] father and mother, no [distinction between] male and female, and also no [distinction between] master and slave. There were just equally ranked living beings. Then one living being, who was greedy, gluttonous, and corrupt, had this thought, “What is the flavor of the earth? Let me take this flavorsome earth on my finger and taste it.” Then that being took the flavorsome earth on his finger and tasted it. In this way that living being came to know the flavor of the earth. He wanted to get more of it to eat. Then that being further had this thought, “Why should I tire myself by using my finger to eat the flavorsome earth. Let me now rather use my hands to gather up this flavorsome earth and eat it.” Then that being used his hands to gather up the flavorsome earth and ate it. Among those beings there were others who, seeing that being gathering up the flavorsome earth with his hands and eating it, thought, “This is truly skillful. This is truly ingenious. Let us too gather up this flavorsome earth with our hands and eat it!” Then those beings gathered up the fla vorsome earth with their hands and ate it. To the extent that those beings gathered up the flavorsome earth with their hands and ate it, to that extent their bodies became fatter, heavier, and

more solid. The formerly clear and pure [luminosity] of their complexion disappeared and darkness naturally arose. Vāseṭṭha, it is a rule of the world that this naturally happens: if darkness arises, sun and moon must arise; once sun and moon have arisen, the con- stellations of stars arise; once the constellation of stars have arisen, day and night come into being; once day and night have come into being, there are months and half months, seasons and years. Those [beings] ate the flavorsome earth and remained in the world for a long time. Vāseṭṭha, those beings that ate much of the flavorsome earth came to be of ugly complexion; those who ate little of the flavorsome earth came to be of beautiful complexion. From then on they understood complexions as superior or inferior. Because of their superior or inferior complexions, beings despised one another, saying, “My complexion is superior; your complexion is not equal to it.” When, because of superiority and inferiority of complexion, arrogance and evil mind states had arisen, the flavorsome earth disappeared. When the flavorsome earth had disappeared, the beings came together with much crying and lamenting, saying, “What has become of the fla- vorsome earth? What has become of the flavorsome earth?” It is just as, nowadays, a person who has let some delicious morsel dis- solve in their mouth similarly those ancient words.^239 Even though they have heard [those ancient words] and bear them in mind, they do not understand their meaning. The meaning of this saying should be regarded as just this. Vāseṭṭha, after the flavorsome earth had disappeared, there arose for those beings an earth-fat that had color, fragrance, and flavor. What color did it have? It was like the color of fresh butter and mature butter. What flavor did it have? It was like the flavor of honey balls. Those [beings] ate this earth-fat and remained in the world for a long time. Vāseṭṭha, if beings ate much of the earth-fat, they came to be of ugly complexion; those who ate little of the earth-fat came to be of beautiful complexion. From then on they understood complexions as superior or inferior. Because of their superior or inferior complexions, beings despised one another, saying, “My complexion is superior; your complexion is not

equal to it.” When, because of superiority and inferiority of complexion, arrogance and evil mind states had arisen, the earth-fat disappeared. When the earth-fat had disappeared, the beings came together with much crying and lamenting, saying, “What has become of the earth-fat? What has become of the earth-fat?” It is just as, nowadays, a person who is being reproached by another similarly <says> those ancient words. Even though they have heard [those ancient words] and bear them in mind, they do not understand their meaning. The meaning of this saying should be regarded as just this. Vāseṭṭha, after the earth-fat had disappeared, there arose for those beings a creeper that had color, fragrance, and flavor. What color did it have? It was like the color of the kadamba flower. What flavor did it have? It was like the flavor of sticky honey balls. Those [beings] ate the creeper and remained in the world for a long time. Vāseṭṭha, those beings that ate much of the creeper came to be of ugly complexion; those who ate little of the creeper came to be of beautiful complexion. From then on they understood complexions as superior or inferior. Because of their superior or inferior complexions, beings despised one another, saying, “My complexion is superior; your complexion is not equal to it.” When, because of superiority and inferiority of complexion, arrogance and evil mind states had arisen, the creeper disappeared. When the creeper had disappeared, the beings came together with much crying and lamenting, saying, “What has become of the creeper? What has become of the creeper?” It is just as, nowadays, a person who is being touched by bitter experiences similarly <says> those ancient words. Even though they have heard [those ancient words] and bear them in mind, they do not understand their meaning. The meaning of this saying should be regarded as just this. Vāseṭṭha, after the creeper had disappeared, there arose for those beings natural nonglutinous rice, which was white, clean, without husks, and without stalks, four inches long. Harvested in the morning, it would be grown [again] by the evening; harvested in the evening, it would be grown [again] by the morning. It had a salty taste when cooked and did not give rise to wind. The beings ate this natural nonglutinous rice.

As those beings ate the natural nonglutinous rice, those beings came to be of different shapes. Some beings came to be of male shape; some beings came to be of female shape. Since those beings had come to have male or female shape, on looking at each other they said, “An evil being has appeared; an evil being has appeared.” Vāseṭṭha, “an evil being has appeared” refers to the [appearance of men and] women. As those beings had male and female shapes, those beings observed each other more. Having observed each other more, they eyed each other more and more. Having eyed each other more and more, they became more and more desirous of each other. Having become more and more desirous of each other, they became overwhelmingly heated up. Having become overwhelmingly heated up, they had craving and attach- ment for each other. Having craving and attachment for each other, they engaged in sensual behavior. When people saw others engaging in sensual behavior, they struck them with sticks and stones or threw staves and clods at them, saying, “Woe betide you! You evil beings are doing what is against the Dharma. How can beings do this together?” It was just as nowadays people greet the bride and scatter simple flowers over her^240 or place a flower garland on her and say, “Peace to the bride! Peace to the bride!” Thus what was formerly undesirable has now become desirable. Vāseṭṭha, when beings were embarrassed by these evil impure things, which are detestable, and felt ashamed of them, they withdrew from the crowd for a day, or two days, up to six or seven days, half a month, one month, up to a year [to engage in them]. Vāseṭṭha, when beings wanted to get to engage in this impure practice, they constructed houses and said, “In here one can do evil; in here one can do evil!” Vāseṭṭha, in the world this is the first cause and condition for the coming into being of the principle of house [construction]. This is ancient knowledge, primary knowledge. It is in accordance with the Dharma, not contrary to the Dharma; and, being in accordance with the Dharma, it is respected by the people. Among them was one being who was lazy and thought,^241 “Why do I every day keep going [repeatedly] to get the natural nonglutinous rice?

What if I were to get all the rice for one day just once?” Then he got all the rice to eat for one day just once. Then a certain [other] being said to that being, “Being, shall we go together to get rice?” The [first] one replied, “I have gotten it already, all at once. You go and get it by yourself.” On hearing this, the [second] being thought, “This is truly skillful. This is truly ingenious. What if I were to get the rice to be eaten tomorrow at once as well?” Then he also got the rice for the next day at once and brought it back. Another [third] being said to that [second] being, “Being, shall we go together to get rice?” That one replied, “I have already gotten the rice for tomorrow at once and brought it back. You go and get it by yourself.” On hearing this, the being thought, “This is truly skillful. This is truly ingenious. What if I were now to get rice to eat for seven days all at once and bring it back?” Then that being got rice for seven days at once and brought it back. Because those beings took the natural nonglutinous rice excessively and stored it up, overnight the nonglutinous rice developed a skinlike husk. Having been harvested for up to seven days, it similarly developed a skinlike husk, and the places where it had been harvested did not grow back. Then those beings came together with much crying and lamenting, saying: We have given rise to evil and unwholesome states, in that we collected and stored up rice overnight. Why is that? Previously we had subtle bodies that were mind-made, completely endowed with all limbs and faculties, feeding on joy, self-luminous bodies. Rising up into space, our pure bodies remained for a long time. A flavorsome earth arose for us, which had color, fragrance, and taste. What color did it have? It was like the color of fresh butter or mature butter. What flavor did it have? It was like the flavor of honey balls. We ate the flavorsome earth and remained in the world for a long time. Those of us who ate much of the flavorsome earth came to be of ugly complexion; those who ate little of the flavorsome earth came to be of beautiful complexion. From then on we understood complexions as superior or inferior. Because of our superior or inferior complexions, we despised one another, saying, “My complexion is superior; your

complexion is not equal to it.” When, because of superiority and infe- riority of complexion, arrogance and evil mind states had arisen, the flavorsome earth disappeared. After the flavorsome earth had disappeared, there arose for us an earth-fat that had color, fragrance, and flavor. What color did it have? It was like the color of fresh butter and mature butter. What flavor did it have? It was like the flavor of honey balls. We ate this earth-fat and remained in the world for a long time. Those of us who ate much of the earth-fat came to be of ugly com- plexion; those who ate little of the earth-fat came to be of beautiful com- plexion. From then on we understood complexions as superior or inferior. Because of our superior or inferior complexions, we despised one another, saying, “My complexion is superior; your complexion is not equal to it.” When, because of superiority and inferiority of complexion, arrogance and evil mind states had arisen, the earth-fat disappeared. After the earth-fat had disappeared, there arose for us a creeper that had color, fragrance, and flavor. What color did it have? It was like the color of the _kadamba_ flower. What flavor did it have? It was like the flavor of sticky honey balls. We ate the creeper and remained in the world for a long time. Those of us who ate much of the creeper came to be of ugly com- plexion; those who ate little of the creeper came to be of beautiful com- plexion. From then on we understood complexions as superior or infe- rior. Because of our superior or inferior complexions, we despised one another, saying, “My complexion is superior; your complexion is not equal to it.” When, because of superiority and inferiority of complexion, arrogance and evil mind states had arisen, the creeper disappeared. After the creeper had disappeared, there arose for us natural non - glutinous rice, which was white, clean, without husks, and without stalks, four inches long. Harvested in the morning, it would be grown [again] by the evening; harvested in the evening, it would be grown [again] by the morning. It had a salty taste when cooked and did not give rise to wind. We ate this natural nonglutinous rice. Because we took the natural nonglutinous rice excessively and stored it up, overnight the nonglutinous rice developed a skinlike husk.

Having been harvested for up to seven days it similarly developed a skin like husk, and the places where it had been harvested did not grow back. What if we were now to create fields for sowing and set up boundary markers? Then the beings created fields for sowing and set up boundary markers. Among them was one being who had their own rice, yet went into another’s field to steal rice. On seeing this, the owner said, “Woe betide you! Woe betide you, evil being! How can you do this? You have your own rice, yet you go into another’s field to steal rice. Now go, and do not do this again!” However, that being stole the other’s rice again, altogether three times. Having seen this three times, the owner beat him with his fists and dragged him before the community. He said to the community, “This being has their own rice, yet goes into my field and steals my rice.” However, that [accused] being also said to the community, “This being has beaten me with his fists and dragged me before the community.”^242 At this, all the beings came together with much crying and lamenting, saying: We have given rise to evil and unwholesome states through guarding our fields. Why is that? Because we guard our fields, we quarrel with one another, there is loss and depletion, there is altercation, and there is beating with fists. Let us now select one among the community who is upright, of fine appearance, very handsome, the foremost, to be lord of the fields. Let him rebuke those who should be rebuked. Let him expel those who should be expelled. From the rice that we have obtained, we will deliver and donate to him [an amount] in accordance with the Dharma. Then the beings together selected one among them who was upright, of fine appearance, very handsome, the foremost, and set him up as lord of the fields. He was to rebuke those who should be rebuked and to expel those who should be expelled. From the rice they had, they delivered and donated to the lord of the fields [an amount] in accordance with the Dharma. He was lord of the “fields” ( khetta ) so they called him “warrior” ( khattiya ). He was empow ered according to the Dharma. One who pleases beings by guarding and

protecting the practice of morality is a king. He was a king so they called him “King.” Vāseṭṭha, this is the first cause and condition for the existence, in the world, of the warrior class. This is ancient, primary knowledge, in accordance with the Dharma, not contrary to the Dharma; and, being in accordance with the Dharma, it is respected by the people. Then certain other beings considered guarding [one’s fields] as a disease, considered such guarding as a carbuncle, considered such guarding as an arrow or a thorn. They gave up such guarding and relied on forest-dwelling, constructing huts out of grass and leaves and trained in meditation. Each morning at dawn they left the forest and entered a village or city or the royal town to beg for almsfood. Seeing them, many beings gave to them, respecting and esteeming them and saying:

These other beings consider guarding [one’s fields] as a disease, consider such guarding as a carbuncle, consider such guarding as an arrow or a thorn. They have given up such guarding and rely on forest-dwelling, constructing huts out of grass and leaves and training in meditation. These venerable ones, having “abandoned” ( bāhitvā ) harming and evil and unwholesome states, are “brahmins” ( brāhmaṇa ).^243

Being brahmins, they were called “brahmins.” Those beings who trained in meditation but did not succeed in meditation, who trained in ascetic practices but did not succeed in ascetic practices, who trained in seclusion but did not succeed in seclusion, who trained in unification of the mind but did not succeed in unification of the mind, who trained in being ener- getic but did not succeed in being energetic, abandoned forest-dwelling and returned to a village or city or the royal town.^244 They constructed houses with four pillars and composed sacred texts. Many beings, on seeing this, no longer gave to them, no longer respected and esteemed them, saying:

These other beings actually considered guarding [one’s fields] as a dis ease, considered such guarding as a carbuncle, considered such guarding as an arrow or a thorn. They gave up such guarding and relied on for est-dwelling, constructing huts out of grass and leaves. They trained in meditation but could not succeed in meditation, they trained in ascetic

practices but did not succeed in ascetic practices, they trained in seclu sion but did not succeed in seclusion, they trained in unification of the mind but did not succeed in unification of the mind, they trained in being energetic but did not succeed in being energetic. They have aban doned forest-dwelling and returned to a village or to a city or to the royal town. They have constructed houses with four pillars and com posed sacred texts. These venerable ones train in wide learning; they no longer train in meditation; they are learned. Being learned, they are called “learned ones.” Vāseṭṭha, this is the first cause and condition for the existence, in the world, of the brahmin class. This is ancient, primary knowledge, in accor dance with the Dharma, not contrary to the Dharma; and, being in accor dance with the Dharma, it is respected by the people. Then those other beings went to all regions to practice farming. They were practicing farming in all regions. Practicing farming in all regions, they were called merchants. Vāseṭṭha, this is the first cause and condition for the existence, in the world, of the merchant class. This is ancient, primary knowledge, in accordance with the Dharma, not contrary to the Dharma; and, being in accordance with the Dharma, it is respected by the people. Vāseṭṭha, when these three classes had arisen in the world, it became known that there was a fourth class, the renunciants.^245 How, when these three classes had arisen in the world, did it become known that there was a fourth class, the renunciants? In a warrior clan, a clansman might censure himself for evil and unwholesome states and, becoming disgusted with himself for his evil and unwholesome states, shave off his hair and beard, don the yellow robes, and out of faith leave the household life and become homeless to train in the path. Thinking, “I shall become a renunciant and practice the holy life,” he would become a renunciant and practice the holy life. In the same way, in a brahmin clan or a merchant clan, a clansman might similarly censure himself for evil and unwholesome states and, being disgusted with himself for his evil and unwholesome states, shave off his hair and beard, don the yellow robes, and out of faith leave the household life and become homeless to train in the path. Thinking, “I

shall become a renunciant and practice the holy life,” he would become a renunciant and practice the holy life. Vāseṭṭha, in this way, when the three classes had arisen in the world, it became known that there was a fourth class, the renunciants. Vāseṭṭha, I will now tell you in detail about these three classes. What, in detail, are these three classes? A clansman of a warrior clan who does unwholesome things with his body... with his speech... and does unwhole- some things with his mind, will, at the breaking up of the body at death, cer- tainly experience suffering. In the same way, a clansman of a brahmin clan or of a merchant clan who does unwholesome things with his body... with his speech... and does unwholesome things with his mind, will, at the breaking up of the body at death, certainly experience suffering. Vāseṭṭha, a clansman of a warrior clan who does wholesome things with his body... with his speech... and does wholesome things with his mind will, at the breaking up of the body at death, certainly experience pleasure. In the same way, a clansman of a brahmin clan or a clansman of a merchant clan who does wholesome things with his body... with his speech... and does wholesome things with his mind will, at the break- ing up of the body at death, certainly experience pleasure. Vāseṭṭha, a clansman of a warrior clan who does both [wholesome and unwholesome] things with his body while practicing restraint... with his speech... and does both [wholesome and unwholesome] things with his mind while practicing restraint will, at the breaking up of the body at death, experience suffering and pleasure. In the same way a clansman of a brahmin clan or of a merchant clan who does both [wholesome and unwholesome] things with his body while practicing restraint... with his speech... and does both [wholesome and unwholesome] things with his mind while practicing restraint will, at the breaking up of the body at death, experience [both] suffering and pleasure. Vāseṭṭha, a clansman of a warrior clan cultivates the seven factors of awakening, attends to them well and contemplates them well. Knowing like this and seeing like this, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire... from the taint of existence... his mind is liberated from the taint of ignorance. It being liberated, he knows it is liberated, knowing as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what

had to be done has been done. There will not be another experiencing of existence.” In the same way a clansman of a brahmin clan or of a merchant clan cul tivates the seven factors of awakening, attends to them well and contemplates them well. Knowing like this and seeing like this, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire... from the taint of existence... his mind is lib erated from the taint of ignorance. It being liberated, he knows it is lib erated, knowing as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing of existence.” Vāseṭṭha, in this way I have analyzed these three classes in detail. Brahmā, the lord of heaven, has spoken this stanza: The warrior is esteemed among two-footed [beings], That is, those possessing class and clan. [But] those who seek to train in knowledge and conduct Are praised by deva s and human beings. Vāseṭṭha, the lord of heaven, Brahmā, said this stanza well, not badly. He intoned and chanted it well, not badly. He proclaimed it well, not badly— that is, saying this: The warrior is esteemed among two-footed [beings], That is, those possessing class and clan. [But] those who seek to train in knowledge and conduct Are praised by deva s and human beings. Why is that? I similarly say this, The warrior is esteemed among two-footed [beings], That is, those possessing class and clan. [But] those who seek to train in knowledge and conduct Are praised by deva s and men. Thus said the Buddha. Having heard what the Buddha said, Venerable Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja and the [other] monks were delighted and received it respectfully.
