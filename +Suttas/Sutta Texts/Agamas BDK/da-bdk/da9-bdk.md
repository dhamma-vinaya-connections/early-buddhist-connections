### Sutra 9

### Numerically Assembled

### Doctrines

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 33: Saṅgīti Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha sojourned in the Mallan country  
accompanied by one thousand two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s. He arrived at  
the mango grove that belonged to Cunda in the city of Pāvā. On the fifteenth  
day of the month, the full moon night, the World-honored One sat in the open  
ground, surrounded by the assembly of _bhikṣu_ s on all sides. The World-hon-  
ored One spent hours of the night teaching the Dharma, and he then said to  
Śāriputra:

Now many disciples have assembled from all quarters and, being dili-  
gent, they are disregarding the hours of sleep. Since I have pain in my  
back and should rest for a while, please conduct the teaching session  
for the sake of these _bhikṣu_ s.  
Śāriputra replied, “Yes, sir. I shall do as instructed.” Then the World-honored  
One folded his outer robe into four layers, spread it on the ground, and lay  
down on his right side, with one foot placed upon the other, like a lion.  
Śāriputra said to the _bhikṣu_ s:  
The head of the Nirgrantha (Jain) school resided in this city of Pāvā,  
and not long ago he passed away. After that, his disciples divided into  
two groups, each of which looked for its own advantage and found  
fault with the other, mutually disdaining and accusing each other as to  
what is right or wrong, arguing, “We know the right thing, whereas  
you do not. You hold a wrong view, whereas we hold the right one.”  
Their words and language are all confused without logical sequence.  
Each party claims that their own statements are regarded as true and  
right, saying, “What we say is superior, while what you said is inferior.”  
Now, I am going to conduct this session of doctrinal discussion. Who-  
ever has questions, please come up and question me.

(5) Again there is another double doctrine that explains first, shame-  
fulness as to self-reflection; second, shamefulness before others.  
(6) Again there is another double doctrine that explains first, knowl-  
edge of the total eradication of defilement; second, knowledge of the  
nonorigination of the states of existence.  
(7) Again there is another double doctrine that asserts that two causes  
and two conditions give rise to desire and craving: first, pure, subtle  
form, and second, indifference.  
(8) Again there is another double doctrine that asserts that two causes  
and two conditions give rise to hate: first, enmity; second, indifference.  
(9) Again there is another double doctrine that asserts that two causes  
and two conditions give rise to wrong views: first, informed by others;  
second, wrong thought.  
(10) Again there is another double doctrine that asserts that two  
causes and two conditions give rise to right views: first, informed by  
others; second, right thought.  
(12) Again there is another double doctrine that asserts that two  
causes and two conditions give rise first to the realization of deliverance  
with further training, and second to the ultimate realization of deliv-  
erance without further training.  
(13) Again there is another double doctrine that asserts that two  
causes and two conditions give rise first, to the sphere of conditioned  
phenomena; second, to the sphere of the unconditioned.  
O _bhikṣu_ s, these are the right doctrines taught by the Tathāgata. We  
should collect these doctrines [in memory] to prevent disputes and  
controversy, to consolidate the practice of austerity for a long time to  
come, and so that the various benefits derived thereby increase the  
well-being of gods and humans.  
O _bhikṣu_ s, the Tathāgata has taught the [following] triple doctrines  
of his right Dharma:  
(1) A triple doctrine explains three kinds of unfavorable roots: greed,  
hatred, and delusion.  
(2) Again there is another triple doctrine that explains three good  
roots: absence of greed, absence of hatred, and absence of delusion.

(15) Again there is another triple doctrine that explains three kinds  
of passion: passion derived from love, passion derived from hatred,  
and passion derived from delusion.  
(16) Again there is another triple doctrine that explains three kinds  
of pursuit for fulfillment: pursuit for fulfillment of desire, pursuit for  
fulfillment of existence, and pursuit for fulfillment of the practice of  
austerity.  
(17) Again there is another triple doctrine that explains three kinds  
of dominant influence: the dominant influence of the self, the dominant  
influence of society, and the dominant influence of religious truth.  
(18) Again there is another triple doctrine that explains three immoral  
spheres of existence: the sphere of desire, the sphere of hatred, and the  
sphere of the intent to harm.  
(19) Again there is another triple doctrine that explains three spheres  
of existence: the sphere of indifference to desire, the sphere of no  
hatred, and the sphere of no intent to harm.  
(20) Again there is another triple doctrine that explains three spheres  
of existence: the sphere of form, the sphere of formlessness, and the  
sphere of cessation.  
(21) Again there is another triple doctrine that explains three kinds  
of religious training: training in precepts, training in states of concen-  
tration, and training in analytical insight.  
(22) Again there is another triple doctrine that explains three kinds  
of practice through cultivation: the practice of precepts through culti-  
vation, the practice of concentration through cultivation, and the practice  
of analytical insight through cultivation.  
(23) Again there is another triple doctrine that explains three kinds  
of concentration: the concentration on the emptiness of the self and  
things attributed to it, the concentration on the objectless or goal-free  
state of existence, and the concentration on signlessness or the non-  
differentiation of things.  
(24) Again there is another triple doctrine that explains three char-  
acteristics: quiescence, exertion, and equanimity.  
(25) Again there is another triple doctrine that explains three kinds  
of knowledge: knowledge in recollection of past lives, knowledge

controversy in the past, the doctrinal debate on subject matter and con-  
troversy in the future, and the doctrinal debate on subject matter and  
controversy in the present.  
(34) Again there is another triple doctrine that explains three kinds  
of sentient beings: those who are predicted to attain nirvana, those who  
are not so predicted, and those whose destiny is uncertain.  
(35) Again there is another triple doctrine that explains three kinds  
of sorrow and lamentation: physical, verbal, and mental.  
(36) Again there is another triple doctrine that explains three kinds  
of elders: elders by way of seniority, elders by way of religion, and  
elders by way of consent or choice.  
(37) Again there is another triple doctrine that explains three kinds  
of visual faculty: the physical faculty of sight, the supernormal faculty  
of sight, and the faculty of transcendental insight.  
O _bhikṣu_ s, these are the right doctrines taught by the Tathāgata. We  
should collect these doctrines [in memory] so as to prevent disputes  
and controversies, to consolidate the practice of austerity for a long  
time to come, and so that the various benefits derived thereby will  
increase the well-being of gods and humans.  
O _bhikṣu_ s, the Tathāgata taught the fourfold doctrines of his right  
Dharma:  
(1) There is a fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds of ignoble  
verbal actions: speaking falsehoods and engaging in double talk, abusive  
speech, and flattery.  
(2) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds  
of noble actions: abstinence from speaking falsehoods, from double talk,  
from harsh speech, and from flattery.  
(3) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds  
of ignoble speech: the false assertion that one has seen something that  
one has not actually seen, that one has heard something that one has  
not actually heard, that one has been aware though actually one has  
not been aware, and that one has known something though actually  
one has not known.  
(4) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds  
of noble speech: the true assertion that one has seen when one has actually

memory, and thereby remove worldly desires and worries. Second,  
observing his outer body (outer sense stimuli) he should exert himself  
with no slackening, being mindful of his observations to keep them in  
memory, and thereby remove worldly desires and worries. Third, while  
observing both the inner and outer body he should exert himself with  
no slackening, being mindful of his observations to keep them in mem-  
ory, and thereby remove worldly desires and worries. It is the same  
with the second application, observing one’s sense perceptions; with  
the third application, observing one’s mind (intellect); and with the  
fourth application, observing one’s psychophysical elements.  
(12) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds  
of vigorous effort: a _bhikṣu_ applies vigorous effort to prevent unfavor-  
able mental elements from arising, vigorous effort to terminate unfa-  
vorable mental elements that already have arisen, vigorous effort to  
help favorable mental elements to arise, and vigorous effort to con-  
template favorable mental elements that have arisen so as to help sustain  
and increase them.  
(13) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds  
of supernormal powers: first, a _bhikṣu_ realizes supernormal power  
derived from dispositional forces bearing the effort of concentration  
motivated by desire. It is the same with the other three cases: through  
concentration motivated by mind, motivated by endeavor, and motivated  
by investigation.  
(14) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four  
kinds of meditative absorption ( _dhyāna-samādhi_ ): first, a _bhikṣu_ con-  
templates the eradication of defilements, such as desire, evil, and unfa-  
vorable things, and realizes the first meditative state of absorption, in  
which there is awareness of objects and the act of examining while  
the sense of joy and bliss increases. Second, he eliminates awareness  
of objects and the subjective act of examination, with increasing tran-  
quility or self-confidence, continually applying concentration of the  
mind, and proceeds to the second meditative state of absorption in  
which there is neither the awareness of an object nor subjective acts  
but a sense of joy and bliss predominate in the arising state of con-  
centration. Third, he distances himself from a sense of joy but dwells

as well as helping others to be outfitted with the requisite robe. This  
is the first kind of self-contentment with the robe requisite, qualifying a  
_bhikṣu_ to be a member of the noble genealogy. He is neither disturbed in  
his mind from the beginning until the present, nor can any fault be found  
in him by gods, evil ones, Brahmā, _śramaṇas_ , _brāhmaṇas_ , [those of] the  
heavenly as well human worlds. H also knows how to be content with  
the remaining three requisites of food, lodging, and medicine for use in  
illness.  
(19) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds  
of characteristics of sympathy: liberality, kind speech, skill in helping  
others, and the sagacious conduct of equality.  
(20) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds  
of the saintly state of stream-enterer: serenity based on trust and faith  
in the Buddha, serenity based on trust and faith in the Dharma, serenity  
based on trust and faith in the Sangha, and serenity based on trust and  
faith in the precepts.  
(21) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds  
of direct experience for oneself: the sense perception of forms expe-  
rienced directly by one’s own eyes, the cessation of bodily sense per-  
ception experienced directly in one’s own body, the [recollection of  
one’s] previous lives experienced directly in one’s own memory, and  
the exhaustion of influences caused by defilement experienced directly  
through one’s own insight.  
(22) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds  
of the mode of progress: painful practice resulting in knowledge slowly  
acquired, painful practice resulting in knowledge quickly acquired,  
pleasant practice resulting in knowledge slowly acquired, and pleasant  
practice resulting in knowledge quickly acquired.  
(23) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains the Four  
Noble Truths: the truth of suffering, the truth of the cause of suffering,  
the truth of the cessation of suffering, and the truth of the path of ces-  
sation of suffering.  
(24) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four results  
of the mendicant life: the result of the saintly state of stream-enterer

(32) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds  
of discernment: one discerns what he can or should accept, how he can  
or should act, what he can or should enjoy, and what he can or should  
forsake.  
(33) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds  
of discerning propriety or deportment: a _bhikṣu_ discerns what deportment  
or mode of walking, standing, sitting, or lying down he should adopt.^26  
(34) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds  
of thought: thought with a focus on a limited scope, thought with a  
range expanded over a wider scope, thought with an infinitely wide  
and expansive range, and thought without a specific focus or object.^27  
(35) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four dialec-  
tical disciplines in questions and answers: a type of dialectical discipline  
to answer categorically, a type of dialectical discipline to explain ana-  
lytically, a type of dialectical discipline to respond with a counter-ques-  
tion, and a type of dialectical discipline to set aside a question.  
(36) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains the four  
points of the Tathāgata that do not need to be guarded for purity and  
genuineness: his physical conduct is completely and automatically  
pure so that he does not need to be on guard with it, and it is the same  
with his verbal and mental conduct and his livelihood.  
O _bhikṣu_ s, these are the right doctrines taught by the Tathāgata. We  
should collect these doctrines in memory to prevent dispute and con-  
troversy, to consolidate the practice of austerity for a long time to come,  
and so that the various benefits derived thereby will help increase the  
well-being of gods and humans.  
Also again, all of the _bhikṣu_ s, the Tathāgata has taught the fivefold  
doctrines of his right Dharma:  
(1) A fivefold doctrine explains five bases of cognition: form as the  
objective basis of the eyes, sound as the objective basis of the ears,  
smell as the objective basis of the nose, taste as the objective basis of  
the tongue, and tactile contact as the objective basis of the body.  
(2) Again there is another fivefold doctrine that explains the five  
aggregates that are the basis of clinging to existence: the aggregate of

(9) Again there is another fivefold doctrine of five kinds of accusa-  
tions: untimely accusation, baseless accuasation, meaningless accusa-  
tion, accusation through harsh words, and accusation derived from  
enmity with no compassion.  
(10) Again there is another fivefold doctrine that explains five kinds  
of good imputations: those that are timely, based in fact, meaningful,  
made with kind, helpful words, and derived from compassion.  
(11) Again there is another fivefold doctrine that explains five kinds  
of envious resentment: envy toward another _bhikṣu_ ’s residence, toward  
lay patrons, toward material goods, toward pleasing appearance, and  
toward access to instruction.  
(12) Again there is another fivefold doctrine that explains five kinds  
of liberation according to five thoughts: contemplation on the impurity  
of the body, contemplation on the impurity of food, contemplation on  
the impermanence of all things, contemplation on the human world as  
not enjoyable, and contemplation on the necessary end of death.^29  
(13) Again there is another fivefold doctrine that explains five essen-  
tial elements for liberation: a _bhikṣu_ should be neither pleased nor dis-  
turbed by desire nor intimated by it but, mindful of the essential elements  
of salvation, he should instead be content in distancing himself from  
it. Even when he happens to be close to desire, he should exert himself  
in controlling his mind without slackening and dissociate himself from  
it by distancing from it. When he has completely discarded and termi-  
nated the defilements that were under evil influences caused by desire,  
he will be able to realize deliverance. This is the first element of lib-  
eration from desire. It is the same with the remaining four: liberation  
from malice, from jealous vexation, from external forms, and from the  
heretical belief in a real personality.  
(14) Again there is another fivefold doctrine that explains five bases  
of liberation. First, if a _bhikṣu_ does not slacken exertion, is content to  
stay in a secluded place, and concentrates his mind, he will be able to  
understand what has not yet been understood, complete what has not  
yet been completed, and settle in himself what has not yet been settled.  
What are these five bases? When a _bhikṣu_ listens to the teaching of the

the sense faculty of smell, the sense faculty of taste, the sense faculty  
of touch, and the mental sense faculty of consciousness.  
(2) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that explains the six exter-  
nal bases of cognition: material form, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile  
sensations, and mental objects.  
(3) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that explains the six kinds  
of consciousness: visual consciousness derived from the sense faculty  
of seeing, auditory consciousness derived from the sense faculty of  
hearing, olfactory consciousness derived from the sense faculty of smell,  
gustatory consciousness derived from the sense faculty of taste, tactile  
consciousness derived from the sense faculty of touch, and mental con-  
sciousness derived from the mental faculty of thought.  
(4) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that explains the six kinds  
of contact between sense faculties and their objects: contact of the  
visual faculty with its object (form), contact of the auditory faculty  
with its object (sound), contact of the olfactory faculty with its object  
(odor), contact of the gustatory faculty with its object (taste), contact  
of tactile faculty with its tangible object, and contact of the mental fac-  
ulty with its mental object (thought).  
(5) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that explains the six kinds  
of sense perception (or sensation): the visual sense perception arising  
from contact [with the object]; likewise, auditory sense perception,  
olfactory sense perception, gustatory sense perception, tactile sense  
perception, and mental sense perception.  
(6) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that comprises six kinds  
of ideation: ideation of the object of seeing, ideation of the object of  
hearing, ideation of the object of smelling, ideation of the object of  
taste, ideation of the object of touch, and ideation of the mental object.  
(7) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that explains the six kinds  
of thought: thought of the object of seeing, thought of the object of  
hearing, thought of the object of smelling, thought of the object of  
taste, thought of the object of touch, and thought of the mental object.  
(8) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that explains the six kinds  
of craving for the objects of faculties: craving for the object of seeing,

the gustatory faculty with its object, taste; the tactile faculty with its  
object, touch; and the mental faculty with its mental object.^30  
(12) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that explains the six  
essential elements of liberation. Suppose a _bhikṣu_ says, “I have practiced  
the immeasurable mind of friendly love ( _maitrī_ ) for the sake of liberation  
yet I still experience malice.” Other _bhikṣu_ s warn him, “You should not  
say this. Your statement slanders the Tathāgata, because the Tathāgata  
has not taught us the way you have experienced. It is utterly impossible  
that if he wishes us to learn the practice of the mind of friendly love as  
an essential element for liberation, we would still experience a thought  
of malice. According to the Buddha, when one eradicates the mind of  
malice, only then he is ready to acquire the mind of benevolence.”  
The remaining five essential elements of liberation should be shown  
by similar responses if a _bhikṣu_ says “I have practiced the immeasurable  
mind of compassion ( _karuṇā_ ) for the sake of liberation yet I still expe-  
rience a mind of jealousy,” “I have practiced the immeasurable mind  
of sympathetic joy ( _muditā_ ) for the sake of liberation yet I still expe-  
rience anxiety,” “I have practiced the immeasurable mind of equanimity  
( _upekṣā_ ) for the sake of liberation yet I still experience mental states  
of attachment and aversion,” “I have practiced the mind of nonself,  
yet I still experience doubt,” and “I have practiced the concentration  
of signlessness for the sake of liberation (i.e., nonapplication of symbols)  
yet I still experience multiple thoughts due to the use of symbols.”  
(13) Again there is a sixfold doctrine that explains the six kinds of  
highest excellence: highest philosophical thought, highest listening to  
teachings, highest material attainment, highest discipline, highest serv-  
ice, and highest mindfulness and recollection.  
(14) Again there is a sixfold doctrine that explains the six objects  
of mindfulness or recollection: being mindful of the Buddha, Dharma,  
and Sangha and being mindful of the precepts, charity, and divinity.  
O _bhikṣu_ s, these are the right doctrines taught by the Tathāgata. We  
should collect these doctrines in memory to prevent disputes and con-  
troversy, to consolidate the practice of austerity for a long time to come,  
and so that the various benefits derived thereby increase the well-being  
of gods and humans.

that there is nothing that can be enjoyed in the world, the thought of  
death, the thought of impermanence, the thought of suffering due to  
impermanence, the thought of suffering due to nonself.  
(6) Again there is another sevenfold doctrine that explains the seven  
auxiliary disciplines of concentration: right view, right thought, right  
speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness.  
(7) Again there is another sevenfold doctrine that explains the seven  
auxiliary disciplines of enlightenment: mindfulness, discernment of  
the psychophysical elements, effort, delight, freedom from bodily and  
mental disturbance, the practice of concentration, and the mind of  
equanimity.  
O _bhikṣu_ s, these are the right doctrines taught by the Tathāgata. We  
should collect these doctrines [in memory] to prevent disputes and  
controversies, to consolidate the practice of austerity for a long time  
to come, and so that the various benefits derived thereby increase the  
well-being of gods and humans.  
O _bhikṣu_ s, the Tathāgata taught the eightfold doctrines of his right  
Dharma:  
(1) There is an eightfold doctrine that explains the eight worldly  
concerns: gain and loss, pleasure and pain, fame and disgrace, and  
praise and blame.  
(2) Again there is another eightfold doctrine that explains the eight  
kinds of liberation: the liberation realized when one, with an internal  
ideation of form, perceives external forms; the liberation realized when  
one, without any internal form ideation, perceives external forms; the  
liberation realized when one has thus terminated all defilements; the  
liberation realized when one, having transcended all form ideations and  
annihilated sensory reaction, abides in the first formless state of con-  
centration, the sphere of infinite space; the deliverance realized when  
one, having transcended the sphere of infinite space, abides in the sphere  
of infinite consciousness; the liberation realized when one, having tran-  
scended the previous sphere, abides in the sphere of nothing or nonutility;  
the liberation realized when one, having transcended the previous sphere,  
abides in the sphere of neither ideation nor nonideation; and the liberation  
realized when one, having transcended the previous sphere, abides in

the final state of cessation free from the senses and ideation (i.e., the  
third saintly state of _anāgāmin_ ).  
(3) Again there is another doctrine that explains the eightfold noble  
path: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood,  
right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.  
(4) Again there is another eightfold doctrine that explains the eight  
saintly personalities: a _bhikṣu_ who is ready for the state of stream-enterer  
and one who has realized the state of stream-enterer; one who is ready  
for the state of once-returner and one who has realized the state of  
once-returner; one who is ready for the state of nonreturner and one  
who has realized the state of nonreturner; and one who is ready for the  
state of arhat and one who has realized arhatship.  
These are the right doctrines taught by the Tathāgata. We should  
collect these doctrines [in memory] to prevent disputes and controver-  
sies, to consolidate the practice of austerity for a long time to come,  
and so that the various benefits derived thereby will increase the well-  
being of gods and humans.  
O _bhikṣu_ s, the Tathāgata taught the ninefold doctrines of his right  
Dharma:  
(1) There is a ninefold doctrine that explains the nine places of sen-  
tient beings. Sentient beings who are in possession of different bodies  
and different ideations are humans and heavenly beings. This is the  
first abode of sentient beings. When some sentient beings possess dif-  
ferent bodies but one and the same ideation, this is the time when the  
god Brahmā was initially born in Ābhāsvara Heaven, where commu-  
nication is accomplished by transmitted light instead of sound. This is  
the second abode of sentient beings. When some sentient beings possess  
one and the same body but different ideations, this is the aforementioned  
Ābhāsvara Heaven. This is the third abode of sentient beings. When  
some sentient beings possess one and the same body and ideation, this  
is Śubhakṛtsna Heaven. This is the fourth abode of sentient beings.  
When some sentient beings reside in the sphere of neither ideation nor  
external awareness, this is Āsaṃjñika Heaven. This is the fifth abode  
of sentient beings. When some sentient beings reside in the sphere of  

infinite space, this is the sixth abode of sentient beings. When some  
sentient beings reside in the sphere of infinite consciousness, this is  
the seventh abode of sentient beings. When some sentient beings reside  
in the sphere of nothingness or nonutility, this is the eighth abode of  
sentient beings. When some sentient beings reside in the sphere of nei-  
ther ideation nor nonideation, this is the ninth abode of sentient beings.  
These are the right doctrines taught by the Tathāgata. We should  
collect these doctrines [in memory] to prevent disputes and controver-  
sies, to consolidate the practice of austerity for a long time to come,  
and so that the various benefits derived thereby increase the well-being  
of gods and humans.  
O _bhikṣu_ s, the Tathāgata taught a tenfold doctrine of his right  
Dharma, namely, the ten norms for the arhat who does not require fur-  
ther training: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right  
livelihood, right mindfulness, right effort, right concentration, right  
wisdom, and right liberation.  
These are the right doctrines taught by the Tathāgata. We should  
collect these doctrines [in memory] to prevent disputes and controver-  
sies, to consolidate the practice of austerity for a long time to come,  
and so that the various benefits derived thereby increase the well-being  
of gods and humans.  
At that time, the World-honored One verified what Śāriputra had exhorted,  
and all the _bhikṣu_ s who had listened to his lecture experienced joy, respectfully  
received the teaching, and carried out what was taught by Śāriputra.
