### Sutra 4

### Janavasabha’s Exhortation

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 18: Janavasabha Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was sojourning at the resthouse  
called Giñjakāvasatha in the village of Nādika, accompanied by a host of  
one thousand two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s. At that time, Venerable Ānanda  
was in meditation in a secluded room and quietly thought to himself:

I earnestly wish, O World-honored One, that an assurance be given  
to [Bimbisāra] as well as others, so that all sentient beings may be  
assured and heavenly beings may be at ease.  
At that time, having made a request to the World-honored One on behalf  
of the people of Magadha, Ānanda rose from his seat and, after venerating  
the Buddha, left the room.  
Thereupon, the World-honored One, donning his _saṃghāṭī_ robe and with  
his almsbowl in hand, went into the city of Nādika. After the almsround,  
having come to the great forest, he sat under a tree and meditated on the  
Magadhan devotees with respect to their deaths and births.  
At that moment there was a spirit not too far away from the Buddha. He  
introduced himself to the World-honored One, “I am Janavasabha, I am  
Janavasabha” (“Victor over Delusion”). The Buddha said:

Why do you call yourself by the name Janavasabha? On the basis of  
what religion do you use such a subtle expression that means “you  
have witnessed the trace of the path”?  
Janavasabha replied:  
I am not from another place. I was formerly a king. I became a lay  
devotee of the Tathāgata’s religion and ended my life with the earnest  
recollection of the Buddha in my mind. Because of that, I was reborn  
as the prince of the guardian god Vaiśravaṇa. Ever since, I have been  
able to illuminate the various religious practices and realized the state  
of stream-enterer, never falling into the evil courses of life. Thus  
throughout seven rebirths in the human world I have always been called  
Janavasabha, sir.  
The Buddha stayed in the great forest as time allowed and then returned  
to the brick resthouse in Nādika. After he took his seat in the prepared position,  
he asked a _bhikṣu_ , “Please convey my words to Ānanda: ‘Come see me.’”  
The _bhikṣu_ answered “Yes, sir” and went to call Ānanda. Having arrived at  
the place of the World-honored One, Ānanda venerated him by bowing his  
forehead to the Buddha’s feet and, withdrawing to sit at one side, he said to  
the Buddha:

[Janavasabha continued his story:]

Then the Trāyastriṃśa gods, having seen this light, were all terrified,  
thinking, “What kind of ill omen does this unusual ray of light indicate?”  
Some of the great deities endowed with supernormal powers were also  
terrified, wondering, “What kind of ill omen does this unusual ray of  
light indicate?”  
Then the god Brahmā assumed the form of a young boy, and with  
his pentagonal head and his hair spread out over the host of gods, he  
rose in midair. His appearance was exceedingly handsome, surpassing  
that of the gods. His body was purplish gold, overwhelming the lumi-  
nosity of all the heavenly beings. The Trāyastriṃśa residents did not  
then stand up to welcome him, nor did they greet him or bid him to  
take his seat. The Brahmā youth, however, took his seat in an available  
space. He was delighted, as if an anointed _kṣatriya_ had ascended to  
the throne, and rejoiced with dancing and leaping. Soon after he sat  
down he changed himself into the form of a young boy, with his head  
in the shape of a pentagon and his hair spreading out over the host of  
gods, sitting in midair, just as a wrestler sits in his permanent seat,  
immovable like a mountain. He then uttered the following verse:

Thereupon, having uttered this verse, the Brahmā youth said to the  
gods of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven:

Then the Brahmā youth said to the god Vaiśravaṇa:

Then the Brahmā youth again said to the residents of Trāyastriṃśa  
Heaven:

At that moment the Brahmā youth transfigured himself into thirty-three  
bodies which respectively sat together with the thirty-three gods, saying  
to each of them, “Have you recognized my supernormal power of trans-  
figuration?” They replied, “Yes, we have seen it.” The Brahmā youth  
said, “Since I practice the four types of supernormal powers I am able  
to transfigure myself into innumerable forms.”  
At that moment, each of the thirty-three gods thought to themselves,  
“Now a single Brahmā youth sits alone in my seat and speaks these  
words to me. Thus, the transfigured form of this Brahmā youth speaks  
this way, and other transfigured Brahmā youths are also speaking.  
When the original Brahmā youth becomes silent, all the transfigured  
forms shall fall silent as well.”  
The Brahmā youth then removed the spell of supernormal power,  
seated himself in the position of Indra, and said to the residents of  
Trāyastriṃśa Heaven:

Second, again suppose some individual entertains a sense of hatred  
and anger and does not forsake his bad physical, verbal, and volitional  
habits. Later on, however, he meets some good friends and listens  
to good words on the Dharma and then acquires the truth of the  
Dharma. Having done so, he frees himself from bad physical, verbal,  
and volitional actions, causes joy to arise in his mind, and simply  
becomes happy. He then finds within the state of happiness further  
cause for the arising of great joy. This is like the manner in which,  
having thrown away poor food after partaking of a tasty meal, a per-  
son still seeks an even better meal. The practitioner should be like  
this. Having forsaken morally bad elements one obtains a state of  
joy and happiness, and yet within that state of happiness one finds  
further cause for the arising of great joy. This is the second passage  
of realization that the Tathāgata opened.  
Third, again, some people are stupid and ignorant, do not know  
what is good and what is bad, and cannot know the Four Noble  
Truths, [the nature of] suffering, the causes, cessation, and the path  
as they truly are. Later on, however, a person meets some good  
friends and listens to good words on the Dharma and then acquires  
the truth of the Dharma. Having done so, he frees himself from bad  
physical, verbal, and volitional actions, causing joy to arise in his  
mind, and he simply becomes happy. He then finds within the state  
of happiness further cause for the arising of great joy. This is like  
the manner in which, having thrown away poor food after partaking  
of a tasty meal, a person still seeks an even better meal. The prac-  
titioner should be like this. Having forsaken morally bad elements  
one obtains a state of joy and happiness, and yet within that state  
of happiness one finds further cause for the arising of great joy. This  
is the third passage of realization that the Tathāgata opened.  
At that time, the Brahmā youth exhorted the foregoing doctrines to the  
Trāyastriṃśa gods, and the guardian god Vaiśravaṇa became a follower of  
his teaching and propagated the right Dharma along with him. The _yakṣa_  
Janavasabha also exhorted this Dharma before the Buddha, and the World-  
honored One exhorted this Dharma to Ānanda. Ānanda then also exhorted

this Dharma to the _bhikṣu_ s, _bhikṣuṇī_ s, and male and female lay householders  
( _upāsaka_ s and _upāsikā_ s). Having listened to this doctrine taught by the  
Buddha, Ānanda experienced joy, respectfully received the teaching, and  
carried out what was taught by the Buddha.
