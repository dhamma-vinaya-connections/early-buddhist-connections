### Poṭṭhapāda

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 9: Poṭṭhapāda Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. Once the Buddha was staying in Anāthapiṇḍika Monastery  
in Prince Jeta’s Grove near the city of Śrāvastī, accompanied by one thousand  
two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s. The World-honored One put on his outer robe  
and with his almsbowl in hand went into the city of Śrāvastī in the early  
morning. As he walked, the World-honored One thought:

It is still a bit early for the almsround. I will visit the _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic  
Poṭṭhapāda in the forest to see how he is doing. I can stay there until it is  
time for the almsround.  
The World-honored One went to the forest. The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic  
Poṭṭhapāda had seen the Buddha approaching from a distance, and he stood  
up at once to greet him, “Welcome, _śramaṇa_ Gautama. I have not seen you  
for some time. What has prompted Your Reverence to come this way? Please  
take the seat in front.”  
The World-honored One took the seat that was offered and said to  
Poṭṭhapāda, “Now that I am here, tell me what you have been discussing.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic replied:  
O World-honored One, many _brāhmaṇa_ ascetics, _śramaṇa_ s, and lay _brāh-  
maṇa_ s gathered in the Brahmā Hall yesterday and talked about a number  
of things, arguing back and forth over their different views. O Gautama,  
one _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic proposed this theory: “Thoughts form in the mind  
apart from any causes or conditions. Thoughts also perish from the mind  
without cause or condition. Thoughts are known by their coming and  
going. When they come, they arise in the mind, and when they go, they  
perish from the mind.”  
O Gautama, another _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic argued for this idea: “The self  
knows the presence of a thought through its arising, and also knows its

absence through its perishing. Each thought is known by its coming and
going. When it comes the thought arises, and when it goes the thought
perishes.”
O Gautama, a third brāhmaṇa ascetic presented the following notion:
“The foregoing two theories are impossible. Thoughts arise only through
the activity of a great spirit whose boundless power brings forth each
thought and also takes it away. When he produces it a thought arises, and
when he takes it away the thought perishes. My thoughts arise because
of the activity of that spirit.”
O Gautama, if one can grasp the meaning of those theories, one might
begin to discern how the cessation of thinking and knowing may take place.
The World-honored One said to the brāhmaṇa ascetic Poṭṭhapāda:
According to what you have said, all three theorists are culpable of com-
mitting an error. First, that thoughts form in the mind apart from any
causes or conditions, and also perish from the mind without cause or con-
dition; thoughts are known by their coming and going, and when they
come they arise in the mind, and when they go they perish from the mind.
Second, that the self knows the presence of a thought through its arising,
and also knows its absence through its perishing; each thought is known
by its coming and going, and when it comes the thought arises, and when
it goes the thought perishes. Third, that thoughts only arise through the
activity of a great spirit whose boundless power brings forth each thought
as well as takes it away; when [the spirit] produces it a thought arises,
and when [the spirit] takes it away it perishes. Those who assert these
theories are necessarily culpable of committing an error. Why? Because
thoughts arise when there is a causal dependence for their creation, and
they perish when there is a causal dependence for their cessation.
When the Tathāgata appears in this world, he is endowed with ten
supreme titles, such as One Liberated from Attachment, Perfectly Enlight-
ened One, and so on. If someone renounces domestic life in accord with
the Buddha’s path and applies himself to the practice of austerity, and so
on, he eradicates the five kinds of moral and spiritual hindrance, namely,
(1) sexual desire, (2) malice, (3) drowsiness and sloth, (4) worry and agi-
tation, and (5) doubt. Having removed desires and unfavorable elements,

he or she is still aware of an object and of the act of examining but the  
cause of birth has been removed (i.e., reaching the supramundane realm)  
and he enters the first meditative state of absorption, giving rise to a sense  
of joy and bliss. Here he eradicates all thought of desire, increasing the  
sense of joy and bliss. O _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic, because of this, he knows that  
thoughts arise due to causal dependence and also cease due to causal  
dependence.  
[Now,] eliminating awareness of an object as well as awareness of the  
subjective act of examining, he enters the second meditative state of  
absorption with increasing tranquility and self-confidence, and experiences  
a predominant sense of joy and bliss in the emergent state of concentration.  
O _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic, he observed that thoughts ceased in the first meditative  
state of absorption and [now] a thought arises in the second meditative  
state of absorption. Because of this, he knows that thoughts arise due to  
causal dependence and also cease due to causal dependence.  
[Next,] as the sense of joy fades, he enters the third meditative state  
of absorption, mindful of the sense of equanimity, and is fully aware of  
the subtler bliss in pure and genuine mindfulness and equanimity that the  
wise and holy speak of as indispensable. O _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic, he observed  
that thoughts ceased in the second meditative state of absorption and [now]  
a thought arises in the third meditative state of absorption. Because of  
this, he knows that thoughts arise due to causal dependence and also cease  
due to causal dependence.  
[Next,] transcending both pleasure and pain and removing joy and sor-  
row, he enters the fourth meditative state of absorption, which is the equa-  
nimity that consolidates pure and genuine mindfulness. O _brāhmaṇa_ asce-  
tic, he observed that thoughts ceased in the third meditative state of  
absorption and [now] a thought arises in the fourth meditative state of  
absorption. Because of this, he knows that thoughts arise due to causal  
dependence and also cease due to causal dependence.  
[Next,] removing all thought of external forms, he terminates anger  
without conjuring further thought and enters the [formless] realm of infinite  
space, which is the first formless state of concentration. O _brāhmaṇa_ asce-  
tic, he observes all sense of form ending in this formless concentration,  
and [now] an awareness of the realm of infinite space arises. Because of

this, he knows that thoughts arise due to causal dependence and also cease
due to causal dependence.
[Next,] transcending the realm of infinite space, he enters the [formless]
realm of infinite consciousness, which is the second formless state of con-
centration. O brāhmaṇa ascetic, he observes the thought of the realm of
infinite space ending as an awareness of the realm of infinite consciousness
arises. Because of this, he knows that thoughts arise due to causal depend-
ence and also cease due to causal dependence.
[Next,] transcending the realm of infinite consciousness, he enters the
[formless] realm of nothingness or nonutility, which is the third formless
state of concentration. O brāhmaṇa ascetic, as the thought of the realm
of infinite consciousness ends an awareness of the realm of nothingness
arises. Because of this, he knows that thoughts arise due to causal depend-
ence and also cease due to causal dependence.
[Next,] transcending the realm of nothingness, he enters the [formless]
realm of neither thought nor nonthought, which is the fourth formless
state of concentration. O brāhmaṇa ascetic, as the thought of the realm
of nothingness ends an awareness of the realm of neither thought nor non-
thought arises. Because of this, he knows that thoughts arise due to causal
dependence and also cease due to causal dependence.
[Next,] transcending the realm of neither thought nor nonthought, he
enters the final state of cessation, beyond all thought and sensation. This
is the third saintly state, that of the nonreturner ( anāgāmin ). O brāhmaṇa
ascetic, when awareness of the [formless] realm of neither thought nor
nonthought ends he enters the state of concentration in which all thoughts
and sensations [totally] cease. Because of this, he knows that thoughts
arise due to causal dependence and also cease due to causal dependence.
Having acquired this insight, he may think: “It is not good to project
a thought or idea in the mind; moreover, it is good not to project a thought
or idea in the mind.” If he thinks in this way, a subtle form of thinking
remains (i.e., is not annihilated), causing gross forms to arise. Again, he
may think: “I should not engage in imagining anything, nor should I pursue
any thoughts.” By not imagining or pursuing thoughts, subtle thinking
comes to an end and no gross form arises. That is, when he does not engage
in imagining anything, his habitual pursuit of thought does not emerge.

Accomplishing this, he enters the final state of concentration in which all  
thoughts and sensations completely cease.  
What do you think? O _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic, in your prior training, was  
this kind of causality ever mentioned to explain the gradual cessation of  
ideation?  
The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic replied, “Sir, I have never before heard of this kind  
of causality in the gradual cessation of ideation, but I believe my prior training  
helps me understand it.”  
Again, Poṭṭhapāda said to the Buddha:  
Now, [as explained by the World-honored One,] when I produce a thought  
[in my mind] it appears either as a thought of existence or as a thought  
of nonexistence. But then another thought arises. When it too is gone, I  
think to myself: “It is not good to project a thought or idea in the mind;  
moreover, it is good not to project a thought or idea in the mind.” When  
I come to this insight, however, I have not terminated the process of subtle  
projection and this causes gross forms of thinking to arise. So I say to  
myself: “I should not engage in imagining anything, nor should I pursue  
any thoughts. By not imagining or pursuing thoughts, subtle projection  
comes to an end and no gross forms arise. That is, when I neither imagine  
anything nor pursue any thoughts, the process of subtle thought formation  
ends, eliminating the cause of gross forms, and I enter the final state of  
concentration in which all thoughts and sensations are totally annihilated.”  
The Buddha said, “Very good. This is called the state of concentration in  
which one realizes the gradual cessation of ideation, as practiced by the wise  
and saintly disciples.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic asked, “Sir, of those ideas, which is the highest?”  
The Buddha replied, “The idea of the realm of nothingness is the highest.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic asked again, “Of those ideas, which is supreme?”  
The Buddha replied:  
In terms of the varieties of ideas of existence and of nonexistence, proceeding  
gradually [by stages] and realizing the final state of concentration in which  
all thoughts and sensations completely cease is called the supreme idea.

The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic again asked, “Sir, is it a single supreme idea or  
multiple?”  
The Buddha replied, “It is a single idea, not multiple.”  
[Poṭṭhapāda] again asked:  
Does an idea arise first, and then comes knowledge ( _jñāna_ )? Or is it that  
knowledge comes first and then the idea is formed, or that knowledge and  
the idea arise simultaneously?  
The Buddha replied, “An idea arises first, and then comes knowledge  
( _jñāna_ ). When thinking occurs, knowledge follows.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic again asked, “Sir, is a the selfhood of a person  
( _puruṣasyaātman_ ) an idea?”  
The Buddha replied, “In your view, what do you regard as the selfhood  
of a person?”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic replied:  
I do not say that the self is a person. I regard myself as consisting of a physical  
body composed of four material elements ( _mahābhūta_ s) and six sense faculties  
( _āyatana_ s), all of which were inherited at birth from my mother and father  
and nurtured through childhood. But it is nothing more than an embodiment  
of impermanence, which will become worn out and [eventually] perish. As  
the embodiment of impermanence, I say that such a person has a self.  
The Buddha said:  
O _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic, what you refer to as your impermanent body com-  
posed of four material elements and six sense faculties that were inherited  
from your mother and father and nurtured through childhood—do you  
say that this is your self? O _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic, you should discard the idea  
of a self, [because] it is only the idea of a person that arises and perishes.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic said, “Sir, I do not say that the self is a person. It  
is rather the person’s heavenly body [that belongs to] the realm of desire.”  
The Buddha said:  
You should discard the idea that the self is the person’s heavenly body  
[that belongs to] the realm of desire, [because] it is only the idea of a  
person that arises and perishes.

The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic said:  
I do not say that the self is a person. It is rather the person’s heavenly  
body [that belongs to] the realm of form, [which is higher than the realm  
of desire].  
The Buddha said:  
You should discard the idea that the self is the person’s heavenly body  
[that belongs to] the realm of form, [because] it is only the idea of a person  
that arises and perishes.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic said:  
I do not say that the self is a person. It is rather the person’s heavenly  
body [that belongs to] the formless realms ( _ārūpyadhātu_ ), namely, the  
realms of infinite space, of infinite consciousness, of nothingness, and of  
neither thought nor nonthought.  
The Buddha said:  
You should discard the idea that the self is the person’s heavenly body  
[that belongs to] the formless realms, namely, the realms of infinite space,  
of infinite consciousness, of nothingness, and of neither thought nor non-  
thought, [because] it is only the idea of a person that arises and perishes.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic said to the Buddha, “What do you think, O Gau-  
tama? Will I be able to grasp why it is only the idea of a person that arises  
and perishes?”  
The Buddha replied:  
Though you may wish to understand why it is only the idea of a person  
that arises and perishes, it will be difficult for you to grasp this, precisely  
because you have been influenced by different views, a different teacher  
and school, a different training [toward a different goal], a different tol-  
erance, and a different attitude toward pleasure.  
Poṭṭhapāda said:  
Exactly, sir. O Gautama, I have been influenced by different views, a dif-  
ferent teacher and school, a different training [toward a different goal], a

different tolerance, and a different attitude toward pleasure, and it is very  
difficult for me to grasp why only the idea of a person arises and perishes.  
Why? Precisely because of the following views: (1) The self and the world  
are permanent; this alone is true while the rest is false. (2) The self and the  
world are impermanent; this alone is true while the rest is false. (3) The  
self and the world are both permanent and impermanent; this alone is true  
while the rest is false. (4) The self and the world are neither permanent  
nor impermanent; this alone is true while the rest is false. (5) The self and  
the world are limited [and have an end]; this alone is true while the rest is  
false. (6) The self and the world are limitless [and have no end]; this alone  
is true while the rest is false. (7) The self and the world are both limited  
and limitless; this alone is true while the rest is false. (8) The self and the  
world are neither limited nor limitless; this alone is true while the rest is  
false. (9) This life principle is the body itself; this alone is true while the  
rest is false. (10) If there is another life principle, there is another body;  
this alone is true while the rest is false. (11) The life principle and the body  
are neither different nor nondifferent; this alone is true while the rest is  
false. (12) If there is no life principle, there is no [living] body; this alone  
is true while the rest is false. (13) The Tathāgata has an end; this alone is  
true while the rest is false. (14) The Tathāgata has no end; this alone is true  
while the rest is false. (15) The Tathāgata has an end as well as no end;  
this alone is true while the rest is false. (16) The Tathāgata has neither an  
end nor no end; this alone is true while the rest is false.  
The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic, “I do not subscribe to any views  
holding that ‘the self and the world are permanent’ and so on, up to ‘the  
Tathāgata has neither end nor no end.’  
Poṭṭhapāda said, “O Gautama, why don’t you subscribe to the view that  
the self and the world are permanent, or to any of those other views?”  
The Buddha replied:  
Because they do not accord with true meanings, do not accord with the  
doctrine, have nothing to do with the practice of austerity as the foundation,  
and do not represent the eradication of desire, or the state of cessation, or  
the state of quiescence, or the goal of perfect enlightenment ( _anuttara_

_samyaksaṃbodhi_ ), or the life of _śramaṇa_ s, or the state of nirvana. For  
these reasons I do not subscribe to any of these views.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic again asked:  
What are the views that accord with true meanings, accord with the doc-  
trine, relate to the practice of austerity, represent the eradication of desire,  
the state of cessation, the state of quiescence, the goal of perfect enlight-  
enment, the life of _śramaṇa_ s, and the state of nirvana? And what does it  
mean to “subscribe” to a view, sir?  
The Buddha replied:  
I subscribe to the doctrine of the truth of suffering, of [the truth of the]  
causal aggregates [of suffering], of [the truth of the] cessation [of suffering],  
and of the [truth of the] essential path to liberation [from suffering] (i.e.,  
the Four Noble Truths). Why? Because this doctrine accords with true  
meanings, accords with the teaching, has the practice of austerity as its  
foundation, and represents the eradication of desire, the state of cessation,  
the state of quiescence, the goal of perfect enlightenment, the life of _śra-  
maṇa_ s, and the state of nirvana. Because of this, I subscribe [to the doctrine  
of the Four Noble Truths].  
Thereupon, the World-honored One gave Poṭṭhapāda a discourse on the  
Dharma, imparting instruction, benefit, and delight, and then stood up and  
left his place.  
Not long after the Buddha’s departure some of the other _brāhmaṇa_ ascetics  
criticized the _brāhmaṇa_ Poṭṭhapāda:

How can you listen to the words of the śramaṇa Gautama and accept them
as right? When he says “I do not subscribe to any views holding that ‘the
self and the world are permanent’ and so on, up to ‘the Tathāgata has
neither an end nor no end,’ because they do not accord with true meanings,”
how can you accept such a statement? We do not consider these words to
be acceptable.
Poṭṭhapāda said to the brāhmaṇa ascetics:

The _śramaṇa_ Gautama explained that he does not subscribe to views hold-  
ing that the self and the world are permanent and so on, up to “the Tathāgata  
has neither an end nor no end,” because they do not accord with true mean-  
ings. I do not necessarily accept that statement, [just as you do not,] but  
[I know that] the _śramaṇa_ Gautama has realized deliverance, abides in  
the Dharma, and that all his statements are in accord with the Dharma.  
On what grounds could I oppose these words that reflect his wisdom?  
When the _śramaṇa_ Gautama expresses truthful words with such subtlety,  
you cannot oppose them just to be contradictory.  
On another occasion, the _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic Poṭṭhapāda visited the World-  
honored One in the company of Hastiśāriputra. The latter greeted the Buddha  
with a bow and took a seat to one side. Then Poṭṭhapāda venerated the  
Buddha and Hastiśāriputra and also took a seat to one side. Poṭṭhapāda said  
to the Buddha:

O World-honored One, not long after Your Reverence left my place after
your last visit, some of the brāhmaṇa ascetics criticized me. They said,
“How can you listen to the words of the śramaṇa Gautama and accept
them as right? When he says, ‘I do not subscribe to any views holding
that the self and the world are permanent and so on, up to ‘the Tathāgata
has neither an end nor no end,’ because they do not accord with true mean-
ings,’ how can you accept such a statement? We do not consider these
words to be acceptable.”
I told those brāhmaṇa ascetics, “The śramaṇa Gautama explained that
he does not subscribe to views holding that the self and the world are per-
manent and so on, up to ‘the Tathāgata has neither an end nor no end,’
because they do not accord with true meanings. I do not necessarily accept
that statement, [just as you do not,] but [I know that] the śramaṇa Gautama
has realized deliverance, abides in the Dharma, and that all his statements
are in accord with the Dharma. On what grounds could I oppose words that
reflect his wisdom? When the śramaṇa Gautama expresses truthful words
with such subtlety, you cannot oppose them just to be contradictory.”
The Buddha said:
The words of censure uttered by those brāhmaṇa ascetics against you,

such as, “How can you listen to the words of the _śramaṇa_ Gautama and  
accept them as right,” are at fault. Why? Because in my teaching I dis-  
tinguish between two types of truth: (1) absolutely determinate truth and  
(2) indeterminate truth. What is indeterminate truth? The views that have  
been repeated, namely, that the self and the world are permanent and so  
on, up to “the Tathāgata has neither an end nor no end,” belong to the  
indeterminate category. I too use these views when teaching doctrine, but  
I use them only as indeterminate truths. The reason they are indeterminate  
is that they do not accord with true meanings, do not accord with the doc-  
trine, have nothing to do with the practice of austerity as the foundation,  
and do not represent the eradication of desire, or the state of cessation, or  
the state of quiescence, or the goal of perfect enlightenment, or the life  
of _śramaṇa_ s, or the state of nirvana. For this reason, O _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic,  
even though I use these views when teaching doctrine, I do not regard  
them as determinate truths. What views, then, are determinate? I consider  
the truths of suffering, of causal aggregates, of cessation, and of the essen-  
tial path of liberation [from suffering] as determinate truths. The reason  
they are determinate is that they accord with true meanings, accord with  
the doctrine, have the practice of austerity as their foundation, and represent  
the eradication of desire, the state of cessation, the state of quiescence,  
the goal of perfect enlightenment, the life of _śramaṇa_ s, and the state of  
nirvana. Therefore, I teach the Four Noble Truths as determinate truths.  
O _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic, there are some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s who  
believe in attaining absolute happiness in a world in the afterlife. I asked  
one of them, “Do you believe in attaining absolute happiness in a world  
in the afterlife?” He replied, “Yes, I do, just as you have said.” I again  
asked, “Have you ever known or seen this state of absolute happiness in  
such a world?” He replied, “No, I have neither known nor seen it.” I again  
asked, “The gods of that world enjoy the state of absolute happiness. Have  
you ever seen them?” He replied, “No, I have neither known nor seen  
them.” I again asked, “Do you meet with the gods of that world, and do  
you converse with them or practice meditation together?” He replied, “No,  
I don’t.” I again asked, “Has any one of the gods who enjoy absolute hap-  
piness in that world ever come to say to you: ‘Since your conduct has been  
honest and direct, you will be reborn in the world of absolute happiness.

I was honest and direct and I was born there, and I have been enjoying  
life there ever since. Let us enjoy life there together’?” He replied, “No,  
no one has.” I again asked, “Have you been able to use the supernormal  
power of your mind to create another body composed of the four material  
elements and endowed with all the sense faculties and physical limbs  
without exception?” He replied, “No, I have not.”  
What do you think, O _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic? Should the words of those  
_śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s be regarded as honest and truthful?  
The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic Poṭṭhapāda replied, “Their words are neither honest  
nor truthful, sir.”  
The Buddha said:  
It is just like a philanderer bragging about his conquest of some imaginary  
beauty by praising her sexual prowess. When others ask, “How do you  
know her? Is she from the east, west, north, or south?”, he replies, “I don’t  
know.” Again, when others ask, “Where can she be found—in what town,  
district, or village?”, he replies, “I don’t know.” When they ask, “What  
about her family? Is she from a _kṣatriya_ family, or from a _brāhmaṇa,  
vaiśya,_ or _śūdra_ family?”, he again replies, “I don’t know.” And when  
they ask, “What does she look like? Is she tall or short, stout or delicate,  
dark or light? Is she beautiful or ugly?”, he again replies, “I don’t know.”  
O _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic, could the story [of the woman] told by that man be  
regarded as honest and truthful?  
The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic replied, “No, sir. It could not be regarded as honest  
or true.”  
[The Buddha continued:]  
O _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic, suppose a man sets up a ladder in an empty spot.  
Someone asks, “Why are you setting up a ladder in an empty spot?” The  
man replies, “I wish to ascend to the next floor of the building.” Others  
ask, “What building? Is it in the east, west, north, or south?” He replies,  
“I do not know.” What do you think, O _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic? Wouldn’t it  
be far-fetched to set up a ladder in an empty spot and try to ascend to the  
next floor of an imaginary building?

[The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic] replied, “Exactly, sir. Such behavior would be  
far-fetched.”  
The Buddha said, “It is the same with the beliefs of the _śramaṇa_ s and  
_brāhmaṇa_ s. What they teach is fanciful and unreal.  
The Buddha said to Poṭṭhapāda:  
You said previously that your physical body is composed of four material  
elements and six sense faculties that were inherited from your mother and  
father and nurtured through childhood, and hence is nothing but an embod-  
iment of impermanence, which wll become worn out and [eventually]  
perish; and that it would be such a person that has a self. Now, I teach  
that this corporeal body [in which you assumed the existence of a self] is  
defiled, [yet] its purity and genuineness can be realized, together with  
deliverance from suffering. In your thinking, perhaps you would assert  
that defilements cannot be annihilated and that no pure and genuine ele-  
ments can arise [where there continue to be defilements]. Do not ever fall  
prey to this [pessimistic] thought when you are in the midst of suffering.  
Why? Because defilements can be annihilated, causing pure and genuine  
elements to arise. When you experience delight and realize the state of  
joy and bliss and abide therein, your knowledge will expand through gen-  
uine mindfulness and mental concentration.  
O _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic, I teach that defilements are found not only in the  
heavenly body belonging to the realms of desire and form, but also in the  
heavenly body in the [formless] realms of infinite space, of infinite con-  
sciousness, of nothingness, and of neither thought nor nonthought. Yet I  
also teach that the purity and genuineness of that heavenly body can be  
realized, along with deliverance from suffering. In your thinking, perhaps  
you would assert that the defilements cannot be annihilated and that no  
pure and genuine elements can arise [where there continue to be defile-  
ments]. Do not ever fall prey to this [pessimistic] thought when you are  
in the midst of suffering. Why? Because defilements can be annihilated,  
causing pure and genuine elements to arise. When you experience delight  
and realize the state of joy and bliss and abide therein, your knowledge  
will expand through genuine mindfulness and mental concentration.

Then Hastiśāriputra asked the Buddha:
O World-honored One, when a person’s physical body in the realm of
desire is composed of the four material elements and six sense faculties,
does that person simultaneously have a heavenly body in the realms of
desire and form, as well as in the formless realms of infinite space, infinite
consciousness, nothingness, and neither thought nor nonthought? O World-
honored One, when a person’s heavenly body is in the realm of desire,
does the person simultaneously have a physical body composed of the four
material elements and six sense faculties in the realm of desire, and a heav-
enly body in the realm of form as well as in the formless realms of infinite
space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, and neither thought nor non-
thought? O World-honored One, when a person’s heavenly body is in the
realm of form, does the person simultaneously have a physical body com-
posed of the four material elements and six sense faculties in the realm of
desire, and a heavenly body in the realm of desire as well as in the formless
realms of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, and neither
thought nor nonthought? Continuing in this manner, when a person’s heav-
enly body belongs to the realm of neither thought nor nonthought, does
the person simultaneously have a physical body composed of the four
material elements and six sense faculties belonging to the realm of desire
and a heavenly body belonging to the realm of desire as well as to the
realms of form, infinite space, infinite consciousness, and nothingness?
The Buddha replied:
When there is a physical body composed of the four material elements
and six sense faculties belonging to the realm of desire, it is only the phys-
ical body composed of the four gross elements and six sense faculties
belonging to the realm of desire, and not a heavenly body belonging to
the realms of desire or form, or one belonging to the formless realms of
infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, and neither thought
nor nonthought. Continuing in this manner, when a person’s heavenly
body belongs to the realm of neither thought nor nonthought, it is only
the heavenly body of that person that belongs to the realm of neither
thought nor nonthought, and not a physical body composed of the four

material elements and six sense faculties belonging to the realm of desire,  
or a heavenly body belonging to the realms of desire or form or to the  
formless realms of infinite space, infinite consciousness, and nothingness.  
O Hastiśāriputra, it is like the changing states that occur in milk. Milk  
( _kṣīra_ ) changes to become cheese, then cheese changes to become fresh  
butter, fresh butter changes to become butter, [and finally] butter changes  
to become ghee (clarified butter). Ghee is the best of all. O Hastiśāriputra,  
when milk is in the state of milk, it is called milk and not called cheese,  
butter, or ghee. Continuing in this manner, when there is clarified butter  
it is called ghee and not milk, cheese, or fresh butter.  
O Hastiśāriputra, your question can be answered in precisely the same  
way. When there is a physical body composed of the four material elements  
and six sense faculties belonging to the realm of desire, it is not a heavenly  
body belonging to the realm of desire or a heavenly body belonging to  
the realm of form, and so on, up to the formless realm of neither thought  
nor nonthought. Similarly, when there is a heavenly body in the realm of  
neither thought nor nonthought, it is only a heavenly body and not a phys-  
ical body composed of the four material elements and six sense faculties  
in the realm of desire, or any heavenly body in the realm of desire, in the  
realm of form, and so on, up to the realm of nothingness.  
O Hastiśāriputra, how do you reply when others ask, “Is your body in the  
past simultaneously your body in the present as well as your future body?”  
Or “Is your future body simultaneously your past body as well as your body  
in the present?” Or “Is your present body simultaneously your body in the  
past as well as your future body?” What do you say to such questions?

Hastiśāriputra replied:

Sir, if I am plied with such questions, I reply as follows. The past body  
belongs to the past and is neither the body in the present nor the future  
body. Again, the future body belongs to the future and is neither the past  
body nor the body in the present. Again, the present body belongs to the  
present and is neither the past body nor the future body.

The Buddha said to Hastiśāriputra:

O Hastiśāriputra, your previous question can be answered in precisely
the same way. When there is a physical body composed of the four material
elements and six sense faculties belonging to the realm of desire, it is not
a heavenly body belonging to the realm of desire or a heavenly body
belonging to the realm of form, and so on, up to the formless realm of
neither thought nor nonthought. Similarly, when there is a heavenly body
in the realm of neither thought nor nonthought, it is only a heavenly body
and not a physical body composed of the four material elements and six
sense faculties in the realm of desire, or any heavenly body in the realm
of desire, and so on, up to the [formless] realm of nothingness.
Again, O Hastiśāriputra, if others ask, “Did you perish in the past, will
you come again in the future, and are you now in the present?”, what do
you say to them?
Hastiśāriputra replied:
If I am so questioned, I shall reply: “I once perished in the past, and I was
not nonexistent. I will come into existence in the future, and I will not be
nonexistent. I now exist in the present, and I am not nonexistent.”
The Buddha said:
O Hastiśāriputra, your previous question can be answered in the same way.
When there is a physical body composed of the four material elements and
six sense faculties belonging to the realm of desire, it is not a heavenly
body belonging to the realm of desire and so on, or a heavenly body belong-
ing to the formless realm of neither thought nor nonthought. Similarly,
when there is a heavenly body in the realm of neither thought nor non-
thought, it is not a physical body composed of the four material elements
and six sense faculties in the realm of desire, or any heavenly body in the
realm of desire, and so on, up to the [formless] realm of nothingness.
Then Hastiśāriputra said to the Buddha:
O World-honored One, now I take my refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and
Sangha. As I wish to become a lay devotee, may Your Reverence accept me
as a lay devotee in the right Dharma. From this moment until the dissolution

of my body at the end of life, I will refrain from taking life, I will refrain  
from taking what is not given, I will refrain from indulging in sexual  
pleasure, I will refrain from speaking falsehoods, and I will refrain from  
ingesting intoxicants.  
Poṭṭhapāda then asked the Buddha, “Sir, is it possible for me to renounce  
domestic life and receive higher ordination?”  
The Buddha replied:  
If someone who has followed a different religious order wishes to be  
ordained in this Dharma, he must remain a probationer for a period of  
four months, observing [how to go about the life of the sangha] and receiv-  
ing appraisal of its members. After that, he may be allowed to renounce  
domestic life and receive higher ordination. This is the regular proceeding,  
and it is simply for the sake of examining the character of a new convert.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic said:  
[Sir, I understand that] someone who has followed a different religious  
order and wishes to renounce domestic life to receive higher ordination in  
the Buddha’s religion must remain a probationer for a period of four months,  
observing [how to go about the life of the sangha] and receiving the appraisal  
of its members. After that, he may be allowed to renounce domestic life  
and receive higher ordination. For my part, I would not mind remaining a  
probationer for four years if I could take the vow of renunciation and  
receive higher ordination after thoroughly observing how to go about the  
life of the sangha and receiving the due approval of its members.  
The Buddha said:  
I spoke about the rule because there is such a rule, but it is only for eval-  
uating the character of a new convert. [In your case, no probationary  
period is needed.]  
Poṭṭhapāda was allowed to immediately renounce domestic life and receive  
higher ordination, and he carried out the practice of pure and genuine austerity  
with firm determination. Before too long, he directly experienced the termi-  
nation of the cause of birth and death in the present life; his practice of

austerity was complete; that which must be done [for religious salvation]  
was accomplished; and, having realized the ultimate state of arhatship, for  
him there was no more birth.  
At that time, having heard the Buddha’s teaching, Poṭṭhapāda was delighted  
to receive it and reverentially carried out what the Buddha taught.
