### Kalyāṇa-jātika

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 31: Siṅgālovāda Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was sojourning on Vulture Peak  
in the city of Rājagṛha, together with one thousand two hundred and fifty  
disciples. At that time, at the appropriate time, the World-honored One,  
wearing the _saṃghāṭī_ robe and with his almsbowl in hand, entered the city  
and proceeded for almsround. There was a son of a wealthy family in Rājagṛha,  
Kalyāṇa-jātika^20 by name. Early in the morning he went out of the city, reached  
the park grove, made an excursion there, and then, after bathing in water and  
moistening his entire body, he bowed toward all directions: east, west, south,  
north, above, and below, completing the same veneration without exception.  
At that time, the World-honored One happened to be in the grove that  
belonged to Kalyāṇa-jātika, the son of the wealthy family, and having seen  
him carry out his morning rite, [the Buddha] said to Kalyāṇa-jātika:

Why have you gone out of the city in the early morning, bathed to moisten
your body in this grove, and conducted the rite of bowing toward all
directions?
Kalyāṇa-jātika replied to the Buddha:
When my father died, he left his advice to me as his will: “If you wish
to carry out a certain rite, you should make your veneration toward the
directions of east, west, south, north, above and below.” I have been
faithfully upholding my father’s instruction, sir. Thus, after bathing, join-
ing palms respectfully, I venerate all the directions, without exception,
in the order of the east, south, west, north as well as above and below.
The World-honored One said to Kalyāṇa-jātika:
O son of the wealthy family, your rite of veneration has only directional
links. Though I do not deny the meaningfulness of your rite, I say that

there is a similar, yet distinct in meaning, form of the rite belonging to  
the wise and saintly in my religious practice.  
Kalyāṇa-jātika said to the Buddha, “May the World-honored One please  
teach me the veneration of the six directions that is practiced by the wise and  
saintly.”  
The Buddha replied to the son of the wealthy family, “Listen attentively,  
you should retain and consider well the following. I shall give you an account  
of the practice.”  
Kalyāṇa-jātika replied, “Yes, sir. My wish [for you to teach me the rite]  
is realized.”  
The Buddha continued:  
If a wealthy person, or a son [or daughter] of a wealthy family knows  
what the four kinds of action defilement ( _karma-kleśa_ ) are and does not  
commit any of the four bases of evil action, and also if he knows what  
the six kinds of detrimental action against prosperity and wealth are,  
and does not commit any of the six detrimental actions, O Kalyāṇa-  
jātika, such is called the “six directional rites of veneration” to be practiced  
by the wise and saintly. If your life in this world is good you are bound  
to acquire good rewards. What you have undertaken as your [livelihood]  
in this life will also be your undertaking in the next life. In the present  
life, if you acquire a single reward as commended by the knowledgeable,  
then at your death you will be reborn in a good place in the heavens.  
O Kalyāṇa-jātika, you should know that the four kinds of defiled  
actions are (1) taking life (killing), (2) taking what is not given (stealing),  
(3) committing sexual impropriety, and (4) engaging in false speech.  
What are the four bases of evil action? They are (1) desire, (2) anger,  
(3) fear, and (4) delusion. If a wealthy person or the son [or daughter]  
of a wealthy family should commit an offense of [any of] these evil  
actions, that action will inevitably lead to the loss or exhaustion of their  
wealth and prosperity.  
Having thus exhorted, the Buddha repeated it in verse:  
If one is hampered by four kinds of bases of evil conduct,  
Namely, desire, anger, fear, and delusion,

His fame and popularity will decline every day
Just as the waning moon proceeds toward its total extinction.

The Buddha again said to Kalyāṇa-jātika:

If a wealthy person or the son [or daughter] of a wealthy family does
not commit any offense in these bases of evil action, there will be increase
and development of their wealth and prosperity.

Again the World-honored One composed a verse:

If one does not commit any offense
Of the defilements of desire, anger, fear, and delusion,
His fame grows and increases every day
Just as the waxing moon proceeds toward its round perfection.

The Buddha said to Kalyāṇa-jātika:

The six kinds of detrimental action against prosperity and wealth are
(1) ingesting intoxicants, (2) gambling, (3) wasting one’s wealth, (4)
enchantment by music and dance, (5) associating with bad characters,
and (6) being indolent and idle. These are the six detrimental actions to
prosperity and wealth. O Kalyāṇa-jātika, if a wealthy person or the son
[or daughter] of a wealthy family understands what the four defiled
actions are, refrains from committing an offense of any of the four bases
of evil action, and also knows these six detrimental actions to wealth
and prosperity, he will become free from the four bases of evil action
and will venerate all six directions. If your life in this world is good,
you are bound to acquire good rewards. What you have undertaken as
your [livelihood] in this life will also be your undertaking in the next
life. In the present life, if you acquire a single reward as commended by
the knowledgeable, at your death you will be reborn in a good place in
the heavens.
O Kalyāṇa-jātika, you should know that drinking intoxicants results
in six kinds of loss: (1) loss of wealth, (2) becoming prone to illness,
(3) being drawn into fights and disputes, (4) having a bad reputation
that spreads, (5) being unable to control outbursts of anger and rage,
and (6) the diminishing of wisdom each day. O Kalyāṇa-jātika, if a

wealthy person or the son [or daughter] of a wealthy family continues
to ingest intoxicants without stopping, his family business will lose
productivity each day.
O Kalyāṇa-jātika, playing dice in gambling results in six kinds of
loss: (1) exhausting one’s wealth each day, (2) if succesful in gambling,
creating enmity, (3) being reprimanded by the wise, (4) others will not
believe or respect those who gamble, (5) being avoided by and alienated
from the people of society, (6) giving rise to a mentality that inclines
toward [committing] theft. O Kalyāṇa-jātika, these are called the six
kinds of loss resulting from gambling. If a wealthy person or the son [or
daughter] of a wealthy family continues to engage in gambling, his
family business will lose productivity each day.
Dissipation results in six kinds of loss: (1) one does not protect himself,
(2) one does not protect his wealth and property, (3) one does not protect
his descendants, (4) he is always fearful and frightens others, (5) he
becomes entangled in the evil psychophysical elements, resulting in suf-
fering, and (6) he easily and willingly succumbs to delusion. These are
called the six kinds of dissipation. If a wealthy person or the son [or
daughter] of a wealthy family should continue to dissipate, his family
business will lose productivity each day.
O Kalyāṇa-jātika, enchantment by music and dancing results in six
kinds of loss: one seeks for (1) songs, (2) dances, (3) string instruments,
(4) hand-played instruments, (5) drums and percussive instruments, and
(6) telling stories. These are called the six kinds of loss caused by music
and dance. If a wealthy person or the son [or daughter] of a wealthy
family should continue to be enchanted by the entertainment of music
and dance, his family business will lose its productivity each day.
Association with bad characters also results in six kinds of loss: (1)
contriving deception, (2) preferring secret meetings, (3) inducing others
to engage with bad groups, (4) cheating others for one’s own profit, (5)
pursuing after undue wealth and profit, and (6) taking delight in exposing
others’ faults. These are called the six kinds of loss caused by association
with bad characters. If a wealthy man or a son of a wealthy family should
continue to associate himself with bad characters, his family business
will lose productivity each day.

Indolence results in six kinds of loss: (1) no effort in work because
of having wealth and an easy life, (2) no effort in work because of poverty,
(3) no motivation for effort because of cold weather, (4) no effort because
of hot weather, (5) no effort because of the early morning, and (6) no
effort because of the late afternoon. These are called the six kinds of
loss caused by indolence. If a wealthy person or the son [or daughter]
of a wealthy family should continue to be indolent, his family business
will lose productivity each day.

Having thus exhorted, the Buddha again composed the following verses:

Beguiled by intoxicating liquors,
One will be surrounded by drinking companions.
Having accumulated wealth through right means,
One will distribute it until it is exhausted.
Drinking liquor, one loses discipline,
Always delighting in song and dance.
Visiting others’ houses in the daytime,
One falls and is trapped in a pit.
Swayed by bad characters,
One cannot reform his conduct,
Slandering mendicant wanderers,
Holding wrong views that will be laughed at in the world,
Impure action is what people shun.
Judging people based only on their good or bad external appearance,
Arguing about nothing but gambling,
Keeping company with bad characters,
None of whom would urge one to forsake gambling,
Impure action is what people shun.
Beguiled by intoxicating liquors,
Forgetting to measure the degree of one’s poverty,
Slighting the weight of one’s wealth,
Accustomed to a degree of extravagance,
Thus one destroys his household and
Surmounts it with troubles and disaster.
Associating with a gambling party,

Combined with the habit of drinking,
One ends up together with others at a brothel,
Accustomed to vulgar and lowly behavior,
His life goes down like a waning moon proceeding to extinction.
Doing evil things, seeing evil things,
One commits evil actions alongside with bad characters,
He gains nothing from beginning to an end,
In this world as well as in the next.
Indulging in sleep during the day,
Waking late in the night with unwholesome expectations,
Being alone in the darkness, with no good friend,
He is unable to keep up his household.
Though he recognizes the things to be done in the morning or
in the evening,
Yet he leaves them undone,
When it is cold or hot, he neither begins nor completes
The tasks he needs to do, idly postponing them,
Thus throwing away an opportunity for success.
Without taking account of cold or heat,
If he strives to do things in the morning or in the evening,
There would be nothing that cannot be accomplished,
Nor would there be any worry, having thus realized the goal.
The Buddha said to Kalyāṇa-jātika:
There are four kinds of enemies who appear to be one’s close friends.
You should recognize their behavior. What are these four? They are (1)
one who seeks a better shelter out of greed, (2) one who flatters with
appealing words, (3) one who acts with deceptive obedience, and (4)
one who is a bad character.
[Again] the Buddha said to Kalyāṇa-jātika:
There are four types of seeking shelter out of greed. What are these four?
They are (1) initially giving but later on stealing, (2) giving a little but
demanding much more in return, (3) following the stronger out of fear,

and (4) being a companion [to someone] in the hope of gaining some-
thing. These are the four types of seekers of shelter, through which an
enemy seeks association.
[Again] the Buddha said to Kalyāṇa-jātika:
There are four kinds of flattery with appealing words. What are these
four? They are (1) agreeing with an associate as to good and bad with
no discrimination, (2) abandoning an associate when there is difficulty
and trouble, (3) secretly hindering an associate from taking an alternative
good course, and (4) refusing to rescue an associate experiencing a crisis.
These are the four types of flattery through which an enemy seeks asso-
ciation. There are four kinds of deceptive obedience [in words but not
in action]. What are these four? They are (1) deception in the beginning,
(2) deception later on, (3) deception when witnessing against [someone],
and (4) punishing [someone] for the slightest fault. These are the four
types of deceptive obedience through which an enemy seeks association.
There are four kinds of bad characters [with whom one may associate].
What are these four? They are (1) someone with whom one is acquainted
when drinking, (2) someone with whom one is acquainted when gam-
bling, (3) someone with whom one is acquainted when procuring pros-
titutes, and (4) someone with whom one is acquainted when indulging
in entertaining songs and dances. These are the four types of bad char-
acters with whom one may seek association.

Having thus exhorted, the World-honored One again composed verses:

Those bad characters who seek out a better shelter from one,
Speak flattering words for the same reason,
Behave with deceptive obedience likewise, and
Become acquainted in questionable circumstances.
One cannot rely on them.
The wise should recognize them always and
Distance themselves from them,
Just as when avoiding taking a dangerous shortcut on a long journey.

The Buddha said to Kalyāṇa-jātika:

There are four kinds of true friends with whom you should associate,  
who are beneficial and provide relief and protection. What are these  
four? They are (1) one who urges restraint in cases of wrongdoing, (2)  
who is merciful and sympathetic, (3) who gives benefit to others, and  
(4) one who shares both the happiness and misery of others. These are  
true friends who assist by calling for restraint in cases of wrongdoing  
and benefit others variously, and who offer relief and protection. One  
should always associate with these kind of friends.  
O Kalyāṇa-jātika, there are four kinds of association with those who  
provide benefit, relief, and protection. What are these four? They are (1)  
one who restrains others from committing wrongdoing, (2) one who  
shows the norm of honesty, (3) one who has mercy and is sympathetic,  
and (4) one who teaches the path to rebirth in the heavens. Such a friend  
is one who restrains others from wrongdoing, benefits others, and provides  
relief and protection. Again next, there are four kinds of merciful sym-  
pathy: (1) rejoicing with others who receive benefit, (2) being concerned  
about their wrongdoing, (3) praising their virtues, and (4) restraining  
those who are eager to expose others’ wrongdoing. These are the four  
types of merciful sympathy, which are beneficial and provide relief and  
protection. There are four kinds of benefits. What are these four? They  
are (1) assisting one in self-restraint, (2) guarding against someone expend-  
ing and losing their wealth, (3) providing support for someone so that  
they may be free from fear, and (4) giving mutual warning and advising  
others privately. These are the four types of providing benefit, relief, and  
protection. There are four types of sharing others’ happiness and misery.  
What are these four? They are (1) giving unsparingly of one’s own life  
and body for others, (2) giving unsparingly of one’s own wealth for others,  
(3) removing any source of fear for others, and (4) offering mutual warning  
and advice for others privately. These are the four types of sharing hap-  
piness and misery that provide benefit, relief, and protection.  
Having thus exhorted, the World-honored One composed the following  
verses:

Restraining wrongdoing prevents close association with bad
characters,

With merciful sympathy, there is true association with others,
Whoever is beneficial to others increases that association,
Simultaneously establishing an association among equals.
This kind of friendly association should be promoted,
It is such associations in which the wise abide,
The friendly association that is incomparable,
Yet is comparable to a merciful mother accompanying her child.
If one wishes to have such associations,
He [or she] should seek a friend who is spiritually well established,
Through whose association one acquires precepts,
Just as if the light of a flame illuminates him.

The Buddha said to Kalyāṇa-jātika:

You should know the six directions. What are these six? One’s father
and mother are in the eastern direction, one’s teacher and elder are in
the southern direction, one’s wife and children are in the western direction,
one’s close friends are in the northern direction, one’s servants are in
the downward direction, and one’s religious guides ( śramaṇa or brāh-
maṇa ) are in the upward direction.
O Kalyāṇa-jātika, as a child of one’s parents, you should be filial to
them in terms of five norms. What are these five? They are (1) to support
one’s parents so that they are free from privation, (2) to confide in them
whatever one wishes to do, (3) to be obedient to them in whatever they
do [that is right], without opposing them, (4) to not go against their right
livelihood, and (5) to continue the same livelihood of one’s parents with-
out cessation. O Kalyāṇa-jātika, one should be filial to one’s parents in
terms of these five norms. Parents also should intimately respect their
children in terms of five norms. What are these five? They are (1) to
restrain their son [or daughter], not permitting them to engage in wrong
conduct, (2) to show what is good by direct instruction, (3) to have their
love permeate their child’s bones and marrow, (4) to seek a good spouse
for them, and (5) to provide their child with whatever is needed at times.
O Kalyāṇa-jātika, if a son [or daughter] is obedient and respectfully
carries out parental instructions, he will be secure, without any fear or
anxiety.

O Kalyāṇa-jātika, a disciple should respect his teacher in terms of
five norms. What are these five? They are (1) providing him with nec-
essary material support, (2) serving him with respect and reverence, (3)
honoring him as above one’s position, (4) respectfully accepting his
instruction without failing, and (5) listening to his teaching and upholding
it. O Kalyāṇa-jātika, being a disciple, one should respect his teacher
according to these norms. A teacher should guide his disciple with respect
in terms of five norms. What are these five? They are (1) cultivating his
student according to the Dharma, (2) teaching what he has not yet heard,
(3) enabling him to understand the meaning of what he has heard, (4)
showing him meritorious friends, and (5) giving him all of one’s knowl-
edge without sparing. O Kalyāṇa-jātika, if a disciple is obedient and
respectfully carrys out his teacher’s instructions, he will be secure,
without any fear or anxiety.
O Kalyāṇa-jātika, a husband should respect his wife in terms of five
norms. What are these five? They are (1) maintaining mutual respect
with one’s wife, (2) maintaing a proper attitude [toward one’s wife], (3)
accompanying her during times of changing clothes and dining, (4) wait-
ing for her preparations for an outing, and (5) entrusting her with house-
hold matters. O Kalyāṇa-jātika, a husband should attend his wife respect-
fully as [outlined] above, and the wife, too, should respect her husband
in terms of five norms. What are these five? They are (1) waking up
before her husband, (2) staying behind him, (3) speaking harmoniously,
(4) following him respectfully, and (5) consulting him before deciding
things. O Kalyāṇa-jātika, if a husband treats his wife with respect as
mentioned above, he will be secure, without any fear or anxiety.
O Kalyāṇa-jātika, a person should be respectful toward his relations
in terms of five norms. What are these five? They are (1) offering gifts,
(2) giving good advice, (3) sharing benefit, (4) acquiring profit equally,
and (5) not deceiving them. O Kalyāṇa-jātika, these are the five norms
through which one should be respectful toward one’s relations. One’s
relations, too, should be respectful toward a member of their family in
terms of five norms. What are these norms? They are (1) guarding
[against] undisciplined conduct, (2) guarding [against] the wasteful loss
of wealth, (3) protecting one who is in fear because of danger, (4) giving

mutual warning and consultation privately, (5) praising others always.  
O Kalyāṇa-jātika, if a member of one’s family respectfully acts toward  
his relatives in the manner [outlined] above, he will be secure, without  
any fear or anxiety.  
O Kalyāṇa-jātika, a master should supervise his servants in terms of  
five norms. What are these five? They are (1) assigning work according  
to their capabilities, (2) providing them with food and drink at proper  
times, (3) rewarding them for their work at times, (4) giving medicine  
when they become ill, and (5) giving them days off from work. These  
are the five ways for supervising one’s servants. Servant workers should  
serve their master in terms of five norms. What are these five? They are  
(1) waking up early in the morning, (2) working with careful attention,  
(3) neither transferring one’s work nor taking work in exchange with  
another worker, (4) following a certain order in conducting their duties,  
and (5) praising the name of their master. These are the ways a master  
should treat his workers. If he treats his workers like this, he will be  
secure, without any fear or anxiety.  
O Kalyāṇa-jātika, a lay devotee should serve _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s  
[according to five norms]. What are these five? They are (1) practicing  
charity through physical work, (2) practicing charity in one’s verbal  
expression, (3) practicing charity through mental alertness, (4) dedicating  
things at times, and (5) not closing one’s house gate [to others]. O  
Kalyāṇa-jātika, just as lay devotees should serve _śramaṇa_ s and _brāh-  
maṇa_ s through the foregoing five norms, the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s  
should teach and guide lay devotees in terms of six norms. What are  
these six? They are (1) helping them refrain from wrongdoing, (2) show-  
ing them what is good, (3) guiding them to cultivate good mentality, (4)  
having them learn [by listening to] the teaching, (5) if they have heard  
teachings, helping them understand its meaning well, and (6) revealing  
the way to heaven for them. O Kalyāṇa-jātika, if a lay devotee serves  
the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s in these ways, he [or she] will be secure,  
without any fear or anxiety.  
Having thus completed his exhortation, the World-honored One again  
composed the following verses:

Father and mother are placed in the eastern direction,
Teachers are in the southern direction,
Wife and children are in the western direction,
Relations are in the northern direction,
Servants are in the downward direction,
Śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s are in the upward direction.
If a son [or daughter] of a wealthy families venerate all the
directions and
Respectfully follow the rite of veneration in regularity,
They will realize heaven upon their deaths.
Gracious charity and sympathetic talk can
Provide people with much gain and advantage,
Sharing benefit together with others,
Equalizing gains between oneself and others,
Letting one’s possessions be open and accessible to others,
These are the four norms, like the wheels [of a cart],
That bear the heavy burden and responsibility.
If there were none of these norms in the world,
There would be no filial piety whatsoever.
These are the four norms chosen by the wise in this world,
Practicing these norms, one may obtain a great result and
His [good] name will spread to far-distant regions.
Setting up a couch for sittting, placing food and drink before it,
Providing whatever is at hand,
Thereby one’s [good] name spreads to far-distant regions.
Excluding none of the older relations,
Showing good benefit in perfect harmony
Toward both one’s seniors and the juniors,
One obtains good fame and reputation.
One should first learn skills and arts, and
Then afterward he will succeed in business transactions,
When one is well established in his business,
He should defend his concerns.
In expending wealth, he should not be extravagant.
When choosing the head [of the workers],

Whoever is deceptive and resistant should not to be recommended,
The accumulation of wealth will rise from a small quantity,
Just as a swarm of bees gathers nectar from flowers.
Wealth is increased every day, having no loss in the end.
First, one should know the proper degree of satisfaction with food;
Second, there should not be any slacking in the practice;
Third, some resources should be set aside
For times of emergency;
Fourth, cultivated land should be put for mercantile transaction,
Marshland should be converted to be pastureland;
Fifth, one should build a commemorative tower and shrine (i.e., a stupa),
Sixth, monastic dwellings should be built.
The laity should commit themselves to the six venerations,
Carrying them out in due order without losing time.
If one practices the discipline in this manner,
The household will not be lost to dissipation,
One’s wealth will increase everyday, just as does the great ocean,
Into which all the rivers on earth flow.

At that time, Kalyāṇa-jātika said to the World-honored One:

It is wonderful, World-honored One. The teaching surpasses my original
wish, and it surpasses my father’s teaching. It enables the defeated to
look up again with hope, it enables a closed heart to open again, and it
enables the deluded to be awakened, just as candlelight illuminates a
dark room and thus one’s eyes are able to perceive again. The exhortation
of the Tathāgata is also like this. In many ways it has illuminated the
darkness of ignorance and revealed the pure white Dharma. Why is this
so? Because the Buddha is the Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened
One he is able to illustrate the truth and is the guide of the world. Now
I shall take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.
O World-honored One, may I now be permitted to become a lay devo-
tee in the right Dharma. From today onward until the end of my life, I
vow not to commit taking life, nor theft, nor engage in sexual misconduct,
nor speak falsehoods, nor ingest intoxicants, sir.

Having listened to the Buddha’s exhortation, Kalyāṇa-jātika respectfully  
received the teaching and carried out what was taught by the Buddha.
