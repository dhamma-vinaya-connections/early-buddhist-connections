### Sutra 3

### A Great Treasury Councilor

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 19: Mahāgovinda Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was sojourning on the [moun-  
taintop called] Vulture Peak in the city of Rājagṛha, together with one thousand  
two hundred and fifty disciples. At that time, the god Pañcaśika, son of Gan-  
dharva, brightly illuminated Vulture Peak with a great ray of light and visited  
the Buddha when the place was all quiet and no one was around. Having  
venerated the Buddha [by bowing] his forehead to [the Buddha’s] feet, he  
withdrew and stood to one side, then said to the Buddha:

The god Brahmā, lord of Brahmā Heaven, recently visited Trāyastriṃśa  
Heaven to consult with the god Indra, lord of that heaven. I happened  
to hear directly from the god Brahmā. Shall I now tell your holiness  
about this matter?  
The Buddha replied, “If you wish to tell me about it, then do so.” Pañca -  
śika thus related the following story:

beyond their control, which thus promoted their well-being while caus-  
ing the advantage of the _asura_ s, the adversarial demigods, to diminish.  
Having observed their joy and delight, the lord Indra said to them,  
“Dear wise citizens, don’t you wish to learn the eight supreme qualities  
that pertain to the Tathāgata?” The Trāyastriṃśa gods replied, “Yes,  
we would be most delighted to hear about them, sir.” The god Indra  
said, “Listen attentively, you should contemplate and remember the  
following.”

At that time, Pañcaśika said to the Buddha:

At that time, the citizens of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven said to the Brahmā  
youth, “We have just heard our lord Indra’s exhortation on the eight  
supreme qualities that pertain to the Tathāgata and have been rejoicing,  
dancing and leaping; we feel as if we are beyond self-control.”  
The Brahmā youth said to the Trāyastriṃśa gods, “What are the  
eight supreme qualities of the Tathāgata? I wish to also hear about  
them, sirs.” Thus, the lord Indra at once also gave him his exhortation  
on the Tathāgata’s eight supreme qualities. Having twice listened to  
Indra’s exhortation, the Trāyastriṃśa gods uncontrollably rejoiced all  
the more at the promotion of their well-being and the diminishment  
of the _asura_ s’ advantage.  
At that time, observing the rejoicing Trāyastriṃśa gods, the Brahmā  
youth also felt more and more joyous, as if he could not stop himself  
from dancing, and at once said to the Trāyastriṃśa gods, “Do you not  
wish to hear about another supreme quality of the Tathāgata?” The  
gods replied, “Excellent, we wish to hear about it!” The boy said to  
them, “Since you do wish to hear about it, listen attentively and I shall  
explain it to you.” He related the following story to the gods:

Diśāṃpati, whose body and mind are impaired by age, has little  
time left before his death. It would not be difficult for the prince to  
succeed to the throne. Go speak to the prince about this matter, say-  
ing, ‘Honorable prince, we were born together with you and  
befriended you from childhood. If your excellence is suffering, we  
too are suffering. If your excellence is happy, we too feel happy.  
Now the king’s body and mind have become impaired, and his age  
is reaching its limit and he has little time left before passing away.  
It would not be difficult for your excellence to succeed to the throne.  
When you ascend the throne, may you also seal the respective ter-  
ritorial lands for our kingdoms.’”  
Thereupon, having listened to this advice, the six _kṣatriya_ min-  
isters at once visited the prince and advised him by explaining the  
foregoing matters. The prince replied, “When I ascend the throne,  
with whom, I wonder, should I consult in order to enumerate the  
lands and allocate the countries?”  
The king died suddenly soon after. The ministers of the state in  
due order supported Pince Reṇu’s ascent to the throne. Having been  
enthroned, the new king thought to himself, “I should now appoint  
someone as my prime minister, following the fashion of the previous  
ruler. Who is capable of this position? The great treasury councilor  
who assisted my father before—he alone should be appointed as  
my prime minister.”  
King Reṇu summoned [the treasury councilor] and said to him,  
“I now appoint you as prime minister and give you the official seal.  
May you, with exertion and care, assume general oversight of the  
governance of state affairs.”  
Having heard to the king’s words, the great treasury councilor  
accepted the seal. It was customary that whenever the king withdrew  
to the rear palace for his pastimes he entrusted the task of governance  
to the prime minister. The great treasury councilor again thought to  
himself, “I should visit the six _kṣatriya_ ministers now and ask them  
if they remember what was said in the past about their feudal lands  
and countries.”

you take on the general oversight of the governance of my state.”  
Thereupon, all six kings each granted their official seals to the great  
treasury councilor. As soon as the latter accepted the official seals,  
the six kings retreated to their rear palaces to enjoy pastimes of  
games and amusements. Thus, entrusted with the task of governance,  
the great treasury councilor assumed general oversight of the gov-  
ernance of all seven countries. There was nothing whatsoever that  
was left incomplete in his stewardship.  
At that time, there were seven wealthy householders within the  
country. The treasury councilor also managed their household affairs  
for them, as well as teaching seven hundred _brāhmaṇa_ s how to recite  
their sutras. The seven kings respectfully treated the great treasury  
councilor as if he were a god, the seven wealthy householders  
regarded him as if he were a great king, and the seven hundred _brāh-  
maṇa_ s looked up to him as if he were the god Brahmā. Then the  
seven kings, seven householders, and seven hundred _brāhmaṇa_ s  
respectively thought to themselves, “The great treasury councilor  
always meets with the god Brahmā, exchanges words with him, and  
sits down and stands up in intimate association with him.”  
The great treasury councilor, however, who quietly knew the  
thoughts of the kings, householders, and _brāhmaṇa_ s, thought to  
himself, “According to their beliefs, I meet often with the god  
Brahmā, exchange words with him, and sit down and stand up in  
intimate association with him. In actuality, however, I have never  
seen the god Brahmā, nor have I exchanged words with him, hence  
I ought not to accept this praise by remaining silent. I also remember  
the words of various learned elders that if one withdraws into a  
secluded place during the four summer months and practices the  
four kinds of immeasurable minds, the god Brahmā will descend  
from his heaven to meet with the practitioner. I should now practice  
the discipline of the four immeasurable minds and see if the god  
Brahmā really will come down to meet with me.”  
Having so decided, the great treasury councilor went to see each  
of the seven kings, requesting of each, “Your majesty, may you take  
over the general oversight of the governance [of your country], for

The Brahmā youth responded in verse:

The great treasury councilor continued in verse:

The Brahmā youth replied again in verse:

Again the god Brahmā said to the great treasury councilor, “If you  
have any questions, ask me as freely as you wish. I shall answer them  
for you.” Thereupon, the great treasury councilor thought to himself,  
“Now, should I ask about the matter of the present life or that of the  
future?” Again he thought to himself, “Sometime later I may ask  
about present life matters. I should instead ask about the future life  
after death.” He thus questioned the Brahmā youth in verse:

At that time, having heard this verse, the treasury councilor thought  
to himself, “I have now understood the meaning of ‘filthiness,’ but  
it is not possible to remove it while living a householder’s life.  
Shouldn’t I now renounce ordinary life, go forth from family ties,  
shave my hair and beard, wear a mendicant’s robe, and practice the  
path of religion?” At that moment, the Brahmā youth knew the coun-  
cilor’s thoughts and related the following in verse:

Thereupon, the Brahmā youth suddenly disappeared. The foremost  
treasury councilor returned to visit the seven kings and said to them,  
“Your majesties, may you make yourselves models in assuming  
oversight of governing state affairs. I am planning to leave family  
life, wear a mendicant’s robe, and practice the path of religion. The  
reason is this, sirs. Recently I happened to listen to the god Brahmā’s  
exhortation on the defiled state of life, and in my mind I despise it.  
As long as I am in the householder’s life there is no possibility of  
removing it totally from my life, sirs.”  
At that time, the seven kings thought to themselves, “The _brāh-  
maṇa_ s in general desire riches and treasures. I should open up the  
state’s storehouses and let him have whatever he wishes, so that he  
will change his mind.” The seven kings said to the treasury councilor,  
“If you need anything, I will give you whatever you wish. You  
should not leave the householder’s life.”  
The treasury councilor replied to the kings, “I have now already  
received your generous offer. I have my own riches and treasures,  
sirs, but I shall present all of them to your majesties as my gift. May  
I request your majesties to accept my petition so that I may realize  
the goal of my pursuit, sirs.”  
Then the seven kings thought to themselves, “The _brāhmaṇa_ s  
in general desire fancy food. I should provide him with some palace

At that time, the great treasury councilor responded in verse:

King Reṇu replied in verse:

The treasury councilor replied in verse:

Then King Reṇu told him in verse:

Then the great treasury councilor said in verse:

Thereupon, the great treasury councilor visited the seven wealthy  
householders and said to them, “Dear householders, you should  
handle your household affairs by yourselves. I shall be leaving  
family life and will practice the path to realize the goal of uncon-  
ditioned transcendence. The reason is that recently I happened to  
listen to the god Brahmā’s exhortation on the defilement of life, and  
in my mind I despise it. As long as I am in the householder’s life  
there is no possibility of totally removing it from my life.”  
The seven householders replied to the treasury councilor, “Your  
decision is splendid. You should know when it is the right time. We  
wish to renounce our family ties at the same time, together with  
you, sir. In whatever you do, we shall follow and do the same.”  
Then the great treasury councilor also visited the seven hundred  
_brāhmaṇa_ s and said to them, “Gentlemen, you should exert your-  
selves in the practice of reciting sutras, search for the meaning of  
morality, and teach among yourselves. I shall be leaving family life  
to practice the path and realize the goal of unconditioned transcen-  
dence. The reason is that recently I happened to listen to the god  
Brahmā’s exhortation on the defilement of life, and in my mind I  
despise it. As long as I am in the householder’s life, there is no pos-  
sibility of totally removing it from my life.”  
The seven hundred _brāhmaṇa_ s said to the treasury councilor,  
“Great teacher, you should not renounce family life. The house-  
holder’s life is much easier, and one is entitled to enjoy the five  
senses. In the householder’s life many people attend and take care  
of you, and you do not have to suffer or worry about anything. [In  
contrast,] those who renounce family life have to live in the wilder-  
ness, neither desiring anything, nor grasping anything because of  
desire.”  
The treasury councilor replied, “If I consider the householder’s  
life as a happy one, I would regard its renunciation as suffering,  
and thus eventually discard such an idea myself. But it is solely  
because I consider the householder’s life to be suffering and its  
renunciation to be happiness that I shall take the course of forsaking  
the householder’s life.”

The visitor Pañcaśika said:

The Buddha replied to Pañcaśika:

and, returning to this world seven times, shall surely realize final nirvana  
on the last return.  
O Pañcaśikha, those among my disciples who have renounced family  
ties in genuine faith will receive reward and instruction, investigate  
the methods of the path, thoroughly carry out the practice of austerity,  
seek the ultimate place of security and peace, and thus finally return  
to nirvana.  
At that time, having listened to the Buddha’s exhortation, Pañcaśikha was  
delighted and respectfully followed what had been instructed.
