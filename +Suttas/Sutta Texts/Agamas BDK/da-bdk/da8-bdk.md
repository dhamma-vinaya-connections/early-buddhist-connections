### Sutra 8

### Sandhāna

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 25: Udumbarika-

#### Sīhanāda Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was sojourning at the Saptaparṇa  
Cave on Vulture Peak in the city of Rājagṛha, together with one thousand  
two hundred and fifty disciples. There was a householder, Sandhāna by name,  
in that city, who enjoyed making an excursion every day to go out of the city  
and visit the Buddha. One such day, when the householder looked up at the  
sun’s position, he quietly thought to himself:

Now would not be a proper time for me to visit the Buddha. By this  
time, his holiness is surely retired in a secluded room for his daily con-  
templation and concentration. The disciple _bhikṣu_ s should also be  
engaged in their practice of quiet meditation. I should instead visit  
Queen Udumbarikā’s pleasure garden set aside for _brāhmaṇa_ wanderers.  
When the proper time comes, I will visit the World-honored One and  
greet him with devotion and respect, and in addition also visit the  
_bhikṣu_ s to greet them with respect.  
At that time, a _brāhmaṇa_ , Nyagrodha by name, was staying in that grove  
together with five hundred _brāhmaṇa_ ascetics. The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetics had  
gathered there and were involved in massive arguments with loud voices on  
various nonreligious topics, thus passing many hours, all day long. Some  
argued about matters of state, while others argued about battles and weapons,  
still others on matters of justice and peace between the states, or on matters  
of ministers and people, or on such topics as carriages, horses, and excursions  
to groves and forests, or seating, clothing, food and drink, or about women,  
or about mountains, oceans, and the carapace of a turtle. They thus spent the  
whole day doing nothing but talking about such nonreligious matters.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ Nyagrodha saw from afar the householder Sandhāna  
approaching them and at once ordered the members of the assembly to be

quiet, saying, “The lay disciple of the _śramaṇa_ Gautama now coming from  
outside is the foremost among Gautama’s lay devotees. He surely will come  
here, you should all quiet down.” Then all the _brāhmaṇa_ s stopped talking.  
The householder Sandhāna reached the place of the _brāhmaṇa_ Nyagrodha,  
and, after greeting him, sat to one side and said to him:

My master, the World-honored One, always enjoys leisure and quietude  
and does not like noisy confusion like this. He does not act in the way  
that you do, putting yourself among your disciples who are arguing in  
loud voices on various nonreligious topics.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ responded to the householder:  
_Śramaṇa_ Gautama has never debated with others. [So] how can the  
public know that the _śramaṇa_ is [really] in possession of great insight?  
Your teacher prefers to stay alone in a secluded place, just like a one-  
eyed cow that roams alone and onesidedly turns [in a circle] only the  
part of the grass field that comes into its vision. Your teacher Gautama  
is like that cow, because he likes to stay alone in an isolated place  
where no other person is around. If your teacher happens to come here,  
I shall call him “One-eyed cow.” He always claims that he has great  
insight. [But] with a single word I will surely cause him to be at a loss  
and pursue him until he surrenders like a turtle withdrawn into its cara-  
pace. I say that with a single shot of an arrow it would be no trouble  
to cause him to be at a loss for a way out.  
At that time, the World-honored One was alone in his meditation room  
and, he heard through his supernormal hearing what the _brāhmaṇa_ told the  
householder. He at once came out of the Saptaparṇa Cave and traveled to  
the Udumbarikā Grove. The _brāhmaṇa_ saw the Buddha from a distance  
approaching the Udumbarikā Grove. He ordered his disciples:

you originally taught your disciples so that they may acquire the state  
of comfort and tranquility and practice moral and religious austerity?”  
The Buddha eventually reached the grove. Then, unintentionally, the _brāh-  
maṇa_ himself stood up, received the World-honored One, and uttered the  
following words of welcome:

O Gautama, welcome. O _śramaṇa_ , welcome. I have seen you for a  
long time. For what purpose have you come here, sir? Please take a  
seat here at the front.  
The World-honored One at once sat on the seat as invited, and laughed  
cheerfully. He quietly thought to himself:

These foolish men cannot even uphold their [intended] actions on their  
own terms. Despite planning a cool reception for me, they have behaved  
contrary to their intent. It is because, before the Buddha’s supernormal  
power, their minds of ill intent have spontaneously been broken.  
The householder Sandhāna venerated the Buddha by bowing to his feet  
and then sat to one side. The _brāhmaṇa_ Nyagrodha greeted the Buddha with  
a bow, then sat on the other side and asked him:

tradition as a whole) to practice the disciplines of the path to comprise  
purity as well as impurity? I can explain them exhaustively.  
Then all five hundred disciples of the _brāhmaṇa_ clamored in raising their  
voices, saying:

O _śramaṇa_ Gautama, you boast of your greatness and supernormal  
power, to the extent that when you are asked about your teaching, you  
set aside [the queston] and instead challenge us to explain our teaching!  
The _brāhmaṇa_ Nyagrodha then said to the Buddha, “Very well, Gautama,  
please analyze and explain what you mean by that.”  
The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa,_ “Listen attentively. I shall explain it  
for you.” The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “Delighted, sir. I am ready [to listen], sir.”  
The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa:_

you wear an antelope hide. You let your hair grow, or cover your body  
with a net made of hair, or you wear clothing taken from a corpse.  
Some of you keep your arms lifted at all times, or never sit on a couch  
or chair but only in a squatting position. Even if you shave your head  
you keep both moustache and beard. You lay on a bed of thorns or on  
a floor covered with plant husks, or you lay down naked in cow dung,  
or you bathe three times a day or three times during the night. You  
mortify your body with extreme physical pain and suffering. How  
indeed, O Nyagrodha, are these forms of practice regarded as genuine,  
pure disciplines?  
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “These disciplines are pure and genuine and are  
not contrary, sir.”  
The Buddha sid to the _brāhmaṇa,_ “Though you claim that these forms of  
practice are pure and genuine disciplines, I will explain to you why they are  
morally defiled.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “Very well, Gautama, explain why our forms of  
practice are morally impure and defiled. I wish to know about it.”  
The Buddha continued:  
The ascetics engaged in self-mortifying forms of practice invariably  
entertain an expectation in their mind, thinking, “My ascetic practice  
should persuade people to make offerings with respect and admiration  
[for my austerities].” This expectation is by nature a moral defilement.  
Having received an offering, satisfied and reinforced, these extreme  
ascetics are firmly attached to their extreme forms of practice, neither  
knowing how it is important to distance oneself from worldly matters,  
nor knowing what the essential path of salvation is. This wrong orien-  
tation is a moral defilement.  
If they see anyone near them or approaching them from a distance,  
these extreme ascetics invariably assume their [arduous] practice of  
meditation, but in the absence of other people they resume their undis-  
ciplined behavior, idly sitting or lying about according to their incli-  
nation. This is a moral defilement.  
Even when they hear a precise exposition of their doctrine by others,  
they do not acknowledge that it is correct. This is a moral defilement.

How then, Nyagrodha, can these manners of practice be said to be  
morally free of blemish?  
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “These are morally defiled and cannot be said to  
be pure and genuine [practices], sir.”  
The Buddha continued, “Now, in reference to each of those morally defiled  
forms of practice, I shall explain what the morally pure and genuine nature is.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “Please explain them one by one, sir.”  
The Buddha continued:  
These ascetics should cherish no expectation in their minds and aban-  
don the thought, “My practice should bring me offerings, respect, and  
admiration.” This nonanticipatory practice is free from moral defile-  
ment.  
After receiving offerings, these ascetics should not greedily attach  
themselves to extreme forms of practice.They should become aware  
of the importance of distancing themselves from worldly matters,  
knowing what the essential path of salvation is. This right orientation  
is free from moral defilement.  
These ascetics should maintain regularity in the practice of medi-  
tation, whether or not other people are present or absent. This form of  
discipline is free from moral defilement.  
These ascetics should be delighted when followers of other schools  
have a correct understanding of their doctrines, and they should readily  
acknowledge this. This discipline is free from moral defilement.  
These ascetics should be delighted when an appropriate question  
is presented and they should openly answer and explain it. This disci-  
pline is free from moral defilement.  
Seeing others offering charity to the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s,  
these ascetics should rejoice in the moral and religious advancement  
expressed in such acts of charity, instead of discouraging the donors.  
This discipline is free from moral defilement.  
Seeing the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s who partake of various seed  
items that regrow as food, these ascetics should not accuse them. This  
discipline is free from moral defilement.

The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “May I request you to explain the progressive stages  
of restraint in the ascetic practice in analogy with a tree.”  
The Buddha said, “Listen carefully. I shall explain it to you.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “Yes, sir. I am ready.”  
The Buddha continued:  
O _brāhmaṇa_ , each of these ascetics does not himself commit murder  
nor persuade others to do so; neither does he himself commit theft nor  
persuade others to do so; neither does he himself commit sexual mis-  
conduct nor persuade others to do so; neither does he himself speak  
falsehoods nor persuade others to do so. Instead he permeates friendly  
love infinitely in one quarter of the world, then likewise in the remaining  
three quarters. Thus he extends his immeasurable mind of benevolence  
universally in all directions, undivided and not bound to limitation.  
Without enmity, his mind of benevolence permeates throughout the  
human world, and so do his immeasurable mind of compassion, his  
immeasurable mind of sympathetic joy, and his immeasurable mind  
of equanimity [pervade] in a similar manner throughout the human  
world. These are regarded as the progressive stages of restraint in the  
tree analogy of ascetic practice.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ said to the Buddha, “Please explain the essence of ascetic  
practice, sir.”  
The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa,_ “Listen attentively. I shall explain it  
to you.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “Yes, World-honored One, I am ready, sir.”  
The Buddha continued:  
Each of these ascetics neither himself commits murder nor persuade  
another to do so; neither does he himself commit theft nor persuade  
others to do so; neither does he himself commit sexual misconduct nor  
persuade others to do so; neither does he himself speak falsehoods nor  
persuade others to do so. Instead he permeates friendly love infinitely  
in one quarter of the world, then likewise in the remaining three quarters.  
Thus he extends his immeasurable mind of benevolence universally in  
all directions, undivided and not bound to limitation. Without enmity,  
his mind of benevolence permeates throughout the human world, and

so do his immeasurable minds of compassion, of sympathetic joy, and  
of equanimity [pervade] in a similar manner throughout the human world.  
This ascetic becomes aware of things that happened since imme-  
morial past eons, and entirely knows all those events during his initial  
life, second life, and so forth, up to his innumerable positions in the  
life cycle. Throughout those periods from the beginning to the end of  
many eons he himself knows through direct perception: “I was once  
born in such-and-such a class status, had such-and-such name, ate  
meals consisting of such-and-such food, lived so-and-so many years  
of age, and experienced such-and-such happiness and suffering. I was  
reborn from that state to this one, then reborn from that to this, and in  
this manner I recollect exhaustively all the things that happened through-  
out immeasurable numbers of eons.”  
This, O _brāhmaṇa_ , is the essential core of ascetic practice that is  
imperishable.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ spoke to the Buddha, “What is the primary of ascetic prac-  
tice, sir?”  
The Buddha replied, “O _brāhmaṇa_ , listen attentively. I shall explain it to  
you.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “Yes, World-honored One, I am ready, sir.”  
The Buddha continued:  
Each of these ascetics neither himself commits murder nor does he per-  
suade another to do so; neither himself commits theft nor persuade  
others to do so; neither himself commits sexual misconduct nor persuades  
others to do so, neither himself speaks falsehoods nor persuades others  
to do so. Instead he permeates friendly love infinitely in one quarter of  
the world, then likewise in the remaining three quarters. Thus he extends  
his immeasurable mind of benevolence universally in all directions,  
undivided and not bound to limitation. Without enmity, his mind of  
benevolence permeates throughout the human world, and so do his  
immeasurable minds of compassion, of sympathetic joy and of equa-  
nimity [pervade] in a similar manner throughout the human world.  
This ascetic becomes aware of things that have happened since  
immemorial past eons, and entirely knows all those events during his

initial life, second life, and so forth, up to his innumerable positions  
in the life cycle, throughout the periods from the beginning to the end  
of many eons. He also knows through direct perception: “I was once  
born in such-and-such class status, had such-and-such family name,  
ate meals consisting of such-and-such food, lived to so-and-so many  
years of age, and experienced such-and-such happiness and suffering.  
I was reborn from that state to this one, and reborn from that to this,  
and in this manner I recollect exhaustively all the things that happened  
throughout immeasurable numbers of eons.”  
With his pure and genuine heavenly vision he exhaustively perceives  
and knows the kinds of sentient beings as passing away here and being  
reborn there, as endowed with good complexions, handsome or ugly,  
with resulting courses of life due to their good or bad deeds, wherever  
they fall due to their deeds. Also he knows how some of those sentient  
beings who committed wrong physical, verbal, and mental deeds, speak-  
ing slanderous remarks against the wise and holy and believing in per-  
verse, wrong views, fell into the three evil courses of life when their  
bodies dissolved and their lives ended. He also knows how other sentient  
beings who have accumulated good physical, verbal, and mental deeds,  
who speak no evil against the wise and holy and hold the right view,  
are born among heavenly gods when their bodies dissolved and their  
lives ended. Thus, each practitioner, endowed with pure and genuine  
heavenly vision, perceives [the destinies or fates of] sentient beings,  
wherever they fall according to their deeds, and there is nothing he  
cannot see. This is the primary essence of ascetic practice.  
The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa_ :  
In this foremost primary type of ascetic practice, there is again a superior  
one, on the basis of which I always teach my disciples ( _śrāvaka_ s). Their  
discipline of austerity is based on this superior type of ascetic practice.  
At that moment all of the five hundred disciples of the _brāhmaṇa_ raised  
their voices, saying to each other, “Now the World-honored One seems to  
be the highest, foremost venerable, with whom even our teacher cannot be  
equaled.”

Then the householder Sandhāna said to the _brāhmaṇa:_  
You said to me before, “If Gautama comes here, I will call him ‘One-  
eyed Cow.’ Now that the World-honored One is here, why don’t you call  
him [by that name]? Also, you said before, “I surely will cause him to  
be at a loss with a single word, and pursue him until he surrenders like  
a turtle withdrawn into its carapace. It will be no trouble for me, with a  
single shot of an arrow I can surely cause him to be at a loss for a way  
out.” Why can you not now, with a single word, cause the Tathāgata to  
be at a loss?  
The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa,_ “Do you remember that you said such  
a thing before?”  
He replied, “I really said so, sir.”  
The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa:_  
Haven’t you heard from your _brāhmaṇa_ elders that buddhas and tathā-  
gatas reside alone in forest hermitages and enjoy a secluded location,  
just as I enjoy a life of seclusion, quite opposite to your way of living  
in which you enjoy congestion, noisiness, speak of useless matters,  
and thereby pass the hours of the day?  
The _brāhmaṇa_ said:  
Yes, sir. I have heard that the buddhas of the past enjoyed seclusion  
and quietude and lived their solitary lives in forest hermitages, just as  
the World-honored One does. It is certainly not like our way of living  
in which we enjoy congestion and noisiness, speak of useless matters,  
and thus pass the hours of the day, sir.  
The Buddha further said to the _brāhmaṇa:_  
You should keep the following in your mind: the _śramaṇa_ Gautama  
teaches the doctrine of enlightenment well, has himself accomplished  
self-control and helps others learn self-control, has himself realized  
mental calmness and helps others calm their minds, has himself crossed  
the water to reach the yonder shore and helps others cross to the yonder  
shore, has himself attained liberation of his consciousness and helps

others liberate their consciousnesses, and has himself realized the ulti-  
mate goal of nirvana and helps others realize ultimate nirvana.  
At that moment, the _brāhmaṇa_ rose from his seat, venerated the Buddha  
by bowing to the Buddha’s feet and, holding the Buddha’s feet in his hands,  
he announced his name, saying, “I am a _brāhmaṇa_ , Nyagrodha by name. I  
now venerate the World-honored One by bowing to his feet.”  
The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa,_ “Stop, Nyagrodha. Remain seated,  
and just let your liberated mind pay veneration and respect toward me.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ , however, completed a second veneration to the Buddha’s  
feet and then returned to his seat.  
The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa:_  
You should never say that the Buddha exhorted his doctrine of practice  
for the sake of material gain. You should not think so. If there is any  
material donation for [my teaching] I will give all of it to you as charity.  
The doctrine I have exhorted, subtle and foremost, is set forth for the  
sake of terminating wrong practices and promoting good ones.  
Again he said to the _brāhmaṇa:_  
You should never say that the Buddha exhorted his doctrine because  
he wished to protect his fame and keep his name as a religious master,  
or because he wished to acquire new converts [from among your dis-  
ciples] and the members of the sangha. You should not think so. All  
of your disciples are yours. The doctrine I have exhorted is set forth  
for the sake of terminating wrong practices and promoting good ones.  
Again he said to the _brāhmaṇa:_  
You should never say that the Buddha abandoned you in the assembly  
of bad and ignorant people. You should not think so. As far as those  
bad and ignorant members are concerned, you should exclude them  
from your assembly. I have taught only on the essential nature of the  
good practice.  
Again the Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa:_

You should never say that the Buddha has taken these good and genuine  
members away from you. You should not think so. You should carry  
out your practice diligently among those who carry out good practice  
and who are genuine. I have exhorted you on the nature of ascetic prac-  
tice that is good and genuine so as to terminate wrong practices and  
promote good ones.  
At that time, the five hundred disciples of the _brāhmaṇa_ listened eagerly  
and attentively to what the Buddha was teaching. The Evil One Pāpīyān  
thought to himself, “These five hundred disciples of the _brāhmaṇa_ are now  
eagerly and attentively listening to the Buddha’s teaching. I should go and  
disrupt their minds.” Thereupon, the Evil One disrupted the minds of those  
in the assembly.  
At that moment, the Buddha said to Sandhāna:  
While the _brāhmaṇa’_ s five hundred disciples were eagerly and atten-  
tively listening to my teaching, the Evil One Pāpīyān has now disrupted  
their minds. Now I wish to return. You should leave here with me.  
Then the World-honored One touched the householder Sandhāna with his  
right hand, held him within his palm, and flew through space. The householder  
Sandhāna, the _brāhmaṇa_ Nyagrodha, as well as the five hundred _brāhmaṇa_  
disciples who had heard the Buddha’s exhortation, rejoiced, respectfully received  
the teaching, and carried out what was taught by the Buddha.
