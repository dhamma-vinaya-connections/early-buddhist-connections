### Ambaṭṭha

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 3: Ambaṭṭha Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was sojourning in the country  
of Kauśala, accompanied by one thousand two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s.  
On reaching the _brāhmaṇa_ village called Icchānaṅkala, the Buddha and his  
disciples settled in the Icchānaṅkala Grove for an overnight stay.  
At that time, a _brāhmaṇa,_ Puṣkarasārin by name, resided in the village of  
Puṣkarasvādi. The village was a large and prosperous one. It had been granted  
by King Prasenajit to the _brāhmaṇa_ Puṣkarasārin as his fief, and was exempt  
from tax collection. The _brāhmaṇa_ Puṣkarasārin had been born into a pure  
matrimonial lineage of seven generations and was never slighted by anyone  
in society. He was thoroughly versed in the [Vedas,] the three ancient collections  
of hymns, and had detailed knowledge of the various _brāhmaṇa_ scriptures.  
He was also well trained in the physiognomy of a great person, the sacrificial  
rites, and the ceremonial proceedings. He had five hundred student disciples  
and never tired of teaching them. His most able student, who was called  
Ambaṭṭha, had also been born in a pure matrimonial lineage of seven gener-  
ations and was never slighted by anyone in society. He too was thoroughly  
versed in the three [Vedas] and well trained in the physiognomy of a great  
person, the sacrificial rites, and the ceremonial proceedings, and, [like his  
teacher,] he had five hundred student disciples whom he never tired of teaching.  
[In short,] in every way he equaled his teacher.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ Puṣkarasārin then happened to hear the following:  
The _śramaṇa_ Gautama, son of the Śākya clan, renounced domestic life  
to enter religious practice and realized the goal of enlightenment, and  
he has now come to the _brāhmaṇa_ village called Icchānaṅkala in Kauśala  
accompanied by one thousand two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s. They are  
staying in the Ichhānaṅkala Grove for the night. Gautama is renowned  
everywhere with his excellent name as the Tathāgata and is endowed

with the ten titles, such as One Liberated from Attachment (Arhat), Per-
fectly Enlightened One, and so on. He has surpassed all the gods and
humans, the evil ones and their lord [Māra], as well as all śramaṇa s and
brāhmaṇa s, and has himself experienced [ultimate liberation] directly
and teaches his religious path to others. His teaching, whether at the
beginning, the middle, or the end, is endowed with real meaning and
essentials and is harmoniously balanced with the pure and genuine prac-
tice of austerity. Everyone should go see this kind of superior person.
The brāhmaṇa Pokkharasādi thought to himself:
I would rather go to see the śramaṇa Gautama now. It is probably because
he is endowed with the thirty-two eminent marks characteristic of a
superior person that his name has become renowned. I should examine
if all this is true by examining the actual person. I might see some char-
acteristics that are unique to the enlightened.
Again, he thought to himself:
Now, my best disciple Ambaṭṭha was born in a pure matrimonial lineage
of seven generations and is never slighted by anyone in society. He is
thoroughly versed in the three [Vedas] and has detailed knowledge of
the various brāhmaṇa scriptures. He is also well trained in the physiog-
nomy of a great person, the sacrificial rites, and the ceremonial proceed-
ings. I must ask this disciple, who alone will be able to identify the marks
of a buddha, to go see Gautama.
He thus instructed Ambaṭṭha, “Go see Gautama and examine whether or
not it is true that he is endowed with the thirty-two eminent marks of a great
person.”
Ambaṭṭha then asked his teacher, “With what criteria should I investigate
the marks of Gautama to know whether he is really endowed with them, sir?”
The teacher then informed him:
I will now tell you. If a person is endowed with the thirty-two eminent
marks characteristic of a great person, there should be no doubt about
his destiny, such that he will necessarily take either of two careers in
life. If he remains in the householder’s career, he becomes a universal

ruler who turns the sacred wheel ( _cakravartin_ ); he will rule over all four  
quarters of the earth, he will rule the realm of his dominion according  
to the law, govern the people and material wealth, and he will be well  
endowed with the seven kinds of treasures: (1) the golden heavenly  
wheel, (2) the elephant treasure, (3) the horse treasure, (4) the divine  
gem treasure, (5) the jadelike queen treasure, (6) the gentleman house-  
holder treasure, and (7) the military commander treasure. This ruler will  
have a thousand sons who are all valiant, sagacious, and victorious over  
enemies even without [engaging in a] military campaign. With universal  
peace prevailing, there will be no threat to the populace or to their wealth  
and property. If, however, he becomes dissatisfied with household life  
and enters the path of religion, forsaking domestic life, he will become  
the Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One, endowed with the ten  
supreme titles. Applying this [major] criterion, you may examine whether  
or not Gautama's reputation is really true.  
Ambaṭṭha then, with this instruction from his teacher, readied his carriage  
and, accompanied by his five hundred students, he left the village early in  
the morning, heading toward the Icchānaṅkala Grove. On reaching the forest  
he dismounted from the carriage and proceeded on foot to the place of the  
World-honored One. Whenever the Buddha sat down Ambaṭṭha stood up,  
while whenever the Buddha stood up, he took his seat. In this manner the  
two carried out their debate on the meaning and the truth.  
The Buddha spoke to Ambaṭṭha the Mānava [calling him a student], “Do  
you debate with your senior colleagues, teachers, and renowned _brāhmaṇa_ s  
in this manner?”  
Mānava said to the Buddha, “What is this question?”  
The Buddha said to Mānava:  
Whenever I sit down, you stand up, while when I stand up, you sit down.  
Behaving in this manner [constantly], you debate with me. Is this how  
your teacher discusses things with you?  
Mānava answered the Buddha:  
Speaking of our _brāhmaṇa_ manner, I say that if one sits down, the other  
also sits down. If one stands up, the other also stands up. If one lies

down, the other also lies down. But these days the śramaṇa s look phys-
ically emaciated, live without a wife, are vulgar and inferior, and learn
only the manner of those who are dark and ignorant. When I debate with
these people, I do not care whether I am sitting or standing.
At that moment, the World-honored One said to him, “Dear fellow, your
studentship (Mānava) has not become yet civilized.”
When Mānava heard the words “Dear fellow” and “not yet civilized,”
spoken by the World-honored One, he felt infuriated and accused the Buddha,
“The Śākya clansmen are inclined toward malice and do not know proper
manners.”
The Buddha responded to Mānava, “My dear fellow, why can’t the Śākya
clansmen surpass you?”
Mānava replied:
Some years ago I was visiting the country of Kapilavastu of the Śākyas,
for some minor business of my teacher. At that time, many clansmen had
assembled in their meeting hall for some purpose. Though they noticed
me approaching them, they treated me disrespectfully and dismissively.
They neither paid me proper courtesy nor exchanged a mutual greeting.
The Buddha said to Mānava:
Those Śākya clansmen were in their home country, enjoying their freedom
in the pursuit of fun. Just as when wild birds return to their nests in the
forest, they can be free, flying in and out of their nests, so too, can’t the
Śākya clansmen behave as freely as they wish in their pursuit of fun and
play?
Mānava said to the Buddha:
There are four different social classes, namely: the kṣatriya s (nobles),
the brāhmaṇas (priests), the vaiśya s (householders), and the śūdra s (ser-
vants). Although people of [the three other castes] always treat brāhmaṇa s
with respect, reverence, and service, the Śākya clansmen do not conform
this general norm of society. The sons of the Śākya are lowly, like menial
workers, vulgar and inferior, and they do not pay reverence to brāh-
maṇa s.

At that moment, the World-honored One quietly thought to himself:  
This Mānava utters derogatory and abusive words repeatedly, in the way  
that lowly servants speak. I should now tell him the real origin of his  
status and thereby reform him to become more civilized.  
The Buddha then asked Mānava, “What is your familial name?”  
He replied, “My family is Kaṅhāyana.”^23  
The Buddha said to Mānava, “If that is your family name, then your ances-  
tors must be of the caste of servants ( _śūdra_ ) under the Śākya ancestors.”  
At that moment, the five hundred students of Mānava loudly objected to  
the Buddha:

You dare not to say such a thing as that our teacher Mānava is of the  
descendant of the _śūdra_ s who served the Śākya ancestors. Why? Mānava  
is the son of a pure family lineage, endowed with superior facial featurse  
and complexion, with excellent rhetorical skill, extensive knowledge,  
well learned, and capable of arguing back and forth with Gautama.  
At that moment, the World-honored One said to the five hundred students  
of Mānava:

If your teacher is not endowed with all [the qualities] you assert about  
him, I will leave him alone and debate with all of you instead. If your  
teacher is truly endowed with all [the qualities] that you have asserted  
about him, you should remain quiet and I will continue to debate with  
your teacher.  
The five hundred students then replied to the Buddha, “Yes, sir. We will  
remain quiet and listen to your debate with our teacher.” They then all fell  
silent.  
Thereupon, the World-honored One said to Ambaṭṭa:  
Once in the immemorial past, there was a king, Okkāka^24 by name. The  
king had four sons, Okkāmukha, Hatthinīya, Karaṇḍu, and Sīnipura.  
These four princes were exiled by the king due to some minor offense,  
and then traveled to the southern foothills of the Himalayas and abided  
in the forest of _sākasaṇḍa_ trees. The queen mothers of these four princes

and their families all yearned for them. They met to discuss the matter
and then went to King Okkāka, requesting his permission [to go visit
their sons], “Your majesty, it has been a long time since we were separated
from the four princes. We wish to visit them and look after them, sir.”
The king replied, “If you wish to do so, go ahead.”
Having received the king’s permission, the mothers and their relations
at once traveled to the southern foothills of the Himalayas and reached
the residence of the four princes. The mothers proposed [to one another],
“I will give my daughter to your son. Give your daughter to my son,”
and thus they arranged for the princes to marry mutually with their
daughters. Later on, [as a result of these marriages] many sons were
born, having handsome features and good complexions.
When it was reported to King Okkāka that the mothers of the four
princes had gotten them all married with their daughters, who had then
given birth to many handsome sons, he was delighted, saying:
They are truly sons of the Śākya, sons who are truly capable. They
have [successfully] come into existence through their own strength.
They should be called Śākya (“Capable”).^25
King Okkāka was thus an ancestor of the Śākya clansmen. The king
wore a navy-blue garment, called “Direction” or “Pointer,” and was
endowed with handsome features and complexion. He impregnated a
brāhmaṇa woman. When a son, Mānava (i.e., son of Manu) was born,
the child immediately said to his brāhmaṇa mother and father, “Please
bathe me and cleanse the filth from me. When I grow up I shall duly
repay my indebtedness to you.”
Since the child was able to speak immediately after his birth, he was
called “Voicing King.” It was just as today, if a newborn infant speaks at
the moment of birth, people are fearful of the child and call him “Terrifying”
[as if he were demon or goblin, and so on.] Since he spoke [immediately
after his birth] the newborn child was named “Voicing King,” and from
that time onward future generations of his brāhmaṇa lineage made it their
familial name.
The Buddha then said to Mānava, “Haven’t you already heard from your

senior teachers and great _brāhmaṇa_ s this story about the origin of your  
family name?”  
Mānava, however, remained silent and did not answer. The Buddha asked  
him the same question but [again] he did not respond. Before asking him for  
the third time, the Buddha said to Mānava:

I am about to ask the same question for a third time. You should promptly  
reply to me. If not, the _yakṣa_ spirits ( _vajira-pāṇin_ ), who flank me on  
both sides, holding golden pestles in their hands, stand ready to smash  
your head into seven pieces.  
The _yakṣa_ spirits then raised their golden pestles and stood up in midair  
over Mānava’s head. They were ready to smash his head with their pestles  
if Mānava did not answer promptly.  
The Buddha said to Mānava,“Please look up to see [the _yakṣas_ ,” and he  
saw the _yakṣa_ spirits in midair, raising their weapons. Terrified, with his hair  
standing on end, Mānava stood up and moved to sit closer to the World-hon-  
ored One for refuge. He then asked the World-honored One for help and pro-  
tection, promising “I will answer the question, sir.”  
The Buddha at once asked him again, “Haven’t you already heard this  
story about the origin of your familial name from your senior teachers and  
great _brāhmaṇa_ s?”  
Mānava replied, “Yes, sir. I have heard that these things once happened,  
and I believe it, sir.”  
Mānava’s five hundred students then said to each other in loud voices:  
Ambaṭṭha, our teacher, is really a descendant of the _śūdra_ s that served  
the Śākya clans. What the _śramaṇa_ Gautama said is true. We are guilty  
of committing rudeness out of our [baseless] conceit.  
At that moment, the World-honored One thought to himself:  
These five hundred students will surely regard Ambaṭṭha as a descendant  
of slaves later on. I may have to create an expediency to erase the name  
_śūdra_ from their minds.  
He then said to them:

All of you, you should not regard your teacher [Ambaṭṭha] to be the  
descendant of slaves. Why? Because his forefather was a _brāhmaṇa_ and  
a great sage, endowed with great authority and power. He revolted against  
King Okkāka and requested one of his princesses as his wife, and because  
of the king’s fear the princess was granted to him as his wife.  
With these words, the Buddha helped Ambaṭṭha to escape the name _śūdra_.  
The World-honored One then continued:

What do you think, O Mānava? If a woman is the daughter of a true _kṣa-  
triya_ lineage of seven generations, she should never be slighted by people  
in society. If she is granted to a _brāhmaṇa_ as his wife and bears a child,  
O Mānava, and if this child is handsome and of fair complexion, can he  
then join the class of the _kṣatriya_ s, receive a seat and water from the  
hands of a _brāhmaṇa_ [out of respect], and learn to recite the laws of the  
_kṣatriya_ duties?  
[Ambaṭṭha] replied, “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued,] “Can this child inherit his father’s wealth and  
business?  
[Ambaṭṭha answered, “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha again continued,] “Can he take over his father’s livelihood?”  
[Ambaṭṭha again replied,] “No, sir.”  
The Buddha then said:  
What do you think, O Mānava? If a woman is a daughter of a true _brāh-  
maṇa_ lineage of seven generations, she should never be slighted by  
people in society. If she is granted to a _kṣatriya_ as wife and bears a child,  
and if this child is handsome with fair complexion, can he join the class  
of the _brāhmaṇa_ s and receive a seat and water from the hands of a _brāh-  
maṇa_ [out of respect]?  
Ambaṭṭha replied, “Yes, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued,] “Can he learn to recite the duties of a _brāhmaṇa_ ,  
inherit his father’s wealth, and succeed his father’s livelihood?”  
[Ambaṭṭha replied,] “Yes, sir.”  
[The Buddha further pressed Ambaṭṭha:]

What do you think, O Mānava? If a _brāhmaṇa_ dislikes being a _brāhmaṇa_  
and tries to join the _kṣatriya_ s, can he sit and stand among them, and  
receive water and recite the rules of the _kṣatriya_ duties?  
[Ambaṭṭha replied,] “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued,] “Can he inherit his father’s wealth and succeed  
the same livelihood?”  
[Ambaṭṭha again replied,] “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha further pressed Ambaṭṭha:]  
If a _kṣatriya_ dislikes being a _kṣatriya_ and tries to join the _brāhmaṇa_ s,  
can he sit and stand among them and receive water, recite the laws of  
the _brāhmaṇa_ duties, inherit his father’s wealth, and take over the same  
livelihood?  
[Ambaṭṭha again replied,] “Yes, sir.”  
[The Buddha concluded:]  
Because of these laws, O Mānava, of all women, a _kṣatriya_ woman is  
superior, and of all men, a _kṣatriya_ man is superior. It is not the _brāhmaṇa_  
[class that is highest]. The god Brahmā himself made a verse to this  
effect:  
The _kṣatriya_ is superior among all beings;  
If his lineage is pure and genuine, and  
Endowed with insight and harmonious practice,  
He is the highest among all the gods and humans.  
The Buddha said to Mānava:  
This verse composed by Brahmā is a good theory and not wrong. I am  
a good example. Why? Because I now also assert this same theory as  
Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One:  
The _kṣatriya_ is superior among all beings;  
If his lineage is pure and genuine, and  
Endowed with insight and harmonious practice,  
He is the highest among all the gods and humans.  

Mānava said to the Buddha, “O Gautama, who is this ‘unsurpassed one  
harmoniously endowed with insight and practice’?”  
The Buddha said to Mānava, “Listen attentively. You should retain and  
consider well what I will now explain for your sake.”  
[Ambaṭṭha replied,] “Yes, sir. I shall listen intently.”  
The Buddha said to Mānava:  
If a tathāgata (“one perfected in the speech of reality”) appears into this  
world, he should be called [the following ten epithets]: (1) Arhat), (2)  
Perfectly Enlightened One, (3) Harmoniously Endowed with Insight  
and Practice, (4) Well-gone One, one who has transcended [and will not  
return to the cycle of samsara], (5) Knower of the Human World, (6)  
Unrivaled Leader, (7) Trainer of Human Religiosity, (8) Teacher of Gods  
and Humans, (9) Enlightened One, and (10) World-honored One.  
Among all the gods, humans, _śramaṇa_ s, _brāhmaṇa_ s, heavenly  
guardian gods, evil ones, and the lord Brahmā, he is the only one who  
is enlightened by himself and has directly experienced it. When he  
teaches the Dharma to people his words are good at the beginning of  
his speech, good in the middle of his speech, and also good at the end  
of his speech, all equally endowed with true meaning and real essence,  
able to motivate the audience toward pure and genuine practices.  
If householders and their children, as well as others of different social  
classes, wish to listen to the right Dharma, the Tathāgata will motivate  
them to give rise to tranquil faith in their hearts. With serene faith in the  
Dharma, they may thus reflect, “Because I have been in the householder’s  
life until now, I am bound to my family to support my wife and children.  
In this situation I cannot carry out the required practice of pure and gen-  
uine austerity. I should now shave my hair and beard, don the three men-  
dicant robes, and join the practice of the path by forsaking domestic  
life.” Later he renounces his household and wealth, dissociates himself  
from his family and relations, shaves his hair and beard, and, wearing  
the three robes, he renounces domestic life in order to join the practice  
of the path.  
Like fully ordained _bhikṣu_ s, he forsakes all physical adornment and  
adheres to the following set of precepts: (1) With a vow not to injure

sentient beings, one forsakes carrying a knife or stick, and, having a  
sense of shame [about malice, etc.], he practices compassion toward all  
beings. This is called the precept of abstinence from taking life. (2) For-  
saking the idea to take what is not given, he eradicates thoughts of theft  
altogether. His mind is pure and genuine, free from the slightest thought  
of theft, even privately. This is called the precept of abstinence from  
taking what is not given. (3) Forsaking sexual desire, he concentrates  
his mind on the genuine practice of austerity with effort. He is not affected  
by desire and abides in purity. This is called the precept of abstinence  
from sexual misconduct. (4) Forsaking false words, he upholds the prin-  
ciple of sincerity, neither lying to others nor deceiving them. This is  
called the precept of abstinence from speaking falsehoosd. (5) Forsaking  
duplicitous speech, even if he hears something from someone else he  
never conveys it to another person. Nor does he convey anything about  
what he hears from the latter to the former. If both are mutually estranged,  
he tries to help them reconcile [their differences] and thereby harmonize  
their relationship. Whatever he speaks is harmonious, agreeable, and  
well timed. This is called the precept of abstinence from duplicitious  
speech. (6) Forsaking using abusive, harsh sppech, he abstains from  
becoming rough and barbarous [in his speech and actions] and from cre-  
ating a sense of affliction and anger in another person. One’s speech  
should be gentle so as not to create a sense of enmity or malice, and is  
beneficial to anyone who hears it.Thus, people are endeared to him with  
respect and wish to hear his words. This is called the precept of abstinence  
from harsh speech. (7) Forsaking flattery, one knows the appropriate time  
that is best suited for his use of words. He is honest and sincere, in com-  
pliance with law. In the case of disputes, he applies the rules of the Vinaya  
discipline to successfully settle them. He speaks out only when it is causally  
meaningful, and whatever he says is based on a real situation. This is  
called the precept of abstinence from frivolous sycophancy. (8) Forsaking  
liquor and intoxicants and distancing himself from places of dissipation.  
He neither uses bodily ornaments, nor does he go out to hear songs  
and see dancing or any kind of entertainment, nor does he use an elevated  
wide couch [for sleeping] or partake of food outside of the authorized  
period of each day. He neither receives wealth in cash or in any kind of

the seven precious stones, nor does he use them for their monetary value.
He neither marries nor lives with a woman, nor does he keep servants
or maids, [nor does he keep] an elephant, a horse and carriage, a cow,
hen, dog, pig, or sheep, nor does he own a rice field or a residential
house, or a grove or forest. He neither cheats others by using scales that
have been illegally tampered with, nor does he engage in questionable
business transactions, pulling customers with his hands, or impose loans,
or make false accusations or fraudulent transactions. Forsaking all these
wrong actions, he terminates various disputes and legal suits and erad-
icates wrongdoing.
Whatever action he takes, he knows the approriate time, thus avoiding
[making] an inappropriate action at a wrong time. Knowing [his own
hunger], he partakes of an appropriate amount of food but refrains from
setting aside an extra portion for later. As far as his garments are con-
cerned, he takes only whatever size is needed and no more, because
one’s clothing should match the size and shape of the body and be worn
at all times, just as a bird’s feathers go along with it when it flies through
the air. Such is the general principle that a bhikṣu keeps no extra items
for himself.
O Mānava, the other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s receive charity from
their devotees yet they also actively seek more to store extra items. They
know nothing about the sense of having more than enough or of con-
tentment in regard to clothing, food, and drink. Whoever joins my reli-
gious order, however, should realize that all these [unwholesome qualities]
are absent from the practice of my disciples.
O Mānava, the other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, having subsisted on
their devotees’ charity, are engaged in various means of livelihood as
well as planting seedlings [in farming], thus inviting evil spirits. Whoever
joins my religious order, however, should realize that all these [unwhole-
some actions] are absent in the practice of my disciples.
O Mānava, the other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, having subsisted on
their devotees’ charity, seek to acquire various material benefits through
expedient means, such as ivory and other precious items, an elevated, com-
fortable couch, various embroidered cloth, carpets, bamboo floor mats, and

cushions. Whoever joins my religious order, however, should realize that  
[seeking such things] does not happen in the practice of my disciples.  
O Mānava, the other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, having subsisted on  
their devotees’ charity, seek various means of beautifying themselves  
out of vanity, [in order to impress their devotees,] such as rubbing their  
bodies with thyme seed oil, bathing in scented water, applying scented  
powder on the body, applying fragrant oil to the hair, wearing a flower  
garland, using blue eye shadow or applying make-up to their faces, wear-  
ing a shining clasp ring or a garment sash, or examining their appearance  
in a mirror. They put on a pair of multicolord shoes and a white upper  
garment and try to obtain a sword or stick, an attendant, a canopy, a fan,  
and a carriage well decorated with banners. Whoever joins my religious  
order, however, should realize that all [these behaviors] are absent in  
the practice of my disciples.  
O Mānava, the other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, having subsisted on  
their devotees’ charity, engage in various play and games, such as chess,  
gambling, checkers with eight-squared or ten-squared boards, or [any]  
of hundreds of [other types of games] in every and all ways. Whoever  
joins my religious order, however, should realize that [this kind of behav-  
ior] is absent in the practice of my disciples.  
O Mānava, the other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, having subsisted on  
their devotees’ charity, engage in useless talk that obstructs religious  
pursuits, such as [gossiping about] the affairs of kings, battles, cavalry  
horses, or matters of how bureaucrats and ministers as ride horses on  
excursions, going to and from parks and pleasure gardens. Or they talk  
about women, or about their daily lives in lying, sitting down, or walking,  
or on the subjects of clothing, food, and drink, or their relations. Or they  
discuss sea divers and their collection of treasures from the ocean. Who-  
ever joins my religious order, however, should realize that all [these  
kinds of idle speech] are absent in the practice of my disciples.  
O Mānava, the other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, having subsisted on  
their devotees’ charity, seek through innumerable expedient means wrong  
livelihoods, using flattering words and statements, or slandering each  
other, thereby seeking benefits and an advantage over the other. Whoever

joins my religious order, however, should realize that [such behavior]
is absent in the practice of my disciples.
O Mānava, the other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, having subsisted on
their devotees’ charity, engage in disputes with each other wherever they
are, whether in a pleasure grove or a bathing pond, or on the floor of a
building, accusing each other as to who is right or wrong, saying “I know
the text and rules but you have little knowledge about them. I am on the
right course, but your course is a deviation. Your argument is confused,
asserting later what ought to be asserted earlier, while asserting earlier
what ought to be asserted later. I am able to tolerate you but you cannot
tolerate me. Nothing you say is either true or real. When you find some
doubt in yourself, come and ask me about it. I will surely answer all your
questions.” Whoever joins my religious order, however, should realize
that [such behavior] is absent in the practice of my disciples.
O Mānava, the other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, having subsisted on
their devotees’ charity, seek greater [rewards or benefit] through various
expedient means. For instance, on behalf of a king, or a minister of the
king, or a brāhmaṇa, or a householder, they carry official communications
or private messages, traveling from this place to that place or returning
from there to here. Carrying letters for clients, they deliver them to the
designated recipients in respective destinations, then carry their replies
back, delivering them to their clients. Or they give instructions about
the ways to conduct the business of carrying messages for themselves
or others. Whoever joins my religious order, however, should realize
that [this behavior] is absent in the practice of my disciples.
O Mānava, the other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, having subsisted on
their devotees’ charity, engage solely in learning the business of military
strategy, battles, and disputes, or learning matters of armaments such as
swords, canes, bows and arrows, or how to arrange fights between domestic
animals such as roosters, dogs, pigs, goats, elephants, horses, bulls, or
camels, or how to stage fights between men and women, or how to perform
various skills to make the sound of a multitude, such as blowing conch
shells, beating drums, singing, dancing, dragging and tossing streamers,
and so on, in all sorts of other actions. Whoever joins my religious order,

however, should realize that all [such behavior] is absent in the practice  
of my disciples.  
O Mānava, the other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, having subsisted on  
their devotees’ charity, engage in ignoble ways of life, learning wrong  
paths that obstruct [the authentic path of religion], thus taking up a wrong  
livelihood, such as performing fortunetelling for male or female clients  
regarding auspicious and ominous signs, their handsomeness and ugliness,  
or soliciting material support by way of similar predictions regarding  
animals [in the business of husbandry]. Whoever joins my religious  
order, however, should realize that [such behavior] is absent in the  
practice of my disciples.  
O Mānava, the other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, having subsisted on  
their devotees’ charity, engage in ignoble ways of life, learning wrong  
paths that obstruct [the authentic path of religion], taking up wrong liveli-  
hoods such as performing magical incantations to call ghost spirits into  
one’s presence or to send them away, or causing [such spirits] to stay  
with various repugnant spells. Thus, in many ways, they threaten people,  
assembling and dispersing them, tormenting them thoroughly, or causing  
them enjoyment. They also use incantations to calm a pregnant woman  
for the safety of her unborn child, or they provide a [magical] garment  
to their clients, or they use an incantation to change a man into a donkey  
or cause him to become totally deaf and dumb. Displaying various meth-  
ods, they stand up facing the sun or moon, performing varieties of ascetic  
practice with both hands in order to solicit material gain. Whoever joins  
my religious order, however, should realize that [such behavior] is absent  
in the practice of my disciples.  
O Mānava, the other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, having subsisted on  
their devotees’ charity, engage in ignoble ways of life, learning wrong  
paths that obstruct [the authentic path of religion], thus taking up a wrong  
livelihood such as chanting magical spells for curing illness, or applying  
evil or good spells, or using medical treatments such as acupuncture,  
moxa cautery, or medicine to attempt to treat various illnesses [for mate-  
rial gain]. Whoever joins my religious order, however, should realize  
that [such behavior] is absent in the practice of my disciples.

O Mānava, the other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, having subsisted on
their devotees’ charity, engage in ignoble ways of life, learning wrong
paths that obstruct [the authentic path of religion], thus taking up a wrong
livelihood such as performing magical spells for water or fire, or a spell
to call a ghost spirit, or a spell for success in a political or military cam-
paign, or a spell for birds, a spell for bodily limbs, or a spell for a talisman
to ensure the safety of one’s residence, a spell for swift recovery from
fiery burns, or a spell for curing a rat bite. Or they read a written incantation
to discern the life or death of the person concerned, or a written incantation
for deciphering dreams, or they read palms (chiromancy) and facial fea-
tures (physiognomy), chant astronomical texts, or chant alphabetical
characters. Whoever joins my religious order, however, should realize
that [such behavior] is absent in the practice of my disciples.
O Mānava, the other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, having subsisted on
their devotees’ charity, engage in ignoble ways, learning wrong paths that
obstruct [the authentic path of religion], thus taking up a wrong livelihood
such as observing the weather and seasons to predict whether or not it will
rain, whether the price of crops will go up or down, whether or not there
will be an epidemic, whether a fearful event will take place or if there will
be peace and safety. Or they predict oncoming earthquakes, the appearance
of a comet, a solar or lunar eclipse, or a stellar eclipse, or the nonappearance
of such an eclipse, to determine whether it is a good or bad omen. Whoever
joins my religious order, however, should realize that all [such behvior]
is absent in the practice of my disciples.
O Mānava, the other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, having subsisted on
their devotees’ charity, engage in ignoble ways of life, learning wrong
paths that obstruct [the authentic path of religion], thus taking up a wrong
livelihood, asserting that this country is superior to that country, or that
this is not true; or asserting that another country is superior to this country,
and this is not true. Observing good or bad omens, they predict the for-
tunes and fates of the other countries with which they are concerned.
Whoever joins my religious order, however, should realize that all [such
behavior] is absent in the practice of my disciples.
[Whoever joins my religious order then shall be in compliance with
the following sacred precepts.] My disciples concentrate on the sacred

rules of discipline with a mind of nonattachment, and they experience  
inner joy and an easeful state of existence. If the visual faculty does not  
see an object, the mind does not grasp the characteristic of the object.  
The visual faculty is neither bound nor linked to an object of form, but  
firmly remains in quiescence with no attachment whatsoever. Also, free  
from anxieties and problems, the sense faculties do not release evil influ-  
ences. My disciples uphold the fundamental rules of the Vinaya discipline  
and thus protect the pure and genuine visual sense faculty. It is the same  
with the auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile sense faculties.  
Disciples should control the six kinds of sense contact and maintain  
good control over them, so that the sense faculties remain quiescent and  
at ease. It is like riding a carriage drawn by four horses: a good charioteer  
holds the whip in one hand and controls the reins with his other hand,  
so as not to let the wheels [of the chariot] leave the tracks. The practice  
of a _bhikṣu_ is also like this. Thoroughly controlling the six “horses”[of  
his sense faculties], he does not let the wheels leave their tracks, and  
thus he remains safe, in an easeful state. On the basis of such sacred dis-  
ciplines, he has acquired the [sense] faculties transcendent [from the  
objects and defilements], and thus they are sacred.  
As to the partaking of food, one should know contentment and also  
not indulge himself in the quality of its taste. He should take only enough  
food as is sufficient to nurture his body [and keep it] free from malnu-  
trition and illness. He should maintain his health without costly food to  
the degree that he can eradicate an existing health problem without incur-  
ring a new one. Restoring his strength, he should make his body easeful  
and pleasant. Just as a person applies medicine to a wound, thereby mak-  
ing a [positive] difference in healing the wound, neither pursuing a false  
attractive appearance nor being haughty—O Mānava, a _bhikṣu_ is also  
like this. It is sufficient for him to partake of food in order to sustain his  
health, cherishing no self-pride. Just as one greases the wheel shaft of  
a cart in order to transport a load in the cart wherever as he wishes, a  
_bhikṣu_ is also like this. One should partake of food only to the degree  
that it sustains one’s physical health and allows one to carry out the prac-  
tice of austerity.

O Mānava, a bhikṣu is also like this. Once he realizes the sacred fac-
ulties on the basis of the sacred disciplines, he should know contentment
in [minimizing] the quantity of food he partakes of [daily] and should
make effort toward enlightenment in the earlier and later thirds of each
night. Also during the day, whether he is walking or sitting, he should
always maintain mental alertness in order to eradicate the obstacles that
prevent the arising of good mental elements.During the earlier third of
the night, whether he is walking or sitting, he should always maintain
mental alertness in order to eradicate the five kinds of obstacles.^26 During
the middle third of the night he should recline on his right side [to sleep].
He may awaken whenever a thought happens to arise. Since his mind is
expectant of the approaching dawn, there should be no confusion in his
mind. As soon as the later third of the night comes, he wakes up to practice
contemplation. Whether he is just waking up or already sitting, he should
maintain mental alertness always in order to eradicate the five kinds of
obstacles. When a bhikṣu is endowed with this kind of sacred discipline,
only then will he acquire the sacred faculties [as mentioned before] and
the discipline of contentment in partaking of the proper amount of food.
If a bhikṣu exerts himself toward enlightenment in the earlier and
later thirds of each night and always maintains mental alertness [or the
state of mindfulness in order to eradicate the obstacles], there should be
no confusion in his mind. What does it mean, however, to say that if a
bhikṣu maintains mental alertness there will be no confusion in his mind?
Such a bhikṣu is engaged diligently in observation of his inner body or
inner senses with no slackening, exerting himself, being mindful of his
observations to keep them in memory, thereby removing worldly desires
and anxiety. He is also engaged without slackening in observing his
outer body or outer senses, and also observing both inner and outer body,
exerting himself, being mindful of his observations to keep them in
memory, thereby removing worldly desires and anxiety. It is the same
with observing one’s sense perceptions (sensation), the mind (intellect),
and the psychophysical elements. This is called a bhikṣu ’s mindfulness
with no confusion in his mind.
Why is it called the one mind or the total mind? Suppose that whether
a bhikṣu is walking, coming and going, looking right or left, bending

his body or stretching it, casting his eyes downward or upward, receiving  
alms while holding his outer robe’s sleeve and almsbowl [simultaneously],  
or whether he is turning to the left or right for convenience, sleeping or  
waking, standing or sitting, speaking or in silence—on all these occasions,  
he should be mindful always of his deportment in his one mind. This is  
the sole mind. For instance, suppose there is a man traveling with a  
group of his friends, walking either at the front or in the middle or at  
the end of the group. He is always safe and has no fear. O Mānava, a  
_bhikṣu_ is also like that. Whether he is walking, coming or going, speaking  
or not speaking, if he is always mindful of his deportment single-mind-  
edly, he will have no fear. Based on this kind of sacred discipline, a  
_bhikṣu_ acquires the transcendent faculties that are sacred. He knows  
contentment in his partaking of food, makes effort toward enlightenment,  
whether in the earlier or later thirds of each night, and always maintains  
mental alertness toward singleminded reflective recollection of obser-  
vations. There is no room for confusion in the mind.  
An easeful state of existence can be found in a secluded place, such  
as under a forest tree, among the cemetery mounds, in mountain caves,  
in open passages, or among piles of cow dung. At the proper time the  
_bhikṣu_ goes for almsround, then returns to his abode. Washing his hands  
and feet, placing his robes and almsbowl securely, sitting down in the  
lotus posture, keeping his body and mind upright, focusing mental alert-  
ness directly to the front, the _bhikṣu_ eradicates parsimony and avarice  
without leaving any desire and terminates anger and malice without  
leaving any fetter of enmity. With a pure and genuine mind, he abides  
always in the mind of compassion, minimizing the hours of sleep while  
awaiting the approaching dawn. With no confusion in his mind, he erad-  
icates obsessive conceptualization and removes doubt and delusion,  
thereby overcoming entanglement in the net of doubt, while his mind  
is saturated with favorable psychophysical elements. Just as when a ser-  
vant boy is [adopted by his master’s family and] receives that family  
name, and thus is delivered [from the status of slave] to a [new state] of  
safety and ease; liberated from his servitude, his mind is filled with joy,  
having nothing more to worry about or fear. Also, suppose someone,  
having raised some capital for his intended business and carried out his

business successfully, and acquired a great deal of profit, then returns [to
his home town]. After repaying all the loans [with interest] to his original
investors, there still remains in his hand sufficient resources with which
to continue his business. With great joy, he thinks, “Previously, when I
raised capital by persuading my investors, I was really anxious that my
intended business would not be as successful as I hoped. But now, having
acquired a great deal of profit, even after I have repaid my investors all
the capital I borrowed I still have a sufficient amount of wealth remaining.
I no longer have any worry or fear like I did before.”
Or again, suppose someone has been cured from a lengthy illness,
and his diet and digestion as well as his complexion and strength have
all improved. He thus thinks, “Previously I suffered from illness, but
now I am completely cured. My diet, digestion, complexion, and strength
have all improved.” He feels great joy because he no longer has any
worry or fear like he did previously. [Or again,] someone who was impris-
oned for a long time finally was able to safely come out from it. He is
overjoyed, thinking, “Previously I was confined in a prison, but now I
have been delivered [from that confinement]. I have no more worry and
fear like I did before.” [Or again,] someone transported his own wealth
through a great expanse of wilderness and successfully crossed through
it without encountering a bandit. With great joy, he thinks, “Having
passed through this place of great danger, I feel safe and at ease, and
have no more worry and fear like I did before.”
O Mānava, a bhikṣu has five hindrances [that obstruct the arising of
good mental elements], due to which he is perpetually haunted by a
sense of worry and fear, like those in the stories [above]—the sense of
worry and fear experienced by someone who had been heavily indebted,
someone who suffered from a lengthy illness, someone who was impris-
oned for a long time, and someone who had to pass through [a dangerous]
wilderness carrying all his wealth. The bhikṣu sees in himself that his
mind is not free from the five hindrances; his mind is still covered by
these hindrances. Because of the prevailing [mental] darkness his insight
is not sufficiently developed to see through it. He makes effort to eradicate
the desires that incline toward evil and anything that is not good (i.e.,
contrary to good) from his mind. This eradication of desires concurs

with the mental function of seeking an object and that of examining it  
in meditation. Thus he is able to enter the initial state of meditative  
absorption accompanied by the sense of delight and bliss, [while the  
twofold mental function continues]. Permeated with delight and bliss,  
he is totally immersed in a state of trance, just as someone who applies  
various medicinal substances skillfully in their bathwater and thus sat-  
urates it thoroughly in the middle as well as in the outer edges. It is the  
same with the _bhikṣu_ who has entered the initial state of meditatiove  
absorption and is entirely permeated by the sense of delight and bliss.  
It is like this, O Mānava. This is called the initial realization of bliss in  
one’s present body. Why? Because he has acquired the state of bliss,  
quiescence, and seclusion where confusion is eliminated due to his efforts  
without slackening.  
He [now] forsakes the [mental] function of seeking and examining  
and gives rise to tranquil faith or self-confidence. With one-pointed con-  
centration he experiences neither awareness of an object nor the subjective  
act of examining, but abides in the constant presence of delight and bliss,  
and thus enters the second state of meditative absorption. He is already  
saturated with delight and bliss in his entire being and is totally immersed  
in the state of delight and trance. It is like the water of a deep spring  
located on the summit of a mountain. The water springs up from within,  
it does not flow into [the spring] from outside. The [mental] state in  
question is like being immersed in a pond of pure springwater. O Mānava,  
the experience of the _bhikṣu_ is like this. He enters the second state of  
meditative absorption and never fails to experience the permeation of a  
perpetually arising sense of delight and bliss in himself. This is called  
the second realization of bliss in one’s present body.  
The _bhikṣu_ [now] has already forsaken the sense of delight and abides  
[solely in bliss], his mind protected from falling into confusion. He expe-  
riences a blissful state just as described by the [ancient] sages. Abiding  
in this state of bliss that protects one’s mind from confusion, the _bhikṣu_  
enters the third state of meditative absorption, in which even though the  
sense of delight is absent he is immersed in a state of bliss that permeates  
the entirety of his being. For instance, it is like the case of the varieties  
of lotuses, such as _utpala_ (blue), _padma_ (pink), _kumuda_ (red), and

puṇḍarīka (white), grow up from the mud below the surface of the water,
and yet their roots, stalks, branches, and leaves are all immersed totally
in the water. The experience of the bhikṣu is like this. Entering the third
state of meditative absorption, the bhikṣu discards delight but abides in
bliss and is totally immersed in that state. This is called the third real-
ization of bliss in one’s present body.
The bhikṣu has now abandoned not only the sense of delight but also
that of bliss. With the sense of affliction and delight already equally
abandoned, the sense of neither suffering nor happiness should be upheld
as purely and genuinely as possible. Through this practice he enters the
fourth state of meditative absorption. His body and mind are equally
pure and genuine throughout his entire being, just as the entire body is
totally pure and clean after someone has bathed and cleansed it and put
on a clean, white garment. O Mānava, the experience of the bhikṣu is
like this when he enters the fourth state of meditative absorption. While
his mind is purified and totally permeating his body, every part of it
without fail, he enters the fourth state of meditative absorption; the mind
neither increases nor decreases, nor does it incline or move. His mind
abides on the ground of neither love or hatred, nor motion. For instance,
when a well-insulated room is tightly sealed with additional plaster on
the inside [walls] as well as the outside [walls], and the window is closed,
neither wind nor flying dirt [can enter] and nothing can disturb the can-
dlelight. The flame of the candle constantly burns upward but does not
appear to move or flicker at all. O Mānava, the experience of the bhikṣu
is like this when he enters the fourth state of meditative absorption. His
mind neither increases nor decreases, nor does it incline or move. His
mind abides on the ground of neither love or hatred, nor motion. This
is called the fourth realization of bliss in one’s present body. Why?
Because due to his efforts without slackening he has acquired the state
of bliss, quiescence, and seclusion in which confusion is eliminated.
Having perfected concentration, with a pure and spotless mind the
bhikṣu now has self-control and gently and patiently abides in the
immovablestate. He creates another mind [with supernormal power]
and also another body that is perfectly endowed with all the limbs and
senses, none lacking. He [then] visualizes, “This body [of mine] consists

of four gross elements that have created that body. This body of mine is  
different [from that created body], and that body [is different from mine].  
Due to this body, this mind [of mine] arises and has created the body  
itself as equipped with all its senses and limbs, none lacking.” This is  
like when someone pulls a sword from its sheath and thinks, “The sheath  
is different [from the sword], and the sword [is different from the sheath].  
Yet the sword is drawn from the sheath.” Again, it is like when someone  
makes a rope by braiding together a number of hemp fibers and thinks,  
“The hemp fibers are different [from the rope], and the rope [is also dif-  
ferent from the hemp fibers]. Yet the rope is made out of these hemp  
fibers.” Again it is like when someone pulls a snake out of a box and  
thinks, “This box is different from the snake, and the snake is different  
from the box. Yet the snake comes out of the box.” Again it is like when  
someone takes a garment out of a bamboo basket and thinks, “The bamboo  
basket is different from the garment, and the garment is different from  
the bamboo basket. Yet the garment comes out of the basket.” O Mānava,  
[these examples] are like the case of the _bhikṣu_. This is the first superior  
insight initially acquired by the _bhikṣu_. Why? Because due to his efforts  
without slackening he has acquired the state of bliss, quiescence, and  
seclusion in which confusion is eliminated.  
Having perfected his concentration, with a pure and spotless mind,  
the _bhikṣu_ has self-control and gently and patiently abides in the immov-  
able state. He has already given rise to another mind out of his body to  
create another body that is perfectly endowed with all its senses and  
limbs. He [then] visualizes, “This body is composed out of the four gross  
elements. The body [that is different from mine] has come into being  
[through magical power]. This body [of mine] is different from that  
body, and that body [is different from this body of mine]. This mind of  
mine abides in this body of mine. While abiding in this body, it reaches  
to that magically created body. This is like the luster of gems such as  
lapis lazuli and _maṇi,_ which are clearly seen to be pure and spotless.  
When such gems are pierced with a blue, yellow, or red thread, an expert  
examiner, placing them on his palm, thinks, “The gems are different  
from the thread, and the thread is different from the gems. Yet each bead  
is linked with the other beads by means of the thread.” O Mānava, the

bhikṣu envisions his mind as abiding in the body, and so his mind reaches
[to abide in] that [magically] created body. This is the second superior
power acquired by the bhikṣu. Why? Because due to his efforts without
slackening he has acquired the state of bliss, quiescence, and seclusion
in which confusion is eliminated.
Having perfected his concentration, with a pure and spotless mind,
the bhikṣu has self-control and gently and patiently abides in the immov-
able state. Through mental concentration he acquires the supernormal
power that enables him to change his physical form into various other
forms. He may multiply his single physical form into innumerable iden-
tical ones or reverse the many [forms] to his original form. Flying through
space, he can pass through even a stone wall without obstruction. He
can fly in the air like a bird, walk on the surface of water just as on the
ground, blast fiery flames out of his body like a huge bonfire, grasp the
sun and moon in his hand, and reach the height of the Brahmā heaven.
This is like a potter who can mix various types of clay and produce, as
he wishes, a variety of vessels that are beneficial to many; also, it is like
a wood craftsman who handles wooden materials and produces, as he
wishes, any kind of object that may benefit many others; again, it is also
like an ivory craftsman who works with the material of elephant tusks,
or like a goldsmith works real gold to produce various things that are
beneficial to many. O Mānava, the bhikṣu is also like this. With his mind
in concentration, pure and spotless, abiding in the immovable ground,
the bhikṣu transfigures his own physical form into another as he wishes,
and so forth, up to grasping the sun and moon in his hand, and stands
as tall as to reach the Brahmā heaven. This is the third superior power
acquired by the bhikṣu.
Having perfected his concentration, with a pure and spotless mind, the
bhikṣu has self-control and gently and patiently abides in the immovable
state. Through mental concentration he acquires supernormal [power of]
auditory capacity, surpassing that of an ordinary human being, and is capa-
ble of hearing two kinds of voices, those of a god and of a human being.
Suppose there is a lecture hall in a city, whose structure is tall, grand, and
of preeminent scale. Wise people who reside in this hall can hear distinctly
and understand everything spoken within the hall without relying on any

auditory device. The supernormal auditory capacity acquired by the _bhikṣu_  
is like this. As his mind is well concentrated, his auditory capacity is pure  
and genuine and he is capable of hearing those two kinds of voices. O  
Mānava, this is the fourth superior power acquired by the _bhikṣu_.  
Having perfected his concentration, with a pure and spotless mind,  
the _bhikṣu_ has self-control and gently and patiently abides in the immov-  
able state. Through mental concentration he acquires the supernormal  
power of reading others’ minds. He knows, without exception, everything  
regarding the mind of another person: whether that person’s mind has  
desire or no desire, whether his or her mind is defiled or free from delu-  
sion, whether that person is broadminded or narrowminded, whether or  
not that person’s mind abides in concentration, if it is bound by or free  
from bondage, whether it is upright or downward, or if it has reached  
the highest state. This is like someone who gazes at his reflection on the  
surface of clear water to see whether he is handsome or ugly, and thus  
necessarily cognizes it. The power of the _bhikṣu_ is also like this. Because  
his mind is pure and genuine [through concentration], he is able to know  
the mind of another person. O Mānava, this is the fifth superior power  
acquired by the _bhikṣu_.  
Having perfected his concentration, with a pure and spotless mind,  
the _bhikṣu_ has self-control and gently and patiently abides in the immov-  
able state. Through mental concentration he recollects and records in  
his mind innumerable and various kinds of past events [of his own as  
well as those of others]. He remembers one life and so forth, up to incal-  
culable past lives, the numbers of eons with evolving or devolving peri-  
ods, where he died and where he was born, his own name and the names  
of his family, clans, and races; [he remembers his own] preferences of  
food and drink, whether he had a long or short life span, the happiness  
and suffering he experienced, his physical and facial features and char-  
acteristics, and so on—everything without exception. Suppose someone  
travels from his own village to another village in a different country. He  
remembers all things and recollects them instantly, without any mental  
effort: whatever he did, where he stayed, what he said or did not say;  
also, again, whether he traveled on from that country to another, and so  
on, one after another, until he returned to his homeland, as well as the

names of all the countries through which he passed, without exception.
It is like the case of such a traveler who remembers everything, not only
the place he left from to travel to another place, and from that place trav-
eled on to another place, and so on, but also [remembers] what he did,
where he stayed, what he said and when he remained silent, and so on,
entirely without exception. O Mānava, the supernormal power of the
bhikṣu is also like this. With a well-concentrated mind, a pure and spotless
mind, he abides in the immovable state and able to recollect and know
through the supernormal power innumerable past lives throughout innu-
merable eons. This is called the first insight of great knowledge acquired
by the bhikṣu. The cause of ignorance is once for all brought to cessation
for the bhikṣu , in whom there arises the insight of great knowledge.
When the darkness disappears the insight of bright illumination prevails.
This insight means the bhikṣu ’s knowledge of past lives. Why? Because
due to his effort without slackening he has acquired the state of bliss,
quiescence, and seclusion in which confusion is eliminated.
Having perfected his concentration, with a pure and spotless mind,
the bhikṣu has self-control and gently and patiently abides in the immov-
able state. Through his exertion in practice he realizes the supernormal
power of knowing the future destinies of others’ lives and deaths. Through
this supernormal power, he sees not only how sentient beings die here
and are reborn there, then die there to be reborn here, but also their phys-
ical features and complexions, their appearance as either handsome or
ugly, the good and bad retributions [of their actions], their births into
either noble or humble [families], and all the causal contexts through
which they receive the appropriate retributions according to their deeds,
entirely without exception. He is equipped to see that when someone
commits wrong acts of body, speech, and mind, slanders wise and saintly
disciples, and expresses perverse views, when that person’s body dissolves
at the end of his life he will fall into the three evil destinies. The bhikṣu
is also equipped to see that when someone does good acts of body,
speech, and mind, does not slander wise and saintly disciples, and upholds
right views, faith, and devotion, when his body dissolves at the end of
his life he will be reborn among gods and human beings. Through his
supernormal power of vision, the bhikṣu thus sees all sentient beings

coming and going between the five destinies of the life cycle according  
to the causal contexts created by their deeds. For instance, suppose there  
is a city enclosed by high, wide, and even walls. At every intersection  
there is a high tower, and there is a knowledgeable person up in the  
tower. Looking over the streets in all directions, east, west, south, and  
north, this man can see all the citizens’ movements and observe their  
behavior, entirely without exception. O Mānava, the _bhikṣu_ ’s supernormal  
power is like this. Through a mind of concentration, pure and spotless,  
abiding in the immovable state, he acquires the supernormal power of  
vision, and through this power he knows all the movements of sentient  
beings through the five destinies of the life cycle according to the causal  
contexts created by their deeds, entirely without exception. This is the  
second insight of great knowledge acquired by the _bhikṣu_. The cause of  
ignorance is once and for all brought to cessation for the _bhikṣu_ , in whom  
arises the insight of great knowledge. When the darkness disappears the  
insight of bright illumination prevails. This insight is the _bhikṣu_ ’s knowl-  
edge of the future destinies of life and death of sentient beings. Why?  
Because due to his exertion without slackening he has acquired the state  
of bliss, quiescence, and seclusion in which confusion is eliminated.  
Having perfected his concentration, with a pure and spotless mind,  
the _bhikṣu_ has self-control and gently and patiently abides in the immov-  
able state. Through exertion in practice he realizes the supernormal  
power of knowing the truth of suffering as it really is, the truth of the  
causal aggregates under the influence of defilement as they really are,  
the truth of cessation of the defiled causal aggregates as it really is, and  
the truth of the path for eradicating the defiled causal aggregates as it  
really is. The _bhikṣu_ knows that the influence of defilements in carnal  
desire, in the will to becoming, and in the force of ignorance should all  
equally be seen according to these four truths. He has realized liberation  
and acquired the knowledge of his liberation, namely, “Whoever has  
exhausted [the cause of] birth and death, accomplished the goal of the  
practice of austerity, and completed what should be done, for that person  
there will be no further rebirth after this lifetime.” For instance, in clear  
water there are various kinds of things, such as pieces of wood or rocks,  
or fish and turtles, which are moving about, to and fro. Someone who

has the real power of vision can clearly distinguish these things: “This
is a piece of wood or a rock” or “That is a fish or a turtle.” O Mānava,
the capacity of the bhikṣu is like this. Through a mind of concentration,
pure and spotless, abiding in the immovable state, he acquires the super-
normal power of transcendent knowledge free from the influence of
defilement, and so on, up to liberation from further rebirth after this life.
This is the third insight of great knowledge acquired by the bhikṣu. The
cause of ignorance is once and for all brought to cessation for the bhikṣu ,
in whom there arises the insight of great knowledge. When darkness
disappears the insight of bright illumination prevails. This insight is the
bhikṣu ’s knowledge of his eradication of the influence of defilement.
Why? Because due to his exertion without slackening he has acquired
the state of bliss, quiescence, and seclusion in which confusion is elim-
inated. O Mānava, this is called the unsurpassable endowment of knowl-
edge and practice. What do you think? Is this excellent combination of
knowledge and practice acceptable to you as the [supreme] good?
The Buddha continued, saying to Mānava:
When one cannot realize the unsurpassable endowment of knowledge
and practice he adheres to four expedient practices [as an alternative
course of practice]. What are these four? First, suppose there is someone
who has not been able to realize the unsurpassable endowment of knowl-
edge and practice. He carries a cutting tool and a basket on his back,
enters the mountains, seeks medicinal herbs, and partakes of tree roots.
O Mānava, this is called adherence to the first alternative practice (i.e.,
a diet of tree roots), as he is unable to realize the unsurpassable endow-
ment of knowledge and practice. What do you think? O Mānava, do
you and your teacher practice this discipline?^27
Mānava replied, “No, sir.”
The Buddha continued:
You have degraded yourself without knowing what is true and what is
not. You have accused the sons of the Śākya sage (i.e., followers of the
Buddha) and verbally abused them. Because you have planted the root
of this offense you will suffer in hell for a long time.

Again, O Mānava, suppose someone cannot realize the unsurpassable
endowment of knowledge and practice. He carries a water pitcher and
a pole, enters the mountains, and partakes of fruits that have fallen to
the ground. O Mānava, this is called adherence to the second alternative
practice (i.e., a diet of seed fruits), unable to realize the unsurpassable
endowment of knowledge and practice. What do you think? O Mānava,
do you and your teacher practice this discipline?

Mānava replied, “No, sir.”  
The Buddha continued:

You have degraded yourself without knowing what is true and what is
not. You have accused the sons of the Śākya sage, the followers of the
Buddha and verbally abused them. Because you have planted the root
of this offense you will suffer in hell for a long time.
Again, O Mānava, suppose someone cannot realize the unsurpassable
endowment of knowledge and practice. He abandons the foregoing two
alternative practices and, returning to the village, he relies on other
people, builds a hermitage thatched with grass, and partakes of plants
and leaves. O Mānava, this is called adherence to the third alternative
practice (i.e., a diet of plants and leaves), unable to realize the unsur-
passable endowment of knowledge and practice. What do you think? O
Mānava, do you and your teacher practice this discipline?

Mānava replied, “No, sir.”  
The Buddha continued:

You have degraded yourself without knowing what is true and what is
not. You have accused the sons of the Śākya sage, the followers of the
Buddha, and verbally abused them. Because you have planted the root
of this offense you will suffer in hell for a long time. This is the third
expedient means.
Again, O Mānava, suppose someone cannot realize the unsurpassable
endowment of knowledge and practice, but neither partakes of herbal
roots nor fallen fruit nor plants and leaves. He erects a great building
either in a village or town and from every person that passes by, whether
they are going east, west, south, or north, he receives provisions [from

them] according to their capacity. This is called adherence to the fourth
alternative practice (i.e., begging alms), as he is unable to realize the
unsurpassable endowment of knowledge and practice. What do you think?
O Mānava, do you and your teacher practice this discipline?
Mānava replied, “No, sir.”
The Buddha continued:
You have degraded yourself without knowing what is true and what is
false. You have accused the sons of the Śākya sage, the followers of the
Buddha, and verbally abused them. Because you have planted the root
of this offense you will suffer in hell for a long time.
What do you think, O Mānava? Many skills have been transmitted
from the ancient brāhmaṇa s and the wise compilers of the sacred hymns
(i.e., Vedas). They praised and propagated the hymns that were originally
recited through the practice of chanting, in a similar way to how contem-
porary brāhmaṇa s chant and propagate these hymns. These brāhmaṇa s
descended from (1) Aṭṭhaka, (2) Vāmaka, (3) Vāmadeva, (4) Vessāmitta,
(5) Aṅgirasa, (6) Yamataggi, (7) Bhāradvāja-Vāseṭṭha, (8) Kāśyapa, (9)
Alouna, (10) Gautama, (11) Shouyipo, and (12) Suntuo luo.^28 These great
sages and brāhmaṇa s all dug moats and built grand pavilions and buildings.
Are the residences of your teacher and colleagues like those of the ancients?
[Mānava] replied, “No, sir.”
[The Buddha continued:]
When one of the great sages and brāhmaṇa s built a residence, he also
built various houses and living quarters [for his people] around it, with
his residence in the center. Do your teacher and colleagues reside in sim-
ilar residential estates such as those of the ancients?
[Mānava] replied, “No, sir.”
[The Buddha continued:]
Those great sages and brāhmaṇa s used as seats elevated comfortable
couches and thick cushions made of delicate and smooth thread and fine
and soft cloth. Do your teacher and colleagues use anything similar to
these items that were used by the ancients?

[Mānava] replied, “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued:]

The great sages and brāhmaṇa s enjoyed many luxurious things, such
as gold and silver necklaces, variegated flower garlands, and beautiful
women. Do your teacher and colleagues enjoy such luxuries like the
ancients did?

[Mānava] replied, “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued:]

When one of the great sages and brāhmaṇa s made an excursion, he rode
on a well-embellished carriage, accompanied by attendants carrying hal-
berds. He was shaded by a white canopy, and held a duster in his hand,
wore variegated sandals, and also a golden hat and white garments. Do
your teacher and colleagues also equip themselves with such items like
the ancients when they go on an excursion?

[Mānava] replied: “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued:]

O Mānava, you have degraded yourself without knowing what is true
and what is not. You have accused the sons of the Śākya, the followers
of the Buddha, and verbally abused them. Because you have planted the
root of this offense you will suffer in hell for a long time.
What do you think, O Mānava? The ancient great sages and brāh-
maṇa s praised and propagated the hymns that were originally sponta-
neously composed and sung, in a similar way to how contemporary
brāhmaṇa s follow the tradition. Yet there seems to be no one today who,
by transmitting these hymns composed originally by Aṭṭhaka, and so
on, inspire and motivate others to wish to be reborn in the Brahmā heaven.
This state of affairs, O Mānava, can be compared with a situation in
which King Prasenajit consults and discusses matters with which he is
concerned either with other kings or ministers, or brāhmaṇa s and wealthy
householders. Suppose a common person, having heard discussion of a
matter, goes to the capital city of Śrāvastī and passes it on to other people
he meets, saying, “King Prasenajit said such-and-such.” What do you

think, O Mānava? Has the king consulted with that person about the  
matters with which he is concerned?  
[Mānava replied,] “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued:]  
O Mānava, when this person repeats the words of the king and thereby  
conveys them to the people, would the king himself appoint this person  
as his minister?”  
[Mānava replied,] “Such is impossible, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued:]  
O Mānava, this means that even though today you and others are engaged  
in transmitting and teaching people the hymns composed by the ancient  
sages and _brāhmaṇa_ s, it is impossible to expect that people will wish  
to be born in the Brahmā heaven. What do you think, Mānava, have you  
and others, having received support and care from others, been practicing  
according to the norms?  
[Mānava replied,] “Yes, sir. As Gautama says, when one receives another’s  
support, he should practice according to the norms, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued:]  
Yet your teacher, the _brāhmaṇa_ Puṣkarasārin, despite having received  
the king’s fief, when consulted by the king replied to him with unnecessary  
opinions and meaningless words, and thus he did not seriously advise  
him by showing what is proper. You are now seeing your own faults and  
those of your teacher. Put this matter aside for a moment; now you should  
find out whatever it is that you have been sent [by your teacher] to do.  
Mānava at once raised his eyes to look at the Tathāgata’s body, seeking  
the eminent signs of the great person. He could see all the marks except for  
two, and immediately fell into doubt.  
At that moment, the World-honored One quietly thought to himself, “Now  
this fellow Mānava does not see two of the eminent marks and immediately  
felt doubt.” At once, [the Buddha] stuck out his tongue and displayed the  
mark in question, and licked his [own] ears with his wide, long tongue that  
covered his entire forehead.

Mānava still felt doubt about the last mark of the great being. The World-  
honored One once again thought to himself, “Now this fellow Mānava is still  
concerned with the final mark that he has not seen.” By means of supernormal  
power, [the Buddha] then allowed Mānava to see the mark of the genital organ  
hidden within folds, like that of a horse. Thereupon Mānava, having seen all  
the eminent marks of the Tathāgata, had no more doubt in his mind. At once  
he stood up from his seat and, after circumambulating the Buddha, departed.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ Puṣkarasārin came out to the gate of his residence and saw  
his disciple returning from a distance. He went forward to meet him and  
asked him:

Have you seen Gautama to examine whether he really has the eminent  
marks? And does he have all the meritorious supernormal powers, as  
we have been told?  
Mānava replied to his teacher:  
The _śramaṇa_ Gautama possesses all of the thirty-two eminent marks  
without exception, sir. And it is exactly as we have been informed that  
he has all the meritorious supernormal powers, sir.  
The teacher again questioned him, “Did you discuss anything with him?”  
Mānava replied, “Yes, sir. I exchanged words with Gautama.”  
The teacher again asked, “What did you discuss with him?”  
Mānava then reported to his teacher in detail exactly how he had encoun-  
tered the Buddha and what he had discussed with him.  
[Puṣkarasārin] said:  
I thought that I had finally gotten a sharp-minded disciple, but as you  
behaved in my proxy so poorly like that, it will not be long before your  
deeds will cause me to fall into hell. Why? Because you desired so eagerly  
to accuse Gautama, making him displeased with the fact that [initially]  
I avoided seeing him. Because you, my ablest disciple, acted so poorly  
in representing me, you will surely cause me to fall into hell before long.  
Thereupon, out of his anger and dissatisfaction the teacher kicked Mānava  
out of his carriage. [Puṣkarasārin] then took his seat in the carriage, while  
Mānava, falling to the ground, immediately contracted leprosy.

The _brāhmaṇa_ Puṣkarasārin looked up at the position of the sun and  
quietly thought to himself, “It is not the right time to go see the _śramaṇa_  
Gautama. I should wait until tomorrow to visit him.”  
The next morning, the _brāhmaṇa_ had his carriage prepared and, accom-  
panied by five hundred disciples, he proceeded to the Icchānaṅkala Grove.  
Reaching the forest, he dismounted from the carriage and went on foot toward  
the World-honored One. Upon arrival, he exchanged respectful greetings  
with a bow and sat down to one side. He then looked at the Tathāgata, exam-  
ining the eminent marks. Having observed all the marks satisfactorily except  
for the two that he could not see, the _brāhmaṇa_ fell into doubt as to whether  
the Tathāgata really had [these two marks]. The Buddha, immediately knowing  
[Puṣkarasārin’s] mind, at once stuck out his wide and long tongue and licked  
his ears and covered his forehead with it. The _brāhmaṇa_ still hesitated, in  
doubt about the last remaining mark. The Buddha, again knowing his thought,  
applied his supernormal power so that _brāhmaṇa_ could see the mark of the  
genital organ hidden within folds, like that of a horse. The _brāhmaṇa_ at last  
witnessed all the thirty-two eminent marks of the Tathāgata and was thereby  
totally freed from his presumption and doubt.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ made a special request to the Buddha:  
When I am on the way, driving a carriage, if I meet the Buddha on the  
road I will stop my carriage for a short while. May Your Holiness know  
that, by doing so, I have already paid respect to the Buddha. Why is  
this so, sir? Because when I am going to receive the fief of a village, if  
I dismount from the carriage I will lose the fief and a rumor against me  
will surely spread, sir.  
Again, he said to the Buddha:  
If I dismount from the carriage I will remove my sword and put away  
my umbrella, as well as remove my flag, pitcher, and sandals, sir. May  
Your Holiness know that, by doing so, I have already venerated the  
Tathāgata. Why is this so, sir? I am obliged to uphold the five symbols  
of authority for the fief I am to receive. If I venerate anyone, [letting go  
of any of the five symbols of authority,] I will lose that fief and a bad  
rumor against me will surely spread, sir.

Again the _brāhmaṇa_ said to the Buddha:  
If I see the Buddha while among a group of people, I will stand up and  
expose my right elbow and announce my family name. May Your Holi-  
ness know that, by doing so, I have already venerated and paid my respect  
to the Tathāgata. Why is this so, sir? When I am to receive a fief, if I  
venerate anyone I will immediately lose that fief and a bad rumor against  
me will surely spread, sir.  
Again he said to the Buddha:  
I will take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. May Your Holiness  
permit me to become a lay devotee according to the right Dharma. From  
now on I shall adhere to the five precepts, namely, abstinence from taking  
life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from speak-  
ing falsehoods, and from the state of indolence arising from [the use of]  
intoxicants. May I request that the World-honored One as well as the  
members of the sangha accept my invitation for almsfood, sir.  
The World-honored One, remaining silent, thus granted the _brāhmaṇa’_ s  
wish. Having understood that because the World-honored One had remained  
silent his wish had been granted, [Puṣkarasārin] immediately arose from his  
seat, venerated the Buddha without awareness, circumambulated him three  
times, and departed.  
Returning to his residence, the _brāhmaṇa_ prepared food and drink and, hav-  
ing completed the preparations, he notified that everything was ready for the  
sangha to receive the meal. Thereupon the World-honored One, putting on his  
outer robe and with his almsbowl in hand, accompanied by one thousand two  
hundred fifty _bhikṣu_ s, arrived at the residence and took their seats at the places  
prepared for them. The _brāhmaṇa_ then served varieties of delicious food for  
the Buddha and the members of the sangha with his own hands. After the meal  
was over, the bowls were set aside and water for rinsing was brought.  
Thereupon, [Puṣkarasārin], holding the elbow of his disciple Ambaṭṭha  
with his right hand, went before the World-honored One and said to him, “I  
earnestly entreat of you, O Tathāgata, may Your Holiness graciously pardon  
this student on account of his repentance, sir.”

In this manner, he repeated these words three times, and then said to the  
Buddha:

It is like a well-trained elephant or horse. Even though such an animal  
may stumble and fall, it may yet return to the right course, sir. This man  
is also like that. Although he committed a flaw and an offense, may Your  
Holiness pardon him on account of his repentance.  
The Buddha replied to the _brāhmaṇa,_ “I will pardon him, O _brāhmaṇa_.  
May you live a long life, free from troubles, and may your disciple be freed  
from his leprosy.  
No sooner than the Buddha had spoken these words, the _brāhmaṇa’_ s dis-  
ciple was cured from the illness of leprosy.  
Thereupon, the _brāhmaṇa_ brought out a small cushion and sat before the  
Buddha. The World-honored One began to teach the Dharma for the sake of  
[Puṣkarasārin]. He encouraged him, benefited him, and delighted him by  
teaching the doctrines of charity, of morality, and of rebirth in heaven. He  
also taught that desires are unclean and impure, that the influences of defile-  
ments that bind one to the _rūpa_ realm of existence (i.e., the realm of form)  
are dangerous, and that the essential method of distancing oneself from both  
pleasure and pain is superior [as the goal of religious salvation], and then  
concluded by emphasizing [the qualities of] purity and genuineness.  
At that time, the World-honored One observed that the mind of the _brāhmaṇa_  
had become receptive, pure and spotless, and he knew that he was ready to  
accept the teaching of the path. Following the norms of the buddhas, the World-  
honored One introduced the doctrine of the noble truth of suffering, the noble  
truth of the cause of suffering, the noble truth of the cessation of suffering, and  
the noble truth of the path of cessation (i.e., the Four Noble Truths).  
The _brāhmaṇa_ then, at that single session, exhausted all of the defilements  
and thus acquired genuine insight into the nature of the Dharma, just as a white  
cloth can easily be dyed any color. The _brāhmaṇa_ Puṣkarasārin was also like  
this. Having seen the Dharma he acquired it, and was destined to realize the  
fruit of the path. He did not believe any other doctrine and thus realized the  
state of fearlessness (i.e., absolute confidence). He then said to the Buddha:

I now would like to repeat my statement: I take refuge in the Buddha,
Dharma, and Sangha. May Your Holiness permit me to become a lay

devotee in the right Dharma. Until the end of my body and life I will  
adhere to the [five] precepts of not taking life, not taking what is not  
given, not committing sexual misconduct, not speaking falsehoods, and  
not ingesting intoxicants. May I request that the World-honored One as  
well as the members of the sangha show compassion toward me by  
accepting my invitation for almsfood for seven days, sir.  
The World-honored One, remaining silent, thus granted his wish. The  
_brāhmaṇa_ then served the Buddha and the members of the sangha for seven  
days with almsfood and offerings.  
After the seven days had passed, the World-honored One departed to travel  
through various communities. Not long after the Buddha left the Icchānaṅkala  
Grove, the _brāhmaṇa_ Puṣkarasārin became ill and passed away. The _bhikṣu_ s  
then were informed that after serving the Buddha with almsfood and offerings  
for seven days, the _brāhmaṇa_ had passed away. They all wondered where the  
_brāhmaṇa_ would be reborn. Some of the _bhikṣu_ s visited the World-honored  
One and, after venerating the Buddha, they sat down to one side and asked him:

The _brāhmaṇa_ [Puṣkarasārin] completed his service to the Buddha of  
almsfood and offerings for seven days. After his body dissolves at the  
end of his life, where indeed will he be reborn, sir?  
The Buddha replied to them:  
That son of good family [Puṣkarasārin], endowed with the meticulous  
discipline of collecting all good actions universally, never committed an  
error regarding the practice of the disciplines and thus terminated the five  
kinds of defilement that bind sentient beings to the lower realm of desire  
(i.e., _kāmadhātu_ ). He will be reborn among the gods, and from there he  
will enter final nirvana and will not return to this world.  
Having heard the Buddha’s answer, the _bhikṣu_ s were delighted, received  
the teaching, and carried out what the Buddha taught.

(^17) This phrase is adopted from the Pāli text; the Chinese text has “Your father’s secret  
method.”  
(^18) The phase “the beginning of things” that occurs in this section is from the Pāli text.  
(^19) Śuklabhūmi is referred to as Uttarakā in the Pāli text.  
(^20) Kalyāṇa-jātika is rendered as “One Who Has a Favorable Birth” in the Chinese text.  
(^21) The five kinds of defilement that bind sentient beings to the lower realm of desire are  
(1) the heretical belief in a self, (2) attachment to practices and observances other  
than those approved by the Buddha, (3) doubt, (4) sexual desire, and (5) malice.  
(^22) According to Max Weber, world religions can be grouped into four types of religion  
by cross-tabulating the types of asceticism, mysticism, other-worldliness, and inner-  
worldliness. Weber put ancient Buddhism into the category of “otherworldly mysti-  
cism.” While I do not agree with the term “mysticism,” I conditionally agree with

Notes

another term Weber uses, characterizing early Buddhism as a type of “otherworldly
asceticism” on the grounds that Buddhism was committed to moral and religious dis-
ciplines that sought to avoid subjective desires, and to the complete dissociation of
the individual self from worldly concerns for the sake of religious emancipation. See
Max Weber, The Sociology of Religion (Boston: Beacon Press, 1863), p. 51; see espe-
cially T. Parson’s Introduction, pp. xlvi-lii.
The Ambaṭṭha Sutta is one of the most important sources of Buddhist critical thought
on the Brahmanical caste system. The legend narrated by the Buddha attests the theory
that the system of class divisions in ancient India fundamentally evolved on the principle
of endogamy (rules of marriage), and the Buddha’s critical instruction is aimed at
Ambaṭṭha’s caste-bound self-esteem as a brāhmaṇa, highest among the four castes, in
abusing the Śākyas, kinsmen of the Buddha, as being rude and uncivilized toward him.
The Buddha’s response is threefold: First, he made Ambaṭṭharecognize a Brah-
manical legend explaining that brāhmaṇa swere descended from the family of Kanhā -
yana (“black-skinned”), whose mother was a brāhmaṇa woman in servitude who had
been impregnated by the legendary Indo-Arian ruler Okkāka, while the Śākyas are
descended directly from the four princes of that king. When they were exiled to the
northeastern Himalayan region, they successfully built their colony as a Śākyan republic.
Second, the Buddha directly referred to the family laws on which Ambaṭṭha claims
his status, bringing him to recognize that these laws do not support his claim as being
of the highest caste. Third, the Buddha let Ambaṭṭhaknow that the Śākyas renounced
their status in the familial system to seek religious liberation for the goal of the unsur-
passable endowment of knowledge and practice. He then questioned Ambaṭṭhaas to
whether his teacher as well as himself have renounced their social status in the practice
of any of the four dietary disciplines.
Śākyamuni’s renunciation and eventual formation of his sangha cannot be fully
understood without taking into account the tragic ordeal of Śākya society and the
destruction of their state. Descriptions of Śākya society and its tragic history were,
however, preserved only in the form of legendary Jātaka (biographical) stories. Just
as the present chapter of the DīrghaĀgama , the official literature does not reveal the
historical background of the Śākya republic, whereas the collection of Jātaka s, espe-
cially Bhaddasālajātaka no. 465, IV, 144–153, relates it as historical fact. Arnold
Toynbee, in his theory of “historical challenge and response,” was convinced that,
just like any other world religion, the beginning of Buddhism was a deliberate con-
figuration of social problem solutions; see Arnold Toynbee and Jane Caplan, A Study
of History: The First Abridged One-Volume Edition (Oxford: Oxford University Press,
1972), p. 44; Shohei Ichimura, “Revisiting the Times of Śākyamuni Buddha,” in
Radha vallabh Tripathi, ed., Srutimahati Glory of Sanskrit Tradition: Prof. Ram Karan
Sharma Felicitation Volume, vol. 2 (Delhi: Pratibha Prakashan, 2008), and “Śākya-
muni’s Critical Spirituality and India’s Crisis,” in Shohei Ichimura, Buddhist Critical
Spirituality: Prajñā and Śūnyatā (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 2001).

(^23) The family name Kaṅhāyana is given in thePāli text as “Dark.”  
(^24) The name Okkāka (Pāli, “Whose Voice Emits Light) is rendered as “Shengmo” in  
the Chinese text and in Sanskrit as “Ikṣvāku.”

Notes

(^25) “Śākya” in Sanskrit also means “residents of the _sāka_ tree forest.”  
(^26) The five obstacles that prevent the arising of good mental elements are desire, anger,  
torpor and drowsiness, frivolity and mental disturbance, and doubt.  
(^27) In the Buddha’s time it was a general custom that those who gave up their class status  
to seek different goals in life had a choice of one of four dietary methods or practices.  
When the Buddha himself renounced his Śākya clan membership, he is said to have  
traded his princely clothing for the clothes of a poor woodcutter outside the border of  
the Śākya teritory. It is likely that he himself followed strict dietary practices before  
his realization of enlightenment. In the narrative of the Buddha’s attainment of supreme  
enlightenment he is said to have bathed in the Nairañjana River. It happened that a  
village girl saw him bathing, his body emaciated from long fasting, at the river and  
offered rice gruel to him. Thus refreshed, he sat under the _bodhi_ tree in the practice  
of austerity, seeking the final moment of realization. The Buddha initiated almsrounds  
for his initial five disciples when he first taught them at the Deer Park, near Benares,  
because it was possible for a few _bhikṣu_ s to collect enough alms to provide for a larger  
group, thus saving time for more individuals to engage in ascetic practice and study.  
The Buddha asks Ambaṭṭhaif his teacher Puṣkarasārin, who, despite having been  
granted a fief, had failed in his duty to counsel King Prasenajit, was engaged in the  
proper practice of austerity to meet the king’s expectation, and he also asks Ambaṭṭha  
if he himself was trying to do his best in the practice of austerity in order to be worthy  
of respect not simply on the basis of his birth as a _brāhmaṇa_. See Ichimura, “Revisiting  
the Times of Śākyamuni Buddha.”  
(^28) In the Pāli text the seventh name, Bhāradvāja-Vāseṭṭha, is divided into two, and Bhagu  
appears as the tenth name; the ninth to twelfth names, Alouna, Gautama, Shouyipo,  
and Suntuoluo,are not given in the Pāli text.
