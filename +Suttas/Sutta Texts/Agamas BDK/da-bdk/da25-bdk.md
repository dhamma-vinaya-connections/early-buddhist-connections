### A Naked Brāhmaṇa Ascetic

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 8: Kassapa-sīhanāda Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. Once, when the Buddha was staying in the Deer Forest  
near Kaṇṇakaṭṭha in the country of Ujuññā, accompanied by one thousand  
two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s, a naked _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic whose family name  
was Kāśyapa (Pāli Kassapa) came to visit the World-honored One. He bowed  
cordially and took a seat to one side. Then he said:

Sir, I have heard the following: “The śramaṇa Gautama rejects any and
all kinds of sacrificial rites and disparages those engaged in ascetic practice
as vulgar and impure.” O Gautama, when someone says, “The śramaṇa
Gautama rejects any and all kinds of sacrificial rites and disparages those
engaged in ascetic practice as vulgar and impure,” is he really speaking
the truth and demonstrating the truth of the Dharma, or is he slandering
the śramaṇa Gautama?
The Buddha replied:
O Kāśyapa, if anyone says, “The śramaṇa Gautama rejects any and all kinds
of sacrificial rites and disparages those engaged in ascetic practice as vulgar
and impure,” he is neither speaking truth nor demonstrating the truth of the
Dharma and is entirely intent on slandering me. It is not true. Why? O
Kāśyapa, when I observe those engaged in ascetic practice, I know that
some will fall into a hell after the dissolution of the body at the end of life,
while others who have a good destiny will be reborn in a heaven. I also see
that even though some might enjoy their ascetic practice, after the dissolution
of the body at the end of life, they are still destined for a hell, while others
who enjoy their ascetic life and have a good destiny will be reborn in one
of the heavens after the dissolution of the body at the end of life.
O Kāśyapa, I have observed and comprehended those born with two
opposing destinies as their reward for life on earth. How could I criticize

those ascetics as vulgar and impure? When I assert correctly that something
is right, someone may say that it is not right, and if I assert correctly that
something is not right, he will say that it is right.
O Kāśyapa, in speaking of the truth of religion, śramaṇa s and brāh-
maṇa s have something in common, yet there is a difference between their
religious truths.
O Kāśyapa, I have not spoken about the difference between their two
truths because śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s do not see that aspect of the truth
in the same way.
Those who are learned may think to themselves, “As to the elements
[of the mind] that the śramaṇa Gautama and teachers of other schools
agree are evil ( akuśala ), ignoble, corrupt, and unfit for the wise and saintly,
which of them (i.e., the Buddha or the teachers of other schools) can really
terminate those evils?”
O Kāśyapa, when people of intelligence examine the problem in this
manner and arrive at a conclusion ( jian; dṛṣṭi ), they say, “The śramaṇa
Gautama alone can terminate those evils.” O Kāśyapa, when people of
intelligence observe the problem, make deductions, and arrive at their
conclusion in this manner, my name is praised.
Again, O Kāśyapa, those who are learned may think to themselves,
“As to the elements [of the mind] that the disciples of the śramaṇa Gautama
and the disciples of teachers of other schools agree are evil, ignoble, cor-
rupt, and unfit for the wise and saintly, which group of disciples can really
terminate those evils?”
O Kāśyapa, when people of intelligence examine the problem in this
manner and arrive at a conclusion, they say, “Only the disciples of the
śramaṇa Gautama can terminate those evils.” O Kāśyapa, when people
of intelligence observe the problem, make deductions, and arrive at their
conclusion in this manner, it is my disciples whose names are praised.
Then, O Kāśyapa, those who are learned may think to themselves, “As
to the elements [of the mind] that the śramaṇa Gautama and teachers of
other schools agree are clean, genuine, subtle, and fit for the wise and
saintly, which of them (i.e., the Buddha or the teachers of other schools)
can really promote the good [elements] in the disciplines they practice?”

O Kāśyapa, when people of intelligence examine the problem in this  
manner and arrive at a conclusion, they say, “The _śramaṇa_ Gautama alone  
can promote those good [elements].” O Kāśyapa, when people of intel-  
ligence observe the problem, make deductions, and arrive at their con-  
clusion in this manner, my name is praised.  
Again, O Kāśyapa, those who are learned may think to themselves, “As  
to the elements [of the mind] that the disciples of the _śramaṇa_ Gautama  
and the disciples of teachers of other schools agree are clean, genuine,  
subtle, and fit for the wise and saintly, which of the two [groups of disciples]  
can really promote the good [elements] in the displines they practice?”  
O Kāśyapa, when people of intelligence examine the problem in this  
manner and arrive at a conclusion, they say, “Only the disciples of the _śra-  
maṇa_ Gautama can promote the good [elements].” O Kāśyapa, when people  
of intelligence observe the problem, make deductions, and arrive at their  
conclusion in this manner, it is my disciples whose names are praised.  
O Kāśyapa, when there is a path, there are corresponding methods of  
practice. When a _bhikṣu_ follows the [prescribed] methods of practice on  
the path, he will know and see for himself that the _śramaṇa_ Gautama is  
“one who speaks the truth,” “one who speaks at the proper time,” “one  
who speaks with useful words,” “one who speaks in accord with the doc-  
trine,” and “one who speaks in accord with the rules of conduct.”  
However, there are impure forms of ascetic practice through which some  
obtain the title of _brāhmaṇa_ or _śramaṇa._ What are the impure forms of  
ascetic practice through which some obtain the title of _brāhmaṇa_ or _śramaṇa_?  
O Gautama, some of them go about naked, cover the front of their bodies  
with both hands, and accept neither evening food nor leftover food, or food  
placed within a threshold, or between two people, two canes, or two plates  
(a mortar and pestle?), or from a family who have eaten together, or from  
any house with a pregnant woman inside, or a dog in front, or where flies  
are swarming; they will not take food to which they have been invited or  
from a family that is acquainted with any other ascetic, and they will not  
accept fish, meat, intoxicants, or anything placed on two plates.  
They will accept a meal and a drink, and so on, up to the seventh (i.e., to  
swallow), and then they stop. When they accept almsfood or other helpings,

they do not go beyond the seventh (i.e., swallowing the food). They may  
partake of one meal a day or a single meal every two or three or four or  
five or six or seven days. In addition to berries, they may partake of  
potherbs, rice scum, sesame seeds (or hemp grain), wild rice, cow dung,  
or antelope dung. From plants, they may partake of roots, leaves, and  
branches, and hanging fruit or windfall.  
They will wear any clothing of poor quality, including those made  
from _sha_ grass ( _kuśa_ grass?) fibers; they will wear bark garments, cover  
the body with grass, or put on an antelope hide; they will let their hair  
grow until it covers the body, or wear discarded clothing from a corpse.  
Some will keep their arms raised at all times, and never sit on a couch or  
chair, squatting instead; some will retain both moustache and beard even  
when their head is shaved, or lie down on a bed of thorns or a floor strewn  
with plant shells, or lie naked on cow dung, or bathe three times a day or  
three times in a night. Thus do they torture their bodies with extreme phys-  
ical pain and suffering. O Gautama, these are the ascetic practices that  
are vulgar and impure, on account of which some obtain the title of _śra-  
maṇa_ or even that of _brāhmaṇa_.  
The Buddha said:  
O Kāśyapa, those naked ascetics who wear no clothing torture their bodies  
with innumerable practices. In their way of life no one is endowed with  
moral virtue or credited with doctrinal insight. In their way of life they  
are unable to exercise the mind of endeavor, nor can they propagate that  
way of life universally.  
Kāśyapa said to the Buddha:  
Sir, what is the [true] state of the _śramaṇa_ and _brāhmaṇa_ endowed with  
moral virtue and doctrinal insight who seem to surpass all ascetic practices  
and to abide in the utmost subtlety?  
The Buddha said to Kāśyapa, “Listen attentively to what I say and examine  
it carefully. I will explain them.”  
Kāśyapa replied, “Yes, O Gautama. It is an opportune time.”  
The Buddha said:

When the Tathāgata, One Who is Free From Defilement (Arhat), appears  
in this world, he directly experiences the subtle bliss that is present through-  
out the four meditative states of absorption. Why? Through his own efort  
he maintains concentrated mindfulness, enjoying the transcendence within  
his mind without slackening in his discipline. O Kāśyapa, this is the state  
of being endowed with moral virtue and doctrinal insight, and it is of the  
utmost subtlety, far surpassing all ascetic practices.  
Kāśyapa said to the Buddha:  
O Gautama, even though a _bhikṣu_ endowed with moral virtue and doctrinal  
insight may surpass all ascetic practices, which discipline is more difficult,  
that which we have spoken of or that of the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s,  
which itself is reputed to be very difficult?  
The Buddha replied:  
O Kāśyapa, the truths of this world are incommensurate with the Dharma  
of the Tathāgata. The so-called disciplines of the _śramaṇa_ and _brāhmaṇa_  
appear to be difficult, and ascetic practices are obviously difficult, as even  
a laywoman can know, since the naked ascetics live without clothing and  
so on, torturing their bodies in every possible way. But what ordinary  
people cannot know is whether the minds of those ascetics are free of  
anger or defiled by it whether from hatred or malice. If they should come  
to know the minds of the ascetics they would not call them _śramaṇa_ s or  
_brāhmaṇa_ s. Instead, they simply assume that ascetic practices are difficult  
to do, and because they do not know the minds of the practitioners, they  
accept that the way of life of the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s must also be  
difficult.  
Thereupon, Kāśyapa said:  
Then, sir, please tell me about the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s who are  
endowed with moral virtue and doctrinal insight and regarded as superior  
beings of the utmost subtlety.  
Then the Buddha said to Kāśyapa, “Listen attentively and consider what  
I say carefully. I shall explain it to you.”

Kāśyapa replied, “Sir, I am ready to hear it.”
The Buddha said:
O Kāśyapa, with a concentrated mind and so on, a bhikṣu comes to realize
three kinds of supernormal knowledge; and with the eradication of various
forms of ignorance and delusion comes the acquisition of insight, bringing
with it the awareness of the total eradication of defilements. How so?
Because in the solitary quiescence of a concentrated mind, when discipline
and effort do not slacken, this is the result. O Kāśyapa, this is called the
acquisition of moral virtue and doctrinal insight by a śramaṇa or brāhmaṇa,
and it is of the highest and utmost subtlety.
Kāśyapa said:
O Gautama, although this is why the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s who acquire
moral virtue and doctrinal insight as you have explained are said to be
superior to the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s who follow ascetic practice, the
latter’s discipline is extremely difficult, so much so that a śramaṇa or
brāhmaṇa can hardly tell how difficult it is.
The Buddha replied:
Some lay devotees also practice asceticism. They say, “I shall wear no
clothing from this day forward, and so on, and subject this body of mine
to all kinds of torture.” Someone who subjects his body to austerities,
however, cannot be called a śramaṇa or brāhmaṇa just on that basis. If,
because of his ascetic practice, he can be called a śramaṇa or brāhmaṇa ,
then it cannot be said that the way of life of a śramaṇa or brāhmaṇa is
very difficult at all. Instead, it is because no one can be called a śramaṇa
or brāhmaṇa on account of their ascetic practice that the way of life of a
śramaṇa and brāhmaṇa is said to be difficult.
The Buddha continued:
Once, long ago, I was in the city of Rājagṛha. In the Saptaparvata cave
on the high hill, I taught the brāhmaṇa ascetic Nyagrodha the practice of
pure and genuine austerity. He was delighted and knew the serenity of
genuine faith. He served me offerings with tender care and praised me,
and his praise was the primary offering.

Kāśyapa said:

O Gautama, who would not be delighted, have genuine faith, and praise  
and serve Gautama with offerings? I too am enraptured and wholeheartedly  
savor this genuine faith in Gautama. With offerings and praise I will take  
my refuge in Gautama!

The Buddha said:

Know that there is no moral virtue of any kind or in any human world  
that can match this most efficacious moral virtue, let alone surpass it.  
There is no realization of mental concentration, perfect knowledge, appre-  
hension of deliverance, and culminating insight that can be compared to  
the mental concentration, perfect knowledge, apprehension of deliverance,  
and culminating insight that is imbued with the most efficacious moral  
virtue, let alone surpass it.  
O Kāśyapa, the lion is a metaphor for the Tathāgata, who has eradicated  
all defilements and is perfectly enlightened. The Tathāgata is called a lion  
because when he teaches the Dharma to the assembly of _bhikṣu_ s he is  
totally free of self-regard and free from any fear whatsoever.  
What do you think, O Kāśyapa? Do you say it is not valiant when the  
Tathāgata expresses the lion’s roar in teaching the Dharma? Do not dare  
to think so. For the [lion’s] roar of the Tathāgata when he teaches is valiant  
and totally without fear.  
O Kāśyapa, do you say that when the Tathāgata valiantly expresses  
the lion’s roar he does not stand within the assembly? Do not dare to think  
so. For the Tathāgata valiantly expresses the lion’s roar from within the  
assembly of _bhikṣu_ s.  
O Kāśyapa, do you say that the Tathāgata cannot valiantly express the  
lion’s roar to teach the Dharma from within the assembly of _bhikṣu_ s? Do  
not dare to think so. For the Tathāgata can valiantly express the lion’s roar  
very well to teach the Dharma from within the assembly of _bhikṣu_ s.  
What do you think, O Kāśyapa? Do you say that when the Tathāgata  
valiantly and fearlessly expresses the lion’s roar to teach the Dharma very  
well to the assembly of _bhikṣu_ s, the audience has no unified mind? Do not  
dare to think so. Why? Because when the Tathāgata valiantly and fearlessly  
expresses the lion’s roar to teach the Dharma very well to the assembly of

bhikṣu s, the minds of those who have come to the assembly have listened
to the teaching as with one unified mind.
What do you think, O Kāśyapa? Do you say that when the Tathāgata
valiantly and fearlessly expresses the lion’s roar to teach the Dharma very
well to the assembly of bhikṣu s, the minds of those who have come to the
assembly and listened to the teaching with one unified mind are neither
enraptured nor capable of receiving the teaching and faithfully putting it
into practice? Do not dare to think so. Why? Because when the Tathāgata
valiantly and fearlessly expresses the lion’s roar to teach the Dharma very
well to the assembly of bhikṣu s, the minds of those who have come to the
assembly and listened to the teaching with one unified mind are [thor-
oughly] enraptured to receive the teaching and faithfully put it into practice.
O Kāśyapa, do you say that when the Tathāgata valiantly and fearlessly
expresses the lion’s roar to teach the Dharma very well to the assembly
of bhikṣu s, those who have come to the assembly and been enraptured to
faithfully receive the teaching do not then serve the Tathāgata with offer-
ings? Do not dare to think so. For when the Tathāgata valiantly and fear-
lessly expresses the lion’s roar and so forth, [those who have come to the
assembly] and been enraptured to faithfully receive the teaching do estab-
lish an occasion to make offerings.
O Kāśyapa, do you say that when the Tathāgata valiantly and fearlessly
expresses the lion’s roar and so forth, [those who have come to the assem-
bly] and faithfully received the teaching and established an occasion to
make offerings do not then shave their hair and beards, or don the three
robes of a mendicant, or renounce domestic life for the path of religion?
Do not dare to think so. Why? Because when the Tathāgata valiantly and
fearlessly expresses the lion’s roar and so forth, [those who have come
to the assembly] shave their hair and beards, don the three robes of a men-
dicant, and renounce domestic life for the path of religion.
O Kāśyapa, do you say that when the Tathāgata valiantly and fearlessly
expresses the lion’s roar and so forth, [those who have come to the assem-
bly] and renounced domestic life for the path of religion neither perfect
the practice of austerity to reach the ultimate abode of peace and safety,
nor realize final nirvana? Do not dare to think so. Why? Because when
the Tathāgata valiantly and fearlessly expresses the lion’s roar and so

forth, [those who have come to the assembly] and renounced domestic  
life for the path of religion perfect the practice of austerity to reach the  
ultimate abode of peace and safety, where they realize final nirvana.  
Thereupon, Kāśyapa said to the Buddha:  
What does Your Reverence think, O Gautama? May I renounce domestic  
life to live in accord with this teaching (i.e., the Dharma), and may I  
receive higher ordination?  
The Buddha replied:  
When a follower of a different religious order comes to my sangha and  
wishes to renounce domestic life to pursue the path in accordance with my  
teaching, he must remain a probationer for a period of four months, observ-  
ing [how to conduct the life of the sangha] and must receive the appraisal  
of its members. After that, he may be allowed to renounce domestic life  
and receive higher ordination. O Kāśyapa, this is the regular proceeding,  
and it is simply for the sake of examining the character of a new convert.  
Kāśyapa said:  
[I understand that] when a follower of a different religious order comes  
to the sangha of the Buddha and wishes to renounce domestic life to pursue  
the practice of austerity in accordance with his teaching, he must remain  
a probationer for a period of four months, observing [how to conduct the  
life of the sangha] and receive the appraisal of its members. After that,  
he may be allowed to renounce domestic life and receive higher ordination.  
Now I am willing to take four years to observe [how to conduct the life  
of the sangha] and receive the appraisal of its members, and only after  
that will I forsake domestic life and accept higher ordination.  
The Buddha said to Kāśyapa, “I have already said that it [this process] is  
only to appraise the character of a new convert.”  
At the right time, Kāśyapa renounced his former way of life and received  
higher ordination. Not long after he began his matchless practice of austerity,  
which he pursued with a pure and faithful mind, he directly experienced the  
termination of the cause of birth and death in the present life; his practice of

austerity was complete; that which must be done [for religious salvation]  
was accomplished; and, having realized the ultimate state of arhatship, there  
was for him no more [re]birth.  
Then, having heard the Buddha’s teaching, Kāśyapa was delighted to  
receive it, and he reverentially carried out what the Buddha taught.
