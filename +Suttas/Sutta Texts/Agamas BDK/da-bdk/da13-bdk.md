### Greater Causality

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 13: Mahā-nidāna Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was staying in the country of  
Kuru at the residence of Kammāsadhamma, accompanied by one thousand  
two-hundred fifty _bhikṣu_ s. At that time, Ānanda, while sitting in a secluded  
place, thought to himself:

How marvelous it is! The insight that is imbedded in the doctrine of twelve-
limbed causality ( pratītyasamutpāda ) is so profound that I cannot fathom
it. [In contrast,] my insight, accomplished in applying mental awareness
to the function of intellect, is but a [simple] event before my eyes. What
is that which is considered profound [and which I cannot see]?

Thereupon, leaving his secluded room, Ānanda came to the place of the  
World-honored One and, after honoring him by bowing his forehead to the  
Buddha’s feet, took his seat on one side and said to the World-honored One:

A while ago, when I was practicing meditation in my secluded room,
an idea struck me: How profound must be the insight of the twelve-
limbed causality! And, how difficult it is to fathom it! [In comparison,]
my insight, accomplished in the application of mental awareness to the
function of intellect, is simply a [minor] phenomenon seen before me.
What is that insight which is so profound [that I cannot see it], sir?
At that moment, the World-honored One replied to Ānanda:
You should not give up, Ānanda. The insight of the twelve-limbed causal-
ity is very profound and difficult to understand. O Ānanda, this twelve-
limbed causality is difficult to see and difficult to know. If anyone,
whether he is an evil god, the god Brahmā, śramaṇa s, or brāhmaṇa s,
has not seen this causality before trying to fathom, investigate, and

analyze its meaning, he will be equally confused and unable to see what
this causality is. O Ānanda, I shall now explain it to you.
There is a causal condition for the fact of old age and death. Should
someone ask you, “What is the causal condition of old age and death?”
you should reply, “Birth is the condition of old age and death.” If he
asks again, “What is this causal condition of the fact of birth?”, you
should reply, “The will-to-becoming is the condition of birth.” If he
asks, “What is the condition of this will-to-becoming?”, you should
reply, “The act of grasping is the condition for the will-to-becoming.”
If he then asks, “What is the causal condition of the act of grasping?”,
you should reply, “Thirstlike craving is the condition for the act of grasp-
ing.” If he asks again, “What is the causal condition of thirstlike craving?”,
you should reply, “Sensation or feeling is the condition for thirstlike
craving.” If he asks again, “What is the causal condition of sensation?”,
you should reply, “Sense contact is the condition of sensation.” If he
then asks, “What is the causal condition of sense contact?”, you should
reply, “The sixfold sense operation is the condition of sense contact.”
If he asks again, “What is the causal condition of the sixfold sense oper-
ation?”, you should reply, “A mental and physical process is the condition
of sixfold sense operation.” If he asks again, “What is the causal condition
of this mental and physical process?”, you should reply, “Consciousness
is the condition of the mental and physical process.” If he then asks,
“What is the causal condition of consciousness?”, you should reply, “A
group of dispositional forces is the condition of consciousness.” If he
then asks, “What is the causal condition of the dispositional forces?”,
you should reply, “The state of ignorance is the condition of the dispo-
sitional forces.”
O Ānanda, in this manner, depending on ignorance ( avidyā ), there
arises dispositional forces. Depending on dispositional forces ( saṃskāra ),
there arises consciousness. Depending on consciousness ( vijñāna ), there
arises a mental and physical process. Depending on the mental and phys-
ical process ( nāmarūpa ), there arises the sixfold sense operation. Depend-
ing on the sixfold sense operation ( āyatana ), there arises sense contact
[with an object]. Depending on sense contact ( sparśa ), there arises sen-
sation (sense perception). Depending on sensation ( vedanā ), there arises

thirstlike craving. Depending on craving ( ṭṛṣṇā ), there arises an act of
grasping. Depending on grasping ( upādā na ), there arises the will-to-
becoming. Depending on the will-to-becoming ( bhava ), there arises birth.
Depending on birth ( jāti ), there arises the process of old age, sickness,
death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, and agony. This aggregate [of old
age and death] ( jāramaraṇa ), which is suffering in itself, arises on the
basis of birth. This is called the causal aggregate of suffering.

The Buddha said to Ānanda:

What does it mean to say that depending on the condition of birth, there
arises the effect of old age and death? If every sentient being were pre-
vented from being born, how could old age and death arise in anyone?

Ānanda replied, “Old age and death would not be able to arise, sir.”  
The Buddha continued:

As you say, O Ānanda, because of this causality, we know that the fact
of old age and death arises depending on birth, and that depending on
birth, there arises old age and death. The meaning of causal dependence
that I intend to explain can be found here.

Again, the Buddha said to Ānanda:

What does it mean to say that depending on the will-to-becoming, there
arises birth? If every sentient being were prevented from being driven
by the will-to-becoming toward the realm of desire ( kāmadhātu ), toward
the realm of form ( rūpadhātu ), or toward the formless realm ( ārūpya -
dhātu ), how could birth arise in anyone?

Ānanda replied, “Birth would not be able to arise, sir.”  
The Buddha continued:

As you say, O Ānanda, because of this causality, we know that birth
arises depending on will-to-becoming, and that depending on the will-
to-becoming there arises birth. The meaning of “causal dependence”
that I intend to explain can be found here.

Again the Buddha said to Ānanda:

What does it mean to say that depending on an act of grasping, there
arises the will-to-becoming? If every sentient being were prevented from
grasping desires, taking wrong views as true, taking wrong disciplines
as true, or taking the existence of a self as true, how could the will-to-
becoming arise in anyone?
Ānanda replied, “The will-to-becoming would not be able to arise, sir.”
The Buddha continued:
As you say, O Ānanda, because of this causality, we know that will-to-
becoming arises depending on grasping, and that depending on grasping
there arises will-to-becoming. The meaning of causal dependence that
I intend to explain can be found here.
Again, the Buddha said to Ānanda:
What does it mean to say that depending on thirstlike craving, there
arises an act of grasping? If every sentient being were prevented from
being driven by a thirstlike craving toward desire, toward becoming, or
toward non-becoming, how could grasping arise in anyone?
Ānanda replied, “Grasping would not be able to arise, sir.”
The Buddha continued:
As you say, O Ānanda, because of this causality, we know that grasping
arises depending on thirstlike craving, and that depending on thirstlike
craving there arises grasping. The meaning of causal dependence that I
intend to explain can be found here.
Again, the Buddha said to Ānanda:
What does it mean to say that depending on sensation, there arises thirst-
like craving? If every sentient being were prevented from experiencing
pleasure, pain, or neither pleasure nor pain, how could thirstlike craving
arise in anyone?
Ānanda replied, “Thirstlike craving would not be able to arise, sir.”
The Buddha continued:

As you say, O Ānanda, because of this causality, we know that thirstlike
craving arises depending on sensation, and that depending on sensation
there arises thirstlike craving. The meaning that I intend to explain can
be found here.
O Ānanda, you should know that from the cause of thirstlike craving
there arises an act of pursuit; from the cause of pursuit there arises an
object of pursuit or acquisition; from the cause of acquisition there
arises a value of utility; from the cause of utility there arises desire; from
the cause of desire there arises attachment; from the cause of attachment
there arises greed; from the cause of greed there arises an act of guarding;
from the cause of guarding there arises an act of defending. O Ānanda,
from the cause of the act of defense there arise armed conflicts and legal
disputes that create innumerable evils. The meaning of causal dependence
that I intend to explain can be found here.
O Ānanda, what does this mean? If every sentient being were dis-
suaded from the act of defending, how could armed conflicts and legal
disputes arise, producing innumerable evils?”

Ānanda replied, “These evils would not be able to arise, sir.”  
The Buddha continued:

As you say, O Ānanda, because of this causality, we know that armed
conflicts and legal disputes arise from the cause of defending, and that
depending on the act of defending there are armed conflicts and legal
disputes. O Ānanda, the meaning of causal dependence that I intend to
explain can be found here.

Again, the Buddha said to Ānanda:

What does it mean to say that from the cause of guarding there arises
an act of defending? If every sentient being were dissuaded from the act
of guarding, how could an act of defending arise?

Ānanda replied, “Acts of defense would not be able to arise, sir.”  
The Buddha continued:

As you say, O Ānanda, because of this causality, we know that an act
of defense arises from the cause of guarding, and that depending on the

act of guarding, there is the act of defending. O Ānanda, the meaning
of causal dependence that I intend to explain can be found here.
Again, the Buddha said to Ānanda:
What does it mean to say that from the cause of greed, there arises an
act of guarding? If every sentient being were persuaded from being
affected by greed, how could an act of guarding arise?”
Ānanda replied, “Acts of guarding would not be able to arise, sir.”
The Buddha continued:
As you say, O Ānanda, because of this causality, we know that an act
of guarding arises from the cause of greed, and that depending on greed
there is the act of guarding. O Ānanda, the meaning of causal dependence
that I intend to explain can be found here.
O Ānanda, what does it mean to say that from the cause of attachment
there arises greed? If every sentient being were prevented from becoming
attached [to anything], how could greed arise in anyone?
Ānanda replied, “Greed would not be able to arise, sir.”
The Buddha continued:
As you say, O Ānanda, because of this causality, we know that greed
arises from the cause of attachment, and that depending on attachment
there is greed. O Ānanda, the meaning of causal dependence that I intend
to explain can be found here.
O Ānanda, what does it mean to say that from the cause of desire
there arises attachment? If every sentient being were prevented from
desire [for anything], how could attachment arise in anyone?
Ānanda replied, “Attachment would not be able to arise, sir.”
The Buddha continued:
As you say, O Ānanda, because of this causality, we know that attachment
arises from the cause of desire, and that depending on desire there is
attachment. O Ānanda, the meaning of causal dependence that I intend
to explain can be found here.

O Ānanda, what does it mean to say that from the cause of utility
there arises desire? If every sentient being were prevented from finding
utility [in anything], how could desire arise in anyone?

Ānanda replied, “Desire would not be able to arise, sir.”  
The Buddha continued:

As you say, O Ānanda, because of this causality, we know that desire
arises from the cause of utility, and that depending on utility there is
desire. O Ānanda, the meaning of causal dependence that I intend to
explain can be found here.
O Ānanda, what does it mean to say that from the cause of acquisition
there arises utility? If every sentient being were prevented from making
acquisitions, how could utility arise in anyone?

Ānanda replied, “Utility would not be able to arise, sir.”  
The Buddha continued:

As you say, O Ānanda, because of this causality, we know that utility
arises from the cause of acquisition, and that depending on acquisition
there is utility. O Ānanda, the meaning of causal dependence that I intend
to explain can be found here.
O Ānanda, what does it mean to say that from the cause of an act of
pursuit there arises acquisition? If every sentient being were prevented
from the pursuit of anything, how could acquisition arise in anyone?

Ānanda replied, “Acquisition would not be able to arise, sir.”  
The Buddha continued:

As you say, O Ānanda, because of this causality, we know that acquisition
arises from the cause of the act of pursuit, and that depending on the act
of pursuit there is acquisition. O Ānanda, the meaning of causal depend-
ence that I intend to explain can be found here.
O Ānanda, what does it mean to say that from the cause of thirstlike
craving there arises an act of pursuit? If every sentient being were pre-
vented from the pursuit of anything, how could thirstlike craving arise
in anyone?

Ānanda replied, “Thirstlike craving would not be able to arise, sir.”
The Buddha continued:
As you say, O Ānanda, because of this causality, we know that the act
of pursuit arises from the cause of thirstlike craving, and that depending
on thirstlike craving there is the act of pursuit. O Ānanda, the meaning
of causal dependence that I intend to explain can be found here.
Again the Buddha said to Ānanda:
From the cause of thirstlike craving there arises an act of pursuit, and
so on, up to the arising of guarding and defending. From the cause of
sensation a similar causal series can be established; that is, from the
cause of sensation there arises an act of pursuit, and so on, up to the act
of guarding and defending.
The Buddha said to Ānanda:
What does it mean to say that depending on sense contact there arises
sensation? O Ānanda, if there was neither visual faculty, nor visual form,
nor visual perception, how could contact arise?”
Ānanda replied:, “There would be no contact, sir.”
[The Buddha continued:]
If there is neither sound nor auditory sensation, neither odor nor olfactory
sensation, neither taste nor gustatory sensation, neither the physical body
nor tactile sensation, neither intellect nor mental impression, how could there
be sense contact?
[Ānanda replied,] “There would be no contact, sir.”
The Buddha continued, “O Ānanda, if every sentient being were prevented
from experiencing sense contact, how could sensation arise?”
[Ānanda replied,] “There would be no sensation, sir.”
[The Buddha continued:]
As you say, O Ānanda, because of this causality, we know that sensation
arises from sense contact, and that depending on sense contact there is
sensation. O Ānanda, the meaning of causal dependence that I intend to
explain can be found here.

The Buddha said to Ānanda:  
O Ānanda, what does it mean to say that depending on the mental and  
physical process^16 there arises sense contact? If every sentient being  
were prevented from having the mental and physical process, how could  
there be mental contact?  
[Ānanda replied,] “There would be no mental contact, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued,] “If every sentient being was prevented from  
having a physical body and sense organs, how could bodily contact arise?”  
[Ānanda replied,] “There would be no bodily contact, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued,] “O Ānanda, if there was no mental and physical  
process, how could any contact arise?”  
[Ānanda replied:] “There would be no contact, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued:]  
O Ānanda, because of this causality, I know that sense contact arises  
from the cause of a mental and physical process, and that depending on  
a mental and physical process there arises sense contact. The meaning  
of causal dependence that I intend to explain can be found here.  
O Ānanda, what does it mean to say that depending on consciousness  
there arises the mental and physical process? If consciousness does not  
enter into the mother’s womb, could a mental and physical process arise?  
[Ānanda replied,] “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued,] “If consciousness enters the womb and does not  
come out of it, could a mental and physical process arise?”  
[Ānanda replied,] “A mental and physical process would not be able to  
arise, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued,] “If consciousness comes out of the womb and  
the fetus dies, could a mental and physical process be increased?”  
[Ānanda replied,] “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued,] O Ānanda, if there is no consciousness, could  
a mental and physical process arise?”  
[Ānanda replied,] “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued:]

O Ānanda, because of this causality, I know that a mental and physical  
process arises from the cause of consciousness, and that depending on  
consciousness there arises a mental and physical process. The meaning  
of causal dependence that I intend to explain can be found here.  
O Ānanda, what does it mean to say that depending on a mental and  
physical process there arises consciousness? If consciousness does not  
stay with the mental and physical process, there is no abode of con-  
sciousness. If there is no abode of consciousness, how could birth, old  
age, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, and agony arise?  
[Ānanda replied,] “None of these things could arise, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued,] “O Ānanda, if there is no mental and physical  
process, how could consciousness arise?”  
[Ānanda replied,] “Consciousness could not arise, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued:]  
O Ānanda, because of this causality, I know that consciousness arises  
from the cause of the mental and physical process, and that depending  
on the mental and physical process there arises consciousness. The mean-  
ing of causal dependence that I intend to explain can be found here.  
O Ānanda, therefore, the mental and physical process depends on con-  
sciousness and consciousness depends on the mental and physical process;  
the mental and physical process depends on the sixfold sense operation  
and the sixfold sense operation depends on sense contact; sense contact  
depends on sensation and sensation depends on thirstlike craving; thirst -  
like craving depends on grasping and grasping depends on the will-to-  
becoming; the will-to-becoming depends on birth and birth depends on  
old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, and agony.  
O Ānanda, [as to the causal relation between the mental and physical  
process and consciousness and the subsequent series,] the causal chains  
have been equally addressed, equally answered, equally delimited,  
equally explained, equally intuited, and regarded as an [individual] sen-  
tient being.  
O Ānanda, _bhikṣu_ s should acquire this principle of causality; this  
transcendent insight, freed from the evil influence of defilements by  
intuiting it as it really is, thereby liberates the mind from desire.

O Ānanda, the kind of _bhikṣu_ who thus realizes liberation should be  
called one who has realized liberation through analytical insight. These  
emancipated _bhikṣu_ s know how the Tathāgata is existentially limited  
(i.e., does not exist after death), how he is not limited (i.e., exists after  
death), how he is both limited and unlimited, and how he is neither  
limited nor unlimited. How do they know this? O Ānanda, [the causality  
of the mental and physical process and consciousness, together with the  
subsequent series,] have been equally addressed, equally answered,  
equally delimited, equally explained, equally intuited, and regarded as  
an [individual] sentient being. Having thus known the nature of sentient  
beings thoroughly, those _bhikṣu_ s who have realized liberation through  
transcendent insight, freed from the evil influence of defilements, though  
neither seeing nor knowing in an ordinary sense, are yet able to see and  
know the nature of the Tathāgata as it really is.  
O Ānanda, whoever speculates about the self invariably upholds the  
view that it exists, and they then regard the mental and physical aggregates  
together with sensation as an individual self. Some say, “Sensation is  
not the self, but the self is sensation.” Others say, “Sensation is not the  
self, and the self is not sensation either, but the element of sensation as  
a whole is the self.” Others say, “Sensation is neither the self, nor is the  
self sensation, nor do the elements of sensation constitute the self either,  
but thirstlike craving alone is the self.”  
O Ānanda, if someone, referring to the self, asserts that sensation is  
the self, you should say to them, “The Tathāgata distinguishes three  
kinds of sensation; namely, pleasure, pain, and neither pleasure nor pain.  
When one feels a pleasurable sensation, there is neither a sensation of  
pain nor that of neither pleasure nor pain. When one feels pain, there is  
neither a sensation of pleasure nor that of neither pleasure nor pain.  
When one feels a sensation of neither pain nor pleasure, there is neither  
a sensation of pain nor a pleasurable sensation. O Ānanda, this is because  
a pleasurable object, with which the sense faculty has come into contact,  
produces a pleasurable sensation [only]. When a sense contact that pro-  
duces a pleasurable sensation ceases, the sensation also simultaneously  
ceases to be. O Ānanda, a painful object, with which a sense faculty has  
come into contact, produces a painful sensation [only]. When a sense

contact that produces a painful sensation ceases, the sensation also simul-
taneously ceases to be. A sense object that is neither painful nor pleas-
urable, with which a sense faculty has come into contact, produces a
sensation of neither pain nor pleasure [only]. If the sense contact that
produces a sensation of neither pain nor pleasure ceases, the sensation
also simultaneously ceases to be.
O Ānanda, this is comparable to obtaining fire by friction. If someone
rubs a piece of wood against another piece of wood, creating friction,
fire can be obtained; if he keeps the two pieces of wood apart, however,
there is no possibility of creating fire. Likewise, sensation arises from
the contact between an object and its corresponding sense faculty. A
pleasurable sensation arises from contact with an object, but if this
contact ceases to be, the sensation also simultaneously ceases. A painful
sensation arises from contact with an object, but if this contact ceases,
the sensation also simultaneously ceases to be. A neutral sensation of
neither pleasure nor pain arises from contact with an object, but if this
contact ceases, the sensation also simultaneously ceases to be.
O Ānanda, these three kinds of sensation are thus conditioned [by
sense contact] and are impermanent. These kinds of sensation arise
through the causality of dependent origination ( pratītyasamutpāda ).
Whatever arises through dependent origination is subject to decay, is
mutable, and undergoes change. This causality is not the existence of
the self, nor is the self the existence of this causality. One should see
this matter as it really is, through right knowledge.
O Ānanda, one who thinks that the self exists regards sensation as
the self. Such a person is wrong. O Ānanda, suppose someone who
believes in the existence of the self asserts, “Sensation is not the self,
but the self is sensation.” You should say to him, “The Tathāgata distin-
guishes three kinds of sensations: pleasure, pain, and neither pleasure
nor pain. If pleasurable sensation is the self, then when the pleasurable
sensation passes there would come to be two selves. This is wrong. If a
painful sensation is the self, then when the pain subsides there would
come to be two selves. This is also wrong. If a sensation of neither pleas-
ure nor pain is the self, then when this neutral sensation passes there
would come to be two selves. This is wrong.”

O Ānanda, if one who sees the existence of the self asserts, “Sensation  
is not the self, but the self is sensation,” that person is wrong. O Ānanda,  
one who speculates about the existence of the self upholds the following  
theory: “Sensation is neither the self, nor is the self sensation, but the  
elements of sensation constitute the self.” You should say to him, “There  
is no sensation whatsoever. How can you say that there are elements of  
sensation? Are you identifiable with elements of sensation?’ He will  
surely reply, “No, I cannot be identified with these elements.” Therefore,  
Ānanda, one who speculates about the existence of the self, saying,  
“Sensation is neither the self, nor is the self sensation, but the elements  
of sensation constitute the self”—that person is incorrect.  
O Ānanda, one who speculates upon the existence of the self asserts,  
“Sensation is neither the self, nor is the self sensation, nor are the contents  
of sensation the self, but thirstlike craving is the self.” You should say  
to him, “There is no sensation at all. How can thirstlike craving exist?  
Are you identifiable with this thirstlike craving?’ He will surely reply,  
“No, I cannot be identified with it.” Therefore, Ānanda, one who spec-  
ulates upon the existence of the self, asserting, “Sensation is not the self,  
nor is the self sensation, nor are the elements of sensation the self, but  
the thirstlike craving alone is the self”—that person is incorrect.  
O Ānanda, [as to the causal relation between the mental and physical  
process and consciousness, and the subsequent series,] the causal linkages  
have been equally addressed, equally answered, equally delimited, equally  
explained, equally intuited, and regarded as an [individual] sentient  
being. O Ānanda, those _bhikṣu_ s, having thus known the nature of human  
existence thoroughly as it really is, are liberated from the mind of desire  
by acquiring transcendent insight, thereby freed from the evil influence  
of defilements. They are called ones who have realized liberation through  
analytical insight. The _bhikṣu_ s who have realized liberation know the  
existence of the self, the nonexistence of the self, both the existence and  
nonexistence of the self, as well as neither the existence nor nonexistence  
of the self. How is this so? O Ānanda, [regarding the causality of depend-  
ent origination,] the causal linkages have been equally addressed, equally  
answered, equally delimited, equally explained, equally intuited, and  
regarded as an [individual] sentient being. Having thus known the nature

of human existence thoroughly, those bhikṣu s realize liberation through
the attainment of transcendent insight, freed from the evil influence of
defilements. Though neither seeing nor knowing in an ordinary sense,
they are able to see and know the aforementioned fourfold knowledge.
The Buddha said to Ānanda:
Among those who speculate about the existence of the self, it has been
equally established that some identify certain [nonsentient] material ele-
ments with a “self”; others identify unlimited material elements with a
“self”; further, others identify a small portion of the mental or sentient
elements (i.e., the four remaining mental aggregates) with a “self”; while
yet others identify unlimited mental elements with a “self.” O Ānanda,
those who identify a part of the material elements with the self are con-
vinced that their view alone is good, and all other views are wrong.
Those who identify unlimited material elements with the self are also
convinced that their view alone is good, and all the other views are
wrong. Those who identify limited mental elements with the self are
convinced that their view alone is good, and all other views are wrong.
Those who identify unlimited mental elements with the self are convinced
that their view is good, and all other views are wrong.
The Buddha said to Ānanda:
Some śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s assert that the seven abodes of con-
sciousness and the two higher abodes are a safe haven, a place of release,
of protection, like a house, guiding lights, wisdom, a refuge, free from
falsity and defilement. What are these seven? The first is when sentient
beings possess different bodies and different ideations. These are humans
and heavenly beings. This is the initial abode of consciousness. Some
śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s assert, “This is the place of safe haven, of
release, of protection, a house, a light, wisdom, a refuge, free from falsity
and defilement.” O Ānanda, if a bhikṣu knows this initial abode of con-
sciousness, its causal origin derived from the totality of causes and condi-
tions, its cessation, their pleasure and pain, and the way of transcending it,
he sees things as they really are. O Ānanda, such a bhikṣu would say, “I
have seen that the aggregates are not the self, nor is the self the aggregates.

I have seen the aggregates as they really are.” [Second,] when sentient  
beings possess individual bodies but one and the same ideation, this is  
the time when the god Brahmā was initially born in Ābhāsvara Heaven,  
where communication is transmitted by light instead of sound. [Third,]  
when sentient beings possess one and the same body but different  
ideations, this is Ābhāsvara Heaven. [Fourth,] when sentient beings pos-  
sess one and the same body and ideation, this is Śubhakṛtsna Heaven.  
Fifth is when sentient beings abide in the sphere of infinite space; sixth  
is when sentient beings abide in the sphere of infinite consciousness;  
and seventh is when sentient beings abide in the sphere of nothingness  
or nonutility. These are the seven abodes of consciousness. Some _śra-  
maṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s assert that these are places of safe haven where  
consciousness may abide, a place of release, of protection, a house, a  
guiding light, wisdom, a refuge, free from falsity and defilement. O  
Ānanda, if, however, a _bhikṣu_ knows these abodes of consciousness,  
their causal origin derived from the totality of causes and conditions,  
their cessation, their pleasure and pain, and the way of transcending  
them, he sees things as they really are. Such a _bhikṣu_ would say, “I have  
seen that these aggregates are not the self, nor is the self these aggregates.  
I have seen the aggregates as they really are.” This is the nature of the  
seven abodes of consciousness.  
What are the two bases of consciousness? They are the abodes of  
sentient beings who abide in the sphere of nonideation and in the sphere  
of neither ideation nor nonideation. Some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s  
assert that these are places of safe haven where consciousness may abide;  
abodes to be sought and protected, houses, guiding lights, wisdom,  
refuges, free from falsity and defilement. O Ānanda, if a _bhikṣu_ knows  
these abodes of consciousness, their causal origin derived from the  
totality of causes and conditions, their cessation, their pleasure and pain,  
and the way of transcending them, he sees things as they really are. Such  
a _bhikṣu_ would say, “I have seen that these aggregates are not the self,  
nor is the self these aggregates. I have seen things as they really are.”  
This is the nature of the two bases of consciousness.  
O Ānanda, again, there are eight kinds of deliverance. What are these  
eight? When one, with an ideation of form within, perceives external

forms, this is the first deliverance. When without any form or internal  
ideation one perceives external forms, this is the second deliverance.  
When one has thus terminated all defilements, this is the third deliverance.  
When, having transcended all form ideations and annihilated sensory  
reaction, one abides in the first formless state of concentration, this is  
the fourth deliverance. Having transcended the realm of infinite space,  
one abides in the realm of infinite consciousness; this is the fifth deliv-  
erance. Having transcended the previous realm, one abides in the realm  
of nothingness or nonutility; this is the sixth deliverance. Having tran-  
scended the previous realm, one abides in the realm of neither ideation  
nor nonideation; this is the seventh deliverance. Having transcended  
this realm, one abides in the final state of cessation that transcends the  
senses and ideation; this is the eighth deliverance.  
O Ānanda, _bhikṣu_ s should be able to freely traverse from one liberated  
state to another in due order as well as in reverse order. Such a _bhikṣu_  
can realize these stages of liberation simultaneously.  
At that time, Ānanda, having listened to the Buddha’s exhortation, was  
delighted, respectfully received the teaching, and carried out what was taught  
by the Buddha.
