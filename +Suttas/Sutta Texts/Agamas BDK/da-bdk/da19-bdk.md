### A Great Assembly

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 20: Mahāsamaya Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was staying in the forest of  
Kapilavastu in the Śākya country, accompanied by an assembly of five hundred  
_bhikṣu_ s. All of these disciples were arhats, without exception. Heavenly  
spirits came from all directions (lit., “ten directions”) and assembled there  
to pay their respects to the Tathāgata and the assembly of _bhikṣu_ s. The four  
gods of Śuddhāvāsa Heaven then thought to themselves:

The World-honored One is now staying in the forest of Kapilavastu in the  
Śākya country, accompanied by an assembly of five hundred _bhikṣu_ s, all  
of whom are arhats, without exception. All the heavenly spirits of the ten  
directions also came to assemble and pay homage to the Buddha and the  
assembly of _bhikṣu_ s. Let us now also go to the place of the World-honored  
One and each praise the Tathāgata by composing verses.  
Thereupon, the four gods of Śuddhāvāsa Heaven descended in an instant,  
as quickly as the time it takes for a wrestler to bend and stretch out his arm,  
to the forest of Kapilavastu in the Śākya country.  
At that time, having reached the place, the four Śuddhāvāsa gods honored  
the Buddha by bowing their foreheads to his feet, and stood to one side. One  
of the Śuddhāvāsa gods then at once composed a verse before the Buddha,  
praising him:  
At the great assembly on this day,  
All the heavenly spirits have come to assemble here,  
For the sake of the Dharma and to pay homage  
To this unsurpassed assembly.  
Having recited this verse, the god withdrew to one side and remained  
standing. Another Śuddhāvāsa god then composed a verse, reciting:

Each bhikṣu observes a host of defilements,
And singlemindedly makes effort to prevent evil influences.
Desire is like an ocean that swallows all flows of rivers,
The wise thus defends all of his senses.
Having recited this verse, the god withdrew to one side and remained
standing. The third Śuddhāvāsa god then composed a verse, reciting:
Terminating the defilements and flattening the pits of attachment,
Filling in the ditches of ignorance,
Thus abiding on the ground of purity and evenness,
Just as when controlling an elephant.
Having recited this verse, the god withdrew to one side and remained
standing. The fourth Śuddhāvāsa god then composed a verse, reciting:
Whoever has taken refuge in the Buddha
Will never fall into an evil course of existence.
Having abandoned the human body,
He will acquire the heavenly body of purity.
When the four Śuddhāvāsa gods had completed their verses of praise, the
Buddha acknowledged them accordingly. They again honored the Buddha
by bowing their foreheads to his feet, and, after circumambulating him three
times, they suddenly disappeared.
Soon after the disappearance of the gods, the Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
Now the heavenly gods have assembled. Those spirits of the ten directions
have also assembled here in great numbers to pay respect to the Tathāgata
and the assembly of bhikṣu s. O bhikṣu s, the past buddhas, arhats, perfectly
enlightened ones also attracted heavenly beings to their assemblies in
like manner, just as today this assembly has attracted them to come forth
into my presence. The future buddhas, arhats, perfectly enlightened ones
will also attract heavenly beings to their assemblies in like manner, just
as today this assembly has attracted them to come forth into my presence.
O bhikṣu s, now many heavenly gods have come to assemble, and the
spirits of the ten directions have also come here to pay their respect to

the Tathāgata and the assembly of _bhikṣu_ s. Therefore, I shall call the  
names of the gods who are present in verse. The _bhikṣu_ s should know:

Many yakṣa spirits of the earth
Are hidden in the hills and valleys,
Appearing with the aura of authority,
Wearing white garments, clean and spotless.
Having been informed of this news,
All the gods are descending from the Brahmā heaven.
I shall now call their names in due order without error,
The host of gods who are now coming.
O bhikṣu s, you should know that
The ordinary people of the world,
Even one out of hundred, cannot see them.
Why can’t they see these gods?
Looking at the host of seventy thousand yakṣa spirits,
Or that of one hundred thousand spirits,
They see no one even in one direction.
How much less could they see
All the spirits throughout the world?

The god of the earth is accompanied by seven thousand earth _yakṣa_ spirits  
of several species. Endowed with supernormal powers, brilliant light, and  
the colors of their complexions and features, bearing renowned names,  
they have all come to this forest where the assembly of _bhikṣu_ s is held.  
There is the god of the Snow Mountains (Himalayas), accompanied by  
six thousand _yakṣa_ spirits of several species. Endowed with supernormal  
powers, brilliant light, all the colors of their complexions and features,  
bearing renowned names, with hearts of delight and joy they have all come  
to this forest where the assembly of _bhikṣu_ s is held. There is the god of  
Mt. Śairagiri, accompanied by three thousand _yakṣa_ spirits of several  
species. Endowed with supernormal powers, brilliant light, and the colors  
of their complexions and features, bearing renowned names, with hearts  
of delight and joy, they have all come to this forest where the assembly  
of the _bhikṣu_ s is held. These gods and their accompanying sixteenthousands

yakṣa spirits of several species, all of them endowed with supernormal
powers, brilliant light, and the colors of their complexions and features,
bearing renowned names, with hearts of delight and joy they have all
come to this forest where the assembly of bhikṣu s is held.
There is also the god Vaiśyamitra, residing in the country of Aśvaka,
accompanied by five hundred yakṣa spirits, all equally endowed with
supernormal powers and the aura of authority. There is also the god
Kumbhīra, residing on the hill called Vepulla near the city of Rājagṛha,
accompanied by innumerable yakṣa spirits; they have all come to pay
respect and are stationed around the assembly. Again, in the eastern
quarter of the heaven there is the guardian god Dhṛtarāṣṭra, overseeing
the gandharva demigods, endowed with a great splendor; he has ninety-
one sons, all of whom are named Indra and are endowed with supernor-
mal powers without exception. In the southern quarter of the heaven
there is the guardian god Virūḍhaka, overseeing many nāga kings,
endowed with a great splendor; he has ninety-one sons, all of whom are
called Indra and are endowed with supernormal powers without excep-
tion. In the western quarter of the heaven there is the guardian god
Virūpākṣa, overseeing the kumbhāṇḍa demigods, endowed with a great
splendor; he has ninety-one sons, all of whom are called Indra and
endowed with supernormal powers. In the northern quarter of the heaven
there is the guardian god Vaiśravaṇa, overseeing the yakṣa spirits,
endowed with great splendor; he has ninety-one sons, all of whom are
called Indra and endowed with supernormal powers. These four guardian
gods who sustain the world are replete with splendor. With brilliant illu-
mination, they have all come to the forest of Kapilavastu.
At that time, the World-honored One, wishing to rid their minds of subtle,
deceptive, and unreal nature, invoked the following esoteric passages for
incantation ( dhāraṇī ):
mo jiu lou luo mo jiu lou luo / pi lou luo pi lou luo / zhan tuo na jia mo
shi zhi / jia ni yan dou / ni yan dou po na lu / wu hu nu nu / zhu / ti po

shi he / wu lian tuo luo / bi po mi duo luo shu chen tuo luo / na lü ni he /
dou fou lou / shu zhi ji po //

In this manner, the guardian gods, the _gandharva_ demigods, and the  
_rākṣasa_ spirits, all equally endowed with supernormal powers, brilliant light,  
and the colors of their complexions and features, bearing renowned names,  
with hearts of delight and joy have come to the forest where the assembly  
of _bhikṣu_ s is held. At that time, the World-honored One again invoked the  
following esoteric incantation ( _dhāraṇī_ ):

_a xi / na tuo se / na tou / pi she li sha he / dai cha she po ti / ti tou lai zha /ti  
po sha he / ruo li ya / jia pi luo / she po na jia / a tuo na jia mo / tian ti

po ya you luo tou po yan lou / su pan tu fo tou / she luo du / jia lei lou //_  
The World-honored One then invoked the following esoteric incantation  
for the sake of the _asura_ demigods:

_qi to / ba du he di / san wu ti / a xiu luo a shi to / po yan di / po san po  
si / yi di a to / ti po / mo tian di / jia li miao / mo he bi mo a xiu luo to na

The World-honored One then invoked the following incantation for the  
sake of the various heavenly gods:

a fu / ti po bi li xi jie / ti yü / po you / duo to to ba lou du ba lou ni / shi

These are the sixty kinds of gods. The World-honored One then invoked
the following incantation for the sake of sixty-eight brāhmaṇa s who excel
in the five kinds of supernormal powers:

At that time there were also one thousand and fifty _brāhmaṇa_ s, for whom  
the World-honored One again invoked the [same] incantation. There was a  
Brahmā god of the primary rank ( _subrahmā paramārtha_ ) and his retainer gods,  
are endowed with supernormal powers. There was a Brahmā youth, Tiṣya by  
name, endowed with a great supernormal power. Again, one hundred thousand  
lords of the Brahmā worlds, each surrounded by his retainers, have come [to  
that forest]. Finally, the supreme lord Brahmā, who presides over the thousand  
Brahmā worlds, having observed the assembly of the multitude around the  
World-honored One, also descended to that forest, accompanied by his retainers.  
At that time, the Evil One [Māra], having observed the assembly of the  
multitude around the World-honored One, thought with malicious intent, “I  
will take my army of demons and destroy all the members of that assembly  
until all are driven away.”  
At once [Māra] commanded the four divisions of his army and, beating  
the chariot with his own hands and shouting in a thunderous voice that shook  
everywhere, rushed toward the forest. Anyone seeing this would certainly  
be terrified. Releasing a great rainstorm with thunder and lightning, shaking  
the entire world, he approached the forest of Kapilavastu and completely  
surrounded the assembly.  
The Buddha then said to the _bhikṣu_ s in the assembly, “O _bhikṣu_ s, you  
should know that the lord Evil One [Māra] and his retainers are approaching  
with malicious intent.” He then continued in verse:

All of you, now it is time
To establish the Buddha’s Dharma firmly,
With respect and obedience to the teaching,
You should destroy the multitude of evil ones,
Just as an elephant strikes the flower bush.
Concentrate your minds, without slackening,
With pure and genuine moral discipline,
Keep your mind fixed, contemplate your thoughts, and
Thereby protect the firm intent of your minds.
If you do not slacken [your efforts] within the right Dharma,
You will cross over the ground of old age and death and
Eradicate the origin of all suffering forever.

O dear disciples, having listened to my words,  
You should exert yourself further.  
Transcend desires even without moving a hair toward them.  
This assembly will become most distinguished, and  
Acquire great insight, and name and reputation.  
With disciples as valiant [as you are],  
This assembly will be respected and revered  
By the multitude of all beings.  
At that time, many gods and spirits, including the five sages with super-  
normal powers, who had assembled in the forest of Kapilavastu, wondered  
at the strange events caused by the evil ones. When the Buddha exhorted  
this doctrine, the eighty-four thousand gods of the heavens removed all their  
defilements and thus acquired genuine insight into the nature of the Dharma.  
The _deva_ s, _nāga_ s, _yakṣa_ s, _gandharva_ s, _asura_ s, _garuḍa_ s, _kiṃnara_ s, and  
_mahoraga_ s, all human and nonhuman beings, having listened to the exhor-  
tation, were delighted and respectfully received the teaching.
