### Sutra 10

### Ten Progressively

### Classified Doctrines

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 34: Dasuttara-Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha sojourned in the country of Aṅga  
accompanied by one thousand two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s. He arrived at  
the city of Campā and stayed overnight on the shore of Queen Gaggarā’s  
lotus pond. As it was the full-moon night on the fifteenth day, the World-  
honored One sat in an open area surrounded by the assembly of _bhikṣu_ s and  
taught the Dharma throughout the night. The World-honored One said to  
Śāriputra:

Having thus instructed Śāriputra, the World-honored One folded his outer  
robe into four layers, spread it on the ground, and lay down on his right side,  
placing one foot on top of the other, like a lion.  
Thereupon, the elder disciple Śāriputra said to the _bhikṣu_ s:  
Whatever doctrine I exhort, whether at the beginning, the middle, or  
the end, is true and genuine. Each doctrine is endowed with its meaning  
and essence. It is well balanced with the practice of pure and genuine  
austerity. All of you, listen attentively, and think about and remember  
what I say. I will begin my discourse to you.  
The _bhikṣu_ s were attentive and ready to listen. Śāriputra said to the _bhikṣu_ s:  
There are ten progressively classified doctrines arranged from one to  
ten, all of which can help you remove varieties of moral and spiritual  
fetters, and thereby help you reach the goal of nirvana and bring an  
end to all suffering. These ten groups altogether comprise five hundred

Again, there is a second group of ten: (1) the double doctrinal item  
that is very useful to religious salvation, (2) the double doctrinal item  
that should be practiced, (3) the double doctrinal item that should be  
comprehensively understood, (4) the double doctrinal item that should  
be abandoned, (5) the double doctrinal item that is conducive to declin-  
ing into perversity and ignorance, (6) the double doctrinal item that is  
conducive to increasing distinction, (7) the double doctrinal item that  
is difficult to fathom or penetrate, (8) the double doctrinal item that  
should be brought to existence, (9) the double doctrinal item that should  
be known as supernormal power, and (10) the double doctrinal item  
that should be directly experienced by oneself.  
(1) What is the double item that is very useful to religious salvation?  
It means knowing shame upon self-reflection and knowing shame before  
others. (2) What is the double item to be practiced? It means the [med-  
itative] practice of calming the mind ( _śamatha_ ) and that of analytical  
insight ( _vipaśyanā_ ). (3) What is the double item to be comprehensively  
understood? It means the (noetic) category of name, i.e., the four mental  
aggregates, and the (corporeal) category of form, i.e., the material aggre-  
gate. (4) What is the double item to be abandoned? It means ignorance  
of the Four Noble Truths and desirous craving for existence. (5) What  
is the double item that is conducive to declining into perversity and  
ignorance? It means transgression of the precepts, association with the  
wicked, and breaking away from right views. (6) What is the double  
item that is conducive to increasing distinction? It means adherence to  
the precepts and right views. (7) What is the double item that is difficult  
to fathom? It means the way in which sentient beings are defiled due  
to direct and indirect causes, and the way in which they are purified  
from defilement due to direct and indirect causes. (8) What is the double  
item to be brought into existence? It means knowledge of total eradication  
of defilement and knowledge of non-origination of states of being. (9)  
What is the double item to be known as supernormal power? It means  
the sphere of conditioned elements and the sphere of transcendent or  
unconditioned elements. (10) What is the double item to be directly  
experienced by oneself? It means acquisition of knowledge of the Four  
Noble Truths and the realization of liberation.

from the realm of form leading to the realm of formlessness, and escape  
from the realm of formlessness leading to cessation. (10) What is the  
triple item to be directly experienced by oneself? It means the three  
kinds of supernormal knowledge: knowledge of the recollection of past  
lives, knowledge derived from the supernormal power of vision, and  
knowledge of the total eradication of the influence of defilements.  
O _bhikṣu_ s, the foregoing group comprises thirty doctrinal items.  
Having realized them by himself, the Tathāgata has taught us these doc-  
trinal items with equal emphasis as they really are and not otherwise.  
Again there is a fourth group of ten: (1) the fourfold doctrinal item  
that is very useful for religious salvation, (2) the fourfold doctrinal  
item that should be practiced, (3) the fourfold doctrinal item that should  
be comprehensively understood, (4) the fourfold doctrinal item that  
should be abandoned, (5) the fourfold doctrinal item that is conducive  
to declining into perversity and ignorance, (6) the fourfold doctrinal  
item that is conducive to increasing distinction, (7) the fourfold doctrinal  
item that is difficult to fathom, (8) the fourfold doctrinal item that  
should be brought into existence, (9) the fourfold doctrinal item that  
should be known as supernormal power, (10) and the fourfold doctrinal  
item that should be directly experienced by oneself.  
(1) What is the fourfold item that is very useful for religious salva-  
tion? It means the four kinds of blessings: residing in the proper place  
(i.e., the middle region of India, the Gangetic basin), association with  
and support from good friends, perfect effort motivated by oneself,  
and having planted good roots in one’s past lives.  
(2) What is the fourfold item to be practiced? It means the practice  
of four kinds of application of mental awareness. First, when a _bhikṣu_  
observes his inner body (i.e., internal senses) in concentration, he  
should exert himself with no slackening, being mindful of his obser-  
vations to keep them in memory, and thereby remove worldly desires  
and anxiety. Second, when observing his outer body (i.e., external  
senses), he should exert himself with no slackening, being mindful of  
his observations to keep them in memory, and thereby remove worldly  
desires and anxiety, Third, when observing both the inner and outer  
body, he should exert himself with no slackening, being mindful of his

O _bhikṣu_ s, the foregoing group comprises forty doctrinal items. Hav-  
ing realized them by himself, the Tathāgata has taught us these doctrinal  
items with equal emphasis as they really are and not otherwise.  
Again there is a fifth group of ten: (1) the fivefold doctrinal item that  
is very useful for religious salvation, (2) the fivefold doctrinal item that  
should be practiced, (3) the fivefold doctrinal item that should be com-  
prehensively understood, (4) the fivefold doctrinal item that should be  
abandoned, (5) the fivefold doctrinal item that is conducive to declining  
into perversity and ignorance, (6) the fivefold doctrinal item that is con-  
ducive to increasing distinction, (7) the fivefold doctrinal item that is  
difficult to fathom or penetrate, (8) the fivefold doctrinal item that should  
be brought into existence, (9) the fivefold doctrinal item that should be  
known as supernormal power, and (10) the fivefold doctrinal item that  
should be directly experienced by oneself.  
(1) What is the fivefold item that is very useful for religious salva-  
tion? It means the five kinds of effort toward ultimate cessation: striving  
to establish belief that the Buddha Tathāgata is perfectly endowed with  
the ten supreme titles, such as One Liberated from Attachment and  
Fully Enlightened One; second, striving to be free from illness and  
thus always maintain one’s physical health and well-being; third,  
striving to be honest and direct, without the vice of flattery, toward  
those to whom the Tathāgata has taught the path to nirvana; fourth,  
striving to control one’s mind, upholding it firmly and not being dis-  
rupted, and keeping in one’s memory whatever scripture was once  
recited, even long ago; and fifth, striving to be capable of investigating  
the rising and falling of the psychophysical elements skillfully, and  
thus terminate the root of suffering through the same practice as that  
accomplished by wise and saintly disciples.  
(2) What is the fivefold item to be practiced? It means the practice of  
five spiritual faculties: the faculty of faith, the faculty of effort, the faculty  
of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of insight.^31  
(3) What is the fivefold item to be comprehensively understood? It  
means the five aggregates that are the basis of clinging to existence:  
the aggregates of material elements, sensation, ideation, dispositional  
forces, and consciousness.

absorption and concentration in the practice of meditation, through  
which he acquires insight into the nature of things as they really are.  
This is the first basis of liberation. Second, having listened to the teach-  
ing and experienced inner joy the _bhikṣu_ retains the teaching in memory  
and by reciting it by heart, thus also enhancing his inner joy; third,  
when he teaches what he has learned to other _bhikṣu_ s or people he is  
bound to feel a further increase of inner joy; fourth, when he contem-  
plates and analyzes the teaching his experience of inner joy is again  
reinforced; finally, it is the same when he realizes the state of concen-  
tration as regards the teaching.  
(8) What is the fivefold item to be brought into existence? It means  
five kinds of knowledge, especially that derived from the practice of  
concentration. First, through the practice of concentration one acquires  
insight into the inner and outer cognitive interaction in blissful absorp-  
tion in the present moment as well as a subsequent effect of the future;  
second, one acquires insight into the inner and outer corporeal faculties  
as a transcendent saintly state of nonattachment; third, one acquires  
insight into the inner and outer cognitive interaction as a state that is  
[always] pursued by the buddhas and saintly disciples; fourth, one  
acquires insight into the inner and outer cognitive interaction as a state  
characteristic of total quiescence and solitude; and fifth, through the  
state of concentration one acquires insight into the inner and outer cog-  
nitive interaction as a state into which the mind enters and from which  
it reemerges.  
(9) What is the fivefold item to be known as supernormal powers?  
It means the five essential elements for liberation. First, a _bhikṣu_ should  
be neither pleased with nor disturbed by [the object of] desires nor  
intimidated by it but, mindful of the essential elements of liberation,  
he is content to distance himself from it. Even if he happens to be  
closely bound up with desire he should exert himself to control his  
mind without slackening and dissociate himself from it by distancing  
from it. When he has completely abandoned and terminated those  
defilements that were under the evil influences caused by desires he  
will be able to realize liberation. This is the first element of liberation  
from desire. It is the same with the remaining four: liberation from

thought, a _bhikṣu_ may obtain material support on the basis of the doctrinal  
teaching. Fourth, he should share whatever he receives in his almsbowl  
with his colleagues without keeping it all for himself. Fifth, when a  
_bhikṣu_ upholds the practice of precepts belonging to the practitioners  
of saintly status that should not be violated or altered but kept free from  
immoral contamination, he equips himself well with the foregoing prin-  
ciples that the learned elders praise and realizes the state of mental con-  
centration. Sixth, the _bhikṣu_ realizes the deliverance of those of saintly  
status, terminates the state of suffering together with others (i.e., equally),  
and continues to adhere to right views and various practices of austerity.  
These principles are worthy of respect and reverence, and they create  
harmony within the sangha, without any dispute or controversy, enabling  
one to act independently without the admixture of confusion.  
(2) What is the sixfold item to be practiced? It means the six kinds  
of mindfulness: being mindful of Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, and  
mindfulness of the precepts, charity, and heavenly beings.  
(3) What is the sixfold item to be comprehensively understood? It  
means the six internal bases of cognition: the sense faculties of seeing,  
hearing, smell, taste, and touch, and the mental faculty of consciousness.  
(4) What are the sixfold items to be abandoned? It means the six  
kinds of craving desire that are respectively directed to the external  
bases of cognition, i.e., the objects of the faculties: craving for the  
object of seeing, craving for the object of hearing, craving for the object  
of smell, craving for the object of taste, craving for the object of touch,  
and craving for the mental object.  
(5) What is the sixfold item that is conducive to declining into per-  
versity and ignorance? It means the six kinds of disrespect: disrespect  
toward the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha; and disrespect toward the  
precepts, concentration, and one’s parents.  
(6) What is the sixfold item that is conducive to increasing distinc-  
tion? It means the six kinds of respect: respect for Buddha, Dharma,  
and Sangha; respect for the precepts and concentration, and respect  
for one’s parents.  
(7) What is the sixfold item that is difficult to fathom or penetrate?  
It means the six kinds of highest excellence: highest philosophical

(10) What is the sixfold item to be directly experienced by oneself?  
It means the six kinds of supernormal powers: supernormal psychic  
power, supernormal hearing, the supernormal power of knowing the  
minds of others, the supernormal power of recollecting and knowing  
one’s past lives, supernormal vision, and the supernormal power of  
eradicating defilements.  
The foregoing group comprises sixty doctrinal items. Having realized  
them by himself, the Tathāgata taught us these doctrinal items with  
equal emphasis as they really are and not otherwise.  
Again there is a seventh group of ten: (1) the sevenfold doctrinal  
item that is very useful for religious salvation, (2) the sevenfold doctrinal  
item that should be practiced, (3) the sevenfold doctrinal item that should  
be comprehensively understood, (4) the sevenfold doctrinal item that  
should be abandoned, (5) the sevenfold doctrinal item that is conducive  
to declining into perversity and ignorance, (6) the sevenfold doctrinal  
item that is conducive to increasing distinction, (7) the sevenfold doctrinal  
item that is difficult to fathom or penetrate, (8) the sevenfold doctrinal  
item that should be brought into existence, (9) the sevenfold doctrinal  
item that should be known as supernormal power, and (10) the sevenfold  
doctrinal item that should be directly experienced by oneself.  
(1) What is the sevenfold item that is very useful for religious sal-  
vation? It means the seven kinds of possessions (or wealth, treasure,  
etc.): first, possessing faith; second, possessing precepts; third, pos-  
sessing a sense of shame in self-reflection; fourth, possessing shame  
before others; fifth, possessing learning; sixth, possessing charity; and  
seventh, possessing insight.  
(2) What is the sevenfold item to be practiced? It means the seven  
auxiliary disciplines of enlightenment. A _bhikṣu_ practices the discipline  
of mindfulness on the basis of nondesire, quiescence, and distancing  
[himself from worldly matters]. In like manner, he practices the dis-  
cipline of discernment of the psychophysical elements, the discipline  
of effort, the discipline of delight [in the practice], the discipline of  
freedom from physical and mental disturbances; the discipline of the  
practice of concentration; and the discipline of the mind of equanimity

proper timing, with good judgment as to proper degrees of satisfaction,  
with a good capacity of self-restraint, with good organizational skill  
to assemble others, and with good judgment about human character.  
(8) What is the sevenfold item to be brought into existence? It means  
the seven kinds of ideation or thought: the thought of the impurity of  
the human body, the thought of food as distasteful, the thought that  
there is nothing that can be enjoyed in the world, the thought of death,  
the thought of impermanence, the thought of suffering due to imper-  
manence, and the thought of suffering due to nonself.  
(9) What is the sevenfold item to be known as supernormal power?  
It means the seven kinds of effort: a _bhikṣu_ exerts himself to practice  
precepts, to exhaust avarice in preparation for the discipline of charity,  
to break any wrong view in preparation for right view, to learn as much  
as he can, to maintain the discipline of endeavor, to uphold right mind-  
fulness, and to practice meditation and concentration.  
(10) What is the sevenfold item to be directly experienced by one-  
self? It means the seven kinds of power that exhaust the influence of  
defilement. A _bhikṣu_ who has terminated the influence of defilement  
sees all the elements of existence as suffering, originated from causal  
concatenation, and which can be brought to cessation as they really  
are in reference to the essential method of liberation. He sees desires  
as a fiery pit or as a weapon, like a knife or sword. Though he knows  
the arising of desire and sees it, he is not attached to it nor does he  
abide in it. The _bhikṣu_ who has terminated the influence of defilement  
practices introspection of the causal chain in the order of cessation as  
well as in the order of origination, and thus understands the origin of  
desire and its cessation as it really is. The worldly vices of avarice and  
parsimony and evil and bad psychophysical elements—these do not  
exercise any influence on his existence nor do they arise in his existence.  
He practices the four disciplines of applying mental awareness, and is  
thus engaged with many items to be practiced and carried out. He is  
also engaged in cultivating the five spiritual faculties and their correl-  
ative forces and practicing the seven auxiliary disciplines of enlight-  
enment as well as the eightfold noble path of cessation.

the third causal factor. Fourth, having thus realized well-established  
settlement within his body and mind, the junior _bhikṣu_ does not engage  
in nonreligious or trivial speech and when he joins his colleagues he  
either talks about the doctrine or invites others to talk about it; otherwise,  
he does not forsake the discipline of noble silence. This is the fourth  
causal factor. Fifth, he attends many discourses for learning, widens  
his knowledge, and upholds it without forgetting it. He intuits the depth  
of the various doctrines, the various degrees of higher, middle, and  
lower goods, the truth of meanings and essences, and, endowed with  
the practice of austerity, he abides firmly unswayed in his mind upon  
reviewing what he has learned. This is the fifth causal factor. Sixth,  
engaged in the practice of terminating evil while increasing good with-  
out slackening, he strives hard, sustains the doctrine, and does not for-  
sake it. This is the sixth causal factor. Seventh, he comes to acquire  
the insight of origin and cessation, know the goal of saintly realization,  
and thus reaches the end of suffering. This is the seventh causal factor.  
Eighth, he analytically intuits the five aggregates of existence as to  
their origination and cessation by specifying, “This is the aggregate  
of material form, its causal context, and its cessation. This is the aggre-  
gate of feeling (sensation), that of ideation, that of dispositional forces,  
that of consciousness, the causal context of consciousness, and the ces-  
sation of it.” This is the eighth causal factor that enables a _bhikṣu_ to  
acquire knowledge when the practice of austerity has not yet been fully  
perfected, and to broaden and strengthen it when the practice of austerity  
has been perfected.  
(2) What is the eightfold item to be practiced? It means the noble  
eightfold path: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right  
livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.  
(3) What is the eightfold item to be comprehensively understood?  
It means the eight concerns of the secular world: gain and loss, disgrace  
and fame, praise and blame, and suffering and happiness.  
(4) What is the eightfold item to be abandoned? It means the eight  
kinds of wrong conduct [counter to the eightfold noble path]: wrong  
view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood,  
wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong concentration.

will necessarily be exhausted then. I cannot now practice meditation  
and meditative walking but should instead take enough rest beforehand  
for tomorrow.” The inactive _bhikṣu_ at once lies down and [thus, just  
as in the preceding cases,] he does not exert himself to acquire what  
he has not acquired, realize what he has not realized, and experience  
what he has not experienced directly by himself. This is the sixth kind  
of indolence. Seventh, again, when such an inactive _bhikṣu_ suffers  
from a minor illness he thinks to himself, “Since I am extremely ill  
and feel unwell and feeble I cannot sustain myself to practice meditation  
and meditative walking. I must rest [instead].” The inactive _bhikṣu_  
continues to lie around idly and does not exert himself to acquire what  
he has not acquired, realize what he has not realized, and experience  
what he has not experienced directly by himself. Eighth, when the  
inactive _bhikṣu_ recovers from his minor illness but again thinks to him-  
self, “I was ill and it has not been long since I recovered from it. Since  
I am still feeble I cannot sustain myself to practice meditation and  
meditative walking and should lay down to rest.” He at once lies down  
and does not exert himself to acquire what he has not acquired, realize  
what he has not realized, and experience what he has not experienced  
directly by himself.  
(6) What is the eightfold item that is conducive to increasing dis-  
tinction? It means the eight kinds of indefatigable effort. What are the  
eight kinds of indefatigable effort? First, if a _bhikṣu_ does not obtain  
alms and thinks to himself, “I am physically slight and do not need  
much sleep. I should exert myself in the practice of meditation and med-  
itative walking so as to acquire what I have not acquired, realize what  
I have not realized, and experience what I have not yet experienced  
directly by myself.” Thus he at once continues to exert himself. He is  
regarded as a _bhikṣu_ who is endowed with the virtue of effort. Second,  
having obtained alms enough to sustain himself, the aspiring _bhikṣu_  
thinks to himself, “Now I went into the village, obtained enough alms,  
and feel vigorous in my mental and physical energies. I should exert  
myself in the practice of meditation and meditative walking so as to  
acquire what I have not acquired, realize what I have not realized, and  
experience what I have not yet experienced directly by myself.” Here

and meditative walking so as to acquire what I have not acquired,  
realize what I have not realized, and experience what I have not yet  
experienced directly by myself.” Here he rallies to exert himself in the  
practice of meditation and meditative walking. These are the eight  
kinds of indefatigable exertion.  
(7) What is the eightfold item that is difficult to fathom or penetrate?  
It means the eight kinds of places where the practice of austerity is  
obstructed. What are these eight places? First, despite the fact that the  
Tathāgata, who has realized the state of arhatship, has appeared in this  
world, exhorting the supreme Dharma, quiescent and transcendent,  
and proceeded on the path of enlightenment, some sentient beings are  
born in the world of hells. This is the first place where the practice of  
austerity is obstructed. Second, despite the fact that the Tathāgata, who  
has realized the state of arhatship, has appeared in this world, exhorting  
the supreme Dharma, quiescent and transcendent, and proceeded on  
the path of enlightenment, some sentient beings are born among animals;  
third, among hungry ghosts ( _preta_ s); fourth, among the gods of extraor-  
dinary longevity; and fifth, among the nonreligious in the remote frontier  
regions where there are no believers. These are places where the practice  
of austerity is obstructed. Sixth, despite the fact that the Tathāgata,  
who has realized the state of arhatship, has appeared in this world,  
exhorting the supreme Dharma, quiescent and transcendent, and pro-  
ceeded on the path of enlightenment, some people who are born in the  
central country (i.e., India) still adhere to wrong views and perverted  
thoughts, and thus, having done evil deeds, they are bound to fall into  
hell. This is the place where the practice of austerity is obstructed. Sev-  
enth, despite the fact that the Tathāgata, who has realized the state of  
arhatship, has appeared in this world, exhorting the supreme Dharma,  
quiescent and transcendent, and proceeded on the path of enlightenment,  
some people who are born in the middle country (i.e., China) are deaf,  
blind, and dumb and cannot listen to the exhortation of the Dharma,  
nor can they engage in the practice of austerity. This is the seventh  
place where the practice of austerity is obstructed. Eighth, when the  
Tathāgata, who has realized the state of arhatship, has neither appeared  
in this world nor does he exhort the supreme Dharma, quiescent and

should have] mastery. Fifth, an inner immaterial ideation perceives the  
blue color of an external material form, for instance, like perceiving a  
blue lotus flower with blue color, blue luminescence, and bluish effect,  
or like perceiving a blue Vārāṇasī garment with pure blue color, blue  
luminescence, and bluish effect; and, having formulated an ideation  
like this, always judges it and is reminded of it. This is the fifth sense  
base [over which one should have] mastery. Sixth, an inner immaterial  
ideation perceives the yellow color of an external material form, for  
instance, like perceiving a yellow lotus flower with yellow color, yellow  
luminescence, and yellowish effect, or perceiving a yellow Vārāṇasī  
garment with pure yellow color, yellow luminescence, and yellowish  
effect; and, having always judged it and been reminded of it, formulates  
an ideation like this. [This is the sixth sense base over which one should  
have mastery.] Seventh, an inner immaterial ideation perceives the red  
color of an external material form, for instance, like perceiving a red  
lotus flower with red color, red luminescence, and reddish effect, or  
perceiving a red Vārāṇasī garment with pure red color, red luminescence,  
and reddish effect; and, having always judged it and been reminded of  
it, formulates an ideation like this. This is the seventh sense base [over  
which one should have] mastery. Eighth, an inner immaterial ideation  
perceives the white color of an external material form, for instance,  
like perceiving a white lotus flower with white color, white lumines-  
cence, and whitish effect, or perceiving a white Vārāṇasī garment with  
pure white, white luminescence, and whitish effect; and, having always  
judged it and been reminded of it, formulates an ideation like this. This  
is the eighth sense base [over which one should have] mastery.  
(10) What is the eightfold item to be directly experienced by oneself?  
It means the eight kinds of liberation. First, the liberation that is realized  
when one, with an internal ideation of form, perceives external forms;  
second, the liberation that is realized when one, without any internal  
ideation of form, perceives external forms; third, the liberation that is  
realized when one thus has terminated all defilements; fourth, the lib-  
eration that is realized when one, having transcended all ideations of  
form and annihilated sensory reaction, abides in the first formless state  
of concentration, the sphere of infinite space; fifth, the liberation that

in possession of different bodies and different ideations, these are  
humans and heavenly beings. This is the first abode of sentient beings;  
second, when some sentient beings possess different bodies but one  
and the same ideation, this is the time when the god Brahmā was initially  
born in Ābhāsvara Heaven, where communication is accomplished by  
transmitted light instead of sound. This is the second abode of sentient  
beings. Third, when some sentient beings possess one and the same  
body but different ideations, this is the aforementioned Ābhāsvara  
Heaven. This is the third abode of sentient beings. Fourth, when some  
sentient beings possess one and the same body and ideation, this is  
Śubhakṛtsna Heaven. This is the fourth abode of sentient beings. Fifth,  
again when some sentient beings reside in the sphere where one has  
neither ideation nor external awareness, this is Āsaṃjñika Heaven.  
This is the fifth abode of sentient beings. Sixth, when some sentient  
beings reside in the sphere of infinite space, this is the sixth abode of  
sentient beings. Seventh, when some sentient beings reside in the sphere  
of infinite consciousness, this is the seventh abode of sentient beings.  
Eighth, when some sentient beings reside in the sphere of nothingness  
or nonutility, this is the eighth abode of sentient beings. Ninth, when  
some sentient beings reside in the sphere of neither ideation nor non-  
ideation, this is the ninth abode of sentient beings.  
(4) What is the ninefold item to be abandoned? It means the nine  
roots of craving. First, there is craving; second, because of craving the  
act of seeking arises; third, because of seeking a gain arises; fourth,  
because of gain there arises a thought of its utility; fifth, because of  
the thought of utility there arises desire; sixth, because of desire strong  
attachment arises; seventh, because of attachment an act of grasping  
arises; eighth, because of grasping a parsimonious act arises; and ninth,  
because of parsimony an act of guarding arises.  
(5) What is the ninefold item that is conducive to declining into per-  
versity and ignorance? It means the nine kinds of hatred. First, hatred  
arises when someone thinks about another person, “He abused me in  
the past.” Second, hatred arises when he thinks, “He abuses me now.”  
Third, hatred arises when he thinks, “He will surely abuse me in the  
future.” Fourth, a person again hates someone when he thinks, “He

endowed with the practice of austerity. Fourth, if a _bhikṣu_ is endowed  
with sincere faith, moral precepts, and learnedness but has little expe-  
rience with preaching, he is not regarded as having accomplished the  
practice of austerity. When he is well experienced with preaching in  
addition to the preceding excellences he will be endowed with the prac-  
tice of austerity. Fifth, if [a _bhikṣu_ ] is well endowed with sincere faith,  
moral precepts, learnedness, and [skilled in] doctrinal preaching but  
is not capable of supporting the sangha, he is not regarded as having  
accomplished the practice of austerity. When he becomes capable of  
supporting the sangha in addition to the preceding excellences, he will  
be endowed with the practice of austerity. Sixth, if a _bhikṣu_ is endowed  
with sincere faith, moral precepts, learnedness, [skilled in preaching,]  
and [capable of] supporting the sangha but is not capable of discoursing  
on the doctrines before the assembly of the _bhikṣu_ s, he is not regarded  
as having accomplished the practice of austerity. When he becomes  
capable of discoursing on the doctrines before the assembly of the  
_bhikṣu_ s in addition to the preceding excellences, he will be endowed  
with the practice of austerity. Seventh, if a _bhikṣu_ is endowed with sin-  
cere faith, moral precepts, learnedness, [skill in preaching, and is  
capable of] supporting the sangha and [discoursing] on the doctrines  
before the assembly of _bhikṣu_ s but has not acquired freedom with the  
four levels of meditative concentration, he is not regarded as having  
accomplished the practice of austerity. When he acquires the excellence  
of freedom with the four levels of meditative concentration in addition  
to the preceding excellences, he will be endowed with the practice of  
austerity. Eighth, if a _bhikṣu_ is endowed with sincere faith, moral precepts,  
learnedness, [skill in preaching, is capable of] supporting the sangha and  
discoursing on doctrines before the assembly of _bhikṣu_ s, and [has attained]  
freedom with the four levels of meditative concentration but has not  
attained freedom with the eight levels of liberation, traversing them in  
successiveorder as well as returning in reverse order, he is not regarded  
as having accomplished the practice of austerity. When he acquires the  
excellence of freedom with the eight kinds of liberation in addition to  
the preceding excellences he will be endowed with the practice of aus-  
terity. Ninth, if a _bhikṣu_ is endowed with sincere faith, moral precepts,

(9) What is the ninefold item to be known as supernormal power?  
It means the nine kinds of causal interaction to be intuited as manifold:  
first, because the causal (external) domain is manifold the (internal)  
effectual domain that arises in correspondence with the former is man-  
ifold (different); second, because of these manifold external and internal  
domains there arises the manifold domain of contacts between the  
senses and objects; third, because of this manifold contact there arise  
manifold sense perceptions; fourth, because of these manifold sensations  
(or feelings) there arise manifold ideations; fifth, because of these man-  
ifold ideations there arise manifold conceptions;^34 sixth, because of  
manifold conceptions there arise manifold desires; seventh, because  
of manifold desires there arise manifold passions;^35 eighth, because of  
manifold passions there arise manifold yearning or seeking; ninth,  
because of manifold yearning there arise manifold gains.^36  
(10) What is the ninefold item to be directly experienced oneself?  
It means the nine stages of the successive process of cessation. First,  
when a _bhikṣu_ enters the first meditative absorption there ceases to be  
the ideation of desire.^37 Second, in the second meditative state of absorp-  
tion, the mental activity of thinking and deliberation ceases. Third, in  
the third meditative state of absorption the awareness of delight ceases.  
Fourth, in the fourth meditative state of absorption the signs of inhalation  
or exhalation cease. Fifth, in the sphere of infinite space, the first form-  
less state of concentration, the ideation of external form ceases. Sixth,  
in the sphere of infinite consciousness the ideation of empty space  
ceases. Seventh in the sphere of nothingness or nonutility the ideation  
of consciousness ceases. Eighth, in the sphere of neither ideation nor  
nonideation the ideation of nonutility or nothingness ceases. Ninth, in  
the final state of cessation, in which the senses and ideation equivalent  
to third saintly state of _anāgāmin_ have been transcended, both ideation  
and sensation cease.  
O _bhikṣu_ s, the foregoing group comprises eighty doctrinal items.  
Having realized them by himself, the Tathāgata has taught us these  
doctrinal items with equal emphasis as they really are and not otherwise.  
Again there is a tenth group of ten doctrinal items: the tenfold doc-  
trinal item that is very useful for religious salvation, the tenfold doctrinal

(2) What is the tenfold item to be practiced? It means the ten right  
practices: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right  
livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration, right  
liberation, and right wisdom.  
(3) What is the tenfold item to be comprehensively understood? It  
means the ten bases of cognition, namely the five senses and their  
respective objects: the visual organ, the eye; the auditory organ, the  
ears; the olfactory organ, the nose; the gustatory organ, the tongue; the  
tactile organ, the body; the visual object, form; the auditory object,  
sound; the olfactory object, smell; the gustatory object, taste; and the  
tactile object, touch.  
(4) What is the tenfold item to be abandoned? It means the ten kinds  
of wrong paths: wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong  
action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong  
concentration, wrong deliverance, and wrong knowledge.  
(5) What is the tenfold item that is conducive to declining into per-  
versity and ignorance? It means the ten kinds of wrongful deeds: first,  
taking life; second, theft, taking what is not given; third, sexual mis-  
conduct; fourth, [speaking] falsehoods; fifth, [deceptive speech]; sixth,  
harsh [speech]; seventh, flattery; eighth, covetousness; ninth, malicious  
intent; and tenth, [holding] wrong views.  
(6) What is the tenfold item conducive to increasing distinction? It  
means the ten kinds of good deeds: first, not taking life; second, not  
[committing] theft; third, [not committing] sexual misconduct; fourth,  
[not speaking] falsehoods; fifth, [not engaging in deceptive speech];  
sixth, not speaking harshly; seventh, [not engaging in] flattery; eighth,  
not being covetous; ninth, [not harboring] malicious intent; and tenth,  
[not holding] wrong views.  
(7) What is the tenfold item that is difficult to fathom or penetrate?  
It means the ten abodes of the saintly disciple. First, the five items of  
striving toward ultimate cessation (i.e., examination of the fivefold cog-  
nition). Second, examination of the six faculties including mental cog-  
nition: if a _bhikṣu_ adheres to the six principles of community in practice,  
his conduct is worthy of respect and reverence and is harmonious with

Ninth, when a _bhikṣu_ has realized meditative concentration and explains  
it to others, he should praise those who have also realized meditative  
concentration. Tenth, when a _bhikṣu_ has realized ultimate insight and  
explains it to others, he should praise those who have also realized  
ultimate insight.  
(9) What is the tenfold item to be known as supernormal power? It  
means the ten kinds of things to be destroyed: first, he who holds right  
views can destroy wrong views, remove all derivative evils arising  
from wrong views, cause innumerable good things to arise through  
various right views, and thereby accomplish whatever he aspires toward.  
It is the same with the remaining nine items: right thought, right speech,  
right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right con-  
centration, right liberation, and right knowledge, just as one who has  
realized right knowledge can destroy wrong knowledge, remove all  
derivative evils arising from wrong knowledge, cause innumerable  
good things to arise through varieties of right knowledge, and thereby  
accomplish whatever one aspires toward.  
(10) What is the tenfold item to be directly experienced by oneself?  
It means the ten norms of the arhat who requires no further training:  
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right  
mindfulness, right effort, right concentration, right wisdom, and right  
liberation.  
O _bhikṣu_ s, the foregoing group comprises one hundred doctrinal  
items. Having realized them by himself, the Tathāgata has taught us  
these doctrinal items with equal emphasis as they really are and not  
otherwise.  
At that time, the World-honored One cofirmed what Śāriputra had exhorted,  
and all the _bhikṣu_ s who had listened to his discourse experienced joy, respect-  
fully received the teaching, and carried out what Śāriputra had taught.
