### Brāhmaṇa Kūṭadanta

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 5: Kūṭadanta Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. Once, when the Buddha was visiting the communities in  
the country of Kauśala, accompanied by one thousand two hundred and fifty  
disciples, he stopped overnight in a _śiṃśapā_ tree forest to the north of a _brāh-  
maṇa_ village called Khānumata. A _brāhmaṇa_ named Kūṭadanta resided in  
the village, which was well populated and verdant with groves of [shade]  
trees and bathing ponds giving off a welcome coolness to any observer. King  
Prasenajit had given this village to Kūṭadanta as a fief, exempting it from  
taxation. The _brāhmaṇa_ was from a pure family line of seven generations  
and had never been slighted by anyone in society. He was thoroughly versed  
in the three ancient collections of hymns (Vedas), and had detailed knowledge  
of the various _brāhmaṇa_ scriptures as well as a comprehensive command of  
the subtleties of secular literature. He was also well trained in reading the  
physiognomy of magnanimous personalities, in divining good and bad omens,  
and in conducting ceremonial proceedings and sacrificial rites. He had five  
hundred student disciples and never tired of teaching them. To conduct a  
grand sacrificial rite, he would obtain no fewer than five hundred bulls, five  
hundred cows, five hundred male calves, five hundred female calves, five  
hundred ewes, and five hundred rams.  
On this occasion, many of the _brāhmaṇa_ s and wealthy householders of  
the village were duly informed:

The śramaṇa Gautama, son of the Śākya clan, having renounced domestic
life and realized the ultimate goal of religion, has been visiting the commu-
nities of the country of Kauśala and has [now] arrived at the śiṃśapā tree
forest north of the village of Khānumata for an overnight stay. Gautama’s
good name is renowned, and [his accomplishment] has been proclaimed
everywhere, in all countries, as worthy of the ten supreme titles, namely,
One Perfected in Practice (Tathāgata), One Liberated from Attachment

(Arhat), Perfectly Enlightened One (Samyak-saṃbuddha), and so on.  
Among all the gods and humans, as well as all the evil ones and their lord,  
and the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s too, he alone has directly experienced  
the realization of enlightenment and has been teaching others [how to  
realize that goal]. When he expounds on religion his words are good in  
the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. All the words he  
utters are invariably endowed with true meanings and real essences, and  
they are in accord with his practice of pure and genuine austerity.  
[Everyone who heard this had the same thought:] “I have heard that we  
should visit this sage and pay our respects. I will go to see this man together  
with the others.” Thereupon, all of the villagers, _brāhmaṇa_ s and wealthy  
householders alike, immediately departed together, [resulting in a great exodus].  
The _brāhmaṇa_ Kūṭadanta, observing from atop his high tower the passage  
of the villagers, asked his attendants, “Why have these people gathered and  
where are they going?”  
The attendants replied:  
I have heard, sir: “The _śramaṇa_ Gautama, son of the Śākya clan, having  
renounced domestic life and realized the ultimate goal of religion, has  
been visiting the communities of the country of Kauśala and has [now]  
reached the _śiṃśapā_ forest north of the village. Gautama’s good name is  
renowned, and [his accomplishment] has been proclaimed everywhere,  
in all countries, as worthy of the ten supreme titles, namely, One Perfected  
in Practice, One Liberated from Attachment, Perfectly Enlightened One,  
and so on. Among all the gods and humans, as well as all the evil ones  
and their lord, and the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s too, he alone has directly  
experienced the realization of enlightenment and has been teaching others  
how to realize [that goal]. When he expounds on religion, his words are  
good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. All the  
words he utters are invariably endowed with true meanings and real  
essences, and they are in accord with his practice of pure and genuine  
austerity.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ s and wealthy householders of the village all wish to visit  
the _śramaṇa_ Gautama and pay him their respects. The crowd is nothing  
but the procession of those who wish to see the _śramaṇa_ Gautama, sir.

The _brāhmaṇa_ then instructed his attendants, “Go quickly and carry my  
message to the people. Tell them ‘Please wait for a moment while I come to  
join you. Let us all go together to Gautama’s resting place.’”  
One of the attendants immediately went out and said to the people, “Good  
people, please wait for a moment [for the _brāhmaṇa_ Kūṭadanta] to join you.  
He wishes to accompany you to Gautama’s resting place.”  
The townspeople responded to the attendant, “Please return quickly to  
the _brāhmaṇa_ and tell him ‘The most auspicious moment is at hand. Let us  
[now] go together.’”  
The attendant returned and reported: “The people are waiting, sir. They  
say, ‘The most auspicious moment is at hand. Let us [now] go together.’”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ Kūṭadanta came down from the high tower immediately  
and went to the middle gate. It so happened that his five hundred students  
had gathered outside the gate to assist him in the preparations for a great sac-  
rificial rite. Seeing their [teacher] approaching, they stood up in unison and  
greeted him, “O great _brāhmaṇa_ , where are you going, sir.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied:  
I have heard about the _śramaṇa_ Gautama, son of the Śākya clan. Having  
renounced domestic life and realized the ultimate goal of religion, he has  
been visiting the communities of the country of Kauśala and has [now]  
reached the _śiṃśapā_ forest to the north of this village. Gautama’s good  
name is renowned, and [his accomplishment] has been proclaimed every-  
where, in all countries, as worthy of the ten supreme titles, namely, One  
Perfected in Practice, One Liberated from Attachment, Perfectly Enlight-  
ened One, and so on. Among all the gods and humans, as well as all the  
evil ones and their lord, and the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s too, he alone  
has directly experienced the realization of enlightenment and has been  
teaching others [how to realize that goal]. When he expounds on religion,  
his words are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the  
end. All the words he utters are invariably endowed with true meanings  
and real essences, and they are in accord with his practice of pure and  
genuine austerity. Everyone should go to see this sage.  
O _brāhmaṇa_ s, all of you, I have also heard that Gautama is knowl-  
edgeable concerning the threefold sacrificial rite [as to cattle, calves, and

sheep] as well as the sixteen sacrificial requisites. Even my senior colleagues
and elders have little knowledge of these subjects. Now, it is my wish that
we [successfully] carry out the great sacrificial rite that is approaching.
Since we have enough cattle and sheep, I will visit the śramaṇa Gautama
to inquire further about the threefold sacrificial rite and the sixteen requisites.
By fulfilling what is required on that occasion, I will acquire new merit
and my name will be renowned even to the farthest distances.
The five hundred student disciples then spoke to Kūṭadanta, advising him:
May you not be so bold as to visit him. Why? Sir, he will come here
instead, and so Your Reverence need not go to him.
A great brāhmaṇa like Your Reverence, who comes from a pure line
of seven generations, should never be slighted by anyone in society. If
you uphold [the prestige of] your pure family line, he will [eventually]
come to see you, sir. Therefore, Your Reverence should not go to him.
Moreover, your greatness as a brāhmaṇa is well known. You are thor-
oughly versed in the three ancient collections of hymns (Vedas) and have
detailed knowledge of the various brāhmaṇa scriptures as well as a com-
prehensive command of the subtleties of secular literature. Your reverence
is also well trained in reading the physiognomy of magnanimous person-
alities, in divining good and bad omen, and in conducting ceremonial pro-
ceedings and sacrificial rites. If you uphold [the preeminence of] one who
possesses this [extraordinary] knowledge, he will [eventually] come to
see you, sir. Hence, Your Reverence should not go to him.
Again, your greatness as a brāhmaṇa is reflected in your handsome
countenance, which bears the likeness and coloring of the god Brahmā.
If you uphold [the prestige of] this [extraordinary] likeness, he will [even-
tually] come to see you, sir. Hence, Your Reverence should not go to him.
Again, your greatness as a brāhmaṇa is proven by the fine moral quality
of your ever-increasing virtues and store of acquired wisdom. If you maintain
[the dignity inherent in] this [extraordinary] achievement, he will [eventually]
come to see you, sir. Hence, Your Reverence should not go to him.
Again, your greatness as a brāhmaṇa is apparent in your gentle manner
of speech and you are endowed with the highest rhetorical skill, as every
word is imbued with pure and genuine meanings and essences. If you rest

in [the propriety inherent in] this [extraordinary] ability, he will [eventually]  
come to see you, sir. Hence, Your Reverence should not go to him.  
Again, your greatness as a _brāhmaṇa_ is evidenced in your position as  
a great teacher of teachers ( _ācarya-prācārya_ ). If you maintain [the dignity  
associated with] this [extraordinary] standing, he will [eventually] come  
to see you, sir. Hence, Your Reverence should not go to him.  
Again, your greatness as a _brāhmaṇa_ is shown in your ability to teach  
five hundred students at all times. If you affirm this [extraordinary] quality,  
he will [eventually] come to see you, sir. Hence, Your Reverence should  
not go to him.  
Again, your greatness as a _brāhmaṇa_ is reflected in your capacity to  
give consultation to scholars seeking it from all quarters of the continent,  
and to give them clear detailed answers to questions about sacrificial rites  
and proceedings. If you affirm this [extraordinary] quality, he will [even-  
tually] come to see you, sir. Hence, Your Reverence should not go to him.  
Again, your greatness as a _brāhmaṇa_ is reflected in the respect and  
recognition accorded you by King Bimbisāra (of Magadha) and King  
Prasenajit (of Kauśala). If you uphold [the status conveyed by] these  
[extraordinary] honors, he will [eventually] come to see you, sir. Hence,  
Your Reverence should not go to him.  
Again, your greatness as a _brāhmaṇa_ is confirmed by your wealth and  
your storehouses filled with treasure. If you maintain [the standing of]  
one so [extraordinary] endowed with wealth, he will [eventually] come  
to see you, sir. Hence, Your Reverence should not go to him.  
Again, your greatness as a _brāhmaṇa_ is revealed in your intelligence;  
you possess complete understanding and command the power of univer-  
sally beneficial speech that is totally free from inconsistency. If you rest  
in [the preeminence given by] this [extraordinary] quality, he will [even-  
tually] come to see you, sir. Hence, Your Reverence should not go to him.  
O great teacher, since you are endowed with all eleven of these meritorious  
virtues, he will come to see you, and Your Reverence should not go to him.

Kūṭadanta then replied:

Yes, it is as you have said. What you have just said is indeed correct. I do  
possess the qualities you have enumerated; I do not deny it. Listen to me,

however. [If you know] the kinds of meritorious virtues the śramaṇa Gau-
tama is endowed with, together with what he has accomplished, you will
also know that I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
The śramaṇa Gautama was born into a pure line of seven generations,
which must not be slighted by anyone in society. Since he is from such a
pure family, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama was born into a kṣatriya family and has
a handsome appearance. As he is marked by this excellence, I should go
to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama was born into a noble family, but having
renounced his worldly fortune he has realized the ultimate goal of religion.
Since he has realized this goal, I should go to him; he will not come to
see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama, born from a pure family line and
endowed with a fair, bright complexion, has renounced domestic life and
engaged in religious practice. Since he has decisively taken up the path
of religion, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama was born into a wealthy and privileged
family, yet despite the strength of that position, he has renounced domestic
life and has realized the goal of religious practice. Since he has realized
this goal, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama is endowed with all [moral and spiritual]
precepts ( śīlavant ārya-śīlin kuśala-śilena samannāgata ) and has attained
the perfectionof transcendental insight. Since he has realized this excel-
lence, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama is skilled in the use of appropriate language
and [his manner] is gentle, harmonious, and refined. Since he has realized
this excellence, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama is a teacher of teachers and has a multitude
of disciples ( bahūnām ācārya-prācarya ). Since he has realized this excel-
lence, we should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama has [thoroughly] terminated all desires
and passions with no inconstancy whatsoever. Having eradicated all anxiety
and fear, his bearing is neither stiff nor artificial but pleasingly harmonious
and delightful. He praises the goodness in others, teaches the principle of

moral retribution, and honors [the practice of] non-harm. Since he has real-  
ized this excellence, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama is respected, adored, given offerings, and  
shown tender concern by King Bimbisāra and King Prasenajit. Since he has  
been accorded this status, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama is respected, adored, given offerings, and  
shown tender concern by the _brāhmaṇa_ Puṣkarasvādi, and also by _brāh-  
maṇa_ s such as Brahmā, Tārukkha, and Sukamāṇavatodeyya. Since he has  
attained this eminence, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama is revered, respected, adored, given offer-  
ings, and shown tender concern not only by the saintly disciples but also  
by the gods and other legions of spirits, and is followed with devotion by  
clanspeople from the Śākya, Kaulya, Uttarakā, Vṛji, Malla, and Somanā  
clans. Since he has attained this eminence, we should go to him; he will  
not come to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama convinced both King Bimbisāra and  
King Prasenajit to receive lay ordination by taking refuge in the Three  
Treasures and adhering to the five moral precepts. Since he has attained  
this distinction, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama convinced the _brāhmaṇa_ Puṣkarasvādi  
and others to receive lay ordination by taking refuge in the Three Treasures  
and adhering to the five moral precepts. Since he has attained this distinc-  
tion, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama not only granted his disciples the higher  
ordination that consists of taking refuge in the Three Treasures and adhering  
to the five precepts, but also offered the refuge of the Three Treasures and  
the five precepts to the gods, to the Śākya and Kaulya clanspeople, and  
so on. Since he has attained this distinction, I should go to him; he will  
not come to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama, whenever and wherever he is visiting  
in our communities, has always been respected, given offerings, and shown  
tender concern by all the people. Since he has attained this distinction, I  
should go to him; he will not come to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama, in whatever town or village he happens  
to visit, is always respected, given offerings, and shown tender concern

by the townspeople and villagers. Since he has attained this distinction,
I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama, wherever he travels, has never been dis-
turbed by nonhuman spirits. Since he is constantly accompanied by this
miracle, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama, wherever he happens to be, empowers
the people of that locality to perceive a heavenly radiance and hear celestial
music. Since he is always accompanied by this miracle, I should go to
him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama, wherever he sojourns on his travels,
invariably endears himself to the people so that when he departs they
weep when parting from him, wishing that he would stay longer. Since
he has always endeared himself to everyone, I should go to him; he will
not come to see us here.
Again, when the śramaṇa Gautama first renounced domestic life, his
loving father and mother were brought to tears and they grieved bitterly at
his departure and yearned for him to return. Because he has attained the
goal of his renunciation, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama, on renouncing domestic life, cast away
all his jewelry, elephants, horses, chariots, and every object of gratification
for the five senses even though he was in the youthful prime of life. Since
he has fulfilled the path of renunciation, I should go to him; he will not
come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama abandoned the throne of universal kingship
( cakravartin ) to enter religious practice. Had he pursued the life of a house-
holder he would have reigned over the four quarters of the earth as the
sovereign of all people and all worldly things, and we all would have been
his subjects. Since he has fulfilled the path of religion [instead of that other
path of glory,] I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama thoroughly understands the reforming
principle of excommunication ( fanfa; brahmādaṇḍa ) as practiced in
Brahmā Heaven; he converses with Brahmā and commends the efficacy
of this principle to others. Since he has attained this distinction, I should
go to him; he will not come to see us here.

Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama is knowledgeable concerning the threefold  
sacrificial rite and the sixteen requisites; all my senior colleagues and  
elders lack this knowledge. Since he has attained this distinction, I should  
go to him; he will not come to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama is endowed with the thirty-two eminent  
marks of a great person without exception. Since he is endowed with all  
these excellent marks, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama possesses the penetrating intelligence  
of complete understanding and is totally free from any mental unsteadiness.  
Since he is endowed with this distinction, I should go to him; he will not  
come to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama has just now arrived at the _śiṃśapā_ forest  
north of this village. He is the Honored One for me and a cherished guest  
[of this region]. I should go to him and form a close association.  
The five hundred students then said to Kūṭadanta:  
This is truly marvelous—indeed, truly marvelous, sir! Can [the _śramaṇa_  
Gautama] possess all of the meritorious virtues? If he possessed just one  
of them he could not be expected to come to us. How much less could he  
be expected to come to us when he is so fully endowed with every distinc-  
tion! Will Your Reverence allow us to go with you to greet the Tathāgata?  
Kūṭadanta replied, “If that is your wish, now is the time to come along  
with me.” The _brāhmaṇa_ ’s carriage was made ready, and surrounded by his  
five hundred students and the _brāhmaṇa_ s and householders of the village of  
Khānumata, he journeyed to the _śiṃśapā_ forest. Upon his arrival, he dis-  
mounted from his carriage and went on foot to the resting place of the World-  
honored One, whom he greeted with a bow before taking a seat to one side.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ s and householders of the village also sat down, some of  
them venerating the Buddha before doing so. Some greeted him with a bow,  
while others called out their names or simply joined their palms together to  
pay their respects, quietly without a word.  
When they had all settled into their seats, the _brāhmaṇa_ Kūṭadanta said  
to the Buddha, “I have a question, sir. If Your Reverence will permit me, I  
would like to ask it.”

The Buddha replied, “O brāhmaṇa , you may ask your question, as you
please.”
Thereupon, the brāhmaṇa said to the Buddha:
I have been informed that Gautama is knowledgeable concerning the three
kinds of sacrificial rites and the sixteen sacrificial requisites. Sir, of these
matters, neither myself nor my senior colleagues and elders are well
informed. In order to fulfill a [longstanding] wish to conduct the great
sacrificial rite, I have so far obtained five hundred bulls, five hundred
cows, five hundred male calves, five hundred female calves, five hundred
ewes, and five hundred rams. Today I have come to ask Your Reverence
how the three kinds of sacrificial rite are to be conducted and the nature
of the sixteen sacrificial requisites. If fortune is with me and I can complete
a great sacrificial rite, I will gain great merit and my name will be renowned
far and wide, and will even be respected by the heavenly gods, sir.
At once, the World-honored One said to the brāhmaṇa Kūṭadanta, “Listen
carefully and keep in mind what I explain. I shall answer your question.”
The brāhmaṇa replied, “Yes, sir. This is what I have come to hear.”
Thereupon, the Buddha said to Kūṭadanta:
In the immemorial past, there was once a kṣatriya king, [properly] anointed
for his throne. As he wished to conduct a great sacrificial rite, he assembled
his brāhmaṇa ministers and said to them: “I have amassed great wealth
and treasure. However, while enjoying all the faculties of the five senses,
I have also been growing old. My soldiers are strong and valiant without
any cowardice, and my storehouses are filled with treasure. It is now a
good time for me to conduct a universal sacrificial rite. Please explain
how we may proceed. What will be required?”
The ministers replied, “It is true, O great king. As Your Majesty has
said, our country’s wealth has increased, along with the might of its army.
But, sire, much of that wealth is squandered and constantly being misap-
propriated by those who harbor ill intent. If a great sacrifice should now
be conducted, we cannot expect the intended result to occur. It would be
like sending a band of robbers to chase away another band of robbers; it
will not serve, sire. O great king, do not think that you can rely on your

subjects to apprehend the robbers in order to stop and punish them, or  
even have them executed. Instead, you must try to provide the faithful  
who serve Your Majesty’s interest with all the things they need: see to it  
that those who aspire to conduct trade and business are supplied with suf-  
ficient capital, give those who farm the fields and cultivate the land both  
seeds to plant and breeding cattle, and let all of them manage their affairs  
by themselves. O Your Majesty, if one refrains from oppressing the people  
with taxes and regulations, they will feel safe and secure and be able to  
raise their offspring and enjoy their lives.”

The Buddha continued:

Listening to his ministers’ advice, the king made sure to provide his closest  
subjects with regular supplies of food and clothing, furnished capital from  
the royal coffers to those who aspired to operate various businesses, and  
gave seeds and cattle to those who wished to cultivate the land. Thereafter,  
the citizens ceased to interfere with each other through criminal acts; they  
managed their own affairs, raised their children, and enjoyed their lives.

The Buddha went on:

The king once again called his ministers and said, “My country is pros-  
perous, my army is strong, and my storehouses are filled with treasure. I  
have provided the citizens with whatever they needed and enabled them  
to feel free from any kind of deprivation. They are raising their families  
and enjoying their own lives. Therefore, I now wish to conduct a great sac-  
rificial rite. Please explain how we should proceed. What will be required?”  
The ministers replied, “It is exactly as Your Majesty has said. The  
country is prosperous, the army is strong, and the treasury is full. Your  
majesty has provided the people with whatever they needed and freed them  
from any kind of deprivation. They are raising their families and enjoying  
their own lives. O great king, if Your Majesty wishes to conduct a great  
sacrificial rite, this may be announced in the queens’ palace quarters.”  
Following the ministers’ advice, the king announced his intent before  
his queens and their palace ladies, “My country is prosperous, my army  
is strong, and my storehouses are filled with treasure. I plan to conduct a  
great sacrificial rite.”

The queens responded, “Yes, sire. As Your Majesty has said, the country
is prosperous, the army is strong, and the storehouses are filled with money
and treasure. If Your Majesty wishes to conduct a great sacrificial rite,
this is now the right time.”
Returning from the queens’ palace, the king reported to his ministers,
“My country has been prosperous, my army continues to be strong, and my
storehouses are replete with treasure. I have provided the citizens with what-
ever they needed and enabled them to feel free from any kind of deprivation.
They are raising their families and enjoying their own lives. As I now wish
to conduct a great sacrificial rite, I have announced my intent to my queens
in their quarters. Please explain how we can proceed. What will be required?”
The ministers replied, “It is exactly as Your Majesty has said. Wishing
to conduct a great sacrificial rite, Your Majesty has announced the matter
in the queens’ palace quarters. Sire, it must still be announced before the
crown prince and princes, the ministerial officials, and your generals and
their officers. May it please Your Majesty to make the announcement
before them.”
Listening to the advice of his ministers, the king said to the crown
prince and princes, the ministerial officials, and the generals and their
officers, “My country is prosperous, my army is strong, and my storehouses
are filled with treasure. I plan to conduct a great sacrificial rite.”
The crown prince and princes, the officials, and the generals and officers
responded, “Yes, sire. It is exactly as Your Majesty has said. The country
is prosperous, the army is strong, and the storehouses are filled with treas-
ure. If Your Majesty wishes to conduct a great sacrificial rite, this should
now be the right time.”
Once again, the king said to the ministers, “My country is prosperous,
my army is strong, and my storehouses are filled with treasure. I wish to
conduct a great sacrificial rite. I have announced the matter to my queens
in their quarters, to the crown prince and princes, and so on, including to
my generals and their officers. It is now the right time to conduct a great
sacrificial rite. What will be required?”
The ministers replied, “It is exactly as Your Majesty has said. If Your
Majesty wishes to conduct a great sacrificial rite, this must now be the
right time.”

Having received the king’s decree, the ministers at once constructed a  
new pavilion in the eastern part of the capital. The king entered the new  
pavilion covered in deer hide, his body rubbed with scented butter oil; on  
his head he wore a cap with deer’s antlers, and he sat on the ground where  
cow dung had been plastered. The first queen and a _brāhmaṇa_ minister  
selected a yellow cow. A portion of its milk became the king’s food, a second  
portion the queen’s food, a third portion the minister’s food, and a fourth  
portion was offered to the multitude, with the remainder given to its calf.  
The king was then to fulfill eight norms, while the minister had to qual-  
ify with four norms. What were the eight norms the king was obliged to  
fulfill? A king of the _kṣatriya_ class had to be from a pure family line of  
seven generations, and could not be slighted by anyone in society. This  
fulfilled the first norm. The king had to have a handsome appearance as  
befits the _kṣatriya_ class. This fulfilled the second norm. The king had to  
be endowed with ever-increasing wisdom and virtue. This fulfilled the  
third norm. The king had to be trained in martial arts such as elephant  
riding and driving a horse-drawn chariot, and he had to be skilled in using  
the sword, spear, bow and arrow, and other methods of combat, in detail  
without exception. This fulfilled the fourth norm. The king had to possess  
a regal presence so as to command the allegiance of subject kings. This  
fulfilled the fifth norm. The king had to be skilled in speech, gentle and  
patient in his manner of persuasion, and use words endowed with true  
meanings and real essences. This fulfilled the sixth norm. The king had to  
possess great wealth and storehouses filled with treasure. This fulfilled the  
seventh norm. The king had to be valiant and decisive, endowed with strate-  
gic brilliance and wisdom, and without infirmities at all. This fulfilled the  
eighth norm. Indeed, the _kṣatriya_ king was well qualified in all eight norms.  
What were the four norms required of the _brāhmaṇa_ minister? The _brāh-  
maṇa_ minister had to be from a pure family line of seven generations and  
could not be slighted by anyone in society. That was the first norm. The  
minister had to be thoroughly versed in the three ancient collections of  
hymns (Vedas) and have detailed knowledge of the various _brāhmaṇa_ scrip-  
tures as well as a comprehensive command of the subtleties of secular lit-  
erature. He also had to be well trained in reading the physiognomy of mag-  
nanimous personalities, in divining good and bad omens, and in conducting

ceremonial proceedings and sacrificial rites. That was the second norm.
The minister had to be skilled in the use of language, gentle and patient
in his manner of persuasion, and use words endowed with true meanings
and real essences. That was the third norm. The minister had to be valiant
and decisive, endowed with strategic brilliance and wisdom, and without
infirmities at all. Insofar as the sacrificial rite was concerned, his knowledge
had to be comprehensive. That was the fourth norm.
Thus, the king proved to be well qualified in all eight norms, and the
minister in four norms. In addition, the king was required to be in command
of the four assistances, the threefold sacrificial rite, and the sixteen sac-
rificial requisites. The brāhmaṇa minister had to understand the king’s
frame of mind and eradicate the king’s doubt in respect of the sixteen req-
uisites. What are the sixteen requisites?
(1) Suppose the minister said to the king: “If someone says, ‘Now the
king of the kṣatriya class wishes to conduct a great sacrificial rite, but he
was not born into a pure family line of seven generations and is always
slighted by others’—even if there were such a rumor, that cannot disgrace
the king. Why? Sire, it is because the king truly was born into a pure
family line of seven generations and is never slighted by others.
(2) “Again, someone might say, ‘Now the king of the kṣatriya class
may wish to conduct a great sacrificial rite, but his countenance is unat-
tractive since he is not of the kṣatriya class.’ Even if there were such a
rumor, that cannot disgrace the king. Why? Sire, it is because the king’s
countenance is handsome as befits the kṣatriya class.
(3) “Again, someone might say, ‘Now the king of the kṣatriya class
may wish to conduct a great sacrificial rite, but he is not endowed with
ever-increasing virtue or wisdom.’ Even if there were such a rumor, that
cannot disgrace the king. Why? Sire, it is because the king’s virtues are
ever increasing, as is his wisdom.
(4) “Again, someone might say, ‘Now the king of the kṣatriya class
may wish to conduct a great sacrificial rite, but he is not well trained in
the martial arts, is incapable of riding an elephant or driving a horse-drawn
chariot, and cannot understand various military strategies.’ Even if there
were such a rumor, that cannot disgrace the king. Why? Sire, it is because

the king is skilled in various martial arts, and there is nothing he does not  
know about military and battleground strategy.  
(5) “Again, someone might say, ‘Now the king of the _kṣatriya_ class  
may wish to conduct a great sacrificial rite, but despite his great authority,  
he is unable to command the allegiance of lesser kings.’ Even if there were  
such a rumor, that cannot disgrace the king. Why? Sire, it is because the  
king commands great authority and the allegiance of those subject kings.  
(6) “Again, someone might say, ‘Now the king of the _kṣatriya_ class  
may wish to conduct a great sacrificial rite, but he is not skilled in language,  
is rough and impatient when trying to persuade, and uses words that are  
not endowed with true meanings and real essences.’ Even if there were  
such a rumor, that cannot disgrace the king. Why? Sire, it is because the  
king is skilled in language, gentle and patient in his manner of persuasion,  
and uses words endowed with true meanings and real essences.  
(7) “Again, someone might say, ‘Now the king of the _kṣatriya_ class  
may wish to conduct a great sacrificial rite, but he has little treasure.’ Even  
if there were such a rumor, that cannot disgrace the king. Why? Sire, it is  
because the king has a great deal of wealth and storehouses filled with  
treasure.  
(8) “Again, someone might say, ‘Now the king of the _kṣatriya_ class  
may wish to conduct a great sacrificial rite, but he has little strategic bril-  
liance or wisdom and is plagued by infirmities regarding the goal of his  
striving.’ Even if there were such a rumor, that cannot disgrace the king.  
Why? Sire, it is because the king is valiant and decisive, endowed with  
strategic brilliance and wisdom, and without any infirmities whatsoever.  
(9) [The following four are the four assistances:] “Again, someone  
might say, ‘Now the king of the _kṣatriya_ class may wish to conduct a great  
sacrificial rite, but he has not announced his intent in his queens’ quarters.’  
Even if there were such a rumor, that cannot disgrace the king. Why? Sire,  
it is because the king, wishing to conduct a great sacrificial rite, has already  
announced it in his queens’ quarters.  
(10) “Again, someone might say, ‘Now the king of the _kṣatriya_ class  
may wish to conduct a great sacrificial rite, but he has not announced his  
intent before the crown prince and princes.’ Even if there were such a

rumor, that cannot disgrace the king. Why? Sire, it is because the king,
wishing to conduct a great sacrificial rite, has already announced it before
the crown prince and princes.
(11) “Again, someone might say, ‘Now the king of the kṣatriya class
may wish to conduct a great sacrificial rite, but he has not announced his
intent before his officials.’ Even if there were such a rumor, that cannot
disgrace the king. Why? Sire, it is because the king, wishing to conduct
a great sacrificial rite, has already announced it before his officials.
(12) “Again, someone might say, ‘Now the king of the kṣatriya class
wishes to conduct a great sacrificial rite, but he has not announced his
intent before his generals and their officers.’ Even if there were such a
rumor, that cannot disgrace the king. Why? Sire, it is because the king,
wishing to conduct a great sacrificial rite, has already announced it before
his generals and their officers.
(13) “Again, someone might say, “Now the king of the kṣatriya class
may wish to conduct a great sacrificial rite, but his brāhmaṇa minister is
not from a pure family line of seven generations and is always slighted
by others.’ Even if there were such a rumor, that cannot disgrace the king.
Why? Sire, it is because I was born into a pure family line of seven gen-
erations that has never been slighted by others.
(14) “Again, someone might say, ‘Now the king of the kṣatriya class
may wish to conduct a great sacrificial rite, but his brāhmaṇa minister,
while thoroughly versed in the three ancient collections of hymns (Vedas),
does not understand them, nor can he distinguish the various brāhmaṇa
scriptures or say anything about the subtleties of secular literature. He is
not trained in reading the physiognomy of magnanimous personalities or
in divining good and bad omens, or in conducting ceremonial proceedings
and sacrificial rites.’ Even if there were such a rumor, that cannot disgrace
the king. Why? Sire, it is because I am thoroughly versed in the three
ancient collections of hymns (Vedas) and have detailed knowledge of the
various brāhmaṇa scriptures as well as a comprehensive command of the
subtleties of secular literature. I am also well trained in reading the phys-
iognomy of magnanimous personalities, in divining good and bad omens,
and in conducting ceremonial proceedings and sacrificial rites.

(15) “Again, someone might say, ‘Now the king of the _kṣatriya_ class  
may wish to conduct a great sacrificial rite, but his _brāhmaṇa_ minister is  
not skilled in the use of language, is rough and impatient in his manner  
of persuasion, and his words not endowed with any true meanings or real  
essences.’ Even if there were such a rumor, that cannot disgrace the king.  
Why? Sire, it is because I am skilled in the use of language, gentle and  
patient in persuasion, and my words are endowed with true meanings and  
real essences.  
(16) “Again, someone might say, “Now the king of the _kṣatriya_ class  
may wish to conduct a great sacrificial rite, but his _brāhmaṇa_ minister is  
not endowed with strategic brilliance or wisdom, he has no knowledge  
of the sacrificial rite, and is plagued by infirmity.’ Even if there were such  
a rumor, that cannot disgrace the king. Why? Sire, it is because I am valiant  
and decisive, endowed with strategic brilliance and wisdom, and without  
any infirmities at all. Insofar as the sacrificial rite is concerned, there is  
no aspect of it that I do not know.”

The Buddha said to Kūṭadanta:

As you see, when the king experienced doubt concerning the foregoing  
sixteen requisites, the _brāhmaṇa_ minister resolved his doubt by confirming  
that the king was fully qualified to fulfill all the conditions for the success  
of his sacrificial rite.

The Buddha continued:

Then the minister encouraged and delighted the king further by describing  
the ten norms of conduct. What are the ten norms of conduct? The minister  
said, “When the king conducts a sacrificial rite, his beneficence should  
be extended equally to all those who have come for the occasion, irre-  
spective of whether they live by way of killing (i.e., hunting, fishing, etc.)  
or of non-killing (i.e., farming, trading, etc.). If the former sort come, gen-  
erosity should be extended while educating them to reflect upon the wrong-  
ness of their lifestyle. If the latter sort come, benefactions should be given  
to encourage them in the rightness of their livelihood. In this manner, the  
king’s beneficence should consist not only of material gifts but also of

moral edification. If again some people should come to participate in the  
sacrificial rite while persisting in immoral conduct such as theft, sexual  
misbehavior, false speech or double-talk, or speaking harshly, or using  
flattery, and thus conveying a covetous mind, or malicious intent, or attach-  
ment to wrong views, material gifts should still be given to them while  
simultaneously encouraging reform in their way of life. On the other hand,  
if some people should participate in the assembly while upholding proper  
moral standards such as non-theft and so forth, so as to engender the right  
view, material gifts should be given to them to commend their good conduct  
and to support and encourage the awakening of their conscience.”  
The Buddha went on, “By instructing the king about the ten norms of  
beneficence, the _brāhmaṇa_ minister indeed encouraged, benefited, and  
delighted him.”  
Again, the Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa_ Kūṭadanta:  
The _kṣatriya_ king was troubled by three kinds of regret during his stay in  
the new pavilion [during the course of the sacrificial rite], and it was the  
minister’s task to resolve them. What were the three regrets that troubled  
the king? At various moments, as the king thought to himself, “I will [soon]  
conduct the rite,” “I am now conducting the sacrificial rite,” and “I have  
just completed the great sacrificial rite,” [his awareness of the enormous  
expenditure for the rite] caused each thought to be followed by a pang of  
regret: “I will lose... ,” “I am losing... ,” “I have just lost a great portion  
of my wealth and treasure because of this sacrificial rite.” Each time the  
king felt such a regret, the minister eradicated it from his mind by saying,  
“Sire, do not regret the meritorious rite through which Your Majesty will  
perform... , is now performing... , and has performed such a great benev-  
olence. O great king, Your Majesty has just completed the great sacrificial  
rite.” Thus did the minister assist the king to resolve his three regrets.  
The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa:_  
On the fifteenth night, under a full moon, the _kṣatriya_ king came out of  
the new pavilion properly anointed for his throne and built a great bonfire  
in the open area before the building. He held a pitcher of oil in his hand  
and poured it over the fire and loudly announced: “Now is the time of

beneficence, it is the time for beneficence!” Hearing this announcement,  
the queens and palace ladies, carrying various articles from the palace in  
their hands, appeared before the king and said, “Sire, may these riches and  
treasures be of assistance in Your Majesty’s benevolent sacrificial rite.”  
O _brāhmaṇa,_ the king replied to his queens and palace ladies, “Please  
go no further. Your assistance has already been provided in the mere offer.  
I possess enough wealth and treasure for this benevolent rite.” But the queens  
and palace ladies thought to themselves: “We must not take these treasures  
back to our quarters. When the king conducts another rite in the eastern  
region, his majesty will be able to use our assistance in his benevolence.”  
O _brāhmaṇa,_ when the king came to conduct another rite in the eastern  
region, his queens and palace ladies did indeed assist his rite with their  
treasures.  
[Again,] on the fifteenth night, under a full moon, the king came out  
of a new pavilion and built a great bonfire in the open area before the  
building. He poured oil over the fire from a pitcher in his hand and loudly  
proclaimed: “Now is the time of beneficence, it is the time for beneficence!”  
Hearing the king’s announcement, the crown prince and princes, carrying  
their riches and treasures, appeared before the king and said, “Sire, let  
these things provide assistance in Your Majesty’s benevolent rite.” The  
king replied, “Please go no further. Your assistance has already been pro-  
vided in the mere offer. I possess enough wealth and treasure for this  
benevolent rite.” But the crown prince and princes thought to themselves,  
“We must not take back these treasures. When the king conducts another  
rite in the southern region, his majesty will be able to use our assistance  
in his benevolence.”  
In a similar manner, the ministers [and officials] assisted the king when  
he later conducted a sacrificial rite in the western region, and so did the  
generals and their officers when the king conducted another rite in the  
northern region.

The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa:_

At the time of the great sacrificial rite the king did not slaughter cattle  
and sheep or any other living beings; he only used butter and milk, hemp  
oil, honey, black raw sugar, and molasses to perform the rite.

The Buddha continued:  
When the king conducted the great sacrificial rite there was delight at the  
beginning, there was delight in the middle, and there was delight at the  
end of the rite. This became the standard method of preparing and per-  
forming the sacrificial rite.  
The Buddha went on:  
The _kṣatriya_ king, having completed the sacrificial rite, shaved his head  
and beard, put on the three robes of a mendicant, abdicated his throne to  
pursue the path of religion, and engaged in the practice of the four immea-  
surables of the mind ( _catur-apramāṇas_ ); when he died, he was reborn in  
the highest realm of Brahmā Heaven. The _brāhmaṇa_ minister too, having  
assisted the king in performing sacrificial rites in the four regions, con-  
ducted a sacrificial rite on his own and then shaved his head and beard,  
put on the three robes of the mendicant, renounced domestic life to practice  
the four kinds of austerity, and when he died, he was reborn in the highest  
realm of Brahmā Heaven.  
The Buddha then said to the _brāhmaṇa:_  
The king performed the great sacrificial rite by following the practices of  
the threefold sacrificial rite and observing the sixteen requisites. Now,  
what do you think about these matters that I have explained?  
Kūṭadanta had listened to what the Buddha had explained, but he remained  
silent and did not reply immediately. His five hundred student disciples said  
to him, “The words of the _śramaṇa_ Gautama are indeed subtle. Sir, why does  
Your Reverence not reply to his words and only remain silent?”  
Kūṭadanta then said to the Buddha:  
What the _śramaṇa_ Gautama has explained is truly subtle. I agree with the  
other _brāhmaṇa_ s; I do not differ from them at all. I have only remained  
silent because I have been deep in thought. The _śramaṇa_ Gautama has  
explained everything, but not in the way of one that has learned from  
others through tradition. I have been wondering, “Could it be that the _śra-  
maṇa_ Gautama was himself that king of the _kṣatriya_ class? Or was he the  
_brāhmaṇa_ minister?”

Thereupon, the World-honored One said:  
Good, very good, you have rightly perceived the Tathāgata in the most  
appropriate terms. The _kṣatriya_ king who conducted the great sacrificial  
rite was no one other, and in no way different, than myself. At that time,  
a great deal of universal charity was produced [for all sentient beings].  
Kūṭadanta said to the Buddha, “Is there any deed that can produce merit  
superior to that of the threefold sacrificial rite and sixteen requisites?”  
The Buddha replied, “Yes, there is.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ asked, “What is it, sir?”  
The Buddha replied:  
While performing the threefold sacrificial rite with the sixteen requisites,  
if one can continue to serve the _bhikṣu_ s’ sangha with offerings without  
hiatus, the merit acquired would be superior to that of the sacrificial rite.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ again asked:  
Is there any deed that can produce merit superior to that of offerings and  
continual service to the sangha combined with that of the sacrificial rite  
and sixteen requisites?  
The Buddha replied, “Yes, there is.”  
Again, he asked, “What is it, sir?”  
The Buddha replied:  
Even if one served the sangha through the sacrificial rite and the sixteen  
requisites without hiatus, it would be far more meritorious for a person to  
build a monastery consisting of rooms, pavilions, and halls [with an open  
door to _bhikṣu_ s coming from any region] for the sake of the universal  
sangha. This contribution would be the best of all for acquiring merit.  
Again, Kūṭadanta asked:  
While performing the threefold sacrificial rite with the sixteen requisites,  
if one continues to serve the sangha with offerings without hiatus, and if  
one also builds a monastery consisting of rooms, pavilions, and halls for  
the sake of the universal sangha, one would thereby acquire the best and

highest merit, as I have understood. But is there another way to acquire
superior merit, sir?
The Buddha replied, “Yes, there is.”
Again, he asked, “What is it, sir?”
The Buddha replied:
Even while performing the threefold sacrificial rite with the sixteen req-
uisites, and continuing to serve the sangha with offerings without hiatus,
and building a monastery consisting of rooms, pavilions, and halls for the
sake of the universal sangha, it surely would be better if one could also
raise a thought of joy and delight and utter the words: “I take my refuge
in the Buddha, I take my refuge in the Dharma, and I take my refuge in
the Sangha.” The merit from that would be higher still.
Again, Kūṭadanta asked:
I understand that the threefold resolution combined with the sacrificial
rite, and so on, would bring about a higher merit, but is there anything
superior to that, sir?
The Buddha replied, “Yes, there is.”
[Kūṭadanta] then asked, “What is it, sir?”
The Buddha replied:
If one upholds the five precepts—namely, refraining from taking life,
refraining from taking what is not given, refraining from indulging in
sexual pleasure, refraining from speaking falsehoods, and refraining from
ingesting intoxicants— until the dissolution of the body and end of life,
the merit acquired is higher.
Again, Kūṭadanta asked:
I understand that by combining the threefold sacrificial rite, and so on,
up to adhering to the five precepts, one may acquire superior merit, but
is there another way to bring still higher superior merit, sir?
The Buddha replied, “Yes, there is.”
[Kūṭadanta] then asked, “What is it, sir?”

The Buddha replied:

Extending one’s compassion universally toward all sentient beings, as if  
one were pulling cow’s milk into a bucket and pouring it out to all the  
sentient beings [in the world]—the merit from that is still higher.

Again, Kūṭadanta asked:

I understand that by combining the threefold sacrificial rite and so on, up  
to extending universal compassion, one may acquire even higher superior  
merit, but is there another way to bring still higher superior merit, sir?

The Buddha replied, “Yes, there is.”  
[Kūṭadanta] then asked, “What is it, sir?”  
The Buddha replied:

When the Tathāgata, who is totally free from defilement and perfectly  
enlightened, appears in this world, those who renounce domestic life, enter  
into practice of the Buddhist religion, become endowed with all the meri-  
torious virtues without exception, and so on, up to being endowed with  
three kinds of supernormal power (knowledge of past lives, knowledge of  
future destinies, and total eradication of defilements), can terminate all igno-  
rance and delusion and acquire wisdom and illumination. Because they are  
in a state of seclusion and transcendence, their merit is indeed the highest.

Again, Kūṭadanta said to the Buddha:

O Gautama, now I have put together all the requisites of the sacrificial  
rite. I shall forsake all my cattle and sheep, five hundred of each, and let  
them each go in their own way to seek their grass and water. I shall take  
my refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. May Your Reverence per-  
mit me to become a lay devotee in the right Dharma. From this moment  
until the dissolution of the body and end of life, I shall uphold the five  
precepts, refraining from taking life, refraining from taking what is not  
given, refraining from indulging in sexual pleasure, refraining from speak-  
ing falsehoods, and refraining from ingesting intoxicants. May I request  
that Your Reverence and the members of the sangha accept my invitation  
for almsfood [tomorrow].

The World-honored One remained silent, granting his wish. Seeing the
World-honored One remaining silent, the brāhmaṇa stood up, venerated the
Buddha, circumambulating him three times, and went away. Returning home,
he prepared many varieties of delicious food, and in the early morning when
everything was ready, he sent word to the Buddha and the sangha. Thereupon,
the World-honored One put on his outer robe, took up his almsbowl, and
proceeded to the brāhmaṇa ’s residence accompanied by one thousand two
hundred and fifty bhikṣu s. There he took a seat where it had been prepared
and was served, along with the members of the sangha, with various foods
out of the brāhmaṇa ’s own hand. At the conclusion of the meal, after the
serving vessels had been taken away, cleansing water was served.
[Thereupon], the Buddha recited these verses for the brāhmaṇa:
In the sacrificial rite, fire is of the highest rank,
In chanting, reading is of the highest rank,
Among humans, the king is of the highest rank,
Among rivers, the ocean is of the highest rank,
Among stars, the moon is of the highest rank,
Among all that shines bright, the sun is of the highest rank,
In all four directions, and above and below,
Among all sentient beings, and humans and gods,
The Buddha alone is of the highest rank.
If one wishes to acquire the greatest merit,
One should make offerings for the Three Treasures.
Kūṭadanta then brought out a small cushion and took his seat before the
Buddha. The World-honored One gradually began his teaching, and with it,
he encouraged, benefited, and delighted the brāhmaṇa. He taught him the
doctrine pertaining to charity, the doctrine pertaining to morality, the doctrine
pertaining to rebirth in heaven, the doctrine that being bound to craving and
desire is the greatest danger, and that impure defilements are the obstruction,
and that the right method of practice to transcend obstacles is of primary
importance. He detailed the varieties of practice, those that are pure and gen-
uine, and explained them to satisfy the brāhmaṇa ’s understanding.
Then the World-honored One, observing the brāhmaṇa’s mind becoming
receptive, the five kinds of obstacles becoming lighter to the point of vanishing

in him, and his whole being turning ripe for conversion, followed the practice  
of the buddhas by introducing [the Four Noble Truths]: (1) the doctrine of  
the noble truth of suffering, explaining it in detail and opening it to his under-  
standing. He then set forth the remaining three truths, each in turn, giving  
appropriate commentary: (2) the noble truth of the cause of suffering, (3) the  
noble truth of the cessation of suffering, and (4) the noble truth of the path  
to the cessation of suffering. At that moment, the _brāhmaṇa_ Kūṭadanta erad-  
icated all defilements and acquired genuine insight into the nature of the  
Dharma, just as a white cloth can be dyed any color.  
Exactly like that, the _brāhmaṇa_ Kūṭadanta saw the Dharma, acquired the  
Dharma, and abided there. Without need for any other assurance, he realized  
the state of absolute confidence, and then said to the Buddha:

May I once again repeat my vow: I take my refuge in the Buddha, Dharma,  
and Sangha. May Your Reverence permit me to become a lay devotee in  
the right Dharma, and from this moment until the dissolution of the body  
at the end of life I shall uphold the five precepts, refraining from taking  
life, refraining from taking what is not given, refraining from indulging  
in sexual pleasure, refraining from speaking falsehoods, and refraining  
from ingesting intoxicants.  
Then he added, “May I also request Your Reverence and the members of  
the sangha to accept my invitation for almsfood for the duration of seven days.”  
The World-honored One remained silent, granting his wish.  
For seven days the _brāhmaṇa_ served the Buddha and the members of the  
sangha with provisions out of his own hand, until the World-honored One  
departed to visit other communities. Not long after the Buddha’s departure  
the _brāhmaṇa_ Kūṭadanta fell ill and passed away.  
The members of the sangha soon heard that the _brāhmaṇa_ Kūṭadanta,  
who had served them with provisions for seven days, had fallen ill and passed  
away. All of the _bhikṣu_ s wondered, “At the end of his life, where has that  
_brāhmaṇa_ gone for his rebirth?”  
Some of the _bhikṣu_ s went to the World-honored One. After bowing their  
heads to ground at his feet, they sat to one side and said, “The _brāhmaṇa_  
Kūṭadanta has passed away. Sir, where would such a person be reborn?”  
The Buddha replied:

That person, by practicing pure and genuine austerity, realized the truth  
of the Dharma and can never again be subject to doubt. He terminated  
the five kinds of defilement that bind sentient beings to the lower realm  
of desire^16 and will enter final nirvana ( _parinirvāṇa_ ) from the heaven  
where he is reborn, not returning to this world.  
Having heard the Buddha’s teaching, all the _bhikṣu_ s were delighted to  
receive it, and they reverentially carried out what the Buddha taught.
