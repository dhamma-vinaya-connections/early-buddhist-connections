### Sutra 7

### Pāyāsi’s Dialogue

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 23: Pāyāsi Suttanta )

At one time, Kumara-Kāśyapa was leisurely traveling through the country  
of Kośala together with five hundred _bhikṣu_ s and arrived at the village of  
Śvetavyā. Kumara-Kāśyapa then stayed in a forest of _śiṃśapā_ trees to the  
north of the village. There happened to be a _brāhmaṇa_ , Pāyāsi by name, who  
resided in this village. The village was prosperous with bountiful harvests,  
populous, and full of luxuriant trees. King Prasenajit had granted the _brāhmaṇa_  
Pāyāsi the village as a special fief and exempted it from tax collection. The  
_brāhmaṇa_ always held an unusual view of life and taught it to others: “There  
is no world after death, nor is there rebirth, nor even any reward for good or  
bad deeds done in this world.”  
The people of Śvetavyā village, having heard that Kumara-Kāśyapa had  
arrived at the _śiṃśapā_ forest together with five hundred _bhikṣu_ s from the  
country of Kośala, said to each other:

This _bhikṣu_ Kumara-Kāśyapa is renowned for his realization of the  
state of arhatship. Being a _bhikṣu_ of advanced, senior rank, learned  
and erudite in stature, he can respond to anyone with his sagacity, intel-  
ligence, and eloquence, and he is especially good at doctrinal debate.  
It would be great if we could see him.  
The people of the village then visited the _bhikṣu_ every day in due order.  
At that time Pāyāsi was watching the villagers from the top of a high tower  
as they proceeded one after another in groups, but he was unable to see where  
they were going. He asked his attendants, who were holding parasols over  
him on each side, “Where and why are these people forming groups and  
going one after another?” The attendants replied:

I shall question you now, and please reply accordingly, as you wish.  
Now, do the sun and moon above us belong to this human world or  
another world? Are they heavenly things or human things?  
Pāyāsi answered, “The sun and moon belong to the other world and not  
to this world. Heavenly things are not human things.”  
Kāśyapa said, “According to your reply, there is necessarily another world;  
there is also rebirth, as well as the moral retribution of good and bad.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ said:  
Although you assert that there is another world, rebirth, and reward  
and retribution of good and bad, my reply to your previous question,  
that the sun and moon belong to the other world, leads to my theory  
that these three (i.e., afterlife, rebirth, and reward or retribution for  
good or bad) are impossible.  
Kāśyapa asked, “Do you have some causal reasons by which to know that  
there is neither afterlife, nor rebirth, nor reward or retribution for good or  
bad actions?”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “I have some reason for ascertaining my theory.”  
Kāśyapa asked, “On what causal reason do you assert that there is no  
afterlife?”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied:  
O Kāśyapa, I have some relations and friends who are suffering because  
they have encountered some calamities and also because they have  
been ill. I visited and asked them, “Some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s  
respectively teach their different doctrines, such as ‘Whoever is guilty  
of committing murder, enegaging in theft, immoral sex, double-dealing,  
harsh words, false speech, frivolous sycophancy, or who have a covetous  
mind, malicious intent, or wrong views will fall into hell when his  
body dissolves and his life ends.’ I cannot believe this kind of thing  
from the outset, because I have never known anyone who, after death,  
returned to tell us where his [new] life is. If someone were to return  
after death and tell me where he has been, then I will certainly believe  
it. Now, you have done all ten kinds of wrongdoings, just as I have  
done. If the teaching of the _śramaṇa_ is correct, when you die you will

goodbye, and then return here,” what do you think—would those guards  
have let him go?”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “No, sir.”  
Kāśyapa continued:  
If you compare both cases, it would be sufficient for you to know that  
it is reasonable [that there is such an afterworld]. Why do you insist  
on a delusion that leads to a wrong view [that there is no afterlife]?  
The _brāhmaṇa_ countered, “Although you assert that there is an afterlife  
by referring to such an analogy, I would still say that there is no such world  
after death.”  
Kāśyapa asked again, “Do you have any other reason on the basis of which  
you know that there is no afterlife?”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “I have another reason to infer that there is no  
afterlife.”  
Kāśyapa asked, “What is the reason?”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied:  
O Kāśyapa, one of my relations was seriously ill. I visited him and  
said to him, “Some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s respectively teach their  
different doctrines, saying that there is an afterlife, such that whoever  
has abstained from committing murder, engaging in theft, immoral  
sex, double-dealing, harsh words, false speech, frivolous sycophancy,  
and who does not have a covetous mind, malicious intent, and wrong  
views will be born among heavenly beings after his body dissolves  
and his life ends. I cannot believe this kind of thing from the outset,  
because I have never known anyone who, after death, returned to tell  
us where his [new] life is. If someone was to return after death and tell  
me where he has been, I will certainly believe it. Now, you are my  
close relation and have maintained all ten kinds of good deeds. If the  
teaching of the _śramaṇa_ is correct, after death you will surely be reborn  
in the heavenly world. I will believe decisively whatever you say, and  
if it is apparent that you have received the reward of heavenly birth,  
return to tell me and let me know about it. Then I shall believe it.”

afterlife on the basis of the foregoing analogy, I still insist that there is no  
such world after death.”  
Kāśyapa again asked, “Do you have any other reason on the basis of which  
you also know that there is no afterlife?”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “I have another reason to infer that there is no  
afterlife.”  
Kāśyapa asked, “What is that reason?”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied:  
O Kāśyapa, someone among my relations was been seriously ill and  
was about to die. I visited him and said to him, “Some _śramaṇa_ s and  
_brāhmaṇa_ s respectively teach their different doctrines, asserting that  
there is an afterlife such that whoever has abstained from committing  
murder, enaging in theft, sexual indulgence, false speech, or ingesting  
intoxicants will be born in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven.” I cannot believe this  
kind of thing from the outset, because I have never seen anyone who,  
after death, returned to tell us in which course of life he has been. If  
someone were to return after death and tell me where he has been, I  
will certainly believe it. Now, you are my close relation and you have  
upheld well the five precepts, so [according to the teaching of the _śra-  
maṇa_ ] you will be born in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven after death. I will  
believe decisively whatever you say, and if it is apparent that you have  
received the reward of heavenly birth, return to tell me and let me know  
about it. Then I will believe it.”  
O Kāśyapa, after his death he has not returned, even now. He was  
my close relation and certainly would not lie to me. The fact that he  
has not returned to let me know [about the afterlife] means that there  
is no such afterlife.  
Kāśyapa replied:  
One hundred years on earth is only a single day and night in Trāyas-  
triṃśa Heaven. In this manner, thirty days make up a month, twelve  
months make a year, and the life span of the residents of Trāyastriṃśa  
Heaven is said to be one thousand years. O _brāhmaṇa_ , your close rela-  
tion who upheld the five precepts was necessarily reborn in that heaven

The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “Though you assert that there is an afterlife, I still  
cannot believe it.”  
Kāśyapa again asked the _brāhmaṇa,_ “On the basis of what other reason  
do you know that there is no afterlife?”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied:  
O Kāśyapa, among the people of the village that I received as my fief  
there are some who have committed robbery. The villagers caught one  
thief redhanded and, with clear evidence, they brought him before me,  
demanding, “This man committed robbery. Please punish him.” I  
replied, “Tie him up, put him into a large cauldron, set its lid tightly  
and seal it thickly with mud, so that nothing leaks out.” I ordered men  
to surround the cauldron and build a fire underneath it. At that time I  
wished to test if the person’s spirit could escape from the cauldron and  
I walked around it, followed by my retainers, but I did not see any evi-  
dence of the person’s spirit coming out from that cauldron. Nor did I  
see any spirit coming or going when I examined the interior by opening  
the lid. For this reason, I came to know that there is no afterlife.  
Kāśyapa continued:  
Now I shall question you. Answer me if you can, in any way you wish.  
O _brāhmaṇa_ , when you rest and fall asleep on the high floor of your  
residence, have you ever dreamed of mountain forests and rivers, park  
groves and bathing ponds, country villages and city streets?  
He answered, “Yes, I have.”  
Kāśyapa again asked him, “O _brāhmaṇa_ , when you dream, do your family  
and members of your household guard you closely for your safety?”  
[Pāyāsi] answered, “Yes, they do.”  
[Kāśyapa] again questioned him: “O _brāhmaṇa_ , do your household mem-  
bers see your spirit of consciousness going and coming?”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ answered, “No, they don’t.”  
Kāśyapa said:  
You cannot see the spirit of living consciousness going and coming.  
How much less could you see the spirit of a dead man. You should not  
try to observe the destined afterlife in reference to actual phenomena

Kāśyapa again said:

At that time the _brāhmaṇa_ returned from town and entered the forest.  
He said to the boy, “I instructed you before to guard the fire. I hope  
that the fire has not gone out.” The boy replied, “While I was playing  
I failed to guard it at times; the fire is extinct, sir.” The _brāhmaṇa_ asked  
him, “In what way have you tried to make fire?” The boy replied,  
“Since fire comes from wood, I split wood with a hatchet, but I could  
not obtain it. I also chopped up wood and pounded it in the mortar, but  
I could not obtain fire there either, sir.” Thereupon, the _brāhmaṇa_  
picked up the drill to bore wood and made fire by friction, piling sticks  
on it for kindling. He then told the boy, “When you wish to make a  
fire you should do so in this manner. You cannot get fire by splitting  
wood or pounding it.”  
O _brāhmaṇa_ , you too are like that boy, lacking a proper way. By  
skinning a dead corpse, and so forth, you seek the spirit of conscious-  
ness. Concerning sentient beings, you cannot know it just by looking  
at the actual phenomena before your human eyes. O _brāhmaṇa_ , the  
_bhikṣu_ s reduce the time of sleep during the hours before and after mid-  
night, and exert themselves without slackening to be mindful of the  
auxiliary disciplines of the path and exercise supernormal vision through  
the power of concentration. It is through this supernormal vision that  
they see the destinies of sentient beings in terms of their having died  
here and having been born there, dying there and being born here, hav-  
ing lived a long or short life, having had good or bad complexion,  
beautiful or ugly features, having acquired rewards or retribution from  
good or bad deeds, and having entered good or bad courses of life. You  
should not try to see through ordinary human eyes that are defiled. You  
deny it because your human vision cannot penetrate the courses of life  
in which sentient beings are respectively destined. O _brāhmaṇa_ , because  
of this, you should know that there is necessarily an afterlife.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “Though you assert that there is an afterlife by quoting  
an analogy, according to my view, an afterlife is still impossible.”  
Kāśyapa again asked the _brāhmaṇa,_ “Do you have any other reason on  
the basis of which you also know that there is no afterlife?”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “Yes, I do.”  
Kāśyapa asked, “What is that reason?”

The _brāhmaṇa_ replied:  
O Kāśyapa, among the people of the village that I received as my fief  
there are some who committed robbery. The villagers caught one thief  
redhanded, and with clear evidence they and brought him before me,  
demanding, “This man committed robbery. Please punish him.” I  
instructed my aides to measure the man’s weight on a scale. When they  
completed the measurement of the criminal’s weight, I further instructed  
them, “Take him away and execute him through the easiest means, but  
do not damage the skin or flesh.” He was executed without any damage  
to his body. I instructed my aides to measure the weight of the corpse,  
which resulted in an indication that the corpse was heavier than the  
living body.  
O Kāśyapa, when the criminal was measured while still alive and  
the spirit of consciousness was still in his body, his physical complexion  
was pleasant and good, he was able to talk, and his body was also  
lighter. After death, however, with the spirit of his consciousness gone,  
with no particular complexion, and speechless, the corpse turned out  
to be heavier than the living body. Because of this, I know that there  
is no afterlife.  
Kāśyapa said to the _brāhmaṇa_ :  
Now I shall question you. Answer me if you can, in any way you wish.  
O _brāhmaṇa_ , your experience is comparable to the case in which men  
measure the weight of iron ore. First, they measure it while it is cool,  
and then they measure it after it has been heated. Why is iron lighter  
when it is heated, becoming bright and pliable? Why is it heavier when  
it is cold and has become dark, hard, and rigid?  
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “Heated iron is bright in color, pliable, and lighter,  
whereas cooled iron has no bright color, is rigidly hard, and is heavier.”  
Kāśyapa said:  
Human beings are also like this. When a person is alive he has color  
in his complexion and his body is flexible, but after death the body  
loses color and becomes stiff and heavier. Because of this, you should  
know that there is necessarily an afterlife.

The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “Though you assert that there is an afterlife by quoting  
an analogy, according to my view, an afterlife is still impossible.”  
Kāśyapa again asked the _brāhmaṇa,_ “Do you have any other reason on  
the basis of which you also know that there is no afterlife?”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied:  
I had a relation who became ill, [and when his illness] became critical  
I visited him and spoke with him. When I helped him lie down on his  
right side, the movement of his eyes, his limbs stretching and bending,  
and even his speech was just the same as when he was well. Again, when  
I helped him turn onto his left side , the turning and twisting of his body,  
the stretching and bending of his limbs, his eyes’ movement, and even  
his speech were all ordinary. Then he died. Again I had some men turn  
his body over to lay it with the right side down and then back the other  
way, with the left side down. I observed [the body] carefully but it did  
not stretch or bend, there was no eye movement, and there was no speech.  
Because of this, I know that there is necessarily no afterlife.  
Kāśyapa said again to the _brāhmaṇa_ :  
Many wise people acquire their wisdom by way of analogy. I shall  
now give another analogy to help you understand. Once there was a  
country where the sound of the conch shell was never heard. At that  
time a skillful conch horn player reached that country and, entering a  
[border] village, he blew the conch horn three times and then set the  
conch shell on the ground. Having heard the sound, the villagers, men  
and women, were all surprised and asked among themselves, “What  
was that sound? It was both soft and pleasant and yet thoroughly clear!”  
The man pointed at the conch shell on the ground and said, “It was the  
sound of this thing.” Then the village people touched the shell with  
their hands, saying, ‘O you, make a sound, make a sound!” The shell  
did not make any sound at all. The owner of the conch shell picked it  
up and blew it three times, then set it back down on the ground. The  
villagers said, “The beautiful sound we heard was not because of this  
shell’s power. It is due to the hands that support it, the mouth that blows  
air into it, and the air blown through it that it thereby makes a sound.”

A human being is also like this. If he has a span of life still to live  
and posesses consciousness, and is breathing in and breathing out, he  
should be able to stretch or bend his body, look at things by moving  
his eyes, and speak. On the other hand, when his life span is exhausted  
and his consciousness is gone, neither breathing in nor breathing out,  
he can neither stretch nor bend his body, nor move his eyes, nor speak.  
Kāśyapa thus said to the _brāhmaṇa,_ “You should abandon your wrong  
view. You should not prolong your suffering and bring yourself distress.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “I cannot abandon my theory, because from the  
time of my birth I have continued to intone and repeat it for a long time. Why  
should I now abandon it?”  
Kāśyapa said:  
Many wise people acquire their wisdom by way of analogy. I will now  
give another analogy to help you understand. Once in the immemorial  
past there was a country in a frontier region that had been mostly  
deserted by people. There were two friends in that country; one was  
called “Wise” and the other was called “Fool.” They said to each other,  
“I am your friend; I will go out of the city with you and we shall seek  
our fortune together.” Thus they traveled together. They came to an  
open space [in a village] and saw a heap of hemp that had been thrown  
away. Wise talked to Fool and they decided that they would both take  
the hemp. Carrying packs of hemp on their backs, they passed the next  
village and saw another pile of discarded hemp thread. Wise said, “This  
hemp thread is well made, lightweight and of fine texture. We should  
pick it up.” The other fellow, however, said, “I am already carrying a  
load of hemp, bound tightly and fixed into a pack; I cannot throw it  
away.” The wise one at once threw away his load of hemp and picked  
up the hemp thread as his new load.  
Again both proceeded on their way and they next found a pile of  
hemp cloth. The wise one said, “This hemp cloth is well made, light-  
weight and of fine texture. We should pick it up.” The other fellow,  
however, said, “I am already carrying a load of hemp bound tightly  
and fixed into a pack; I cannot throw it away.” Thus, the wise one threw  
down his load of hemp thread and picked up a new load of hemp cloth.

Again Kāśyapa said:

The _brāhmaṇa_ replied:

Kāśyapa again said:

Kāśyapa said to the _brāhmaṇa_ :

At that time the _brāhmaṇa_ said to Kāśyapa:

Venerable, when you gave the analogy of the moon, I already under-  
stood it. That I tried to refute your exhortation back and forth has been  
to examine your rhetorical skill and insight, thereby causing the arising  
of firm belief in myself. Now I believe what you have said, O Kāśyapa,  
and I wish for you to be my refuge.  
Kāśyapa said, “Do not make me your refuge. You should take the Highest  
and Most Venerable One, who is also my own refuge, as your refuge.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “I do not know where the Highest and Most Venerable  
One to whom you refer is at this time.”  
Kāśyapa replied, “My master, the World-honored One, entered final nirvana  
not long ago.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ said:  
If the World-honored One was still alive I would not hesitate, whether  
close or distant, to visit him directly and venerate him as my refuge.  
Unfortunately, as I have now heard, the Tathāgata has entered cessation.  
I will now uphold the Buddha who entered nirvana, the Dharma, and  
the Sangha as my refuge. O Kāśyapa, please permit me to become a  
lay devotee of the right Dharma. From now until the end of my life I  
will uphold the five precepts: abstention from killing life, from stealing,  
from sexual misconduct, from speaking falsehoods, and from ingesting  
intoxicants. I will now also offer general charity to all beings.  
Kāśyapa said to him:  
If you kill sentient beings, beat young boys, and then offer charity, this  
is not pure and genuine charity. Just as thorny plants prevail in a poor  
land with rocks and shallow soil, there will be no good harvest even  
if you were to sow seeds or plant trees there. If you kill animals, beat  
young boys, and offer charity to the sangha while holding a wrong  
view, neither is this a pure and genuine charity. If, however, you offer  
general charity, neither killing living beings nor beating children with  
sticks, but make offerings to the sangha with delight, then there will  
be a great reward, just as one obtains real fruit by sowing seeds or  
planting trees in good soil, as they wish.

The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “O Kāśyapa, from now on, I will continue to make  
offerings to the sangha at all times without fail.”  
At that time there was a young _brāhmaṇa_ , Mānava by name, standing  
behind Pāyāsi. Pāyāsi, looking back at him, said, “I wish to offer universal  
charity. Please organize an event to offer charity on my behalf.” Having heard  
Pāyāsi’s instruction, the young _brāhmaṇa_ organized and completed the event  
of universal charity, and then announced, “May Pāyāsi not be rewarded with  
any fortune in this life as well as in the hereafter.”  
Pāyāsi was informed that when the event of offering charity had been  
completed the young _brāhmaṇa_ had said, “May Pāyāsi not be rewarded with  
any fortune in this life as well as in the hereafter.” Pāyāsi questioned the  
man, “Did you really say such words?” He replied:

Yes, sir. I did indeed make such a wish, sir, because the food prepared  
for the charity event was of poor quality, and this bad-tasting food was  
what was offered to the sangha. If the same food were presented before  
your lordship you would not even touch it, much less partake of it.  
What was provided is not the kind of food with which one could be  
pleased or enjoy eating. How could anyone who offers such poor food  
acquire a good reward in the afterlife, sir? Moreover, your lordship  
offered robes to the sangha but the clothes were made of hemp. If such  
clothing were shown to your lordship you would have kicked them  
away without even touching them, much less wearing them. What has  
been offered is not the kind of clothing with which one may be pleased  
or enjoy wearing. How could anyone who offers such poor clothing  
acquire a good reward in the afterlife, sir?  
Pāyāsi then said to the young _brāhmaṇa_ , “From now on, please prepare  
and offer to the sangha the same kinds of food I eat and clothing of similar  
quality to what I wear.”  
Thus instructed, the young _brāhmaṇa_ then made offerings to the sangha  
of exactly the same quality of food and clothing as those enjoyed by Pāyāsi.  
Thus, the _brāhmaṇa,_ on the basis of his genuine offering, was born in Vimāna  
Heaven after his body dissolved and his life ended. The _brāhmaṇa_ youth  
who had organized the event of universal charity was born in Trāyastriṃśa  
Heaven upon the dissolution of his body and the end of his life.

At that time, having listened to this teaching, the _brāhmaṇa_ Pāyāsi, the  
young _brāhmaṇa_ , as well as the householders of Śvetavyā village, all rejoiced  
and respectfully received it and carried it out.
