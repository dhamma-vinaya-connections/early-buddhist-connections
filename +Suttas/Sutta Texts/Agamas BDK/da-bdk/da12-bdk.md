### Doctrines in Groups

### of Three

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha sojourned at the monastery built  
by Anāthapiṇḍika in the Jetavana Forest accompanied by one thousand two  
hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s. At that time, the World-honored One said to the  
_bhikṣu_ s:

I shall exhort on the subject of the subtle [supreme] Dharma. Whatever  
I explain to you is endowed with meaning and pure and genuine essence,  
and it is well balanced in respect to the practice of austerity. This is called  
the “teaching comprised of three groups of doctrine.” You should listen  
attentively and contemplate and remember what I explain to you. The  
following is the teaching.  
The _bhikṣu_ s were then attentive and ready to listen. The Buddha said to  
the _bhikṣu_ s:

The threefold doctrinal collection is comprised of three groups of doctrinal
items. The first group of doctrinal items define the path that leads to an
evil life course, the second group of doctrinal items define the path that
leads to a good life course, and the third group of doctrinal items define
the path that leads to nirvana. What is a singular item that leads to an
evil life course? It is merciless malice toward others, which directs a
person toward an evil life course. What is a singular item that leads to
a good life course? It is merciful compassion toward other sentient beings,
which directs a person toward a good life course. What is a singular item
that directs a person to the goal of nirvana? It is the practice of mental
awareness of one’s inner and outer physical senses with strenuous effort.
This directs a person toward nirvana.
Again, there is a double doctrinal item that leads to an evil life course,
a second double doctrinal item that leads to a good life course, and a

third double doctrinal item that leads to nirvana. What are the two doc-
trinal items that lead to an evil life course? One is the transgression of
precepts and associating with the wicked, and another is breaking away
from right views. What are the two doctrinal items that lead to a good
life course? One is adherence to the precepts and the other is adherence
to right views. What are the two doctrinal items that lead to nirvana?
One is the practice of calming the mind and the other is the practice of
analytical introspection.
Again, a triple doctrine leads to an evil life course, a second triple
doctrine leads to a good life course, and a third triple doctrine leads to
nirvana. What are the three doctrinal items that lead to an evil life course?
They are the three kinds of morally unfavorable roots: greed, hatred,
and delusion. What are the three doctrinal items that lead to a good life
course? They are the three kinds of morally good roots: the absence of
greed, hatred, and delusion. What are the three doctrinal items that lead
to nirvana? They are the practice of the threefold concentration: con-
centration on the emptiness of the self and things attributed to it; con-
centration on signlessness or the nondifferentiation of things; and con-
centration on a non-purposeful or goal-free state of existence.
Again, a fourfold doctrine leads to an evil life course, a second fourfold
doctrine leads to a good life course, and a third fourfold doctrine leads
to nirvana. What are the four doctrinal items that lead to an evil life
course? They are first, uttering words of amorous passion; second, uttering
hateful words; third, uttering frightening words; and fourth, uttering
delusory words. What are the four doctrinal items that lead to a good
life course? They are: first, words uttered in the absence of amorous pas-
sion; second, words uttered in the absence of hatred; third, words uttered
in the absence of fearfulness, and fourth, words uttered in the absence
of delusion. What are the fourfold doctrinal items that lead to nirvana?
They are the four applications of mental awareness in the following:
first, the inner and outer physical senses; second, sensation or feeling;
third, the mind or intellect; and fourth, the psychophysical elements
(aggregates).
Again, a fivefold doctrine leads to an evil life course, a second fivefold
doctrine leads to a good life course, and a third fivefold doctrine leads

to nirvana. What are the five doctrinal items that lead to an evil life  
course? They consist of violation of the five precepts, i.e., taking life,  
taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, speaking falsehoods, and  
states of indolence arising from [the use of] intoxicants. What are the  
five doctrinal items that lead to a good life course? They consist of strict  
adherence to the five precepts: abstinence from taking life, from taking  
what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from speaking falsehoods,  
and from states of indolence arising from [the use of] intoxicants. What  
are the five doctrinal items that lead to nirvana? They are the five kinds  
of spiritual faculties: faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration, and insight.  
Again, a sixfold doctrine leads to an evil life course, a second sixfold  
doctrine leads to a good life course, and a third sixfold doctrine leads  
to nirvana. What are the six doctrinal items that lead to an evil life course?  
They are six kinds of disrespect: toward the Buddha, Dharma, and  
Sangha; toward the precepts; toward concentration; and toward one’s  
parents. What are those six doctrinal items that lead to a good life course?  
They are six kinds of respect: toward the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha;  
toward the precepts; toward concentration; and toward one’s parents.  
What are those six doctrinal items that lead to nirvana? They are the six  
objects of mindfulness or recollection: being mindful of the Buddha,  
Dharma, and Sangha; being mindful of the precepts; being mindful of  
charity; and being mindful of divinity.  
Again, a sevenfold doctrine leads to an evil life course, a second sev-  
enfold doctrine leads to a good life course, and a third sevenfold doctrine  
leads to nirvana. What are the seven doctrinal items that lead to an evil  
life course? They are seven evil actions: taking life; taking what is not  
given; sexual misconduct; false speech; duplicitous speech; harsh speech;  
and frivolous sycophancy. What are those seven doctrinal items that lead  
to a good life course? They are seven good actions: abstinence from  
taking life, abstinence from taking what is not given, abstinence from  
sexual misconduct, abstinence from false speech, abstinence from duplic-  
itous speech, abstinence from harsh speech; and abstinence from frivolous  
sycophancy. What are the seven doctrinal items that lead to nirvana?  
They are seven auxiliary disciplines of enlightenment. First, a _bhikṣu_  
practices the discipline of mindfulness on the basis of nondesire and

quiescence, distancing [himself from worldly matters]. In like manner,
second, he practices the discipline of discernment of the psychophysical
elements; third, he practices the discipline of effort; fourth, he practices
the discipline of delight; fifth, he practices the discipline of freedom
from bodily and mental disturbance; sixth, he practices the discipline
of the practice of concentration; and seventh, he practices the discipline
of the mind of equanimity on the basis of nondesire and quiescence, dis-
tancing [himself from worldly matters].
Again, an eightfold doctrine leads to an evil life course, a second
eightfold doctrine leads to a good life course, and a third eightfold
doctrine leads to nirvana. What are the eight doctrinal items that lead to
an evil life course? They are eight kinds of wrong conduct (i.e., counter
to the eightfold noble path): wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech,
wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and
wrong concentration. What are the eight doctrinal items that lead to a
good life course? They are the eight criteria of the secular world: gain
and loss; infamy and fame; praise and blame; and suffering and happiness.
What are those eight doctrinal items that lead to nirvana? They are the
eightfold noble path: right view, right thought, right speech, right action,
right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.
Again, a ninefold doctrine leads to an evil life course, a second nine-
fold doctrine leads to a good life course, and a third ninefold doctrine
leads to nirvana. What are the nine doctrinal items that lead to an evil
life course? They are the nine kinds of hatred. First a person hates some-
one, thinking “He abused me in the past.” Second, he hates someone,
thinking “He is abusing me now.” Third, he hates someone, thinking
“He will surely abuse me in the future.” Fourth, a person hates someone,
thinking “He abused someone I love.” Fifth, he hates someone, thinking
“He is abusing someone I love now.” Seventh, he hates someone, thinking
“He will surely abuse someone I love in the future.” Seventh, a person
hates someone, thinking “He associated with someone I hate.” Eighth,
he hates someone, thinking “He is now associating with someone I hate.”
Ninth, a person hates someone, thinking “He will associate with someone
I hate [in the future].”

What are the nine doctrinal items that lead to a good life course?  
They are the nine kinds of subduing hatred. First, a person subdues his  
hatred for someone, thinking “This person abused me in the past, but  
what benefit is there in my holding a grudge against him? I have already  
subdued my hatred.” Second, he thinks “I am now subduing my hatred.”  
Third, he thinks “I will subdue my hatred in the future.” Fourth, a person  
subdues his hatred for someone, thinking “This person abused someone  
I love, but what benefit is there in my holding a grudge against him? I  
have already subdued my hatred.” Fifth, he thinks “I am now subduing  
my hatred.” Sixth, he thinks “I will surely subdue my hatred in the  
future.” Seventh, a person subdues his hatred for someone, thinking  
“Though this person befriended someone I hate, what benefit is there in  
my holding a grudge against him? I have already subdued my hatred.”  
Eighth, he thinks “I am now subduing my hatred.” Ninth, he thinks “I  
will subdue my hatred in the future.”  
What are the nine doctrinal items that lead to nirvana? They are the  
nine roots of proper mental attention: delight, devotion, joy, happiness,  
concentration, absolute knowledge, the eradication [of defilement] and  
the maintenance of equanimity, absence of desire, and liberation.  
Again, a tenfold doctrine leads to an evil life course, a second tenfold  
doctrine leads to a good life course, and a third tenfold doctrine leads  
to nirvana. What are the ten doctrinal items that lead to an evil life course?  
They are the ten kinds of wrongful deeds: taking life, taking what is not  
given, sexual misconduct, speaking falsehoods, duplicitous speech, harsh  
speech, flattery, covetousnes, malicious intent, and wrong views. What  
are the ten doctrinal items that lead to a good life course? They are the  
ten kinds of good deeds: not taking life, not taking what is not given,  
not engaging in sexual misconduct, not speaking falsehoods, not enaging  
in duplicitous speech, not engaging in harsh speech, not engaging in  
flattery, not being covetous, not having malicious intent, and not holding  
wrong views. What are the ten doctrinal items that lead to nirvana? They  
are the ten direct paths: right view, right thought, right speech, right  
action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration,  
right liberation, and right wisdom.

O _bhikṣu_ s, you should be able to reach nirvana through the practice  
of these ten doctrinal disciplines. These are called the sublime right doc-  
trines in groups of three. From the time I realized the status of a tathāgata  
I have continued to accomplish and complete that which should be done  
for the benefit of my disciples. Concerned with your destinies, I have  
continued to teach you the [doctrinal] scriptures and the [practical] path.  
You should be concerned about your destinies. You should always stay  
in a secluded place, such as under a tree, and never slacken in the practice  
of contemplation. If you do not work hard toward your religious goals  
now, what use is there in having regrets later on?  
Having listened to the Buddha’s exhortation, the _bhikṣu_ s were delighted  
and carried out what was taught by the Buddha.
