### Purity

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 29: Pāsādika Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was staying in a grove that  
belonged to a layman in the country of Kapilavastu, accompanied by one  
thousand two hundred and fifty disciples. At that time, a _śrāmaṇera_ (novice),  
Cunda by name, who had completed that year’s summer retreat in the country  
of Pāvā, carrying his robes and almsbowl, had just arrived at the grove. Upon  
reaching the place where Ānanda stayed, Cunda honored Ānanda by bowing  
his forehead to his feet, then stood to one side and said to him:

Master Jñātiputra of the Nirgrantha followers has just passed away in
the city of Pāvā. Within a short time, the Nirgrantha disciples have already
divided into two groups. Each of these two factions looks for its own
advantage and the fault of the other, mutually disdaining and accusing
each other as to whose doctrinal insights are right. They argue with each
other, asserting, “We know this well, whereas you do not. The discipline
we practice is real and true, whereas you follow the practice of a wrong
view. In your argument you first state what [logically] should be placed
later [as a conclusion] and assert what should be placed first [as precedent]
afterward. Thus, you uphold no logical rule in upside-down confusion.
What we practice is the ultimate, while what you assert is wrong. You
should question us if you have any doubt about it at all.”
O Venerable Elder Ānanda, listening to the arguments of those lay
followers, supporters of the Nirgrantha movement, of that country, I
have already become weary of the disputes, sir.
Ānanda said to the śrāmaṇera Cunda:
We have something important of which I wish to inform the World-honored
One. I shall now accompany you and report this matter to His Holiness.

If the World-honored One instructs us about anything related to this mat-
ter, we will respectfully receive it as a lesson for our practice.
Having heard Ānanda’s words, the śrāmaṇera Cunda immediately went
to visit the World-honored One and, after honoring the Buddha by bowing
his forehaed to the Buddha’s feet, he stood to one side. Thereupon, Ānanda
said to the World-honored One:
This śrāmaṇera Cunda, having completed the summer retreat in the
country of Pāvā, carrying his robes and almsbowl, has just arrived here,
sir. Upon reaching my place and honoring me by bowing his forehead
to my feet, he said to me, “The teacher of the Nirgrantha followers has
just passed away in the city of Pāvā. Within a short time, the Nirgrantha
followers have already divided into two groups. Each of these two fac-
tions looks for its own advantage and the faults of the other, mutually
disdaining and accusing each other as to whose doctrinal insights are
right. They argue with each other, saying, “We know this well, whereas
you do not. The discipline we practice is real and true, whereas you
follow the practice of a wrong view. In your argument you first state
what [logically] should be placed later [as conclusion] and assert what
should be placed first [as precedent] afterward. Thus, you uphold no
logical rule in upside-down confusion. What we practice is the ultimate,
while what you assert is wrong. You should question us if you have any
doubt about it at all.”
Listening to the arguments of those lay followers, supporters of the
Nirgrantha movement, of that country, Cunda has already become weary
of the disputes, sir.
The World-honored One said to the śrāmaṇera Cunda:
What you have observed [in Pāvā] seems likely to be what is going on.
O Cunda, the wrong doctrine they follow is not something worthy of
being heard. It is not the doctrine imparted by the Perfectly Enlightened
One. It is like a dilapidated commemorative tower (stupa) whose color
cannot be easily changed. Although those followers have a teacher, they
all uphold wrong views. Although they have a doctrine, it does not carry
ultimate truth. Hence, such a doctrine is not worthy of being heard or

adopting, nor is it a doctrine that would be able to help [anyone] as an
essential method of liberation. Any doctrine, other than the teaching
imparted by the Perfectly Enlightened One, cannot be altered, just as
the color of a dilapidated tower can be modified. Some of the disciples,
however, do not follow that doctrine but, forsaking wrong views, they
[try to] follow the practice of the right [doctrine]. O Cunda, suppose
someone were to then say to them, “Dear practitioners, the doctrine of
your master is right. You should carry out the practice within this doctrine.
Why do you abandon it?” If they believed these words, then both disciples
would be lost from the [true] path, incurring immeasurable sin. Why is
this so? It is because that doctrine does not carry ultimate truth.
O Cunda, when a master does not advocate a wrong view and his
doctrine bears ultimate truth, then it is worthy of hearing and adopting
and it is able to help anyone as an essential method of liberation. It is
[like] the doctrine imparted by the Perfectly Enlightened One and, like
the color of a newly built commemorative tower, it can easily be modified.
Some of those disciples, however, are unable to follow the practice of
this [true] doctrine, nor are they able to realize the result of that doctrine,
but instead they advocate wrong views by forsaking the path that is open
to everyone universally. Suppose someone were to say to those disciples,
“Dear practitioners, your master’s doctrine is right and you should follow
the practice of that doctrine. Why do you abandon it by advocating a
wrong view?” If the disciples believe these words, then they will all see
the real truth of that doctrine and acquire immeasurable merit. Why is
this so? It is because the doctrine carries ultimate truth.

The Buddha said to Cunda:

[On the other hand] even when disciples have a master who advocates
a wrong view and if the doctrine they follow does not carry ultimate
truth, it is neither worthy of hearing or adopting, nor does it help anyone
as an essential method of liberation. Thus, whatever doctrine other than
that which is imparted by the Perfectly Enlightened One cannot be easily
modified, like the color of a dilapidated commemorative tower. While
these disciples are equipped with the truth of the doctrine and follow
the practice prescribed therein, they advocate various wrong views. O

Cunda, suppose someone were to say to them, “The doctrine of your
master is right and the practice in which you are engaged is good. The
strife [and discord] in which you are now engaged will surely enable
you to realize the path of enlightenment and the result of nirvana in the
present life.” If these disciples believe these words and accept the practice,
then all will be lost from the path, incurring immeasurable sin. Why is
this so? It is because that doctrine does not carry ultimate truth.
O Cunda, if the master does not advocate a wrong view then the doc-
trine he imparts must carry ultimate truth, and that doctrine is worthy
of hearing and adopting and is able to help anyone as an essential method
of liberation. It is like the teaching of the Perfectly Enlightened One.
For instance, it is like a newly built commemorative tower whose color
can be easily be modified. Further, the disciples realize the truth of the
doctrines and while following the practices prescribed therein, they give
rise to right views within themselves. Suppose someone then says to
them, “The doctrine of your master is right and the practice in which
you are engaged is good. The strife [and discord] you are now engaging
in will surely enable you to realize the path of enlightenment and the
result of nirvana in the present life.” If those disciples believe these
words and accept the practice, they would all have the right view, acquir-
ing immeasurable merit. Why is this so? It is because the doctrine is of
the nature of ultimate truth.
O Cunda, there may be a case in which a true guiding teacher, having
appeared in this world, gives rise to anxiety in the hearts of his disciples,
or there may also be a case in which a true guiding teacher, having
appeared in this world, does not give rise to anxiety in the hearts of his
disciples. How could a qualified guiding teacher, having appeared in
this world, give rise to anxiety in the hearts of his disciples? O Cunda,
when such a master initially appears in the world soon after his realization
of the path, though his doctrine may be well endowed with the purity
of his practice of austerity, he may yet take the course of cessation (i.e.,
passing from the world) before his essential method of realizing ultimate
truth has circulated enough in the world. Consequently his disciples,
who have not yet sufficiently mastered the method of practice, are anx-
ious, saying, “Our master initially appeared in this world soon after the

time of his realization of the path. Though his doctrine is well endowed
with the purity of his practice of austerity, he may yet swiftly take the
course of cessation from this world without sufficiently propagating in
the essential method of realizing ultimate truth. Now the master may
swiftly take the course of cessation, leaving us unequipped with the
method of practice.” This is called “the anxiety of the disciples when
their guiding teacher has appeared in this world.”
What is [then] the case of “the non-anxiety of the disciples” when
their guiding teacher has appeared in this world? Suppose a [qualified]
guiding teacher appears in this world, with a doctrine well endowed with
the purity of the practice of austerity. When the essential method of real-
izing ultimate truth has been circulated widely in the world, then even
if their master were then to reach the end of his life, his disciples will
already have sufficiently mastered the method of practice. This [naturally]
reduces their anxiety and they say, “It has been a long time since our
guiding master initially appeared in this world; since his doctrine was
well endowed with the purity of the practice of austerity, his essential
method of realizing ultimate truth has also been circulated widely in this
world. Even if then he takes the course of cessation, he has already
helped his disciples master the method of realizing ultimate truth.” In
this way, O Cunda, the disciples have no anxiety about whether their
guiding master has appeared in this world.

The Buddha said to Cunda:

There is a set of criteria on the basis of which the practice of austerity
is regarded to be complete. Suppose a [qualified] guiding master has
appeared in this world only very recently and his name and reputation
have not yet widely circulated in society. This is called the the master’s
“nonfulfillment of the criterion of the practice of austerity.” O Cunda,
[suppose] a qualified guiding master has been in the world for a long
time since he initially undertook renunciation, and his name and repu-
tation have circulated widely in human society. This is called the master’s
“fulfillment of the criterion of the practice of austerity.”
O Cunda, [suppose] a [qualified] guiding master has been in this
world for a long time since he undertook his renunciation, and his name

and reputation have circulated widely in human society. Many of his
male disciples ( bhikṣu s), however, have not yet sufficiently received his
instruction, nor have they been fully endowed with the practice of aus-
terity, nor have they reached the goal of safety and peace, nor have they
benefited themselves with the merits thereof, nor have they received the
sanction for doctrinal proficiency, nor have they been permitted to prop-
agate the doctrine, nor are they yet able to settle religious disputes when-
ever they arise, as required by the proper rules, nor are they able to
acquire and demonstrate supernormal powers. This is called the master’s
“nonfulfillment of the criterion of the practice of austerity.”
O Cunda, [suppose] a qualified guiding master has been in this world
for a long time since he undertook renunciation. Hence, his name and rep-
utation have been well circulated far widely in human society. Accordingly,
all of his disciples have received his full instruction, and they are sufficiently
endowed with the practice of austerity, they have reached the abode of
safety and peace, they have benefited themselves with the merits thereof,
they have been granted the sanction for doctrinal proficiency, they are per-
mitted to propagate the doctrine, and they are capable of settling religious
disputes whenever they arise, as required by proper rules, and they can
demonstrate their acquisition of supernormal powers. This is called the
master’s “fulfillment of the criterion of the practice of austerity.”
O Cunda, [suppose] a [qualified] guiding master has been in this
world for a long time since he undertook renunciation, and his name
and reputation have circulated far widely in human society. Many of his
female disciples ( bhikṣuṇī s), however, have not sufficiently received his
instruction, nor have they fully been endowed with the practice of aus-
terity, nor have they reached the abode of safety and peace, nor have
they benefited themselves with the merits thereof, nor have they received
the sanction for doctrinal proficiency, nor are they permitted to propagate
the doctrine, nor are they yet able to settle religious disputes whenever
they arise, as required by proper rules, nor are they able to acquire and
demonstrate supernormal powers. This is called the master’s “nonful-
fillment of the criterion of the practice of austerity.”
O Cunda, [suppose] a qualified guiding master has been in this
world for a long time since he undertook renunciation and his name

and reputation have circulated far widely in human society. Accordingly,  
all of his female disciples ( _bhikṣuṇī_ s) have received his full instruction,  
they are sufficiently endowed with the practice of austerity, they have  
reached the abode of safety and peace and benefited themselves with the  
merits thereof, they have been granted the sanction for doctrinal proficiency,  
they are permitted to propagate the doctrine, they are capable of settling  
religious disputes whenever they arise, as required by proper rules, and  
to demonstrate their acquisition of supernormal powers. This is called the  
master’s “fulfillment of the criterion of the practice of austerity.”  
O Cunda, whether a qualified guiding master has fulfilled the criterion  
of the practice of austerity can also be determined by reference to his  
lay disciples, male and female, as to how widely and efficiently they  
have accomplished the practice of austerity, and so forth, up to how  
widely and efficiently they are able to demonstrate their acquisition of  
supernormal powers.  
O Cunda, [suppose] a [qualified] guiding master has neither been in  
this world, nor are his name and reputation, his material support, or his  
detractions known widely in human society. This is called the master’s  
“nonfulfillment of the criterion of the practice of austerity.” If, however,  
a qualified guiding master has been in this world and is endowed with  
name and reputation [that are widely circulated in society], and he  
enjoys full material support with no lack and is free from any detraction  
against him, he is regarded as having “fulfilled the criterion of the prac-  
tice of austerity.”  
Again, suppose that a qualified guiding master has been in this world  
and is endowed with name and reputation [widely circulated in society]  
and enjoys full material support with no lack. If, however, his disciples  
have not been endowed with their names and reputations or with full  
material support, this is also called the master’s “nonfulfillment of the  
criterion of the practice of austerity.” If a qualified guiding master has  
been in this world and is endowed with name and reputation [widely  
circulated in society] and receives full material support with no lack,  
and also if the names and reputations of his disciples have [widely cir-  
culated in society], they receive full material support with no lack, and  
they are free from any detraction against them, this is called the master’s

“fulfillment of the criterion of the practice of austerity.” Whether or not
the qualified guiding master fulfills the criterion of the practice of austerity
can also be determined by reference to his female disciples in similar terms.
O Cunda, it has been a long time since I undertook my renunciation.
My name and reputation have widely circulated in society. My disciples
have already been given instruction and training; they have reached the
goal of safety and peace (i.e., enlightenment and quiescence) and ben-
efited themselves with merits thereof; they have been granted my sanction
for doctrinal proficiency and are permitted to propagate the doctrine;
they are capable of settling religious disputes as they arise, as required
by proper rules, and they are able to demonstrate their acquisition of
supernormal powers. My female disciples as well as both male and
female lay disciples have also equally accomplished similar fulfillments
as have my male disciples. O Cunda, in these ways, I have successfully
propagated the practice of austerity far widely in human society, and so
forth, up to my demonstration of acquisition of supernormal powers. O
Cunda, there is no other guiding master in this world who is as greatly
renowned in name and reputation as well as in enjoying material support,
as myself, the Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One. O Cunda, I
can find no other religious order in this world that has been so fully
renowned in name and reputation and has received such material support
as my order.
O Cunda, if you wish to explain [the success of my religion] (i.e. the
practice of austerity) correctly, you should speak of the fact that “seeing
does not see.” What does it mean to say that seeing does not see? It
means that every [successful] practice of austerity is endowed with
purity, and this is proclaimed and manifested. This is called “seeing does
not see.”
Thereupon, the World-honored One said to the assembly of bhikṣu s:
[The philosopher] Udraka Rāmaputra taught his followers the following
theory: “Seeing does not see.” What did he mean by saying this? He
explained it by means of an analogy, for instance, “Seeing a sword, one
perceives its blade but does not perceive the edge of that blade.” O
bhikṣu s, the philosopher used that analogy to explain the meaning [of

“seeing does not see”] in reference to an ordinary person, who is unable
to perceive the edge of the blade. O Cunda, if you wish to describe the
matter correctly, you should refer to the real meaning of the fact that
seeing itself does not see. What does this mean? Every practice of aus-
terity is endowed with purity and is proclaimed and manifested. This is
that which one does not see. O Cunda, the continual [momentary] phe-
nomena of each practice of austerity can be known if one does not let
his attention rest on each fleeting moment. On the other hand, if one
tries to rest one’s attention on each moment, one cannot know the con-
tinuous phenomena of the practice of austerity as successful, even though
one is endowed [with its successful continuity]. O Cunda, of all the phe-
nomena of religion, the practice of austerity is the ultimate taste, like
the taste of ghee that is highest among all the milk products.

The World-honored One then said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

I have realized the ultimate experience in the following sets of disciplines,
namely, the four kinds of application of mental awareness, the four kinds
of supernormal powers, the four kinds of strenuous effort, the four kinds
of meditative absorption, the five kinds of spiritual faculties, the five
kinds of spiritual power, the seven auxiliary disciplines of enlightenment,
and the eightfold noble path. All of you should be in harmonious unity
and not allow disputes to arise, because you have been taught by the
same teacher and also because you are the members of the same order,
just as water and milk [easily mix together and become one]. Within the
Tathāgata’s religion you may realize the state of ultimate well-being
through reliance on oneself, like a candle, and [you will eventually]
realize the goal.
Suppose a bhikṣu gives an exhortation on some doctrine, and someone
[among the audience] objects, “Such-and-such passage explained by
So-and-so is neither correct, nor is the meaning thus rendered right.”
Having faced this kind of charge, the bhikṣu [this challenged] should
not respond either by accepting the charge as right or by rejecting it as
wrong. Rather, he should say to the other bhikṣu, “Dear colleague, what
do you think? My statement is like this, while yours is like that. The
meaning I rendered in my statement is like this, while the meaning you

rendered in your statement is like that. Which one, do you think, is supe-
rior and which is inferior?” The other bhikṣu then may respond, “My
statement is like this, and the meaning rendered is like that, whereas
your statement is like that, and the meaning rendered is like this. Your
statement seems to be superior and the meaning [thus rendered] is also
superior.” Having said this, however, that bhikṣu should say, “Neither
of our statements or of our meanings should be decided as wrong or
right [immediately]. Let us clarify the matter together so as to determine
whether my statement and meaning should be warned against, or receive
reprimand, or be condemned to abandonment.” In this way, all of you
should maintain harmonious unity and not give rise to disputes, because
you have been taught by the same teacher and also because you are
members of the same order [in which you are harmoniously mixed] just
like water and milk. Within the Tathāgata’s religion you may realize the
state of ultimate well-being through reliance on oneself, like a candle,
and [you will eventually] realize the goal.
Suppose a bhikṣu gives an exhortation on some doctrine, and someone
[among the audience] speaks out as follows, “Such-and-such passage
spoken by So-and-so is not correct, although the meaning thus rendered
is right.” Having faced this kind of charge, the former bhikṣu should not
respond either by accepting the charge as right or rejecting it as wrong.
Rather he should say to the bhikṣu [who challenged him], “Dear colleague,
what do you think? My statement is like this, while yours is like that.
Which one, do you think, is right and which is wrong?” The bhikṣu then
may respond, “My statement is like this, while yours is like that. Your
statement seems to be superior.” Having said this, the bhikṣu may continue,
“Neither of our statements should be decided as wrong or right [imme-
diately]. Let us clarify the matter together so as to determine whether my
passage is to be warned against, receive a reprimand, or condemned to
abandonment.” In this way, you should maintain harmonious unity and
not give rise of disputes, because you have been taught by the same
teacher and also because you are the members of the same order [and
mix together harmoniously,] like water and milk. Within the Tathāgata’s
religion you may realize the state of ultimate well-being through reliance
on oneself, like a candle, and [you will eventually] realize the goal.

Suppose a _bhikṣu_ gives an exhortation on some doctrine, and someone  
[among the audience] speaks out as follows, “Although such-and-such  
passage explained by So-and-so is correct, the meaning rendered is  
wrong.” Having faced this kind of charge, the _bhikṣu_ [thus challenged]  
should respond neither by accepting the charge as right nor rejecting it  
as wrong. Rather, he should say to the other _bhikṣu,_ “Dear colleague,  
what do you think? The meaning rendered [by my statement] is like this,  
while yours is like that. Which one is right and which is wrong?” That  
bhikṣu may then respond, “The meaning rendered in my statement is  
like this, while yours is like that. Your meaning seems to be superior.”  
Having said this, the _bhikṣu_ may continue, “Neither of these meanings  
should be decided as right or wrong [immediately], however. Let us clar-  
ify the matter together so as to determine whether the meaning I rendered  
should be warned against, reprimanded, or condemned to abandonment.”  
In this way, you should maintain harmonious unity and not give rise to  
disputes, because you have been taught by the same teacher and also  
because you are the members of the same order, [blending togther are  
easily as] water and milk. Within the Tathāgata’s religion you may realize  
the state of ultimate well-being through the reliance on oneself, like a  
candle, and [you will eventually] realize the goal.  
Suppose a _bhikṣu_ gives an exhortation on some doctrine, and someone  
[among the audience] speaks out as follows, “Such-and-such passage  
explained by So-and-so is correct, and the meaning rendered is also  
right.”The _bhikṣu_ , having listened to these words, cannot say anything  
is wrong but should instead praise the other _bhikṣu,_ “What you have  
said is right.” Because of these reasons, every _bhikṣu_ should have direct  
experience with the twelve categories of scriptures and spread these  
scriptures widely. The twelve categories are (1) the sacred discourses  
in prose ( _sūtra_ ), (2) the sacred discourses in prose and verse ( _geya_ ), (3)  
the doctrines and destinies of religious fulfillment ( _vyākaraṇa_ ), (4) the  
literature in verse ( _gāthā_ ), (5) the Buddha's solemn and joyous utterances  
in prose and verse ( _udāna_ ), (6) the doctrinal and Vinaya discourses as  
to motives and occasions ( _nidāna_ ), (7) stories of past lives and experi-  
ences as a bodhisattva ( _jātaka_ ), (8) stories of past events ( _avadāna_ ), (9)  
extensive doctrinal studies ( _vaipulya_ ), (10) descriptions of supernormal

events and mysteries ( adbhuta dharma ), (11) moral instructions consisting
of heroic stories and moral retributions ( itivṛttaka ), and (12) detailed
and extensive expositions and interpretations ( upadeśa ). Every bhikṣu
should uphold his experience well with these [twelve] categories of
scriptures, evaluate their meanings in observation, and spread the scrip-
tures as widely as possible.
O bhikṣu s, the robe that I set forth as the norm, whether it is [made
from rags] picked up in cemetery mounds or donated by wealthy house-
holders or obtained from ordinary households, should be sufficient if it
can protect one’s body from cold and heat as well as from mosquitoes
and gadflies, covering the four major parts of the body. O bhikṣu s, the
food that I set forth as the norm, whether it is obtained from almsrounds
or provided by lay householders, should be sufficient if it satisfies one’s
need. Because there is a danger of death when physical affliction and
various kinds of illness develop, one should receive as much food as is
needed. O bhikṣu s, the abode that I set forth as the norm should be either
under a shady tree, in an outdoor corridor, in a room, in a house, in a
rock cave, or in various kinds of residences. Whatever abode it may be,
if it can protect one from cold and heat, wind and rain, mosquitoes and
gadflies, and also insofar as it provides a secluded resting place, that is
sufficient. O bhikṣu s, the medicine I set forth as the norm is made of
either urine or excrement, and butter, oil, molasses, and sugar, in order
to satisfy one’s need. Because there is a danger of death when physical
affliction and various kinds of illness develop, one should receive as
much medicine as is needed.
The Buddha said:
Suppose that a heretic brāhmaṇa practitioner comes to accuse you,
saying, “The śramaṇa s, sons of the Śākyas, enjoy various self-enjoy-
ments.” If such words are spoken, you should reply to him, “You should
not utter such words. If the śramaṇa s, sons of the Śākyas, engage in var-
ious self-enjoyments, the reason is that there is a kind of enjoyment the
Tathāgata reprimands, while there is also another kind of enjoyment that
the Tathāgata praises.” The heretic brāhmaṇa may then ask, “What kind
of self-enjoyment is found blameworthy by the Tathāgata?” When this

is asked, you should reply, “The qualities that the five kinds of desire  
respectively obtain ( _pañca-kāma-guṇa_ ) are endearing and enjoyable  
and [so they] become objects of human attachment. What are these five  
qualities? The visual faculty discerns forms, which, being endearing and  
enjoyable, become an object of attachment. [In like manner,] the auditory  
faculty discerns sounds, the olfactory faculty discerns smells, the gustatory  
faculty discerns tastes, and the tactile faculty discerns physical touch.  
Because these are endearing and enjoyable, they become objects of  
attachment. Furthermore, the indirect causes of the five desires give rise  
to delight and happiness, which the Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlight-  
ened One condemns.  
Furthermore, it is like the case of a person who deliberately kills other  
sentient beings to obtain happiness. The desire to kill, taking a life, is  
what the Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One condemns. Again,  
it is like the case of someone who deliberately steals others’ prperty, in  
order to obtain happiness. The desire to steal is what the Tathāgata, Arhat,  
Perfectly Enlightened One condemns. Again, it is like the case of someone  
who deliberately violates the practice of austerity in order to obtain hap-  
piness. The desire to commit sexual misconduct is what the Tathāgata,  
Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One condemns. Again, it is like the case  
of someone who deliberately speaks falsehoods in order to obtain hap-  
piness. The desire to lie is what the Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlight-  
ened One condemns. Again, it is like the case of someone who deliber-  
ately spends his wealth on drinking, and so on, as he wishes, in order to  
obtain happiness. The desire to [spend one’s wealth] on drinking and so  
on is what the Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One condemns.  
Again, it is like the case of someone who deliberately engages in heretical  
practices of self-mortification (ascetic practice) in order to obtain hap-  
piness. The desire to engage in heretical practices of self-mortification  
is what the Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One condemns.”  
O _bhikṣu_ s, I condemn the five kinds of sensation fulfilled by the five  
kinds of desire. These are the objects of human attachment. What are  
these five? The visual faculty discerns forms, which, being endearing  
and enjoyable, become an object of attachment. [In like manner,] the  
auditory faculty discerns sounds, the olfactory faculty discerns smells,

the gustatory faculty discerns tastes, and the tactile faculty discerns phys-
ical touch. As these are endearing, they become objects of human attach-
ment. Though these are the kinds of happiness [sought by ordinary peo-
ple], the śramaṇa s, sons of the Śākyas, do not regard them as [real]
happiness. It is just like a person who deliberately kills other sentient
beings in order to obtain happiness. This is not the kind of happiness
[sought by] śramaṇa s, sons of the Śākyas. Again, it is just like someone
who deliberately steals others’ things in order to obtain happiness. This
is not the kind of happiness [sought by] śramaṇa s, sons of the Śākyas.
Again, it is just like someone who deliberately violates the practice of
austerity in order to obtain happiness. This is not the kind of happiness
[sought by] śramaṇa s, sons of the Śākyas. Again, it is just like someone
who deliberately speaks falsehoods in order to obtain happiness. This
is not the kind of happiness [soiught by] the śramaṇa s, sons of the Śākyas.
Again, it is just like someone who deliberately spends his wealth on
drinking, and so on. as he desires. This is not the kind of happiness
[sought by] śramaṇa s, sons of the Śākyas. Again, it is just like someone
who deliberately engages in heretical practices of self-mortification.
This is not what the Tathāgata taught as right practice. It is not the kind
of happiness [sought by] śramaṇa s, sons of the Śākyas.
Again, some heretic brāhmaṇa practitioners may ask, “What kind of
self-enjoyment is praised by the śramaṇa Gautama?” O bhikṣu s, if you
are asked such a question, you should reply, “Dear friends, the qualities
(i.e., sensations) obtained by the five kinds of desire are endearing and
enjoyable, and [are therefore likely to] become objects of human attach-
ment. What are these five? The visual faculty discerns forms, and so
forth, up to the tactile faculty which discerns physical touch, through
which respective sensations are cherished and enjoyed, and become
objects of attachment. Dear friend, these kinds of happiness, which arise
from the five kinds of desire as direct cause and their respective objects
as indirect cause, should be eradicated as quickly as possible. It is just
like someone who deliberately kills other sentient beings in order to
obtain happiness. If there is this kind of happiness, one should eradicate
it immediately. Again, it is just like someone who deliberately steals
others’ things in order to obtain happiness. If there is this kind of happiness,

one should eradicate it immediately. Again, it is just like someone who  
deliberately violates the practice of austerity in order to obtain happiness.  
If there be this kind of happiness, one should eradicate it immediately.  
Again, it is just like someone who deliberately speaks falsehoods in  
order to obtain happiness. If there is that kind of happiness, one should  
eradicate it immediately. Again, it is just like someone who deliberately  
spends his wealth on drinking and so on, as he desires, in order to obtain  
happiness. If there is this kind of happiness, one should eradicate it  
immediately. Again, it is just like someone who deliberately engages in  
heretical practices of self-mortification in order to obtain happiness. If  
there is this kind of happiness, one should eradicate it immediately.  
Furthermore, it is just like someone who, distancing himself from  
avarice and from other evil defilements, realizes the first meditative state  
of absorption in which there is an awareness of an object and an act of  
examining, while the sense of joy and bliss increase through removal  
of the cause of birth (i.e., reaching the supramundane realm). This kind  
of happiness is what the Buddha praises. Again, it is just like someone  
who, eliminating the awareness of an object and the subjective act of  
examination, with increasing tranquility or self-confidence, continually  
applying mental concentration, enters the second meditative state of  
absorption in which there is neither the awareness of an object nor a  
subjective act, but the sense of joy and bliss predominate in the arising  
state of concentration. This kind of happiness is what the Buddha praises.  
Again it is just like someone who, with the fading away of the sense of  
joy but dwelling in the sense of equanimity, fully aware of subtler bliss,  
reaches the third meditative state of absorption in which he experiences  
the mindfulness, equanimity, and bliss that are sought by the wise and  
holy practitioner. This kind of happiness is what the Buddha praises.  
Again, it is just like someone who, having transcended both pain and  
pleasure and removed sorrow and joy, realizes the fourth meditative  
state of absorption in which there is neither pain nor pleasure but an  
increase of the state of equanimity that consolidates pure and genuine  
mindfulness. This kind of happiness is what the Buddha praises.  
If any heretic _brāhmaṇa_ practitioners should ask, “How many mer-  
itorious effects do you seek to realize in this kind of happiness?”, you

should reply, “This kind of happiness is comprised of seven meritorious
effects. What are these seven? One realizes direct experience of the ulti-
mate path in the present life; if defilement obstructs him from realizing
it, he may realize it at the time of his death. If he is again obstructed from
it at the time of death, he may eradicate the five kinds of defilement^21 that
bind sentient beings to the lower realm of desire, or he may realize one
of the five kinds of final nirvana without returning to this world: first, an
anāgāmin (nonreturner) who passes away in the middle of his term of
life in some particular heaven; second, an anāgāmin who passes away
from the realm of desire ( kāmadhātu ) and is reborn in the realm of form
( rūpadhātu ) and enters nirvana from there; third, an anāgāmin who enters
nirvana after proper mental preparation; fourth, an anāgāmin who enters
nirvana without any mental preparation; and fifth, an anāgāmin who is
born in the highest Akaniṣṭha Heaven (i.e., ārūpya dhātu, formless realm)
and enters nirvana from there. Dear friends, these are the seven meritorious
effects of the foregoing kinds of happiness.
Suppose a bhikṣu is still engaged in the practice of moral discipline,
seeking the higher goal of safety and peace, but is unable to eradicate
the five kinds of moral and spiritual hindrances: (1) sexual desire, (2)
malice, (3) sloth and drowsiness, (4) agitation and worry, and (5) doubt.
If a bhikṣu is still engaged in the practice of moral discipline, seeking
the higher goal of safety and peace, but is unable to eradicate the five
kinds of moral and spiritual hindrances, unable to exert himself in the
four kinds of mental awareness, and unable to exert himself in the practice
of the seven auxiliary disciplines of enlightenment, he would in no way
be in the position to seek clear insight in order to strengthen the possibility
of realizing that state that is beyond human conditions and that of saintly
transcendent knowledge. Dear friends, only when a bhikṣu who is prac-
ticing moral discipline, seeking the higher goal of safety and peace, is
able to eradicate the five kinds of moral and spiritual hindrances, to exert
himself in the four kinds of mental awareness, and to exert himself in
the practice of seven auxiliary disciplines of enlightenment, will he then
be in the position to seek clear insight in order to strengthen the possibility
of realizing the state that is beyond human conditions and of that of
saintly transcendent knowledge.

Dear friends, when a _bhikṣu_ realizes the state of an arhat by eradicating  
all defilements, he has accomplished what should be accomplished in  
life, thus lightening his burden. From this he acquires meritorious benefit  
for himself, puts an end to various existential fetters, attains liberation  
through right knowledge, and never falls into the nine kinds of wrong  
conduct. What are these nine kinds [of wrong conduct]? They are (1)  
taking life (killing), (2) taking what is not given (stealing), (3) breaking  
the practice of austerity, (4) speaking falsehoods, (5) forsaking the path,  
(6) following [the dictates of desire, (7) following [the dictates of] anger,  
(8) following [the dictates of] fear, and (9) following [the dictates] of  
delusion. Dear friends, this is called the resulting state of the arhat in  
which, having eradicated all defilements, he accomplishes what should  
be accomplished in life, thus lightening his burden; from this he acquires  
meritorious benefit for himself, puts an end to various existential fetters,  
attains liberation through right knowledge, and distances himself from  
the nine kinds of wrong conduct.  
Again, some heretic _brāhmaṇa_ s criticize Buddhists, saying, “The  
_śramaṇa_ s, sons of the Śākyas, uphold a doctrine that says impermanent  
things exist.” You should reply, “Dear friends, you should not make this  
kind of critical comment against us. Why do you think that the _śramaṇa_ s,  
sons of the Śākyas, uphold the theory that there exist noneternal things?  
The truth thus held by the _śramaṇa_ s, sons of the Śākyas, however, is  
itself eternal, immovable, and immutable, just like the threshold of a  
gate is immovable and immutable, [though passersby may come and go  
through it]. In like manner, the truth [about the way in which impermanent  
things exist in continuity] held by the _śramaṇa_ s, sons of the Śākyas, is  
eternal and immovable.  
Again, some heretic _brāhmaṇa_ s criticize Buddhists, saying, “The  
_śramaṇa_ Gautama knows all past events but he does not know future  
events.” Since heretic _brāhmaṇa_ s presuppose a different notion of knowl-  
edge as well as a different notion of transcendent insight, their words  
of criticism [on Buddhist teachings] are baseless. Past events, which are  
directly seen before his eyes, would never have escaped from the Tathā-  
gata’s supernormal power of vision. As for the future, he gives rise to  
the knowledge born of enlightenment. If events that took place in the  

past were neither real nor productive of delight and happiness, and there-
fore not beneficial to anyone, the Buddha does not record [such events].
Again, even if they were real, [if those past events] were not productive
of delight and happiness and not beneficial to anyone, the Buddha does
not record them. Again, if those events were real and productive of
delight and happiness, but were still not beneficial to anyone, the Buddha
does not record them. If, however, [those past events] were real, pro-
ductive of delight and happiness, and also beneficial to all, the Tathāgata
has cognizance of them all and subsequently recalls them. In the case
of events that take place in the present as well as in the future, the Tathā-
gata’s supernormal power should be regarded equally, as before. In the
past, present, and future the Tathāgata’s words will never be false, regard-
less whether they are spoken on proper occasions, are about practical
and factual matters, or about useful matters, or on doctrine, or about the
disciplines.
The Buddha initially realized supreme enlightenment during the first
third of the night, and [that experience] remained with him throughout
his life, until the latter third of the night [on which he entered pari nir -
vāṇa ]. Throughout the period between these two nights, whatever speech
the Buddha made is, without exception, true as to how things really are.
Thus he is called the Tathāgata. Moreover, the Tathāgata’s speech is fac-
tual, and facts are like the Buddha’s speech. Thus he is called the Tathā-
gata. What does the title “Perfectly Enlightened One” mean? The Buddha
perfectly knows all the contents of his insight, his cessation, and his
enlightenment. Thus he is called “perfectly enlightened.”
Again, some heretic brāhmaṇa s assert a theory that “the world exists
eternally is alone true, while the rest is false.” Other heretics assert
another theory that “the world exists temporarily is alone true, while the
rest is false.” Again, a third theory asserts that “the world both eternally
exists and temporarily exists is alone true, while the rest is false.” Again,
a fourth theory asserts that “the world neither eternally exists nor tem-
porarily exists is alone true, while the rest is false.” Again, a fifth theory
that asserts that “this world has its limit [in time and space] is alone true,
while the rest is false.” Again, a sixth theory asserts that “this world has
no limit [in time and space] is alone true, while the rest is false.” Again,

a seventh theory asserts that “this world has both limit and no limit is  
alone true, while the rest is false.” Again, an eighth theory asserts that  
“this world has neither limit nor no limit is alone true, while the rest is  
false.” Again, a ninth theory asserts that that “having both this life and  
this body is alone real, while the rest is false.” Again a tenth theory  
asserts that “having neither a life nor a body is alone real, while the rest  
is false.” Again, an eleventh theory asserts that “having both a different  
life and a different body is alone real, while the rest is false.” Again, a  
twelfth theory asserts that “having neither a different life nor a different  
body is alone real, while the rest is false. Again, a thirteenth theory  
asserts that “the Tathāgata has an end [to his existence] is alone true,  
while the rest is false.” Again, a fourteenth theory asserts that “the Tathā-  
gata has no end [to his existence] is alone true, while the rest is false.”  
Again, a fifteenth theory asserts that “the Tathāgata has both an end to  
his existence and no end to his existence is alone true, while the rest is  
false.” Again, a sixteenth theory asserts that “the Tathāgata has neither  
an end to his existence nor no end to his existence is alone true, while  
the rest is false.” The foregoing are called the basic [alternative] theories  
concerning past (i.e., original) existence. I have recorded for your sake  
[these] theories that assert “this world is eternal,” and so on, up to the  
[last] theory that asserts “the Tathāgata has neither an end to his existence  
nor no end to his existence.” The foregoing are all wrong views ( _mithyā-  
dṛṣṭi_ ) concerning the basic theories of future existence. I have recorded  
them for your sake.  
I shall also record the [views] concerned with the basic theories of  
future existence. What is the theory of future existence? I will record  
the following possibilities. A first theory asserts that “the self consists  
of materiality and has an end according to [one’s] thought (i.e., con-  
sciousness) is alone true, while the rest is false.” In like manner, a second  
theory asserts that “the self consists of immateriality and has an end  
according to one’s thought”; a third theory asserts that “the self consists  
of both materiality and immateriality and has an end according to one’s  
thought”; a fourth theory asserts that “the self consists neither of mate-  
riality nor immateriality and has an end according to one’s thought”; a  
fifth theory asserts that “the self[’s existence] has a limit [in space and

time]”; a sixth theory asserts that “the self has no limit [in time and
space]’; a seventh theory asserts that “the self has both limit and no
limit”; an eighth theory asserts that “the self has neither a limit nor no
limit and has an end according to one’s thought”; a ninth theory asserts
that “the self has no happiness and has an end according to one’s thought”;
a tenth theory asserts that “the self has both happiness and suffering and
has an end according to one’s thought”; an eleventh theory asserts that
“the self has neither suffering nor happiness and has an end according
to one’s thought”; a twelfth theory asserts that “the self consists of a
single thought and has an end according to one’s thought”; a thirteenth
theory asserts that “the self consists of multiple thoughts and has an end
according to one’s thought”; a fourteenth theory asserts that “the self
consists of a few thoughts and has an end according to one’s thought”;
a fifteenth theory asserts that “the self consists of an infinite number of
thoughts and has an end according to one’s thought is alone true, while
the rest is false.” These are called the basic theories of wrong views con-
cerning future existence. I have recorded them for your sake.
Again, some śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s may raise the following the-
ories and views, [which assert that] “this world eternally exists is alone
true, while the rest is false,” and so forth, up to the [last] theory, which
asserts that “the self is consists of an immeasurable number of thoughts
is alone true, while the rest is false.” Again, “such-and-such theories,
such-and-such views, are alone true, while the rest is false.”
You should answer, “You have certainly raised this theory, but why
should this theory asert that ‘the world eternally exists is alone true,
while the rest is false’? This kind of theoretical statement is not accepted
by the Buddha. Why? Because all of these theories and views [in which
respective theories are formulated] is comprised of some fetter of attach-
ment. From examining the foregoing theories, I infer that there is no
one among all the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s who can equal my theory
and view. How could there be anyone equal to myself, especially because
they overemphasize their respective theories over those of others? These
varieties of wrong views concerning the self are merely [empty] speech,
and there is none about which both parties can discuss. This refutation

equally applies to all the other theories, up to the one that asserts that
the self consists of an immeasurable number of thoughts.
Again, some śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s uphold a theory that this world
is created by itself. Again, other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s uphold another
theory that this world is created by [something] other [than itself]. Again,
a third group asserts that this world is created by both itself and by others.
Again, a fourth group may assert that the world is created neither by
itself nor by others, but [came into being] suddenly, [without cause].
[You should know that the very existence of] these śramaṇa s and
brāhmaṇa s who uphold the theory that the world is created by itself,
however, are [ultimately] based on the causality of the contact of the
sense faculties with their respective objects. [Therefore,] no one can
explain the origin of the world in a theory without including the causality
of sense contact. Why is this so? Because the six sense faculties establish
contact with their respective objects by way of the physical body. On
the basis of this contact ( sparśa ), there arises sensation; on the basis of
sensation ( vedanā ), there arises craving; on the basis of craving ( tṛṣṇā ),
there arises grasping; on the basis of grasping ( upādana ), there arises
the will to becoming; on the basis of the will to becoming ( bhava ), there
arises birth; on the basis of birth ( jāti ), there arises old age and death
( jarāmaraṇa ), and the mass of great troubles, such as sorrow, lamentation,
suffering, and affliction. If there are no six sense faculties, contact cannot
arise; if there is no contact, sensation cannnot arise; if there is no sen-
sation, craving cannot arise; if there is no craving, grasping cannot arise;
if there is no grasping, the will to becoming cannot arise; if there is no
will to becoming, birth cannot arise; if there is no birth, old age and
death, as well as the mass of great troubles, such as sorrow, lamentation,
suffering, and affliction, cannot arise. In order to refute the remaining
three alternative theories, you may apply this same [principle of] causality
(i.e., dependent origination), because when there is contact of the senses
and [their] objects, existence arises; when there is no such contact, exis-
tence cannot arise.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

If you wish to terminate these wrong views you should rely on the four  
kinds of application of mental awareness, especially by applying them  
in three ways of practice. How should a _bhikṣu_ terminate these wrong  
views through reliance on the four kinds of mental awareness, especially  
by applying them in three ways? First, when a _bhikṣu_ observes his inner  
body (inner senses) in concentration he should make effort without slack-  
ening, being mindful of his observations to keep them in memory, thereby  
removing worldly desires and anxiety; second, while observing his outer  
body (outer senses) he should make effort without slackening, being  
mindful of his observations to keep them in memory, thereby removing  
worldly desires and anxiety; third, while observing both inner and outer  
body he should make effort without slackening, being mindful of his  
observations to keep them in memory, thereby removing worldly desires  
and anxiety. These three forms of practice also apply to the observation  
of one’s sensations, the observation of one’s mind (intellect), and the  
observation of one’s psychophysical elements.  
There are eight different states of liberation that result from these  
practices. What are these eight? First, the liberation realized when one,  
with an ideation of internal form, perceives external forms; second, the  
liberation realized when one, without any ideation of internal form, per-  
ceives external forms; third, the liberation ealized when one has thus  
terminated all defilements; fourth, the liberation realized when one,  
having transcended all ideations of form and annihilated sensory reaction,  
abides in the first formless state of concentration, the realm of infinite  
space; fifth, the liberation realized when one, having transcended the  
realm of infinite space, abides in the realm of infinite consciousness;  
sixth, the liberation realized when one, having transcended the previous  
realm, abides in the realm of nothingness or nonutility; seventh, the lib-  
eration realized when one, having transcended the previous realm, abides  
in the realm of neither ideation nor nonideation; and eighth, the liberation  
realized when one, having transcended the previous realm, abides in the  
final state of cessation, having transcended both senses and ideation,  
which is equivalent to the third saintly state of _anāgāmin._  
At that time Ānanda was [standing behind] the World-honored One, fan-  
ning him. [When the Buddha’s exhortation was over,] Ānanda at once

rearranged his outer robe to expose his right shoulder and, kneeling with his  
right knee on the ground and both palms joined together, he said to the  
Buddha:

It is wonderful, World-honored One, this doctrine [you have] exhorted is  
endowed with foremost purity and subtlety. What title should be given to  
this exhortation and how should it be received and carried out, sir?  
The Buddha replied to Ānanda, “This sutra can be called “Purity” and  
you should retain it without any admixture (lit., “in a pure manner”).”  
Having thus listened to the Buddha’s exhortation, Ānanda was delighted,  
respectfully received it, and carried it out as taught by the Buddha.
