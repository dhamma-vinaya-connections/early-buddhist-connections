### A Buddhist Cosmology

#### (No Parallel in Dīgha Nikāya )

#### Article 1: The Land of

#### Jambudvīpa

Thus have I heard. Once, when the Buddha was visiting the city of Śrāvastī,  
accompanied by one thousand two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s, he stayed at  
the Kareri-kuṭikā cloister of Anāthapiṇḍika Monastery in Prince Jeta’s Grove.  
After the morning almsround a few of the _bhikṣu_ s met in the lecture hall to  
talk, saying:

Venerables, it is beyond our imagining how and why this world could be  
slated for destruction and then reconstruction. What will become of the  
myriad homes of sentient beings?”  
The World-honored One was meditating in seclusion but through his super-  
normal power of crystal-clear hearing he overheard the discussion among  
the _bhikṣu_ s gathered in the lecture hall. He immediately got up from his seat  
in the Kareri-kuṭikā cloister, went to the lecture hall, and took his place.  
Though he already knew [what they had been talking about], the World-hon-  
ored One asked, “O _bhikṣu_ s, what have you been discussing?”  
The _bhikṣu_ s recounted their discussion to the Buddha:  
Sir, we were meeting after the day’s meal and someone asked, “Venerables,  
it is beyond our imagining how this world could be slated for destruction  
and then recreation. What will become of the myriad homes of sentient  
beings?”  
At that, the World-honored One said:  
Very good, very good. Those who renounce domestic life take up two  
kinds of practice: first, silent introspection as practiced by the wise and

saintly disciples, and second, analysis of religious doctrine. As you have
met in this hall, you must not only follow the meditation practice of the
wise and saintly disciples but also discuss and debate doctrinal issues. O
bhikṣu s, would you like to hear the Tathāgata’s recollection of the creation
and destruction of this world and the fate of the lands and communities
where sentient beings reside?
The bhikṣu s replied, “Yes, O World-honored One. We are eager to hear
your account. Anything you reveal will be gratefully received and we shall
observe it carefully.”
The Buddha said, “Listen attentively, you must retain what I say and keep
it in mind. I will give you the very core of the matter.”
With that, the Buddha began his discourse:
The sun and moon regularly pass over the four continents and illuminate
them, [as we have always experienced]. Yet there are a thousand worlds
just like this [in the universe]. In these worlds there are a thousand suns
and moons passing over a thousand lofty Mount Sumerus, as well as four
thousand smaller lands and four thousand larger lands, four thousand
oceans and four thousand greater oceans, four thousand nāga s (dragons)
and four thousand greater nāga s, four thousand garuḍa s (mythological
bird) and four thousand greater garuḍa s, four thousand evil paths and
four thousand greater evil paths, four thousand kings and four thousand
greater kings, and seven thousand great trees, eight thousand great hells,
ten thousand great mountains, a thousand lords of Yama, a thousand appear-
ances of the four guardian gods, a thousand occurrences of the Heaven of
the Thirty-three Gods (Trāyastriṃśa), a thousand Yama Heavens, a thousand
Tuṣita Heavens, a thousand Nirmāṇarati Heavens, where the residents
enjoy pleasures of their own creation, a thousand Paranirmitavaśavartin
Heavens, where the inhabitants enjoy pleasures created by others, and a
thousand Brahmā Heavens. Together, all these make up the small universe,
which consists of a thousand such worlds.
[Now,] there is also a larger universe, consisting of a thousand of these
small universes, called the middle universe. [In addition,] there is a great
universe that consists of a thousand middle universes. This is called the
triple thousand–great universe ( sanqian taqian shijie ). All of the great

universe [that comprises many thousands of middle and small universes]  
undergoes the cycle of creation and destruction, and each locality where  
sentient beings reside is called a buddha land ( _buddha-kṣetra_ ).

The Buddha continued:

The depth of this great earth is one hundred and sixty-eight thousand  
_yojana_ s^23 and its circumference is beyond measure. The earth rests on a  
layer of water three thousand and thirty _yojana_ s deep, whose circumference  
is immeasurable. The water rides over a layer of airy wind that is six thou-  
sand and forty _yojana_ s deep with an immeasurable circumference. O  
_bhikṣu_ s, the depth of the great ocean is eighty-four thousand _yojana_ s and  
its circumference is immeasurable. The part of Mount Sumeru that is sub-  
merged in the ocean is eighty-four thousand _yojana_ s deep, and the part  
that rises above the ocean’s surface into the atmosphere is eighty-four  
thousand _yojana_ s high. The base of the mountain adheres to a foundation  
of very hard earth. On the mountain’s summit no rough or uneven terrain  
can be found and many varieties of trees grow, emitting exquisite fragrance  
that permeates the forest. A number of wise and saintly hermits live in  
this forest, which is [also] the abode of the great god Yama. A layer of  
pure gold sand runs through the foundation of the mountain, and on its  
four sides, rising as high as seven hundred _yojana_ s, are hillocks in the  
variegated hues of seven kinds of precious stones, which gradually fall  
away in a long curve to reveal the expanse of the ocean beyond.  
The pathway on Mount Sumeru is a stairway strewn with seven precious  
stones. At its broadest, on the lower slope of the mountain, it is sixty  
_yojana_ s wide. On both sides of the pathway are sevenfold walls made of  
precious stones, embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets,  
and seven lines of trees. The golden wall is endowed with silver gates,  
the silver wall with golden gates, the quartz wall with lapis gates, the lapis  
wall with quartz gates, the ruby wall with agate gates, the agate wall with  
ruby gates, and the emerald wall with gates decorated with many kinds  
of precious stones. The railings are similarly decorated: the golden railing  
is ornamented with ropes made of silver, the silver railing with ropes made  
of gold, the quartz railing with ropes made of lapis, the lapis railing with  
ropes made of quartz, the ruby railing with ropes made of agate, the agate

railing with ropes made of rubies, and the emerald railing with a variety
of precious stones. Over these railings are hung decorative nets strung
with various ornaments. From the golden net hangs a silver bell; from the
silver net hangs a golden bell; from the lapis net hangs a quartz bell; from
the quartz net hangs a lapis bell; from the ruby net hangs an agate bell;
from the agate net hangs a ruby bell; and from the emerald net hangs a
bell inlaid with various precious stones.
The golden trees have golden trunks and branches and silver flowers
and fruit. The silver trees have silver trunks and branches and golden
flowers and fruit. The quartz trees have quartz trunks and branches and
lapis flowers and leaves, while the lapis trees have lapis trunks and branches
and quartz flowers and leaves. The ruby trees have ruby trunks and
branches and agate flowers and leaves, while the agate trees have agate
trunks and branches and flowers and leaves made of rubies. The emerald
trees have emerald trunks and branches and flowers and leaves made of
a variety of precious stones.
Each of the seven walls has four gates, protected by barriers. Each wall,
topped with a pavilion and veranda, encloses a bathing pond and pleasure
garden filled with foliage and flowers made of precious treasures. The trees
standing in lines are also made of precious treasures, and bear flowers and
fruit in abundance. Exquisite fragrance arises in all directions, pleasing every-
one. Wild ducks and hawks; mandarin ducks, both male and female; and a
host of innumerable rare birds sing harmoniously together.
The pathway on the middle slope of Mount Sumeru is forty yojana s
wide. Here too, on both sides, are sevenfold walls made of precious stones,
embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, seven lines of
trees, and so on, with innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together,
just as below. On the upper slope the pathway is twenty yojana s wide, with
sevenfold walls made of precious stones on either side, embellished with
seven railings, seven ornamental nets, seven lines of trees, and so on, with
innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together, just as below.
The Buddha [continued] his discourse to the bhikṣu s:
Along the pathway on the lower slope lives a bird called the garuḍa. On
the middle slope lives a deity called Mālādhāra, and on the upper slope

lives the deity Sadāmatta. The foothills [around the mountain] are forty-  
two thousand _yojana_ s high, and the palaces of the four guardian gods  
[located] on them are ringed by sevenfold walls embellished with seven  
railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees adorned with  
bells made of precious stones, and so on, with innumerable rare birds  
singing harmoniously together, just as before.  
On top of Mount Sumeru are the palaces of the thirty-three gods, also  
ringed by sevenfold walls embellished with seven railings, seven orna-  
mental nets, and seven lines of trees, with golden walls and silver gates,  
and silver walls and golden gates, and so on, with innumerable rare birds  
singing harmoniously together, just as before. Beyond this, one _yojana_  
higher, is the palace of the god Yama. Beyond this, one _yojana_ higher, is  
the palace of the gods of Tuṣita Heaven. Beyond this, one _yojana_ higher,  
is the palace of Nirmāṇarati Heaven. Beyond this, one _yojana_ higher, is  
the palace of Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven. Beyond this, one _yojana_  
higher, is the palace of Brahmakāyika Heaven.  
Between Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven and Brahmakāyika Heaven is  
the palace of the lord of the evil ones, Māra, an area of sixty thousand  
_yojana_ s surrounded by sevenfold walls with seven railings, seven orna-  
mental nets, and seven lines of trees, and so on, with innumerable birds  
singing harmoniously together, just as before.  
Beyond the Brahmakāyika Heaven, one _yojana_ higher, is the palace of  
Ābhāsvara Heaven. Beyond this, one _yojana_ higher, is the palace of Śub-  
hakṛtsna Heaven. Beyond this, one _yojana_ higher, is the palace of Anabhraka  
Heaven. Beyond this, one _yojana_ higher, is the palace of Puṇyaprasava  
Heaven. Beyond this, one _yojana_ higher, is the palace of Asaṃjñisattva  
Heaven. Beyond this, one _yojana_ higher, is the palace of Bṛhatphala Heaven.  
Beyond this, one _yojana_ higher, is the palace of Abṛha Heaven. Beyond  
this, one _yojana_ higher, is the palace of Atapa Heaven. Beyond this, one  
_yojana_ higher, is the palace of Sudṛśa Heaven. Beyond this, one _yojana_  
higher, is the palace of Sudarśana Heaven. Beyond this, one _yojana_ higher,  
is the palace of Akaniṣṭha Heaven. Beyond this, one _yojana_ higher, are the  
gods of Ākāśānantyāyatana Heaven, the gods of Vijñānānantyāyatana  
Heaven, the gods of Ākiṃcanyāyatana Heaven, and the gods of  
Naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyātana Heaven. All of this constitutes the abodes of

sentient beings who are confined to their respective realms. All sentient
beings are inherently subject to the law of birth, old age, illness, and death,
they invariably acquire a configuration of the five psychophysical elements,
and thus they receive nothing more nor less than an existential becoming.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
To the north of Mount Sumeru is a land called Uttarakuru, a square area
measuring ten thousand yojana s on each side. The faces of the people
there also are square, reflecting the shape of their land. To the east of
Mount Sumeru is a land called Pūrvavideha, which is round with a radius
of nine thousand yojana. The faces of the people there also are round,
reflecting the form of their land. To the west of Mount Sumeru is a land
called Aparagodānīya, shaped like a half moon, with a radius of eight
thousand yojana. The faces of the people there similarly reflect the form
of their land. To the south of Mount Sumeru is a land called Jambudvīpa,
which is narrower in the south and broad and open in the north, measuring
seven thousand yojana s in length and breadth. The faces of the people of
Jambudvīpa also reflect the form of their land. In the northern sky above
Mount Sumeru a golden source of light illuminates the northern region.
In the eastern sky above Mount Sumeru a silvery source of light illuminates
the eastern region. In the western sky above Mount Sumeru a quartz source
of light illuminates the western region. In the southern sky above Mount
Sumeru a source of light made of lapis illuminates the southern region.
In the northern land of Uttarakuru there is a great tree called Mango,
with a diameter of seven yojana s, rising to a height of one hundred yojana s,
whose branches and leaves spread out in all directions to a distance of fifty

diameter of seven _yojana_ s, a height of one hundred _yojana_ s, and branches  
and leaves spreading out in all directions to a distance of fifty _yojana_ s.  
Near Mount Sumeru there is a mountain called Qutoluo, whose height,  
length, and breadth all measure forty-two thousand _yojana_ s. The foothills  
of this mountain extend far and wide and glitter with the variegated colors  
produced by the seven kinds of treasure. This mountain is located at a  
distance of eighty-four thousand _yojana_ s from Mount Sumeru, and the  
area between them is filled with many water lilies, including blue ( _utpala_ ),  
pink ( _padma_ ), red ( _kumuda_ ), and white ( _puṇḍarīka_ ) varieties, with reeds,

Beyond these many kinds of groves and far out to the horizon, the
ground is covered by innumerable ponds, each spreading over a length
and breadth of fifty yojana s and filled with pink, red, and white lotus blos-
soms, with poisonous snakes among them. Beyond these ponds lies a vast
expanse consisting of a great lake called Udyāna (Youzhanna). Under the
surface of the water in this lake is the passageway used by the cakravartin
(universal ruler), measuring twelve yojana s wide. On both sides of this
road are sevenfold walls embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental
nets, and seven lines of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure.
When the cakravartin appears in the land of Jambudvīpa the water auto-
matically recedes so that the expanse of the passageway stands [ready to
be used].
Not far from this lake is a mountain called Youzhan. The mountain is
beautiful and filled with luxuriant vegetation, abundant flowers and fruit,
and much exquisite fragrance. All the different kinds of birds and animals,
without exception, live here. Not far from Mount Youzhan is another
mountain, called Suvarṇavarṇa (“Golden Wall”), which has eighty thousand
caves in which eighty thousand royal elephants reside. These elephants
have white hides and multicolored heads, and each has six tusks and gold
fillings in their teeth.
Beyond this mountain is another mountain, called Himalaya (“Snow
Mountain”), five hundred yojana s in length and breadth, which plunges
into the sea along its eastern and western edges to a depth of five hundred
yojana s. Within the interior of this snowy mountain is a treasure mountain
twenty yojana s high, as well as [several] hills that are a hundred yojana s
high. On top of the snowy mountain is a lake known as Anavatapta, with
a length and breadth of fifty yojana s, and spotlessly clean, transparent,

and pure water. Leading into [the lake] are stone terraces made from the  
seven kinds of treasure, protected by sevenfold walls embellished with  
seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees, all shining  
with the variegated colors of the seven kinds of treasure.  
The railings are multihued: the golden railing is decorated with silver  
ropes, the silver railing with golden ropes, the quartz railing with lapis  
ropes, the lapis railing with quartz ropes, the ruby railing with agate ropes,  
the agate railing with ropes of rubies, and the emerald railing with ropes  
of various precious stones. Ornamental nets are draped over these railings;  
the golden net has a pendant silver bell, the silver net has a golden bell,  
the lapis net has a quartz bell, the quartz net has a lapis bell, the ruby net  
has an agate bell, the agate net has a ruby bell, and the net made of emeralds  
has a bell inlaid with various precious stones.  
The golden _tāla_ tree has golden roots and branches and silver leaves,  
flowers, and fruit. The silver _tāla_ tree has silver roots and branches and  
golden leaves, flowers, and fruit. The quartz tree has quartz roots and  
branches and lapis leaves, flowers, and fruit, while the lapis tree has lapis  
roots and branches and quartz leaves, flowers, and fruit. The ruby tree has  
ruby roots and branches and agate leaves, flowers, and fruit, while the  
agate tree has agate roots and branches and ruby flowers, leaves, and fruit,  
and the emerald tree has emerald roots and branches and leaves, flowers,  
and fruit made of various precious stones. Around Anavatapta Lake are  
pleasant pavilions amid bathing ponds, many kinds of flowers blooming  
in thick layers, and many different kinds of flourishing trees with distinctive  
leaves, flowers, and fruit, all filling the air with exquisite fragrance, and  
many different kinds of rare birds singing harmoniously together.  
The bottom of Anavatapta Lake is golden sand. Stairways made from  
the seven kinds of treasure enter the four sides of the lake: the golden  
stairway is lined with silver ropes, the silver stairway is lined with golden  
ropes, the lapis stairway is lined with quartz ropes, the quartz stairway is  
lined with lapis ropes, the agate stairway is lined with ruby ropes, the  
ruby stairway is lined with agate ropes, and the emerald stairway is lined  
with ropes made of various precious stones. All around the lake are [con-  
tinuous] railings; the four kinds of water lilies show their blue, yellow,  
red, and white blossoms, and their variegated colors compose the image

of a wheel, with the roots forming the center. The roots emit sap as white
as milk and sweet as honey. Again, around the lake are pleasant pavilions
set amid bathing ponds and pleasure gardens, with many kinds of flowers
blooming in thick layers, and many different kinds of trees with distinctive
leaves, flowers, and fruit.
To the east of Anavatapta Lake the Ganges River flows from the mouth
of a cow, and with its five hundred tributaries enters the eastern sea. To
the south of the lake the Indus River flows from the mouth of a lion, and
with its five hundred tributaries enters the southern sea. To the west of the
lake the Pochahe River flows from the mouth of a horse, and with its five
hundred tributaries enters the western sea. To the north of the lake the
Situohe River flows from the mouth of an elephant, and with its five hundred
tributaries enters the northern sea. In Anavatapta Palace there is a [pen-
tagonal] pavilion with five pillars, where the nāga king has always lived.
The Buddha continued:
Why is [the lake] called Anavatapta? What does this name mean? Every
nāga king in Jambudvīpa suffers from three kinds of trouble, except for
the nāga king of this lake, who alone does not suffer from any trouble.
What are the three? First, the nāga kings in the [southern] land of Jambud-
vīpa suffer from hot wind and sand that burns their skin and flesh, even
down to the bone and marrow, when it comes into contact with their bodies,
causing excruciating pain. Only the nāga king of Anavatapta Lake has
no trouble of this kind. Second, evil winds sometimes tear through the
palaces of the nāga kings, stripping away their fine clothing and exposing
their naked bodies, to their embarrassment. Only the nāga king of Ana-
vatapta Lake has no trouble of this kind. Third, the nāga kings constantly
fear the giant garuḍa ’s predatory raids on their palaces at times when they
are vulnerable; their horror at the thought of being seized and eaten by
this bird is most intense, leaving them in anguish. Only the nāga king of
Anavatapta Lake has no trouble of this kind, because garuḍa s that try to
enter the lake all perish. Hence, the lake is called Anavatapta, which in
Chinese means “absence of feverish agony.”
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:

To the right of Snow Mountain is a city called Vaiśālī, and there are seven  
dark hills north of this city. Lying north of these hills is Fragrant Mountain,  
where the sounds of music, song, and dance are always heard. There are  
two caves in that mountain; one is called Noon and the other Forenoon,  
and they have been furnished with seven heavenly treasures. [The air in  
the caves is] soft and gentle, fragrant and pure, like the touch of a heavenly  
garment. The master of music, king of all _gandharva_ musicians, accom-  
panied by an orchestra of five hundred [musicians], resides in these caves.  
To the north of the two caves is the king of _śāla_ trees, called Shanju,  
surrounded by eight thousand trees spreading out in all directions. Under  
this majestic _śāla_ tree the king of the royal elephants, also called Shanju,  
abides. His powerful body is white and he can fly through the air and go  
everywhere. [When he appears] the hairs on his ruddy head shine with  
variegated colors, and his golden teeth contrast with his six tusks. This  
[elephant] king has a retinue of eight thousand royal elephants, who reside  
in the forest of eight thousand trees.  
To the north of Shanju is a grand bathing pond called Motuoyan, fifty  
_yojana_ s long and wide, around which eight thousand smaller ponds are  
arranged in a circle. The water in the pond is spotlessly clean and cool.  
[The pond] is surrounded by stone terraces made from the seven kinds of  
treasure, with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of  
trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure. The gold railing is orna-  
mented with silver ropes, the silver railing with golden ropes, the quartz  
railing with lapis ropes, the lapis railing with quartz ropes, the ruby railing  
with agate ropes, the agate railing with ropes made of rubies, and the  
emerald railing with ropes made of various precious stones. Ornamental  
nets adorned with a variety of bells hang over the railings. The gold net  
has a pendant silver bell, the silver net has a golden bell, the lapis net has  
a quartz bell, the quartz net has a lapis bell, the ruby net has an agate bell,  
the agate net has a ruby bell, and the emerald net has a bell inlaid with  
various precious stones.  
The gold trees have golden roots and branches and silver leaves, flowers,  
and fruit. The silver tree has silver roots and branches and golden leaves,  
flowers, and fruit. The quartz tree has quartz roots and branches and lapis  
leaves, flowers, and fruit, while the lapis tree has lapis roots and branches

and quartz leaves, flowers, and fruit. The ruby tree has ruby roots and  
branches and agate leaves, flowers, and fruit, while the agate tree has  
agate roots and branches and ruby leaves, flowers, and fruit. The emerald  
tree has emerald roots and branches and leaves, flowers, and fruit made  
of various precious stones.  
At the bottom of Anavatapta Lake is golden sand. Stairways made  
from the seven kinds of treasure enter the four sides of the lake: the golden  
stairway is lined with silver ropes, the silver stairway with golden ropes,  
the lapis stairway with quartz ropes, the quartz stairway with lapis ropes,  
the agate stairway with ruby ropes, the ruby stairway with agate ropes,  
and the emerald stairway with ropes made of various precious stones. All  
around the lake are [continuous] railings; the four kinds of water lilies  
show their blue, yellow, red, and white blossoms, and their variegated  
colors compose the image of a wheel, with the roots forming the center.  
The roots emit sap as white as milk and sweet as honey. Again, around  
the lake are pleasant pavilions set amid bathing ponds and pleasure gardens  
with many kinds of flowers blooming in thick layers and cool shade pro-  
vided by many different kinds of trees with distinctive leaves, flowers,  
and fruit, and innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together.  
The royal elephant king Shanju, wishing to visit the great pond to bathe  
and play, extends that wish to his retinue, and eight thousand elephants  
in turn become aware of the thought, “King Shanju is thinking of us; we  
need to see him.” So the eight thousand elephants array themselves before  
their king. The elephant king then walks to Motuoyan Pond accompanied  
by his retinue of eight thousand. Some hold a canopy over the king to  
shade him, while others cool him with a fan, and still others play music  
to lead the procession. At the pond, the elephant king Shanju regally enters  
the water and, together with his company, enjoys a performance of royal  
music and dance. Some of the elephants wash his trunk while others  
cleanse his mouth, head, tusks, ears, stomach, back, tail, and feet. Some  
go off to pluck the roots of flowers, which they wash and offer to the king  
to eat. Others gather flowers and scatter them over the king.  
The elephant king Shanju, having bathed and fed and enjoyed the royal  
entertainment with his company, now leaves the water and stands on the  
bank, facing the tree called Shanju, his abode. All eight thousand elephants  

enter the pond to bathe, feed, and frolic with each other before lining up
to follow their king. The elephant king, accompanied by attendants before
and after, then returns to the tree called Shanju. As before, some elephants
hold a canopy to shade the king, while others cool him with a fan, and still
others play music to lead the procession. Returning to the tree, the elephant
king now sits, lies down, or walks about as he pleases. The other elephants
retire to their respective trees to sit, lie down, or walk about as they please.
Among those eight thousand trees, some are as large as eight xin,^24
while others measure ten to fifteen xin, but only the śāla tree of the elephant
king Shanju is as large as sixteen xin. When the leaves of the eight thousand
śāla trees fall to the ground, the wind rises and carries them outside the
forest. And when the eight thousand elephants urinate and excrete, ghostly
yakṣa s carry those deposits out of the forest.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
The elephant king Shanju has indeed gained meritorious blessings to this
extraordinary degree. Even though it is only an animal, even an elephant is
capable of receiving such uncommon rewards because of its [previous] merit.

#### Article 2: The Land

#### of Uttarakuru

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

In the land of Uttarakuru there are many mountains, and many pleasure
gardens with pavilions and bathing ponds alongside. Flowers bloom in
profusion and the trees and plants, thriving in the cool, clean air, produce
abundant fruit and flowers. Among them are many varieties of birds,
singing harmoniously together. Many streams flow gently through these
mountains without strong currents, and myriad flowers hang down from
the bank to the water’s surface as the river flows calmly and expansively.
Trees shade both banks of the stream, their branches heavy with fruit and
flowers. The ground is covered with soft grass, moistened by dew so that
[the blades of grass] all turn to the right with the softness of a heavenly
garment, with a sheen like the colors of a hummingbird and a delicate
scent like jasmine ( poshijia ). When you step on the grass your foot sinks

down about four inches and the grass springs back after you lift your foot.
Yet the ground has no unseen bumps or depressions and is as level as the
surface of the palm of your hand.
O bhikṣu s, on each of the four sides of the land of Uttarakuru there is
an Anavatapta Lake. Each lake is one hundred yojana s long and wide,
with spotlessly clean, transparent, and pure water. The lakes are surrounded
by stone terraces made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with
innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together. The features of
these lakes are indeed no different than those of the grand pond of
Motuoyan. From the four lakes issue four rivers, each ten yojana s in
breadth, flowing gently with no turbulence. Myriad flowers reach down
from the bank as the river flows by, calmly and expansively. Both the
riverbanks are shaded by trees, their branches heavy with fruit and flowers.
The ground is covered with soft grass, moistened by dew so that [the
blades] all turn to the right with the softness of a heavenly garment, with
a sheen like the colors of a hummingbird and a delicate scent like jasmine.
When you step on the grass your foot sinks down about four inches yet
the grass springs back when you removes your foot. Yet the ground has
no unseen bumps or depressions and is as level as the surface of the palm
of your hand.
There are no mountain torrents or ditches, no pits or dark holes, no
thorny plants or unexpected tree stumps or trunks, no insects such as mos-
quitoes or gadflies, no water lizards or snakes, no bees or grubs, no dan-
gerous beasts such as leopards or tigers. The ground is naturally fertile,
pure, and without any pebbles or stones. The negative and positive forces
[of nature] are harmonized, and so too are the four seasons gentle and
peaceful, neither [too] cold or hot. The land is free of storms and various
misfortunes and is everywhere fertile and abundant, without filth or defile-
ment or even a single clod of flying dirt, as if the ground had been brushed
with the finest oil.
In the absence of winter and summer many varieties of grasses grow
year around. Trees and plants grow luxuriously and produce abundant
fruit and flowers. The ground is covered with soft grass, moistened by
dew so that [the blades] all turn to the right with the softness of a heavenly
garment, with a sheen like the colors of a hummingbird and a delicate

scent like jasmine. When you step on the grass your foot sinks down about  
four inches yet the grass springs back when you lift your foot. Yet the  
ground has no unseen bumps or depressions and is as level as the surface  
of the palm of your hand.  
In that land rice grows naturally, without husks or any need for seeding.  
It appears like piles of tiny white flowers and is permeated with all good  
flavors, like the food of the Trāyastriṃśa gods. In that land there is a cook-  
ing pot that emits heavenly fragrance and a magical gem ( _maṇi_ ), known  
as _yanguang,_ that will heat any pot placed over it and automatically stop  
when the meal is cooked, without need for a fire or for any handling. In  
that land there is also a kind of tree, known as _qugong,_ with such thickly  
layered foliage that no rain can leak through, and the people of that land  
know to take shelter under it overnight.  
There are trees as tall as seventy _li,_^25 with abundant flowers and fruit  
and a beguiling scent. As each fruit ripens its skin opens by itself, emitting  
[an exquisite] fragrance. Some trees are as high as sixty, fifty, or forty _li,_  
and even the smallest of them reaches five _li._ All the trees produce abundant  
flowers and fruit, and when the fruit ripens the skin opens by itself, emitting  
[an exquisite] fragrance.  
There are trees as tall as seventy _li,_ with abundant flowers and fruit  
that provide cloth. As each fruit ripens its skin opens by itself, discharging  
different kinds of cloth. Some of the trees are as high as sixty, fifty, or  
forty _li,_ and even the smallest of them reaches five _li._ All the trees produce  
abundant flowers and fruit, and when their fruit ripens the skin opens by  
itself, discharging different kinds of cloth.  
There are trees as tall as seventy _li,_ with abundant flowers and fruit  
that provide curios. As each fruit ripens its skin opens by itself, discharging  
a variety of ornaments. Some of the trees are as high as sixty, fifty, or  
forty _li,_ and even the smallest of them reaches five _li._ All the trees produce  
abundant flowers and fruit, and when the fruit ripens the skin opens by  
itself, discharging a variety of ornaments.  
There are trees as tall as seventy _li,_ with abundant flowers and fruit that  
provide flower garlands. As each fruit ripens its skin opens by itself, dis-  
charging various garlands. Some of the trees are as high as sixty, fifty, or  
forty _li,_ and even the smallest of them reaches five _li._ All the trees produce

abundant flowers and fruit, and when the fruit ripens the skin opens by
itself, discharging a variety of flower garlands.
There are trees as tall as seventy li, with abundant flowers and fruit
that provide a variety of vessels. As each fruit ripens its skin opens by
itself, discharging different kinds of vessels. Some of the trees are as high
as sixty, fifty, or forty li, and even the smallest of them reaches five li. All
the trees produce abundant flowers and fruit, and when the fruit ripens
the skin opens by itself, discharging various vessels.
There are trees as tall as seventy li, with abundant flowers and fruit
that produce a variety of nuts. As each fruit ripens the skin opens by itself,
discharging different kinds of nuts. Some of the trees are as high as sixty,
fifty, or forty li, and even the smallest of them reaches five li. All the trees
produce abundant flowers and fruits, and when the fruit ripens the skin
opens by itself, discharging a variety of nuts.
There are trees, as tall as seventy li, with abundant flowers and fruit that
provide musical instruments. As each fruit ripens its skin opens by itself,
discharging a variety of musical instruments. Some of the trees are as high
as sixty, fifty, or forty li, and even the smallest of them reaches five li. All
the trees produce abundant flowers and fruit, and when the fruit ripens the
skin opens by itself, discharging a variety of musical instruments.
In that land there is a lake known as Sudarśana, one hundred yojana s
long and wide, with spotlessly clean, transparent, and pure water. The
lake is surrounded by stone terraces made from the seven kinds of treasure,
with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees, and
so on, with innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together. At the
north end of the lake there is a tree known as Mango ( anmoluo ), with a
circumference of seven li and a height of one hundred li. Its branches and
leaves spread out in all directions to a distance of fifty li.
From the eastern side of the lake the Shandao River flows out, expand-
ing to a width of one yojana. The river flows ever gently, showing no sign
of turbulence. Myriad flowers hang down from the bank to touch the
river’s surface as the water flows by, calmly and expansively. Both river-
banks are shaded by trees, their branches heavy with fruit and flowers.
The ground is covered with soft grass, moistened by dew so that [the
blades] all turn to the right with the softness of a heavenly garment, and

a sheen like the colors of a hummingbird and a delicate scent like jasmine.  
When you step on the grass your foot sinks down about four inches yet  
the grass springs back when you lift your foot. Yet the ground has no  
unseen bumps or depressions and is as level as the surface of the palm of  
your hand.  
Richly decorated boats ply the river. When the people of that land wish  
to bathe and play in the water they leave their clothing on the bank, board  
a boat, and, after bathing and playing midstream, they cross the river [to  
the other side] and don any pieces of clothing they may come upon without  
bothering to retrieve [their own clothes that they had left behind]. When  
they [first] come to the trees with a beguiling scent, they bend over to col-  
lect whatever scented powder they like and spread it over their bodies.  
Next, on coming to the trees that provide cloth, they bend over to pick up  
whatever kinds of cloth they like and wind it around their bodies freely.  
Next, reaching the trees that provide curios, they bend over to pick up the  
curios they like and display them on their bodies. Next, on coming to the  
trees that provide flower garlands, they bend over to pick up whatever  
garlands they like and drape them around their heads. Next, on coming  
to the trees that provide vessels, they bend over to pick up whatever vessels  
they like [and use them] to carry [things]. Next, on coming to the trees  
that produce nuts, they bend over to pick up different kinds of nuts, both  
to savor their taste or to extract their oils. Next, on coming to the trees  
that provide musical instruments, they bend over to pick up whatever  
instruments they like to play, tune them accordingly, and proceed to play.  
Singing in good voice with musical accompaniment, they go on to find a  
grove where they can stop to enjoy their amusements for a day or two, or  
even up to a week. After all, when they leave the grove they have no par-  
ticular home to which to return.  
From the southern side of Sudarśana Lake the Miaoti River flows out,  
from the western side the Miaomi River flows out, and from the northern  
side the Guangying River flows out, just as always. To the east of the lake  
is a pleasure garden, also called Sudarśana, one hundred _yojana_ s long and  
wide, around which are seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven  
lines of trees. The mix of colors it presents is due to the seven kinds of  
treasure used to build it.

On the four sides of this garden are large gates ringed by seven railings,
all made from the seven kinds of treasure. Inside, the garden is immacu-
late—there are no hidden thorns among the vines and the ground is even,
with no bumps, holes, or pitfalls. There are no mosquitoes or gadflies,
flies, fleas, or lice; no water lizards, snakes, bees, grubs, or threatening
beasts such as leopards and tigers.
The ground is fresh, naturally fertile, and without any stones or pebbles.
Both the malignant and beneficial influences [of nature] are in harmony,
and so are the four seasons. The land is gentle and peaceful, not [too] hot
or cold, always free of any kind of trouble, and fruitful and abundant without
any sign of filth or defilement, as if the ground had been covered with balm.
In the absence of winter or summer grasses grow year round, and plants
and trees spread profusely, producing lavish quantities of flowers and fruit.
The ground is covered with a carpet of soft grass, moistened by dew so that
[the blades] all turn to the right with the softness of a heavenly garment, and
a sheen like the colors of a hummingbird and a delicate scent like jasmine.
When you step on the grass your foot sinks about down four inches but the
grass springs back when you lift your foot. Yet the ground has no unseen
bumps or depressions and is as level as the surface of the palm of your hand.
In that land rice grows naturally without husks or any need for seeding.
It appears like piles of tiny white flowers and is permeated with all good
flavors, like the food of the Trāyastriṃśa gods. In that land there is a cook-
ing pot that emits heavenly fragrances, and a magical gem, known as yen-
guang, that will heat any pot placed over it and automatically stop when
the meal is cooked, without need for a fire or any handling. In that land
there is also a kind of tree, known as qugong, with thickly layered foliage
that no rainfall can leak through, and the people of that land know to take
shelter under it overnight.
There is also a tree as tall as seventy li, with abundant flowers and fruit
and a beguiling scent. As each fruit ripens its skin opens by itself, emitting
[an exquisite] fragrance. Some of these trees are as high as sixty, fifty, or
forty li, and even the smallest of them reaches five li. All the trees produce
abundant flowers and fruit, and when the fruit ripens the skin opens by
itself, emitting an [exquisite] fragrance. And so on, as already described,
including a kind of tree that provides musical instruments.

The people of that land come to the garden and enjoy amusements for  
a day or two, or even up to a week. There is no guard in the Sudarśana  
pleasure garden. Those who come to the garden freely enjoy their time  
there and then depart. South of Sudarśana Lake is a garden called Mahā-  
sudarśana, to the west of the lake is a garden called Yuluo, and to the north  
of the lake is a garden called Denghua. All of these are similar to what  
has already been described.  
In that land, during the middle and late watches of the night, or when-  
ever required, the _nāga_ king causes fresh clouds to waft up and permeate  
the sky, with rainshowers falling like drops of nectar to the herds of cattle  
below. The liquid itself is rich, blending eight distinct tastes. Just as a gar-  
land maker scatters water over his flowers to keep them fresh and prevent  
withering, the water does not linger on the ground in puddles, so muddy  
roads cannot form. When it stays clear and there is no rain during the  
night, a bright moon traverses the sky, causing cool breezes to rise from  
the ocean. Clean and pure, each breeze gently caresses one’s body, creating  
a most delightful sensation.  
The land is well populated and prosperous. When people wish to cook  
a meal they put some rice in a pot and place a _yanguong_ gem beneath it.  
The heat rising from the gem automatically stops when the rice is cooked.  
Anyone who comes along, even if the pot’s owner is absent, can share  
the meal since the food is never used up. When the owner is present, those  
who also wish to partake are welcome to do so. The cooked rice is as  
appealing as a cluster of tiny white flowers, permeated with all good  
flavors, like the food of the Trāyastriṃśa gods. All those who eat this food  
remain free from illness, never succumb to exhaustion, and are very vig-  
orous, with a gentle and pleasant appearance.  
Again, the residents of that land all look the same in both bodily and  
facial features, resembling young people of twenty years of age in Jambud-  
vīpa. Their teeth are even, without any gaps, and clean and white. Their  
hair is dark blue, not discolored by dirt or filth, and they wear their hair  
shoulder-length, neither long nor short. If a man of that land desires a  
woman, he gazes intently at her but does not accost her. If the woman  
then follows him to a nearby grove or garden, the trees will refuse to give  
them shelter and shade if the couple’s bloodlines are too closely related.

Consequently, the two would then [separate] and go their respective ways.
If the couple is not too closely related so that an intimate relationship would
be incestuous, however, the tree branches shield them from public sight.
After enjoying conjugal union for a day or two, or as long as a week, the
two will depart and go their respective ways. If the woman becomes preg-
nant the baby will be delivered within seven or eight days. Regardless of
whether the baby is male or female, the mother will leave the child at a
major crossroads and depart. People passing by will clean out the baby’s
mouth with a finger and give it sweet milk, and after seven days the child
will have matured to adulthood. A male will join the group of men, and a
female will join the group of women. Even when someone dies there are
no cries of lamentation. The dead body is ornamented and placed at a major
crossroads, and after doing this the people go away. Then a bird called
youweichanjia collects the corpse and transports it to another region. Also,
when the people of that land relieve themselves, the ground automatically
opens to receive it, and closes over it again when they have finished. The
residents of that land do not remember others with affection, nor do they
save anything [for an emergency, or the like]. Their life span is always pre-
determined, and when they die they are invariably reborn in a heaven.
Why do the people of that land have a predetermined life span? It is
because their birth in the land of Uttarakuru is the result of having practiced
the ten norms of moral conduct. This practice gave them all life spans of
exactly a thousand years, and every member of the society is equal in that
respect. Now, someone who murders another human being will fall into
an evil course of life, while those who have refrained from committing
murder will be born into a good course of life. In a similar manner, those
who commit theft or sexual abuse, or who speak harshly or deceptively,
or speak falsehoods, and those who indulge in frivolous sycophancy while
harboring wrong views, a covetous frame of mind, and malicious intent
are bound to fall into an evil course of life [after death]. On the other hand,
those who have been born into a good course of life who have refrained
from murder, theft, and sexual abuse, and from speaking harshly and
deceptively, or speaking falsehoods, and have not indulged in frivolous
sycophancy while harboring wrong views, a covetous frame of mind, and
malicious intent, are bound to be born in the land of Uttarakuru after the

dissolution of their bodies at the end of life, and they are predetermined
to live exactly one thousand years. Because of this, the people of that land
all have equal life spans.
Again, one who is covetous, stingy, and does not give alms will fall
into an evil course of life after death. Those who are open-minded and
free from parsimony, and who offer alms liberally, will enter a good course
of life after death. Those who liberally give alms to śramaṇa s and brāh-
maṇa s and engage in charitable acts on behalf of the destitute, beggar
children, and the ill, who are covered with sores or who have succumbed
to various difficulties, providing them with clothing, food, transportation,
flower garlands, incense, and a couch, blanket, or shelter, and who also
offer oil lamps and candles and build commemorative towers (stupas)
and shrines, are all bound to be born in the land of Uttarakuru after the
dissolution of their bodies at the end of life, and they are predetermined
to live a thousand years, no more and no less. Hence the people of that
land are totally equal in their life spans.
Why is that land called Uttarakuru? It is because the people there are
superior [to all other human beings]. While they do not receive the ten
norms as their vow of precepts, their behavior is naturally in accord with
these ten normative standards, and thus they are certain to be born in a
heavenly domain after the dissolution of their bodies at the end of life.
Because of this, the people in that land are called Uttarakuru. What is the
meaning of this term? Of the three continents [besides Jambudvīpa], this
land surpasses the others and so is called Uttarā, which in the Indian lan-
guage means “highest.”

#### Article 3: The Universal Ruler

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

The universal ruler ( cakravartin ) who turns the sacred wheel in this world
is endowed with four supernormal blessings and seven treasures. What
does it mean to say that the universal ruler is endowed with seven treasures?
The seven treasures are (1) the golden wheel, (2) the white elephant, (3)
the dark blue horse, (4) the divine gem, (5) the jadelike queen, (6) the
[gentleman] householder, and (7) the military commander.

How did the universal ruler come to use his first treasure, the golden
wheel? When the cakravartin first appeared in the land of Jambudvīpa
he was from the kṣatriya class and his head was anointed with sacred
water for the throne. He bathed in scented water on the full moon day,
the fifteenth of the month, and ascended to the top of a pavilion surrounded
by the palace ladies. The sacred wheel, with a thousand spokes of rich
color and splendor, then appeared of its own accord before the king. It
was built by a heavenly master and did not belong to the human world.
Made of genuine gold, it had a diameter of thirty-two feet.
Seeing it, the king quietly thought to himself, “I once heard from my
virtuous elders the following words: ‘When a king of the kṣatriya class,
anointed on his head for the throne, takes a scented bath on the full moon
day, the fifteenth of the month, and ascends to the top of the pavilion sur-
rounded by the palace ladies, then at that moment the golden wheel will
appear before him of its own accord. The wheel has a thousand spokes
of rich color and splendor. It was built by a heavenly master and does not
belong to this world. It is made of genuine gold and has a diameter of
thirty-two feet. Thereupon, the king is called the cakravartin, ‘one who
turns the sacred wheel.’ Now I see this wheel before me, but who knows
if it really works. I should now test this golden treasure wheel.”
The cakravartin called the four divisions of the army to assemble. He
faced the golden wheel directly and, rearranging his garment to expose
his right shoulder and kneeling with his right knee on the ground, he
rubbed the wheel with his right hand and said to it, “Let the wheel turn
itself toward the east, turning as it should, without losing regularity.” The
wheel at once began to roll toward the east. Leading the four divisions of
his army, King Mahāsudarśana followed it. As the golden wheel rolled
forward the four gods were in charge of guiding it. Wherever the wheel
stopped, the king stopped his chariot.
At that time, having seen the great king approaching, the rulers of the
small countries in the eastern regions prepared a golden bowl filled with
silver grains and a silver bowl filled with golden grains. [When the king
arrived] they stepped forward to approach him and, with heads bowed,
said, “Welcome, great king. The eastern countries are blessed with an
abundance of harvests and produce, the people are prosperous, the nature

of the populace is friendly and harmonious, and all are filial to their parents  
and loyal to their rulers. O holy ruler, Your Majesty is recommended to  
govern these lands through offices established here. We shall closely attend  
Your Majesty and will execute your commands as you wish, sir.”  
At that time, the _cakravartin_ replied to the rulers of the small countries,  
“Enough, dear wise kings, your offerings are already appreciated by me.  
Your kingships rule these countries on the basis of the right Dharma, so that  
neither injustice nor wrong action can take place in your countries. May  
your kingships adhere to the vow of not taking life, and do not permit any  
of your subjects to commit murder, theft, or sexual abuse, or speak harshly  
or deceptively, or to speak falsehoods, or to indulge in frivolous sycophancy  
while holding wrong views, a covetous frame of mind, and malicious intent.  
I say that these [ten] principles encapsulate my governance.”  
After listening to his exhortation, the kings of the small countries  
accompanied him on his inspection tour until they reached the eastern  
ocean. Next, the great king proceeded toward the south, then to the west,  
and then to the north; in whatever direction the wheel rolled the [king and  
his army] followed. The kings of the small countries in these regions all  
abnegated their dominions for the sake of the great ruler, just as the eastern  
rulers had done.  
The land of Jambudvīpa, renowned for its fertile soil, produced many  
precious things. In a vast expanse of forest where the waters ran pure and  
clean, the golden wheel delineated the boundaries of a territory measuring  
twelve _yojana_ s from east to west and ten _yojana_ s from north to south.  
During the night heavenly gods built a city protected by seven railings,  
seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees, all adorned with the seven  
kinds of treasure, and so on, with innumerable rare birds singing harmo-  
niously together. Having measured the city structure, the golden wheel  
marked out an area within it that measured four _yojana_ s from east to west  
and two _yojana_ s from north to south. Once again, during the night heavenly  
gods built a royal palace with sevenfold walls embellished with the seven  
kinds of treasure and so on, with innumerable rare birds singing harmo-  
niously together, just as before. When the palace was completed the golden  
wheel hovered in midair above the palace gate, poised [in readiness] but  
not turning. Rejoicing, leaping and dancing, the _cakravartin_ exclaimed,

“This treasure, the golden wheel, is indeed a blessing! Now I am truly
the one who turns the sacred wheel.” This is called the realization of the
first treasure, the golden wheel.
How did the king come to use his second treasure, the white elephant?
Early in the morning when the cakravartin was seated in the main hall of
the palace, the white elephant suddenly appeared before him of its own
accord. The color of its hair was pure white, the seven parts of its body (four
feet, two shoulders, and neck) were well developed and proportional, and
it could fly in midair. It had variegated colors on its neck and its six delicate
tusks were studded with pieces of real gold. Seeing the elephant, the king
thought to himself, “This elephant is said to be wise and good-natured. If
it is well trained it can serve me as a mount for riding.” He immediately set
about to see if the elephant could be trained and found that it was capable
for all training. Wishing to take his first morning ride, the cakravartin
mounted the elephant, went out of the capital, made a round of all four
oceans, and had already returned to the palace by breakfast time. Rejoicing,
leaping and dancing, the cakravartin exclaimed, “This white elephant is
indeed a blessing! Now I am truly the one who turns the sacred wheel.”
This is called the realization of the second treasure, the white elephant.
How did the king come to use his third treasure, the dark blue horse?
Early in the morning when the cakravartin was seated in the main hall of
the palace, the horse suddenly appeared before him of its own accord. Its
body was dark blue but its long mane and tail were red. Its head and neck
were like those of an elephant, and it could fly in midair. Seeing this treas-
ure of a horse, the king thought to himself, “This horse is said to be wise
and good-natured. If it is well trained it can serve as my steed.” He imme-
diately set about to see if the horse could be trained and found that it was
capable for all training. Then, wishing to take his first morning ride, the
king mounted the horse, went out of the capital, made a round of all four
oceans, and returned to the palace by breakfast time. Rejoicing, leaping
and dancing, the cakravartin exclaimed, “This dark blue horse is indeed
a blessing! Now I am truly the one who turns the sacred wheel.” This is
called the realization of the third treasure, the dark blue horse.
How did the king come to use his fourth treasure, the divine gem?
Early in the morning when the cakravartin was seated in the main hall of

the palace, the divine gem suddenly appeared before him of its own accord.  
Its quality and color were clear and transparent, and it was spotless. Seeing  
this divine gem, the king thought to himself, “This gem is very appealing  
and mysterious at the same time; it is said to be able to illuminate an area  
as wide as this entire palace compound when a light is shined upon it.”  
Then, wishing to test the gem himself, the _cakravartin_ immediately mustered  
the four divisions of his army and placed the gem on top of a flagpole. As  
he carried the flagpole out of the city in the darkness, the gem emitted a  
ray of light that illuminated the entire army as if it were daylight. Rejoicing,  
leaping and dancing, the _cakravartin_ exclaimed, “This treasure of a gem  
is indeed a blessing! Now I am truly the one who turns the sacred wheel.”  
This is called the realization of the fourth treasure, the divine gem.  
How did the king come to be served by his fifth treasure, the jadelike  
queen? When the queenly treasure suddenly appeared before the king, he  
saw that she was beautiful, with a fine complexion, and she was neither  
too tall nor too short, neither stout nor thin, her skin was neither too light  
nor too dark, her features neither hard nor soft, and her body was able to  
remain warm in winter and cool in summer. A sandalwood scent emerged  
from the roots of her hair, enveloping her body, and the fragrance of a  
blue lotus emanated from her mouth. Her words and manner of speech  
were invariably gentle and her demeanor was calm; she never failed to  
awake before the king or to stay awake until he fell asleep. The king had  
realized purity [by extinguishing defilements] so he was totally free from  
attachment and did not obsess about her in his mind even for a moment;  
how much less would he have approached her physically [as an object of  
sexual desire]. Rejoicing, leaping and dancing, the _cakravartin_ exclaimed,  
“This treasure, the jadelike queen, is indeed a blessing! Now I am truly  
the one who turns the sacred wheel.” This is called the realization of the  
fifth treasure, the jadelike queen.  
How did the king come to be assisted by his sixth treasure, the gentle-  
man householder? When the householder suddenly appeared before the  
king of his own accord, the royal storehouses were automatically filled  
with immeasurable riches and treasures. This person had been endowed  
with special vision due to his past merit, namely, the ability to see any  
treasure buried underground, no matter to whom it belonged. He did not

take the treasure owned by some, while turning over to the king’s treasury
any treasure that had no owner. The householder came to the king and
said, “O great king, please do not think about paying me any stipend. I
am able to manage by myself, sir.” The king decided to test the well-bred
treasurer and arranged an excursion on a pleasure boat. While aboard, the
king said to the gentleman householder, “I am in need of some pieces of
gold. Provide them at once.” The treasurer replied, “O great king, give
me some time to go ashore.” Pressing him further, the king said, “I cannot
stop this boat. I need the golden treasure right away.” Hearing the king’s
urgent order, the householder knelt and dipped his right hand into the
water. A succession of urns filled with treasure arose from the water, fol-
lowing his hand upward just like insects clinging to tree branches. Then
the other treasurers all joined in, dipping their hands into the water to
draw up an equal amount of immeasurable riches, so that the boat was
soon filled with treasure. The gentleman householder then asked, “Your
Majesty needed some gold pieces before; how much more will you need,
sir?” The cakravartin replied, “That is enough. I do not need any more.
I only wished to test your ability. Your service is much appreciated.” On
hearing the king’s words, the householder returned all the treasure to the
water. Then, rejoicing, leaping and dancing, the cakravartin exclaimed,
“This treasure of a householder is indeed a blessing! Now I am truly the
one who turns the sacred wheel.” This is called the realization of the sixth
treasure, the householder.
How did the king come to be assisted by his seventh treasure, the mil-
itary commander? When the brilliant, decisive military commander, whose
expertise in strategy was equaled by his valor and strength, suddenly
appeared before the king, he said, “Great king, may Your Majesty be free
from worry. When you wish to attack any country, sire, I shall willingly
accomplish it.” The cakravartin decided to test him at once and mustered
the four divisions of the army. He said to his general, “Make sure the
entire army is ready for battle. Those who have not come out should
assemble; those who have already come can be dismissed. Those who are
untrained should prepare themselves for battle; those who are ready can
be dismissed. Let those who are here on duty return home, and let those
who are already at home remain there.” Upon hearing the king’s words,

the military commander promptly assembled those who had not come forth  
and released those who had already assembled; he began to train those  
who were ill prepared and released those who were already qualified. Those  
who were on duty he let return home, and those who had already gone  
home were allowed to remain there. Then, rejoicing, leaping and dancing,  
the _cakravartin_ exclaimed, “This treasure, my military commander, is a  
blessing! Now I am now truly the one who turns the sacred wheel.”  
What are the four blessings that pertain to the universal ruler? First,  
as the universal king, he has longevity and will never meet with an early  
death; in this, no one can match the king. Second, he has a strong physical  
body and never contracts illness; in this, no one can match the king. Third,  
he has a most handsome appearance; in this, no one can match the king.  
Fourth, his storehouses are filled with treasure; in this, no one can match  
the king. The foregoing are the seven treasures and four blessings that  
pertain to the universal ruler.  
After a time, the _cakravartin_ had his carriage prepared for a visit to the  
royal park grove. He said to his charioteer, “Proceed deliberately while  
driving the carriage. I wish to ascertain whether the kingdom is safe and  
our citizens are at ease.” At the same time, those who saw the king asked  
his attendant, “Please drive slowly, for we wish to see the face of the holy  
ruler.” The great _cakravartin_ was as attentive to the well-being of his people  
as to their material needs, just as a father is concerned for his children, and  
the people felt affection toward the king as if he were their father. They  
presented all sorts of rare items to the king, saying, “May Your Majesty  
accept this” and “May this be of use to Your Majesty.” The king would  
always reply, “Bring me no more precious items, my dear subjects. I have  
my own treasures. You should keep these things for yourselves.”  
When the _cakravartin_ is in command of the land of Jambudvīpa, the  
terrain is even, having neither thorny plants nor pits or ditches, nor any  
bumpy protrusions at all. There are no poisonous creatures such as mos-  
quitoes, gadflies, bees, grubs, flies, fleas, snakes, or water lizards. Sand  
and rocks, forming inscriptions, automatically sink into the ground, while  
gold, silver, and precious gems rise to the surface. The four seasons are  
harmonized into a gentle calm state that is neither hot nor cold. The soil  
is soft and malleable, with no filth or defilement. As if bathed in oil, it is

clean and pure, with a rich luster and no pollution at all. The earth [here]
will be the same when the cakravartin rules this world. The springwater
that flows out of the ground is clean and pure and will never dry up, pro-
ducing fields of soft grass that stay green throughout the year, summer
and winter.
Plants and trees grow profusely, producing lavish quantities of flowers
and fruits. The ground is covered with a carpet of grass, moistened by
dew so that [the blades] all turn to the right with the softness of a heavenly
garment, and a sheen like the colors of a hummingbird and a delicate scent
like jasmine. When you step on it your foot sinks down about four inches
and yet the grass springs back when you lift your foot. Rice grows naturally
without husks and is permeated with all good flavors. There are trees with
abundant flowers and fruit that produce a beguiling scent. As each fruit
ripens its skin opens by itself, emitting [an exquisite] fragrance. There
are trees with abundant flowers and fruit that provide cloth; as each fruit
ripens its skin opens by itself, discharging different kinds of cloth. There
are trees with abundant flowers and fruit that provide ornaments; as each
fruit ripens its skin opens by itself, discharging a variety of curios. There
are trees with abundant flowers and fruit that provide flower garlands; as
each fruit ripens its skin opens by itself, discharging various flower gar-
lands. There are trees with abundant flowers and fruit that provide a variety
of vessels; as each fruit ripens its skin opens by itself, discharging different
kinds of vessels. There are trees with abundant flowers and fruit that pro-
duce a variety of nuts; as each fruit ripens its skin opens by itself, dis-
charging different kinds of nuts. There are trees with abundant flowers
and fruit that provide musical instruments; as each fruit ripens its skin
opens by itself, discharging various musical instruments.
When the cakravartin rules the world, the nāga king of Anavatapta
Lake causes heavy clouds to rise and permeate the sky after midnight,
and rainshowers to fall to the cattle being herded below. The abundant
rainwater, blending eight distinct tastes, falls everywhere. And just as a
garland maker scatters water over his flowers to keep them fresh without
withering, the copious rain causes the grasses and trees to grow luxuriantly,
without any standing water to form puddles or muddy roads. When it
stays clear [without any rain during the night], a bright moon traverses

the sky, causing cool breezes to rise from the ocean. Clean and pure, each  
breeze gently caresses one’s body, creating a most delightful sensation.  
When the _cakravartin_ rules the world, the land of Jambudvīpa is blessed  
with an abundant harvest of every crop (lit., “five kinds of grain”), the  
people enjoy growth and prosperity, with universal affluence and wealth  
without deficiency. So long as the _cakravartin_ governs justly there is never  
a cause of grievance. When the king himself adheres to the ten norms of  
moral conduct, his subjects will also cherish right views and uphold the  
ten normative standards. And when, after a long time, the king finally suc-  
cumbs to illness and reaches the end of life, like a man who has enjoyed  
his food perhaps a little more than necessary, making it a little less suited  
to his body, he passes away and is reborn in Brahmā Heaven.  
Thereupon, the treasured [jadelike] queen, the [gentleman] householder,  
and the military commander lead all the people of the land in the _cakra-  
vartin_ ’s funeral rite, conducted with music and dance. They cleanse the  
king’s body with warm scented water, cover it with [new] cotton cloth,  
and wrap it in a shroud as long as five hundred pairs of garments. Then  
they put the body into a golden coffin, pour sesame oil over it, and seal  
the coffin inside an iron vault, which is enclosed within a sandalwood  
vault, then covered with incense and cremated. [After retrieving the ashes,]  
the people erect a commemorative tower, built out of the seven treasures,  
at each major crossroads, filling an area measuring one _yojana_ long and  
wide with the variegated colors of the seven kinds of treasure. On each  
of the tower’s four sides is a single gate protected by a barrier made from  
the seven kinds of treasure, and from each side an open space extends as  
far as five _yojana_ s in length and breadth. The tower walls are sevenfold,  
with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees.  
The golden wall is endowed with silver gates, the silver wall with  
golden gates, the quartz wall with lapis gates, the lapis wall with quartz  
gates, the ruby wall with agate gates, the agate wall with ruby gates, and  
the emerald wall with gates decorated with many kinds of precious stones.  
The railings are similarly decorated: the golden railing is hung with ropes  
made of silver, the silver railing with ropes made of gold, the quartz railing  
with ropes made of lapis, the lapis railing with ropes made of quartz, the  
ruby railing with ropes made of agate, the agate railing with ropes made

of rubies, and the emerald railing with a variety of precious stones. Over
these railings decorative nets, on which various ornaments are attached,
are suspended. From the golden net hangs a silver bell; from the silver
net hangs a golden bell; from the lapis net hangs a quartz bell; from the
quartz net hangs a lapis bell; from the ruby net hangs an agate bell; from
the agate net hangs a ruby bell; and from the emerald net hangs a bell
inlaid with a variety of precious stones.
The golden trees have silver flowers and fruit. The silver trees have
golden flowers and fruit. The quartz trees have lapis flowers and leaves,
while the lapis trees have quartz flowers and leaves. The ruby trees have
agate flowers and leaves, while the agate trees have flowers and leaves
made of rubies. The emerald trees have flowers and leaves made of various
precious stones.
Each of the seven walls has four gates, protected by barriers. Each
wall, topped with a pavilion and veranda, encloses a flowing spring with
a bathing pond and a pleasure garden filled with a variety of flowers and
trees laden with abundant fruit. Exquisite fragrance arises in all directions,
and a host of rare birds sing harmoniously together.
When the commemorative tower is complete the treasured [jadelike]
queen, the [gentleman] householder, and the military commander, together
with all the people of the land, pay their respects with a variety of offerings
and [simultaneously] engage in charitable acts without distinction, providing
food to those who lack food, clothing if they need clothing, and even [offer-
ing] the treasured horses and elephants of the deceased cakravartin if they
need transportation, each according to their own wish. These are the super-
normal blessings and merits ascribed to the universal cakravartin.

#### Article 4: The Hells

The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
There are eight thousand worlds surrounding the four continents, and
these eight thousand worlds are further surrounded by a great ocean.
Around this ocean is a great mountain [range] made of diamonds, and
beyond it looms a second great diamond [range]. The region between
them is dark and hidden; even heavenly gods like the sun and moon are

unable to illuminate there despite their great brightness. In that darkness  
are eight great hells, each containing sixteen smaller hells. The first great  
hell is called Conscious Recovery; the second is called Black Rope; the  
third, Compression; the fourth, Screaming; the fifth, Great Screaming;  
the sixth, Fiery Heat; the seventh, Great Fiery Heat; and the eighth,  
Unremitting Suffering. In that first hell are sixteen smaller hells, each  
measuring five hundred _yojana_ s in length and breadth. These minor hells  
are called (1) Black Sands (coal pit), (2) Boiling Excrement, (3) Five Hun-  
dred Nailings, (4) Starvation, (5) Thirst, (6) Copper Cauldron, (7) Copper  
Cauldrons, (8) Grindstone, (9) Blood and Pus, (10) Fire Tending, (11)  
River of Ashes, (12) Iron Fetters, (13) Axes and Hatchets, (14) Wolf Pack,  
(15) Bladed Trees, and (16) Cold and Icy.  
Why is the first great hell called Conscious Recovery? Iron nails grow  
on the hands of the sentient beings who fall into this hell. They use these  
long and sharp nails to injure and kill each other when they become angry.  
Tearing at one another, they strip away pieces of flesh and clean off bones,  
until they eventually collapse as if dead. But when a cool breeze passes  
over their bodies, the skin and flesh regenerates as they were before. Then  
these [hell] beings stand up and think, “I have come back to life,” and the  
others around them say, “We see that you have come back to life.” Because  
of this, the first hell is called Conscious Recovery.  
Again, since the sentient beings who fall into this hell [have a tendency  
to] irritate each other, they take up any knives or swords that may be avail-  
able and use them to injure or kill. The knives and swords pierce and slice;  
skin is cut away, flesh is sliced open, bodies are severed and fall insensate  
to the ground. Yet with cool breezes the skin and flesh regrow and the  
bodies return to life. Standing up, they think, “I have come back to life,”  
and others say, “I see that you have come back to life.” For this reason,  
the first hell is called Conscious Recovery.  
Again, when the sentient beings who fall into this hell irritate each  
other, they seize _youyingdao_ knives^26 intending to injure and kill. The  
sharp knives pierce and slice; skin is cut away, flesh is sliced open, bodies  
are severed and fall insensate to the ground. Yet with cool breezes the  
skin and flesh regrow and the bodies return to life. Standing up, they think,

“I have come back to life,” and others say, “I see that you have come back
to life.” For this reason, the first hell is called Conscious Recovery.
Again, when the sentient beings who fall into this hell irritate each
other, they take up [small] daggers with the intent to injure and kill. The
sharp daggers pierce and slice; skin is cut away, flesh is sliced open, bodies
are severed and fall insensate to the ground. Yet with cool breezes the
skin and flesh regrow and the bodies return to life. Standing up, they think,
“I have come back to life,” and others say, “I see that you have returned
to life.” For this reason, the first hell is called Conscious Recovery.
(1) Sentient beings who complete their respective periods of punishment
emerge from [Conscious Recovery] hell and flee in terror, seeking to be
rescued and protected. Without knowing, however, they are drawn by
their past actions and immediately arrive at Black Sands hell, where a hot
wind rages, blowing up clouds of hot black sand. Not only does the sand
stick to their bodies, turning them as dark as black clouds, but it sears the
skin, eating away the flesh and penetrating to the bone. Now their bodies
send up a dark smoke, which revolves around the body and returns back
into it, eating at it from within. Malefactors necessarily undergo this pun-
ishment for their actions and are prevented from dying until their offenses
have been fully expiated.
(2) After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, they
emerge from Black Sands hell and flee in terror, seeking to be rescued
and protected. Without knowing, however, they are drawn by their past
actions and immediately arrive at the hell of Boiling Excrement, where
hot iron balls lie in wait. When malefactors enter the iron balls appear
and cannot be evaded; as soon as it touches them the intense heat burns
every part of their bodies. The malefactors cannot help opening their
mouths, and then the hot balls scald their lips and tongue and throat, down
to the stomach. Wherever the iron balls touch them, they eat away [the
flesh]. [Moreover,] there are vermin [in that hell] that feed on iron and
they gnaw on the bodies, penetrating the bones and marrow. The male-
factors experience immeasurable hardship and suffering, but they must
undergo this punishment for their past actions and are prevented from
dying until their offenses have been fully expiated.

(3) After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, they  
emerge from Boiling Excrement hell and flee in terror, seeking to be res-  
cued and protected. Without knowing, however, they are drawn by their  
past actions and immediately arrive at the hell of Five Hundred Nailings.  
When they enter the guards immediately hurl them to the ground. One  
by one, they are taken and stretched out over hot irons and nails are fastened  
through their hands and feet and every part of their bodies, numbering  
five hundred in all. The malefactors scream in agony for there is no end  
to their distress, but they must undergo this punishment and are prevented  
from dying until their offenses have been fully expiated.  
(4) After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, they  
emerge from Five Hundred Nailings hell and flee in terror, seeking to be  
rescued and protected. Without knowing, however, they are drawn by  
their past actions and immediately arrive at the hell of Starvation. When  
they enter the guards ask, “Now you are here, what is it you want?” They  
reply, “Sir, we are starving.” At once the guards throw them down and  
stretch their bodies one after another over hot irons; they pull their mouths  
open with iron hooks and pour in hot iron balls that scald their lips, tongues,  
and throats, down to their stomachs. Wherever the iron balls touch their  
bodies they eat away at everything. The malefactors scream in agony, but  
they must undergo this punishment for their actions and are prevented  
from dying until their offenses have been fully expiated.  
(5) After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, they  
emerge from Starvation hell and flee in terror, seeking refuge and protec-  
tion. Without knowing, however, they are drawn by their past actions and  
immediately arrive at the hell of Thirst. When they enter the guards ask,  
“Now you are here, what is it you want?” They each reply, “Sir, I am  
thirsty.” At once the guards throw them down and stretch out their bodies  
on hot irons; they open their mouths with iron hooks and pour in melted  
copper that scalds their lips, tongues, and throats, down to their stomachs.  
Wherever the melted copper touches their bodies, it eats away at everything.  
The malefactors scream in agony, but they must undergo this punishment  
for their actions and are prevented from dying until their offenses have  
been fully expiated.

(6) After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, they
emerge from Thirst hell and flee in terror, seeking to be rescued and pro-
tected. Without knowing, however, they are drawn by their past actions
and immediately arrive at Copper Cauldron hell. The angry guards glare
and seize the offenders by the feet, throwing them into the cauldron. As
the liquid in the cauldron comes to a boil, their bodies slowly revolve from
the surface down to the bottom and back again, sometimes hovering in the
middle, like beans circulating in boiling water until they are cooked. The
malefactors, tossed like beans [in hot broth,] scream and howl, crying out
in bitter suffering, but they must undergo this punishment for their actions
and are prevented from dying until their offenses have been fully expiated.
(7) After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, they
emerge from Copper Cauldron hell and flee in terror, seeking to be rescued
and protected. Without knowing, however, they are drawn by their past
actions and immediately arrive at the hell of Copper Cauldrons. The
guards, glaring in anger, seize the offenders by the feet and throw them
into other cauldrons. As the liquid comes to a boil, their bodies slowly
revolve from the surface to the bottom and back again, sometimes hovering
in the middle, like beans circulating in boiling water until they are cooked.
The malefactors are tossed like beans as they plunge to the bottom and
come up again, their hands and feet sometimes appearing at the surface,
or their hips and bellies, or sometimes just their heads and faces. The guards
use iron hooks to spike the bodies and pull them out, tossing them [from
one cauldron] to another. The malefactors scream and howl, crying in bitter
suffering, but they must undergo this punishment for their actions and are
prevented from dying until their offenses have been fully expiated.
(8) After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, they
emerge from Copper Cauldrons hell and flee in terror, seeking refuge and
protection. Without knowing, however, they are drawn by their past actions
and immediately arrive at Grindstone hell, which is five hundred yojana s
long and wide. The guards, glaring fiercely, throw the offenders down onto
hot stone slabs and slowly stretch them out, using heated boulders to grind
their bodies into tiny fragments of flesh and bone, producing torrents of
blood and pus. The malefactors scream and howl, crying in extreme bitter

suffering, but they must undergo this punishment for their actions and are  
prevented from dying until their offenses have been fully expiated.  
(9) After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, they  
emerge from Grindstone hell and flee in terror, seeking to be rescued and  
protected. Without knowing, however, they are drawn by their past actions  
and immediately arrive at the hell of Blood and Pus, stretching five hundred  
_yojana_ s long and wide, with boiling springs of blood and pus steaming  
in the air. The malefactors run wildly through the boiling liquid and their  
hands and feet, and then their heads, faces, and entire bodies, are consumed  
by the heat. Ingesting the boiling liquid, their lips, tongues, and throats  
are scalded, down to their stomachs, and wherever their bodies are touched  
by the blood and pus [their flesh] boils away. The malefactors must undergo  
this punishment for their actions, however, and are prevented from dying  
until their offenses have been fully expiated.  
(10) After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, they  
emerge from Blood and Pus hell and flee in terror, seeking to be rescued  
and protected. Without knowing, however, they are drawn by their past  
actions and immediately arrive at the hell of Fire Tending, five hundred  
_yojana_ s long and wide, where a gigantic bonfire burns from within. Erupt-  
ing in flames when they appear, the fire emits intense heat as the offenders  
are rounded up by fierce guards and forced to pick up hot iron rods to  
tend the fiery pile. As they work on the fire, they suffer extreme burns not  
only on their hands and feet but all over their bodies. The heat is excru-  
ciating and they cry out in their suffering, but they must undergo this pun-  
ishment for their actions and are prevented from dying until their offenses  
have been fully expiated.  
(11) After undergoing these torments for a long time, they emerge from  
Fire Tending hell and flee in terror, seeking to be rescued and protected.  
Without knowing, however, they are drawn by their past actions and imme-  
diately arrive at River of Ashes hell, five hundred _yojana_ s in length,  
breadth, and depth, where boiling waves of hot ash gush forth, filling the  
place with putrid air. The sound of the churning waves crashing over them  
is terrifying, and as they come to the surface the waves turn into iron nee-  
dles, like eight-inch spearheads. [Moreover,] long swords are lined up on

the riverbank, and wolves and guards lie in wait in a forest of trees whose
branches, leaves, and fruit resemble swords and daggers with eight-inch
blades. When the malefactors enter the river their bodies sink and float
as they are tossed by the waves, and they are pierced repeatedly by the
iron spears, which tear open their rotting skin and flesh, releasing torrents
of blood and pus. The malefactors scream in agony from the excruciating
pain in every part of their bodies, but they must undergo this punishment
for their actions and are prevented from dying until their offenses have
been fully expiated.
After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, they emerge
from River of Ashes hell and as they crawl up over the bank, their bodies
slashed and grievously wounded, they are met by sharp swords set up on
the bank that slice their hands and feet. The guards ask, “Now you are here,
what is it you want?” They reply, “Sir, we are starving.” Immediately the
guards strike the offenders down and stretch their bodies one after another
over hot irons; they pull their mouths open with iron hooks and pour in
molten copper that scalds their lips, tongues, and throats, down to their
stomachs. Wherever the molten copper touches their bodies it eats away at
everything. Even more, wolves with long, sharp fangs tear off pieces of
their flesh and devour them as they watch.
After cooking in the River of Ashes and drinking molten copper, the
malefactors, pierced by spears and chewed up by wolves, try to flee. Climbing
up trees, they encounter sharp blades pointed down that slice their hands;
climbing back down, they find the blades all turned upward, slashing their
feet. Swords and daggers pierce their bodies and their skin and flesh falls
away, amid a stream of blood and pus, until only sinews hold together the
bones of the white skeletons that remain. Then iron birds from the trees
peck at their skulls to break them open so they can get at the brains. In
excruciating pain, the malefactors scream in agony but they must undergo
this punishment for their actions and are prevented from dying until their
offenses have been fully expiated.
(12) Returning to the River of Ashes, they sink and float as they are
tossed by the waves. Iron spears pierce their bodies again, tearing away
the rotting skin and flesh and releasing jets of blood and pus until only
white skeletons are left to drift away. But when a cool breeze blows over

them their skin and flesh regenerate as before. Standing up, they imme-  
diately flee in terror, seeking to be rescued and protected. Without knowing,  
however, they are drawn by their past actions and immediately arrive at  
the hell of Iron Fetters, which is five hundred _yojana_ s long and wide.  
When the malefactors enter hot iron fetters suddenly appear and they are  
forcibly shackled by the guards. The offenders watch their hands and feet  
burning down to stumps, as their entire bodies are eaten away. In excru-  
ciating pain, they scream in agony but they must undergo this punishment  
for their actions and are prevented from dying until their offenses have  
been fully expiated.  
(13) After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, the male-  
factors emerge from Iron Fetters hell and flee in terror, seeking to be rescued  
and protected. Without knowing, however, they are drawn by their past  
actions and immediately arrive at the hell of Axes and Hatchets, which is  
five hundred _yojana_ s in length and breadth. When they enter, guards glaring  
in anger grab the offenders and throw them down on hot irons; with heated  
axes and hatchets, they chop off their noses and ears, hands and feet, and  
hack at their bodies. In excruciating pain, the malefactors scream in agony,  
but they must undergo this punishment for their actions and are prevented  
from dying until their offenses have been fully expiated.  
(14) After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, the  
malefactors emerge from Axes and Hatchets hell and flee in terror, seeking  
to be rescued and protected. Without knowing, however, they are drawn  
by their past actions and immediately arrive at the Wolf Pack hell, stretching  
five hundred _yojana_ s long and wide. When they enter a pack of wolves  
rushes forward to attack, pulling them down as [they try to] escape. The  
wolves seize the offenders by their limbs and toss them about viciously,  
tearing at their flesh and bones while blood and pus pool on the ground.  
In excruciating pain, the malefactors feel racked in every part of their  
bodies but they must undergo this punishment for their actions and are  
prevented from dying until their offenses have been fully expiated.  
(15) After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, the  
malefactors emerge from Wolf Pack hell and flee in terror, seeking to be  
rescued and protected. Without knowing, however, they are drawn by  
their past actions and immediately arrive at the hell of Bladed Trees, five

hundred yojana s in length and breadth. When they enter they are met by
a great storm. Gusts blow through the trees and blade-like leaves fall in
a steady stream, severing their hands and feet and piercing every part of
their bodies, including their faces and heads, while iron birds swoop down
and peck at their eyes. In excruciating pain, the malefactors scream in
agony but they must undergo this punishment for their actions and are
prevented from dying until their offenses have been fully expiated.
(16) After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, the
malefactors emerge from Bladed Trees hell and flee in terror, seeking to
be rescued and protected. Without knowing, however, they are drawn by
their past actions and immediately arrive at the Cold and Icy hell, stretching
five hundred yojana s long and wide. When they enter they are met by a
great blast of cold wind that freezes their bodies. As their skin and flesh
fall to the ground, the malefactors scream in agony and thereupon their
lives come to an end.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
The great Black Rope hell contains sixteen minor hells, each of which is
five hundred yojana s long and wide and is enclosed by a fence separating
it from Cold and Icy hell. Why is it called Black Rope? The guards [in
that hell] throw the malefactors down and stretch their bodies one after
another over hot irons. Shackled with hot iron chains, the bodies are kept
in a straight line so that the guards, using hot iron hatchets, can slice all
of them into pieces, making up a chain of a hundred thousand parts, just
as a craftsman uses a sharp hatchet to shape pieces of wood and rope to
form them into a chain. Punished in this manner, the malefactors experience
pain and suffering beyond measure, but they must undergo this punishment
for their actions and are prevented from dying until their offenses have
been fully expiated. For this reason, it is called the Black Rope hell.
Again, the guards in this hell throw the malefactors down and stretch
their bodies one after another over hot irons. Shackling them with iron
chains, the guards saw through their bodies with handsaws, just as a crafts-
man uses a saw to cut pieces of wood. Punished in this manner, the male-
factors experience pain and suffering beyond measure, but they must
undergo this punishment for their actions and are prevented from dying

until their offenses have been fully expiated. For this reason, it is called  
Black Rope hell.  
Again, the guards in this hell throw the malefactors down and stretch  
their bodies one after another over hot irons. Shackled with hot iron chains,  
they feel their skin blistering, their flesh burning, their bones melting, and  
their marrow coming to a boil. Their pain and suffering are beyond meas-  
ure, but they must undergo this punishment for their actions and are pre-  
vented from dying until their offenses have been fully expiated. For this  
reason, it is called Black Rope hell.  
Again, the guards in this hell suspend hot iron chains, layer upon layer,  
and hung crosswise as well. They drive the malefactors through these  
hanging chains, which are tossed by a violent wind. Entangled, the male-  
factors watch their skin blistering, their flesh burning, their bones melting,  
and their marrow boiling. Their pain and suffering are beyond measure,  
but they must undergo this punishment for their actions and are prevented  
from dying until their sins have been fully expiated. For this reason, it is  
called Black Rope hell.  
Again, the guards in this hell seize the malefactors and force them to  
wrap hot iron chains around their bodies and watch as their skin blisters,  
their flesh burns, their bones melt, and their marrow boils. Their pain and  
suffering are beyond measure, but they must undergo this punishment for  
their actions and are prevented from dying until their offenses have been  
fully expiated. For this reason, it is called Black Rope hell.  
After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, the male-  
factors at length emerge from Black Rope hell and flee in terror, seeking  
to be rescued and protected. Without knowing, however, they are drawn  
by their past actions and immediately arrive at Black Sands hell, and so  
on, until they reach Cold and Icy hell and subsequently their lives come  
to an end, just as before.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

The great hell of Compression contains sixteen minor hells, each of which  
is five hundred _yojana_ s long and wide and is enclosed by a fence. Why  
is it called Compression? Because it is a great mountain of rock that splits  
open to allow offenders to enter, but when they do the two sides suddenly

come together, crushing them into bits of flesh and bone, and then reopen,
like two wooden clappers that rebound after each strike. Punished in this
way, the malefactors experience pain and suffering beyond measure but
they are prevented from dying until their offenses have been fully expiated.
For this reason, it is called the hell of Compression.
Again, there is a huge iron elephant in this hell that bellows fiercely
as it charges. Raging among the offenders, the elephant crushes their
bodies into bits of flesh and bone, releasing torrents of blood and pus. In
excruciating pain, the malefactors scream in agony but they are prevented
from dying until their offenses have been fully expiated. For this reason,
it is called the hell of Compression.
Again, the guards in this hell seize the offenders, placing them in a
grindstone and crushing their flesh and bones, releasing torrents of blood
and pus. Their pain and suffering are beyond measure but they are pre-
vented from dying until their offenses have been fully expiated. For this
reason, it is called the hell of Compression.
Again, the guards in this hell seize the offenders, putting them face
down over a great rock and using another huge rock to crush their bodies
into bits of flesh and bone, releasing torrents of blood and pus. The pain
they experience as their distress mounts is as intense as that of all the worst
poisons taken together, but they are prevented from dying until their offenses
have been fully expiated. For this reason, it is called the hell of Compression.
Again, the guards in this hell seize the offenders, placing them face
down in an iron mortar and methodically applying the pestle, beginning
at their feet and moving up to their heads, crushing their bodies into bits
of flesh and bone and releasing torrents of blood and pus. The pain they
experience as their distress mounts is as intense as that of all the worst poi-
sons taken together, but they are prevented from dying until their offenses
have been fully expiated. For this reason, it is called the hell of Compression.
After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, the male-
factors emerge from Compression hell and flee in terror, seeking to be
rescued and protected. Without knowing, however, they are drawn by
their past actions and immediately arrive at Black Sands hell, and so on,
until they reach Cold and Icy hell and subsequently their lives come to
an end, just as before.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

The great hell of Screaming contains sixteen minor hells that stretch five  
hundred _yojana_ s long and wide and are enclosed by fences. Why is it known  
as Screaming? The guards in this hell seize the offenders and toss them into  
a huge cauldron, where they burn in boiling water. The pain they experience  
as their distress mounts is as intense as that of all the worst poisons taken  
together, but they are prevented from dying until their offenses have been  
fully expiated. For this reason, it is called the hell of Screaming.  
Again, the guards in this hell seize the offenders and toss them into a  
huge iron jar, where they burn in boiling water. The pain they experience  
as their distress mounts is as intense as that of all the worst poisons taken  
together, but they are prevented from dying until their offenses have been  
fully expiated. For this reason, it is called the hell of Screaming.  
Again, the guards in this hell seize the offenders and stuff them into a  
small cauldron, where they burn in boiling water. They scream in agony  
but they are prevented from dying until their offenses have been fully  
expiated. For this reason, it is called the hell of Screaming.  
Again, the guards in this hell seize the offenders and throw them into  
a large iron frying pan, where they are repeatedly fried and then boiled.  
The malefactors scream in agony but they are prevented from dying until  
their offenses have been fully expiated. For this reason, it is called the  
hell of Screaming.  
After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, the male-  
factors emerge from Screaming hell and flee in terror, seeking to be rescued  
and protected. Without knowing, however, they are drawn by their past  
actions and immediately arrive at Black Sands hell, and so on, until they  
reach Cold and Icy hell and subsequently their lives come to an end, just  
as before.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

The hell of Great Screaming contains sixteen minor hells, each of which  
is five hundred _yojana_ s long and wide and enclosed by a fence. Why is  
it known as Great Screaming? The guards in this hell seize the offenders  
and throw them into a huge cauldron, where they burn in boiling water.

The screaming that erupts is desperate, for the pain they experience as
their distress mounts is as intense as that of all the worst poisons taken
together, yet they are prevented from dying until their offenses have been
fully expiated. For this reason, it is called the hell of Great Screaming.
Again, the guards in this hell seize the offenders and throw them into
an immense iron jar, where they burn in boiling water. The screaming that
erupts mounts ever higher because the pain they experience is as intense
as that of all the worst poisons taken together, yet they are prevented from
dying until their offenses have been fully expiated. For this reason, it is
called the hell of Great Screaming.
Again, the guards in this hell seize the offenders and throw them into
an iron cauldron, where they burn in boiling water. The screaming that

dying until their offenses have been fully expiated. For this reason, ()
it is called the hell of Great Screaming.

After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, the male-
factors emerge from Great Screaming hell and flee in terror, seeking to

their past actions and immediately arrive at Black Sands hell, and so on,
until they reach Cold and Icy hell and subsequently their lives come to
an end, just as before.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
The great hell of Fiery Heat contains sixteen minor hells, each of which
is five hundred yojana s long and wide and enclosed by a fence. Why is it
known as Fiery Heat? The guards in this hell take offenders to an iron
castle that glows, inside and out, with the heat of the fire burning within.

The malefactors are left here and are slowly incinerated, their skin and  
flesh burned away amid mounting pain as intense as that of all the worst  
poisons taken together, yet they are prevented from dying until their offenses  
have been fully expiated. For this reason, it is called the hell of Fiery Heat.  
Again, the guards in this hell take the offenders to an iron room that  
glows, inside and out, with the heat of the fire burning within. There the  
malefactors are incinerated, their skin and flesh burned away amid mount-  
ing pain as intense as that of all the worst poisons taken together, yet they  
are prevented from dying until their offenses have been fully expiated.  
For this reason, it is called the hell of Fiery Heat.  
Again, the guards in this hell take the offenders to an iron tower that  
glows, inside and out, with the heat of the fire burning within. There the  
malefactors are incinerated, their skin and flesh burned away amid mount-  
ing pain as intense as that of all the worst poisons taken together, yet they  
are prevented from dying until their offenses have been fully expiated.  
For this reason, it is called the hell of Fiery Heat.  
Again, the guards in this hell throw the offenders into a gigantic iron  
pot that glows, inside and out, with the heat of the fire burning within.  
There the malefactors are incinerated, their skin and flesh burned away  
amid mounting pain as intense as that of all the worst poisons taken  
together, yet they are prevented from dying until their offenses have been  
fully expiated. For this reason, it is called the hell of Fiery Heat.  
Again, the guards in this hell throw the offenders down onto a flat iron  
plate whose surfaces glow with the heat of the fire burning within. There  
the malefactors are incinerated, their skin and flesh burned away amid  
mounting pain as intense as that of all the worst poisons taken together,  
yet they are prevented from dying until their offenses have been fully  
expiated. For this reason, it is called the hell of Fiery Heat.  
After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, the malefactors  
emerge from Fiery Heat hell and flee in terror, seeking to be rescued and  
protected. Without knowing, however, they are drawn by their past actions  
and immediately arrive at Black Sands hell, and so on, until they reach Cold  
and Icy hell and subsequently their lives come to an end, just as before.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

The great hell of Great Fiery Heat contains sixteen minor hells, each of
which is five hundred yojana s long and wide and enclosed by a fence.
Why is it known as Great Fiery Heat? The guards in this hell put the
offenders inside an iron castle that glows, inside and out, with the heat of
the fire burning within. There the malefactors are incinerated twice over,
their skin and flesh burned away amid mounting pain as intense as that
of all the worst poisons taken together, yet they are prevented from dying
until their offenses have been fully expiated. For this reason, it is called
the hell of Great Fiery Heat.
Again, the guards in this hell take the offenders to an iron room that
glows, inside and out, with the heat of the fire burning within. There the
malefactors are incinerated twice over, their skin and flesh burned away
amid mounting pain as intense as that of all the worst poisons taken

away amid mounting pain as intense as that of all the worst poisons taken
together, yet they are prevented from dying until their offenses have been
fully expiated. For this reason, it is called the hell of Great Fiery Heat.
Again, there is a natural firepit in this hell, flanked by two volcanic
mountains. The guards seize the offenders, skewer them with an iron rod,
and lower them into the firepit. The malefactors are incinerated twice
over, their skin and flesh burned away amid mounting pain as intense as
that of all the worst poisons taken together, yet they are prevented from
dying until their offenses have been fully expiated. For this reason, it is
called the hell of Great Fiery Heat.

After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time, the male-  
factors emerge from Great Fiery Heat hell and flee in terror, seeking to  
be rescued and protected. Without knowing, however, they are drawn by  
their past actions and immediately arrive at Black Sands hell, and so on,  
until they reach Cold and Icy hell and subsequently their lives come to  
an end, just as before.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

The great hell of Unremitting Suffering ( _wujiantadiyu; avīci_ ) contains six-  
teen minor hells, each of which is five hundred _yojana_ s long and wide and  
enclosed by a fence. Why is it known as Unremitting Suffering? The guards  
in this hell seize the offenders, skin them alive from head to toe, and use  
their flayed skin to lash them to the hot wheels of a chariot, which they  
drive back and forth across a fiery iron track. Once crushed, the bodies of  
the malefactors disintegrate into tiny bits of flesh and bone and left scattered  
along the track. The pain they experience as their distress mounts is as  
intense as that of all the worst poisons taken together, yet they are prevented  
from dying until their offenses have been fully expiated. For this reason,  
it is called the hell of Unremitting Suffering.  
Again, there is a great iron castle in this hell that is besieged [at times]  
with blazing fires on all four sides. The flames on the eastern side leap  
over the castle to the western side, and vice versa; the flames on the south-  
ern side reach the northern side, and vice versa. Similarly, the flames in  
the upper stories reach down to the cellar, and the flames in the cellar rise  
up without cease, leaving nothing untouched. The malefactors within the  
castle try to flee but they cannot escape and wherever they turn their skin  
and flesh are devoured by the flames. The pain they experience as their  
distress mounts is as intense as that of all the worst poisons taken together,  
yet they are prevented from dying until their offenses have been fully  
expiated. For this reason, it is called the hell of Unremitting Suffering.  
Again, the iron castles in this hell burn from within, like fiery caves.  
The malefactors trapped within the castles are incinerated, their skin and  
flesh burned away. The pain they experience as their distress mounts is as  
intense as that of all the worst poisons taken together, yet they are prevented

from dying until their offenses have been fully expiated. For this reason,
it is called the hell of Unremitting Suffering.
Again, after being trapped for some time, the malefactors see the gate
to this hell begin to open and they rush toward it, desperate [to escape].
As they run, like a strongman carrying a fiery torch and running against
the wind, the joints in their limbs feel as if they are being consumed in
flames. But when they reach the gate it suddenly closes and they fall onto
a sizzling iron floor. As their skin and flesh are burned away, the pain they
experience as their distress mounts is as intense as that of all the worst
poisons taken together, yet they are prevented from dying until their
offenses have been fully expiated. For this reason, it is called the hell of
Unremitting Suffering.
Again, everything the malefactors see in this hell is repulsive, everything
they hear is grotesque, everything they smell is offensive, everything they
touch is painful, and every passing notion is a malevolent thought. There
is no letup in their suffering, not even for as brief a moment as a finger
snap. For this reason, it is called the hell of Unremitting Suffering.
After undergoing the torments of this hell for a long time the malefactors
emerge from Unremitting Suffering hell and flee in terror, seeking to be
rescued and protected. Without knowing, however, they are drawn by
their past actions and immediately arrive at Black Sands hell and so on,
until they reach Cold and Icy hell and subsequently their lives come to
an end, just as before.
The World-honored One then continued in verse:
Committing evil physical actions,
And so too evil speech and thought,
One falls into the hell of Conscious Recovery;
Fearing this, your hair stands on end.
When hiding an evil thought, one meets
One’s parents, the Buddha, and his saintly disciples,
One falls into the Black Rope hell;
The suffering there is beyond imagination.
When one commits nothing but the three evils,

Without performing any of the three kinds of good,  
One falls into the hell of Compression;  
The suffering there is beyond imagination.

When one holds malevolent intent in hatred and anger,  
And is defiled with the blood of one’s victims  
Through many kinds of evil actions,  
One falls into the hell of Screaming.

When one follows various evil views,  
Bewildered by the bonds of love and lust,  
Committing abject [bad] deeds out of blindness,  
One falls into the hell of Great Screaming.

Whoever does anything out of passion,  
Subjecting other sentient beings to the flames,  
[He or she] falls into the hell of Fiery Heat  
And suffers there for a long time.

Whoever abandons the actions that promote good  
And the purity that leads to a good end,  
Committing abject and evil deeds,  
[That person] falls into the hell of Great Fiery Heat.

Whoever commits egregious offenses  
Creates the power that leads to an evil end  
And falls into the hell of Unremitting Suffering;  
The punishments therein are beyond imagination.

Conscious Recovery, Black Rope, Compression, Screaming,  
Great Screaming, Fiery Heat, Great Fiery Heat, Unremitting Suffering:  
The eight great hells are like caves glowing with fire;  
Each contains sixteen minor hells for all one’s past [evil] actions.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

Between the two diamond mountain [ranges] great gusts of wind called  
_sāṃkhya_ [occasionally] rage. If a storm were to sweep over the four con-  
tinents and their eighty thousand territories, it would race through the air

and smash everything into pieces, blasting the very earth and the great
mountains, including the greatest mountain of all, Mount Sumeru, as well
as everything else up to ten or a hundred li above the ground, just as when
one takes a handful of bran and throws it into the air. Such would be the
effect if a great storm were to blow through this world. But the two dia-
mond ranges block [this raging wind] from reaching this world.
O bhikṣu s, you should know that the two beneficial diamond ranges
are the result of the good conduct of sentient beings. Again, the raging
winds between the two ranges blow with intense heat and fiery flames. If
those winds were to blow through this world, all the sentient beings, as
well as the hills, rivers, inlets, oceans, grasses and trees, bushes and forests,
would at once shrivel up and burn, just as live grass withers within an
hour when it is cut and left under the hot summer sun. The heat from these
raging winds would consume everything in like manner. But the two dia-
mond ranges block them from reaching this world.
O bhikṣu s, you should know that the two beneficial diamond ranges
are the result of the good conduct of sentient beings. Again, the raging
winds between the two ranges have a putrid smell, like something
extremely foul. If these winds were to blow through this world the noxious
stench would cause all sentient beings to lose their sight. But the two dia-
mond ranges block them from reaching this world.
O bhikṣu s, you should know that the two beneficial diamond ranges
are the result of the good conduct of sentient beings. Again, between the
two ranges are ten hells, called (1) Thick Cloud, (2) Absent Cloud, (3)
Hehe (4) Nahe, (5) Bleating Sheep, (6) Sūgandhika, (7) Utpala, (8)
Kumuda, (9) Puṇḍarīka, and (10) Padma.
Why is the first hell called Thick Cloud? The bodies of the offenders
who fall into this hell grow of their own accord, just as a heavy cloud
[forms of its own]. Hence it is called Thick Cloud. Why is the second
[hell] called Absent Cloud? The bodies of the offenders in this hell auto-
matically regrow, like flesh that can be consumed. Hence it is called Absent
Cloud. Why is the third [hell] called Hehe? The offenders in this hell utter
the sound he he when their flesh is pierced. Hence it is called Hehe. Why
is the fourth [hell] called Nahe? Because the offenders who suffer from
their flesh being pierced have no rescuers, everyone in this hell mutters,

“ _Nahe_ (“no one”) to rely on.” Hence it is called Nahe. Why is the fifth  
[hell] called Bleating Sheep? Here the offenders who suffer from their  
flesh being pierced try to speak but they are unable to move their tongues  
and can only utter the sound _baaaa._ Hence it is called Bleating Sheep.  
Why is the sixth [hell] called Sūgandhika? Everything in this hell is black,  
like the color of _sūgandhika_ blossoms. Hence it is called Sūgandhika.  
Why is the seventh [hell] called Utpala? Everything in this hell is blue,  
like the color of a blue lotus ( _utpala_ ). Hence it is called Utpala. Why is  
the eighth [hell] called Kumuda? Everything in this hell is pink ( _kumuda_ ).  
Hence it is called Kumuda. Why is the ninth [hell] called Puṇḍarīka?  
Everything in this hell is white ( _puṇḍarīka_ ). Hence it is called Puṇḍarīka.  
Why is the tenth [hell] called Padma? Everything [in this hell] is red  
( _padma_ ). Hence it is called Padma.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

Take the example of a container that holds sixty-four _hu_^27 of grain. Suppose  
this container was filled with sesame seeds and you were to remove a  
single seed from the container every one hundred years. Even when all  
the seeds have been removed, a malefactor in Thick Cloud hell will not  
yet have completed the term of his atonement. Now, multiply one term  
in Thick Cloud twenty times and that equals a single term in Absent Cloud  
hell. Twenty times a term in Absent Cloud equals a single term in Hehe  
hell. Twenty times a term in Hehe equals a single term in Nahe hell. Twenty  
times a term in Nahe equals a single term in Bleating Sheep hell. Twenty  
times a term in Bleating Sheep equals a single term in Sūgandhika hell.  
Twenty times a term in the Sūgandhika equals a single term in Utpala  
hell. Twenty times a term in Utpala equals a single term in Kumuda hell.  
Twenty times a term in Kumuda equals a single term in Puṇḍarīka hell.  
Twenty times a term in Puṇḍarīka equals a single term in Padma hell.  
Twenty times a term in Padma hell is called a median eon, and twenty  
median eons make up a major eon. Now the fiery heat in Padma is so  
intense that it can burn the bodies of malefactors even at a distance of  
one hundred _yojana_ s; at sixty _yojana_ s the malefactors are totally deaf-  
ened, and at fifty _yojana_ s they are completely blinded, unable to see  
anything again.

When the bhikṣu Kaukālika slandered the [two great] elders Śāriputra
and Maudgalyāyana with malevolent intent, he fell into Padma [Hell]. At
that moment, the lord of Brahmā Heaven uttered the following verse:
Those who are born hold an ax in their mouth
And slay others with slanderous speech.
Praising someone who should be criticized
And criticizing someone who should be praised
Are equally evil deeds in speech,
And the means of acquiring [multiple] offenses.
Although acquiring wealth through treachery
Only brings a slight misfortune,
Slandering the saintly disciples
Must be counted a grave offense.
For this, one suffers in Thick Cloud [hell]
For a hundred thousand years,
Or forty-one terms in Absent Cloud [hell].
All who slander will receive this retribution
As the result of their evil thought and speech.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
The lord of Brahmā Heaven spoke the truth in his verse, and the buddhas
also regard it as true. Now, I, the Tathāgata, who has eradicated all defile-
ments and attained perfect enlightenment, give the same teaching expressed
in this verse:
Those who are born hold an ax in their mouth
And slay others with slanderous speech.
Praising someone who should be criticized
And criticizing someone who should be praised
Are equally evil deeds in speech,
And the means of acquiring [multiple] offenses.
Although acquiring wealth through treachery
Only brings a slight misfortune,
Slandering the saintly disciples
Must be counted a grave offense.

For this, one suffers in Thick Cloud [hell]  
For a hundred thousand years,  
Or forty-one terms in Absent Cloud [hell].  
All who slander will receive this retribution  
As the result of their evil thought and speech.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

To the south of Jambudvīpa, within the great diamond range, is the palace  
of the king of the hells [Yamarāja], who rules over an area six thousand  
_yojana_ s long and wide. The castle consists of seven concentric buildings  
and is ringed by seven railings, seven ornamental nets, seven lines of trees  
and so forth, with innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together,  
just as in the other palatial settings. Thrice each night the king of the hells  
is confronted with a great copper cauldron that automatically appears  
before him. When the cauldron appears in the palace the king is terrified  
and flees the palace grounds in order to get away from it. If he is outside  
the palace when he sees [the cauldron], he is terrified and returns to the  
palace, but an imposing guard seizes the king, throws him down on a hot  
iron, pries his mouth open with an iron hook, and pours molten copper  
into it. The molten copper scalds his lips, tongue, and throat down to the  
stomach, eating away at everything. When his atonement is over, the king  
of the hells resumes his life and once again enjoys his royal status with  
the palace ladies. The numerous ministers who also enjoy the rewards of  
their station undergo the same punishment.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

There are three messengers. What are the three? The first is the messenger  
of old age, the second is the messenger of illness, and the third is the mes-  
senger of death. Any sentient being who has committed evil deeds in  
thought and speech, as well as with physical actions, falls into the hells  
at the end of his or her life and the dissolution of the body. The guards in  
the hells lead them before the king of the hells and report, “It has been  
deemed proper by the messengers appointed by the heavens that these  
people should come to this court. May Your Majesty examine them and  
seek their response.”

The king of the hells asks an offender, “Did you not see the initial mes-
senger?” The offender replies, “No, sir. I did not notice him.” The king
asks again, “While you lived among other humans, you must have seen
old people whose hair had turned white, whose teeth had fallen out, who
had gone blind, whose skin had become loose and wrinkled, whose backs
were hunched, and who could walk only with a cane, uttering low moans
and groans while their bodies trembled and their spirits declined. Have
you not [seen this]?” The offender replies, “Yes, sir. I have seen them.”
The king asks again, “Did you think that you too would become like
them?” The offender says, “I was careless and indulgent and it did not
occur to me, sir.” The king replies, “Since you were careless and indulgent,
[as you admit,] you were unable to control your physical, mental, and
verbal actions; nor were you able to reform your evil habits or follow
good ones. I must inform you about the suffering that results from careless
indulgence in life.” The king goes on, “Whatever punishment you must
undergo is not due to the fault of your parents, your siblings, the lord of
the heavens, your ancestral spirits, your friends, servants, or employees.
Nor is it due to the fault of any śramaṇa or brāhmaṇa; it is solely due to
your own faults, and so you must now accept the appropriate punishment.”
After asking offenders about the first messenger, the king of the hells
questions them in relation to the second heavenly messenger, “Didn’t you
see the second messenger?” An offender replies, “No, sir.” The king asks
again, “While you lived among other humans, you must have seen people
with illnesses so serious that they could only lie on a couch stained with
[their own] urine and excretions, unable to sit or stand, completely reliant
on the help of others for their food and drink; their hundred joints having
become so painful, they moan and groan and shed tears, unable to speak
a word. Haven’t you seen such people?” The offender replies, “Yes, sir.”
The king continues, “Why didn’t you think that you too would become
like them?” The offender says, “I was careless and indulgent and it did
not occur to me, sir.” The king replies, “Since you were careless and indul-
gent, you were unable to control your physical, mental, and verbal actions;
nor were you able to reform your evil habits or follow good ones. I must
inform you about the suffering that results from careless indulgence in
life.” The king goes on, “Whatever punishment you must undergo is not

due to the fault of your parents, your siblings, the lord of the heavens,  
your ancestral spirits, your friends, servants, or employees. Nor is it due  
to the fault of any _śramaṇa_ or _brāhmaṇa;_ it is solely due to your own  
faults, and so you must now accept the appropriate punishment.”  
After asking offenders about the second messenger, the king of the  
hells questions them in relation to the third heavenly messenger, “Didn’t  
you see the third messenger?” An offender replies, “No, sir.” The king  
asks again, “While you lived among other humans, you must have seen  
people die and their physical bodies dissolved as their life ends; their fac-  
ulties had ceased to function, their bodies as stiff as dried wood, and either  
thrown onto a cemetery mound to be pecked at by birds or animals,  
enclosed in a coffin within an external vault, or cremated in fire. Haven’t  
you seen this?” The offender replies, “Yes, sir, I have.” The king continues,  
“Why didn’t you think that you too would become like that?” The offender  
says, “I was careless and indulgent and it did not occur to me, sir.” The  
king replies, “Since you were careless and indulgent, you were unable to  
control your physical, mental, and verbal actions; nor were you able to  
reform your evil habits or follow good ones. I must inform you about the  
suffering that results from careless indulgence in life.” The king goes on,  
“Whatever punishment you must undergo is not due to the fault of your  
parents, or your siblings, the lord of the heavens, your ancestral spirits,  
your friends, servants, or employees. Nor is it due to the fault of any _śra-  
maṇa_ or _brāhmaṇa;_ it is solely due to your own faults, and so you must  
now accept the appropriate punishment.”  
After taking the offenders through detailed questioning in relation to  
the three heavenly messengers, the king of the hells hands them over to  
the guards, who lead them down to a great hell measuring a hundred  
_yojana_ s long and wide, and an equal depth below the ground.

Then the World-honored One uttered the following verse:

Four gates are open to the four directions,  
With all roads and passages leading here.  
Each hell is enclosed in iron walls,  
With an iron net ceiling  
And an iron floor.

Fierce flames blow [into these hells] continually,
Each a hundred yojana s in length and breadth,
Firmly set, neither tilting nor shaking.
Dark smoke rises in every part of the chamber,
Making it hard to see through the bright fiery glow.
Sixteen minor hells are attached,
All of them filled with fierce flames,
The heat of which matches the evil actions of the offenders.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
The king of the hells thought to himself, “No sentient being in the world
is free from ignorance and delusion, and therefore he or she commits evil
deeds physically, mentally, and verbally. Having done so, when their lives
end there is no one, with few exceptions, who is not subject to these kinds
of hellish suffering. If the sentient beings in the world would reform their
evil habits, however, and control their physical, mental, and verbal actions
and thus engage in good conduct, they would enjoy happiness in a heaven
after the end of their life, like the heavenly gods. If I should be born a
human after my death and come into the presence of the Tathāgata, I would
shave my hair and beard under the guidance of the right Dharma, don the
three mendicant robes, renounce domestic life, attain pure faith, and engage
in the practice of austerity so as to accomplish what must be done [for
salvation], acquire insight into the nature of things as they really are, and
realize for myself, in this life, the direct experience that there is no more
birth for me ever again.”
Then the World-honored One uttered the following verse:
After seeing the heavenly messengers,
If one carelessly continues to indulge in life,
He or she accumulates worries and is reborn in a lower state.
If one is wise, on seeing the heavenly messengers
He or she will cleave to the Dharma of the saintly disciples
And refrain from careless indulgence in life.
Foreseeing rebirth in old age, illness, and death,
One sees that deliverance only comes when there is no rebirth.

By exhausting the cycle of birth, old age, illness, and death,
One realizes [eternal] peace and happiness.
By [resolving to] attain the transcendent goal in this life,
One overcomes all worries and fears
And is destined to realize final nirvana.

#### Article 5: Dragons

#### and Birds

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

There are four kinds of dragons ( nāga s). What are the four? (1) Those
born from an egg, (2) those born from a womb, (3) those born from moist
heat, and (4) those born through transformation. Those are the four ways
of birth. There are also four kinds of garuḍa s (mythological bird), and
they too are born from an egg, a womb, moist heat, or transformation.
At the bottom of the great ocean is the palace of the dragon lord Sāgara -
nāgarāja, which is eighty thousand yojana s long and wide, ringed by sev-
enfold walls embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and
seven lines of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on,
with innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together, as in the
palaces already mentioned.
Between Mount Sumeru and Mount Khadira are two palaces belonging
to the dragon lords called Nanda and Upananda. Each palace, measuring
a thousand yojana s long and wide, is ringed by sevenfold walls embellished
with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees, all
made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with innumerable rare
birds singing harmoniously together, as in the palaces already mentioned.
To the north of the great ocean is a gigantic tree, called kūṭaśālmali,
in which both the lord of the nāga s and the lord of the garuḍa s reside.
The circumference of this tree is a full seven yojana s; it rises to a height
of one hundred yojana s and its branches and leaves extend out as far as
fifty yojana s.
To the east of this tree are the palaces of the nāga s born from an egg
and the palaces of the garuḍa s born from an egg, each measuring six thou-
sand yojana s in length and breadth. Each palace is ringed by sevenfold

walls embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven
lines of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with
innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together, as in the other palaces
already mentioned. To the south of the kūtaśālmali tree are the palaces of
the nāga s and garuḍa s born from a womb; each palace is six thousand
yojana s long and wide, ringed by sevenfold walls embellished with seven
railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees, all made from the
seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with innumerable rare birds singing har-
moniously together, as in the other palaces already mentioned. To the west
of the kūtaśālmali tree are the palaces of the nāga s and garuḍa s born from
a moist heat, which measure six thousand yojana s in length and breadth.
Each palace is ringed by sevenfold walls embellished with seven railings,
seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees, all made from the seven
kinds of treasure, and so on, with innumerable rare birds singing harmo-
niously together, as in the other palaces already mentioned. To the north of
the kūtaśālmali tree are the palaces of the nāga s and garuḍa s born through
transformation, each of which is six thousand yojana s long and wide. Each
palace is ringed by sevenfold walls embellished with seven railings, seven
ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees, all made from the seven kinds of
treasure, and so on, with innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously
together, as in the other palaces already mentioned.
When a garuḍa born from an egg wishes to partake of dragon meat,
it flies down from an eastern branch of the kūṭaśālmali tree and strikes
the surface of the ocean with its wings, creating waves on both sides that
roll out to a distance of two hundred yojana s. In the trough [of the wave]
the garuḍa feeds on the flesh of dragons born from an egg as freely as it
wishes. However, it cannot catch the other three kinds of dragons.
When a garuḍa born from a womb wishes to partake of the flesh of
dragons born from an egg, it flies down from an eastern branch of the
kūṭaśālmali tree and strikes the surface of the ocean with its wings, creating
waves on both sides that roll out to a distance of two hundred yojana s. In
the trough [of the wave] it feeds on the flesh of dragons born from an egg,
as freely as it wishes. When a garuḍa born from a womb wishes to partake
of dragons born from a womb, it flies down from a southern branch of
the kūṭaśālmali tree and strikes the surface of the ocean with its wings,

creating waves on both sides that roll out to a distance of four hundred  
_yojana_ s. In the trough [of the wave] it feeds on dragons born from a womb,  
as freely as it wishes. However, it cannot catch dragons born from moist  
heat or through transformation.  
When a _garuḍa_ born from moist heat wishes to partake of the flesh of  
a dragon born from an egg, it flies down from an eastern branch of the  
_kūṭa śālmali_ tree and strikes the surface of the ocean with its wings, creating  
waves on both sides that roll out to a distance of two hundred _yojana_ s. In  
the trough [of the wave] it feeds on the flesh of dragons born from an egg,  
as freely as it wishes. When a _garuḍa_ born from moist heat wishes to par-  
take of the flesh of dragons born from a womb, it flies down from an  
eastern branch of the _kūṭaśālmali_ tree and strikes the surface of the ocean  
with its wings, creating waves on both sides that roll out to a distance of  
four hundred _yojana_ s. In the trough [of the wave] it feeds on the flesh of  
dragons born from an egg as freely as it wishes. When a _garuḍa_ born from  
moist heat wishes to partake of the flesh of dragons born from moist heat,  
it flies down from a western branch of the _kūṭaśālmali_ tree and strikes the  
surface of the ocean with its wings, creating waves on both sides that roll  
out to a distance of eight hundred _yojana_ s. In the trough [of the wave] it  
feeds on the flesh of dragons born from moist heat, as freely as it wishes.  
However, it cannot catch dragons born through transformation.  
When a _garuḍa_ born through incarnation wishes to partake of the flesh  
of dragons born from an egg, it flies down from an eastern branch of the  
_kūṭaśālmali_ tree and strikes the surface of the ocean with its wings, creating  
waves on both sides that roll out to a distance of two hundred _yojana_ s. In  
the trough [of the wave] it feeds on dragons born from an egg, as freely  
as it wishes. When a _garuḍa_ born through transformation wishes to partake  
of the flesh of dragons born from a womb, it flies down from a southern  
branch of the _kūṭaśālmali_ tree and strikes the surface of the ocean with  
its wings, creating waves on both sides that roll out to a distance of four  
hundred _yojana_ s. In the trough [of the wave] it feeds on dragons born  
from a womb, as freely as it wishes. When a _garuḍa_ born through trans-  
formation wishes to partake of the flesh of dragons born from moist heat,  
it flies down from a western branch of the _kūṭaśālmali_ tree and strikes the  
surface of the ocean with its wings, creating waves on both sides that roll

out to a distance of eight hundred yojana s. In the trough [of the wave] it
feeds on the flesh of dragons born from moist heat, as freely as it wishes.
When a garuḍa born through transformation wishes to partake of the flesh
of dragons born through transformation, it flies down from a northern
branch of the kūṭaśālmali tree and strikes the surface of the ocean with
its wings, creating waves on both sides that roll out to a distance of sixteen
hundred yojana s. In the trough [of the wave] it feeds on the flesh of dragons
born through transformation, as freely as it wishes. The foregoing
[describes] the dragons that are eaten by the garuḍa s.
There are dragons, however, on whom even the garuḍa s cannot feed.
Who are these dragons? They are Sāgaranāgarāja, Nanda, Upananda, Yina -
poluo, Titoulaicha, Sudṛśa, Alü, Jiejuluo, Jiapiluo, Aboluo, Jiatu, Qujiatu,
Anavatapta, Supratiṣṭhita, Yushanqiebotou, and Dechajia. These are the
dragon kings who are not subject to [being consumed by] the garuḍa s, and
those under their care are free from the fate met by the other dragons.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
If a sentient being upholds dragon norms and always observes, in mind
and volition, the importance of the rules followed by dragons, that person
will be reborn in the dragon world. If a sentient being upholds the norms
of garuḍa s and always observes, in mind and volition, the importance of
the rules followed by garuḍa s, that person will be reborn in the world of
the garuḍa s. If a sentient being upholds the norms of the hare and owl
and always observes, in mind and volition, the importance of their rules,
that person will [be reborn] into their world. If a sentient being upholds
the norms of a dog, cow, deer, or [the norms] of a mute, of Maṇibhadra,
the sun and moon, of water, fire, or sacrificial fire, or of various ascetic
practices, and if that person also thinks, “I have upheld the norms of a
mute, of Maṇibhadra, of the sun and moon, of water, fire, and sacrificial
fire, and of various ascetic practices, and because of those merits I wish
to be reborn in heaven”—[what do you think?] Is this a wrong view?
The Buddha continued:
I shall explain that the kind of person who upholds the following wrong
views is bound to fall [upon rebirth] into one of two places—either in the

hells or the four kinds of [animal] births. Some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s  
theorize that “The self and the world are permanent; this view alone is  
true while the rest is false,” or “The self and the world are impermanent;  
this view alone is true while the rest is false,” or “The self and the world  
are both permanent and impermanent; this view alone is true while the  
rest is false,” or “The self and the world are limited (i.e., come to an end);  
this view alone is true while the rest is false,” or “The self and the world  
are limitless (i.e., never come to an end); this view alone is true while the  
rest is false,” or “The self and the world are both limited and limitless;  
this view alone is true while the rest is false,” or “The self and the world  
are neither limited nor limitless; this view alone is true while the rest is  
false,” or “This life principle ( _jīva_ ) and this corporeal body [are identical];  
this view alone is true while the rest is false,” or “This life principle is  
different [from the body], and the body differs [from the life principle];  
this view alone is true while the rest is false,” or “There is neither a life  
principle nor no life principle; this view alone is true while the rest is  
false,” or “There is neither a life principle nor a corporeal body; this view  
alone is true while the rest is false.”  
Some assert, “There is a further death beyond this; this view alone is  
true while the rest is false.” Others assert, “There is no further death  
beyond this; this view alone is true while the rest is false.” A third group  
asserts, “There is both a further death beyond this and no further death  
beyond this; this view alone is true while the rest is false.” A fourth group  
asserts, “There is neither a further death beyond this, nor no further death  
beyond this.”  
When a _śramaṇa_ or _brāhmaṇa_ says, “The world is permanent; this  
view alone is true while the rest is false,” that person is affirming an  
assumption based on tendencies that predispose him to believe that there  
is a permanent self ( _ātma-dṛṣṭi_ ) and a permanent life principle ( _jīva_ ), and  
that the body is the self and the world is permanent. Because of this, he  
asserts that the self and the world are permanent. When someone says [in  
opposition], “The world is impermanent,” that person is affirming a similar  
assumption, in that it is also based on the predisposition to believe that  
there is a permanent self and a permanent life principle, and that the body  
is the self and the world is permanent. Thus such a person asserts that the

self and the world are impermanent. When someone asserts that the world
is both permanent and impermanent, that person is also affirming an
assumption based on a predisposition to believe that there is a permanent
self and a permanent life principle, and that the body is the self and the
world is permanent. Thus such a person now asserts that the self and the
world are both permanent and impermanent. When someone asserts that
the world is neither permanent nor impermanent, this again is affirming
an assumption based on a predisposition to believe that there is a permanent
self and a permanent life principle, and that the body is the self and the
world is permanent. Thus such a person maintains that the self and the
world are neither permanent nor impermanent.
When someone asserts that the self and the world are limited, he too
is affirming an assumption based on a predisposition to believe that there
is a permanent self and a permanent life principle, and that the body is
the self and the world is permanent, and also that the life principle, the
physical body, and the world are limited. [In this view,] the body consisting
of the four gross elements continually transforms itself from the moment
of conception until its arrival at the cemetery, sustaining itself over a span
of seven lives. When at length the latent tendencies (i.e., predispositional
forces) of the physical body and life principle are exhausted, the self enters
into a pure state (i.e., a purified aggregate). Thus such a person maintains
that the self is limited.
When someone asserts that the self and the world are limitless, this is
again affirming an assumption based on a predisposition to believe that
the life principle, the physical body, and the world are limitless. The body
consisting of the four gross elements continually transforms itself from
the moment of conception until its arrival at the cemetery, sustaining itself
over a span of seven lives. When at length the latent tendencies of the
physical body and life principle are exhausted the self enters into a pure
state. Seeing this, such a person maintains that the self is limitless.
When someone asserts that the world is both limited and limitless, this
too is affirming an assumption based on their practice, the belief that there
is a permanent self and a permanent life principle, that the body is the self
and the world is permanent, and that the life principle ( jīva ) is both limited
and limitless. The body consisting of the four gross elements continually

transforms itself from the moment of conception until its arrival at the  
cemetery, sustaining itself over a span of seven lives. When at length the  
latent tendencies of the physical body and life principle are exhausted the  
self enters into a pure state. Seeing this, such a person maintains that the  
self and the world are both limited and limitless.  
When someone asserts that the self and the world are neither limited  
nor limitless, this is affirming an assumption based on a predisposition to  
believe that the life principle and the physical body are limitless. The  
body consisting of the four gross elements continually transforms itself  
from the moment of conception until its arrival at the cemetery, sustaining  
itself over a span of seven lives. When at length the latent tendencies of  
the physical body and life principle are exhausted the self enters into a  
pure state. Seeing this, such a person maintains that the self is neither lim-  
ited nor limitless.  
When someone asserts that the life principle is identical with the physical  
body, this is affirming the existence of the life principle in relation to this  
physical body, and [also] its existence in relation to another [different] body.  
Because of this, such a person maintains that the life principle is identical  
with the physical body. If they assert, however, that the physical body differs  
when the life principle differs, they are affirming the existence of the life  
principle in relation to the physical body but not its existence in relation to  
another [different] body. Thus such a person maintains that when there is  
a change in the life principle there is a different physical body.  
When someone asserts that the body and the life principle are existent  
as well as nonexistent, this is affirming an assumption that there is no life  
principle in relation to the body but that there is a life principle in another  
body. Because of this, such a person asserts that there is a life principle  
and also that there is no life principle. If someone asserts that there is  
neither the body nor a life principle, this is affirming a view that there is  
neither a life principle in this body nor a life principle in another body.  
Because of this, such a person asserts that there is neither a life principle  
nor the corporeal body.  
When someone asserts that there is another [different] death than this,  
this is affirming an assumption that there is a life principle now and [also  
that] the life principle and [the] body will be active later on (i.e., in an

afterlife). Because of this, such a person asserts that there is a different
death than this. If someone asserts that there is not another death than
this, this is affirming an assumption that there is a life principle in this
[present] life but that there is no life principle in the afterlife. Because of
this, such a person asserts that there is not another death than this. If some-
one asserts that there is another death than this as well as not another death
than this, this is affirming an assumption that the life principle is annihilated
in this life but [other] life principles become active in the afterlife. Because
of this, such a person asserts both that there is another life principle than
this and that there is not another life principle than this. If someone asserts
that there is neither another death like this nor not another death like this,
this is affirming an assumption that the present life principle and body
are annihilated and that the life principle and the body in the afterlife will
also be annihilated. Because of this, such a person asserts that there is
neither another death than this nor not another death than this.
Then the World-honored One said to the bhikṣu s:
Once there was a king called Ādarśamukha (or Darpaṇamukha). It happened
that a group of blind men had gathered at one spot and the king asked them,
“O blind men, do you know what an elephant is?” They replied, “O great
king, we do not know, nor would we recognize, what an elephant is.” The
king asked again, “Would you like to know how it is shaped?” They replied,
“Yes, we would like to know that, sire.” The king instructed his attendant
to bring an elephant to them and then asked the blind men to touch it with
their hands. One of them touched the animal’s nose, and the king said,
“That is an elephant.” The second blind man touched its tusk, the third
touched its ear, the fourth touched its head, the fifth touched its back, the
sixth touched its belly, the seventh touched its knee, the eighth touched its
shoulder, the ninth touched a foot, and the tenth touched the tail. Each
time, the king told each blind man, “That is an elephant.”
Then the king had the animal taken away and questioned the blind
men: “What is the elephant like?” The first among them, who had touched
its nose, replied, “The elephant is like the twisted shaft of a cart, sire”;
the second, who had touched its tusk, replied, “It is like a pestle”; the

third, who had touched its ear, replied, “It is like a straw raincoat”; the  
fourth, who had touched its head, replied, “It is like a [large] kettle”; the  
fifth, who had touched its back, replied, “It is like a hilltop”; the sixth, who  
had touched its belly, replied, “It is like a wall”; the seventh, who had touched  
its knee, replied, “It is like a tree”; the eighth, who had touched its shoulder,  
replied, “It is like a pillar”; the ninth, who had touched a foot, replied, “It  
is like a mortar”; and the tenth, who had touched its tail, replied, “It is like  
a rope.” Then the blind men began to argue, saying, “My description is cor-  
rect” and “Your description cannot be correct,” and so on. As there was no  
end to their bickering, they finally came to blows. Seeing this, Darpaṇamukha  
burst into laughter. Then the king uttered the following verse:

A multitude of blind men engage in dispute,  
Competing in their different views,  
Yet it is the body of one and the same elephant.  
Indeed, it is only due to different views that  
Both affirmation and negation arise  
[About one and the same thing].

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

It is just the same with the disputes among the different schools of religion  
and philosophy. They do not know the truth of suffering, or of its causal  
aggregation, or of the cessation of that causal aggregation, or of the path  
of its cessation. Each school, entertaining its own view, disputes with  
others as to what is right and wrong. Insisting that their own view is correct,  
they enter into disputes. If, however, _śramaṇa_ s or _brāhmaṇa_ s understand  
the truth of suffering, and of its causal aggregation, and of the cessation  
of that causal aggregation, and of the essential path of that cessation, they  
will reflect upon the nature of their own thoughts and attain harmony with  
others. Receiving one and the same truth, studying under one and the  
same teacher, associating in one and the same community, integrated like  
water and milk and remaining ever alert to this awareness, they abide in  
peace and happiness.

Then the World-honored One uttered this verse:

If one does not know of life’s suffering
And the causal origins of this suffering,
Or of the possible cessation of this suffering
And the path of cessation of its causal origination,
One loses the opportunity to liberate the mind,
A liberation based on insight ( prajñā )
That clarifies the origins of birth, old age, illness, and death.
If, however, one sees the truth of life’s suffering,
And of the causal origins of this suffering,
And of the cessation of this suffering,
So will one discern the path of cessation
And deliverance of the mind,
The deliverance based on insight
That clarifies the causal aggregate of suffering,
Thereby exhausting the root cause of birth, old age,
Illness, death, and the [cyclic] will-to-becoming.
O bhikṣu s, because of this, you should contemplate the truth of suffering,
the truth of its causal aggregation, the truth of the cessation of suffering,
and the truth of the [eightfold] noble path of cessation and essential lib-
eration from suffering.

#### Article 6: The Demigods

#### ( Asura s)

The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
At the bottom of the great ocean, north of Mount Sumeru, is the capital
of Rāhvasurin, a spacious city extending eighty thousand yojana s long
and wide. The city is well designed, with walls that are three thousand
yojana s high and two thousand yojana s [thick], embellished with seven
railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees. The gateways
are one thousand yojana s in height and the same measure in length and
breadth. The golden wall is endowed with a silver gate, the silver wall
with a golden gate, and so on, with innumerable rare birds singing har-
moniously together, just as before. Located within the great city is an
inner city, sixty thousand yojana s long and wide, that is occupied by the

king of the _asura_ demigods; it is called Lunyumobazha and it is protected  
by sevenfold walls embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental  
nets, and seven lines of trees, all made from the seven kinds of precious  
treasure. The walls are three thousand _yojana_ s high and two thousand  
_yojana_ s thick. The gates are two thousand _yojana_ s high and one thousand  
_yojana_ s wide. The golden wall is endowed with a silver gate, the silver  
wall with a golden gate, and so on, with innumerable rare birds singing  
harmoniously together, just as before.  
Within the inner city is an assembly hall called Saptaśirasā, which is  
protected by sevenfold walls embellished with seven railings, seven orna-  
mental nets, and seven lines of trees, all made from the seven kinds of  
treasure. The building’s foundation is made of pure emerald, and its beams  
and pillars are made from the seven kinds of treasure. The [main] pillar  
is one thousand _yojana_ s in diameter and ten thousand _yojana_ s high.  
Beneath it is the throne called the sudharma seat, heavily engraved with  
inscriptions, and it measures seven hundred _yojana_ s in length and breadth  
and is made from the seven kinds of treasure. There are four doors to the  
assembly hall, each protected by sevenfold walls and stairways further  
embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines  
of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with innu-  
merable rare birds singing harmoniously together, just as before.  
To the north of the assembly hall is the palace that belongs to the king  
of the _asura_ s, which is ten thousand _yojana_ s long and wide. The sevenfold  
palace walls are embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets,  
and seven lines of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so  
on, with innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together, just as  
before. To the east of the assembly hall is a pleasure grove called Śāla, ten  
thousand _yojana_ s long and wide and protected by sevenfold walls embel-  
lished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees,  
all made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with innumerable rare  
birds singing harmoniously together, just as before. To the south of the  
assembly hall is a pleasure grove called Śobhanatara, also ten thousand  
_yojana_ s long and wide. To the west of the hall is a pleasure grove called  
Yāma, again ten thousand _yojana_ s long and wide; to the north of the hall  
is a pleasure grove called Abhilāṣa, which has the same dimensions.

Between the Śāla and Śobhanatara pleasure groves is a tree called Pāri-
jāta; the diameter of its trunk is seven yojana s, its height is one hundred
yojana s, and its branches and leaves spread out as far as fifty yojana s in
every direction. The tree is protected on all sides by sevenfold walls embel-
lished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees,
all made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with innumerable
rare birds singing harmoniously together, just as before. Between the
Yāma and Abhilāṣa pleasure groves is a lake called Upananda, with clean,
cool, and spotlessly clear water. The seven dikes encircling the lake are
built with precious materials, with stone terraces and seven railings, seven
ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees adorned with the seven kinds of
treasure. Four kinds of flowers grow there; their leaves and blossoms
extend up to one yojana in length and width, and their fragrance can be
detected as far away as one yojana. Their stalks form the hub of a wheel
and sap, as sweet as honey, flows out like white milk. Innumerable rare
birds sing harmoniously there, just as before. By the shore of this lake
are pavilions seven stories high, each encircled by seven gated walls with
seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees, all made
from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with innumerable rare birds
singing harmoniously together, just as before.
The palaces occupied by officials serving the asura king are as large
as ten thousand yojana s in length and breadth, down to the smallest, which
are one thousand yojana s long and wide. All the palaces are protected by
sevenfold walls embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets,
and seven lines of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure, and
so on, with innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together, just as
before. The palaces of the asura s are smaller, varying from one thousand
yojana s in length and breadth down to the smallest, which are one hundred
yojana s [long and wide]. These palaces are also protected by sevenfold
walls embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven
lines of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with
innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together, just as before.
To the north of the assembly hall is a stairway made of seven precious
materials, which leads to the palace compound. There are other stairways
that lead to the Śāla, Śobhanatara, Yāma, and Abhilāṣa pleasure groves,

and stairways that lead to the Pārijāta tree, Upananda Lake, and the palaces  
occupied by ministers and minor officials.  
When the _asura_ king wishes to make an excursion to the Śāla pleasure  
grove, he merely thinks of Bhīmacitra, a member of the _asura_ royalty,  
and the latter becomes aware that “King Rāhvasurin has put this thought  
in my mind.” Bhīmacitra immediately dons formal clothing, and riding  
in a richly decorated carriage, surrounded by innumerable attendants,  
arrives before the king and takes his position to one side. The _asura_ king  
thinks of another royal figure, Prarāhvasurin, and he too becomes aware  
that “King Rāhvasurin is calling me.” Prarāhvasurin immediately dons  
formal clothing, and riding in a richly decorated carriage, surrounded by  
innumerable attendants, arrives before the king and takes his position to  
one side. The king then thinks of another royal figure, Yāmarāhvasurin,  
who too becomes aware that “King Rāhvasurin is calling me,” immediately  
dons formal clothing, and riding in a richly decorated carriage, surrounded  
by innumerable attendants, arrives before the king and takes his position  
to one side. The king then thinks of his minister Asurin, who becomes  
aware that “King Rāhvasurin is calling me,” immediately dons formal  
clothing, and riding in a richly decorated carriage, surrounded by innu-  
merable attendants, arrives before the king and takes his position to one  
side. The king now thinks of a minor official, who also becomes aware  
that “King Rāhvasurin is calling me,” immediately dons formal clothing,  
and riding in a richly decorated carriage, surrounded by innumerable atten-  
dants, arrives before the king and takes his position to one side.  
Now King Rāhu of the _asura_ s (Rāhvasurin) dons a richly decorated  
garment, mounts his carriage, and surrounded by innumerable attendants,  
proceeds to the Śāla pleasure grove. When the procession reaches the gate  
the doors are opened by a sudden gust of wind that sweeps over the grounds  
within and blows down flower blossoms into a knee-high mound. Rāh-  
vasurin enters the pleasure grove and enjoys his visit for a day or two,  
and so on, up to a seventh day, when he returns to his palace. When he  
later visits the Śobhanatara, Yāma, and Abhilāṣa pleasure groves, he  
follows the same steps that have been described here.  
King Rāhu of the _asura_ s is always accompanied by five great _asura_ s,  
who guard him closely on all sides. The first is called Tichi, the second

Xiongli, the third Wuyi, the fourth Touju, and the fifth Cuifu. These asura s
guard him at all times. The palace of King Rāhu is not only sits on the
bottom of the great ocean, it also rises to the ocean surface and is held
[above the ocean] by the four powers of wind: a steady wind ( zhufeng ),
a supporting wind ( chifeng ), an immovable wind ( budong ), and a firm
wind ( jiangu ). These four winds hold the great ocean suspended in midair,
ten thousand yojana s above the asura s’ palace, never letting it fall, so that
it is just like a floating cloud. Indeed, such are the great fortune, merits,
and powers that have accrued to the asura king.

#### Article 7: The Four

#### Guardian Gods

The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
To the east of Mount Sumeru, at a distance of a thousand yojana s, is the
abode of the guardian god Dhṛṭarāṣṭra, a city called Xianshangcheng,
which is six thousand yojana s long and wide. The ramparts around the
city are sevenfold and embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental
nets, and seven lines of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure,
and so on, with innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together,
just as before.
To the south of Mount Sumeru, at a distance of a thousand yojana s, is
the abode of the guardian god Virūḍhaka, a city called Sudarśana that meas-
ures six thousand yojana s long and wide. Its ramparts are sevenfold and
embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines
of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure and so on, with innu-
merable rare birds singing harmoniously together, just as before.
To the west of Mount Sumeru, at a distance of a thousand yojana s, is
the abode of the guardian god Virūpākṣa, a city called Chūḍasudarśana,
which is six thousand yojana s long and wide. Its ramparts are sevenfold
and embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven
lines of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure and so on, with
innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together, just as before.
To the north of Mount Sumeru, at a distance of a thousand yojana s, is
the abode of the guardian god Vaiśravaṇa. This king resides in three cities;

the first is called Bhaya (Heyi), the second, Tianjing, and the third, Zhong-  
gui. Each city measures six thousand _yojana_ s long and wide. Their ramparts  
also are sevenfold and embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental  
nets, and seven lines of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure,  
and so on, with innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together,  
just as before.  
To the north of Zhonggui is a pleasure grove called Jiapiyantou, four  
thousand _yojana_ s long and wide, protected by sevenfold walls embellished  
with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees, all  
made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with innumerable rare  
birds singing harmoniously together, just as before. In the middle of this  
pleasure grove is a pond called Nalinni, forty _yojana_ s long and wide, with  
clean and transparent water. The dike [that forms the pond] is made from  
the seven kinds of treasure, and the pond is ringed by stone terraces with  
seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees made from  
the seven kinds of treasure. In the pond are many varieties of shining lotus  
blossoms in blue, yellow, red, white, and variegated hues, whose fragrance  
can be detected as far as half a _yojana_ away. Their stalks form the hub of  
a wheel and the sap, as sweet as honey, flows out like white milk, and  
innumerable rare birds sing harmoniously together, just as before.  
Apart from the palaces of the sun and moon, those of the guardian gods  
are forty _yojana_ s long and wide, protected by sevenfold walls embellished  
with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees, all  
made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with innumerable rare  
birds singing harmoniously together, just as before. The palaces vary in  
size but even the smallest measures five _yojana_ s long and wide.  
From Zhonggui a stairway leads to Xianshangcheng. Another stairway  
leads to Bhaya and Tianjing. Even more stairways lead to Jiapiyantou and  
Nalinni, and to the palaces of the ministers of the four guardian gods.  
When Vaiśravaṇa [in the northern heaven] wishes to enjoy an excursion  
to Jiapiyantou, he first thinks of Dhṛṭarāṣṭra [in the eastern heaven], and  
the latter becomes aware that “Vaiśravaṇa has put this thought in my  
mind.” Dhṛṭarāṣṭra immediately dons formal clothing and rides in a richly  
decorated carriage, surrounded by a host of _gandharva_ demigods, arriving

before Vaiśravaṇa and taking his position to one side. Vaiśravaṇa then
thinks of Virūḍhaka [in the southern heaven], who then becomes aware
that “Vaiśravaṇa is calling me.” He immediately dons formal clothing and
rides in a richly decorated carriage, surrounded by innumerable kumbhāṇḍa
deities, arriving before Vaiśravaṇa and taking his position to one side.
Vaiśravaṇa then thinks of Virūpākṣa [in the western heaven], who becomes
aware that “Vaiśravaṇa is calling me.” Virūpākṣa immediately dons formal
clothing and rides in a richly decorated carriage, surrounded by innumerable
nāga deities, arriving before Vaiśravaṇa and taking his position to one
side. Vaiśravaṇa then thinks of the ministers of the four guardian gods,
and they all become aware that “Vaiśravaṇa is calling me.” Each of them
immediately dons formal clothing and rides in a richly decorated carriage,
surrounded by innumerable deities, arriving before Vaiśravaṇa and taking
a position to one side.
The guardian god Vaiśravaṇa now dons a richly decorated garment,
mounts his carriage, and accompanied by innumerable hosts of deities
proceeds to the pleasure grove. When the procession reaches the Jiapiyan-
tou gate the doors open by a sudden gust of wind that sweeps the ground
within and blows down flower blossoms into a knee-high mound.
Vaiśravaṇa enters the pleasure grove, enjoys his visit for a day or two,
and so on, up to a seventh day, and then returns to his palace. Vaiśravaṇa
is always accompanied by five great spirits, who guard him closely on all
sides. The first is called Pañcāla, the second Daṇḍala, the third Hemabhadra,
the fourth Dīpaṃkara, and the fifth Xiuyilumo. These five spirits guard
him at all times. Indeed, such are the great fortune, merits, and powers
that have accrued to the king of the guardian gods.

#### Article 8: Trāyastriṃśa

#### Heaven

The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
At the summit of Mount Sumeru is the abode of the thirty-three gods,
[Trāyastriṃśa]. This city extends eighty thousand yojana s long and wide,
with sevenfold concentric ramparts that are embellished with seven railings,
seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees, all made from the seven

kinds of treasure. The ramparts are one hundred _yojana_ s high and sixty  
_yojana_ s across at the top, with gates that are sixty _yojana_ s high and thirty  
_yojana_ s across at the top. Every five hundred _yojana_ s from the main gate  
is another gate where five hundred spirits dwell to protect the thirty-three  
gods. The golden wall is adorned with a silver gate, the silver wall is  
adorned with a golden gate, and so on, with innumerable rare birds singing  
harmoniously together, just as before.  
Within the great city is an inner city [called Sudarśana], sixty thousand  
_yojana_ s long and wide. Its sevenfold concentric ramparts are embellished  
with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees, all  
made from the seven kinds of treasure. The ramparts are one hundred  
_yojana_ s high and sixty _yojana_ s across at the top, with gates every five  
hundred _yojana_ s that are sixty _yojana_ s high and thirty _yojana_ s across at  
the top. At each gate five hundred spirits dwell to protect the thirty-three  
gods. The golden wall is adorned with silver gates, [the silver wall with  
golden gates,] the quartz wall with lapis gates, the lapis wall with quartz  
gates, the ruby wall with agate gates, the agate wall with ruby gates, and  
the emerald wall with gates decorated with many kinds of precious stones.  
The railings are decorated in a similar way: the golden railing is adorned  
with ropes made of silver, the silver railing with ropes made of gold, the  
quartz railing with ropes made of lapis, the lapis railing with ropes made  
of quartz, the ruby railing with ropes made of agate, the agate railing with  
ropes made of rubies, and the emerald railing with a variety of precious  
stones. Over these railings are hung decorative nets on which various  
ornaments are attached. From the golden net hangs a silver bell, from the  
silver net hangs a golden bell, from the lapis net hangs a quartz bell, from  
the quartz net hangs a lapis bell, from the ruby net hangs an agate bell,  
from the agate net hangs a ruby bell, and from the emerald net hangs a  
bell inlaid with various precious stones.  
The golden trees have golden trunks and branches, with silver flowers  
and fruit. The silver trees have silver trunks and branches, with golden  
flowers and fruit. The quartz trees have quartz trunks and branches, with  
lapis flowers and leaves, while the lapis trees have lapis trunks and branches  
and quartz flowers and leaves. The ruby trees have ruby trunks and  
branches, with agate flowers and leaves, while the agate trees have agate

trunks and branches and flowers and leaves made of rubies. The emerald
trees have emerald trunks and branches, with flowers and leaves made of
various precious stones.
Each of the seven walls has four gates, one on each side, protected by
barriers. Each wall is topped with a pavilion and veranda and encloses a
bathing pond and pleasure garden filled with various flowers blooming in
a multitude of hues. The verdant trees are laden with abundant flowers and
fruit. Exquisite fragrance arises in all directions, pleasing to human senses;
hawks, wild ducks, male and female mandarin ducks, and a host of rare
birds, numbering in the thousands of species, sing harmoniously together.
In the area outside the inner city is the palace of Irāpatra, lord of the
nāga s; it extends six thousand yojana s long and wide. Its sevenfold walls
are embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven
lines of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with
innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together, just as before.
At the center of Sudarśana is Sudharma Assembly Hall, one hundred
yojana s long and wide, adorned with seven railings, seven ornamental
nets, and seven lines of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure.
The foundation of the hall is pure gold and its roof is made of lapis. The
pillars, ten yojana s in diameter, rise to a height of one hundred yojana s.
Centered beneath them is the throne of the lord of the [thirty-three] gods,
one yojana long and wide, reflecting variegated hues created by combi-
nations of the seven kinds of treasure. The seat of the throne is delicate,
as smooth to the touch as a heavenly garment. On both sides of the throne
are sixteen seats. Four gates, adorned with railings made from the seven
kinds of treasure, provide entrance to the hall. The stairway leading to the
hall is five hundred yojana s across and the gateway is protected by sevenfold
walls embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven
lines of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with
innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together, just as before.
To the north of Sudharma Hall is the palace of the lord of the gods
Indra, which is one thousand yojana s long and wide. The sevenfold palace
walls are embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and
seven lines of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on,
with innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together, just as before.

To the east of the palace is a pleasure grove called Cuse, one thousand  
_yojana_ s long and wide, which is surrounded by sevenfold walls embellished  
with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees, all made  
from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with innumerable rare birds  
singing harmoniously together, just as before. Within this pleasure grove  
are two stone mounds embellished with heavenly gold called Bhadra and  
Subhadra, respectively; their surfaces are as smooth as a heavenly garment.  
To the south of the palace is another pleasure grove, called Citraprīti,  
one thousand _yojana_ s long and wide, which is enclosed by sevenfold walls  
embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of  
trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with innumerable  
rare birds singing harmoniously together, just as before. In this pleasure  
grove are two massive stone mounds embellished with the seven kinds of  
treasure; they are called Dina and Sudina, respectively, and each is fifty  
_yojana_ s long and wide, with surfaces as smooth as a heavenly garment.  
To the west of Sudharma Hall is another pleasure grove, called Za  
(Saṃsarga?), one thousand _yojana_ s long and wide, protected by sevenfold  
walls embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven  
lines of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with  
innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together, just as before. In this  
pleasure grove are two massive stone mounds embellished with the seven  
kinds of treasure, called Sudarśana (Shanjian) and Anusudarśana (Shun -  
shanjian), respectively; each is gilded with heavenly gold, measures fifty  
_yojana_ s long and wide, and has surfaces as smooth as a heavenly garment.  
To the north of Sudharma Hall is another pleasure grove, called Mahā-  
sukha, one thousand _yojana_ s long and wide, protected by sevenfold walls  
embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines  
of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with innu-  
merable rare birds singing harmoniously together, just as before. In this  
pleasure grove are two massive stone mounds, called Sukha (Xi) and  
Mahāsukha (Taxi), respectively, measuring fifty _yojana_ s long and wide,  
embellished with the seven kinds of treasure, each gilded with heavenly  
gold, and whose surfaces are as smooth as a heavenly garment.  
Midway between the Cuse and Citraprīti (?) (Huale) pleasure groves  
is a pond called Nanda, one hundred _yojana_ s long and wide, with clear,

spotless water. The dike forming the pond is made from the seven kinds
of treasure, and the pond is enclosed by stone terraces with seven railings,
seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees, all made from the seven
kinds of treasure. On the four sides of the pond are four stairways with
railings adorned with the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with innu-
merable birds singing harmoniously together, just as before. In the pond
there are many varieties of shining lotus blossoms in blue, yellow, red,
white, and variegated hues, with a fragrance that can be detected as far
away as one yojana. The shade cast by a single leaf [of a lotus blossom]
is as wide as one yojana , and the stalks form the hub of a wheel, with sap,
sweet as honey, flowing out like white milk. Four other pleasure groves
can be found on the four sides of this pond.
Midway between the Saṃsarga and Mahāsukha pleasure groves is a
tree called Pārijāta, seven yojana s in diameter and one hundred yojana s
in height, with branches and leaves spreading in all directions as far as
fifty yojana s. An empty pavilion stands beside this tree, extending five
hundred yojana s in length and breadth and protected by sevenfold walls
embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines
of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with innu-
merable rare birds singing harmoniously together, just as before.
The rest of the palace complex occupies an area one thousand yojana s
[long and wide], protected by sevenfold walls embellished with seven
railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines of trees, all made from
the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with innumerable birds singing
harmoniously together, just as before. Some of the public buildings are
as large as eight or nine hundred yojana s [long and wide], with the smallest
measuring one hundred yojana s [in length and breadth], and all are sur-
rounded by sevenfold walls embellished with seven railings, seven orna-
mental nets, and seven lines of trees, all made from the seven kinds of
treasure, and so on, with innumerable birds singing harmoniously together,
just as before. Some of the small palaces are eighty to one hundred yojana s
[long and wide], and even the smallest measures twelve yojana s [in length
and breadth]. These buildings, too, are surrounded by sevenfold walls
embellished with seven railings, seven ornamental nets, and seven lines

of trees, all made from the seven kinds of treasure, and so on, with innu-  
merable birds singing harmoniously together, just as before.  
On the north side of Sudharma Hall are two stairways that lead to the  
palace of Indra, lord of the gods. To the east of the hall are two stairways  
that lead to the Cuse pleasure grove. Other stairways lead to the Citraprīti,  
Saṃsarga, and Mahāsukha pleasure groves, as well as to Nanda Pond,  
the Pārijāta tree, and the palaces of the other gods, including that of Irāpatra,  
lord of the _nāga_ s.  
When the lord of the gods Śakra (Indra) wishes to make an excursion  
to the Cuse pleasure grove, he has only to think of the thirty-two gods  
over whom he presides and they immediately become aware that “Lord  
Śakra is calling me.” They immediately don formal clothing and ride in  
richly decorated carriages, accompanied by innumerable attendants, arriv-  
ing before Śakra and taking their positions to one side. Again, Indra thinks  
of Irāpatra, lord of the _nāga_ s, and he immediately becomes aware that  
“Lord Śakra is calling me.” Irāpatra is immediately transformed into a  
figure with thirty-three heads, each having six fangs, with seven bathing  
ponds surrounding each fang. In every pond are seven gigantic lotus blos-  
soms that are supported by one hundred leaves, where seven beautiful  
maidens play, making music, singing, and dancing. Having produced this  
supernatural display, the lord of the _nāga_ s approaches Indra and takes his  
position to one side.  
Then Śakra, lord of the gods, puts on a necklace richly decorated with  
precious stones and takes his seat on the main head of Irāpatra, lord of  
the _nāga_ s. Following him, the other gods, sixteen on each side, take their  
seats on Irāpatra’s [thirty-two] other heads. Lord Indra’s procession goes  
to the Cuse pleasure grove, accompanied by innumerable hosts of deities.  
When the procession reaches the gate the doors open by a sudden gust of  
wind that sweeps the ground within and blows down flower blossoms into  
a knee-high mound. Śakra, lord of the gods, then takes his seat on either  
of the two stone mounds called Bhadra and Subhadra, as he pleases. The  
thirty-two gods follow him, taking their seats one after another.  
Some gods cannot join the procession to the pleasure grove and are  
unable to satisfy their five senses. Why is this so? The merits they had

individually accrued from their past conduct differ. Again, some gods can
see the grove but cannot enter it, and are unable to satisfy their five senses.
Why is this so? The merits they had accrued from their past conduct differ.
Again, some gods can see and enter the grove but are unable to satisfy
their five senses. Why is this so? The merits they had accrued from their
past conduct differ. Again, some gods are able to see and enter the grove
and satisfy their five senses. Why is this so? The merits they had accrued
from their past conduct differ. After enjoying their visit for a day or two,
and so on, up to a seventh day, each god then returns to his own palace.
When Śakra, lord of the gods, wishes to visit the other pleasure groves of
Citraprīti, Saṃsarga, and Mahāsukha, he proceeds in exactly the same way.
Why is a pleasure grove called Cuse? It is because one’s body feels
coarse and rough ( cuse ) on entering it. Why is another pleasure grove
called Citraprīti? It is because on entering it one’s body spontaneously
takes on different colors, depending on the scene, satisfying one’s senses.
Why is another pleasure grove called Saṃsarga? On the eighth, fourteenth,
and fifteenth days of each month all the palace ladies except female asura s
are released to join the gods on their excursion and mingle freely. Because
of this, it is called the pleasure-mingling grove. Why is another pleasure
grove called Mahāsukha? Because in it one is bound to experience much
pleasure and delight; hence it is [called] the grove of great acquired joy.
Why is the assembly hall called Sudharma? Because in it one is obliged
to contemplate the supreme nature of the Dharma and, through acquiring
pure happiness, one calls the hall Sudharma (“Good Dharma”). Why is
the tree called Pārijāta? Because a spirit called Manda who lives in this
tree enjoys himself by playing musical instruments at all hours, so it is
called “Passing the Day” (Zhoudu).
Śakra, the lord of the gods, is accompanied by ten great gods who
guard him closely at all times. Who are the ten? They are (1) [the guardians]
Indra, (2) Gopaka, (3) Pilou, (4) Piloupoti, (5) Dhāra, (6) Bala, (7) Jīva,
(8) Lingxidu, (9) Wuluo, and (10) Nantou. Śakra possesses great super-
natural powers as lord of the gods, and the aura of his authority is as has
been described. These [guardians] are held in the highest regard by the
people of Jambudvīpa.

The flowers that grow in water are water lilies, such as the _utpala,  
padma, kumuda, puṇḍarīka,_ and _sugandha;_ they are delicate, fragrant,  
and pristine. The flowers that grow on land belong to the _mokṣaka, cam-  
paka, pātalī, sumanā, vārṣika,_ and _tongnü_ trees. The flowers that grow  
in the palaces of the _asura_ s are water lilies such as the _utpala, padma,  
kumuda,_ and _puṇḍarīka,_ delicate, fragrant, and pristine, and tree flowers  
such as the _shudishajiali, bimbā, mahābimbā, jiajiali, māndāra,_ and _mahā -  
māndāra._ All of these water lilies and tree flowers are greatly appreciated  
by the four guardian gods of heaven, the thirty-three Trāyastriṃśa gods,  
the god Yama, the gods of Tuṣita Heaven, the Nirmāṇarati gods, and the  
Paranirmitavaśavartin gods.  
There are ten laws observed by all the gods: (1) the number of possible  
disappearances is limitless; (2) the number of possible appearances is lim-  
itless; (3) there is no impediment to disappearance; (4) there is no imped-  
iment to appearance; (5) there is no flesh and blood, no skin and bones  
or sinews, in celestial bodies; (6) the impurities of urination or excretion  
do not occur in celestial bodies; (7) celestial bodies experience no fatigue  
or exhaustion; (8) there is no procreation in celestial female bodies; (9)  
celestial eyes do not blink; and (10) celestial bodies can adopt different  
hues at will, changing to blue if one likes blue, to yellow if one likes  
yellow, to red if one likes red, and so on. Those are the ten rules observed  
by heavenly beings. What are the seven skin colors found among human  
beings? (1) Some have a golden complexion, (2) some have a fiery com-  
plexion, (3) some have a blue complexion, (4) some have a yellow com-  
plexion, (5) some have a red complexion, (6) some have a black com-  
plexion, and (7) some have a white complexion. These skin colors are  
also found among the gods as well as the _asura_ s.  
O _bhikṣu_ s, compared to the light of the firefly, the light of a candle is  
superior; compared to candlelight, the light of a torch is superior; compared  
to torchlight, the light of a bonfire is superior; compared to a bonfire, the  
illumination cast by the four guardians’ palaces, castles, necklaces, garments,  
and physical bodies is superior; compared to the light of that illumination,  
the light of the thirty-three gods is superior; compared to the light of the  
thirty-three gods, the light of the god Yama is superior; compared to the

light of the god Yama, the light of the Tuṣita gods is superior; compared
to the light of the Tuṣita gods, the light of the Nirmāṇarati gods is superior;
compared to the light of the Nirmāṇarati gods, the light of the Paranirmi-
tavaśavartin gods is superior; compared to the light of the Paranirmi-
tavaśavartin gods, the light of the Brahmakāyika gods is superior; compared
to the light of the Brahmakāyika gods, the light of the Ābhāsvara gods is
superior; compared to the light of the Ābhāsvara gods, the light of the
Śubhakṛtsna gods is superior; compared to the light of the Śubhakṛtsna
gods, the light of the Puṇyaprasava gods is superior; compared to the light
of the Puṇyaprasava gods, the light of the Asaṃjñika gods is superior;
compared to the light of the Asaṃjñika gods, the light of the Avṛha gods
is superior; compared to the light of the Avṛha gods, the light of the Atapa
gods is superior; compared to the light of the Atapa gods, the light of the
Sudṛśa gods is superior; compared to the light of the Sudṛśa gods, the
light of the Sudarśana gods is superior; compared to the light of the Su -
darśana gods, the light of the Akaniṣṭha gods is superior; compared to the
light of the Akaniṣṭha gods, the light of the Bhūmivaśavartin gods is supe-
rior; compared to the light of the Bhūmivaśavartin gods, the light of the
Buddha is superior. From the firefly’s light up to the Buddha’s illumination,
in comparison with all of these lights, the light of the [Four Noble] Truths
of suffering ( duḥkha ), causal aggregation ( samudaya ), cessation ( nirodha )
of causal aggregation, and the path ( mārga ) of cessation is superior.
Because of this, O bhikṣu s, those who wish to acquire illumination should
seek the light of the [Four Noble] Truths of suffering, causal aggregation,
cessation of causal aggregation, and the path of cessation, engaging them-
selves in the practice of the path.
The people of Jambudvīpa, [south of Mount Sumeru,] are three and a
half hand-to-elbow lengths tall, and their garments should be seven hand-
to-elbow lengths long. The people of Aparagodānīya and of Pūrvavideha,
[west and east of Mount Sumeru, respectively,] are the same, three and a
half hand-to-elbow lengths tall, with garments that are seven hand-to-elbow
lengths long and three and a half hand-to-elbow lengths wide. The people
of Uttarakuru, [north of Mount Sumeru,] are seven hand-to-elbow lengths
tall, and their garments should be fourteen hand-to-elbow lengths long and
seven hand-to-elbow lengths wide, and weigh one ounce (Ch. liang ). The

_asura_ s are one _yojana_ tall, and their garments should be two _yojana_ s long  
and one _yojana_ wide, weighing six _zhu_ (one-quarter of a _liang_ ). The four  
guardian gods of heaven are half a _yojana_ tall, and their garments should  
be one _yojana_ long and half a _yojana_ wide, and weigh half a _liang._ The  
the Trāyastriṃśa gods are one _yojana_ tall, and their garments should be  
two _yojana_ s long and half a _yojana_ s wide, weighing six _zhu._ The god  
Yama is two _yojana_ s tall, and his garments should be four _yojana_ s long  
and two _yojana_ s wide, with a weight of three _zhu_ (one-eighth of a _liang_ ).  
The Tuṣita gods are four _yojana_ s tall, and their garments should be eight  
_yojana_ s long and four _yojana_ s wide, and weigh one and a half _zhu._ The  
Nirmāṇarati gods are eight _yojana_ s tall, and their garments should be six-  
teen _yojana_ s long and eight _yojana_ s wide, weighing half a _zhu._ All the  
other gods should arrange their garments accordingly, depending on their  
[differing] heights.  
The people of Jambudvīpa have a life span of one hundred years, but  
the majority live to less than that, while a small minority live longer. The  
people of Aparagodānīya have a life span of two hundred years, but the  
majority also live to less than that, while a small minority live longer. The  
people of Pūrvavideha have a life span of three hundred years, but the  
majority again live to less than that, while a small minority live longer.  
The people of Uttarakuru have a life span of one thousand years and all  
enjoy fairly equal longevity. Hungry ghosts have a life span of ten thousand  
years, but the majority live to less than that, while a small minority live  
longer. The _nāga_ s and _garuḍa_ s have a life span of an eon, but some may  
live to less than that. The _asura_ s have a life span of one thousand years  
in the celestial scale, but the majority live to less than that, while a small  
minority live longer. The four guardian gods of the heavens have a life  
span of five hundred years in the celestial scale, but most live to less than  
that, while the rest live longer. The Trāyastriṃśa gods have a life span of  
one thousand years in the celestial scale, but again the majority live to less  
than that, while a small minority live longer. The Yama gods have a life  
span of two thousand years in the celestial scale, but again the majority live  
to less than that, while a small minority live longer. The Tuṣita gods have  
a life span of four thousand years in the celestial scale, but again the majority  
live to less than that, while a small minority live longer. The Nirmāṇarati

gods have a life span of eight thousand years in the celestial scale, but
again the majority live to less than that, while a small minority live longer.
The Paranirmitavaśavartin gods have a life span of sixteen thousand years
in the celestial scale, but again the majority live to less than that, while a
small minority live longer. The Brahmakāyika gods have a life span of
one eon, but some may live to less than that. The Ābhāsvara gods have a
life span of two eons, but some may live to less than that. The Śubhakṛtsna
gods have a life span of three eons, but some may live to less than that.
The Bṛhatphala gods have a life span of four eons, but some may live to
less than that. The Asaṃjñisattva gods have a life span of five hundred
eons, but some may live to less than that. The Avṛha gods have a life span
of one thousand eons, but some may live to less than that. The Atapa gods
have a life span of two thousand eons, but some may live to less than that.
The Sudṛśa gods have a life span of three thousand eons, but some may
live to less than that. The Sudarśana gods have a life span of four thousand
eons, but some may live to less than that. The Akaniṣṭha gods have a life
span of five thousand eons, but some may live to less than that. The Ākāśā-
nantyāyatana gods have a life span of ten thousand eons, but some may
live to less than that. The Vijñānānantyāyatana gods have a life span of
twenty-one thousand eons, but some may live to less than that. The Ākiṃ-
canyāyatana gods have a life span of forty-two eons, but some may live
to less than that. The Naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatana gods have a life span
of eighty-four thousand eons, but some may live to less than that.
The foregoing are the [categories of] sentient beings, their life spans,
their worlds, and their respective psychophysical elements ( skandha s) in
the transmigrations that remain subject to the impermanence of birth, old
age, illness, and death.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
All living beings subsist on four kinds of food. What are the four? They
are (1) [regular] food served by hand and with utensils with [proper]
hygiene through washing, bathing, and [wearing clean] clothing; (2) food
created by contact; (3) food created by recollection; and (4) food created
by consciousness. Because sentient beings differ the food on which they
subsist also differs. The people of Jambudvīpa eat rice, wheat, noodles,

fish, and meat to sustain the health of their bodies and they wash, bathe,  
and [wear clean] clothing to maintain hygiene and physical comfort. The  
people of Aparagodānīya and Pūrvavideha also eat rice, wheat, noodles,  
fish, and meat to sustain the health of their bodies and they also wash,  
bathe, and [wear clean] clothing to maintain hygiene and physical comfort.  
The people of Uttarakuru only eat nonglutinous rice that has been naturally  
harvested, which has a heavenly flavor. They eat [this kind of rice] to sus-  
tain the health of their bodies and they also wash, bathe, and [wear clean]  
clothing for physical comfort. The _nāga_ s and _garuḍa_ s eat gigantic turtles,  
alligators, and fish to sustain the health of their bodies and they wash,  
bathe, and [wear clean] clothing for physical comfort. The _asura_ s eat puri-  
fied food to sustain the health of their bodies and they wash, bathe, and  
[wear clean] clothing for physical comfort. The four guardian gods of  
heaven, the Trāyastriṃśa gods, the Yama gods, the Tuṣita gods, the Nir-  
māṇarati gods, and the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods also eat purified food  
to sustain the health of their bodies and they wash, bathe, and [wear clean]  
clothing to maintain hygiene and physical comfort. Gods other than those  
already mentioned subsist in a state of concentration, with happiness and  
delight as their principal food.  
Who are the sentient beings that can subsist on the food created by phys-  
ical contact? [These beings are] those born from eggs. Who are the sentient  
beings that can subsist on conscious recollection? Some beings can sustain  
their existence through conscious recollection. Who are the sentient beings  
that can subsist on thoughts created by consciousness? Beings who suffer  
in the hells and gods who abide in the formless realm subsist on the nour-  
ishment of thoughts created by consciousness.  
The people of Jambudvīpa make their living by trading in gold, silver,  
precious stones, cloth, grain, and slaves. The people of Aparagodānīya  
make their living by bartering cattle, sheep, jewels, and precious stones  
in the marketplace. The people of Pūrvavideha make their living by bar-  
tering pearls, cloth, and grain in the marketplace. The people of Uttarakuru  
do not engage in trade and make their living by themselves. The people  
of Jambudvīpa follow the custom of using negotiation to marry their  
daughters to bridegrooms or to receive brides as wives for their sons. The  
people of Aparagodānīya and of Pūrvavideha follow similar customs,

sending off their daughters to marry bridegrooms and receiving brides
for their sons. The people of Uttarakuru have no marriage customs and
do not marry off daughters or receive brides for their sons. Among nāga s,
garuḍa s, and asura s, males and females also follow the custom of marriage.
The same custom is observed among the four guardian gods of heaven,
the Trāyastriṃśa gods, and so on, to the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods. There
is no such custom, however, among higher gods than those already men-
tioned, because there is no gender difference in those of higher divinity.
The people of Jambudvīpa, male and female, require sexual union.
Through physical contact they fuse positive and negative elements. The
people of Aparagodānīya, of Pūrvavideha, and of Uttarakuru also require
physical contact to fuse positive and negative elements. The nāga s and
garuḍa s are the same, but the asura s can reach the same goal [simply]
by being in close physical proximity to one another and using mutual
awareness. The four guardian gods and the Trāyastriṃśa gods also follow
this method. The Yama gods fuse positive and negative elements just by
being near each other. The Tuṣita gods accomplish the same end just by
holding each other’s hands. The Nirmāṇarati gods accomplish it by staring
at each other, while the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods accomplish it simply
by glancing at each other. Gods beyond those already mentioned do not
experience sexual desire.
When sentient beings have committed evil through thought, speech,
or action they may thus engender the nascent consciousness of a hellish
being, even though their own awareness perishes when their body dissolves
and their life ebbs away. Contingent on that consciousness, name and
form ( nāmarūpa ) arise. Contingent on name and form, the six bases of
cognition ( ṣaḍāyatana ) arise. Again, when sentient beings have committed
evil through acts of body, speech, or mind they may fall into the course
of animal life when their body dissolves and their life ebbs away. Even
though their own awareness has perished, they have engendered the nascent
consciousness of an animal. Contingent on that consciousness, name and
form arise. Contingent on name and form, the six bases of cognition arise.
Again, when sentient beings have committed evil through acts of body,
speech, or mind they may fall into the course of a [hungry] ghost ( preta )
when their body dissolves and their life ebbs away. Even though their

own awareness has perished they have engendered the nascent conscious-  
ness of a [hungry] ghost. Contingent on that consciousness, name and  
form arise. Contingent on name and form, the six bases of cognition arise.  
Again, when sentient beings have accomplished good through thought,  
speech, or action they may be reborn in the course of a human being when  
their body dissolves and their life ebbs away. Even though their own aware-  
ness has perished they have engendered the nascent consciousness of a  
human being. Contingent on that consciousness, name and form arise.  
Contingent on name and form, the six bases of cognition arise. Again,  
when sentient beings have accomplished good through acts of body, speech,  
or mind they may be reborn in the life course of the four guardian gods  
when their body dissolves and their life ebbs away. Even though their own  
awareness has perished they have engendered the nascent heavenly con-  
sciousness of a guardian god. Contingent on that consciousness, name and  
form arise. Contingent on name and form, the six bases of cognition arise.  
When entering a heaven one is like a young child of one to two years  
of age. That child, having been reborn through natural transformation,  
now abides on the lap of a guardian god. The god may say, “This is my  
child,” but the child already possesses the wisdom of his past conduct and  
thinks, “By what good conduct have I been born in this heavenly world?”  
Again the child thinks, “Once, when I was human and accomplished some  
good through acts of body, speech, and mind I accrued some merit, which  
has enabled me to be reborn into this celestial life. If my life should end  
here and I am reborn again among humans, I must work to purify the  
nature of my acts ( _karman_ ) of body, speech, and mind and try still harder  
to accomplish some good.”  
Not long after rebirth the child feels hunger. Immediately a vessel filled  
with pure food containing a hundred heavenly tastes appears. If the child’s  
merit is superior, the meal will consist of white rice; if the child’s merit  
is average, the meal will consist of blue rice; if his or her merit is little,  
the meal will consist of red rice. The food is eaten by hand, and once swal-  
lowed by the child it is immediately digested, like butter thrown into a  
fire. When the meal is finished the child feels thirst, and then a vessel  
filled with nectar appears. If the child’s merit is superior, the juice will be  
white; if the child’s merit is average, it will be blue; and if his or her merit

is little, it will be red. Once the child has drunk [the juice] it is immediately
digested, like butter thrown into a fire. Once the child has finished [the
food and juice] he has already grown into an adult god.
He then goes to a bathing pond to enjoy washing and bathing. Emerging
from the pond, he approaches a tree filled with many fragrances. The tree
bends down and he takes some of the fragrance in his hand and rubs it
onto his body. Then he sees a tree filled with cotton garments. As it bends
down, he takes a garment and puts it on, fitting it to his body. Now he
sees a tree filled with many kinds of ornaments. As it bends down, he
takes a few [ornaments] to brighten his dress. Then he sees a tree filled
with garlands. As it bends down, he takes one and places it upon his head.
Then he sees a tree filled with many kinds of vessels. As it bends down,
he takes one and carries it to a tree filled with fruit. As [the tree of fruit]
bends down, he picks some to taste and eat later. Then he sees a tree filled
with musical instruments. As it bends down, he chooses one and plucks
its strings while singing in a clear, fine voice. Entering a pleasure grove,
he encounters numerous heavenly maidens who cheerfully strum their
instruments and tap their drums to entertain him with song and laughter.
On this sort of excursion the god gives himself over to such entertainments.
When he looks east, he forgets west; when looks west, he forgets east.
Although he once wondered “By what actions have I been born into this
celestial life?” [by now] he has totally forgotten this train of thought while
engaged in the pleasures at hand, and is now surrounded by palace ladies
and retainers.
Again, when sentient beings have accomplished some good through
thought, speech, and action they may be reborn in the life course of the
Trāyastriṃśa gods when their body dissolves and their life ebbs away.
Although their own awareness has perished, they have engendered the
nascent heavenly consciousness of a Trāyastriṃśa god. Contingent on
that consciousness, name and form arise. Contingent on name and form,
the six bases of cognition arise. Entering that heaven, one is like a child
in the Jambudvīpa world, two to three years of age. That child, having
been reborn through natural transformation, now appears on the lap of a
Trāyastriṃśa god, who may say “This is my son” or “This is my daughter,”
just as before. Or, when sentient beings have accomplished some good

through thought, speech, and action they may be reborn as a Yama god  
when their body dissolves and their life ebbs away. Entering that heaven,  
one is like a child of this world, three to four years of age. Or, when sentient  
beings have accomplished some good through thought, speech, and action  
they may be reborn as a Tuṣita god when their body dissolves and their  
life ebbs away. Entering that heaven, one is like a child of this world, four  
to five years of age. Or, when sentient beings have accomplished good  
through thought, speech, and action they may be reborn as a Nirmāṇarati  
god when their body dissolves and their life ebbs away. Entering that  
heaven, one is like a child of this world, five to six years of age. Or, when  
sentient beings have accomplished some good through thought, speech,  
and action they may be reborn as a Paranirmitavaśavartin god when their  
body dissolves and their life ebbs away. Entering that heaven, one is like  
a child of this world, six to seven years of age, just as before.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

There are three days of religious observance in the first half of the month.  
What are the three? They are the eighth, fourteenth, and fifteenth days of  
the month. Why should the eighth be a day of religious observance? On  
the eighth day of each month it is customary for the four guardian gods  
to instruct their messengers, “May you all travel through the human world  
to observe people’s conduct, so that we can be informed as to whether  
they are filial to their parents, respectful to _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, and  
obedient to their elders in society, and also whether they adhere religiously  
to the moral precepts and offer charity to those in need of help.”  
After receiving their orders the messengers travel through the human  
world to investigate in detail whether the people are filial to their parents,  
respectful to _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, obedient to their elders, observant  
of the moral precepts, and generous to those in need of help. If they dis-  
cover that some are neither filial to their parents nor respectful to _śramaṇa_ s  
and _brāhmaṇa_ s, nor are they obedient to their elders, observant of the  
moral precepts, or generous to those in need of help, they return to report,  
“O great kings, in the world of humans it is indeed very difficult to find  
any number of those who are filial to their parents, respectful to _śramaṇa_ s  
and _brāhmaṇa_ s, obedient to their elders, observant of the moral precepts,

and generous to those in need of help.” On hearing this report the guardian
gods reply, “A pity. So is this the real state of affairs? Humans have become
so corrupt that they diminish our prospects in this celestial life while
advancing those of our adversaries, the asura s.”
If the messengers observe that some in this world are filial to their par-
ents, respectful to śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, obedient to their elders,
observant of the moral precepts, and generous to those in need of help,
however, they return and report, “O great kings, in the world of humans
we have witnessed many who are filial to their parents, respectful to śra-
maṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, obedient to their elders, observant of moral pre-
cepts, and generous to those in need of help.” On hearing this report the
guardian gods say, “Splendid, it is a pleasure to hear this! People who are
filial to their parents, respectful to śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, obedient to
their elders, observant of the moral precepts, and generous to those in
need of help increase the sense of well-being that we enjoy in this celestial
life, while weakening that of the asura s.”
Why should the fourteenth be a day of religious observance? On the
fourteenth day of each month it is customary for the four guardian gods
to instruct their crown princes, “May you all travel through the human
world to observe people’s conduct so that we can be informed as to whether
they are filial to their parents, respectful to śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, and
obedient to their elders in society, and also whether they adhere religiously
to the moral precepts and offer charity to those in need of help.”
After receiving their orders, their crown princes travel through the
human world to investigate in detail whether people are filial to their par-
ents, respectful to śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, obedient to their elders,
observant of the moral precepts, and generous to those in need of help.
If they discover that many are neither filial to their parents nor respectful
to śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, nor are they obedient to their elders, observant
of the moral precepts, or generous to those in need of help, the crown
princes return to report, “O great kings, in the world of humans it is indeed
very difficult to find any number of those who are filial to their parents,
respectful to śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, obedient to their elders, observant
of the moral precepts, and generous to those in need of help.” On hearing
this report the guardian gods reply, “A pity. So is this the real state of

affairs? Humans have become so corrupt that they will diminish our  
prospects in this celestial life while advancing those of our adversaries,  
the _asura_ s.”  
If the crown princes observe that some in this world are filial to their  
parents, respectful to _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, obedient to their elders,  
observant of the moral precepts, and generous to those in need of help,  
however, they return to report, “O great kings, in the world of humans  
we have witnessed many who are filial to their parents, respectful to _śra-  
maṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, obedient to their elders, observant of the moral  
precepts, and generous to those in need of help.” On hearing this report  
the guardian gods say, “Splendid, it is a pleasure to hear this! People who  
are filial to their parents, respectful to _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, obedient  
to their elders, observant of the moral precepts, and generous to those in  
need of help increase the sense of well-being that we enjoy in this celestial  
life, while weakening that of the _asura_ s.” Because of this, the fourteenth  
day of the month is held as a day of religious observance.  
Why should the fifteenth be a day of religious observance? On the fif-  
teenth day it is customary for the four guardian gods to travel themselves  
through the human world to observe people’s conduct and to inform Śakra  
as to whether they are filial to their parents, respectful to _śramaṇa_ s and  
_brāhmaṇa_ s, and obedient to their elders in society, and also whether they  
adhere religiously to the moral precepts and provide charity to those in  
need of help.  
If they discover, however, that not many in the human world are filial  
to their parents, respectful to _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, obedient to their  
elders, observant of the moral precepts, and generous to those in need of  
help, the four guardian gods return to Sudharma Hall and report to Śakra,  
lord of the gods, “O lord, in the world of humans it is indeed very difficult  
to find any number of those who are filial to their parents, respectful to  
_śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, obedient to their elders, observant of the moral  
precepts, and generous to those in need of help.” Hearing this report, the  
Trāyastriṃśa gods exclaim, “A pity. So is this the real state of affairs?  
Humans have become so corrupt that they will diminish our prospects in  
this celestial life, while advancing those of our adversaries, the _asura_ s.”

If the four guardian gods observe that people in this world are filial to
their parents, respectful to śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, obedient to their
elders, observant of the moral precepts, and generous to those in need of
help, however, they return to Śakra, lord of the gods, to report, “O lord,
in the world of humans we have witnessed many who are filial to their
parents, respectful to śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, obedient to their elders,
observant of the moral precepts, and generous to those in need of help.”
Hearing this report, the Trāyastriṃśa gods exclaim in delight, “Splendid!
Humans who are filial to their parents, respectful to śramaṇa s and brāh-
maṇa s, obedient to their elders, observant of the moral precepts, and gen-
erous to those in need of help increase the sense of well-being that we
enjoy, while weakening that of the asura s.” Because of this, the fifteenth
day of the month is held as a day of religious observance.
At that moment, wishing to renew the gods’ delight, Śakra uttered the
following verse:
Those who keep the eighth, fourteenth, and fifteenth
As days of religious observance
Are to be considered identical to me.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
Even though this verse was uttered by Śakra, lord of the gods, it should
not be generally accepted, nor is it a good teaching. I consider it to be
inappropriate. Why? Indra, lord of the gods, has yet to exhaust desire,
hatred, and delusion. He is not yet free from the sorrow and suffering of
birth, old age, illness, and death. I assert that he has not separated himself
from the source of suffering.
If, however, any of my disciples eliminate the destructive force of his
defilements ( sāsrava ), perfectly terminating them, and accomplish all that
must be done to discard burdens, acquire advantage, and exhaust all attach-
ment to the forms of existence, thus realizing complete liberation [from
the state of suffering], he would then be entitled to utter the same verse:
Those who keep the eighth, fourteenth, and fifteenth
As days of religious observance
Are to be considered identical to me.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

When such a disciple utters the verse it should be accepted as a good  
teaching, and I consider it to be appropriate. Why? Because that disciple  
has exhausted desire, hatred, and delusion and is free from the sorrow  
and suffering of birth, old age, illness, and death. I assert that he is liberated  
from the source of suffering.

The Buddha continued his discourse to the _bhikṣu_ s:

The houses and residences where people live are all, without exception,  
occupied by spirits. [Certainly] there is no house or residence where no  
spirit abides. Spirits are invariably there in every street and crossroads,  
in butcher shops as well as cemetery mounds, leaving no places [where  
there are no spirits] at all. Now, insofar as a spirit dwells in a certain place,  
its name is derived from that place of attachment. Some spirits obtain  
their names from the names of individual humans. Others obtain their  
names from the names of villages, cities, countries, or regions, or moun-  
tains, rivers, [and so on].

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

All trees, even the smallest [whose trunk is only] the size of an axle, are  
possessed by guardian spirits. There is no tree whatsoever that is without  
a residing spirit. Each and every man or woman, from the very beginning,  
has a guardian spirit who keeps watch [over them] throughout their lifetime.  
When their death approaches, it is their guardian spirit who takes hold at  
the end of their life.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

If a heretic should say, “Venerables, if you suppose that every man or  
woman, from the beginning of life, has a guardian spirit who keeps watch  
[over them] throughout their lifetime, and when their death approaches  
it is that guardian spirit who takes hold at the end of their life, I would  
like to ask: Why does it happen that some people are troubled by their  
[guardian] spirits, while others are not at all influenced by them?” If a  
heretic should say this, you should reply as follows: “Some people commit  
wrongs. Influenced by wrong, inverted views, they commit offenses against

the ten norms [of conduct]. Such people, whether a hundred or a thousand
of them altogether, have only a single guardian spirit to look out for all of
them. Just as a herd of sheep or cattle, a hundred or a thousand in number,
likewise has only one shepherd to guard them—it is like that. Committing
wrongs, influenced by wrong and inverted views, one has only partial pro-
tection from a guardian spirit, as one of a hundred or a thousand. On the
other hand, if one does good deeds, and if upholding right views and believ-
ing in right action he or she complies with the ten norms of conduct, that
person will be protected by a hundred or a thousand guardian spirits. Just
as the king of a country or his minister is protected by a hundred or a thou-
sand guards, those who engage in good behavior and comply with the ten
norms of conduct are watched over by a hundred or a thousand guardian
spirits. It is because of these different causal conditions that some people
are troubled by spirits while others are not at all influenced by them.”
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
The people of Jambudvīpa people exceed [the capabilities of] the people
of [Apara]godānīya in three respects. What are the three? First, since they
are valiant and endowed with [good] memory, they are able to create
karmic actions. Second, since they are valiant and endowed with [good]
memory, they are able to concentrate on the practice of austerity. Third,
since they are valiant and endowed with [good] memory, they are able to
contribute to the appearance of the Buddha in their land. In these three
ways, the people of Jambudvīpa are considered superior to the people of
[Apara] godānīya. The people of [Apara]godānīya, however, exceed [the
capabilities of] the people of Jambudvīpa in three respects. What are the
three? First, they possess many more head of cattle. Second, they possess
many more sheep. Third, they possess many more precious jewels. In
these three ways, the people of [Apara]godānīya are considered superior
to the people of Jambudvīpa.
The people of Jambudvīpa also exceed [the capabilities of] the people
of Pūrvavideha in three respects. What are the three? First, since they are
valiant and endowed with [good] memory, they are able to create karmic
actions. Second, since they are valiant and endowed with [good] memory,
they are able to concentrate on the practice of austerity. Third, since they

are valiant and endowed with [good] memory, they are able to contribute  
to the appearance of the Buddha in their land. In these three ways, the  
people of Jambudvīpa are considered superior to the people of Pūrvavideha.  
The people of Pūrvavideha, however, exceed [the capabilities of] the  
people of Jambudvīpa in three respects. What are the three? First, their  
land is vast and expansive. Second, their land is magnificent. Third, their  
soil is exceedingly rich. In these three ways, the people of Pūrvavideha  
are considered superior to the people of Jambudvīpa.  
The people of Jambudvīpa also exceed [the capabilities of] the people  
of Uttarakuru in three respects. What are the three? First, since they are  
valiant and endowed with [good] memory, they are able to create karmic  
actions. Second, since they are valiant and endowed with [good] memory,  
they are able to concentrate on the practice of austerity. Third, since they  
are valiant and endowed with [good] memory, they are able to contribute  
to the appearance of the Buddha in their land. In these three ways, the  
people of Jambudvīpa people are considered superior to the people of  
Uttarakuru. The people of Uttarakuru, however, exceed [the capabilities  
of] the people of Jambudvīpa in three respects. What are the three? First,  
they have no family possessions and thus little to which to become attached.  
Second, they have no personal possessions. Third, they have a life span  
of precisely one thousand years. In these three ways, the people of  
Uttarakuru people are considered superior to the people of Jambudvīpa.  
The people of Jambudvīpa also exceed [the capabilities of] hungry  
ghosts ( _preta_ s) in the same three ways, whereas the hungry ghosts [are  
superior to] the people of Jambudvīpa in three ways. What are the three?  
First, their life span; second, their physical stature; and third, their tolerance  
of others’ actions. In these three ways, they are considered superior to the  
people of Jambudvīpa. The people of Jambudvīpa also exceed [the capa-  
bilities of] _nāga_ s and _garuḍa_ s in the same three ways, whereas the latter  
[are superior to] the people of Jambudvīpa in three ways. What are the  
three? First, their life span; second, their physical stature; and third, their  
palaces. In these three ways, they are considered superior to the people  
of Jambudvīpa. The people of Jambudvīpa also exceed [the capabilities  
of] the _asura_ s in the same three ways, whereas the _asura_ s [are superior  
to] the people of Jambudvīpa in three ways. What are the three? First,

they possess grand and lofty palaces; second, they possess [grand] palatial
furnishings and embellishments; and third, their hygiene and cleanliness.
In these three ways, they are considered superior to the people of Jambud-
vīpa. The people of Jambudvīpa also exceed [the capabilities of] the four
guardian gods in the same three ways, whereas the four guardian gods
[are superior to] the people of Jambudvīpa in three ways. What are the
three? First, their life span; second, their attractiveness; and third, the
variety of pleasures they experience. In these three ways, they are con-
sidered superior to the people of Jambudvīpa. The people of Jambudvīpa
also exceed [the capabilities of] the gods of the Trāyastriṃśa, Yama, Tuṣita,
Nirmāṇarati, and Paranirmitavaśavartin Heavens in the same three ways,
whereas those gods [are superior to] the people of Jambudvīpa in three
ways. What are the three? First, their life span; second, their attractiveness;
and third, the variety of pleasures they experience. In these three ways,
they are considered superior to the people of Jambudvīpa.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
There are twelve kinds of sentient beings in the realm of desire. What are
the twelve? They are (1) hell beings, (2) animals, (3) hungry ghosts, (4)
humans, (5) asura s, (6) the guardian gods, (7) the Trāyastriṃśa gods, (8)
the Yama gods, (9) the Tuṣita gods, (10) the Nirmāṇarati gods, (11) the
Para nir mita vaśavartin gods, and (12) the evil ones (Pāpīyas). There are
twenty-two kinds of sentient beings in the realm of form: (1) the Brah-
makāyika gods, (2) the Brahmapurohita gods, (3) the Brahmagaṇa gods,
(4) the Mahā brahmā gods, (5) the Ābhāsvara gods, (6) the Parīttābha gods,
(7) the Apramāṇābha gods, (8) Ābhā, (9) the Śubha gods, (10) the Parīt-
taśubha gods, (11) the Apramāṇaśubha gods, (12) the Śubhakṛtsna gods
(13) the Anabhraka gods, (14) the Parītta gods, (15) the Apramāṇa gods
(16) the Bṛhatphala gods, (17) the Asaṃjñi gods (18) the Avṛha gods, (19)
the Atapa gods, (20) the Sudṛśa gods, (21) the Sudarśana gods, and (22)
the Akaniṣṭha gods. There are four kinds of sentient beings in the formless
realm: (1) the Ākāśajñā gods, (2) the Vijñānajña gods, (3) the Ākiṃcanajña
gods, and (4) the Naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyātana gods.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:

There are four great divinities. What are the four? They are the gods of (1)  
earth, (2) water, (3) wind, and (4) fire. The goddess of earth once mistakenly  
thought, “There is no water, wind, or fire in [my domain of the] earth.” I  
immediately went to her and said, “Is it true that you think there is no  
water, wind, or fire in the earth?” The earth goddess replied, “Yes, there  
is no water, wind, or fire in the earth.” I then said, “You should not think  
that there is no water, wind, or fire in the earth and ground. Why? Because  
there is water, there is wind, and there is fire in the earth. It is only because  
of the great number of elements in the earth and ground that it is identified  
with its [own] name.”

The Buddha continued:

I continued to teach the earth goddess, gradually removing her wrong  
views. She was encouraged, helped, and delighted with the doctrine of  
charity, the doctrine of morality, and the doctrine of rebirth in heaven,  
and learned to shun desires as temptations into foul and impure conduct.  
She began to perceive the defilements of passion ( _kāmānāṃ kleśa_ ) as the  
obstacle, and I commended the path of distancing oneself from both pleas-  
ure and suffering as the necessary and best [means to salvation]. I observed  
then that her mind had become calm, open, receptive, and ready to be  
educated. So, in accordance with the rule followed by all buddhas, I  
expounded on her behalf the [Four] Noble Truths of suffering ( _ārya-  
duḥkha-satya_ ), the cause of suffering ( _ārya-duḥkha-samudaya-satya_ ), the  
cessation of suffering ( _ārya-duḥkha-nirodha-satya_ ), and the necessary  
path of cessation ( _ārya-duḥkha-nirodha-gāminī-mārga-satya_ ). Then, with  
pure and genuine faith, like white cloth that can easily be dyed any color,  
the earth goddess separated herself from all her defilements and acquired  
indisputable insight ( _ārya-dharma-cakṣus-viśuddha_ ) into the nature of  
the Dharma. Realizing the Dharma as she visualized it, she resolved to  
abide in the right path ( _niyata-vyavasthita_ ) without any retrogression, and  
realized the state of fearlessness ( _vaiśāradya_ or _abhaya_ ). She then said  
to me, “Now I humbly take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.  
May Your Holiness grant me permission to become a lay devotee. From  
this moment until the end of life I will refrain from taking life, I will  
refrain from taking what is not given, I will refrain from immoral sexual

conduct, I will refrain from speaking falsehoods, and I will refrain from
ingesting intoxicants.”
The Buddha continued:
Once, when the water goddess mistakenly thought, “There is no earth,
wind, or fire in [my domain of] water,” the earth goddess immediately
went to her and said, “Is it true that you think there is no earth, wind, or
fire in water?” The [water] goddess replied, “Yes, there is no earth, wind,
or fire in water.” The earth goddess then said, “You should not think that
there is no earth, wind, or fire in water. Why? Because there is earth, there
is wind, and there is fire in water. It is only because of the great number
of elements in water that it is identified with its [own] name.”
The earth goddess then continued to teach the water goddess, gradually
removing her wrong views. She was encouraged, helped, and delighted
with the doctrine of charity, the doctrine of morality, and the doctrine of
rebirth in heaven, and learned to shun desires as temptations into foul and
impure conduct. She began to perceive the defilements of passion as the
obstacle and to understand the path of distancing oneself from both pleasure
and suffering as the necessary and best [means to salvation]. The earth
goddess then observed that the mind of the water goddess had become
calm, open, receptive, and ready to be educated. Then, in accordance with
the rule followed by all buddhas, the earth goddess expounded on her
behalf the [Four] Noble Truths of suffering, the cause of suffering, the
cessation of suffering, and the necessary path of cessation. Then with pure
and genuine faith, like white cloth that can easily be dyed any color, the
water goddess separated herself from all her defilements and acquired
indisputable insight into the nature of the Dharma. Realizing the Dharma
as she visualized it, she resolved to abide in the right path without any
retrogression, and realized the state of fearlessness. The water goddess
then said to the earth goddess, “Now I humbly take refuge in the Buddha,
Dharma, and Sangha. May I be permitted to become a lay devotee in the
right Dharma. From this moment until the end of life I will refrain from
taking life, I will refrain from taking that which is not given, I will refrain
from immoral sexual conduct, I will refrain from speaking falsehoods,
and I will refrain from ingesting intoxicants.”

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

Once, when the fire goddess mistakenly thought, “There is no earth, water,  
or wind in [my domain of] fire,” the earth and water goddesses immediately  
went to her and said, “Is it true that you think there is no earth, water, or  
wind in fire?” The fire goddess replied, “Yes, there is no earth, water, or  
wind in fire.” The earth and water goddesses then said, “You should not  
think that there is no earth, water, or wind in fire. Why? Because there is  
earth, there is water, and there is wind in fire. It is only because of the  
great number of elements in fire that it is identified with its [own] name.”  
The earth and water goddesses then continued to teach the fire goddess,  
gradually removing her wrong views. She in turn was encouraged, helped,  
and delighted with the doctrine of charity, the doctrine of morality, and  
the doctrine of rebirth in heaven, and learned to shun desires as temptations  
into foul and impure conduct. She began to perceive the defilements of  
passion as the obstacle, and to understand the path of distancing oneself  
from both pleasure and suffering as the necessary and best [means to sal-  
vation]. The earth and water goddesses then observed that the mind of  
the fire goddess had become calm, open, and receptive, ready to be edu-  
cated. Then, in accordance with the rule followed by all buddhas, they  
expounded on her behalf the [Four] Noble Truths of suffering, the cause  
of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the necessary path of cessation.  
Then with pure and genuine faith, like white cloth that can easily be dyed  
any color, the fire goddess separated herself from all her defilements and  
acquired indisputable insight into the nature of the Dharma. Realizing the  
Dharma as she visualized it, she resolved to abide in the right path without  
any retrogression and realized the state of fearlessness. The fire goddess  
then said to the earth and water goddesses, “Now I humbly take refuge  
in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. May I be permitted to become a lay  
devotee in the right Dharma. From this moment until the end of life I will  
refrain from taking life, I will refrain from taking that which is not given,  
I will refrain from immoral sexual conduct, I will refrain from speaking  
falsehoods, and I will refrain from ingesting intoxicants.”

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

Once, when the wind goddess mistakenly thought, “There is no earth,
water, or fire in [my domain of] wind,” the goddesses of earth, water, and
fire immediately went to her and said, “Is it true that you think there is
no earth, water, or fire in wind?” The wind goddess replied, “Yes, there
is no earth, water, or fire in wind.” The three other goddesses said to the
wind goddess, “You should not think that there is no earth, water, or fire
in wind. Why? Because there is earth, there is water, and there is fire in
wind. It is only because of the great number of elements in wind that it
is identified with its [own] name.”
The goddesses of earth, water, and fire then continued to teach the
water goddess, gradually removing her wrong views. She was encouraged,
helped, and delighted with the doctrine of charity, the doctrine of morality,
and the doctrine of rebirth in heaven, and learned to shun desires as temp-
tations into foul and impure conduct. She began to perceive the defilements
of passion as the obstacle and to understand the path of distancing oneself
from both pleasure and suffering as the necessary and best [means to sal-
vation]. The three goddesses then observed that the mind of the wind god-
dess had become calm, open, and receptive, ready to be educated. Then,
in accordance with the rule followed by all buddhas, they expounded on
her behalf the [Four] Noble Truths of suffering, the cause of suffering,
the cessation of suffering, and the necessary path of cessation. Then with
pure and genuine faith, like white cloth that can easily be dyed any color,
the wind goddess separated herself from all her defilements and acquired
indisputable insight into the nature of the Dharma. Realizing the Dharma
as she visualized it, she resolved to abide in the right path without any
retrogression and realized the state of fearlessness. Then the wind goddess
said to the goddesses of earth, water, and fire, “Now I humbly take refuge
in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. May I be permitted to become a lay
devotee in the right Dharma. From this moment until the end of life I will
refrain from taking life, I will refrain from taking that which is not given,
I will refrain from immoral sexual conduct, I will refrain from speaking
falsehoods, and I will refrain from ingesting intoxicants. From this moment
I will disturb no one and will treat everyone with benevolence.”
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:

There are four kinds of clouds. What are the four? They are (1) white, (2)  
black, (3) red, and (4) pink. White clouds are permeated by earth elements;  
black clouds are permeated by water; red clouds are permeated by fire; and  
pink clouds are permeated by wind. Clouds are found ten, twenty, thirty,  
forty, or [even] four thousand _li_ [high], except at the beginning and end of  
an eon ( _kalpa_ ), when they rise as high as Ābhāsvara Heaven.  
There are four kinds of lightning. What are the four? The lightning of  
the eastern region is called Bodily Light; that of the southern region is called  
Difficult to Damage; that of the western region is called Flowing Fire; and  
that of the northern region is called Steady Light. How and why does light-  
ning occur in the midair clouds? At times, Bodily Light touches Difficult  
to Damage. At times, Bodily Light touches Flowing Fire. At times, Bodily  
Light touches Steady Light. At times, Difficult to Damage touches Steady  
Light. At times, Difficult to Damage touches Flowing Fire. At times, Difficult  
to Damage touches Bodily Light. At times, Flowing Fire touches Steady  
Light. Because of these occurrences, lightning arises in the midair clouds.  
Again, how and why does thunder occur in the midair clouds? At times,  
the earth element touches the water element in midair. At times, the earth  
element touches the fire element in midair. At times, the earth element  
touches the wind element in midair. At times, the water element touches  
the fire element. At times, the water element touches the wind element.  
Because of these occurrences, thunder resounds through midair.  
The soothsayer of rain considers that there are five factors affecting  
rainfall. This means that one cannot predict the arrival of rain with any  
certainty and will likely remain troubled. What are the five factors? (1)  
When thunder and lightning in the clouds lead to a prediction of rain, the  
clouds are consumed by overwhelming fire and no rain issues. (2) When  
thunder and lightning in the clouds lead to a prediction of rain, a great  
storm arises and blows all the clouds away. (3) When thunder and lightning  
in the clouds lead to a prediction of rain, the _asura_ s gather all the floating  
clouds within the confines of the ocean, leaving the predictor [of rainfall]  
anxious and troubled. (4) When thunder and lightning in the clouds lead  
to a prediction of rain, the master of clouds and that of rain, being undis-  
ciplined, indulge in sexual conduct that does not allow the rain to fall,  
leaving the predictor [of rainfall] anxious and troubled. (5) When thunder

and lightning in the clouds lead to a prediction of rain, the heavens do not
release the rain because people are undisciplined, unrighteous, wanton,
and influenced by avarice, jealousy, misery, and wrong views. Because
of this, the predictor [of rainfall] is left anxious and troubled. These are
the five factors that allow no soothsayer to know or predict the coming
of rain with any certainty.

#### Article 9: Three Disasters

The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
There are four kinds of events that occur over an immeasurably long
period of time, which cannot be measured in days, months, or years. What
are they? (1) When disasters [continually] occur, portending the destruction
of the world, the intervening period is immeasurably long and cannot be
enumerated in days, months, or years. (2) When this world has finally
been destroyed, the intervening period, a vast emptiness in the absence
of the world, is immeasurably long and cannot be enumerated in days,
months, or years. (3) When heaven and earth first appear and begin to be
formed, the intervening period is immeasurably long and cannot be enu-
merated in days, months, or years. (4) When heaven and earth have taken
form, the period of the world’s constant, indestructible presence is immea-
surably long and cannot be enumerated in days, months, or years. These
four periods are immeasurably long and cannot be enumerated in years.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
There are three kinds of disasters in this world. What are they? (1) Disaster
by fire, (2) disaster by water, and (3) disaster by wind. With these disasters,
know that there are upper limits with respect to the regions affected, namely,
(1) Ābhāsvara Heaven, (2) Śubhakṛtsna Heaven, and (3) Bṛhatphala Heaven.
Disasters by fire can reach as far as Ābhāsvara Heaven and no farther. Dis-
asters by water can reach as far as Śubhakṛtsna Heaven and no farther.
Disasters by wind can reach as far as Bṛhatphala Heaven and no farther.
What is a disaster caused by fire? Every person in the world was once
fully engaged in practicing the right Dharma, abiding therein without
deviation, and they naturally adhered to the ten norms of conduct. One

person, while adhering to these norms, attained the second meditative  
state of absorption and [suddenly] ascended in midair to continue on the  
path of disciples ( _śrāvakayāna_ ), the path of heaven, and the path of Brahmā.  
In a distinct voice, he said, “O Venerables, you must know that there is  
no awareness of an object or of any subjective action, only [overwhelming]  
joy and bliss as the second state of absorption emerges—joy and bliss are  
the second state of concentration!” When the others heard him, they looked  
up and said, “Very well. Very well, sir. Will you expound for our sake the  
path that leads to this second state of absorption in which no awareness  
of an object or any subjective action remains?” The practitioner responded  
to their request, expounding the path that leads to the state of absorption  
without awareness of either object or subject.  
Hearing this exhortation, the people of this world decided to attain the  
second meditative state of absorption, and when their bodies dissolved  
and their lives came to an end they were born in Ābhāsvara Heaven. Then  
all the sentient beings whose transgressions had been fully expiated in  
the hell realms were reborn in the human world, and they too took up the  
practice leading to the second meditative state of absorption; when their  
bodies dissolved and their lives came to an end they were born in Ābhā -  
svara Heaven. In a similar manner, sentient beings who had been in the  
animal realm or in the realms of the hungry ghosts, the _asura_ s, the four  
guardian gods, the Trāyastriṃśa gods, the Yama gods, the Nirmāṇarati  
gods, the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods, and [the gods of] Brahmā Heaven  
all came to be reborn in the human world after their lives ended in their  
respective realms. They too took up the practice leading to the second  
meditative state of absorption, and upon the dissolution of their bodies  
and the end of life they were born in Ābhāsvara Heaven.  
Because of this causal nexus, when the hell realms ended so did the  
realms of the [hungry] ghosts, the _asura_ s, and so on, up to Brahmā Heaven.  
In other words, as the end of the world approached all the residents of the  
hells had already died, followed by the deaths of all the animals. When  
all the animals had died, the deaths of all the hungry ghosts followed.  
When all the ghosts were dead, the deaths of all the _asura_ s followed.  
When the _asura_ s were all dead, the deaths of the four guardian gods fol-  
lowed. When the four guardian gods [and their retainers] were all dead,

the deaths of the Trāyastriṃśa gods followed. When the Trāyastriṃśa
gods were all dead, the deaths of the Yama gods followed. When the Yama
gods were all dead, the deaths of the Tuṣita gods followed. When the
Tuṣita gods were all dead, the deaths of the Nirmāṇarati gods followed.
When the Nirmāṇarati gods were all dead, the deaths of the Paranirmi-
tavaśavartin gods followed. When the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods were
all dead, the deaths of the Brahmā gods followed. When the Brahmā gods
were all dead, only then did all the humans die, as there were no sentient
beings left. When all the humans had died, no one remained. The world
was about to be destroyed, an incipient disaster. Soon there was no rain and
each and every [blade of] grass, plant, and tree withered away.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
As a result, you must know that “everything impermanent is bound for
decay and destruction; hence there is nothing on which one can hold to
or rely. The psychophysical elements ( skandha s) that perdure through the
influence of one’s defilements are to be abhorred. You must seek the path
of transcendence out of this world and liberation from it.”
After an indeterminate length of time a great black storm blew up, vio-
lently agitating the ocean. The entire body of water, to a depth of eighty-
four thousand yojana s, was pulled apart and split in two. The sun, entering
its palace on the mid-slope of Mount Sumeru, hovered at a height of forty-
two thousand yojana s above the ground for two consecutive days. Now,
when the sun heats the world by shining continuously for two days, all
the water that remains in gutters and drain spouts, small brooks and streams,
wherever it may be, bakes and evaporates without exception.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
Because of this, you must realize that “everything impermanent is bound
for decay and destruction; hence there is nothing on which one can hold
to or rely. The psychophysical elements that perdure through the influence
of one’s defilements are to be abhorred. You must seek the path of tran-
scendence out of this world and liberation from it.”
After some time, another great black storm blew up, violently agitating
the ocean. The entire body of water, to a depth of eighty-four thousand

_yojana_ s, was pulled apart and split in two. The sun, entering its palace on  
the mid-slope of Mount Sumeru, hovered at a height of forty-two thousand  
_yojana_ s above the ground for three consecutive days. Now, when the sun  
heats the world by shining continuously for three days, all the water in  
large rivers, such as the Gaṅgā (Ganges), Yamunā, Poluo, Aciravatī, Amo-  
qie, Sindhu, and Gushe, wherever [such rivers] may be, bakes and evap-  
orates without exception. Because of this, you must realize that “everything  
impermanent is bound for decay and destruction; hence there is nothing on  
which one can hold to or rely. The psychophysical elements that perdure  
through the influence of one’s defilements are to be abhorred. You must  
seek the path of transcendence out of this world and liberation from it.”  
After some time, another great black storm blew up, violently agitating  
the ocean. The entire body of water, to a depth of eighty-four thousand  
_yojana_ s, was pulled apart and split in two. The sun, entering its palace on  
the mid-slope of Mount Sumeru, hovered at a height of forty-two thousand  
_yojana_ s above the ground for four consecutive days. Now, when the sun  
heats the world by shining continuously for four days, all the spring-fed  
water that pools in _utpala, kumuda,_ or _puṇḍarīka_ lotus ponds, as well as  
every other pond measuring fifty _yojana_ s in length and breadth or less, and  
which collects in lakes such as Sifangyan, the great Anavatapta, and the  
great Sudarśana, wherever [such ponds and lakes] may be, bakes and evap-  
orates without exception. Because of this, you must realize that “everything  
impermanent is bound for decay and destruction; hence there is nothing on  
which one can hold to or rely. The psychophysical elements that perdure  
through the influence of one’s defilements are to be abhorred. You must  
seek the path of transcendence out of this world and liberation from it.”  
After some time, another great black storm blew up, violently agitating  
the ocean. The entire body of water, to a depth of eighty-four thousand  
_yojana_ s, was pulled apart and split in two. The sun, entering its palace on  
the mid-slope of Mount Sumeru, hovered at a height of forty-two thousand  
_yojana_ s above the ground for five consecutive days. Now, when the sun  
heats the world by shining continuously for five days, all the water in the  
great ocean gradually shrinks, receding [from the shore] by as much as  
seven hundred _yojana_ s. Because of this, you must realize that “everything  
impermanent is bound for decay and destruction; hence there is nothing on

which one can hold to or rely. The psychophysical elements that perdure
through the influence of one’s defilements are to be abhorred. You must
seek the path of transcendence out of this world and liberation from it.”
The water in the great ocean continued to shrink and its depth dropped
from seven hundred yojana s to six hundred, four hundred, and still further,
until it reached a depth of one hundred yojana s. Because of this, you must
realize that “everything impermanent is bound for decay and destruction;
hence there is nothing on which one can hold to or rely. The psychophysical
complexes that perdure through the influence of one’s defilements are to
be abhorred. You must seek the path of transcendence out of this world
and liberation from it.”
Then the water in the great ocean water evaporated even further, and
its depth went from seven yojana s to six, five, and on down, until it was
only one yojana deep.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
Because of this, you must realize that “everything impermanent is bound
for decay and destruction; hence there is nothing on which one can hold
to or rely. The psychophysical complexes that perdure through the influence
of one’s defilements are to be abhorred. You must seek the path of tran-
scendence out of this world and liberation from it.”
After that, the water in the great ocean continued to evaporate, going
from a depth of seven tāla trees, to six, five, and on down, until it was
only as deep [as the height] of a single tāla tree.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
Because of this, you must realize that “everything impermanent is bound
for decay and destruction; hence there is nothing on which one can hold
to or rely. The psychophysical elements that perdure through the influence
of one’s defilements are to be abhorred. You must seek the path of tran-
scendence out of this world and liberation from it.”
Then the ocean water became rapidly shallower, going from the height
of seven human beings to six, five, four, three, two, one, and then it dropped
to the level of a person’s waist, then the knee, and finally the ankle.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

Because of this, you must realize that “everything impermanent is bound  
for decay and destruction; hence there is nothing on which one can hold  
to or rely. The psychophysical elements that perdure through the influence  
of one’s defilements are to be abhorred. You must seek the path of tran-  
scendence out of this world and liberation from it.”  
Finally the ocean became only a wet patch on the ground, as if damp-  
ened by a spring rainshower. That shrank to a few tiny puddles, like those  
left by a cow urinating, until all the water evaporated, leaving nothing  
into which one could even dip a finger.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

Because of this, you must realize that “everything impermanent is bound  
for decay and destruction; hence there is nothing on which one can hold  
to or rely. The psychophysical complexes that perdure through the influence  
of one’s defilements are to be abhorred. You must seek the path of tran-  
scendence out of this world and liberation from it.”  
After an indeterminate length of time, another great black storm arose,  
violently churning up the ocean floor down to a depth of eighty-four thou-  
sand _yojana_ s. All of the sandy [ocean floor] was blown apart and split in  
two. The sun, entering its palace on the mid-slope of Mount Sumeru, hov-  
ered at a height of forty-two thousand _yojana_ s above the ground for six  
consecutive days. Now, when the sun heats the world by continuously  
shining for six days, the four continents and the eighty thousand mountains  
and mountain ranges, along with Mount Sumeru, all begin to smolder.  
Just as when a potter stokes a fire to heat the clay, so does the sun’s heat  
build up over six days.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

Because of this, you must realize that “everything impermanent is bound

After some time, another great black storm arose, violently churning
up the ocean floor down to a depth of eighty-four thousand yojana s. The
sandy sea floor was all blown apart and split in two. The sun, entering its
palace on the mid-slope of Mount Sumeru, hovered at a height of forty-
two thousand yojana s for seven consecutive days. Now, when the sun
heats the world by shining continuously for seven days, the four continents
and the eighty thousand mountains and mountain ranges, along with Mount
Sumeru, all catch fire. Just as when a potter heats the kiln [by stoking a
fire into] intense flames, so does the sun’s heat build up over seven days.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
Because of this, you must realize that “everything impermanent is bound
for decay and destruction; hence there is nothing on which one can hold
to or rely. The psychophysical elements that perdure through the influence
of one’s defilements are to be abhorred. You must seek the path of tran-
scendence out of this world and liberation from it.”
The four continents and the eighty thousand mountains and mountain
ranges, along with Mount Sumeru, were all consumed in fiery flames. In
the same way, the celestial palaces of the four guardian gods, the Trāyastriṃśa
gods, the Yama gods, the Tuṣita gods, the Nirmāṇarati gods, the Para nirmita -
vaśavartin gods, and the Brahmā gods were all consumed by fiery flames.”
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
Because of this, you must realize that “everything impermanent is bound
for decay and destruction; hence there is nothing on which one can hold
to or rely. The psychophysical elements that perdure through the influence
of one’s defilements are to be abhorred. You must seek the path of tran-
scendence out of this world and liberation from it.”
With the four continents and everything up to [the world of] the Brahmā
gods in flames, the fire was caught by the wind and blown higher toward
Ābhā svara Heaven. Terrified by the sight of the flames, the offspring of
the Ābhāsvara gods clamored, “Ah, what is that?” The older gods explained
to the young ones, “Don’t be afraid. A fire like that was blown this way
once before but it stopped short before reaching us.” It is also because

they recall having seen the fire approaching that they are called the Ābhā -  
svarasmṛti gods.  
With the four continents and everything up to [the world of] the Brahmā  
gods in flames, Mount Sumeru steadily shrank as it burned, losing hundreds  
and thousands of _yojana_ s from its lofty height until it finally completely  
collapsed, with nothing remaining.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

Because of this, you must understand that “everything impermanent is  
bound for decay and destruction; hence there is nothing on which one can  
hold to or rely. The psychophysical elements that perdure through the  
influence of one’s defilements are to be abhorred. You must seek the path  
of transcendence out of this world and liberation from it.”  
When the destruction of the earth, the four continents, Mount Sumeru,  
and everything up to [the world of] the Brahmā gods was finished, not  
even a single bit of ash remained. Because of this, you must understand  
that “everything impermanent is bound for decay and destruction; hence  
there is nothing on which one can hold to or rely. The psychophysical  
complexes that perdure through the influence of one’s defilements are to  
be abhorred. You must seek the path of transcendence out of this world  
and liberation from it.”  
When you see the earth [completely] consumed by fire and all the water  
dispersed by the wind, you will understand that “everything impermanent  
is bound for decay and destruction; hence there is nothing on which one  
can hold to or rely. The psychophysical complexes that perdure through  
the influence of one’s defilements are to be abhorred. You must seek the  
path of transcendence out of this world and liberation from it.”

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

During the disaster by fire, hundreds of varieties of plants, grasses, and trees  
withered and died because there was no rainfall. Only those who have per-  
sonally witnessed this and known these events can believe it. All the water,  
not only on the surface of the earth but also the groundwater, had been  
exhausted as has been described, as was the layer of wind below the water.

Only those who have personally witnessed this and known these events can
believe it. The foregoing is [an account of] the disaster caused by fire.
How is it possible to recover from fire? After some time, a great black
cloud appeared in the sky. As it rose to Ābhāsvara Heaven, rain poured
down like drops from a spinning wheel for incalculable hundreds of thou-
sands of years. The water gradually accumulated, its volume expanding
for incalculable hundreds of thousands of yojana s. When it reached Ābhās-
vara Heaven the four powers of wind arose to hold up that mass of water.
What are the four winds? They are steady wind, supporting wind, immov-
able wind, and firm wind. In time, as the water level gradually diminished
by hundreds of thousands of yojana s and retreated further by incalculable
hundreds of millions of yojana s [from the previous level], four great gusts
of wind, called sāṃkhya, blew from the four corners of the mass of water,
shaking it violently and creating great thunderous waves that cascaded
and broke in towering sheets of whitewater. The sparkling foam that shot
into the air instantly solidified into the forms and structures of celestial
palaces richly adorned with the seven kinds of treasure. Thus the residential
palaces of the Brahmakāyika gods came into being.
[Now] as the water level continued to diminish by incalculable hundreds
of millions of yojana s, four great gusts of wind, called sāṃkhya, blew
from the four corners of that mass of water, shaking it violently and creating
great thunderous waves that cascaded and broke in towering sheets of
whitewater. The sparkling foam that shot into the air instantly solidified
into the forms and structures of celestial palaces richly adorned with the
seven kinds of treasure. Thus the residential palaces of the Paranirmi-
tavaśavartin gods came into being.
[Again,] as the water level continued to diminish by incalculable hun-
dreds of thousands of yojana s, four great gusts of wind, called sāṃkhya,
blew from the four corners of that mass of water, shaking it violently and
creating great thunderous waves that cascaded and broke in towering
sheets of white water. The sparkling foam that shot into the air instantly
solidified into the forms and structures of celestial palaces richly adorned
with the seven kinds of treasure. Thus the residential palaces of the Nir-
māṇarati gods came into being.

[Again,] as the water level continued to diminish by incalculable hun-  
dreds of thousands of _yojana_ s, four great gusts of wind, called _sāṃkhya,_  
blew from the four corners of that mass of water, shaking it violently and  
creating great thunderous waves that cascaded and broke in towering  
sheets of whitewater. The sparkling foam that shot into the air instantly  
solidified into the forms and structures of celestial palaces richly adorned  
with the seven kinds of treasure. Thus the residential palaces of the Tuṣita  
gods came into being.  
[Again,] as the water level continued to diminish by incalculable hun-  
dreds of thousands of _yojana_ s, four great gusts of wind, called _sāṃkhya,_  
blew from the four corners of that mass of water, shaking it violently and  
creating great thunderous waves that cascaded and broke in towering  
sheets of whitewater. The sparkling foam that shot into the air instantly  
solidified into the forms and structures of celestial palaces richly adorned  
with the seven kinds of treasure. Thus the residential palaces of the Yama  
gods came into being.  
[Again,] as the water level continued to diminish by incalculable hun-  
dreds of thousands of _yojana_ s, the sparkling foam on the surface of the  
water was six hundred eight thousand _yojana_ s deep and the vastness of  
that body of water was limitless. Just as springwater flows out with bits  
of foam on its surface, that vast body of water carried [potential] forms  
and structures on its surface.  
How did Mount Sumeru come into being? Sudden gusts of wind blew  
the sparkling foam into piles, creating a mountain six hundred eight thousand  
_yojana_ s high and eighty-four thousand _yojana_ s long and wide, consisting  
entirely of the four precious materials of gold, silver, quartz, and lapis.  
How did the palaces of the _asura_ s come into being? After the creation  
of Mount Sumeru, [similar] gusts of wind blew over the great ocean and  
from out of the sparkling foam around the mountain great palatial structures  
came into being on all four sides, each extending eighty thousand _yojana_ s  
long and wide. These structures instantly became palatial buildings richly  
adorned with the seven kinds of treasure.  
Again, how did the palaces of the four guardian gods come into being?  
[Similar] gusts of wind blew the water of the great ocean halfway up the

side of Mount Sumeru, forty-two thousand yojana s high, and out of that
mass of sparkling foam came palaces richly adorned with the seven kinds
of treasure. This is how the palaces of the four guardian gods came into
being.
Again, how did the palaces of the Trāyastriṃśa gods come into being?
[Similar] gusts of wind blew the sparkling foam over the summit of Mount
Sumeru, instantly forming celestial palaces richly adorned with the seven
kinds of treasure.
Again, how did Mount Khadira come into being? [Similar] gusts of
wind blew the sparkling foam into a mound not far from Mount Sumeru,
and it instantly became a mountain composed of precious materials. That
mountain reached down to a depth of forty-two thousand yojana s beneath
the ground and was forty-two thousand yojana s long and wide, of limitless
vastness, and its variegated colors came from combinations of the seven
kinds of treasure. This is how Mount Khadira came into being.
Again, how did Mount Yisha come into being? [Similar] gusts of wind
blew the sparkling foam into a mound not far from Mount Khadira, and
it instantly became a mountain composed of precious materials that was
twenty-one thousand yojana s high and twenty-one thousand yojana s long
and wide, of limitless vastness, with variegated colors created by combi-
nations of the seven kinds of treasure.
From similar causes, a mound of sparkling foam not far from Mount
Yisha became Mount Shuchen, twelve thousand yojana s high and twelve
thousand yojana s long and wide, of limitless vastness, with variegated
colors created by combinations of the seven kinds of treasure. This is how
Mount Shuchen came into being.
Then [similar] gusts of wind blew the sparkling foam into a mound
not far from Mount Shuchen, and it became Mount Abanni, six thousand
yojana s high and six thousand yojana s long and wide, of limitless vastness,
with variegated colors created by combinations of the seven kinds of treas-
ure. This is how Mount Abanni came into being.
Then [similar] gusts of wind blew the sparkling foam into a mound not
far from Mount Abanni, and it became Mount Milin, three thousand yojana s
high and three thousand yojana s long and wide, of limitless vastness, with

variegated colors created by combinations of the seven kinds of treasure.  
This is how Mount Milin came into being.  
Then [similar] gusts of wind blew the sparkling foam into a mound not  
far from Mount Milin, and it became Mount Binito, twelve hundred _yojana_ s  
high and twelve hundred _yojana_ s long and wide, of limitless vastness, with  
variegated colors created by combinations of the seven kinds of treasure.  
This is how Mount Binito came into being.  
Then [similar] gusts of wind blew the sparkling foam into a mound  
not far from Mount Binito, and it became Mount Diaofu, six hundred  
_yojana_ s high and six hundred _yojana_ s long and wide, of limitless vastness,  
with variegated colors created by combinations of the seven kinds of treas-  
ure. This is how Mount Diaofu came into being.  
Then [similar] gusts of wind blew the sparkling foam into a mound  
not far from Mount Binito, and it became Mount Jinganglun, three hundred  
_yojana_ s high and three hundred _yojana_ s long and wide, of limitless vast-  
ness, with variegated colors created by combinations of the seven kinds  
of treasure. This is how Mount Jinganglun came into being.  
How did the single lunar palace and the seven palaces of the sun appear?  
[Similar] gusts of wind blew the sparkling foam into piles that instantly  
became the single palace of the moon and the seven palaces of the sun.  
Blown by a dark cloud, they returned to their original locations [in the  
sky]. Thus the palaces of the sun and the moon came into being.  
Then [similar] gusts of wind blew on the sparkling foam to instantly  
create the four continents and the eighty thousand territories under heaven.  
This how the four continents and eighty thousand territories came into being.  
Then [similar] gusts of wind blew the sparkling foam to instantly create  
Mount Dajinganglun, one hundred sixty-eight thousand _yojana_ s in height,  
length, and width, of limitless vastness, composed of solid diamond that  
cannot be shattered. This is how the great diamond mountain came into  
being.  
Now after some time, clouds began to appear and spread in the sky.  
Rain poured down like drops from a spinning wheel, and the water inun-  
dated the four continents to a depth equal to the height of Mount Sumeru.  
Then gusts of wind blew and created deep depressions in the ground,

which filled with salty water and became the oceans. This is how the four
great oceans came into being.
There are three reasons given for the saltiness of seawater. What are
the three? First, clouds spontaneously appeared and filled the sky as far
as Ābhāsvara Heaven, pouring down rain all around. The rain washed
over the celestial palaces and thoroughly cleansed everything under the
sky, from the palaces of the Brahmakāyika gods, the Paranirmitavaśavartin
gods, and the Yama gods to the four continents and the eighty thousand
mountains and mountain ranges, including Mount Sumeru. This water
collected all the dirty, pungent, and briny scum from the cleansing and
washed it downstream to the ocean, forming a single uniform saltiness.
This is how seawater became salty. Second, there was once a great sage
who cast a spell over the ocean to make its water salty enough for humans
to be unable to drink. Because of this, seawater is salty. Third, many crea-
tures live in the ocean, some as large as one or two hundred yojana s in
size, a few up to seven hundred yojana s, and all of these creatures take
in and expel the same water, which contains all the waste material from
their bodies. Because of this, seawater is salty. The foregoing is [an account
of] the disaster caused by fire.
The Buddha spoke to the bhikṣu s:
What is the disaster caused by water? Once every person in the world was
fully engaged in practicing the right Dharma, abiding therein without
deviation, and they naturally adhered to the ten norms of conduct. One
person, while adhering to these norms, attained the third meditative state
of absorption and [suddenly] ascended in midair to continue on the path
of disciples, the path of heaven, and the path of Brahmā. In a distinct
voice, he said, “O venerables, you must know that joy disappears in the
third state of concentration, leaving only overwhelming bliss—bliss alone
is the third state of concentration!” When the others heard him, they looked
up and said, “Very well. Very well, sir. Will you expound for our sake the
path that leads to the state of absorption where there is no joy but bliss
alone?” The practitioner responded to their request, expounding the path
that leads to the third meditative state of absorption that transcends the
feeling of joy.

Hearing this exhortation, all the people of the world decided to attain  
the third meditative state of absorption, and when their bodies dissolved  
and their lives came to an end they were born in Śubhakṛtsna Heaven.  
Then all the sentient beings whose transgressions had been fully expiated  
in the hell realms were reborn in the human world, and they too took up  
the practice leading to the third meditative state of absorption, and when  
their bodies dissolved and their lives came to an end, they were born in  
Śubha kṛtsna Heaven. In like manner, sentient beings who had been in the  
animal realm or the realms of the hungry ghosts, the _asura_ s, the four  
guardian gods, the Trāyastriṃśa gods, the Yama gods, the Nirmāṇarati  
gods, the Para nir mita vaśavartin gods, and the [gods of the] Brahmā and  
Ābhāsvara Heavens all came to be born in the human world after their  
lives came to an end in their respective realms. They too took up the prac-  
tice leading to the third meditative state of absorption, and upon the dis-  
solution of their bodies at the end of their lives, they were born in Śubha -  
kṛtsna Heaven. In this manner, no one remained in the hell realms, or in  
the animal realm, or in the realms of the hungry ghosts, the _asura_ s, the  
four guardian gods, and so on up to the world of the Ābhāsvara gods.  
In other words, as the end of the world approached all the residents of  
the hells had already died, followed by the deaths of all the animals. When  
the animals were all dead, the deaths of all the hungry ghosts followed.  
When the ghosts were all dead, the deaths of all the _asura_ s followed. When  
the _asura_ s were all dead, the deaths of the four guardian gods followed.  
When the four guardian gods [and their retainers] were all dead, the deaths  
of the Trāyastriṃśa gods followed. When the Trāyastriṃśa gods were all  
dead, the deaths of the Yama gods followed. When the Yama gods were  
all dead, the deaths of the Tuṣita gods followed. When the Tuṣita gods  
were all dead, the deaths of the Nirmāṇarati gods followed. When the Nir-  
māṇarati gods were all dead, the deaths of the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods  
followed. When the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods were all dead, the deaths  
of the Brahmā gods followed. When the Brahmā gods were all dead, only  
then did the deaths of the Ābhāsvara gods occur, followed by the deaths  
of all the humans. And when the humans were all dead no one remained.  
The world was about to be destroyed, an incipient disaster.

After an indeterminate length of time, a great black cloud loomed in
the sky. As it rose to Śubhakṛtsna Heaven hot rain began to fall all around.
The steaming water fell on the heavenly worlds and boiled them away,
leaving no residue. The palaces of the Ābhāsvara gods were totally
destroyed, just as when ghee is thrown into a fire nothing remains. Because
of this, you must know that “everything impermanent is bound for decay
and destruction; hence there is nothing that one can hold to or rely on.
The psychophysical elements that perdure through the influence of one’s
defilements are to be abhorred. You must seek the path of transcendence
out of this world and deliverance from it.”
Then the [steaming] rain fell on the palaces of the Brahmakāyika gods
and boiled them away, leaving no residue. Next, the rain drenched the
palaces of the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods, the Nirmāṇarati gods, the Tuṣita
gods, and the Yama gods, one after another, boiling them all away and
leaving no residue, like ghee thrown into a fire. Then the deluge fell on
the four continents as well as all the mountains and mountain ranges of
the eighty thousand territories, together with Mount Sumeru, boiling them
away and leaving no residue, like ghee thrown into a fire. Because of this,
you must know that “everything impermanent is bound for decay and
destruction; hence there is nothing that one can hold to or rely on. The
psychophysical elements that perdure through the influence of one’s defile-
ments are to be abhorred. You must seek the path of transcendence out of
this world and deliverance from it.”
Then the [steaming] water boiled away the earth, leaving no residue.
The layer of water beneath the ground was gone and the wind below that
water was gone too. Because of this, you must know that “everything
impermanent is bound for decay and destruction; hence there is nothing
that one can hold to or rely on. The psychophysical elements that perdure
through the influence of one’s defilements are to be abhorred. You must
seek the path of transcendence out of this world and deliverance from it.”
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
[You have heard that] the celestial palaces of the Śubhakṛtsna gods were
boiled away, leaving no residue. Only those who have witnessed it and
known these events themselves can believe it. The celestial palaces of the

Brahmakāyika gods, too, were boiled away, totally extinguished, and so  
on, down to the water beneath the ground and the wind below it, all gone,  
as has been described. Only those who have witnessed it and known these  
events themselves can believe it. The foregoing is [an account of] the dis-  
aster caused by water.  
How is it possible to recover from water? After some time, a great  
black cloud appeared in the sky, spreading through space. As it rose to  
Śubhakṛtsna Heaven, rain poured down like drops from a spinning wheel  
for uncountable hundreds of millions of years. The water gradually accu-  
mulated, eventually reaching Śubhakṛtsna Heaven. Now the four powers  
of wind arose to hold up that mass of water. What are the four winds?  
They are a steady wind, a supporting wind, an immovable wind, and a  
firm wind. In time, as the water level gradually diminished by uncountable  
hundreds of thousands of _yojana_ s, four great gusts of wind, called _sāṃkhya,_  
blew up from the four corners of the mass of water, agitating it violently  
and creating great thunderous waves that cascaded and broke in towering  
sheets of whitewater. The sparkling foam that shot into the air instantly  
solidified into the forms and structures of the palaces of the Ābhāsvara  
gods, richly adorned with the seven kinds of treasure. Thus the celestial  
palaces of the Ābhāsvara gods came into being.  
[Now] as the water level continued to diminish by uncountable hundreds  
of thousands of _yojana_ s, four great gusts of wind, called _sāṃkhya,_ blew  
up from the four corners of the mass of water, agitating it violently and  
creating great thunderous waves that cascaded and broke in towering  
sheets of whitewater. The sparkling foam that shot into the air instantly  
solidified into the forms and structures of the palaces of the Brahmakāyika  
gods, richly adorned with the seven kinds of treasure. In this manner, [the  
process of creation] proceeded down to the appearance of ocean water  
with its uniform saltiness, exactly like the recovery after the disaster  
caused by fire.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

What is the disaster caused by wind? Once every person in the world was  
fully engaged in practicing the right Dharma, abiding therein without  
deviation, and they naturally adhered to the ten norms of conduct. One

person, adhering to these norms, attained the fourth meditative state of
absorption, a pure and genuine consolidation of mindfulness, and [sud-
denly] ascended in midair to continue on the path of disciples, the path
of heaven, and the path of Brahmā. In a distinct voice, he said, “O ven-
erables, you must know that the fourth state of absorption is a pure and
genuine consolidation of mindfulness.” When the others heard him, they
looked up and said, “Very well. Very well, sir. Will you expound for our
sake the path that leads to the state of absorption where a pure and genuine
mindfulness is consolidated?” The practitioner responded to their request,
expounding the path that leads to the fourth meditative state of absorption
where a pure and genuine mindfulness is consolidated.
Hearing this exhortation, the people of this world decided to attain the
fourth meditative state of absorption, and when their bodies dissolved
and their lives came to an end they were born in Bṛhatphala Heaven. Then
all the sentient beings whose transgressions had been fully expiated in
the hell realms were born again in the human world, and they too took
up the practice leading to the fourth meditative state of absorption, and
when their bodies dissolved and their lives came to an end they were born
in Bṛhatphala Heaven. In a similar manner, sentient beings who had been
in the animal realm or in the realms of the hungry ghosts, the asura s, the
four guardian gods, and so on, up to the Śubhakṛtsna gods, all vacated
their respective worlds and were reborn in the human world.
All the residents of the hells had already died, followed by the deaths
of all the animals. When the animals were all dead, the deaths of all the
hungry ghosts followed. When the ghosts were all dead, the deaths of all
the asura s followed. When the asura s were all dead, the deaths of the
four guardian gods followed. When the four guardian gods [and their
retainers] were all dead, one after another followed in the same manner,
all the way to the deaths of the Śubhakṛtsna gods. When these gods were
all dead, the deaths of all the humans followed. And when the humans
were all dead no one remained. The world was about to be destroyed, an
incipient disaster.
After an indeterminate length of time, a great wind called mahāsāṃkhya
gathered, reaching as far as Bṛhatphala Heaven. It stormed in all directions
and blew down the palaces of the Śubhakṛtsna and Ābhāsvara gods. Those

celestial structures were hurled together and blown into bits, just as if a  
strongman had seized two implements made of copper and smashed them  
together, producing an explosion. Because of this, you must know that “every-  
thing impermanent is bound for decay and destruction; hence there is nothing  
that one can hold to or rely on. The psychophysical elements that perdure  
through the influence of one’s defilements are to be abhorred. You must seek  
the path of transcendence out of this world and deliverance from it.”  
Then the wind assaulted the palaces of the Brahmakāyika and the  
Paranirmitavaśavartin gods. Those celestial structures too were hurled  
together and blown into bits, just as if a strongman had seized two imple-  
ments made of copper and smashed them together, producing an explosion.  
Because of this, you must know that “everything impermanent is bound  
for decay and destruction; hence, there is nothing that one can hold to or  
rely on. The psychophysical elements that perdure through the influence  
of one’s defilements are to be abhorred. You must seek the path of tran-  
scendence out of this world and deliverance from it.”  
Next, the wind assaulted the palaces of the Nirmāṇarati, the Tuṣita,  
and the Yama gods. Those celestial structures were also hurled together  
and blown into bits, just as if a strongman had seized two implements  
made of copper and smashed them together, producing an explosion.  
Because of this, you must know that “everything impermanent is bound  
for decay and destruction; hence there is nothing that one can hold to or  
rely on. The psychophysical elements that perdure through the influence  
of one’s defilements are to be abhorred. You must seek the path of tran-  
scendence out of this world and deliverance from it.”  
After that, the wind ravaged the four continents and the eighty thousand  
territories, blowing the mountains and maintain ranges, together with  
Mount Sumeru, one hundred thousand _yojana_ s into space. Those mountains  
were hurled together and blown into bits, just as if a strongman had picked  
up rice bran and scattered it in the air. Because of this, you must know  
that “everything impermanent is bound for decay and destruction; hence  
there is nothing that one can hold to or rely on. The psychophysical ele-  
ments that perdure through the influence of one’s defilement are to be  
abhorred. You must seek the path of transcendence out of this world and  
deliverance from it.”

Then the wind blew away the ground and drained the water beneath
the ground and depleted the wind below the water. Because of this, you
must know that “everything impermanent is bound for decay and destruc-
tion; hence there is nothing that one can hold to or rely on. The psy-
chophysical elements that perdure through the influence of one’s defile-
ments are to be abhorred. You must seek the path of transcendence out of
this world and deliverance from it.”
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
[You have heard that] the celestial palaces of the Śubhakṛtsna and the
Ābhāsvara gods were hurled together and blown into bits. Only those
who have witnessed it and known these events themselves can believe
it. If anyone wishes to believe that the water beneath the ground was
drained and the wind below the water depleted, he must himself witness
it and know it directly. The foregoing is [an account of] the disaster
caused by wind.
How is it possible to recover from wind? After some time, a great black
cloud appeared in the sky, spreading through space. As it rose to Bṛhatphala
Heaven, rain poured down like drops from a spinning wheel for uncount-
able hundreds of millions of years. The water gradually accumulated,
eventually reaching Bṛhatphala Heaven. Now the four powers of wind
arose to hold up that mass of water. What are the four winds? They are a
steady wind, a supporting wind, an immovable wind, and a firm wind. In
time, as the water level gradually diminished by uncountable hundreds
of thousands of yojana s, four great gusts of wind, called sāṃkhya, blew
up from the four corners of the mass of water, agitating it violently and
creating great thunderous waves that cascaded and broke in towering
sheets of whitewater. The sparkling foam that shot into the air instantly
solidified into the forms and structures of the palaces of the Śubhakṛtsna
gods, richly adorned with the seven kinds of treasure. Thus the celestial
palaces of the Śubhakṛtsna gods came into being.
[Now] as the water level continued to diminish by uncountable hundreds
of thousands of yojana s, four great gusts of wind, called sāṃkhya, blew
up from the four corners of the mass of water, agitating it violently and
creating great thunderous waves that cascaded and broke in towering

sheets of whitewater. The sparkling foam that shot into the air instantly
solidified into the forms and structures of the palaces of the Ābhāsvara
gods, richly adorned with the seven kinds of treasure. In this manner, [the
process of creation] proceeded down to the appearance of ocean water
with its uniform saltiness, exactly like the recovery after the disaster
caused by water. The foregoing is [an account of] the disaster caused by
wind. Altogether, the three disasters are called the threefold cycle.

#### Article 10: Celestial Wars

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

In ancient times, the heavenly gods engaged in armed battles with the
asura s. Śakra, lord of the gods, assembled the Trāyastriṃśa gods and said,
“Let us go to fight the asura s. If we are victorious, make sure to capture
Vimalacitra, the asura general, bind him in five chains and bring him to
Sudharma Hall. I want to see him.”
After receiving these commands, the Trāyastriṃśa gods readied their
armor. At the same time, the leader of the asura s, Vimalacitra, gave his
orders, “Now let us go to fight them. If we are victorious, capture Śakra,
bind him in five chains, and bring him to Saptaparṇa Hall. I want to see
him.” After receiving these commands, the asura s readied their armor.
Then the gods and the asura s met on the battlefield and fought each other.
The gods were victorious and the asura s withdrew.
The leader of the asura s, Vimalacitra, was captured, and the Trāyas-
triṃśa gods bound him in chains and brought him to Sudharma Hall,
where he was given to Śakra, lord of the gods. As he looked around him,
the asura general saw the attractions of a celestial life and reflected, “This
place is so extraordinary. What would be the point of returning to the
asura s’ palace?” As soon as he formulated this thought, the five chains
fell away and images of the pleasures to be gained through the five senses
appeared before him. Whenever his thoughts returned to his palace among
the asura s, however, the five chains reappeared, the objects of his pleasure
disappeared at once, and he found himself back in bondage.
In effect, the leader of the asura s was more tightly bound than he would
have been by the devil’s own spell. Those who become obsessed with

themselves are likely bound by the devil. Those who never become caught
up in themselves are likely free of the devil’s bondage. To consider sen-
sation ( vedanā ) as proof that one exists is bondage. Being attached to sen-
sation is bondage. Believing that the self exists is bondage. Believing that
the self does not exist is bondage. Believing that material objects ( sarūpa )
exist is bondage. Believing that material objects do not exist is bondage.
Believing that material objects both exist and do not exist is bondage.
Believing that the self forms ideas is bondage. Believing that the self does
not form ideas is bondage. Believing that the self forms and does not form
ideas is bondage. The self is the main issue, the thorn and the infection.
Therefore, wise and saintly disciples ( śrāvaka s) realize that the self has
become the main problem, the thorn and the infection. One must abandon
the idea of a self and adhere to practicing non-self in order to see that the
habitual discriminations that one makes between oneself and others are
caused by a lack of discipline and constitute the greatest burden. Whether
one views a contingent phenomenon (i.e., causally produced) as having a
reality of its own (self) or no reality, or a material form ( sarūpa ) of its own
or no form, or its own concept or no concept—in all cases, the conviction
that a contingent phenomenon exists is the main problem, the thorn and the
infection. Because of this, wise and saintly disciples regard the compounding
of phenomena as the chief difficulty, the thorn and the infection. Hence,
forsaking the realm of phenomena, they adopt the transcendent practice.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
Once, when the heavenly gods were at war with the asura s, Śakra, lord of
the gods, assembled the Trāyastriṃśa gods and said, “Let us go fight the
asura s. If we are victorious, make sure to capture Vimalacitra, the asura
general, bind him in five chains, and bring him to Sudharma Hall. I want
to see him.” After receiving these commands, the Trāyastriṃśa gods readied
their armor. At the same time, the leader of the asura s, Vimalacitra, gave
his orders, “Now let us go fight them. If we are victorious, capture Śakra,
bind him with five chains, and bring him to Saptaparṇa Hall. I want to see
him.” After receiving these commands, the asura s readied their armor.
Then the gods and the asura s met on the battlefield and fought each other.
The gods were victorious and the asura s withdrew.

The leader of the _asura_ s, Vimalacitra, was captured, and the Trāyas-  
triṃśa gods bound him in chains and brought him to Sudharma Hall,  
where he was given to Śakra, lord of the gods. When Indra, lord of the  
gods, appeared and made his way to the central platform in the hall, the  
_asura_ general shouted at him with many abusive terms. Indra’s attendant  
looked at his lord and asked:

Lord of the gods, what are you afraid of?
Does your hesitation show
Condescension or weakness [to the asura ]?
How can you listen to the foul words
That the asura general says
To your face directly?
Śakra, lord of the gods, immediately composed a verse in reply:
The asura is helpless and powerless,
I have no reason to fear him.
How can one who possesses wisdom
Argue with anyone so unworthy?
The attendant responded:
If you don’t punish that fool’s stupidity now,
You will face more insults later
That will only become harder to abide.
You should let him taste your cudgel
And then correct his own insolence.
The lord of the gods again composed a verse in reply:
As I say, a wise person should never dispute with a fool.
While the foolish aim words of abuse,
Still the wise tolerate them in silence
And thereby win them over.
Then the attendant said to Śakra, lord of the gods:
Your lordship’s silence seems to come from a fear
Of besmirching the dignified attitude of the wise,
Yet that stupid one assumes it is from weakness.
Unable to measure his own strength,

That fool believes he is your equal.
Already as good as dead, he demands a fight to the death,
Hoping you will flinch like a bull withdrawing.
Śakra then composed a verse in reply:
That fool, with no knowledge or insight,
Imagines that I am terrified
When I consider the object of highest importance
Is expressing the virtue of silent patience.
The worst vice of all is to pile anger upon anger
When the best fight is to control oneself,
Instead of inflaming anger with anger.
There are two grounds for one’s conduct,
Either for oneself or for the sake of others.
Many who dispute over a suit
Will consider they have won the case
When one refrains from responding.
[Again,] there are two grounds for one’s conduct,
Either for oneself or for the sake of others.
Those who refrain from dispute
May be regarded as ignorant and foolish,
But one who is endowed with real strength
Can tolerate those with the least strength.
That strength is the highest and best part of patience.
While fools think they are strong,
Their strength is not at all real.
Those who possess the strength of patience,
Understanding how it must be expressed,
Have strength indeed that no one can counter.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
You must not think that the lord of the gods of that time was someone
else. The Śakra of that time was indeed myself. I was engaged in practicing
patience then and refrained from intemperate acts. I also was sure to praise
those who could hold fast and persevere. If those who are endowed with

knowledge and insight wish to propagate the path I teach, they must prac-  
tice the virtue of silent patience and not engage in any form of dispute.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

Once, long ago, when the Trāyastriṃśa gods fought with the _asura_ s, Śakra,  
lord of the gods, said to the king of the _asura_ s, “Why must we always  
keep our weapons ready for further belligerence and hostility? Why must  
we argue and fight? Now, let us conduct our arguments on the grounds  
of ethics and morality and thereby determine who has won and who has  
lost.” Citra, the leader of the _asura_ s, replied, “Then we will set our weapons  
aside and stop our disputes. But who will determine which side has won  
or lost?” The lord of the gods said, “Let us just engage in debate. There  
are some on your side, as well as those on mine, who are endowed with  
the wisdom to know who has won and lost.”  
The leader of the _asura_ s then said, “Please go first and state your posi-  
tion in verse.” The lord of the gods replied, “You are a former resident of  
heaven. You should speak first.” Then the _asura_ Citra at once composed  
a verse:

If you don’t punish the fool’s stupidity now,  
You will face more insults later  
That will only become harder to abide.  
You should let him taste your cudgel  
And then correct his own insolence.  
When Citra finished his verse, the _asura_ s in attendance were greatly  
delighted and loudly proclaimed that the statement was good. The gods  
in attendance all remained silent. Then the _asura_ leader said to Śakra,  
“Please compose your verse now.” At once, the lord of the gods gave his  
verse for the sake of the _asura_ s:

As I say, a wise person should never dispute with a fool.
While the foolish aim words of abuse,
Still the wise tolerate them in silence.
And thereby win them over.

When Śakra finished his verse, all the Trāyastriṃśa gods were delighted
and proclaimed in loud voices that the statement was good. The asura s,
however, remained silent. Then the lord of the gods said to Citra, “Please
compose your next verse.” The asura leader composed the following verse:
Your lordship’s silence seems to come from a fear
Of besmirching the dignified attitude of the wise.
Yet that stupid one assumes that it is from weakness.
Unable to measure his own strength,
That fool believes he is your equal.
Already as good as dead, he demands a fight to the death,
Hoping you will flinch like a bull withdrawing.
When Citra finished his verse, the asura s leapt and danced in delight,
proclaiming that the statement was excellent. The Trāyastriṃśa gods all
remained silent. The asura leader then said to Śakra, “Please compose
your next verse.” The lord of the gods uttered this verse:
That fool, with no knowledge or insight,
Imagines that I am terrified
When I consider the object of highest importance
Is expressing the virtue of silent patience.
The worst vice of all is to pile anger upon anger
When the best fight is to control oneself,
Instead of inflaming anger with anger.
There are two grounds for one’s conduct,
Either for oneself or for the sake of others.
Many who dispute over a suit
Will consider they have won the case
When one refrains from responding.
[Again,] there are two grounds for one’s conduct,
Either for oneself or for the sake of others.
Those who refrain from dispute
May be regarded as ignorant and foolish,
But one who is endowed with real strength
Can tolerate those with the least strength.

That strength is the highest and best part of patience.  
While fools think they are strong,  
Their strength is not at all real,  
Those who possess the strength of patience,  
Understanding how it must be expressed,  
Have strength indeed that no one can counter.  
When Śakra finished his verse, the Trāyastriṃśa gods all leapt and  
danced in delight, loudly proclaiming that it was good. The _asura_ s who  
were present remained silent. The two groups, gods and _asura_ s, withdrew  
after a while and conversed among themselves, “The verses of the _asura_  
leader constitute an offense because they harp on fighting and arguing,  
reinforce feelings of injury and resentment, and stir up an appetite for  
revenge by any means; thus they further embed the root cause of existence  
in the three spheres. On the other hand, the verses of the lord of the gods  
do not convey anything offensive. His teaching does not harp on fighting  
and arguing, or reinforce feelings of injury and resentment, or stir up an  
appetite for revenge by any means; thus they tend to terminate the root  
cause of existence in the three spheres. The teaching of the lord of the  
gods can therefore be deemed good, whereas that of the _asura_ leader must  
be deemed deficient.” This is how the Trāyastriṃśa gods were victorious  
and the _asura_ s defeated.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

You must not think that the lord of the gods of that time was someone  
else. The Śakra of that time was indeed myself. It was at that time that I  
won over the band of _asura_ s through gentle words.

The Buddha continued:

Once long ago, when the Trāyastriṃśa gods fought with the _asura_ s, things  
turned such that the _asura_ s were victorious and the gods defeated. Śakra,  
lord of the gods, fled in haste, riding a chariot endowed with thousand-  
spoked wheels. During his escape he saw a bird’s nest on top of an _anpoluo_  
tree with two chicks in it. At once, he said to his charioteer:

I see two chicks on that tree,  
Turn around to avoid colliding with it.  
I might have to pay the consequences,  
But we must not injure those birds.  
Upon hearing his command, the charioteer stopped at once. The chariot  
was now exposed to the oncoming _asura_ s. Seeing the chariot stop, the  
_asura_ s said to each other, “It is Śakra who is in the chariot with the thou-  
sand-spoked wheels. He has turned around to face us. He must want to  
fight. Don’t attack him.” The _asura_ s withdrew. On that day, the Trāyas-  
triṃśa gods were victorious when the _asura_ s withdrew.  
The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:  
You must not think that the lord of the gods of that time was someone  
else. The Śakra of that time was indeed myself. I was then extending com-  
passion to as many sentient beings as I could. O _bhikṣu_ s, since you have  
all renounced domestic life and begun practicing the truths of my religion,  
you must elevate your sense of compassion and extend it to everyone.  
The Buddha continued:  
Once long ago, when the Trāyastriṃśa gods fought with the _asura_ s, the  
gods were victorious when the _asura_ s withdrew. Śakra, lord of the gods,  
returned to his palace from the campaign and built an additional pavilion  
that extended one hundred _yojana_ s from east to west in length and sixty  
_yojana_ s wide from north to south. He named it Paramārtha. The pavilion  
contained one hundred halls, and in each hall were seven raised platforms  
for seven maidens, each with her own attendant. Śakra, lord of the gods,  
did not worry about the cost. The maidens were amply provided with gar-  
ments, food and drink, and jewels. The cost of the hall, along with that  
of its construction, was borne through the merit earned by his triumphant  
campaign against the _asura_ s, and as the pavilion was built after a joyous  
victory, it was also given the name Pavilion of the Supreme Victor. No  
building could equal it in grandeur in all the thousand worlds, so it was  
called the Paramount Pavilion.  
The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:  

Once long ago, the king of the _asura_ s was seized by jealousy: “I wield  
the power of command and my supernormal powers are not few in number.  
Yet the sun and the moon and the Trāyastriṃśa gods always abide above  
me, freely moving over my head. How can I conquer the sun and moon  
and make them my earrings, revolving as I wish?” His anger was intense.  
He thought of the _asura_ general Chuida, and at once the latter became  
aware, “Rāhu is calling me. We must ready our armor.” He ordered his  
attendants to gather their weapons and rode out in his chariot accompanied  
before and after by the _asura_ legions. When he reached the king of the  
_asura_ s, he took his place to one side.  
Again, the king of the _asura_ s thought of the _asura_ general Shemoli,  
and at once the latter became aware, “Rāhu is calling me. We must ready  
our armor.” He ordered his attendants to gather their weapons and rode  
out in his chariot accompanied before and after by the _asura_ legions.  
When he reached the king of the _asura_ s, he took his place to one side.  
Again, the king of the _asura_ s thought of the _asura_ general Vimalacitra,  
and at once the latter became aware, “Rāhu is calling me. We must ready  
our armor.” He ordered his attendants to gather their weapons and rode  
out in his chariot accompanied before and after by the _asura_ legions.  
When he reached the king of the _asura_ s, he took his place to one side.  
Again, the king of the _asura_ s thought of his minister Asurin, and at  
once the latter became aware, “Rāhu is calling me. We must ready our  
armor.” He too ordered his attendants to gather their weapons and rode  
out in his chariot accompanied before and after by the _asura_ legions.  
When he reached the king of the _asura_ s, he took his place to one side.  
Again, the king of the _asura_ s thought of the minor _asura_ leaders, and  
at once the latter became aware, “Rāhu is calling me. We must ready our  
armor.” They immediately gathered their weapons and led their legions  
to the king of the _asura_ s, where they took their places to one side.  
Then Rāhu, king of the _asura_ s, prepared his weapons, donned his  
armor, and rode out in his chariot to lead the hundreds of thousands of  
_asura_ legions to battle. By this time, the _nāga_ kings Nanda and Upananda  
had encircled Mount Sumeru with their bodies seven times for defense,  
shaking the hills and valleys, unleashing rain from an increasingly overcast  
sky, and slapping the ocean surface with their tails to send the water high

over the top of Mount Sumeru. The Trāyastriṃśa gods thought, “The
clouds are growing, rain is falling, the ocean is stirring, and the waves
are reaching us here. This can only mean that the asura s are coming.”
Now the asura s met a host of nāga s from the ocean, innumerable myr-
iads in heavy armor and carrying pikes, bows and arrows, spears and
lances, and daggers and swords. When the battle commenced the nāga
soldiers pursued the enemy as far as the grounds of the asura palace when
they had the advantage, but when they were obliged to withdraw they did
not return to their own palace but proceeded at once to report to the
garuḍa s: “The asura s are on their way to fight the gods. When we tried
to block them, they continued to push through. Now you must sharpen
your weapons and get ready to fight with us against the asura s.”
Hearing this report, the garuḍa s gathered their weapons, donned heavy
armor, and joined the nāga s to battle against the asura s. When they had
the advantage they pursued the asura s as far as the grounds of the enemy
palace, but when they were obliged to withdraw they did not return to
their own palace but proceeded at once to report to the Chihua demigods:
“The asura s are on their way to fight the gods. When we tried to block
them, they continued to push through. Now you must sharpen your
weapons and get ready to fight with us against the asura s.”
Hearing this report, the Chihua demigods gathered their weapons,
donned heavy armor, and joined the garuḍa s and nāga s to battle against
the asura s. When they had the advantage they pursued the asura s as far
as the grounds of the enemy palace, but when they were obliged to with-
draw they did not return to their own palace but proceeded at once to
report to the Changle demigods, “The asura s are on their way to fight the
gods. Although we tried to block them, they continued to push through.
Now you must sharpen your weapons and fight with us against the asura s.”
Hearing this report, the Changle demigods gathered their weapons,
donned heavy armor, and joined the Chihua [demigods], garuḍa s, and
nāga s to battle against the asura s. When they had the advantage they pur-
sued the asura s as far as the grounds of the enemy palace, but when they
were obliged to withdraw they did not return to their own palace but pro-
ceeded at once to report to the four guardian gods: “The asura s are on
their way to fight the gods. Although we tried to block them, they continued

to push through. Now you must sharpen your weapons and get ready to  
fight with us against the _asura_ s.”  
Hearing this report, the four guardian gods gathered their weapons,  
donned heavy armor, and joined the innumerable hosts battling the _asura_ s.  
When they had the advantage they pursued the _asura_ s as far as the grounds  
of the enemy palace, but when they were obliged to withdraw they did  
not return to their own palace but proceeded at once to Sudharma Hall to  
report to Śakra and the Trāyastriṃśa gods, “The _asura_ s are on their way  
to fight you. Although we tried to block their way, they have had the advan-  
tage. Now, sirs, you must gather your weapons and join us in fighting the  
_asura_ s.”  
Now the lord of the gods called one of his attendants and told him,  
“Carry this message to the gods of the Yama, Tuṣita, Nirmāṇarati, and  
Paranirmitavaśavartin Heavens. Tell them, ‘The _asura_ s, with innumerable  
legions, have come to fight. The gods of all the heavens must now gather  
their weapons and join us in fighting the _asura_ s.’”  
The attendant conveyed the message from Śakra to the Yama gods and  
so on, as far as the gods of Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven. Hearing the  
message, the Yama gods gathered their weapons, donned heavy armor,  
and rode out in their chariots, accompanied by innumerable myriads of  
hosts, to establish their camp on the east side of Mount Sumeru. The Tuṣita  
gods gathered their weapons, donned heavy armor, and rode out in their  
chariots, accompanied by innumerable myriads of hosts, to establish camp  
on the south side of Mount Sumeru. The Nirmāṇarati gods, meanwhile,  
assembled their armies and established camp on the west side of Mount  
Sumeru, while the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods assembled their armies and  
established camp on the north side of Mount Sumeru.  
Then Śakra, lord of the gods, thought of the Trāyastriṃśa gods, and at  
once the latter became aware, “Śakra is calling us. We must prepare our-  
selves as quickly as possible.” Accordingly, they ordered their armies to  
ready their weapons and rode in their chariots, accompanied before and  
after by innumerable myriads of gods, to the palace of the lord of the gods  
and took their places to one side. Śakra then thought of the remaining  
gods of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, and at once the latter became aware, “Lord  
Śakra is calling us. We must prepare ourselves as quickly as possible.”

They ordered their armies to ready their weapons and rode in their chariots,
accompanied before and after by innumerable myriads of gods, to the
palace of the lord of the gods and took their places to one side.
Then the lord of the gods thought of Viśvakarman and at once the latter
became aware, “The lord of the gods is calling me. I must present myself
before him.” Immediately he stood before Śakra.
Finally, the lord of the gods gathered his weapons and put on his armor.
He rode on the head of Viśvakarman, accompanied before and after by
innumerable gods, demigods, and spirits, out from his celestial palace to
do battle with the asura s. His armies were armored and well equipped with
axes and hatchets, pikes and swords, bows and arrows, halberds and long-
handled halberds, lassos, and other weapons, all embellished with the seven
kinds of treasure. They attacked the asura s fiercely, but the sharp points
and edges of their weapons only touched [the asura s’] bodies without injur-
ing them. The asura armies also wielded axes and hatchets, pikes and
swords, bows and arrows, halberds and long-handled halberds, throw nets
and other weapons, and they attacked the gods fiercely without injuring
them. The heavenly gods and the asura s battled out of desire, and their
actions were expressed in this manner because of the cause of their desire.

#### Article 11: Three

#### Medium-length Eons

The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
There are three medium-length eons. What are they? The first is the eon of
warfare. The second is the eon of famine. The third is the eon of pestilence.
What is the eon of warfare? People of these times originally have a
life span of forty thousand years. This later decreases to twenty thousand
years, and again to ten thousand years. It further becomes one thousand
years, then five hundred years, three hundred, then two hundred. Now
people live to be around one hundred years of age. After this, human life
spans will further decrease, down to ten years. Young women will be
betrothed five months after being born.
All the delicacies of the age, such as ghee, honey, sugar, sorghum, and
so forth, will naturally disappear. The five grains will not grow; instead

all there will be is tares. In these times such luxurious fabrics as brocade,  
fine silk, cotton, and linen will all become unavailable. All there will be  
is rough textiles and straw clothes.  
In these times the earth will produce nothing but thorns, horseflies,  
hornets, vipers, and venomous insects. Gold, silver, beryl, the seven precious  
metals, gems, and jewels will naturally be buried underground. The only  
thing there will be is rocks and sand; the world will be teeming with filth.  
In these times sentient beings will do nothing but exacerbate the ten kinds  
of unwholesome behavior. No one will ever even hear mention of the ten  
kinds of wholesome behavior. There won’t even be mention of the word  
“wholesome”; how could there be such a thing as wholesome behavior?  
During these times people do not respect their parents, nor do they  
respect their teachers. Those who do evil are allowed to make offerings.  
Their respect [for unwholesome behavior] is like the way present-day  
people love and obey their parents and respect their teachers, and those  
who do good are the ones who are able to make offerings. The respect of  
the people [of this eon] is such that those who do evil are able to make  
offerings. When the people of these times die they fall into rebirth as ani-  
mals, the same way that present-day people are able to be reborn in a  
heaven. When they see each other the people of these times harbor ven-  
omous thoughts, thinking only of killing each other. They are just like a  
hunter who on seeing a herd of deer thinks only of killing them, without  
one wholesome thought. These people are like this. Desiring only to kill  
each other, they give rise to not a single wholesome thought.  
During these times the earth is covered with ravines, valleys, mountains,  
and hills—there is no level ground. In these times, people cower in fear  
and their hair stands on end when others approach them. In these times,  
people are menaced by swords seven days a week. They grasp hold of  
plants and trees, tiles and stones, trying to fashion anything into a sword.  
The swords are so sharp that they cut anything they brush up against, and  
so people continuously injure each other. Living among them the wise  
see this continual warfare and run away in fear, hiding in the mountains  
among steep precipices where there are no other people. Hiding themselves  
away for seven days, they spontaneously say, “I do not harm others, so

others should not harm me.” During those seven days they survive on
grasses and roots. After seven days, they return from the mountains.
Then a person happens to see someone else. Elated, he says, “I see a
living person! I see a living person!” Just like parents who have been long
separated from their only child, they jump with joy, unable to control them-
selves. The person [who has just emerged from the mountain hideout] is
the same way—jumping for joy, unable to control himself. During these
times the people cry with each other seven days of the week, and then for
another seven days they amuse each other with games, joyfully congratulating
each other. When these people die they all fall into the hells. Why? Because
they have always harbored anger and have inflicted harm upon each other.
They lack compassion and kindness. This is the eon of warfare.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
What is the eon of famine? During these times people move around law-
lessly. Under the influence of wrong views and cognitive distortions they
carry out the ten kinds of unwholesome behavior. Because of this unwhole-
some behavior, the heavens offer no rain and all the plants wither and die.
The five grains do not mature, remaining as mere stalks. What is famine?
In these times, just to survive, people scrape the fields, roads, and highways
for garbage and chaff. This is famine. Furthermore, in times of famine
people survive by collecting skeletons in the roads, the markets, the
slaughter houses, and burial grounds; they boil them down and drink the
broth. This is called famine of starvation.
Furthermore, during an eon of famine the five cultvated grains become
extinct, changing into ordinary plants. During these times people gather
the blossoms [of these ordinary plants], boil them down, and drink the
broth. Furthermore, in times of famine, when the blossoms of plants drop
off they become buried under the ground. People survive in these times
by digging up the ground to get these blossoms and boiling them down
for consumption. This is called the “famine of [surviving on nothing but]
plants.” During these times, when people die they fall into rebirth as
hungry ghosts. Why? Because people who live during the eon of famine
continually harbor avarice, having no inclinations toward generosity. They

do not care to share, nor do they think about the trouble they cause for  
others. This is the eon of famine.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

What is the eon of pestilence? During these times people cultivate the  
right Dharma and right views, not mistaken views. While the people are  
fully carrying out the ten kinds of wholesome behavior, spirits come from  
other realms. These spirits are unruly and debauched, and they are unable  
to protect people. These spirits from other realms harass the people of  
this world. They beat them and flog them, sapping their vitality, causing  
them to be confused, harassing them and chasing them. It is as if a king  
had directed his generals to allow brigands from other regions to invade  
and harass those they are supposed to protect, and the unruly brigands  
menace towns throughout the country. The spirits from these other realms  
come and snatch the people of this world, beat them and flog them, sap  
their vitality, and harass and chase them.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

Even if the spirits of this world are not unruly and debauched, mighty spirits  
will come from other realms and the spirits of this world will be scared and  
flee. These powerful spirits will harass the people. They will beat them and  
flog them, sap their vitality, slaughter them, and drive them away.  
It is as if a king had banished the generals charged with protecting his  
citizens. The generals, being pure and honest, are not at all self-indulgent.  
In another land, however, there are ferocious generals who lead their huge  
armies to attack the towns and cities, plundering with impunity. Even if  
the spirits in this world do not dare to be self-indulgent, mighty spirits  
will come from other realms and the spirits of this realm will flee in fright.  
Those mighty spirits will harass the people, beat them and flog them, sap  
their vitality, slaughter them, and drive them away.  
People who live during an eon of pestilence are reborn into a heavenly  
realm when they die. Why? Because people who live during these times  
have compassion for each other. They continually ask each other, “Are  
you sick? Are you well? Are you alright? Are you troubled?” Because of

this, one is able to be reborn into the heavens. Hence it is called the eon
of pestilence.
These are the three medium-length eons.

#### Article 12: The Original

#### Conditions of the World

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

At the beginning, when this eon began to evolve after the destruction of
the previous eon by fire, the remaining sentient beings, having exhausted
their predispositional forces, merits, and life spans, died in Ābhāsvara
Heaven (i.e., the highest attainable heaven in the second meditative state
of absorption) and were reborn in the vast empty space of Brahmā Heaven.
They became fond of that abode and wished to be born there again together
with other sentient beings. In this way, the [first generation] of sentient
beings there had already become attached to that abode. As other sentient
beings ended their life in Ābhāsvara Heaven and were reborn in the vast
empty space of Brahmā Heaven, those who were already there thought
to themselves, “I am Brahmā, the great Brahmā. By nature I exist, and
there is no one who can create me. I am omniscient and control a thousand
worlds in which I am the absolutely free presider, for I have the miraculous
power of changing forms and bringing them into being. I am the father
and mother of all sentient beings.”
Those who came after the first generation thought to themselves, “Our
predecessor, the first Brahmā, is the king of the Brahmā gods, the great
king Brahmā. He has created himself and no one else could create him.
He is omniscient and controls a thousand worlds where he is the absolutely
free and most honorable presider, receiving no orders from anyone, for
he has the miraculous power of changing forms and bringing them into
being. He is the father and mother of all sentient beings and we were cre-
ated by him.” The countenance of the king of the Brahmā gods always
resembled that of a youth, so he has been called a youth. When this world
was evolving, many sentient beings who had been born in it were reborn
in Ābhāsvara Heaven. Once there, they flew in the air using supernormal
power, their bodies were luminous, and they naturally subsisted on joy.

They enjoyed a life of happiness and ease, free from all obstructions, and  
their life span was eternal.  
Then this world was engulfed in a great flood and totally inundated.  
Total darkness in heaven and earth prevailed; neither the sun, moon, or  
stars shone, and there were no days or nights, no months or years, only  
total darkness. Later, when the water had changed into solid ground, the  
heavenly beings who had exhausted their predispositional forces, merits,  
and life spans died in Ābhāsvara Heaven and were reborn in this new  
world. Yet they still flew in the air with a supernormal power, their bodies  
remained luminous, and they continued to subsist on joy and to exist in  
this new world for some time. Though there were distinctions between  
male and female, noble and ignoble, and those of higher and lower rank,  
they had no names to distinguish themselves, and since they were born  
along with other beings they simply called themselves sentient beings.  
At that time, out of the compassion of nature, an edible form of clay  
began to well up and congeal on the ground, like cream turning into butter.  
The outflow of the edible clay with the texture of raw cheese and a honey-  
like taste was exactly like that. The second-born sentient beings used their  
fingers to taste it and once they came to know its taste, they were addicted  
to its sweetness. The habit spread from one to another with no letup in sight,  
and soon they were openhandedly partaking of it, scooping it up in big  
lumps. Other sentient beings observed their behavior and they too began  
to imitate it; soon their indulgence also turned into addiction. [Before long]  
the food they were consuming caused their bodies to turn coarse and their  
luminosity became intermittent. No longer could they fly through the air.  
There was still no sun or moon, but now the light the sentient beings had  
brought with them was lost and heaven and earth were as dark as they had  
been previously. It was no different from how it had been after the flood.  
After an indeterminate length of time, a great storm blew in, ripping  
the great ocean apart to a depth of eighty-four thousand _yojana_ s and cre-  
ating a palace for the sun on the mid-slope of Mount Sumeru. Now the  
passage of the sun, arising in the east and setting in the west, rotating over  
heaven and earth, was set. On the second day, when the sun rose in the  
east and set in the west, some of the sentient beings said, “This is yester-  
day.” Others said, “No, this is not yesterday.” On the third day, after going

around Mount Sumeru, the sun arose in the east and set in the west. The
sentient beings then said, “Definitely, this has been one whole day.” Thus
the length of a day is marked by the reappearance of the previous [sun]light.
Because of this, it is called “day.”
We think of the sun in two ways: (1) as abiding and perpetually travers-
ing, and (2) as the palace [where it abides]. From the palace, all four direc-
tions are observable to the farthest distance; hence the palace has a circular
shape. The sun is composed, in part, of heavenly gold in which warmth
and coldness are mixed, and in part, of glass: (1) the gold is genuine, without
admixture, transparent both within and without, and shines its light on the
farthest objects; (2) the glass is also genuine, without admixture, transparent
within and without, and shines its light on the farthest objects.
The palace of the sun is fifty yojana s long and wide. The palace walls,
like the thin surface of the ground beneath, resemble the surrounding
[seven] lines of trees. The walls are sevenfold and concentric, embellished
with seven railings, seven ornamental nets from which seven bells are
suspended, and seven lines of trees, all adorned with seven kinds of treas-
ure. The golden wall is endowed with silver gates, the silver wall with
golden gates, the quartz wall with lapis gates, the lapis wall with quartz
gates, the ruby wall with agate gates, the agate wall with gates made of
rubies, and the emerald wall with gates adorned with a variety of precious
stones. The railings are decorated in a similar way: the golden railing is
decorated with silver ropes, the silver railing with golden ropes, the quartz
railing with lapis ropes, the lapis railing with quartz ropes, the ruby railing
with agate ropes, the agate railing with ropes made of rubies, and the
emerald railing with a variety of precious stones. Over these railings are
draped ornamental nets, on which various treasures are attached. From
the golden net hangs a silver bell; from the silver net hangs a golden bell;
from the lapis net hangs a quartz bell; from the quartz net hangs a lapis
bell; from the ruby net hangs an agate bell; from the agate net hangs a
bell made of rubies; and from the emerald net hangs a bell inlaid with
various precious stones. The golden trees have silver flowers and fruit.
The silver trees have golden flowers and fruit. The quartz trees have lapis
flowers and leaves, and the lapis tree has quartz flowers and leaves. The
ruby tree has agate flowers and leaves, and the agate tree has flowers and

leaves made of rubies. The emerald tree has flowers and leaves made of  
various precious stones. Each of the seven walls has four gates, one on  
each side, and each gateway stands seven stories high and is protected by  
railings. On top of each wall is a pavilion with a veranda, and each wall  
encloses a bathing pond and pleasure garden filled with flowers made of  
precious materials. The walls are surrounded by fruit trees with flowers  
and leaves shining in variegated hues, exquisite fragrances waft in all  
directions, and innumerable rare birds sing harmoniously together.  
The palace of the sun is upheld by five kinds of wind: (1) a wind that  
maintains, (2) a wind that nurtures, (3) a wind that receives, (4) a wind that  
changes, and (5) a wind that adjusts. The main pavilion, where the sun god  
dwells, is composed of genuine gold. It is fifteen _yojana_ s high and endowed  
with four gates, one on each side, protected by railings. The throne of the  
sun god, half a _yojana_ long and wide, is made from the seven kinds of treas-  
ure. The seat is pure and as soft to the touch as a heavenly garment. From  
it the sun god shines his light to illumine the golden pavilion. The light  
reflecting from this pavilion illumines the entire palace of the sun, and the  
light reflecting from this palace illumines the four heavens and earths of  
this world. The life span of the sun god is five hundred years in the celestial  
scale, and there is no gap in the succession of generations. The palace cannot  
be destroyed by any event, except at the end of each eon.  
When the palace of the sun traverses the sky, the sun god makes no  
effort to accomplish its movement. “Ever progressing on this steady pas-  
sage,” he says, “I enjoy it as an expression of the five kinds of desire.”  
As the palace of the sun continues on its journey, innumerable hundreds  
of thousands of great heavenly spirits participate in the procession before  
it. There is no end to pleasure, and the sun relishes its swiftness and  
urgency. Because of this, the sun god is called Swift and Urgent. From  
his body one thousand lights emanate, five hundred of which illuminate  
the world below while the other five hundred shine around him in every  
direction. Being in possession of an array of one thousand lights is his  
reward for merit accumulated in past lives. Because of this, the sun god  
is also called Thousand Lights.  
What kind of merit accumulates in one’s past? One example is the  
charity people provide by serving food to _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s or

by rescuing people from destitution with food and drink, articles of cloth-
ing, perhaps some medicine or transportation on a vehicle, horse, or ele-
phant, or offering a room to stay in, perhaps in a hotel, or a lamp to see
or even mere candlelight. In providing charity, one gives things to others
in accordance with their needs, and one should not do it hastily but strive
to give what is needed without offending the person, serving in this way
as a representative of the saintly disciples who adhere to moral discipline
( śīla ). Thus, because of innumerable causes and conditions related to
experiences of delight in the Dharma and illumination by the light of wis-
dom, one’s mind gradually becomes imbued with a feeling of joy and a
spirit of goodness. It is like the kṣatriya king whose head is anointed with
water when he ascends the throne for the first time, filling his mind with
supreme joy and a spirit of goodwill. Upon his death, based on these
causes and conditions, he is reborn as the sun god and accedes to the
palace of the sun, endowed with an array of one thousand lights. Thus the
proverb says, “Good karma results in the acquisition of a thousand lights.”
Why is the sun regarded as the lights of past karma? Suppose that people
adhere to the precepts, such as refraining from taking life, refraining from
taking that which is not given, refraining from sexual misconduct, refraining
from prevarication, refraining from abusive speech, refraining from speaking
falsehoods, refraining from flattery, refraining from avarice, refraining
from anger, and refraining from holding wrong views. Based on their causes
and conditions, they may acquire a mind of joy and goodness. It is like a
great bathing pond at the crossroads of a highway: since it is pure and
clean, those who have traveled a long distance and who have become
extremely tired and thirsty will come to bathe in it, and they will delight
in its coolness that brings happiness and joy. It is exactly like the mind of
joy and goodness experienced by those who adhere to the ten norms of
conduct. After death, they are reborn as the sun god and reside in the palace
of the sun, endowed with an array of a thousand lights. Because of this,
the sun god is called the Thousand Lights that result from good karma.
Sixty kṣaṇa s (moments) make up a single laya; thirty laya s make up
a single muhūrta, and one hundred muhūrta s make up a single upamā.
The palace of the sun god goes through the southern sky for six months,
each day proceeding thirty li. The most southerly course does not go

beyond the limits of the continent of Jambudvīpa. The course of the sun  
through the northern sky is exactly parallel to its southern course.  
Why does the [warmth from the] sun feel hot enough to burn? There  
are ten reasons. What are the ten? (1) Not far from Mount Sumeru is  
Mount Khadira, forty-two thousand _yojana_ s high and forty-two thousand  
_yojana_ s long and wide, with foothills that are limitless in extent, all con-  
taining the seven kinds of treasure. When the sun illumines this mountain,  
heat is created by that contact. This is the first reason the sun is burning  
hot. (2) In front of Mount Khadira is Mount Yisha, twenty-one thousand  
_yojana_ s high and twenty-one thousand _yojana_ s long and wide, with  
foothills that are limitless in extent, all containing the seven kinds of treas-  
ure. When the sun illumines this mountain, heat is created by that contact.  
This is the second reason the sun is burning hot. (3) In front of Mount  
Yisha lies Mount Shuti, twelve thousand _yojana_ s high and twelve thousand  
_yojana_ s long and wide, possessing foothills that are limitless in extent,  
all containing the seven kinds of treasure. When the sun illumines this  
mountain, heat is created by that contact. This is the third reason the sun  
is burning hot. (4) In front of Mount Shuti lies Mount Sudṛśa, six thousand  
_yojana_ s high and all of six thousand _yojana_ s long and wide, possessing  
foothills that are limitless in extent, all containing the seven kinds of treas-  
ure. When the sun illumines this mountain, heat is created by that contact.  
This is the fourth reason the sun is burning hot. (5) In front of Mount  
Sudṛśa lies Mount Masi, three thousand _yojana_ s high and three thousand  
_yojana_ s long and wide, possessing foothills that are limitless in extent,  
all containing the seven kinds of treasure. When the sun illumines this  
mountain, heat is created by that contact. This is the fifth reason the sun  
is burning hot. (6) In front of Mount Masi lies Mount Nimi, twelve hundred  
_yojana_ s high and twelve hundred _yojana_ s long and wide, possessing  
foothills that are limitless in extent, all containing the seven kinds of treas-  
ure. When the sun illumines this mountain, heat is created by that contact.  
This is the sixth reason the sun is burning hot. (7) In front of Mount Nimin  
lies Mount Diaofu, six hundred _yojana_ s high and six hundred _yojana_ s  
long and wide, with foothills that are limitless in extent, all containing  
the seven kinds of treasure. When the sun illumines this mountain, heat  
is created by that contact. This is the seventh reason the sun is burning

hot. (8) In front of Mount Diaofu lies Mount Jinganglun, three hundred
yojana s high and three hundred yojana s long and wide, with foothills that
are limitless in extent, all containing the seven kinds of treasure. When
the sun illumines this mountain, heat is created by that contact. This is
the eighth reason the sun is burning hot. (9) Again, ten thousand yojana s
out in space is a celestial palace called the “constellation,” [make endnote
and give more information on this] made entirely from lapis lazuli. When
the sun illumines this palace, heat is created by that contact. This is the
ninth reason the sun is burning hot. (10) Again, light from the palace of
the sun illumines the earth and heat is created by its contact with the
ground. This is the tenth reason the sun is burning hot.
Then the World-honored One uttered the following verse:
On the basis of these ten reasons,
The sun is called Thousand Lights.
The radiance of the sun’s shining
Heats [everything upon contact].
This is the Buddha’s discourse on the sun.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
Why is the winter palace of the sun so cold and difficult to be near?
Though the sun is shining, why is [the temperature] cool? There are thir-
teen reasons it is cool in winter even though the sun shines. What are the
thirteen? (1) There is water between Mount Sumeru and Mount Khadira,
an expanse as great as eighty-four thousand yojana s long and wide but
of limitless extent. In this lake grow many varieties of water lilies, including
the utpala, kumuda, padma, puṇḍarīka, and sugandha. When the sun
shines on the flowers, coolness is created by that contact. This is the first
reason the sun’s light is cool [in winter]. (2) There is water between Mount
Khadira and Mount Yisha, an expanse as great as forty-two thousand
yojana s long and wide but of limitless extent. In this lake grow many
varieties of water plants. When the sun shines on the flowers, coolness is
created by that contact. This is the second reason the sun’s light is cool
[in winter]. (3) There is water between Mount Yisha and Mount Shuti, an
expanse as great as twenty-one thousand yojana s long and wide but of

limitless extent. In this lake grow many varieties of water plants. When  
the sun shines on the flowers, coolness is created by that contact. This is  
the third reason the sun’s light is cool [in winter]. (4) There is water  
between Mount Shuti and Mount Sudṛśa, an expanse as great as twelve  
thousand _yojana_ s long and wide but of limitless extent. In this lake grow  
many varieties of water plants. When the sun shines on the flowers, cool-  
ness is created by that contact. This is the fourth reason the sun’s light is  
cool [in winter]. (5) There is water between Mount Sudṛśa and Mount  
Massu, an expanse as great as six thousand _yojana_ s long and wide but of  
limitless extent. In this lake grow many varieties of water plants. When  
the sun shines on the flowers, coolness is created by that contact. This is  
the fifth reason the sun’s light is cool [in winter]. (6) There is water between  
Mount Massu and Mount Nimin, an expanse as great as twelve hundred  
_yojana_ s long and wide but of limitless extent. In this lake grow many  
varieties of water plants. When the sun shines on the flowers, coolness is  
created by that contact. This is the sixth reason the sun’s light is cool [in  
winter]. (7) There is water between Mount Nimin and Mount Diaofu, an  
expanse as great as six hundred _yojana_ s in length and breadth but with  
limitless extent. In this lake grow many varieties of water plants. When  
the sun shines on the flowers, coolness is created by that contact. This is  
the seventh reason the sun’s light is cool [in winter]. (8) There is water  
between Mount Diaofu and Mount Jinganglun, an expanse as great as  
three hundred _yojana_ s long and wide but of limitless extent. In this lake  
grow many varieties of water plants. When the sun shines on the flowers,  
coolness is created by that contact. This is the eighth reason the sun’s light  
is cool [in winter]. (9) Again, there are great oceans, rivers, and streams  
on the continent of Jambudvīpa. When the sun shines on them, coolness  
is created by its contact with those waters. This is the ninth reason the  
sun’s light is cool [in winter]. (10) Although the continent of [Apara-]  
godānīya has fewer rivers than Jambudvīpa, it contains many water-related  
objects. When the sun shines on them, coolness is created by that contact.  
This is the tenth reason the sun’s light is cool [in winter]. (11) Although  
the continent of Pūrvavideha has fewer rivers than [Apara]godānīya, there  
are many more bodies of water there. When the sun shines on them, cool-  
ness is created by that contact. This is the eleventh reason the sun’s light

is cool [in winter]. (12) Although the continent of Uttarakuru has fewer
rivers than Pūrvavideha, there are many more bodies of water there. When
the sun shines on them, coolness is created by that contact. This is the
twelfth reason the sun’s light is cool [in winter]. (13) Again, light from
the palace of the sun shines on the great ocean, and when the sun shines
on it coolness is created by that contact. This is the thirteenth reason the
sun’s light is cool [in winter].
Then the World-honored One uttered the following verse:
On the basis of these thirteen reasons,
The sun is called Thousand Lights.
The sun’s shining is clean and cool.
This is the Buddha’s discourse on the sun.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
The moon has but a single palace, its roundness waxes and wanes, and
its light increases and diminishes. Because of this, the palace of the moon
is called Juan. We think of the moon in two ways: (1) as abiding and per-
petually traversing, and (2) as the palace [where it abides]. From the
palace, all four directions are observable to the farthest distance; hence
the palace has a circular shape. The moon is composed, in part, of heavenly
silver in which coldness and warmth are mixed, and in part, of lapis lazuli:
(1) the silver is genuine, without admixture, transparent both within and
without, and shines its light on the farthest objects; (2) the lapis is also
genuine, without admixture, transparent within and without, and shines
its light on the farthest objects.
The palace of the moon is forty-nine yojana s long and wide. The palace
walls, like the thin surface of the ground beneath, resemble the surrounding
lines of trees. The walls are sevenfold and concentric, embellished with
seven railings, seven ornamental nets from which seven bells are sus-
pended, and seven lines of trees, all adorned with the seven kinds of treas-
ure, with innumerable rare birds singing harmoniously together.
The palace of the moon is upheld by five kinds of wind: (1) a wind
that maintains, (2) a wind that nurtures, (3) a wind that receives, (4) a
wind that changes, and (5) a wind that adjusts. The main pavilion, where

the moon god dwells, is made of genuine lapis. It is sixteen _yojana_ s high  
and endowed with four gates, one on each side, protected by railings. The  
throne of the moon god, half a _yojana_ long and wide, is made from the  
seven kinds of treasure. The seat is pure and as soft to the touch as a heav-  
enly garment. From it the moon god shines his light to illumine the lapis  
pavilion. The light shining from this pavilion illumines the entire palace  
of the moon, and the light shining from this palace illumines the four  
heavens and earths of this world. The life span of the moon god is five  
hundred years in the celestial scale, and there is no gap in the succession  
of generations. The palace cannot be destroyed by any event, except at  
the end of each eon.  
When the palace of the moon traverses the sky, the moon god makes  
no effort to accomplish its movement. “Ever progressing on this steady  
passage,” he says, “I enjoy it as an expression of the five kinds of desire.”  
As the palace of the moon continues on its journey, innumerable hundreds  
of thousands of great heavenly spirits participate in the procession before  
it. There is no end to pleasure, and the moon relishes its swiftness and  
urgency. Because of this, the moon god is called Swift and Urgent. From  
his body one thousand lights emanate, five hundred of which illuminate  
the world below while the other five hundred shine around him in every  
direction. Being in possession of an array of one thousand lights is his  
reward for merit accumulated in past lives. Because of this, the moon god  
is also called Thousand Lights.  
What kind of merit accumulates in one’s past? One example is the  
charity people provide by serving food to _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s or  
by rescuing people from destitution with food and drink, articles of clothing,  
perhaps some medicine or transportation on a vehicle, horse, or elephant,  
or a room to stay in, perhaps in a hotel, or a lamp to see or even mere can-  
dlelight. In providing charity, one gives things to others in accordance  
with their needs, and one should not do it hastily but strive to give what  
is needed without offending the person, serving in that way as a repre-  
sentative of the saintly disciples who adhere to moral discipline. Thus,  
because of innumerable causes and conditions related to experiences of  
delight in the Dharma and illumination by the light of wisdom, one’s mind  
gradually becomes imbued with a feeling of joy and a spirit of goodness.

It is like the kṣatriya king whose head is anointed with water when he
ascends the throne for the first time, filling his mind with supreme joy
and a spirit of goodwill. Upon his death, based on these causes and con-
ditions, he is reborn as the moon god and ascends to the palace of the
moon, endowed with an array of one thousand lights. Thus the proverb
says, “Good karma results in the acquisition of a thousand lights.”
Why is the moon regarded as the lights of past karma? Suppose that
people adhere to the precepts, such as refraining from taking life, refraining
from taking that which is not given, refraining from sexual misconduct,
refraining from prevarication, refraining from abusive spech, refraining
from speaking falsehoods, refraining from flattering, refraining from avarice,
refraining from anger, and refraining from taking wrong views. Based on
their causes and conditions, they may acquire a mind of joyful goodness.
It is like a great bathing pond at the crossroads of a highway crossroad:
since it is pure and clean, those who have traveled a long distance and who
have become extremely tired and thirsty will come to bathe in it and delight
in its coolness that brings happiness and joy. It is exactly like the mind of
joy and goodness that those who adhere to the ten norms of conduct expe-
rience. After death, they are reborn as the moon god and reside in the palace
of the moon, endowed with an array of a thousand lights. Because of this,
the moon god is called the Thousand Lights resulting from good karma.
Sixty kṣaṇa s (moments) make up a single laya; thirty laya s make up
a single muhūrta, and one hundred muhūrta s make up a single upamā.
The palace of the moon god goes through the southern sky for six months,
each day proceeding thirty li. The most southerly course does not go
beyond the limits of the continent of Jambudvīpa. The course of the moon
through the northern sky is exactly parallel to its southern course.
Why does the palace of the moon appear to gradually wane? There are
three reasons. What are the three? (1) The moon gets out of “Wei.”^28 This
is the first reason that it wanes. (2) Again, there are ministers in the palace
of the moon who wear blue garments in proper order, with the garments
of each higher position being a deeper blue. Each day, [the number of the
ministers in attendance] diminishes, causing it to wane. (3) Again, the
palace of the sun illumines the moon’s palace with sixty lights. Because
of the way light reflects, some portion of the moon does not appear. Since

the moon’s appearance depends on the degree of reflection, it wanes.  
These are the three reasons the moon’s light diminishes.  
Again, why does the palace of the moon gradually increase? Again,  
there are three reasons the moon’s light increases. What are the three? (1)  
The moon gradually turns to face us directly. This is the first reason it  
waxes. (2) All the ministers in the palace of the moon wear blue garments.  
On the fifteenth day, when the moon god takes his seat at the center to  
enjoy his meeting with them, his light illumines [the entire palace], out-  
shining the other lunar gods just as a large bonfire [overpowers the light  
of nearby] candles. This is the second reason it waxes. (3) The sun illumines  
the moon’s palace with sixty lights but on the fifteenth day the moon god  
illumines his entire palace with his own light, letting no portion fall under  
a shadow from the sun’s illumination. This is the third reason the moon  
waxes to its full extent.  
Again, why does the moon have dark spots? The dark shadows on the  
moon are caused by shadows cast by Jambu trees.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

The mind should be as clean and cool as the heatless moon. When visiting  
donors’ houses your mind must be kept in concentration, so as not to be  
disturbed. Again, why are there so many great rivers and streams? Tem-  
peratures rise because of the sun and moon, and because of their heat,  
moxa is burned. Burning moxa produces sweat, and from the sweat great  
rivers and streams are created. Hence there are great rivers and streams  
in this world.  
Why are there five kinds of seeds in this world? Because a great storm  
blows seeds to this world from the world where everything is preserved  
without deterioration, we have (1) roots as seeds, (2) stalks as seeds, (3)  
nodes as seeds, (4) seeds that are hollow inside, and (5) offspring as seeds.  
Hence there are five kinds of seed forms in this world.  
When it is midday on the continent of Jambudvīpa, the sun is setting  
on the continent of Pūrvavideha in the east and rising above the continent  
of [Apara]godānīya in the west, while it is midnight on the continent of  
Uttara kuru in the north. When it is midday in [Apara]godānīya, the sun  
is setting in Jambudvīpa and rising in Uttarakuru, while it is midnight in

[Pūrva] videha. When it is midday in Uttarakuru, the sun is setting in
[Apara] godānīya and rising in [Pūrva]videha, while it is midnight in
Jambud vīpa. When it is midday in [Pūrva]videha, the sun is setting in
Uttara kuru and rising in Jambudvīpa, while it is midnight in [Apara] -
godānīya. Here when Jambudvīpa is in the east [at sunrise], [Pūrva]videha
is in the west. If Jambudvīpa is in the west [at sunset], [Pūrva]videha is
in the east. If [Apara]godānīya is in the west, Uttarakuru is in the east. If
Uttarakuru is in the west, [Apara] godānīya is in the east.
The reason the southern continent is called Jambu[dvīpa] is because
there is a large gold mine below ground that is thirty yojana s deep. Since
there are Jambu trees growing on this continent, the gold there is called
jambu gold. The fruit of the Jambu tree is like a mushroom and tastes as
sweet as honey. Each Jambu tree has five clusters of fruit; four are attached
on the four sides of the tree while the fifth is on top. The fruit facing east
is eaten by the gandharva demigods. The fruit facing south is eaten by
the people of the seven countries: (1) Kuru, (2) Kurupa (?), (3) Videha,
(4) Śveta (?), (5) Maṇḍa, (6) Bala, and (7) Bali. The fruit facing west is
eaten by the creatures of the ocean. The fruit facing north is eaten by birds
and animals. The fruit on top is eaten by the gods of the stars and con-
stellations. To the north of the seven countries are seven great dark hills:
(1) Luotu, (2) Baihe, (3) Shougong, (4) Xianshan, (5) Gaoshan, (6) Chan-
shan, and (7) Tushan. On these seven hills live seven brāhmaṇa sages
and their abodes are called (1) Shanti, (2) Shanguang, (3) Shougong, (4)
Xianren, (5) Hegong, (6) Jiana, and (7) Zengyi.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
At the outset of the present eon, sentient beings survived by subsisting
on a type of mud cake. Those who ate large quantities lost their complex-
ions, while those who ate less retained good complexions. As they began
to recognize differences between facial features and complexions, they
started to argue about whose was superior, and whose was inferior. “I am
superior to you,” they would think. “You do not look like me.” Thus they
became aware of differences between themselves and others, and this
gave rise to feelings of competition and conflict. As the mud cakes began

to disappear, a new kind of growth in the soil, like a thin rice cake,  
appeared, and it was fragrant and appetizing.  
Since the previous type of food was no longer available, the sentient  
beings gathered together to beat their breasts and lament, “What a disaster!”  
This is like people today who enjoy a meal and praise it as good food,  
and later on, when it is no longer available, they are distressed by the fact  
that it is no longer available. These cases are exactly alike. The sentient  
beings refined their taste by eating the new growth in the soil, but those  
who ate large quantities lost their complexions, while those who ate less  
retained good complexions. As they began to recognize more differences  
between facial features and complexions, they argued about whose was  
superior, and whose was inferior. “I am superior to you,” they thought.  
“You are not like me.” Thus they became aware of differences between  
themselves and others, giving rise to feelings of competition and conflict.  
Then the new food growing in the soil disappeared.  
A new kind of product began to grow from the soil, rather thick in  
appearance but as delicate as a heavenly garment inside, with a color like  
a celestial lotus blossom and its taste was as sweet as honey. All the sentient  
beings were able to survive on this food for some length of time, but those  
who ate large quantities lost their complexions, while those who ate less  
retained good complexions. Then they began to recognize still more dif-  
ferences between facial features and complexions and features, saying, “I  
am superior to you” and “You are not like me.” They began to fixate on  
the differences between themselves and others, accelerating feelings of  
competition and conflict. Then the new food growing in the soil disappeared.  
Again, a form of rice without gluten or chaff began to grow, providing  
the sentient beings with a new food that could be eaten without seasoning.  
Still, however, the people gathered together to beat their breasts and lament,  
“What a disaster!” since the old food could no longer be found. It is like  
people today who regard as a disaster when a favorite food is no longer  
available. It is just like that. So the sentient beings began to harvest the  
new form of rice and subsist on it.  
Then their physical forms became coarse and crude, with the advent  
of male and female sexual organs. Staring at each other, some felt desire

and sought hidden places to engage in sexual intercourse. Observing this,
the other sentient beings deplored it: “This is wrong. When we were all
born in the same place, how can some of us behave like that?” Seeing
their disapproval, the one they condemned regretted his conduct and admit-
ted, “What I have done is wrong.” He threw himself to the ground and
remained there. [Now] seeing that he would not get up, the woman decided
to bring him food. The others asked, “What will you do with this food
you have taken?” She replied, “I shall give it to that man who is regretting
his fall into wrongdoing.” Because of her reply, the term “no-good husband’
came into this world, and also the name “wife,” from the fact that she
brought cooked rice to [the man].
After that, the sentient beings became increasingly indulgent in sexual
behavior, and to hide their conduct they began to build private shelters.
Because of this, the term “house” came into use for the first time. Later gen-
erations found their sexual desires increasing, and eventually the institution
of marriage between husband and wife was introduced. When sentient
beings who had exhausted their predispositional forces, merits, and life
spans died in Ābhāsvara Heaven, they came to the human world to enter
a mother’s womb. Because of this, we have the term “fetus” [in which
the individual person resides].
The city of Campā was built at that time. Then the city of Vārāṇasī
was built in the country of Kāśī. Next, the city of Rājagṛha was built, and
it was completed at sunrise. Because of this, we have names for all the
cities, towns, villages, and territories the kings ruled.
When the sentient beings of that time harvested rice in the morning
for breakfast, the rice grains that remained would ripen again by evening.
Even when [the rice] was harvested in the evening, it would be ripe again
the next morning, and all the rice would grow without any stalks or stubble.
Then some [lazy] people began to think, “Harvesting rice every day
is too much work. Why don’t we harvest enough rice for two days?” So
they harvested enough to serve two days of meals and put some of it away
in storage. Later, when friends would say, “Let us go harvest some rice
together,” they would reply, “I have already harvested enough for two
days. If you wish to go, why don’t you go without me?” The friend would
then think, “He harvested enough rice for two days and stored the amount

needed. Why don’t I harvest and store up enough for three days?” So that  
man did so, and when another friend came along to ask him to harvest  
rice together, he replied, “I have already harvested and stored what I need  
for three days. If you wish to go, why don’t you go without me?” That  
friend also thought, “He has harvested enough rice for three days and  
stored the amount needed. Why don’t I harvest and store enough for five  
days?” He did so, and soon all the sentient beings were trying to outdo  
each other in harvesting rice. Thus the rice crop was overharvested and  
became barren and weed-ridden, and finally it began to produce only  
husks. Once cut, it would not grow again, leaving only withered stubble.  
So the sentient beings gathered together to beat their breasts and lament,  
“What a series of disasters! Originally, we were superhuman beings, sub-  
sisting on thoughts. Our bodies were luminous and we flew through the  
air and were able to enjoy happiness without any obstacles whatsoever.  
Then, when food from the ground grew for the first time, we were attracted  
by its color and taste and we ate it, and it kept us in this world for some  
time. Those who ate large quantities [of the food], however, saw their  
skin turn rough and ugly, while those who ate less retained good com-  
plexions. This caused us to begin to discriminate between ourselves and  
others. Those [who appeared handsome] became conceited, saying, ‘I am  
superior to you. Your skin is not like mine.’ While we argued about these  
things our food disappeared.  
“New food began to grow, and it was fragrant and pleasing to the eye  
and had a good taste. We harvested it and continued to survive in this  
world by subsisting on it. Those who ate large quantities [of the food],  
however, lost their complexions, while those who ate less retained good  
complexions. Because of this, some of us became conceited and thought,  
‘I am superior to you. Your skin is not like mine.’ While we argued about  
these things, the new food disappeared and only something coarse and  
thick would grow, some of which we could eat, but in much less quantity.  
“We harvested the new food and continued to live. Those who ate too  
much lost their complexions, while those who ate less retained theirs.  
Again, we became conceited and thought, ‘I am superior to you. Your  
skin is not like mine.’ While we argued about these things the food dis-  
appeared. What grew after it was nonglutinous rice that had an attractive

color, scent, and taste. We ate it and began to harvest it. When it was har-
vested in the morning for breakfast, the remaining rice grains would ripen
by evening. When it was harvested in the evening, it would ripen again
by morning. The best thing was that it grew without stalks or stubble. But
we competed to harvest the crop and put it in storage. Overharvested, the
rice became barren and began to form husks. Once cut, it would not grow
again, leaving only withered stubble.”
[The sentient beings said to each other,] “Let us divide the land between
us.” They created plots belonging to different owners, and once again
they began to discriminate between themselves and others. Some began
to store their own rice and to steal crops from fields belonging to others.
Observing this behavior, the others deplored it: “What you have done is
wrong. Since you have your own land, how can you steal crops from the
others?” Having reprimanded such a person, they warned him, “You must
never do it again.” Yet they could not leave the scandal of the theft behind.
Again, they reprimanded the thief, “Your conduct is wrong. You must
stop it.” Then they beat him with their fists and with a cane. Then they
led him out before an audience and said, “This man, while putting his
own rice away, has stolen it from fields belonging to others.” The accused
shouted back, “They struck me!”
Distressed, the audience beat their breasts and said, “Sentient beings
have become morally degenerate. Because of these crimes, turmoil and
filth have afflicted this society. This is why we suffer from birth, old age,
illness, and death, and why we have fallen into the three evil courses of
life. These disputes arose because the land was divided into separate
parcels and because of disagreements over the boundaries. Now, since
there is so much animosity between us, none of the disputes can be
resolved. We should select a leader [and let him deal with the disputes].
He will protect those worthy of protection, commend those worthy of
praise, and punish those in need of punishment. Each member of the com-
munity must advance a portion of their rice harvest in payment for the
services the appointed person will undertake to deal with our disputes.”
So they chose a person who was tall and physically impressive, hand-
some, and who carried an aura of authority. They said to him, “We want
you to become our elected leader to protect those in need of protection,

commend those worthy of praise, and also to punish those who should be  
punished. Each of us will collect a portion of our rice harvest to make up  
your stipend.” Then the person chosen by the community assumed the  
role of chieftain and began to dispense praise to those worthy of praise  
and punishment to those in need of punishment. Thus the word _nāyaka_  
(“people’s guide”) came into being.  
In the beginning, the leader Mahāsammata had a son, Ratna by name;  
Ratna had a son, Surasa by name; Surasa had a son, Jingji by name; Jingji  
had a son, Sucarita by name; Sucarita had a son, Zhexing by name; Zhexing  
had a son, Miaomi by name; Miaomi had a son, Miti by name; Miti had  
a son, Shuixian by name; Shuixian had a son, Śatajña by name; Śatajña  
had a son, Shiyü by name; Shiyü had a son, Shanyü by name; Shanyü had  
a son, Duanjie by name; Duanjie had a son, Daduanjie by name; Daduanjie  
had a son, Ratnākara by name; Ratnākara had a son, Mahāratnākara by  
name; Mahāratnākara had a son, Sudarśana by name; Sudarśana had a  
son, Mahāsudarśana by name; Mahāsudarśana had a son, Aśoka by name;  
Aśoka had a son, Zhouzhu by name; Zhouzhu had a son, Zhisheng by  
name; Zhisheng had a son, Shanyue by name; Shanyue had a son, Shentian  
by name; Shentian had a son, Yili by name; Yili had a son, Dṛṣharatha  
(Laoche) by name; Dṛṣharatha had a son, Daśaratha by name; Daśaratha  
had a son, Śataratha by name; Śataratha had a son, Dṛṣhadhanu by name;  
Dṛṣhadhanu had a son, Śatadhanu by name; Śatadhanu had a son, Yangmu  
by name; Yangmu had a son, Shansi by name.  
From Shansi descended ten tribal clans ruled by _cakravartin_ s in suc-  
cession without any gap. The names of the ten clans were (1) Kaṇṇagoccha,  
(2) Doluopo, (3) Aśvajit, (4) Gandhāra, (5) Kaliṅga, (6) Campā, (7) Kau-  
rava, (8) Pañcāla, (9) Mithila, and (10) Ikṣvāku. From King Kaṇṇagoccha  
five _cakravartin_ s descended; from King Doluopo five _cakravartin_ s also  
descended; from King Aśvajit seven _cakravartin_ s descended; from King  
Gandhāra seven _cakravartin_ s also descended; from King Kaliṅga nine  
_cakravartin_ s descended; from King Campā fourteen _cakravartin_ s  
descended; from King Kaurava thirty-one _cakravartin_ s descended; from  
King Pañcāla thirty-two _cakravartin_ s descended; from King Mithila eighty-  
four _cakravartin_ s descended; and from King Ikṣvāku one hundred and  
one _cakravartin_ s descended. The last king was named Anumahā Sujāta

(Dashan Shengzong). King Ikṣvāku had a son, Wuluopo by name; King
Wuluopo had a son, Kula (Quluo) by name; King Kula had a son, Nikula
(Niquluo) by name; this King Nikula had a son, Siṃhahanu by name; King
Siṃhahanu had a son, Śuddhodana by name; King Śuddhodana had a son,
Bodhisattva (i.e., the Buddha) by name; this Bodhisattva had a son, Rāhula
by name. On the basis of the foregoing genealogy, the name kṣatriya came
into being.
Once, a sentient being said to himself, “Myriad living species have all
been afflicted by thorns and infections. I should now forsake all domestic
concerns to go off into the mountains to practice meditation.” So he
renounced his domestic life, went into the mountains, and practiced med-
itation, sheltered under various trees, and every day he went into a village
for alms. When the villagers saw him they willingly offered food out of
respect, and he praised their good conduct. The fact that this man renounced
his domestic ties and sought to follow the path by entering the mountains
meant that he was freed from involvement in wrong and evil actions.
Because of this, he could be called brāhmaṇa.
Some brāhmaṇa s were unable to continue practicing meditation. They
came out of the mountains and traveled among human communities,
claiming, “I cannot practice meditation.” They called themselves “ brāh-
maṇa s without the practice of meditation.” They came down to villages,
got involved in wrong practices, and engaged in activities inconsistent
with their original aspiration. Because of this, their means of livelihood
may be termed “poisonous.” For this reason, a class of brāhmaṇa s came
into being in society who depend on various means of livelihood and make
their living among sentient beings. For similar reasons, a social class of
householders ( vaiśya ) came into being who learn different arts and skills
and in that way make their living among sentient beings. For similar reasons,
a social class of those in servitude ( śūdra ) came into being.
Śramaṇa practitioners came into being after the appearance of the
Śākya clan in society. Originally a kṣatriya, one of them thought to himself,
“All worldly love and affection in this society is inevitably defiled and
unclean. Why should I be attached to this kind of relationship? I will
renounce domestic life, shave my hair and beard, don mendicant robes,
and seek the path of religion. I am a śramaṇa, I am a śramaṇa !” [Now]

among the _brāhmaṇa_ s, _vaiśya_ s, and _śūdra_ s, some thought to themselves,  
“All worldly love and affection in this society is inevitably defiled and  
unclean. Why should I be attached to this kind of relationship? I will  
renounce domestic life, shave my hair and beard, don mendicant robes,  
and seek the path of religion. I am a _śramaṇa,_ I am a _śramaṇa_ !”  
If a _kṣatriya_ commits wrongful actions in mind, speech, or conduct,  
he receives appropriate retribution when his body dissolves and his life  
comes to an end. If _brāhmaṇa_ s, _vaiśya_ s, and _śūdra_ s commit wrongful  
actions in mind, speech, or conduct, they likewise receive appropriate ret-  
ribution when their bodies dissolve and their lives end. On the other hand,  
if a _kṣatriya_ adheres to the norms of conduct and does good in mind,  
speech, or physical action, he is rewarded with absolute happiness when  
his body dissolves and his life comes to an end. Likewise, if _brāhmaṇa_ s,  
_vaiśya_ s, or _śūdra_ s adhere to the norms of conduct and do good in thought,  
speech, or physical action, they are rewarded with absolute happiness  
when their bodies dissolve and their lives end. If a _kṣatriya_ commits both  
good and bad actions in mind, speech, or conduct, he receives appropriate  
retribution when his body dissolves and his life comes to an end. Likewise,  
if _brāhmaṇa_ s, _vaiśya_ s, or _śūdra_ s commit both good and bad actions in  
mind, speech, or conduct they receive appropriate retribution when their  
bodies dissolve and their lives come to an end.  
If a _kṣatriya_ shaves his hair and beard, dons the three mendicant robes,  
renounces domestic life, and practices the seven auxiliary disciplines in  
order to seek the path of religion, and if his faith and determination are  
firm, he should be able to transcend worldly matters, maintain the unsur-  
passed practice of austerity, and directly experience in this life that the  
cause of birth and death has been exhausted; the practice of austerity has  
been accomplished; that which must be done [for religious salvation] has  
been accomplished; and there is no more birth to suffer ever again. Like-  
wise, if one from the _brāhmaṇa,vaiśya,_ or _śūdra_ classes shaves his hair  
and beard, dons the three mendicant robes, renounces domestic life, and  
practices the sevenfold auxiliary disciplines in order to seek the path of  
religion, and if his faith and determination are firm, he should be able to  
transcend worldly matters, maintain the unsurpassed practice of austerity,  
and directly experience in this life that the cause of birth and death has

been exhausted; the practice of austerity has been accomplished; that  
which must be done [for religious salvation] has been accomplished; and  
there is no more birth to suffer ever again.  
Among the four classes of society, those who have perfected themselves  
with harmonious practice and insight and realized the state of arhatship  
(total liberation from attachment) are supreme. At that moment, the god  
Brahmā utters the following verse:  
One born in the _kṣatriya_ family is highest,  
He can assemble all the races for the practice of religion,  
Having perfected himself with harmonious practice and insight,  
He is the highest among humans and gods.  
The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:  
The god Brahmā has well uttered this verse. It is not said wrongly but is  
appropriate. His understanding is not wrong but is good. I approve his  
statement. Why? Because I also utter the same verse as the Tathāgata,  
totally liberated from defilement and perfectly enlightened:  
One born in the _kṣatriya_ family is highest,  
He can assemble all the classes for the practice of religion.  
Having perfected himself with harmonious practice and insight,  
He is the highest among humans and gods.  
Then, having heard the Buddha’s teaching, the _bhikṣu_ s were delighted to  
receive it and reverentially carried out what the Buddha taught.

The _Canonical Book of Lengthy Discourses_ has been completed in assem-  
blage. Homage to the Omniscient [One]. May all beings abide in peace and  
happiness. Let all sentient beings abide in the state of transcendence, and  
may I myself also be in that realm with them.
