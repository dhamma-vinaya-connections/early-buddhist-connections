### Lohitya

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 12: Lohicca Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. Once, when the Buddha was visiting the communities of  
the country of Kauśala, accompanied by one thousand two hundred and fifty  
_bhikṣu_ s, he stopped overnight in a _śiṃśapā_ forest north of a _brāhmaṇa_ village  
called Sālavatikā. A _brāhmaṇa_ called Lohitya resided in a grove of _śāla_ trees  
in the village, which was well populated and prosperous because King Prase-  
najit had granted it to the _brāhmaṇa_ as a fief, exempting it from taxation.  
Lohitya was from a pure family line of seven generations and was never  
slighted by anyone in society. He was thoroughly versed in the three ancient  
collections of hymns (Vedas) and had detailed knowledge of the various  
_brāhmaṇa_ scriptures, as well as a comprehensive command of the subtleties  
of secular literature. He was also well trained in reading the physiognomy  
of magnanimous personalities, in divining good and bad omens, and in con-  
ducting ceremonial proceedings and sacrificial rites.  
On that occasion, the _brāhmaṇa_ was duly informed:  
The _śramaṇa_ Gautama, son of the Śākya clan, having renounced domestic  
life and realized the ultimate spiritual goal, has been visiting the commu-  
nities of the country of Kauśala and has [now] reached the _śiṃśapā_ forest.  
Gautama’s good name is renowned and [his accomplishment] has been  
proclaimed everywhere, in all lands under the sky, as worthy of the ten  
supreme titles, namely, One Perfected in Practice, One Liberated from  
Attachment, Perfectly Enlightened One, and so on. Among all the gods  
and humans, as well as all the evil ones and their lord, and the _śramaṇa_ s  
and _brāhmaṇa_ s too, he alone has directly experienced the realization of  
enlightenment and teaches others [how to realize it]. When he expounds  
on the Dharma his words are good in the beginning, good in the middle,  
and good in the end. All the words he utters are invariably endowed with

true meanings and real essences, and are in accord with his practice of  
pure and genuine austerity.  
“Everyone should visit this sage and pay him their respects,” the _brāhmaṇa_  
said to himself. “I must now go and see him along with the others.”  
With these thoughts, the _brāhmaṇa_ left the village and soon arrived at the  
_śiṃśapā_ forest. After greeting the Buddha with a bow, he took a seat to one  
side. Thereupon, the Buddha taught him the Dharma, imparting instruction,  
benefit, and delight.  
Having heard the teaching, the _brāhmaṇa_ said, “Sir, may I request that  
the World-honored One and the members of the sangha accept my invitation  
for almsfood tomorrow.”  
The World-honored One remained silent, accepting the invitation. Observ-  
ing the Buddha’s silence, the _brāhmaṇa_ understood that his invitation had  
been accepted. He arose from his seat, circumambulated the Buddha three  
times, and then departed for home.  
Shortly after leaving the Buddha’s resting place, Lohitya erroneously  
thought to himself:

Many _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s acquire precious knowledge and receive  
a lofty spiritual experience, but they should not try to teach others about  
what they acquired or experienced. If they keep those realizations to them-  
selves there is no need to teach others. It would be like destroying an old  
prison only to build another one anew, which would be worthless and wrong.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ returned to the _śāla_ grove and prepared various dishes of  
food and drink throughout the night. When the meal was ready, he said to  
his barber, “Take this message to the _śiṃśapā_ forest and tell the _śramaṇa_  
Gautama, ‘Everything is ready, sir.’”  
The barber soon reached the resting place of the Buddha and, after ven-  
erating him, conveyed the message. The World-honored One put on his outer  
robe, and with almsbowl in hand walked to the _śāla_ grove accompanied by  
one thousand two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s. On the way, the barber, who  
had stayed in close attendance to the Buddha, rearranged his outer clothing  
to bare his right elbow and respectfully joined his palms together. Then he  
kneeled with his left knee on the ground and said to the Buddha:

Not long after leaving the Buddha’s resting place, the _brāhmaṇa_ Lohitya  
had the misconception that _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s who acquire precious  
knowledge and receive a lofty spiritual experience should not try to teach  
others about what they acquired or experienced. If they keep those real-  
izations to themselves there is no need to teach others. It would be like  
destroying an old prison only to build another one anew, which would be  
worthless and wrong. May I request that the World-honored One relieve  
[the _brāhmaṇa_ Lohitya] of this wrong view.  
The Buddha replied, “That is a minor offense that can be removed very  
easily.”  
With that, the World-honored One arrived at the _brāhmaṇa_ ’s house and  
took his seat at the place that had been made ready. Then the _brāhmaṇa_  
served the Buddha and the members of the sangha various dishes from his  
own hands. When the meal was finished, the bowls were cleaned and rinsing  
water was served. The _brāhmaṇa_ brought out a small cushion and sat down  
before the Buddha. The Buddha said to Lohitya:

Not long after you left my place last night, you had the misconception
that śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s who acquire precious knowledge and receive
a lofty spiritual experience should not try to teach others about what they
acquired or experienced. If they keep those realizations to themselves
there is no need to teach others, as the attempt would be worthless and
wrong. Now is this really what you thought?
Lohitya replied, “Yes, it is, sir.”
The Buddha said:
You should not entertain such a mistaken view. Why? Because what you
thought applies only to three kinds of [faulty] teaching. You may find
some guidance in these examples.
What are the three kinds of [faulty] teaching? Those who shave their
hair and beard, put on the three robes [of a mendicant], renounce domestic
life, and apply themselves to the practice of austerity should eradicate all
defilements in this life and advance on the path to realizing the insight
that transcends ordinary existence. The first example of [faulty] teaching
is by those who neither eradicate defilements in this life nor acquire the

insight that transcends ordinary existence, yet they presume to teach stu-
dents without having completed their own realization. Students will not
respect such a teacher, nor will they offer him due service. Because of
this, this type of teacher and his students should merely reside together
and rely on someone else’s guidance.
O Lohitya, those students may say, “O teacher, since you have shaved
your hair and beard, donned the three robes, renounced domestic life, and
applied yourself to the practice of austerity, you should have eradicated
all defilements and realized the insight that transcends ordinary existence.
However, you have not been able to do so, and you have been teaching
us without having completed your own realization.”
Thus, those students will not respect [that teacher], nor will they offer
him due service as their teacher, and both teacher and students will merely
be residing together.
The Buddha said:
O Lohitya, this is like destroying an old prison only to build another one
anew. It is a corrupt way to proceed and one should take caution, because
it bears on how the rules of the Vinaya discipline and the precepts of the
wise and saintly disciples are observed in both timing and deportment.
Again, the Buddha said to Lohitya:
The second type of [faulty] teaching is by those who have shaved their
hair and beards, put on the three robes of a mendicant, renounced domestic
life, and applied themselves to the practice of austerity, but they have not
yet been able to eradicate all defilements even though they have managed
to gain some degree of understanding regarding the insight that transcends
ordinary existence. They still teach students without having completed
their own realization. Again, a teacher and students in such a situation
should merely reside together and rely on someone else’s guidance.
O Lohitya, these students may say, “Our teacher has shaved his hair
and beard, donned the three robes, renounced domestic life, and applied
himself to the practice of austerity. He should have eradicated defilements
and realized the insight that transcends ordinary existence, but he has not
been able to eradicate all defilements. Although he has gained some degree

of understanding regarding the insight that transcends ordinary existence,  
he has been teaching us without having eradicated all defilements, and  
this has caused us to not respect him or offer him due service, and we are  
all merely residing together.”

The Buddha said:

This is like walking behind another person and rubbing that person’s  
back with your hand. It is a corrupt way to proceed and one should take  
caution, because it bears on how the rules of the Vinaya discipline and  
the precepts of the wise and saintly disciples are observed in both timing  
and deportment.

Again, the Buddha said:

The third type of [faulty] teaching is by those who have shaved their hair  
and beards, put on the three robes of a mendicant, renounced domestic  
life, and applied themselves to the practice of austerity, but they have not  
yet been able to eradicate all defilements even though they have managed  
to gain some degree of understanding regarding the insight that transcends  
ordinary existence. Still they teach students without having completed  
their own realization. The students, however, respect the teacher and offer  
him due service, and teacher and students reside together.  
O Lohitya, those students may say, “Our teacher has shaved his hair  
and beard, donned the three robes, renounced domestic life, and applied  
himself to the practice of austerity, and he should have eradicated defile-  
ments and realized the insight that transcends ordinary existence, but he  
has not been able to eradicate all defilements. Even though he has gained  
some degree of understanding regarding the insight that transcends ordinary  
existence, he has been teaching us without having eradicated all defile-  
ments. However, we still respect him and offer him due service as our  
teacher, and thus we reside together.”

The Buddha said:

O Lohitya, this is like neglecting the field where one should be sowing  
seeds and going off to weed another field. It is a corrupt way to proceed  
and one should take caution, because it bears on how the rules of the

Vinaya discipline and the precepts of the wise and saintly disciples are  
observed in both timing and deportment.  
O Lohitya, there is just one supreme World-honored One in this world,  
[and not two.] Before his appearance in the world there can be no upheaval.  
Why is the World-honored One exceptional and supreme? The Tathāgata  
appears in this world as one who is totally free from defilement and per-  
fectly enlightened, and so on. He has acquired the three kinds of super-  
normal knowledge that annihilates ignorance and allows the illumination  
of insight, eliminating all forms of darkness and delusion to realize the  
total eradication of defilements and reveal the great light of the Dharma.  
Why? Because this fundamental realization can only be achieved through  
constant endeavor without any slackening, and through freedom from all  
worldly mentality, practice in seclusion, diligent mindfulness, and mental  
concentration. O Lohitya, the truth is that there can be no upheaveal in  
this world without the appearance of the supreme World-honored One.  
O Lohitya, there are four results ( _phala_ ) in the life of a _śramaṇa_. What  
are the four? They are the saintly states of the stream-enterer ( _srota-  
āppana_ ), once-returner ( _sakṛdāgāmin_ ), nonreturner ( _anāgāmin_ ), and arhat.  
What do you think, O Lohitya? Suppose that one could realize the fruits  
of the four saintly states by listening to a discourse on the Dharma; and  
suppose also that someone interrupts the discourse, saying “Stop this talk  
about the Dharma,” and the teacher obeys and stops teaching. Would any-  
one listening to the discourse attain the intended result?  
Lohitya answered, “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha] asked again, “Without attaining the result, can one attain  
rebirth in heaven?”  
Lohitya answered, “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha] asked again:  
So the person who stops the teacher’s discourse on the Dharma cannot  
attain the result, and his [or her] rebirth in heaven becomes impossible.  
Would such a mind be considered good or evil?  
Lohitya answered “Sir, it is an evil mind.”  
The Buddha asked again, “When someone with a mind that is not good  
is reborn, is it into a good destiny or an evil one?”

Lohitya answered, “He will be born into an evil course of life, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued:]  
O Lohitya, it it as if someone were to say to King Prasenajit, “The king  
should alone enjoy all the wealth of the lands and states that he rules, and  
should not share any of it with others.” What do you think, O Lohitya?  
If the king agreed with this advice he would cut off all the grants he has  
made to others, wouldn’t he?  
Lohitya answered, “Yes, sir. He would do that.”  
[The Buddha asked again,] “Would a mind that would terminate all grants  
and gifts to others be regarded as a good mind or an evil one?”  
Lohitya answered, “It is a mind that is up to no good, sir.”  
[The Buddha] asked again, “With a mind that is not good, would one be  
born into a good destiny or an evil one?”  
Lohitya answered, “They will be born into an evil course of life, sir.”  
The Buddha said to Lohitya:  
It is just the same with someone who stops his teacher’s discourse on the  
Dharma, especially when those who are listening to the teaching are  
intended to realize the four results of the life of a _śramaṇa_. Now, if someone  
obstructs a teacher’s discourse by saying “Stop this talk about the Dharma,”  
and the teacher obeys and stops teaching, does anyone listening to the  
discourse attain the intended result?  
Lohitya answered, “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha] asked again, “Without attaining the result, can one attain  
rebirth in heaven?”  
Lohitya answered, “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha] asked again:  
So the person who stops the teacher’s discourse on the Dharma cannot  
attain the result and his rebirth in heaven becomes impossible. Would  
such a mind be considered good or evil?  
Lohitya answered, “Sir, it is an evil mind.”  
The Buddha asked again, “When someone with a mind that is not good  
is reborn, is it into a good destiny or an evil one?”

Lohitya answered, “He will be born into an evil course of life, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued:]  
O Lohitya, if someone says to you, “The property that belongs to the  
village of Sālavatikā is your fief [granted by the king]. You alone should  
enjoy it, as it is only for your own use and not for others. What good does  
it do to give anything to others?” What do you think, O Lohitya? If you  
were to follow this advice you would stop all gifts and payments to others,  
wouldn’t you?  
[Lohitya] replied, “Yes, I would.”  
[The Buddha] asked again, “When someone advises another person to  
terminate all gifts and payments to others, is that a good or evil mind?”  
[Lohitya] replied, “It is an evil mind, sir.”  
[The Buddha] asked again, “With a mind that is not good, would one be  
born into a good destiny or an evil one?”  
Lohitya answered, “They will be born into an evil course of life, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued:]  
It is just the same with anyone who stops the discourse of a Dharma  
teacher, especially when there are others listening to the discourse in order  
to attain the fruit of the four saintly states. If the teacher allows the dis-  
ruption [and stops the discourse], will the listeners reach the goal of the  
four saintly states?  
[Lohitya] replied, “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha] asked again, “If the listeners cannot attain the fruit of the  
saintly states, will they be reborn in heaven?”  
[Lohitya] replied, “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha] asked again, “When someone stops a Dharma discourse  
and prevents others from attaining the fruit of the saintly states, and thus  
from rebirth in heaven, is that a good or evil mind?”  
[Lohitya] replied, “An evil mind, sir.”  
[The Buddha] asked again, “With a mind that is not good, would one be  
born into a good destiny or an evil one?”  
Lohitya answered, “He will be born into an evil course of life, sir.”

At that moment, the _brāhmaṇa_ said to the Buddha:  
O World-honored One, I take my refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and  
Sangha. As I wish to become a lay devotee, may Your Reverence accept  
me as a lay devotee in the right Dharma. From this moment until the dis-  
solution of the body at the end of life, I will refrain from taking life, I will  
refrain from taking what is not given, I will refrain from indulging in  
sexual pleasure, I will refrain from speaking falsehoods, and I will refrain  
from ingesting intoxicants.  
The Buddha completed his discourse on the Dharma. The _brāhmaṇa_  
Lohitya, having heard the Buddha’s teaching, was delighted to receive it and  
reverentially carried out what the Buddha taught.
