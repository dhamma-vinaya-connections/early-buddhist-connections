### Sutra 1

### The Great Origin

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 14: Mahāpadāna Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was staying in the country of  
Śrāvastī in the Kareri-kuṭikā quarter of Jetavana Monastery, accompanied  
by one thousand two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s (disciples, monks).  
At that time, after the morning almsround was completed, some _bhikṣu_ s  
gathered at the hall adjacent to the Kareri-kuṭikā, and each engaged in dis-  
cussion with others, saying:

The World-honored One again addressed his disciples:  
O _bhikṣu_ s, do you wish [the Tathāgata] to impart my supernormal  
knowledge about the destinies of the past buddhas and their causes  
and conditions, or not? [If you do], I shall recount it for you.  
The disciples replied:  
World-honored One, this is the most opportune time, sir. We are your  
joyful audience. Indulge us, World-honored One! May your reverence  
transmit to us the wisdom of the past buddhas at once. We shall follow  
intently the instruction that is imparted, sir.  
The Buddha spoke to the _bhikṣu_ s: “Listen attentively, you should retain  
and consider well the following. I shall deliver analysis and explanation for  
your sake.” Thereupon the _bhikṣu_ s listened to the teaching.  
The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:  
Ninety-one eons ago there was a buddha in this world; the Tathāgata  
and Arhat, Vipaśyin by name, appeared in this world. Again, O _bhikṣu_ s,  
a buddha next came forth thirty-one eons ago; the Tathāgata and Arhat  
Śikhin by name appeared in this world. Again, O _bhikṣu_ s, during that  
same eon, there was yet another buddha; the Tathāgata and Arhat  
Viśvabhū by name appeared in this world. Again, O _bhikṣu_ s, in the  
present auspicious eon ( _bhadrakalpa_ ) there appeared in this world a  
series of buddhas, Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni, and Kāśyapa by name,  
and now again, during this same auspicious eon, I myself have realized  
highest, perfect enlightenment ( _anuttara samyaksaṃbodhi_ ).  
The Buddha then continued in verse:  
Ninety-one eons ago,  
There was Vipaśyin Buddha;  
Next, thirty-one eons ago,  
There appeared Śikhin Buddha;  
In that same eon,  
There appeared Viśvabhū Tathāgata.  
Now, during this present auspicious eon,

The Buddha then continued in verse:

The Buddha then continued in verse:

The ray of light equally illuminated the regions  
Where the sun and moon cannot reach.  
There was hardly anyone  
Who did not receive the great illumination.  
The one thus impregnated is immaculate and stainless.  
This is the regularity of the buddhas.  
O _bhikṣu_ s, you should [further] know the regularity of the buddhas.  
Being in his mother’s womb, the bodhisattva Vipaśyin was steadfast  
with his concentration, his mind undisturbed. The four heavenly  
guardians of the four heavenly quarters took up halberds and protected  
the Bodhisattva. Neither human nor nonhuman [beings] could approach  
and disturb him. This is the regularity of the buddhas.  
The Buddha then continued in verse:  
The four princes (guardians) of the four quarters of heaven  
Were renowned for their authority and virtue.  
Commanded by the god Indra,  
They protected the Bodhisattva well.  
They took up the arms of the halberd and  
Always guarded him, without leaving his side,  
Against the approach of any [evil] human or nonhuman [being].  
This is the regularity of the buddhas.  
The heavenly gods protected the Bodhisattva well  
As though nymphs guarding a heavenly palace.  
All the retainers of the gods were also thus delighted.  
This is the regularity of the buddhas.  
Again the Buddha spoke to the _bhikṣu_ s on the regularity of the lives of  
the buddhas:

The Bodhisattva descended from Tuṣita Heaven to enter his mother’s  
womb and abided there in concentration, his mind undisturbed. His  
mother upheld the five precepts ( _pañca-śīla_ ) and her practice of austerity  
was pure and genuine. With her sincere faith, compassion, and goodwill,  
well fulfilled, with nothing but happiness, she was born in Trāyastriṃśa  
Heaven at the time of her body’s dissolution at the end of her life. This  
is the regularity of the buddhas.  
At that time, the World-honored One continued in verse:  
While carrying within her body  
The highest, most honorable among humans,  
Upholding the precepts with vigor,  
She was destined to gain  
A heavenly body in her future life.  
Because of this she is called the mother of the buddhas.  
The Buddha [again] spoke to the _bhikṣu_ s on the regularity of the lives of  
the buddhas:

The Buddha [again] spoke to the _bhikṣu_ s on the regularity of the lives of  
buddhas:

The Buddha [again] spoke to the _bhikṣu_ s on the regularity of the buddhas:

At that time the World-honored One continued in verse:

Here the Buddha continued in verse:

Here the Buddha continued in verse:

a wandering mendicant ( _śramaṇa_ ) on the roadway. He wore a _bhikṣu_ ’s  
_saṃghāṭī_ robe and with his almsbowl in hand walked with his eyes  
cast down on the road.  
The prince at once asked the attendant: “What is this man?” He  
replied, “This is a _śramaṇa_ , sir.”  
The prince asked, “What is meant by _śramaṇa_ ?” The attendant  
replied:

The prince said:

At once he instructed the attendant, “Turn the chariot around and stop  
next to that man.” Thereupon he questioned the wandering mendicant,  
“Having shaven your hair and beard, donned a _saṃghāṭī_ robe, and car-  
rying an almsbowl in your hand, what do you seek?” The _śramaṇa_  
replied:

The prince responded, “Very good. This path of yours is most true and  
right.” Next he said to his attendant, “Take my garment and the chariot,  
and return to convey my words to the king”:

Distancing themselves from  
The bondage of indebtedness and love,  
They were freed from the cause of attachment.

Thereupon, accepting these new converts and allowing them to accom-  
pany him, the prince wandered from village to village, from country  
to country, promulgating his teaching wherever he happened to stop.  
Wherever he sojourned, people invariably offered four kinds of support  
(i.e., food and drink, robes or cloth, bedding, and medicine) out of  
respect and honor. The Bodhisattva thought to himself:

Later on, the prince accomplished his wish of solitary pursuit and con-  
centrated on his practice in a secluded place. But again he was pressed  
by a thought:

Again the prince thought to himself:

Then the Bodhisattva again thought to himself:

Having thought in such a manner,  
He realized that birth arises  
Depending on the will-to-becoming.  
Grasping this or grasping that,  
The will-to-becoming is reinforced and  
Becomes stronger from one [stage] to another.  
Because of this reinforcement,  
The Tathāgata explained that the will-to-becoming  
Arises depending on the act of grasping.  
Just as a pile of filthy garbage on the surface of water (i.e., the  
aggregates)  
Floats on the stream driven by a gust of wind (i.e., strong desire and  
attachment),  
So too does the act of grasping  
Reach far and wide  
Through the force of strong thirstlike craving.  
This thirstlike craving arises depending on feeling,  
The origin of all nets of suffering,  
Pain and pleasure are respectively expanded in accordance with  
The force of attachment.  
“Dependent on what and in what  
Is the origin of sensation?”  
Having thought in this way,  
He realized that sensation arises depending on sense contact.  
“Dependent on what and in what  
Is the origin of sense contact?”  
Having thought in this way,  
He realized that sense contact  
Arises depending on the six sense operations.  
“Dependent on what and in what  
Is the origin of the six sense operations?”  
Having thought in this way,  
He realized that the six sense operations  
Arise depending on the mental and physical process.

When sense contact ceases,  
Neither is there sensation.  
When feeling ceases,  
Neither is there thirstlike craving.  
When thirstlike craving ceases,  
Neither is there grasping.  
When grasping ceases,  
Neither is there the will-to-becoming.  
When the will-to-becoming ceases,  
Neither is there birth.  
When birth ceases,  
Neither is there the aggregate of suffering,  
Such as old age and death.  
The entire mass of suffering ceases to be forever.  
The causality of twelve-limbed dependent origination,  
As taught by the wise, is very profound,  
Difficult to see, and difficult to recognize.  
The Buddha alone thoroughly understands  
The way in which things  
Arise through depending on another, and  
In which things cease to be through the absence of another.  
If one thoroughly investigates this causal linkage,  
There arises no sixfold sense operation.  
Whoever sees the causality of dependent origination thoroughly  
Will not seek a teacher.  
He will be thoroughly liberated  
From desire and thirstlike craving in regard to the aggregates,  
The sphere of realities, and the sense faculties.  
He is worthy of receiving all kinds of offerings and  
Repaying the donor’s charity.  
If one acquires four kinds of rhetorical excellence (i.e., on rules,  
meanings, interpretations, and explanations)  
He will reach unshakable certainty,  
Will be able to be rid of all bondage, and  
While having extinguished it,

The Sage crossed over to the yonder shore and  
Liberated his mind by terminating all defilement.  
Ascending the mountaintop,  
He glanced in all directions.  
Hence he was called Vipaśyin.  
The light of great insight removes darkness  
Just as a light illumines itself through a reflective mirror.  
He removed sorrow and agony for all people  
By extinguishing the suffering of birth, old age, and death.

Vipaśyin Buddha, in his secluded place, again thought to himself:

Having thought in this manner, he once again returned to his silence  
and did not try to teach the Dharma to anyone.  
Then the god Brahmā, knowing what Vipaśyin Tathāgata had been  
thinking, immediately thought:

Then the lord of Brahmā Heaven requested the Buddha to change his  
mind, repeating three times the following words:

At that time, having listened to the god Brahmā’s courteous request  
three times, Vipaśyin Buddha observed the world, finding that some  
people were less defiled and others more, some were better endowed  
and others less, [and he then realized] that it would be easier to teach  
some of them while it would be more difficult to teach others. Those  
to whom it is easier to teach the Dharma should instill a fear of com-  
mitting transgressions that cannot be atoned for in the life to come,  
and hence encourage the extinguishing of evil deeds while promoting  
good deeds. For instance, among those lotuses that bloom in different  
colors, such as blue, pink, red, and white, some are growing out of  
dirty mud, not yet reaching the surface of the water; some are just  
emerging onto the surface of the water; and some have emerged onto  
the water’s surface but are not yet blooming—yet all are equally  
unspoiled by the water and ready to bloom. The people of the world  
are similar to these lotus plants.

At that time, the World-honored One spoke to the lord Brahmā:

Then the Buddha continued in verse:

Whoever excels in teaching and guidance  
Overcomes the animosity of the Evil One;  
Freed from all evils,  
His insight thus turns the wheel of Dharma.  
The power of insight annihilates defilements,  
And defeats the Evil One;  
Senses well controlled without slackening, terminating defilements,  
He liberates himself from the bondage of the Evil One,  
His insight turning the wheel of Dharma.  
If one studies the truth that is completely certain,  
He will know that all things ( _dharma_ s) are without reality ( _anātman_ );  
This is the highest among all truths.  
Thus his insight turns the wheel of Dharma.  
He does not turn the wheel for the sake of gain,  
Nor for the sake of fame,  
But out of compassion for all sentient beings;  
Thus his insight turns the wheel of Dharma.  
Having observed the yoke of suffering of all beings,  
Oppressed by old age, sickness, and death,  
It is for preventing the three evil courses of the life cycle  
That his insight turns the wheel of Dharma.  
Having terminated desire, hatred, and ignorance,  
Removing the root of thirstlike craving,  
Unshakeable and liberated,  
His insight thus turns the wheel of Dharma.  
Though I felt it difficult to overcome,  
Having won, I let the Evil One acknowledge his defeat;  
The difficult enemy has been defeated.  
Thus, his insight turns the wheel of Dharma.  
This wheel of Dharma, having nothing higher,  
The Buddha alone is able to turn it.  
Neither gods nor the Evil One, nor Indra, nor Brahmā,  
Can turn that wheel.  
Abiding closely with Dharma and turning it,  
Benefiting gods and humans;

The Buddha then continued in verse:

The Buddha then continued in verse:

The Buddha then continued in verse:

The Buddha then continued in verse:

He became a disciple of the Buddha, and  
With his mind pure and genuine, he came here.  
As a disciple of the Buddha,  
He venerated the Tathāgata and  
Informed the Most Honorable among Humans of his birthplace,  
Realization of the path,  
Name and family, and clan background in detail.  
He had insight into the profound Dharma and  
Realized the highest path.  
The residence of _bhikṣu_ s should be free from dust and dirt,  
Because they endeavor to terminate  
All defilements with exertion, without slackening.  
The foregoing are the stories of those seven buddhas  
From beginning to end  
As related by Śākyamuni Buddha.  
The Buddha completed this sutra of the “Stories of the Great Origin.” The  
_bhikṣu_ s listened to what the Buddha taught and, delighted, they followed the  
instructions that were imparted in it.
