### The Episode at Anupiya

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 24: Pāṭika Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the Mallan country  
at Anupiya, accompanied by one thousand two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s. At  
that time, the World-honored One, donning his _saṃghāṭī_ robe and with his  
almsbowl in hand, entered the town of Anupiya for almsround. The World-  
honored One then thought to himself:

It seems too early to go for almsround. Now, I may visit the pleasure  
grove of the _brāhmaṇa_ wanderer Bhārgava. O _bhikṣu_ s, let us wait there  
till the proper time comes and then go for almsround.  
The World-honored One then proceeded to that grove. At that time, having  
seen the Buddha approaching his place from a distance, the _brāhmaṇa_ Bhār-  
gava immediately stood up to welcome the Buddha and, after exchanging  
greetings, said to the Buddha:

Welcome, Gautama. You have not seen us here for some time. Now,  
what purpose has prompted you to come in this way, sir? Please take a  
seat here.  
The World-honored One then sat down as invited, while Bhārgava also  
took his seat on one side. The _brāhmaṇa_ then said to the World-honored One:

Last evening the bhikṣu Sunakṣatra, the son of a Licchavi clansman, vis-
ited me here and said to me, “Teacher, I am no longer practicing austerity
in the place of the Buddha. It is because he has rejected me.” Though I
listened to what he said, no sooner did I see Gautama walking by than
I greeted you with welcome. I certainly did not accept his words, sir.
The Buddha replied to Bhārgava:

I am sure and I know that you did not believe what Sunakṣatra said to
you. Sometime ago, when I was staying at the Sudharma Hall near the
Markaṭa Pond in Vaiśālī, this man Sunakṣatra came to see me and directly
asked me, “The Tathāgata has rejected me. I cannot practice austerity
with the Tathāgata.”
I then said to him, “Why do you say that you will not practice austerity
with me, and that I have rejected you?”
Sunakṣatra replied, “It is because the Tathāgata has not shown me
his supernormal power, sir.”
I then asked him, “Have I ever asked you, ‘If you practice austerity
within my religion, I will show you my supernormal power’? Have you
ever asked me, ‘If the Tathāgata will show me a miracle of supernormal
power [first], then I will practice austerity’?
Sunakṣatra then responded, “[I have asked] neither [of these questions
of you], sir, World-honored One.”
I said to Sunakṣatra, “In my dialogue with you I neither asked you
‘If you practice austerity in my religion, I will show you my supernormal
power’ nor did you say to me, ‘If Your Holiness shows a miracle of
supernormal power I will practice austerity.’ O Sunakṣatra, what do you
think? According to your thought, have I been able to show you my
supernormal power as Tathāgata? Or have I not? Has the doctrine of sal-
vation I laid out [for my disciples] been able to help them to end suffering
exhaustively as an essential method of deliverance?”
Sunakṣatra replied, “As the World-honored One says, I have neither
said that the Tathāgata has not been able to show his supernormal power,
nor have I said that the doctrine of salvation the Tathāgata laid out as
the essential method of deliverance has not been able to help his disciples
to realize their goal of ending suffering exhaustively, sir.”
[I then said to him,] “Therefore, O Sunakṣatra, if you practice austerity
by following the doctrine of my religion, you will be able to realize
supernormal power; I did not say that you could not realize it. As it is
the essential method of deliverance from suffering, I say that you will
be able to realize deliverance, and I did not say that you could not realize
it. What do you seek in this religious doctrine anyway?”

Sunakṣatra said, “World-honored One, you have not taught me as fre-  
quently as occasions permit. The World-honored One knows everything  
about the beginning of things^17 but is unwilling to teach me about it, sir.”  
I replied, “O Sunakṣatra, have I ever said to you ‘If you practice aus-  
terity according to the doctrine of my religion as I have laid it out, I will  
teach you the beginning of things’?^18 Have you ever said to me, ‘If the  
World-honored One teaches me the beginning of things, I will practice  
austerity under the guidance of [your] religion’?”  
Sunakṣatra replied, “[I have not asked either of these questions], sir.”  
I continued, “Therefore, O Sunakṣatra, I neither invited you initially  
with such a statement, nor did you reply to me with such a [condition]  
in your response. Why do you now say to me [what is contrary to the  
truth]? O Sunakṣatra, what do you think? According to your thought, has  
the Tathāgata been able to teach you the knowledge about the beginning  
of things? Or has he not? Has the doctrine of salvation I laid out as the  
essential method of deliverance been able to end suffering exhaustively?”  
Sunakṣatra replied, “I have neither said that the Tathāgata has not  
been able to teach me the beginning of things, nor have I said that the  
doctrine of salvation taught by the World-honored One as the essential  
method of deliverance could not help us end suffering exhaustively, sir.”  
I then said to Sunakṣatra, “As you said in your reply, if I can teach  
you the beginning of things, then the doctrine of salvation that I taught  
you as the essential method of deliverance can also end suffering exhaus-  
tively. What do you wish to seek in my religion?”  
I then said to Sunakṣatra, “Previously, in the land of Vṛji, in Vaiśālī,  
you praised the Tathāgata (Buddha), the Dharma, and the Sangha in  
innumerable ways, just as someone praises the eight qualities of the pure  
and cool ponds, namely (1) coolness, (2) lightness of gravity, (3)  
resilience, (4) clarity, (5) sweetness, (6) purity, (7) pleasing to drink, and  
(8) suitable for physical health, in order to give rise to a pleasant and  
delightful feeling in people’s hearts. You also praised the Tathāgata, the  
Dharma, and the Sangha in the land of Vṛji, in Vaiśālī, like this, and  
thereby caused many people to become happier with faith [in the Three  
Treasures]. Sunakṣatra, you should know that if you disavow the practice

of the path now, the people in the society may spread critical comments
about your character, saying, ‘Though the bhikṣu Sunakṣatra has many
good friends and is closely associated with the World-honored One as
his disciple, he cannot continue the practice of austerity till the end of
his life and therefore disavowed his adherence to the precepts and returned
to the ordinary world to live an ignoble life.’ O brāhmaṇa , you should
know that despite my advice, he did not follow my admonition, dis-
avowed the precepts, and returned to secular society.”
O brāhmaṇa , at another time, when I was staying at the Sudharma
Hall near the Markaṭa Pond in Vaiśālī, a Nirgrantha (Jain) practitioner,
Kanda rama suka by name, was staying in area. He was revered with
respect, renowned afar, had many friends, and received extensive material
support. The bhikṣu Sunakṣatra, in his saṃghāṭī robe and with his alms-
bowl in hand, entered the city of Vaiśālī for almsround, proceeded in
due order, and reached the abode of the Nirgrantha practitioner. At that
time, Sunakṣatra questioned the Nirgrantha teacher about some philo-
sophical matter of profound meaning. Since, however, [the Nirgrantha
practitioner] could not reply to the question, he eventually became angry.
Sunakṣatra thought to himself, “Because I have irritated this person,
will my action result in suffering and agony for a long period of time?”
O brāhmaṇa , you should know that, after his almsround, carrying
his saṃghāṭī robe and almsbowl, the bhikṣu Sunakṣatra then came to
my place and, after honoring me by bowing his forehead to my feet,
took his seat on one side. He did not, however, report the incident to
me. Therefore, I said to him, “O foolish man, how can you claim that
you are a disciple of the Śākya master (lit., “son of the Śākya”)?”
Sunakṣatra then replied to me, “World-honored One, why do you call
me a fool? And why can’t I claim that I am a disciple of the World-hon-
ored One, sir?”
I told him, “Foolish man, you once visited the Nirgrantha teacher
and asked him about a philosophical question of profound meaning.
Since, however, he could not answer the question, he eventually became
angry. At that moment, you thought to yourself, ‘Since I have now
insulted this person, will my action result in suffering and agony for a
long period of time?’ Did you not think this to yourself?”

Sunakṣatra replied, “He was supposed to be an arhat. For some reason
[that I do not know], he became angry, sir.”
I replied to Sunakṣatra, “Foolish man, your thought ‘For some reason
he became angry’ is itself absurd, because an arhat by definition is free
from agitation and anger. You should be able to discern by yourself if
[someone] is an arhat and adheres to the seven kinds of ascetic practice
for a long time: (1) not to wear garments until the end of one’s life, (2)
not to sustain oneself by ingesting intoxicating drinks or meat, nor to
eat rice and rice gruel, (3) not to commit sexual misconduct (i.e., to
remain celibate), (4) not to go beyond the four stone shrines located in
Vaiśālī, the Udena shrine in the east, (5) the Gautamaka shrine in the
south, (6) the Bahuputraka shrine in the west, and (7) the Saptāmra shrine
in the north. Yet he has now left all of these sites and no longer attends
to them. Having vowed to keep these rules, however, the Nirgrantha
ascetic committed all these four offenses later on and then died outside
the city of Vaiśālī. Like a wild jackal, suffering from an unsightly skin
disease, emaciated with illness, finally dies among the cemetery mounds,
that Nirgrantha ascetic who vowed to follow the ascetic norms and yet
broke all of them is just like such an animal. Originally he vowed to
himself that he would not wear clothing until the dissolution of his body
at death, yet later on he wore clothing. Originally he vowed that he would
not drink intoxicating liquors, eat meat, or partake of rice and rice gruel
until the dissolution of his body at death, yet he later broke all of these
ascetic rules. Originally he vowed to not commit sexual intercourse, yet
later he broke [this rule as well]. Originally he vowed to not abandon
the four shrines, the Udena shrine in the east, the Gotamaka shrine in
the south, the Bahuputra shrine in the west, and the Saptambaka in the
north, and yet he left all of these sites and no longer attends to them.
That practitioner has broken these seven vows by himself and is already
dead among the cemetery mounds outside the city of Vaiśālī.”
I said to Sunakṣatra, “Foolish man, you do not believe my words.
You should go there and just see what has happened with your own
eyes.”

The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa_ :

The bhikṣu Sunakṣatra, wearing the saṃghāṭī robe and with his almsbowl
in hand, then entered the city for almsround, and having completed it
he left the city and saw that the Nirgrantha ascetic had ended his life
among the cemetery mounds. After seeing this, he came to see me and,
having honored me by bowing his forehead to my feet, he sat down on
one side but he did not mention anything about it to me.
O brāhmaṇa , you should know that I then said to Sunakṣatra, “What
do you think, O Sunakṣatra? Wasn’t the fate of the Nirgrantha practitioner
exactly as I had predicted?” He replied, “Yes, sir. It was exactly as pre-
dicted by the words of the World-honored One.” O brāhmaṇa , you should
know that, despite having given Sunakṣatra an opportunity to witness
my supernormal power, he still said, “The World-honored One has not
shown me his supernormal power.”
Again, another time when I was staying in the Mallan country in the
town of Śuklabhūmi,^19 a market town of the people of Bumu, a Nirgrantha
ascetic, the kṣatriya Kaura by name, was also residing in that area. He
was revered with respect, renowned afar, had many friends, and received
extensive material support. [One morning], wearing the saṃghāṭī robe
and with almsbowl in hand, I entered the town for alms round, accom-
panied by Sunakṣatra, who was behind me. Sunakṣatra saw the Nirgrantha
ascetic Kaura lying face down on a pile of cow dung, licking up distiller’s
grain. O brāhmaṇa , you should know that, having seen the ascetic in
such a state, the bhikṣu Sunakṣatra thought to himself, “Though there
are many arhats in human society, I see that no one among those who
are on the course toward that highest goal surpasses this practitioner.
This is a Nirgrantha ascetic and his path of practice excels all other paths.
Why? Because the kṣatriya Kaura subjects himself to this kind of ascetic
practice, removing and discarding his self-pride by crouching over a
pile of cow dung and licking up distiller’s grains.”
At that moment, O brāhmaṇa , I turned to the right and, looking behind,
said to Sunakṣatra, “You are a fool. How can you claim to be a disciple
of the Śākya teacher?”
Sunakṣatra replied, “World-honored One, why does Your Holiness
call me a fool, sir? And why does Your Holiness ask me, ‘How can you
call yourself a disciple of the Śākya teacher?’”

I said to Sunakṣatra, “You are a fool because, having seen this Nir-  
grantha ascetic Kaura crouched over a pile of cow dung and licking up  
distiller’s grain, you thought to yourself, ‘Among those who have become  
arhats and those who are yet on the course toward that goal, this _kṣatriya_  
Kaura is the most honorable. Why? Because the _kṣatriya_ Kaura subjects  
himself to this kind of ascetic practice, removing and discarding his self-  
pride by crouching over a pile of cow dung and licking up distiller’s  
grains.’ Didn’t you think this thought?”  
He replied, “Yes, sir. I really thought so, sir.”  
Sunakṣatra then said, “World-honored One, why should jealousy arise  
from the state of arhat?”  
I said to the fool, “I do not experience jealousy regarding the state  
of arhat. Why do you ask how jealousy can arise in the state of arhatship?  
You are a fool for believing that the _kṣatriya_ Kaura is a real arhat. On  
the contrary, this man will die after seven days because of his swollen  
belly, and his corpse will arise among the hungry ghosts and experience  
the perpetual suffering of hunger. After his death his corpse will be tied  
up in [a pile of] _bīraṇa_ grass and dragged away to be left among the  
cemetery mounds. If you do not believe what I say, you should go speak  
to that man.”  
Sunakṣatra then went to the _kṣatriya_ Kaura and said to him, “The  
_śramaṇa_ Gautama has predicted that you will die after seven days from  
an illness, with a swollen belly; your corpse will arise among the hungry  
ghosts and will experience the perpetual suffering of hunger. After your  
death your corpse will be tied up in [a pile of] _bīraṇa_ grass and dragged  
away to be left among the cemetery mounds.” Sunakṣatra then said to  
the ascetic, “Why don’t you reduce your consumption of food so that  
his prediction will not come about?”  
O _brāhmaṇa_ , you should know that Kaura the _kṣatriya_ died after  
seven days because of his swollen belly, his corpse arose among the  
hungry ghosts, and after his death his corpse was tied up in [a pile of]  
_bīraṇa_ grass and dragged away to be left among the cemetery mounds.  
At that time, counting the number of days on his fingers, Sunakṣatra  
reached precisely the seventh day from the date [of the man’s death]  
predicted by Buddha. Sunakṣatra then visited the community of those

naked ascetics and, having arrived there, he questioned them, saying,
“Dear holy men, where is the kṣatriya Kaura now?” They replied, “He
is dead.” [Sunakṣatra] then asked them, “How did he die?” They replied,
“Because of a swollen belly.” He then asked, “How was his corpse treated
in the funeral rite?’ They replied, “It was tied up in a pile of bīraṇa grass
and dragged away to be left among the cemetery mounds.”
O brāhmaṇa , having heard this, Sunakṣatra immediately went to the
cemetery. Before he arrived there, the corpse had shifted its knees and
legs to crouch down again. Sunakṣatra then went to the corpse and asked
it, “Kaura the kṣatriya , are you dead?” The corpse replied, “I am already
dead.” He questioned again, “From what illness did you die?” The corpse
replied, “Gautama predicted that I would die in seven days because of
a swollen belly. Just as he predicted, after seven days my belly became
swollen and I died.” Sunakṣatra asked again, “Where have you been
reborn?” The corpse replied, “Gautama predicted that I would be born
among the hungry ghosts of the corpses. Today I have been reborn among
the corpses of the hungry ghosts.” Sunakṣatra questioned it again, “How
was your corpse treated at the funeral?” The corpse replied, “According
to Gautama’s prediction, the corpse would be tied up in a pile of bīraṇa
grass then dragged away and left among the cemetery mounds. Exactly
as predicted, my corpse was tied up in a pile of bīraṇa grass and dragged
away to be left among the cemetery mounds.” The corpse then said to
Sunakṣatra, “Though you became a bhikṣu by renouncing domestic life,
you will not be able to realize any good effect. Even though the śramaṇa
Gautama predicted all these things, you still don’t believe his words.”
Having thus spoken, the corpse fell flat, laying itself down.
O brāhmaṇa , the bhikṣu Sunakṣatra then came to see me and, having
honored me by bowing his forehead to my feet, he took his seat on one
side, but he did not tell me what he had experienced that day. I said to
him, “My prediction about the kṣatriya Kaura was correct, wasn’t it?’
He replied, “Yes, indeed, it was exactly as predicted by the World-
honored One, sir.” O brāhmaṇa , I had already shown him my supernor-
mal power like this several times, yet Sunakṣatra still insists that I have
not shown him my supernormal power.
Again the Buddha said to the brāhmaṇa :

On another occasion, when I was staying at the Sudharma Hall near the  
Markaṭa Pond, a _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic, Pāṭikāputra (“Son of Pāṭikā”) by  
name, resided in the area. He was respected, renowned afar, had many  
friends, and received extensive material support. He announced to the  
crowds of citizens in Vaiśālī: “Just as the _śramaṇa_ Gautama praises his  
knowledge, I too can also assert that I have great knowledge. Just as the  
_śramaṇa_ Gautama claims that he has supernormal power, I too can say  
that I have such power. Again, just as the _śramaṇa_ Gautama has truly  
realized the path of transcendence, I too can claim that I have realized  
such a path. I can demonstrate miracles through [similar] supernormal  
powers as those shown by him. If the _śramaṇa_ shows a single miracle,  
I shall demonstrate two. If he shows two, I shall demonstrate four. If he  
shows eight, I shall demonstrate sixteen. If he shows sixteen, I shall  
demonstrate thirty-two. If he shows thirty-two, I shall demonstrate sixty-  
four. Whatever number of miracles the _śramaṇa_ Gautama shows, I shall  
double that number without exception for my demonstration.”  
O _brāhmaṇa_ , the _bhikṣu_ Sunakṣatra, wearing the _saṃghāṭī_ robe and  
with his almsbowl in hand, then entered the city and saw the _brāhmaṇa_  
ascetic speaking to the crowd of citizens in Vaiśālī, declaring, “Just as  
the _śramaṇa_ Gautama praises his knowledge I too can also assert that I  
have great knowledge. Just as the _śramaṇa_ Gautama claims that he has  
supernormal power, I too can say that I have such power. Again, just as  
the _śramaṇa_ Gautama has truly realized the path of transcendence, I too  
can claim that I have realized such a path. I can demonstrate miracles  
through [similar] supernormal powers as those shown by him. If the _śra-  
maṇa_ shows a single miracle, I shall demonstrate two. If he shows four,  
I shall demonstrate eight. And so on—whatever number of miracles the  
_śramaṇa_ Gautama shows, I shall double that number without exception  
for my demonstration.”  
Having completed his almsround, the _bhikṣu_ Sunakṣatra then came  
to see me and, after honoring me by bowing his forehead to my feet, he  
took his seat on one side and said to me, “This morning, wearing the  
_saṃghāṭī_ robe and with my almsbowl in hand, I entered the city and hap-  
pened to hear what the _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic Pāṭikāputra was saying to the  
crowd of the citizens: “Just as the _śramaṇa_ Gautama praises his knowledge

I too can also assert that I have great knowledge. Just as the śramaṇa
Gautama claims that he has supernormal power, I too can say that I have
such power. Again, just as the śramaṇa Gautama has truly realized the
path of transcendence, I too can claim that I have realized such a path. I
can demonstrate miracles through [similar] supernormal powers as those
shown by him. If the śramaṇa shows a single miracle, I shall demonstrate
two, and so on. Whatever number of miracles the śramaṇa Gautama
shows, I shall double that number without exception for my demonstra-
tion.” Sunakṣatra thus reported to me the ascetic’s claim in detail.
I then responded to Sunakṣatra, “Pāṭikāputra cannot come to meet
me here without renouncing his words, his view, and his self-conceit
before the crowd of the citizens. Should he, thinking in the same way
and without renouncing his words, his view, or his self-conceit, come
to the śramaṇa Gautama, his mind will be split asunder into seven pieces.
It is impossible for him to come here without renouncing his words, his
view, and his self-conceit.” Sunakṣatra then said to me, “World-honored
One, please be cautious. O Tathāgata, take heed in uttering these words.”
The Buddha said to Sunakṣatra:
Why do you say, “World-honored One, please be cautious. O Tathāgata,
take heed in uttering these words?”
Sunakṣatra replied, “That ascetic Pāṭikāputra has great authority and
power. He might appear here through the power of transfiguration and
disprove the words of the World-honored One.”
I said to Sunakṣatra, “Has there been any occasion on which the words
of the Tathāgata were contrary to whatever is spoken?”
Sunakṣatra replied, “No, sir.”
Again I said to Sunakṣatra, “Having admitted this, why then do you
say, ‘World-honored One, be cautious. O Tathāgata, take heed in uttering
these words’?”
Sunakṣatra replied, “World-honored One, you should go see the
ascetic Pāṭikāputra yourself and listen to the words of the gods who
come to talk to you, sir.”
I [promptly] replied, “I also know it by myself as well as from the
words of the gods. [For instance], the general Ajita of Vaiśālī, after the

dissolution of his body at the end of his life, was born in Trāyastriṃśa
Heaven. He came to see me, saying, ‘The brāhmaṇa Pāṭikāputra does
not know shame despite the fact that he breaks the precepts, tells lies,
and makes false accusations among the crowd of people in Vaiśālī, such
as “The general Ajita was born among the dead hungry ghosts after the
dissolution of his body at the end of his life.” On the contrary, I was
reborn in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven after my death, sir.’
Thus, I know Pāṭikāputra by myself and also from the god who came
to tell me about his fraudulence. I then said to the foolish man Sunakṣatra,
“If you do not believe my words, I may have to ask you go to Vaiśālī
and make an announcement that after tomorrow’s meal I shall come to
meet Pāṭikāputra.”

The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa_ :

Sunakṣatra, after passing the night, wearing the saṃghāṭī robe and with
his almsbowl in hand, entered the city for almsround. He then spoke in
detail to the crowd of brāhmaṇa s, śramaṇa s, and brāhmaṇa ascetics in
the city of Vaiśālī, “The brāhmaṇa ascetic Pāṭikāputra said to the crowd
of people, ‘Just as the śramaṇa Gautama praises his knowledge, I too
can also assert that I have great knowledge. Just as the śramaṇa Gautama
has a great power of influence, so do I also possess a great power of influ-
ence. Just as the śramaṇa Gautama claims that he has supernormal power,
I too can say that I have such power. Again, just as the śramaṇa Gautama
has truly realized the path of transcendence, I too can claim that I have
realized such a path. I can demonstrate miracles through [similar] super-
normal powers as those shown by him. If the śramaṇa shows a single
miracle, I shall demonstrate two. If he shows two, I shall demonstrate
four, and so on—whatever number of miracles the śramaṇa Gautama
shows, I shall double that number without exception for my demonstra-
tion.’ Now the śramaṇa Gautama wishes to come to meet Pāṭikāputra.
All of you in this crowd should visit the place of Pāṭikāputra.”
At that time, the brāhmaṇa Pāṭikāputra was walking on a road. Having
found him, Sunakṣatra hurried to reach him and said to him, “You have
spoken to the crowd of Vaiśālī citizens with the following words, ‘Just
as the śramaṇa Gautama has a great wisdom, I too have a great wisdom’

and so on. And ‘Whatever number of miracles the śramaṇa shows
through his supernormal power, I will demonstrate double that amount.’
Having heard your claim, Gautama is now coming to your residence.
You should go home and meet him there.”
[Pāṭikāputra] replied, repeating his words, “Certainly, I am returning.
Certainly, I am returning.” Though he said this, he was thoroughly fright-
ened, with his hair all standing on end. He returned to his tinduka tree
forest and, sitting on a charpoy, he was worried and confused.
The Buddha continued, speaking to the brāhmaṇa:
After the day’s meal, I visited Pāṭikāputra’s home accompanied by many
śramaṇa s, brāhmaṇa s, ascetics, and lay devotees of the Licchavi clans-
people, and took a seat. There was a brāhmaṇa ascetic, Śara by name,
among those present, to whom they instructed, “Go into the forest and
tell Pāṭikāputra, ‘Now, many Licchavi śramaṇa s, brāhmaṇa s, ascetics,
and lay devotees have assembled at your residence. They have agreed
in admitting that you, Son of Pāṭikā, have made these claims to the
crowds of citizens, “Just as the śramaṇa Gautama has great insight, I
too have great knowledge,” and so on. And “Whatever number of mir-
acles the śramaṇa shows through his supernormal power, I will demon-
strate double that amount.” Now, therefore, the śramaṇa Gautama has
come to your forest. You should go meet him.’”
Thereupon, having been thus instructed by the people’s request, Śara
went into the tinduka tree forest and said to the ascetic Pāṭikāputra, “All
the Licchavi śramaṇa s, brāhmaṇa s, ascetics, and lay devotees have
assembled in the forest at your abode. They agreed in consensus that
you, Son of Pāṭikā, have made claims to the crowds of citizens, ‘Just as
the śramaṇa Gautama has great insight, I too have great knowledge,’
and so on, up to saying, ‘Whatever number of miracles the śramaṇa
shows through his supernormal power, I will demonstrate double that
amount.’ Now the śramaṇa Gautama has come to your forest. You should
go there and meet him.”
At that moment, Pāṭikāputra replied to Śara, “I am coming, I am com-
ing.” Having replied, he restlessly turned his body right and left on the
charpoy. His foot then became hooked and entangled in the ropes of the

charpoy, so that he could not get his foot free fromit, let alone walk to
meet the World-honored One.
Śara then said to Pāṭikāputra, “Having no knowledge, you say only
empty words: ‘I am coming. I am coming.’ But you are unable to extricate
yourself from the charpoy. How can you walk to the place where the
assembly is waiting?” Having thus reprimanded Pāṭikāputra, the brāh-
maṇa ascetic Śara returned alone to the assembly, reporting, “I have
gone to speak to Pāṭikāputra, delivering your message. He only replied,
‘I am coming, I am coming,’ but he restlessly tossed around on the char-
poy and his foot became entangled in the rope, and he cannot extricate
himself from it. Since he cannot extricate himself from the charpoy, how
can he walk to this place and meet us?”
At that moment there was a certain Licchavi minister sitting among
the assembly. He stood up and, having rearranged his robes to expose
his right shoulder, he knelt with both palms joined together and said to
the assembly, “Honored members of this assembly, please wait awhile.
I shall now go and get that person to return with me.”

The Buddha continued speaking to the _brāhmaṇa:_

At that time, I said to that particular Licchavi minister, “That ascetic,
Pāṭikāputra, speaks such words, upholds such a view, and insists on such
self-conceit. There is no sense in forcing him to meet me. Even if you
try to bind him with leather ropes to a group of oxen and drag him away
to the extent of crushing his body, he would not come here by renouncing
his words, his view, and his self-conceit. If you cannot believe my words,
you may go see that person yourself.”
The Licchavi minister then went to Pāṭikāputra and said to him, “All
the Licchavi śramaṇa s, brāhmaṇa s, ascetics, and lay devotees have
assembled in the forest at your abode. They agreed in consensus that
[you] have made claims before the crowds of citizens, saying, ‘Just as
the śramaṇa Gautama has great knowledge, I too have great knowledge,’
and so forth. And ‘Whatever number of miracles the śramaṇa shows
through his supernormal power, I will demonstrate double that amount.’
Now the śramaṇa Gautama has come to your forest. You should return
there.”

At that moment, Pāṭikāputra replied to the Licchavi minister, “I am
coming. I am coming.” Having replied thus, he restlessly turned his
body right and left on the charpoy and his foot became hooked and entan-
gled in the rope, so that he could not extricate his foot from the charpoy,
let alone walk to meet the World-honored One.
The Licchavi minister then said to Pāṭikāputra, “Having no knowledge,
you only say empty words, ‘I am coming.’ You are unable to extricate
yourself from this charpoy. How can you go to the place where the
assembly of people are waiting?”
The minister then said to the ascetic, “Many wise people acquire new
insights through analogy. Once in the immemorial past, a lion, king of
all animals, lived in a deep forest. When the lion went out in the morning,
it looked around all the four directions, promptly roared vigorously three
times, and then toured through the fields to choose a kind of flesh for
his food. O Pāṭikāputra, as soon as that lion, having finished his meal,
returned to its forest, a wild jackal, which had followed after the lion,
ate the leftover carrion and thus, filled with vigor, it claimed “What beast
is this lion, no greater than I? I can now keep an entire forest under my
control; I come out of the cave in early morning, look around in all the
directions, promptly roar three times, then tour through the jungle to
choose my favorite flesh and feed on it.”
The next morning the jackal came out of its cave and promptly roared
three times before stepping out for touring. While it wished to roar like
a lion, it turned out to be only the howling of a jackal. Your case is just
like that of the jackal. Despite the fact that you are indebted to the
Buddha’s gracious influence, on account of which you sustain your life
in the world and receive people’s material support, you are now trying
to compete with the Tathāgata.”
Thereupon, the minister reprimanded Pāṭikāputra by composing the
following verses:
A wild jackal claims to be a lion and
Praises himself as the king of animals.
Despite wishing to make a lion’s roar,
The animal makes only the howling of a jackal.

Abiding alone in an empty forest,
It claims to be the king of animals.
Despite wishing to make a lion’s roar,
The animal makes only the howling of a jackal.
Squatting on the ground,
The animal seeks the burrows of field mice,
Cutting through the mounds, it searches for the carcass.
Despite wishing to make a lion’s roar,
The animal makes only the howling of a jackal.
The Licchavi minister said to Pāṭikāputra, “You too, are like that jackal,
indebted to the Buddha’s gracious influence, you have subsisted in the
world and enjoyed receiving material support. Yet you try to compete
with the Tathāgata.”
The minister then reprimanded Pāṭikāputra further by means of four
other analogies, and then returned to the assembly, reporting, “Delivering
the message of this assembly, I urged Pāṭikāputra to come to this assem-
bly. Even though he replied, ‘I am coming, I am coming,’ he restlessly
turned his body right and left on the charpoy and his foot then became
hooked and entangled within the rope so that he could not extricate his
foot from that couch, let alone walk to meet the World-honored One.”

At that moment, the World-honored One said to the Licchavi minister:

As I told you before, it is senseless even if you wish to urge this man to
come along with you to this place to meet us. Even if you try to bind
him with leather ropes to a group of oxen and drag him away to the
extent of crushing his body, he would not agree to come here by renounc-
ing his words, his view, and his self-conceit. O brāhmaṇa , I then gave
the assembly my exhortation on the Dharma, encouraging them, bene-
fitting them, and delighting them. Upon making the lion’s roar three
times, my body ascended into midair and returned to my original abode.

The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa:_

A śramaṇa or a brāhmaṇa asserts that the gods Brahmā and Īśvara created
this world entirely. I asked him a question, “Was the world as a whole

created by Brahmā and Īśvara?” He could not answer and counter -
questioned me, “O Gautama, what do you think about that?” I replied,
“It may be answered that when this world was initially destroyed, those
sentient beings who had survived in Ābhāsvara Heaven reached the end
of their life spans and the end of their dispositional forces, and were
subsequently born in the Brahmā heaven of [vast] emptiness. They, how-
ever, gave rise to craving and attachment in themselves and wished for
other sentient beings to be born there. The other sentient beings, upon
reaching the end of their life spans and of the end of their dispositional
forces, were again born in that heaven. Those sentient beings then thought
to themselves, ‘I am now the god Brahmā, having arisen suddenly without
cause. For there is no creator of my being, while I can reach each and
every destiny of all meanings without exception, and acquire total free-
dom in all thousands of worlds. I am able to act as cause [for all things]
and transfigure myself into any and all forms. I am the primordial and
most subtle being, becoming father and mother of humankind. I was
initially alone without a companion when I first came here, but because
of my power all the sentient beings have been multiplied. I am the creator
of these sentient beings.’
“The other sentient beings then followed suit, asserting, ‘He was the
god Brahmā, having arisen suddenly without cause. For there was no
creator of his being, while he could reach every destiny as to all meanings
without exception, endowed with total freedom in all thousands of worlds.
He could act as cause [of all things] and transfigure himself into any and
all forms. He is the primordial and most subtle being, becoming father
and mother of humankind. Because of his initial being, all of us come
to being. This great god Brahmā created all of us.’
“These sentient beings then reached the end of their lives and were
born into this world according to the creator’s will, gradually grew up,
then shaved their hair and beards, donned the three robes, renounced
domestic life, and accomplished the path of religion. They enter the
mental concentration and recollect the origin of their being through the
mind of concentration, and utter the following words: ‘This great Brahmā
arose suddenly without cause. Created by no one, he can reach, without
exception, each and every destiny of different meanings and acquire

total freedom in all thousands of worlds. He can act as cause for anything  
and transfigure himself into any and all forms. He is the primordial and  
most subtle being, father and mother of humankind. That great Brahmā  
is permanent, does not change; but we, created by that deity, are subject  
to the law of impermanence and cannot abide forever. We are those that  
are in incessant change.’”  
O _brāhmaṇa_ , my answer was like that. On the basis of my assistance,  
each of those _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s said, “Brahmā and Iśvara created  
this world.” O _brāhmaṇa_ , in fact the origin of this world is beyond the  
power of the god Brahmā; only the Buddha knows it absolutely. The  
Buddha alone can go beyond the creation of the world and know what  
is beyond. Though he knows this he is not attached to it, but knows cre-  
ation as it really is in terms of suffering, causal concatenation, cessation,  
and the essential path of transcending both satisfaction and dissatisfaction.  
Having seen this world and its creation through the insight of the universal  
equality [of the psychophysical elements], he thereby realizes liberation  
with no residual influence of defilement. Such is called the Tathāgata.

The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa_ :

A _śramaṇa_ or a _brāhmaṇa_ says, “Pleasure and being corrupted by pleasure  
is the beginning of the human being.” I said to him, “Why do you say that  
pleasure and corruption by pleasure is the beginning of the human being?”  
He, however, could not answer and counterquestioned me, “What do you  
think about that?” I replied, “It may be answered that when those sentient  
beings in Ābhāsvara Heaven were delighted with pleasure and corrupted  
by pleasure, and at the end of their life spans they came to be born in this  
world, gradually grew up, shaved their hair and beards, donned the three  
robes, renounced family life, and accomplished the path of religion. They  
entered the mental concentration and recollected their origins through the  
power of mental concentration, saying, “While those sentient beings do  
not like pleasure and are not corrupted by pleasure, abiding always in that  
original place unchanged, we humans are fond of pleasure and play and  
thus subject to the law of impermanence and change.”  
O _brāhmaṇa_ , my answer would be like that. For this reason, the _śra-  
maṇa_ or the _brāhmaṇa_ regards pleasure and play as the beginning of

the human being. In this manner, only the Buddha knows the beginning
absolutely, and also by going beyond the beginning of humankind, he
knows what is beyond. Though he knows this, he is not attached to it
but sees it as it really is, in terms of suffering, causal concatenation, ces-
sation, and the essential method of transcending both satisfaction and
dissatisfaction. Having seen the beginning of humankind through the
insight of the universal equality [of the psychophysical elements], he
thereby realizes liberation without any residual influence of defilement.
Such is called the Tathāgata.
The Buddha [again] said to the brāhmaṇa:
A śramaṇa or a brāhmaṇa may say, “Someone who is mentally
debauched (i.e., having a corrupted mind) by pleasure is the beginning
of the human being.” I questioned him, “Do you really regard a mind
corrupted by pleasure to be the beginning of the human being?” He could
not answer, and counterquestioned, “O Gautama, what do you think
about it, sir?” I then said to him, “Some sentient beings, while watching
each other intimately, become corrupted. When they died they came to
be born in this world, gradually grew up, shaved their hair and beards,
donned the three robes, renounced domestic life, and accomplished the
path of religion. Entering mental concentration, they know their origins
through the power of mental concentration and say, “Those sentient
beings did not see each other and hence their minds were not corrupted,
so they were permanent and unchanged. We used to see each other and
so our minds were corrupted, and thus we became impermanent and
subject to change.”
O brāhmaṇa , it is like that. For this reason, the śramaṇa or the brāh-
maṇa regard mental corruption as the beginning of the human being. In
this way, the Buddha alone knows it absolutely and also goes beyond
the beginning of the human being and knows what is beyond. Though
he knows this he is not attached to it but sees it as it really is, in terms
of suffering, causal concatenation, cessation, and the essential method
of transcending both satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Having seen the
beginning of the human being through the insight of the universal equality

[of the psychophysical elements], he thereby realizes liberation without
any residual influence of defilement. Such is called the Tathāgata.

The Buddha [again] said to the _brāhmaṇa_ :

A śramaṇa or a brāhmaṇa says, “I came to be born without a cause.” I
said to him, “You really assert that you were born without any cause?”
He could not answer, and counterquestioned me. I answered, “Some sen-
tient beings who have neither thought nor knowledge, when they give
rise to thought they subsequently die and come to be born in this world,
gradually grow up, shave their hair [and beards], renounce domestic life,
don the three robes, and at once enter mental concentration, cognizing
their origins through the power of the mental concentration. They say, “I
was nonexistent but now, suddenly, [I] exist. This world is essentially
nonexistent but is now existent. This is real and the rest is false.”
O brāhmaṇa , it is like this. For this reason, the śramaṇa or brāhmaṇa
regards our existence as causeless. The Buddha alone knows it absolutely
and also goes beyond the beginning of the human being and knows what
is beyond. Though he knows this, he is not attached to it but sees it as
it really is, in terms of suffering, causal concatenation, cessation, and
the essential method of transcending both satisfaction and dissatisfaction.
Having seen the beginning of humankind through the insight of the uni-
versal equality [of the psychophysical elements], he thereby realizes lib-
eration without any residual influence of defilement. Such is called the
Tathāgata.

The Buddha [again] said to the _brāhmaṇa:_

My theory is like the following, which some śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s
secretly criticized, saying, “Those self-claimed disciples of the śramaṇa
Gautama enter liberation on the basis of purity and genuineness and thus
accomplish the act of purification [of the defilements]. They know purity
and genuineness, but they do not know the universal purity of human
spirituality.” I do not support this theory that my disciples enter liberation
on the basis of purity, accomplishing the act of purification through gen-
uine practice, and they know purity and genuineness but do not know

the universal purity of human spirituality. O _brāhmaṇa_ , I myself assert  
that my disciples enter liberation on the basis of purity and genuineness,  
accomplishing purification [of the defilements], and thus know the state  
of universal purity [as to human spirituality].  
At that time, the _brāhmaṇa_ said to the Buddha:  
They spoke slanderous words against the _śramaṇa_ Gautama to no good  
benefit, saying, “The _śramaṇa_ (i.e., the Buddha) himself admitted, ‘My  
disciples enter liberation on the basis of purity and genuineness and thus  
accomplish the act of purification [of the defilements]. They know purity  
and genuineness but they do not know the universal purity of human  
spirituality.’” Contrary to this slanderous statement, the World-honored  
One has not made such a statement. The World-honored One has himself  
asserted that his disciples enter liberation on the basis of purity and gen-  
uineness, accomplishing purification [of the defilements], and thus know  
the state of universal purity [as to human spirituality].  
The _brāhmaṇa_ again said to the World-honored One:  
I wish also to enter liberation on the basis of purity and genuineness so  
that I can accomplish the act of purification of all defilements and know  
the state of universal purity, sir.  
The Buddha replied:  
If you wish to realize that goal it will be exceedingly difficult, because  
you hold a different (i.e., wrong) view, a different principle of persever-  
ance, and a different set of practices. Based on any other view than the  
right one, it is extremely difficult to enter the liberation of purity and  
genuineness. Only if you continue to uphold goodwill and friendly asso-  
ciation with the Buddha without hiatus will you be able to secure the  
comfortable state of happiness for a long time to come.  
At that time, having listened to the Buddha’s exhortation, the _brāhmaṇa_  
Bhārgava was delighted and respectfully received the teaching and carried  
out what was taught by the Buddha.
