### The Gradual Increase

### of Doctrines by One

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha sojourned at the monastery built  
by Anāthapiṇḍika in the Jetavana Forest accompanied by one thousand two  
hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s. At that time, the World-honored One spoke to the  
_bhikṣu_ s:

I shall exhort on the subject of the subtle (supreme) Dharma. Whatever  
I explain to you, whether it is at the beginning, the middle, or the end,  
is true and genuine. It is endowed with meaning and essence and is well  
balanced with the practice of pure and genuine austerity. This is called  
the “teaching comprising ten fivefold groups of doctrines.” You should  
listen to me attentively and think about and remember what I explain to  
you. The following is the teaching.  
The _bhikṣu_ s were then attentive and ready to listen. The Buddha said to  
the _bhikṣu_ s:

This teaching of ten fivefold groups of doctrines comprises the following:
the group of doctrinal items that are very useful for religious salvation,
the group of doctrinal items that should be practiced, the group of doc-
trinal items that should be comprehensively understood, the group of
doctrinal items that should be relinquished, and the group of doctrinal
items that should be directly experienced by oneself.
What is the singular useful item? It is the discipline of not forsaking
whatever is good. What is the singular item to be practiced? It is the dis-
cipline of mindfulness in contemplation of one’s body. What is the sin-
gular item to be exactly known? It is the fact of contact of the [sense]
faculties with their respective objects under the influence of defilement.
What is the singular item to be relinquished? It is the sense of self-
conceit. What is a singular item to be directly experienced? It is the

deliverance of the mind that is unshakable or undisturbed toward the
realm beyond the influence of defilement.
Again, there is the double doctrinal item that is very useful for religious
salvation, the double item that should be practiced, the double item that
should be comprehensively understood, the double item that should be
relinquished, and the double item that should be directly experienced
by oneself. (1) What is the double item that is very useful for religious
salvation? It consists of knowing shame upon self-reflection and knowing
shame before others. (2) What is the double item to be practiced? It con-
sists of the practice of calming the mind ( śamatha ) and that of analytical
introspection ( vipaśyana ). (3) What is the double item to be understood
comprehensively? It consists of the (noetic) category of name, i.e. the
four mental skandha s, and the (corporeal) category of form, i.e., the one
material skandha. (4) What is the double item to be relinquished? It con-
sists of ignorance of the Four Noble Truths and craving and desire for
existence. (5) What is the double item to be directly experienced by one-
self? It is the acquisition of insight on the Four Noble Truths and the
realization of deliverance.
Again, there is the triple doctrinal item that is very useful for religious
salvation, the triple doctrinal item that should be practiced, the triple
doctrinal item that should be comprehensively understood, the triple
doctrinal item that should be relinquished, and the triple doctrinal item
that should be directly experienced by oneself. (1) What is the triple
item that is very useful for religious salvation? It means first, associating
with good friends; second, attending discourses on the Dharma, and
third, realizing the truth of the Dharma. (2) What is the triple item to be
practiced? It means the practice of the threefold concentration: first, the
concentration on the emptiness of the self and things attributed to it;
second, the concentration on signlessness or the nondifferentiation of
things; and third, the concentration on the objectless or goal-free state
of existence. (3) What is the triple item to be comprehensively under-
stood? It means three kinds of sensation or feeling: first, the feeling of
pain; second, the feeling of pleasure; and third, feeling neither pain or
pleasure. (4) What is the triple item to be relinquished? It means three
kinds of attachment: first, craving for desire; second, craving for existence;

and third, craving for nonexistence. (5) What is the triple item to be  
directly experienced by oneself? It means the three kinds of supernormal  
knowledge: first, the knowledge of recollection of past lives; second,  
the knowledge derived from the supernormal power of vision; and third,  
the knowledge of the total eradication of the influence of defilements.  
Again, there is the fourfold doctrinal item that is very useful for reli-  
gious salvation, the fourfold doctrinal item that should be practiced, the  
fourfold doctrinal item that should be comprehensively understood, the  
fourfold doctrinal item that should be relinquished, and the fourfold doc-  
trinal item that should be directly experienced by oneself. (1) What is  
the fourfold item that is very useful for religious salvation? It means the  
four kinds of blessings: first, residing in the proper region;^15 second,  
associating with and receiving support from good friends; third, perfect  
effort that is self-motivated; and fourth, having planted good roots in  
one’s past lives. (2) What is the fourfold item to be practiced? It means  
the practice of four kinds of application of mental awareness. First, while  
observing his inner body or inner senses in concentration, a _bhikṣu_ should  
exert himself with no slackening, being mindful of his observations and  
keeping them in memory, and thereby remove worldly desires and wor-  
ries. Second, while observing his outer body or outer senses, a _bhikṣu_  
should exert himself with no slackening, being mindful of his observations  
to keeping them in memory, and thereby remove worldly desires and  
worries. Third, while observing both the inner and outer body, a _bhikṣu_  
should exert himself with no slackening, being mindful of his observations  
and keeping them in memory, and thereby remove worldly desires and  
worries. It is the same with the second application: observing one’s sense  
perceptions; the third application, observing one’s mind or intellect; and  
the fourth application, observing one’s psychophysical elements ( _skan -  
dha_ s). (3) What is the fourfold item to be comprehensively understood?  
It means the four kinds of food: first, edible, material food that is either  
nutritious or exquisite; second, nutrition ingested by contact through  
touch; third, volitional and mental nutrition; and fourth, consciousness  
nutrition. (4) What is the fourfold item to be relinquished? It means four  
kinds of grasping or attachment: first, attachment to desires; second,  
attachment to the self; third, attachment to the vow of precepts belonging

to other schools; and fourth, attachment to views. (5) What is the fourfold
item to be directly experienced by oneself? It means the four results of
the mendicant life: first, attaining the result of the saintly state of stream-
winner ( srotaāpanna ); second, attaining the result of the saintly state of
once-returner ( sakṛdāgāmin ); third, attaining the result of the saintly
state of nonreturner ( anāgāmin ); and fourth, attaining the result of the
saintly state of arhatship.
Again there is the fivefold doctrinal item that is very useful for reli-
gious salvation, the fivefold doctrinal item that should be practiced, the
fivefold doctrinal item that should be comprehensively understood, the
fivefold doctrinal item that should be relinquished, and the fivefold doc-
trinal item to be directly experienced by oneself. (1) What is the fivefold
item that is very useful for religious salvation? It means the five kinds
of effort toward ultimate cessation: first, striving to believe that the
Buddha Tathāgata is perfectly endowed with the ten supreme titles,
such as One Liberated from Attachment and Fully Enlightened One;
second, striving to be free from illness and thus always maintaining
physical well-being and peace; third, striving to be honest and direct
without the vice of flattery, for whom the Tathāgata has taught the path
to nirvana; fourth, striving to control the mind, upholding it intact and
not disrupted and keeping in memory whatever scripture was once
recited, even long ago; and fifth, striving to be capable of skillfully
investigating the rising and falling of the psychophysical elements and
thus terminate the root of suffering through the same practice that is
accomplished by wise and saintly disciples. (2) What is the fivefold
item to be practiced? It means the practice of five spiritual faculties:
the faculty of faith, the faculty of endeavor, the faculty of mindfulness,
the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of insight. (3) What is the
fivefold item to be comprehensively understood? It means the five
aggregates that are the basis of clinging to existence: first, the aggregate
of material elements ( rūpa ), second, the aggregate of sensation ( vedanā ),
third, the aggregate of perception ( saṃjñā ), fourth, the aggregate of
dispositional forces ( saṃ skāra ), and the aggregate of consciousness
( vijñāna ). (4) What is the fivefold item to be relinquished? It means
five kinds of moral and spiritual hindrances: sexual desire, malice, sloth

and drowsiness, agitation and worry, and doubt. (5) What is the fivefold  
item to be directly experienced by oneself? It means the five kinds of  
religious doctrines for one who has realized the state of arhat and has  
no further stage of training: first, the doctrine of moral precepts and  
disciplines; second, the doctrine of meditative concentration; third, the  
doctrine of analytical insight; fourth, the doctrine of religious salvation;  
and fifth, the doctrine of the insight acknowledging liberation.  
Again there is the sixfold doctrinal item that is very useful for religious  
salvation, the sixfold doctrinal item that should be practiced, the sixfold  
doctrinal item that should be comprehensively understood, the sixfold  
doctrinal item that should be relinquished, and the sixfold doctrinal item  
that should be directly experienced by oneself. (1) What is the sixfold  
item that is very useful for religious salvation? It means the six principles  
of harmony: if a _bhikṣu_ adheres to the six principles of harmony in prac-  
tice, his conduct is worthy of respect and reverence and can harmonize  
the sangha, without creating any dispute or controversy, enabling him  
to act independently without the admixture of confusion. What are these  
six principles of harmony? First, if a monk always acts benevolently,  
pays respect toward those who uphold the practice of austerity, and  
abides with the mind of benevolence and love, his benevolence is  
regarded as “the principle of harmony, worthy of respect and reverence,  
capable of harmonizing the sangha, without creating any dispute or con-  
troversy, and he can independently proceed without the admixture of  
confusion.” Second, through adherence to benevolent and friendly speech,  
and third, through adherence to benevolent and friendly thought, a _bhikṣu_  
may obtain material support on the basis of the doctrinal teaching; fourth,  
he shares whatever he receives in his almsbowl with his colleagues with-  
out keeping it all for himself. Fifth, a _bhikṣu_ upholds the practice of the  
precepts belonging to those practitioners of saintly status, which should  
not be violated or altered but kept free from immoral contamination,  
and equips himself well with the foregoing principles that the learned  
elders praise and realizes the state of mental concentration. Sixth, a  
_bhikṣu_ realizes the liberation of those of saintly status, terminates the  
state of suffering together with others (i.e., equally), and continues to  
adhere to right views and various practices of austerity. These principles

are worthy of respect and reverence, and can harmonize the sangha,
without creating any dispute or controversy, enabling one to act inde-
pendently without the admixture of confusion. (2) What is the sixfold
item to be practiced? It means the six kinds of mindfulness: being mindful
of the Buddha, being mindful of the Dharma, being mindful of the
Sangha, being mindful of the precepts, being mindful of charity, and
being mindful of heavenly beings. (3) What is the sixfold item to be
comprehensively understood? It means the six internal bases of cognition:
first, the sense faculty of seeing; second, the sense faculty of hearing;
third, the sense faculty of smell; fourth, the sense faculty of taste; fifth,
the sense faculty of touch; and sixth, the intellectual faculty of con-
sciousness. (4) What is the sixfold item to be relinquished? It means the
six kinds of craving desire that are directed to external bases of cognition
respectively, i.e., the objects of the sense faculties: craving for the object
of seeing, for the object of hearing, for the object of smell, for the object
of taste, fifth, for the object of touch, and for the object of the intellect.
(5) What is the sixfold item to be directly experienced by oneself? It
means the six kinds of supernormal powers: supernormal psychic power,
supernormal hearing, the supernormal power of knowing the minds of
others, the supernormal power of recollecting and knowing past lives,
supernormal vision, and the supernormal power of eradicating defilements.
Again there is the sevenfold doctrinal item that is very useful for reli-
gious salvation, the sevenfold doctrinal item that should be practiced,
the sevenfold doctrinal item that should be comprehensively understood,
the sevenfold doctrinal item that should be relinquished, and the sevenfold
doctrinal item that should be directly experienced by oneself. (1) What
is the sevenfold item that is very useful for religious salvation? It means
the seven kinds of possessions (or wealth, treasure, etc.): first, the pos-
session of faith; second, the possession of precepts; third, the possession
of “shame upon self-reflection”; fourth, the possession of “shame before
others”; fifth, the possession of learning; sixth, the possession of charity;
and seventh, the possession of insight. (2) What is the sevenfold item
to be practiced? It means the seven auxiliary disciplines of enlightenment:
first, a bhikṣu practices the discipline of mindfulness on the basis of non-
desire and quiescence, distancing [himself from worldly matters]. In

like manner, he practices the discipline of discernment of the psycho -  
physical elements; third, he practices the discipline of effort; fourth, he  
practices the discipline of delight; fifth, he practices the discipline of  
freedom from bodily and mental disturbance; sixth, he practices the dis-  
cipline of the practice of concentration; and seventh, he practices the  
discipline of mental equanimity on the basis of nondesire and quiescence,  
distancing [himself from worldly matters]. (3) What is the sevenfold  
item to be comprehensively understood? It means the seven places where  
consciousness abides: when sentient beings are in possession of different  
bodies and different ideations, these are humans and heavenly beings.  
This is the initial abode of consciousness. Second, when sentient beings  
possess individual bodies but one and the same ideation, this is the time  
when the god Brahmā was initially born in Ābhāsvara Heaven, where  
communication is transmitted by light instead of sound. This is the  
second abode of consciousness. Third, when sentient beings possess one  
and the same body but different ideations, this is Ābhāsvara Heaven.  
This is the third abode of consciousness. Fourth, when sentient beings  
possess one and the same body and ideation, this is Śubha kṛtsna Heaven.  
This is the fourth abode of consciousness. Fifth, when sentient beings  
reside in the sphere of infinite space, this is the fifth abode of conscious-  
ness. Sixth, when sentient beings reside in the sphere of infinite con-  
sciousness, this is the sixth abode of consciousness. Seventh, when sen-  
tient beings reside in the sphere of nothingness or nonutility, this is the  
seventh abode of consciousness. (4) What is the sevenfold item to be  
relinquished? It means the seven kinds of defilement: craving for sexual  
desire, craving for existence, wrong view, self-conceit, craving for malice,  
ignorance, and doubt. (5) What is the sevenfold item to be directly expe-  
rienced by oneself. It means the seven kinds of power to exhaust the  
influence of defilement: first, a _bhikṣu_ who has terminated the influence  
of defilement sees all the elements of existence as suffering, having orig-  
inated from causal concatenation, which can be brought to cessation as  
they really are. He sees desire as a fiery pit, also as a weapon, like a  
knife or sword. Though he knows the arising of desire and sees it, he is  
not attached to it nor does he abide in it. He engages in thorough intro-  
spection into the causal chain in the order of cessation as well as in the

order of origination, and thus understands the origin of desire and its
cessation as it really is. The bhikṣu who has thus terminated the influence
of defilement through the practice of introspection is free from the influ-
ence of the worldly vices of avarice and stinginess, and evil and bad
psycho physical elements do not arise in his existence. He practices the
four disciplines of applying mental awareness, and hence he is engaged
with many items to be practiced and carried out. He is also engaged in
cultivating five spiritual faculties and correlative forces and practicing
the seven auxiliary disciplines of enlightenment, as well as the eightfold
noble path of cessation.
Again there is the eightfold doctrinal item that is very useful for reli-
gious salvation, the eightfold doctrinal item that should be practiced,
the eightfold doctrinal item that should be comprehensively understood,
the eightfold doctrinal item that should be relinquished, and the eightfold
doctrinal item that should be directly experienced by oneself. (1) What
is the eightfold item that is very useful for religious salvation? It means
the eight kinds of causal factors that enable one to acquire knowledge
when the practice of austerity has not been fully perfected, and to broaden
and strengthen that knowledge when the practice of austerity has been
perfected. What are these eight items? Here, when a bhikṣu abides in
reliance on the World-honored One, or abides in reliance on his teaching
elder or a practitioner of austerity who is endowed with knowledge, he
becomes aware of shame upon self-reflection and shame before his
teacher, and cherishes a sense of adoration and reverence toward the
teacher. This is the first kind of causal factor that enables a bhikṣu to
acquire knowledge when the practice of austerity has not been fully per-
fected and to broaden and strengthen that knowledge when the practice
of austerity has been perfected. Second, a bhikṣu abides in reliance to
the World-honored One and closely questions him whenever possible,
saying, “What is the meaning of this doctrine, sir?” “What is intended,
sir?” At that moment, any honorable senior monk should explain the
profound meaning of the doctrine referred to for the sake of the junior
monk. This is the second kind of causal factor. Third, having thus listened
to the meaning of the doctrine, the junior bhikṣu becomes settled in body
and mind. This is the third causal factor. Fourth, having thus become

settled in body and mind, the junior _bhikṣu_ does not engage in nonreli-  
gious and idle speech, but when he joins his colleagues he either speaks  
about the doctrine or invites others to talk about it; otherwise, he does  
not forsake the discipline of noble silence. This is the fourth causal factor.  
Fifth, he attends many discourses for learning, broadens his knowledge,  
and upholds it without forgetting it. He intuits the depth of the various  
doctrines, the various degrees of good, higher, middle, and lower, the  
truth of meanings and essences, and, endowed with the practice of aus-  
terity, he abides firmly, his mind unswayed when reviewing what he has  
learned. This is the fifth causal factor. Sixth, engaged in the practice of  
terminating evil but increasing good without slackening, a _bhikṣu_ strives  
hard, sustains the doctrine, and does not forsake it. This is the sixth  
causal factor. Seventh, he comes to acquire the insight into origin and  
cessation, knows the goal of saintly realization, and thus reaches the end  
of suffering. This is the seventh causal factor. Eighth, he analytically  
intuits the origination and cessation of the five aggregates of existence,  
specifying that “This is the aggregate of material form, its causal context,  
and its cessation. This is the aggregate of feeling, that of ideation, that  
of dispositional forces, that of consciousness, the causal context of con-  
sciousness, and the cessation of it.” This is the eighth causal factor that  
enables a _bhikṣu_ to acquire knowledge when the practice of austerity  
has not been fully perfected and to broaden and strengthen that knowledge  
when the practice of austerity has been perfected. (2) What is the eightfold  
item to be practiced? It means the eightfold noble path: right view, right  
thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right  
mindfulness, and right concentration. (3) What is the eightfold item to  
be comprehensively understood? It means the eight criteria of the secular  
world: gain and loss, infamy and fame, praise and blame, and suffering  
and happiness. (4) What is the eightfold item to be relinquished? It means  
the eight kinds of wrong conduct (i.e., conduct counter to the eightfold  
noble path): wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action,  
wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong concen-  
tration. (5) What is the eightfold item to be directly experienced by one-  
self? It means the eight kinds of liberation: first, the liberation realized  
when one, with an ideation of internal form, perceives external forms;

second, the liberation realized when, without any ideation of internal
form, he perceives external forms; third, the liberation realized when he
has thus terminated all defilements; fourth, the liberation realized when,
having transcended all ideations of form and annihilated sensory reaction,
he abides in the first formless state of concentration, the sphere of infinite
space; fifth, the liberation realized when, having transcended the sphere
of infinite space, he abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness; sixth,
the liberation realized when, having transcended the previous sphere,
he abides in the sphere of nothingness or nonutility; seventh, the liberation
realized when, having transcending the previous sphere, he abides in
the sphere of neither ideation nor nonideation; and eighth, the liberation
realized when, having transcending this sphere, he abides in the final
state of cessation, having transcended the senses and ideation, which is
equivalent to the third saintly state of anāgāmin.
Again there is the ninefold doctrinal item that is very useful for reli-
gious salvation, the ninefold doctrinal item that should be practiced, the
ninefold doctrinal item that should be comprehensively understood, the
ninefold doctrinal item that should be relinquished, and the ninefold
doctrinal item that should be directly experienced by oneself. (1) What
is the ninefold item that is very useful for religious salvation? It means
the nine qualities for which to strive: moral purity in upholding the pre-
cepts, purity of mind, purity of views, the purity of overcoming doubt,
the purity of analytical excellence, knowing the right path from wrong
ones, the purity of knowing the method of reaching the goal, the purity
of the absence of desire, and the purity of deliverance. (2) What is the
ninefold item to be practiced? It means the nine roots of proper mental
attention: delight, devotion, joy, well-adjusted happiness, concentration,
absolute knowledge, the eradication of defilement, equanimity, the
absence of desire, and liberation. (3) What is the ninefold item to be
comprehensively understood? It means the nine places of sentient beings.
First, when sentient beings are in possession of different bodies and dif-
ferent ideations, these are humans and heavenly beings. This is the initial
abode of sentient beings. Second, when sentient beings possess different
bodies but one and the same ideation, this is the time when the god
Brahmā was initially born in Ābhāsvara Heaven, where communication

is transmitted by light instead of sound. This is the second abode of sen-  
tient beings. Third, when sentient beings possess one and the same body  
but different ideations, this is Ābhāsvara Heaven. This is the third abode  
of sentient beings. Fourth, when sentient beings possess one and the  
same body and ideation, this is Śubhakṛtsna Heaven. This is the fourth  
abode of sentient beings. Fifth, when sentient beings reside in the sphere  
of neither ideation nor external awareness, this is Āsaṃjñika Heaven.  
This is the fifth abode of sentient beings. Sixth, when sentient beings  
reside in the sphere of infinite space, this is the sixth abode of sentient  
beings. Seventh, when sentient beings reside in the sphere of infinite con-  
sciousness, this is the seventh abode of sentient beings. Eighth, when  
sentient beings reside in the sphere of nothingness or nonutility, this is  
the eighth abode of sentient beings. Ninth, when sentient beings reside  
in the sphere of neither ideation nor nonideation, this is the ninth abode  
of sentient beings. (4) What is the ninefold item to be relinquished? It  
means the nine roots of craving: first there is craving; second, because  
of craving there arises the act of seeking; third, because of seeking there  
arises a gain; fourth, because of gain there arises a thought of its utility;  
fifth, because of the thought of utility there arises desire; sixth, because  
of desire there arises strong attachment; seventh, because of attachment  
there arises an act of grasping; eighth, because of grasping there arises  
an act of parsimony; and ninth, because of parsimony there arises an act  
of guarding. (5) What is the ninefold item to be directly experienced by  
oneself? It means the nine successive stages of the process of cessation:  
first, when a _bhikṣu_ enters the first meditative absorption there ceases to  
be the sound of auditory faculty; second, when he enters the second med-  
itative absorption there ceases to be mental activity of thinking and delib-  
eration; third, when he enters the third meditative absorption there ceases  
to be the awareness of delight; fourth, when he enters the fourth meditative  
absorption there cease to be the signs of inhalation or exhalation; fifth,  
when he enters the sphere of infinite space, the initial formless state of  
concentration, there ceases to be the ideation of external form; sixth,  
when he enters the sphere of infinite consciousness there ceases to be the  
ideation of empty space; seventh, when he enters the sphere of nothingness  
or nonutility there ceases to be the ideation of consciousness;eighth,

when he enters the sphere of neither ideation nor nonideation, there
ceases to be the ideation of nonutility or nothingness; ninth, when he
enters the final state of cessation, having transcended the senses and
ideation, which is equivalent to third saintly state of anāgāmin, there
ceases to be both ideation and sensation.
Again there is the tenfold doctrinal item that is very useful for religious
salvation, the tenfold doctrinal item that should be practiced, the tenfold
doctrinal item that should be comprehensively understood, the tenfold
doctrinal item that should be relinquished, and the tenfold doctrinal item
that should be directly experienced by oneself. (1) What is the tenfold
item that is very useful for religious salvation? It means the ten kinds
of refuge for religious salvation. Fiirst, a bhikṣu is endowed with two
hundred and fifty disciplines, as well as possessing dignified deportment,
and, being afraid of committing even a minute offense, he trains in all
of the disciplines with meticulous evenness, having no detrimental imbal-
ance. Second, he is befriended by good associates. Third, a bhikṣu uses
words appropriately, neither in excess nor insufficiently, and he is able
to understand the meanings beyond words. Fourth, he willingly seeks
out opportunities to listen to discourses on the Dharma and freely shares
whatever doctrine he has received to others, without hesitation. Fifth, a
bhikṣu visits the places of various practitioners of austerity and open-
handedly offers his assistance to them, accomplishing whatever is difficult
to accomplish, and also teaching others how to do the same. Sixth, he
attends as many discourses as possible to acquire knowledge and retains
whatever he has learned in memory, without forgetting anything. Seventh,
he exerts himself to eradicate unfavorable mental obstacles and promote
favorable mental states. Eighth, a self-motivated bhikṣu always focuses
his mind with vigilant mindfulness on essentially good conduct, as if
he is visualizing it right before his eyes. Ninth, he realizes transcendent
insight and knowledge, intuitively perceives the origination and cessation
of the psychophysical elements, and, on the basis of the disciplines
upheld by wise and saintly disciples, he eradicates the root of all suffering.
Tenth, he is content with quiet seclusion, engages in mental contempla-
tion, and never wastes time in worldly pastimes during sessions of med-
itation. (2) What is the tenfold item to be practiced? It means the ten

right practices: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right  
livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness ( _samyak-smṛti_ ), right concen-  
tration, right wisdom, and right liberation. (3) What is the tenfold item  
to be comprehensively understood? It means the ten bases of cognition,  
namely the five sense faculties and their respective objects: the visual  
organ, the eye; the auditory organ, the ear; the olfactory organ, the nose;  
the gustatory organ, the tongue; the tactile organ, the body; and the visual  
object of form, the auditory object of sound, the olfactory object of smell,  
the gustatory object of taste, and the tactile object of touch. (4) What is  
the tenfold item to be relinquished? It means the ten kinds of wrong  
paths: wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong  
livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness ( _mithyā-smṛti_ or _mithyā-  
vāyāma_ ), wrong concentration, wrong deliverance, and wrong knowl-  
edge. (5) What is the tenfold item to be directly experienced by oneself?  
It means the ten norms of the arhat who does not require further training:  
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood,  
right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration, right wisdom, and  
right liberation.  
O _bhikṣu_ s, the foregoing is called the teaching of the ten fivefold doc-  
trines, which I have now completed for you. From the time I realized  
the status of a tathāgata I have continued to accomplish whatever should  
be done for the benefit of my disciples, and I have completed it. I have  
instructed you with friendly love and in a gentle manner. You should  
respectfully receive the teaching I have given and carry out what has  
been taught by me. O _bhikṣu_ s, you should abide in a quiet, secluded  
place such as an empty spot under a tree, make effort to practice medi-  
tation, and refrain from slackening. If you do not work hard now toward  
your religious goal, what use is there in regretting it later on? I wish for  
you to make effort to uphold the foregoing teaching.  
At that time, having listened to the Buddha’s exhortation, the _bhikṣu_ s  
were delighted and carried out what was taught by the Buddha.
