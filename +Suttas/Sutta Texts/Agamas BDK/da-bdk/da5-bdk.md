### Sutra 5

### Lesser Causality

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 27: Aggañña Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was sojourning in the country  
of Śrāvastī at Mṛgamātā’s lecture hall at the Nunnery of the Eastern Grove,  
accompanied by one thousand two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s. At that time,  
two _brāhmaṇa_ s, with firm faith in their hearts, visited the place of the Buddha,  
renounced family life, and joined the Buddha’s religious path. One was called  
Vāseṭṭha (Pāli) and the other was Bhāradvāja.  
At that time, the World-honored One came out of the meditation room  
and began his meditative walk back and forth on the hall’s terrace. Then,  
having seen the Buddha practicing walking meditation, Vaseṭṭha quickly  
went to Bhāradvāja and said to him:

Don’t you know that the Tathāgata has now come out of the meditation  
room and has begun his meditative walk? We should go see the World-  
honored One, and we should listen to what the Tathāgata teaches us.  
Then, as advised by his friend, Bhāradvāja followed Vāseṭṭha to visit the  
World-honored One and, having venerated the Buddha by bowing their fore-  
heads to his feet, both began to follow the Buddha in the practice of walking  
meditation.  
At that time, the World-honored One said to Vāseṭṭha, “O you two, born  
in the _brāhmaṇa_ class, with firm faith in the Dharma that I teach, have you  
decided to forsake family life and practice the way?” Vāseṭṭha replied, “Yes,  
we have so decided, sir.”  
The Buddha said to them, “O you two, when you are practicing the path  
of religion under my instruction, isn’t it likely that other _brāhmaṇa_ s will  
accuse you and make complaints and warnings?” They answered, “Yes, sir,  
our renunciation of family life and conversion to the path of practice under  
the Buddha’s guidance will invite such accusations of us, sir.”  
The Buddha asked, “Why do they accuse you?” At once they replied to  
the Buddha:

farmers and merchants; and fourth, the _śūdra_ s, who are destitute or of  
servile status.  
O Vāseṭṭha, listen carefully. Within the _kṣatriya_ class there are mur-  
derers, thieves, those who commit sexual abuse, speakers of falsehood,  
double-dealers, speakers of harsh words, frivolous sycophants, those  
who have covetous minds, those with malicious intent, and those with  
wrong views. There are also these kinds of wrongdoers among the _brāh-  
maṇa_ class, among the _vaiśya_ s, and among the _śūdra_ people as well.  
O Vāseṭṭha, for any wrong action there will be a unfortunate retri-  
bution. When one commits an evil action, he will reap an evil retribu-  
tion. If such causal effect occurs only among those of the _kṣatriya,  
vaiśya,_ and _śūdra_ classes but not among the _brāhmaṇa_ s, then the _brāh-  
maṇa_ s could claim that their class is superior while the rest are inferior;  
that their class is clean and white while the rest are black and dark;  
that their class is derived from Brahmā, born of his mouth; and that  
because their class realizes pure and genuine emancipation in the present  
life, the life to come will also be pure and genuine. If, however, accord-  
ing to the same principle, for a wrong action there is an evil retribution;  
that is, if one were to commit an evil action, black and dark in nature,  
that person will receive an evil retribution equivalent in nature with  
its action. This also invariably applies equally to those of the _brāhmaṇa,  
kṣatriya,vaiśya,_ and _śūdra_ classses, and therefore the _brāhmaṇa_ s  
cannot claim that their class alone is pure and genuine and superior.  
O Vāseṭṭha, if, on the other hand, within the _kṣatriya_ class there are  
those who abstain from committing murder, theft, sexual abuse, speak-  
ing falsehoods, double-talk, using harsh words, frivolous sycophancy,  
and who do not have a covetous mind, malicious intent, and wrong  
views, then in a similar manner there are also those who abstain from  
these wrong deeds among those of the _brāhmaṇa_ , _vaiśya,_ and _śūdra_  
classes. If anyone who belongs to any of these classes should learn the  
foregoing ten kinds of good deeds and actually put them into practice,  
good rewards will necessarily follow. If one commits a good and gen-  
uine act, he will receive a good reward. If this principle of causal reward  
applies only to the _brāhmaṇa_ people and not to _kṣatriya_ s, _vaiśya_ s, or  
_śūdra_ s, then the _brāhmaṇa_ s can claim that their _brāhmaṇa_ class alone

The Buddha said further to Vāseṭṭha:

sense of weariness due to overabundance. Other sentient beings also  
imitated these beings in tasting the water, and after a few tastes they  
too were invariably soon addicted to it as well. Even before they felt  
fully satisfied, because of this diet their bodies became coarse and their  
flesh became stiff, losing its heavenly subtle color. They no longer had  
the supernormal speed of flight and were only able to crawl on the sur-  
face of the ground. Their bodily light was totally diminished, and  
heaven and earth were nearly all dark.  
O Vāseṭṭha, you should know of the regularity of heaven and earth,  
such that after the great darkness there will appear the sun, moon, and  
stars in mid-space; later there will appear day and night and brightness  
and darkness, respectively; and finally, days, months, and years. At  
that time the sentient beings ate only from the earth and thus existed  
a while on the surface of the ground. Whoever ate more of the food  
developed a sickly complexion with rough and ugly skin, whereas  
whoever ate less of it continued to bear a pleasant complexion. Varieties  
of appearance, such as pleasant, ugly, noble, and handsome, all began  
from that circumstance.  
Some of those whose appearance was more handsome than ordinary  
became conceited and slighted those whose appearance was ugly. In  
return, those whose appearance was ugly felt jealous and covetous,  
and hated those whose had a better appearance. The sentient beings  
began to dispute among themselves. At that time, the sweetwater foun-  
tain dried up of its own accord, but the area naturally produced out-  
growths upon the ground, which were of pleasant color and taste, good  
scent and cleanliness, and could be eaten. At that time, the sentient  
beings continued to live again by partaking of these outgrowths from  
the ground. Whoever ate [of these outgrowths] excessively lost their  
good complexion, their skin becoming rough and ugly, while whoever  
ate less retained their pleasant complexion. The beings who managed  
to keep their pleasant appearance became conceited and disdained  
those who looked ugly, while the latter became jealous and covetous  
and hated the former. The sentient beings thus once again began to dis-  
pute among themselves.

meals.” Later, one of his friends called him to go harvest rice together.  
The former replied, “I have [already] harvested enough rice to be used  
for two meals today. If you wish to harvest, go by yourself.” The man  
then thought to himself, “How cunning he is! He harvested more rice  
than he needed for one meal and stored it until it was needed. I too will  
now harvest and store enough rice for three days.” Thus, that man [har-  
vested and] stored enough rice for three days’ meals. Then another  
man asked him to harvest rice together. He replied, “I have already  
harvested and stored the amount I need for three days. If you wish to  
go harvest rice, go by yourself.” So this man too thought to himself,  
“He is cunning; he harvested enough rice to serve for three days and  
keeps it in storage. I will try to best him by harvesting and storing  
enough rice for five days.” At once he harvested rice to serve for five  
days. Soon all the sentient beings tried to outdo the others in harvesting  
rice. Thus, overharvested, the rice crop became barren and weed-ridden  
and began to produce husks. Once cut down it did not grow again.  
The sentient beings were not pleased at all and were worried and  
bewildered. They thought:

also reported to the others, “This man struck me.” At that time, having  
seen such disputes, everyone was distressed and they said:

Then they chose someone from among themselves who was tall and  
physically imposing, handsome in appearance, and who projected an  
aura of authority. They said to him, “We wish you to become our leader  
as elected by us, equal voters, to protect those who need protection,  
punish those who should be punished, and leave alone those whose  
lives need not be interrupted. We shall collect a portion of each of our  
rice harvests for your stipend.” The person thus chosen by the members  
of the community listened to the people’s words, took on the role of  
chieftain, and dealt with the various disputes, while the community  
collected a portion of each member’s rice harvest and provided it to  
their leader. The [leader] consoled the public with good words. Having  
heard his words, the people greatly rejoiced and praised him, “Very  
good, _mahārāja_ (“great king”).”  
This was the origin of the title of “king” in the human world. Because  
the king ruled his citizens in reliance on the right Dharma, he was  
called a _kṣatriya_. This was the very beginning of the _kṣatriya_ class in  
the human world.  
There was one person among the members of the community who  
thought to himself, “Household life is a great danger; it is a poisonous  
thorn. I should abandon my household and stay in the mountain forests,  
practicing austerity in a secluded place.” This man thus renounced

he is bound to receive the retribution of suffering. In like manner, if  
someone of the _brāhmaṇa, vaiśya,_ or _śūdra_ classes commits wrong  
physical, verbal, or volitional actions, then when his body comes to  
dissolution and his life ends he is bound to receive the retribution of  
suffering.  
O Vāseṭṭha, if someone of the _kṣatriya_ class performs good physical,  
verbal, or volitional actions, when his body comes to dissolution and  
his life ends he is bound to receive the reward of happiness. In like  
manner, if someone of the _brāhmaṇa, vaiśya,_ or _śūdra_ classes performs  
good physical, verbal, or volitional actions, then when his body comes  
to dissolution and his life ends he is bound to receive the reward of  
happiness.  
O Vāseṭṭha, if someone of the _kṣatriya_ class commits a good or bad  
action physically, verbally, or mentally, when his body comes to dis-  
solution and his life ends he is bound to receive one of two types [of  
result]: either the reward of happiness or the retribution of suffering.  
In like manner, if someone, whether he is of the _brāhmaṇa, vaiśya,_ or  
_śūdra_ class, commits good or bad physical, verbal, or mental conduct,  
when his body comes to dissolution and his life ends he is bound to  
receive either the reward of happiness or the retribution of suffering.  
If someone of the _kṣatriya_ class shaves his hair and beard, dons the  
mendicant robe, and practices the path, and if he is engaged in the prac-  
tice of the seven auxiliary practices of enlightenment, it will not be long  
before he realizes the path. Why is that so? When someone of the _kṣatriya_  
class decides to wear the mendicant robe, renounce family life, and  
practice foremost austerity, he is certain to experience directly in the  
present life the exhaustion of the cause of birth and death, the accom-  
plishment of the practice of austerity, the accomplishment of what should  
be done [for religious salvation], and freedom from further rebirth. In  
the same way, when someone, whether he belongs to the _brāhmaṇa,  
vaiśya,_ or _śūdra_ class, decides to shave his hair and beard, wear the  
mendicant robe, and practice the seven auxiliary practices of enlight-  
enment, it will not be long before he realizes the path. Why? Because  
if he wears the mendicant robe, renounces family life, and practices  
foremost austerity, he is certain to experience directly in the present life

the exhaustion of the cause of birth and death, the accomplishment of  
the practice of austerity, the accomplishment of what should be done  
[for religious salvation], and freedom from further rebirth.  
O Vāseṭṭha, those _śramaṇa_ s who come out of those four different  
classes and are destined to realize insight and practice in perfect accor-  
dance, and thereby attain the ultimate state of arhatship, should indeed  
be regarded as primary among the five classes of people.  
The Buddha said to Vāseṭṭha, “The god Brahmā uttered the following  
verse:”

Among all the sentient beings,  
The _kṣatriya_ s are superior  
In their decisive renunciation of class status.  
They are foremost in the human world  
In regard to their capacity  
Of matching insight and practice.  
The Buddha said to Vāseṭṭha:  
What this Brahmā god said is good, it is not misleading. What this  
Brahmā god understood is not wrong, it is not a mistaken meaning. I  
shall now immediately approve his statement. Why? Because as Tathā-  
gata I am ready to assert the same statement.  
Among all the sentient beings,  
The _kṣatriya_ s are superior  
In their decisive renunciation of class status.  
They are foremost in the human world  
In regard to their capacity  
Of matching insight and practice.  
At that time, the World-honored One completed the foregoing exhortation.  
Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja realized freedom from the influence of defilements  
and attained the state in which their minds were totally liberated. Having lis-  
tened to the Buddha’s teaching, the two were delighted with the teaching  
and followed it.
