### The Rewards of the Life

### of a Śramaṇa

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 2: Sāmañña-phala Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. Once, when the Buddha was visiting the city of Rājagṛha,  
he stayed in a grove of mango trees belonging to the master of medicine  
Prince Jīvaka, accompanied by one thousand two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s.  
On that occasion, on the night of the full moon, King Ajātaśatru, the son of  
the queen mother from Videha,^17 summoned his principal queen and said,  
“Tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and bright there  
seems to be no difference between day and night. Tell me your wishes.”  
The queen replied:  
Yes, sire. Tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and  
bright there seems to be no difference between day and night. My wish  
is that Your Majesty’s hair be washed and that Your Majesty be bathed  
and made immaculate, so that we may enjoy some entertainment together  
with the palace ladies.  
The king then summoned his eldest son, Crown Prince Udāyibhadra, and  
said, “Tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and bright  
there seems to be no difference between day and night. Tell me your wishes.”  
The crown prince replied to the king:  
Yes, sire. Tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and  
bright there seems to be no difference between day and night. My wish  
is that the four divisions of the army are called to assemble and the plan  
[of an expedition] is laid out and discussed, so that we may punish the  
rebels on the frontier and then return to enjoy [the victorious feast] together.  
Again, King Ajātaśatru summoned his military commander, who had a  
distinguished record of courage and valor, and said, “Tonight’s moon, on the

fifteenth of the month, is so clear and bright there seems to be no difference  
between day and night. Tell me your wishes.”  
The general replied:  
Yes, sire. Tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and  
bright there seems to be no difference between day and night. My wish  
is that the four divisions of the army assemble and intelligence is gathered  
on the disturbances along the frontier, so that we may declare throughout  
the land [the results of] rebellion and of obedience, respectively.  
Again, the king summoned his prime minister, Varṣakāra, and said:  
Tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and bright there  
seems to be no difference between day and night. Among the _śramaṇa_ s and  
_brāhmaṇa_ s, whom should I visit in order to have my mind enlightened?  
The prime minister replied:  
Sire, tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and bright  
there seems to be no difference between day and night. There is a master  
called Purāṇa Kāśyapa, who guides his school of disciples. He is an erudite  
man and renowned in even the most distant regions. Just as a great ocean  
receives everything that flows into it, he is shown the respect of a great  
many offerings from a multitude of people. O great king, may Your Majesty  
pay your respects by visiting this master. When you see him there might  
be an opportunity for Your Majesty to be enlightened ( _pasīdeyya_ ).  
Again, King Ajātaśatru summoned Varṣakāra’s brother, Suniddha, and  
said:

Tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and bright there
seems to be no difference between day and night. Among the śramaṇa s
and brāhmaṇa s, whom should I visit in order to have my mind enlightened?
Suniddha replied:
Sire, tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and bright
there seems to be no difference between day and night. There is a master
called Maskarin Gośālīputra^18 who guides his school of disciples. He is

an erudite man and renowned in even the most distant regions. Just as a  
great ocean receives everything that flows into it, he receives the respect  
of offerings from a multitude of people. O great king, may Your Majesty  
pay your respects by visiting this master. When you see him there might be  
an opportunity for Your Majesty to be enlightened.  
Again, the king summoned his minister of religious rites ( _dianzuo; puro-  
hita_ ) and said:

Tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and bright there  
seems to be no difference between day and night. Among the _śramaṇa_ s  
and _brāhmaṇa_ s, whom should I visit in order to have my mind enlightened?  
The minister of religious rites replied:  
Sire, tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and bright  
there seems to be no difference between day and night. There is a master  
called Ajita-keśakambalin, who guides his school of disciples. He is an  
erudite man and renowned in even the most distant regions. Just as a great  
ocean receives everything that flow into it, he receives the respect of offer-  
ings from a multitude of people. O great king, may Your Majesty pay your  
respects by visiting this master. When you see him there might be an  
opportunity for Your Majesty to be enlightened.  
Again, King Ajātaśatru summoned the officer in charge of the palace gate  
and said:

Tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and bright there
seems to be no difference between day and night. Among the śramaṇa s
and brāhmaṇa s, whom should I visit in order to have my mind enlightened?
The officer in charge of the palace gate replied:
Sire, tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and bright
there seems to be no difference between day and night. There is a master
called Kakuda-katyāyana, who guides his school of disciples. He is an
erudite man and renowned in even the most distant regions. Just as a great
ocean receives everything that flows into it, he receives the respect of
offerings from a multitude of people. O great king, may Your Majesty

pay your respects by visiting this master. When you see him there might
be an opportunity for Your Majesty to be enlightened.
Again, King Ajātaśatru summoned Udāyin, the son of Maṇḍikā, and said:
Tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and bright there
seems to be no difference between day and night. Among the śramaṇa s and
brāhmaṇa s, whom should I visit in order to have my mind enlightened?
Udāyin replied:
Sire, tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and bright
there seems to be no difference between day and night. There is a master
called Sañjayī Vairaṭṭiputra, who guides his school of disciples. He is an
erudite man and renowned in even the most distant regions. Just as a great
ocean receives everything that flows into it, he receives the respect of
offerings from a multitude of people. O great king, may Your Majesty
pay your respects by visiting this master. When you see him there might
be an opportunity for Your Majesty to be enlightened.
Again, the king summoned his [step]brother, Prince Abhaya, and said:
Tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and bright there
seems to be no difference between day and night. Among the śramaṇa s and
brāhmaṇa s, whom should I visit in order to have my mind enlightened?
Prince Abhaya, the king’s brother, replied:
Sire, tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and bright
there seems to be no difference between day and night. There is a master
called Nirgrantha Jñātiputra, who guides his school of disciples. He is an
erudite man and renowned in even the most distant regions. Just as a great
ocean receives everything that flow into it, he receives the respect of offer-
ings from a multitude of people. O great king, may Your Majesty pay your
respects by visiting this master. When you see him there might be an
opportunity for Your Majesty to be enlightened.
Again, the king summoned his master of medicine, Prince Jīvaka, and said:
Tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and bright there

seems to be no difference between day and night. Among the _śramaṇa_ s and  
_brāhmaṇa_ s, whom should I visit in order to have my mind enlightened?  
Prince Jīvaka replied:  
Sire, tonight’s moon, on the fifteenth of the month, is so clear and bright  
there seems to be no difference between day and night. There is a master  
called the Buddha. Your Majesty should pay your respects by visiting  
him. When you see him there will surely be an opportunity for Your  
Majesty to be enlightened.  
The king commanded his master of medicine, “Please make my elephant  
and another five hundred white elephants ready.”  
Jīvaka had the royal elephant and five hundred white elephants made  
ready at once, and then reported to the king, “The carriages are ready, sire.  
Please let us know the time for departure.”  
King Ajātaśatru rode on the royal elephant and his five hundred queens  
rode on the five hundred female elephants. All carried torches to demonstrate  
the regal authority of the procession and they went out of the city of Rājagṛha.  
On the way to the Buddha’s resting place the king [halted the procession  
and] said to Jīvaka, “Are you not betraying me into the hands of my adver-  
saries and joining their side to take the members of this procession prisoner?”  
Jīvaka replied:  
O great king, I would not dare betray Your Majesty, nor would I dare to  
plot your demise, nor wish to join with Your Majesty’s adversaries to lead  
this royal procession astray. Please proceed and you will surely find an  
occasion for happiness.  
The king continued for a while, but again said to Jīvaka, “Are you not betray-  
ing me now into the hands of my adversaries and joining their side to lead the  
members of this procession astray?” This was repeated a third time.  
Why was the king so suspicious? Because there was no sound whatsoever  
in the entire area, despite there being one thousand two hundred and fifty  
_bhikṣu_ s attending the Buddha. The complete silence made the king suspect  
a plot.  
Again, Jīvaka repeated:

O great king, I would not dare betray Your Majesty, nor would I dare to
plot your demise, nor wish to join with Your Majesty’s adversaries to lead
this royal procession astray. Please proceed and Your Majesty will surely
find an occasion for happiness. Why? Because śramaṇa s prefer quiet and
remain always in seclusion. Because of this, there are no sounds of con-
versation, sire. May Your Majesty please proceed, for we are in sight of
the mango grove, sire.
Reaching the entrance to the grove, King Ajātaśatru dismounted from his
elephant and then disarmed, leaving his sword, his parasol, and the five sym-
bols of his kingship at the gate. He entered the grove on foot and said to
Jīvaka, “Now, where is the Buddha, the World-honored One?”
Jīvaka replied, “O great king, the Buddha is in the lecture hall. There is
a light outside the building. The World-honored One is seated in the lion
throne, facing south, sire.”
The king proceeded and saw the World-honored One sitting by himself.
Seeing this, King Ajātaśatru washed his feet outside the building and stepped
into the hall. Looking around, he was delighted and thought to himself:
Now, see how the śramaṇa s absorbed in silent meditation permeate [the
place with] such calmness and introspection. It is my wish that Crown
Prince Udāyibhadra should become equally endowed with a calm and
introspective mind.
At that moment, the World-honored One said to King Ajātaśatru:
Thinking of your son, you have said that you wish Crown Prince Udāyi -
bhadra would become equally endowed with a calm and introspective
mind. Please come and take a seat before me.
King Ajātaśatru went forward, and after touching the ground at the
Buddha’s feet with his forehead, he took a seat to one side and said to the
Buddha, “I have a question, sir. If Your Reverence can spare me a moment,
I would like to ask my question.”
The Buddha replied, “O great king, if you have a question, feel free to
ask it.”
The king then said:

O World-honored One, just as we ride on an elephant, horse, or chariot  
and learn battle strategies as well as the use of a dagger, spear, sword,  
bow and arrow, and fighting cane, today every prince, strongman, great  
wrestler, messenger, leathermaker, barber, clothmaker, carriage driver,  
brickmaker, and bamboo or reed craftsman all earn their respective liveli-  
hoods by mastering their profession and using it attain happiness in life  
as well as they can. In like manner, each father and mother, wife and hus-  
band, maid and servant, and errand boy too enjoys their own kind of hap-  
piness in life. In this way, everyone fulfills their own life and enjoys the  
fruit of their own happiness. Now, many _śramaṇa_ s, like the ones here,  
are engaged in the practice of austerity. Do they acquire anything good  
as a result of their practice of austerity, sir?  
The Buddha said to the king, “Have you asked this question of any other  
_śramaṇa_ or _brāhmaṇa_ before?”  
King Ajātaśatru replied:  
Yes, I have visited a number of _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s and asked them  
this same question, sir. I recall that I once visited Purāṇa Kāśyapa and  
said to him, “Just as we ride on an elephant, horse, or chariot and learn  
battlefield strategies and so on, other people carry on with the means of  
their livelihood and enjoy the fruits of their own happiness. Now can your  
followers, who are all engaged in the pursuit of your path, acquire any  
results in this life like the satisfactions gained by other people?”  
That teacher replied, “If Your Majesty acts or lets others act to inflict  
agonies and torment people, whether by injuring, cutting, and dismem-  
bering [their bodies] or by burning, pulverizing, and destroying [their  
homes], or to commit other transgressions such as lying, stealing, tres-  
passing, plundering, destroying evidence, arson, murder, sexual abuse,  
and so on—despite all of this, [understand that] no one is really doing  
anything evil.  
“O great king, if someone were to flay human beings with a sharp knife,  
creating a pile of flesh and then scattering it all over the ground, this would  
not constitute an evil, nor would such an action produce any moral retri-  
bution, good or bad. Irrespective of whether one chops up human bodies

on the southern bank of the Ganges River or promotes universal benev-
olence on the northern bank of the river, there is no difference whatsoever
between benefiting everyone on one bank and destroying everyone on the
other bank, nor are there any results therefrom.”
The king continued:
Suppose someone asks about a melon and the other person talks about a
plum, or when the former asks about a plum and the latter replies in terms
of a melon—that teacher’s reply was just like that. When I asked him if
those who practice his path realize a certain result in this life, that śramaṇa
replied that there is no such thing as reward or retribution regardless of
whether one’s actions are good or bad. I could not help thinking, “I am a
kṣatriya, properly anointed to kingship’s throne. Yet I [should refrain
from] exercising my power to arrest, exile, or execute any of these prac-
titioners who have renounced domestic life. Nonetheless, I feel dissatisfied
with this teacher’s answer.” With those thoughts, I left his place for good.
King Ajātaśatru again said to the Buddha:
On another occasion, I visited the teacher Maskarin Gośālīputra’s place
and asked him the same question, “Just as we ride on an elephant, horse,
or chariot and learn battlefield strategies and so on, other people carry on
with the means of their livelihood and enjoy the fruits of their own hap-
piness. Now can your followers, who are all engaged in the pursuit of
your path, acquire any results in this life like the satisfactions gained by
other people?”
That teacher replied, “O great king, there is no meaning in charity,
none whatsoever in an act of giving, nor is there any meaning in any of
the sacrificial rites; there are neither good act nor bad acts, nor is there
any moral retribution, good or bad, derived therefrom. There is neither
life here and now nor an afterlife, nor is there a father or mother, or a god,
a spirit, or a living being. Moreover, there is neither a śramaṇa nor a brāh-
maṇa to proclaim the equality [of everything]. Nor is there anyone who,
in this world or the afterlife, directly experiences [any kind of realization],
or anyone who can teach it to others. Whoever speaks of anything as ‘exis-
tent’ is a liar, and the words he utters lack all reality.”

O World-honored One, suppose someone asks about a melon and the  
other person talks about a plum, or when the former asks about a plum  
and the latter replies in terms of a melon—that teacher’s reply was just  
like that. When I asked him if those who practice his path realize a certain  
result in this life, he replied that the question was meaningless. Again I  
thought to myself, “I am a _kṣatriya,_ properly anointed to kingship’s throne.  
Yet I [should refrain from] exercising my power to arrest, exile, or execute  
any of these practitioners who have renounced domestic life. Nonetheless,  
I feel dissatisfied with this teacher’s answer.” With those thoughts, I left  
his place for good.

Again, the king said to the Buddha:

On another occasion, I visited Ajita-keśakambalin’s place and asked him  
the same question, “O virtuous one, just as we ride on an elephant, horse,  
or chariot, and learn battlefield strategies and so on, other people carry  
on with the means of their livelihood and enjoy the fruits of their own  
happiness. Now can your followers, who are all engaged in the pursuit  
of your path, acquire any results in this life like the satisfactions gained  
by other people?”  
That teacher replied, “For all who receive a body consisting of the four  
elements, when life ends the earth element in the body returns to the earth,  
the water element returns to water, the wind element returns to the wind,  
and the fire element returns to fire. Thus every element of the body devolves  
and every faculty therein dissolves and returns to nothingness. When people  
die their bodies are placed on a funeral platform or left out among the ceme-  
tery mounds; when fire consumes the skeleton it turns dull white or into  
ashes. Whether one is wise or a fool, when their life ends everyone’s [body],  
without exception, decomposes, manifesting the law of total annihilation.”  
O World-honored One, suppose someone asks about a melon and the  
other person talks about a plum, or when the former asks about a plum  
and the latter replies in terms of a melon—that teacher’s reply was just  
like that. When I asked him if those who practice his path realize a certain  
result in this life, he replied that there was nothing but total annihilation.  
Agian I thought to myself, “I am a _kṣatriya,_ properly anointed to kingship’s  
throne. Yet I [should refrain from] exercising my power to arrest, exile,

or execute any of these practitioners who have renounced domestic life.
Nonetheless, I feel dissatisfied with this teacher’s answer.” With those
thoughts, I left his place for good.
Again, King Ajātaśatru said to the Buddha:
On another occasion, I visited Kakuda-katyāyana’s place and asked him
the same question, “O virtuous one, just as we ride on an elephant, horse,
or chariot and learn battlefield strategies and so on, other people carry on
with the means of their livelihood and enjoy the fruits of their own hap-
piness. Now can your followers, who are all engaged in the pursuit of
your path, acquire any results in this life like the satisfactions gained by
other people?”
That teacher replied, “O great king, those who lack strength and virility
have little power for action as well as little concept of expediency. Some
people may become attached [to things] without due cause or conditions,
while others remain free from attachments, their pure and genuine [practice
also] coming about without due cause or conditions. Those sentient beings
who are endowed with life invariably lack the power that would enable
them to realize their own freedom. Hence, no harm or blame. For them,
constancy lies in the midst of numbers, undergoing the six kinds of life
cycles and experiencing both pleasure and pain.”
O World-honored One, suppose someone asks about a melon and the
other person talks about a plum, or when the former asks about a plum
and the latter replies in terms of a melon—that teacher’s reply was just
like that. When I asked him if those who practice his path realize a certain
result in this life, he replied that living beings lack the power [to gain their
own freedom]. Again I thought to myself, “I am a kṣatriya, properly
anointed to kingship’s throne. Yet I [should refrain from] exercising my
power to arrest, exile, or execute any of these practitioners who have
renounced domestic life. Nonetheless, I feel dissatisfied with this teacher’s
answer.” With those thoughts, I left his place for good.
Again, the king said to the Buddha:
On another occasion, I visited Sañjayī Vairaṭṭiputra’s place and asked him
the same question, “O virtuous one, just as we ride on an elephant, horse,

or chariot and learn battlefield strategies and so on, other people carry on  
with the means of their livelihood and enjoy the fruits of their own hap-  
piness. Now can your followers, who are all engaged in the pursuit of  
your path, acquire any results in this life like the satisfactions gained by  
other people?’”  
That teacher replied, “O great king, if Your Majesty asks, ‘Do _śramaṇa_ s  
have some reward in this life?’, this may be answered in the following  
manner: (1) This is identical (i.e., true; _zishishi_ ); (2) this is different  
( _zishiyi_ ); (3) this is not different ( _zishifeiyi_ ); (4) this is not not-different  
( _zishifeibuyi_ ). This is the first question-and-answer variation.  
“On the other hand, if Your Majesty asks, ‘Do _śramaṇa_ s have no reward  
in this life?’, this may be answered in the following manner: (1) This is  
identical (true); (2) this is different; (3) this is not different; (4) this is not  
not-different.  
“If again Your Majesty asks, ‘Do _śramaṇa_ s have neither any reward,  
nor no reward in this life?’, this may be answered in the following manner:  
(1) This is identical (true); (2) this is different; (3) this is not different; (4)  
this is not not-different.”  
O World-honored One, suppose someone asks about a melon and the  
other person talks about a plum, or when the former asks about a plum  
and the latter replies in terms of a melon—that teacher’s reply was just  
like that. When I asked him if those who practice his path realize a certain  
goal in this present life, he again replied by speaking in terms of difference  
(i.e., always in terms of something else). Again I thought to myself, “I  
am a _kṣatriya,_ properly anointed to kingship’s throne. Yet I [should refrain  
from] exercising my power to arrest, exile, or execute any of these prac-  
titioners who have renounced domestic life. Nonetheless, I feel dissatisfied  
with this teacher’s answer.” With those thoughts, I left his place for good.

Again, King Ajātaśatru said to the Buddha:

On another occasion, I visited Nirgrantha Jñātiputra’s place and asked  
him the same question, “O virtuous one, just as we ride on an elephant,  
horse, or chariot and learn battlefield strategies and so on, other people  
carry on with the means of their livelihood and enjoy the fruits of their  
own happiness. Now can your followers, who are all engaged in the pursuit

of your path, acquire any results in this life like the satisfactions gained
by other people?”
That teacher replied, “O great king, I know all things, have insight into
all things, and I know all that is, without exception. Irrespective of whether
I am standing, sitting, or lying down, I am aware of all things without excep-
tion. All-inclusive (absolute) knowledge is present before me at all times.”
O World-honored One, suppose someone asks about a melon and the
other talks person about a plum, or when the former asks about a plum
and the latter replies in terms of a melon—that teacher’s reply was just
like that. When I asked him if those who practice his path acquire a certain
reward in this life, he answered by talking about his “all-inclusive knowl-
edge.” Again I thought to myself, “I am a kṣatriya, properly anointed to
kingship’s throne. Yet I [should refrain from] exercising my power to
arrest, exile, or execute any of these practitioners who have renounced
domestic life. Nonetheless, I feel dissatisfied with this teacher’s answer.”
With those thoughts, I left his place for good.
O World-honored One, because of these experiences, I have come with
the intent to ask Your Reverence the same question, namely, “Just as we
ride on an elephant, horse, or chariot and learn battlefield strategies and
so on, other people carry on with the means of their livelihood and enjoy
the fruits of their own happiness. Now do the śramaṇa s (disciples of the
Buddha) who are engaged in the pursuit of your path acquire rewards in
this life like the satisfactions gained by other people, sir?”
The Buddha said to King Ajātaśatru:
I would now like to ask Your Majesty a question. You may answer as you
please. What do you think, O great king? Suppose that on the night of the
full moon some of the boys and other workers in the royal household
observe the king having his hair washed and his body bathed and then
enjoying some entertainment together with the palace ladies in the royal
pavilion. One of them thinks, “What irony! After that affair^19 this is the
reward. Here is King Ajātaśatru, on the night of the full moon, having his
hair washed and his body bathed and gratifying all his senses with the
palace ladies in the pavilion. Who can ever know the reward that will fall
to one from his conduct?” Later on, that man shaves his hair, moustache,

and beard, puts on the three robes of a mendicant, renounces domestic  
life, and applies himself to the practice of equanimity (the principle of  
equality).  
Now, O great king, if you see this _bhikṣu_ approaching, do you think  
to yourself, “Well, isn’t this one of my former servants from the palace?”  
The king replied, “No, O World-honored One. If I see a monk approaching,  
I will stand to welcome him and ask him to take a seat alongside me.”  
The Buddha said, “Indeed, is that not a real reward that a _bhikṣu_ attains  
in this present life?”  
The king replied, “Exactly so, O World-honored One. That is a reward  
that comes from being a _śramaṇa_ .”  
Again, the Buddha said:  
O great king, some of the household guests who depend on the king’s  
munificence may have observed on the night of the full moon the king  
having his hair washed and his body bathed and then enjoying some enter-  
tainment together with the palace ladies in the royal pavilion. One of them  
may have thought, “What irony! After those events this is the reward.  
Who can ever know the reward that will fall to one from his conduct?”  
Later on, that guest shaves his hair, moustache, and beard, puts on the  
three robes of a mendicant, renounces domestic life, and applies himself  
to the practice of equanimity. Now, O great king, what do you think? If  
you see this _bhikṣu_ approaching, do you think to yourself, “Well, isn’t  
this one of my guests to whom I gave an allowance?”  
King Ajātaśatru replied, “No, O World-honored One. If I see a monk  
approaching, I will stand to welcome him with a bow and ask him to take a  
seat alongside me.”  
The Buddha said, “What does Your Majesty think? O great king, is that  
indeed not a real reward that a _bhikṣu_ attains in this present life?”  
The king replied, “Exactly so, O World-honored One. That is a reward  
that comes from being a _śramaṇa_ .”  
Again, the Buddha said:  
O great king, the Tathāgata appears in this world as one who is totally  
free from defilement and perfectly enlightened. Those who enter his path

should be able to acquire three kinds of supernormal knowledge^20 that  
annihilates ignorance and allows the illumination of insight, eliminating  
all forms of darkness and delusion to realize the total eradication of defile-  
ments and reveal the great light of the Dharma. How is this so? Because  
this fundamental realization can only be achieved through constant  
endeavor without any slackening, through freedom from all worldly men-  
tality, practice in seclusion, diligent mindfulness, and mental concentration.  
What does Your Majesty think? O great king, is that indeed not a real  
reward that a _bhikṣu_ attains in this present life?  
The king replied, “Exactly so, O World-honored One. That is a reward  
that comes from being a _śramaṇa_ .”  
Thereupon, King Ajātaśatru stood up, bowed his forehead to the ground  
at the Buddha’s feet, and said:

May I earnestly request that the World-honored One hear my repentance.  
I was insane—stupid, ignorant, and without any awareness of decency.  
My father, King Vidmisāra^21 of Magadha, ruled the country according to  
our laws and was always upright and impartial. But driven mad by the  
desires of the [five] senses, I murdered my father, the king. May Your  
Reverence, with compassion and pity, accept my earnest repentance.  
The Buddha said:  
Having been stupid, ignorant, and lacking any awareness of decency in  
the past, you murdered your father, the king, but now you have repented  
from the depth of your heart. According to the spiritual law of the wise  
and saintly disciples, if you have now thoroughly repented for what you  
have done, something beneficial will come to you. Because I have com-  
passion for you I will accept your repentance.  
At that, King Ajātaśatru venerated [by bowing to] the Buddha’s feet. He  
then withdrew to one side and took his seat. Thereupon, the Buddha gave  
him a discourse on the Dharma, imparting instruction, benefit, and delight.  
After hearing the discourse, the king said to the Buddha:  
Sir, I now take my refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. May Your  
Reverence accept me as a lay devotee in the right Dharma. From this

moment until the dissolution of my body at the end of life I will refrain  
from taking life, I will refrain from taking things that are not given, I will  
refrain from indulging in sexual pleasure, I will refrain from speaking  
falsehoods, and I will refrain from ingesting intoxicants.^22 May I earnestly  
request the World-honored One and the members of the sangha to unequiv-  
ocally accept my vow.  
The World-honored One remained silent for a moment, granting the king’s  
request. Seeing this, the king stood up, venerated the Buddha, circumambu-  
lated him three times, and returned to the palace.  
Not long after the king’s departure, the Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:  
King Ajātaśatru has atoned for his past transgressions and mitigated the  
burden of his sins. If the king had not murdered his father he could have  
acquired genuine insight ( _ārya-dharma-cakṣus-viśuddha_ ) into the nature  
of the Dharma. However, King Ajātaśatru has repented and has atoned  
for his grievous transgression.  
King Ajātaśatru, for his part, said to Prince Jīvaka on his way back to the  
palace:

It was good that you have served me so well. It was you who first told  
me about the Tathāgata’s teaching and then took me to meet him, and my  
mind has been opened. I am indebted to you and will not forget it.  
When the king reached the palace he ordered the preparation of various  
dishes of food and drink, and the next morning it was reported to the Buddha  
that the meal was ready. Thereupon, the World-honored One donned his outer  
robe and with almsbowl in hand visited the palace accompanied by one thou-  
sand two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s. Taking his seat in the place that had been  
prepared for him, the Buddha, together with the members of the sangha, was  
served by the king himself.  
At the conclusion of the meal, the bowls were cleaned and rinsing water was  
served. Then the king venerated the Buddha [by bowing to his] feet and said:

I have repented my past transgressions again and again, sir. I was insane—
stupid, ignorant, and without any awareness of decency. My father, King
Vidmisāra of Magadha, ruled the country according to our laws and was

always upright and impartial. But driven mad by the desires of the [five]  
senses, I murdered my father, the king. May Your Reverence, with com-  
passion and pity, accept my earnest repentance.  
The Buddha replied:  
Having been stupid, ignorant, and without any awareness of decency, you  
murdered your father, the king, but now you have repented from the depth  
of your heart. According to the spiritual law of the wise and saintly dis-  
ciples, if you have now thoroughly repented for what you have done,  
something beneficial will come to you. Because I have compassion for  
you I will accept your repentance.  
At that, King Ajātaśatru venerated the Buddha [by bowing to his] feet.  
Then he brought out a small cushion and seated himself before the Buddha.  
Thereupon, the Buddha gave him a discourse on the Dharma, imparting  
instruction, benefit, and delight.  
After hearing the discourse, the king again said to the Buddha:  
Once again, I take my refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. May  
Your Reverence accept me as a lay devotee in the right Dharma. From  
this moment until the dissolution of my body at the end of life I will refrain  
from taking life, I will refrain from taking things not given, I will refrain  
from indulging in sexual pleasure, I will refrain from speaking falsehoods,  
and I will refrain from ingesting intoxicants.  
After completing the teaching given for King Ajātaśatru, thus imparting  
instruction, benefit, and delight, the World-honored One stood up and left  
the palace. Having heard the Buddha’s teaching, King Ajātaśatru and the  
master of medicine, Prince Jīvaka, were delighted to receive it, and they rev-  
erentially carried out what the Buddha taught.
