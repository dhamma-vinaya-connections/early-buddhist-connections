### Sutra 6

### The Universal Ruler’s

### Practice

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 26: Cakkavati-sīhanāda Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was sojourning in the communities  
of the Mātulā country (in Magadha), and after a leisurely journey accompanied  
by one thousand two hundred and fifty disciples, he arrived at the country of  
Mātulā. At that time, the World-honored One said to his disciples:

The prince accepted all the instructions the king left for him. Thereupon,  
King Daḷhanemi shaved his hair and beard, donned the three robes,  
and renounced family life for the practice of the path. After seven days  
had passed since the king’s renunciation of household life, the golden  
wheel suddenly disappeared. The official in charge of the wheel reported  
this to the new king: “Your majesty, the golden wheel has suddenly  
disappeared, sir.” The king was not pleased and at once visited the [for-  
mer] king Daḷhanemi and said to him, “O father-king, the golden wheel  
has suddenly disappeared, sir.” Daḷhanemi replied to his son:

The son asked his father, the [former] king, “What is the right Dharma  
of the holy king _cakravartin_ , sir? O father-king, please tell me what I  
should do, sir.” The [former] king said to his son:

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

At that time, King Mahāsudarśana, having made a complete round  
of the four oceans following the golden wheel, educated the populace  
in the path of morality, provided security in their lives, and then returned  
to his own country. The golden wheel continued to hover in midair  
above the palace gate. Rejoicing by dancing and leaping, King Mahā-  
sudarśana said, “This treasure, the golden wheel, is truly my blessing.  
Now I am truly the universal ruler who turns this sacred wheel.” This  
is called the realization of the first treasure, the golden wheel. Since  
that time, the king ruled the continent for the full duration of his life.  
The golden wheel then suddenly shifted its position from where it  
had been before. The official in charge of the golden wheel at once  
reported this event to the king: “Your majesty, the golden wheel has  
now moved away from its usual position, sir.” Having heard this report,  
the king thought to himself:

Then the king at once summoned his prince and told him:

seizure by violence, and theft and robbery became more frequent than  
ever. Then an accuser, hoping to regain his possessions, brought a crim-  
inal before the king, asserting: “This man is a thief, sir. Please punish  
him.” The king questioned the [accused] man, “Did you really commit  
theft?” He replied, “Yes, sir. I am poor, destitute, and unable to survive.  
Hence, I could not help doing it, sir.” The king provided the man with  
some money from his treasury, admonishing him, “With this you should  
support your parents and rescue your family. From now on, do not  
commit theft.”  
Some of those who heard this story then deliberately committed  
theft, and the king also gave them money from his treasury. Thus, again,  
when someone was robbed of his possessions, in the hope of regaining  
his losses he brought the robber before the king, asserting, “This man  
robbed me, sir. Please, punish him.” The king questioned the accused,  
“Did you really commit robbery?” He replied, “Yes, sir. I am poor, des-  
titute, starved, and cannot otherwise survive, sir. I could not help it, sir.”  
The king then provided the man with some money from his treasury  
and admonished him, “With this, you should support your parents and  
rescue your family, and from now on do not commit robbery.”  
Having heard that the king gave money to a man who had committed  
robbery, some again openly plundered others’ possessions. Those who  
had been robbed, hoping to regain their losses, brought the criminals  
before the king, saying: “This man is a robber, sir. Please punish him.”  
The king questioned them, “Did you really commit robbery?” and they  
replied, “Yes, sir. I am poor, destitute, starved, and I could not otherwise  
survive, sir. I could not help it, sir.” The king, however, thought to himself:

beings were also engaged in robbery and theft. When an accuser brought  
a criminal before the king in the hope of regaining his lost possessions,  
and appealed to him, “This man robbed me, may the king punish him,”  
and the king then questioned the criminal, “Have you really robbed?”,  
the criminal replied, “No, sir.” Thus, the vice of speaking falsehoods  
arose in human society. At that time, because of poverty and destitution  
many sentient beings were engaged in criminal acts of robbery and  
theft. Because of robbery by bandits, there occurred armed conflict.  
Because of armed conflict, murders occurred; because of murders, the  
insatiable desire for material goods and sexual indulgence occurred;  
because of insatiable desire for material goods and passion for sexual  
indulgence, the vice of falsehood occurred; because of the vice of false-  
hood, human life span rapidly decreased down to one thousand years.  
During the period when the life span was one thousand years, three  
wrong verbal behaviors arose for the first time: deceptive speech, verbal  
abuse, and sycophancy, or flattering words. These wrong behaviors  
spread widely. As a result, the human life span was reduced to five  
hundred years of age. During the period when the life span was five  
hundred years, there arose three other wrongdoings: immoral sexual  
behavior, avarice, and erroneous views. These three wrong behaviors  
spread widely. As a result human longevity futher decreased to three  
or two hundred years. The present people of our age live only up to a  
hundred years of age, only a few people live beyond one hundred while  
the majority live less than that.  
In this manner, wrongdoings arose and spread without end and human  
life span decreased further, eventually down to ten years of age. During  
the period when human life span is ten years, only five months after birth  
a female would be of marriageable age. The society of this time would  
not know of items such as butter, cooking oil, molasses, raw sugar, or  
any foods of various sweet tastes. The rice grains or rice crop would turn  
to grass and weeds. Clothing made of silken fabric, silk brocade, twilled  
fabric, cotton, or white wool, all well known in the present age, would  
be unknown to those sentient beings. They would make only a rough  
woven cloth of woolen yarn for wrapping around their upper bodies.

shelter and finding someone who had survived, he would exclaim in  
joy, “You have not been killed!” and the two would rejoice and con-  
gratulate each other. Such joy may be compared to the parents’ joy  
when their child has been separated from them for some time but they  
finally find him and are reunited. The person in question would feel  
exactly like that, and [the survivors] would mutually congratulate each  
other. They would then return to their homes, only to find that many  
of their relations had died.  
Again, for seven days, they would cry in sorrow, wailing and mourn-  
ing. Having passed the initial seven days like this, upon meeting each  
other and other survivors, once again they would congratulate one  
another and enjoy and rejoice in their survival. They would then think  
to themselves, “Our accumulation of evil causes is extensive. Because  
of this, we have met the disaster of all our relations having died and  
our households reduced to nothing. Now we should practice good  
together. What kind of good deeds do we need to do? It must be the  
principle of not taking life.” At that time, all sentient beings would be  
determined to cherish friendly love and not kill each other. Under this  
circumstance, the life span of sentient beings would rapidly increase  
from ten to twenty years.  
The people of this period, whose life span is only twenty years, would  
think to themselves, “We have upheld the practice of good, namely not  
taking life, so our life spans have increased to twenty years. Now we  
should practice still more good. What kind of good should we practice?  
We have already upheld not killing, hence it should now be the principle  
of not stealing.” Having thus practiced the principle of not stealing,  
their life spans would be able to increase to forty years. The people of  
this period would then think to themselves, “Because of our practice  
of an additional good principle, we have been able to lengthen our life  
spans. Now we should increase the number of good principles again.  
What kind of good should we practice? It should be not to indulge in  
immoral sex.” Thus, whoever refrained entirely from wrong sexual con-  
duct would to have his life span extended to eighty years.  
The people of this period would then think to themselves, “Because  
of our practice of another good principle we have lengthened our life

The people of this period would then think to themselves, “Because  
of our practice of another good principle we have lengthened our life  
spans. Now we should increase the number of good principles. What  
kind of good should we practice? It should be not to insist on an erro-  
neous perception but to practice right perception.” Thus, whoever prac-  
ticed right perception and entirely refrained from erroneous perception  
would have their life span extended to twenty thousand years.  
The people of this period would then think to themselves, “Because  
of our practice of another good principle we have lengthened our life  
spans. Now we should increase the number of good principles. What  
kind of good should we practice? It should be to end three kinds of  
wrongdoings: immoral sex, immoral greed, and wrong views of life.”  
Thus, whoever entirely abandoned these three wrongdoings would have  
their life span extended to forty thousand years.  
The people of this period would then think to themselves, “Because  
of our practice of another good principle we have lengthened our life  
spans. Now we should increase the number of good principles. What  
kind of good should we practice? It should be to be filial to our parents  
and respectfully serve our teachers and elders.” Thus, whoever was  
filial to his parents and respectfully served his teachers and elders would  
have their life span extended to eighty thousand years.When the human  
life span increases to eighty thousand years, a woman would be married  
for the first time at the age of five hundred years.  
[Even though] at that time there would be nine causes of sickness  
for humans (cold, heat, hunger, thirst, excretion, urination, desire, cov-  
etousness, and aging), the ground would be smooth, even, and orderly  
with no ditches or pits, no barren hills or wastelands, no thorny trees  
or plants. There would not be any mosquitoes or gadflies, snakes or  
vipers, or poisonous insects, and clay, rocks, and gravel would turn to  
lapis lazuli. The population would increase and there would be no limit  
to the degree of bountiful produce of all kinds of crops for each member  
of society, even those of the lowest classes. At that time, eighty thousand  
large cities would be built. Since cities and villages would be close to  
one another the sound of the roosters crowing in the morning would  
be heard from one town to the next.

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

truth of] the path to the cessation of suffering. This is the _bhikṣu_ ’s real-  
ization of the power of authority.  
The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:  
I have observed all kinds of holders of supernormal power, but none  
of them surpasses the power of the Evil One [Māra]. Yet a _bhikṣu_ who  
has annihilated the influences of defilement has power that is superior  
to that of the Evil One.  
At that time, having listened to the Buddha’s exhortation, the _bhikṣu_ s  
rejoiced, respectfully received it, and carried it out.
