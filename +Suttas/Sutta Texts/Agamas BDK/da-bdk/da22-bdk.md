### One Who Cultivates Virtue

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 4: Soṇadaṇḍa Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. Once, when the Buddha was traveling through the com-  
munities of the country of Aṅga, accompanied by one thousand two hundred  
and fifty disciples, he stopped overnight by the bank of Queen Gaggarā’s  
lotus pond near the city of Campā.  
A _brāhmaṇa_ called Soṇadaṇḍa resided in Campā, a well-populated and  
prosperous city with abundant greenery. King Prasenajit [of Kauśala]^15 had  
granted the city to the _brāhmaṇa_ Soṇadaṇḍa as a fief, exempting it from tax-  
ation. This _brāhmaṇa_ had been born into a pure family line of seven gener-  
ations and had never been slighted by anyone in society. He was thoroughly  
versed in the three ancient collections of hymns (Vedas) and had detailed  
knowledge of the various _brāhmaṇa_ scriptures as well as a comprehensive  
command of the subtleties of secular literature. He was also well trained in  
reading the physiognomy of magnanimous personalities, in divining good  
and bad omens, and in conducting ceremonial proceedings and sacrificial  
rites. He had five hundred student disciples and never tired of teaching them.  
On this occasion, many of the _brāhmaṇa_ s and wealthy householders of  
the city were duly informed:

The śramaṇa Gautama, son of the Śākya clan, having renounced domestic
life and realized the ultimate goal of religion, has been traveling through
the communities of the country of Aṅga and has [now] reached the bank
of Queen Gaggarā’s lotus pond in the city of Campā. Gautama’s good
name is renowned and [his accomplishment] has been proclaimed every-
where, in all lands under the sky, as worthy of the ten supreme titles,
namely One Perfected in Practice (Tathāgata), One Liberated from Attach-
ment (Arhat), Perfectly Enlightened One (Samyak-saṃbuddha), and so
on. Among all the gods and humans, as well as all the evil ones and their
lord, and the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s too, he alone has directly experienced

the realization of enlightenment and has been teaching others [how to realize
that goal]. When he expounds on religion his words are good in the begin-
ning, good in the middle, and good in the end. All the words he utters are
invariably endowed with true meanings and real essences, and they are in
accord with his practice of pure and genuine austerity.
[Each of them was struck by the same thought:] “I too have heard that
we should visit this sage and pay our respects. I will go to see this man
together with the others.” Thereupon, all of the citizens, brāhmaṇa s and
wealthy householders alike, immediately departed to go to the place where
the Buddha was resting, [resulting in a great exodus from the city].
The brāhmaṇa Soṇadaṇḍa, observing from atop his high tower the passage
of a multitude of citizens [through the streets], asked his attendants, “Why
are all these people gathered together and where are they going?”
The attendants replied:
I have heard, sir: “The śramaṇa Gautama, son of the Śākya clan, having
renounced domestic life and realized the ultimate goal of religion, has
been traveling through the communities of the country of Aṅga and has
[now] reached the bank of Queen Gaggarā’s lotus pond in the city of
Campā. Gautama’s good name is renowned and [his accomplishment]
has been proclaimed everywhere, in all lands under the sky, as worthy of
the ten supreme titles, namely, One Perfected in Practice (Tathāgata), One
Liberated from Attachment (Arhat), Perfectly Enlightened One (Samyak-
saṃbuddha), and so on. Among all the gods and humans, as well as all
the evil ones and their lord, and the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s too, he
alone has directly experienced the realization of enlightenment. When he
expounds on religion his words are good in the beginning, good in the
middle, and good in the end. All the words he utters are invariably endowed
with true meanings and real essences, and they are in accord with his pure
and genuine practice of austerity.”
The brāhmaṇa s and wealthy householders all wish to see the śramaṇa
Gautama and pay him their respects. The crowds are nothing other than the
procession of those who wish to go see the śramaṇa Gautama, sir.
The brāhmaṇa then instructed his attendants: “Go quickly and carry my

message to the people. Tell them: ‘Gentlemen, please wait for a moment  
while I come to join you. Let us all go together to Gautama’s resting place.’”  
One of the attendants immediately went out and said to the people: “Good  
people, please wait for a moment for [the _brāhmaṇa_ Soṇadaṇḍa] to join you.  
He wishes to accompany you to Gautama’s resting place.”  
The townspeople responded to the attendant: “Please return quickly to  
the _brāhmaṇa_ and tell him: ‘The most auspicious moment is at hand. Let us  
[now] go together.’”  
The attendant returned and reported: “The people are waiting, sir. They  
say, ‘The most auspicious moment is at hand. Let us [now] go together.’”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ Soṇadaṇḍa right away descended from the high tower and  
went to the middle gate. It so happened that his five hundred students had  
gathered at the gate, attending to a minor matter. Seeing their [teacher] _brāh-  
maṇa_ Soṇadaṇḍa approaching, they stood up in unison and greeted him, “O  
great _brāhmaṇa_ , where are you going, sir?”  
Soṇadaṇḍa replied:  
The _śramaṇa_ Gautama, son of the Śākya clan, is here. Having renounced  
domestic life and realized the ultimate goal of religion, he has been trav-  
eling through the communities of the country of Aṅga and has [now]  
reached the bank of Queen Gaggarā’s lotus pond in the city of Campā.  
Gautama’s good name is renowned and [his accomplishment] has been  
proclaimed everywhere, in all lands under the sky, as worthy of the ten  
supreme titles, namely, One Perfected in Practice (Tathāgata), One Lib-  
erated from Attachment (Arhat), Perfectly Enlightened One (Samyak-  
saṃbuddha), and so on. Among all the gods and humans, as well as all  
the evil ones and their lord, and the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s too, he  
alone has directly experienced the realization of enlightenment. When he  
expounds on religion his words are good in the beginning, good in the  
middle, and good in the end. All the words he utters are invariably endowed  
with true meanings and real essences, and they are in accord with his pure  
and genuine practice of asuterity. Everyone should go to see this sage,  
and I too wish to visit the _śramaṇa_ Gautama and pay my respects.  
The five hundred student disciples then spoke to Soṇadaṇḍa, advising  
him:

May you not be so bold as to visit him. Why? Sir, he will come here
instead, and so Your Reverence need not go to him.
A great brāhmaṇa like Your Reverence, who comes from a line of pure
parentage of seven generations, should never be slighted by anyone in
society. If you uphold [the prestige of] your pure family line, [the śramaṇa
Gautama] will [eventually] come to see you, sir. Therefore, Your Reverence
should not go to him.
Moreover, your greatness as a brāhmaṇa is well established: you are
thoroughly versed in the three ancient collections of hymns (Vedas) and
have detailed knowledge of the various brāhmaṇa scriptures, as well as
a comprehensive command of the subtleties of secular literature. Your
Reverence is also well trained in reading the physiognomy of magnanimous
personalities, in divining good and bad omens, and in conducting cere-
monial proceedings and sacrificial rites. If you uphold [the preeminence
of] one who possesses such [extraordinary] abilities, [the śramaṇa Gau-
tama] will [eventually] come to see you, sir. Hence, Your Reverence should
not go to him.
Again, your greatness as a brāhmaṇa is reflected in your handsome
countenance, which bears the likeness and coloring of the god Brahmā.
If you uphold [the prestige of] this [extraordinary] likeness, [the śramaṇa
Gautama] will [eventually] come to see you, sir. Hence, Your Reverence
should not go to him.
Again, your greatness as a brāhmaṇa is proven by the fine moral quality
of your ever-increasing virtues and store of acquired wisdom. If you main-
tain [the dignity inherent in] this [extraordinary] achievement, [the śramaṇa
Gautama] will [eventually] come to see you, sir. Hence, Your Reverence
should not go to him.
Again, your greatness as a brāhmaṇa is apparent in your gentle manner
of speech and you are endowed with the highest rhetorical skill, as every
word is imbued with pure and genuine meanings and essences. If you rest
in [the propriety flowing from] this [extraordinary] ability, [the śramaṇa
Gautama] will [eventually] come to see you, sir. Hence, Your Reverence
should not go to him.
Again, your greatness as a brāhmaṇa is evidenced in your position as a
great master with many disciple followers. If you affirm this [extraordinary]

attainment, [the _śramaṇa_ Gautama] will [eventually] come to see you,  
sir. Hence, Your Reverence should not go to him.  
Again, your greatness as a _brāhmaṇa_ is shown in your ability to teach  
five hundred students at all times. If you affirm this [extraordinary] quality,  
[the _śramaṇa_ Gautama] will [eventually] come to see you, sir. Hence,  
Your Reverence should not go to him.  
Again, your greatness as a _brāhmaṇa_ is reflected in your capacity to  
give consultation to scholars seeking it from all quarters of the continent,  
and to provide them with clear, detailed answers to questions about sac-  
rificial rites and proceedings. If you affirm this [extraordinary] quality,  
[the _śramaṇa_ Gautama] will [eventually] come to see you, sir. Hence,  
Your Reverence should not go to him.  
Again, your greatness as a _brāhmaṇa_ is reflected in the respect and  
recognition accorded you by both King Prasenajit (of Kauśala) and King  
Bimbisāra (of Magadha). If you uphold [the status conveyed by] these  
[extraordinary] honors, [the _śramaṇa_ Gautama] will [eventually] come  
to see you, sir. Hence, Your Reverence should not go to him.  
Again, your greatness as a _brāhmaṇa_ is confirmed by your wealth and  
your storehouses filled with treasure. If you maintain [the standing of]  
one so [extraordinarily] endowed with wealth, [the _śramaṇa_ Gautama]  
will [eventually] come to see you, sir. Hence, Your Reverence should not  
go to him.  
Again, your greatness as a _brāhmaṇa_ is revealed in your intelligence;  
you possess complete understanding and command the power of univer-  
sally beneficial speech that is totally free from inconsistency. If you rest  
on [the preeminence given by] this [extraordinary] quality, [the _śramaṇa_  
Gautama] will [eventually] come to see you, sir. Hence, Your Reverence  
should not go to him.

Soṇadaṇḍa then replied:

Yes, it is as you have said. What you have just said is indeed correct. I do  
possess the qualities you have enumerated; I do not deny it. Listen to me,  
however. [You should know that] the _śramaṇa_ Gautama is replete with  
every [excellent] meritorious virtue, and also that I should go to him; he  
will not come to see us here.

The śramaṇa Gautama was born into a line of pure parentage of seven
generations, which must not be slighted by anyone in society. Since he is
from such a pure family, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama was born into a kṣatriya family and has
a handsome appearance. As he is marked by this excellence, I should go
to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama was born into a noble family, but having
renounced his worldly fortune he has realized the ultimate goal of religion.
Since he has realized this goal, I should go to him; he will not come to
see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama, born from a pure family line and
endowed with a fair, bright complexion, has renounced domestic life and
engaged in religious practice. Since he has decisively taken up the path
of religion, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama was born into a wealthy and privileged
family, yet despite the strength of that position, he has renounced domestic
life and realized the goal of religious practice. Since he has realized this
goal, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama is endowed with all [moral and spiritual]
precepts ( śīlavant ārya-śīlin kuśala-śilena samannāgata ) and has attained
the perfection of transcendental insight. Since he has realized this excel-
lence, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama is skilled in the use of appropriate language
and [his manner] is gentle, harmonious, and refined. Since he has realized
this excellence, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama is a teacher of teachers and has a multitude
of disciples ( bahūnām ācārya-prācarya ). Since he has realized this excel-
lence, we should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama has [thoroughly] terminated all desires
and passions with no inconstancy whatsoever ( kṣīṇa-kāma-rāga-vigata-
cāpalya ). Having eradicated all anxiety and fear, his bearing is neither stiff
nor artificial but pleasingly harmonious and delightful. He praises the good-
ness in others, teaches the principle of moral retribution ( karma-vādin kriyā-
vādin ), and honors [the practice of] non-harm (Pāli apāpa-purekkhāra ).

Since he has realized this excellence, I should go to him; he will not come  
to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama is respected, adored, given offerings,  
and shown tender concern by King Prasenajit and King Bimbisāra. Since  
he has been accorded this status, I should go to him; he will not come to  
see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama is respected, adored, given offerings,  
and shown tender concern by the _brāhmaṇa_ Puṣkarasvādi (Pokkharasādi),  
and also by _brāhmaṇa_ s such as Brahmā, Tārukkha, Kūṭadanta, and Suka -  
māṇa vatodeyya. Since he has attained this eminence, I should go to him;  
he will not come to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama is revered, respected, adored, given offer-  
ings, and shown tender concern not only by the saintly disciples ( _śrāvaka-  
antevāsika_ ) but also by the gods and other legions of spirits, and is followed  
with devotion by clanspeople from the Śākya, Kaulya, Uttarakā, Vṛji,  
Malla, and Somanā clans. Since he has attained this eminence, we should  
go to him; he will not come to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama convinced both King Prasenajit and King  
Bimbisāra to receive lay ordination by taking refuge in the Three Treasures  
(Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha) and adhering to the five moral precepts.  
Since he has attained this distinction, I should go to him; he will not come  
to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama convinced the _brāhmaṇa_ Puṣkarasvādi  
and others to receive lay ordination by taking refuge in the Three Treasures  
and adhering to the five moral precepts. Since he has attained this distinc-  
tion, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama not only granted his disciples the higher  
ordination that consists of taking refuge in the Three Treasures and adhering  
to the five precepts, but also offered the invariable refuge of the Three  
Treasures and the five precepts to the gods, to the Śākya and Kaulya clans-  
people, and so on. Since he has attained this distinction, I should go to  
him; he will not come to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama, whenever and wherever he is traveling  
through our communities, has always been respected, given offerings,

and shown tender concern by all the people. Since he has attained this
distinction, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama, in whatever town or village he happens
to visit, is always respected, given offerings, and shown tender concern
by the townspeople and villagers. Since he has attained this distinction,
I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama, wherever he travels, has never been dis-
turbed by nonhuman spirits. Since he is constantly accompanied by this
miracle, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama, wherever he happens to be, empowers
the people of that locality to perceive a heavenly radiance and hear celestial
music. Since he is always accompanied by this miracle, I should go to
him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama, wherever he sojourns on his travels,
invariably endears himself to the people so that when he departs they
weep when parting from him, wishing that he would stay longer. Since
he has always endeared himself to everyone, I should go to him; he will
not come to see us here.
Again, when the śramaṇa Gautama first renounced domestic life, his
loving father and mother were brought to tears and they grieved bitterly at
his departure and yearned for him to return. Because he has attained the
goal of his renunciation, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama, on renouncing domestic life, cast away
all his jewelry, elephants, horses, chariots, and every object of gratification
for the five senses even though he was in the youthful prime of life. Since
he has fulfilled the path of renunciation, I should go to him; he will not
come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama abandoned the throne of universal kingship
( cakravartin ) to enter religious practice. Had he pursued the life of a house-
holder he would have reigned over the four quarters of the earth as the
sovereign of all people and all worldly things, and we all would have been
his subjects. Since he has fulfilled the path of religion [instead of that other
path of glory,] I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.
Again, the śramaṇa Gautama thoroughly understands the reforming
principle of excommunication ( fanfa; brahmādaṇḍa ) as practiced in

Brahmā Heaven; he communicates with Brahmā and commends the effi-  
cacy of this principle to others. Since he has attained this distinction, I  
should go to him; he will not come to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama is endowed with the thirty-two eminent  
marks of a great person without exception. Since he is endowed with all  
these excellent marks, I should go to him; he will not come to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama possesses the penetrating intelligence  
of complete understanding and is totally free from any mental unsteadiness.  
Since he is endowed with this distinction, I should go to him; he will not  
come to see us here.  
Again, the _śramaṇa_ Gautama has just now arrived on the bank of Queen  
Gaggarā’s lotus pond. He is the Honored One for me and a cherished guest  
[of this region]. I should go to him to form a close association.  
The five hundred students then said to Soṇadaṇḍa:  
This is truly marvelous—indeed, truly marvelous, sir! Can [the _śramaṇa_  
Gautama] possess all of the meritorious virtues? If he possessed just one  
of them, he could not be expected to come to us. How much less could  
he be expected to come to us when he is so fully endowed with every dis-  
tinction! Will Your Reverence allow us to accompany you to greet the  
Tathāgata?  
Soṇadaṇḍa replied, “If you wish, now is the time to come along with me.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ ’s carriage was prepared and, surrounded by his five hundred  
students and the _brāhmaṇa_ s and householders of the city of Campā, he jour-  
neyed to Queen Gaggarā’s [lotus] pond.  
Not far from the pond, Soṇadaṇḍa thought to himself:  
If I ask Gautama something, I could be admonished if my question is  
inappropriate and counter to the way he thinks. He may say, “You should  
ask me that question in this way, and not like that.” Those who are in  
attendance on this occasion will then surely think of me as ignorant and  
my reputation will be damaged. If the _śramaṇa_ Gautama asks me a question  
about the meaning of my doctrines and my answer does not appear to  
conform to his thinking, he may say, “You should reply in this manner,  
and not like that.” Those who are in attendance on this occasion will then

surely think of me as ignorant and my reputation will be damaged. Yet if
I return from this occasion without exchanging any words with Gautama,
those who have accompanied me may say, “The [ brāhmaṇa Soṇadaṇḍa]
has little knowledge. He did not dare to exchange words with the śramaṇa
Gautama.” My reputation will thus be damaged. If, however, the śramaṇa
Gautama should ask me about the meritorious virtues that brāhmaṇa s are
obliged to fulfill, then I can answer in a way that I hope will be in accord
with his line of inquiry.”
Having run through these thoughts while approaching Queen Gaggarā’s
[lotus] pond, the brāhmaṇa dismounted from his carriage and went on foot
to the resting place of the World-honored One, where he bowed and took a
seat to one side. The brāhmaṇa s and householders of Campā also sat down,
some of them venerating the Buddha before doing so. Some greeted him
with a bow, while others called out their names or simply joined their palms
together to pay their respects, quietly without a word.
When they had all settled in their seats, the Buddha at once knew the mind
of the brāhmaṇa Soṇadaṇḍa and said to him, “What you have thought is in
accordance with your wish.”
The Buddha then asked Soṇadaṇḍa:
O brāhmaṇa, how many meritorious virtues must you, as a brāhmaṇa ,
be endowed with so that whatever a brāhmaṇa such as yourself may say
is said with utmost sincerity, involving no falsehood?
At that moment, Soṇadaṇḍa thought to himself:
Quite marvelous—indeed, marvelous! The śramaṇa Gautama evidently
has the great supernormal power of reading the minds of others as easily
as I know my own thoughts: he has put a question about exactly what I
wish to be asked about!
[Soṇadaṇḍa] then assumed a correct posture and, looking out over the
audience with a smile, replied to the Buddha:
As a brāhmaṇa I have fulfilled the five meritorious virtues, so whatever
I say is spoken with utmost sincerity, involving no falsehood, sir. What
are these five virtues? First, a brāhmaṇa must be from a pure family line

of seven generations, and must not be slighted by anyone in society. Sec-  
ond, he should be thoroughly versed in the three ancient collections of  
hymns (Vedas) and have detailed knowledge of the various _brāhmaṇa_  
scriptures as well as a comprehensive command of the subtleties of secular  
literature; moreover, he should be well trained in reading the physiognomy  
of magnanimous personalities, in divining good and bad omens, and in  
conducting ceremonial proceedings and sacrificial rites. Third, he should  
be endowed with a handsome countenance [with a fair and bright com-  
plexion]. Fourth, he should uphold perfect adherence to the moral precepts.  
Fifth, he should possess the wisdom of complete understanding. These  
are the five meritorious virtues. O Gautama, a _brāhmaṇa_ must be endowed  
with these five meritorious virtues so that whatever he says is spoken with  
utmost sincerity, involving no falsehood, sir.

The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa_ :

Very good, O _brāhmaṇa_. [Now] of these five virtues, can someone who  
has accomplished four of them while not fulfilling one still be called a  
[true] _brāhmaṇa,_ such that whatever he says is spoken with utmost sin-  
cerity, involving no falsehood?

The _brāhmaṇa_ Soṇadaṇḍa replied:

Yes, sir. Why? O Gautama, a _brāhmaṇa_ is not required to fulfill any condition  
related to the lineage of his birth. One who fulfills the remaining four [virtues]  
can be called a [true] _brāhmaṇa_ , and whatever he says is spoken with utmost  
sincerity, involving no falsehood. [First,] such a _brāhmaṇa_ must be thor-  
oughly versed in the three ancient collections of hymns (Vedas) and possess  
detailed knowledge of the various _brāhmaṇa_ scriptures as well as a com-  
prehensive command of the subtleties of secular literature; he must also be  
well trained in reading the physiognomy of magnanimous personalities, in  
divining good and bad omens, and in conducting ceremonial proceedings  
and sacrificial rites. [Second,] such a _brāhmaṇa_ must be endowed with a  
handsome countenance [with a fair and bright complexion]. [Third,] such  
a _brāhmaṇa_ must uphold perfect adherence to the moral precepts. [Fourth,]  
such a _brāhmaṇa_ must possess the wisdom of complete understanding.

The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa_ Soṇadaṇḍa:  
Very good. [Now] of those [remaining] four virtues, can one who has  
accomplished three of them while not fulfilling one still be called a [true]  
_brāhmaṇa,_ such that whatever he says is spoken with utmost sincerity,  
involving no falsehood?  
The _brāhmaṇa_ Soṇadaṇḍa replied:  
Yes, sir. Why? O Gautama, just as a _brāhmaṇa_ is not required to fulfill  
any condition of lineage related to his birth, he also is not required to  
fulfill any condition related to various forms of chanting. One who fulfills  
the remaining three [virtues] may be called a [true] _brāhmaṇa,_ and what-  
ever he says is spoken with utmost sincerity, involving no falsehood.  
[First,] such a _brāhmaṇa_ must be endowed with a handsome countenance,  
[with a fair and bright complexion]. [Second,] such a _brāhmaṇa_ must  
uphold perfect adherence to the moral precepts. [Third,] such a _brāhmaṇa_  
must possess the wisdom of complete understanding.  
The Buddha continued:  
Very good. [Now] of these three virtues, can one who has accomplished two  
of them while not fulfilling one still be called a [true] _brāhmaṇa,_ such that  
whatever he says is spoken with utmost sincerity, involving no falsehood?  
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied:  
Yes, sir. Why? O Gautama, just as a _brāhmaṇa_ is not required to fulfill  
any conditions related to his birth lineage or to various forms of chanting,  
he also need not fulfill the condition requiring a handsome countenance  
with a fair complexion.  
At that moment, the five hundred _brāhmaṇa_ students shouted out in protest  
to Soṇadaṇḍa:

Why does Your Reverence cast aside fulfillment of the conditions of birth
[from pure lineage], of [proficiency in scriptural] chanting, and of pos-
sessing physical attractiveness [due to heredity]?
At once, the World-honored One said to them:

If the _brāhmaṇa_ Soṇadaṇḍa, your teacher, was unbecoming in his facial  
features, if he came from a humble family background and was unable to  
chant the scriptures, or speak intelligently and eloquently, and hence  
unable to exchange words with me, then you could speak out [on his  
behalf]. If, however, Soṇadaṇḍa does have a handsome countenance,  
comes from an appropriate family background, and is not only proficient  
in chanting scriptures but also able to exchange arguments intelligently  
and eloquently, and capable of engaging in debate with me, you should  
remain silent and listen to what he says.  
At that moment, the _brāhmaṇa_ Soṇadaṇḍa said to the Buddha, “May I  
request, O Gautama, that you not press [my disciples] for a moment. I shall  
teach them myself.” Soṇadaṇḍa then asked the five hundred _brāhmaṇa_ s:

Aṅgamāṇava is among this multitude of students, like yourselves. He is  
one of my nephews from my wife’s side. Do you all see how handsome  
he is? With the singular exception of the World-honored One, [whose  
noble appearance is beyond comparison,] there is no one in this assembly  
whose attractiveness can match that of this young fellow Aṅgamāṇava.  
Yet he is a moral degenerate—he commits murder, theft, and sexual abuse;  
he is rude and engages in falsehood and deceit. He has committed evil by  
transgressing norms and has murdered people by burning them with fire.  
O _brāhmaṇa_ s, this man Aṅgamāṇava concentrates within himself all evils.  
So even though he is capable and proficient in chanting scriptures, of what  
use is that?  
The five hundred _brāhmaṇa_ s remained silent, [raising no objections].  
Soṇadaṇḍa then said to the Buddha:

Sir, with one who upholds perfect adherence to the moral precepts and
also possesses the wisdom of complete understanding, whatever he says
is spoken with utmost sincerity, involving no falsehood. Such a person
can be called a [true] brāhmaṇa, sir.
The Buddha said:
Very good. How do you reply [now], O Soṇadaṇḍa? If one of the two
virtues is not fulfilled but the other is perfected, and if whatever is said

is spoken with utmost sincerity, involving no falsehood, can such a person  
be called a [true] _brāhmaṇa_?  
Soṇadaṇḍa replied:  
No, sir. Why? Perfect moral discipline is wisdom, and wisdom means the  
perfection of moral conduct. He who has perfected adherence to the moral  
precepts is in possession of wisdom. As a result, whatever he says is  
spoken with utmost sincerity, involving no falsehood. Thus I assert that  
such a person is a [true] _brāhmaṇa,_ sir.  
The Buddha said:  
Very good. It is exactly as you have said. One who is endowed with moral  
perfection is endowed with wisdom; one who possesses wisdom is morally  
perfect. Moral discipline can purify wisdom, and vice versa. O Soṇadaṇḍa,  
just as all people use both hands when they wash their hands, so is it with  
moral discipline and wisdom. With the left hand, one cleans the right  
hand; with the right hand, one cleans the left hand. It is the same with  
wisdom and moral discipline. One who possesses wisdom is also endowed  
with moral discipline; one who is morally disciplined also possesses wis-  
dom. Moral discipline can purify and perfect wisdom, and perfect wisdom  
can purify and perfect moral discipline. O _brāhmaṇa,_ one who possesses  
both moral discipline and wisdom, I call that person a _bhikṣu_.  
Soṇadaṇḍa then said to the Buddha, “What are the moral precepts [to  
which you refer], sir?”  
The Buddha said, “Listen carefully and keep in mind what I explain. I  
shall explain each one analytically.”  
Soṇadaṇḍa replied, “Yes, sir. This is what I have come to hear.”  
The World-honored One then said to the _brāhmaṇa_ :  
When the Tathāgata appears in this world, he bears the [ten] epithets of  
(1) One Liberated from Attachment, (2) Perfectly Enlightened One, (3)  
One Harmoniously Endowed with Insight and Practice, (4) Well-gone  
One (who will not be reborn into the cycles of rebirth), (5) Knower of the  
World, (6) Unrivaled Leader, (7) Trainer of Human Devotion, (8) Teacher  
of Gods and Humans, (9) Enlightened One, and (10) World-honored One.

Among all the gods and humans, and the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s too,  
he alone has directly experienced the realization of enlightenment and  
teaches others [how to realize it]. [When he expounds on religion] his  
words are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end.  
All the words he utters are invariably endowed with true meanings and  
real essences, and they are in accord with his pure and genuine practice  
of austerity.  
When householders and their offspring listen to the right Dharma, they  
will be motivated to give rise to pure and genuine tranquil faith [in the  
Tathāgata]. Having given rise to faith [in the Tathāgata], they will reflect  
upon their lives:  
The life of a householder is not easy, it is [like being bound in] a rack  
of chains. Even as I wish to pursue the path of austerity, I cannot be  
free [as long as I am bound to a householder’s life]. I should now shave  
my hair and beard, don the three robes of a mendicant, and renounce  
domestic life for religious practice.  
Later, such a person may abandon his household and wealth, dissociate  
himself from his family and relations, shave his hair and beard, and don  
the three robes. Casting aside all finery, chanting the precepts and disci-  
plines in the Vinaya texts, adhering to the rule of abstaining from taking  
life, and so on, even up to the realization of the fourth meditative state  
of absorption, he may thereby acquire supreme bliss. How is this so?  
This realization is only possible through a sustained effort of concentration,  
comprising constant mindfulness of enjoying practice as a recluse. O  
_brāhmaṇa,_ this is regarded as the endowment of the higher ordination  
consisting of adherence to the Vinaya precepts and disciplines.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ then asked, “What is the wisdom [to which Your Reverence  
refers], sir?”  
The Buddha replied:  
When a _bhikṣu_ realizes a pure and genuine state of mental concentration  
that is gentle, well controlled, able to abide in immovability, and so on,  
it opens up three kinds of supernormal powers: knowledge of past lives,  
knowledge of future destinies, and the eradication of defilements. It thus

terminates the state of ignorance, causing insight to arise together with  
the light of wisdom, the eradication of darkness, and the supreme illumi-  
nation—all by going beyond the insight gained from the eradication of  
defilement. How is this so? This realization is only possible through a  
sustained effort of concentration, comprising constant mindfulness of  
one’s point of observation and the acquisition of a state of equanimity  
accompanied by an increasingly subtle sense of bliss. O _brāhmaṇa,_ this  
is regarded as the endowment of perfect knowledge of the Vinaya precepts  
and disciplines.  
Thereupon, the _brāhmaṇa_ Soṇadaṇḍa said to the Buddha:  
Now I am resolved to take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and the holy  
_bhikṣu_ s’ Sangha. I earnestly request to be permitted to become a lay  
devotee in the right Dharma. From this moment until the dissolution of  
the body and end of life, I will uphold the five precepts, refraining from  
taking life, refraining from taking what is not given, refraining from  
immoral sexual conduct, refraining from speaking falsehoods, and refrain-  
ing from ingesting intoxicants.  
Having heard the Buddha’s teaching, the _brāhmaṇa_ Soṇadaṇḍa was  
delighted to receive it and carried it out as taught by the Buddha.
