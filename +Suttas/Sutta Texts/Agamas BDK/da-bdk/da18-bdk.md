### Happiness Caused by Oneself

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 28: Sampasādanīya Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was staying in the town of Nālandā  
in the Pāvārika’s Mango Forest accompanied by one thousand two hundred  
and fifty disciples. The venerable elder Śāriputra, engaged in meditation in  
a secluded place, thought:

My mind has become settled with the knowledge that throughout the  
past, present, and future there is no _śramaṇa_ or _brāhmaṇa_ whose wisdom,  
supernormal power, and meritorious virtues can equal those of the Tathā-  
gata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One ( _samyaksaṃbuddha_ ).  
Śāriputra then stood up from his meditation and went to see the World-  
honored One. Having honored the Buddha by bowing his forehead to his  
feet, Śāriputra withdrew to one side and took his seat. He said to the Buddha:

A short while ago, when I was engaged in meditation in a secluded place,
it came to my mind that throughout the past, present, and future there
is no śramaṇa or brāhmaṇa whose wisdom, supernormal power, and
meritorious virtues can equal those of the Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly
Enlightened One.
The Buddha then said to Śāriputra:
Very good, you are able to speak [frankly] of your thought before me,
firmly settled with unshakable conviction, and thereby you are able to
make the lion’s roar like this. Among all the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s
there is no one who can ever match your capacity. What do you think,
O Śāriputra? Do you know what thoughts the past buddhas had in their
minds, what moral disciplines they practiced, what doctrines they upheld,
what transcendent insight they had, what liberation they realized, and
in what state of liberation they abided?

Śāriputra replied, “No, sir.”
[The Buddha continued:]
What do you think, O Śāriputra? Do you know what thoughts the future
buddhas will have in their minds, what moral disciplines they will prac-
tice, what doctrines they will uphold, what transcendent insight they
will have, what liberation they will realize, and in what state of liberation
they will abide?
Śāriputra replied, “No, sir.”
[The Buddha again continued:]
What do you think, O Śāriputra? Do you know what thoughts the present
buddha has in his mind, what moral disciplines he practices, what doc-
trines he upholds, what transcendent insight he has, what liberation he
has realized, and in what state of liberation he abides?
Śāriputra replied, “No, sir.”
Again, the Buddha said to Śāriputra:
You cannot know what thoughts the past, present, and future buddhas
had, has, and will have, respectively, in their minds. On the basis of what
reason have you decisively become settled with such a thought in your
mind? In reference to what fact have you reached such an unshakable
conviction, whereby you are able to make such a lion’s roar like that?
When all the other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s hear your announcement,
“My mind has become settled with the knowledge that throughout the
past, present, and future there is no śramaṇa or brāhmaṇa whose wisdom,
supernormal power, and meritorious virtues can equal those of the Tathā-
gata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One,” they will not believe your words.
Śāriputra said to the Buddha:
Although I am unable to know what thoughts the past, present, and future
buddhas had, has and will have in their minds, I know the general char-
acteristics of the Buddha. The Tathāgata has taught me the Dharma of
profundity and vastness that is concerned with good and bad, with [the
workings] of causality and its absence, illumination [with insight] and

its absence, [ignorance], and I know that the Tathāgata’s exhortation is  
profound and vast. Having listened to the discourse, I have known each  
subject of the contents and have thoroughly investigated them all. I  
believe in the Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One; I believe  
that the Dharma exhorted by the Tathāgata is thoroughly analyzable;  
and that the Tathāgata has [truly] realized cessation of the multitude of  
sufferings. These are the highest truths among all good doctrines. The  
knowledge and insight inparted by the World-honored One are compre-  
hensive, and his supernormal powers are all-inclusive. Therefore, among  
all the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s of this world, there is none who can  
ever equal the World-honored One. How could any of them ever so igno-  
miniously wish to be superior to the World-honored One?  
Again, there is another superior quality of the exhortation of the  
World-honored One, namely, revealing the disciplines. These disciplines  
constitute (1) the four kinds of application of mental awareness, (2) the  
four kinds of strenuous effort, (3) the four kinds of supernormal powers,  
(4) the four kinds of meditative absorption, (5) the five kinds of spiritual  
faculties, (6) the five kinds of spiritual power, (7) the seven auxiliary  
disciplines of enlightenment, and (8) the eightfold noble path. These are  
called the highest methods of practice. The World-honored One’s knowl-  
edge and insight are comprehensive and his supernormal powers are all-  
inclusive. Therefore, among all the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s of this  
world there is none who can equal the World-honored One. How much  
less could any of them ever so ignominiously wish to be superior to the  
World-honored One?  
Again, there is another superior quality of World-honored One’s  
exhortation, namely, revealing the cognitive bases ( _āyatana_ s). The epis-  
temic bases mean the eyes and forms, the ears and sounds, the nose and  
smells, the tongue and tastes, the body and tactile sensation, and the  
intellect and elements. The Tathāgatas, Arhats, Perfectly Enlightened  
Ones of the past equally made these epistemic bases known, namely,  
the visual faculty and objective forms, and so on, up to the intellectual  
faculty and objective elements. The Tathāgatas, Arhats, Perfectly Enlight-  
ened Ones of the future too will be obliged to equally make these epis-  
temic bases known, namely, the visual faculty and objective forms, and

so on, up to the intellectual faculty and objective elements. The Tathāgata,
Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One of the present time, who is my master,
has also equally made these epistemic bases known, namely, the visual
faculty and objective forms, and so on, up to the intellectual faculty and
objective elements. No one can surpass the Tathāgata in revealing these
epistemic bases. His knowledge and insight are comprehensive and his
supernormal powers are all-inclusive. Therefore, among all the śramaṇa s
and brāhmaṇa s of this world, there is none who can ever equal the World-
honored One. How much less could any of them ever so ignominiously
wish to be superior to the World-honored One?
Again, there is another superior quality of the World-honored One,’s
exhortation, namely, revealing the way of descending into the mother’s
womb [at the time of rebirth] with awareness. The descent into the
mother’s womb comprises four kinds: (1) entering the womb, abiding
in it, and coming out of it, all without awareness; (2) entering the womb
with awareness, but abiding in it and coming out of it without awareness;
(3) entering the womb and abiding in it with awareness, but coming out
of it without awareness; and (4) entering the womb, abiding in it, and
coming out of it, all with awareness. Of these four, the fourth is the high-
est, [as in the case of the Tathāgata], unsurpassed by any other being.
The World-honored One’s knowledge and insight are comprehensive
and his supernormal powers are all-inclusive. Therefore, among all the
śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s of this world there is none who can equal the
World-honored One. How much less could any of them ever so igno-
miniously wish to be superior to the World-honored One?
Again, there is another superior quality of the World-honored One’s
exhortation, namely, revealing the path of religion [consisting of four
motivations]. The śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s enter the state of mental
concentration through various methods, and while abiding in that state
they apply the seven auxiliary disciplines of enlightenment in practice,
starting with the four kinds of mindfulness or mental awareness, according
to four motivations: (1) desire for realization, (2) riddance from worldly
affairs, (3) cessation of defilements, and (4) deliverance from the samsaric
life cycle. In like manner, they strive in the practices of discernment of
the psychophysical elements, endeavor, delight, freedom from bodily

and mental disturbance, the practice of concentration, and the mind of
equanimity according to the above four motivations. These motivations
are [the most effective], unsurpassed [by any other principle]. The World-
honored One’s knowledge and insight are comprehensive and his super-
normal powers are all-inclusive. Therefore, among all the śramaṇa s and
brāhmaṇa s of this world, there is none who can equal the World-honored
One. How much less could any of them ever so ignominiously wish to
be superior to the World-honored One?
Again, there is another superior quality in the World-honored One’s
exhortation, namely, revealing the process or method of cessation. The
process of cessation is of four kinds: (1) gradual realization (intuition)
of the cessation of suffering, of which the two factors of gradualness
and lingering suffering in the process are inferior; (2) prompt realization
of the cessation of suffering, of which only the [lingering] suffering in
the process is inferior; (3) gradual realization of the cessation of pleasure,
of which only the process of gradualness is inferior; and (4) prompt real-
ization of the cessation of pleasure but without its wider dissemination,
of which only the absence of dissemination is inferior. The process of
cessation propounded by the present Tathāgata constitutes not only the
prompt realization of the cessation of pleasure but also the wider dis-
semination of this method as far as the supernormal powers exercised
by heavenly beings.

Śāriputra said to the Buddha:

The teachings imparted by the World-honored One are of the nature of
highest wonder, because even women, who have a lower scale of intelli-
gence, can uphold the teachings, eradicate the evil influences of the defile-
ments, realize the supramundane realm free from such influences, realize
the liberation of the mind [free from craving and attachment], the liberation
of transcendent insight [free from ignorance], and directly experience the
realization thereof in this present life, namely, “Whoever has exhausted
[the cause of] birth and death, accomplishes the goal of the practice of
austerity, completes whatever should be done in life, for whom there will
be no more birth after this life.” This is the highest realization of cessation,
unsurpassable by any other doctrine. The World-honored One’s knowledge

and insight are comprehensive and his supernormal powers are all-inclusive.
Therefore, among all the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s of this world none
can ever equal the World-honored One. How much less could any of them
ever so ignominiously wish to be superior to the World-honored One?
Again, there is another superior quality in the World-honored One’s
exhortation, namely: discourses [having the nature] of purity. The dis-
courses of purity mean that the World-honored One neither speaks useless
and false words, [as can be observed] among the śramaṇa s and brāh-
maṇa s, nor does he seek verbal triumph, nor does he side with any group;
whatever he says is gentle, well-timed, and has factual basis. These are
the characteristics of the Tathāgata’s discourses regarded as pure and
genuine and unsurpassable. The World-honored One’s knowledge and
insight are comprehensive and his supernormal powers are all-inclusive.
Therefore, among all the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s of this world there
is none who can ever equal the World-honored One. How much less
could any of them ever so ignominiously wish to be superior to the
World-honored One?
Again, there is another superior quality of the World-honored One’s
exhortation, namely, the teaching of the realization of insight. (1) The
śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s enter the state of mental concentration through
various methods, and while abiding in that state they observe the body
from head to toes and vice versa. Inside and outside the skin, they observe
the presence of unclean hair on the head as well as on the body, nails,
the backs of the hands or insteps of the feet, liver, lungs, intestines, stom-
ach, spleen, kidneys, the five viscera (i.e., heart, lungs, liver, kidneys,
stomach), sweat, fat, marrow, brain, excretions and urine, nasal mucus,
and tears. As these are all unclean, there is nothing whatsoever to which
one may become attached. This is the first stage of realization of insight.
(2) The śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s enter the state of mental concentration
through various methods, and while abiding in that state, excluding the
unclean items of the skin and flesh, they observe exclusively the skeleton
and teeth. This is the second stage of the realization of insight. (3) The
śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s enter the state of mental concentration through
various methods, and while abiding in that state, excluding the unclean
items of the skin and flesh as well as the skeleton and teeth, they observe

exclusively where consciousness abides, thereby determining that con-  
sciousness abides in the present life, it abides in the future life, there is  
no discontinuity of the present life, there is no discontinuity of the future  
life after, there is no liberation in this present life, and there is no liberation  
in the future life. This is the third stage of the realization of insight. (4)  
The _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s enter the state of mental concentration  
through various methods, and while abiding in that state, excluding the  
unclean items of the skin and flesh as well as the skeleton and teeth,  
they observe once again exclusively where consciousness abides, thereby  
determining that consciousness abides in the future life but not in the  
present life, there is discontinuity of the present life but no discontinuity  
of the future life after, there is liberation in the present life but no liberation  
in the future life. This is the fourth stage of the realization of insight.  
(5) The _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s enter the state of mental concentration  
through various methods, and while abiding in that state, excluding thse  
unclean items of the skin and flesh as well as the skeleton and teeth,  
they observe for a third time exclusively where consciousness abides,  
thereby determining that consciousness abides neither in the present life  
nor in the future life, there is discontinuity of both the present life and  
the future life, and there is liberation in the present life as well as in the  
future life. This is the fifth stage of the realization of insight, of which  
no one can surpass [the Tathāgata’s supernormal power].  
The World-honored One’s knowledge and insight ( _jñāna-prajñā_ ) are  
comprehensive and his supernormal powers are all-inclusive. Therefore,  
among all the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s of this world, there is none who  
can ever equal the World-honored One. How much less could any of them  
ever so ignominiously wish to be superior to the World-honored One?  
Again, there is another superior quality in the World-honored One’s  
exhortation, namely, imparting [the critically examined] theories of eter-  
nalism, which is unsurpassed by any other person. The theories of eter-  
nalism are the following three: _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s enter the state  
of mental concentration through various methods, and while abiding in  
that state they recollect twenty evolving and devolving cycles of eons,  
saying, “The eternal existence of the world is alone true, while the rest  
is false.” Why is this so? Because of my recollection I know that there

were such evolving and devolving cycles of eons. But I do not know
anything about any period beyond that, nor do I know anything about
what takes place in the future.” These śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s proclaim
their ignorance both morning and evening, asserting that “Only the world
is eternal is true, while the rest is false.” This is called the first theory
of eternalism. (2) The śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s enter the state of mental
concentration through various methods and, while abiding in that state,
they recollect forty evolving and devolving cycles of eons and say, “Only
the eternal existence of the world is true, while the rest is false. Why is
this so? Because of my recollection I know that there were such evolving
and devolving cycles of eons. I also know all the past evolving and
devolving cycles of eons, but I do not know anything about [current]
evolving and devolving cycles of eons.” This theory knows the beginning
of the world but not the period of its ending. These śramaṇa s and brāh-
maṇa s proclaim their ignorance morning and evening, asserting that
“Only the world is eternal is true, while the rest is false.” This is called
the second theory of eternalism. (3) The śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s enter
into the state of mental concentration through various methods and, while
abiding in that state, they recollect eighty evolving and devolving cycles
of eons, saying, “Only the eternal existence of the world is true, while
the rest is false. For what reason? Because of my recollection I know that
there were such evolving and devolving cycles of eons. I also know what-
ever past eons of evolving and devolving cycles beyond that as well as
whatever future eons of evolving and devolving cycles beyond the present
time, without exception.” These śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s proclaim their
ignorance morning and evening, asserting that “Only the world is eternal
is true, while the rest is false.” This is called the third theory of eternalism.
[The Tathāgata, however, critically examined all these forms of eternalism,
[and his knowldege] is unsurpassable by anyone.]
The World-honored One’s knowledge and insight are comprehensive
and his supernormal powers are all-inclusive. Therefore, among all the
śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s of this world there is none who can ever equal
the World-honored One. How much less could any of them ever so igno-
miniously wish to be superior to the World-honored One?

Again, there is another superior quality of the World-honored One’s  
exhortation, namely, imparting the mind of other persons. The four kinds  
of mind-reading are (1) some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s investigate exter-  
nal signs ( _nimitta_ ) and predict, “The intended object of another mind is  
such-and-such” and “The intended object of this mind is such-and-such,”  
and the result is either true or false. This is the first kind of mind-reading.  
(2) Other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s do not investigate external signs  
but rely on the words of gods or nonhuman beings and predict, “Your  
thought is like this or like that,” which is also either true or false. This  
is the second kind of mind-reading. (3) Again, some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāh-  
maṇa_ s neither investigate external signs nor rely on the words of gods  
and non-human beings, but examining themselves (lit., the body) and  
listening to others’ words, they then predict, “Your thought is like this  
or like that,” which is also either true or false. This is the third kind of  
mind-reading. (4) Again, some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s neither inves-  
tigate external signs, nor rely on the words of gods and non-human  
beings, nor do they examine themselves or others, but removing both  
an awareness of an object and an act of examining they thereby enter  
the state of mental concentration, and while abiding in that state, inves-  
tigate the minds of others and predict, “Your thought is like this or like  
that.” There is no error in this kind of mind-reading. This is the fourth  
kind of mind-reading. [The Tathāgata’s supernormal power of mind-  
reading is unsurpassable by anyone.]  
The World-honored One’s knowledge and insight are comprehensive  
and his supernormal powers are all-inclusive. Therefore, among all the  
_śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s of this world there is none who can ever equal  
the World-honored One. How much less could any of them ever so igno-  
miniously wish to be superior to the World-honored One?  
Again, there is another superior quality of the World-honored One’s  
exhortation, namely, teaching the four instructions for saintly realization.  
The fourfold instructions are (1) at times, a person following the [Tathā-  
gata’s] instruction without turning away eradicated the evil influence of  
the defilements and thus realized the supramundane realm free from such  
influences, realized the liberation of the mind [free from craving and  
attachment], the liberation of transcendent insight [free from ignorance],

and directly experienced the realization thereof in this present life: “Who-
ever has exhausted [the cause of] birth and death, accomplishes the goal
of the practice of austerity, completes whatever should be done, for him
there will be no more birth after this life.” This is the effect of the first
kind of instruction.
(2) Again at times, a person following the [Tathāgata’s] instruction
without turning away eradicated the five kinds of defilement that bind
sentient beings to the lower realm of desire, i.e., the heretical belief in a
self, attachment to practices and observances other than those approved
by the Buddha, doubt, sexual desire, and malice, realized the state of non-
returner to be reborn [among the gods at the end of their life] and will not
return to this world. This is the effect of the second kind of instruction.
(3) Again at times, a person following the [Tathāgata’s] instruction
without turning away eradicated the three kinds of fetters, i.e., the heretical
belief in a self, attachment to practices and observances other than those
approved by the Buddha, doubt, the forces of desire, anger, and delusion,
and thereby realized the state of once-returner and, having returned to this
world, realized nirvana. This is the effect of the third kind of instruction.
(4) Again at times, a person following the [Tathāgata’s] instruction
without turning away eradicated the three kinds of fetters, thereby realized
the state of stream-winner and, returning to this world seven times,
realize the ultimate goal of nirvana without falling into any evil course
of existence. This is the effect of the fourth kind of instruction.
The foregoing instructions are unsurpassable. The World-honored
One’s knowledge and insight are comprehensive and his supernormal
powers are all-inclusive. Therefore, among all the śramaṇa s and brāh-
maṇa s of this world there is none who can ever equal the World-honored
One. How much less could any of them ever so ignominiously wish to
be superior to the World-honored One?
Again, there is another superior quality in the World-honored One’s
exhortation, namely, enabling the disciples to uphold the pure and genuine
moral disciplines. The set of moral disciplines are as follows: the śra-
maṇa s and brāhmaṇa s should speak honestly, with no deception; they
always caution themselves to reduce the amount of sleep of their own
accord; they neither enage in flattery nor speak falsehoods; they do not

engage in fortune-telling, whether it is for a good or bad omen; they  
praise others but do not falsely praise others, in order to demonstrate  
that they seek no benefit from others; they practice meditation and cul-  
tivate wisdom; they exercise eloquence without hesitation; they con-  
centrate on whatever they are engaged in, without distraction; and they  
make effort without slackening.  
The Tathāgata’s edification is unsurpassable. The World-honored  
One’s knowledge and insight are comprehensive and his supernormal  
powers are all-inclusive. Therefore, among all the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāh-  
maṇa_ s of this world there is none who can ever equal the World-honored  
One. How much less could any of them ever so ignominiously wish to  
be superior to the World-honored One?  
Again, there is another superior quality in the World-honored One’s  
exhortation, namely, imparting validation of the liberation accomplished  
by others. The knowledge of validation concerning others’ realization  
of liberation means that the World-honored One, reckoning various other  
causal conditions, thinks to himself and validates that this person has  
realized the state of stream-winner, or the state of once-returner, or the  
state of nonreturner, or the state of arhat. This kind of validation is unsur-  
passable. The World-honored One’s knowledge and insight are compre-  
hensive and his supernormal powers are all-inclusive. Therefore, among  
all the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s of this world there is none who can  
ever equal the World-honored One. How much less could any of them  
ever so ignominiously wish to be superior to the World-honored One?  
Again, there is another superior quality in the World-honored One’s  
exhortation, namely, imparting the supernormal knowledge of one’s for-  
mer states of existence. The _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s enter the state of  
mental concentration through various methods, and while abiding in  
that state they recollect the events of innumerable past worlds, extending  
to one life, two lives, and so on up to hundreds of thousands of lives  
through the period of the evolving and devolving cycles of eons. They  
recollect, “I was born in a certain place, my name and family was So-  
and-so, my race and clan were such-and-such, my life span was such-  
and-such, my favored food and drink were such-and-such, my suffering  
and happiness were such-and-such.” In reference to the characteristics

of their transmigration from this world to another world, from that world
to this world, and so on, they recollect innumerable past eons, always rec-
ollecting their origins passing through various existences as “This is the
state of ideation,” “This is the state of nonideation,” or “This is the state
of neither ideation nor nonideation,” and they thus recollect everything
and know everything. The Tathāgata’s power of this kind of knowledge
is unsurpassable. The World-honored One’s knowledge and insight are
comprehensive and his supernormal powers are all-inclusive. Therefore,
among all the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s of this world there is none who
can ever equal the World-honored One. How much less could any of them
ever so ignominiously wish to be superior to the World-honored One?
Again, there is another superior quality of the World-honored One’s
exhortation, namely, imparting supernormal vision. Supernormal vision
means that the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s enter the state of mental con-
centration through various methods, and while abiding in that state they
perceive various persons thoroughly and exhaustively as either dead or
alive, as either endowed with a good complexion or a bad one, as either
born into a good course of existence or a bad one, or as either endowed
with an agreeable figure or an ugly one, according to the kinds of actions
they undertook in life. For instance, some sentient beings committed evil
actions of body, speech, or mind, slandered the Buddhist śrāvaka arhats,
held upside-down (i.e., perverse) views, and upon their deaths they fell
into the three evil courses of existence. In contrast, other sentient beings
upheld good conduct of body, speech, and mind, did not slander the arhats,
and held right views, and upon their deaths they were born among the
gods, and with the supernormal power of vision they observe sentient
beings, perceiving and knowing them as they really are. This is unsur-
passable. The World-honored One’s knowledge and insight are compre-
hensive and his supernormal powers are all-inclusive. Therefore, among
all the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s of this world there are none who can
ever equal the World-honored One. How much less could any of them
ever so ignominiously wish to be superior to the World-honored One?
Again, there is another superior quality of the World-honored One’s
exhortation, namely, imparting the supernormal power of the wise and
saintly disciples. In ordinary meaning, the supernormal power of swiftness

means that the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s enter into the state of mental  
concentration through various methods, and while abiding in that state  
they acquire innumerable extraordinary powers, such as multiplying  
thier body into many at will and reversing them into a single body at  
will; passing through stone walls without obstruction; sitting in the lotus  
posture in midair, like a flying bird; jumping into the ground as if into  
water and lying on the surface of water as if on the ground; creating  
fiery flames and smoke like an actual bonfire; supporting the sun and  
moon in one’s hand; or standing up so as to reach the heaven of the god  
Brahmā. If these _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s boast of their acquisition of  
these powers, we should say to them, “We do not deny that these super-  
normal powers exist. But we say that these are the inferior kinds [of  
supernormal powers] performed by lowly, vulgar, ordinary people, and  
not the superior kinds performed by the wise and saintly disciples. When  
a _bhikṣu,_ abiding in various worlds, is not corrupted despite being in  
surroundings that induce attachment, and by discarding attachments or  
distancing himself from them he carries out his practice properly, as  
required, this is called the supernormal power of the wise and saintly  
disciples. Also, when a _bhikṣu_ is in an unpleasant environment but does  
not feel indignation or hatred, instead discarding these [afflictive emo-  
tions], and carries out his practice properly, as required, this is called  
the supernormal power of the wise and saintly disciples. In these various  
environments they distance themselves from both attachment and non -  
attachment, practice to maintain their equilibrium, and concentrate on  
doing so without fail. This is called the supernormal power of the wise  
and saintly disciples.  
Moreover, the World-honored One is endowed with the power of  
exertion and valor and with great insight; despite [empirical] cognition  
and awareness, he yet sees all with the insight of universal oneness.  
Hence, he is called One Who Has Realized the Insight of Universal  
Equality [of All that Exists]. Again, the World-honored One is neither  
pleased with desires, nor with lowly, vulgar performances, nor does he  
accept suffering and agony derived from wasteful toil. O World-honored  
One, if one wishes to eradicate the evil influences of defilements, he  
should engage in contemplation of an object and of an act of examining,

increasing the sense of joy and bliss, and thus abide in the first meditative
state of absorption. This method removes evil forces [such as avarice,
carnal desire, desire, evil, and wrong deeds]. Your Holiness [taught in
the discourses] the practice of contemplation of an object and of an act
of examining, the increase of the sense of joy and bliss while abiding
in the first meditative state of absorption, and in similar manner [taught]
the second, third, and fourth meditative states of absorption, respectively.
Your Holiness is endowed with the power of exertion and valor and with
great insight, and despite [empirical] cognition and awareness, Your
Holiness sees all with the insight of universal oneness, and therefore is
called One Who Has Realized the Insight of Universal Equality [of All
that Exists].
The Buddha said to Śāriputra:
Suppose a heretic follower or someone of a different school comes to
ask a question of you, “Could the past śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s equal
the śramaṇa Gautama?’ How should you answer him? Again, if he ques-
tions you, “Could future śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s equal the śramaṇa
Gautama?” How should you answer him? Again, if he questions you,
“Can the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s in the present equal the śramaṇa
Gautama?” How should you answer him?
Śāriputra replied to the Buddha:
If someone asks me, “Were the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s of the past
the equals of the śramaṇa Gautama?”. I would answer, “Yes.” If he asks
me again, “Are the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s of the future the equals
of the śramaṇa Gautama?”, I swould answer, “Yes.” If he asks, “Are
the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s of the present the equals of the śramaṇa
Gautama?”, I would answer, “No.”
The Buddha again said to Śāriputra:
The heretic brāhmaṇa s may also ask you, “Why do you assert ‘Yes, there
was or there will be’ in one case and ‘No, there is not’ in another case?”
Śāriputra replied to the Buddha:

I would answer, “The past buddhas who were perfectly enlightened are  
equal with the Tathāgata of the present time. The future buddhas who  
will be perfectly enlightened will also be equal with the Tathāgata of  
the present. I have learned from the Buddha himself that despite His  
Holiness’ wishes and efforts, the perfectly enlightened Buddha of the  
present time has not been able to introduce any other equally [qualified]  
buddha into this world.” O World-honored One, should this answer,  
based on my learning, on the Dharma, and in accordance with the  
Dharma, be regarded as appropriate, sir?  
The Buddha replied:  
This answer of yours is not wrong on the basis of the Dharma and accord-  
ing to the Dharma. Why is this so? Because the past and future buddhas,  
who were and will be perfectly enlightened, are equal with me, but it is  
not possible to have a second perfectly enlightened buddha appear in  
this present world.  
At that time, the venerable Udāyin was standing behind the World-honored  
One, fanning him. The Buddha said to Udāyin:

O Udāyin, you should contemplate the discipline of desiring less and  
being satisfied with less. Now, because I have great supernormal power  
and splendor, I desire less and am satisfied with less, and I am quite con-  
tent, having no desire to be fulfilled. O Udāyin, if any of the _śramaṇa_ s  
or _brāhmaṇa_ s exert themselves to accomplish this particular discipline  
and realize it, they will be entitled to raise their own banner and declare  
to all four quarters of the world, “I, the Tathāgata, have realized the dis-  
cipline of desiring less and being satisfied with less. As I observe the  
Tathāgata’s discipline of desiring less and being satisfied with less, he  
has great supernormal power and splendor, on the basis of which he is  
free from desire.”  
At that time, Udāyin rearranged his outer robe, exposing his right shoulder,  
and kneeling down with his right knee on the ground, holding both palms  
together respectfully, he said to the Buddha:

It is marvelous, sir, O World-honored One, there is hardly anyone who,  
like the World-honored One, desires less and is satisfied with less. O  
World-honored One, Your Holiness has little desire [precisely] because  
of the great supernormal power and splendor that you command. If any  
of the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s exercise exertion and realize this particular  
principle, they are entitled to raise their own banner and declare to all four  
quarters of the world, “From now on the World-honored One is endowed  
with the discipline of desiring less and being satisfied with less.”  
O Śāriputra, you should exhort this particular discipline frequently  
for the sake of the _bhikṣu_ s, _bhikṣuṇī_ s, laymen ( _upāsaka_ s), and laywomen  
( _upāsikā_ s). If any of them has doubt about the Buddha, Dharma, and  
Sangha or about the path of practice, they should listen to the foregoing  
and thereby become free from entanglement in the net of such doubts.  
At that time, the World-honored One said to Śāriputra:  
You should exhort this particular discipline frequently for the sake of the  
_bhikṣu_ s, _bhikṣuṇī_ s, laymen, and laywomen.Why? If any of them has  
doubt about the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha or about the path of practice,  
he should be able to resolve his doubt by listening to what you exhort.  
Śāriputra replied, “Yes, sir, World-honored One.”  
Thereupon, Śāriputra often exhorted the foregoing for the sake of the  
_bhikṣu_ s, _bhikṣuṇī_ s, laymen, and laywomen. Since the words of his exhortation  
were pure and genuine, he called his exhortation the “Sutra of Purity.” Having  
listened to the Buddha’s exhortation, Śāriputra was delighted, respectfully  
received the doctrine, and carried it out.
