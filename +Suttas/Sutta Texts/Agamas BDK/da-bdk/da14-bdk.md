### Indra’s Questions

### on Causality

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 21: Sakka-pañha Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was staying in Magadha at Indra’s  
Śāla Tree Cave on Mount Vediyaka, north of the village of Āmra. At that time,  
Śakra, lord of the gods, motivated by subtle good intent, wished to see the  
Buddha, thinking, “I would like to go to see the World-honored One.” Having  
heard that their lord, motivated by subtle good intent, was ready to visit the  
Buddha, the Trāyastriṃśa gods then came to speak to the god Indra, saying:

Very good, indeed. O Lord Śakra, motivated by subtle good intent, you  
are ready to see the Tathāgata. We wish also to visit the World-honored  
One in your company, sir.”  
The god Indra at once spoke to Pañcasikha, the _gandharva_ god, “I am  
ready to visit the World-honored One. You should accompany me. The Trāyas-  
triṃśa gods too shall come along with me.” All delightedly replied, “Yes, sir.”  
Thereupon, Pañcasikha played a string instrument made of lapis lazuli to  
offer music before Śakra while standing among the other gods. Then Śakra,  
lord of the gods, the Trāyastriṃśa gods as well as Pañcasikha, suddenly dis-  
appeared from the assembly hall and arrived at Mount Vediya of Magadha as  
quickly as the time it takes for a wrestler to bend his arm and straighten it.  
At that time, the World-honored One was engaged in fiery concentration,  
illumining all of Mount Vediya in a similar fiery color. Then, seeing the fiery  
slopes, the countrymen said to each other, “The reason that this mountain is  
brightly illumined in fiery color must be found in the power of the Tathāgata  
and the gods.”  
Thereupon, Śakra said to Pañcaśikha:  
The Tathāgata, who has extinguished all defilements, is difficult to see,  
because he frequently descends to this remote, secluded place and spends

his hours in silence, uttering no words, accompanied in the silence only
by wild birds and animals. Many great deities reside in this mountain,
accompanying the World-honored One. May you play your instrument
before the World-honored One to entertain him. I shall come later on
accompanying the other gods.
Pañcaśikha replied, “Yes, sir.” At once he visited the place by himself as
instructed and played his instrument in a spot near the World-honored One,
accompanying it with a song:
O my dear Bhadrā, you should venerate your father.
Your father is very handsome.
When you were born to him,
I was in love with your mother, Lakṣmī.
Originally, caused by a minor event,
In my mind arose higher aspiration,
Evolving to become greater and more intense.
As a result, I frequently made offerings to the arhats,
Engaged myself in practicing four kinds of meditation
Along with the sons of the Śākyas,
Always enjoying a quiet residence,
As though my mind sought the nectar [of religious salvation].
While I concentrated myself in practice,
Śākyamuni also gave rise within himself the aspiration
To pursue the path of realizing supreme enlightenment.
He still proceeds upon that career path even now,
While I seek that woman,
Wishing to make love without fail.
My mind has been entrapped in attachment,
Unable to abandon my passion toward her.
Though wishing to abandon it,
I have not been able to leave,
Just like an elephant languishing in chains.
I am like one who meets a cool wind when hot,
Who obtains cool springwater when thirsty,
Who realizes nirvana;

I am like water that extinguishes fire,  
An ill person who is visited by a good doctor,  
A starving person who obtains delicious food and  
Is gratified by consuming it to his heart’s content,  
An arhat who abides in a state of realization, and  
An elephant that, though still in chains, yet resists.  
Like such an elephant,  
I suddenly dash here and there, hardly controllable;  
Unrestrained, I cannot stop by myself;  
Just as an elephant pressed by heat plunges into a cool pond,  
Its surface totally covered with various flowers,  
Thereby cooling its entire body.  
Whatever offering I have made before and will make later on  
Should be offered to the arhats.  
Whatever I obtain due to rewarding fortune  
Should be given to them.  
If you die, I shall die together [with you].  
[If I] survive after [your demise], I will commit suicide.  
Without you, I certainly cannot live.  
May the lord of the Trāyastriṃśa gods, O Śakra,  
Grant me my wish.  
I shall praise you with due propriety.  
May you extend your sympathetic understanding to my request.  
At that time, the World-honored One came out of the state of concentration  
and said to Pañcaśikha:

Very good, O Pañcaśikha, you have praised the Tathāgata with your
voice of purity, accompanying it by playing the stringed instrument made
of lapis lazuli. The instrumental sound and your voice, neither too long
nor too short, well harmonized over a melancholy tune, is able to move
human hearts. Your performance on the instrument seems to express
various meanings, not only explaining the bondage of desire and praising
the practice of austerity, but also promoting the life of the śramaṇa and
the goal of nirvana.

At that moment, Pañcaśikha said to the Buddha:  
I recall, sir, that once in the olden days, when the World-honored One  
had accomplished the path of the Buddha under the _nyagrodha_ tree of  
Ajapāla near the Nairañjanā River in Uruvela, the son of Indra’s chari-  
oteer, Sikhaddi by name, and the daughter of the _gandharva_ god got  
together to seek sexual gratification. At that time, having confirmed that  
their minds were inclining toward this, I composed verses at once and,  
by way of playing a tune, I explained to them the bondage of desire,  
commended the practice of austerity, and exhorted the life of the _śramaṇa_  
as well as nirvana. Then, having listened to my song, that heavenly  
nymph raised her eyes toward me and said with a smile, “O dear Pañca -  
śikha, I have not yet seen the Tathāgata but I have heard of the words  
of praise spoken by those gods assembled in the Sudharma Hall of  
Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, saying, “He has such-and-such virtues,” “He has  
such-and-such powers,” [and so on]. You have always upheld your faith  
in the Tathāgata and have been closely associated with him. Now I wish  
to become acquainted with the Tathāgata along with you, sir.” O World-  
honored One, at that time I gave my promise to her, but ever since I have  
not had an opportunity to speak to her again, sir.  
Then Śakra, lord of the gods, thought to himself, “Pañcasikha has already  
entertained the Tathāgata. I now should think of him [and communicate].”  
Śakra, lord of the gods, thus thought of the _gandharva_ god.  
This thought then appeared in Pañcaśikha’s mind, “Now, Śakra, lord of the  
gods, has sent a message to me.” At once, picking up the string instrument  
made of lapis lazuli, Pañcaśikha returned to the place of the god Indra. Indra  
said to him:

May you go to see the World-honored One as my proxy, representing  
the Trāyastriṃśa gods, and after greeting him with a bow say these words  
of enquiry about his well-being: “Is His Holiness at ease with his rising  
and sitting, does he feel strong in his walking?”  
Thus instructed, Pañcaśikha returned to the World-honored One and,  
having honored the Buddha by bowing his forehead to the Buddha’s feet, he  
withdrew to one side and said to the World-honored One:

Śakra, lord of the gods, lord of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven and all the gods  
therein, sent me to the World-honored One with words of enquiry regard-  
ing your well-being: “Is His Holiness at ease in his rising and sitting,  
does he feel strong in his walking?”  
The World-honored One replied:  
May you, the god Indra, and all the Trāyastriṃśa gods equally enjoy  
increased longevity, a pleasurable life, and good health. For the gods of  
those other heavens and humans, as well as those sentient beings, the  
_asura_ s, have been indulged with longevity, comfortable living, and the  
absence of illness.  
At that moment, Śakra, lord of the gods, again thought to himself, “We  
should see and pay our respects to the World-honored One.” Accompanied  
by the Trāyastriṃśa gods, he immediately went to the place of the Buddha  
and all of the gods, having honored the Buddha by bowing their foreheads  
to the Buddha’s feet, withdrew to one side.  
Thereupon the god Indra said to the Buddha, “This is strange. I feel that  
I am sitting far away from the World-honored One, and I should take my  
seat at a closer spot.”  
The Buddha said to the god Indra, “Though the assembly of your gods is  
quite large, come closer toward me and take your seat.”  
At that moment, the Śāla Tree Cave automatically increased in size so as  
to provide abundant space for all the Trāyastriṃśa gods. Thereupon, the god  
Indra and the Trāyastriṃśa gods, as well as Pañcaśikha, all honored the Buddha  
by bowing their foreheads to the Buddha’s feet and withdrew to take their seats  
on one side.  
Śakra, lord of the gods, said to the Buddha:  
At one time, the World-honored One was at the house of a lay _brāhmaṇa_  
householder in Śrāvastī. At that time, the World-honored One had entered  
into the fiery mental concentration. I was then traveling on a minor errand,  
in a treasure chariot equipped with thousand-spoked wheels, and as I was  
passing through the air on the way to visit the guardian god Virūḍhaka,  
I happened to see a heavenly maiden, her hands held together in reverence,  
standing before the World-honored One. I approached her and said:

When the World-honored One comes out from his concentration,
may you greet him by announcing my name and enquire about his
well-being: “Is His Holiness at ease in his rising and sitting, does he
feel strong in his walking?”
I was uncertain whether [the heavenly maiden] really conveyed my greeting
to Your Holiness. O World-honored One, do you recall the occasion, sir?
The Buddha replied:
Yes, indeed, I recall it. She announced your name and greeted me in
your very voice. When I came out of the concentration, I could still hear
the sound of your chariot [fading away].
The god Indra said to the Buddha:
Once upon a time, due to of some minor business, I happened to be
together with the Trāyastriṃśa gods, who were assembled at the Sudhar -
ma Hall, when the senior gods all commended me with the following
words: “If the Tathāgata should arise in this world, he will promote our
well-being while causing the advantage of the asura s, the adversarial
demigods, to diminish.” Now I myself see Your Holiness, thus knowing
and directly confirming that the Tathāgata, Arhat, has indeed appeared
in this world, promoting the well-being of the gods while causing the
advantage of the asura s to diminish.
There was a Śākya daughter, Gopikā by name, who practiced the dis-
cipline of pure and genuine austerity under the World-honored One, and
who, after her body had dissolved and her life had ended, was born in
Trāyastriṃśa Heaven as my son, [ Gopaka]. All the Trāyastriṃśa gods
praised him, “Gopaka, son of our lord, is in possession of great merit and
the power of influence.” There were also three bhikṣu s who had once prac-
ticed austerity under the World-honored One. After their bodies dissolved
and their lives ended, they were born among lowly gods such as gandharva s.
They come every day to serve me and play music at my mealtimes, day
and evening. Having seen them, Gopaka teased them in these verses:
You are the Buddha’s disciples.
Once when I was in a lay household,

I used to offer you alms and robes, and  
Venerated you with respect and reverence.  
Whatever name you had at that time,  
Having received the Buddha’s teaching,  
You failed to investigate into the doctrines  
Taught by the master of supreme insight.  
In my previous life,  
I venerated you and was intent  
In listening to the teachings of the Buddha, and  
Thus was born in this Trāyastriṃśa Heaven as the son of the god Indra.  
Can’t you see that in my previous life I was a woman,  
But because of my merit  
I am now the son of the god Indra?  
In your previous life,  
Both of you together practiced austerity,  
Yet you have now fallen to a lower position,  
Thus serving us at mealtimes.  
Because of the wrong deeds you once did,  
You are now receiving such an unfavorable reward,  
Placing yourselves as servants to us at mealtimes.  
You were born in an impure locality  
Unable to avoid others’ teasing.  
Having listened to my teasing,  
You should be weary of your position.  
From now on, exert yourselves and  
Never take a position in service to others.  
O you two, exert yourselves in your practice,  
Contemplate the teaching of the Tathāgata,  
Forsake whatever you feel as attachment,  
Understand the result of desire and impure conduct:  
Insofar as you are bound by desire,  
Your conduct cannot be really true  
But is of the deceptive human world.  
Just as an elephant breaks its reins,  
One should go beyond Trāyastriṃśa Heaven.

Through heroic endeavor
One should go beyond Trāyastriṃśa Heaven,
While Śakra and the heavenly gods
Assemble at the Sudharma Hall,
Thereby causing Śakra to sigh in wonder and
The Trāyastriṃśa gods to acknowledge his superior power.
Indeed, the son of the Śākya
[Actually] accomplished this heroic feat,
Going beyond Trāyastriṃśa Heaven.
(Here in the Chinese text, Indra continues his narrative in verse:)
Wearying of the bondage caused by desire,
Gopaka thus completed his exhortation
[Referring again to that exemplary hero,] saying,
“The Buddha appeared in the country of Magadha,
Known to all as Śākyamuni.”
Those three bhikṣu s, though disappointed at the time,
Regained their practice of mindfulness later on.
One of the three became a gandharva god,
While the other two,
Having realized the truth of the noble path,
Transcended Trāyastriṃśa Heaven.
The disciples did not doubt
Whatever doctrine the World-honored One taught.
Of those three bhikṣu s,
Who all listened to the Buddha’s teaching,
Two excelled in practice more than the other one.
Having realized their own excellent accomplishment,
These two have just been born in Ābhāsvara Heaven.
Having witnessed this event,
I come to present myself at the place of the Buddha.
Lord Indra said to the Buddha, “May Your Reverence spare a moment to
address my doubts?”
The Buddha replied, “Let me know your questions. I shall answer accord-
ingly.”

At that time, the god Indra said to the Buddha:

What kinds of moral and spiritual defilements cause the gods, humans,
gandharva s, and asura s, as well as all other sentient beings, respectively
fettered, to thus hate each other and carry on armed conflict?

The Buddha replied to Śakra:

The fetter of hatred invariably arises from greed and jealousy. These
two forces of motivation thus drive sentient beings toward armed conflict.

The god Indra then said to the Buddha:

It is indeed true, O World-honored One, that because of the force of
greed and jealousy, gods, humans, gandharva s, and asura s, as well as
all other sentient beings, are driven to battle each other with weapons.
Having listened to the Buddha’s answer, the net of my doubt is now
totally removed; I am no longer in doubt about it, sir. But I still do not
understand from what original cause greed and jealousy arise—what
are the direct cause, the indirect cause, and the respective ultimate factors?
What is it that when present makes these forces operative, and when
absent renders these forces inoperative?

The Buddha replied to Śakra, lord of the gods:

Greed and jealousy arise due to the existence of things that we hold dear
and things that are not held dear by us. These two are the direct causes,
the indirect causes, and the ultimate factors. When these factors are pres-
ent, greed and jealousy arise; in their absence, greed and jealousy do
not arise.

Śakra, lord of the gods, then further said to the Buddha:

This is indeed true, sir. Greed and jealousy arise, invariably caused by
things that we hold dear and things that are not held dear by us. These
two are the direct causes, the indirect causes, and the ultimate factors.
When these factors are present, greed and jealousy arise; when these
are absent, greed and jealousy do not arise. Having listened to the
Buddha’s answer, the net of my doubt is now totally removed; I am no

longer in doubt about this, sir. But what gives rise to the things that are
dear to us and those that are not dear to us, from what direct cause, from
what indirect cause, and from what ultimate factor? What is it that, when
present, invites their arising, while when absent prevents their arising?
The Buddha replied to Śakra, lord of the gods:
Things that are we hold dear and things that are not dear to us arise from
our desires, from desires as direct causes, desires as indirect causes, and
desires as ultimate factors. When desires are present, greed and jealousy
arise; when desires are absent, greed and jealousy do not arise.
Śakra, lord of the gods, said to the Buddha:
This is indeed true, sir. Things that are held dear by us and things that
we do not hold dear invariably arise because of desires. They arise from
desires as direct causes, as indirect causes, and as ultimate factors. When
desires are present, things dear to us and things not dear to us arise;
when desires are absent, neither arises. Having listened to the teaching
of the Buddha, the net of my doubt is now totally removed; I am no
longer in doubt about this, sir. But from what do desires arise, from what
direct cause, from what indirect cause, and from what ultimate factors?
What is it that when present gives rise to desire, but when absent does
not give rise to desire?
The Buddha replied to Śakra, lord of the gods:
Things that we hold dear (i.e., cravings) arise from thoughts as direct
causes, thoughts as indirect causes, and thoughts as ultimate factors.
When thoughts are present, desires arise; when thoughts are absent,
desires do not arise.
At that time, Śakra, lord of the gods, said to the Buddha:
This is indeed true, sir. Desires invariably arise from the cause of thoughts.
They arise from thoughts as direct causes, as indirect causes, and as ulti-
mate factors. When thoughts are present, desires arise, while when they
are absent, desires do not arise. Having listened to the teaching of the
Buddha, the net of my doubt is now totally removed; I am no longer in

doubt about this, sir. But I still do not understand what thoughts arise
from, from what direct cause, from what indirect cause, and from what
ultimate factor? What is it that, when present, gives rise to thoughts, but
when absent does not give rise to thoughts?

The Buddha replied to Śakra, lord of the gods:

Thoughts arise from mental calculation based on obsessive conceptions,
as direct cause, as indirect cause, and as ultimate factor. When mental
calculation based on obsessive conceptions is present, thoughts arise;
when it is absent, thoughts do not arise.

At that time, Śakra, lord of the gods, said to the Buddha:

This is indeed true, sir. Thoughts invariably arise from mental calculation
based on obsessive conceptions. Thoughts arise from mental calculation
based on obsessive conception and ideations as direct cause, as indirect
cause, and as ultimate factor. When mental calculation based on obsessive
conceptions is present, thoughts arise, but when it is absent thoughts do
not arise. But I still do not understand from what this mental calculation
based on obsessive conceptions arises, from what direct cause, from
what indirect cause, and from what ultimate factor? What is it that, when
present, gives rise to mental calculation based on obsessive conceptions,
but when absent does not give rise to such mental calculation?

The Buddha replied to Śakra, lord of the gods:

Whenever thoughts arise, they are caused by mental calculation based
on obsessive conceptions as direct cause, as indirect cause, and as ultimate
factor. When this is present, thoughts arise; when absent, thoughts do
not arise. O Śakra, lord of the gods, if there is no mental calculation
based on obsessive conceptions, there would be no thought. If there is
no thought, there would be no desire. If there is no desire, none of the
things that are held dear by oneself as well as things that are not held
dear would arise. If there is neither of these two, neither greed nor
jealousy would arise. If there is no jealousy or greed, neither armed con-
flict among sentient beings, nor the will to injure and murder each other,
would arise. O Śakra, lord of the gods, all this is ultimately based on

obsessive conceptions as direct cause, obsessive conceptions as indirect
cause, and obsessive conceptions as ultimate factor. From this ultimate
factor, then, thoughts arise; from thoughts desires arise; from desires
there arise things that one holds dear and things that are not held dear;
from these two, there arise greed and jealousy; because of greed and
jealousy, all sentient beings are driven to injure and murder each other.
Śakra, lord of the gods, said to the Buddha:
This is indeed true, O World-honored One. Because of obsessive con-
ceptions, thoughts arise. Thoughts arise with obsessive conceptions as
direct cause, as indirect cause, and as ultimate factor. In the presence of
obsessive conceptions arises thought, while in their absence there is no
arising of thought. If there is no obsessive conceptions as ultimate factor,
no thought arises; if there is no thought, no desire arises; if there is no
desire, none of things that are held dear by oneself or those things that
are not held dear will arise; if there are neither of these two, neither
greed nor jealousy will arise; if there is neither greed nor jealousy, no
sentient being will be driven to injure or murder another. Having listened
to the teaching of the Buddha, the net of my doubt has now been totally
removed and I am no more in doubt about this, sir.
Śakra then said to the Buddha:
For the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, has or has not the proper path that
will help them terminate mental calculation based on obsessive concep-
tions been set out, sir?
The Buddha replied to Śakra, lord of the gods:
Neither śramaṇa s nor brāhmaṇa s have been given a proper method by
which to totally eradicate obsessive conceptions. Why is this? O Śakra,
lord of the gods, there are many compartmentalized areas in this world.
Sentient beings are firmly attached to their own compartmentalized areas,
defending them formidably, and thus they are unable to relinquish them.
They claim that theirs are real while all others are unreal. Because of this,
O Śakra, lord of the gods, all the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s have no proper
method by which to totally eradicate obsessive conceptualization.

At that time, Śakra, lord of the gods, spoke to the Buddha:  
This is indeed true, sir. There are many compartmentalized areas in this  
world. Sentient beings are firmly attached to their own compartmentalized  
areas, defending them formidably, and they are unable to relinquish  
them. They claim that theirs are real while all others are unreal. Because  
of this, O Śakra, lord of the gods, all the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s have  
no proper method by which to totally eradicate obsessive conceptions.  
Having listened to the explanation of the Buddha, the net of my doubt  
has now been removed; I am no longer in doubt about this, sir.  
Śakra, lord of the gods, said to the Buddha, “Do the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāh-  
maṇa_ s have some sort of method by which to partially eradicate mental cal-  
culation based on obsessive conceptions?”  
The Buddha replied to Śakra, lord of the gods:  
There are three types of obsessive conceptions: verbal, mental, and  
actions. Some speech injures oneself, others, and both oneself and others.  
Forsaking through concentration the obsessive conceptions that are  
merely attendant to the object (purpose) of speech, one will not injure  
oneself, others, or both oneself and others. _Bhikṣu_ s, with a sense of the  
appropriate time, concentrate their minds toward the course of the ref-  
erential object of speech without conceptual disruption. Some thought  
injures oneself, others, and both oneself and others.  
At that time, Śakra, lord of the gods, said, “I have no doubt about what I  
have heard from the Buddha.”  
Again, he said to the Buddha, “How many forms of firm, noble equanimity  
are there?”  
The Buddha said to Śakra, lord of the gods:  
There are three kinds of equanimity. First, the equanimity that pleases  
the body; second, that which distresses the body; and third, that which  
is neutral to the body. O Śakra, lord of the gods, the equanimity that  
pleases the body injures oneself, others, and both oneself and others.  
Forsaking this pleasure, one remains with that which is being pleased,  
thereby not injuring himself, others, or both himself and others. _Bhikṣu_ s,  
with a sense of the appropriate [time], concentrate on it and do not forget.

This is regarded to receive the higher ordination in conformity with the
Vinaya disciplines. O Śakra, lord of the gods, distressing one’s body
injures oneself, injures others, and injures both. Forsaking this bodily
distress, one remains with that which is distressed, not injuring himself,
others, or both himself and others. Bhikṣu s with a sense of the appropriate
[time], concentrate on it and do not forget. This is regarded to receive
the higher ordination in conformity with the Vinaya disciplines. Again,
O Śakra, lord of the gods, being neutral to one’s body injures oneself,
others, and both oneself and others. Forsaking the neutrality of the body,
one remains with what is forsaken, not injuring himself, others, and both
himself and others. Bhikṣu s, with a sense of the appropriate [time], con-
centrate on it and do not forget. This is regarded to receive the higher
ordination in conformity with the Vinaya disciplines.
At that time, Śakra, lord of the gods, said, “I have no doubt about what I
have heard from the Buddha.”
Śakra, lord of the gods, then said to the Buddha, “How many rules of dis-
cipline for the sense faculties are there with which the wise and holy are
endowed, sir?”
The Buddha replied to Śakra, lord of the gods:
As for the visual faculty and the object of form, I distinguish two kinds:
one that should be known by a bhikṣu and another should not be known.
In like manner, I differentiate two kinds of perceptions for the auditory
faculty and its object, the olfactory faculty and its object, the gustatory
faculty and its object, the tactile faculty and its object, and the mental
faculty and its object: namely, one that should be known and another
that should not to be known.
At that time, Śakra, lord of the gods, said to the Buddha:
O World-honored One, I can already guess the answers based upon the
Tathāgata’s initial explanation, even before a detailed exposition is given,
sir. When the eyes see an object of form, I differentiate between two
kinds of perception: one that should be known and another that should
not be known. Likewise, I differentiate between two kinds of perception

of the ears and sound, the nose and smell, the tongue and taste, the body  
and touch, and the intellect and the psychophysical elements.  
O World-honored One, when I recognize in visual perception favorable  
elements decreasing and unfavorable elements increasing, I say that I  
should not associate with that perception. O World-honored One, when  
I recognize in visual perception favorable elements increasing and unfa-  
vorable elements decreasing, I should associate with that perception. In  
like manner, when the ears, nose, body, and _manas_ cognate sound, smell,  
touch, and the elements, if I recognize favorable elements increasing  
and unfavorable elements decreasing, I say that I should associate with  
that perception.  
The Buddha said to Śakra, lord of the gods, “Very good! This is known  
as the dual rules of discipline to which the wise and holy should adhere.”  
Śakra, lord of the gods, said to the Buddha, “I have no doubt about what  
I have heard from the Buddha.” He continued:

To which of the following titles is a _bhikṣu_ entitled? First, ultimate per-  
fection; second, ultimate practice of austerity; third, ultimate state of  
comfort and happiness; and fourth, ultimate final nirvana?  
The Buddha replied to Śakra, lord of the gods:  
When one has brought cessation to the body that is distressed because  
of desire, he or she is entitled to be named by these four terms: one who  
has accomplished the ultimate perfection, ultimate practice of austerity,  
ultimate comfortable happiness, and final nirvana.  
Śakra, lord of the gods, said to the Buddha:  
This question, with which I have had problems and about which I have  
held many doubts for a long time, has now been resolved through the  
Tathāgata’s clarification, sir.  
The Buddha said to Śakra, lord of the gods, “In the past, did you once  
visit _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s and question them about this?”  
Śakra, lord of the gods, replied to the Buddha:

Yes, sir. I recall that in the past I once visited śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s
and questioned them about this. On another occasion, I recall that we
assembled at the Sudharma Hall and I discussed with the Trāyastriṃśa
gods as to whether or not the Tathāgata had appeared in this world, but
despite our search we were unable to confirm his appearance. We returned
to our respective palaces and engaged in pastimes gratifying the five
senses. O World-honored One, later on I also saw various great deities
who were engaged in gratifying the five senses, reaching the ends of
their lives. At this, O World-honored One, I was terrified, my hair standing
on end.
At the same time, I also observed śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s residing
in secluded places, having renounced domestic life and desires. So I
approached them and enquired, “What is called the ultimate?” When I
asked the meaning of this, they could not reply. They did not know the
answer, but in turn asked me, “Who are you?” I answered, “I am Śakra,
lord of the gods, Indra.” They then asked me, “ Who are you? What Śakra
is that?” I then replied, “I am the lord of the gods, Śakra. Having a ques-
tion in my mind, I came to ask you about it.” I then explained what I
understood of the doctrines of the Śākya. After they had listened to my
exhortation, they became my disciples. I am now a disciple of the Buddha.
Having realized the saintly state of stream-winner, provided that I do
not fall into lower realms, after seven rebirths in the world of humans I
am destined to realize the result of the path. May I request Your Holiness,
O World-honored One, to prophesy the saintly state of once-returner on
my behalf and explain the meaning of this term.
Śakra, lord of the gods, then composed verses:
Because of that defiled thought,
I cherished doubts.
Throughout the night, together with the gods,
While searching for the Tathāgata,
I saw a number of bhikṣu s
Who had renounced domestic life in their secluded places.
As they spoke of the World-honored One,
I went to see them with respectful greetings and,

With a bow, asked them:  
“I have deliberately come to visit you.  
What is the ultimate perfection?”  
After this question, I then asked them  
Whether they had the proper method  
By which to realize ultimate cessation,  
But they could not answer my question.  
Today, O Unsurpassed Honorable One,  
Whom I have long sought after,  
I have been examining my conduct and  
My mind has been engaged in right contemplation.  
Your Holiness has understood the conduct of my mind and  
My practice for a long period of time;  
May I request the Pure-eyed One to note this.  
I pay my homage to the Highest among Humans,  
The Unsurpassed One in the three worlds,  
Thereby to sever the relation of indebtedness and attachment.  
Now I venerate the Most Honorable One like the sun.  
The Buddha said to Śakra, lord of the gods, “Do you recall the time when  
you acquired blissful joy and memorable happiness?”  
Śakra, lord of the gods, replied:  
Yes, sir. There was such a time. O World-honored One, I recall the blissful  
joy and memorable happiness that I acquired in the past. O World-  
honored One, I once battled the _asura_ s and won victory; when the _asura_ s  
withdrew I then returned with joy and delight. Considering this blissful  
joy and memorable happiness, I realize now that those feelings of joy  
and happiness were devoid of reality, in that they arose from the basic  
defilement upon which armed conflict, dispute, and controversy rest.  
However, the joy and happiness that I have now acquired in relation to  
the Buddha is not the kind of blissful joy and memorable happiness that  
was acquired through armed conflict and disputes.  
The Buddha said to Śakra, lord of the gods, “Now, having acquired [new]  
blissful joy and memorable happiness, what result do expect to find in them?”  

Śakra, lord of the gods, then said to the Buddha, “I have sought after five  
kinds of meritorious results in the state of blissful joy and memorable hap-  
piness. What are the five?”  
At once, he composed explanatory verses:  
When later on my life ends and  
I forsake my longevity in the heavens,  
I will enter a mother’s womb  
That is free from illness and is pleasing to me.  
The Buddha inculcates the right, true path  
By which to convert those who have not yet been liberated.  
Within the Dharma of the perfectly enlightened,  
I shall practice the discipline of austerity,  
Steadfast transcendent knowledge, and  
Directly perceive the noble truths.  
Realizing the original place from which things arise,  
Realizing deliverance in the eternity therein,  
With effort for practice,  
I will acquire the knowledge  
Of the nature of things as they really are.  
Even if I fail to obtain the direct experience of the path,  
The merit therefrom is superior to rebirth among the gods.  
All the gods, from the superior heaven and Akaniṣṭha Heaven  
(highest in the realm of form),  
Down to the last body of incarnation,  
Will be born in that place.  
Now I have been reborn there with  
A heavenly body, pure and genuine,  
I see through my pure vision  
That my longevity has also increased.  
Having completed these verses, Śakra, lord of the gods, said to the Buddha,  
“I wish to acquire these five rewards with blissful joy and memorable hap-  
piness, sir.”  
At that time, Śakra, lords of gods, said to the Trāyastriṃśa gods:

Is it not a good idea that we conduct the rite of veneration and observance  
for the sake of the god Brahmā in the guise of a youth, resident of the  
higher heaven above us, while now in front of the Buddha?  
No sooner had he finished speaking than there suddenly appeared the god  
Brahmā in the guise of a youth, floating in mid-air over the Trāyastriṃśa  
gods. He recited the following verse to Śakra, lord of the gods:

The pure and genuine practice,  
Carried out by the lord of the gods,  
Benefits many sentient beings.  
May the lord of the gods visiting Magadha  
Thoroughly ask about the meaning of Tathāgata.  
Then, upon completing the verse, the god Brahmā in the guise of a youth  
suddenly disappeared.  
At that time, Śakra, lord of the gods, arose from his seat and, having hon-  
ored the World-honored One [by bowing his forehead to the Buddha’s] feet,  
circumambulated him three times and left the place. The Trāyastriṃśa gods  
and Pañcaśikha also honored the Buddha [by bowing to his] feet and departed.  
Then Śakra, the lord of the gods, who was by then a little farther ahead,  
looked back and said to Pañcaśikha:

It was very good that you played the instrument before the Buddha to  
entertain him, and that thereafter I arrived, together with the gods. I have  
now come to know you and I shall promote you to fatherly status, the  
highest among the _gandharva_ s, and arrange for the daughter of the lord  
of the _gandharva_ s, Bhadrā, to become your wife.  
When the World-honored One had completed this teaching, the eighty-four  
thousand heavenly beings all acquired genuine insight into the nature of the  
Dharma free from defilement. Then Śakra, Indra, lord of the gods, the Trāyas-  
triṃśa gods, as well as Pañcaśikha, having listened to the Buddha’s exhortation,  
all rejoiced and respectfully carried out what was taught by the Buddha.
