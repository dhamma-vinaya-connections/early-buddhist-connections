### Sutra 2

### Last Journey and Sojourns

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 16: Mahāparinibbāna Suttanta )

#### First Episode

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was sojourning on the [moun-  
taintop called] Vulture Peak in the city of Rājagṛha, together with one thousand  
two hundred and fifty disciples. At that time, Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha,  
desired to conquer the country of Vṛji. The king thought to himself, “Though  
the Vṛji countrymen are known to be brave and the people physically strong,  
it would not be too difficult for me to conquer them.” Thereupon, King Ajā-  
taśatru summoned his prime minister, Varṣākāra, a _brāhmaṇa,_ saying:

May you visit the World-honored One at Vulture Peak, [venerate him] in  
my proxy, and greet him with words of enquiry regarding his well-being:  
“Is his holiness at ease with his rising and sitting and does he feel strong  
in his walking?” Then speak to the World-honored One [with my words]:  
“The Vṛji countrymen are proud of their valor and of the physical strength  
of their people, and do not submit to my authority. I wish to conquer them,  
but since I have not thoroughly examined the matter, may I ask if the  
World-honored One could give some words of instruction on my behalf?”  
If the World-honored One does say something, bear in mind exactly what  
he has said without missing a word, and tell me his words exactly as you  
have heard them. Whatever the Tathāgata says cannot be false.  
Having received the king’s order, Prime Minister Varṣākāra at once boarded  
a carriage leaving for Vulture Peak, reached the point where he had to alight  
from the vehicle, and then approached on foot. On reaching the World-honored  
One’s dwelling place and greeting him with a bow, Varṣākāra withdrew to  
one side to take his seat and said to the World-honored One:

Ānanda answered, “Yes, this also have I heard, sir.” The Buddha spoke  
to him again:

O Ānanda, if that is really the case, the young and old are harmonious,  
together they are all the more prosperous, their country should be secure  
for some time to come and cannot be invaded by any other country. O  
Ānanda, haven’t you heard that the Vṛji countrymen venerate the  
Buddhist shrines ( _abhyantara-caitya_ ) and respect the heretic shrines?  
Ānanda answered, “Yes, this I also have heard, sir.” The Buddha spoke  
to him again:

O Ānanda, if that is really the case, the young and old are harmonious,  
together they are all the more prosperous, their country should be secure  
for some time to come and cannot be invaded by any other country. O  
Ānanda, haven’t you heard that the wives and daughters of the Vṛji coun-  
trymen are genuine, faithful, spotless, and speak no evil even in jest?  
Ānanda answered, “Yes, this also have I heard, sir.” The Buddha spoke  
to him again:

O Ānanda, if that is really the case, the young and old are harmonious,  
together they are all the more prosperous, their country should be secure  
for some time to come and cannot be invaded by any other country. O  
Ānanda, haven’t you heard that the Vṛji countrymen render services  
for the needs of religious practitioners, the _śramaṇa_ s, revere those who  
are steadfast in moral precepts, and ready themselves to guard the reli-  
gion and protect the practitioners, having never failed in doing so?  
Ānanda answered, “Yes, this also I have heard, sir.” The Buddha spoke  
to him again:

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

The Buddha spoke to the _bhikṣu_ s:

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

of the Buddha; second, the principle of mindfulness of the Dharma;  
third, the principle of mindfulness of the Sangha; fourth, the principle  
of mindfulness of the precepts; fifth, the principle of mindfulness of  
the practice of charity; sixth: the principle of mindfulness of birth in  
heaven. These are the six principles that enable the Dharma to flourish  
and protect it from slander.  
At that time, the World-honored One sojourned in Rājagṛha as long as he  
wished, and then said to Ānanda, “You are doing well [in the life of daily  
practice]. I wish to visit the Bamboo Grove monastery.”  
Ānanda replied, “Yes, sir.” At once, he packed the Buddha’s robe and  
almsbowl and, carrying them [on his shoulder], followed behind him together  
with the other _bhikṣu_ s. Proceeding on the highway of Magadha, the World-  
honored One then reached the Bamboo Grove, entered the monastic building,  
and took his seat in the meeting hall. There, he taught the _bhikṣu_ s the cur-  
riculum of three [major] trainings: (1) moral precepts ( _śīla_ ), (2) mental con-  
centration ( _samādhi_ ), and (3) [analytical] insight ( _prajñā_ ).

Being steadfast in the set of moral precepts and experiencing mental  
concentration, you may acquire great reward; being steadfast in the expe-  
rience of mental concentration and the application of analytical insight,  
you may acquire great reward. Being steadfast in the application of ana-  
lytical insight and realizing the purity of your mind, you may acquire  
perfect deliverance and extinguish three kinds of defilements, namely,  
defilement due to carnal desire, defilement due to existential desire, and  
defilement due to ignorance. When one has realized deliverance, he  
acquires the subsequent knowledge that he has realized emancipation,  
namely, “Whosoever has terminated [the cause of] birth and death,  
accomplished the goal of the practice of austerity, completed whatever  
should be done, for him there will be no more birth after this life.”  
At that time, the World-honored One sojourned at the Bamboo Grove as  
long as he wished, and then said to Ānanda, “You are doing well [in the life  
of daily practice]. I should proceed to the city of Pāṭaliputra.”  
Ānanda replied, “Yes, sir.” At once, he packed the Buddha’s robe and  
almsbowl and, carrying them [on his shoulder], followed behind him together

with the other _bhikṣu_ s. Traveling on the highway of Magadha, the World-  
honored One then reached the city of Pāṭaliputra and took his seat under a  
_paṭala_ tree.  
Having heard that the Buddha had arrived from a long distance at the  
_paṭala_ tree accompanied by a group of his disciples, a group of lay devotees  
came out from the city and from a distance saw the World-honored One  
seated under the _paṭala_ tree. They realized that his handsome appearance  
and calm, restrained senses were most sublimely matched in his holiness,  
just as a great dragon can be clearly seen through transparent water. They  
noted that the thirty-two eminent marks and eighty additional marks embel-  
lished his physical features. With delight in their hearts, they finally reached  
the place of the Buddha and, having honored him [by bowing] their foreheads  
to his feet, they withdrew to one side and took their seats. At that moment,  
the World-honored One began to teach them the doctrine of Dharma, thus  
encouraging, benefiting, and delighting them.  
Having listened to the teaching, the lay devotees said to the Buddha:  
We humbly wish to take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.  
May your holiness, with compassion, grant us lay devotees your per-  
mission. From now on, we are committed to upholding the five precepts:  
not to injure life, not to steal, not to indulge in sexual misconduct, not  
to speak falsehoods, and not to ingest intoxicants. We have also planned  
to set up a place to make our offerings, sir. We earnestly wish, O World-  
honored One, that your holiness as well as the host of venerables have  
sympathy with us in accepting our offerings.  
At that time, the World-honored One remained silent, thus granting their  
wish. Having seen that the World-honored One remained silent, the lay devo-  
tees stood up from their seats, circumambulated the Buddha three times, and  
with veneration, they returned [to the city]. At once they built a grand hall  
for the Tathāgata, fixing things here and there, cleaning up, burning incense,  
and respectfully placing a cushion at the main guest seat, they arranged the  
offerings in due order. They then returned to the World-honored One, saying,  
“The place has already been prepared. Whenever your holiness is ready, sir.”  
Thereupon, the World-honored One stood up from his seat, donned his  
_saṃghāṭī_ robe, and with his almsbowl in hand he went into the hall. After

The Buddha said to Ānanda:  
Whoever built this city has received the gods’ approval. During the  
latter half of the night when the dawn was approaching, I went to a  
secluded place [for meditation] and, through my supernormal vision,  
saw high-ranking gods occupying the city and also middle- and lower-  
ranking gods as well. O Ānanda, you should know that when humans  
live at a site that high-ranking gods occupy, their lives will become  
secure and prosperous. Whoever lives at a site that middle-ranking  
gods occupy will be among the middle class of people. The site that  
lower-ranking gods occupy is the section where lower-class people  
live. Even these people have varied degrees of merit; their respective  
prosperity is somehow limited by these conditions.  
O Ānanda, this is a place where the wise may reside, it will also be  
a center where people come for commercial and business transactions,  
and the laws of the state are true and cannot be false. This is the best  
of cities, to be commended by many and not to be destroyed. Should  
this city be destroyed at some future time, it would necessarily be due  
to one of these three causes: first, by a great flood; second, by a great  
fire; or third, by the conspiracy of city residents who side with foreign  
invaders. The city would be destroyed for one of these causes.  
Throughout that night the lay devotees were then engaged in preparation  
of the next day’s provisions. When the preparations were complete, they  
came to the Buddha, announcing, “The morning meal has already been pre-  
pared, sir. Whenever your holiness is ready.”  
Then they set up a dining hall, served food to everyone with their own  
hands, and served water at the end of the meal. Thereupon, they each took  
their small sitting cloths with them and took their seats before the Buddha.  
At once, the World-honored One began to teach them:

There are four profound branches of the Dharma^17 (1) noble precepts,  
(2) noble concentration, (3) noble insight, and (4) noble deliverance.  
These doctrines are subtle and difficult to fathom. If I and you had not  
clearly understood these subjects, we would have been in the endless  
cycle of birth and death.  
Thereupon, having contemplated these subjects, the World-honored One  
continued in verse:

It is the Buddha who alone can differentiate  
The four divisions of the Dharma:  
Moral precepts, mental concentration,  
Analytical insight, and deliverance.  
Liberated from the state of suffering,  
He helps others to come to their conversion and  
To terminate their cycle of birth and death.  
At that time, the World-honored One sojourned in the Koṭigāma village  
as long as he wished. Then he said to Ānanda, “I wish to proceed to the  
village of Nādikā.” Thus instructed, packing the Buddha’s robe and almsbowl  
and carrying them [on his shoulder], Ānanda followed the World-honored  
One together with the other _bhikṣu_ s. Traveling on the highway of Vṛji, he  
reached Nādikā village and rested at a brick resthouse. At that time, Ānanda  
remained in a secluded place and thought to himself:^18

In this village, twelve lay devotees once lived. Their names were: (1)  
Kakkaṭa (or Kakkudha), (2) Kaliṅga, (3) Nikaṭa, (4) Lishu, (5) Sāḷha,  
(6) Poyalou, (7) Potoulou, (8) Subhadra, (9) Tuolishetu, (10) Soudal-  
ishetu, (11) Yaśas, and (12) Yeshuduolou. These people are all dead  
and must have been reborn somewhere. Again, fifty of the people passed  
away. Again, five hundred of them have died. Where have these people  
been reborn?  
Having thought thus, Ānanda arose from his secluded place. Coming to  
the World-honored One, after honoring him by bowing his forehead to his  
feet, he withdrew to one side and said to him:

holy state of stream-enterer, they should be able to exhaust the cause  
of suffering before passing through the seventh return to this human  
world. Also you should share the following:  
O Ānanda, the Dharma mirror refers to the state of unshakable faith  
that every noble disciple should acquire:  
(1) Delighted at heart, every disciple should have faith in the Buddha  
Tathāgata as endowed with the ten titles, such as “one who has totally  
extinguished defilements,” “one who is fully enlightened,” and so forth.  
(2) Delighted at heart, every disciple should not hesitate, whenever  
possible, to inculcate the Dharma that is real and subtle and to show  
the path of nirvana, believing in the testimony of what the knower of  
the path has been practicing.  
(3) Delighted at heart, every disciple should have faith in the Sangha  
whose members are in harmonious cooperation, sincere and direct,  
and without false flattery; in which the fruits of the path are realized;  
in which harmonious obedience is held regarding the teaching between  
the superior and inferior; and in which each of the members respectively  
embodies the Dharma in himself. For, when the members are ready as  
candidates for the state of stream-enterer, they will realize it; when  
they are ready for the state of once-returner ( _sakṛ dā gāmin_ ), they will  
realize it; when they are ready for the state of nonreturner ( _anāgāmin_ ),  
they will realize it; when they are ready for the state of arhat, they will  
realize it.  
(4) Every disciple should have faith in these [holy] men who are  
called the “four pairs of men” or the “eight [distinguished] personal-  
ities,” the wise and holy disciples of the Tathāgata, worthy of honor  
and respect as the best field of the world in which to harvest merit [by  
making offerings to them and serving them]. Every disciple should  
have faith in the body of precepts, pure, genuine, and spotless, neither  
deficient nor missing, adhered to by these wise and holy people. Every  
disciple should have faith in the practice and realization of mental con-  
centration by the bright and sagacious.  
O Ānanda, these are the contents of the Dharma mirror. You should  
tell the noble disciples that if, in their present life, they can annihilate  
the causes for falling into the three evil courses of life and realize the

holy state of stream-enterer, then they should be able to exhaust the  
cause of suffering before passing through the seventh return to this  
world. Also you should tell these things to those [who seriously wish  
to know about them].  
At that time, the World-honored One sojourned in Koṭigāma village as  
long as he wished, and then said to Ānanda, “Let us go to the country of  
Vaiśālī.” Thus, having packed the Buddha’s robe and almsbowl and carrying  
them [on his shoulder], Ānanda followed the World-honored One together  
with other _bhikṣu_ s. Traveling on the highway of Vṛji, the World-honored  
One reached Vaiśālī and took his seat under a tree.  
A courtesan, Ambapālī by name, having heard that the Buddha, accom-  
panied by his disciples, had arrived in Vaiśālī and was resting under the tree,  
at once boarded a carriage to visit the place where the Buddha stayed, wishing  
to venerate him with offerings. Even before reaching the site, she saw the  
World-honored One from a distance, noting his handsome appearance, his  
extraordinary senses, and his eminent marks, as though seeing the moon  
among stars. Delighted at heart, Ambapālī alighted from the carriage and  
approached on foot. She finally reached the place of the Buddha and, having  
honored him by bowing her forehead to his feet, she withdrew to one side  
and took her seat.  
At that time, the World-honored One began to teach the Dharma, encour-  
aging, benefiting, and delighting her. Having listened to the Buddha’s teaching,  
Ambapālī was delighted and said to the Buddha:  
From today, for the first time, I humbly take refuge in the Three Treasures.  
May your holiness grant this wish. I will become an _upāsikā_ (laywoman)  
in order to devote myself to the right Dharma and, until the end of my  
life, will keep my vow not to injure life, not to steal, not to commit sexual  
misconduct, not to tell lies, and not to take intoxicants, sir.  
She again said to the Buddha:  
May I request, World-honored One, that your holiness and the venerable  
disciples accept tomorrow’s meal at my place. And may you take your  
rest for the night in the grove that I own.  

At that time, the World-honored One maintained his silence, thus granting  
her wish. Having realized the Buddha’s silent acceptance, Ambapālī arose  
from her seat, venerated him, and after circumambulating the Buddha,  
departed. Not long after Ambapālī left, the Buddha said to Ānanda: “I am  
ready to go to the grove together with all of you.” Ānanda replied, “Yes, sir.”  
The Buddha stood up from his seat, and carrying his robe and almsbowl him-  
self, he went to Ambapālī’s grove accompanied by one thousand two hundred  
and fifty disciples.  
The Licchavi clanspeople of Vaiśālī, having heard that the Buddha was  
sojourning at Ambapālī’s grove, at once hurriedly set up their carriages dec-  
orated in five colors. Some of them rode a blue carriage drawn by a horse  
colored in blue, wearing blue garments, under a blue canopy with the mark  
of a blue streamer and a blue official ensign. The five colored carriages,  
horses, and so forth were all arranged in a similar manner. The five hundred  
Licchavi clanspeople, whose garments were of variegated colors, then equally  
wished to visit the Buddha.  
After leaving the place of the Buddha, Ambapālī returned alone to her  
home but on the way she encountered the Licchavi clanspeople on the same  
path. Her horse shied and her carriage rubbed against one of the Licchavi  
clansman’s decorated carriages and damaged its canopy and streamer. She  
did not, however, try to turn out of the way of their passage. The Licchavi  
clansman said accusingly:

Under what authority have you not turned out of the way of our passage?  
By bumping into my carriage, you have damaged my canopy and  
streamer.  
Ambapālī replied:  
Gentlemen, I have already requested the Buddha to come to my place  
for tomorrow’s meal. In order to prepare the meals, I am returning  
home. Because of this, I have to make this carriage run as fast as it  
can, not allowing it to turn off from this road, sirs.  
Some Licchavi clanspeople then asked [her]: “Can you set your request  
aside for a while, and give us the opportunity [to make the first offerings to  
the Buddha]? We shall give you one hundred thousand gold pieces for it.”

Ambapālī at once replied, “I am the first to have requested the Buddha  
and it has already been settled. I cannot transfer this opportunity to you, sirs.”  
Then the Licchavi clanspeople again said to [her]: “Then we shall give  
you sixteen times that amount of one hundred thousand gold pieces. Give  
us the first opportunity.”  
Ambapālī still did not agree, asserting, “My request has been granted. I  
cannot transfer it to you, sirs.”  
Then the Licchavi clanspeople said to her again, “We will give you one  
half of the state’s wealth. Let us have the first opportunity.”  
Ambapālī again replied:  
Even if you promise me all the wealth of the state, I am not interested  
in it, sirs. The reason is that the Buddha is sojourning at my grove and  
has accepted my request. This matter has been settled, sirs.  
Thus she refused. All of the Licchavi clanspeople wrung their hands and  
lamented, “Now, because of this woman, we have lost the opportunity to  
make the first offering!” but they proceeded on their way toward the grove.  
At that time, the World-honored One saw from a distance the five hundred  
Licchavi clanspeople approaching the grove, accompanied by tens of thou-  
sands of carriages and horses, filling up the entire roadway. He said to the  
_bhikṣu_ s:  
If you wish to know how the gods of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven play games  
and enjoy their heavenly garden, it would not differ much from the  
oncoming host of visitors in pomp and stateliness. All of you, _bhikṣu_ s,  
should maintain your minds in good unity and present yourselves in a  
dignified manner.  
What, O _bhikṣu_ s, is called good unity of the mind? Here, O _bhikṣu_ s,  
exert yourselves in observing the inner body (i.e., inner senses) in con-  
centration, without slackening, being mindful and remembering your  
observations, thereby discarding worldly desires and worries. Exert  
yourselves also in observing the outer body (i.e., outer senses), without  
slackening, being mindful and remembering your observations, thereby  
discarding worldly desires and worries. [Further,] exert yourselves to  
observe both the inner and outer body, without slackening, being mindful  

and remembering your observations, thereby discarding worldly desires  
and worries. It is the same with observing one’s sensation (senses),  
mind (intellect), and psychophysical elements.  
O _bhikṣu_ s, what then does it mean to not be dignified in respect to  
manners? [It is the opposite of dignified conduct and discipline.] In  
this matter, O _bhikṣu_ s, whatever one should do, he should know how  
to do it. Whatever one should stop, he should know how to stop. Look  
around right and left, bend forward, stretch back, look downward and  
look upward, holding the robe and almsbowl; you should not lose the  
[dignified] manner of eating and drinking hot water and medicine;  
applying properly expedient means, you should remove obstacles,  
keeping your mind intact in silence without [letting it become] scattered,  
whether walking, stopping, sitting, lying down, sleeping, or speaking.  
Such a one is called a _bhikṣu_ who is well endowed with dignified man-  
ners and discipline.  
The five hundred Licchavi clanspeople reached the grove owned by  
Ambapālī and, having alighted from their carriages, proceeded on foot toward  
the place of the Buddha. After honoring him by bowing their foreheads to  
his feet, they withdrew to one side to take their seats. The Tathāgata, abiding  
on his seat, cast his aura of authority and holiness over the entire assembly,  
just as the autumnal moon casts its light, and also as the sun alone shines  
brightly from midair through a clear sky, onto the clean ground with no speck  
of dust whatsoever.  
At that time, while his seat was surrounded by the five hundred Licchavi  
clanspeople who sat on the ground, the Buddha alone amid the entire assembly  
revealed his holy illumination. At that time, there was a _brāhmaṇa,_ Piṅgiyānī  
by name, among the assembly. He suddenly stood up from his seat, rearranged  
his garments to expose his right shoulder, and with his right knee touching  
the ground and both palms held together in respect, praised the Buddha in  
verse:

of crisis recur and how to rescue others from disasters. Such a person  
is difficult to find. These are the five treasures most difficult to obtain.  
Then, having listened to the teaching of the Buddha, the five hundred Lic-  
chavi clanspeople were delighted and said to the Buddha, “We humbly wish,  
O World-honored One, that your holiness and the venerable disciples accept  
our invitation.”  
The Buddha replied to the Licchavi clanspeople:  
Dear noblemen, you have invited me and I have now already accepted  
your offerings. Ambapālī made an invitation in advance, and this has  
already been accepted by the Buddha, hence it still stands.  
When all the Licchavi clanspeople heard this, each of the five hundred  
clanspeople wrung his hands and expressed regret, saying, “While we wished  
to make our offerings to the Tathāgata and his party, this woman has already  
taken the first auspicious opportunity.” At once they rose from their seats  
and, having honored the Buddha by bowing their foreheads to his feet, they  
circumambulated the Buddha and departed.  
During the night, Ambapālī prepared various foods for the next day’s  
offering. The next morning, when the time came, the World-honored One,  
surrounded by one thousand two hundred and fifty disciples, each neatly  
dressed in the _saṃghāṭī_ robe and with almsbowl in hand, arrived at the place  
they had been invited to and took a seat in the prepared position.  
Thereupon, Ambapālī set forth superb foods for the Buddha as well as  
the members of the sangha. When the meal was over, the bowls were set  
aside and the tables were removed. Ambapālī then carried a golden pitcher  
to serve water for washing. As she stepped forward toward the Buddha she  
said to him:

the nature of the Dharma, realized the Dharma as she envisioned it, became  
determined to abide in the right path without falling into any evil course, and  
thus attained the state of fearlessness. Thereupon, Ambapālī said to the  
Buddha, “Now I humbly take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.”  
After repeating the words of her vow, she said:

May your holiness grant me permission to become a lay devotee. From  
now until the end of my life, I will not injure life, nor steal, nor indulge  
in sexual misconduct, nor lie, nor drink intoxicating liquor.  
Therewith, Ambapālī received the five precepts from the Buddha. Casting  
away her earlier trade, she annihilated all unclean stains, and arising from  
her seat, she venerated the Buddha and departed.  
At that time, the World-honored One sojourned in Vaiśālī as long as he  
wished, and then said to Ānanda, “You are doing well [in the life of daily  
practice]. I wish to proceed to Beluva-gāma.” Having answered, “Yes, sir,”  
Ānanda packed the Buddha’s robe and almsbowl, and carrying them on his  
shoulder he followed the World-honored One with other the _bhikṣu_ s. Traveling  
on the highway of Vṛji, the World-honored One reached the bamboo forest  
of the village.  
There was a _brāhmaṇa,_ Pishatuoya by name. Having heard that the  
Buddha, accompanied by his disciples, had arrived at the bamboo forest, he  
thought to himself in contemplation:

This _śramaṇa_ Gautama is renowned of name and virtue in all regions.  
He is [perfectly] endowed with the ten supreme titles and has excelled  
beyond all the heavenly beings, such as Indra, Brahmā, [Māra], the  
Lord of Evil, and the evil ones ( _deva-māra_ s), the _śramaṇa_ s, and the  
_brāhmaṇa_ s, in his direct experience of deliverance, and has ever since  
continued to teach the Dharma. Whatever he says at the beginning, in  
the middle, as well as at the end, is true and right and is profoundly  
subtle in its meaning, and matches his practice of austerity. It will be  
good for me to see such a perfected person free from all attachment.  
Then the _brāhmaṇa_ came out of the bamboo forest and came to the place  
where the World-honored One stayed and, having greeted him with a bow,  
he took a seat at one side.

“Call all the _bhikṣu_ s residing in this country and assemble them in the meeting  
hall.”  
Ānanda answered, “Yes, sir,” and released the message far and near to  
call [all the _bhikṣu_ s] to assemble at the hall. Thereupon, all the _bhikṣu_ s residing  
in that country came to assemble, and Ānanda reported to the Buddha, “The  
_bhikṣu_ s have assembled, sir. May your holiness be ready.”  
At that time, the World-honored One rose from his seat, reached the hall,  
and, having taken his seat in the prepared position, said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

It is a time of famine in this land, and it is difficult to obtain almsfood.  
All of you form groups and go to Vaiśālī or the country of Vṛji to rely  
on your friends and relatives. If you settle there for the duration of the  
summer retreat, you may not have to face the difficulty of food shortage.  
I alone will remain here with Ānanda to arrange the summer retreat.  
The reason for sending you away is that I foresee food scarcity as well  
as other things here.  
Thereupon, the _bhikṣu_ s at once departed as instructed for their respective  
destinations.  
The Buddha alone remained in that country with Ānanda. Later on, during  
the summer retreat, the Buddha experienced physical ailment with pains  
throughout his body. He attentively spoke to himself:

Now I have got an illness and my whole body hurts very severely. But  
all the disciples are not here. It would not be good if I were to take the  
course of death here. For the time being, I must exert myself to prolong  
my life.  
At that time, the World-honored One came out of his secluded room and  
took his seat in a cool spot. Having seen his appearance, Ānanda quickly  
approached him and said to the Buddha, “As I see your holiness now, you  
look to be suffering from an illness, sir.”

the same with observing one’s sense perceptions, mind (intellect), and  
psychophysical elements.  
This is what I mean by making oneself one’s own light, making the  
Dharma one’s light, but not making anything else one’s light; to rely  
on oneself as one’s refuge, to rely on the Dharma as one’s refuge, but  
not to rely on anything else as one’s refuge.  
The Buddha said to Ānanda:  
If there is anyone who would really be able to practice this discipline,  
he surely would be the primary practitioner of the path among all my  
disciples.  
The Buddha said to Ānanda, “We shall go to the Cāpāla shrine.”  
“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. The Buddha stood up, donned the _saṃghāṭī_  
robe, and with his almsbowl in hand, reached the shade of a tree. He said to  
Ānanda, “Spread my sitting cloth. My back hurts. I wish to rest here.”  
“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda, and he at once spread the sitting cloth. The  
Tathāgata took his seat and Ānanda also set up a small seat and sat before  
him. The Buddha said to Ānanda:

There are those who practice the four kinds of supernormal power.  
While practicing these powers, they are always mindful of these prac-  
tices so as to keep them in good memory. When one so desires, he can  
prolong his life on the basis of his power for as long as the remaining  
duration of the current eon.  
O Ānanda, the Buddha has already practiced these four supernormal  
powers on many occasions and, being mindful of these experiences,  
he does not forget the use of them. If it is necessary, the Tathāgata can  
extend his life span for the remaining duration of the present eon, so  
that he may remove darkness, benefit the world, and make heavenly  
gods happier.  
At that time, Ānanda remained silent and did not respond. The Buddha  
repeated these words three times, but Ānanda still remained silent. At that  
time Ānanda was obstructed by the Evil One and did not understand the  
Buddha’s words. After three repetitions the Buddha suggested that he respond,

At that time, O Tathāgata, you replied to me, saying “Stop, Evil  
One, I, myself, know the right time. I, the Tathāgata, will not take the  
course of entering nirvana. When a good number of disciples has assem-  
bled, and so forth, even allowing the heavenly beings to witness the  
mystery of the Dharma, only then I will take the course of entering  
nirvana.”  
O Enlightened One, now you have acquired many disciples and the  
heavenly beings have all witnessed the mystery of the Dharma. Now  
is the right time. Why are you not taking the course of entering nir-  
vana?  
The Buddha said:  
Stop, Evil One! The Buddha himself knows the right time. I will not  
abide for a long time. Three months from now, at the spot between two  
_śāla_ trees near Kuśinagara, the original place of the Mallan clan, I shall  
take the course of entering final nirvana.  
Then the Evil One quickly thought to himself, “The Buddha does not lie.  
He will surely enter nirvana soon.” Dancing and jumping for joy, he suddenly  
disappeared.  
Not too long after the Evil One had departed, the Buddha exerted himself  
to concentrate on volitional concentration at the Cāpāla shrine solely to extend  
his life span. Exactly at that time, the great earth trembled and all the people  
of that country were stricken with fear; there were none whose hair did not  
stand on end. The Buddha emitted a great ray of light that penetrated every-  
where without limitation, even illuminating the dark underworld, thus enabling  
the beings therein to see each other. At that time, the World-honored One  
uttered these words in verse:

Of the two divisions of the conditioned and the unconditioned,  
I have now forsaken the conditioned,  
Abiding solely in the state of concentration;  
Like a chick coming out of the shell.  
At that time, wise Ānanda, with a frightened mind, his hair standing on  
end, quickly approached the Buddha. Having honored the Buddha by bowing

At that time, the Buddha continued in verse:

#### Second Episode

The Buddha said to Ānanda:

could discuss well, I too could discuss equally as well as they. What-  
ever subject matter they could not discuss, I could discuss. O Ānanda,  
I taught them the Dharma extensively, benefiting and delighting  
them. I died while I was among them, but they believed that I was  
a heavenly god and did not realize that I was actually a human. In  
this way, I mingled with the followers of the god Brahmā and,  
through incalculable times back and forth [through transmigration],  
extensively taught the Dharma to the heavenly gods, and yet no one  
knew who I really was.  
Ānanda said to the Buddha:  
It is marvelous, sir. O World-honored One, no one ever, before your  
holiness, could accomplish such [great] tasks as those accomplished  
by the World-honored One, sir.  
The Buddha continued:  
This subtle, delicate, and rare Dharma, O Ānanda, is exceedingly unique  
and has never before been realized by anyone. Only the Tathāgata alone  
could realize this Dharma.  
Again he spoke to Ānanda:  
The Tathāgata alone knows the nature of the arising, abiding, and per-  
ishing of sensation; he alone knows the nature of the arising, abiding,  
and perishing of ideation; he alone knows the nature of the arising,  
abiding, and perishing of analytical introspection. This is the unique,  
never-before-realized Dharma, which the Tathāgata alone has accom-  
plished. You should take this Dharma to heart and make it work for  
yourself.  
At that time, the World-honored One said to Ānanda, “Let us go to the  
Kūṭāgāra hall (near Vaiśālī).” He then sat on the sitting cloth spread under a  
tree. The Buddha said to Ānanda, “Go and tell the _bhikṣu_ s residing in the  
right and left quarters of the Kūṭāgāra [hall], without missing anyone, to  
assemble in the meeting hall.”  
As instructed, Ānanda assembled all the _bhikṣu_ s in the hall and reported  
to the Buddha, “All the _bhikṣu_ s have assembled, sir. May your holiness be

ready.” Thereupon, the World-honored One at once went to the hall, took his  
seat in the prepared position, and said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

Having heard these words, all the _bhikṣu_ s were terror-stricken, shocked,  
and confused; some threw themselves to the ground. One cried out in a loud  
voice, “How is it that the Buddha will take the course of cessation so soon?”  
Another mourned, “How sad it is that Eye of Insight of the world goes to  
cessation! Without his holiness, we will wither away over time.” Some _bhikṣu_ s  
cried in sorrow and stamped [their feet] in grief, twisting their bodies and  
wailing, totally out of control, just as a snake that has had its head cut off  
twists and wriggles without knowing where it is going.  
The Buddha said to them:  
O _bhikṣu_ s, halt your wailing a moment. You should not be overwhelmed  
by sorrow. There is no one in the entire world, whether one is in heaven,  
on earth, or among human beings, who does not perish once born. No  
matter how hard one wishes to halt conditioned things from changing,  
one cannot do so. I have previously taught you that whomever you  
love, whomever you find endearing, all such is impermanent; whoever  
meets with another will after all become separated. The physical body  
is not one’s possession. Life does not continue to exist forever.  
Thereupon, the World-honored One continued in verse:  
Now I am free to take my course  
Reaching the place of peace and quiescence.  
Hence, I have assembled the members of the sangha  
To tell them what I mean.  
I am aged, having no more years to live.  
I have accomplished that which should be done.  
Now I am ready to forsake my life.  
Being mindful, without slackening,  
I have been steadfast with the precepts of the _bhikṣu_ s.  
Keeping myself intact by concentrating on my volition,  
I protect my mind [from scattering].  
Whoever is steady, without slackening,  
With the Dharma I have taught,  
Can annihilate the root cause of suffering,  
Thus overcoming the fate of birth, old age, and death.

end. I emitted a great ray of light that penetrated everywhere without  
limitation, even illuminating the dark underworld, thus enabling the  
beings therein to see each other.  
At that time, I uttered the following words in verse:  
Of the two divisions of the conditioned and the unconditioned,  
I have now forsaken the conditioned,  
Abiding solely in the state of concentration;  
Like a chick coming out of the shell.  
At that time, Venerable Ānanda stood up from his seat, rearranged his  
robe to expose the right shoulder, knelt with his right knee touching the  
ground, and with his palms joined together, said to the Buddha:

O World-honored One, we request that your holiness remain in this  
world by extending your life span until the fulfillment of the present  
eon, not taking the course of final nirvana. With compassion for all  
sentient beings, may your holiness benefit gods and humans.  
At that time, the World-honored One remained silent, without responding.  
Ānanda repeated his request in the same manner three times. Thereupon, the  
Buddha said to Ānanda, “Do you believe in the path through which the Tathā-  
gata realized supreme enlightenment?”  
He replied, “Yes, sir. I believe in the word of the Buddha.”  
The Buddha continued:  
If you believe in it, why have you approached to press me three times?  
You heard it closely from me and closely received instruction from me  
before, namely:  
There are those who practice four kinds of supernormal power.  
While practicing these powers, they are always mindful of these  
practices so as to keep them in good memory. When one so desires,  
he can prolong his life on the basis of his power for as long as the  
remaining duration of the current eon. O Ānanda, the Buddha has  
already practiced these four supernormal powers on many occasions  
and, being mindful of these experiences, he does not forget the use  
of them. If it is necessary, the Tathāgata can extend his life span

for the remaining duration of the present eon, so that he may remove  
darkness, benefit the world, and make heavenly gods happier.  
At that time, why didn’t you repeat your request asking me not to take  
the course of final nirvana? Your wish could have been fulfilled if you  
had inquired twice, or up to a third time. You could have requested me  
at that time to extend my life span for the remaining duration of the  
present eon, thereby removing darkness, benefiting the world, and  
making heavenly gods happier. You have now made this request, but  
isn’t it foolish? I expressed my intention three times, yet you remained  
silent throughout. Why didn’t you ask me at that time, “May the Tathā-  
gata extend his life for the remaining duration of the present eon,  
thereby removing darkness and benefiting the world”?  
Nay, do not press me any more, Ānanda. I have already forsaken the  
span of my life. I have discarded it and vomited it out. Even if you urge  
the Tathāgata to contradict his own word, you know that it is of no avail.  
It is as if a wealthy man has vomited food upon the ground. How and  
why would he retrieve the food once vomited upon the ground?  
Ānanda replied, “There is no reason, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued:]  
It is the same with the Tathāgata. He has forsaken it and already vomited  
it out. How and why should you ask him to retrieve what he has already  
forsaken?  
The Buddha said to Ānanda, “Let us go to Ambala village.” Packing up  
the Buddha’s robe and almsbowl [and carrying them on his shoulder], Ānanda  
followed the World-honored One together with the other _bhikṣu_ s. Traveling  
on the highway of Vṛji, he reached Ambala village and sojourned in a forest  
on a hill.  
At that time, the World-honored One taught the _bhikṣu_ s the three [main]  
branches of training: (1) moral precepts ( _śīla_ ), (2) mental concentration  
( _samādhi_ ), and (3) [analytical] insight ( _prajñā_ ):

experience of mental concentration and applying analytical insight,  
you may acquire great reward. Being steadfast with the application of  
analytical insight and realizing the purity of your mind, you may acquire  
perfect deliverance and extinguish three kinds of defilements, namely:  
defilement due to carnal desire, defilement due to existential desire,  
and defilement due to ignorance. When one has realized deliverance,  
he acquires a subsequent insight of his realization ( _vimukti-jñāna_ ):  
“Whoever has exhausted [the cause of] birth and death, accomplished  
the goal of the practice of austerity, and completed that which should  
be done [in life], to him there will be no more birth after this life.”  
At that time, the World-honored One sojourned in Ambala village as long  
as he wished. [Then] the Buddha said to Ānanda, “You are doing well [in  
the life of daily practice]. I wish to visit the villages of Jambugrāma, Bhāṇḍa-  
grāma, Hastigrāma, and then the town of Bhoganagara.”  
Ānanda replied, “Yes, sir,” and packing up the Buddha’s robe and almsbowl  
at once, he followed him together with the host of other _bhikṣu_ s. Traveling  
on the highway of Vṛji, gradually visiting those places, they finally reached  
the forest of _śiṃśapā_ trees north of the town of Bhoganagara and sojourned  
there.  
The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s, “I shall introduce you to four principles  
of great importance. Listen attentively, you should contemplate and remember  
[what I shall now say].” The _bhikṣu_ s responded, “Yes, sir. We are delighted  
and ready to listen to the teaching, sir.”  
The Buddha began to teach:  
What are the four [principles]? Suppose a _bhikṣu_ (or a group of _bhikṣu_ s)  
asserts a certain matter by saying, “At such-and-such village or town  
or country, I listened directly to the word of the Buddha and received  
directly from him this doctrine, this discipline, or this teaching.” Even  
so, you should neither believe it nor reject it unless whatever is asserted  
is examined to be true in reference to the scriptures, the rules of dis-  
cipline, or in reference to its origin and adaptation with the system of  
authentic belief. If it is neither in accord with the scriptures, nor with  
the rules of discipline, nor with the system of authentic belief, you

accords with the scriptures, the rules of discipline, and the system of  
authentic belief, you should say to him, “What you have previously  
asserted is truly the Buddha’s teaching, because we have examined it in  
reference to the scriptures, the rules of discipline, and the system of authen-  
tic belief. Venerable, you should hold it and teach it widely for the sake  
of others. You should be careful not to discard it.” This is the second prin-  
ciple of great importance.  
Again next, O _bhikṣu_ s, when a _bhikṣu_ (or a group of _bhikṣu_ s) asserts  
a certain matter concerning the doctrinal teaching and the moral dis-  
cipline, saying, “At such-and-such village or town or country, I listened  
directly to the words of a group of learned elders who uphold the doc-  
trinal teaching, the rules of discipline, and the maintenance of model  
restraints and received directly from them this doctrine, this moral dis-  
cipline, and this teaching.” Even so, you should not respond to this  
similar case by saying, “Venerable, we should examine whether what  
you assert is true or false in reference to the scriptures and clarify its  
origin and adaptation on the basis of the doctrine and the discipline.”  
If what is asserted is neither in accordance with the scriptures, nor with  
the rules of discipline, nor with the system of authentic belief, then  
you should say to him, “The Buddha did not teach this particular thing  
that you have previously asserted. You may have heard it from the  
group of _bhikṣu_ s erroneously. The reason is that our understanding in  
reference to the scriptures, the rules of discipline, and the system of  
authentic belief is different from what you have previously asserted.  
Venerable, you should not keep it, nor should you teach it to others;  
you should discard it.” If, however, what he has asserted is in accordance  
with the scriptures, the rules of discipline, and the system of authentic  
belief, you should say to him, “What you have previously asserted is  
truly the Buddha’s teaching, as we examined it in reference to the scrip-  
tures, the rules of discipline, and the system of authentic belief. Ven-  
erable, you should hold it and teach it widely for the sake of others.  
You should be careful not to discard it.” This is the third principle of  
great importance.  
Again next, when a _bhikṣu_ (or a group of _bhikṣu_ s) asserts that “At  
such-and-such village or town or country, I listened directly to the words

of a _bhikṣu_ about this doctrine, this rule of discipline, and the maintenance  
of model restraints, and received directly from him this doctrine, this  
moral discipline, and this teaching.” Even so, you should not respond  
to this similar case by saying, “Venerable, we should examine whether  
what you assert is true or false in reference to the scriptures, and clarify  
its origin and adaptation on the basis of the doctrine and the discipline.”  
If what he previously asserted does not accord with the scriptures, nor  
with the rules of discipline, nor with the system of authentic belief, you  
should say to him, “The Buddha did not teach this particular thing that  
you have previously asserted. You may have heard it from the group of  
_bhikṣu_ s erroneously. The reason is that our understanding in reference  
to the scriptures, the rules of discipline, and the system of authentic belief  
differs from what you have previously asserted. Venerable, you should  
not keep it, nor should you teach it to others; you should discard it.” If,  
however, what he has asserted is in accordance with the scriptures, the  
rules of discipline, and the system of authentic belief, you should say to  
him, “What you have previously asserted is truly the Buddha’s teaching,  
as we examined it in reference to the scriptures, the rules of discipline,  
and the system of authentic belief. Venerable, you should hold it and  
teach it widely for the sake of others. You should be careful not to discard  
it.” This is the fourth principle of great importance.  
At that time, the World-honored One sojourned at the town of Bhoganagara  
as long as he wished, and then said to Venerable Ānanda, “Let us go to the  
city of Pāvā.” Having replied, “Yes, sir,” Ānanda packed the Buddha’s robe  
and almsbowl and followed the World-honored One together with the host  
of other _bhikṣu_ s. Traveling on the highway of the Mallan country, he reached  
Dutou Grove near the city of Pāvā.  
There was then a son of a blacksmith, Cunda by name. Having heard that  
the Buddha had arrived in the city by way of the Mallan highway, he dressed  
up and visited the place where the Buddha sojourned and, after honoring  
him by touching his forehead to the Buddha’s feet, he withdrew and sat to  
one side. The Buddha then began to teach Cunda the Dharma, encouraging  
him, benefiting him, and delighting him. After the Buddha’s teaching, his  
heart filled with faith and delight, Cunda said to the World-honored One,  

“May your holiness accept my invitation to the next day’s meal.” Thereupon  
the Buddha accepted [Cunda’s offer by] remaining silent.  
Having noted that the Buddha had accepted his request, Cunda rose from  
his seat, and after venerating the Buddha, he returned home. During the night  
he prepared various provisions consisting of rice and other food for the morn-  
ing meal. The following day, at the proper time [after the announcement:]  
“May the Buddha be ready,” the World-honored One donned his _saṃghāṭī_  
robe and, with his almsbowl in hand, surrounded by the host of _bhikṣu_ s,  
arrived at the house and took his seat in the prepared position.  
Thereupon, Cunda set forth food and drink, offering them to the Buddha  
and the members of the sangha. He had separately cooked mushrooms grown  
on the roots of a _sandal_ tree ( _sūkara-maddava_ ),^19 known as a rare delicacy,  
and offered this dish only to the World-honored One. The Buddha said to  
Cunda, “Refrain from serving this food to the _bhikṣu_ s.” As instructed, Cunda  
did not serve that food to the _bhikṣu_ s. Then an elderly _bhikṣu,_ who had  
renounced family life at a late age, put the remainder of the food onto a sep-  
arate plate. At that time, having observed that all the _bhikṣu_ s had finished  
the meal, Cunda removed the food vessels and served water. Thereupon, he  
asked the Buddha in verse:

Hide recklessness within.  
[Therefore], by merely seeing the external appearance,  
One should not be drawn toward anyone  
Trusting them without caution.  
Because even if some  
Do not leave any trace of external wickedness,  
They may retain recklessness within.  
At that time, taking a small seat with him, Cunda approached and sat  
before the Buddha. The Buddha began to teach the Dharma and, having thus  
benefited and delighted [Cunda], he left the house, surrounded by the host  
of _bhikṣu_ s. On the roadway the Buddha stopped under a tree and said to  
Ānanda, “My shoulder pain is pressing me. Spread my sitting cloth on the  
ground.”  
[Ānanda] answered, “Yes, sir,” at once spread the sitting cloth, and the  
World-honored One took his seat on it. Then Ānanda spread his small sitting  
cloth and sat before the Buddha. The Buddha said to him: “Have you noticed  
any appearance of regret in Cunda? If he has a sense of regret, what do you  
think caused it?” Ānanda said to the Buddha:

The Buddha said to Pukkusa:

Pukkusa replied:

accepted it out of compassion. Then Pukkusa, having venerated the Buddha,  
stayed to one side. The Buddha began to teach the Dharma, encouraging, ben-  
efiting, and delighting him by expounding upon the doctrines of (1) charity,  
(2) morality, (3) rebirth in heaven, (4) abandoning unclean and impure desires  
as a great danger, (5) determining that any ongoing defilement from passion  
is an obstacle, and (6) the commendability and necessity of the path of dis-  
tancing oneself from both suffering and pleasure as the best [step toward the  
spiritual goal].  
The Buddha then observed that Pukkusa’s mind was filled with joy, had  
become receptive without hindrance, and was ready to be educated. In accor-  
dance with the rule of all buddhas, he taught Pukkusa (1) the doctrine of the  
noble truth of suffering and the remaining three truths: (2) the truth of the cause  
of suffering, (3) the truth of the cessation of suffering, and (4) the truth of the  
path of cessation. At that time, Pukkusa, with pure and genuine faith, like a  
white cloth that can easily be dyed any color, immediately in that single session  
[at his seat] removed himself from all defilement and acquired genuine insight  
into the nature of the Dharma; realized the Dharma as he envisioned it; became  
determined to abide in the right path, without falling into any evil course; and  
thus attained the state of fearlessness. He then said to the Buddha:

Now, I humbly take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. May  
your holiness grant me permission to become a lay devotee. From now  
on until my life ends, I will not harm life, steal, indulge in sexual mis-  
conduct, lie, or ingest intoxicants. May your holiness grant me per-  
mission to become a lay devotee.  
Again he said to the Buddha:  
If your holiness should visit or sojourn in Pāvā, may you pass by the  
poverty-stricken houses and proceed directly to my residence. Whatever  
I have in my house, food and drink, couch and bed, garment and cloth,  
hot water and medicine, will be ready for use in the service of the  
World-honored One. If your holiness accepts my humble charity, my  
household will be blessed, becoming safe and peaceful, sir.  
The Buddha said, “What you have said is good.” At that time, the World-  
honored One [further] taught the Dharma to Pukkusa, encouraging, benefiting,

The Buddha said to Ānanda, “I feel thirsty. I need water. Please go and  
fetch some.” Ānanda replied:

A while ago, five hundred carriages crossed the river upstream, causing  
the water to become muddy, and it has not returned to its normal trans-  
parency, sir. It can be used for washing the feet but not for drinking, sir.  
In this manner, the Buddha asked him three times, “O Ānanda, please go  
and fetch water.” Ānanda replied: “Not too far from here there is a river called  
Kakuṭṭhā, the water of which is clean and cool and can be used for drinking  
as well as for bathing, sir.” Then a spirit that resided in the Himalaya mountains,  
a believer in the Buddhist path, immediately scooped up clean water of eight  
qualities with a bowl and offered it to the World-honored One. With compas-  
sion, the Buddha received [the water] and uttered the following verses:

The [Tathāgata,] highest among humans,  
Replied to him:  
“You have done what should be done.  
Now is the right time.”  
[Having] obtained his permission,  
Cundaka doubled his exertion in concentration and  
Thus accomplished total cessation.  
He was gone, like a flame that has been extinguished.  
Thereupon, Ānanda stood up from his seat, stepped forward, and enquired  
of the Buddha, “How should the funeral rite be conducted after the nirvana  
of the Buddha, sir?” The Buddha replied, “You should instead be quietly  
concerned with what you should accomplish [in your religious life]. Leave  
the matter to the lay devotees who themselves wish to conduct it.” Ānanda,  
however, asked him again three times, “How should the funeral rite be con-  
ducted after the nirvana of the Buddha, sir?” The Buddha replied,

If you wish to know the funeral rite for the Buddha, you should conduct  
it exactly as you would conduct the rite for a universal ruler.  
Ānanda again asked, “How should the funeral rite for the universal ruler  
be conducted, sir?” The Buddha said to Ānanda:

new cotton cloth, wrap it in a cloth equally as long as five hundred  
pairs of garments, place the body within a golden coffin, pour sesame  
oil over it, place the golden coffin inside a second, larger iron vault,  
cover it with a sandalwood vault, cover that vault with a thick pile of  
various incense, and then cremate the entire thing. After retrieving my  
ashes, build a commemorative tower or shrine at each major crossroads  
and hang my picture on a rock pillar set before it, so as to enable who-  
ever passes on the road to view the Buddha’s tower, refreshing his  
sense of affectionate regard for the religious deed accomplished by the  
Tathāgata, and encouraging him to strive for his own goal of happiness  
in life when born into this world, and to obtain the opportunity to be  
reborn in heaven when he dies.  
Then the World-honored One contemplated the matter once more and  
uttered the following verses:

Whoever comes to venerate and  
Pay respect to the tower  
Will acquire immeasurable merit.  
The Buddha said to Ānanda,  
There are four kinds of [supreme] personalities in the world, for whom  
a commemorative tower (stupa) should be erected, and for whom offer-  
ings of incense, flowers, images, canopies, song and dance, and food  
should be made. What are these four? They are, first, the Tathāgata,  
for whom the commemorative tower should be erected; second, the  
solitary buddha ( _pratyekabuddha_ ); third, the saintly disciple ( _śrāvaka_ );  
and fourth, the universal ruler ( _cakravartin_ ). These are the four kinds  
of personalities for whom the commemorative tower should be erected,  
and the rite of offering incense, flowers, images, canopies, song and  
dance, and food should be conducted.  
At that time, the World-honored One continued in verse:  
The Buddha should be commemorated  
In the primary tower, and  
Then follow the _pratyekabuddha,_  
The _śrāvaka_ buddha, and  
The universal ruler ( _cakravartin_ ).  
For these four towers,  
Administered under the authority of the primary one,  
There should be conducted offering rites.  
The Tathāgata referred thus to the stupas of the Buddha,  
The _pratyekabuddha,_ the _śrāvaka_ buddha, and  
The universal ruler ( _cakravartin_ ).  
At that time, the World-honored One said to Ānanda, “Let us go to the  
town of Kuśinagara, to the spot between two _śāla_ trees.” Replying, “Yes,  
sir,” Ānanda together with the host of _bhikṣu_ s surrounded him and proceeded  
on the road. Then a _brāhmaṇa_ who happened to be on the road between the  
towns of Pāvā and Kuśinagara saw the World-honored One from a distance  
and observed his handsome appearance, senses well restrained in sublime

quiescence. Delighted in heart and with good intent, he approached the  
Buddha and, after greeting him, withdrew to one side and said to him:

O World-honored One, the village of my residence is not too far from  
this place. May I request, O Gautama, that you sojourn overnight  
there, and after partaking of the morning meal proceed to the town of  
Kuśinagara.  
The Buddha replied to the _brāhmaṇa,_ “May you ask me no more. Your  
offering has already been made.” The _brāhmaṇa,_ however, respectfully repeated  
his request three times. The Buddha replied as before, but advised the _brāh-  
maṇa,_ “Ānanda is coming along behind me. Speak to him about your wish.”  
Thereupon, as instructed, the _brāhmaṇa_ immediately went to Ānanda. After  
greeting him with a bow, he withdrew to one side and said to him:

The village of my residence is not far from here. I humbly wish that  
Gautama accept my invitation to visit there for my offering. After the  
morning meal, his holiness may proceed to the town of Kuśinagara.  
Ānanda replied, “Ask no more. O _brāhmaṇa,_ your offering has already  
been fully appreciated.” The _brāhmaṇa,_ however, again respectfully repeated  
his invitation [for a second and] third time. Ānanda replied:

The weather is already hot, and the village is too far from the road.  
Since the World-honored One is exhausted, it is no longer feasible to  
[continue to ask] him about it.  
At that time, the World-honored One envisioned what was going on and  
uttered the following verse:

“The village of my residence is in this neighborhood.  
With compassion, may your holiness come to stay overnight.  
I shall set forth the next day’s meal in the morning.  
Thereafter, may your holiness take the course toward town.”  
[The Buddha said:]  
“O _brāhmaṇa,_ my body is exhausted.  
It is too far for me to go that way.  
My close attendant is coming behind.  
May you go and speak to him.”  
As instructed, the _brāhmaṇa_  
Came to Ānanda at once and  
Said to him:  
“I just invited the Buddha to come to my village, and  
After the next day’s meal  
Leave upon his journey, sir.”  
Ānanda said:  
“Please, ask no more.  
The weather is already hot, and  
It is not feasible for the World-honored One  
To visit your residence.”  
The _brāhmaṇa_ repeated his wish three times, but in vain.  
[The Buddha said:]  
“No one is free from worry and affliction,  
Nor can he be satisfied or at ease,  
Ah! With these conditioned elements ( _saṃskṛta-dharma_ s) so  
evanescent,  
Never remaining unchanged.  
Now, at the spot between the pair of _śāla_ trees,  
I shall extinguish this body  
Though already free from defilement ( _anāsrava-kāya_ ).  
The Buddha, _pratyekabuddha, śrāvaka,_  
All equally return to this nirvana,  
Because there is no other choice  
With the way in which the world is impermanent  
Like a forest ablaze with fire.

At that time, having reached the town of Kuśinagara, the World-honored  
One proceeded through the original land of the Mallan clanspeople toward  
the pair of _śāla_ trees, and he instructed Ānanda:

Set up my bedding between the pair of _śāla_ trees, with my head to the  
north and facing toward the west. For my teaching will spread toward  
the north and flourish there for some time.  
With his answer, Ānanda spread the sitting cloth on the ground with the  
head toward the north. At that time, the World-honored One folded his  
_saṃghāṭī_ robe into four layers by himself, lay down on his right side, and  
placed his left foot on top of the right, like a lion. Then the tree spirits abiding  
between the twin _śāla_ trees, with their firm faith in the Buddha, scattered  
flowers that were blooming out of season. At that moment the World-honored  
One said to Ānanda: “These spirits of the twin _śāla_ trees made an offering  
of flowers blooming out of season. This is not a true offering for the Tathāgata,  
however.” Ānanda enquired, “What kind of things are regarded as true offer-  
ings for the Tathāgata, sir?” [The Buddha] answered, “When a person receives  
the Dharma well and practices it well, this is regarded as a true offering for  
the Tathāgata.” Having contemplated on the meaning of this, the Buddha  
uttered the following verses:

With the five aggregates,  
This is the best, primary offering.”  
At that time, Venerable Upavāna was sitting before the Buddha, fanning  
him. The Buddha said to him, “Upavāna, leave the place where you are and  
make that space open.” Then Ānanda quietly thought to himself:

Upavāna has always been by the Buddha’s side, serving him with what-  
ever he needed. He is so devoted to the Tathāgata that he never tires  
of looking at him. Now this is the Buddha’s last moment; he should  
be permitted to see his last moment. The Buddha, however, asks him  
to leave his position. What is his reason for doing that?  
Thinking thus, Ānanda rearranged his robe, proceeded forward, and said  
to the Buddha:

The Buddha replied to Ānanda:  
During the period ninety-one eons ago, there appeared a buddha in this  
world, Vipaśyin by name. This _bhikṣu_ then, with delight in his heart,  
held a grass torch to illuminate the commemorative tower of that  
buddha. Because of this deed, now his aura of authority and virtue  
reaches the twenty-eighth level of the heavens, making the gods of the  
lower heavens unable to compete with him in splendor.  
At that time, Ānanda rose from his seat, rearranged his robe to expose his  
right shoulder, respectfully knelt with his right knee on the ground, and, with  
his palms joined together, said to the Buddha:

wall endowed with a silver gate [on the first side]; a silver wall endowed  
with a golden gate [on the second]; a lapis lazuli wall endowed with a  
quartz gate [on the third]; and a quartz wall endowed with a lapis lazuli  
gate [on the fourth side]. The railings inlaid in these four sides were  
also embellished with the same four precious materials. To the golden  
tower were attached silver bells, to the silver tower were attached golden  
bells, while the seven moats were filled with all kinds of lotus flowers:  
blue, pink, red, and white. Golden sands spread in the depths of the  
water revealed the bottom of the moats, while palm trees were planted  
on those narrow banks. These golden palm trees bore leaves, flowers  
and fruits made of silver; the silver palm trees bore leaves, flowers, and  
fruits made of gold; likewise, the palm trees made of quartz bore flowers  
and fruits made of lapis lazuli, while the lapis lazuli palm trees bore  
flowers, and fruits made of quartz. Between these palm trees there were  
a number of bathing ponds with clean streams, deep pools, all pure and  
spotless, demarcated by tiles studded with the four precious materials.  
There were golden stairways with silver steps, silver stairways with  
golden steps, and lapis lazuli stairways with golden steps. The steps of  
some lapis lazuli stairways were inlaid with quartz, while the steps of  
some quartz stairways were inlaid with lapis lazuli. The railings that sur-  
rounded the city were continuous, and within the city there grew palm  
trees here and there. The golden palms bore leaves, flowers, and fruits  
made of silver; the silver palms bore leaves, flowers, and fruits made of  
gold; the quartz trees bore flowers and fruits made of lapis lazuli; the  
lapis lazuli trees bore flowers and fruits made of quartz. Between these  
trees there were placed four kinds of ponds [each respectively] filled  
with four kinds of lotus flowers.  
The streets and houses were neatly aligned, and the town blocks  
were well organized with parallel streets running horizontally as well  
as vertically. Quantities of flowers scattered by the wind fell upon the  
streets. A mild breeze arose four times [daily], passing through these  
trees, creating soft sounds like those of heavenly music. The people  
of this country, male or female, adult or child, played among these  
trees and enjoyed their games.

the ground, he rubbed the wheel with his right hand and spoke to the  
wheel: “Let the wheel turn itself toward the east, turning as it should,  
without losing regularity.” The wheel at once began to roll toward the  
east. Then King Mahāsudarśana followed after the wheel leading the  
four divisions of his army. When the golden wheel was turning forward,  
the four guardian gods were in charge of guiding it. Wherever the wheel  
stopped, the king stopped his chariot.  
At that time, having seen the great king approaching, the rulers of  
the small countries in the eastern regions prepared a golden bowl filled  
with silver grains and a silver bowl filled with golden grains, stepped  
forward toward the king, and, with heads bowed, said to him:

At that time, King Mahāsudarśana replied to the rulers of the small  
countries:

After listening to his exhortation, the kings of the small countries then  
accompanied him on his inspection tour until they reached the eastern  
ocean.  
Next, the great king proceeded toward the south, then to the west,  
and then to the north; in whichever direction the wheel rolled, the [king  
and his army] followed. The kings of the small countries in these regions  
all abnegated their dominions for the sake of the great ruler, just as the  
eastern rulers had done.

Then, wishing to take his first ride, King Sudarśana mounted the horse,  
went out of the capital in the morning, made a round of all four oceans,  
and by breakfast time he had already returned to his palace. Then,  
rejoicing by dancing and leaping, King Sudarśana said, “This dark-  
blue horse is indeed my blessing. I am now truly the universal ruler  
who turns the sacred wheel.” This is called the realization of the third  
treasure, the dark-blue horse.  
Next, the following describes how the king was able to use his fourth  
treasure, the divine gem. King Sudarśana was seated at the main hall  
early in the morning when of its own accord the divine gem suddenly  
appeared before him. The quality and color of this gem were evident  
in its clear transparency and purity. Having seen the divine gem, King  
Sudarśana thought to himself, “This gem is mysterious and very nice;  
it is supposed to be able to illuminate a region as wide as this entire  
palace compound when light shines upon it.” Wishing to test the gem  
himself, King Sudarśana immediately called the four divisions of his  
army and placed the gem on top of the flagpole. In the darkness of the  
night, he carried the flag pole and went out of the city. The gem emitted  
a ray of light that illuminated the entire army, just as if it were daytime.  
Then, rejoicing by dancing and leaping, King Sudarśana said, “Now  
this treasured gem is truly my blessing. I am truly the universal ruler  
who turns the sacred wheel.” This is called the realization of the fourth  
treasure, the divine gem.  
Next, the following describes how the king was served by his fifth  
treasure, the jadelike queen. The treasured queen suddenly appeared  
before the king, her complexion well composed, beautiful in appearance,  
neither too tall nor too short, neither fleshy nor bony, neither too light  
nor too dark, neither too hard nor too soft, her body warm in winter  
and cool in summer. The scent of the _sandal_ tree radiated from the  
roots of her hair throughout her body and the scent of a blue lotus  
emananted from her mouth. Her words and speech were invariably  
gentle and her manner was stable; she never failed to awake before the  
king or to stay awake until the king fell asleep. As King Sudarśana had  
realized purity [by extinguishing defilement] and was totally freed from  
attachment, he did not keep her in his mind even for a moment [as an

the universal ruler who turns the sacred wheel.” This is called the real-  
ization of the sixth treasure, the householder.  
Next, the following describes how the king was assisted by his sev-  
enth treasure, the military commander. The military commander, having  
excellent knowledge, strategy, valor, and toughness, bright and decisive,  
suddenly appeared. He went to King Mahāsudarśana and said to him,  
“Great king, may you have no worry, sir, if you should wish to punish  
any country. I shall be able to handle the task, sir.” King Sudarśana  
then, to test him, immediately called the four divisions of the army and  
told the general, “Make the entire army ready for battle. Assemble  
those who have not come forth, release those who have already come;  
let those who are not well prepared get ready for battle, and release  
those who are already well prepared. Let those who still remain in the  
assembly to return home, and let those who have already returned stay  
in their places.” Then, having heard the king’s words, this military  
commander at once assembled those who did not come forth to the  
assembly, released those who had already assembled, let those who  
were not well prepared get ready, released those who were already pre-  
pared, let those who still remained in the assembly to return home, and  
let those who had already returned home stay in their places. At that  
time, rejoicing by dancing and leaping, King Sudarśana said, “This  
treasured military commander is truly my blessing. I am now truly the  
universal ruler who turns the sacred wheel.” O Ānanda, this is called  
the realization of the seventh treasure by the universal king who turns  
the golden wheel.  
What are the four kinds of blessings that pertain to the universal  
ruler? First, as the universal king, he has longevity and can never meet  
with an early death; in this no one can match the king. Second, he has  
a strong physical body and never contracts illness; in this no one can  
match the king. Third, he has the most handsome appearance; in this  
no one can match the king. Fourth, his storehouses are filled with treas-  
ures; in this no one can match the king. The foregoing are the seven  
treasures and four blessings that pertain to the universal ruler.  
O Ānanda, after a rather long time had passed, King Sudarśana  
had his carriage prepared, visited the royal park grove, and said to his

lazuli beam supports. There were four railings around the pavilion,  
made of the four precious materials mentioned before. The four stairways  
were also made of the four precious materials. Above the Sudharma  
pavilion were built eighty-four thousand towers; each of the golden  
towers had a silver door, while each of the silver towers had a golden  
door; in similar manner, each of the quartz towers had a lapis lazuli  
door, while each of the lapis lazuli towers had a quartz door. Each of  
the golden towers was equipped with silver couches, while each of the  
silver towers was equipped with golden couches. Each couch was cov-  
ered with a soft and fine cushion woven of golden thread; the lapis lazuli  
and quartz couches were also covered with similar cushions. The bright-  
ness of the pavilion was so blinding to viewers’ eyes that it was like the  
intense light of the sun, such that no one could look directly at it.  
Then King Sudarśana thought to himself, “I should build pools with  
palm trees around them on both sides of the pavilion.” The four sides  
of the pools were each one _yojana_ long. The king again thought to  
himself, “In front of the Sudharma pavilion there should be set the  
Dharma pond.” When it was built, each of its four sides were one  
_yojana_ long. The water was clean and clear, pure and spotless. The  
bottom of the pond was constructed with tiles made of the four kinds  
of precious materials as before. A railing was attached around the four  
sides of the pond, studded with four kinds of precious materials, such  
as gold, silver, quartz, and lapis lazuli. Inside the pond grew varieties  
of water grass and all kinds of lotus plants with blue, pink, red, and  
white flowers that released exquisitely delicate fragrance in all directions.  
The gardens that surrounded the four sides of the pool were also filled  
with varieties of blooming flowers, such as _atimukta ka, campaka, pāṭalī,  
sumanā, vārṣika,_ and _dhanuṣkari._ The pond was looked after by some  
caretakers, but if any citizens who passed by the pond wished to bathe  
in it they could do so, because it was cool and refreshing. Fruit juice as  
well as food were amply provided to anyone who wished to drink or  
partake of it, as much as they might desire. Clothing, carriages, horses,  
fragrant flowers, riches, and treasures were all available to anyone.  
O Ānanda, King Sudarśana had eighty-four thousand elephants,  
among which the treasured elephant, decorated with gold and silver

#### Third Episode

At that time, the Buddha said to Ānanda:

and holy practitioner. Next, transcending both pain and pleasure,  
removing sorrow and joy, he realized the fourth meditative state of  
absorption in which there is neither pain nor pleasure, but an increase  
of the state of equanimity ( _upekṣā_ ) that consolidates pure and genuine  
mindfulness.  
Thereupon, King Sudarśana arose from the silver chair, came out  
of the golden cloister tower, went to the central tower, sat on the lapis  
lazuli chair, and practiced the four kinds of immeasurable minds ( _brah-  
mavihāra_ s), first by permeating friendly love ( _maitrī_ ) infinitely in one  
direction, and then likewise in the remaining three directions. Thus he  
extended his immeasurable mind of benevolence universally in all  
directions, neither [divided] nor bound to limitation. Casting away var-  
ious feelings of hatred, leaving no ill will in his mind, the king enjoyed  
the state of tranquility and silence, compassion and tenderness. He also  
completed the remaining three practices, namely, the immeasurable  
mind of compassion ( _karuṇā_ ), the immeasurable mind of sympathetic  
joy ( _muditā_ ), and the immeasurable mind of equanimity ( _upekṣā_ ).  
At that time, the treasured queen quietly thought herself, “I have  
not seen his majesty for some time and wish to set up an occasion for  
audience. I shall now notify the king of this.” Then the treasured queen  
Sumatī said to the eighty-four thousand palace ladies, “May all of you  
bathe in warm scented water and attire yourselves in formal dress.  
Since we have not seen his majesty for some time, we are going to see  
the countenance of his majesty.” As instructed, the palace ladies bathed  
and properly attired themselves. Then Queen Sumatī also said to the  
treasured military commander, “May your leadership assemble the  
four divisions of the army. Since we have not seen his majesty for some  
time, we are going to have an audience.” Thereupon, the treasured mil-  
itary commander, having assembled the four divisions of the army,  
reported, “The four divisions of the army have already been assembled.  
Whenever your ladyship is ready.” Thereupon, leading the eighty-four  
thousand palace ladies, accompanied by the four divisions of the army,  
the queen reached the golden palm tree grove. The sound of the mul-  
titude reached the king’s cognizance. Having heard the sound, the king  
looked through a window and saw the treasured queen standing by the

span of life with us. May your majesty not forsake your life span and  
leave tens of thousands of subjects without their ruler.”  
At that time, King Sudarśana replied to the queen, “Your ladyship,  
since olden days you have assisted me in the virtues of mercy, gentle-  
ness, respectfulness, and obedience, and you have never uttered a care-  
less word. Why do you say this to me now?”  
The queen said to the king, “I do not understand, sir. How could  
my statement be contrary to your majesty, sir?” The king replied to the  
queen, “The things to which you have referred, namely, the elephants,  
horses, chariots, the golden wheel, the palace pavilion and cloister, the  
good garments, the exquisite meals—all these are impermanent and  
cannot be held for a long time. Though you have urged me to remain  
in this life, how can I follow this request?”  
Queen Sumatī said again to the king, “I do not understand, sir. Your  
majesty is my merciful teacher. What else could I say, sir?” The king  
replied, “If you understand that the elephants, horses, chariots, golden  
wheel, pavilions and cloisters, garments, and exquisite meals are all  
impermanent, and hence cannot be held beyond a temporary period of  
time, you would not exhaust your mind and thoughts out of attachment  
to these things. The reason is that I have no more life left and must  
soon leave for the next life. It is the universal rule that whenever there  
is birth, there is death; whenever there is a meeting, there is a separation.  
Who could, once born into this life, live forever? One should sever  
oneself from affection and love and give weight to the path of seeking  
the ultimate goal. Such are [what I consider to be] words of respect  
and obedience.”  
O Ānanda, at that time, having heard the king’s exhortation, the  
treasured lady wept and cried in sorrow. Wiping away her tears, she  
said to the king, “Your majesty, those elephants, horses, chariots, golden  
wheel, pavilions and cloisters, renowned garments, exquisite meals,  
are all impermanent and hence cannot be held beyond a temporary  
period of time, sir. May your majesty not exhaust your mind and thoughts  
out of attachment to these things. Your majesty has no more time left  
in the span of life and must soon leave for the life to come. It is the uni-  
versal rule that whenever there is birth, there is death; whenever there

is a meeting, there is a separation. Who could, once born into this life,  
live forever? One should sever oneself from affection and love and  
give weight to the path of seeking the ultimate goal, sir.”  
O Ānanda, as the treasured lady was uttering this statement, King  
Sudarśana suddenly passed away. Just as when a valiant soldier bites  
into a delicious morsel, there was no suffering or agony. The king’s  
spirit ascended to the seventh Brahmā Heaven (i.e., the twentieth of  
thirty-three heavens). Seven days after the death of the great king  
Sudarśana, the treasures of the golden wheel, the divine gem, and so  
on all disappeared of their own accord. The treasures of the elephant,  
the horse, the ladyship, the master householder, and the military com-  
mander all passed away on the same day the king died. The castle, the  
ponds, the Sudharma pavilion, the cloister tower, the ornamented items,  
the golden palm tree grove—all turned into earth and forest.  
The Buddha continued, saying to Ānanda:  
Whatever is conditioned is impermanent, is subject to change, and nec-  
essarily ends in cessation. When one does not mind avarice and pursues  
it, he will exhaust his life. When one is attached to someone with affec-  
tion and love, he will not find the limit of satisfaction. Only those who  
have realized the right insight and thus see the path as it really is can  
know the limit of satisfaction.  
O Ānanda, I recall that in my past lives I returned to this land six  
times to become the universal ruler and laid my ashes in this land. In  
this [seventh] life, I have accomplished supreme, perfect enlightenment  
and once again forsake my life span and lay my ashes at this place.  
There will be no more birth and death after this, and hence, no land  
where my body may be placed after this. This is the last and the limit  
of my life cycle, with no more birth hereafter.  
At that time, the World-honored One was about to reach final cessation  
in the spot between the paired _śāla_ trees in the _śāla_ grove, the original place  
of the Mallan clan, in the city of Kuśinagara. He instructed Ānanda,

in the middle of this night under the twin _śāla_ trees. You should be  
there to ask him about whatever doubts you have [regarding religious  
salvation] and directly receive his answer and instruction. Do not make  
cause for regret by missing this opportunity.”  
Thus instructed, Ānanda rose from his seat and, after venerating the Buddha,  
left for Kuśinagara. With tears in his eyes he went into the city, accompanied  
by a _bhikṣu_. At that time he happened to see that five hundred Mallan clans-  
people were gathering in a place for some purpose. Seeing Ānanda approaching  
them, the Mallans stood up to greet him but, remaining at one side, they  
enquired, “It is strange to see the venerable coming into town now, at this  
time. It is already almost evening. What is your purpose, sir?”  
With tears in his eyes, Ānanda said to them:  
I came here in order to benefit you. I announce to you, wise friends,  
that the Tathāgata is about to enter final nirvana in the middle of this  
night. You should go ask him about whatever doubts you have [regard-  
ing your salvation] and directly receive his answer and instruction. Do  
not make cause for regret by missing this opportunity.  
At that time, having heard this news, the Mallan clanspeople loudly cried  
out in grief, their bodies twisting and falling to the ground as they fainted,  
then recovering consciousness, just as when huge trees fall due to the complete  
loss of their roots’ hold, their branches breaking in a mess [on the ground].  
They lamented in unison:

that the _śramaṇa_ Gautama was taking the course of cessation, he thought to  
himself:

I still have some doubt regarding religious salvation in the matter of  
Dharma. Only Gautama alone understands the meaning of my doubt.  
Now I should see him, visiting there by my own strength.  
At once, he left the city of Kuśinagara during the night, [traveling to] the  
twin _śāla_ trees, and arrived at the place where Ānanda was. Having greeted  
him, he stood to one side and said to Ānanda:

I was informed that the _śramaṇa_ Gautama is going to enter cessation  
during this night. I have come here because of that. I wish to meet him  
because I have a doubt about a religious matter on the nature of Dharma.  
By meeting Gautama, I wish to settle my mind once and for all. If there  
is some extra time, may I be allowed to see him, sir?  
Ānanda replied, “O Subhadra, do not impose [your questions] on him.  
The Buddha is physically very ill. You should not bother him.”  
Subhadra, however, firmly requested repeatedly, saying three times:  
I have heard that the Tathāgata appears in this world only once in a  
long period of time, like the _udumbara_ flower that blooms only very  
rarely and intermittently. Therefore, I have dared to come here, because  
I wish to settle my doubt. May I see the Buddha even for a short time,  
if he can spare any moment at all?  
Ānanda replied in the same way, “The Buddha is physically very ill. You  
should not bother him.” However, the Buddha said to Ānanda:

Do not prevent him. Let him come here and permit him to settle his  
doubt. It will not bother me too much. If he listens to my answer to  
his question on the subject of Dharma, he will surely be able to resolve  
his problem  
Ānanda immediately conveyed the Buddha’s permission to Subhadra,  
“If you wish, you may see him whenever you are ready.” At once Subhadra  
went in and, having greeted the Buddha with a bow, sat to one side and said  
to him:

To seek the path of religion (i.e., the good path).  
O Subhadra, it has been already fifty years now  
Since I realized enlightenment.  
I have practiced morality, concentration, and wisdom,  
And I have been in solitary thought in seclusion.  
Now, I am explaining to you the essentials of my teaching.  
There is no saintly realization  
Through anything else but this practice.  
The Buddha said to Subhadra, “If _bhikṣu_ s diligently worked for the goal  
of deliverance, this world would be filled with arhats and would not be a for-  
saken place.” Subhadra then said to Ānanda:

His teaching assures us that if every _śramaṇa_ has already been practicing  
the practice of austerity under the guidance of Buddha, is currently  
engaged in the practice of austerity, and will continue to carry it out  
properly in the future, [that _śramaṇa_ ] will be able to realize the great  
result. O Ānanda, you too have realized that great result since you have  
been engaged in the practice of austerity under the guidance of the  
Tathāgata. I have directly met the Tathāgata and have been able to ask  
him about my doubts; therefore, I should be able to realize that great  
result. Now, the Tathāgata has assured me that as his disciple I too am  
able to accomplish such a great result.  
Then he asked the Buddha, “May I now renounce my family life under  
the Tathāgata’s Dharma and be ordinained to receive the vow of the precepts?”  
The Buddha told Subhadra:

answer], deliberately questioned the _bhikṣu_ s, “Is the _bhikṣu_ Ānanda present  
now?” The _bhikṣu_ s replied:

The Buddha replied to Ānanda:

The Buddha said to Ānanda:

If any of you have doubt regarding the Buddha, Dharma, or Sangha,  
or doubt regarding the path, you should question me at once. Don’t let  
this opportunity pass without asking me about your doubts, and later  
have regret because you did not do so now. As long as I am alive, I  
shall explain the subject with which your doubts are concerned.  
All the _bhikṣu_ s remained silent, not uttering a word. The Buddha again  
said to them:

If any of you have doubt regarding the Buddha, Dharma, or Sangha,  
or doubt regarding the path, you should question me at once. Don’t let  
this opportunity pass without asking me about your doubts, only later  
to have regret because you did not do so now. As long as I am alive I  
shall explain the subject with which your doubts are concerned.  
Once again all the _bhikṣu_ s did not utter a word, remaining silent. The  
Buddha again said to them:

If you do not question me about your doubts because you are afraid  
of shame within or without, bring up your questions to me by way of  
your colleagues. Don’t let this opportunity pass without asking me  
about your doubts, only later to regret not having done so now.  
The _bhikṣu_ s once again did not utter a word and remained silent. Ānanda  
said to the Buddha:

I have no doubt in my mind that all the members of this sangha are  
steady in genuine faith, sir. There is not even a single _bhikṣu_ who doubts  
the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha or the path.  
The Buddha said to Ānanda:  
I myself know that even the youngest _bhikṣu_ of this sangha now sees  
the path of practice and shall not fall into an evil course of life. The  
[ _bhikṣu_ s] will return seven times to this world and necessarily exhaust  
the fundamental cause of suffering.  
At that time, the World-honored One thus granted his assurance to the  
one thousand and two hundred _bhikṣu_ s regarding their respective goals of

realization. Thereupon, the World-honored One opened his upper robe to  
reveal his golden forearm and said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

You should contemplate the fact that the Tathāgata appears in this world  
only once in a long period of time, like _udumbara_ flowers that bloom  
only very rarely and intermittently.  
At that time, contemplating the meaning of this matter, the World-honored  
One repeated it in verse:

His right arm is of purplish-golden hue.  
The appearance of the Buddha  
Is like that of a divine gem.  
Things that pass away and  
Come into being are impermanent;  
[Hence] there is no dissoluteness in manifesting cessation.  
[The Buddha continued:]  
Therefore, O _bhikṣu_ s, be on guard against dissoluteness. It was on the  
basis of constant vigilance against indolence that I realized perfect  
enlightenment. An immeasurable number of sentient beings will also  
realize perfect enlightenment on the basis of constant vigilance against  
indolence. Of all things in this world, there is nothing whatsoever that  
exists forever. This is the teaching exhorted by the Tathāgata in his last  
moment of life.  
Thereupon, the World-honored One entered the initial state of meditative  
absorption; coming out of this state he then entered the second state of med-  
itative absorption; coming out of this state he then entered the third state of  
meditative absorption; coming out of this state he then entered the fourth  
state of meditative absorption; coming out of this state he then entered the  
first formless state of concentration on the sphere of infinite space; coming  
out of this state he then entered the second formless state of concentration  
on the sphere of infinite consciousness; coming out of this state he then  
entered the third formless state of concentration on the sphere of nothing or  
nonutility; coming out of this state he then entered the fourth formless state  
of concentration on the sphere of “neither ideation nor nonideation”; coming

out of this state he then entered the final state of cessation, transcendent from  
senses and ideation, equivalent to third saintly state of an _anāgāmin._  
At this time, Ānanda asked Anuruddha, “Has the World-honored One  
entered final nirvana?” Anuruddha replied:

Not yet. O Ānanda, the World-honored One is now in the state of ces-  
sation. In olden days I directly heard from the Buddha that the final  
nirvana is entered from the fourth meditative state of absorption.  
Then at that time, the World-honored One, coming out of the state of ces-  
sation of ideation, entered into concentration on the sphere of “neither ideation  
nor nonideation”; coming out of this state he then entered into concentration  
on the sphere of nothing or nonutility; coming out of this state he then entered  
into concentration on the sphere of consciousness; coming out of this state  
he then entered into concentration on the sphere of space; coming out of this  
state he then entered into the fourth meditative absorption ( _rūpa-dhyāna-  
samādhi_ ); coming out of this state he then entered into the third meditative  
absorption; coming out of this state he then entered into the second med-  
itative absorption; coming out of this state he then entered into the first  
meditative absorption; coming out of this state he then entered into the sec-  
ond meditative absorption; coming out of this state he then entered into  
the third meditative absorption; coming out of this state he then entered  
into the fourth meditative absorption; coming out of this state he then  
entered final nirvana.  
Just at that moment the earth trembled greatly and heavenly gods and  
humans were greatly terrified. Various underworlds, dark and gloomy, in  
which neither the sun or moon shone, were equally illuminated, allowing  
those beings who were born therein to see each other, and they all exclaimed,  
“That person has been reborn here,” “That one too was born here,” [and so  
on]. A ray of light permeated the entire world, surpassing the luminosity of  
heavenly beings. Then from the thirty-third heaven various lotus flowers,  
blue _utpala,_ pink _padma,_ red _kumuda,_ and white _puṇḍarīka,_ dropped and  
scattered into the air over the Tathāgata as well as the assembled host of  
_bhikṣu_ s, and heavenly sandalwood powder also scattered over the Buddha  
below and the assembly of _bhikṣu_ s. The Buddha thus passed away into final  
nirvana. Thereupon, the god Brahmā uttered these verses from midair:

Then, the _bhikṣu_ Ānanda composed the following verse:

Then the god Kumbhīra also composed a verse:

Then the guardian god Guhyaka composed the following verse:

Then, Māyā, the mother of the Buddha, composed the following verse:

Then the spirit of the twin _śāla_ trees composed the following verse:

Has been totally dissolved.  
There are neither thoughts of sorrow nor of joy,  
Nor any danger of birth and death.  
Then the lord of Nirmāṇarataya Heaven composed the following verse:  
The Buddha laid down  
Upon his right side;  
The Śākya lion entered final nirvana  
In this _śāla_ grove.  
Then the lord of Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven composed the following  
verse:

The world shall wither in darkness  
For a long time to come  
The moon, lord of the stars, fell away, and  
Hindered by the force of impermanence,  
The sun of great wisdom  
Is shadowed for a long time.  
At that time, the _bhikṣu_ s composed the following verse:  
This body is like a water bubble.  
Vulnerable as it is to any danger,  
Who could ever enjoy it?  
The Buddha obtained the imperishable body  
Like that of a diamond, and  
Yet his body is dissolved  
Because of the force of impermanence.  
The buddhas are in possession of the diamondlike body,  
Yet all are subject to the force of impermanence,  
So quickly perishing like a small pile of snow.  
How could anything else be any different from this?  
The Buddha thus entered final nirvana. Some of the _bhikṣu_ s fainted in  
sorrow and grief, casting themselves upon the ground, bitterly weeping, their  
bodies twisting, unable to control themselves. While weeping, they lamented:

How is it that the Buddha should go to cessation so soon? Why must the  
Buddha go to cessation so quickly? How swiftly the great religion (the  
Dharma) is lost and obscured! Sentient beings shall surely wither for a  
long time to come when the world has lost its Eye of Insight forever.  
Thereupon, throughout that night, the host of _bhikṣu_ s discussed the words  
of the Dharma and completed [the recitation] by the arrival of the dawn.  
Anuruddha said to Ānanda:

May you go to the city and tell the Mallan clanspeople, “The Buddha  
has already entered final nirvana. Those who wish to make tribute and  
offerings to the Buddha are commended to know that now is the appro-  
priate time.”  
At that time, Ānanda stood up and after venerating the Buddha, accompanied  
by a _bhikṣu_ , with tears on his face, he entered the city, where he happened to  
see five hundred Mallans gathered in one place for some reason. The Mallan  
clanspeople too, noticing Ānanda approaching them, stood up to greet him,  
venerated him [by bowing their foreheads to] his feet, and said to him, “Venerable,  
why have you come here so early, sir?” Ānanda replied:

Because I wish to benefit you, I have come here as quickly as possible  
this early morning. You should know that the Tathāgata already entered  
final nirvana last night. If you wish to make offerings, now is the appro-  
priate time.  
When the Mallan clanspeople heard this news, there was none among  
them who did not lament and grieve. Wiping tears from their faces, they said,  
“How is it that the Buddha has gone to final nirvana so soon? How is it that  
so swiftly the Eye of Insight has ceased to be in this world?” Ānanda  
responded:

remain in the same place for seven days, to be honored throughout that  
period with various offerings, and thereafter to place the body on the  
couch. Then the Mallan youths will lift the four corners of the couch,  
and carrying the canopy and streamers, burning incense, scattering  
flowers, and with accompanying musical performance, they will enter  
the city from the eastern gate, make a round through various streets so  
as to allow all the citizens of the country to have an opportunity to  
make offerings. They will then go out of the northern gate, cross the  
Hiraṇyavatī River to reach the Makuṭabandhana shrine, and cremate  
the body there. Because of this wish, the heavenly gods will not [yet]  
allow the couch to be lifted.  
The Mallan clanspeople said, “We agree, sir.” Splendid were the words  
of Anuruddha! It precisely accorded with the will of the heavens.

The Mallan clanspeople said to each other:  
Let us go back to the city and repair the roads and streets, clean them,  
and burn incense along them, then return here and continue to make  
offerings to the World-honored One for seven full days.  
All the Mallan clanspeople then returned to town, repaired the roads and  
streets, cleaned them, burned incense along them, and, coming out of the town,  
made offerings for seven full days at the twin _śāla_ trees by scattering flowers,  
burning incense, and playing musical instruments near the time of sunset on  
the last day. The body was then moved onto the couch. The Mallan youths lifted  
the four corners of the couch. They carried the canopy and streamers, scattered  
flowers, burned incense, and played musical instruments. In this manner, the  
[funeral] procession proceeded, calmly accompanied in front and behind by the  
leading group and the following group, respectively.  
Then the gods of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven scattered from midair various lotus  
flowers, blue, pink, red, and white, as well as heavenly sandalwood incense  
over the body of the World-honored One, thus filling up the streets with [these  
offerings]. Some heavenly beings played music and the spirits sang songs. Then  
the Mallan clanspeople spoke among themselves, “Halt the human performance  
of music and let the heavenly performance of music be an offering to the body.”  
In this manner, the Mallans carried the couch and proceeded gradually. Entering

O Ānanda, if you wish to conduct the funeral rite for me, you should  
bathe my body with warm scented water, cover my entire body with  
new cotton cloth, wrap it in a cloth equally as long as five hundred sets  
of garments, place the body within a golden coffin, pour sesame oil  
over it, place the golden coffin inside a second but larger iron vault,  
cover it with a sandalwood vault, cover that vault with a thick pile of  
a variety of incense, then cremate the whole thing. After retrieving my  
ashes, build a commemorative tower or shrine at each major crossroads  
and hang my picture on the rock pillar set before it, so as to enable  
whoever passes on the road to view the Buddha’s tower, refreshing his  
[or her] sense of affection toward the religious deeds accomplished by  
the Tathāgata and encouraging them to strive for their own goal of hap-  
piness in life when born into this world, and obtain the opportunity  
upon their death to be reborn in heaven. Of course, this excludes those  
who have [already] realized the ultimate goal of the path.  
Thereupon, the Mallan clanspeople said to each other:  
We should go back to the city to collect the funeral items, the incense  
and flowers, cotton cloth, the coffin and vault, and the scented oil, as  
well as the roll of white cloth.  
They returned together and completed the preparation of the necessary  
things. Returning to the Makuṭabandhana shrine, they bathed the Buddha’s  
body with warm scented water, covered it entirely with a new cotton cloth,  
wrapped it in the roll of cloth equally as long as five hundred sets of garments,  
placed it in the golden coffin, poured scented oil over it, placed the coffin inside  
a second, larger iron vault, covered it with another sandalwood vault, and cov-  
ered the vault with a thick pile of various renowned incense. The minister of  
the Mallan country held up a huge torch to set fire to the funeral pyre of the  
Buddha but the flame did not reach the pyre. A few other Mallan dignitaries  
one after another tried to set fire to the pyre, but the flame would not reach the  
pyre. Then Anuruddha said to the Mallan clanspeople,“Try no more. Wise gen-  
tlemen, it is beyond your power. The fire extinguished itself due to the will of  
the gods.” The Mallans questioned him, “Why should the heavenly gods prevent  
it from being burned, sir?” Anuruddha replied:

Having heard these words, Kāśyapa was disheartened, and with disap-  
pointment said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

All of you, pack your robes and almsbowls. We are going to the place  
of the twin _śāla_ trees. Since the cremation has not yet been done we  
may yet be able to see the Buddha.  
Then the _bhikṣu_ s, having heard Mahākāśyapa’s words, rose from their  
seats and followed him, proceeding to the city of Kuśinagara, crossing the  
Hiraṇyavatī River, and [finally] arriving at the Makuṭabandhana shrine.  
Having arrived at the place where Ānanda was, and after greeting him with  
a bow, Mahākāśyapa said to him, “We wish to see the body once again. Since  
the cremation has not yet been done, is it possible to do so?” Ānanda replied:

Though the cremation has not yet been done, it would be very difficult  
to see the body, sir. The reason is that the Buddha’s body was washed  
with warm scented water, totally covered with new cotton cloth, wrapped  
in a roll of cloth equally as long as five hundred sets of garments, placed  
in a golden coffin, then placed inside a second, larger iron vault, and  
then encased in a sandalwood vault. Because of this it would be very  
difficult to see the Buddha’s body once again, sir.  
Though Kāśyapa requested three times, Ānanda replied exactly as he had  
first replied, “For this reason, it would be difficult to see the Buddha’s body  
again, sir.” Mahākāśyapa then faced the funeral pyre directly and both of the  
Buddha’s feet extended out from within the vault, bearing a strange color.  
Having examined this, Kāśyapa was curious and asked Ānanda, “Why do the  
Buddha’s feet appear so different, having a golden color?” Ānanda replied:

Previously, an elderly woman, in her grief, stretched out both her hands  
to rub his feet. The change in the color of the Buddha’s feet was effected  
by her tears falling upon them, sir.  
Having heard this, Kāśyapa again felt disheartened with disappointment,  
but he faced directly the funeral pyre and venerated the Buddha’s body. At  
that moment, all four kinds of the Buddha’s disciples (i.e., _bhikṣu_ s, _bhikṣuṇī_ s,  
_upāsaka_ s, and _upāsikā_ s) as well as heavenly beings all accordingly offered  
veneration at the same time. At that moment both of the Buddha’s feet suddenly

disappeared. Thereupon, Mahākāśyapa circumambulated the funeral pyre  
three times and uttered the following verses:

The highest among the ascetic mendicants ( _śramaṇa_ s),  
Turning wrong to right,  
He who introduced the way to total quiescence,  
Toward he whose trace is like the deep water,  
I pay tribute with a bow.  
Without the heat (of passion),  
With the spotless teaching,  
And the mind that is quiescent,  
He who has removed all defilements,  
Toward that Honorable One, without defilement,  
I pay tribute with a bow.  
Immeasurable with his eye of insight,  
Wonderful and unthinkable is the title  
Of [sublime] authority like that of nectar,  
Toward that matchless (i.e., unequaled) one,  
I pay tribute with a bow.  
With his voice like a lion’s roar,  
With no fear in the forest,  
He who overcame the Evil One [Māra]  
And transcended the four social classes,  
For that reason,  
I pay tribute with a bow.  
Thus Mahākāśyapa, who was endowed with great authority and virtue,  
well equipped with the four logical-linguistic excellences ( _catuṣ-pratisaṃvi-  
daḥ_ ), finished the foregoing verses. At that moment, the funeral pyre started  
to burn of its own accord. The Mallan clanspeople said to each other:

Now the fire appears to have intensified and is spreading over the pyre,  
and it may not be controlled. After cremation it will extinguish itself,  
but where can we now obtain water to prevent the fire from spreading  
over the whole pyre?  
Then the _śāla_ tree spirit by the side of the funeral pyre, who was devoted  
to the path of the Buddha, extinguished the fire with his supernormal power.

their countrymen to assemble the four divisions of their armies, the elephants,  
horses, chariots, and foot soldiers, and well prepared they marched and  
crossed the Ganges River, sending the _brāhmaṇa_ Droṇa as [the king’s] proxy  
by instructing him:

Go to the city of Kuśinagara under my name and ask the Mallan clans-  
people: “May I enquire as to whether you gentlemen are at ease in your  
rising and siting, and feel strong in your walking, sirs. Wise gentlemen,  
I am delighted to exchange mutual respect with you. We have been on  
good terms as to territorial demarcation and have never put the matter  
into the form of a public suit. I understand that the Tathāgata has entered  
final nirvana within your country. I simply wish to pay my respects  
and reverence to the highest Honorable One as if he were a heavenly  
god. Hence I have traveled a great distance to obtain a share of the  
Buddha’s ashes, and upon taking the ashes to my own land I will erect  
a commemorative tower for them in order to conduct offerings. If you  
grant me some of the ashes, I will arrange for some of my country’s  
treasure to be shared with your country, sir.”  
Having thus received the king’s instruction, the _brāhmaṇa_ Droṇa at once  
went to the city and said to the Mallan clanspeople:

That is right, sir. Your claim is indeed correct, sir. However, the World-  
honored One happened to enter final nirvana in our land. Our officials  
and countrymen should themselves perform the memorial service for  
the Buddha. Alhough it has caused you such trouble to come from such  
a long distance, we cannot pass the ashes into your hands, sir.  
The rulers of various countries assembled their respective officials to dis-  
cuss the matter and composed the following verse:

With courtesy we have come from a far distance  
For the sake of a peaceful consultation and to  
Request a share of the ashes  
With words of moderation.  
If this is not granted,  
We have readied the four divisions of our armies here.  
If [the relics] cannot be obtained on a justifiable basis,  
Without fearing injury or death,  
We will obtain them by force.  
Then the people of Kuśinagara [also] assembled their officials, and together  
with the public they discussed the matter and replied in verse:

Buddha’s ashes, everyone shall injure and kill each other. If you wish  
to have the Tathāgata’s ashes, benefit everyone widely; since the ashes  
are available here, it is surely better to divide them among those who  
wish to have a portion.  
Everyone agreed that this would be best. Next, they discussed who would  
be fairminded enough to carry out the task. Everyone agreed, “Let the _brāh-  
maṇa_ Droṇa divide the ashes through his humane wisdom.” Thereupon, those  
rulers of the various countries entrusted the task to the _brāhmaṇa_ Droṇa,  
saying, “Please divide the ashes on our behalf into eight equal portions.”  
Droṇa, having listened to the rulers’ agreement, went to the place where the  
ashes were stored and, having honored the ashes by bowing his head, pro-  
ceeded to gently take an upper tooth and placed it aside. He sent for a mes-  
senger and instructed him:

Carry this upper tooth of the Buddha to King Ajātaśatru. You should  
present my words to his majesty: “O great king, may I humbly enquire  
as to whether your majesty is at ease in his rising and sitting, and feels  
strong in his walking. Since the ashes have not yet been brought forth,  
your majesty may feel immeasurably impatient. Now I have entrusted  
an upper tooth of the Tathāgata in the hands of this messenger to carry  
it to your majesty, so that an offering service may be conducted before  
it and so that your majesty may be comforted by it, prior to the expected  
plan (i.e., of erecting a commemorative tower). At sunrise tomorrow  
I shall complete [the task of] dividing the ashes and will personally  
transport your portion of the ashes to your majesty.”  
Having received Droṇa’s instruction, the messenger at once went to King  
Ajātaśatru and said:

tower). At sunrise tomorrow he will complete the division of the ashes,  
and will personally transport your portion of the ashes to your majesty.  
At that time Droṇa received all the ashes, measuring one _shi,_ collected in  
a urn, and at once divided the ashes into eight equal portions. Having done  
so, he said to those who attended the session, “May I request you to use this  
urn and yourselves witness who takes what through mutual consultation.”  
Everyone praised Droṇa, “What splendid wisdom this is! He really knows  
what is most proper at this given moment,” and each mutually agreed to  
accept a portion. Then the people of Pippalavana made a request of all the  
people, saying:

We would like to receive the amber that remains on the ground, for  
the sake of erecting a commemorative tower in our country in order  
to conduct an offering service.  
Everyone agreed, “Let them have it.” Then the people of Kuśinagara  
received a portion and erected their commemorative tower for conducting  
their offering service. The people of Pāvā, those of Allakappa, those of Rāma-  
grāma, those of Veṭhadvīpa, those of Kapilavastu, those of Vaiśālī, and the  
king of Magadha, Ajātaśatru, having received their respective portions,  
returned to their countries and erected commemorative towers for conducting  
offering services. The _brāhmaṇa_ Droṇa received the urn that contained the  
ashes, returned to his country, and erected a commemorative tower there.  
The people of Pippalavana took the amber to their country and erected a  
commemorative tower in their country. At that time, eight commemorative  
towers were built, and a ninth was erected for enshrining the vase, a tenth  
for enshrining the amber, and an eleventh for enshrining the World-honored  
One’s hair.  
When was the Buddha born? When did the Buddha realize enlightenment?  
And when did he enter final nirvana? He was born when the boiling star  
( _feixing_ ) appeared; he was enlightened when the boiling star appeared; he  
entered the city of nirvana when the boiling star appeared.^21

When did he enter the city of nirvana?  
When the boiling star appeared,  
The Foremost among Humans was born.  
When the boiling star appeared,  
He came forth from the world of suffering.  
When the boiling star appeared,  
He realized the highest path.  
When the boiling star appeared,  
He entered the city of nirvana.  
On the eighth day, the Tathāgata was born.  
On the eighth day the Buddha renounced the world.  
On the eighth day, he realized perfect enlightenment.  
On the eighth day, he entered final cessation.  
On the eighth day, the Foremost among Humans was born.  
On the eighth day, he came out from the world of suffering.  
On the eighth day, he realized the highest path.  
On the eighth day, he entered the city of nirvana.  
In the second month, the Tathāgata was born.  
In the second month, the Buddha renounced the world.  
In the second month, he realized enlightenment.  
In the second month, he entered final nirvana.  
In the second month, the Foremost among Humans was born.  
In the second month, he came out of the world of suffering.  
In the second month, he realized the highest path.  
In the second month, he entered the city of nirvana.  
The _śāla_ tree flowers were profusely blooming;  
Various lights mutually illuminated.  
At that original place,  
The Tathāgata entered final nirvana.  
When the Great Merciful [One] entered final nirvana,  
Many people praised and venerated him.  
Having removed all the people’s fearfulness,  
He was determined to take the course of nirvana.
