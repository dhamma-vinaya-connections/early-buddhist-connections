### Knowledge of the

### Three Vedas

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 13: Tevijja Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. Once, when the Buddha was visiting the communities of  
the country of Kauśala, accompanied by one thousand two hundred and fifty  
_bhikṣu_ s, he stopped overnight in a _brāhmaṇa_ village called Icchānaṅkala.  
There was a _brāhmaṇa_ called Puṣkarasvādi in that village. It happened that  
a fellow _brāhmaṇa_ called Tārukkha was visiting Icchānaṅkala at that time  
to take care of some business. Puṣkarasvādi had been born into a pure family  
line of seven generations and had never been slighted by anyone. He was  
thoroughly versed in the three ancient collections of hymns (Vedas) and had  
detailed knowledge of the various _brāhmaṇa_ scriptures as well as a compre-  
hensive command of the subtleties of secular literature. He was also well  
trained in reading the physiognomy of magnanimous personalities, in divining  
good and bad omens, and in conducting ceremonial proceedings and sacrificial  
rites. He had five hundred student disciples and never tired of teaching them.  
His most able student, called Vāseṭṭha, had also been born into a pure  
family line of seven generations and was never slighted by anyone. He too  
was thoroughly versed in the three ancient collections of hymns (Vedas),  
well trained in reading the physiognomy of magnanimous personalities and  
in conducting ceremonial proceedings and sacrificial rites, and [like his  
teacher] he also had five hundred student disciples and never tired of teach-  
ing them.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ Tārukkha too was from a pure family line of seven gen-  
erations and was not slighted by anyone in society. He was thoroughly versed  
in the three ancient collections of hymns (Vedas) and had detailed knowledge  
of the various _brāhmaṇa_ scriptures as well as a comprehensive command of  
the subtleties of secular literature. He was also well trained in reading the  
physiognomy of magnanimous personalities, in divining good and bad omens,

and in conducting ceremonial proceedings and sacrificial rites. He had five  
hundred student disciples and never tired of teaching them.  
His most able student, called Bhāradvāja, was also from a pure family  
line of seven generations and was never slighted by anyone. He too was thor-  
oughly versed in the three ancient collections of hymns (Vedas), well trained  
in reading the physiognomy of magnanimous personalities and in conducting  
ceremonial proceedings and sacrificial rites, and [like his teacher] he also  
had five hundred student disciples and never tired of teaching them.  
One morning, the two students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja got together in a  
[nearby] grove and engaged in argument, mutually criticizing each other as to  
whose doctrine was right and whose was wrong. Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāra dvāja:

The path I follow must be right because it will enable us, when we leave  
this world, to reach Brahmā Heaven. That is the doctrine [my great teacher]  
Puṣkarasvādi teaches.  
Bhāradvāja said:  
The path I follow must be right because it will enable us, when we leave  
this world, to reach Brahmā Heaven. That is the doctrine my great teacher  
Tārukkha teaches.  
Vāseṭṭha resolutely maintained the absolute truth of his path, while  
Bhāradvāja too resolutely maintained the absolute truth of his path. Arguing  
in this manner, they could not determine who was right and who was wrong.  
Vāseṭṭha then said to Bhāradvāja:  
The _śramaṇa_ Gautama, son of the Śākya clan, having renounced domestic  
life and realized the ultimate goal of religion, has been visiting the com-  
munities of Kauśala and is staying over in the forest outside the village.  
Gautama is renowned and [his accomplishment] has been proclaimed  
everywhere, in all lands under the sky, as worthy of the ten supreme titles,  
namely, One Perfected in Practice (Tathāgata), One Liberated from Attach-  
ment (Arhat), Perfectly Enlightened One (Samyak-saṃbuddha), and so  
on. Among all the gods and humans, as well as all the evil ones and their  
lord, and the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s too, he alone has directly experi-  
enced the realization of enlightenment. When he expounds on religion,

his words are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the  
end. All the words he utters are invariably endowed with true meanings  
and real essences, and they are in accord with his practice of pure and  
genuine austerity. We should visit this sage and pay him our respects. I  
have also heard that the _śramaṇa_ Gautama knows the path that leads to  
Brahmā Heaven and can teach it to others, since he is always conversing  
with Lord Brahmā. Why don’t we visit him to settle our dispute? Whatever  
the _śramaṇa_ Gautama tells us, we will accept it with due respect and carry  
it out.  
After walking out to the forest together, Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja reached  
the World-honored One and greeted him with a bow, then sat to one side.  
The World-honored One immediately knew the thoughts in their minds and  
said to Vāseṭṭha:

You two have been in the grove since early this morning engaging in argu-  
ment and criticizing each other as to who is right and who is wrong. When  
one of you asserted, “The path I follow must be right, because it will  
enable us, when we leave this world, to reach Brahmā Heaven. That is  
the doctrine [my great teacher] Puṣkarasvādi teaches,” the other also  
asserted, “The path I follow must be right, because it will enable us, when  
we leave this world, to reach Brahmā Heaven. That is the doctrine my  
great teacher Tārukkha teaches.” In this manner, both of you have repeat-  
edly criticized each other as to whose path represents the absolute truth.  
Is this not so?  
Hearing these words of the Buddha, Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were fright-  
ened, and every hair on their bodies stood on end. They thought to themselves,  
“The _śramaṇa_ Gautama has supernormal powers and knows the minds of  
others. He has already stated the subject of our dispute.”  
Then Vāseṭṭha said to the Buddha:  
The path that I follow and the path that [my colleague] follows each claim  
to be absolutely true, giving us the ability to reach Brahmā Heaven when  
we leave this world. Sir, should the doctrine that Puṣkarasvādi teaches be  
regarded as absolutely true, or should the doctrine that the _brāhmaṇa_  
Tārukkha teaches be regarded as absolutely true?

The Buddha replied:  
O Vāseṭṭha, since it is you who asks if this path and the other path each  
claim to be absolutely true, enabling anyone who leaves this world to  
reach Brahmā Heaven, why did you two have to go off into a grove from  
early this morning to engage in repeated argument as to whose path is  
true and whose is false?  
Vāseṭṭha replied:  
The _brāhmaṇa_ s who are well versed in the three Vedas teach different  
paths, such as the path willed by the omnipotent Īśvara ( _chizaiyudao_ ), or  
the path of self-will ( _chizuodao_ ), or the path of Brahmā, and these paths  
are regarded as equally leading to Brahmā Heaven. O Gautama, the dif-  
ferent paths are like roads maintained by different villages, yet they all  
eventually reach the capital.  
The Buddha said, “Are you sure that the different paths are really depicted  
as equally reaching Brahmā Heaven?”  
Vāseṭṭha replied, “Yes, all of them [eventually] reach Brahmā Heaven, sir.”  
The Buddha repeated the question, “Do the different paths really lead to  
Brahmā Heaven without exception?”  
Vāseṭṭha replied, “Yes, sir.”  
After verifying his answer, the Buddha said to Vāseṭṭha, “Among the  
_brāhmaṇa_ s who are well versed in the three Vedas, is there anyone who has  
really seen Brahmā?”  
Vāseṭṭha replied, “No, no one has seen that god, sir.”  
The Buddha continued, “What do you think, O Vāseṭṭha? Did anyone  
who preceded the experts who are well versed in the three Vedas see Brahmā?”  
Again he replied, “No, none of them has seen Brahmā, sir.”  
The Buddha said:  
What do you think, O Vāseṭṭha? Did any of the ancient _brāhmaṇa_ s who  
excelled in chanting the Vedic hymns or teaching the hymns, songs, and  
verses really witness Brahmā [with their own eyes]? For instance, did the  
sages Aṣṭaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vaiśyamitra, Aṅgirasa, Yamataggi  
(Pāli), Boboxi, and Kāśyapa, Aruṇa, Gautama, Shouzhi, and Poluosuntuo  
themselves all see Brahmā?

Vāseṭṭha replied, “No, they did not, sir.”  
The Buddha continued:  
If none of the _brāhmaṇa_ s who were well versed in the three Vedas saw  
Brahmā, nor any of their teachers, or any of the ancient sages such as  
Aṣṭaka and so on, then you should realize that the doctrines they teach  
must all be considered unreal.  
The Buddha continued:  
It is just like a philanderer bragging about his conquest of some imaginary  
beauty by praising her sexual prowess. When others ask, “How do you  
know her? Is she in the east, west, north, or south?” he replies, “I don’t  
know.” Again, when others ask, “Where can she be found—in what town,  
district, or village?” he replies, “I don’t know.” When they ask, “What is  
her family? Is she from a _kṣatriya_ family, or from a _brāhmaṇa,vaiśya,_ or  
_śūdra_ family?” he again replies, “I don’t know.” And when they ask, “How  
does she look? Is she tall or short, stout or delicate, dark or light? Is she  
beautiful or ugly?” he again replies, “I don’t know.”  
O Vāseṭṭha, could the woman about whom the man is bragging really  
be regarded as real?  
Vāseṭṭha replied, “No, she cannot be regarded as real, sir.”  
The Buddha said, “Exactly, O Vāseṭṭha. In [just the same way,] the god  
Brahmā whom the _brāhmaṇa_ experts in the three Vedas praise cannot be  
considered real.”  
[The Buddha continued:]  
What do you think, O Vāseṭṭha? Suppose the _brāhmaṇa_ experts in the  
three Vedas watch the sun and moon as they rise and set, and pay their  
respects to those heavenly bodies with both palms joined and with offer-  
ings, and then assert their doctrine that one can leave this world and reach  
the abode of the sun and moon by following practices similar to theirs,  
do you agree that their path is absolutely true and will enable you to leave  
this world to reach the abode of those heavenly bodies?  
[Vāseṭṭha] replied:

Sir, the brāhmaṇa experts in the three Vedas, despite watching the sun
and moon as they rise and set and paying respects to the heavenly bodies
with both palms joined and with offerings, cannot claim that their path is
absolutely true and will enable us to leave this world and reach the abode
of those heavenly bodies.
[The Buddha continued:]
Exactly, O Vāseṭṭha. The brāhmaṇa experts in the three Vedas watch the
sun and moon as they rise and set, pay their respects to these heavenly
bodies with both palms joined and with offerings, and assert the doctrine
that one can leave this world and reach the abode of the sun and moon
by following practices similar to theirs. However, they cannot claim that
their path is absolutely true and will enable their followers to leave this
world and reach the abode of those heavenly bodies. Yet wouldn’t there
be something specious in continuing to follow the same practice of paying
respects [to the heavenly bodies as they rise and set] by joining palms
and making offerings?
[Vāseṭṭha] replied, “Exactly, O Gautama. It would be specious, sir.”
The Buddha went on:
Taking another example: Suppose a man sets up a ladder in an empty spot.
Others ask, “What are you doing setting up a ladder in an empty spot?”
The man replies, “I wish to ascend to the next floor of the building.” The
others ask, “What building? Is it in the east, west, north, or south?” He
replies, “I do not know.” What do you think, O Vāseṭṭha? Wouldn’t it be
fanciful to set up a ladder in an empty spot and try to climb to the next
floor of an imaginary building?’
[Vāseṭṭha] replied, “Exactly, sir. Such behavior is fanciful.”
The Buddha said:
It is the same as with the brāhmaṇa experts in the three Vedas. What they
teach is fanciful and unreal.
O Vāseṭṭha, the five kinds of desirable sense objects are [fundamentally]
undefiled and can be enjoyed [in ordinary life]. What are the five? The visual
faculty in the eyes perceives its object and the sense of sight is gratified. In

a similar manner, the [sense] faculties of the ear, nose, tongue, and physical  
body come into contact with their respective objects, and the senses of  
sound, smell, taste, and touch are gratified. The subjective agent or “self,”  
however, brings about attachment, bondage, and entrapment. Those _brāh-  
maṇa_ experts in the three Vedas are defiled by the five kinds of sensual  
desire; they are strongly attached [to the sense objects] but cannot see this  
fault, nor do they know the means of transcendence, and thus they are  
bound by the five kinds of sensual desire. While they may conduct their  
ceremonial rites correctly in reference to the sun and moon, water and  
fire, and chant, “May you come to me and take me to be born in Brahmā  
Heaven,” it would be impossible.  
O Vāseṭṭha, it is like crossing the Aciravatī River. When the water is  
placid even ravens on its bank and other birds can drink from it. Suppose,  
however, that a person who is heavily chained on one side of the river  
calls out to the yonder shore, “Come, come to me. I want to cross over to  
the other bank.” How could that yonder shore come any nearer? Could  
that person really cross the river in that way?

[Vāseṭṭha] replied, “It would be impossible, sir.”  
The Buddha continued:

O Vāseṭṭha, the five kinds of desirable sense objects are [fundamentally]  
undefiled and can gratify the senses. From the standpoint of rules for the  
wise and saintly, however, the objects of the senses can be forms of bondage.  
The _brāhmaṇa_ experts in the three Vedas are entrapped by them. Thoroughly  
bound, they do not see their fault or know how to transcend it. While they  
may conduct their ceremonial rites correctly in reference to the sun and  
moon, water and fire, and chant, “May you come to me and take me to be  
born in Brahmā Heaven,” that, after all, would be impossible.  
O Vāseṭṭha, it is like crossing the Aciravatī River. When the water is  
placid even ravens on its bank and and other birds can drink from it. Suppose,  
however, that someone wishes to cross the river; could he ever do so if he  
will neither use his own hands [to swim], nor rely on a boat or raft?

[Vāseṭṭha] replied, “He cannot do so, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued:]

It is just the same with the brāhmaṇa experts in the three Vedas, because
without following the path of pure and genuine austerity of the śramaṇa s,
they wish instead to reach Brahmā Heaven by relying on defective practices
that are neither pure nor genuine, and it is impossible.
O Vāseṭṭha, it is like when the river floods because of a sudden torrent
in the mountains, which can sweep people away if there is neither a boat,
a raft, or a bridge available. Now suppose a traveler wishes to cross the
river, but he sees the river flooding because of the sudden torrent in the
mountains and people being swept away for lack of a boat, raft, or bridge.
He thinks to himself, “I can build a raft by gathering wood and grass and
tying it together tightly, and then by using my own strength I should be able
to cross the river.” He immediately finds the materials, ties them together
very tightly, and applies his own strength to cross the river safely.
O Vāseṭṭha, it is the same with the case in question. If a bhikṣu abandons
practices that are neither suitable for a śramaṇa nor pure and genuine,
and adopts the pure and genuine practice that is suitable for a śramaṇa ,
it is then possible for him to be born in Brahmā Heaven.
[The Buddha continued,] “What do you think, O Vāseṭṭha? Is there anger
in Brahmā?”
Vāseṭṭha replied, “No, sir.”
[The Buddha] again asked, “Is there anger in those brāhmaṇa experts in
the three Vedas?”
Vāseṭṭha replied, “Yes, sir.”
[The Buddha continued:]
O Vāseṭṭha, Brahmā has no anger whereas those [ brāhmaṇa s invariably]
have anger. Those who have no anger and those who have anger cannot
be mixed together, nor can they realize deliverance together, nor can they
share the same destiny. Because of these differences, the god Brahmā and
those brāhmaṇa s cannot abide in the same place.
[The Buddha continued,] “What do you think, O Vāseṭṭha? Is there hatred
in Brahmā?”
Vāseṭṭha replied, “No, sir.”
“Is there hatred in those brāhmaṇa experts in the three Vedas?”

Vāseṭṭha replied, “Yes, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued:]  
O Vāseṭṭha, Brahmā has no hatred, whereas those [ _brāhmaṇa_ s invariably]  
have anger. Those who have no hatred and those who have hatred cannot  
be mixed together, nor can they realize deliverance together, nor can they  
share the same destiny. Because of these differences, the god Brahmā and  
those _brāhmaṇa_ s cannot abide in the same place.  
[The Buddha continued,] “What do you think, O Vāseṭṭha? Is there resent-  
ment in Brahmā?”  
Vāseṭṭha replied, “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha] again asked, “Is there resentment in those _brāhmaṇa_ experts  
in the three Vedas?”  
Vāseṭṭha replied, “Yes, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued:]  
O Vāseṭṭha, Brahmā has no resentment whereas those [ _brāhmaṇa_ s invari-  
ably] have resentment. Those who have no resentment and those who  
have resentment cannot be mixed together, nor can they realize deliverance  
together, nor can they share the same destiny. Because of these differences,  
the god Brahmā and those _brāhmaṇa_ s cannot abide in the same place.  
[The Buddha continued,] “What do you think, O Vāseṭṭha? Does Brahmā  
enjoy family and wealth?”  
Vāseṭṭha replied, “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha] again asked, “Do those _brāhmaṇa_ experts in the three Vedas  
enjoy family and wealth?”  
Vāseṭṭha replied, “Yes, sir.”  
[The Buddha continued:]  
O Vāseṭṭha, Brahmā has neither family nor wealth, whereas those [ _brāh-  
maṇa_ s invariably] have both. Those who have neither family nor wealth  
and those who have family and wealth cannot be mixed together, they  
cannot realize deliverance together, and they cannot share the same destiny.  
Because of these differences, the god Brahmā and those _brāhmaṇa_ s cannot  
abide in the same place.

[The Buddha continued,] “What do you think, O Vāseṭṭha? Does Brahmā
have total freedom?”
Vāseṭṭha replied, “Yes, sir.”
[The Buddha] again asked, “Do those brāhmaṇa experts in the three Vedas
have total freedom?”
Vāseṭṭha replied, “No, sir.”
[The Buddha continued:]
O Vāseṭṭha, Lord Brahmā has total freedom whereas those brāhmaṇa experts
in the three Vedas have no freedom. Those who have total freedom and those
who have no freedom cannot be mixed together, they cannot realize deliv-
erance together, and they cannot share the same destiny. Because of these
differences, the god Brahmā and those brāhmaṇa s cannot abide in the same
place. Those brāhmaṇa experts in the three Vedas might not be able to reply
in detail when others pose questions on something profound. Is that not so?
Vāseṭṭha replied, “Yes, that is correct, sir.”
Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja then spoke in unison:
Setting these matters aside for a moment, we have heard that the śramaṇa
Gautama knows the path that leads to Brahmā Heaven and can teach it
to others, since he is always conversing with Lord Brahmā. O śramaṇa
Gautama, we earnestly request that Your Reverence reveal to us the path
to Brahmā Heaven and explain it in detail on our behalf.
The Buddha said to Vāseṭṭha, “Now I shall ask you, and you must answer.
What do you think, O Vāseṭṭha? Is the country of Manasākaṭa near or far
from here?”
[Vāseṭṭha] replied, “It is rather near, sir.”
[The Buddha continued:]
If a person has grown up in that country and others ask him about the
roads there, what do you think, Vāseṭṭha? When the person who has grown
up in that country answers a question about the roads there, should anyone
doubt his answer?
[Vāseṭṭha] replied, “No, there should be no doubt whatsoever. Why is
this? Because that person grew up in that country, sir.”

The Buddha said:  
Even if the person had really grown up in that country, others might still  
raise some doubt about his answer. But when someone comes to ask me  
about the path to Brahmā Heaven, there should be no doubt whatsoever.  
Why? Precisely because I am always teaching the path to Brahmā Heaven.  
Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja then said in unison:  
Setting these matters aside for a moment, we have heard that the _śramaṇa_  
Gautama knows the path that leads to Brahmā Heaven and can teach it to  
others, since he is always conversing with Lord Brahmā. O _śramaṇa_ Gau-  
tama, we earnestly request that Your Reverence, with compassion, reveal  
to us the path to Brahmā Heaven and explain it in detail on our behalf.  
The Buddha said, “Listen attentively, and carefully consider what I will  
explain.”  
They replied, “Sir, it is an opportune time.”  
The Buddha continued:  
When the Tathāgata, who is totally free from defilement and perfectly  
enlightened, appears in this world he directly experiences subtle bliss that  
is present throughout the four meditative states of absorption. Why? Through  
his own effort he maintains concentrated mindfulness, enjoying the tran-  
scendence within his mind without any slackening of discipline. Through  
contemplation, he practices the four kinds of immeasurable mind ( _brah-  
mavihāra_ s), first by permeating friendly love ( _maitrī_ ) infinitely in one direc-  
tion, and then likewise in the remaining three directions. Thus he extends  
his immeasurable mind of benevolence universally in all directions, neither  
[divided] nor bound to limitation. Casting away various feelings of hatred,  
leaving no ill-will ( _vyāpāda_ ) in his mind, the Tathāgata enjoys the state of  
tranquility and silence. He also completes the remaining three practices,  
namely, the immeasurable mind of compassion ( _karuṇā_ ), the immeasurable  
mind of sympathetic joy ( _muditā_ ), and the immeasurable mind of equanimity  
( _upekṣā_ ), first permeating infinitely in one direction, and then likewise in  
the remaining three directions. Thus he extends his immeasurable mind of  
benevolence, joy, and equanimity universally in all directions, neither  
[divided] nor bound to limitation. Casting away various feelings of hatred,

leaving no ill-will in his mind, the Tathāgata enjoys the state of tranquility  
and silence. What do you think, O Vāseṭṭha? Is there anger in Brahmā?  
[Vāseṭṭha] replied, “There is no feeling of anger in Lord Brahmā, sir.”  
Again [the Buddha] asked, “Is there anger in the _bhikṣu_ who permeates  
a mind of friendly love?”  
[Vāseṭṭha] replied, “No, sir.”  
The Buddha said:  
Neither Brahmā nor the _bhikṣu_ who permeates a mind of friendly love  
has any feeling of anger. Since both have no anger, Brahmā and the _bhikṣu_  
share the same destiny ( _gati_ ) and the same deliverance. Because of this,  
Brahmā and the _bhikṣu_ can act together anywhere. What do you think, O  
Vāseṭṭha? Is there hatred in Brahmā?”  
[Vāseṭṭha] replied, “There is no hatred in Lord Brahmā, sir.”  
Again [the Buddha] said, “Is there hatred in the _bhikṣu_ who permeates a  
mind of friendly love?  
[Vāseṭṭha] replied, “No, sir.”  
The Buddha said:  
Neither Brahmā nor the _bhikṣu_ who permeates a mind of friendly love  
has any feeling of hatred. Since both have no hatred, Brahmā and the  
_bhikṣu_ share the same destiny and the same deliverance. Because of this,  
Brahmā and the _bhikṣu_ can act together anywhere.”  
The Buddha again asked, “What do you think, O Vāseṭṭha? Is there resent-  
ment in Brahmā?”  
[Vāseṭṭha] replied, “There is no resentment in Lord Brahmā, sir.”  
The Buddha asked again, “Is there resentment in the _bhikṣu_ who permeates  
a mind of friendly love?”  
[Vāseṭṭha] replied, “No, sir.”  
The Buddha said:  
Neither Brahmā nor the _bhikṣu_ has any feeling of resentment. Since neither  
have any resentment, Brahmā and the _bhikṣu_ share the same destiny and  
the same deliverance. Because of this, Brahmā and the _bhikṣu_ can act  
together anywhere.  

[The Buddha continued,] “What do you think, O Vāseṭṭha? Does Brahmā  
enjoy family and wealth?”  
Vāseṭṭha replied, “No, sir.”  
[The Buddha] again asked: “Does the _bhikṣu_ who permeates a mind of  
friendly love enjoy family and wealth?”  
[Vāseṭṭha] replied, “No, sir.”  
The Buddha said:  
Neither Brahmā nor the _bhikṣu_ has family or wealth. Since neither have  
any family or wealth, they share the same destiny and deliverance. Because  
of this, Brahmā and the _bhikṣu_ can act together anywhere.  
[The Buddha continued,] “What do you think, O Vāseṭṭha? Does Brahmā  
have total freedom?”  
[Vāseṭṭha] replied, “Yes, sir.”  
[The Buddha] again asked, “Does the _bhikṣu_ who permeates a mind of  
friendly love have total freedom?”  
Vāseṭṭha replied, “Yes, sir.”  
The Buddha said:  
Both Brahmā and the _bhikṣu_ have attained total freedom equally, and they  
share the same destiny and deliverance. Because of this, Brahmā and the  
_bhikṣu_ can act together anywhere.  
The Buddha said to Vāseṭṭha:  
You should know that the _bhikṣu_ who permeates a mind of friendly love  
will be born in Brahmā Heaven on the dissolution of his body at the end  
of life, as swiftly as an arrow striking its target.  
When the Buddha completed this teaching, Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja real-  
ized at that moment the termination of all defilements, thereby acquiring  
genuine insight into the nature of the Dharma. Having heard the Buddha’s  
teaching, Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were delighted to receive it, and they rev-  
erentially carried out what the Buddha taught.
