### Brahmā’s Net

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 1: Brahmājāla Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. Once, when the Buddha was visiting the communities of  
the country of Magadha, accompanied by one thousand two hundred and fifty  
disciples ( _bhikṣu_ s), he stopped at the king’s pavilion in the bamboo forest for  
an overnight stay. A _brāhmaṇa_ ascetic called Suppiya, accompanied by his  
student Brahmadatta, always followed the Buddha on his travels. The teacher  
Suppiya denigrated the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha in various ways, but his  
student Brahmadatta praised the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha in innumerable  
ways. Thus, teacher and student, having different minds, were in opposition  
to each other. Why did they behave in this way? It was because they differed  
in their customs, views, and manner of making known their views.  
On this occasion, a number of _bhikṣu_ s, having completed almsrounds,  
gathered in the lecture hall and began to talk [about current events]:

It is marvelous, indeed marvelous, that the World-honored One commands  
great supernormal powers and is endowed with the meritorious virtue of  
knowing what sentient beings wish for and their destinies. Yet this _brāh-  
maṇa_ ascetic Suppiya and his student Brahmadatta always follow the  
Tathāgata and the assembly of his disciples. Suppiya denigrates the Buddha,  
Dharma, and Sangha of the _bhikṣu_ s in innumerable ways, while Brahma-  
datta praises the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha in innumerable ways. Thus,  
teacher and student are of different minds and oppose one another. Why  
is this so? It is because they have different customs, views, and ways of  
making their views known.  
While this was going on, the World-honored One, meditating in seclusion,  
heard what the _bhikṣu_ s were saying through a supernormal power of hearing  
exceeding the capacity of ordinary people. The World-honored One stood  
up from his seat, proceeded to the lecture hall, sat down before the group of

88b12

bhikṣu s, and though he already knew what they were discussing, deliberately
asked them, “O bhikṣu s, why have you gathered in this hall? What are you
discussing?”
The bhikṣu s replied to the Buddha:
Having returned from almsrounds we gathered in this hall to discuss a
topic of [current] concern: “It is marvelous, indeed marvelous, that the
World-honored One commands great supernormal powers and is endowed
with the meritorious virtue of knowing what sentient beings wish for and
their destinies. Yet the brāhmaṇa ascetic Suppiya and his student Brahma -
datta always follow the Tathāgata and the assembly of disciples. While
Suppiya denigrates the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha in innumerable
ways, Brahmadatta praises the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha in innumer-
able ways. Teacher and student are of different minds and oppose one
another. Why are they different? They have different customs and views
and also differ in their manner of making their views known.” We have
been engaged in discussion about this matter, sir.
The World-honored One said to the bhikṣu s:
Even if the person in question deliberately denigrates the Tathāgata, the
Dharma, and the Sangha, you should neither become angry nor have ill
intent against him. Why? If you become angry and have ill intent because
he has denigrated the Tathāgata, Dharma, and Sangha, you will have
become entrapped and fallen into a pit. To avoid this danger you should
never generate ill intent against him. And if he were to praise the Buddha,
Dharma, and Sangha, you should not feel delight or gratification. Why?
If you were delighted or gratified, you would have become entrapped and
fallen into a pit again. To avoid this danger you should never be swayed
by such sweet words. Why? When a person either denigrates or praises
something, his words are brought about only by lesser factors of conduct
or moral discipline. An ordinary person, with little learning, cannot reach
a deeper level of understanding. He takes whatever he observes externally
as real and, because of this, praises it.
What do “lesser factors of conduct or moral discipline” mean? An ordi-
nary person, with little learning, cannot understand any deeper meaning.

He takes whatever he observes externally as real. Because of this, he  
praises it. He may praise me: “The _śramaṇa_ Gautama has discarded the  
sword and cane (i.e., weapons), removed any intent to harm life, and extin-  
guished every action that injures life, extending compassion in good con-  
science to all sentient beings.” What these words praise are only lesser  
factors of conduct or moral discipline. An ordinary person, with little  
learning, praises the Buddha because of these external factors.  
A person may again praise me: “The _śramaṇa_ Gautama has removed  
any intention to commit theft, extinguished every desire to take what is  
not given, and is totally free from any thought of theft.” Or he may offer  
this kind of praise: “The _śramaṇa_ Gautama has abandoned carnal desire  
and adheres to the genuine practice of austerity, upholds the precepts,  
avoids dissolute behavior, and maintains pure and genuine conduct.” Or  
[he may offer this praise:] “The _śramaṇa_ Gautama has abandoned and  
eradicated false speech; whenever he speaks he does so with utmost sin-  
cerity. Whatever he says is true and factual, and he never deceives the  
people of the world.” Or [he may offer this praise:] “The _śramaṇa_ Gautama  
has abandoned and eradicated duplicitous speech; he never harms anyone  
by repeating to them another’s words, [or vice versa]. If two people are  
in a dispute he tries to reconcile them, and when they are reconciled he  
is even more greatly pleased. If he wishes to say something to either party,  
he does so with both of them together before him. He knows the right  
time for whatever he does.” Or [he may offer this praise:] “The _śramaṇa_  
Gautama has abandoned and eradicated harsh speech. When spoken, harsh  
words may hurt the feelings of listeners and give rise to enmity in those  
to whom such speech is directed. Since harsh words can aggravate feelings  
of affliction or malice, he never utters them. He always uses good words,  
pleasing the one to whom they are directed. Thus he endears himself to  
all members of the sangha, who never tire of listening to his words. Such  
is the nature of whatever he says.” Or [he may offer this praise:] “The  
_śramaṇa_ Gautama has abandoned and eradicated flattery. He speaks when  
it is the right time; he utters words that correspond to facts, words that  
benefit others, words that are in compliance with the Dharma, words that  
are in compliance with the rules of Vinaya discipline, and words that  
forbid evil. Such is the nature of whatever he says.”

Or [he may offer this praise:] “The śramaṇa Gautama has abandoned
the use of intoxicants and distanced himself from them. He uses no per-
fumes or flowers as ornaments, he does not attend theatrical entertainments
involving song and dance, he does not use a high, wide couch [for a bed],
nor does he partake of food other than at the proper time each day. He
neither accepts nor keeps money in gold and silver coins, nor does he
marry or live with a woman, or keep a servant or maid, or an elephant,
horse, boar, sheep, hen, dog, or any other bird or animal. He does not keep
an army, whether a division of elephants, or cavalry, chariots, or foot sol-
diers, nor does he own rice fields or residential houses, or plant the five
kinds of crops for harvest. He does not threaten others with his hands and
fists, nor does he cheat others by using rigged scales for weights and quan-
tities, engage in usury, or haggle over the price [for goods]. He does not
neglect repayment after receiving a request for payment of a debt, nor
does he conspire against anyone. He never acts at an improper time and
he nurtures his health to lengthen his life span and takes only the proper
amount of food for his needs. Wherever he goes his robe and almsbowl
accompany him, just as a bird’s feathers never leave it when it flies.” All
these are lesser factors of moral discipline. An ordinary person, with little
learning, praises the Buddha for such externally observable things.
[Such an ordinary person may also praise the Tathāgata in regard to
these minor points:] “Other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, having received
charity from their devotees, actively seek more and more in order to store
up extra goods, knowing no limit or contentment in regard to clothing,
food, and drink. The śramaṇa Gautama has never engaged in this behavior.
“Other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, having received charity from their
devotees, engage in various means of livelihood as well as planting crops,
thus inviting evil spirits. The śramaṇa Gautama has never engaged in
such behavior.
“Other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, having received charity from their
devotees, use expedient means to acquire various material goods such as
ivory and other precious items, high and comfortable beds, embroidered
cloth, carpets, bamboo floor mats, and cushions. The śramaṇa Gautama
has never engaged in such behavior.

“Other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, having received charity from their  
devotees, vainly seek to improve their appearance [to impress their devo-  
tees], using various measures such as applying thyme-seed oil to the body,  
bathing in scented water, wearing scented powder on the body, applying  
fragrant hair oil, wearing a flower garland, using blue eye shadow and  
applying makeup to their faces, wearing a shiny clasp ring and string on  
their garments, examining their appearance in a mirror, donning a pair of  
multicolored shoes and a white upper garment, holding a canopy over their  
heads, carrying a fly whisk, and decorating their carriages with banners.  
The _śramaṇa_ Gautama has never engaged in such behavior.  
“Other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, [having received charity from their  
devotees,] engage in various games and amusements such as chess, check-  
ers played on boards of eight or ten squares, and gambling in as many as  
a hundred thousand ways. The _śramaṇa_ Gautama has never engaged in  
such behavior.  
“Other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, having subsisted on charity from  
their devotees, engage in idle talk that obstructs religious pursuits, such  
as gossiping about royal affairs or various battles or the uses of cavalry,  
or how well certain bureaucrats and ministers ride their horses when they  
go on excursions, going to and from parks and pleasure gardens; or they  
talk about the daily activities of women, such as when they are lying  
down, sitting, and walking; or [they talk] about clothing, food, and drink,  
or the behavior of relatives, or the activities of sea divers and their col-  
lections of treasures from the ocean. The _śramaṇa_ Gautama has never  
engaged in such behavior.  
“Other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, having subsisted on charity from  
their devotees, seek wrong livelihood through innumerable devices, such  
as engaging in flattery or slander, thereby seeking to take advantage of  
one another. The _śramaṇa_ Gautama has never engaged in such behavior.  
“Other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, having subsisted on charity from  
their devotees, engage in disputes wherever they may be, whether in a  
pleasure grove, a bathing pond, or pavilion, accusing each other as to who  
is right or wrong. They say, ‘I know the text and rules but you have little  
knowledge of them. I am on the right course but yours is a deviation. Your

argument is confused, asserting too late what should have been stated ear-
lier, while giving out too early what should have been saved for later. I
am able to tolerate you but you cannot tolerate me. Whatever you say is
neither true nor real. Whenever you feel some doubt about your position,
come and ask me about it. I surely can answer all your questions.’ The
śramaṇa Gautama has never engaged in such behavior.
“Other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, having subsisted on charity from
their devotees, seek greater [rewards or benefits] by contriving various
measures. For instance, they may carry an official communication or
private message on behalf of a king or a minister, or a brāhmaṇa or a
householder, going from place to place while traveling about. They may
carry letters for clients, delivering them to their designated recipients, and
convey the replies to their clients. Or they may even give instruction about
how to conduct the business of mail delivery for their own sake or for
others. The śramaṇa Gautama has never engaged in such behavior.
“Other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, having subsisted on charity from
their devotees, are engaged solely in learning the ins and outs of military
strategy, warfare, and conflict; or learning about armaments such as swords,
canes, bows and arrows; or learning how to make domestic animals, such
as roosters, dogs, boars, or goats, fight; or how to stage fights between men
and women; or how to perform various skills, such as making the sound
of a multitude [of soldiers] by blowing conch shells, beating drums, singing,
dancing, brandishing streamers; and all sorts of other activities. The śramaṇa
Gautama has never engaged in such behavior.
“Other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, having subsisted on charity from
their devotees, are engaged in ignoble ways of life (lit., “animalistic behav-
ior”), learning false paths [that obstruct the authentic path of religion] and
taking up wrong livelihoods, such as fortune-telling for male or female
clients for material gain. Interpreting auspicious or ominous signs, they
predict whether their clients will be handsome or ugly and make similar
predictions regarding animals [for their clients in the husbandry business].
The śramaṇa Gautama has never engaged in such behavior.
“Other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, having subsisted on charity from
their devotees, engage in ignoble ways of life by learning false paths that
obstruct [the authentic path of religion] and taking up wrong livelihoods,

such as performing magical incantations to invoke the presence of ghostly  
spirits or to drive them away, or to cause them to linger with various repug-  
nant spells. Thus, through many strategies, they may threaten people and  
cause them to feel extreme fear, or draw people together or disperse them,  
or torment them, or bring them pleasure. They may use incantations to  
calm a pregnant woman, providing a [magical] garment for the safety of  
her fetus, or to change a human being into a donkey, or to cause someone  
to become totally deaf and dumb. Displaying a multitude of techniques,  
they may be seen facing the sun or moon, holding it in both hands, and  
performing various ascetic feats to solicit material gain. The _śramaṇa_ Gau-  
tama has never engaged in such behavior.  
“Other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, having subsisted on charity from  
their devotees, engage in ignoble ways of life by learning false paths that  
obstruct [the authentic path of religion] and taking up wrong livelihoods,  
such as chanting magical spells for curing illness or applying evil spells  
or good spells, or giving medical treatment, acupuncture, moxa cautery,  
or medicines to treat various illnesses [in order to obtain material gain].  
The _śramaṇa_ Gautama has never engaged in such behavior.  
“Other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, having subsisted on charity from their  
devotees, engage in ignoble ways of life by learning false paths that obstruct  
[the authentic path of religion] and taking up wrong livelihoods, such as  
casting magical spells for water or fire, or to summon a ghostly spirit, or to  
assure victory in a political or military campaign, or for elephants, or bodily  
limbs, or a talisman to ensure the safety of a residence, or for recovery from  
burns, or to effect a cure from rat bites. They may intone a written incantation  
to discern the life or death of the concerned person, or to decipher dreams,  
or they may read palms (chiromancy) and facial features (physiognomy), or  
chant astronomical texts or the alphabetical characters. The _śramaṇa_ Gautama  
has never engaged in such behavior.  
“Other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, having subsisted on charity from  
their devotees, engage in ignoble ways of life by learning false paths that  
obstruct [the authentic path of religion] and taking up wrong livelihoods,  
such as observing the weather and the cycle of the seasons in order to pre-  
dict whether or not it will rain, whether the price of crops will go up or  
down, whether there will be an epidemic, whether a fearful event will

take place, or whether there will be peace and safety. Or they may predict
earthquakes or the appearance of a comet, a solar or lunar eclipse, or a
stellar eclipse, or the nonappearance of such an eclipse, in order to deter-
mine whether it is a good or bad omen. The śramaṇa Gautama has never
engaged in such behavior.
“Other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, having subsisted on charity from
their devotees, engage in ignoble ways of life by learning false paths that
obstruct [the authentic path of religion] and taking up wrong livelihoods,
such as asserting that this country is superior to that country, or that that
is not like this, or that another country is superior to this country, or that
this is not like that. Observing good or bad omens, they predict the fortunes
and fates of those countries with which they are concerned. The śramaṇa
Gautama has never engaged in such behavior.”
O bhikṣu s, all of the foregoing are invariably lesser moral virtues and
factors. An ordinary person, with little learning, praises the Buddha on
account of such [observable] virtues.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
There is, however, a greater insight (i.e., the Dharma), most profound and
subtle, and far more radiant. Only wise and saintly disciples can praise
the Tathāgata by referring to this greater insight. What is this greater
insight, most profound and subtle and far more radiant, on account of
which the wise and saintly disciples alone can praise the Tathāgata?
Some śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s have conjectured, in relation to the
initial eon ( kalpa ) of the past and the final eon of the future, innumerable
varieties of views as freely as they may wish, but all the theories they
have thus advanced, without exception, fall into sixty-two variations. All
these philosophical views, insofar as they are speculative in regard to the
initial eon of the past and the final eon of the future, no matter how numer-
ous and obsessively formulated, never exceed sixty-two variations. Why
are these philosophical views formulated in regard to the initial eon and
the final eon, no matter how numerous and obsessively speculative, invari-
ably limited to sixty-two variations, never exceeding that number?
[Moreover,] regardless of the innumerable varieties of views advanced
by śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, insofar as these views are speculative and

asserted in relation to the initial eon of the world, all these theories can  
be classified exhaustively into eighteen variations. Any philosophical  
views, insofar as they are conjectured in regard to the initial eon of the  
past, no matter how numerous and obsessively formulated, are invariably  
limited to eighteen variations and never exceed that number. Why are  
these philosophical views formulated in regard to the initial eon, no matter  
how numerous and obsessively conjectured and asserted, invariably limited  
to eighteen variations, never exceeding that number?  
Many _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, while speculating about the initial eon  
of the past, propose an eternalist view ( _śāśvata-vāda_ ), asserting that “the  
self and the world are permanent.” Any theory that asserts this eternalist  
view falls within four variations and does not exceed those four. Why is the  
eternalist view proposed by those _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s concerning the  
initial eon of the past, namely, that “the self and the world are permanent,”  
limited to four variations without exceeding that number?  
Again, a _śramaṇa_ or _brāhmaṇa_ , having entered mental concentration  
by various means, recollects with a concentrated mind the twenty evolving  
and devolving eons. He then asserts his theory: “The self and the world  
are permanent. This theory is true while the rest is false. Why? Because  
I entered the state of mental concentration through various means and  
with a concentrated mind recollected twenty evolving and devolving eons.  
The sentient beings of the world have neither increased nor decreased  
throughout those eons. They always assembled together and never dis-  
persed. Because of this, I know that the self and the world are permanent.  
This theory alone is true while the rest is false.” This is the first variation.  
On the basis of this assertion, other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s conjectured  
that the self and the world are permanent. This theory is limited to four  
variations, however, and does not exceed that number.  
Again, a _śramaṇa_ or _brāhmaṇa_ , having entered mental concentration  
through various means, recollects with a concentrated mind forty evolving  
and devolving eons and asserts his theory: “The self and the world are per-  
manent. This theory is true while the rest is false. Why? Because I entered  
mental concentration through various means and with a concentrated mind  
recollected forty evolving and devolving eons. The sentient beings in the  
world neither increased nor decreased; they always assembled together

and never dispersed. Because of this, I know that the self and the world
are permanent, and this theory alone is true while the rest is false.” This
is the second variation. Thus, on the foregoing assertion concerning the
initial eon, other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s conjectured that the self and
the world are permanent. But this theory is limited to four variations and
does not exceed that number.
Again, a śramaṇa or brāhmaṇa , having entered mental concentration
through various means, recollects with a concentrated mind eighty evolving
and devolving eons and asserts his theory: “The self and the world are
permanent. This theory is true while the rest is false. Why? Because I
entered mental concentration through various means and with a concen-
trated mind recollected eighty evolving and devolving eons. The sentient
beings of the world neither increased nor decreased; they always assembled
together and never dispersed. Because of this I know that the self and the
world are permanent, and this theory alone is true while the rest is false.”
This is the third variation. Thus, on the foregoing assertion concerning
the initial eon, other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s conjectured that the self
and the world are permanent. But this theory is limited to four variations
and does not exceed that number.
Again, a śramaṇa or brāhmaṇa with a rationally skeptical mind exam-
ines the case carefully and investigates the theories in various ways through
his knowledge of logic and sophistry. He says that these theories require
examination. Based on his own view and on the rhetoric of reason, he
theorizes: “The self and the world are permanent, and this theory has four
variations.” Similar śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s have conjectured in relation
to the initial eon that the self and the world are permanent. On account
of there being four variations of the [eternalist] view, this theory does not
go beyond them. Originally each śramaṇa or brāhmaṇa speculated about
the initial eon and theorized that the self and the world are permanent. In
this manner, all the theories previously advanced fall into four variations
and do not exceed that number.
The Tathāgata alone, however, knows the basis of the views held by
the eternalists, to which they are attached, and from which they receive
[theoretical] retribution. The Tathāgata’s knowledge goes beyond these
variations because he knows the very basis of these eternalist views but

does not become attached to such views. Since he is not attached to such  
a view, he is in a state of quiescence and cessation (i.e., free from con-  
ceptualization). He knows the arising of sensation ( _vedanā_ ), its dissolution  
( _bhaṅga_ ), its taste ( _āsvāda_ ), its danger ( _ādīnara_ ), and the method of tran-  
scending it ( _niḥsaraṇa_ ). Thus he is liberated [from eternalist speculation]  
because of his nonattachment ( _anupādāya-vimukti_ ) [to the basis of that  
view] through the very insight of seeing things universally as they really  
are ( _yathābhuccaṃ samā_ ). Therefore he is called the Tathāgata. This is  
the great insight, most profound and subtle, and far more radiant. In ref-  
erence to this insight wise and saintly disciples can properly praise the  
Tathāgata for the universal insight that sees things as they really are.  
Again, there is another great insight, most profound and subtle and far  
more radiant, in reference to which wise and saintly disciples can [properly]  
praise the Tathāgata for the universal insight that sees things as they really  
are. What is this insight?  
Many _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s propose an eternalist view in their  
speculations on the initial eon of the past and assert that “the self and the  
world are in part permanent and in part impermanent.” On the basis of this  
theory, other _śramaṇa_ s or _brāhmaṇa_ s speculated about the initial eon of  
the past and asserted that the self and the world are in part permanent and  
in part impermanent. But this theory essentially coincides with the four  
variations and does not go beyond them. At the beginning, when this eon  
began to evolve, the remaining sentient beings, having exhausted their  
merits, life spans, and predispositional forces, died in Ābhāsvara Heaven  
(the highest attainable in the second _dhyāna_ ) and were reborn in the vast  
empty space of Brahmā Heaven. They became fond of that abode and  
wished to be born there again together with other sentient beings. In this  
way, the [first generation] of sentient beings there already conceived an  
attachment to that abode. As other sentient beings ended their life in Ābhās-  
vara Heaven and were reborn in the vast, empty space of Brahmā Heaven,  
those who were already there thought to themselves, “I am Brahmā, the  
great Brahmā. By nature I exist and there is no one who can create me. I  
am omniscient and control a thousand worlds in which I am the absolutely  
free presider and the noblest and most honorable, for I have the miraculous  
power of changing forms. I alone have been here before as father of all

sentient beings prior to their appearance, because they appeared here after
I did, and those beings are ones whom I created.”
Those who came after the first generation thought to themselves, “He
is the great Brahmā, he has created himself and no one else could create
him. He is omniscient and controls a thousand worlds where he is the
absolutely free and most honorable presider, for he has the miraculous
power of changing forms. He alone has been here before us as the father
of all sentient beings prior to our appearance. We came to be born after
him and were created by him.” Some of the gods of Brahmā Heaven, hav-
ing ended their life spans and exhausted all their predispositions, were
then born in the human world and gradually grew to adolescence. They
shaved their hair and beards, donned the three robes, and renounced domes-
tic life to take up religious practice. Having entered mental concentration,
some came to know with a concentrated mind their original nature and
asserted, “That great Brahmā created himself; no one else could create
him. He is omniscient and controls a thousand worlds where he is the
absolutely free and most honorable presider. He has the miraculous power
of changing forms and is the father of all sentient beings. He is the one
that is permanent and, as Brahmā, he created us, we human beings who
are impermanent, subject to change, and mortal, unable to exist forever.”
Because of this, they asserted, “The self and the world are in part permanent
and in part impermanent. This theory is true while the rest is false.” This
is called the first view. On the basis of this theory, other śramaṇa s and
brāhmaṇa s proposed their own theories concerning the initial eon. But
this “in part permanent and in part impermanent” theory is identical with
the others within the four variations and does not go beyond them.
Again, some sentient beings in Brahmā Heaven enjoyed amusements
(lit., “played and laughed”) and wanted a leisurely life. They played games
and sought amusement frequently, enjoying their [heavenly] lives. In
pursuit of that life, they eventually fell into exhaustion and lost conscious-
ness, and their life spans came to an end. Being reborn in the human world,
they gradually grew to adolescence and shaved their hair and beards,
donned the three robes, and renounced domestic life for a life of religious
practice. Entering mental concentration, some of them came to know their
origin with a concentrated mind and said, “Some sentient beings (i.e., the

gods of Brahmā Heaven) are not born in the human world as often as we  
are, nor do they pursue fun and amusement, and so they remain forever  
in that heaven, without any change at all. On the other hand, we often  
seek fun and engage in the pursuit of amusement, and so we are subject  
to change and the law of impermanence.” Because of this, they asserted,  
“The self and the world are in part permanent and in part impermanent.  
This theory is true while the rest is false.” This is the second variation.  
On the basis of this view, other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s proposed theories  
about the initial eon and asserted that “the self and the world are in part  
permanent and in part impermanent.” Yet this theory is essentially identical  
with the others within the four variations and does not go beyond them.  
Again, some sentient beings [in Brahmā Heaven] engaged in meditation  
or mutual reflection and, while doing so, lost consciousness. Ending their  
lives in this manner, they were born in the human world. Growing to ado-  
lescence, they shaved their hair and beards, donned the three robes, and  
renounced domestic life for religious practice. Entering mental concen-  
tration, some of them came to know their origin with a concentrated mind  
and said, “Some sentient beings (i.e., the gods of Brahmā Heaven) do not  
meditate or mutually reflect upon each other and so do not lose conscious-  
ness. They therefore remain [in that heaven], unchanged at all times.  
[Unlike them,] we looked at each other often and in doing so we lost con-  
sciousness. This was due to the impermanence of all things and in com-  
pliance with the law of change. Because of this, we know that the self  
and the world are in part permanent and in part impermanent. This theory  
alone is true while the rest is false.” This is the third variation. On the  
basis of this view, other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s proposed theories about  
the initial eon and asserted, “The self and the world are in part permanent  
and in part impermanent.” But this theory is identical with the others  
within the four variations and does not go beyond them.  
Again, a _śramaṇa_ or _brāhmaṇa_ with a rationally skeptical mind examines  
the case carefully and investigates the theories in various ways through  
his knowledge of logic and sophistry. He asserts, “The self and the world  
are in part permanent and in part impermanent. This theory alone is true  
while the rest is false.” This is the fourth variation. On the basis of this  
view, other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s proposed theories concerning the

initial eon of the past and asserted, “The self and the world are in part per-
manent and in part impermanent.” But this theory is identical with the
others within the four variations and does not go beyond them.
Thus, in relation to the initial eon, some śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s pro-
posed theories that the self and the world are in part permanent and in part
impermanent, and this view is limited to four variations and does not go
beyond them. Only the Tathāgata, however, knows the very basis of the
[common] view to which those who espouse the foregoing four theories
hold fast, to which they become attached, and from which they receive its
[theoretical] retribution. The Tathāgata’s knowledge goes beyond the con-
fines of these variations because he knows the very basis of the eternalist
view but he does not become attached to such a view. Since he is not
attached to this view, he is in a state of quiescence and cessation (i.e., free
from conceptualization). He knows the causal concatenation of sensation
and its cessation, its gratification and danger, and the method of transcending
it. Thus he is liberated [from eternalist speculation] because of his nonat-
tachment [to the basis of that view] through the very insight of seeing
things universally as they really are. Therefore he is called the Tathāgata.
This is the great insight, most profound and subtle and far more radiant.
In reference to this insight, wise and saintly disciples can properly praise
the Tathāgata for the universal insight that sees things as they really are.
Again, there is another great insight, most profound and subtle and far
more radiant, in reference to which wise and saintly disciples can [properly]
praise the Tathāgata for the universal insight that sees things as they really
are. What is this insight? Many śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s proposed a
speculative view of the initial eon of the past and asserted, “The self and
the world are limited and limitless.” Other śramaṇa s or brāhmaṇa s, relying
on this view, speculated further about the initial eon of the past and asserted
that the self and the world are limited and limitless. [Again,] this theory
is essentially identical with the others within the four variations and does
not go beyond them.
For instance, some śramaṇa s or brāhmaṇa s, having entered mental
concentration through various means, observed the world with a concen-
trated mind and formulated the thought that there is a limit to this world.
They asserted the theory, “This world has a limit, and this alone is true

while the rest is false. Why? Because I entered mental concentration  
through various means and with a concentrated mind intuited the limit of  
this world. Therefore this world is limited. This theory alone is true while  
the rest is false.” This is the first variation. Other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s,  
having relied on this view, speculated about the initial eon of the past and  
proposed the same theory that the self and the world are limited, but this  
theory is essentially identical with the others within the four variations  
and does not go beyond them.  
Again, some _śramaṇa_ s or _brāhmaṇa_ s, having entered mental concentration  
through various means, observed the world with a concentrated mind and  
formulated the thought that this world is limitless; thus they asserted the  
theory “This world is limitless, and this alone is true while the rest is false.  
Why? Because I entered mental concentration through various means and  
with a concentrated mind intuited no limit to this world. Therefore this world  
is limitless. This alone is true while the rest is false.” This is the second vari-  
ation. Other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, having relied on this view, speculated  
about the initial eon of the past and proposed similar theories that the self  
and the world are limitless. But these theories are essentially identical with  
the others within the four variations and do not range beyond them.  
Again, some _śramaṇa_ s or _brāhmaṇa_ s, having entered mental concen-  
tration through various means, observed the world with a concentrated  
mind and formulated the thought that the world is limited vertically in  
the upward direction but has no limit in all four horizontal directions, and  
thus they asserted, “The world is both limited and limitless. This alone is  
true while the rest is false. Why? Because I entered mental concentration  
through various means and with a concentrated mind intuited that this  
world has a limit in the upward direction but has no limit in all four hor-  
izontal directions. Therefore [the self and] this world are both limited and  
limitless. This theory alone is true while the rest is false.” This is the third  
variation. Other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, having relied on this view,  
speculated about the initial eon of the past and proposed theories that [the  
self and] the world are both limited and limitless. But these theories are  
essentially identical with the others within the four variations and do not  
range beyond them.

Again, some śramaṇa s or brāhmaṇa s examined the case carefully with
a rationally skeptical mind and investigated the theories in various ways
through their knowledge of logic and sophistry. They said, “The self and
the world are neither limited nor limitless. This alone is true and the rest
is false.” This is the fourth variation. On the basis of this theory, [however,]
other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s proposed similar theories about the initial
eon and asserted, “The self and the world are both limited and limitless.”
Yet these theories are identical with the others within the four variations
and do not range beyond them.
Thus the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s formulated their theories about the
initial eon and asserted that the self and the world are both limited and
limitless, yet all of this falls within the four variations without exceeding
that number. Only the Tathāgata, however, knows the very basis of the
[common] view to which those who espouse the foregoing four theories
hold fast, to which they are attached, and from which they receive [the-
oretical] retribution. The Tathāgata’s knowledge exceeds these variations
because he knows the very basis of their views but does not become
attached to such a view. Since he is not attached to this view, he is in a
state of quiescence and cessation (i.e., free from conceptualization). He
knows the causal concatenation of sensation and its cessation, its gratifi-
cation and danger, and the method of transcending it. Thus he is liberated
[from eternalist speculation] because of his nonattachment [to the basis
of that view] through the very insight of seeing things universally as they
really are. Therefore he is called the Tathāgata. This is the great insight,
most profound and subtle and far more radiant. In reference to this insight,
wise and saintly disciples can properly praise the Tathāgata for the universal
insight that sees things as they really are.
Again, there is another great insight, most profound and subtle and far
more radiant, in reference to which wise and saintly disciples can properly
praise the Tathāgata for the universal insight that sees things as they really
are. What is this insight? Some śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s raise inconsistent
questions and reply with inconsistent answers. When one asks an incon-
gruent question of another, the latter replies to the former with an incon-
gruent answer. Within the four variations of this view, each theory is essen-
tially identical and does not go beyond the limit of those variations. On

the basis of this view, _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s raise incongruent questions  
and reply with incongruent answers while speculating about the initial  
eon of the past. Any of their theories is identical with the others within  
the four variations and does not go beyond them.  
For instance, some _śramaṇa_ s or _brāhmaṇa_ s formulate a theory and  
assert, “I have neither seen nor known whether there is a resulting effect  
for good or bad [conduct, respectively]. Since I have neither seen nor  
known [such an effect], I raise this question [in formulating the theory]:  
‘Are there causal effects for good and bad [conduct], respectively?’ In this  
world there are _śramaṇa_ s or _brāhmaṇa_ s who are learned and erudite, saga-  
cious and knowledgeable, who are always delighted to stay in a secluded  
place, who are excellent in speech and precise in debate, and so [these _śra-  
maṇa_ s or _brāhmaṇa_ s] are honored in this world. With their wisdom they  
can analyze a multiplicity of worldly views [into some type of a system].  
[They say, however,] ‘If I am asked a question that involves profound  
meanings, I may not be able to give an answer. I feel ashamed before the  
questioner and I am afraid. [So] I give my answer in a certain manner that  
I regard as my refuge, my island, my shelter, and my ultimate path.’ When-  
ever someone like that asks me a [profound] question, I answer in the fol-  
lowing manner: (1) ‘This fact is like this.’ (2) ‘This fact is identical (i.e.,  
true).’ (3) ‘This fact is different.’ (4) ‘This fact is not different.’ (5) ‘This  
fact is neither different nor not different.’” This is the first question-and-  
answer variation. Based on these responses, other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s  
may also reply with incongruent answers to incongruent questions. These  
[theoretical] answers are identical with the others within the four variations,  
however, and do not range beyond them.  
Again, some _śramaṇa_ s or _brāhmaṇa_ s formulate a theory and assert:  
“I have neither seen nor known [personally] whether or not there is an  
afterlife. Many _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s are able to see things at remote  
distances through their supernormal vision and power of reading others’  
minds. Even when they are approached by other people they do not see  
them. That kind of person should be able to know whether or not there is  
an afterlife. I myself have neither seen nor known [personally] whether  
or not there is an afterlife. If I were to express my view [in either the affir-  
mative or the negative], I am afraid that my answer is bound to be false.

Therefore, I regard [‘non-assertion’] as my refuge, my island, my shelter,
and my ultimate path. If such a person were to ask me a [profound] question,
I would answer in the following manner: (1) ‘This fact is like this.’ (2) ‘This
fact is identical (i.e., true).’ (3) ‘This fact is different.’ (4) ‘This fact is not
different.’ (5) ‘This fact is neither different nor not different.’” This is the
second question-and-answer variation. Based on these responses, other śra-
maṇa s and brāhmaṇa s may reply with an incongruent answer when the
question is incongruent. But these [theoretical] answers are identical with
the others within the four variations and do not range beyond them.
Again, some śramaṇa s or brāhmaṇa s formulate a theory and assert:
“I have neither seen nor known what is good and what is not good. I do
not know nor have I encountered a theory that asserts ‘This is good’ or
‘This is bad.’ Because I do not know either one, I feel desire [for a certain
thing]; because of this desire, I feel anger. Whenever there is desire and
anger I am bound to have a sensation [about a certain thing]. I wish to
annihilate this sensation. Therefore, I have renounced domestic life for
religious practice.” [In this case,] such a person is very much afraid of
incurring sensation and regards [the absence of sensation] as a refuge, an
island, a shelter, and an ultimate path, saying, “If someone asks me a ques-
tion [about what is good and what is bad], I shall reply to him in the fol-
lowing manner: (1) ‘This fact is like this.’ (2) ‘This fact is identical (i.e.,
true).’ (3) ‘This fact is different.’ (4) ‘This fact is not different.’ (5) ‘This
fact is neither different nor not different.’” This is the third question-and-
answer variation. Based on these responses, other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s
may reply with an incongruent answer when the question is incongruent.
Yet these [theoretical] answers are identical with the others within the
four variations and do not range beyond them.
Again, some śramaṇa s or brāhmaṇa s are unintelligent and stupid. If
someone questions them, they reply according to someone else’s answer,
namely, (1) “This fact is like this.” (2) “This fact is identical (i.e., true).”
(3) “This fact is different.” (4) “This fact is not different.” (5) “This fact
is neither different nor not different.” This is the fourth question-and-
answer variation. Based on these responses, other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s
may reply with an incongruent answer when the question is incongruent.

Their [theoretical] answers are identical with the others within the four  
variations, however, and do not range beyond them.  
Some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s raise inconsistent questions and reply  
with inconsistent answers in regard to the initial eon of the past. These  
theoretical answers are limited to the four variations, are [essentially]  
identical, and do not exceed that limit. Only the Tathāgata knows the very  
basis of the [common] answers to which the foregoing four theorists hold  
fast, to which they are attached, and from which they [theoretically] receive  
retribution. The Tathāgata’s knowledge exceeds these variations because  
he knows the very basis of their views but does not become attached to  
such a view. Since he is not attached to this view, he is in a state of qui-  
escence and cessation (i.e., free from conceptualization). He knows the  
causal concatenation of sensation and its cessation, its gratification and  
danger, and the method of transcending it. Thus he is liberated [from eter-  
nalist speculation] because of his nonattachment [to the basis of that view]  
through the very insight of seeing things universally as they really are.  
Therefore he is called the Tathāgata. This is the great insight, most profound  
and subtle and far more radiant. In reference to this insight, wise and  
saintly disciples can properly praise the Tathāgata for the universal insight  
that sees things as they really are.  
Again, there is another great insight, most profound and subtle and far  
more radiant, in reference to which wise and saintly disciples can properly  
praise the Tathāgata for the universal insight that sees things as they really  
are. What is this insight? Some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s speculate about  
the initial eon of the past and assert, “This world has arisen without a  
cause.” This view is confined to two variations. When they propose that  
“this world has arisen without a cause,” this theory is confined to two  
variations and does not exceed that number. But why should the theory  
that “the world has arisen without a cause” be confined to two variations  
without exceeding that number?  
Some sentient beings (here, “some gods,” _deva_ s) have no thought or  
knowledge. No sooner do they give rise to a thought than they come to  
the end of their life span. Once born in this human world, they gradually  
grow into adolescence, shave their hair and beards, don the three robes,

and renounce domestic life for religious practice. Some of them, entering
into mental concentration, recognize with a concentrated mind the origin
of their birth and say, “I did not exist originally but now I have suddenly
appeared. This world was nonexistent originally but now it exists. This
theory is true, while the rest is false.” This is the first variation. On the
basis of this view, other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s speculate about the
initial eon of the past and assert that the world exists without a cause. This
theory is identical with the other of the two variations.
Again, some śramaṇa s or brāhmaṇa s, with a rationally skeptical mind,
examine the case carefully and investigate the theory in various ways through
their knowledge of logic and sophistry. They assert, “This world exists with-
out cause. This theory alone is true while the rest is false.” This is the second
variation. On the basis of this theory, other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s propose
a theory concerning the initial eon of the past and assert, “This world exists
without cause.” This theory is identical with the other variation and does
not go beyond it. So while the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s thus formulate
their theory concerning the initial eon of the past, asserting that this world
exists without cause, the theory is limited to two variations and does not
exceed that number. Only the Tathāgata knows the very basis of the [com-
mon] view, and so on, just as has been repeatedly stated.
Other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s conjecture theories about the initial
eon of the past in innumerable and obsessive ways. But all the theories
thus asserted can be classified exhaustively into eighteen kinds of views.
Whatever these views may be, insofar as they are speculative concerning
the initial eon of the past, no matter how numerous and obsessively for-
mulated, they will invariably be classified into eighteen variations without
exceeding that number. Again, the Buddha alone knows the very basis of
those theories, and so on, just as has been repeatedly stated.
Again, there is another great insight, most profound and subtle and far
more radiant. What is this insight? While some śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s
form innumerable speculations about the final eon of the future, as freely
as they may wish, all the theories thus asserted can be classified exhaus-
tively into forty-four kinds of views. Whatever those views may be, insofar
as they are speculative concerning the final eon of the future, no matter how
numerous and obsessively theorized, they can all invariably be classified

into forty-four types of views without exceeding that number. Why should  
the theories of those _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s who speculate about the  
final eon of the future without limit be exhaustively classified into forty-  
four variations without exceeding that number?  
Some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s speculate in regard to the final eon of  
the future and form the theory that individual consciousness exists after  
death, thus asserting the existence of individual consciousness in the world  
after death. Any theory that asserts the existence of consciousness in the  
world after death falls into sixteen variations without exceeding that num-  
ber. Why should the theories of those _śramaṇa_ and _brāhmaṇa_ s who spec-  
ulate about the final eon of the future and assert that consciousness exists  
in the world after death be confined to sixteen variations without exceeding  
that number?  
Some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s speculatively form this view: “After  
my death a consciousness that has a form (i.e., a self with form and con-  
sciousness) will exist. This theory alone is true while the rest is false.”  
This is called the first view. Based on this view, other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāh-  
maṇa_ s who speculate in regard to the final eon of the future hold this  
theory of the existence of consciousness, asserting that consciousness will  
exist in the world after their death. This theory belongs to the sixteen vari-  
ations and does not range beyond them.  
Some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s assert, “After my death there will be  
a formless consciousness (i.e., a self without form but with consciousness).  
This alone is true while the rest is false.”  
Some other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s assert, “After my death there  
will be a consciousness with both form and formlessness (i.e., a self with  
consciousness and with both form and nonform). This alone is true while  
the rest is false.”  
Some other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s assert, “After my death there  
will be a consciousness that has neither form nor formlessness (i.e., a self  
with consciousness but with neither form nor nonform). This alone is true  
while the rest is false.”  
Some other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s assert, “After my death there  
will be a consciousness with a limit [or end] (i.e., a self having an end).  
This alone is true while the rest is false.”

Some other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s assert, “After my death there
will be a consciousness that has no limit (i.e., a self with no limit or end).
This alone is true while the rest is false.”
Some other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s assert, “After my death there
will be a consciousness that has both a limit and no limit (i.e., a self with
consciousness that also has both a limit and no limit). This alone is true
while the rest is false.”
Some other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s assert,“After my death there will
be a consciousness that has neither a limit nor no limit (i.e., a self with con-
sciousness that also has neither a limit nor no limit). This alone is true while
the rest is false.”
Some other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s assert, “After my death there
will be a consciousness that is one-sidedly happy (i.e., a self with a one-
sidedly happy consciousness). This alone is true while the rest is false.”
Some other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s assert, “After my death there
will be a consciousness that one-sidedly suffers (i.e., a self with a one-
sidedly suffering consciousness). This alone is true while the rest is false.”
Some other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s assert, “After my death there
will be a consciousness that both is happy and suffers (i.e., a self with a
consciousness that is happy and that suffers). This alone is true while the
rest is false.”
Some other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s assert, “After my death there
be a consciousness that neither is happy nor suffers (i.e., a self with a con-
sciousness that neither is happy nor suffers). This alone is true while the
rest is false.”
Some other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s assert, “After my death there
will be a singular consciousness ( yi xiang; ekatta-saṃjñī ātmā, i.e., a self
with a unified consciousness). This alone is true while the rest is false.”
Some other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s assert, “After my death, there
will be a multiple consciousness ( re gan xiang; nānatta-saṃjñī ātmā, i.e.,
a self with equivocal or multiple consciousness). This alone is true while
the rest is false.”
Some other śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s assert, “After my death there
will be a small consciousness ( shaoxiang; parītta-saṃjñin, i.e., a self
with a small separate consciousness).”

Some other _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s assert, “After my death there  
will be an immeasurable consciousness (i.e., a self with an immeasurable  
consciousness). This alone is true while the rest is false.”  
The foregoing groups of _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s all formulate theories  
in regard to the final eon of the future, asserting that there will be con-  
sciousness after death, but all their theories fall into sixteen variations  
without exceeding that number. Once again, only the Buddha knows the  
very basis of their theories, and so on, just as has been repeated before.  
Again, there is another great insight, most profound and subtle and far  
more radiant. What is this insight? Some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s for-  
mulate various theories in regard to the final eon of the future and assert  
that there will be no consciousness in the world after death. Any theories  
that speculate about the final eon of the future can be classified exhaustively  
into eight variations without exceeding that number. Why should the theories  
of those _śramaṇa_ and _brāhmaṇa_ s who speculate about the final eon of the  
future, asserting that there is no consciousness in the world after death, be  
confined to only eight variations? Why don’t they exceed that number?  
Some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s speculatively form this view: “After  
my death there will be no consciousness other than a form [of a self] (i.e.,  
a self with a form but no consciousness). This alone is true while the rest  
is false.”  
A second group of _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s asserts, “After my death  
there will be neither consciousness nor a form [of a self] (i.e., a self with  
no form and no consciousness). This alone is true while the rest is false.”  
A third group asserts, “After my death there will be no consciousness  
other than [a self] that has both form and formlessness ( _rūpī ca arūpī ca  
ātmā asaṃjñī,_ i.e, a self with form and nonform and no consciousness).  
This alone is true while the rest is false.”  
A fourth group asserts, “After my death there will be no consciousness  
other than a self that has neither form nor formlessness ( _n’eva rūpī nārūpī  
ca ātmā asaṃjñī,_ i.e., a self that does not have form, nonform, or con-  
sciousness). This alone is true while the rest is false.”  
A fifth group asserts, “After my death there will be no consciousness  
other than a self with a limit [or end] (i.e., a self that has an end or limit  
but no consciousness). This alone is true while the rest is false.”

A sixth group asserts, “After my death there will be no consciousness
[other than a self] with no limit or end (i.e, a self with no end or limit and
no consciousness). This alone is true while the rest is false.”
A seventh group asserts, “After my death there will be no consciousness
[other than a self] with both an end and no end (i.e., a self with both an
end and no end, and no consciousness). This alone is true while the rest
is false.”
An eighth group asserts, “After my death there will be no consciousness
[other than a self] with neither an end nor no end (i.e., a self with neither
an end nor no end, and no consciousness). This alone is true while the
rest is false.”
The foregoing are the eight variations of the theories with which śra-
maṇa s and brāhmaṇa s speculate in regard to the final eon of the future,
asserting that there will be no consciousness in the world after death. All
the theories fall into these eight variations and do not exceed that number.
Once again, only the Buddha knows the very basis of these theories, and
so on, just as has been repeated before.
Again, there is another great insight, most profound and subtle and far
more radiant. What is this insight? Some śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s spec-
ulate about the final eon of the future and frame a theory of “neither con-
sciousness nor nonconsciousness,” asserting that there will be neither
consciousness nor nonconsciousness in the world after death. These
theories too can be classified exhaustively into eight variations without
exceeding that number. On what basis can the speculative theories about
the final eon of the future be classified exhaustively into eight variations
without exceeding that number? On what basis can the theories of those
śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s who speculate in regard to the final eon of the
future, asserting that there is neither consciousness nor nonconsciousness
in the world after death, be confined to only eight variations? Why don’t
they exceed that number?
Some śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s speculatively form this view, “After
the end of my life there will be [a self] with neither consciousness nor
nonconsciousness (i.e., a self with a form but with neither consciousness
nor nonconsciousness). This alone is true while the rest is false.”

A second group of _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s asserts, “After my death  
there will be [a self] with no form and neither consciousness nor noncon-  
sciousness. This alone is true while the rest is false.”  
A third group asserts, “After my death, there will be [a self] with both  
a form and no form and with neither consciousness nor nonconsciousness.  
This alone is true while the rest is false.”  
A fourth group asserts, “After my death, there will be [a self] with nei-  
ther form nor no form and with neither consciousness nor nonconscious-  
ness. This alone is true while the rest is false.”  
A fifth group asserts, “After my death, there will be [a self] with an  
end (i.e., a limit) but with neither consciousness nor nonconsciousness.  
This alone is true while the rest is false.”  
A sixth group asserts, “After my death, there will be [a self] with no  
end (i.e., no limit) and with neither consciousness nor nonconsciousness.  
This alone is true while the rest is false.”  
A seventh group asserts, “After my death, there will be [a self] with  
both an end and no end and with neither consciousness nor nonconscious-  
ness. This alone is true while the rest is false.”  
An eighth group asserts, “After my death, there will be [a self] with  
neither an end nor no end and with neither consciousness nor non con-  
sciousness ( _n’eva antavā-anantavā ātmā n’eva saṃjñi-nāsaṃjñi_ ). This  
alone is true while the rest is false.”  
These are the eight variations of speculative theories held by _śramaṇa_ s  
and _brāhmaṇa_ s in regard to the final eon of the future, asserting that there  
will be neither consciousness nor nonconsciousness in the world after  
death. They all form eight variations and do not exceed that number. Once  
again, only the Buddha knows the very basis of these theories, and so on,  
just as has been stated repeatedly.  
Again, there is another great insight, most profound and subtle and far  
more radiant. What is this insight? Some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s speculate  
in regard to the final eon of the future and form a theory of annihilationism,  
asserting that living beings are completely destroyed after their deaths [or  
after the dissolution of their bodies], without remainder. This kind of theory  
can be classified into seven variations without exceeding that number. On

what basis can the theories of the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s who speculate
in regard to the final eon of the future, asserting that there is no self after
death, be classified into seven variations and not exceed that number?
Some śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s speculatively form this view, “My body
consists of four material principles and six cognitive faculties, and it was
born of my father and mother, reared initially by milk, and later sustained
by food and clothing and physically protected. The result, however, is subject
to change and will eventually be destroyed and obliterated. As it is like this,
it is called annihilation.” This is the first theory of annihilationism.
A second group of śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s asserts, “This may not be
total annihilation [of a sentient being]. Only when one reaches the heaven
in the realm of desire ( kāmadhātu ) is the body totally annihilated after death.”
A third group asserts, “This may not be total annihilation [of a sentient
being]. The body that takes shape in the realm of form ( rūpadhātu ) is
endowed with all cognitive faculties. Only when these faculties are
destroyed and obliterated after one’s death can the dissolution of faculties
be regarded as total annihilation.”
A fourth group asserts, “This may not be total annihilation [of a sentient
being]. Only when one reaches the formless realm ( arūpyadhātu ) of infinite
space can it be regarded as total annihilation.”
A fifth group asserts, “This may not be total annihilation [of a sentient
being]. Only when one reaches the formless realm of infinite consciousness
can it be regarded as total annihilation.”
A sixth group asserts, “This may not be total annihilation [of a sentient
being]. Only when one reaches the formless realm of nothingness can it
be regarded as total annihilation.”
A seventh group asserts, “This may not be total annihilation [of a sentient
being]. Only when one reaches the formless realm, namely, the realm of
neither thought nor nonthought, can it be regarded as total annihilation.”
These are the seven variations of the theories held by those śramaṇa s
and brāhmaṇa s who speculate in regard to the final eon of the future,
asserting that there is total destruction and obliteration of living beings
after their death. The theories all fall into seven variations and do not
exceed that number. Once again, only the Buddha knows the very basis
of these theories, and so on, as has been stated repeatedly.

Again, there is another great insight, most profound and subtle and far  
more radiant. What is this insight? Some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s who  
speculate about the final eon of the future assert a theory of nirvana and  
hold that living beings should acquire nirvana in their present lives. This  
kind of theory can be classified into five variations without exceeding that  
number. On what basis, however, do the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s who  
speculate about the final eon of the future assert that living beings should  
acquire nirvana in their present lives? How can this theory be classified  
into five variations and not exceed that number?  
Some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s speculatively form this view, “Since  
I am able to enjoy all five senses as freely as I wish, I regard this as the  
realization of nirvana in this present life.” This is the first variation.  
A second group of _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s asserts, “I think that this  
is the nirvana acquired in the present life and I cannot deny this subtle  
state. You may not understand this as I alone have experienced it. If you  
forsake all evil desires and all that is not good, even though there may be  
awareness of an object ( _you jia; vitarka_ ) and the act of examining ( _you  
guan; vicāra_ ), you will acquire the sense of joy ( _prīti_ ) and bliss ( _sukha_ )  
that removes the cause of birth. You will enter the first meditative state  
of absorption ( _dhyāna_ ). This may be regarded as nirvana acquired in the  
present life.” This is the second variation.  
A third group asserts, “I think that this is the nirvana acquired in the  
present life and I cannot deny this subtle state. You may not understand  
it as I alone have experienced it. If you eliminate awareness of an object  
and the subjective act of examination, with increasing tranquility or self-  
confidence (Pāli _saṃpasādana_ ) and continual application of mental con-  
centration, you will proceed to the second meditative state of absorption.  
According to my experience, this may be regarded as nirvana acquired  
in the present life.” This is the third variation.  
A fourth group asserts, “I think that this is the nirvana acquired in the  
present life and I cannot deny this state of subtlety. You may not understand  
it as I alone have experienced it. If you eliminate defiled affectations and  
forsake the feeling of delight while remaining mindful of the blissful state  
and experience it in the body, which the wise and saintly disciples commend,  
you will then enter the third meditative state of absorption. According to

my experience, this may be regarded as nirvana acquired in the present
life.” This is the fourth variation.
A fifth group asserts, “I think that this is the nirvana acquired in this
present life and I cannot deny this subtle state. You may not understand
it as I alone have experienced it. If you eradicate feelings of happiness
and suffering and remove sorrow and joy, as I have done, you will realize
the state of equanimity in which neither suffering nor pleasure is experi-
enced, and thus enter the fourth meditative state of absorption, which is
primary nirvana.” This is the fifth variation.
When śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s speculate in regard to the final eon
of the future and assert these views of nirvana that may be acquired in
the present life, their theories can be classified into five variations without
exceeding that number. Once again, only the Buddha knows the very basis
of these theories, and so on, just as has been stated repeatedly.
Some śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s obsessively assert innumerable spec-
ulative views about the final eon of the future, but the various theories
they advance about the final eon of the future can invariably be classified
into forty-four variations without exceeding that number. Once again,
only the Buddha knows the very basis of these theories, and so on, just
as has been stated repeatedly.
Some śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s obsessively assert innumerable views
about the initial eon of the past and the final eon of the future, but the var-
ious theories they advance about the initial eon of the past and the final
eon of the future can be classified exhaustively into sixty-two variations
without exceeding that number. Once again, only the Buddha knows the
very basis of these theories, and so on, just as has been stated repeatedly.
Some śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, speculating about the initial eon of
the past, assert a theory of eternalism and hold that the self and the world
are permanent. On the basis of this theory, these śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s
acquire knowledge, namely, heretical notions of belief, desire, learning,
[causal] conditions, sensation, view, concentration, and acknowledgment.
They then acquire knowledge from these [heretical notions], namely, the
notion of sensation and so on, up to the notion of nirvana as well.
Some śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s, speculating about the initial eon of
the past, assert a theory of eternalism and hold that the self and the world

are permanent. Since these theories are invariably occasioned by the  
contact of the senses [with their respective objects], it is impossible to  
advance any of these theories apart from the fact of sense contact. This  
holds true even with the theory of nirvana acquired in the present life.  
Some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s assert innumerable views about the  
initial eon of the past and the final eon of the future. Whatever theories  
they advance concerning the initial eon of the past and the final eon of  
the future are invariably accomplished within these sixty-two variations.  
Therefore, whatever speculative view one may assert as a theory is confined  
to these sixty-two variations [and can never be accomplished outside these  
variations]. This state of affairs can be compared to the situation of a skillful  
fisherman who casts a fine-meshed net over a small pond and covers it  
entirely. It should be understood that whatever creatures exist within that  
small pond will invariably be trapped in the net and cannot escape from it;  
they are all contained within it and cannot go beyond it. The _śramaṇa_ s and  
_brāhmaṇa_ s are also like this. All the various speculative theories they hold  
concerning the initial eon of the past and the final eon of the future are  
invariably confined within the fine-meshed net of these sixty-two variations  
and may equal but never go beyond them.  
If a _bhikṣu_ acquires insight into the causal concatenation of the six  
senses and contact with their objects (i.e., sensation, its cessation, its grat-  
ification, its danger, and the method of its transcendence), universally as  
they really are, this would be his highest achievement, [precisely] because  
this insight goes beyond the theories contained within the sixty-two vari-  
ations. The Tathāgata has directly experienced in the present life that the  
cause of birth and death has been exhausted. The only reason he continues  
to appear in this world is because of his [resolution] to help gods and  
humans realize the goal of nirvana. Without this [great] resolution, there  
would be no one in this world on whom gods and humans can rely as their  
refuge. Such a state of affairs can be compared to the _tāla_ tree: if the top  
is chopped off, the tree never revives. In case of the Buddha, too, because  
he has already terminated the cause of life and birth, once he enters nirvana  
he will never again return to this world.  
The time this discourse was completed must have been the right time for  
the Buddha, because the entire earth quaked three times in six different ways.

At that moment Ānanda was standing behind the Buddha, fanning him.  
He rearranged his outer robe to expose his right shoulder and, kneeling with  
his palms joined, he said to the Buddha, “The foregoing discourse is very  
profound, sir. What title should be given to this discourse? And how can this  
discourse be sustained and carried out, sir?”  
The Buddha said to Ānanda, “This sutra should be called the net of mean-  
ings, the net of insights, the net of views, the net of catching evil ones, and  
the net of Brahmā.”  
At that, having heard the Buddha’s teaching, Ānanda was delighted to  
receive it, and he reverentially carried out what the Buddha taught.
