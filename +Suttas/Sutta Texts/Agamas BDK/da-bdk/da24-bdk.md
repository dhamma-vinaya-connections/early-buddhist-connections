### Kevaddha

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 11: Kevaṭṭa Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. Once, when the Buddha sojourned in the Pāvārikamba forest  
near the town of Nālandā, accompanied by one thousand two hundred and fifty  
_bhikṣu_ s, a son of a wealthy family, who was called Kevaddha, visited the  
Buddha’s resting place. After bowing his head at the Buddha’s feet he took a  
seat to one side. Then Kevaddha, the son of a wealthy family, said to the Buddha:

Very good, sir. O World-honored One, I beseech Your Reverence to com-
mand the venerable bhikṣu s to manifest their superhuman faculties and
demonstrate their supernormal powers before the brāhmaṇa s and sons of
wealthy families and householders who have come to visit you.
The Buddha replied:
[O Kevaddha,] I do not give my disciples any superhuman faculties or
supernormal powers so that they can demonstrate them before brāhmaṇa s,
sons [or daughters] of wealthy families, or householders. I only teach
them how to contemplate the path in seclusion, and if they make progress
[in the path], to keep it to themselves, and if they should transgress while
on the path, to explicitly acknowledge it [in public].
Kevaddha, son of the wealthy man Changxiao, again said to the Buddha:
O World-honored One, I beseech Your Reverence to command the ven-
erable bhikṣu s to manifest their superhuman faculties and demonstrate
their supernormal powers before the brāhmaṇa s, the sons [and daughters]
of wealthy families, and householders who have come to visit you, sir.
The Buddha again replied:
[O Kevaddha,] I do not give my disciples any superhuman faculties or
supernormal powers so that they can demonstrate them before brāhmaṇa s,

the sons [and daughters] of wealthy families, or householders. I only teach
them how to contemplate the path in seclusion, and if they make progress
[in the path], to keep it to themselves, and if they should transgress while
on the path, to explicitly acknowledge it [in public].
Kevaddha, son of the wealthy man Changxiao, said to the Buddha:
I have no doubt whatsoever about the superhuman faculties [that have been
attributed to Your Reverence and the venerable bhikṣu s], sir. However, in
this town of Nālandā, which is prosperous and whose populace is large, I
thought it would be beneficial to show your supernormal powers to the peo-
ple, since the propagation of the Dharma can be accomplished [far more
quickly] when such demonstrations convince the people to convert, sir.
The Buddha again replied:
I do not give my disciples any superhuman faculties or supernormal powers
so that they can demonstrate them before brāhmaṇa s, the sons [and daugh-
ters] of wealthy families, or householders. I only teach them how to con-
template the path in seclusion, and if they make progress [in the path], to
keep it to themselves, and if they transgress while on the path, to explicitly
acknowledge it [in public].
Why? Because there are three kinds of supernormal power ( prātihārya ):
namely, (1) magical performance ( ṛddhi-pāda-prātihārya ), (2) reading
others’ minds while preaching ( ādeśanā-prātihārya ), and (3) the miracle
of teaching ( anuśāsanī-prātihārya , destroying the vices of the admonished).
What is magical performance? O son of the wealthy, some bhikṣu s
acquire this supernormal power in order [to change their physical form
into other forms]. From their one body, they can generate multiple identical
bodies or collapse the many back to one. They can [instantaneously] cross
rivers and hills as freely as they wish, be it near or far, and go through
walls and rocks without obstruction, just like flying through the air. They
can leap up and fold their legs to sit in the lotus posture in midair, like a
flying bird. They can disappear into the ground or reappear out of it, as
if it were the surface of water. They can walk on water as if walking on
the ground, or emit fiery flames from their body like a huge bonfire, or

grasp the sun and moon by the hand and reach to the height of Brahmā  
Heaven. To wealthy people or householders endowed with devotion and  
good faith, such a _bhikṣu_ could demonstrate the innumerable kinds of  
supernormal power even to the point of reaching up to Brahmā Heaven.  
He could influence a devotee to say to another householder, a nonbeliever,  
“I have seen a _bhikṣu_ demonstrate his supernormal power even to the  
point of reaching up to Brahmā Heaven.” The nonbeliever, however, could  
reply, “I have heard of a Gāndhārī magic that enables a person, as you  
have witnessed, to show off innumerable magical transformations, even  
to the point of reaching up to Brahmā Heaven.”  
The Buddha continued, “Don’t you find the words of the nonbeliever to  
be derogatory in nature?”  
Kevaddha replied, “Yes, I do indeed regard his words as derogatory, sir.”  
The Buddha said:  
For this very reason, I have not permitted the _bhikṣu_ s to reveal supernormal  
capacities to anyone. I only teach them how to contemplate the path in  
seclusion, and if they make progress [in the path], to keep it to themselves,  
and if they should transgress on the path, to explicitly acknowledge it [in  
public]. This is how it has been.  
O son of a wealthy family, their [compliance with my teaching] is itself  
a manifestation of their supernormal power.  
What is the second supernormal power, that of reading others’ minds  
while preaching ( _ādeśanā-ṛddhipāda_ )? Through this power, _bhikṣu_ s can  
manifest innumerable ways to read the mind of others. They can know the  
entire content of their thoughts, even their hidden, undisclosed deeds, with-  
out exception. To wealthy people or householders endowed with devotion  
and good faith, such a _bhikṣu_ could offer to demonstrate the innumerable  
kinds of supernormal power by reading the minds of others. He could thus  
influence a devotee to say to another householder, a nonbeliever, “I have  
seen a _bhikṣu_ demonstrate his supernormal power by reading the minds  
of others.” The nonbeliever, however, could reply, “I have heard of a Gān -  
dhārī magic that enables a person, as you have witnessed, to exhibit super-  
normal power by reading the minds of others, so that everything, even hid-  
den, undisclosed deeds, is known without exception.”

What do you think, O son of a wealthy family? Don’t you find these
words to be derogatory in nature?
Kevaddha replied, “Yes, I do indeed regard those words as derogatory, sir.”
The Buddha said:
For this very reason, I have not permitted the bhikṣu s to reveal supernormal
capacities to anyone. I only teach them how to contemplate the path in
seclusion, and if they make progress [in the path], to keep it to themselves,
and if they should transgress while on the path, to explicitly acknowledge
it [in public]. This is how it has been. O son of the wealthy, their [compliance
with my teaching] is itself a manifestation of their supernormal power.
What is the miracle of teaching? O son of a wealthy family, suppose
that a Buddha who is recognized with the ten supreme titles, such as One
Perfected in Practice, One Liberated from Attachment, Perfectly Enlight-
ened One, and so on, should appear in this world, and that among all the
gods and humans, and all the evil ones and their lord, and the śramaṇa s
and brāhmaṇa s too, he alone has directly experienced the realization of
enlightenment and has been teaching others [how to realize that goal].
When he expounds on religion, his words should be good in the beginning,
good in the middle, and also good in the end. All the words he utters
should invariably be endowed with true meanings and real essences, and
in accord with his practice of pure and genuine austerity. If anyone, whether
a wealthy person or a householder, is inspired to hold a serene conviction
in the Buddha’s words after listening to this teaching, and having acquired
that conviction, looks to the substance of his life and thinks, “I should not
remain a householder. If I continue in domestic life, I will always have
to deny my convictions and will never take up the practice of pure and
genuine austerity—no, I would rather shave my head, moustache, and
beard, put on the three robes of a mendicant, and leave the householder’s
life to follow the discipline of the path. I will strive to attain all the mer-
itorious virtues, even up to realizing the three supernormal powers, so
that the state of darkness and ignorance can be annihilated to produce the
great wisdom and illumination. Why? Because this final realization can
only be achieved through the mindfulness and concentration found in diligent
endeavor, practice in seclusion, and freedom from worldly mentality”—if

one should think in this way, O son of a wealthy family, that is the miracle  
of teaching as manifested by the _bhikṣu_ s.  
Thereupon, Kevaddha, the son of a wealthy family, said to the Buddha,  
“Sir, supposing that is the case, is every _bhikṣu_ endowed with these three  
supernormal powers?”  
The Buddha replied:  
I did not say that I have many _bhikṣu_ s and some of them have acquired  
the three supernormal powers, O son of a wealthy family. Among the  
members of the sangha there are some _bhikṣu_ s who think to themselves,  
“How can the four material elements, namely, earth, water, wind, and fire,  
be brought to cessation?” One of the _bhikṣu_ s immediately set out for  
heaven, and at the abode of the four guardian princes asked them the same  
question, “How can the four material elements, namely, earth, water, wind,  
and fire, be brought to cessation?” O son of a wealthy family, the four  
guardian princes replied, “We do not know how the four material elements  
can be brought to cessation. There is another heaven above us, called  
Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, whose resident gods are known for their subtle  
intelligence and great wisdom. [We are certain] they would know how  
the four material elements can be brought to cessation.”  
After receiving this answer, the _bhikṣu_ once again set off toward a  
higher heaven. Upon reaching Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, he asked the resident  
gods, “How can the four material elements of this body be brought to ces-  
sation?” The Trāyastriṃśa gods replied, “I do not know how the four  
material elements can be brought to cessation. There is another heaven  
above us, called Yama Heaven, where the resident gods are known to have  
subtle intelligence and great wisdom. [We are certain] they would know  
how the four material elements can be brought to cessation.”  
At once, the _bhikṣu_ went up higher [to Yama Heaven] and asked the  
same question, only to receive the same reply: they did not know. In this  
manner, he continued to travel upward, questioning the gods of Tuṣita  
Heaven, Nirmāṇarati Heaven, and Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven. All of  
them made the same reply, including the last, “We do not know how the  
four material elements can be brought to cessation. There is another heaven  
above us, called Brahmakāyika Heaven, whose resident gods are known

to have subtle intelligence and great wisdom. They are called the Brah-
makāyika gods, and [we are certain] they would know how the four mate-
rial elements can be brought to [total] cessation once for all.”
The bhikṣu promptly set off again to reach Brahmā Heaven, and upon
his arrival he asked the same question to the residents of that heaven,
“How can the four material elements, namely, earth, water, wind, and fire,
be brought to total cessation?” The resident gods replied, “We do not
know how the four material elements can be brought to cessation. But
the great Brahmā, who rules a thousand worlds and has no equal, who is
honorable, heroic, rich, and noble and has absolute freedom as the creator
of all things and the one ancestor of all sentient beings, [certainly] must
know how the four material elements can be brought to total cessation.”
So the bhikṣu asked, “Where is the great lord Brahmā?” And the resident
gods of Brahmā’s realm replied, “We do not know where he is right now.
We expect that he will appear before too long.”
In a moment, the great lord Brahmā suddenly appeared. O son of a
wealthy family, the bhikṣu approached Brahmā and asked the same ques-
tion, “Sir, how can the four material elements of this body, namely, earth,
water, wind, and fire, be brought to total cessation?”
Lord Brahmā replied, “I am Lord Brahmā, whom no one can surpass.
I rule a thousand worlds as the honorable, heroic, rich, and noble creator
of all things, who is endowed with absolute freedom and is the one ancestor
of all sentient beings.”
The bhikṣu said to Lord Brahmā, “That was not the answer to my ques-
tion, sir. I asked, ‘How can the four material elements, namely, earth,
water, wind, and fire, be brought to total cessation?’”
O son of a wealthy family, Lord Brahmā once again made the same
reply, “I am Lord Brahmā, whom no one can surpass. I rule a thousand
worlds as the honorable, heroic, rich, and noble creator of all things, who
is endowed with absolute freedom and is the one ancestor of all sentient
beings.”
The bhikṣu said again, “That was not the answer to my question, sir.
What I asked was, ‘How can the four material elements, namely, earth,
water, wind, and fire, be brought to total cessation?’”

O son of a wealthy family, even on the third exchange, Lord Brahmā  
could not tell the _bhikṣu_ how the four material elements could be brought  
to total cessation.  
The great lord Brahmā then took the _bhikṣu_ by his right hand and led  
him to a secluded place, where he said, “O _bhikṣu_ , since the residents of  
this Brahmā Heaven all say in unison that I have supreme wisdom and  
there is nothing I do not know, I cannot tell you in public that I do not  
know how the four material elements can be brought to total cessation,  
nor can I say in public that I cannot tell you that.”  
Again, he continued, “You are foolish to have left the Tathāgata behind  
while coming to pose this question to the heavenly gods. You should return  
to the Tathāgata and ask him your question. Whatever the Buddha may  
say in reply you must keep it in mind.  
Again, he went on, “The Buddha is now at rest in Anāthapiṇḍika  
Monastery in Prince Jeta’s Grove near the city of Śrāvastī. You should go  
there and ask him your question.”  
O son of a wealthy family, that _bhikṣu_ immediately disappeared from  
Brahmā Heaven and in an instant, as swiftly as a wrestler can bend his  
arm and straighten it, returned to Anāthapiṇḍika Monastery in Prince  
Jeta’s Grove near the city of Śrāvastī. He came to me, and after bowing  
his head to my feet, he took a seat to one side and asked, “O World-honored  
One, how can those four material elements, namely, earth, water, wind,  
and fire, be brought to total cessation?”  
I replied, “O _bhikṣu_ , you have acted like a merchant who carries a  
falcon perched on his elbow and to practice falconry he takesa boat out  
to sea and releases it from the middle of the ocean. When the bird is  
released it will fly to the east, west, north, and south, and once it finds  
land it will stop; if there is no land, it will return to the boat. O _bhikṣu_ ,  
you are just like that—you went higher and higher to pose an inquiry to  
Brahmā, yet you were unable to obtain the right answer and now you have  
come back to me. I shall let you come to rest with your question.”  
I then composed a verse for the _bhikṣu_ :  
How can the four material elements,  
Earth, water, wind, and fire, be brought to total cessation?

How can anything that is neither rough nor fine,  
Neither long nor short, neither beautiful nor ugly,  
Be brought to total cessation?  
How can anything that is neither sentient nor material  
Be brought to total cessation, without remainder?  
The answer should be given:  
Consciousness has no form and is immeasurable and self-luminous.  
When consciousness ceases to be,  
The four material elements also cease, and  
So do rough and fine, beautiful and ugly, equally cease to be.  
Here both sentient principle and material elements cease to be.  
When consciousness ceases to be, the rest also ceases to be.  
Kevaddha, the son of a wealthy family, said to the Buddha, “O World-  
honored One, what is that _bhikṣu_ ’s name? Under what title should I keep this  
sutra, sir?”  
The Buddha replied, “That _bhikṣu_ is called Ashiyi, and under that name  
you should keep this sutra in mind.”  
Then, having heard the Buddha’s teaching, Kevaddha, the son of a wealthy  
family, was delighted to receive it, and he reverentially carried out what the  
Buddha taught.
