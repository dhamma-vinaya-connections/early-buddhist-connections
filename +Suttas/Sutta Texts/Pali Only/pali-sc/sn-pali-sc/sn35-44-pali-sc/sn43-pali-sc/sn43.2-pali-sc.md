## 43. Asaṅkhatasaṁyutta: On the Unconditioned

### I. The First Chapter — SN43.2: Serenity and Discernment
#### B. Sujato


1“Mendicants, I will teach you the unconditioned and the path that leads to the unconditioned. Listen …

And what is the unconditioned? The ending of greed, hate, and delusion. This is called the unconditioned.

And what is the path that leads to the unconditioned? Serenity and discernment. This is called the path that leads to the unconditioned. …”

1"Asaṅkhatañca vo, bhikkhave, desessāmi asaṅkhatagāmiñca maggaṁ. Taṁ suṇātha.

Katamañca, bhikkhave, asaṅkhataṁ? Yo, bhikkhave, rāgakkhayo dosakkhayo mohakkhayo – idaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, asaṅkhataṁ.

Katamo ca, bhikkhave, asaṅkhatagāmimaggo? Samatho ca vipassanā ca. Ayaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, asaṅkhatagāmimaggo … pe … .

Dutiyaṁ.
