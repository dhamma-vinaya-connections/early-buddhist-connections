### VII. Leading to Awakening — SN48.69: A Tree (3rd)
#### B. Sujato


1“Mendicants, of all the trees belonging to the demons, the trumpet-flower tree is said to be the best. In the same way, the faculty of wisdom is said to be the best of the qualities that lead to awakening in terms of becoming awakened. And what are the qualities that lead to awakening? The faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom are qualities that lead to awakening, in that they lead to becoming awakened. Of all the trees belonging to the demons, the trumpet-flower tree is said to be the best. In the same way, the faculty of wisdom is said to be the best of the qualities that lead to awakening in terms of becoming awakened.”

1"Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, ye keci asurānaṁ rukkhā, cittapāṭali tesaṁ aggamakkhāyati; evameva kho, bhikkhave, ye keci bodhipakkhiyā dhammā, paññindriyaṁ tesaṁ aggamakkhāyati, yadidaṁ – bodhāya. Katame ca, bhikkhave, bodhipakkhiyā dhammā? Saddhindriyaṁ, bhikkhave, bodhipakkhiyo dhammo, taṁ bodhāya saṁvattati … pe … paññindriyaṁ bodhipakkhiyo dhammo, taṁ bodhāya saṁvattati. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, ye keci asurānaṁ rukkhā, cittapāṭali tesaṁ aggamakkhāyati; evameva kho, bhikkhave, ye keci bodhipakkhiyā dhammā, paññindriyaṁ tesaṁ aggamakkhāyati, yadidaṁ – bodhāyā"ti.

Navamaṁ.
