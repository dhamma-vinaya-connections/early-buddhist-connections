## 46. Bojjhaṅgasaṁyutta: On the Awakening Factors

### XVIII. Another Chapter on Floods — SN46.175-184: Another Chapter on Floods
#### B. Sujato


To be expanded as in SN45.171-180.

All should be expanded as in the chapter on removal of greed, hate, and delusion.

The Linked Discourses on Awakening Factors should be expanded just as the Linked Discourses on the Path.
