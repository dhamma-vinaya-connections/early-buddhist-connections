# AN2.64

> **Division:** VII. HAPPINESS

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of happiness. What two? The happiness of a layperson and the happiness of one who has gone forth \[into homelessness\]. These are the two kinds of happiness. Of these two kinds of happiness, the happiness of one who has gone forth is foremost.”
