# AN2.135

> **Division:** XII. ASPIRING

“Bhikkhus, possessing two qualities, the foolish, incompetent, bad person maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition; he is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise; and he generates much demerit. What two? Without investigating and scrutinizing, he believes a matter that merits suspicion. Without investigating and scrutinizing, he is suspicious about a matter that merits belief. Possessing these two qualities, the foolish, incompetent, bad person maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition; he is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise; and he generates much demerit. \[90\]
