# AN2.16

> **Division:** II. DISCIPLINARY ISSUES

Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: “Why is it, Master Gotama, that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell?”

“It is, brahmin, because of conduct contrary to the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct, that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.”

“But why is it, Master Gotama, that some beings here with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world?”

“It is, brahmin, because of conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct, \[56\] that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.”

“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms. I now go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”
