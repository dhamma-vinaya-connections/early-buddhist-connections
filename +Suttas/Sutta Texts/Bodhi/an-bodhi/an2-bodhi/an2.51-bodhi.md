# AN2.51

> **Division:** V. ASSEMBLIES

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of assemblies. What two? The assembly that speaks non-Dhamma and the assembly that speaks Dhamma.

“And what is the assembly that speaks non-Dhamma? Here, in this kind of assembly the bhikkhus take up a disciplinary issue, one that may accord with the Dhamma or be contrary to the Dhamma. Having taken up the issue, they do not persuade one another and do not allow themselves to be persuaded; they do not deliberate and do not welcome deliberation. Lacking the power of persuasion and the power of deliberation, \[76\] unwilling to relinquish their opinion, they wrongly grasp that disciplinary issue even more tightly, and adhering to their position, they declare: ‘This alone is true; anything else is wrong.’ This is called the assembly that speaks non-Dhamma.

“And what is the assembly that speaks Dhamma? Here, in this kind of assembly the bhikkhus take up a disciplinary issue, one that may accord with the Dhamma or be contrary to the Dhamma. Having taken up the issue, they persuade one another and allow themselves to be persuaded; they deliberate and welcome deliberation. Possessing the power of persuasion and the power of deliberation, willing to relinquish their opinion, they do not wrongly grasp that disciplinary issue even more tightly, nor, adhering to their position, do they declare: ‘This alone is true; anything else is wrong.’ This is called the assembly that speaks Dhamma.

“These, bhikkhus, are the two kinds of assemblies. Of these two kinds of assemblies, the assembly that speaks Dhamma is foremost.”
