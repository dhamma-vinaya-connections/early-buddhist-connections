# AN2.42

> **Division:** V. ASSEMBLIES

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of assemblies. What two? The shallow assembly and the deep assembly.

“And what is the shallow assembly? The assembly in which the bhikkhus are restless, puffed up, vain, talkative, rambling in their talk, with muddled mindfulness, lacking in clear comprehension, unconcentrated, with wandering minds, with loose sense faculties, is called the shallow assembly.

“And what is the deep assembly? The assembly in which the bhikkhus are not restless, puffed up, vain, talkative, and rambling in their talk but have established mindfulness, clearly comprehend, are concentrated, with one-pointed minds and restrained sense faculties, is called the deep assembly.

“These, bhikkhus, are the two kinds of assemblies. Of these two kinds of assemblies, the deep assembly is foremost.”
