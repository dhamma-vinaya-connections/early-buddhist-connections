# AN2.62

> **Division:** VI. PEOPLE

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you about co-residency among the bad and about co-residency among the good. Listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“And how is there co-residency among the bad, and how do the bad live together? Here, it occurs to an elder bhikkhu: ‘An elder \[bhikkhu\]—or one of middle standing or a junior \[bhikkhu\]—should not correct me. I should not correct an elder \[bhikkhu\], or one of middle standing or a junior \[bhikkhu\]. If an elder \[bhikkhu\] corrects me, he might do so without sympathy, not sympathetically. I would then say “No!” to him and would trouble him, and even seeing \[my offense\] I would not make amends for it. If \[a bhikkhu\] of middle standing corrects me … If a junior \[bhikkhu\] corrects me, he might do so without sympathy, not sympathetically. I would then say “No!” to him and would trouble him, and even seeing \[my offense\] I would not make amends for it.’

“It occurs, too, to \[a bhikkhu\] of middle standing … to a junior \[bhikkhu\]: ‘An elder \[bhikkhu\]—or one of middle standing or a junior \[bhikkhu\]—should not correct me. I should not correct an elder \[bhikkhu\] … \[79\] … and even seeing \[my offense\] I would not make amends for it.’ It is in this way that there is co-residency among the bad, and it is in this way that the bad live together.

“And how, bhikkhus, is there co-residency among the good, and how do the good live together? Here, it occurs to an elder bhikkhu: ‘An elder \[bhikkhu\]—and one of middle standing and a junior \[bhikkhu\]—should correct me. I should correct an elder \[bhikkhu\], one of middle standing, and a junior \[bhikkhu\]. If an elder \[bhikkhu\] corrects me, he might do so sympathetically, not without sympathy. I would then say “Good!” to him and would not trouble him, and seeing \[my offense\] I would make amends for it. If \[a bhikkhu\] of middle standing speaks to me … If a junior \[bhikkhu\] corrects me, he might do so sympathetically, not without sympathy, I would then say “Good!” to him and would not trouble him, and seeing \[my offense\] I would make amends for it.’

“It occurs, too, to \[a bhikkhu\] of middle standing … to a junior \[bhikkhu\]: ‘An elder \[bhikkhu\]—and one of middle standing and a junior \[bhikkhu\]—should correct me. I should correct an elder \[bhikkhu\] … and seeing \[my offense\] I would make amends for it.’ It is in this way that there is co-residency among the good, and it is in this way that the good live together.”
