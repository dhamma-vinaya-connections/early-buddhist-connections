# AN2.2 Striving

> **Division:** I. ENTERING UPON THE RAINS

“Bhikkhus, there are these two strivings that are hard to achieve in the world. What two? The striving of laypeople who dwell at home for the purpose of presenting \[monastics with\] robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick, and the striving of those who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness for the relinquishment of all acquisitions. These are the two strivings that are hard to achieve in the world.

“Of these two strivings, bhikkhus, the foremost is the striving for the relinquishment of all acquisitions. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will strive for the relinquishment of all acquisitions.’ It is in such a way that you should train yourselves.”
