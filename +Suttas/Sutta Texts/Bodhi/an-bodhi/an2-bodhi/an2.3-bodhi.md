# AN2.3 Causing Torment

> **Division:** I. ENTERING UPON THE RAINS

“Bhikkhus, there are these two things that cause torment. What two? Here, someone has engaged in bodily misconduct but failed to engage in bodily good conduct; engaged in verbal misconduct but failed to engage in verbal good conduct; engaged in mental misconduct but failed to engage in mental good conduct. He is tormented, \[thinking\]: ‘I have engaged in bodily misconduct’; he is tormented, \[thinking\]: ‘I have failed to engage in bodily good conduct’; he is tormented, \[thinking\]: ‘I have engaged in verbal misconduct’; he is tormented, \[thinking\]: ‘I have failed to engage in verbal good conduct’; he is tormented, \[thinking\]: ‘I have engaged in mental misconduct’; he is tormented, \[thinking\]: ‘I have failed to engage in mental good conduct.’ These, bhikkhus, are the two things that cause torment.”
