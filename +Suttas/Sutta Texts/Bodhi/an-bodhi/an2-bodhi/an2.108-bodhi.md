> **Division:** X. FOOLS

“Bhikkhus, the taints increase for two \[kinds of persons\]. What two? One who feels remorse about a matter over which one need not feel remorse and one who does not feel remorse about a matter over which one should feel remorse. The taints increase for these two \[kinds of persons\].”
