# AN2.49

> **Division:** V. ASSEMBLIES

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of assemblies. What two? The unrighteous assembly and the righteous assembly.

“And what is the unrighteous assembly? Here, in this assembly disciplinary acts contrary to the Dhamma are enacted and disciplinary acts in accordance with the Dhamma are not enacted; disciplinary acts contrary to the discipline are enacted and disciplinary acts in accordance with the discipline are not enacted. Disciplinary acts contrary to the Dhamma are explained and disciplinary acts in accordance with the Dhamma are not explained; disciplinary acts contrary to the discipline are explained and disciplinary acts in accordance with the discipline are not explained. This, bhikkhus, is called the unrighteous assembly. It is because it is unrighteous that in this assembly disciplinary acts contrary to the Dhamma are enacted … \[75\] … and disciplinary acts in accordance with the discipline are not explained.

“And what is the righteous assembly? Here, in this assembly disciplinary acts that accord with the Dhamma are enacted and disciplinary acts contrary to the Dhamma are not enacted; disciplinary acts that accord with the discipline are enacted and disciplinary acts contrary to the discipline are not enacted. Disciplinary acts that accord with the Dhamma are explained and disciplinary acts contrary to the Dhamma are not explained; disciplinary acts that accord with the discipline are explained and disciplinary acts contrary to the discipline are not explained. This, bhikkhus, is called the righteous assembly. It is because it is righteous that in this assembly disciplinary acts that accord with the Dhamma are enacted … and disciplinary acts contrary to the discipline are not explained.

“These, bhikkhus, are the two kinds of assemblies. Of these two kinds of assemblies, the righteous assembly is foremost.”
