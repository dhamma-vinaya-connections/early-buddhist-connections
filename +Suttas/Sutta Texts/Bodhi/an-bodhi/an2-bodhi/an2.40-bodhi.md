# AN2.40

> **Division:** IV. SAME-MINDED

“Bhikkhus, I do not praise the wrong practice of two \[kinds of people\]: a layperson and one gone forth \[into homelessness\]. Whether it is a layperson or one gone forth who is practicing wrongly, because of wrong practice, they do not attain the true way, the Dhamma that is wholesome.
