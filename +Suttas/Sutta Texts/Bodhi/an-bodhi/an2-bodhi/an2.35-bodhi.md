# AN2.35

> **Division:** IV. SAME-MINDED

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One, \[63\] paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

“Who in the world, Bhante, is worthy of offerings, and where is a gift to be given?”

“There are, householder, two in the world worthy of offerings: the trainee and the one beyond training. These are the two in the world worthy of offerings and a gift is to be given to them.”

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

     “In this world the trainee and one beyond training

     are worthy of the gifts of those practicing charity;

     upright in body, speech, and mind,

     they are the field for those practicing charity;

     what is given to them brings great fruit.”
