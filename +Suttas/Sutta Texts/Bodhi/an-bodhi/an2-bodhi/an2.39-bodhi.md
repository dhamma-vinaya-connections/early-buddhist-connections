# AN2.39

> **Division:** IV. SAME-MINDED

“Bhikkhus, when robbers are strong, kings are weak. At that time the king is not at ease when re-entering \[his capital\], or when going out, or when touring the outlying provinces. At that time brahmins and householders, too, are not at ease when re-entering \[their towns and villages\], or when going out, or when attending to work outside.

“So too, when evil bhikkhus are strong, well-behaved bhikkhus are weak. At that time the well-behaved bhikkhus sit silently in the midst of the Saṅgha or they resort to the outlying provinces. This is for the harm of many people, for the unhappiness of many people, for the ruin, harm, and suffering of many people, of devas and human beings. \[69\]

“So too, when well-behaved bhikkhus are strong, evil bhikkhus are weak. At that time the evil bhikkhus sit silently in the midst of the Saṅgha or they depart for other regions. This is for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, of devas and human beings.”
