# AN2.46

> **Division:** V. ASSEMBLIES

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of assemblies. What two? The dregs of an assembly and the cream of an assembly.

“And what is the dregs of an assembly? The assembly in which the bhikkhus enter upon a wrong course on account of desire, hatred, delusion, or fear is called the dregs of an assembly.

“And what is the cream of an assembly? The assembly in which the bhikkhus do not enter upon a wrong course on account of desire, hatred, delusion, or fear is called the cream of an assembly.

“These, bhikkhus, are the two kinds of assemblies. Of these two kinds of assemblies, the cream of an assembly is foremost.”
