# AN2.9 Behavior

> **Division:** I. ENTERING UPON THE RAINS

“Bhikkhus, these two bright qualities protect the world. What two? Moral shame and moral dread. If these two bright qualities did not protect the world, there would not be seen here \[any restraint regarding\] one’s mother, aunts, or the wives of one’s teachers and \[other\] respected people. The world would become promiscuous, like goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, dogs and jackals. But because these two bright qualities protect the world, there is seen here \[restraint regarding\] one’s mother, aunts, or the wives of one’s teachers and \[other\] respected people.”
