# AN2.280-309

> **Division:** XVIII. DISCIPLINE REPETITION SERIES

“Bhikkhus, it is for these two reasons that the Tathāgata has prescribed the training rules for his disciples. What two? For the well-being of the Saṅgha and for the ease of the Saṅgha … For keeping recalcitrant persons in check and so that well-behaved bhikkhus can dwell at ease … For the restraint of taints pertaining to this present life and for the dispelling of taints pertaining to future lives … For the restraint of enmities pertaining to this present life and for the dispelling of enmities pertaining to future lives … For the restraint of faults pertaining to this present life and for the dispelling of faults pertaining to future lives … For the restraint of perils pertaining to this present life and for the dispelling of perils pertaining to future lives … For the restraint of unwholesome qualities pertaining to this present life and for the dispelling of unwholesome qualities pertaining to future lives … Out of compassion for laypeople and to stop the faction of those with evil desires … So that those without confidence might gain confidence and for increasing \[the confidence\] of those with confidence … For the continuation of the good Dhamma and for promoting the discipline. It is for these two reasons that the Tathāgata has prescribed the training rules for his disciples.”### 281-309
