# AN2.45

> **Division:** V. ASSEMBLIES

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of assemblies. What two? The assembly of the noble and the assembly of the ignoble.

“And what is the assembly of the ignoble? The assembly in which the bhikkhus do not understand as it really is: ‘This is suffering’; do not understand as it really is: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; do not understand as it really is: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; do not understand as it really is: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’ is called the assembly of the ignoble.

“And what is the assembly of the noble? The assembly in which the bhikkhus understand as it really is: ‘This is suffering’; understand as it really is: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; \[72\] understand as it really is: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; understand as it really is: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’ is called the assembly of the noble.

“These, bhikkhus, are the two kinds of assemblies. Of these two kinds of assemblies, the assembly of the noble is foremost.”
