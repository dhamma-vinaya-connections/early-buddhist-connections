# AN2.157

> **Division:** XIV. MUNIFICENCE

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of gifts to present to a guest. What two? The gift of material goods and the gift of the Dhamma. These are the two kinds of gifts to present to a guest. Of these two kinds of gifts to present to a guest, the gift of the Dhamma is foremost.”
