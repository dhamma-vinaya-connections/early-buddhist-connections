# AN2.11

> **Division:** II. DISCIPLINARY ISSUES

“Bhikkhus, there are these two powers. What two? The power of reflection and the power of development.

“And what is the power of reflection? Here, someone reflects thus: ‘Bodily misconduct has a bad result in the present life and in the future life; verbal misconduct has a bad result in the present life and in the future life; mental misconduct has a bad result in the present life and in the future life.’ Having reflected thus, he abandons bodily misconduct and develops bodily good conduct; he abandons verbal misconduct and develops verbal good conduct; he abandons mental misconduct and develops mental good conduct; he maintains himself in purity. This is called the power of reflection.

“And what is the power of development? The power of development is the power of trainees. For relying on the power of a trainee, one abandons lust, hatred, and delusion. Having abandoned lust, hatred, and delusion, one does not do anything unwholesome; one does not pursue anything bad. This is called the power of development.

“These, bhikkhus, are the two powers.”
