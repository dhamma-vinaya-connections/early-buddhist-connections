# AN2.38

> **Division:** IV. SAME-MINDED

On one occasion the Venerable Mahākaccāna was dwelling at Madhurā in Gundā’s Grove. Then the brahmin Kaṇḍarāyana approached the Venerable Mahākaccāna and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to him:

“I have heard, Master Kaccāna: ‘The ascetic Kaccāna does not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat.’ This is indeed true, for Master Kaccāna does not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat. This is not proper, Master Kaccāna.”

“Brahmin, the Blessed One, the Arahant, \[68\] the Perfectly Enlightened One, knowing and seeing, has proclaimed the stage of an elder and the stage of a youth. Even though someone is old—eighty, ninety, or a hundred years from birth—if he enjoys sensual pleasures, dwells in sensual pleasures, burns with a fever for sensual pleasures, is consumed with thoughts of sensual pleasures, is eager in the quest for sensual pleasures, then he is reckoned as a foolish \[childish\] elder. But even though someone is young, a youth with dark black hair, endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life, if he does not enjoy sensual pleasures, does not dwell in sensual pleasures, does not burn with a fever for sensual pleasures, is not consumed with thoughts of sensual pleasures, is not eager in the quest for sensual pleasures, then he is reckoned as a wise elder.”

When this was said, the brahmin Kaṇḍarāyana rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and bowed down with his head at the feet of the young bhikkhus, \[saying\]: “You elders stand at the stage of an elder; we youths stand at the stage of a youth.

“Excellent, Master Kaccāna! … \[as in 2:37\] … Let Master Kaccāna consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”
