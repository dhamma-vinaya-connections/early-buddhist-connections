# AN2.48

> **Division:** V. ASSEMBLIES

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of assemblies. What two? The assembly that values worldly things, not the good Dhamma, and the assembly that values the good Dhamma, not worldly things.

“And what is the assembly that values worldly things, not the good Dhamma? Here, in this kind of assembly the bhikkhus speak one another’s praises in the presence of householders clad in white, saying: ‘The bhikkhu so-and-so is one liberated in both respects; so-and-so is one liberated by wisdom; \[74\] so-and-so is a body witness; so-and-so is one attained to view; so-and-so is one liberated by faith; so-and-so is a Dhamma follower; so-and-so is a faith follower; so-and-so is virtuous and of good character; so-and-so is immoral and of bad character.’ They thereby receive gains, which they use while being tied to them, infatuated with them, blindly absorbed in them, not seeing the danger in them, not understanding the escape. This is called the assembly that values worldly things, not the good Dhamma.

“And what is the assembly that values the good Dhamma, not worldly things? Here, in this kind of assembly the bhikkhus do not speak one another’s praises in the presence of householders clad in white, saying: ‘The bhikkhu so-and-so is one liberated in both respects … so-and-so is immoral and of bad character.’ They thereby receive gains, which they use without being tied to them, uninfatuated with them, not blindly absorbed in them, seeing the danger in them, understanding the escape. This is called the assembly that values the good Dhamma, not worldly things.

“These, bhikkhus, are the two kinds of assemblies. Of these two kinds of assemblies, the assembly that values the good Dhamma, not worldly things, is foremost.”
