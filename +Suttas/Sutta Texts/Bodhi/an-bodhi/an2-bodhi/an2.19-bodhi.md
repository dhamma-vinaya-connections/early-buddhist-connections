# AN2.19

> **Division:** II. DISCIPLINARY ISSUES

“Bhikkhus, abandon the unwholesome! It is possible to abandon the unwholesome. If it were not possible to abandon the unwholesome, I would not say: ‘Bhikkhus, abandon the unwholesome!’ But because it is possible to abandon the unwholesome, I say: ‘Bhikkhus, abandon the unwholesome!’ If this abandoning of the unwholesome led to harm and suffering, I would not tell you to abandon it. But because the abandoning of the unwholesome leads to welfare and happiness, I say: ‘Bhikkhus, abandon the unwholesome!’

“Bhikkhus, develop the wholesome! It is possible to develop the wholesome. If it were not possible to develop the wholesome, I would not say: ‘Bhikkhus, develop the wholesome!’ But because it is possible to develop the wholesome, I say: ‘Bhikkhus, develop the wholesome!’ If this developing of the wholesome led to harm and suffering, I would not tell you to develop it. But because the developing of the wholesome leads to welfare and happiness, I say: ‘Bhikkhus, develop the wholesome!’”
