# AN2.137

> **Division:** XII. ASPIRING

“Bhikkhus, behaving wrongly toward two persons, the foolish, incompetent, bad person maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition; he is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise; and he generates much demerit. What two? The Tathāgata and a disciple of the Tathāgata. Behaving wrongly toward these two persons, the foolish, incompetent, bad person maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition; he is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise; and he generates much demerit. \[91\]

“Bhikkhus, behaving rightly toward two persons, the wise, competent, good person preserves himself unmaimed and uninjured; he is blameless and beyond reproach among the wise; and he generates much merit. What two? The Tathāgata and a disciple of the Tathāgata. Behaving rightly toward these two persons, the wise, competent, good person preserves himself unmaimed and uninjured; he is blameless and beyond reproach by the wise; and he generates much merit.”
