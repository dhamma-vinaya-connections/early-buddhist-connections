# AN4.234 Soṇakāyana

> **Division:** IV. KAMMA

Then the brahmin Sikhāmoggallāna approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him…. Then, sitting to one side, he said to the Blessed One:

“In earlier days, Master Gotama, a long time ago, the brahmin student Soṇakāyana approached me and said: ‘The ascetic Gotama prescribes the desistance from all kamma. But by prescribing the desistance from all kamma, he advocates the annihilation of the world. This world, sir, which has kamma as its substance, continues through the undertaking of kamma.’”

\[The Blessed One:\] “I do not recall even seeing the brahmin student Soṇakāyana, brahmin. How then could there have been such a discussion? There are, brahmin, these four kinds of kamma proclaimed by me after I realized them for myself with direct knowledge. What four?”

\[The rest of the sutta is identical with 4:233.\] \[233\]
