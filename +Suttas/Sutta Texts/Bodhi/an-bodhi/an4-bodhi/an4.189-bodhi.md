# AN4.189 Realization

> **Division:** IV. BRAHMINS

“Bhikkhus, there are these four things to be realized. What four? \[183\]

“There are things to be realized by the body; there are things to be realized by memory; there are things to be realized by the eye; there are things to be realized by wisdom.

(1) “And what, bhikkhus, are the things to be realized by the body? The eight emancipations, bhikkhus, are to be realized by the body. (2) And what are the things to be realized by memory? One’s past abodes are to be realized by memory. (3) And what are the things to be realized by the eye? The passing away and rebirth of beings are to be realized by the eye. (4) And what are the things to be realized by wisdom? The destruction of the taints is to be realized by wisdom.

“These, bhikkhus, are the four things to be realized.”
