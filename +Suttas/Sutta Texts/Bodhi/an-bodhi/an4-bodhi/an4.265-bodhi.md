“Bhikkhus, one possessing four qualities is deposited in hell as if brought there. What four? (1) He himself takes what is not given … \[254\] … engages in sexual misconduct … speaks falsely … speaks divisively … speaks harshly … \[255\] … indulges in idle chatter … is full of longing … bears ill will … holds wrong view; (2) he encourages others in wrong view; (3) he approves of wrong view; and (4) he speaks in praise of wrong view. One possessing these four qualities is deposited in hell as if brought there.

“Bhikkhus, one possessing four \[other\] qualities is deposited in heaven as if brought there. What four? (1) He himself abstains from taking what is not given … holds right view; (2) he encourages others in right view; (3) he approves of right view; and (4) he speaks in praise of right view. \[256\] One possessing these four qualities is deposited in heaven as if brought there.”
