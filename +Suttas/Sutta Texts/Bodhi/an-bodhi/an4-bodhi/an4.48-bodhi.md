# AN4.48 Visākha

> **Division:** V. ROHITASSA

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now on that occasion the Venerable Visākha Pañcāliputta was instructing, exhorting, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk, \[spoken\] with speech that was polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning, comprehensive, and unhindered.

Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and approached the assembly hall. He sat down on the appointed seat and addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, who has been instructing, exhorting, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk, \[spoken\] with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning, comprehensive, and unhindered?”

“It was Venerable Visākha Pañcāliputta, Bhante.”

Then the Blessed One said to the Venerable Visākha Pañcāliputta: “Good, good, Visākha! It is good that you instruct, exhort, inspire, and gladden the bhikkhus in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk, \[spoken\] with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning, comprehensive, and unhindered.”

When the wise man is in the midst of fools,

they do not know him if he does not speak.

But they know him when he speaks,

teaching the deathless state.

He should speak and illustrate the Dhamma;

he should lift high the seers’ banner.

Well-spoken words are the seers’ banner:

for the Dhamma is the banner of seers. \[52\]
