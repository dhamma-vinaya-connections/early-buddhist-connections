# AN4.16 Exquisiteness

> **Division:** II. WALKING

“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of exquisiteness. What four? (1) Here, a bhikkhu possesses supreme exquisiteness of form. He does not perceive any other exquisiteness of form more excellent or sublime than that one; he does not yearn for any other exquisiteness of form more excellent or sublime than that one. (2) He possesses supreme exquisiteness of feeling \[18\] … (3) … supreme exquisiteness of perception … (4) … supreme exquisiteness of volitional activities. He does not perceive any other exquisiteness of volitional activities more excellent or sublime than that one; he does not yearn for any other exquisiteness of volitional activities more excellent or sublime than that one.

“These are the four kinds of exquisiteness.”

Having known the exquisiteness of form,

the origination of feelings,

how perception arises,

and where it disappears;

having known volitional activities

as alien, as suffering, and not as self,

truly that bhikkhu who sees rightly,

peaceful, delights in the peaceful state.

He bears his final body,

having conquered Māra and his mount.
