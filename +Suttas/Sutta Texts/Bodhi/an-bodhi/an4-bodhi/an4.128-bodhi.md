# AN4.128 Astounding (2)

> **Division:** III. PERILS

“Bhikkhus, with the manifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One, four astounding and amazing things become manifest. What four?

(1) “People delight in attachment, take delight in attachment, rejoice in attachment. But when a Tathāgata is teaching the Dhamma about non-attachment, people wish to listen, and they lend an ear and set their minds on understanding it. This is the first astounding and amazing thing that becomes manifest with the manifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One.

(2) “People delight in conceit, take delight in conceit, rejoice in conceit. \[132\] But when a Tathāgata is teaching the Dhamma for the removal of conceit, people wish to listen, and they lend an ear and set their minds on understanding it. This is the second astounding and amazing thing that becomes manifest with the manifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One.

(3) “People delight in excitement, take delight in excitement, rejoice in excitement. But when a Tathāgata is teaching the Dhamma that leads to peace, people wish to listen, and they lend an ear and set their minds on understanding it. This is the third astounding and amazing thing that becomes manifest with the manifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One.

(4) “People are immersed in ignorance, become like an egg, completely enveloped. But when a Tathāgata is teaching the Dhamma for the removal of ignorance, people wish to listen, and they lend an ear and set their minds on understanding it. This is the fourth astounding and amazing thing that becomes manifest with the manifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One.

“These, bhikkhus, are the four astounding and amazing things that become manifest with the manifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One.”
