# AN4.230 Unwise

> **Division:** III. GOOD CONDUCT

“Bhikkhus, possessing four qualities, the foolish, incompetent, bad person maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition; he is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise; and he generates much demerit. What four? He is devoid of faith, immoral, lazy, and unwise. Possessing these four qualities … he generates much demerit.

“Bhikkhus, possessing four \[other\] qualities, the wise, competent, good person preserves himself unmaimed and uninjured; he is blameless and beyond reproach by the wise; and he generates much merit. What four? He is endowed with faith, is virtuous, energetic, and wise. Possessing these four qualities … he generates much merit.”
