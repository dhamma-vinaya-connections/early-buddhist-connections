# AN4.252 Declarations (3)

> **Division:** V. PERILS OF OFFENSES

“Bhikkhus, there are these four ignoble declarations. What four? Saying that one has not seen what one has seen, saying that one has not heard what one has heard, saying that one has not sensed what one has sensed, saying that one has not cognized what one has cognized. There are these four ignoble declarations.”
