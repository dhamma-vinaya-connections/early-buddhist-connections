# AN4.179 Nibbāna

> **Division:** III. VOLITIONAL

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Venerable Sāriputta … and said to him:

“Why is it, friend Sāriputta, that some beings do not attain nibbāna in this very life?”

“Here, friend Ānanda, \[some\] beings do not understand as it really is: ‘These perceptions pertain to deterioration; these perceptions pertain to stabilization; these perceptions pertain to distinction; these perceptions pertain to penetration.’ This is why some beings here do not attain nibbāna in this very life.
