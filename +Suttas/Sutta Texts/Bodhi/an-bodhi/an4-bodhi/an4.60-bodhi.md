# AN4.60 The Layperson’s Proper Practice

> **Division:** I. STREAMS OF MERIT

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One…. The Blessed One said to him:

“Householder, a noble disciple who possesses four qualities is practicing the way proper to the layperson, a way that brings the attainment of fame and leads to heaven. What four?

“Here, householder, a noble disciple serves the Saṅgha of bhikkhus with robes; he serves the Saṅgha of bhikkhus with almsfood; he serves the Saṅgha of bhikkhus with lodgings; he serves the Saṅgha of bhikkhus with medicines and provisions for the sick.

“Householder, a noble disciple who possesses these four qualities is practicing the way proper to the layperson, a way that brings the attainment of fame and leads to heaven.”

When the wise practice the way

proper for the layperson, they serve

the virtuous monks of upright conduct

with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines:

for them both by day and night

merit always increases;

having done excellent deeds,

they pass on to a heavenly state.
