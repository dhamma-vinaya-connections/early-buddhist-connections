# AN4.276-783 Four Bases for Psychic Potency

> **Division:** VIII. LUST AND SO FORTH REPETITION SERIES

“Bhikkhus, for direct knowledge of lust, four things are to be developed. What four? (1) Here, a bhikkhu develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to desire and activities of striving. (2) He develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to energy … (3) … that possesses concentration due to mind … (4) … that possesses concentration due to investigation and activities of striving. For direct knowledge of lust, these four things are to be developed.”


277

“Bhikkhus, for full understanding of lust … for the utter destruction … for the abandoning … \[257\] … for the destruction … for the vanishing … for the fading away … for the cessation … for the giving up … For the relinquishment of lust, these four things are to be developed.”

“Bhikkhus, for direct knowledge … for full understanding … for the utter destruction … for the abandoning … for the destruction … for the vanishing … for the fading away … for the cessation … for the giving up … for the relinquishment of hatred … of delusion … of anger … of hostility … of denigration … of insolence … of envy … of miserliness … of deceitfulness … of craftiness … of obstinacy … of vehemence … of conceit … of arrogance … of intoxication … of heedlessness, these four things are to be developed. What four? (1) Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body … (2) … feelings in feelings … (3) … mind in mind … (4) … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed longing and dejection in regard to the world. (1) Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the non-arising of unarisen bad unwholesome states … (2) … for the abandoning of arisen bad unwholesome states … (3) … for the arising of unarisen wholesome states … (4) … for the maintenance of arisen wholesome states, for their non-decline, increase, expansion, and fulfillment by development; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. (1) Here, a bhikkhu develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to desire … (2) … that possesses concentration due to energy … (3) … that possesses concentration due to mind … (4) … that possesses concentration due to investigation and activities of striving. For the relinquishment of heedlessness, these four things are to be developed.”

This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One’s statement.

The Book of the Fours is finished.
