# AN4.88 Fetters

> **Division:** IV. UNSHAKABLE

“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? The ascetic unshaken, the white-lotus ascetic, the red-lotus ascetic, and the delicate ascetic among ascetics.

(1) “And how, bhikkhus, is a person an ascetic unshaken? Here, with the utter destruction of three fetters, \[89\] a bhikkhu is a stream-enterer, no longer subject to \[rebirth in\] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment. It is in this way that a person is an ascetic unshaken.

(2) “And how is a person a white-lotus ascetic? Here, with the utter destruction of three fetters and with the diminishing of greed, hatred, and delusion, a bhikkhu is a once-returner who, after coming back to this world only one more time, will make an end of suffering. It is in this way that a person is a white-lotus ascetic.

(3) “And how is a person a red-lotus ascetic? Here, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, a bhikkhu is one of spontaneous birth, due to attain final nibbāna there without returning from that world. It is in this way that a person is a red-lotus ascetic.

(4) “And how is a person a delicate ascetic among ascetics? Here, with the destruction of the taints, a bhikkhu has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. It is in this way that a person is a delicate ascetic among ascetics.

“These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.”
