# AN4.67 Snakes

> **Division:** II. WORTHY DEEDS

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now on that occasion, in Sāvatthī, a certain bhikkhu had been bitten by a snake and had died. Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: “Bhante, a certain bhikkhu here in Sāvatthī was bitten by a snake and died.”

\[The Blessed One said:\] “Surely, bhikkhus, that bhikkhu did not pervade the four royal families of snakes with a mind of loving-kindness. For if he had done so, he would not have been bitten by a snake and died. What are the four? The _virūpakkha_ royal family of snakes, the _erāpatha_ royal family of snakes, the _chabyāputta_ royal family of snakes, and the black _gotamaka_ royal family of snakes. Surely, that bhikkhu did not pervade these four royal families of snakes with a mind of loving-kindness. For if he had done so, he would not have been bitten by a snake and died.

“I enjoin you, bhikkhus, to pervade these four royal families of snakes with a mind of loving-kindness, for your own security, safety, and protection.”

I have loving-kindness for the _virūpakkha_ snakes;

for the _erāpatha_ snakes I have loving-kindness.

I have loving-kindness for the _chabyāputta_ snakes;

for the black _gotamakas_ I have loving-kindness.

I have loving-kindness for footless creatures;

for those with two feet I have loving-kindness. \[73\]

I have loving-kindness for those with four feet;

for those with many feet I have loving-kindness.

May footless beings not harm me;

may no harm come to me from those with two feet;

may four-footed beings not harm me;

may no harm come to me from those with many feet.

May all beings, all living things,

all creatures, every one,

meet with good fortune;

may nothing bad come to anyone.

The Buddha is measureless, the Dhamma is measureless, the Saṅgha is measureless; creeping things, snakes, scorpions, centipedes, spiders, lizards, and rats are finite. I have made a safeguard, I have made protection. Let the creatures retreat. I pay homage to the Blessed One, homage to the seven Perfectly Enlightened Ones.
