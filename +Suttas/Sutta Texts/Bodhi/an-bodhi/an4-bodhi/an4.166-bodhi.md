# AN4.166 Both

> **Division:** II. MODES OF PRACTICE

“Bhikkhus, there are these four modes of practice. What four? (1) Practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge; (2) practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge; (3) practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge; and (4) practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge.

(1) “The mode of practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge is declared to be inferior for both reasons: because it is painful and because direct knowledge is sluggish. This mode of practice is declared to be inferior for both reasons.

(2) “The mode of practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge is declared to be inferior because of its painfulness.

(3) “The mode of practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge is declared to be inferior because of its sluggishness.

(4) “The mode of practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge is declared to be superior for both reasons: because practice is pleasant and because direct knowledge is quick. This mode of practice is declared to be superior for both reasons.

“These, bhikkhus, are the four modes of practice.”
