# AN4.109 Trees

> **Division:** I. CLOUDS

“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of trees. What four? \[110\] The one made of softwood that is surrounded by softwood \[trees\]; the one made of softwood that is surrounded by hardwood \[trees\]; the one made of hardwood that is surrounded by softwood \[trees\]; and the one made of hardwood that is surrounded by hardwood \[trees\]. These are the four kinds of trees. So too, there are these four kinds of persons similar to trees found existing in the world. What four? The one made of softwood who is surrounded by softwood \[trees\]; the one made of softwood who is surrounded by hardwood \[trees\]; the one made of hardwood who is surrounded by softwood \[trees\]; and the one made of hardwood who is surrounded by hardwood \[trees\].

(1) “And how, bhikkhus, is a person made of softwood and surrounded by softwood \[trees\]? Here, someone is immoral, of bad character, and his retinue is also immoral, of bad character. It is in this way that a person is made of softwood and surrounded by softwood \[trees\]. So, I say, this person is just like a tree made of softwood and surrounded by softwood \[trees\].

(2) “And how is a person made of softwood but surrounded by hardwood \[trees\]? Here, someone is immoral, of bad character, but his retinue is virtuous, of good character. It is in this way that a person is made of softwood but surrounded by hardwood \[trees\]. So, I say, this person is just like a tree made of softwood but surrounded by hardwood \[trees\].

(3) “And how is a person made of hardwood but surrounded by softwood \[trees\]? Here, someone is virtuous, of good character, but his retinue is immoral, of bad character. It is in this way that a person is made of hardwood but surrounded by softwood \[trees\]. So, I say, this person is just like a tree made of hardwood but surrounded by softwood \[trees\].
