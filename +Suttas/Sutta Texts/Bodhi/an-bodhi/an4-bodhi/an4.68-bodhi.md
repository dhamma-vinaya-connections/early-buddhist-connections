# AN4.68 Devadatta

> **Division:** II. WORTHY DEEDS

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak soon after Devadatta had left. There the Blessed One, with reference to Devadatta, addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, Devadatta’s gain, honor, and praise led to his own ruin and destruction. (1) Just as a plantain tree yields fruit to its own ruin and destruction, so Devadatta’s gain, honor, and praise led to his own ruin and destruction. (2) Just as a bamboo yields fruit to its own ruin and destruction, so Devadatta’s gain, honor, and praise led to his own ruin and destruction. (3) Just as a reed yields fruit to its own ruin and destruction, so Devadatta’s gain, honor, and praise led to his own ruin and destruction. (4) Just as a mule becomes pregnant to its own ruin and destruction, so Devadatta’s gain, honor, and praise led to his own ruin and destruction.”

As its own fruit destroys the plantain,

as its fruit destroys the bamboo and reed,

as its embryo destroys the mule,

so does honor destroy the vile man. \[74\]
