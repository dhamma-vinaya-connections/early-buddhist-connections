# AN4.43 Anger (1)

> **Division:** V. ROHITASSA

“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? (1) One who values anger, not the good Dhamma; (2) one who values denigration, not the good Dhamma; (3) one who values gain, not the good Dhamma; and (4) one who values honor, not the good Dhamma. These are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.

“There are, bhikkhus, these four \[other\] kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? (1) One who values the good Dhamma, not anger; (2) one who values the good Dhamma, not denigration; (3) one who values the good Dhamma, not gain; (4) one who values the good Dhamma, not honor. \[47\] These are the \[other\] four kinds of persons found existing in the world.”

Bhikkhus who value anger and denigration,

who value gain and honor,

do not grow in the good Dhamma



taught by the Perfectly Enlightened One.

But those who value the good Dhamma,

who dwelled thus in the past and dwell thus now,

truly grow in the Dhamma

taught by the Perfectly Enlightened One.
