# AN4.158 Decline

> **Division:** I. FACULTIES

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: “Friends, \[144\] bhikkhus!”

“Friend!” those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

“Friends, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who observes four things inwardly can come to the conclusion: ‘I am declining in wholesome qualities. This is called decline by the Blessed One.’ What four? An abundance of lust, an abundance of hatred, an abundance of delusion, and his wisdom eye does not tread in the deep matters of what is possible and impossible. Any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who observes these four things inwardly can come to the conclusion: ‘I am declining in wholesome qualities. This is called decline by the Blessed One.’

“Friends, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who observes four things inwardly can come to the conclusion: ‘I am not declining in wholesome qualities. This is called non-decline by the Blessed One.’ What four? The diminishing of lust, the diminishing of hatred, the diminishing of delusion, and his wisdom eye treads in the deep matters of what is possible and impossible. Any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who observes these four things inwardly can come to the conclusion: ‘I am not declining in wholesome qualities. This is called non-decline by the Blessed One.’”
