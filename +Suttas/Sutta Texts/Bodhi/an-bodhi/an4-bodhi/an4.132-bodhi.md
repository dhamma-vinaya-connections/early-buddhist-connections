# AN4.132 Discernment

> **Division:** IV. PERSONS

“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? One whose discernment is incisive but not free-flowing; one whose discernment is free-flowing but not incisive; one whose discernment is both incisive and free-flowing; and one whose discernment is neither incisive nor free-flowing. These are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.”
