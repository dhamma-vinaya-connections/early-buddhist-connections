# AN4.171 Volition

> **Division:** III. VOLITIONAL

“Bhikkhus, when there is the body, then because of bodily volition \[158\] pleasure and pain arise internally; when there is speech, then because of verbal volition pleasure and pain arise internally; when there is the mind, then because of mental volition pleasure and pain arise internally—with ignorance itself as condition.

“Either on one’s own, bhikkhus, one performs that bodily volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally, or others make one generate that bodily volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally. Either with clear comprehension one performs that bodily volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally, or without clear comprehension one performs that bodily volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally.

“Either on one’s own, bhikkhus, one performs that verbal volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally, or others make one perform that verbal volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally. Either with clear comprehension one performs that verbal volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally, or without clear comprehension one performs that verbal volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally.

“Either on one’s own, bhikkhus, one performs that mental volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally, or others make one perform that mental volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally. Either with clear comprehension one performs that mental volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally, or without clear comprehension one performs that mental volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally.

“Ignorance is comprised within these states. But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance that body does not exist conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in one internally; that speech does not exist conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in one internally; that mind does not exist conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in one internally. That field does not exist, that site \[159\] does not exist, that base does not exist, that location does not exist conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in one internally.

“Bhikkhus, there are these four acquisitions of individuality. What four? (1) There is an acquisition of individuality in which one’s own volition operates, not the volition of others. (2) There is an acquisition of individuality in which the volition of others operates, not one’s own volition. (3) There is an acquisition of individuality in which both one’s own volition and the volition of others operate. (4) And there is an acquisition of individuality in which neither one’s own volition nor the volition of others operates. These are the four acquisitions of individuality.”

When this was said, the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, I understand in detail the meaning of this statement that the Blessed One has spoken in brief to be as follows. (1) In that acquisition of individuality in which one’s own volition operates but not the volition of others, it is by reason of their own volition that beings pass away from that group. (2) In that acquisition of individuality in which the volition of others operates but not one’s own volition, it is by reason of the volition of others that beings pass away from that group. (3) In that acquisition of individuality in which both one’s own volition and the volition of others operate, it is by reason of both one’s own volition and the volition of others that beings pass away from that group. (4) But, Bhante, what kind of devas should be understood as the acquisition of individuality in which neither one’s own volition nor the volition of others operates?”

“They are, Sāriputta, the devas of the base of neither perception-nor-non-perception.”

“Why is it, Bhante, that some beings who pass away from that group are returners, who come back to this state of being, while \[160\] others are non-returners, who do not come back to this state of being?”

“Here, Sāriputta, some person has not abandoned the lower fetters. In this very life he enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. He relishes it, desires it, and finds satisfaction in it. If he is firm in it, focused on it, often dwells in it, and has not lost it when he dies, he is reborn in companionship with the devas in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. When he passes away from there he is a returner who comes back to this state of being.

“But some \[other\] person here has abandoned the lower fetters. In this very life he enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. He relishes it, desires it, and finds satisfaction in it. If he is firm in it, focused on it, often dwells in it, and has not lost it when he dies, he is reborn in companionship with the devas in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. When he passes away from there he is a non-returner who does not come back to this state of being.

“This, Sāriputta, is the reason some beings here who pass away from that group are returners, who come back to this state of being, while others are non-returners, who do not come back to this state of being.”
