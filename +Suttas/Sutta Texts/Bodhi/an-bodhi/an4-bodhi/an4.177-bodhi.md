# AN4.177 Rāhula

> **Division:** III. VOLITIONAL

Then the Venerable Rāhula approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

(1) “Rāhula, the internal earth element and the external earth element are just the earth element. This should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Having seen this thus as it really is with correct wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the earth element; one detaches the mind from the earth element.

(2) “Rāhula, the internal water element and the external water element \[165\] are just the water element. This should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Having seen this thus as it really is with correct wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the water element; one detaches the mind from the water element.

(3) “Rāhula, the internal fire element and the external fire element are just the fire element. This should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Having seen this thus as it really is with correct wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the fire element; one detaches the mind from the fire element.

(4) “Rāhula, the internal air element and the external air element are just the air element. This should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Having seen this thus as it really is with correct wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the air element; one detaches the mind from the air element.

“When, Rāhula, a bhikkhu does not recognize a self or the belongings of a self in these four elements, he is called a bhikkhu who has cut off craving, stripped off the fetter, and by completely breaking through conceit, has made an end of suffering.”
