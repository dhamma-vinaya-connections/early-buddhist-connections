# AN4.82 False Speech

> **Division:** IV. UNSHAKABLE

“Bhikkhus, one possessing four qualities is deposited in hell as if brought there. What four? One speaks falsely, speaks divisively, speaks harshly, and indulges in idle chatter. One possessing these four qualities is deposited in hell as if brought there. \[84\]

“Bhikkhus, one possessing four \[other\] qualities is deposited in heaven as if brought there. What four? One abstains from false speech, from divisive speech, from harsh speech, and from idle chatter. One possessing these four qualities is deposited in heaven as if brought there.”
