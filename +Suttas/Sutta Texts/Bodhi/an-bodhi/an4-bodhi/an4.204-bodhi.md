# AN4.204 Ten Actions

> **Division:** I. THE GOOD PERSON

\[Opening as in 4:201.\] \[220\]

(1) “And who, bhikkhus, is the bad person? Here, someone destroys life … indulges in idle chatter; he is full of longing, bears ill will, and holds wrong view. This is called the bad person.

(2) “And who is the person inferior to the bad person? Here, someone himself destroys life and encourages others to destroy life … he himself holds wrong view and encourages others in wrong view. This is called the person inferior to the bad person.

(3) “And who is the good person? Here, someone abstains from the destruction of life … abstains from idle chatter; he is without longing, of good will, and holds right view. This is called the good person.

(4) “And who is the person superior to the good person? Here, someone himself abstains from the destruction of life and encourages others to abstain from the destruction of life … he is himself without longing and encourages others in non-longing; he is himself of good will and encourages others in good will; he himself holds right view and encourages others in right view. This is called the person superior to the good person.”
