# AN4.70 Unrighteous

> **Division:** II. WORTHY DEEDS

“Bhikkhus, when kings are unrighteous, the royal vassals become unrighteous. When the royal vassals are unrighteous, brahmins and householders become unrighteous. When brahmins and householders are unrighteous, the people of the towns and countryside become unrighteous. When the people of the towns and countryside are unrighteous, the sun and moon \[75\] proceed off course. When the sun and moon proceed off course, the constellations and the stars proceed off course. When the constellations and the stars proceed off course, day and night proceed off course … the months and fortnights proceed off course … the seasons and years proceed off course. When the seasons and years proceed off course, the winds blow off course and at random. When the winds blow off course and at random, the deities become upset. When the deities are upset, sufficient rain does not fall. When sufficient rain does not fall, the crops ripen irregularly. When people eat crops that ripen irregularly, they become short-lived, ugly, weak, and sickly.

When the deities are not upset, sufficient rain falls. When sufficient rain falls, the crops ripen in season. When people eat crops that ripen in season, they become long-lived, beautiful, strong, and healthy.”

When cattle are crossing \[a ford\],

if the chief bull goes crookedly,

all the others go crookedly

because their leader has gone crookedly.

So too, among human beings,

when the one considered the chief

behaves unrighteously,

other people do so as well. \[76\]

The entire kingdom is dejected

if the king is unrighteous.

When cattle are crossing \[a ford\]

if the chief bull goes straight across,

all the others go straight across

because their leader has gone straight.

So too, among human beings,

when the one considered the chief

conducts himself righteously,

other people do so as well.

The entire kingdom rejoices

if the king is righteous.
