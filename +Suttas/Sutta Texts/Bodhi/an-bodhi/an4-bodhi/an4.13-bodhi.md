# AN4.13 Striving

> **Division:** II. WALKING

“Bhikkhus, there are these four right strivings. What four? (1) Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the non-arising of unarisen bad unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. (2) He generates desire for the abandoning of arisen bad unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. (3) He generates desire for the arising of unarisen wholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. (4) He generates desire for the persistence of arisen wholesome states, for their non-decline, increase, expansion, and fulfillment by development; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. These are the four right strivings.”

Those who strive rightly

overcome the realm of Māra;

they are unattached,

gone beyond fear of birth and death.

They are contented and unstirred,

having conquered Māra and his mount;

those happy ones have overcome

all Namuci’s armies. \[16\]
