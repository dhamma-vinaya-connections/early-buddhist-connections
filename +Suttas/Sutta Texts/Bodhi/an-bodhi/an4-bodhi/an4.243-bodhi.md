# AN4.243 Schism

> **Division:** V. PERILS OF OFFENSES

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Park. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

“Has that disciplinary issue been settled yet, Ānanda?”

“How could that disciplinary issue be settled, Bhante? The Venerable Anuruddha’s pupil Bāhiya is still fully intent on creating a schism in the Saṅgha, but the Venerable Anuruddha doesn’t think of saying even a single word about it.”

“But, Ānanda, when has Anuruddha ever concerned himself with disciplinary issues in the midst of the Saṅgha? Shouldn’t you, and Sāriputta and Moggallāna, settle any disciplinary issues that arise?

“Seeing these four advantages, Ānanda, an evil bhikkhu delights in a schism in the Saṅgha. What four?

(1) “Here, an evil bhikkhu is immoral, of bad character, impure, of suspect behavior, secretive in his actions, not an ascetic though claiming to be one, not a celibate though claiming to be one, \[240\] inwardly rotten, corrupt, depraved. It occurs to him: ‘If the bhikkhus find out that I am immoral … depraved, and they are united, they will expel me, but if they are divided into factions they won’t expel me.’ Seeing this first advantage, an evil bhikkhu delights in a schism in the Saṅgha.

(2) “Again, an evil bhikkhu holds wrong view; he resorts to an extremist view. It occurs to him: ‘If the bhikkhus find out that I hold wrong view, that I resort to an extremist view, and they are united, they will expel me, but if they are divided into factions they won’t expel me.’ Seeing this second advantage, an evil bhikkhu delights in a schism in the Saṅgha.

(3) “Again, an evil bhikkhu is of wrong livelihood; he earns his living by wrong livelihood. It occurs to him: ‘If the bhikkhus find out that I am of wrong livelihood and earn my living by wrong livelihood, and they are united, they will expel me, but if they are divided into factions they won’t expel me.’ Seeing this third advantage, an evil bhikkhu delights in a schism in the Saṅgha.

(4) “Again, an evil bhikkhu is desirous of gain, honor, and admiration. It occurs to him: ‘If the bhikkhus find out that I am desirous of gain, honor, and admiration, and they are united, they will not honor, respect, esteem, and venerate me; but if they are divided into factions they will honor, respect, esteem, and venerate me.’ Seeing this fourth advantage, an evil bhikkhu delights in a schism in the Saṅgha.

“Seeing these four advantages, Ānanda, an evil bhikkhu delights in a schism in the Saṅgha.”
