# AN4.139 Dhamma Speakers

> **Division:** IV. PERSONS

“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of Dhamma speakers. What four?

(1) “Here, bhikkhus, some Dhamma speaker speaks little and \[his speech is\] pointless, and his assembly is not skilled in distinguishing what is meaningful from what is pointless. Such a Dhamma speaker is reckoned as a Dhamma speaker by such an assembly.

(2) “Another Dhamma speaker speaks little but \[his speech is\] meaningful, and his assembly is skilled in distinguishing what is meaningful from what is pointless. Such a Dhamma speaker is reckoned as a Dhamma speaker by such an assembly.

(3) “Still another Dhamma speaker speaks much but \[his speech is\] pointless, and his assembly is not skilled in distinguishing what is meaningful from what is pointless. Such a Dhamma speaker is reckoned as a Dhamma speaker by such an assembly.

(4) “And still another Dhamma speaker speaks much and \[his speech is\] meaningful, and his assembly is skilled in distinguishing what is meaningful from what is pointless. Such a Dhamma speaker is reckoned as a Dhamma speaker by such an assembly.

“These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of Dhamma speakers.”
