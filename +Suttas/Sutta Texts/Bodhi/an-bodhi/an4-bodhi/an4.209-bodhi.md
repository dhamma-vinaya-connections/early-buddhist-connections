# AN4.209 Bad Character (3)

> **Division:** I. THE GOOD PERSON

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you about one of bad character \[224\] and about one of still worse character. I will teach you about one of good character and about one of still better character. Listen….

(1) “And who, bhikkhus, is of bad character? Here, someone destroys life … and holds wrong view. This is called one of bad character.

(2) “And who is one of still worse character? Here, someone himself destroys life and encourages others to destroy life … he holds wrong view himself and encourages others in wrong view. This is called one of still worse character.

(3) “And what is one of good character? Here, someone abstains from the destruction of life … and holds right view. This is called one of good character.

(4) “And what is one of still better character? Here, someone himself abstains from the destruction of life and encourages others to abstain from the destruction of life … he himself holds right view and encourages others in right view. This is called one of still better character.”
