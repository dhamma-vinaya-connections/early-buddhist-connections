# AN4.44 Anger (2)

> **Division:** V. ROHITASSA

“Bhikkhus, there are these four things contrary to the good Dhamma. What four? (1) Valuing anger, not the good Dhamma; (2) valuing denigration, not the good Dhamma; (3) valuing gain, not the good Dhamma; and (4) valuing honor, not the good Dhamma. These are four things contrary to the good Dhamma.

“There are, bhikkhus, these four \[other\] things in accord with the good Dhamma. What four? (1) Valuing the good Dhamma, not anger; (2) valuing the good Dhamma, not denigration; (3) valuing the good Dhamma, not gain; and (4) valuing the good Dhamma, not honor. These are the four \[other\] things in accord with the good Dhamma.”

Bhikkhus who value anger and denigration,

who value gain and honor,

are like rotten seeds in a fertile field:

they do not grow in the good Dhamma.

But those who value the good Dhamma,

who dwelled thus in the past and dwell thus now,

are like moistened medicinal plants:

they grow in the Dhamma.
