# AN4.65 Form

> **Division:** II. WORTHY DEEDS

“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? (1) One who judges on the basis of form, whose confidence is based on form. (2) One who judges on the basis of speech, whose confidence is based on speech. (3) One who judges on the basis of austerity, whose confidence is based on austerity. (4) One who judges on the basis of the Dhamma, whose confidence is based on the Dhamma. These are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.”

Those who judge on the basis of form

and those who follow because of speech

have come under the control of desire and lust;

those people do not understand.

One who does not know the inside

and does not see the outside,

a fool obstructed on all sides,

is carried away by speech.

One who does not know the inside

yet who clearly sees the outside,

seeing the fruit externally,

is also carried away by speech.

But one who understands the inside

and who clearly sees the outside,

seeing without hindrances,

is not carried away by speech.
