# AN4.101 Clouds (1)

> **Division:** I. CLOUDS

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”

“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of clouds. What four? The one that thunders but does not rain; the one that rains but does not thunder; the one that neither thunders nor rains; and the one that both thunders and rains. These are the four kinds of clouds. So too, there are these four kinds of persons similar to clouds found existing in the world. What four? The one who thunders but does not rain; the one who rains but does not thunder; the one who neither thunders nor rains; and the one who both thunders and rains.

(1) “And how, bhikkhus, is a person one who thunders but does not rain? Here, someone is a talker, not a doer. It is in this way that a person is one who thunders but does not rain. So, I say, this person is just like a cloud that thunders but does not rain.

(2) “And how is a person one who rains but does not thunder? Here, someone is a doer, not a talker. It is in this way that a person is one who rains but does not thunder. So, I say, this person is just like a cloud that rains but does not thunder.

(3) “And how is a person one who neither thunders nor rains? Here, someone is neither a talker nor a doer. It is in this way that a person is one who neither thunders nor rains. So, I say, this person is just like a cloud that neither thunders nor rains.

(4) “And how is a person one who both thunders and rains? Here, someone is both a talker and a doer. It is in this way that a person is one who both thunders and rains. So, I say, this person is just like a cloud that both thunders and rains.

“These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons similar to clouds found existing in the world.” \[103\]
