# AN4.251 Declarations (2)

> **Division:** V. PERILS OF OFFENSES

“Bhikkhus, there are these four noble declarations. What four? Saying that one has not seen what one has not seen, saying that one has not heard what one has not heard, saying that one has not sensed what one has not sensed, saying that one has not cognized what one has not cognized. There are these four noble declarations.”
