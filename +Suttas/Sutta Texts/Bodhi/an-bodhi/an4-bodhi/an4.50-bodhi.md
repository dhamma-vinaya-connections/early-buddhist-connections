# AN4.50 Defilements

> **Division:** V. ROHITASSA

“Bhikkhus, there are these four defilements of the sun and moon because of which the sun and moon do not shine, blaze, and radiate. What four? Clouds are a defilement of the sun and moon because of which the sun and moon do not shine, blaze, and radiate; fog is a defilement of the sun and moon … smoke and dust is a defilement of the sun and moon … and Rāhu, lord of the asuras, is a defilement of the sun and moon because of which the sun and moon do not shine, blaze, and radiate. These are the four defilements of the sun and moon because of which the sun and moon do not shine, blaze, and radiate.

“So too, bhikkhus, there are four defilements of ascetics and brahmins because of which some ascetics and brahmins do not shine, blaze, and radiate. What four?

(1) “There are some ascetics and brahmins who drink liquor and wine and do not refrain from drinking liquor and wine. This is the first defilement of ascetics and brahmins because of which some ascetics and brahmins do not shine, blaze, and radiate.

(2) “There are some ascetics and brahmins who indulge in sexual intercourse and do not refrain from sexual intercourse. This is the second defilement of ascetics and brahmins because of which some ascetics and brahmins do not shine, blaze, and radiate.

(3) “There are some ascetics and brahmins who accept gold and silver and do not refrain from receiving gold and silver. This is the third defilement of ascetics and brahmins because of which some ascetics and brahmins do not shine, blaze, and radiate.

(4) “There are some ascetics and brahmins who earn their living by wrong livelihood and do not refrain from wrong livelihood. This is the fourth defilement of ascetics and brahmins because of which some ascetics and brahmins do not shine, blaze, and radiate.

“These are the four defilements of ascetics and brahmins \[54\] because of which some ascetics and brahmins do not shine, blaze, and radiate.”

Some ascetics and brahmins

are dragged around by lust and hatred;

men hindered by ignorance

seek delight in pleasant things.

They drink liquor and wines,

indulge in sexual activity;

the ignorant accept

silver and gold.

Some ascetics and brahmins

live by wrong livelihood.

These are the defilements that the Buddha,

Kinsman of the Sun, described.

Defiled by these,

some ascetics and brahmins—

impure, dusty creatures—

do not shine and blaze.

Shrouded in darkness,

slaves of craving, led along,

they take renewed existence

and fill the terrible charnel ground.

The Second Fifty
