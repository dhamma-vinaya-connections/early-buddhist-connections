# AN4.236 Training Rules (2)

> **Division:** IV. KAMMA

\[Opening as in 4:233.\]

(1) “And what, bhikkhus, is dark kamma with dark result? Here, someone takes his mother’s life, takes his father’s life, takes an arahant’s life, with a mind of hatred sheds the Tathāgata’s blood, or creates a schism in the Saṅgha. \[235\] This is called dark kamma with dark result.

(2) “And what is bright kamma with bright result? Here, someone abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from divisive speech, abstains from harsh speech, and abstains from idle chatter; he is without longing, of good will, and holds right view. This is called bright kamma with bright result.

(3) “And what is dark-and-bright kamma with dark-andbright result? … \[as in 4:235\] … This is called dark-and-bright kamma with dark-and-bright result.

(4) “And what is kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither-dark-nor-bright result, kamma that leads to the destruction of kamma? … \[as in 4:235\] … this is called kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither-dark-nor-bright result, kamma that leads to the destruction of kamma.

“These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of kamma proclaimed by me after I realized them for myself with direct knowledge.”
