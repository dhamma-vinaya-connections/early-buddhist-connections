# AN4.42 Questions

> **Division:** V. ROHITASSA

“Bhikkhus, there are these four ways of answering questions. What four? (1) There is a question to be answered categorically; (2) there is a question to be answered after making a distinction; (3) there is a question to be answered with a counter-question; and (4) there is a question to be set aside. These are the four ways of answering questions.”

One kind is given a categorical answer,

another is answered after making a distinction;

to the third, one should raise a counter-question,

but the fourth should be set aside.

When a bhikkhu knows how to answer

each type in the appropriate way,

they say that he is skilled

in the four kinds of questions.

He is hard to attack, hard to defeat,

deep, hard to assault;

he is proficient in both

what is beneficial and harmful.

The wise person avoids what is harmful,

and takes up what is beneficial.

By arriving at what is beneficial,

the steadfast one is said to be wise.
