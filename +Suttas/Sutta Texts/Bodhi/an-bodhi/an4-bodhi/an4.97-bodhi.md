# AN4.97 Quick-Witted

> **Division:** V. ASURAS

“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? (1) One who is practicing for his own welfare but not for the welfare of others; (2) one who is practicing for the welfare of others but not for his own welfare; (3) one who is practicing neither for his own welfare nor for the welfare of others; and (4) one who is practicing both for his own welfare and for the welfare of others.

(1) “And how, bhikkhus, is a person practicing for his own welfare but not for the welfare of others? Here, some person is quick in attending to wholesome teachings, is able to retain in mind the teachings he has heard, and examines the meaning of the teachings he has retained. Having understood the meaning and the Dhamma, he practices in accordance with the Dhamma. However, he is not a good speaker with a good delivery; he is not gifted with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning; and he does not instruct, encourage, inspire, and gladden his fellow monks. It is in this way that a person is practicing for his own welfare but not for the welfare of others.

(2) “And how is a person practicing for the welfare of others but not for his own welfare? Here, some person is not quick in attending to wholesome teachings, is unable to retain in mind the teachings he has heard, and does not examine the meaning of the teachings he has retained. Having no understanding of the meaning and the Dhamma, he does not practice in accordance with the Dhamma. However, he is a good speaker with a good delivery; he is gifted with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning; and he instructs, encourages, inspires, and gladdens his fellow monks. It is in this way that a person is practicing for the welfare of others but not for his own welfare. \[98\]

(3) “And how is a person practicing neither for his own welfare nor for the welfare of others? Here, some person is not quick in attending to wholesome teachings … he does not practice in accordance with the Dhamma. Moreover, he is not a good speaker with a good delivery … and he does not instruct, encourage, inspire, and gladden his fellow monks. It is in this way that a person is practicing neither for his own welfare nor for the welfare of others.

(4) “And how is a person practicing both for his own welfare and for the welfare of others? Here, some person is quick in attending to wholesome teachings … he practices in accordance with the Dhamma. Moreover, he is a good speaker with a good delivery … and he instructs, encourages, inspires, and gladdens his fellow monks. It is in this way that a person is practicing both for his own welfare and for the welfare of others.

“These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.”
