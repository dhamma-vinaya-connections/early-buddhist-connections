# AN4.118 Inspiring

> **Division:** II. KESI

“Bhikkhus, these four inspiring places should be seen by a clansman endowed with faith. What four? (1) The place where the Tathāgata was born is an inspiring place that should be seen by a clansman endowed with faith. (2) The place where the Tathāgata awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment is an inspiring place that should be seen by a clansman endowed with faith. (3) The place where the Tathāgata set in motion the unsurpassed wheel of the Dhamma is an inspiring place that should be seen by a clansman endowed with faith. (4) The place where the Tathāgata attained final nibbāna by the nibbāna element without residue remaining is an inspiring place that should be seen by a clansman endowed with faith. \[121\] These, bhikkhus, are the four inspiring places that should be seen by a clansman endowed with faith.”
