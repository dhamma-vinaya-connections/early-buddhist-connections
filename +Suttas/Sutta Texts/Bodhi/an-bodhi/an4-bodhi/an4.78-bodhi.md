# AN4.78 Offerings

> **Division:** III. UNMISTAKABLE

“Bhikkhus, there are these four purifications of offerings. What four? (1) There is an offering that is purified through the donor but not through the recipients; (2) there is an offering that is purified through the recipients but not through the donor; (3) there is an offering that is not purified through either the donor or the recipients; (4) there is an offering that is purified through both the donor and the recipients. \[81\]

(1) “And how, bhikkhus, is an offering purified through the donor but not through the recipients? Here, the donor is virtuous and of good character, but the recipients are immoral and of bad character. It is in this way that an offering is purified through the donor but not through the recipients.

(2) “And how is an offering purified through the recipients but not through the donor? Here, the donor is immoral and of bad character, but the recipients are virtuous and of good character. It is in this way that an offering is purified through the recipients but not through the donor.

(3) “And how is an offering not purified through either the donor or the recipients? Here, the donor is immoral and of bad character, and the recipients too are immoral and of bad character. It is in this way that an offering is not purified through either the donor or the recipients.

(4) “And how is an offering purified through both the donor and the recipients? Here, the donor is virtuous and of good character, and the recipients too are virtuous and of good character. It is in this way that an offering is purified through both the donor and the recipients.

“These are the four purifications of offerings.”
