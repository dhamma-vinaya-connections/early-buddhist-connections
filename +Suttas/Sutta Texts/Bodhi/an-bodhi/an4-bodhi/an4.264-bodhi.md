# AN4.264 The Destruction of Life

> **Division:** VII. COURSES OF KAMMA

“Bhikkhus, one possessing four qualities is deposited in hell as if brought there. What four? He himself destroys life; he encourages others to destroy life; he approves of the destruction of life; and he speaks in praise of the destruction of life. One possessing these four qualities is deposited in hell as if brought there.

“Bhikkhus, one possessing four \[other\] qualities is deposited in heaven as if brought there. What four? He himself abstains from the destruction of life; he encourages others to abstain from the destruction of life; he approves of abstaining from the destruction of life; and he speaks in praise of abstaining from the destruction of life. One possessing these four qualities is deposited in heaven as if brought there.”
