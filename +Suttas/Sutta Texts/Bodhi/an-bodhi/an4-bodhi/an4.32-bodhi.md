# AN4.32 Sustaining

> **Division:** IV. THE WHEEL

“Bhikkhus, there are these four means of sustaining a favorable relationship. What four? Giving, endearing speech, beneficent conduct, and impartiality. These are the four means of sustaining a favorable relationship.”

Giving, endearing speech,

beneficent conduct, and impartiality

under diverse worldly conditions,

as is suitable to fit each case: these means

of sustaining a favorable relationship

are like the linchpin of a rolling chariot.

If there were no such means

of sustaining a favorable relationship,

neither mother nor father

would be able to obtain esteem

and veneration from their children.

But since there exist these means

of sustaining a favorable relationship,

wise people respect them;

thus they attain to greatness

and are highly praised. \[33\]
