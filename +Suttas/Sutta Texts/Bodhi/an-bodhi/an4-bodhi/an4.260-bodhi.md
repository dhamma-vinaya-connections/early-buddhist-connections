# AN4.260 Thoroughbred (2)

> **Division:** VI. DIRECT KNOWLEDGE

\[All as in 4:259, with only the following difference:\] (3) “And how does a bhikkhu possess speed? Here, with the destruction of the taints, a bhikkhu has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses speed.” \[252\]
