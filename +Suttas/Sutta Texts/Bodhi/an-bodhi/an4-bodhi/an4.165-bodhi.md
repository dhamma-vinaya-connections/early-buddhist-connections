# AN4.165 Patient (2)

> **Division:** II. MODES OF PRACTICE

“Bhikkhus, there are these four modes of practice. What four? The impatient practice, the patient practice, the taming practice, and the calming practice.

(1) “And what, bhikkhus, is the impatient practice? Here, someone does not patiently endure cold and heat; hunger and thirst; contact with flies, mosquitoes, wind, the burning sun, and serpents; rude and offensive ways of speech; he is unable to bear up with arisen bodily feelings that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable, sapping one’s vitality. This is called the impatient practice.

(2) “And what is the patient practice? Here, someone patiently endures cold and heat … rude and offensive ways of speech; he is able to bear up with arisen bodily feelings that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable, sapping one’s vitality. This is called the patient practice.

(3) “And what, bhikkhus, is the taming practice? … \[as in 4:164\] …

(4) “And what, bhikkhus, is the calming practice? … \[as in 4:164\] …

“These, bhikkhus, are the four modes of practice.” \[154\]
