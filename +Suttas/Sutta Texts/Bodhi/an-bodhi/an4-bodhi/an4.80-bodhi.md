# AN4.80 Kamboja

> **Division:** III. UNMISTAKABLE

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Park. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

“Bhante, why is it that women do not sit in council, or engage in business, or go to Kamboja?”

“Ānanda, women are prone to anger; women are envious; \[83\] women are miserly; women are unwise. This is why women do not sit in council, engage in business, or go to Kamboja.”
