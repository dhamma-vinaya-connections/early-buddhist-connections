# AN4.199 Craving

> **Division:** V. THE GREAT CHAPTER

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you about craving—the ensnarer, streaming, widespread, and sticky—by which this world has been smothered and enveloped, and by which it has become a tangled skein, a knotted ball of thread, a mass of reeds and rushes, \[212\] so that it does not pass beyond the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world, saṃsāra. Listen and attend closely; I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“And what, bhikkhus, is craving—the ensnarer, streaming, widespread, and sticky—by which this world has been smothered and enveloped, and by which it has become a tangled skein, a knotted ball of thread, a mass of reeds and rushes, so that it does not pass beyond the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world, saṃsāra?

“There are, bhikkhus, these eighteen currents of craving related to the internal and eighteen currents of craving related to the external.

“And what are the eighteen currents of craving related to the internal? When there is \[the notion\] ‘I am,’ there are \[the notions\] ‘I am thus,’ ‘I am just so,’ ‘I am otherwise,’ ‘I am lasting,’ ‘I am evanescent,’ ‘I may be,’ ‘I may be thus,’ ‘I may be just so,’ ‘I may be otherwise,’ ‘May I be,’ ‘May I be thus,’ ‘May I be just so,’ ‘May I be otherwise,’ ‘I shall be,’ ‘I shall be thus,’ ‘I shall be just so,’ ‘I shall be otherwise.’ These are the eighteen currents of craving related to the internal.

“And what are the eighteen currents of craving related to the external? When there is \[the notion\], ‘I am because of this,’ there are \[the notions\]: ‘I am thus because of this,’ ‘I am just so because of this,’ ‘I am otherwise because of this,’ ‘I am lasting because of this,’ ‘I am evanescent because of this,’ ‘I may be because of this,’ ‘I may be thus because of this,’ ‘I may be just so because of this,’ ‘I may be otherwise because of this,’ ‘May I be because of this,’ ‘May I be thus because of this,’ ‘May I be just so because of this,’ ‘May I be otherwise because of this,’ ‘I shall be because of this,’ ‘I shall be thus because of this,’ ‘I shall be just so because of this,’ ‘I shall be otherwise because of this.’ These are the eighteen currents of craving related to the external.

“Thus there are eighteen currents of craving related to the internal, and eighteen currents of craving related to the external. These are called the thirty-six currents of craving. There are thirty-six such currents of craving pertaining to the past, thirty-six pertaining to the future, \[213\] and thirty-six pertaining to the present. So there are one hundred and eight currents of craving.

“This, bhikkhus, is that craving—the ensnarer, streaming, widespread, and sticky—by which this world has been smothered and enveloped, and by which it has become a tangled skein, a knotted ball of thread, a mass of reeds and rushes, so that it does not pass beyond the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world, saṃsāra.”
