# AN4.182 Guarantor

> **Division:** IV. BRAHMINS

“Bhikkhus, against four things there can be no guarantor, neither an ascetic, a brahmin, a deva, Māra, Brahmā, nor anyone in the world. What four?

(1) “There can be no guarantor, neither an ascetic … nor anyone in the world, that what is subject to old age will not grow old.

(2) “There can be no guarantor, neither an ascetic … nor any one in the world, that what is subject to illness will not fall ill.

(3) “There can be no guarantor, neither an ascetic … nor anyone in the world, that what is subject to death will not die.

(4) “There can be no guarantor, neither an ascetic … nor anyone in the world, that bad kamma—defiled, conducive to renewed existence, troublesome, ripening in suffering, leading to future birth, old age, and death—will not produce its result.

“Against these four things, bhikkhus, there can be no guarantor, neither an ascetic, a brahmin, a deva, Māra, Brahmā, nor anyone in the world.”
