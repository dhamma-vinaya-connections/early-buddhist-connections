# AN4.129 Astounding (3)

> **Division:** III. PERILS

“Bhikkhus, there are these four astounding and amazing things about Ānanda. What four?

(1) “If an assembly of bhikkhus comes to see Ānanda, they are elated when they see him. If Ānanda speaks to them on the Dhamma, they are also elated by his speech, and that assembly of bhikkhus is still unsated when Ānanda falls silent.

(2) “If an assembly of bhikkhunīs comes to see Ānanda, they are elated when they see him. If Ānanda speaks to them on the Dhamma, they are also elated by his speech, and that assembly of bhikkhunīs is still unsated when Ānanda falls silent.

(3) “If an assembly of male lay followers comes to see Ānanda, they are elated when they see him. If Ānanda speaks to them on the Dhamma, they are also elated by his speech, and that assembly of male lay followers is still unsated when Ānanda falls silent.

(4) “If an assembly of female lay followers comes to see Ānanda, they are elated when they see him. If Ānanda speaks to them on the Dhamma, they are also elated by his speech, and that assembly of female lay followers is still unsated when Ānanda falls silent.

“These, bhikkhus, are the four astounding and amazing things about Ānanda.” \[133\]
