# AN4.49 Inversions

> **Division:** V. ROHITASSA

“Bhikkhus, there are these four inversions of perception, inversions of mind, and inversions of view. What four? (1) The inversion of perception, mind, and view that takes the impermanent to be permanent; (2) the inversion of perception, mind, and view that takes what is suffering to be pleasurable; (3) the inversion of perception, mind, and view that takes what is non-self to be self; (4) the inversion of perception, mind, and view that takes what is unattractive to be attractive. These are the four inversions of perception, mind, and view.

“There are, bhikkhus, these four non-inversions of perception, non-inversions of mind, and non-inversions of view. What four? (1) The non-inversion of perception, mind, and view that takes the impermanent to be impermanent; (2) the non-inversion of perception, mind, and view that takes what is suffering to be suffering; (3) the non-inversion of perception, mind, and view that takes what is non-self to be non-self; (4) the non-inversion of perception, mind, and view that takes what is unattractive to be unattractive. These are the four non-inversions of perception, mind, and view.”

Perceiving permanence in the impermanent,

perceiving pleasure in what is suffering,

perceiving a self in what is non-self,

and perceiving attractiveness in what is unattractive,

beings resort to wrong views,

their minds deranged, their perception twisted.

Such people are bound by the yoke of Māra,

and do not reach security from bondage.

Beings continue in saṃsāra,

going to birth and death.

But when the Buddhas arise in the world,

sending forth a brilliant light,

they reveal this Dhamma that leads

to the stilling of suffering.

Having heard it, wise people

have regained their sanity.

They have seen the impermanent as impermanent

and what is suffering as suffering.

They have seen what is non-self

as non-self and the unattractive as unattractive.

By the acquisition of right view,

they have overcome all suffering. \[53\]
