# AN4.66 Lustful

> **Division:** II. WORTHY DEEDS

“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? The lustful, the hating, the deluded, and the conceited. These are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.” \[72\]

Beings enamored of tantalizing things,

seeking delight in whatever is pleasing,

low beings bound by delusion,

increase their bondage.

The ignorant go about

creating unwholesome kamma

born of lust, hatred, and delusion:

distressful deeds productive of suffering.

People hindered by ignorance,

blind, lacking eyes to see,

in accordance with their own nature,

do not think of it in such a way.
