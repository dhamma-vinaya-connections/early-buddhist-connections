# AN4.92 Concentration (1)

> **Division:** V. ASURAS

“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? (1) Here, some person gains internal serenity of mind but not the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena. (2) Some other person gains the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena but not internal serenity of mind. (3) Still another gains neither internal serenity of mind nor the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena. (4) And still another gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena. These are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.”
