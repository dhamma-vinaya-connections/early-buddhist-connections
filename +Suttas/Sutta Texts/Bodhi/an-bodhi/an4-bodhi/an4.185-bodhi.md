# AN4.185 Brahmin Truths

> **Division:** IV. BRAHMINS

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Now on that occasion a number of very well-known wanderers were residing at the wanderers’ park on the bank of the river Sappinī, that is, Annabhāra, Varadhara, Sakuludāyī, and other very well-known wanderers. Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the wanderers’ park on the bank of the river Sappinī. Now on that occasion the wanderers of other sects had assembled and were sitting together when this conversation arose: “Such are the brahmin truths, such are the brahmin truths.”

Then the Blessed One approached those wanderers, sat down on a seat that was prepared, and asked them: “Wanderers, what discussion were you engaged in just now? What was the conversation that was underway?”

“Here, Master Gotama, we had assembled and were sitting together when this conversation arose: ‘Such are the brahmin truths, such are the brahmin truths.’”

“Wanderers, there are these four brahmin truths that I have proclaimed, having realized them for myself with direct knowledge. What four?

(1) “Here, wanderers, a brahmin says thus: ‘All living beings are to be spared.’ Speaking thus, a brahmin speaks truth, not falsehood. He does not, on that account, misconceive himself as ‘an ascetic’ or as ‘a brahmin.’ He does not misconceive: ‘I am better’ or ‘I am equal’ or ‘I am worse.’ Rather, having directly known the truth in that, he is practicing simply out of sympathy and compassion for living beings.

(2) “Again, a brahmin says thus: \[177\] ‘All sensual pleasures are impermanent, suffering, and subject to change.’ Speaking thus, a brahmin speaks truth, not falsehood. He does not, on that account, misconceive himself as ‘an ascetic’ or as ‘a brahmin.’ He does not misconceive: ‘I am better’ or ‘I am equal’ or ‘I am worse.’ Rather, having directly known the truth in that, he is practicing simply for disenchantment with sensual pleasures, for their fading away and cessation.

(3) “Again, a brahmin says thus: ‘All states of existence are impermanent, suffering, and subject to change.’ Speaking thus, a brahmin speaks truth, not falsehood. He does not, on that account, misconceive himself as ‘an ascetic’ or as ‘a brahmin.’ He does not misconceive: ‘I am better’ or ‘I am equal’ or ‘I am worse.’ Rather, having directly known the truth in that, he is practicing simply for disenchantment with states of existence, for their fading away and cessation.

(4) “Again, wanderers, a brahmin says thus: ‘I am not anywhere the belonging of anyone, nor is there anywhere anything in any place that is mine.’ Speaking thus, a brahmin speaks truth, not falsehood. He does not, on that account, misconceive himself as ‘an ascetic’ or as ‘a brahmin.’ He does not misconceive: ‘I am better’ or ‘I am equal’ or ‘I am worse.’ Rather, having directly known the truth in that, he is practicing the path of nothingness.

“These, wanderers, are the four brahmin truths that I have proclaimed, having realized them for myself with direct knowledge.”
