# AN4.4 Maimed (2)

> **Division:** I. BHAṆḌAGĀMA

“Bhikkhus, behaving wrongly toward four persons, the foolish, incompetent, bad person maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition; he is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise; and he generates much demerit. What four? (1) Behaving wrongly toward his mother, the foolish, incompetent, bad person maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition; he is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise; and he generates much demerit. (2) Behaving wrongly toward his father … (3) Behaving wrongly toward the Tathāgata … (4) Behaving wrongly toward a disciple of the Tathāgata … Behaving wrongly toward these four persons, the foolish, incompetent, bad person maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition; he is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise; and he generates much demerit.

“Bhikkhus, behaving rightly toward four persons, the wise, competent, good person preserves himself unmaimed and uninjured; he is blameless and beyond reproach by the wise; and he generates much merit. What four? (1) Behaving rightly toward his mother, the wise, competent, good person preserves himself unmaimed and uninjured; he is blameless and beyond reproach by the wise; and he generates much merit. (2) Behaving rightly toward his father … (3) Behaving rightly toward the Tathāgata … (4) Behaving rightly toward a disciple of the Tathāgata … Behaving rightly toward these four persons, the wise, competent, good person preserves himself unmaimed and uninjured; he is blameless and beyond reproach by the wise; and he generates much merit.”

A person who behaves wrongly

toward his mother and father,

toward the enlightened Tathāgata,

or toward his disciple, \[5\]

generates much demerit.

Because of that unrighteous conduct

toward mother and father,

the wise criticize one here in this world

and after death one goes to the plane of misery.

A person who behaves rightly

toward his mother and father,

toward the enlightened Tathāgata,

or toward his disciple,

generates much merit.

Because of that righteous conduct

toward mother and father,

the wise praise one in this world

and after death one rejoices in heaven.
