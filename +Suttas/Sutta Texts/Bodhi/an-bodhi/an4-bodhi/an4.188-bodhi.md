# AN4.188 Upaka

> **Division:** IV. BRAHMINS

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Then Upaka Maṇḍikāputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

“Bhante, I hold such a thesis and view as this: If anyone carps against others and does not at all substantiate it, he is blameworthy and at fault.”

“If, Upaka, anyone carping against others does not substantiate it, \[182\] he is blameworthy and at fault. But you carp against others and do not substantiate it, so you are blameworthy and at fault.”

“Bhante, just as one might catch \[a fish\] emerging \[from the water\] with a large snare, just so, when I emerged, the Blessed One caught me with a large snare in debate.”

(1) “Upaka, I have proclaimed: ‘This is unwholesome.’ The Tathāgata has unlimited Dhamma teachings about this, with unlimited words and phrases, \[declaring\]: ‘For such and such reasons, this is unwholesome.’

(2) “Upaka, I have proclaimed: ‘That which is unwholesome should be abandoned.’ The Tathāgata has unlimited Dhamma teachings about this, with unlimited words and phrases, \[declaring\]: ‘For such and such reasons, that which is unwholesome should be abandoned.’

(3) “Upaka, I have proclaimed: ‘This is wholesome.’ The Tathāgata has unlimited Dhamma teachings about this, with unlimited words and phrases, \[declaring\]: ‘For such and such reasons, this is wholesome.’

(4) “Upaka, I have proclaimed: ‘That which is wholesome should be developed.’ The Tathāgata has unlimited Dhamma teachings about this, with unlimited words and phrases, \[declaring\]: ‘For such and such reasons, that which is wholesome should be developed.’”

Then Upaka Maṇḍikāputta, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s statement, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, and circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him. He then went to King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha and reported to the king his entire conversation with the Blessed One.

When he had spoken, King Ajātasattu became angry and displeased and said to Upaka Maṇḍikāputta: “How bold indeed is this salt-maker’s boy! How rude, how impudent, in that he thinks he can attack the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. Go away, Upaka, be gone! Get out of my sight!”
