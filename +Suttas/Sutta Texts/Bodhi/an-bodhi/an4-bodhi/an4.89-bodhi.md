# AN4.89 View

> **Division:** IV. UNSHAKABLE

“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? The ascetic unshaken, the white-lotus ascetic, the red-lotus ascetic, and the delicate ascetic among ascetics.

(1) “And how, bhikkhus, is a person an ascetic unshaken? Here, a bhikkhu is one of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. It is in this way that a person is an ascetic unshaken.

(2) “And how is a person a white-lotus ascetic? Here, a bhikkhu is one of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration, right knowledge, and right liberation; yet he does not dwell having contacted with the body the eight emancipations. \[90\] It is in this way that a person is a white-lotus ascetic.

(3) “And how is a person a red-lotus ascetic? Here, a bhikkhu is one of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration, right knowledge, and right liberation; and he dwells having contacted with the body the eight emancipations. It is in this way that a person is a red-lotus ascetic.

(4) “And how is a person a delicate ascetic among ascetics? Here, a bhikkhu usually uses a robe that has been specifically offered to him, seldom one that has not been specifically offered to him … \[as in 4:87\] … If one could rightly say of anyone: ‘He is a delicate ascetic among ascetics,’ it is precisely of me that one might say this.

“These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.”
