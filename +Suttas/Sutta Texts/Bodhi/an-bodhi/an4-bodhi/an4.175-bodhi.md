# AN4.175 Upavāṇa

> **Division:** III. VOLITIONAL

Then the Venerable Upavāṇa approached the Venerable Sāriputta … and said to him:

(1) “Friend Sāriputta, does one become an end-maker by means of knowledge?”

“This is not the case, friend.”

(2) “Then does one become an end-maker by means of conduct?”

“This is not the case, friend.”

(3) “Then does one become an end-maker by means of knowledge and conduct?”

“This is not the case, friend.”

(4) “Then does one become an end-maker otherwise than by means of knowledge and conduct?”

“This is not the case, friend.”

“When you are asked: ‘Friend Sāriputta, does one become an end-maker by means of knowledge?’ you say: ‘This is not the case, friend.’ When you are asked: ‘Then does one become an end-maker by means of conduct? … by means of knowledge and conduct? … otherwise than by means of knowledge and conduct?’ \[in each case\] you say: ‘This is not the case, friend.’ Then in what way does one become an end-maker?”

(1) “If, friend, one were to become an end-maker by means of knowledge, even one who still has clinging would become an end-maker. (2) If one were to become an end-maker by means of conduct, even one who still has clinging would become an end-maker. (3) If one were to become an end-maker by means of knowledge and conduct, even one who still has clinging would become an end-maker. (4) If one were to become an end-maker otherwise than by means of knowledge and conduct, then a worldling would be an end-maker; for a worldling is destitute of knowledge and conduct.

“Friend, one deficient in conduct does not know and see things as they are. One accomplished in conduct \[164\] knows and sees things as they are. Knowing and seeing things as they are, one becomes an end-maker.”
