# AN4.9 Craving

> **Division:** I. BHAṆḌAGĀMA

“Bhikkhus, there are these four ways in which craving arises in a bhikkhu. What four? Craving arises in a bhikkhu because of robes, almsfood, lodgings, or for the sake of life here or elsewhere. These are the four ways in which craving arises in a bhikkhu.”

With craving as companion

a person wanders during this long time.

Going from one state to another,

he does not overcome saṃsāra.

Having known this danger—

that craving is the origin of suffering—

free from craving, devoid of grasping,

a bhikkhu should wander mindfully.
