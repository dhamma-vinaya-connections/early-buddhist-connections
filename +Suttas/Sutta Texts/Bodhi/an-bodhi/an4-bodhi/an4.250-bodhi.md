# AN4.250 Declarations (1)

> **Division:** V. PERILS OF OFFENSES

“Bhikkhus, there are these four ignoble declarations. What four? Saying that one has seen what one has not seen, saying that one has heard what one has not heard, saying that one has sensed what one has not sensed, saying that one has cognized what one has not cognized. There are these four ignoble declarations.”
