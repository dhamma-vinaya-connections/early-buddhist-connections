# AN4.46 Rohitassa (2)

> **Division:** V. ROHITASSA

Then when that night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, last night, when the night had advanced, the young deva Rohitassa, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said:

“‘Is it possible, Bhante, by traveling to know, see, or reach the end of the world, where one is not born, does not grow old and die, does not pass away and get reborn?’”

\[What follows is identical with 4:45, including the verses, but spoken in the first-person narrative voice.\] \[50\]
