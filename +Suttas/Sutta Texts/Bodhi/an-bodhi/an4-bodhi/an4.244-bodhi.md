# AN4.244 Offenses

> **Division:** V. PERILS OF OFFENSES

“Bhikkhus, there are these four perils of offenses. What four?

(1) “Suppose, bhikkhus, they were to arrest a thief, a criminal, and show him to the king, saying: ‘Your majesty, this is a thief, a criminal. Let your majesty impose a penalty on him.’ The king would say to them: \[241\] ‘Go, sirs, and tie this man’s arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope, shave his head, and lead him around from street to street, from square to square, to the ominous beating of a drum. Then take him out through the south gate and behead him south of the city.’ The king’s men would do as instructed and behead that man south of the city. A man standing on the sidelines might think: ‘Truly, this man must have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, punishable by beheading, insofar as the king’s men tied his arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope … and beheaded him south of the city. Indeed, I should never do such an evil deed, reprehensible, punishable by beheading.’

“So too, when a bhikkhu or bhikkhunī has set up such a keen perception of peril in regard to the _pārājika_ offenses, it can be expected that one who has never yet committed a _pārājika_ offense will not commit one; and one who has committed such an offense will make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma.

(2) “Suppose, bhikkhus, a man were to wrap himself in a black cloth, loosen his hair, put a club on his shoulder, and tell a large crowd of people: ‘Worthy sirs, I have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, punishable by clubbing. Let me do whatever will make you pleased with me.’ A man standing on the sidelines might think: ‘Truly, this man must have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, punishable by clubbing, insofar as he has wrapped himself in a black cloth, loosened his hair, put a club on his shoulder, and tells a large crowd of people: “Worthy sirs, I have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, deserving a clubbing. Let me do whatever will make you pleased with me.” \[242\] Indeed, I should never do such an evil deed, reprehensible, punishable by clubbing.’

“So too, when a bhikkhu or bhikkhunī has set up such a keen perception of peril in regard to the _saṅghādisesa_ offenses, it can be expected that one who has never yet committed a _saṅghādisesa_ offense will not commit one, and one who has committed such an offense will make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma.

(3) “Suppose, bhikkhus, a man were to wrap himself in a black cloth, loosen his hair, put a sack of ashes on his shoulder, and tell a large crowd of people: ‘Worthy sirs, I have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, punishable by a sack of ashes. Let me do whatever will make you pleased with me.’ A man standing on the sidelines might think: ‘Truly, this man must have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, punishable by a sack of ashes, insofar as he has wrapped himself in a black cloth, loosened his hair, put a sack of ashes on his shoulder, and tells a large crowd of people: “Worthy sirs, I have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, punishable by a sack of ashes. Let me do whatever will make you pleased with me.” Indeed, I should never do such an evil deed, reprehensible, \[to be punished with\] a sack of ashes.’

“So too, when a bhikkhu or bhikkhunī has set up such a keen perception of peril in regard to the _pācittiya_ offenses, it can be expected that one who has never yet committed a _pācittiya_ offense will not commit one, and one who has committed such an offense will make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma.

(4) “Suppose, bhikkhus, a man were to wrap himself in a black cloth, loosen his hair, and tell a large crowd of people: ‘Worthy sirs, I have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, censurable. Let me do whatever will make you pleased with me.’ A man standing on the sidelines might think: ‘Truly, this man must have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, censurable, insofar as he has wrapped himself in a black cloth, loosened his hair, and tells a large crowd of people: \[243\] “Worthy sirs, I have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, censurable. Let me do whatever will make you pleased with me.” Indeed, I should never do such an evil deed, reprehensible, censurable.’

“So too, when a bhikkhu or bhikkhunī has set up such a keen perception of peril in regard to the _pāṭidesanīya_ offenses, it can be expected that one who has never yet committed a _pāṭidesanīya_ offense will not commit one, and one who has committed such an offense will make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma.

“These, bhikkhus, are the four perils of offenses.”
