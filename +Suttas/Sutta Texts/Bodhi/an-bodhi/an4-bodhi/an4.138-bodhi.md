# AN4.138 Retreat

> **Division:** IV. PERSONS

“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? One who has gone on retreat by body but not gone on retreat by mind; one who has not gone on retreat by body but has gone on retreat by mind; one who has not gone on retreat either by body or by mind; and one who has gone on retreat both by body and by mind.

(1) “And how, bhikkhus, has a person gone on retreat by body but not gone on retreat by mind? Here, some person resorts to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves, but there he thinks sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming. It is in this way that a person has gone on retreat by body but has not gone on retreat by mind.

(2) “And how has a person not gone on retreat by body but gone on retreat by mind? Here, some person does not resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves, but he thinks thoughts of renunciation, thoughts of good will, and thoughts of harmlessness. It is in this way that a person has not gone on retreat by body but gone on retreat by mind.

(3) “And how has a person gone on retreat neither by body nor by mind? Here, some person does not resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves, \[138\] and he thinks sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming. It is in this way that a person has gone on retreat neither by body nor by mind.

(4) “And how has a person gone on retreat both by body and by mind? Here, some person resorts to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves, and there he thinks thoughts of renunciation, thoughts of good will, and thoughts of harmlessness. It is in this way that a person has gone on retreat both by body and by mind.

“These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.”
