# AN4.64 Hell

> **Division:** II. WORTHY DEEDS

“Bhikkhus, one who possesses four qualities is cast into hell as if brought there. What four? He destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, and speaks falsely. One who possesses these four qualities is cast into hell as if brought there.”

The destruction of life, taking what is not given,

the uttering of false speech,

and consorting with others’ wives:

the wise do not praise such deeds.
