# AN4.117 Guarding

> **Division:** II. KESI

“Bhikkhus, one bent on his own welfare should practice heedfulness, mindfulness, and guarding of the mind in four instances. What four?

(1) “‘May my mind not become excited by things that provoke lust!’ One bent on his own welfare should practice heedfulness, mindfulness, and guarding of the mind thus.

(2) “‘May my mind not be full of hate toward things that provoke hatred!’ One bent on his own welfare should practice heedfulness, mindfulness, and guarding of the mind thus.

(3) “‘May my mind not be deluded by things that cause delusion!’ One bent on his own welfare should practice heedfulness, mindfulness, and guarding of the mind thus.

(4) “‘May my mind not be intoxicated by things that intoxicate!’ One bent on his own welfare should practice heedfulness, mindfulness, and guarding of the mind thus.

“Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu’s mind is not excited by things that provoke lust because he has gotten rid of lust; when his mind is not full of hate toward things that provoke hatred because he has gotten rid of hatred; when his mind is not deluded by things that cause delusion because he has gotten rid of delusion; when his mind is not intoxicated by things that intoxicate because he has gotten rid of intoxication, then he does not cower, does not shake, does not tremble or become terrified, nor is he swayed by the words of \[other\] ascetics.”
