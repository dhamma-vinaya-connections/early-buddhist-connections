# AN4.26 Deceivers

> **Division:** III. URUVELĀ

(1) “Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who are deceivers, stubborn, talkers, imposters, haughty, and unconcentrated are not bhikkhus of mine. (2) They have strayed from this Dhamma and discipline, and they do not achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline. (3) But those bhikkhus who are honest, sincere, steadfast, compliant, and well concentrated are bhikkhus of mine. (4) They have not strayed from this Dhamma and discipline, and they achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline.”

Those who are deceivers, stubborn, talkers,

imposters, haughty, unconcentrated,

do not make progress in the Dhamma

that the Perfectly Enlightened One has taught.

But those who are honest and sincere,

steadfast, compliant, and well concentrated,

make progress in the Dhamma

that the Perfectly Enlightened One has taught.
