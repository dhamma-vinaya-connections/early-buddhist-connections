# AN4.134 Effort

> **Division:** IV. PERSONS

“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? One who lives off the fruit of his effort but not off the fruit of his kamma; one who lives off the fruit of his kamma but not off the fruit of his effort; one who lives off the fruit of both his effort and his kamma; and one who lives off the fruit of neither his effort nor his kamma. These are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.”
