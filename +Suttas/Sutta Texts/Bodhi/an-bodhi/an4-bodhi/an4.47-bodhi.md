# AN4.47 Far Apart

> **Division:** V. ROHITASSA

“Bhikkhus, there are these four pairs of things extremely far apart. What four? (1) The sky and the earth. (2) The near and the far shores of the ocean. (3) The place where the sun rises and the place where it sets. (4) The teaching of the good and the teaching of the bad. These are the four pairs of things extremely far apart.” \[51\]

The sky and the earth are far apart,

the ocean’s far shore is said to be far,

and so the place where the sun rises

from the place where it sets.

But even farther apart, they say,

are the teachings of the good and the bad.

The company of the good is constant;

so long as it endures, it is just the same.

But the company of the bad is fickle;

thus the teaching of the good

is far from the bad.
