# AN4.27 Contentment

> **Division:** III. URUVELĀ

“Bhikkhus, there are these four trifles, easily gained and blameless. What four?

(1) “A rag-robe is a trifle among robes, easily gained \[27\] and blameless. (2) A lump of almsfood is a trifle among meals, easily gained and blameless. (3) The foot of a tree is a trifle among lodgings, easily gained and blameless. (4) Putrid urine is a trifle among medicines, easily gained and blameless.

“These are the four trifles, easily gained and blameless. When a bhikkhu is satisfied with what is trifling and easily gained, I say that he has one of the factors of the ascetic life.”

When one is content with what is blameless,

trifling and easily gained;

when one’s mind is not distressed

because of a lodging,

robe, drink, and food,

one is not hindered anywhere.

These qualities, rightly said

to conform to the ascetic life,

are acquired by a bhikkhu

who is content and heedful.
