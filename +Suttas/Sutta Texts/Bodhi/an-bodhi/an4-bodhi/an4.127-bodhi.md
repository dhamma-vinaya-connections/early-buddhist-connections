# AN4.127 Astounding (1)

> **Division:** III. PERILS

“Bhikkhus, with the manifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One, four astounding and amazing things become manifest. What four?

(1) “When, bhikkhus, a bodhisatta passes away from the Tusita heaven and mindfully and with clear comprehension enters his mother’s womb, then in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, a measureless glorious radiance becomes manifest, surpassing the divine majesty of the devas. Even in those world intervals, vacant and abysmal, regions of gloom and impenetrable darkness where the light of the sun and moon, so powerful and mighty, does not reach, there too a measureless glorious radiance becomes manifest, surpassing the divine majesty of the devas. Those beings who have been reborn there perceive one another by this radiance and say: ‘Indeed, it seems there are other beings who have been reborn here.’ \[131\] This is the first astounding and amazing thing that becomes manifest with the manifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One.

(2) “Again, when a bodhisatta mindfully and with clear comprehension emerges from his mother’s womb, then in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, a measureless glorious radiance becomes manifest, surpassing the divine majesty of the devas. Even in those world intervals … \[beings\] say: ‘Indeed, it seems there are other beings who have been reborn here.’ This is the second astounding and amazing thing that becomes manifest with the manifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One.

(3) “Again, when a Tathāgata awakens to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment, then in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, a measureless glorious radiance becomes manifest, surpassing the divine majesty of the devas. Even in those world intervals … \[beings\] say: ‘Indeed, it seems there are other beings who have been reborn here.’ This is the third astounding and amazing thing that becomes manifest with the manifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One.

(4) “Again, when a Tathāgata sets in motion the unsurpassed wheel of the Dhamma, then in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, a measureless glorious radiance becomes manifest, surpassing the divine majesty of the devas. Even in those world intervals, vacant and abysmal, regions of gloom and impenetrable darkness where the light of the sun and moon, so powerful and mighty, does not reach, there too a measureless glorious radiance becomes manifest, surpassing the divine majesty of the devas. Those beings who have been reborn there perceive one another by this radiance and say: ‘Indeed, it seems there are other beings who have been reborn here.’ This is the fourth astounding and amazing thing that becomes manifest with the manifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One.

“These, bhikkhus, are the four astounding and amazing things that become manifest with the manifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One.”
