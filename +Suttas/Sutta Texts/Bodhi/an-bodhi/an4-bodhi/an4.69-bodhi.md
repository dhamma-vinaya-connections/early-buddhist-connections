# AN4.69 Striving

> **Division:** II. WORTHY DEEDS

“Bhikkhus, there are these four strivings. What four? Striving by restraint, striving by abandonment, striving by development, and striving by protection.

(1) “And what, bhikkhus, is striving by restraint? Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the non-arising of unarisen bad unwholesome qualities; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. This is called striving by restraint.

(2) “And what is striving by abandonment? Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the abandoning of arisen bad unwholesome qualities; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. This is called striving by abandonment.

(3) “And what is striving by development? Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the arising of unarisen wholesome qualities; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. This is called striving by development.

(4) “And what is striving by protection? Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the maintenance of arisen wholesome qualities, for their non-decline, increase, expansion, and fulfillment by development; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. This is called striving by protection.

“These are the four strivings.”

Restraint and abandonment,

development and protection:

by means of these four strivings

taught by the Kinsman of the Sun

a bhikkhu who is ardent here

can attain the destruction of suffering.
