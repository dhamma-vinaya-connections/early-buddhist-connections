# AN11.30-981

> **Division:** III. SIMILARITY

“Bhikkhus, possessing eleven factors, a cowherd is capable of keeping and rearing a herd of cattle. What eleven? Here, (1) a cowherd has knowledge of form; (2) he is skilled in characteristics; (3) he picks out flies’ eggs; (4) he dresses wounds; (5) he smokes out the sheds; (6) he knows the watering place; (7) he knows what it is to have drunk; (8) he knows the road; (9) he is skilled in pastures; (10) he does not milk dry; and (11) he shows extra veneration to those bulls who are fathers and leaders of the herd. Possessing these eleven factors, a cowherd is capable of keeping and rearing a herd of cattle.

“So too, bhikkhus, possessing eleven qualities, a bhikkhu is capable of dwelling contemplating impermanence in the eye … \[all as above down to:\] … is capable of dwelling contemplating relinquishment in examination of phenomena …”
