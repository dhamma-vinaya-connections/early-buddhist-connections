# AN11.20 Concentration (3)

> **Division:** II. RECOLLECTION

Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:

“Friend Sāriputta, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that (1) he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth … (11) he would not be percipient of anything seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and examined by the mind, but he would still be percipient?”

\[What follows is identical to 11:18.\] \[357\]
