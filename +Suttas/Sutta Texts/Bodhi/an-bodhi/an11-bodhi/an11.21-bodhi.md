# AN11.21 Concentration (4)

> **Division:** II. RECOLLECTION

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus:

“Friends, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that (1) he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth … (11) he would not be percipient of anything seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and examined by the mind, but he would still be percipient?”

“We would come from far away, friend, to learn the meaning of this statement from the Venerable Sāriputta. It would be good if the Venerable Sāriputta would clear up the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from the Venerable Sāriputta, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind.”

“Well then, friends, listen and attend closely. \[358\] I will speak.”

“Yes, friend,” those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

\[What follows is identical to 11:19.\] \[359\]
