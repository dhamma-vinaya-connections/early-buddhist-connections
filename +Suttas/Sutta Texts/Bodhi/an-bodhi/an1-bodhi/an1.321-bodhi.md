# AN1.321

> **Division:** XVI. ONE THING

“Bhikkhus, one who encourages \[others\] in a well-expounded Dhamma and discipline, and the one whom he encourages, and the one who, thus encouraged, practices in accordance with it, all generate much merit. For what reason? Because that Dhamma is well expounded.”
