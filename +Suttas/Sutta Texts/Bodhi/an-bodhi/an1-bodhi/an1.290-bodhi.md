# AN1.290-292

> **Division:** XV. IMPOSSIBLE

(290) “It is impossible and inconceivable, bhikkhus, that a person engaging in bodily misconduct could on that account, for that reason, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world … (291) … that a person engaging in verbal misconduct could on that account, for that reason, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world … (292) … that a person engaging in mental misconduct could on that account, for that reason, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world; there is no such possibility. But it is possible that a person engaging \[in bodily misconduct … in verbal misconduct …\] in mental misconduct could on that account, for that reason, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; there is such a possibility.”
