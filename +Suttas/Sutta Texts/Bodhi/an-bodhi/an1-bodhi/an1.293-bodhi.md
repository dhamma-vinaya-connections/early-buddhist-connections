# AN1.293-295

> **Division:** XV. IMPOSSIBLE

(293) “It is impossible and inconceivable, bhikkhus, that a person engaging in bodily good conduct could on that account, for that reason, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell … (294) … that a person engaging in verbal good conduct could on that account, for that reason, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell … (295) … that a person engaging in mental good conduct could on that account, for that reason, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; there is no such possibility. But it is possible \[30\] that a person engaging \[in bodily good conduct … in verbal good conduct …\] in mental good conduct could on that account, for that reason, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world; there is such a possibility.”
