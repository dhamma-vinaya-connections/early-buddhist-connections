# AN1.151-159

> **Division:** XII. NOT AN OFFENSE

(151) “Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who explain what is an offense as no offense … (152) … a light offense as a grave offense … (153) … a grave offense as a light offense … (154) … a coarse offense as not a coarse offense … (155) … an offense that is not coarse as a coarse offense … (156) … a remediable offense as an irremediable offense … \[21\] (157) … an irremediable offense as a remediable offense … (158) … an offense with redress as an offense without redress … (159) … an offense without redress as an offense with redress are acting for the harm of many people, for the unhappiness of many people, for the ruin, harm, and suffering of many people, of devas and human beings. These bhikkhus generate much demerit and cause this good Dhamma to disappear.”
