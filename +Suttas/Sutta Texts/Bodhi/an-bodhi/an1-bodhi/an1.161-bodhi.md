# AN1.161-169

> **Division:** XII. NOT AN OFFENSE

(161) “Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who explain an offense as an offense … (162) … a light offense as a light offense … (163) … a grave offense as a grave offense … (164) … a coarse offense as a coarse offense … (165) … an offense that is not coarse as not a coarse offense … (166) … a remediable offense as a remediable offense … (167) … an irremediable offense as an irremediable offense … (168) … an offense with redress as an offense with redress … (169) … an offense without redress as an offense without redress are acting for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, of devas and humans. These bhikkhus generate much merit and sustain this good Dhamma.” \[22\]
