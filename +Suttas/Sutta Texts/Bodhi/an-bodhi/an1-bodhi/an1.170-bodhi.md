# AN1.170

> **Division:** XIII. ONE PERSON

“Bhikkhus, there is one person who arises in the world for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and human beings. Who is that one person? The Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. This is that one person who arises in the world … for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and human beings.”
