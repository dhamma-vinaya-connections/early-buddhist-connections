# AN1.271-276

> **Division:** XV. IMPOSSIBLE

(271) “It is impossible and inconceivable, bhikkhus, that a person accomplished in view could deprive his mother of life … (272) that a person accomplished in view could deprive his father of life … (273) that a person accomplished in view could deprive an arahant of life … (274) that a person accomplished in view could, with a mind of hatred, shed the blood of the Tathāgatha … (275) that a person accomplished in view could create a schism in the Saṅgha … (276) that a person accomplished in view could acknowledge someone other \[than the Buddha\] as teacher; there is no such possibility. But it is possible that a worldling could acknowledge someone other \[than the Buddha\] as teacher; there is such a possibility.”
