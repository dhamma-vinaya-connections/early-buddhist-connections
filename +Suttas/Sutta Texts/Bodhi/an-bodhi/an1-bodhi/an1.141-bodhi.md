# AN1.141-149

> **Division:** XI. NON-DHAMMA

(141) “Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who explain Dhamma as Dhamma … (142) … non-discipline as non-discipline … (143) … discipline as discipline … (144) … what has not been stated and uttered by the Tathāgata as not having been stated and uttered by him … (145) … what has been stated and uttered by the Tathāgata as having been stated and uttered by him … \[20\] (146) … what has not been practiced by the Tathāgata as not having been practiced by him … (147) … what has been practiced by the Tathāgata as having been practiced by him … (148) … what has not been prescribed by the Tathāgata as not having been prescribed by him … (149) … what has been prescribed by the Tathāgata as having been prescribed by him are acting for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, of devas and human beings. These bhikkhus generate much merit and sustain this good Dhamma.”
