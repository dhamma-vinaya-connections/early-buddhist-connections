# AN1.313

> **Division:** XVI. ONE THING

“Bhikkhus, I do not see even a single thing \[32\] on account of which, with the breakup of the body, after death, beings are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world, so much as right view. Possessing right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, beings are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.”
