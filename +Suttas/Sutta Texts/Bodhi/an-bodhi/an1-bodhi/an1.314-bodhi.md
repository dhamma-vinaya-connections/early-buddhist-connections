# AN1.314

> **Division:** XVI. ONE THING

“Bhikkhus, for a person of wrong view, whatever bodily kamma, verbal kamma, and mental kamma he instigates and undertakes in accordance with that view, and whatever his volition, yearning, inclination, and volitional activities, all lead to what is unwished for, undesired, and disagreeable, to harm and suffering. For what reason? Because the view is bad.

“Suppose, bhikkhus, a seed of neem, bitter cucumber, or bitter gourd were planted in moist soil. Whatever nutrients it takes up from the soil and from the water would all lead to its bitter, pungent, and disagreeable flavor. For what reason? Because the seed is bad. So too, for a person of wrong view … all lead to what is unwished for, undesired, and disagreeable, to harm and suffering. For what reason? Because the view is bad.”
