# AN1.160

> **Division:** XII. NOT AN OFFENSE

“Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who explain what is no offense as no offense are acting for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, of devas and humans. These bhikkhus generate much merit and sustain this good Dhamma.”
