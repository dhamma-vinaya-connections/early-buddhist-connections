# AN1.320

> **Division:** XVI. ONE THING

“Bhikkhus, one who encourages \[others\] in a badly expounded Dhamma and discipline, and the one whom he encourages, and the one who, thus encouraged, practices in accordance with it, all generate much demerit. For what reason? Because that Dhamma is badly expounded.”
