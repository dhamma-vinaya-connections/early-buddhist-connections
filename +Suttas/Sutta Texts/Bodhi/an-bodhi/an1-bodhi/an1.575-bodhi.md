# AN1.575

> **Division:** XIX. MINDFULNESS DIRECTED TO THE BODY

“Bhikkhus, even as one who encompasses with his mind the great ocean includes thereby all the streams that run into the ocean, just so, whoever develops and cultivates mindfulness directed to the body includes all wholesome qualities that pertain to true knowledge.”### 576-582

Bhikkhus, one thing, when developed and cultivated, (576) leads to a strong sense of urgency … (577) leads to great good … (578) leads to great security from bondage … (579) leads to mindfulness and clear comprehension … (580) leads to the attainment of knowledge and vision … (581) leads to a pleasant dwelling in this very life … (582) leads to realization of the fruit of knowledge and liberation. What is that one thing? Mindfulness directed to the body. This is the one thing that, when developed and cultivated, leads to realization of the fruit of knowledge and liberation.”
