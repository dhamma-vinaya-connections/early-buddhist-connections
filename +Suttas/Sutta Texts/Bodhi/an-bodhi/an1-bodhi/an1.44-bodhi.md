# AN1.44

> **Division:** V. A SPIKE

“Here, bhikkhus, having encompassed a mentally placid person’s mind with my own mind, I understand that if \[9\] this person were to die at this time, he would be deposited in heaven as if brought there. For what reason? Because his mind is placid. It is because of mental placidity that with the breakup of the body, after death, some beings here are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.”
