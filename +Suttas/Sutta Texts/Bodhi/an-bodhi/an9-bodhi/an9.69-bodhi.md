# AN9.69 Miserliness

> **Division:** II. ESTABLISHMENTS OF MINDFULNESS

“Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of miserliness. What five? Miserliness with regard to dwellings, miserliness with regard to families, miserliness with regard to gains, miserliness with regard to praise, and miserliness with regard to the Dhamma. These are the five kinds of miserliness …. These four establishments of mindfulness are to be developed for abandoning these five kinds of miserliness.” \[460\]
