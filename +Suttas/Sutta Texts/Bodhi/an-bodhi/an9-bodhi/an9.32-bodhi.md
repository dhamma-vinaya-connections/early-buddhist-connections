# AN9.32 Dwellings (1)

> **Division:** IV. THE GREAT CHAPTER

“Bhikkhus, there are these nine progressive dwellings. What nine? (1) Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. (2) With the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. (3) With the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: ‘He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.’ (4) With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity.

(5) “With the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, \[perceiving\] ‘space is infinite,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space. (6) By completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, \[perceiving\] ‘consciousness is infinite,’ he enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness. (7) By completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, \[perceiving\] ‘there is nothing,’ he enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. (8) By completely surmounting the base of nothingness, he enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. (9) By completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, he enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling. These, bhikkhus, are the nine progressive dwellings.”
