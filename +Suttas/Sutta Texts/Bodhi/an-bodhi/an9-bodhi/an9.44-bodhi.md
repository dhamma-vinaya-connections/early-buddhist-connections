# AN9.44 Wisdom

> **Division:** V. SIMILARITY

“It is said, friend, ‘liberated by wisdom, liberated by wisdom.’ In what way has the Blessed One spoken of one liberated by wisdom?”

(1) “Here, friend, secluded from sensual pleasures … a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna … and he understands it with wisdom. To this extent the Blessed One has spoken of one liberated by wisdom in a provisional sense.

(2)–(4) “Again, friend, with the subsiding of thought and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna … the third jhāna … the fourth jhāna … and he understands it with wisdom. To this extent, too, the Blessed One has spoken of one liberated by wisdom in a provisional sense.

(5)–(8) “Again, friend, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, \[perceiving\] ‘space is infinite,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space … the base of the infinity of consciousness … the base of nothingness … the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; and he understands it with wisdom. To this extent, too, the Blessed One has spoken of one liberated by wisdom in a provisional sense. \[453\]

(9) “Again, friend, by completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling, and having seen with wisdom, his taints are utterly destroyed; and he understands it with wisdom. To this extent, friend, the Blessed One has spoken of one liberated by wisdom in a non-provisional sense.”
