# AN9.73 The Training

> **Division:** III. RIGHT STRIVINGS

“Bhikkhus, there are these five setbacks in the training. What five? (1) The destruction of life, (2) taking what is not given, (3) sexual misconduct, (4) false speech, and (5) \[indulging in\] liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. These are the five setbacks in the training. The four right strivings are to be developed for abandoning these five setbacks in the training. What four? Here, (6) a bhikkhu generates desire for the non-arising of unarisen bad unwholesome qualities; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. (7) He generates desire for the abandoning of arisen bad unwholesome qualities; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. (8) He generates desire for the arising of unarisen wholesome qualities; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. (9) He generates desire for the maintenance of arisen wholesome qualities, for their non-decline, increase, expansion, and fulfillment by development; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. These four right strivings are to be developed for abandoning these five setbacks in the training.”
