# AN9.2 Support

> **Division:** I. ENLIGHTENMENT

Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: “It is said, Bhante: ‘Equipped with supports, equipped with supports.’ In what way is a bhikkhu equipped with supports?”

(1) “If, bhikkhu, supported by faith, a bhikkhu abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome, the unwholesome is indeed abandoned by him. (2) If, supported by a sense of moral shame … (3) … supported by moral dread … (4) … supported by energy … (5) … supported by wisdom, a bhikkhu abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome, that unwholesome is indeed abandoned by him. \[354\] A bhikkhu has abandoned and well abandoned the unwholesome when he has abandoned it by seeing it with noble wisdom.

“Basing himself on these five things, that bhikkhu should rely on four things. What four? Here, (6) having reflected, a bhikkhu uses some things; (7) having reflected, he patiently endures some things; (8) having reflected, he avoids some things; and (9) having reflected, he dispels some things.

“It is in this way, bhikkhu, that a bhikkhu is equipped with supports.”
