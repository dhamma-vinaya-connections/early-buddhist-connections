# AN9.14 Samiddhi

> **Division:** II. THE LION’S ROAR

Then the Venerable Samiddhi approached the Venerable Sāriputta, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Venerable Sāriputta then said to him:

(1) “On what basis, Samiddhi, do intentions and thoughts arise in a person?”

“On the basis of name-and-form, Bhante.”

(2) “Where do they become diversified?”

“In relation to the elements.”

(3) “From what do they originate?”

“They originate from contact.”

(4) “Upon what do they converge?”

“They converge upon feeling.”

(5) “By what are they headed?”

“They are headed by concentration.”

(6) “What exercises authority over them?”

“Mindfulness exercises authority over them.”

(7) “What is their supervisor?”

“Wisdom is their supervisor.”

(8) “What is their core?”

“Liberation is their core.”

(9) “In what do they culminate?”

“They culminate in the deathless.”

“When you were asked: ‘On what basis, Samiddhi, do intentions and thoughts arise in a person?’ you said: ‘On the basis of name-and-form, Bhante.’ … \[386\] … When you were asked: ‘In what do they culminate?’ you said: ‘They culminate in the deathless.’ Good, good, Samiddhi! When you were asked such questions, you answered well, but don’t become conceited because of that.”
