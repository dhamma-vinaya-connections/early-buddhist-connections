# AN9.65 Sensual Pleasure

> **Division:** II. ESTABLISHMENTS OF MINDFULNESS

“Bhikkhus, there are these five objects of sensual pleasure. What five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing; sounds cognizable by the ear … odors cognizable by the nose … tastes cognizable by the tongue … tactile objects cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing. These are the five objects of sensual pleasure …. These four establishments of mindfulness are to be developed for abandoning these five objects of sensual pleasure.”
