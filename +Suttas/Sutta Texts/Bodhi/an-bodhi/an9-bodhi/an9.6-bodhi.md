# AN9.6 Association

> **Division:** I. ENLIGHTENMENT

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: “Friends, bhikkhus!”

“Friend!” those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

“Friends, persons should be understood to be twofold: those to be associated with and those not to be associated with. Robes, too, should be understood to be twofold: those to be used and those not to be used. Almsfood … Lodgings, too, should be understood to be twofold: those to be used and those not to be used. Villages or towns should be understood to be twofold: those to be resorted to and \[366\] those not to be resorted to. Countries or regions should be understood to be twofold: those to be resorted to and those not to be resorted to.

(1) “When it was said: ‘Persons, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be associated with and those not to be associated with,’ for what reason was this said? If one knows of a person: ‘When I associate with this person, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline; and the requisites of life that should be obtained by one gone forth—robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick—are obtained with difficulty; and the goal of the ascetic life for the sake of which I have gone forth from the household life into homelessness does not reach fulfillment by development for me,’ in that case one should depart from that person any time night or day, even without taking leave of him. One should not continue to follow him.

(2) “If one knows of a person: ‘When I associate with this person, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline; but the requisites of life that should be obtained by one gone forth—robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick—are obtained without difficulty; but still, the goal of the ascetic life, for the sake of which I have gone forth from the household life into homelessness, does not reach fulfillment by development for me,’ in that case, having reflected, one should depart from that person after taking leave of him. One should not continue to follow him.

(3) “If one knows of a person: ‘When I associate with this person, unwholesome \[367\] qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase; but the requisites of life that should be obtained by one gone forth—robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick—are obtained with difficulty; still, the goal of the ascetic life, for the sake of which I have gone forth from the household life into homelessness, reaches fulfillment by development for me,’ in that case, having reflected, one should continue to follow that person. One should not depart from him.

(4) “If one knows of a person: ‘When I associate with this person, unwholesome qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase; and the requisites of life that should be obtained by one gone forth—robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick—are obtained without difficulty; and the goal of the ascetic life, for the sake of which I have gone forth from the household life into homelessness, reaches fulfillment by development for me,’ in that case one should continue to follow that person as long as one lives. One should not depart from him even if one is dismissed.

“When it was said: ‘Persons, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be associated with and those not to be associated with,’ it is because of this that this was said.

(5) “When it was said: ‘Robes, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be used and those not to be used,’ for what reason was this said? If one knows of a robe: ‘When I use this robe, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline,’ one should not use such a robe. But if one knows of a robe: ‘When I use this robe, unwholesome qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase,’ one should use such a robe. \[368\] When it was said: ‘Robes, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be used and those not to be used,’ it is because of this that this was said.

(6) “When it was said: ‘Almsfood, friends, should be understood to be twofold: that to be used and that not to be used,’ for what reason was this said? If one knows of some almsfood: ‘When I use this almsfood, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline,’ one should not use such almsfood. But if one knows of some almsfood: ‘When I use this almsfood, unwholesome qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase,’ one should use such almsfood. When it was said: ‘Almsfood, friends, should be understood to be twofold: that to be used and that not to be used,’ it is because of this that this was said.

(7) “When it was said: ‘Lodgings, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be used and those not to be used,’ for what reason was this said? If one knows of a lodging: ‘When I use this lodging, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline,’ one should not use such a lodging. But if one knows of a lodging: ‘When I use this lodging, unwholesome qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase,’ one should use such a lodging. When it was said: ‘Lodgings, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be used and those not to be used,’ it is because of this that this was said.

(8) “When it was said: ‘Villages or towns, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be resorted to and those not to be resorted to,’ for what reason was this said? If one knows of a village or town: ‘When I resort to this village or town, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline,’ one should not resort to such a village or town. But if one knows of a village or town: ‘When I resort to this village \[369\] or town, unwholesome qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase,’ one should resort to such a village or town. When it was said: ‘Villages or towns, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be resorted to and those not to be resorted to,’ it is because of this that this was said.

(9) “When it was said: ‘Countries or regions, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be resorted to and those not to be resorted to,’ for what reason was this said? If one knows of a country or region: ‘When I resort to this country or region, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline,’ one should not resort to such a country or region. But if one knows of a country or region: ‘When I resort to this country or region, unwholesome qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase,’ one should resort to such a country or region. When it was said: ‘Countries or regions, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be resorted to and those not to be resorted to,’ it is because of this that this was said.”
