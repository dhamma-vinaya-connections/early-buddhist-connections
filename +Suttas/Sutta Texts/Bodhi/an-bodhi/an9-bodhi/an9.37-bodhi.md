# AN9.37

> **Division:** IV. THE GREAT CHAPTER

On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Kosambi in Ghosita’s Park. There the Venerable Ānanda addressed the bhikkhus: “Friends, bhikkhus!”

“Friend!” those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Ānanda said this:

“It’s astounding and amazing, friends, that the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, who knows and sees, has discovered the achievement of an opening in the midst of confinement: for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna. (1) The eye itself as well as those forms will actually be present, \[427\] and yet one will not experience that base. (2) The ear itself as well as those sounds will actually be present, and yet one will not experience that base. (3) The nose itself as well as those odors will actually be present, and yet one will not experience that base. (4) The tongue itself as well as those tastes will actually be present, and yet one will not experience that base. (5) The body itself as well as those tactile objects will actually be present, and yet one will not experience that base.”

When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī said this to the Venerable Ānanda: “Is it, friend Ānanda, while one is actually percipient or while one is non-percipient that one does not experience that base?”

“It is, friend, while one is actually percipient that one does not experience that base, not while one is non-percipient.”

“But, friend, of what is one percipient when one does not experience that base?”

(6) “Here, friend, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, \[perceiving\] ‘space is infinite,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space. When one is thus percipient one does not experience that base.

(7) “Again, friend, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, \[perceiving\] ‘consciousness is infinite,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness. When one is thus percipient one does not experience that base.

(8) “Again, friend, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, \[perceiving\] ‘there is nothing,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. When one is thus percipient one does not experience that base.

“Once, friend, I was dwelling at Sāketa in the deer park at Añjana Grove. Then the bhikkhunī Jaṭilagāhiyā \[428\] approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said: ‘Bhante Ānanda, the concentration that does not lean forward and does not bend back, and that is not reined in and checked by forcefully suppressing \[the defilements\]—by being liberated, it is steady; by being steady, it is content; by being content, one is not agitated. Bhante Ānanda, what did the Blessed One say this concentration has as its fruit?’

(9) “When she asked me this, I replied: ‘Sister, the concentration that does not lean forward and does not bend back, and that is not reined in and checked by forcefully suppressing \[the defilements\]—by being liberated, it is steady; by being steady, it is content; by being content, one is not agitated. The Blessed One said this concentration has final knowledge as its fruit.’ When one is thus percipient too, friend, one does not experience that base.”
