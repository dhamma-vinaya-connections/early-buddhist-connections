# AN9.39 The Devas

> **Division:** IV. THE GREAT CHAPTER

“Bhikkhus, in the past a battle was fought between the devas and the asuras. In that battle, the asuras were victorious and the devas were defeated. Defeated, the devas fled north, pursued by the asuras. Then it occurred to the devas: ‘The asuras are still pursuing us. Let’s engage them in battle a second time.’ A second time the devas fought a battle with the asuras, and a second time the asuras were victorious and the devas were defeated. Defeated, the devas fled north, pursued by the asuras. Then it occurred to the devas: ‘The asuras are still pursuing us. Let’s engage them in battle a third time.’ A third time the devas fought a battle with the asuras, and a third time the asuras were victorious and the devas were defeated. Defeated and frightened, the devas entered their city.

“After the devas had entered their city, it occurred to them: ‘Now we’re \[433\] secure from danger and the asuras cannot do anything to us.’ It also occurred to the asuras: ‘Now the devas are secure from danger and we cannot do anything to them.’

“In the past, bhikkhus, a battle was fought between the devas and the asuras. In that battle, the devas were victorious and the asuras were defeated. Defeated, the asuras fled south, pursued by the devas. Then it occurred to the asuras: ‘The devas are still pursuing us. Let’s engage them in battle a second time.’ A second time the asuras fought a battle with the devas, and a second time the devas were victorious and the asuras were defeated. Defeated, the asuras fled south, pursued by the devas. Then it occurred to the asuras: ‘The devas are still pursuing us. Let’s engage them in battle a third time.’ A third time the asuras fought a battle with the devas, and a third time the devas were victorious and the asuras were defeated. Defeated and frightened, the asuras entered their city.

“After the asuras had entered their city, it occurred to them: ‘Now we’re secure from danger and the devas cannot do anything to us.’ It also occurred to the devas: ‘Now the asuras are secure from danger and we cannot do anything to them.’

(1) “So too, bhikkhus, when, secluded from sensual pleasures … a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna … on that occasion it occurs to the bhikkhu: ‘Now I am secure from danger \[434\] and Māra cannot do anything to me.’ It also occurs to Māra the Evil One: ‘Now the bhikkhu is secure against danger and I cannot do anything to him.’

(2)–(4) “When, with the subsiding of thought and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna … the third jhāna … the fourth jhāna … on that occasion it occurs to the bhikkhu: ‘Now I am secure from danger and Māra cannot do anything to me.’ It also occurs to Māra the Evil One: ‘Now the bhikkhu is secure from danger and I cannot do anything to him.’

(5) “When, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, \[perceiving\] ‘space is infinite,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space, on that occasion he is called a bhikkhu who has blinded Māra, put out Māra’s eyes without a trace, and gone beyond sight of the Evil One.

(6)–(9) “When, bhikkhus, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, \[perceiving\] ‘consciousness is infinite,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness …. When, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, \[perceiving\] ‘there is nothing,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of nothingness …. When, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception …. When, by completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling, and having seen with wisdom, his taints are utterly destroyed, on that occasion he is called a bhikkhu who has blinded Māra, put out Māra’s eyes, gone beyond sight of the Evil One, and crossed over attachment to the world.” \[435\]
