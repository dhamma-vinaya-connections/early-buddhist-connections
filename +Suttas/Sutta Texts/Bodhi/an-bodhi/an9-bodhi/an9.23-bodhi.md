# AN9.23 Craving

> **Division:** III. ABODES OF BEINGS

“I will teach you, bhikkhus, nine things rooted in craving. Listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“And what are the nine things rooted in craving? (1) In dependence on craving there is seeking. (2) In dependence on seeking there is gain. (3) In dependence on gain there is judgment. (4) In dependence on judgment there is desire and lust. (5) In dependence on desire and lust there is attachment. (6) In dependence on attachment there is possessiveness. (7) In dependence on possessiveness there is miserliness. (8) In dependence on miserliness there is safeguarding. (9) With safeguarding as the foundation originate the taking up of rods \[401\] and weapons, quarrels, contentions, and disputes, accusations, divisive speech, and false speech, and many \[other\] bad unwholesome things. These are the nine things rooted in craving.”
