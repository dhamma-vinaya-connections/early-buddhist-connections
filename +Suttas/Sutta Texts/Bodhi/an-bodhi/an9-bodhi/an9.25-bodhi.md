# AN9.25 Wisdom

> **Division:** III. ABODES OF BEINGS

“Bhikkhus, when the mind of a bhikkhu is well consolidated by wisdom, he is able to assert: ‘Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.’

“And how is the mind of a bhikkhu well consolidated by wisdom? (1) His mind is well consolidated by wisdom \[when he knows\]: ‘My mind is without lust.’ (2) His mind is well consolidated by wisdom \[when he knows\]: ‘My mind is without hatred.’ (3) His mind is well consolidated by wisdom \[when he knows\]: ‘My mind is without delusion.’ (4) His mind is well consolidated by wisdom \[when he knows\]: ‘My mind is not subject to infatuation.’ (5) His mind is well consolidated by wisdom \[when he knows\]: ‘My mind is not subject to animosity.’ (6) His mind is well consolidated by wisdom \[when he knows\]: ‘My mind is not subject to confusion.’ (7) His mind is well consolidated by wisdom \[when he knows\]: ‘My mind is not subject to return to sense-sphere existence.’ (8) His mind is well consolidated by wisdom \[when he knows\]: ‘My mind is not subject to return to form-sphere existence.’ (9) His mind is well consolidated by wisdom \[when he knows\]: ‘My mind is not subject to return to formless-sphere existence.’

“When, bhikkhus, the mind of a bhikkhu is well consolidated by wisdom, he is able to assert: ‘Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.’”
