# AN9.43 Body Witness

> **Division:** V. SIMILARITY

“It is said, friend, ‘a body witness, a body witness.’ In what way has the Blessed One spoken of a body witness?”

(1) “Here, friend, secluded from sensual pleasures … a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna …. He dwells having contacted that base with the body in whatever way \[it is attained\]. To this extent the Blessed One has spoken of a body witness in a provisional sense. \[452\]

(2)–(4) “Again, friend, with the subsiding of thought and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna … the third jhāna … the fourth jhāna …. He dwells having contacted that base with the body in whatever way \[it is attained\]. To this extent, too, the Blessed One has spoken of a body witness in a provisional sense.

(5)–(8) “Again, friend, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space … the base of the infinity of consciousness … the base of nothingness … the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. He dwells having contacted that base with the body in whatever way \[it is attained\]. To this extent, too, the Blessed One has spoken of a body witness in a provisional sense.

(9) “Again, friend, by completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, he enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling, and having seen with wisdom, his taints are utterly destroyed. He dwells having contacted that base with the body in whatever way \[it is attained\]. To this extent, friend, the Blessed One has spoken of a body witness in a non-provisional sense.”
