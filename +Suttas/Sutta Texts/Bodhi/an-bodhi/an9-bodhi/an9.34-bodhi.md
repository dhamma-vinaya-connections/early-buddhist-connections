# AN9.34 Nibbāna

> **Division:** IV. THE GREAT CHAPTER

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: “Friends, bhikkhus!”

“Friend!” those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

“Happiness, friends, is this nibbāna. Happiness, friends, is this nibbāna.”

When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Venerable Sāriputta: \[415\] “But, friend Sāriputta, what happiness could there be here when nothing is felt here?”

“Just this, friend, is the happiness here, that nothing is felt here.

“There are, friends, these five objects of sensual pleasure. What five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing; sounds cognizable by the ear … odors cognizable by the nose … tastes cognizable by the tongue … tactile objects cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing. These are the five objects of sensual pleasure. Any pleasure or joy that arises in dependence on these five objects of sensual pleasure is called sensual pleasure.

(1) “Here, friends, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. If, while that bhikkhu is dwelling in this way, perception and attention accompanied by sensuality occur in him, he feels it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too if that perception and attention accompanied by sensuality occur in him, he feels it as an affliction. But the Blessed One has called affliction suffering. In this way it can be understood how nibbāna is happiness.

(2) “Again, with the subsiding of thought and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna …. If, while that bhikkhu is dwelling in this way, perception and attention accompanied by thought \[416\] occur in him, he feels it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too if that perception and attention accompanied by thought occur in him, he feels it as an affliction. But the Blessed One has called affliction suffering. In this way, too, it can be understood how nibbāna is happiness.

(3) “Again, with the fading away as well of rapture … he enters and dwells in the third jhāna …. If, while that bhikkhu is dwelling in this way, perception and attention accompanied by rapture occur in him, he feels it as an affliction …. In this way, too, it can be understood how nibbāna is happiness.

(4) “Again, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain … a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna …. If, while that bhikkhu is dwelling in this way, perception and attention accompanied by the pleasure \[connected with\] equanimity occur in him, he feels it as an affliction …. In this way, too, it can be understood how nibbāna is happiness.

(5) “Again, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, \[perceiving\] ‘space is infinite,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space. If, while that bhikkhu is dwelling in this way, perception and attention accompanied by forms occur in him, he feels it as an affliction …. \[417\] … In this way, too, it can be understood how nibbāna is happiness.

(6) “Again, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, \[perceiving\] ‘consciousness is infinite,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness. If, while that bhikkhu is dwelling in this way, perception and attention accompanied by the base of the infinity of space occur in him, he feels it as an affliction …. In this way, too, it can be understood how nibbāna is happiness.

(7) “Again, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, \[perceiving\] ‘there is nothing,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. If, while that bhikkhu is dwelling in this way, perception and attention accompanied by the base of the infinity of consciousness occur in him, he feels it as an affliction …. In this way, too, it can be understood how nibbāna is happiness.

(8) “Again, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. If, while that bhikkhu is dwelling in this way, perception and attention accompanied by the base of nothingness occur in him, he feels it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too if that perception and attention accompanied by the base of nothingness occur in him, he feels it as an affliction. But the Blessed One has called affliction suffering. In this way, too, it can be understood how nibbāna is happiness. \[418\]

(9) “Again, by completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling, and having seen with wisdom, his taints are utterly destroyed. In this way, too, it can be understood how nibbāna is happiness.”
