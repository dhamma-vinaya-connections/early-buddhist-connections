# AN9.13 Koṭṭhita

> **Division:** II. THE LION’S ROAR

Then the Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:

“Now, friend Sāriputta, is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: ‘Let kamma \[whose result\] is to be experienced in this life become kamma \[whose result\] I am to experience in a future life’?”

“Certainly not, friend.”

“Then is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: ‘Let kamma \[whose result\] is to be experienced in a future life become kamma \[whose result\] I am to experience in this life’?”

“Certainly not, friend.”

“Now, friend Sāriputta, is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: ‘Let kamma \[whose result\] is to be experienced as pleasant become kamma \[whose result\] I am to experience as painful?’”

“Certainly not, friend.”

“Then is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: ‘Let kamma \[whose result\] is to be experienced as painful become kamma \[whose result\] I am to experience as pleasant ‘?”

“Certainly not, friend.”

“Now, friend Sāriputta, is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: ‘Let my kamma \[whose result\] is to be experienced when it has matured become kamma \[whose result\] I am to experience while it has not matured’?”

“Certainly not, friend.”

“Then is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: ‘Let kamma \[whose result\] is to be experienced while it has not matured become kamma \[whose result\] I am to experience when it has matured’?”

“Certainly not, friend.”

“Now, friend Sāriputta, is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: ‘Let kamma \[whose result\] is to be experienced copiously become kamma \[whose result\] I am to experience just slightly’?”

“Certainly not, friend.”

“Then \[383\] is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: ‘Let kamma \[whose result\] is to be experienced just slightly become kamma \[whose result\] I am to experience copiously’?”

“Certainly not, friend.”

“Now, friend Sāriputta, is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: ‘Let kamma \[whose result\] is to be experienced become kamma \[whose result\] I am not to experience’?”

“Certainly not, friend.”

“Then is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: ‘Let kamma \[whose result\] is not to be experienced become kamma \[whose result\] I am to experience’?”

“Certainly not, friend.”

“Friend Sāriputta, when you are asked: ‘Now, friend Sāriputta, is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: “Let kamma \[whose result\] is to be experienced in this life become kamma \[whose result\] I am to experience in a future life”?’ you say: ‘Certainly not, friend.’ And when you are asked: ‘Then is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: “Let kamma \[whose result\] is to be experienced in a future life become kamma \[whose result\] I am to experience in this life”?’ you say: ‘Certainly not, friend.’ … \[384\] … When you are asked: ‘Now, friend Sāriputta, is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: “Let kamma \[whose result\] is to be experienced become kamma \[whose result\] I am not to experience”?’ you say: ‘Certainly not, friend.’ And when you are asked: ‘Then is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: “Let kamma \[whose result\] is not to be experienced become kamma \[whose result\] I am to experience”?’ you say: ‘Certainly not, friend.’ Then for what purpose does one live the spiritual life under the Blessed One?”

“One lives the spiritual life under the Blessed One, friend, for the purpose of knowing, seeing, attaining, realizing, and penetrating what one has not known, seen, attained, realized, and penetrated.”

“But, friend, what is it that one has not known, seen, attained, realized, and penetrated?”

“‘This is suffering,’ friend, is what one has not known, seen, attained, realized, and penetrated, and it is for the purpose of knowing, seeing, attaining, realizing, and penetrating this that one lives the spiritual life under the Blessed One. \[385\] ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’ is what one has not known, seen, attained, realized, and penetrated, and it is for the purpose of knowing, seeing, attaining, realizing, and penetrating this that one lives the spiritual life under the Blessed One. This, friend, is what one has not known, seen, attained, realized, and penetrated, and it is for the purpose of knowing, seeing, attaining, realizing, and penetrating this that one lives the spiritual life under the Blessed One.”
