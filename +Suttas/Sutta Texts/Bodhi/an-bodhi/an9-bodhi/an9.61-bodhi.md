# AN9.61 Progressive Cessation

> **Division:** I. SECURITY

“It is said, friend, ‘progressive cessation, progressive cessation.’ In what way, friend, has the Blessed One spoken of progressive cessation?”

(1)–(8) “Here, friend, secluded from sensual pleasures … a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna …. To this extent, too, the Blessed One has spoken of progressive cessation in a provisional sense ….

(9) “Again, friend, by completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling, and having seen with wisdom, his taints are utterly destroyed. To this extent, friend, the Blessed One has spoken of progressive cessation in a non-provisional sense.”
