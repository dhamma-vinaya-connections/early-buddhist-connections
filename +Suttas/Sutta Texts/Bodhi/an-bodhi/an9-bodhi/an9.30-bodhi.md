(2) \[Thinking:\] ‘He is acting for my harm, but what can be done about it?’ one removes resentment. (3) \[Thinking:\] ‘He will act for my harm, but what can be done about it?’ one removes resentment. (4) \[Thinking:\] ‘He acted for the harm of one who is pleasing and agreeable to me, but what can be done about it?’ one removes resentment. (5) \[Thinking:\] ‘He is acting for the harm of one who is pleasing and agreeable to me, but what can be done about it?’ one removes resentment. \[409\] (6) \[Thinking:\] ‘He will act for the harm of one who is pleasing and agreeable to me, but what can be done about it?’ one removes resentment (7) \[Thinking:\] ‘He acted for the benefit of one who is displeasing and disagreeable to me, but what can be done about it?’ one removes resentment.
