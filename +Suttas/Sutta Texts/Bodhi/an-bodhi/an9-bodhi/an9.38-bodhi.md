# AN9.38 The Brahmins

> **Division:** IV. THE GREAT CHAPTER

Then two brahmin cosmologists approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side and said to him:

“Master Gotama, Pūraṇa Kassapa claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing and to have all-embracing knowledge and vision: ‘Whether I am walking, standing, sleeping, or awake, knowledge and vision are constantly and continuously present to me.’ He says thus: ‘With infinite knowledge, I dwell knowing and seeing the world to be infinite.’ \[429\] But Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta also claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing and to have all-embracing knowledge and vision: ‘Whether I am walking, standing, sleeping, and awake, knowledge and vision are constantly and continuously present to me.’ He says thus: ‘With infinite knowledge, I dwell knowing and seeing the world to be finite.’ When these two claimants to knowledge make claims that are mutually contradictory, who speaks truthfully and who falsely?”

“Enough, brahmins, let this be: ‘When these two claimants to knowledge make claims that are mutually contradictory, who speaks truthfully and who falsely?’ I will teach you the Dhamma. Listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, sir,” those brahmins replied. The Blessed One said this:

“Suppose, brahmins, there were four men standing in the four quarters possessing supreme movement and speed and a supreme stride. Their speed was like that of a light arrow easily shot by a firm-bowed archer—one trained, skillful, and experienced—across the shadow of a palmyra tree. Their stride was such that it could reach from the eastern ocean to the western ocean. Then the person standing in the eastern quarter would say thus: ‘I will reach the end of the world by traveling.’ Having a life span of a hundred years, living for a hundred years, he might travel for a hundred years without pausing except to eat, drink, chew, and taste, to defecate and urinate, and to dispel fatigue with sleep; yet he would die along the way without having reached the end of the world. \[430\] Then the person standing in the western quarter would say thus … the person standing in the northern quarter would say thus … the person standing in the southern quarter would say thus: ‘I will reach the end of the world by traveling.’ Having a life span of a hundred years, living for a hundred years, he might travel for a hundred years without pausing except to eat, drink, chew, and taste, to defecate and urinate, and to dispel fatigue with sleep; yet he would die along the way without having reached the end of the world. For what reason? I say, brahmins, that by this kind of running one cannot know, see, or reach the end of the world. And yet I say that without having reached the end of the world there is no making an end of suffering.

“These five objects of sensual pleasure, brahmins, are called ‘the world’ in the Noble One’s discipline. What five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing; sounds cognizable by the ear … odors cognizable by the nose … tastes cognizable by the tongue … tactile objects cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing. These five objects of sensual pleasure are called ‘the world’ in the Noble One’s discipline.

(1) “Here, brahmins, secluded from sensual pleasures … a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna …. This is called a bhikkhu who, having come to the end of the world, dwells at the end of the world. Others say thus of him: ‘He, too, is included in the world; he, too, is not yet released from the world.’ I also say thus: ‘He, too, is included in the world; he, too, is not yet released from the world.’ \[431\]

(2)–(4) “Again, with the subsiding of thought and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna … the third jhāna … the fourth jhāna …. This is called a bhikkhu who, having come to the end of the world, dwells at the end of the world. Others say thus of him: ‘He, too, is included in the world; he, too, is not yet released from the world.’ I also say thus: ‘He, too, is included in the world; he, too, is not yet released from the world.’

(5) “Again, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, \[perceiving\] ‘space is infinite,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space. This is called a bhikkhu who, having come to the end of the world, dwells at the end of the world. Others say thus of him: ‘He, too, is included in the world; he, too, is not yet released from the world.’ I also say thus: ‘He, too, is included in the world; he, too, is not yet released from the world.’

(6)–(8) “Again, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, \[perceiving\] ‘consciousness is infinite,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness …. By completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, \[perceiving\] ‘there is nothing,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of nothingness …. By completely surmounting the base of nothingness, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. This is called a bhikkhu who, having come to the end of the world, dwells at the end of the world. Others say thus of him: ‘He, too, is included in the world; he, too, is not yet released from the world.’ I also say thus: ‘He, too, is included in the world; he, too, is not yet released from the world.’

(9) “Again, by completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling, and having seen with wisdom, his taints are utterly destroyed. This is called a bhikkhu \[432\] who, having come to the end of the world, dwells at the end of the world, one who has crossed over attachment to the world.”
