# AN9.3 Meghiya

> **Division:** I. ENLIGHTENMENT

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Cālikā on Mount Cālikā. Now on that occasion the Venerable Meghiya was the Blessed One’s attendant. Then the Venerable Meghiya approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him: “Bhante, I would like to enter Jantugāma for alms.”

“You may do so, Meghiya, at your own convenience.”

Then, in the morning, the Venerable Meghiya dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Jantugāma for alms. When he had walked for alms in Jantugāma, after his meal, on returning from his alms round, he went to the bank of the Kimikālā River. As he was walking and wandering around for exercise along the bank of the Kimikālā River, the Venerable Meghiya saw \[355\] a lovely and delightful mango grove. It occurred to him: “This mango grove is truly lovely and delightful, suitable for the striving of a clansman intent on striving. If the Blessed One permits me, I will come back to this mango grove to strive.”

Then the Venerable Meghiya approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: “This morning, Bhante, I dressed, took my bowl and robe, and entered Jantugāma for alms…. \[All as above, but in the first person.\] … I thought: ‘This mango grove is truly lovely and delightful, suitable for the striving of a clansman intent on striving. If the Blessed One permits me, I will go back to that mango grove to strive.’ So if the Blessed One would permit me, I will go back to that mango grove to strive.”

“As we are alone, Meghiya, wait until another bhikkhu comes along.”

A second time the Venerable Meghiya said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, for the Blessed One there is nothing further to be done and no \[need to\] increase what has been done. But, Bhante, I have something further to be done and \[need to\] increase what has been done. If the Blessed One would permit me, I will go back to that mango grove to strive.”

“As we are alone, Meghiya, wait until another bhikkhu comes along.” \[356\]

A third time the Venerable Meghiya said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, for the Blessed One there is nothing further to be done and no \[need to\] increase what has been done. But, Bhante, I have something further to be done and \[need to\] increase what has been done. If the Blessed One would permit me, I will go back to that mango grove to strive.”

“Since you speak of striving, Meghiya, what can I say to you? You may go at your own convenience.”

Then the Venerable Meghiya rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and went to the mango grove. He entered and sat down at the foot of a tree to pass the day. Then, while the Venerable Meghiya was dwelling in that mango grove, three kinds of bad unwholesome thoughts frequently occurred to him: sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming. It then occurred to him: “This is truly astounding and amazing! I have gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness, yet I am still stalked by these three kinds of bad unwholesome thoughts: sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming.”

Then the Venerable Meghiya approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: “Here, Bhante, while I was dwelling in that mango grove, three kinds of bad unwholesome thoughts frequently occurred to me: sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming. It then occurred to me: ‘This is truly astounding and amazing! I have gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness, yet \[357\] I am still stalked by these three kinds of bad unwholesome thoughts: sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming.’”

“Meghiya, when liberation of mind has not matured, five things lead to its maturation. What five?

(1) “Here, Meghiya, a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades. When liberation of mind has not matured, this is the first thing that leads to its maturation.

(2) “Again, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. When liberation of mind has not matured, this is the second thing that leads to its maturation.

(3) “Again, a bhikkhu gets to hear at will, without trouble or difficulty, talk concerned with the austere life that is conducive to opening up the heart, that is, talk on fewness of desires, on contentment, on solitude, on not getting bound up \[with others\], on arousing energy, on virtuous behavior, on concentration, on wisdom, on liberation, on the knowledge and vision of liberation. When liberation of mind has not matured, this is the third thing that leads to its maturation.

(4) “Again, a bhikkhu has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. When liberation of mind has not matured, this is the fourth thing that leads to its maturation.

(5) “Again, a bhikkhu is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. When liberation of mind has not matured, this is the fifth thing that leads to its maturation.

“When, Meghiya, a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades, it can be expected of him that he will be virtuous, one who dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha … \[358\] … will train in them.

“When a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades, it can be expected of him that he will get to hear at will, without trouble or difficulty, talk concerned with the austere life that is conducive to opening up the heart, that is, talk on fewness of desires … on the knowledge and vision of liberation.

“When a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades, it can be expected of him that he will arouse energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities … not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities.

“When a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades, it can be expected of him that he will be wise, possessing the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering.

“Having based himself on these five things, the bhikkhu should develop further \[another\] four things. (6) \[The perception of\] unattractiveness should be developed to abandon lust. (7) Loving-kindness should be developed to abandon ill will. (8) Mindfulness of breathing should be developed to cut off thoughts. (9) The perception of impermanence should be developed to eradicate the conceit ‘I am.’ When one perceives impermanence, the perception of non-self is stabilized. One who perceives non-self eradicates the conceit ‘I am,’ \[which is\] nibbāna in this very life.”
