# AN9.72 Bondage

> **Division:** II. ESTABLISHMENTS OF MINDFULNESS

“Bhikkhus, there are these five bondages of the mind. What five?

(1) “Here, a bhikkhu is not devoid of lust for sensual pleasures, not devoid of desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving for them. When a bhikkhu is not devoid of lust for sensual pleasures, not devoid of desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving for them, his mind does not incline to ardor, effort, perseverance, and striving. Since his mind does not incline to ardor … and striving, this is the first bondage of the mind.

(2)–(5) “Again, a bhikkhu is not devoid of lust for the body, not devoid of desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving for it …. He is not devoid of lust for form, not devoid of desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving for it …. Having eaten as much as he wants until his belly is full, he is intent upon the pleasure of rest, the pleasure of sloth, the pleasure of sleep …. He lives the spiritual life aspiring for \[rebirth in\] a certain order of devas, \[thinking\]: ‘By this virtuous behavior, observance, austerity, or spiritual life I will be a deva or one \[in the retinue\] of the devas.’ When he lives the spiritual life aspiring for \[rebirth in\] a certain order of devas … his mind does not incline to ardor, effort, perseverance, and striving. Since his mind does not incline to ardor … and striving, this is the fifth bondage of the mind.

“These, bhikkhus, are the five bondages of the mind …. These four establishments of mindfulness are to be developed for abandoning these five bondages of the mind.” \[462\]
