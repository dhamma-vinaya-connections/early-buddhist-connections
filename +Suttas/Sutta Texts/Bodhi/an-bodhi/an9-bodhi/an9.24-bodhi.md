# AN9.24 Beings

> **Division:** III. ABODES OF BEINGS

“Bhikkhus, there are these nine abodes of beings. What nine?

(1) “There are, bhikkhus, beings that are different in body and different in perception, such as humans, some devas, and some in the lower world. This is the first abode of beings.

(2) “There are beings that are different in body but identical in perception, such as the devas of Brahmā’s company that are reborn through the first \[jhāna\]. This is the second abode of beings.

(3) “There are beings that are identical in body but different in perception, such as the devas of streaming radiance. This is the third abode of beings.

(4) “There are beings that are identical in body and identical in perception, such as the devas of refulgent glory. This is the fourth abode of beings.

(5) “There are beings that are non-percipient, without experience, such as the devas that are non-percipient. This is the fifth abode of beings.

(6) “There are beings that, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, \[perceiving\] ‘space is infinite,’ belong to the base of the infinity of space. This is the sixth abode of beings.

(7) “There are beings that, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, \[perceiving\] ‘consciousness is infinite,’ belong to the base of the infinity of consciousness. This is the seventh abode of beings.

(8) “There are beings that, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, \[perceiving\] ‘there is nothing,’ belong to the base of nothingness. This is the eighth abode of beings.

(9) “There are beings that, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, belong to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. This is the ninth abode of beings.

“These are the nine abodes of beings.” \[402\]
