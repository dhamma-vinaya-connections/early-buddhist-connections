# AN9.41 Tapussa

> **Division:** IV. THE GREAT CHAPTER

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Mallas near the Mallan town named Uruvelakappa. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Uruvelakappa for alms. When he had walked for alms in Uruvelakappa, after his meal, on returning from his alms round, he addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “You stay right here, Ānanda, while I enter the Great Wood to pass the day.”

“Yes, Bhante,” the Venerable Ānanda replied. Then the Blessed One entered the Great Wood and sat down to pass the day at the foot of a tree.

Then the householder Tapussa approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

“Bhante Ānanda, we laymen enjoy sensual pleasures, delight in sensual pleasures, take delight in sensual pleasures, and rejoice in sensual pleasures. Renunciation seems like a precipice to us. I have heard that in this Dhamma and discipline there are very young bhikkhus, whose minds launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, seeing it as peaceful. Renunciation, Bhante, is the dividing line between the multitude and the bhikkhus in this Dhamma and discipline.” \[439\]

“This, householder, is a subject that we should see the Blessed One about. Come, let’s go to the Blessed One and report this matter to him. We should retain the Blessed One’s explanation in mind.”

“Yes, Bhante,” the householder Tapussa replied.

Then the Venerable Ānanda, together with the householder Tapussa, went to the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: “Bhante, this householder Tapussa says: ‘Bhante Ānanda, we laymen enjoy sensual pleasures … \[and\] renunciation seems like a precipice to us …. \[But\] there are very young bhikkhus whose minds … \[are\] liberated in it, seeing it as peaceful. Renunciation, Bhante, is the dividing line between the multitude and the bhikkhus in this Dhamma and discipline.’”

“So it is, Ānanda! So it is, Ānanda!

(1) “Before my enlightenment, while I was just a bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, it occurred to me too: ‘Good is renunciation, good is solitude.’ Yet my mind did not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: ‘Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in sensual pleasures and have not cultivated that \[insight\]; I have not achieved the benefit in renunciation and have not \[440\] pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.’

“Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘If, having seen the danger in sensual pleasures, I would cultivate that \[insight\], and if, having achieved the benefit in renunciation, I would pursue it, it is then possible that my mind would launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I see it as peaceful.’ Sometime later, having seen the danger in sensual pleasures, I cultivated that \[insight\], and having achieved the benefit in renunciation, I pursued it. My mind then launched out upon renunciation and became placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I saw it as peaceful.

“Sometime later, Ānanda, secluded from sensual pleasures … I entered and dwelled in the first jhāna. While I was dwelling in this state, perception and attention accompanied by sensuality occurred in me and I felt it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too, when perception and attention accompanied by sensuality occurred in me, I felt it as an affliction.

(2) “Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘With the subsiding of thought and examination, let me enter and dwell in the second jhāna ….’ Yet my mind did not launch out upon the absence of thought and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: ‘Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon the absence of thought and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in thoughts and have not cultivated that \[insight\]; I have not achieved the benefit in the absence of thought \[441\] and have not pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon the absence of thought and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.’

“Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘If, having seen the danger in thoughts, I would cultivate that \[insight\], and if, having achieved the benefit in the absence of thought, I would pursue it, it is then possible that my mind would launch out upon the absence of thought and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I see it as peaceful.’ Then, sometime later, having seen the danger in thoughts, I cultivated that \[insight\], and having achieved the benefit in the absence of thought, I pursued it. My mind then launched out upon the absence of thought and became placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I saw it as peaceful.

“Sometime later, Ānanda, with the subsiding of thought and examination … I entered and dwelled in the second jhāna …. While I was dwelling in this state, perception and attention accompanied by thought occurred in me and I felt it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too when that perception and attention accompanied by thought occurred in me, I felt it as an affliction.

(3) “Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘With the fading away as well of rapture … let me enter and dwell in the third jhāna ….’ Yet my mind did not launch out upon the absence of rapture and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: ‘Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon the absence of rapture and become placid, settled, \[442\] and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in rapture and have not cultivated that \[insight\]; I have not achieved the benefit in the absence of rapture and have not pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon the absence of rapture and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.’

“Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘If, having seen the danger in rapture, I would cultivate that \[insight\], and if, having achieved the benefit in the absence of rapture, I would pursue it, it is then possible that my mind would launch out upon the absence of rapture and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I see it as peaceful.’ Then, sometime later, having seen the danger in rapture, I cultivated that \[insight\], and having achieved the benefit in the absence of rapture, I pursued it. My mind then launched out upon the absence of rapture and became placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I saw it as peaceful.

“Sometime later, Ānanda, with the fading away as well of rapture … I entered and dwelled in the third jhāna …. While I was dwelling in this state, perception and attention accompanied by rapture occurred in me and I felt it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too, when that perception and attention accompanied by rapture occurred in me, I felt it as an affliction.

(4) “Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘With the abandoning of pleasure and pain … let me enter and dwell in the fourth jhāna ….’ Yet my mind did not launch out upon the absence of pleasure and pain and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: ‘Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon the absence of pleasure and pain and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in the pleasure \[connected with\] equanimity and have not cultivated that \[insight\]; I have not achieved the benefit in the absence of pleasure and pain and have not pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon the absence of pleasure and pain and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.’

“Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘If, having seen the danger in the pleasure \[connected with\] equanimity, \[443\] I would cultivate that \[insight\], and if, having achieved the benefit in the absence of pleasure and pain, I would pursue it, it is then possible that my mind would launch out upon the absence of pleasure and pain and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I see it as peaceful.’ Then, sometime later, having seen the danger in the pleasure \[connected with\] equanimity, I cultivated that \[insight\], and having achieved the benefit in the absence of pleasure and pain, I pursued it. My mind then launched out upon the absence of pleasure and pain and became placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I saw it as peaceful.

“Sometime later, Ānanda, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain … I entered and dwelled in the fourth jhāna …. While I was dwelling in this state, perception and attention accompanied by pleasure \[connected with\] equanimity occurred in me and I felt it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too, when that perception and attention accompanied by pleasure \[connected with\] equanimity occurred in me, I felt it as an affliction.

(5) “Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘With the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, \[perceiving\] “space is infinite,” let me enter and dwell in the base of the infinity of space.’ Yet my mind did not launch out upon the base of the infinity of space and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: ‘Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon the base of the infinity of space and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in forms and have not cultivated that \[insight\]; I have not achieved the benefit in the base of the infinity of space and have not pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon the base of the infinity of space and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, \[444\] though I see it as peaceful.’

“Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘If, having seen the danger in forms, I would cultivate that \[insight\], and if, having achieved the benefit in the base of the infinity of space, I would pursue it, it is then possible that my mind would launch out upon the base of the infinity of space and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I see it as peaceful.’ Then, sometime later, having seen the danger in forms, I cultivated that \[insight\], and having achieved the benefit in the base of the infinity of space, I pursued it. My mind then launched out upon the base of the infinity of space and became placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I saw it as peaceful.

“Sometime later, Ānanda, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, \[perceiving\] ‘space is infinite,’ I entered and dwelled in the base of the infinity of space. While I was dwelling in this state, perception and attention accompanied by forms occurred in me and I felt it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too, when that perception and attention accompanied by forms occurred in me, I felt it as an affliction.

(6) “Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘By completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, \[perceiving\] “consciousness is infinite,” let me enter and dwell in the base of the infinity of consciousness.’ Yet my mind did not launch out upon the base of the infinity of consciousness and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: ‘Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon the base of the infinity of consciousness and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in the base of the infinity of space and have not cultivated that \[insight\]; I have not achieved the benefit in the base of the infinity of consciousness and have not pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon the base of the infinity of consciousness and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.’

“Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘If, having seen the danger in the base of the infinity of space, \[445\] I would cultivate that \[insight\], and if, having achieved the benefit in the base of the infinity of consciousness, I would pursue it, it is then possible that my mind would launch out upon the base of the infinity of consciousness and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I see it as peaceful.’ Then, sometime later, having seen the danger in the base of the infinity of space, I cultivated that \[insight\], and having achieved the benefit in the base of the infinity of consciousness, I pursued it. My mind then launched out upon the base of the infinity of consciousness and became placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I saw it as peaceful.

“Sometime later, Ānanda, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, \[perceiving\] ‘consciousness is infinite,’ I entered and dwelled in the base of the infinity of consciousness. While I was dwelling in this state, perception and attention accompanied by the base of the infinity of space occurred in me and I felt it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too, when that perception and attention accompanied by the base of the infinity of space occurred in me, I felt it as an affliction.

(7) “Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘By completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, \[perceiving\] “there is nothing,” let me enter and dwell in the base of nothingness.’ Yet my mind did not launch out upon the base of nothingness and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: ‘Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon the base of nothingness and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in the base of the infinity of consciousness and have not cultivated that \[insight\]; I have not achieved the benefit in the base of nothingness and have not pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon the base of nothingness and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.’

“Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘If, having seen the danger in the base of the infinity of consciousness, I would cultivate that \[insight\], and if, having achieved the benefit in the base of nothingness, I would pursue it, it is then possible that my \[446\] mind would launch out upon the base of nothingness and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I see it as peaceful.’ Then, sometime later, having seen the danger in the base of the infinity of consciousness, I cultivated that \[insight\], and having achieved the benefit in the base of nothingness, I pursued it. My mind then launched out upon the base of nothingness and became placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I saw it as peaceful.

“Sometime later, Ānanda, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, \[perceiving\] ‘there is nothing,’ I entered and dwelled in the base of nothingness. While I was dwelling in this state, perception and attention accompanied by the base of the infinity of consciousness occurred in me and I felt it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too, when that perception and attention accompanied by the base of the infinity of consciousness occurred in me, I felt it as an affliction.

(8) “Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘By completely surmounting the base of nothingness, let me enter and dwell in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.’ Yet my mind did not launch out upon the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: ‘Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon the base of neither-perceptionnor-non-perception and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in the base of nothingness and have not cultivated that \[insight\]; I have not achieved the benefit in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and have not pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.’

“Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘If, having seen the danger in the base of nothingness, I would cultivate that \[insight\], and if, having achieved the benefit in the base of neither-perceptionnor-non-perception, I would pursue it, it is then possible that my mind would launch out upon the base of neither-perceptionnor-non-perception and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I see it as peaceful.’ \[447\] Then, sometime later, having seen the danger in the base of nothingness, I cultivated that \[insight\], and having achieved the benefit in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, I pursued it. My mind then launched out upon the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and became placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I saw it as peaceful.

“Sometime later, Ānanda, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, I entered and dwelled in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. While I was dwelling in this state, perception and attention accompanied by the base of nothingness occurred in me and I felt it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too, when that perception and attention accompanied by the base of nothingness occurred in me, I felt it as an affliction.

(9) “Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘By completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, let me enter and dwell in the cessation of perception and feeling.’ Yet my mind did not launch out upon the cessation of perception and feeling and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: ‘Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon the cessation of perception and feeling and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and have not cultivated that \[insight\]; I have not achieved the benefit in the cessation of perception and feeling and have not pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon the cessation of perception and feeling and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.’

“Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘If, having seen the danger in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, I would cultivate that \[insight\], and if, having achieved the benefit in the cessation of perception and feeling, I would pursue it, it is then possible that my mind would launch out upon the cessation of perception and feeling and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I see it as peaceful.’ Then, sometime later, having seen the danger in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, I cultivated that \[insight\]; \[448\] and having achieved the benefit in the cessation of perception and feeling, I pursued it. My mind then launched out upon the cessation of perception and feeling and became placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I saw it as peaceful.

“Sometime later, Ānanda, by completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, I entered and dwelled in the cessation of perception and feeling, and having seen with wisdom, my taints were utterly destroyed.

“So long, Ānanda, as I did not attain and emerge from these nine attainments of progressive dwellings in direct order and reverse order, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans. But when I attained and emerged from these nine attainments of progressive dwellings in direct order and reverse order, then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with … its devas and humans. The knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘Unshakable is my liberation of mind; this is my last birth; now there is no more renewed existence.’” \[449\]
