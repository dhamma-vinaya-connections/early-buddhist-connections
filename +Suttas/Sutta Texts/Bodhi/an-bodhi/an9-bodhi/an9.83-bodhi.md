# AN9.83 The Training

> **Division:** IV. BASES FOR PSYCHIC POTENCY

“Bhikkhus, there are these five setbacks in the training. What five? (1) The destruction of life, (2) taking what is not given, (3) sexual misconduct, (4) false speech, and (5) \[indulging in\] liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. These are the five setbacks in the training. The four bases for psychic potency are to be developed for abandoning these five setbacks in the training. What four? \[464\] (6) Here, a bhikkhu develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to desire and activities of striving. (7) He develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to energy and activities of striving. (8) He develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to mind and activities of striving. (9) He develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to investigation and activities of striving. These four bases for psychic potency are to be developed for abandoning these five setbacks in the training.”
