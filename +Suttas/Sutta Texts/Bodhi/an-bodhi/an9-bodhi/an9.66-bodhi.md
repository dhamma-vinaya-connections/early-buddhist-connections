# AN9.66 Aggregates

> **Division:** II. ESTABLISHMENTS OF MINDFULNESS

“Bhikkhus, there are these five aggregates subject to clinging. What five? The form aggregate subject to clinging, the feeling aggregate subject to clinging, the perception aggregate subject to clinging, the volitional activities aggregate subject to clinging, and the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging. \[459\] These are the five aggregates subject to clinging …. These four establishments of mindfulness are to be developed for abandoning these five aggregates subject to clinging.”
