# AN9.26 The Stone Pillar

> **Division:** III. ABODES OF BEINGS

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta and the Venerable Candikāputta were dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. There the Venerable Candikāputta addressed the bhikkhus: “Friends, bhikkhus!”

“Friend!” those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Candikāputta said this: “Friends, Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus: ‘When, friends, a bhikkhu’s mind is consolidated by mind, it is fitting for him to declare: \[403\] “I understand: Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.”’”

Then the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Candikāputta: “Friend Candikāputta, it is not in such a way that Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus. Rather, Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus: ‘When, friends, a bhikkhu’s mind is well consolidated by mind, it is fitting for him to declare: “I understand: Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.”’”

A second time … A third time the Venerable Candikāputta addressed the bhikkhus: “Friends, Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus: ‘When, friends, a bhikkhu’s mind is consolidated by mind, it is fitting for him to declare: “I understand: Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.”’”

A third time the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Candikāputta: “Friend Candikāputta, it is not in such a way that Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus. Rather, Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus: ‘When, friends, a bhikkhu’s mind is well consolidated by mind, it is fitting for him to declare: “I understand: Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.”’

“And how, friend, is the mind of a bhikkhu well consolidated by mind? \[404\] (1) His mind is well consolidated by mind \[when he knows\]: ‘My mind is without lust.’ (2) His mind is well consolidated by mind \[when he knows\]: ‘My mind is without hatred.’ (3) His mind is well consolidated by mind \[when he knows\]: ‘My mind is without delusion.’ (4) His mind is well consolidated by mind \[when he knows\]: ‘My mind is not subject to lust.’ (5) His mind is well consolidated by mind \[when he knows\]: ‘My mind is not subject to hatred.’ (6) His mind is well consolidated by mind \[when he knows\]: ‘My mind is not subject to delusion.’ (7) His mind is well consolidated by mind \[when he knows\]: ‘My mind is not subject to return to sense-sphere existence.’ (8) His mind is well consolidated by mind \[when he knows\]: ‘My mind is not subject to return to form-sphere existence.’ (9) His mind is well consolidated by mind \[when he knows\]: ‘My mind is not subject to return to formless-sphere existence.’

“When, friend, a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind, even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eye, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he observes its vanishing. Even if powerful sounds cognizable by the ear come into range of the ear … Even if powerful odors cognizable by the nose come into range of the nose … Even if powerful tastes cognizable by the tongue come into range of the tongue … Even if powerful tactile objects cognizable by the body come into range of the body … Even if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he observes its vanishing.

“Suppose, friend, there was a stone pillar eight meters long. Four meters would be below ground and four meters above ground. If a violent rainstorm should then arrive from the east, it would not shake it or make it quake, \[405\] wobble, and tremble; if a violent rainstorm should then arrive from the west … from the north … from the south, it would not shake it or make it quake, wobble, and tremble. For what reason? Because the stone pillar is deep in the ground and is securely planted. So too, friend, when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind, even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eye … Even if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he observes its vanishing.”
