# AN8.17 Bondage (1)

> **Division:** II. THE GREAT CHAPTER

“Bhikkhus, a woman binds a man in eight ways. What eight? A woman binds a man by her form … by her smile … by her speech … by singing \[197\] … by weeping … by her appearance … by a present … by her touch. A woman binds a man in these eight ways. Those beings are thoroughly bound who are bound by touch.”
