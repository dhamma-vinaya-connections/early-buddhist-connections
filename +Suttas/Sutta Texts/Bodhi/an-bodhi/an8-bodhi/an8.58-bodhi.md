# AN8.58 Worthy of Offerings (2)

> **Division:** I. GOTAMĪ

“Bhikkhus, possessing eight qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What eight?

(1) “Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous…. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them.

(2) “He has learned much … and penetrated well by view.

(3) “He has aroused energy; he is strong, firm in exertion, and has not cast off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities.

(4) “He is a forest dweller, one who resorts to remote lodgings.

(5) “He has vanquished discontent and delight; he overcame discontent whenever it arose.

(6) “He has vanquished fear and terror; he overcame fear and terror whenever they arose. \[292\]

(7) “He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are dwellings in happiness in this very life.

(8) “With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.

“Possessing these eight qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.”
