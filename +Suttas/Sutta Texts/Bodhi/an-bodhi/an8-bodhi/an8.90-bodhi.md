# AN8.90 Behavior

> **Division:** IV. MINDFULNESS

“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu charged with aggravated misconduct should behave rightly with respect to eight principles. (1) He should not give full ordination; (2) he should not give dependence; (3) he should not have a novice attend upon him; (4) he should not accept an agreement to serve as an exhorter of bhikkhunīs; (5) even if he is agreed upon, he should not exhort bhikkhunīs; (6) he should not accept any agreement \[to serve as an officer\] in the Saṅgha; (7) he should not be placed in any chief position; (8) he should not give rehabilitation \[in a case\] with that root. A bhikkhu charged with aggravated misconduct should behave rightly with respect to these eight principles.”
