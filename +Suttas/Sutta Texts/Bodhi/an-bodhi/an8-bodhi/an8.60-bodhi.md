# AN8.60 Eight Persons (2)

> **Division:** I. GOTAMĪ

“Bhikkhus, these eight persons are worthy of gifts … an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What eight? \[293\] The stream-enterer, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of stream-entry … the arahant, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of arahantship. These eight persons, bhikkhus, are worthy of gifts … an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.”

The four practicing the way

and the four established in the fruit:

the eight persons among beings—

this is the foremost Saṅgha.

For people intent on sacrifice,

for living beings seeking merit,

making merit that ripens in the acquisitions,

what is given here bears great fruit.
