# AN8.27 Powers (1)

> **Division:** III. HOUSEHOLDERS

“Bhikkhus, there are these eight powers. What eight? (1) The power of children is weeping; (2) the power of women is anger; (3) the power of thieves is a weapon; (4) the power of kings is sovereignty; (5) the power of fools is to complain; (6) the power of the wise is to deliberate; (7) the power of the learned is reflection; (8) the power of ascetics and brahmins is patience. These are the eight powers.”
