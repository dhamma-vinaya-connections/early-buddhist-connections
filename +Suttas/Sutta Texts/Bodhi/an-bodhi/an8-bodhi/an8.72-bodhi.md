# AN8.72 Faith (2)

> **Division:** III. PAIRS

(1) “Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu may be endowed with faith but he is not virtuous; thus he is incomplete with respect to that factor. He should fulfill that factor, \[thinking\]: ‘How can I be endowed with faith and also be virtuous?’ But when a bhikkhu is endowed with faith and is also virtuous, then he is complete with respect to that factor.

(2) “A bhikkhu may be endowed with faith and virtuous, but he is not learned; thus he is incomplete with respect to that factor. He should fulfill that factor, \[thinking\]: ‘How can I be endowed with faith, virtuous, and also learned?’ But when a bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtuous, and also learned, then he is complete with respect to that factor.

(3) “A bhikkhu may be endowed with faith, virtuous, and learned, but he is not a speaker on the Dhamma … (4) … a speaker on the Dhamma, but not one who frequents assemblies … (5) … one who frequents assemblies, but not one who confidently teaches the Dhamma to an assembly \[316\] … (6) … one who confidently teaches the Dhamma to an assembly, but he is not one who contacts with the body and dwells in those peaceful emancipations, transcending forms, that are formless … (7) … one who contacts with the body and dwells in those peaceful emancipations, transcending forms, that are formless, but not one who, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it. Thus he is incomplete with respect to that factor. He should fulfill that factor, \[thinking\]: ‘How can I be endowed with faith … and also be one who, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it?”

(8) “But when a bhikkhu is (i) endowed with faith, (ii) virtuous, and (iii) learned; (iv) a speaker on the Dhamma; (v) one who frequents assemblies; (vi) one who confidently teaches the Dhamma to an assembly; (vii) one who contacts with the body and dwells in those peaceful emancipations, transcending forms, that are formless; and (viii) he is also one who, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it, then he is complete with respect to that factor.

“A bhikkhu who possesses these eight qualities is one who inspires confidence in all respects and who is complete in all aspects.”
