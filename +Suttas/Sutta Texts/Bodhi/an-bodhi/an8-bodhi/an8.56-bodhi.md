# AN8.56 Peril

> **Division:** I. GOTAMĪ

“Bhikkhus, (1) ‘peril’ is a designation for sensual pleasures. (2) ‘Suffering’ is a designation for sensual pleasures. (3) ‘Disease’ is a designation for sensual pleasures. (4) ‘A boil’ is a designation for sensual pleasures. (5) ‘A dart’ is a designation for sensual pleasures. (6) ‘A tie’ is a designation for sensual pleasures. (7) ‘A swamp’ is a designation for sensual pleasures. (8) ‘A womb’ is a designation for sensual pleasures.

“And why, bhikkhus, is ‘peril’ a designation for sensual pleasures? One excited by sensual lust, bound by desire and lust, is not freed from the peril pertaining to this present life \[290\] or from the peril pertaining to future lives; therefore ‘peril’ is a designation for sensual pleasures.

“And why is ‘suffering’ … ‘disease’ … ‘a boil’ … ‘a dart’ … ‘a tie’ … ‘a swamp’ … ‘a womb’ a designation for sensual pleasures? One excited by sensual lust, bound by desire and lust, is not freed from the womb pertaining to this present life or from the womb pertaining to future lives; therefore ‘a womb’ is a designation for sensual pleasures.”

Peril, suffering, and disease,

a boil, a dart, and a tie,

a swamp and a womb:

these describe the sensual pleasures

to which the worldling is attached.

Being immersed in what is enjoyable,

he again goes to the womb.

But when a bhikkhu is ardent

and does not neglect clear comprehension,

in such a way he transcends

this miserable bog;

he surveys this trembling population

that has fallen into birth and old age.
