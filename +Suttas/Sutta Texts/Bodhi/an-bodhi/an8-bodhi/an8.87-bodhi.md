# AN8.87 Almsbowl

> **Division:** IV. MINDFULNESS

“Bhikkhus, when a lay follower possesses eight qualities, the Saṅgha, if it so wishes, may overturn the almsbowl on him. What eight? \[345\] (1) He tries to prevent bhikkhus from acquiring gains; (2) he tries to bring harm to bhikkhus; (3) he tries to prevent bhikkhus from residing \[in a certain place\]; (4) he insults and reviles bhikkhus; (5) he divides bhikkhus from each other; (6) he speaks dispraise of the Buddha; (7) he speaks dispraise of the Dhamma; (8) he speaks dispraise of the Saṅgha. When a lay follower possesses these eight qualities, the Saṅgha, if it so wishes, may overturn the almsbowl on him.

“Bhikkhus, when a lay follower possesses eight qualities, the Saṅgha, if it so wishes, may turn the almsbowl upright on him. What eight? (1) He does not try to prevent bhikkhus from acquiring gains; (2) he does not try to bring harm to bhikkhus; (3) he does not try to prevent bhikkhus from residing \[nearby\]; (4) he does not insult and revile bhikkhus; (5) he does not divide bhikkhus from each other; (6) he speaks praise of the Buddha; (7) he speaks praise of the Dhamma; (8) he speaks praise of the Saṅgha. When a lay follower possesses these eight qualities, the Saṅgha, if it so wishes, may turn the almsbowl upright on him.”
