# AN8.55 Ujjaya

> **Division:** I. GOTAMĪ

Then the brahmin Ujjaya approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

“Master Gotama, I wish to go abroad. Let Master Gotama teach me the Dhamma about things that would lead to my welfare and happiness in this present life and in future lives.”

\[What follows is identical with 8:54, inclusive of the four verses, but addressed to the brahmin.\] \[286–89\]
