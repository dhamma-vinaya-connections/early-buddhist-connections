# AN8.51 Gotamī

> **Division:** I. GOTAMĪ

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Park. Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him:

“Bhante, it would be good if women could obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”

“Enough, Gotamī! Do not favor the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”

A second time … A third time Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, it would be good if women could obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”

“Enough, Gotamī! Do not favor the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”

Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, thinking: “The Blessed One does not allow the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness,” miserable and saddened, wept with a tearful face. She then paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.

Having stayed in Kapilavatthu as long as he wanted, the Blessed One set out on tour toward Vesālī. Wandering on tour, he eventually arrived at Vesālī, where he dwelled in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.

Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī had her hair cut off, put on ochre robes, and together with a number of Sakyan women, \[275\] set out toward Vesālī. Eventually, she reached Vesālī and \[went to\] the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then, with her feet swollen and her body covered with dust, miserable and saddened, weeping with a tearful face, she stood outside the entrance. The Venerable Ānanda saw her standing there in such a condition and said to her:

“Gotamī, why are you standing outside the entrance with your feet swollen and your body covered with dust, miserable and saddened, weeping with a tearful face?”

“I do so, Bhante Ānanda, because the Blessed One does not allow the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness.”

“Well then, Gotamī, you wait right here \[a moment\] while I ask the Blessed One to grant women the going forth.”

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: “Bhante, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī is standing outside the entrance with her feet swollen and her body covered with dust, miserable and saddened, weeping with a tearful face, because the Blessed One does not allow the going forth of women. Bhante, it would be good if women could obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”

“Enough, Ānanda! Do not favor the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”

A second time … A third time the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, it would be good if women could obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”

“Enough, Ānanda! Do not favor the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata.” \[276\]

Then it occurred to the Venerable Ānanda: “The Blessed One does not allow the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness. Let me ask the Blessed One for the going forth of women in some other way.”

Then the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, if a woman were to go forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, would it be possible for her to realize the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, and the fruit of arahantship?”

“It would be, Ānanda.

“If, Bhante, it would be possible for a woman to realize the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, and the fruit of arahantship, \[and considering that\] Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī had been very helpful to the Blessed One—having been his maternal aunt, wet-nurse, and foster mother who nurtured him with breast milk when his mother died—it would be good if women could obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”

“If, Ānanda, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī accepts eight principles of respect, let that itself be her full ordination.

(1) “A bhikkhunī who has been ordained for a hundred years should pay homage to a bhikkhu who has been ordained that same day, should rise up for him, reverentially salute him, and behave courteously toward him. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

(2) “A bhikkhunī should not enter upon the rains in a place where there are no bhikkhus. This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

(3) “Every half-month a bhikkhunī should ask the Saṅgha of bhikkhus about two things: about \[the day\] of the uposatha, and about coming for the exhortation. \[277\] This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

(4) “When a bhikkhunī has observed the rains, she should invite correction before both Saṅghas in regard to three things: in regard to anything seen, heard, or suspected. This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

(5) “A bhikkhunī who has committed a grave offense should observe a half-month’s penalty period before both Saṅghas. This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

(6) “A probationer who has completed two years of training in the six principles should seek full ordination from both Saṅghas. This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

(7) “A bhikkhunī must in no way insult or revile a bhikkhu. This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

(8) “From today on, Ānanda, bhikkhunīs are prohibited from admonishing bhikkhus, but bhikkhus are not prohibited from admonishing bhikkhunīs. This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

“If, Ānanda, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī accepts these eight principles of respect, let that itself be her full ordination.”

Then the Venerable Ānanda, having learned these eight principles of respect from the Blessed One, went to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī and said to her:

“If, Gotamī, you accept eight principles of respect, that itself will be your full ordination:

(1) “A bhikkhunī who has been ordained for a hundred years should pay homage to a bhikkhu who has been ordained that same day, should rise up for him, reverentially salute him, and behave properly toward him. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts….

(8) “From today bhikkhunīs are prohibited from admonishing bhikkhus, \[278\] but bhikkhus are not prohibited from admonishing bhikkhunīs. This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

“If, Gotamī, you accept these eight principles of respect, that itself will be your full ordination.”

“Bhante Ānanda, if a woman or a man—young, youthful, and fond of ornaments, with head bathed—obtains a garland of blue lotuses, jasmine flowers, or lilies, she or he would accept it with both hands and place it on top of her or his head. In the same way, I accept these eight principles of respect as not to be transgressed as long as life lasts.”

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: “Bhante, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī has accepted the eight principles of respect as things not to be transgressed as long as life lasts.”

“If, Ānanda, women had not obtained the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, the spiritual life would have been of long duration; the good Dhamma would have stood firm even for a thousand years. However, Ānanda, because women have gone forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, now the spiritual life will not be of long duration; the good Dhamma will last only five hundred years.

“Just as, Ānanda, prowling burglars easily assail those families that have many women and few men, so in whatever Dhamma and discipline women obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness, that spiritual life does not last long.

“Just as, Ānanda, when a field of hill rice has ripened, \[279\] if the bleaching disease attacks it, that field of hill rice does not last long, so in whatever Dhamma and discipline women obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness, that spiritual life does not last long.

“Just as, Ānanda, when a field of sugar cane has ripened, if the rusting disease attacks it, that field of sugar cane does not last long, so in whatever Dhamma and discipline women obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness, that spiritual life does not last long.

“Just as, Ānanda, a man might build a dyke around a large reservoir as a precaution so that the water would not overflow, so too, as a precaution I have prescribed for bhikkhunīs the eight principles of respect as things not to be transgressed as long as life lasts.”
