# AN8.70 Earthquakes

> **Division:** II. CĀPĀLA

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Vesālī for alms. When he had walked for alms in Vesālī, after his meal, on returning from his alms round, he addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “Take a sitting cloth, Ānanda. Let us go to the Cāpāla Shrine for the day’s dwelling.”

“Yes, Bhante,” the Venerable Ānanda replied and, having taken a sitting cloth, he followed closely behind the Blessed One. The Blessed One then went to the Cāpāla Shrine, sat down on the seat that was prepared for him, and said to the Venerable Ānanda: \[309\]

“Delightful is Vesālī, Ānanda. Delightful is the Udena Shrine, delightful the Gotamaka Shrine, delightful the Sattamba Shrine, delightful the Bahuputta Shrine, delightful the Sārandada Shrine, delightful the Cāpāla Shrine. Whoever, Ānanda, has developed and cultivated the four bases for psychic potency, made them a vehicle and basis, carried them out, consolidated them, and properly undertaken them could, if he so wished, live on for an eon or for the remainder of an eon. The Tathāgata, Ānanda, has developed and cultivated the four bases for psychic potency, made them a vehicle and basis, carried them out, consolidated them, and properly undertaken them. If he so wished, the Tathāgata could live on for an eon or for the remainder of an eon.”

But though the Venerable Ānanda was given such an obvious signal by the Blessed One, though he was given such an obvious hint, he was unable to pick up the hint. He did not request the Blessed One: “Bhante, let the Blessed One live on for an eon! Let the Fortunate One live on for an eon, for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans.” For his mind was obsessed by Māra.

A second time … A third time the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “Delightful is Vesālī … Delightful is the Udena Shrine … delightful the Cāpāla Shrine. Whoever, Ānanda, has developed and cultivated the four bases for psychic potency … and properly undertaken them could, if he so wished, live on for an eon or for the remainder of an eon. The Tathāgata, Ānanda, has developed and cultivated the four bases for psychic potency, made them a vehicle and basis, carried them out, consolidated them, and properly undertaken them. If he so wished, the Tathāgata could live on for an eon or for the remainder of an eon.”

But again, though the Venerable Ānanda \[310\] was given such an obvious signal by the Blessed One, though he was given such an obvious hint, he was unable to pick up the hint…. For his mind was obsessed by Māra.

Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “You may go, Ānanda, at your own convenience.”

“Yes, Bhante,” the Venerable Ānanda replied, and he rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and sat down at the foot of a tree not far from the Blessed One.

Then, not long after the Venerable Ānanda had left, Māra the Evil One said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, let the Blessed One now attain final nibbāna! Let the Fortunate One now attain final nibbāna! Now is the time, Bhante, for the Blessed One’s final nibbāna! These words were uttered, Bhante, by the Blessed One: _‘_I will not attain final nibbāna, Evil One, until there are bhikkhu disciples of mine who are competent, disciplined, self-confident, attained to security from bondage, learned, upholders of the Dhamma, practicing in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing in the proper way, conducting themselves accordingly; who have learned their own teacher’s teaching and can explain it, teach it, proclaim it, establish it, disclose it, analyze it, and elucidate it; who can thoroughly refute in reasoned ways the current tenets of others and teach the antidotal Dhamma.’ Now at present the Blessed One has bhikkhu disciples who are competent … and who can teach the antidotal Dhamma. Bhante, let the Blessed One now attain final nibbāna! Let the Fortunate One now attain final nibbāna! Now is the time for the Blessed One’s final nibbāna!

“And these words were uttered, Bhante, by the Blessed One: ‘I will not attain final nibbāna, Evil One, until there are bhikkhunī disciples of mine who are competent … until there are male lay disciples of mine \[311\] who are competent … until there are female lay disciples of mine who are competent … and teach the antidotal Dhamma.’ Now at present the Blessed One has bhikkhunī disciples … male lay disciples … female lay disciples who are competent, disciplined, self-confident, attained to security from bondage, learned, upholders of the Dhamma, practicing in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing in the proper way, conducting themselves accordingly; who have learned their own teacher’s doctrine and can explain it, teach it, proclaim it, establish it, disclose it, analyze it, and elucidate it; who can thoroughly refute in reasoned ways the current tenets of others and teach the antidotal Dhamma. Bhante, let the Blessed One now attain final nibbāna! Let the Fortunate One now attain final nibbāna! Now is the time for the Blessed One’s final nibbāna!

“And these words were uttered, Bhante, by the Blessed One: ‘I will not attain final nibbāna, Evil One, until this spiritual life of mine has become successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, well proclaimed among devas and humans.’ That spiritual life of the Blessed One has become successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, well proclaimed among devas and humans. Bhante, let the Blessed One now attain final nibbāna! Let the Fortunate One now attain final nibbāna! Now is the time, Bhante, for the Blessed One’s final nibbāna!”

\[The Blessed One said:\] “Be at ease, Evil One. It won’t be long before the Tathāgata’s final nibbāna takes place. Three months from now the Tathāgata will attain final nibbāna.”

Then the Blessed One, at the Cāpāla Shrine, mindful and clearly comprehending, let go his vital force. And when the Blessed One had let go his vital force, a great earthquake occurred, frightening and terrifying, and peals of thunder shook the sky.

Then, having understood the meaning of this, the Blessed One on that occasion uttered this inspired utterance: \[312\]

“Comparing the incomparable and continued existence,

the sage let go the force of existence.

Rejoicing internally, concentrated,

he broke his own existence like a coat of armor.”

Then it occurred to the Venerable Ānanda: “This earthquake was indeed powerful! This earthquake was indeed very powerful, frightening and terrifying, and peals of thunder shook the sky! What is the cause and condition for a powerful earthquake?”

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: “Bhante, this earthquake was indeed powerful! This earthquake was indeed very powerful, frightening and terrifying, and peals of thunder shook the sky! What, Bhante, is the cause and condition for a powerful earthquake?”

“Ānanda, there are these eight causes and conditions for a powerful earthquake. What eight?

(1) “Ānanda, this great earth is established upon water; the water rests upon wind; the wind blows in space. There comes a time, Ānanda, when strong winds blow and shake the water. The water, being shaken, shakes the earth. This is the first cause and condition for a powerful earthquake.

(2) “Again, there is an ascetic or brahmin who possesses psychic potency and has attained mastery of mind, or a deity who is very powerful and mighty. He has developed a limited perception of earth and a measureless perception of water. He makes this earth shake, shudder, and tremble. This is the second cause and condition for a powerful earthquake.

(3) “Again, when the bodhisatta passes away from the Tusita order and, mindful and clearly comprehending, enters his mother’s womb, this \[313\] earth shakes, shudders, and trembles. This is the third cause and condition for a powerful earthquake.

(4) “Again, when the bodhisatta, mindful and clearly comprehending, emerges from his mother’s womb, this earth shakes, shudders, and trembles. This is the fourth cause and condition for a powerful earthquake.

(5) “Again, when the Tathāgata awakens to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment, this earth shakes, shudders, and trembles. This is the fifth cause and condition for a powerful earthquake.

(6) “Again, when the Tathāgata sets in motion the unsurpassed wheel of the Dhamma, this earth shakes, shudders, and trembles. This is the sixth cause and condition for a powerful earthquake.

(7) “Again, when the Tathāgata, mindful and clearly comprehending, lets go his vital force, this earth shakes, shudders, and trembles. This is the seventh cause and condition for a powerful earthquake.

(8) “Again, when the Tathāgata attains final nibbāna by the nibbāna element without residue remaining, this earth shakes, shudders, and trembles. This is the eighth cause and condition for a powerful earthquake.

“These are the eight causes and conditions for a powerful earthquake.” \[314\]
