> **Division:** II. CĀPĀLA

“Bhikkhus, there are these eight ignoble declarations. What eight? (1) Saying that one has seen what one has not seen; (2) saying that one has heard what one has not heard; (3) saying that one has sensed what one has not sensed; (4) saying that one has cognized what one has not cognized; (5) saying that one has not seen what one has actually seen; (6) saying that one has not heard what one has actually heard; (7) saying that one has not sensed what one has actually sensed; (8) saying that one has not cognized what one has actually cognized. These are the eight ignoble declarations.”
