# AN8.66 Emancipations

> **Division:** II. CĀPĀLA

“Bhikkhus, there are these eight emancipations. What eight?

(1) “One possessing form sees forms. This is the first emancipation.

(2) “One not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally. This is the second emancipation.

(3) “One is focused only on ‘beautiful.’ This is the third emancipation.

(4) “With the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, \[perceiving\] ‘space is infinite,’ one enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space. This is the fourth emancipation.

(5) “By completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, \[perceiving\] ‘consciousness is infinite,’ one enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness. This is the fifth emancipation.

(6) “By completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, \[perceiving\] ‘there is nothing,’ one enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. This is the sixth emancipation.

(7) “By completely surmounting the base of nothingness, one enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. This is the seventh emancipation.

(8)“By completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, one enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling. This is the eighth emancipation.

“These, bhikkhus, are the eight emancipations.” \[307\]
