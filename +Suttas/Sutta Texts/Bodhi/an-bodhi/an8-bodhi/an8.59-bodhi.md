# AN8.59 Eight Persons (1)

> **Division:** I. GOTAMĪ

“Bhikkhus, these eight persons are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What eight? The stream-enterer, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of stream-entry; the once-returner, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of once-returning; the non-returner, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of non-returning; the arahant, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of arahantship. These eight persons, bhikkhus, are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.”

The four practicing the way

and the four established in the fruit:

this is the upright Saṅgha—

composed in wisdom and virtuous behavior.

For people intent on sacrifice,

for living beings seeking merit,

making merit that ripens in the acquisitions,

what is given to the Saṅgha bears great fruit.
