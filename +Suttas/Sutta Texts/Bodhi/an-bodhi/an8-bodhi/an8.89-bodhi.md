# AN8.89 Reconciliation

> **Division:** IV. MINDFULNESS

“Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu possesses eight qualities, the Saṅgha, if it wishes, may enjoin an act of reconciliation on him. What eight? (1) He tries to prevent laypeople from acquiring gains; (2) he tries to bring harm to laypeople; (3) he insults and reviles laypeople; (4) he divides laypeople from each other; (5) he speaks dispraise of the Buddha; (6) he speaks dispraise of the Dhamma; (7) he speaks dispraise of the Saṅgha; (8) he does not fulfill a legitimate promise to laypeople. When a bhikkhu possesses these eight qualities, the Saṅgha, if it wishes, may enjoin an act of reconciliation on him.

“Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu possesses eight qualities, the Saṅgha, if it wishes, may revoke an act of reconciliation \[previously imposed on him\]. What eight? (1) He does not try to prevent laypeople from acquiring gains; (2) he does not try to bring harm to laypeople; (3) he does not insult and revile laypeople; (4) he does not divide laypeople from each other; (5) he speaks praise of the Buddha; \[347\] (6) he speaks praise of the Dhamma; (7) he speaks praise of the Saṅgha; (8) he fulfills a legitimate promise to laypeople. When a bhikkhu possesses these eight qualities, the Saṅgha, if it wishes, may revoke an act of reconciliation \[previously imposed on him\].”
