# AN8.52 Exhortation

> **Division:** I. GOTAMĪ

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

“Bhante, how many qualities should a bhikkhu possess to be agreed upon as an exhorter of bhikkhunīs?”

“Ānanda, a bhikkhu should possess eight qualities to be agreed upon as an exhorter of bhikkhunīs. What eight?

(1) “Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu is virtuous…. \[as in 8:2 §4\] … Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them.

(2) “He has learned much … \[as in 8:2 §5\] … and penetrated well by view.

(3) “Both Pātimokkhas have been well transmitted to him in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well determined in terms of the rules and their detailed explication.

(4) “He is a good speaker with a good delivery; he is gifted with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning.

(5) “He is capable \[280\] of instructing, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening the Saṅgha of bhikkhunīs with a Dhamma talk.

(6) “He is pleasing and agreeable to most of the bhikkhunīs.

(7) “He has never before committed a grave offense against a woman wearing the ochre robe who has gone forth under the Blessed One.

(8) “He has seniority of twenty years or more.

“A bhikkhu should possess these eight qualities to be agreed upon as an exhorter of bhikkhunīs.”
