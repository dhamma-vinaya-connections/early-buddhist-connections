# AN8.16 Mission

> **Division:** II. THE GREAT CHAPTER

“Bhikkhus, possessing eight qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of going on a mission. What eight?

“Here, (1)–(2) a bhikkhu is one who listens and makes others listen; (3)–(4) he is one who learns well and makes others learn; (5)–(6) he is one who understands and communicates well; (7) he is skilled in \[knowing\] what is relevant and what irrelevant; and (8) he does not foment quarrels. Possessing these eight qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of going on a mission.

“Bhikkhus, possessing eight qualities, Sāriputta is worthy of going on a mission. What eight?

“Here, Sāriputta is one who listens and who makes others listen … he does not foment quarrels. Possessing these eight qualities, Sāriputta is worthy of going on a mission.”

One who does not tremble when he arrives

at an assembly with fierce debaters;

who does not omit words

or conceal his message;

who speaks without hesitation,

and does not waver when asked a question;

a bhikkhu like this is worthy

of going on a mission.
