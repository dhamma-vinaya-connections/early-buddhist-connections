# AN8.88 Lack of Confidence

> **Division:** IV. MINDFULNESS

“Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu possesses eight qualities, lay followers, if they wish, may proclaim their lack of confidence in him. What eight? (1) He tries to prevent laypeople from acquiring gains; (2) he tries to bring harm to laypeople; (3) he insults and reviles laypeople; (4) he divides laypeople from each other; (5) he speaks dispraise of the Buddha; (6) he speaks dispraise of the Dhamma; (7) he speaks dispraise of the Saṅgha; (8) they see him at an improper resort. When a bhikkhu possesses these eight qualities, lay followers, if they wish, may proclaim their lack of confidence in him. \[346\]
