# AN8.15 Stains

> **Division:** II. THE GREAT CHAPTER

“Bhikkhus, there are these eight stains. What eight? (1) Non-recitation is the stain of the hymns. (2) The stain of houses is lack of upkeep. (3) The stain of beauty is laziness. (4) Heedlessness is the stain of a guard. (5) A woman’s stain is misconduct. (6) Miserliness is a donor’s stain. (7) Bad unwholesome qualities are stains in this world and the next. (8) A stain graver than this is ignorance, the very worst of stains. These, bhikkhus, are the eight stains.”

Non-recitation is the stain of the hymns;

the stain of houses is lack of upkeep;

the stain of beauty is laziness,

heedlessness is the stain of a guard.

A woman’s stain is misconduct,

miserliness is a donor’s stain;

bad unwholesome qualities are stains

in this world and the next.

A stain graver than these

is ignorance, the worst of stains. \[196\]
