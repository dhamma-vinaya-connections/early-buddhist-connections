# AN8.64 Gayā

> **Division:** II. CĀPĀLA

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Gayā on Gayāsīsa. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”

“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

(1) “Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was still a bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, I perceived only a light, but I did not see forms.

(2) “It occurred to me, bhikkhus: ‘If I should perceive a light and also see forms, in such a case this knowledge and vision of mine would become even more purified.’ So on a later occasion, as I was dwelling heedful, ardent, and resolute, I perceived a light and also saw forms. Yet I did not associate with those deities, converse with them, and engage in a discussion with them.

(3) “It occurred to me, bhikkhus: ‘If I perceive a light and see forms, and also associate with those deities, converse with them, and engage in a discussion with them, in such a case this knowledge and vision of mine would become even more purified.’ So on a later occasion, as I was dwelling heedful, ardent, and resolute, I perceived a light and saw forms, and I also associated with those deities, conversed with them, and engaged in a discussion with them. Yet I did not know about those deities: ‘These deities are from this or that order of devas.’ \[303\]

(4) “It occurred to me, bhikkhus: ‘If I perceive a light and see forms, and associate with those deities, converse with them, and engage in a discussion with them, and also know about those deities: ‘These deities are from this or that order of devas,’ in such a case this knowledge and vision of mine would become even more purified.’ So on a later occasion, as I was dwelling heedful, ardent, and resolute, I perceived a light and saw forms, and associated with those deities, conversed with them, and engaged in a discussion with them, and I also knew about those deities: ‘These deities are from this or that order of devas.’ Yet I did not know of those deities: ‘After passing away here these deities were reborn there as a result of this kamma.’

(5) “… and I also knew about those deities: ‘After passing away here these deities were reborn there as a result of this kamma.’ Yet I did not know of those deities: _‘_As a result of this kamma, these deities subsist on such food and experience such pleasure and pain.’

(6) “… and I also knew about those deities: _‘_As a result of this kamma, these deities subsist on such food and experience such pleasure and pain.’ Yet I did not know of those deities: _‘_As a result of this kamma, these deities have a life span of such length.’

(7) “… and I also knew about those deities: _‘_As a result of this kamma, these deities have a life span of such length.’ Yet I did not know whether or not I had previously lived together with those deities.

(8) “It occurred to me, bhikkhus: ‘If (i) I perceive a light and (ii) see forms; and (iii) I associate with those deities, converse with them, and engage in a discussion with them \[304\]; and (iv) know about those deities: ‘These deities are from this or that order of devas’; and (v) _‘_After passing away here, these deities were reborn there as a result of this kamma’; and (vi) ‘As a result of this kamma, these deities subsist on such food and experience such pleasure and pain’; and (vii) ‘As a result of this kamma, these deities have a life span of such length’; and (viii) also know whether or not I had previously lived together with those deities, in such a case this knowledge and vision of mine would become even more purified.’

“So on a later occasion, as I was dwelling heedful, ardent, and resolute: (i) I perceived a light and (ii) saw forms; and (iii) I associated with those deities, conversed with them, and engaged in a discussion with them; and (iv) I also knew about those deities: ‘These deities are from this or that order of devas’; and (v) _‘_After passing away here, these deities were reborn there as a result of this kamma’; and (vi) ‘As a result of this kamma, these deities subsist on such food and experience such pleasure and pain’; and (vii) ‘As a result of this kamma, these deities have a life span of such length’; and (viii) I also knew whether or not I had previously lived together with those deities.

“So long, bhikkhus, as my knowledge and vision about the devas with its eight facets was not well purified, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans. But when my knowledge and vision about the devas with its eight facets was well purified, then I \[305\] claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with … its devas and humans. The knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘Unshakable is my liberation of mind; this is my last birth; now there is no more renewed existence.’”
