# AN8.84 A Thief

> **Division:** IV. MINDFULNESS

“Bhikkhus, possessing eight factors, a master thief quickly gets into trouble and does not last long. What eight? (1) He attacks one who does not attack him. (2) He steals without leaving anything behind. (3) He kills a woman. (4) He rapes a young girl. (5) He robs a monk. (6) He robs the royal treasury. (7) He does his work in his neighborhood. And (8) he is not skilled in hiding \[his plunder\]. Possessing these eight factors, a master thief quickly gets into trouble and does not last long.
