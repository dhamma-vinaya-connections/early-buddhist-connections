# AN8.85 Designations

> **Division:** IV. MINDFULNESS

“Bhikkhus, (1) ‘Ascetic’ is a designation for the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. (2) ‘Brahmin’ is a designation for the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. (3) ‘Healer’ … (4) ‘Master of knowledge’ … (5) ‘One unstained’ … (6) ‘Stainless one’ … (7) ‘Knower’ … (8) ‘Liberated one’ is a designation for the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One.”

That highest state to be attained by an ascetic,

by a brahmin who has lived the spiritual life,

to be attained by a master of knowledge and a healer—

that highest state to be attained by one unstained,

by a stainless one who is purified,

to be attained by a knower, by one liberated—

\[over that\] I am triumphant in battle;

freed, I free others from bondage.

I am a nāga, supremely tamed,

one beyond training, attained to nibbāna.
