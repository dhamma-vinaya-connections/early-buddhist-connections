# AN8.38 The Good Person

> **Division:** IV. GIVING

“Bhikkhus, when a good person is born in a family, it is for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people. It is for the good, welfare, and happiness of (1) his mother and father, (2) his wife and children, (3) his slaves, workers, and servants, (4) his friends and companions, (5) his departed ancestors, (6) the king, (7) the deities, and (8) ascetics and brahmins. Just as a great rain cloud, nurturing all the crops, appears for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, so too, when a good person is born in a family, it is for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people. It is for the good, welfare, and happiness of his mother and father … \[245\] … ascetics and brahmins.”

The wise person, dwelling at home,

truly lives for the good of many.

Day and night diligent toward

his mother, father, and ancestors,

he venerates them in accordance with the Dhamma,

recollecting what they did \[for him\] in the past.

Firm in faith, the pious man,

having known their good qualities,

venerates the homeless renouncers,

the mendicants who lead the spiritual life.

Beneficial to the king and the devas,

beneficial to his relatives and friends,

indeed, beneficial to all,

well established in the good Dhamma,

he has removed the stain of miserliness

and fares on to an auspicious world.
