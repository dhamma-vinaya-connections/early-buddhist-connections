# AN5.35 The Benefits of Giving

> **Division:** IV. SUMANĀ

“Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits of giving. What five? (1) One is dear and agreeable to many people. (2) Good persons resort to one. (3) One acquires a good reputation. (4) One is not deficient in the layperson’s duties. (5) With the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. These are the five benefits in giving.”

By giving, one becomes dear,

one follows the duty of the good;

the good self-controlled monks

always resort to one.

They teach one the Dhamma

that dispels all suffering,

having understood which

the taintless one here attains nibbāna.
