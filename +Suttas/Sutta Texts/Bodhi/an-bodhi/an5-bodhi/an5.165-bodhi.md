# AN5.165 Asking Questions

> **Division:** II. RESENTMENT

There the Venerable Sāriputta … said this:

“Friends, whoever asks another person a question does so for five reasons or for a particular one among them. What five? (1) One asks another person a question because of one’s dullness and stupidity; (2) one with evil desires, motivated by desire, asks another person a question; \[192\] (3) one asks another person a question as a way of reviling \[the other person\]; (4) one asks another person a question because one wishes to learn; (5) or one asks another person a question with the thought: ‘If, when he is asked a question by me, he answers correctly, that is good; but if he does not answer correctly, I will give him a correct explanation.’ Friends, whoever asks another person a question does so for these five reasons or for a particular one among them. Friends, I ask another person a question with the thought: ‘If, when he is asked a question by me, he answers correctly, that is good; but if he does not answer correctly, I will give him a correct explanation.’”
