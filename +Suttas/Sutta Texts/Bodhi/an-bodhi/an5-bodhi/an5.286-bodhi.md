# AN5.286 A Bhikkhu

> **Division:** II. TRAINING RULES REPETITION SERIES

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in hell as if brought there. What five? He is one who destroys life, takes what is not given, does not observe celibacy, speaks falsely, and indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. \[276\] Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in hell as if brought there.

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in heaven as if brought there. What five? He is one who abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual activity, from false speech, and from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in heaven as if brought there.”
