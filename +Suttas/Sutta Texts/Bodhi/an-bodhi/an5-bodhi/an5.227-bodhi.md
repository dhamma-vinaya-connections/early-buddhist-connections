# AN5.227 Wealth

> **Division:** III. LENGTHY WANDERING

“Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers in wealth. What five? It is shared by fire, water, kings, thieves, and displeasing heirs. These are the five dangers in wealth.

“Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits in wealth. What five? By means of wealth, (1) one makes oneself happy and pleased and properly maintains oneself in happiness; (2) one makes one’s parents happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness; (3) one makes one’s wife and children, slaves, workers, and servants happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness; (4) one makes one’s friends and companions happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness; (5) one establishes for ascetics and brahmins an uplifting offering of alms that is heavenly, resulting in happiness, and conducive to heaven. These are the five benefits in wealth.” \[260\]
