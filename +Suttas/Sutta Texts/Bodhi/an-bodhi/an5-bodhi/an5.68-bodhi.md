# AN5.68 Bases for Psychic Potency (2)

> **Division:** II. PERCEPTIONS

“Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was just a bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, I developed and cultivated five things. What five?

“(1) I developed the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to desire and activities of striving. (2) I developed the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to energy and activities of striving. (3) I developed the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to mind and activities of striving. (4) I developed the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to investigation and activities of striving. (5) Enthusiasm itself was the fifth.

“Because I had developed and cultivated these things with enthusiasm as the fifth, there being a suitable basis, I was capable of realizing any state realizable by direct knowledge toward which I inclined my mind.

“If I wished: ‘May I wield the various kinds of psychic potency: having been one, may I become many … \[as in 5:23\] … may I exercise mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world,’ I was capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis … \[as in 5:23\] …

“If I wished: \[83\] ‘May I, with the destruction of the taints, in this very life realize for myself with direct knowledge the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, may I dwell in it,’ I was capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.”
