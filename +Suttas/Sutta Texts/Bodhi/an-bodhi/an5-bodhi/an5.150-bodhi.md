# AN5.150 Temporarily Liberated (2)

> **Division:** V. TIKAṆḌAKĪ

“Bhikkhus, these five things lead to the decline of a temporarily liberated bhikkhu. What five? Delight in work, delight in talk, delight in sleep, not guarding the doors of the sense faculties, and lack of moderation in eating. These five things lead to the decline of a temporarily liberated bhikkhu.

“Bhikkhus, these five things lead to the non-decline of a temporarily liberated bhikkhu. What five? There is no delight in work, no delight in talk, no delight in sleep, guarding the doors of the sense faculties, and moderation in eating. \[174\] These five things lead to the non-decline of a temporarily liberated bhikkhu.”
