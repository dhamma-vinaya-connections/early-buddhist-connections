# AN5.194 Kāraṇapālī

> **Division:** V. DOGS

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Now on that occasion the brahmin Kāraṇapālī was getting some work done for the Licchavis. The brahmin Kāraṇapālī saw the brahmin Piṅgiyānī \[237\] coming in the distance and said to him:

“Where is Master Piṅgiyānī coming from in the middle of the day?”

“I am coming, sir, from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.”

“What do you think of the ascetic Gotama’s competence in wisdom? Do you consider him wise?”

“Who am I, sir, that I could know the ascetic Gotama’s competence in wisdom? Certainly, only one like him could know his competence in wisdom!”

“You praise the ascetic Gotama with lofty praise, indeed.”

“Who am I, sir, that I could praise the ascetic Gotama? Praised by those who are praised, Master Gotama is best among devas and humans!”

“What grounds do you see, Master Piṅgiyānī, for placing such full confidence in the ascetic Gotama?”

(1) “Just as a man who has found satisfaction in the best of tastes will no longer desire tastes of an inferior kind; so too, sir, whatever one hears of Master Gotama’s Dhamma—be it discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, or amazing accounts—one will no longer yearn for the doctrines of ordinary ascetics and brahmins.

(2) “Just as a man oppressed by hunger and weakness who receives a honey cake will enjoy a sweet, delicious taste wherever he eats of it; so too, sir, whatever one hears of Master Gotama’s Dhamma—discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, or amazing accounts—one will obtain satisfaction and placidity of mind.

(3) “Just as a man who comes upon a piece of sandalwood, whether yellow sandalwood or red sandalwood, will enjoy a pure, fragrant scent wherever he smells it, be it at the bottom, the middle, or the top \[238\]; so too, sir, whatever one hears of Master Gotama’s Dhamma—discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, or amazing accounts—one will derive elation and joy.

(4) “Just as a capable physician might instantly cure one who is afflicted, sick, and gravely ill; so too, sir, whatever one hears of Master Gotama’s Dhamma—discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, or amazing accounts—one’s sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish will vanish.

(5) “Just as there might be a delightful pond with pleasant banks, its water clear, agreeable, cool, and limpid, and a man oppressed and exhausted by the heat, fatigued, parched, and thirsty, might come by, enter the pond, and bathe and drink; thus all his affliction, fatigue, and feverish burning would subside. So too, sir, whatever one hears of Master Gotama’s Dhamma—discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, or amazing accounts—all one’s affliction, fatigue, and feverish burning subside.”

When this was said, the brahmin Kāraṇapālī rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and placing his right knee on the ground, he reverently saluted the Blessed One and uttered three times these inspired words:

“Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One! Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One! Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One!

“Excellent, Master Piṅgiyānī! Excellent, Master Piṅgiyānī! Master Piṅgiyānī has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, \[239\] or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good sight can see forms. Master Piṅgiyānī, I now go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Let Master Piṅgiyānī consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”
