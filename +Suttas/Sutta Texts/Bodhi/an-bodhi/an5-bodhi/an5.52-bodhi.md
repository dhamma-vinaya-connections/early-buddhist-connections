# AN5.52 A Heap

> **Division:** I. HINDRANCES

“Bhikkhus, saying ‘a heap of the unwholesome,’ it is about the five hindrances that one could rightly say this. For the five hindrances are a complete heap of the unwholesome. What five? The hindrance of sensual desire, the hindrance of ill will, the hindrance of dullness and drowsiness, the hindrance of restlessness and remorse, and the hindrance of doubt. Bhikkhus, saying ‘a heap of the unwholesome,’ it is about these five hindrances that one could rightly say this. For these five hindrances are a complete heap of the unwholesome.”
