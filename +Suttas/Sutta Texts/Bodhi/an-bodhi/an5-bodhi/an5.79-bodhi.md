# AN5.79 Future Perils (3)

> **Division:** III. FUTURE PERILS

“Bhikkhus, there are these five future perils as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize them \[106\] and make an effort to abandon them. What five?

(1) “In the future, there will be bhikkhus who are undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. They will give full ordination to others but will not be able to discipline them in the higher virtuous behavior, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom. These \[pupils\] too will be undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. They in turn will give full ordination to others but will not be able to discipline them in the higher virtuous behavior, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom. These \[pupils\] too will be undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. Thus, bhikkhus, through corruption of the Dhamma comes corruption of the discipline, and from corruption of the discipline comes corruption of the Dhamma. This is the first future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize it and make an effort to abandon it.

(2) “Again, in the future there will be bhikkhus who are undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. They will give dependence to others but will not be able to discipline them in the higher virtuous behavior, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom. These \[pupils\] too will be undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. They in turn will give dependence to others but will not be able to discipline them in the higher virtuous behavior, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom. These \[pupils\] too will be undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. Thus, bhikkhus, through corruption of the Dhamma comes corruption of the discipline, and from corruption of the discipline comes corruption of the Dhamma. This is the second future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize it and make an effort to abandon it. \[107\]

(3) “Again, in the future there will be bhikkhus who are undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. While engaged in talk pertaining to the Dhamma, in questions-and-answers, they will slide down into a dark Dhamma but will not recognize it. Thus, bhikkhus, through corruption of the Dhamma comes corruption of the discipline, and from corruption of the discipline comes corruption of the Dhamma. This is the third future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize it and make an effort to abandon it.

(4) “Again, in the future there will be bhikkhus who are undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. When those discourses spoken by the Tathāgata are being recited that are deep, deep in meaning, world-transcending, connected with emptiness, they will not want to listen to them, will not lend an ear to them, or apply their minds to understand them; they will not think those teachings should be studied and learned. But when those discourses are being recited that are mere poetry composed by poets, beautiful in words and phrases, created by outsiders, spoken by disciples, they will want to listen to them, lend an ear to them, and apply their minds to understand them; they will think those teachings should be studied and learned. Thus, bhikkhus, through corruption of the Dhamma comes corruption of the discipline, and from corruption of the discipline comes corruption of the Dhamma. This is the fourth future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize it and make an effort to abandon it.

(5) “Again, in the future there will be bhikkhus who are undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, \[108\] and wisdom. The elder bhikkhus—being undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom—will be luxurious and lax, leaders in backsliding, discarding the duty of solitude; they will not arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. Those in the next generation will follow their example. They, too, will be luxurious and lax, leaders in backsliding, discarding the duty of solitude; they, too, will not arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. Thus, bhikkhus, through corruption of the Dhamma comes corruption of the discipline, and from corruption of the discipline comes corruption of the Dhamma. This is the fifth future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize it and make an effort to abandon it.

“These, bhikkhus, are the five future perils as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize them and make an effort to abandon them.”
