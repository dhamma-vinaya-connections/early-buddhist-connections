# AN5.145 Hell

> **Division:** V. TIKAṆḌAKĪ

“Bhikkhus, one possessing five qualities is deposited in hell as if brought there. What five? One destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsely, and indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. One possessing these five qualities is deposited in hell as if brought there. \[171\]

“Bhikkhus, one possessing five \[other\] qualities is deposited in heaven as if brought there. What five? One abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. One possessing these five qualities is deposited in heaven as if brought there.”
