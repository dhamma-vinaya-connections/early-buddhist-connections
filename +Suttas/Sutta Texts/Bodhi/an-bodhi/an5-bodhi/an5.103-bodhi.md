# AN5.103 A Thief

> **Division:** I. DWELLING AT EASE

“Bhikkhus, possessing five factors, a master thief breaks into houses, plunders wealth, commits banditry, and ambushes highways. What five? Here, a master thief (1) depends upon the uneven, (2) on thickets, and (3) on powerful people; (4) he offers bribes, and (5) he moves alone.

(1) “And how does a master thief depend on the uneven? Here, a master thief depends on rivers that are hard to cross and rugged mountains. It is in this way that a master thief depends on the uneven.

(3) “And how does a master thief depend on powerful people? Here, a master thief depends on kings or royal ministers. He thinks: ‘If anyone \[129\] accuses me of anything, these kings or royal ministers will dismiss the case.’ If anyone accuses him of anything, those kings or royal ministers dismiss the case. It is in this way that a master thief depends on powerful people.

(4) “And how does a master thief offer bribes? Here, a master thief is rich, with great wealth and property. He thinks: ‘If anyone should accuse me of anything, I’ll placate him with a bribe.’ If anyone accuses him of anything, he placates him with a bribe. It is in this way that a master thief offers bribes.

(5) “And how does a master thief move alone? Here, a master thief executes his raids all alone. For what reason? \[With the thought:\] ‘My secret deliberations shouldn’t spread to others!’ It is in this way that a master thief moves alone.

“It is by possessing these five factors that a master thief breaks into houses, plunders wealth, commits banditry, and ambushes highways.

“So too, bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, an evil bhikkhu maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition, is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise, and generates much demerit.

(3) “And how does an evil bhikkhu depend on powerful people? Here, an evil bhikkhu depends on kings or royal ministers.
