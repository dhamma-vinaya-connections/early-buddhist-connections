# AN5.93 Declarations

> **Division:** V. KAKUDHA

“Bhikkhus, there are these five declarations of final knowledge. What five? (1) One declares final knowledge because of one’s dullness and stupidity; (2) one declares final knowledge because one has evil desires and is motivated by desire; (3) one declares final knowledge because one is mad and mentally deranged; (4) one declares final knowledge because one overrates oneself; and (5) one correctly declares final knowledge. These are the five declarations of final knowledge.”
