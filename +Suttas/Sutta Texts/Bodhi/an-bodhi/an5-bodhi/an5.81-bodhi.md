# AN5.81 Provoking Lust

> **Division:** IV. ELDERS

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, an elder bhikkhu is displeasing and disagreeable to his fellow monks and is neither respected nor esteemed by them. What five? (1) He is filled with lust toward that which provokes lust; (2) he is filled with hatred toward that which provokes hatred; (3) he is deluded by that which deludes; (4) he is agitated by that which agitates; (5) and he is intoxicated by that which intoxicates. Possessing these five qualities, an elder bhikkhu is displeasing and disagreeable to his fellow monks and is neither respected nor esteemed by them.
