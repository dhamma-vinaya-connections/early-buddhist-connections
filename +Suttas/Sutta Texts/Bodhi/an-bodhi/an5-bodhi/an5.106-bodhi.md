# AN5.106

> **Division:** I. DWELLING AT EASE

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Park. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

“(1) Bhante, in what way can a bhikkhu dwell at ease while living in the Saṅgha?”

“When, Ānanda, \[133\] a bhikkhu is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior but does not exhort others in regard to virtuous behavior, to this extent he can dwell at ease while living in the Saṅgha.”

(2) “But, Bhante, might there be another way by which a bhikkhu can dwell at ease while living in the Saṅgha?”

“There can be, Ānanda. When a bhikkhu is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior but does not exhort others in regard to virtuous behavior, and he examines himself but does not examine others, to this extent he can dwell at ease while living in the Saṅgha.”

(3) “But, Bhante, might there be another way by which a bhikkhu can dwell at ease while living in the Saṅgha?”

“There can be, Ānanda. When a bhikkhu is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior but does not exhort others in regard to virtuous behavior, and he examines himself but does not examine others, and he is not well known but is not agitated by lack of renown, to this extent he can dwell at ease while living in the Saṅgha.”

(4) “But, Bhante, might there be another way by which a bhikkhu can dwell at ease while living in the Saṅgha?”

“There can be, Ānanda. When a bhikkhu is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior but does not exhort others in regard to virtuous behavior; and he examines himself but does not examine others; and he is not well known but is not agitated by lack of renown; and he gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life, to this extent he can dwell at ease while living in the Saṅgha.”

(5) “But, Bhante, might there be another way by which a bhikkhu can dwell at ease while living in the Saṅgha?”

“There can be, Ānanda. When a bhikkhu is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior but does not exhort others in regard to virtuous behavior; and he examines himself but does not examine others; \[134\] and he is not well known but is not agitated by lack of renown; and he gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life; and, with the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it, to this extent he can dwell at ease while living in the Saṅgha. And, Ānanda, I say there is no other way of dwelling at ease more excellent or sublime than this.”
