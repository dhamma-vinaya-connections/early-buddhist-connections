# AN5.127 Living Apart

> **Division:** III. SICK

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu is not fit to live apart from the Saṅgha. What five? He is not content with any kind of robe; he is not content with any kind of almsfood; he is not content with any kind of lodging; he is not content with any kind of medicines and provisions for the sick; and he dwells engrossed in thoughts of sensuality. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is not fit to live apart from the Saṅgha.

“Bhikkhus, possessing five \[other\] qualities, a bhikkhu is fit to live apart from the Saṅgha. What five? \[146\] He is content with any kind of robe; he is content with any kind of almsfood; he is content with any kind of lodging; he is content with any kind of medicines and provisions for the sick; and he dwells engrossed in thoughts of renunciation. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is fit to live apart from the Saṅgha.”
