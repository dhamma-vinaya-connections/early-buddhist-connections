# AN5.217 Not Inspiring Confidence (1)

> **Division:** II. ONE WHO INSULTS

“Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers in conduct that does not inspire confidence. What five? One blames oneself; the wise, having investigated, censure one; one acquires a bad reputation; one dies confused; with the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. These are the five dangers in conduct that does not inspire confidence.

“Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits in conduct that inspires confidence. What five? One does not blame oneself; the wise, having investigated, praise one; one acquires a good reputation; one dies unconfused; with the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. These are the five benefits in conduct that inspires confidence.”
