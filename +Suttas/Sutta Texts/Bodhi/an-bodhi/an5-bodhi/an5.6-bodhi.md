(2) “There is no entering upon the unwholesome so long as a sense of moral shame is securely settled in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities. But when a sense of moral shame has disappeared and moral shamelessness obsesses one, then there is the entering upon the unwholesome.

(3) “There is no entering upon the unwholesome so long as moral dread is securely settled in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities. But when moral dread has disappeared and lack of moral dread obsesses one, then there is the entering upon the unwholesome.

(4) “There is no entering upon the unwholesome so long as energy is securely settled in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities. But when energy has disappeared and laziness obsesses one, then there is the entering upon the unwholesome.

(5) “There is no entering upon the unwholesome so long as wisdom is securely settled in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities. But when wisdom has disappeared and lack of wisdom obsesses one, then there is the entering upon the unwholesome.”
