# AN5.208 Brushing

> **Division:** I. KIMBILA

“Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers in not brushing one’s teeth. What five? It is bad for one’s eyes; one’s breath stinks; one’s taste buds are not purified; bile and phlegm envelop one’s food; and one’s food does not agree with one. These are the five dangers in not brushing one’s teeth.

“Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits in brushing one’s teeth. What five? It is good for one’s eyes; one’s breath does not stink; one’s taste buds are purified; bile and phlegm do not envelop one’s food; and one’s food agrees with one. These are the five benefits in brushing one’s teeth.” \[251\]
