# AN5.63 Growth (1)

> **Division:** II. PERCEPTIONS

“Bhikkhus, growing in five ways, a male noble disciple grows by a noble growth, and he absorbs the essence and the best of this life. What five? He grows in faith, virtuous behavior, learning, generosity, and wisdom. Growing in these five ways, a male noble disciple grows by a noble growth, and he absorbs the essence and the best of this life.”

He who grows in faith and virtuous behavior,

in wisdom, generosity, and learning—

such a discerning superior man

absorbs for himself the essence of this life.
