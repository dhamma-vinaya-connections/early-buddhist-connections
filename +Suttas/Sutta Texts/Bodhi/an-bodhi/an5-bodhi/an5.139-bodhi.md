# AN5.139 Cannot Patiently Endure

> **Division:** IV. KINGS

“Bhikkhus, possessing five factors, a king’s bull elephant is not worthy of a king, not an accessory of a king, and not reckoned as a factor of kingship. What five? It cannot patiently endure forms, cannot patiently endure sounds, cannot patiently endure odors, cannot patiently endure tastes, and cannot patiently endure tactile objects.

(1) “And how is it that a king’s bull elephant cannot patiently endure forms? Here, when a king’s bull elephant has gone to battle, on seeing the elephant troops, the cavalry, the charioteers, or the infantry, it sinks, founders, does not brace itself, and cannot enter the battle. It is in this way that a king’s bull elephant cannot patiently endure forms.

(2) “And how is it that a king’s bull elephant cannot patiently endure sounds? Here, when a king’s bull elephant has gone to battle, on hearing the sounds of elephants, horses, chariots, or infantrymen, or the sounds of drums, kettledrums, conches, and tom-toms, it sinks, founders, does not brace itself, and cannot enter the battle. It is in this way that a king’s bull elephant cannot patiently endure sounds.

(3) “And how is it that a king’s bull elephant cannot patiently endure odors? \[158\] Here, when a king’s bull elephant has gone to battle, on smelling the odor of the urine and feces of the royal bull elephants that are of pedigree stock and accustomed to battle, it sinks, founders, does not brace itself, and cannot enter the battle. It is in this way that a king’s bull elephant cannot patiently endure odors.

(4) “And how is it that a king’s bull elephant cannot patiently endure tastes? Here, when a king’s bull elephant has gone to battle, if it is deprived of one portion of grass and water, or two, three, four, or five portions, it sinks, founders, does not brace itself, and cannot enter the battle. It is in this way that a king’s bull elephant cannot patiently endure tastes.

(5) “And how is it that a king’s bull elephant cannot patiently endure tactile objects? Here, when a king’s bull elephant has gone to battle, if it is pierced by one volley of arrows, or by two, three, four, or five volleys, it sinks, founders, does not brace itself, and cannot enter the battle. It is in this way that a king’s bull elephant cannot patiently endure tactile objects.

“Possessing these five factors, a king’s bull elephant is not worthy of a king, not an accessory of a king, and not reckoned as a factor of kingship.

“So too, bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu is not worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What five? He cannot patiently endure forms, cannot patiently endure sounds, cannot patiently endure odors, cannot patiently endure tastes, and cannot patiently endure tactile objects.

(1) “And how is it that a bhikkhu cannot patiently endure forms? Here, when a bhikkhu sees a form with the eye, he becomes enamored of a tantalizing form and cannot concentrate his mind. It is in this way that a bhikkhu cannot patiently endure forms.

(2) “And how is it that a bhikkhu cannot patiently endure sounds? \[159\] Here, when a bhikkhu hears a sound with the ear, he becomes enamored of a tantalizing sound and cannot concentrate his mind. It is in this way that a bhikkhu cannot patiently endure sounds.

(3) “And how is it that a bhikkhu cannot patiently endure odors? Here, when a bhikkhu smells an odor with the nose, he becomes enamored of a tantalizing odor and cannot concentrate his mind. It is in this way that a bhikkhu cannot patiently endure odors.

(4) “And how is it that a bhikkhu cannot patiently endure tastes? Here, when a bhikkhu experiences a taste with the tongue, he becomes enamored of a tantalizing taste and cannot concentrate his mind. It is in this way that a bhikkhu cannot patiently endure tastes.

(5) “And how is it that a bhikkhu cannot patiently endure tactile objects? Here, when a bhikkhu feels a tactile object with the body, he becomes enamored of a tantalizing tactile object and cannot concentrate his mind. It is in this way that a bhikkhu cannot patiently endure tactile objects.

“Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is not worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.

“Bhikkhus, possessing five factors, a king’s bull elephant is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship. What five? It patiently endures forms, patiently endures sounds, patiently endures odors, patiently endures tastes, and patiently endures tactile objects.
