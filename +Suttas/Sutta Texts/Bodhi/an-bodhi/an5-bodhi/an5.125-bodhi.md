# AN5.125 Vitality (1)

> **Division:** III. SICK

“Bhikkhus, there are these five things that reduce vitality. What five? One does what is harmful; one does not observe moderation in what is beneficial; one has poor digestion; one walks \[for alms\] at an improper time; one is not celibate. These are the five things that reduce vitality.
