# AN5.98 A Forest Dweller

> **Division:** V. KAKUDHA

“Bhikkhus, possessing five things, a bhikkhu cultivating mindfulness of breathing in no long time penetrates to the unshakable. What five? (1) Here, a bhikkhu has few undertakings … (2) He eats little … (3) He is seldom drowsy … (4) He is a forest dweller who resorts to remote lodgings. (5) He reviews the extent to which his mind is liberated. Possessing these five things, a bhikkhu cultivating mindfulness of breathing in no long time penetrates to the unshakable.”
