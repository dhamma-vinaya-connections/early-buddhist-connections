# AN5.199 Families

> **Division:** V. DOGS

“Bhikkhus, whenever virtuous monastics come to a home, the people there generate much merit on five grounds. What five? (1) When people see virtuous monastics come to their home and they arouse hearts of confidence \[toward them\], on that occasion that family is practicing the way conducive to heaven. (2) When people rise, pay homage, and offer a seat to virtuous monastics who come to their home, on that occasion that family is practicing the way conducive to birth in high families. (3) When people remove the stain of miserliness toward virtuous monastics who come to their home, on that occasion that family is practicing the way conducive to great influence. (4) When, according to their means, people share what they have with virtuous monastics who come to their home, on that occasion that family is practicing the way conducive to great wealth. (5) When people question virtuous monastics who come to their home, make inquiries about the teachings, and listen to the Dhamma, on that occasion that family is practicing the way conducive to great wisdom. \[245\] Bhikkhus, whenever virtuous monastics come to a home, the people there generate much merit on these five grounds.”
