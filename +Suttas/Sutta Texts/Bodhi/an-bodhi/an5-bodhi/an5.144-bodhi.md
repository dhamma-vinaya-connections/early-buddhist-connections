# AN5.144 Tikaṇḍakī

> **Division:** V. TIKAṆḌAKĪ

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāketa in the Tikaṇḍakī Grove. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”

“Venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“(1) Bhikkhus, it is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to dwell perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive. (2) It is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive. (3) It is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to dwell perceiving the repulsive in both the unrepulsive and the repulsive. (4) It is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in both the repulsive and the unrepulsive. (5) It is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to dwell equanimous, mindful and clearly comprehending, having turned away from both the repulsive and the unrepulsive.

(1) “And for the sake of what benefit should a bhikkhu dwell perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive? ‘Let no lust arise in me toward things provocative of lust!’: for the sake of this benefit a bhikkhu should dwell perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive.

(2) “And for the sake of what benefit should a bhikkhu dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive? ‘Let no hatred arise in me toward things provocative of hatred!’: for the sake of this benefit a bhikkhu should dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive.

(3) “And for the sake of what \[170\] benefit should a bhikkhu dwell perceiving the repulsive in both the unrepulsive and the repulsive? ‘Let no lust arise in me toward things provocative of lust, and no hatred toward things provocative of hatred!’: for the sake of this benefit a bhikkhu should dwell perceiving the repulsive in both the unrepulsive and the repulsive.

(4) “And for the sake of what benefit should a bhikkhu dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in both the repulsive and the unrepulsive? ‘Let no hatred arise in me toward things provocative of hatred, and no lust toward things provocative of lust!’: for the sake of this benefit a bhikkhu should dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in both the repulsive and the unrepulsive.

(5) “And for the sake of what benefit should a bhikkhu dwell equanimous, mindful and clearly comprehending, having turned away from both the repulsive and the unrepulsive? ‘Let no lust at all arise in me anywhere in any way regarding things provocative of lust! Let no hatred at all arise in me anywhere in any way regarding things provocative of hatred! May no delusion at all arise in me anywhere in any way regarding things that breed delusion!’: for the sake of this benefit a bhikkhu should dwell equanimous, mindful and clearly comprehending, having turned away from both the repulsive and the unrepulsive.”
