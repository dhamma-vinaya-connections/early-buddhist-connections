# AN5.233 Beautifying

> **Division:** IV. RESIDENT

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a resident bhikkhu beautifies a monastery. What five? \[263\] (1) He is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha … he trains in them. (2) He has learned much … and penetrated well by view. (3) He is a good speaker with a good delivery; he is gifted with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning. (4) He is able to instruct, encourage, inspire, and gladden with a Dhamma talk those who approach him. (5) He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. Possessing these five qualities, a resident bhikkhu beautifies a monastery.”
