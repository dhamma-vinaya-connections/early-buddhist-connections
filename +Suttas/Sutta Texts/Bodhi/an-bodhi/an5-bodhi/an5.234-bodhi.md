# AN5.234 Very Helpful

> **Division:** IV. RESIDENT

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a resident bhikkhu is very helpful to a monastery. What five? (1) He is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha … he trains in them. (2) He has learned much … and penetrated well by view. (3) He repairs what is broken and split. (4) When a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus has arrived including bhikkhus from various states, he approaches laypeople and informs them: ‘Friends, a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus has arrived including bhikkhus from various states. Make merit. It is an occasion to make merit.’ (5) He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. Possessing these five qualities, a resident bhikkhu is very helpful to a monastery.”
