# AN5.124 An Attendant (2)

> **Division:** III. SICK

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, an attendant is not qualified to take care of a patient. What five? (1) He is unable to prepare medicine. (2) He does not know what is beneficial and harmful, so he offers what is harmful and withholds what is beneficial. (3) He takes care of the patient for the sake of material rewards, not with a mind of loving-kindness. (4) He is disgusted at having to remove feces, urine, vomit, or spittle. (5) He is unable from time to time to instruct, encourage, inspire, and gladden the patient with a Dhamma talk. Possessing these five qualities, an attendant is not qualified to take care of a patient.
