# AN5.253 Novice

> **Division:** I. FULL ORDINATION

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu may be attended upon by a novice. What five? Here, a bhikkhu possesses the aggregate of virtuous behavior … the aggregate of concentration … the aggregate of wisdom … the aggregate of liberation … the aggregate of the knowledge and vision of liberation of one beyond training. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu may be attended upon by a novice.” \[272\]
