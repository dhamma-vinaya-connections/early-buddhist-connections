# AN5.130 Accomplishments

> **Division:** III. SICK

“Bhikkhus, there are these five disasters. What five? Disaster due to \[loss of\] relatives, disaster due to \[loss of\] wealth, disaster due to illness, disaster regarding virtuous behavior, and disaster regarding view. It is not because of a disaster due to \[loss of\] relatives, or a disaster due to \[loss of\] wealth, or a disaster due to illness that with the breakup of the body, after death, beings are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. It is because of a disaster regarding virtuous behavior and a disaster regarding view that with the breakup of the body, after death, beings are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. These are the five disasters.

“Bhikkhus, there are these five accomplishments. What five? Accomplishment in relatives, accomplishment in wealth, accomplishment in health, accomplishment in virtuous behavior, and accomplishment in view. It is not because of accomplishment in relatives, accomplishment in wealth, or accomplishment in health that with the breakup of the body, after death, beings are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. It is because of accomplishment in virtuous behavior and accomplishment in view that with the breakup of the body, after death, beings are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. These are the five accomplishments.”
