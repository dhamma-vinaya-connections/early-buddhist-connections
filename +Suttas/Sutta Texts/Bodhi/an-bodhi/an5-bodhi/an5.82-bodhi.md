# AN5.82 Devoid of Lust

> **Division:** IV. ELDERS

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, an elder bhikkhu is displeasing and disagreeable to his fellow monks and is neither respected nor esteemed by them. What five? He is not devoid of lust; he is not devoid of hatred; he is not devoid of delusion; he is denigrating; and he is insolent. Possessing these five qualities … nor esteemed by them.
