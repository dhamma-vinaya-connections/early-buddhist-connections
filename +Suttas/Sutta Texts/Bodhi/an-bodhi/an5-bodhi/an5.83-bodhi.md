# AN5.83 A Schemer

> **Division:** IV. ELDERS

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, an elder bhikkhu is displeasing and disagreeable to his fellow monks and is neither respected nor esteemed by them. What five? He is a schemer, a flatterer, a hinter, a belittler, and one who pursues gain with gain. Possessing these five qualities … nor esteemed by them. \[112\]
