# AN5.223 Residing Too Long

> **Division:** III. LENGTHY WANDERING

“Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers in residing too long \[in the same place\]. What five? (1) One comes to own and accumulate many goods; (2) one comes to own and accumulate many medicines; (3) one takes on many tasks and duties and becomes competent in the various things to be done; (4) one forms bonds with householders and monastics in an unsuitable way typical of laypeople; and (5) when one departs from that monastery, one departs full of concern. These are the five dangers in residing too long \[in the same place\].

“Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits in residing for a balanced period \[in the same place\]. What five? (1) One does not come to own and accumulate many goods; (2) one does not come to own and accumulate many medicines; (3) one does not take on many tasks and duties and become competent in the various things to be done; (4) one does not form bonds with householders and monastics in an unsuitable way typical of laypeople; and (5) when one departs from that monastery, one departs without concern. These are the five benefits in residing for a balanced period \[in the same place\].”
