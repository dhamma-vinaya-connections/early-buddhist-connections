# AN5.138 A Consumer of Food

> **Division:** IV. KINGS

“Bhikkhus, possessing five factors, a king’s bull elephant is a consumer of food, an occupant of space, a discharger of dung, a ticket-taker, and yet still is reckoned as a king’s bull elephant. What five? It cannot patiently endure forms, cannot patiently endure sounds, cannot patiently endure odors, cannot patiently endure tastes, and cannot patiently endure tactile objects. Possessing these five factors, a king’s bull elephant is a consumer of food … yet still is reckoned as a king’s bull elephant.

“So too, bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu is a consumer of food, an occupant of space, a crusher of chairs, a ticket-taker, and yet still is reckoned as a bhikkhu. What five? \[157\] Here, a bhikkhu cannot patiently endure forms, cannot patiently endure sounds, cannot patiently endure odors, cannot patiently endure tastes, and cannot patiently endure tactile objects. Possessing these five factors, a bhikkhu is a consumer of food, an occupant of space … yet still is reckoned as a bhikkhu.”
