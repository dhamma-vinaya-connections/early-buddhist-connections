# AN5.149 Temporarily Liberated (1)

> **Division:** V. TIKAṆḌAKĪ

“Bhikkhus, these five things lead to the decline of a temporarily liberated bhikkhu. What five? Delight in work, delight in talk, delight in sleep, delight in company; and he does not review the extent to which the mind is liberated. These five things lead to the decline of a temporarily liberated bhikkhu.

“Bhikkhus, these five things lead to the non-decline of a temporarily liberated bhikkhu. What five? There is no delight in work, no delight in talk, no delight in sleep, no delight in company; and he reviews the extent to which the mind is liberated. These five things lead to the non-decline of a temporarily liberated bhikkhu.”
