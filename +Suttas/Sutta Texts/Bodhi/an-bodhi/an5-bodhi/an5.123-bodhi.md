# AN5.123 An Attendant (1)

> **Division:** III. SICK

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a patient is difficult to take care of. What five? (1) He does what is harmful. (2) He does not observe moderation in what is beneficial. (3) He does not take his medicine. (4) He does not accurately disclose his symptoms to his kindhearted attendant; he does not report, as fits the case, that his condition is getting worse, or getting better, or remaining the same. (5) He cannot patiently endure arisen bodily feelings that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable, sapping one’s vitality. \[144\] Possessing these five qualities, a patient is difficult to take care of.
