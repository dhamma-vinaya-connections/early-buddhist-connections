# AN5.159 Udāyī

> **Division:** I. THE GOOD DHAMMA

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Park. Now on that occasion the Venerable Udāyī, surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople, was sitting teaching the Dhamma. The Venerable Ānanda saw this and approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: “Bhante, the Venerable Udāyī, surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople, is teaching the Dhamma.”

“It isn’t easy, Ānanda, to teach the Dhamma to others. One who teaches the Dhamma to others should first set up five qualities internally. What five? (1) \[Having determined:\] ‘I will give a progressive talk,’ one should teach the Dhamma to others. (2) \[Having determined:\] ‘I will give a talk that shows reasons,’ one should teach the Dhamma to others. (3) \[Having determined:\] ‘I will give a talk out of sympathy,’ one should teach the Dhamma to others. (4) \[Having determined:\] ‘I will not give a talk while intent on material gain,’ one should teach the Dhamma to others. (5) \[Having determined:\] ‘I will give a talk without harming myself or others,’ one should teach the Dhamma to others. It isn’t easy, Ānanda, to teach the Dhamma to others. One who teaches the Dhamma to others should first set up these five qualities internally.”
