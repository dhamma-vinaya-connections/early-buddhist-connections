# AN5.169 Of Quick Apprehension

> **Division:** II. RESENTMENT

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said: “In what way, friend Sāriputta, is a bhikkhu one of quick apprehension concerning wholesome teachings, one who grasps well what he has learned, learns abundantly, and does not forget what he has learned?”

“The Venerable Ānanda is learned, so let him clear this up himself.”

“Then listen, friend Sāriputta, and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, friend,” the Venerable Sāriputta replied. The Venerable Ānanda said this:

“Here, friend Sāriputta, a bhikkhu is skilled in meaning, skilled in the Dhamma, skilled in language, skilled in phrasing, and skilled in sequence. In this way, friend Sāriputta, a bhikkhu is one of quick apprehension concerning wholesome teachings, one who grasps well what he has learned, learns abundantly, and does not forget what he has learned.”

“It’s astounding and amazing, friend, how well this has been stated by the Venerable Ānanda! We consider the Venerable Ānanda to be one who possesses these five qualities: ‘The Venerable Ānanda is skilled in meaning, skilled in Dhamma, skilled in language, skilled in phrasing, and skilled in sequence.’” \[202\]
