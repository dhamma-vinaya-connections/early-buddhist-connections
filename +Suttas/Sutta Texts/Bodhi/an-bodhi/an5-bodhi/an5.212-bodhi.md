# AN5.212 Arguments

> **Division:** II. ONE WHO INSULTS

“Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is a maker of arguments, quarrels, disputes, contentious talk, and disciplinary issues in the Saṅgha, five dangers can be expected for him. What five? (1) He does not achieve what he has not yet achieved; (2) he falls away from what he has achieved; (3) a bad report circulates about him; (4) he dies confused; and (5) with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. When a bhikkhu is a maker of arguments, quarrels, disputes, contentious talk, and disciplinary issues in the Saṅgha, these five dangers can be expected for him.”
