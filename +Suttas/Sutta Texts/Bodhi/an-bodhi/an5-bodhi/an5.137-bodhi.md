# AN5.137 Little Sleep

> **Division:** IV. KINGS

“Bhikkhus, these five sleep little at night but mostly keep awake. What five? A woman intent on a man, a man intent on a woman, a thief intent on theft, a king engaged with his royal duties, and a bhikkhu intent on severing the bonds. These five sleep little at night but mostly keep awake.”
