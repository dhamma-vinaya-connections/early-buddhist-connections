# AN5.141 Having Given, One Despises

> **Division:** V. TIKAṆḌAKĪ

“Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of persons found in the world. What five? The one who gives and then despises; the one who despises as a result of living together; the one gullible for gossip; the capricious one; and the one who is dull and stupid.

(1) “And how is a person one who gives and then despises? Here, one person gives another a robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick. It occurs to him: ‘I give; he receives.’ Having given to him, he despises him. It is in this way that a person is one who gives and then despises.

(2) “And how does a person despise as a result of living together? \[165\] Here, one person lives together with another for two or three years. He then despises the other because they have lived together. It is in this way that a person despises as a result of living together.

(3) “And how is a person gullible for gossip? Here, when praise or dispraise is being spoken about another person, he readily believes it. It is in this way that a person is gullible for gossip.

(4) “And how is a person capricious? Here, a person’s faith, devotion, affection, and confidence are fickle. It is in this way that a person is capricious.

(5) “And how is a person dull and stupid? Here, a person does not know which qualities are wholesome and which unwholesome, which qualities are blameworthy and which blameless, which qualities are inferior and which superior; he does not know dark and bright qualities along with their counterparts. It is in this way that a person is dull and stupid.

“These, bhikkhus, are the five kinds of persons found in the world.”
