# AN5.210 With a Muddled Mind

> **Division:** I. KIMBILA

“Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers for one who falls asleep with a muddled mind, lacking clear comprehension. What five? He sleeps badly; he awakens miserably; he has bad dreams; the deities do not protect him; and semen is emitted. These are the five dangers for one who falls asleep with a muddled mind, lacking clear comprehension.

“Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits for one who falls asleep mindfully and with clear comprehension. What five? He sleeps well; he awakens happily; he does not have bad dreams; deities protect him; and semen is not emitted. These are the five benefits for one who falls asleep mindfully and with clear comprehension.” \[252\]
