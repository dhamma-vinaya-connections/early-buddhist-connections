# AN5.153 The Fixed Course of Rightness (3)

> **Division:** I. THE GOOD DHAMMA

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, even while listening to the good Dhamma one is incapable of entering upon the fixed course \[consisting in\] rightness in wholesome qualities. What five? (1) One listens to the Dhamma as a denigrator obsessed with denigration; (2) one listens to the Dhamma with the intention of criticizing it, seeking faults; \[176\] (3) one is ill disposed toward the teacher, intent on attacking him; (4) one is unwise, stupid, obtuse; (5) one imagines that one has understood what one has not understood. Possessing these five qualities, even while listening to the good Dhamma one is incapable of entering upon the fixed course \[consisting in\] rightness in wholesome qualities.

(1) One does not listen to the Dhamma as a denigrator obsessed with denigration; (2) one listens to the Dhamma without any intention of criticizing it, not as one who seeks faults; (3) one is not ill disposed toward the teacher and intent on attacking him; (4) one is wise, intelligent, astute; (5) one does not imagine that one has understood what one has not understood.
