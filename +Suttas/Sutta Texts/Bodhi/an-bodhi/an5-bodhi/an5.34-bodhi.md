# AN5.34 Sīha

> **Division:** IV. SUMANĀ

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then Sīha the general approached \[39\] the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

“Is it possible, Bhante, to point out a directly visible fruit of giving?”

“It is, Sīha,” the Blessed One said.

(1) “A donor, Sīha, a munificent giver, is dear and agreeable to many people. This is a directly visible fruit of giving.

(2) “Again, good persons resort to a donor, a munificent giver. This, too, is a directly visible fruit of giving.

(3) “Again, a donor, a munificent giver, acquires a good reputation. This, too, is a directly visible fruit of giving.

(4) “Again, whatever assembly a donor, a munificent giver, approaches—whether of khattiyas, brahmins, householders, or ascetics—he approaches it confidently and composed. This too is a directly visible fruit of giving.

(5) “Again, with the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. This is a fruit of giving pertaining to future lives.”

When this was said, Sīha the general said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, I do not go by faith in the Blessed One concerning those four directly visible fruits of giving declared by him. I know them, too. For I am a donor, a munificent giver, and I am dear and agreeable to many people. I am a donor, a munificent giver, and many good persons resort to me. I am a donor, a munificent giver, and I have acquired a good reputation as a donor, sponsor, and supporter of the Saṅgha. I \[40\] am a donor, a munificent giver, and whatever assembly I approach—whether of khattiyas, brahmins, householders, or ascetics—I approach it confidently and composed. I do not go by faith in the Blessed One concerning these four directly visible fruits of giving declared by him. I know them, too. But when the Blessed One tells me: ‘Sīha, with the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world,’ I do not know this, and here I go by faith in the Blessed One.”

“So it is, Sīha, so it is! With the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.”

By giving, he becomes dear and many resort to him.

He attains a good reputation and his fame increases.

The generous man is composed

and confidently enters the assembly.

Therefore, seeking happiness,

wise persons give gifts,

having removed the stain of miserliness.

When they are settled in the triple heaven,

for a long time they delight

in companionship with the devas.

Having taken the opportunity to do wholesome deeds,

passing from here, self-luminous, they roam in Nandana,

where they delight, rejoice, and enjoy themselves,

furnished with the five objects of sensual pleasure.

Having fulfilled the word of the unattached Stable One,

the Fortunate One’s disciples rejoice in heaven. \[41\]
