# AN5.196 Dreams

> **Division:** V. DOGS

“Bhikkhus, before his enlightenment, while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened, five great dreams appeared to the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. What five?

(1) “Before his enlightenment, while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One \[dreamt\] that this mighty earth was his bedstead; the Himālaya, king of mountains, was his pillow; his left hand rested on the eastern sea, his right hand on the western sea, and his two feet on the southern sea. This was the first great dream that appeared to the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One before his enlightenment, while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened.

(2) “Again, before his enlightenment … the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One \[dreamt\] that a kind of grass called _tiriyā_ rose up from his navel and stood touching the sky. \[241\] This was the second great dream that appeared to the Tathāgata … while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened.

(3) “Again, before his enlightenment … the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One \[dreamt\] that white worms with black heads crawled from his feet up to his knees and covered them. This was the third great dream that appeared to the Tathāgata … while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened.

(4) “Again, before his enlightenment … the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One \[dreamt\] that four birds of different colors came from the four quarters, fell at his feet, and turned all white. This was the fourth great dream that appeared to the Tathāgata … while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened.

(5) “Again, before his enlightenment … the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One \[dreamt\] that he climbed up a huge mountain of dung without being soiled by it. This was the fifth great dream that appeared to the Tathāgata … while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened.

(1) “Now, bhikkhus, when the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One—before his enlightenment, while just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened—\[dreamt\] that this mighty earth was his bedstead and the Himālaya, king of mountains, his pillow; that his left hand rested on the eastern sea, his right hand on the western sea, and his two feet on the southern sea, \[this was a foretoken\] that he would awaken to the unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment. This first great dream appeared to him \[as a sign\] that his awakening \[was imminent\]. \[242\]

(2) “When the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One … \[dreamt\] that _tiriyā_ grass rose up from his navel and stood touching the sky, \[this was a foretoken\] that he would awaken to the noble eightfold path and would proclaim it well among devas and humans. This second great dream appeared to him \[as a sign\] that his awakening \[was imminent\].

(3) “When the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One … \[dreamt\] that white worms with black heads crawled from his feet up to his knees and covered them, \[this was a foretoken\] that many white-robed householders would go for lifelong refuge to the Tathāgata. This third great dream appeared to him \[as a sign\] that his awakening \[was imminent\].

(4) “When the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One … \[dreamt\] that four birds of different colors came from the four quarters, fell at his feet, and turned all white, \[this was a foretoken\] that members of the four classes—khattiyas, brahmins, vessas, and suddas—would go forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata and realize unsurpassed liberation. This fourth great dream appeared to him \[as a sign\] that his awakening \[was imminent\].

(5) “When the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One … \[dreamt\] that he climbed up a huge mountain of dung without being soiled by it, \[this was a foretoken\] that he would receive robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines and provisions for the sick, and he would use them without being tied to them, infatuated with them, and blindly absorbed in them, seeing the danger and knowing the escape. This fifth great dream appeared to him \[as a sign\] that his awakening \[was imminent\].

“These, bhikkhus, were the five great dreams that appeared to the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, before his enlightenment, while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened.” \[243\]
