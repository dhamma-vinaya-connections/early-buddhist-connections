# AN5.129 Lesions

> **Division:** III. SICK

“Bhikkhus, there are these five incurable lesions that lead to the plane of misery, that lead to hell. What five? One deprives one’s mother of life; one deprives one’s father of life; one deprives an arahant of life; with a mind of hatred one sheds the Tathāgata’s blood; one creates a schism in the Saṅgha. These are the five incurable lesions that lead to the plane of misery, that lead to hell.” \[147\]
