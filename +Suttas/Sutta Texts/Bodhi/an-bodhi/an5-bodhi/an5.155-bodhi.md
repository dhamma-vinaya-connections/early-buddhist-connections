# AN5.155 Decline of the Good Dhamma (2)

> **Division:** I. THE GOOD DHAMMA

“Bhikkhus, there are these five things that lead to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma. What five?

(1) “Here, the bhikkhus do not learn the Dhamma: discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-and-answers. This is the first thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

(2) “Again, the bhikkhus do not teach the Dhamma to others in detail as they have heard it and learned it. This is the second thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

(3) “Again, the bhikkhus do not make others repeat the Dhamma in detail as they have heard it and learned it. This is the third thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

(4) “Again, the bhikkhus do not recite the Dhamma in detail as they have heard it and learned it. This is the fourth thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

(5) “Again, the bhikkhus do not ponder, examine, and mentally inspect the Dhamma as they have heard it and learned it. This is the fifth thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.
