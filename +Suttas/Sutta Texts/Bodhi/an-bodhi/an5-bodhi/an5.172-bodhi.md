# AN5.172 Self-Confidence

> **Division:** III. THE LAY FOLLOWER

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower dwells without self-confidence at home. What five? \[204\] He destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsely, and indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower dwells without self-confidence at home.
