# AN5.70 Destruction of the Taints

> **Division:** II. PERCEPTIONS

“Bhikkhus, these five things, when developed and cultivated, lead to the destruction of the taints. What five? Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness of food, perceiving non-delight in the entire world, contemplating impermanence in all conditioned phenomena; and he has the perception of death well established internally. These five things, when developed and cultivated, lead to the destruction of the taints.” \[84\]
