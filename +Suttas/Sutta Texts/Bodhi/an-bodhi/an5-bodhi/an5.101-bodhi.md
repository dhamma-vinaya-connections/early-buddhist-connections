# AN5.101 Timidity

> **Division:** I. DWELLING AT EASE

“Bhikkhus, there are these five qualities that make for self-confidence in a trainee. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith and is virtuous, learned, energetic, and wise. (1) Whatever timidity there is in one without faith does not exist in one endowed with faith; therefore this quality makes for self-confidence in a trainee. (2) Whatever timidity there is in one who is immoral does not exist in one who is virtuous; therefore this quality makes for self-confidence in a trainee. (3) Whatever timidity there is in one who is unlearned does not exist in one who is learned; therefore this quality makes for self-confidence in a trainee. (4) Whatever timidity there is in one who is lazy does not exist in one who is energetic; therefore this quality makes for self-confidence in a trainee. (5) Whatever timidity there is in one who is unwise does not exist in one who is wise; therefore this quality makes for self-confidence in a trainee. These are the five qualities that make for self-confidence in a trainee.” \[128\]
