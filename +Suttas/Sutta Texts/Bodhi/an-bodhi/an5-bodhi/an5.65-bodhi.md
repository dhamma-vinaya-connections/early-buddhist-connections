# AN5.65 Discussion

> **Division:** II. PERCEPTIONS

“Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu possesses five qualities, it is fitting for his fellow monks to hold a discussion with him. What five? (1) Here, a bhikkhu is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior, and he answers questions that come up in a discussion on accomplishment in virtuous behavior. (2) He is himself accomplished in concentration, and he answers questions that come up in a discussion on accomplishment in concentration. (3) He is himself accomplished in wisdom, and he answers questions that come up in a discussion on accomplishment in wisdom. (4) He is himself accomplished in liberation, and he answers questions that come up in a discussion on accomplishment in liberation. (5) He is himself accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation, and he answers questions that come up in a discussion on accomplishment in the knowledge and vision of liberation. When a bhikkhu possesses these five qualities, it is fitting for his fellow monks to hold a discussion with him.”
