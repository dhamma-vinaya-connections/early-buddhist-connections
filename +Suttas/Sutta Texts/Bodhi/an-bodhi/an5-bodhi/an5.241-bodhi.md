# AN5.241 Misconduct

> **Division:** V. MISCONDUCT

“Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers in misconduct. What five? (1) One blames oneself. (2) The wise, having investigated, censure one. (3) One acquires a bad reputation. (4) One dies confused. (5) With the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. These are the five dangers in misconduct.

“Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits in good conduct. What five? (1) One does not censure oneself. (2) The wise, having investigated, praise one. (3) One acquires a good reputation. (4) One dies unconfused. (5) With the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. These are the five benefits in good conduct.”
