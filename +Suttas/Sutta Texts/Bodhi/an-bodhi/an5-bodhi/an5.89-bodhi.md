# AN5.89 A Trainee (1)

> **Division:** IV. ELDERS

“Bhikkhus, these five qualities lead to the decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee. What five? Delight in work, delight in talk, delight in sleep, and delight in company; and he does not review the extent to which his mind is liberated. These five qualities lead to the decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee.

“Bhikkhus, these five qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee. What five? Not delighting in work, not delighting in talk, not delighting in sleep, not delighting in company; and he reviews the extent to which his mind is liberated. These five qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee.”
