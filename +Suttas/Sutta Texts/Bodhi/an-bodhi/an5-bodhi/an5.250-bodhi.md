# AN5.250 Confidence in a Person

> **Division:** V. MISCONDUCT

“Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers in basing one’s confidence on a person. What five?

(1) “The person in whom another has complete confidence may commit an offense because of which the Saṅgha suspends him. It occurs to the one \[who had such confidence in him\]: ‘The person who is pleasing and agreeable to me has been suspended by the Saṅgha.’ He then loses much of his confidence in bhikkhus. Since he has lost much of his confidence in them, he does not associate with other bhikkhus. Since he does not associate with other bhikkhus, he does not get to hear the good Dhamma. Since he does not get to hear the good Dhamma, he falls away from the good Dhamma. This is the first danger in basing one’s confidence on a person.

(2) “Again, the person in whom another has complete confidence may commit an offense because of which the Saṅgha makes him sit at the end. It occurs to the one \[who had such confidence in him\]: ‘The Saṅgha has made the person who is pleasing and agreeable to me sit at the end.’ He then loses much of his confidence in bhikkhus…. Since he does not get to hear the good Dhamma, he falls away from the good Dhamma. This is the second danger in basing one’s confidence on a person.

(3) “Again, the person in whom another has complete confidence may depart for some other quarter … (4) … may disrobe … (5) … may pass away. It occurs to the one \[who had such confidence in him\]: ‘The person who was pleasing and agreeable to me \[has departed for some other quarter … has disrobed … \] has passed away.’ He does not associate with other bhikkhus. Since he does not associate with other bhikkhus, he does not get to hear the good Dhamma. Since he does not get to hear the good Dhamma, he falls away from the good Dhamma. This is the fifth danger in basing one’s confidence on a person.

“These, bhikkhus, are the five dangers in basing one’s confidence on a person.” \[271\]
