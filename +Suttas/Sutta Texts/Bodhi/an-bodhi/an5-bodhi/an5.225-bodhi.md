“Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers for one who visits families. What five? \[259\] (1) One commits the offense of going to visit \[families\] without taking leave \[of another bhikkhu\]. (2) One commits the offense of sitting privately \[with a woman\]. (3) One commits the offense of sitting on a concealed seat \[with a woman\]. (4) One commits the offense of teaching the Dhamma to a woman in more than five or six sentences. (5) One is infested by sensual thoughts. These are the five dangers for one who visits families.”
