# AN5.131 Continuing to Turn the Wheel (1)

> **Division:** IV. KINGS

“Bhikkhus, possessing five factors, a wheel-turning monarch sets the wheel in motion solely through the Dhamma, a wheel that \[148\] cannot be turned back by any hostile creature in human form. What five? Here, a wheel-turning monarch is one who knows what is good, who knows the Dhamma, who knows the right measure, who knows the proper time, and who knows the assembly. Possessing these five factors, a wheel-turning monarch sets the wheel in motion solely through the Dhamma, a wheel that cannot be turned back by any hostile creature in human form.

“So too, bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One sets in motion the unsurpassed wheel of the Dhamma solely through the Dhamma, a wheel that cannot be turned back by any ascetic, brahmin, deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world. What five? Here, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One is one who knows what is good, who knows the Dhamma, who knows the right measure, who knows the proper time, and who knows the assembly. Possessing these five qualities, the Tathāgata … sets in motion the unsurpassed wheel of the Dhamma solely through the Dhamma, a wheel that cannot be turned back … by anyone in the world.”
