# AN5.95 The Unshakable

> **Division:** V. KAKUDHA

“Bhikkhus, possessing five things, a bhikkhu in no long time penetrates to the unshakable. What five? \[120\] Here, a bhikkhu has attained the analytical knowledge of meaning, the analytical knowledge of the Dhamma, the analytical knowledge of language, and the analytical knowledge of discernment; and he reviews the extent to which his mind is liberated. Possessing these five things, a bhikkhu in no long time penetrates to the unshakable.”
