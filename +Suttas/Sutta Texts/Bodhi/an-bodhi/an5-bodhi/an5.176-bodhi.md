# AN5.176 Rapture

> **Division:** III. THE LAY FOLLOWER

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, accompanied by five hundred lay followers, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika \[and his retinue\]:

“Householders, you have presented robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. You should not be content merely with this much, \[thinking\]: ‘We have presented robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus.’ Therefore, householders, you should train yourselves thus: \[207\] ‘How can we from time to time enter and dwell in the rapture of solitude?’ It is in such a way that you should train yourselves.”

When this was said, the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One: “It’s astounding and amazing, Bhante, how well that was said by the Blessed One. Bhante, whenever a noble disciple enters and dwells in the rapture of solitude, on that occasion five things do not occur in him. (1) Pain and dejection connected with sensuality do not occur in him. (2) Pleasure and joy connected with sensuality do not occur in him. (3) Pain and dejection connected with the unwholesome do not occur in him. (4) Pleasure and joy connected with the unwholesome do not occur in him. (5) Pain and dejection connected with the wholesome do not occur in him. Bhante, whenever a noble disciple enters and dwells in the rapture of solitude, on that occasion these five things do not occur in him.”

“Good, good, Sāriputta! Sāriputta, whenever \[208\] a noble disciple enters and dwells in the rapture of solitude … \[The Buddha repeats in full the entire statement of the Venerable Sāriputta, down to:\] … on that occasion these five things do not occur in him.”
