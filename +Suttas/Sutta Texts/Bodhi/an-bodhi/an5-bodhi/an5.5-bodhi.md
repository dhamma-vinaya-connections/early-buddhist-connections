# AN5.5 Training

> **Division:** I. THE TRAINEE’S POWERS

“Bhikkhus, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who gives up the training and reverts to the lower life incurs five reasonable criticisms and grounds for censure in this very life. What five? (1) ‘You did not have faith in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities. (2) You did not have a sense of moral shame in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities. (3) You did not have moral dread in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities. (4) You did not have energy in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities. (5) You did not have wisdom in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities.’ Any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who gives up the training and reverts to the lower life incurs these five reasonable criticisms and grounds for censure in this very life.

“Bhikkhus, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who lives the complete and pure spiritual life, even with pain and dejection, weeping with a tearful face, gains five reasonable grounds for praise in this very life. What five? (1) ‘You have had faith in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities. (2) You have had a sense of moral shame in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities. (3) You have had moral dread in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities. (4) You have had energy in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities. (5) You have had wisdom in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities.’ Any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who lives the complete and pure spiritual life, even with pain and dejection, weeping with a tearful face, \[5\] gains these five reasonable grounds for praise in this very life.”
