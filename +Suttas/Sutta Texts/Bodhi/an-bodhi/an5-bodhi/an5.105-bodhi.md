# AN5.105 At Ease

> **Division:** I. DWELLING AT EASE

“Bhikkhus, there are these five means of dwelling at ease. What five? (1) Here, a bhikkhu maintains bodily acts of loving-kindness toward his fellow monks, both openly and privately. (2) He maintains verbal acts of loving-kindness toward his fellow monks, both openly and privately. (3) He maintains mental acts of loving-kindness toward his fellow monks, both openly and privately. (4) He dwells both openly and privately possessing in common with his fellow monks virtuous behavior that is unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unblotched, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration. (5) He dwells both openly and privately possessing in common with his fellow monks the view that is noble and emancipating, which leads one who acts upon it to the complete destruction of suffering. These, bhikkhus, are the five means of dwelling at ease.”
