# AN5.110 Forest

> **Division:** I. DWELLING AT EASE

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu is fit to resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. What five? (1) Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous … he trains in them. (2) He has learned much … and penetrated well by view. (3) He has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. (4) He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. (5) With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, \[136\] liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is fit to resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves.”

## II. ANDHAKAVINDA
