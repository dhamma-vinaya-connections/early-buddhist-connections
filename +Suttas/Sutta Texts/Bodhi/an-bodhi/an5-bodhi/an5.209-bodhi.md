# AN5.209 Intonation

> **Division:** I. KIMBILA

“Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers in reciting the Dhamma with a drawn-out, song-like intonation. What five? (1) One becomes infatuated with one’s own intonation. (2) Others become infatuated with one’s intonation. (3) Householders complain: ‘Just as we sing, so, too, do these ascetics who follow the son of the Sakyans.’ (4) There is a disruption of concentration for one wanting to refine the intonation. (5) \[Those in\] the next generation follow one’s example. These are the five dangers in reciting the Dhamma with a drawn-out, song-like intonation.”
