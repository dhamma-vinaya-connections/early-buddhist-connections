# AN5.197 Rain

> **Division:** V. DOGS

“Bhikkhus, there are these five obstacles to rain that the forecasters do not know about, where their eyes do not tread. What five?

(1) “Bhikkhus, the heat element in the upper regions of the sky becomes disturbed. Because of this, the clouds that have arisen are scattered. This is the first obstacle to rain that the forecasters do not know about, where their eyes do not tread.

(2) “Again, the air element in the upper regions of the sky becomes disturbed. Because of this, the clouds that have arisen are scattered. This is the second obstacle to rain….

(3) “Again, Rāhu the asura king receives the water with his hand and discards it into the ocean. This is the third obstacle to rain….

(4) “Again, the rain-cloud devas become heedless. This is the fourth obstacle to rain….

(5) “Again, human beings become unrighteous. This is the fifth obstacle to rain….

“These are the five obstacles to rain that the forecasters do not know about, where their eyes do not tread.”
