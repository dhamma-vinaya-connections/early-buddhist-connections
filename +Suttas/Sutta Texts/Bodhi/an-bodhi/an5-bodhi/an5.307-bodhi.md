> **Division:** III. LUST AND SO FORTH REPETITION SERIES

“Bhikkhus, for full understanding of lust … for the utter destruction … for the abandoning … for the destruction … for the vanishing … for the fading away … for the cessation … for the giving up … for the relinquishment of lust, five things are to be developed. What five? The perception of unattractiveness … \[all five sets of five as above, down to\] … The power of faith, the power of energy, the power of mindfulness, the power of concentration, and the power of wisdom. For the relinquishment of lust, these five things are to be developed.”

“Bhikkhus, for direct knowledge … for full understanding … for the utter destruction … for the abandoning … for the destruction … for the vanishing … for the fading away … for the cessation … for the giving up … for the relinquishment of hatred … of delusion … of anger … of hostility … of denigration … of insolence … of envy … of miserliness … of deceitfulness … of craftiness … of obstinacy … of vehemence … of conceit … of arrogance … of intoxication … of heedlessness, five things are to be developed. What five? The perception of unattractiveness … \[all five sets of five as above, down to\] … The power of faith, the power of energy, the power of mindfulness, the power of concentration, and the power of wisdom. For the relinquishment of heedlessness, these five things are to be developed.”

This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One’s statement.

The Book of the Fives is finished.
