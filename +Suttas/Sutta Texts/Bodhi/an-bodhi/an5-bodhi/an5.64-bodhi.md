# AN5.64 Growth (2)

> **Division:** II. PERCEPTIONS

“Bhikkhus, growing in five ways, a female noble disciple grows by a noble growth, and she absorbs the essence and the best of this life. What five? She grows in faith, virtuous behavior, learning, generosity, and wisdom. Growing in these five ways, a female noble disciple grows by a noble growth, and she absorbs the essence and the best of this life.”

She who grows in faith and virtuous behavior,

in wisdom, generosity, and learning—

such a virtuous female lay follower

absorbs for herself the essence of this life. \[81\]
