# AN5.40 Sal Trees

> **Division:** IV. SUMANĀ

“Bhikkhus, based on the Himalayas, the king of mountains, great sal trees grow in five ways. What five? (1) They grow in branches, leaves, and foliage; (2) they grow in bark; (3) they grow in shoots; (4) they grow in softwood; and (5) they grow in heartwood. Based on the Himalayas, the king of mountains, great sal trees grow in these five ways.

“So too, when the head of the family is endowed with faith, the people in the family who depend on him grow in five ways. What five? (1) They grow in faith; (2) they grow in virtuous behavior; (3) they grow in learning; (4) they grow in generosity; and (5) they grow in wisdom. When the head of a family is endowed with faith, the people in the family who depend on him grow in these five ways.”

Just as the trees that grow

in dependence on a rocky mountain

in a vast forest wilderness

might become great ‘woodland lords,’

so, when the head of a family here

possesses faith and virtue,

his wife, children, and relatives

all grow in dependence on him;

so too his companions, his family circle,

and those dependent on him.

Those possessed of discernment,

seeing that virtuous man’s good conduct,

his generosity and good deeds,

emulate his example.

Having lived here in accord with Dhamma,

the path leading to a good destination,

those who desire sensual pleasures rejoice,

delighting in the deva world. \[45\]
