# AN5.218 Not Inspiring Confidence (2)

> **Division:** II. ONE WHO INSULTS

“Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers in conduct that does not inspire confidence. What five? \[256\] Those without confidence do not gain confidence; some of those with confidence change their minds; the teaching of the Teacher is not carried out; \[those in\] the next generation follow one’s example; and one’s own mind does not become placid. These are the five dangers in conduct that does not inspire confidence.

“Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits in conduct that inspires confidence. What five? Those without confidence gain confidence; those with confidence increase \[in their confidence\]; the teaching of the Teacher is carried out; \[those in\] the next generation follow one’s example; and one’s own mind becomes placid. These are the five benefits in conduct that inspires confidence.”
