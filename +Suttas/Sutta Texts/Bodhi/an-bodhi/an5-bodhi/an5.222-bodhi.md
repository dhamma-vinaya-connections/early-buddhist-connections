# AN5.222 Lengthy Wandering (2)

> **Division:** III. LENGTHY WANDERING

“Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers for one who engages in lengthy and unsettled wandering. What five? One does not achieve what one has not yet achieved; one falls away from what one has already achieved; one is timid about some things one has achieved; one contracts a severe illness; and one has no friends. These are the five dangers for one who engages in lengthy and unsettled wandering.

“Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits in periodic wandering. What five? One achieves what one has not yet achieved; one does not fall away from what one has already achieved; one is confident about the portion that one has achieved; one does not contract a severe illness; and one has friends. These are the five benefits in periodic wandering.” \[258\]
