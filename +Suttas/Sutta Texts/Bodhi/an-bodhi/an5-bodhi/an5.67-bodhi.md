> **Division:** II. PERCEPTIONS

“Bhikkhus, when any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī develops and cultivates five things, one of two fruits is to be expected: \[82\] either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning. What five?

“(1) Here, a bhikkhu develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to desire and activities of striving. (2) He develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to energy and activities of striving. (3) He develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to mind and activities of striving. (4) He develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to investigation and activities of striving. (5) Enthusiasm itself is the fifth.

“When, bhikkhus, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī develops and cultivates these five things, one of two fruits is to be expected: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.”
