# AN5.249 A Charnel Ground

> **Division:** V. MISCONDUCT

“Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers in a charnel ground. What five? It is impure, foul-smelling, dangerous, the abode of wild spirits, \[a place where\] many people weep. These are the five dangers in a charnel ground. So too, there are these five dangers in a person who is similar to a charnel ground. What five? \[269\]

(1) “Here, some person engages in impure bodily, verbal, and mental action. This, I say, is how he is impure. Just as that charnel ground is impure, I say this person is similarly so.

(2) “Since he engages in impure bodily, verbal, and mental action, he acquires a bad reputation. This, I say, is how he is foul-smelling. Just as that charnel ground is foul-smelling, I say this person is similarly so.

(3) “Since he engages in impure bodily, verbal, and mental action, his well-behaved fellow monks avoid him from afar. This, I say, is how he is \[regarded as\] dangerous. Just as that charnel ground is \[regarded as\] dangerous, I say this person is similarly so.

(4) “Engaging in impure bodily, verbal, and mental action, he dwells together with persons similar to himself. This, I say, is how he is an abode of wild \[persons\]. Just as that charnel ground is an abode of wild spirits, I say this person is similarly so.

(5) “Having seen him engaging in impure bodily, verbal, and mental action, his well-behaved fellow monks lodge complaints about him, saying: ‘Oh, what misery it is for us to live together with such persons!’ This, I say, is how there is weeping over him. Just as that charnel ground is \[a place where\] many people weep, I say this person is similarly so.

“These, bhikkhus, are the five dangers in a person who is like a charnel ground.” \[270\]
