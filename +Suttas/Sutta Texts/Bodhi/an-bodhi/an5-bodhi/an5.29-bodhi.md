# AN5.29 Walking Meditation

> **Division:** III. FIVE FACTORED

“Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits of walking meditation. What five? \[30\] One becomes capable of journeys; one becomes capable of striving; one becomes healthy; what one has eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted is properly digested; the concentration attained through walking meditation is long lasting. These are the five benefits of walking meditation.”
