One becomes miserly with dwelling places, miserly with families, miserly with gains, miserly with praise, and miserly with the Dhamma. These are the five dangers in residing too long \[in the same place\].

“Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits in residing for a balanced period \[in the same place\]. What five? One does not become miserly with dwelling places, miserly with families, miserly with gains, miserly with praise, and miserly with the Dhamma. These are the five benefits in residing for a balanced period \[in the same place\].”
