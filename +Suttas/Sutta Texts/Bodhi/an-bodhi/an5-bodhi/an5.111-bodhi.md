# AN5.111 A Visitor of Families

> **Division:** II. ANDHAKAVINDA

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu who is a visitor of families is displeasing and disagreeable to them and is neither respected nor esteemed by them. What five? (1) He presumes intimacy upon mere acquaintance; (2) he distributes things that he does not own; (3) he consorts with those who are divided; (4) he whispers in the ear; and (5) he makes excessive requests. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu who is a visitor of families is displeasing and disagreeable to them and is neither respected nor esteemed by them.
