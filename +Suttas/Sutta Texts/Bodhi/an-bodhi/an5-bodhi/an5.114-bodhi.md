# AN5.114 Andhakavinda

> **Division:** II. ANDHAKAVINDA

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Magadhans at Andhakavinda. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

“Ānanda, those bhikkhus who are newcomers, who have recently gone forth, who have just come to this Dhamma and discipline, should be encouraged, settled, and established by you in five things. What five?

(1) “They should be encouraged, settled, and established in the restraint of the Pātimokkha thus: ‘Come, friends, be virtuous; dwell restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, train in them.’

(2) “They should be encouraged, settled, and established in the restraint of the sense faculties thus: ‘Come, friends, guard the doors of the sense faculties; take mindfulness as protector; be mindful and alert, possessing a protected mind, a mind under the protection of mindfulness.’

(3) “They should be encouraged, settled, and established in limiting their speech thus: ‘Come, friends, do not talk much. Put limits on your speech.’

(4) “They should be encouraged, settled, and established in bodily seclusion thus: ‘Come, friends, be forest dwellers. Resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves.’

(5) “They should be encouraged, settled, and established in a correct perspective thus: ‘Come, friends, hold right view and have a correct perspective.’ \[139\]

“Ānanda, those bhikkhus who are newcomers, who have recently gone forth, who have just come to this Dhamma and discipline, should be encouraged, settled, and established by you in these five things.”
