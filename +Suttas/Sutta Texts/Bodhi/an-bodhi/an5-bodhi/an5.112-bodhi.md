# AN5.112 An Attendant Monk

> **Division:** II. ANDHAKAVINDA

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, someone should not be taken along as an attendant monk. What five? (1) He walks too far behind or too close; (2) he does not take your bowl when it is full; (3) he does not restrain you when your speech is bordering on an offense; (4) he keeps on interrupting you while you are speaking; and (5) he is unwise, stupid, obtuse. Possessing these five qualities, someone should not be taken along as an attendant monk.

“Bhikkhus, possessing five \[other\] qualities, someone may be taken along as an attendant monk. What five?

Possessing these five qualities, someone may be taken along as an attendant monk.”
