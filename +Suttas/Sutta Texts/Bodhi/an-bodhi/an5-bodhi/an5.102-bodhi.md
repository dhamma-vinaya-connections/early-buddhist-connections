# AN5.102 Suspected

> **Division:** I. DWELLING AT EASE

“Bhikkhus, on five grounds a bhikkhu is suspected and distrusted as ‘an evil bhikkhu’ though he be of unshakable character. What five? Here, a bhikkhu often visits prostitutes, widows, unmarried women, eunuchs, or bhikkhunīs. On these five grounds a bhikkhu is suspected and distrusted as ‘an evil bhikkhu’ though he be of unshakable character.”
