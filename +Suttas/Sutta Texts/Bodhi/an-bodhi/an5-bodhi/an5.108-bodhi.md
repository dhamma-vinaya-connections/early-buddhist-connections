# AN5.108 One Beyond Training

> **Division:** I. DWELLING AT EASE

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts … an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What five? Here, a bhikkhu possesses the aggregate of virtuous behavior of one beyond training, the aggregate of concentration of one beyond training, the aggregate of wisdom of one beyond training, the aggregate of liberation of one beyond training, the aggregate of the knowledge and vision of liberation of one beyond training. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts … an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.” \[135\]
