# AN5.214 Speaking Much

> **Division:** II. ONE WHO INSULTS

“Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers for a person who speaks much. What five? He speaks falsely; he speaks divisively; he speaks harshly; he speaks idle chatter; with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. These are the five dangers for a person who speaks much.

“Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits for a person of judicious speech. What five? He does not speak falsely; he does not speak divisively; he does not speak harshly; he does not speak idle chatter; with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. These are the five benefits for a person of judicious speech.”
