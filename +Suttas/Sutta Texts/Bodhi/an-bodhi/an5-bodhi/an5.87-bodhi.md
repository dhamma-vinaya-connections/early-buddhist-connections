# AN5.87 Virtuous

> **Division:** IV. ELDERS

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, an elder bhikkhu is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them. What five?

(1) “He is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them.

(2) “He has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, \[114\] and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life—such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, mentally investigated, and penetrated well by view.

(3) “He is a good speaker with a good delivery; he is gifted with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning.

(4) “He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life.

(5) “With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.

“Possessing these five qualities, bhikkhus, an elder bhikkhu is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them.”
