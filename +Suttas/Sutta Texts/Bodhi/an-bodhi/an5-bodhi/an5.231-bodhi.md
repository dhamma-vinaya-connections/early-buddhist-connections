# AN5.231 Not to Be Esteemed

> **Division:** IV. RESIDENT

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a resident bhikkhu is not to be esteemed. What five? (1) He is not accomplished in manners and duties; (2) he is not learned or an expert in learning; (3) he is not given to effacement nor is he one who delights in seclusion; (4) he is not a good speaker and he lacks a good delivery; (5) he is unwise, stupid, and obtuse. Possessing these five qualities, a resident bhikkhu is not to be esteemed.
