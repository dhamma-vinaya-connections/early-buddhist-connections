# AN5.235 Compassionate

> **Division:** IV. RESIDENT

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a resident bhikkhu shows compassion to laypeople. What five? (1) He encourages them in regard to virtuous behavior. (2) He settles them in the vision of the Dhamma. (3) When they are ill he approaches them and arouses mindfulness in them, saying: \[264\] ‘Let the honorable ones establish mindfulness on that which is worthy.’ (4) When a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus has arrived, including bhikkhus from various states, he approaches laypeople and informs them: ‘Friends, a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus has arrived including bhikkhus from various states. Make merit. It is an occasion to make merit.’ (5) He himself eats whatever food they give him, whether coarse or excellent; he does not squander what has been given out of faith. Possessing these five qualities, a resident bhikkhu shows compassion to laypeople.”
