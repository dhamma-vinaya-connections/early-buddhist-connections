# AN5.221 Lengthy Wandering (1)

> **Division:** III. LENGTHY WANDERING

“Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers for one who engages in lengthy and unsettled wandering. What five? One does not hear what one has not heard; one does not clarify what one has heard; one is not confident about the portion that one has heard; one contracts a severe illness; and one has no friends. These are the five dangers for one who engages in lengthy and unsettled wandering.

“Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits in periodic wandering. What five? One gets to hear what one has not heard; one clarifies what one has heard; one is confident about some things one has heard; one does not contract a severe illness; and one has friends. These are the five benefits in periodic wandering.”
