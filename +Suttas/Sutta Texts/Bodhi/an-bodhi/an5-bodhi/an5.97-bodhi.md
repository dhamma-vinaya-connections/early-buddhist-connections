# AN5.97 Talk

> **Division:** V. KAKUDHA

“Bhikkhus, possessing five things, a bhikkhu developing mindfulness of breathing in no long time penetrates to the unshakable. What five? (1) Here, a bhikkhu has few undertakings … (2) He eats little … (3) He is seldom drowsy … \[121\] (4) He gets to hear at will, without trouble or difficulty, talk concerned with the austere life that is conducive to opening up the heart, that is, talk on fewness of desires, on contentment, on solitude, on not getting bound up \[with others\], on arousing energy, on virtuous behavior, on concentration, on wisdom, on liberation, on the knowledge and vision of liberation. (5) He reviews the extent to which his mind is liberated. Possessing these five things, a bhikkhu developing mindfulness of breathing in no long time penetrates to the unshakable.”
