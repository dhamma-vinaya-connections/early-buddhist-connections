# AN5.152 The Fixed Course of Rightness (2)

> **Division:** I. THE GOOD DHAMMA

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, even while listening to the good Dhamma one is incapable of entering upon the fixed course \[consisting in\] rightness in wholesome qualities. What five? One disparages the talk; one disparages the speaker; one disparages oneself; one is unwise, stupid, obtuse; one imagines that one has understood what one has not understood. Possessing these five qualities, even while listening to the good Dhamma one is incapable of entering upon the fixed course \[consisting in\] rightness in wholesome qualities.

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, while listening to the good Dhamma one is capable of entering upon the fixed course \[consisting in\] rightness in wholesome qualities. What five? One does not disparage the talk; one does not disparage the speaker; one does not disparage oneself; one is wise, intelligent, astute; one does not imagine that one has understood what one has not understood. Possessing these five qualities, while listening to the good Dhamma one is capable of entering upon the fixed course \[consisting in\] rightness in wholesome qualities.”
