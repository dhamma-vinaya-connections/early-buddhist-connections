# AN5.151 The Fixed Course of Rightness (1)

> **Division:** I. THE GOOD DHAMMA

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, even while listening to the good Dhamma one is incapable of entering upon the fixed course \[consisting in\] rightness in wholesome qualities. What five? One disparages the talk; one disparages the speaker; one disparages oneself; one listens to the Dhamma with a distracted and scattered mind; one attends to it carelessly. Possessing these five qualities, even while listening to the good Dhamma one is incapable of entering upon the fixed course \[consisting in\] rightness in wholesome qualities.

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, while listening to \[175\] the good Dhamma one is capable of entering upon the fixed course \[consisting in\] rightness in wholesome qualities. What five? One does not disparage the talk; one does not disparage the speaker; one does not disparage oneself; one listens to the Dhamma with an undistracted and one-pointed mind; one attends to it carefully. Possessing these five qualities, while listening to the good Dhamma one is capable of entering upon the fixed course \[consisting in\] rightness in wholesome qualities.”
