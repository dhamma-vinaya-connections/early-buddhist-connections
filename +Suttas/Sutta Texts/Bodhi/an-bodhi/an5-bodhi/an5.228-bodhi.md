# AN5.228 A Meal

> **Division:** III. LENGTHY WANDERING

“Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers for a family that prepares their meal late in the day. What five? (1) Guests who are visiting are not served on time. (2) The deities that receive oblations are not served on time. (3) Ascetics and brahmins who eat once a day and refrain from eating at night, abstaining from meals outside the proper time, are not served on time. (4) Slaves, workers, and servants grimace when they do their work. (5) Much of a poorly timed meal is not nutritious. These are the five dangers for a family that prepares their meal late in the day.
