# AN5.182-190 Wearers of Rag-Robes, Etc.

> **Division:** IV. FOREST DWELLERS

“Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of wearers of rag-robes … these five who dwell at the foot of a tree … \[220\] … these five who dwell in a charnel ground … these five who dwell in the open air … these five who observe the sitter’s practice … these five who observe the any-bed-user’s practice … these five who observe the one-session practice … these five who observe the later-food-refuser’s practice … these five who observe the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl. What five? (1) One who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl because of his dullness and stupidity; (2) one who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl because he has evil desires, because he is driven by desire; (3) one who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl because he is mad and mentally deranged; (4) one who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl, \[thinking\]: ‘It is praised by the Buddhas and Buddhas’ disciples’; (5) and one who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl for the sake of fewness of desires, for the sake of contentment, for the sake of eliminating \[defilements\], for the sake of solitude, for the sake of simplicity. These are the five who observe the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl. One who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl for the sake of fewness of desires … for the sake of simplicity, is the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the finest of these five who observe the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl.

“Just as, bhikkhus, from a cow comes milk, from milk comes curd, from curd comes butter, from butter comes ghee, and from ghee comes cream-of-ghee, which is reckoned the foremost of all these, so this one who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl \[221\] for the sake of fewness of desires … for the sake of simplicity, is the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the finest of these five who observe the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl.”
