# AN5.80 Future Perils (4)

> **Division:** III. FUTURE PERILS

“Bhikkhus, there are these five future perils as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize them and make an effort to abandon them. What five?

(1) “In the future, there will be bhikkhus who desire fine robes. They will give up the use of rag robes, give up remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves, and having converged upon the villages, towns, and capital cities, will take up their residence there; and they will engage in many kinds of wrong and improper searches for the sake of a robe. This is the first future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize it and make an effort to abandon it. \[109\]

(2) “Again, in the future there will be bhikkhus who desire fine almsfood. They will give up going on alms round, give up remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves, and having converged upon the villages, towns, and capital cities, will take up their residence there, seeking the finest delicacies with the tips of their tongues; and they will engage in many kinds of wrong and improper searches for the sake of almsfood. This is the second future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize it and make an effort to abandon it.

(3) “Again, in the future there will be bhikkhus who desire fine lodgings. They will give up dwelling at the foot of a tree, will give up remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves, and having converged upon the villages, towns, and capital cities, will take up their residence there; and they will engage in many kinds of wrong and improper searches for the sake of lodgings. This is the third future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize it and make an effort to abandon it.

(4) “Again, in the future there will be bhikkhus who bond closely with bhikkhunīs, female probationers, and novices. When they form such close bonds, it can be expected that they will live the spiritual life dissatisfied, commit a certain defiled offense, or give up the training and revert to the lower life. This is the fourth future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize it and make an effort to abandon it.

(5) “Again, in the future there will be bhikkhus who bond closely with monastery workers and novices. When they form such close bonds, it can be expected that they will engage in the use of various kinds of stored-up goods \[110\] and give gross hints in regard to the ground and vegetation. This is the fifth future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize it and make an effort to abandon it.

“These, bhikkhus, are the five future perils as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize them and make an effort to abandon them.”
