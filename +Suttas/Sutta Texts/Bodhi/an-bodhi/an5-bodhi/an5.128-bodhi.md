# AN5.128 An Ascetic’s Happiness

> **Division:** III. SICK

“Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of suffering for an ascetic. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is not content with any kind of robe; he is not content with any kind of almsfood; he is not content with any kind of lodging; he is not content with any kind of medicines and provisions for the sick; and he lives the spiritual life dissatisfied. These are the five kinds of suffering for an ascetic.
