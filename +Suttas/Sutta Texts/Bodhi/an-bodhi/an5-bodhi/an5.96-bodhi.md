# AN5.96 What One Has Learned

> **Division:** V. KAKUDHA

“Bhikkhus, possessing five things, a bhikkhu pursuing mindfulness of breathing in no long time penetrates to the unshakable. What five? (1) Here, a bhikkhu has few undertakings, few tasks, is easy to support, and is easily contented with the requisites of life. (2) He eats little and is intent on abstemiousness regarding food. (3) He is seldom drowsy and is intent on vigilance. (4) He has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life—such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, mentally investigated, and penetrated well by view. (5) He reviews the extent to which his mind is liberated. Possessing these five things, a bhikkhu pursuing mindfulness of breathing in no long time penetrates to the unshakable.”
