# AN5.132 Continuing to Turn the Wheel (2)

> **Division:** IV. KINGS

“Bhikkhus, possessing five factors, the eldest son of a wheel-turning monarch continues, solely through the Dhamma, to turn the wheel set in motion by his father, a wheel that cannot be turned back by any hostile creature in human form. What five? Here, the eldest son of a wheel-turning monarch is one who knows what is good, who knows the Dhamma, who knows the right measure, who knows the proper time, and who knows the assembly. Possessing these five factors, the eldest son of a wheel-turning monarch continues, solely through the Dhamma, to turn the wheel set in motion by his father, a wheel that cannot be turned back by any hostile creature in human form. \[149\]

“So too, bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, Sāriputta continues, solely through the Dhamma, to turn the unsurpassed wheel of the Dhamma set in motion by the Tathāgata, a wheel that cannot be turned back by any ascetic, brahmin, deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world. What five? Here, Sāriputta is one who knows what is good, who knows the Dhamma, who knows the right measure, who knows the proper time, and who knows the assembly. Possessing these five qualities, Sāriputta continues, solely through the Dhamma, to turn the unsurpassed wheel of the Dhamma set in motion by the Tathāgata, a wheel that cannot be turned back by any ascetic, brahmin, deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world.”
