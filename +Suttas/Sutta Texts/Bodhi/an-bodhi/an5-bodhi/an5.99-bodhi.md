# AN5.99 The Lion

> **Division:** V. KAKUDHA

“Bhikkhus, in the evening the lion, the king of beasts, comes out from his lair, stretches his body, surveys the four quarters all around, and roars his lion’s roar three times. Then he sets out in search of game.

(1) “If he gives a blow to an elephant, he always gives the blow respectfully, not disrespectfully. (2) If he gives a blow to a buffalo … (3) … to a cow … (4) … to a leopard … (5) If he gives a blow \[122\] to any smaller animals, even a hare or a cat, he gives the blow respectfully, not disrespectfully. For what reason? \[Thinking:\] ‘Let my training not be lost.’

“The lion, bhikkhus, is a designation for the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. When the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma to an assembly, this is his lion’s roar. (1) If the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma to bhikkhus, he teaches it respectfully, not disrespectfully. (2) If the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma to bhikkhunīs … (3) … to male lay followers … (4) … to female lay followers, he teaches it respectfully, not disrespectfully. (5) If the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma to worldlings, even to food-carriers and hunters, he teaches it respectfully, not disrespectfully. For what reason? Because the Tathāgata has respect for the Dhamma, reverence for the Dhamma.”
