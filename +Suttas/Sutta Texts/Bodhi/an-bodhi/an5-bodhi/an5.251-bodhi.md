# AN5.251 Who May Give Full Ordination

> **Division:** I. FULL ORDINATION

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu may give full ordination. What five? Here, a bhikkhu possesses the aggregate of virtuous behavior of one beyond training; he possesses the aggregate of concentration of one beyond training; he possesses the aggregate of wisdom of one beyond training; he possesses the aggregate of liberation of one beyond training; he possesses the aggregate of the knowledge and vision of liberation of one beyond training. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu may give full ordination.”
