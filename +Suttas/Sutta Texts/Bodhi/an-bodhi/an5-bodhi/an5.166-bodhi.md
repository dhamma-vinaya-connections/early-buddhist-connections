# AN5.166 Cessation

> **Division:** II. RESENTMENT

There the Venerable Sāriputta … said this:

“Here, friends, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom might enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility. But if he does not reach final knowledge in this very life, having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made \[deities\] that transcend the company of devas that subsist on edible food, he might \[again\] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility.”

When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Venerable Sāriputta: “This is impossible, friend Sāriputta, it cannot happen that a bhikkhu, having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made \[deities\] that transcend the company of devas that subsist on edible food, might \[again\] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is no such possibility.”

A second time … A third time, \[193\] the Venerable Sāriputta said: “Here, friends, it is possible that a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior … having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made \[deities\] … might \[again\] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility.” A third time, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Venerable Sāriputta: “This is impossible, friend Sāriputta, it cannot happen that a bhikkhu, having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made \[deities\] … might \[again\] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is no such possibility.”

Then it occurred to the Venerable Sāriputta: “The Venerable Udāyī has rejected me up to the third time, and not a single bhikkhu expresses agreement with me. Let me approach the Blessed One.” Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and addressed the bhikkhus: “Here, friends, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom might \[again\] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility. If he does not reach final knowledge in this very life, having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made \[deities\] that transcend the company of devas that subsist on edible food, he might \[again\] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility.”

When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Venerable Sāriputta: “This is impossible, friend Sāriputta, it cannot happen that a bhikkhu, having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made \[deities\] transcending the company of devas that subsist on edible food, might \[again\] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is no such possibility.”

A second time … A third time, the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: “Here, friends, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior … \[194\] … having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made \[deities\] … might \[again\] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility.” A third time, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Venerable Sāriputta: “This is impossible, friend Sāriputta, it cannot happen that a bhikkhu … reborn among a certain group of mind-made \[deities\] … might \[again\] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is no such possibility.”

Then it occurred to the Venerable Sāriputta: “Even when I am in the presence of the Blessed One, the Venerable Udāyī rejects me up to the third time, and not a single bhikkhu expresses agreement with me. Let me just keep silent.” Then the Venerable Sāriputta fell silent.

Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Udāyī: “Udāyī, just what do you understand by a mind-made group?”

“Bhante, it is those devas that are formless, perceptionmade.”

“What are you saying, Udāyī, you foolish and incompetent fellow? Yet you think you have to speak up!”

Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, do you just look on passively as an elder bhikkhu is being harassed? Don’t you have any compassion toward an elder bhikkhu when he’s being harassed?”

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom might enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. If he does not reach final knowledge in this very life, then, having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made \[deities\] that transcend the company of devas that subsist on edible food, he might \[again\] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility.” This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. \[195\]

Then, not long after the Blessed One had left, the Venerable Ānanda approached the Venerable Upavāṇa and said to him: “Here, friend Upavāṇa, they were harassing other elder bhikkhus, but we didn’t question them. It would not be surprising if this evening, when he emerges from seclusion, the Blessed One makes a pronouncement about this matter, and he might call upon the Venerable Upavāṇa himself \[to give an account\]. Just now I feel timid.”

Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the meeting hall. He sat down in the appointed seat and said to the Venerable Upavāṇa:

“Upavāṇa, how many qualities should an elder bhikkhu possess to be pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and to be respected and esteemed by them?”

“Possessing five qualities, Bhante, an elder bhikkhu is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them. What five? (1) He is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha … \[as in 5:134\] … he trains in them. (2) He has learned much … \[as in 5:134\] … he has penetrated well by view. (3) He is a good speaker with a good delivery; he is gifted with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning. (4) He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. (5) With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. Possessing these five qualities, an elder is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them.” \[196\]

“Good, good, Upavāṇa! Possessing those five qualities, an elder is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them. But if these five qualities are not found in an elder bhikkhu, why should his fellow monks honor, respect, esteem, and venerate him? On account of his broken teeth, grey hair, and wrinkled skin? But because these five qualities are found in an elder bhikkhu, his fellow monks honor, respect, esteem, and venerate him.”
