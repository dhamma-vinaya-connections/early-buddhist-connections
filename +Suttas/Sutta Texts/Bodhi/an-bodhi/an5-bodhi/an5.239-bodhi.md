> **Division:** IV. RESIDENT

“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a resident bhikkhu is deposited in hell as if brought there. What five? (1) He is miserly with regard to dwellings. (2) He is miserly with regard to families. (3) He is miserly with regard to gains. (4) He is miserly with regard to praise. (5) He squanders what has been given out of faith. Possessing these five qualities, a resident bhikkhu is deposited in hell as if brought there.
