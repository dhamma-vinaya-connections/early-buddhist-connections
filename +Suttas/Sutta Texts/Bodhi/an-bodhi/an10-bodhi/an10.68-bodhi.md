# AN10.68 Naḷakapāna (2)

> **Division:** II. PAIRS

\[Opening as in 10:67, down to:\] \[126\]

The Venerable Sāriputta then addressed the bhikkhus: “Friends, bhikkhus!”

“Friend!” those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

“Friends, for one (1) who does not have faith in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities, (2) who does not have a sense of moral shame … (3) who does not have moral dread … (4) who does not have energy … (5) who does not have wisdom … (6) who does not lend an ear … (7) who does not retain the Dhamma in mind … (8) who does not examine the meaning … (9) who does not practice in accordance with the Dhamma … (10) who is not heedful in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities, whether night or day comes, only deterioration and not growth in wholesome qualities is to be expected. Just as, during the dark fortnight, whether night or day comes, the moon only deteriorates in beauty, roundness, and brightness, in diameter and circumference, so too, for one who does not have faith in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities … for one who is not heedful in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities, whether night or day comes, only deterioration and not growth in wholesome qualities is to be expected.

“Friends, for one (1) who has faith in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities, (2) who has a sense of moral shame … (3) who has moral dread … (4) who has energy … (5) who has wisdom … (6) who lends an ear … (7) who retains the Dhamma in mind … (8) who examines the meaning … (9) who practices in accordance with the Dhamma … (10) who is heedful \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities, whether night or day comes, only growth and not deterioration in wholesome qualities is to be expected. Just as, \[127\] during the bright fortnight, whether night or day comes, the moon only increases in beauty, roundness, and brightness, in diameter and circumference, so too, for one who has faith in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities … heedfulness in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities, whether night or day comes, only growth and not deterioration in wholesome qualities is to be expected.”

Then the Blessed One got up and addressed the Venerable Sāriputta: “Good, good, Sāriputta! Sāriputta, for one who does not have faith in \[cultivating\] wholesome qualities … \[the Buddha here repeats Sāriputta’s entire discourse down to:\] \[128\] … whether night or day comes, only growth and not deterioration in wholesome qualities is to be expected.”
