# AN10.177 Jāṇussoṇī

> **Division:** II. JĀṆUSSOṆĪ

Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇī approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

“Master Gotama, we brahmins give gifts and perform the memorial rites for the dead with the thought: ‘Let our gift be of benefit to our departed relatives and family members. Let our departed relatives and family members partake of our gift.’ Can our gift, Master Gotama, actually be of benefit to our departed relatives and family members? Can our departed relatives and family members actually partake of our gift?”

“On a right occasion, brahmin, it can be of benefit, not on a wrong occasion.”

“But, Master Gotama, what is a right occasion and what is a wrong occasion?”

“Here, brahmin, someone destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsehood, speaks divisively, speaks harshly, indulges in idle chatter; he is full of longing, has a mind of ill will, and holds wrong view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in hell. He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of the hell-beings. This is a wrong occasion, when the gift is not of benefit to one living there.

“Someone else destroys life … and holds wrong view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the animal realm. He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of animals. This, too, is a wrong occasion, when the gift is not of benefit to one living there.

“Still another abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, from divisive \[270\] speech, from harsh speech, from idle chatter; he is without longing, of good will, and holds right view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with human beings. He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of human beings. This, too, is a wrong occasion, when the gift is not of benefit to one living there.

“Still another abstains from the destruction of life … and holds right view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the devas. He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of devas. This, too, is a wrong occasion, when the gift is not of benefit to one living there.

“Still another destroys life … and holds wrong view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the sphere of afflicted spirits. He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of afflicted spirits, or else he sustains himself there on what his friends, companions, relatives, or family members in this world offer to him. This is a right occasion, when the gift is of benefit to one living there.”

“But, Master Gotama, who partakes of the gift if that deceased relative or family member has not been reborn in that place?”

“Other departed relatives or family members who have been reborn in that place partake of the gift.”

“But, Master Gotama, who partakes of the gift if neither that deceased relative or family member nor any others have been reborn in that place?”

“Over this long stretch of time \[in saṃsāra\], brahmin, it is impossible and inconceivable for that place to be devoid of \[271\] one’s departed relatives and family members. Further, for the donor too it is not fruitless.”

“Does Master Gotama posit \[the value of giving\] even on the wrong occasion?”

“Brahmin, I posit \[the value of giving\] even on the wrong occasion.

“Here, brahmin, someone destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsehood, speaks divisively, speaks harshly, indulges in idle chatter; he is full of longing, has a mind of ill will, and holds wrong view. He gives an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink; clothing and a vehicle; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, dwellings, and lighting. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with elephants. There he gains food and drink, garlands and various ornaments.

“Since he here destroyed life … and held wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with elephants. But since he gave an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink … he there gains food and drink, garlands and various ornaments.

“Someone else destroys life … and holds wrong view. He gives an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink … and lighting. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with horses … cattle … dogs. There he gains food and drink, garlands and various ornaments.

“Since he here destroyed life … \[272\] … and held wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with horses … cattle … dogs. But since he gave an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink … he there gains food and drink, garlands and various ornaments.

“Still another abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, from divisive speech, from harsh speech, from idle chatter; he is without longing, of good will, and holds right view. He gives an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink; clothing and a vehicle; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, dwellings, and lighting. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with human beings. There he gains the five objects of human sensual pleasure.

“Since he here abstained from the destruction of life … and held right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with human beings. And since he gave an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink … he there gains the five objects of human sensual pleasure.

“Still another abstains from the destruction of life … and holds right view. He gives an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink … and lighting. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the devas. There \[273\] he gains the five objects of celestial sensual pleasure.

“Since he here abstained from the destruction of life … and held right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the devas. And since he gave an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink … he there gains the five objects of celestial sensual pleasure. \[That is why I said:\] ‘Further, for the donor too it is not fruitless.’”

“It’s astounding and amazing, Master Gotama, that there is reason to give gifts and perform the memorial rites for the dead, since for the donor too it is not fruitless.”

“So it is, brahmin! So it is, brahmin! For the donor too it is not fruitless.”

“Excellent, Master Gotama! … Let Master Gotama accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”
