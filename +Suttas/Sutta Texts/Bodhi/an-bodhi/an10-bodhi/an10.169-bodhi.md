# AN10.169 Saṅgārava

> **Division:** II. JĀṆUSSOṆĪ

Then the brahmin Saṅgārava approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

“Master Gotama, what is the near shore? What is the far shore?”

“Brahmin, (1) the destruction of life is the near shore, abstention from the destruction of life the far shore. (2) Taking what is not given is the near shore, abstention from taking what is not given the far shore. (3) Sexual misconduct is the near shore, abstention from sexual misconduct the far shore. (4) False speech is the near shore, abstention from false speech the far shore. (5) Divisive speech is the near shore, abstention from divisive speech the far shore. (6) Harsh speech is the near shore, abstention from harsh speech the far shore. (7) Idle chatter is the near shore, abstention from idle chatter the far shore. (8) Longing is the near shore, non-longing the far shore. (9) Ill will is the near shore, good will the far shore. (10) Wrong view is the near shore, right view the far shore. The one, brahmin, is the near shore, the other the far shore.” \[253\]

Few are those people

who go beyond.

The rest merely run

along the \[near\] shore.

When the Dhamma is rightly expounded

those people who practice accordingly

are the ones who will go beyond

the realm of Death so hard to cross.

Having left the dark qualities behind,

a wise person should develop the bright ones.

Having come from home into homelessness,

where it is hard to take delight—

There in seclusion one should seek delight,

having left behind sensual pleasures.

Owning nothing, the wise person

should cleanse himself of mental defilements.

Those whose minds are rightly well developed

in the enlightenment factors,

who through non-clinging find delight

in the relinquishment of grasping:

luminous, with taints destroyed,

they are the quenched ones in the world.
