> **Division:** IV. GOOD

(135) “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the noble Dhamma and the ignoble Dhamma … (136) … the wholesome and the unwholesome … (137) … what is beneficial and what is harmful … \[242\] … (138) … the Dhamma and what is non-Dhamma … (139) … the tainted Dhamma and the taintless one … (140) … the blameworthy Dhamma and the blameless one … \[243\] (141) … the tormenting Dhamma and the untormenting one … (142) … the Dhamma that leads to building up and the one that leads to dismantling … (143) … the Dhamma with suffering as its outcome and the one with happiness as its outcome … \[244\] (144) … the Dhamma that results in suffering and the one that results in happiness….

“And what, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma that results in suffering? Wrong view … and wrong liberation. This is called the Dhamma that results in suffering.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma that results in happiness? Right view … and right liberation. This is called the Dhamma that results in happiness.”
