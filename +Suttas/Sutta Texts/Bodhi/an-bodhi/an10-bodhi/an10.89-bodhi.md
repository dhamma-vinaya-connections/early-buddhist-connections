# AN10.89 Kokālika

> **Division:** IV. THE ELDERS

Then the bhikkhu Kokālika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: “Bhante, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires and have come under the control of evil desires.”

\[The Blessed One replied:\] “Do not say so, Kokālika! Do not say so, Kokālika! Place confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, Kokālika. Sāriputta and Moggallāna are well behaved.”

A second time the bhikkhu Kokālika said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, although I consider the Blessed One worthy of faith and trust, \[I still say that\] Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires and have come under the control of evil desires.”

“Do not say so, Kokālika! … Sāriputta and Moggallāna are well behaved.”

A third time the bhikkhu Kokālika said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, although I consider the Blessed One worthy of faith and trust, \[I still say that\] Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires and have come under the control of evil desires.”

“Do not say so, Kokālika! Do not say so, Kokālika! Place confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, Kokālika. Sāriputta and Moggallāna are well behaved.”

Then the bhikkhu Kokālika rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated the Blessed One keeping the right side toward him, and departed. Not long after the bhikkhu Kokālika had left, his entire body became covered with boils the size of mustard seeds. These then grew to the size of mung beans; then to the size of chickpeas; then to the size of jujube pits; then to the size of jujube fruits; then to the size of myrobalans; then to the size of unripe _belli_ fruits; then to the size of ripe _belli_ fruits. When they had grown to the size of ripe _belli_ fruits, they burst open, \[171\] exuding pus and blood. He then just lay on banana leaves like a fish that had swallowed poison.

Then the independent brahmā Tudu approached the bhikkhu Kokālika, stood in the air, and said to him: “Place confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, Kokālika. Sāriputta and Moggallāna are well behaved.”

“Who are you, friend?”

“I am the independent brahmā Tudu.”

“Didn’t the Blessed One declare you to be a non-returner, friend? Then why have you come back here? See how much wrong you have done.”

Then the independent brahmā Tudu addressed the bhikkhu Kokālika in verse:

“When a person has taken birth

an axe is born inside his mouth

with which the fool cuts himself

by uttering wrongful speech.

“He who praises one deserving blame

or blames one deserving praise

casts with his mouth an unlucky throw

by which he finds no happiness.

“Slight is the unlucky throw at dice

that results in the loss of one’s wealth,

\[the loss\] of all, oneself included;

much worse is this unlucky throw

of harboring hate against the holy ones.

“For a hundred thousand

and thirty-six _nirabbudas_, plus five _abbudas_,

the slanderer of noble ones goes to hell,

having defamed them with evil speech and mind.” \[172\]

Then the bhikkhu Kokālika died on account of that illness, and because of his resentment against Sāriputta and Moggallāna, after death he was reborn in the red-lotus hell.

Then, when the night had advanced, Brahmā Sahampati, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him: “Bhante, the bhikkhu Kokālika has died, and because of his resentment against Sāriputta and Moggallāna, after death he has been reborn in the red-lotus hell.” This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. He then paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and disappeared right there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, last night, when the night had advanced, Brahmā Sahampati approached me and said to me … \[as above\] … He then paid homage to me, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there.”

When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “How long, Bhante, is the life span in the red-lotus hell?”

“The life span in the red-lotus hell is long, bhikkhu. It is not easy to count it and say it is so many \[173\] years, or so many hundreds of years, or so many thousands of years, or so many hundreds of thousands of years.”

“Then is it possible, Bhante, to give a simile?”

“It is, bhikkhu,” the Blessed One said. “Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty measures of sesamum seed. At the end of every hundred years a man would remove one seed from it. In this manner the Kosalan cartload of twenty measures of sesamum seed might be depleted and eliminated more quickly than (1) a life in a single _abbuda_ hell would go by. (2) One life in the _nirabbuda_ hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the _abbuda_ hell; (3) one life in the _ababa_ hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the _nirabbuda_ hell; (4) one life in the _ahaha_ hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the _ababa_ hell; (5) one life in the _aṭaṭa_ hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the _ahaha_ hell; (6) one life in the water-lily hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the _aṭaṭa_ hell; (7) one life in the sweet-fragrance hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the water-lily hell; (8) one life in the blue-lotus hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the sweet-fragrance hell; (9) one life in the white-lotus hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the blue-lotus hell; and (10) one life in the red-lotus hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the white-lotus hell. Now, because he harbored resentment against Sāriputta and Moggallāna, the bhikkhu Kokālika has been reborn in the red-lotus hell.”

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this: \[174\]

\[The four verses are identical with those just above.\]
