“Bhikkhus, without having abandoned these ten things, one is incapable of realizing arahantship. What ten? Lust, hatred, delusion, anger, hostility, denigration, insolence, envy, miserliness, and conceit. Without having abandoned these ten things, one is incapable of realizing arahantship.

“Bhikkhus, having abandoned these ten things, one is capable of realizing arahantship. What ten? Lust … conceit. Having abandoned these ten things, one is capable of realizing arahantship.” \[210\]
