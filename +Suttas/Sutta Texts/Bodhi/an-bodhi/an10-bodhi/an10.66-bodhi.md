# AN10.66 Happiness (2)

> **Division:** II. PAIRS

On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta was dwelling among the Magadhans at Nālakagāmaka. Then the wanderer Sāmaṇḍakāni approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side \[122\] and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:

“Friend Sāriputta, what is happiness in this Dhamma and discipline, and what is suffering?”

“Dissatisfaction, friend, is suffering in this Dhamma and discipline. Enjoyment is happiness. When there is dissatisfaction, this suffering is to be expected. (1) When walking, one does not find happiness or comfort. (2) When standing still … (3) When sitting … (4) When lying down … (5) When in the village … (6) When in the forest … (7) When at the foot of a tree … (8) When in an empty hut … (9) When in the open air … (10) When amid the bhikkhus, one does not find happiness or comfort. When there is dissatisfaction, this suffering is to be expected.

“When there is enjoyment, this happiness is to be expected. (1) When walking, one finds happiness and comfort. (2) When standing still … (3) When sitting … (4) When lying down … (5) When in the village … (6) When in the forest … (7) When at the foot of a tree … (8) When in an empty hut … (9) When in the open air … (10) When amid the bhikkhus, one finds happiness or comfort. When there is enjoyment, this happiness is to be expected.”
