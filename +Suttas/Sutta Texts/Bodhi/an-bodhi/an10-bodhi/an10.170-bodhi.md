# AN10.170 The Near Shore

> **Division:** II. JĀṆUSSOṆĪ

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the near shore and the far shore. Listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“What, bhikkhus, is the near shore, and what is the far shore? (1) The destruction of life, bhikkhus, is the near shore, abstention from the destruction of life the far shore….(10) Wrong view is the near shore, right view the far shore. The one, bhikkhus, is the near shore, the other the far shore.” \[254\]

\[The verses attached are identical with those of the preceding sutta.\]
