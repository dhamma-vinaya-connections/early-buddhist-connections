# AN10.90 Powers

> **Division:** IV. THE ELDERS

Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

“Sāriputta, when a bhikkhu’s taints have been destroyed, how many powers does he possess by reason of which he can claim \[to have attained\] the destruction of the taints: ‘My taints have been destroyed’?”

“Bhante, when a bhikkhu’s taints have been destroyed, he possesses ten powers by reason of which he can claim \[to have attained\] the destruction of the taints: ‘My taints have been destroyed.’ What ten?

(1) “Here, Bhante, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has clearly seen all conditioned phenomena as they really are with correct wisdom as impermanent. \[175\] This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed on the basis of which he claims \[to have attained\] the destruction of the taints: ‘My taints have been destroyed.’

(2) “Again, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has clearly seen sensual pleasures as they really are with correct wisdom as similar to a charcoal pit. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed …

(3) “Again, the mind of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion; it is withdrawn, delights in renunciation, and is entirely finished with all things that are a basis for the taints. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed …

(4) “Again, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has developed and well developed the four establishments of mindfulness. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed …

(5)–(10) “Again, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has developed and well developed the four right strivings … the four bases for psychic potency … the five spiritual faculties … the five powers \[176\] … the seven factors of enlightenment … the noble eightfold path. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed on the basis of which he claims \[to have attained\] the destruction of the taints: ‘My taints have been destroyed.’

“Bhante, when a bhikkhu’s taints have been destroyed, he possesses these ten powers by reason of which he can claim \[to have attained\] the destruction of the taints: ‘My taints have been destroyed.’”
