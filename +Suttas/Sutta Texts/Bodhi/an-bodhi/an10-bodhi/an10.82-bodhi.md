# AN10.82

> **Division:** IV. THE ELDERS

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

(1) “It is impossible, Ānanda, that a bhikkhu without faith will achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline. (2) It is impossible that an immoral bhikkhu … (3) … a bhikkhu of little learning … (4) … a bhikkhu who is difficult to correct … \[153\] (5) … a bhikkhu who has bad friends … (6) … a lazy bhikkhu … (7) … a muddle-minded bhikkhu … (8) … a bhikkhu who is not content … (9) … a bhikkhu of evil desires … (10) … a bhikkhu who holds wrong view will achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline. It is impossible that a bhikkhu who possesses these ten qualities will achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline.

(1) “It is possible, Ānanda, that a bhikkhu endowed with faith will achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline. (2) It is possible that a virtuous bhikkhu … (3) … a bhikkhu of much learning … (4) … a bhikkhu who is easy to correct … (5) … a bhikkhu who has good friends … (6) … an energetic bhikkhu … (7) … a mindful bhikkhu … \[154\] (8) … a contented bhikkhu … (9) … a bhikkhu of few desires … (10) … a bhikkhu who holds right view will achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline. It is possible that a bhikkhu who possesses these ten qualities will achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline.”
