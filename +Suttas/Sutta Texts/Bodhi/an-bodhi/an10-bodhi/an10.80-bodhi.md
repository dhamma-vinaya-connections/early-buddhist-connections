“Bhikkhus, there are these ten ways of removing resentment. What ten? (1) \[Thinking:\] ‘They acted for my harm, but what can be done about it?’ one removes resentment. \[151\] (2) \[Thinking:\] ‘They are acting for my harm, but what can be done about it?’ one removes resentment. (3) \[Thinking:\] ‘They will act for my harm, but what can be done about it?’ one removes resentment. (4) \[Thinking:\] ‘They acted …’ (5) … ‘They are acting …’ (6) … ‘They will act for the harm of one who is pleasing and agreeable to me, but what can be done about it?’ one removes resentment (7) \[Thinking:\] ‘They acted …’ (8) … ‘They are acting …’ (9) … ‘They will act for the benefit of one who is displeasing and disagreeable to me, but what can be done about it?’ one removes resentment. (10) And one does not become angry without a reason. These, bhikkhus, are the ten ways of removing resentment.”
