# AN10.41 Disputes

> **Division:** V. INSULTS

Then the Venerable Upāli approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

“Bhante, why is it that arguments, quarrels, contention, and disputes arise in the Saṅgha and bhikkhus do not dwell at ease?”

“Here, Upāli, (1) bhikkhus explain non-Dhamma as Dhamma … \[as in 10:37\] … \[78\] … and (10) what has been prescribed by the Tathāgata as not having been prescribed by him. This, Upāli, is why arguments, quarrels, contention, and disputes arise in the Saṅgha and bhikkhus do not dwell at ease.”
