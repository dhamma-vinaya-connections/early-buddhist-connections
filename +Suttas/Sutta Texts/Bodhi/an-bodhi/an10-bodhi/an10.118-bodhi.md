# AN10.118 Near

> **Division:** II. PACCOROHANṆĪ

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the near shore and the far shore. Listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“What, bhikkhus, is the near shore, and what is the far shore? (1) Wrong view, bhikkhus, is the near shore, right view the far shore … (10) Wrong liberation is the near shore, right liberation the far shore. The one, bhikkhus, is the near shore, the other the far shore.”

\[The verses attached are identical with those of the preceding sutta.\]
