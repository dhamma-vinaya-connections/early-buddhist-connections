# AN10.94 Vajjiyamāhita

> **Division:** V. UPĀLI

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Campā on a bank of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. Then the householder Vajjiyamāhita left Campā in the middle of the day to see the Blessed One. It then occurred to him: “It is not the proper time to see the Blessed One, who is in seclusion, nor to see the esteemed bhikkhus, who are also in seclusion. Let me go to the park of the wanderers of other sects.”

Then the householder Vajjiyamāhita went to the park of the wanderers of other sects … \[all as in 10:93\] \[190\] …

Then the householder Vajjiyamāhita approached those wanderers and exchanged greetings with them. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side. The wanderers then said to him:

“Is it true, householder, as it is said, that the ascetic Gotama criticizes all austerities and that he unreservedly condemns and reproves all who live a harsh and austere life?”

“No, Bhante, the Blessed One does not criticize all austerities and he does not unreservedly condemn and reprove all who live a harsh and austere life. The Blessed One criticizes what deserves criticism and praises what is praiseworthy. By criticizing what deserves criticism and praising what is praiseworthy, the Blessed One speaks on the basis of distinctions; he does not speak about such matters one-sidedly.”

When this was said, a wanderer said to the householder Vajjiyamāhita: “Wait a moment, householder! That ascetic Gotama whom you are praising is an abolitionist who refrains from making definite declarations.”

“I will deal with that point, too, Bhante. The Blessed One has validly declared: ‘This is wholesome’ and: ‘This is unwholesome.’ Thus, when he declares what is wholesome and what is unwholesome, the Blessed One makes definite declarations. He is not an abolitionist who refrains from making definite declarations.”

When this was said, those wanderers \[191\] sat silenced, disconcerted, hunched over, downcast, glum, and speechless. Then the householder Vajjiyamāhita, having understood that those wanderers \[sat\] silenced … and speechless, rose from his seat and went to the Blessed One. He paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and reported to the Blessed One his entire conversation with those wanderers of other sects.

\[The Blessed One said:\] “Good, good, householder! It is in such a way that those hollow men should from time to time be thoroughly refuted with reasoned argument.”

(1)–(2) “I do not say, householder, of every kind of austerity that it should be practiced; nor do I say of every kind of austerity that it should not be practiced. (3)–(4) I do not say of every observance that it should be undertaken; nor do I say of every observance that it should not be undertaken. (5)–(6) I do not say that one should strive in every way; nor do I say that one should not strive in any way. (7)–(8) I do not say that one should make every kind of relinquishment; nor do I say that one should not make any kind of relinquishment. (9)–(10) I do not say that one should attain every kind of liberation; nor do I say that one should not attain any kind of liberation.

(1)–(2) “If, householder, when one practices a particular austerity, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, then, I say, one should not practice such austerity. But if, when one practices a particular austerity, unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome \[192\] qualities increase, then, I say, one should practice such austerity.

(3)–(4) “If, householder, when one undertakes a particular observance, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, then, I say, one should not undertake such an observance. But if, when one undertakes a particular observance, unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, then, I say, one should undertake such an observance.

(5)–(6) “If, householder, when one strives in a particular way, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, then, I say, one should not strive in such a way. But if, when one strives in a particular way, unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, then, I say, one should strive in such a way.

(7)–(8) “If, householder, when one relinquishes something, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, then, I say, one should not make such a relinquishment. But if, when one relinquishes something, unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, then, I say, one should make such a relinquishment.

(9)–(10) “If, householder, when one attains a particular liberation, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, then, I say, one should not attain such a liberation. But if, when one attains a particular liberation, unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, then, I say, one should attain such a liberation.”

Then, when the householder Vajjiyamāhita had been instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk, he rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.

Then, not long after the householder Vajjiyamāhita had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, if any bhikkhu, even one who has long had little dust in his eyes regarding this Dhamma and discipline, would thoroughly refute with reasoned argument the wanderers of other sects, he would refute them in just such a way as the householder Vajjiyamāhita has done.” \[193\]
