# AN10.167 Paccorohaṇī (1)

> **Division:** II. JĀṆUSSOṆĪ

Now on that occasion, on the uposatha day, the brahmin Jāṇussoṇī stood to one side not far from the Blessed One, with his head washed, wearing a new pair of linen clothes, holding a handful of wet _kusa_ grass. The Blessed One saw him standing there and said to him:

“Why is it, brahmin, that on the uposatha day you stand to one side with your head washed, wearing a new pair of linen clothes, holding a handful of wet _kusa_ grass? What is happening today with the brahmin clan?”

“Today, Master Gotama, is the brahmin clan’s _paccorohaṇī_ festival.” \[250\]

“But how, brahmin, do the brahmins observe the _paccorohaṇī_ festival?”

“Here, Master Gotama, on the uposatha day, the brahmins wash their heads and put on a pair of new linen clothes. They then smear the ground with wet cow dung, cover this with green _kusa_ grass, and lie down between the boundary and the fire house. In the course of the night, they get up three times, and with reverential salutation pay homage to the fire: ‘We descend in honor of the revered one. We descend in honor of the revered one.’ They offer abundant ghee, oil, and butter to the fire. When the night has passed, they offer excellent food of various kinds to brahmins. It is in this way, Master Gotama, that the brahmins observe the _paccorohaṇī_ festival.”

“The _paccorohaṇī_ festival in the Noble One’s discipline, brahmin, is quite different from the _paccorohaṇī_ festival of the brahmins.”

“But how, Master Gotama, is the _paccorohaṇī_ festival observed in the Noble One’s discipline? It would be good if Master Gotama would teach me the Dhamma by explaining how the _paccorohaṇī_ festival is observed in the Noble One’s discipline.”

“Well then, brahmin, listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, sir,” the brahmin Jāṇussoṇī replied. The Blessed One said this:

(1) “Here, brahmin, the noble disciple reflects thus: ‘The result of the destruction of life is bad both in this present life and in future lives.’ Having reflected thus, he abandons the destruction of life; he descends from the destruction of life.

(2) “… ‘The result of taking what is not given is bad both in this present life and in future lives.’ Having reflected thus, he abandons taking what is not given; he descends from taking what is not given.

(3) “… ‘The result of sexual misconduct is bad both in this present life and in future lives.’ Having reflected thus, he abandons sexual misconduct; he descends from sexual misconduct.

(4) “… ‘The result of false speech is bad both in this present life and in future lives.’ \[251\] Having reflected thus, he abandons false speech; he descends from false speech.

(5) “… ‘The result of divisive speech is bad both in this present life and in future lives.’ Having reflected thus, he abandons divisive speech; he descends from divisive speech.

(6) “… ‘The result of harsh speech is bad both in this present life and in future lives.’ Having reflected thus, he abandons harsh speech; he descends from harsh speech.

(7) “… ‘The result of idle chatter is bad both in this present life and in future lives.’ Having reflected thus, he abandons idle chatter; he descends from idle chatter.

(8) “… ‘The result of longing is bad both in this present life and in future lives.’ Having reflected thus, he abandons longing; he descends from longing.

(9) “… ‘The result of ill will is bad both in this present life and in future lives.’ Having reflected thus, he abandons ill will; he descends from ill will.

(10) “… ‘The result of wrong view is bad both in this present life and in future lives.’ Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong view; he descends from wrong view.

“It is in this way, brahmin, that the _paccorohaṇī_ festival is observed in the Noble One’s discipline.”

“The _paccorohaṇī_ festival in the Noble One’s discipline, Master Gotama, is quite different from the _paccorohaṇī_ festival of the brahmins. And the _paccorohaṇī_ festival of the brahmins is not worth a sixteenth part of the _paccorohaṇī_ festival in the Noble One’s discipline.

“Excellent, Master Gotama! … \[as in 10:119\] … Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”
