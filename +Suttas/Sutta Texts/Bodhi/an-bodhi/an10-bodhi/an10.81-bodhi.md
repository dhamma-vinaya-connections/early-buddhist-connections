# AN10.81 Bāhuna

> **Division:** IV. THE ELDERS

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Campā on a bank of the Gaggārā Lotus Pond. Then the Venerable Bāhuna approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

“Bhante, from how many things is the Tathāgata released, detached, and emancipated, that he dwells with a mind free from boundaries?” \[152\]

“Bāhuna, it is because the Tathāgata is released, detached, and emancipated from ten things that he dwells with a mind free from boundaries. What ten? (1) It is because the Tathāgata is released, detached, and emancipated from form that he dwells with a mind free from boundaries. (2)–(5) It is because the Tathāgata is released, detached, and emancipated from feeling … perception … volitional activities … consciousness that he dwells with a mind free from boundaries. (6)–(10) It is because the Tathāgata is released, detached, and emancipated from birth … old age … death … suffering … defilements that he dwells with a mind free from boundaries.

“Just as a blue, red, or white lotus flower, though born in the water and grown up in the water, rises up above the water and stands unsoiled by the water, even so, Bāhuna, it is because the Tathāgata is released, detached, and emancipated from these ten things that he dwells with a mind free from boundaries.”
