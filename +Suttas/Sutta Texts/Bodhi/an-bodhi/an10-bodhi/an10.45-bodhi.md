# AN10.45 Entering

> **Division:** V. INSULTS

“Bhikkhus, there are these ten dangers in entering the king’s inner palace. What ten?

(1) “Here, the king is sitting with his queen. The bhikkhu enters, and either the queen smiles when she sees the bhikkhu or the bhikkhu smiles when he sees the queen. The king thinks: ‘Surely, something has gone on between them, or something is about to go on.’ This is the first danger in entering the king’s inner palace.

(2) “Again, when the king has been busy, engaged with much work, he has had intercourse with one of the women but does not remember this, and because of their relations she has become pregnant. The king thinks: ‘No one \[82\] else has entered here except the monk. Could this be the monk’s work?’ This is the second danger in entering the king’s inner palace.

(3) “Again, a gem has been lost in the king’s inner palace. The king thinks: ‘No one else has entered here except the monk. Could this be the monk’s work?’ This is the third danger in entering the king’s inner palace.

(4) “Again, the secret deliberations of the king’s inner palace have spread to others. The king thinks: ‘No one else has entered here except the monk. Could this be the monk’s work?’ This is the fourth danger in entering the king’s inner palace.

(5) “Again, in the king’s inner palace a father longs for his son, or a son longs for his father. They think: ‘No one else has entered here except the monk. Could this be the monk’s work?’ This is the fifth danger in entering the king’s inner palace.

(6) “Again, the king promotes someone. Those who are upset by this think: ‘The king has close ties with the monk. Could this be the monk’s work?’ This is the sixth danger in entering the king’s inner palace.

(7) “Again, the king demotes someone. Those who are upset by this think: ‘The king has close ties with the monk. Could this be the monk’s work?’ This is the seventh danger in entering the king’s inner palace.

(8) “Again, the king dispatches his army at an improper time. Those who are upset by this think: ‘The king has close ties with the monk. Could this be the monk’s work?’ This is the eighth danger in entering the king’s inner palace.

(9) “Again, after dispatching his army at a proper time, the king orders it to turn back while en route. Those who are upset by this think: \[83\] ‘The king has close ties with the monk. Could this be the monk’s work?’ This is the ninth danger in entering the king’s inner palace.

(10) “Again, in the king’s inner palace there is the trampling of elephants, horses, and chariots, as well as tantalizing forms, sounds, odors, tastes, and tactile objects that are not suitable for a monk. This is the tenth danger in entering the king’s inner palace.

“These, bhikkhus, are the ten dangers in entering the king’s inner palace.”
