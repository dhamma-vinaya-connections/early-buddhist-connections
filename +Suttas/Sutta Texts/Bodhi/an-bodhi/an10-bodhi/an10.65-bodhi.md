# AN10.65 Happiness (1)

> **Division:** II. PAIRS

On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta was dwelling among the Magadhans at Nālakagāmaka. Then the wanderer Sāmaṇḍakāni \[121\] approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:

“Friend Sāriputta, what is happiness? What is suffering?” “Rebirth, friend, is suffering. No rebirth is happiness. When there is rebirth, this suffering is to be expected: cold, heat, hunger, thirst, defecation, and urination; being afflicted by fire, sticks, or knives; and relatives and friends get together and scold one. When there is rebirth, this suffering is to be expected.

“When there is no rebirth, this happiness is to be expected: no cold, no heat, no hunger, no thirst, no defecation, and no urination; no being afflicted by fire, sticks, or knives; and relatives and friends don’t get together and scold one. When there is no rebirth, this happiness is to be expected.”
