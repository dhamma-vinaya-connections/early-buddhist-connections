# AN10.43 Roots (2)

> **Division:** V. INSULTS

“Bhante, how many roots of disputes are there?”

“There are, Upāli, ten roots of disputes. What ten? Here, (1) bhikkhus explain what is no offense as an offense, and (2) what is an offense as no offense. (3) They explain a light offense as a grave offense, and (4) a grave offense as a light offense. (5) They explain a coarse offense as not a coarse offense, and (6) an offense that is not coarse as a coarse offense. (7) They explain a remediable offense as an irremediable offense, and (8) an irremediable offense as a remediable offense. \[79\] (9) They explain an offense with redress as an offense without redress, and (10) an offense without redress as an offense with redress. These, Upāli, are the ten roots of disputes.”
