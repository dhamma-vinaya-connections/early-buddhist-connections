# AN10.26 Kāḷī

> **Division:** III. THE GREAT CHAPTER

On one occasion the Venerable Mahākaccāna was dwelling among the people of Avantī on Mount Pavatta at Kuraraghara. Then the female lay follower Kāḷī of Kuraraghara approached him, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

“Bhante, this was said by the Blessed One in ‘The Maidens’ Questions’:

“‘Having conquered the army of the pleasant and agreeable,

meditating alone, I discovered bliss,

the attainment of the goal, the peace of the heart.

Therefore I don’t form intimate ties with people,

nor does intimacy with anyone get a chance with me.’ \[47\]

“How, Bhante, is the meaning of this statement that the Blessed One spoke in brief to be seen in detail?”

“Some ascetics and brahmins, sister, for whom the attainment of the earth _kasiṇa_ is supreme, generated it as their goal. The Blessed One directly knew to what extent the attainment of the earth _kasiṇa_ is supreme. Having directly known this, he saw the beginning, the danger, and the escape, and he saw the knowledge and vision of the path and the non-path. By seeing the beginning, the danger, and the escape, and by seeing the knowledge and vision of the path and the non-path, he knew the attainment of the goal, the peace of the heart.

“Some ascetics and brahmins, sister, for whom the attainment of the water _kasiṇa_ … the fire _kasiṇa_ … the air _kasiṇa_ … the blue _kasiṇa_ … the yellow _kasiṇa_ … the red _kasiṇa_ … the white _kasiṇa_ … the space _kasiṇa_ … the consciousness _kasiṇa_ is supreme, generated it as their goal. The Blessed One directly knew to what extent the attainment of the consciousness _kasiṇa_ is supreme. Having directly known this, he saw the beginning, the danger, and the escape, and he saw the knowledge and vision of the path and the non-path. By seeing the beginning, the danger, and the escape, and by seeing the knowledge and vision of the path and the non-path, he knew the attainment of the goal, the peace of the heart.

“Thus, sister, it is in such a way that the meaning should be seen in detail of this statement that the Blessed One spoke in brief in ‘The Maidens’ Questions’:

“‘Having conquered the army of the pleasant and agreeable,

meditating alone, I discovered bliss,

the attainment of the goal, the peace of the heart. \[48\]

Therefore I don’t form intimate ties with people,

nor does intimacy with anyone succeed in my case.’”
