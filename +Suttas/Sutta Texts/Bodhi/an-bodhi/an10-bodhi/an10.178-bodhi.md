# AN10.178 Good

> **Division:** III. GOOD

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you what is good and what is bad. Listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, \[274\] Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“And what, bhikkhus, is bad? The destruction of life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech, divisive speech, harsh speech, idle chatter, longing, ill will, and wrong view. This is called bad.

“And what, bhikkhus, is good? Abstention from the destruction of life, abstention from taking what is not given, abstention from sexual misconduct, abstention from false speech, abstention from divisive speech, abstention from harsh speech, abstention from idle chatter, non-longing, good will, and right view. This is called good.”
