> **Division:** III. WISH

“Bhikkhus, there are these ten grounds for resentment. What ten? (1) \[Thinking:\] ‘They acted for my harm,’ one harbors resentment. (2) \[Thinking:\] ‘They are acting for my harm,’ one harbors resentment. (3) \[Thinking:\] ‘They will act for my harm,’ one harbors resentment. (4) \[Thinking:\] ‘They acted for the harm of one who is pleasing and agreeable to me,’ one harbors resentment. (5) \[Thinking:\] ‘They are acting for the harm of one who is pleasing and agreeable to me,’ one harbors resentment. (6) \[Thinking:\] ‘They will act for the harm of one who is pleasing and agreeable to me,’ one harbors resentment. (7) \[Thinking:\] ‘They acted for the benefit of one who is displeasing and disagreeable to me,’ one harbors resentment. (8) \[Thinking:\] ‘They are acting for the benefit of one who is displeasing and disagreeable to me,’ one harbors resentment. (9) \[Thinking:\] ‘They will act for the benefit of one who is displeasing and disagreeable to me,’ one harbors resentment. (10) And one becomes angry without a reason. These, bhikkhus, are the ten grounds for resentment.”
