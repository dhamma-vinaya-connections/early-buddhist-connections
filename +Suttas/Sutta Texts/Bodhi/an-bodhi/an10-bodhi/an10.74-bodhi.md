# AN10.74 Growth

> **Division:** III. WISH

“Bhikkhus, growing in ten ways, a noble disciple grows by a noble growth, and he absorbs the essence and the best of this life. What ten? (1) He grows in fields and land; (2) in wealth and grain; (3) in wives and children; (4) in slaves, workers, and servants; (5) in livestock; (6)–(10) in faith, virtuous behavior, learning, generosity, and wisdom. Growing in these ten ways, a noble disciple grows by a noble growth, and he absorbs the essence and the best of this life.”

One who grows here in wealth and grain,

in children, wives, and livestock,

is wealthy and famous, honored

by relatives, friends, and royalty.

Such a discerning good man—

who grows here in faith and virtuous behavior,

in wisdom, generosity, and learning—

grows in both ways in this life.
