# AN10.101 An Ascetic’s Perceptions

> **Division:** I. AN ASCETIC’S PERCEPTIONS

“Bhikkhus, when these three ascetic perceptions are developed and cultivated, they fulfill seven things. What three?

(1) “‘I have entered upon a classless condition; (2) my living is dependent upon others; (3) my deportment should be different.’ When these three perceptions of an ascetic are developed and cultivated, they fulfill seven things. What seven?

(4) “One consistently acts and behaves in accord with virtuous behavior. (5) One is without longing, (6) without ill will, (7) and without arrogance. (8) One is desirous of training. \[211\] (9) One uses the requisites for maintaining one’s life with an awareness of their purpose. (10) One is energetic. When, bhikkhus, these three perceptions of an ascetic are developed and cultivated, they fulfill these seven things.”
