# AN10.220 Conduct Contrary to the Dhamma

> **Division:** I. THE DEED-BORN BODY

Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had exchanged greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

“Master Gotama, why is it that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell?”

“It is, brahmin, because of unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

“Master Gotama, why is it that some beings here, \[302\] with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world?”

“It is, brahmin, because of righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.”

“I do not understand in detail the meaning of Master Gotama’s statement that he has spoken in brief. Please let Master Gotama teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might understand the meaning in detail.”

“Well then, brahmin, listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, sir,” that brahmin replied. The Blessed One said this:

“Brahmin, unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, is threefold by way of the body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of the mind.

“And how, brahmin, is unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, threefold by way of the body? … \[here and below, the explanations are as in 10:217\] … It is in this way that unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, is threefold by way of the mind.

“It is, brahmin, because of such unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

“Brahmin, righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, is threefold by way of the body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of the mind.

“And how, brahmin, is righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, threefold by way of the body? … \[303\] … It is in this way that righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, is threefold by way of the mind.

“It is, brahmin, because of such righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.

“Excellent, Master Gotama! … Let Master Gotama accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”
