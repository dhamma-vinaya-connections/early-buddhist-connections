# AN10.78 The Nigaṇṭhas

> **Division:** III. WISH

“Bhikkhus, the Nigaṇṭhas have ten bad qualities. What ten? (1) The Nigaṇṭhas are without faith, (2) immoral, (3) morally shameless, (4) morally reckless, (5) and devoted to bad persons. (6) They extol themselves and disparage others. (7) They grasp their own views, hold to them tightly, and relinquish them with difficulty. (8) They are deceivers, (9) have evil desires, and (10) hold wrong views. The Nigaṇṭhas have these ten bad qualities.”
