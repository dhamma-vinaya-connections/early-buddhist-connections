# AN10.64 Unwavering

> **Division:** II. PAIRS

“Bhikkhus, all those who have unwavering confidence in me are stream-enterers. Of those stream-enterers, five gain the goal here in this world; five gain the goal having left this world.

“Who are the five that gain the goal here in this world? The seven-times-at-most attainer, the family-to-family attainer, the one-seed attainer, the once-returner, and one who, in this very life, is an arahant. These five gain the goal here in this world.

“Who are the five that gain the goal having left this world? The attainer of nibbāna in the interval, the attainer of nibbāna upon landing, the attainer of nibbāna without exertion, the attainer of nibbāna through exertion, and one bound upstream, heading toward the Akaniṭṭha realm. These five gain the goal having left this world.

“All those, bhikkhus, who have unwavering confidence in me are stream-enterers. Of those stream-enterers, the former five gain the goal here in this world; the latter five gain the goal having left this world.”
