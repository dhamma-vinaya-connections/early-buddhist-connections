# AN10.116 Ajita

> **Division:** II. PACCOROHANṆĪ

Then the wanderer Ajita approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side \[230\] and said to the Blessed One:

“Master Gotama, I have a fellow ascetic named Paṇḍita. He has thought out five hundred arguments by which those of other sects, when rebutted, know: ‘We’ve been rebutted.’”

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Do you remember, bhikkhus, Paṇḍita’s cases?”

“This is the time for it, Blessed One! This is the time for it, Fortunate One! Having heard this from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will retain in mind whatever the Blessed One says.”

“Well then, bhikkhus, listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“Here, someone refutes and disproves a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma with a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma. In this way, he delights an assembly contrary to the Dhamma. For this reason, the assembly contrary to the Dhamma becomes loud and boisterous, exclaiming: ‘He is truly wise, sir! He is truly wise, sir!’

“Someone refutes and disproves a doctrine that accords with the Dhamma by means of a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma. In this way, he delights an assembly contrary to the Dhamma. For this reason, the assembly contrary to the Dhamma becomes loud and boisterous, exclaiming: ‘He is truly wise, sir! He is truly wise, sir!’

“Someone refutes and disproves both a doctrine that accords with the Dhamma and a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma by means of a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma. In this way, he delights an assembly contrary to the Dhamma. For this reason, the assembly contrary to the Dhamma becomes loud and boisterous, exclaiming: ‘He is truly wise, sir! He is truly wise, sir!’

For this reason, the assembly that accords with the Dhamma becomes loud and boisterous, exclaiming: ‘He is truly wise, sir! He is truly wise, sir!’\] \[231\]

“Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma should be understood, and what is harmful and what is beneficial should be understood. Having understood what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma, and what is harmful and what is beneficial, one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial….

\[The sutta continues exactly as in 10:114, ending:\]

“When it was said: ‘Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma should be understood, and what is harmful and what is beneficial should be understood. Having understood what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma, \[232\] and what is harmful and what is beneficial, one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial,’ it is with reference to this that this was said.”
