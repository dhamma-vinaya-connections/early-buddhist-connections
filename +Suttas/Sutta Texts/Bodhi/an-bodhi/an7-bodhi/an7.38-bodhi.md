# AN7.38 Analytical Knowledges (1)

> **Division:** IV. DEITIES

“Bhikkhus, when he possesses seven qualities, a bhikkhu might soon realize for himself with direct knowledge the four analytical knowledges and acquire mastery over them. What seven?

“Here, (1) a bhikkhu understands as it really is: ‘This is mental sluggishness in me.’ (2) Or when the mind is constricted internally, he understands as it really is: ‘My mind is constricted internally.’ (3) Or when his mind is distracted externally, he understands as it really is: ‘My mind is distracted externally.’ (4) He knows feelings as they arise, as they remain present, as they disappear; (5) he knows perceptions as they arise, as they remain present, \[33\] as they disappear; (6) he knows thoughts as they arise, as they remain present, as they disappear. (7) Then, among qualities suitable and unsuitable, inferior and superior, dark and bright along with their counterparts, he has grasped the mark well, attended to it well, reflected upon it well, and penetrated it well with wisdom. When he possesses these seven qualities, a bhikkhu might soon realize for himself with direct knowledge the four analytical knowledges and acquire mastery over them.”
