# AN7.23 Non-Decline (1)

> **Division:** III. THE VAJJI SEVEN

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you seven principles of non-decline. Listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“And what, bhikkhus, are the seven principles of non-decline?

(1) “As long as the bhikkhus assemble often and hold frequent assemblies, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(2) “As long as the bhikkhus assemble in harmony, adjourn in harmony, and conduct the affairs of the Saṅgha in harmony, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(3) “As long as the bhikkhus do not decree anything that has not been decreed or abolish anything that has already been decreed, but undertake and follow the training rules as they have been decreed, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(4) “As long as the bhikkhus honor, respect, esteem, and venerate those bhikkhus who are elders, of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and guides of the Saṅgha, and think they should be heeded, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(5) “As long as the bhikkhus do not come under the control of arisen craving that leads to renewed existence, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(6) “As long as the bhikkhus are intent on forest lodgings, \[22\] only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(7) “As long as the bhikkhus each individually establish mindfulness \[with the intention\]: ‘How can well-behaved fellow monks who have not yet come here come, and how can well-behaved fellow monks who are already here dwell at ease?’ only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

“Bhikkhus, as long as these seven principles of non-decline continue among the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus are seen \[established\] in them, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.”
