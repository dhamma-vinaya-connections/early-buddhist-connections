# AN7.26 Non-Decline (4)

> **Division:** III. THE VAJJI SEVEN

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you seven principles of non-decline. Listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“And what, bhikkhus, are the seven principles of non-decline? (1) As long as the bhikkhus develop the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline. (2) As long as they develop the enlightenment factor of discrimination of phenomena … (3) … the enlightenment factor of energy … (4) … the enlightenment factor of rapture … (5) … the enlightenment factor of tranquility … (6) … the enlightenment factor of concentration … (7) … the enlightenment factor of equanimity, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

“Bhikkhus, as long as these seven principles of non-decline continue among the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus are seen \[established\] in them, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.” \[24\]
