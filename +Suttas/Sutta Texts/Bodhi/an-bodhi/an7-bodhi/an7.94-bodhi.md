# AN7.94 Character (2)

> **Division:** IV. AN ASCETIC

“Bhikkhus, there are these seven who are of good character. What seven? One endowed with faith, one with a sense of moral shame, one with moral dread, one who is learned, one who is energetic, one who is mindful, and one who is wise. These are the seven who are of good character.”
