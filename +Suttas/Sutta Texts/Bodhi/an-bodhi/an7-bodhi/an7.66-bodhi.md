# AN7.66 Seven Suns

> **Division:** II. THE GREAT CHAPTER

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in Ambapālī’s Grove. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”

“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“Bhikkhus, conditioned phenomena are impermanent; conditioned phenomena are unstable; conditioned phenomena are unreliable. It is enough to become disenchanted with all conditioned phenomena, enough to become dispassionate toward them, enough to be liberated from them.

“Bhikkhus, Sineru, the king of mountains, is 84,000 _yojanas_ in length and 84,000 _yojanas_ in width; it is submerged 84,000 _yojanas_ in the great ocean and rises up 84,000 _yojanas_ above the great ocean.

(1) “There comes a time, bhikkhus, when rain does not fall for many years, for many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years, for many hundreds of thousands of years. When rain does not fall, seed life and vegetation, medicinal plants, grasses, and giant trees of the forest wither and dry up and no longer exist. So impermanent are conditioned phenomena, so unstable, so unreliable. It is enough to become disenchanted with all conditioned phenomena, enough to become dispassionate toward them, enough to be liberated from them.

(2) “There comes a time when, after a long time, a second sun appears. With the appearance of the second sun, the small rivers and lakes dry up and evaporate and no longer \[101\] exist. So impermanent are conditioned phenomena…. It is enough to be liberated from them.

(3) “There comes a time when, after a long time, a third sun appears. With the appearance of the third sun, the great rivers—the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, and the Mahī—dry up and evaporate and no longer exist. So impermanent are conditioned phenomena…. It is enough to be liberated from them.

(4) “There comes a time when, after a long time, a fourth sun appears. With the appearance of the fourth sun, the great lakes from which those great rivers originate—Anotatta, Sīhapapāta, Rathakāra, Kaṇṇamuṇḍa, Kuṇāla, Chaddanta, and Mandākinī—dry up and evaporate and no longer exist. So impermanent are conditioned phenomena…. It is enough to be liberated from them.

(5) “There comes a time when, after a long time, a fifth sun appears. With the appearance of the fifth sun, the waters in the great ocean sink by a hundred _yojanas_, two hundred _yojanas_ … three hundred _yojanas_ … seven hundred _yojanas_. The water left in the great ocean stands at the height of seven palm trees, at the height of six palm trees … five palm trees … four palm trees … three palm trees … two palm trees \[102\] … a mere palm tree. The water left in the great ocean stands at the height of seven fathoms … six fathoms … five fathoms … four fathoms … three fathoms … two fathoms … a fathom … half a fathom … up to the waist … up to the knees … up to the ankles. Just as, in the autumn, when thick drops of rain are pouring down, the waters stand in the hoof prints of cattle here and there, so the waters left in the great ocean will stand here and there \[in pools\] the size of the hoof prints of cattle. With the appearance of the fifth sun, the water left in the great ocean is not enough even to reach the joints of one’s fingers. So impermanent are conditioned phenomena…. It is enough to be liberated from them.

(6) “There comes a time when, after a long time, a sixth sun appears. With the appearance of the sixth sun, this great earth and Sineru, the king of mountains, smoke, fume, and smolder. Just as a potter’s fire, when kindled, first smokes, fumes, and smolders, so with the appearance of the sixth sun, this great earth and Sineru, the king of mountains, smoke, fume, and smolder. So impermanent are conditioned phenomena…. It is enough to be liberated from them.

(7) “There comes a time when, after a long time, a seventh sun appears. \[103\] With the appearance of the seventh sun, this great earth and Sineru, the king of mountains, burst into flames, blaze up brightly, and become one mass of flame. As the great earth and Sineru are blazing and burning, the flame, cast up by the wind, rises even to the brahmā world. As Sineru is blazing and burning, as it is undergoing destruction and being overcome by a great mass of heat, mountain peaks of a hundred _yojanas_ disintegrate; mountain peaks of two hundred _yojanas_ … three hundred _yojanas_ … four hundred _yojanas_ … five hundred _yojanas_ disintegrate.

“When this great earth and Sineru, the king of mountains, are blazing and burning, neither ashes nor soot are seen. Just as, when ghee or oil are blazing and burning, neither ashes nor soot are seen, so it is when this great earth and Sineru, the king of mountains, are blazing and burning. So impermanent are conditioned phenomena, so unstable, so unreliable. It is enough to become disenchanted with all conditioned phenomena, enough to become dispassionate toward them, enough to be liberated from them.

“Bhikkhus, who except those who have seen the truth would think or believe: ‘This great earth and Sineru, the king of mountains, will burn up, be destroyed, and will no longer exist’?

“In the past, bhikkhus, there was a teacher named Sunetta, the founder of a spiritual sect, one without lust for sensual pleasures. The teacher Sunetta \[104\] had many hundreds of disciples to whom he taught a Dhamma for companionship with the brahmā world. When he was teaching, those who understood his teaching completely were, with the breakup of the body, after death, reborn in a good destination, in the brahmā world. But of those who did not understand his teaching completely, some were reborn in companionship with the devas who control what is created by others; some in companionship with the devas who delight in creation; some in companionship with the Tusita devas; some in companionship with the Yāma devas; some in companionship with the Tāvatiṃsa devas; some in companionship with the devas \[ruled by\] the four great kings. Some were reborn in companionship with affluent khattiyas; some in companionship with affluent brahmins; some in companionship with affluent householders.

“Then, bhikkhus, it occurred to the teacher Sunetta: ‘It isn’t fitting that I should have exactly the same future destination as my disciples. Let me develop loving-kindness further. Then for seven years the teacher Sunetta developed a mind of loving-kindness. As a consequence, for seven eons of world-dissolution and evolution he did not come back to this world. When the world was dissolving, \[105\] he moved on to the \[realm of\] streaming radiance. When the world was evolving, he was reborn in an empty mansion of Brahmā.

“There he was Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielder of mastery. He was Sakka, ruler of the devas, thirty-six times. Many hundreds of times he was a wheel-turning monarch, a righteous king who ruled by the Dhamma, a conqueror whose rule extended to the four boundaries, one who had attained stability in his country, who possessed the seven gems. He had over a thousand sons who were heroes, vigorous, able to crush the armies of their enemies. He reigned after he had conquered this earth as far as its ocean boundaries, not by force and weapons but by the Dhamma.

“Bhikkhus, though he had such a long life span and continued on for such a long time, the teacher Sunetta was still not freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish. He was not freed from suffering, I say. For what reason? Because he did not understand and penetrate four things. What four? Noble virtuous behavior, noble concentration, noble wisdom, and noble liberation.

“Noble virtuous behavior, bhikkhus, has been understood and penetrated. Noble concentration has been understood and penetrated. Noble wisdom has been understood and penetrated. Noble liberation has been understood and penetrated. Craving for existence has been cut off; the conduit to existence has been destroyed; now there is no more renewed existence.” \[106\]

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

“Virtuous behavior, concentration, wisdom,

and unsurpassed liberation:

these things the illustrious Gotama

understood by himself.

“Having directly known these things,

the Buddha taught the Dhamma to the bhikkhus.

The Teacher, the end-maker of suffering,

the One with Vision, has attained nibbāna.”
