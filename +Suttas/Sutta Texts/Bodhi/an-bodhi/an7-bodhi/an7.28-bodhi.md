# AN7.28 A Trainee

> **Division:** III. THE VAJJI SEVEN

“Bhikkhus, these seven qualities lead to the decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee. What seven? Delight in work, delight in talk, delight in sleep, delight in company, not guarding the doors of the sense faculties, lack of moderation in eating; and when there are matters pertaining to the Saṅgha that are \[to be dealt with\] in the Saṅgha, the bhikkhu who is a trainee does not reflect thus: ‘There are in the Saṅgha elders of long standing, long gone forth, responsible, who will take responsibility for that \[work\].’ He himself undertakes them. These seven qualities lead to the decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee.
