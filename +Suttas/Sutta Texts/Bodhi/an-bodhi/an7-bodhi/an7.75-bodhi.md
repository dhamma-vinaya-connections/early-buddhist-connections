# AN7.75 An Expert in the Discipline (1)

> **Division:** III. THE DISCIPLINE

“Bhikkhus, possessing seven qualities, a bhikkhu is an expert in the discipline. What seven?

“(1) He knows what is an offense. (2) He knows what is not an offense. (3) He knows what is a light offense. (4) He knows what is a grave offense. (5) He is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. (6) He is one who gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. (7) With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.

“Possessing these seven qualities, a bhikkhu is an expert in the discipline.”
