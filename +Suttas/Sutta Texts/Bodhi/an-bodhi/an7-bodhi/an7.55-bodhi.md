# AN7.55 Destinations of Persons

> **Division:** I. UNDECLARED

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you seven destinations of persons and attainment of nibbāna through non-clinging. Listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“And what, bhikkhus, are the seven destinations of persons?

(1) “Here, a bhikkhu is practicing thus: ‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be; it will not be mine. I am abandoning what exists, what has come to be.’ He obtains equanimity. He is not attached to existence; he is not attached to origination. He sees with correct wisdom: ‘There is a higher state that is peaceful,’ yet he has not totally realized that state. He has not totally abandoned the underlying tendency to conceit; he has not totally abandoned the underlying tendency to lust for existence; he has not totally abandoned ignorance. With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna in the interval.

“For example, when an iron bowl has been heated all day and is struck, a chip might fly off and be extinguished. So too, a bhikkhu is practicing thus … \[71\] … he has not totally abandoned ignorance. With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna in the interval.

(2) “Then a bhikkhu is practicing thus: ‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be; it will not be mine. I am abandoning what exists, what has come to be.’ He obtains equanimity. He is not attached to existence; he is not attached to origination. He sees with correct wisdom: ‘There is a higher state that is peaceful,’ yet he has not totally realized that state. He has not totally abandoned the underlying tendency to conceit; he has not totally abandoned the underlying tendency to lust for existence; he has not totally abandoned ignorance. With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna in the interval.

“For example, when an iron bowl has been heated all day and is struck, a chip might fly off, rise up, and be extinguished. So too, a bhikkhu is practicing thus…. With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna in the interval.

(3) “Then a bhikkhu is practicing thus: ‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be; it will not be mine….’ … With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna in the interval.

“For example, when an iron bowl has been heated all day and is struck, a chip might fly off, rise up, and be extinguished just before it lands on the ground. So too, a bhikkhu is practicing thus…. \[72\] … With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna in the interval.

(4) “Then a bhikkhu is practicing thus: ‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be; it will not be mine….’ … With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna upon landing.

“For example, when an iron bowl has been heated all day and is struck, a chip might be produced and fly up, and upon landing on the ground it would be extinguished. So too, a bhikkhu is practicing thus…. With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna upon landing.

(5) “Then a bhikkhu is practicing thus: ‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be; it will not be mine….’ … With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna without exertion.

“For example, when an iron bowl has been heated all day and is struck, a chip might fly off, rise up, and fall on a small pile of straw or sticks. There it would produce a fire and smoke, but when it has exhausted that small pile of straw or sticks, if it gets no more fuel, it would be extinguished. So too, a bhikkhu is practicing thus…. With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna without exertion. \[73\]

(6) “Then a bhikkhu is practicing thus: ‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be; it will not be mine….’ … With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna through exertion.

“For example, when an iron bowl has been heated all day and is struck, a chip might fly off, rise up, and then fall upon a wide pile of straw or sticks. There it would produce a fire and smoke, but when it has exhausted that wide pile of straw or sticks, if it gets no more fuel, it would be extinguished. So too, a bhikkhu is practicing thus…. With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna through exertion.

(7) “Then a bhikkhu is practicing thus: ‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be; it will not be mine. I am abandoning what exists, what has come to be.’ He obtains equanimity. He is not attached to existence; he is not attached to origination. He sees with correct wisdom: ‘There is a higher state that is peaceful,’ yet he has not totally realized that state. He has not totally abandoned the underlying tendency to conceit; he has not totally abandoned the underlying tendency to lust for existence; he has not totally abandoned ignorance. With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes one bound upstream, heading toward the Akaniṭṭha realm.

“For example, when an iron bowl has been heated all day and is struck, a chip might fly off, rise up, and then fall upon a large pile of straw or sticks. There it would produce a fire and smoke, and when it has exhausted that large \[74\] pile of straw or sticks, it would burn up a woods or a grove until it reaches the edge of a field, the edge of a road, the edge of a stone mountain, the edge of water, or some delightful piece of land, and then, if it gets no more fuel, it would be extinguished. So too, a bhikkhu is practicing thus…. With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes one bound upstream, heading toward the Akaniṭṭha realm.

“These, bhikkhus, are the seven destinations of persons.

“And what, bhikkhus, is attainment of nibbāna through non-clinging? Here, a bhikkhu is practicing thus: ‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be; it will not be mine. I am abandoning what exists, what has come to be.’ He obtains equanimity. He is not attached to existence; he is not attached to origination. He sees with correct wisdom: ‘There is a higher state that is peaceful,’ and he has totally realized that state. He has totally abandoned the underlying tendency to conceit; he has totally abandoned the underlying tendency to lust for existence; he has totally abandoned ignorance. With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. This is called attainment of nibbāna through non-clinging.

“These, bhikkhus, are the seven destinations of persons and attainment of nibbāna through non-clinging.”
