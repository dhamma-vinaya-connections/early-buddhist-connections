# AN7.36 A Friend (1)

> **Division:** IV. DEITIES

“Bhikkhus, one should associate with a friend who possesses seven factors. What seven? (1) He gives what is hard to give. (2) He does what is hard to do. (3) He patiently endures what is hard to endure. (4) He reveals his secrets to you. (5) He preserves your secrets. (6) He does not forsake you when you are in trouble. (7) He does not roughly despise you. One should associate with a friend who possesses these seven factors.”

A friend gives what is hard to give,

and he does what is hard to do.

He forgives you your harsh words

and endures what is hard to endure.

He tells you his secrets,

yet he preserves your secrets.

He does not forsake you in difficulties,

nor does he roughly despise you.

The person here in whom

these qualities are found is a friend.

One desiring a friend

should resort to such a person. \[32\]
