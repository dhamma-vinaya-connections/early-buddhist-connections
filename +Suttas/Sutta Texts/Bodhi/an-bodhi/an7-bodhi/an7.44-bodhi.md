# AN7.44 Stations

> **Division:** V. THE GREAT SACRIFICE

“Bhikkhus, there are these seven stations for consciousness. What seven?

(1) “There are, bhikkhus, beings that are different in body and different in perception, such as humans, some devas, and some in the lower world. This is the first station for consciousness. \[40\]

(2) “There are beings that are different in body but identical in perception, such as the devas of Brahmā’s company that are reborn through the first \[jhāna\]. This is the second station for consciousness.

(3) “There are beings that are identical in body but different in perception, such as the devas of streaming radiance. This is the third station for consciousness.

(4) “There are beings that are identical in body and identical in perception, such as the devas of refulgent glory. This is the fourth station for consciousness.

(5) “There are beings that, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, \[perceiving\] ‘space is infinite,’ belong to the base of the infinity of space. This is the fifth station for consciousness.

(6) “There are beings that, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, \[perceiving\] ‘consciousness is infinite,’ belong to the base of the infinity of consciousness. This is the sixth station for consciousness.

(7) “There are beings that, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, \[perceiving\] ‘there is nothing,’ belong to the base of nothingness. This is the seventh station for consciousness.

“These, bhikkhus, are the seven stations for consciousness.”
