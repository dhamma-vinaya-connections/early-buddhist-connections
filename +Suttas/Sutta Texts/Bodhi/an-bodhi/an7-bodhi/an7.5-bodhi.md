# AN7.5 Wealth in Brief

> **Division:** I. WEALTH

“Bhikkhus, there are these seven kinds of wealth. What seven? The wealth of faith, the wealth of virtuous behavior, the wealth of moral shame, the wealth of moral dread, the wealth of learning, the wealth of generosity, and the wealth of wisdom. \[5\] These are the seven kinds of wealth.”

The wealth of faith, the wealth of virtuous behavior,

the wealth of moral shame and moral dread,

the wealth of learning and generosity,

with wisdom, the seventh kind of wealth:

when one has these seven kinds of wealth,

whether a woman or a man,

they say that one is not poor,

that one’s life is not lived in vain.

Therefore an intelligent person,

remembering the Buddhas’ teaching,

should be intent on faith and virtuous behavior,

confidence and vision of the Dhamma.
