# AN7.62 Do Not Be Afraid of Merit

> **Division:** I. UNDECLARED

“Bhikkhus, do not be afraid of merit. This is a designation for happiness, \[89\] that is, merit.

“I recall that for a long time I experienced the desirable, lovely, agreeable result of merit that had been made over a long time. For seven years I developed a mind of loving-kindness. As a consequence, for seven eons of world-dissolution and evolution I did not come back to this world. When the world was dissolving I fared on to the \[realm of\] streaming radiance. When the world was evolving, I was reborn in an empty mansion of Brahmā. There I was Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielder of mastery. I was Sakka, ruler of the devas, thirty-six times. Many hundreds of times I was a wheel-turning monarch, a righteous king who ruled by the Dhamma, a conqueror whose rule extended to the four boundaries, one who had attained stability in his country, who possessed the seven gems. I had these seven gems, that is: the wheel-gem, the elephant-gem, the horse-gem, the jewel-gem, the woman-gem, the treasurer-gem, and the adviser-gem as the seventh. I had over a thousand sons who were heroes, vigorous, able to crush the armies of their enemies. I reigned after conquering this earth as far as its ocean boundaries, not by force and weapons but by the Dhamma.

“If one seeks happiness, look to the result

of merit, \[the result of\] wholesome deeds.

For seven years, I developed a loving mind, \[90\]

O bhikkhus, and for seven eons

of dissolution and evolution,

I did not come back again to this world.

“When the world was dissolving,

I fared on to \[the realm of\] streaming radiance.

When the world was evolving,

I fared on to an empty Brahmā \[mansion\].

“Seven times I was Great Brahmā,

the wielder of mastery;

thirty-six times I was ruler of the devas,

exercising rulership over the devas.

“I was a wheel-turning monarch,

the lord of Jambudīpa,

a head-anointed khattiya,

the sovereign among human beings.

“Without force, without weapons,

I conquered this earth.

I ruled it by righteousness,

without violence, by Dhamma,

exercising rulership by Dhamma

over this sphere of the earth.

“I was born into a rich family,

with abundant wealth and property,

\[a family\] endowed with all sense pleasures,

and possessing the seven gems.

This is well-taught by the Buddhas,

the benefactors of the world:

this is the cause of greatness by which

one is called a lord of the earth.

“I was a king bright with splendor,

one with abundant wealth and commodities.

I was a lord of Jambudīpa,

powerful and glorious.

Who, even though of a low birth,

would not place trust on hearing this? \[91\]

“Therefore one desiring the good,

aspiring for greatness,

should deeply revere the good Dhamma,

recollecting the Buddhas’ teaching.”
