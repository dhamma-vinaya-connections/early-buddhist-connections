# AN7.3 Powers in Brief

> **Division:** I. WEALTH

“Bhikkhus, there are these seven powers. What seven? The power of faith, the power of energy, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of mindfulness, the power of concentration, and the power of wisdom. These are the seven powers.”

The power of faith, the power of energy,

the powers of moral shame and moral dread;

the powers of mindfulness and concentration,

and wisdom, the seventh power;

a powerful bhikkhu possessing these

is wise and lives happily.

He should carefully examine the Dhamma

and deeply see the meaning with wisdom.

Like the extinguishing of a lamp

is the emancipation of the mind.
