# AN7.24 Non-Decline (2)

> **Division:** III. THE VAJJI SEVEN

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you seven principles of non-decline. Listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“And what, bhikkhus, are the seven principles of non-decline?

(1) “As long as the bhikkhus do not delight in work, do not take delight in work, are not devoted to delight in work, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline. (2) As long as the bhikkhus do not delight in talk … (3) … do not delight in sleep … (4) … do not delight in company … (5) … do not have evil desires and come under the control of evil desires … (6) … do not associate with bad friends, bad companions, bad comrades … (7) … do not come to a stop midway \[in their development\] on account of some minor achievement of distinction, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

“Bhikkhus, as long as these seven principles of non-decline continue among the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus are seen \[established\] in them, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.”
