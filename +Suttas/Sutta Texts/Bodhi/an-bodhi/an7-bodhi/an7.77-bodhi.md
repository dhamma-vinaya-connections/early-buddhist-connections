# AN7.77 An Expert in the Discipline (3)

> **Division:** III. THE DISCIPLINE

“Bhikkhus, possessing seven qualities, a bhikkhu is an expert in the discipline. What seven?

“(1) He knows what is an offense. (2) He knows what is not an offense. (3) He knows what is a light offense. (4) He knows what is a grave offense. (5) He is one who is firm in the discipline, immovable. (6) He is one who gains at will … the four jhānas…. (7) With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge … the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom … he dwells in it.

“Possessing these seven qualities, a bhikkhu is an expert in the discipline.”
