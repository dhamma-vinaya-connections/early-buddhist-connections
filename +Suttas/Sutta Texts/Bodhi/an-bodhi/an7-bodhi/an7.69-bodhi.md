# AN7.69 Pāricchattaka

> **Division:** II. THE GREAT CHAPTER

(1) “Bhikkhus, when the foliage of the Tāvatiṃsa devas’ _pāricchattaka_ coral tree has turned yellow, the Tāvatiṃsa devas are elated, \[thinking\]: ‘The foliage of the _pāricchattaka_ coral tree now has turned yellow. Now it won’t be long before its foliage will fall.’

(2) “When the foliage of the Tāvatiṃsa devas’ _pāricchattaka_ coral tree has fallen, the Tāvatiṃsa devas are elated, \[thinking\]: ‘The foliage of the _pāricchattaka_ coral tree now has fallen. Now it won’t be long before its floral initiation occurs.’

(3) “When the Tāvatiṃsa devas’ _pāricchattaka_ coral tree has had its floral initiation, the Tāvatiṃsa devas are elated, \[thinking\]: ‘The _pāricchattaka_ coral tree now has had its floral initiation. Now it won’t be long before its floral differentiation occurs.’

(4) “When the Tāvatiṃsa devas’ _pāricchattaka_ coral tree has had its floral differentiation, the Tāvatiṃsa devas are elated, \[thinking\]: ‘The _pāricchattaka_ coral tree now has had its floral differentiation. Now it won’t be long before its bud formation occurs.’

(5) “When the Tāvatiṃsa devas’ _pāricchattaka_ coral tree has had its bud formation, the Tāvatiṃsa devas are elated, \[thinking\]: ‘The _pāricchattaka_ coral tree now has had its bud formation. Now it won’t be long before \[118\] its bud burst occurs.’

(6) “When the Tāvatiṃsa devas’ _pāricchattaka_ coral tree has had its bud burst, the Tāvatiṃsa devas are elated, \[thinking\]: ‘The _pāricchattaka_ coral tree now has had its bud burst. Now it won’t be long before it fully blossoms.’

(7) “When the Tāvatiṃsa devas’ _pāricchattaka_ coral tree has fully blossomed, the Tāvatiṃsa devas are elated, and they spend four celestial months at the foot of the _pāricchattaka_ coral tree enjoying themselves furnished and endowed with the five objects of sensual pleasure. When the _pāricchattaka_ coral tree has fully blossomed, a radiance suffuses the area fifty _yojanas_ all around and a fragrance is carried along with the wind for a hundred _yojanas_. This is the majesty of the _pāricchattaka_ coral tree.

(1) “So too, bhikkhus, when a noble disciple intends to go forth from the household life into homelessness, on that occasion he is one whose foliage has turned yellow, like the Tāvatiṃsa devas’ _pāricchattaka_ coral tree.

(2) “When a noble disciple has shaved off his hair and beard, put on ochre robes, and gone forth from the household life into homelessness, on that occasion he is one whose foliage has fallen, like the Tāvatiṃsa devas’ _pāricchattaka_ coral tree.

(3) “When, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a noble disciple enters and dwells in the first jhāna … on that occasion his floral initiation has occurred, like the Tāvatiṃsa devas’ _pāricchattaka_ coral tree.

(4) “When, with the subsiding of thought and examination, a noble disciple enters and dwells in the second jhāna … on that occasion his floral differentiation has occurred, like the Tāvatiṃsa devas’ _pāricchattaka_ coral tree.

(5) “When, \[119\] with the fading away as well of rapture, a noble disciple … enters and dwells in the third jhāna … on that occasion his bud formation has occurred, like the Tāvatiṃsa devas’ _pāricchattaka_ coral tree.

(6) “When, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, a noble disciple enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna … on that occasion his buds have burst open, like the Tāvatiṃsa devas’ _pāricchattaka_ coral tree.

(7) “When, with the destruction of the taints, a noble disciple has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it, on that occasion he has fully blossomed, like the Tāvatiṃsa devas’ _pāricchattaka_ coral tree.

“On that occasion, bhikkhus, the earth-dwelling devas raise a cry: ‘This Venerable So-and-So, the pupil of that Venerable One, went forth from the household life into homelessness from such and such a village or town, and now, with the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it.’ Having heard the cry of the earth-dwelling devas, the devas \[ruled by\] the four great kings raise a cry…. Having heard the cry of the devas \[ruled by\] the four great kings, the Tāvatiṃsa devas … the Yāma devas … the Tusita devas … the devas who delight in creation … the devas who control what is created by others … the devas of Brahmā’s company raise a cry: ‘This Venerable So-and-So … has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it.’ Thus \[120\] at that moment, at that instant, at that second, the cry spreads as far as the brahma world. This is the spiritual majesty of a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed.”
