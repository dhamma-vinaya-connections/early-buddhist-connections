# AN7.9 Abandoning

> **Division:** I. WEALTH

“Bhikkhus, the spiritual life is lived to abandon and eradicate seven fetters. What seven? \[8\] The fetter of compliance, the fetter of aversion, the fetter of views, the fetter of doubt, the fetter of conceit, the fetter of lust for existence, and the fetter of ignorance. The spiritual life is lived to abandon and eradicate these seven fetters.

“When a bhikkhu has abandoned the fetter of compliance, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising; when he has abandoned the fetter of aversion … the fetter of views … the fetter of doubt … the fetter of conceit … the fetter of lust for existence … the fetter of ignorance, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising, he is then called a bhikkhu who has cut off craving, stripped off the fetter, and by completely breaking through conceit, has made an end of suffering.”
