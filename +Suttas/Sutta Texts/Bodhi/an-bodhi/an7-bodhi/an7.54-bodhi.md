# AN7.54 Undeclared

> **Division:** I. UNDECLARED

Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, \[68\] sat down to one side, and said: “Bhante, why is it that doubt does not arise in the instructed noble disciple about the undeclared points?”

“With the cessation of views, bhikkhu, doubt does not arise in the instructed noble disciple about the undeclared points.

(1) “‘The Tathāgata exists after death’: this is an involvement with views; ‘The Tathāgata does not exist after death’: this is an involvement with views; ‘The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death’: this is an involvement with views; ‘The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death’: this is an involvement with views.

“Bhikkhu, the uninstructed worldling does not understand views, their origin, their cessation, and the way leading to their cessation. For him, that view increases. He is not freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; he is not freed from suffering, I say.

“But the instructed noble disciple understands views, their origin, their cessation, and the way leading to their cessation. For him, that view ceases. He is freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; he is freed from suffering, I say.

“Knowing thus, seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple does not declare: ‘The Tathāgata exists after death’; or: ‘The Tathāgata does not exist after death’; or: ‘The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death’; or: ‘The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.’ Knowing thus, seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple does not make declarations regarding the undeclared points.

“Knowing thus, bhikkhu, seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple does not tremble, does not shake, does not vacillate, and does not become terrified regarding the undeclared points.

(2) “‘The Tathāgata exists after death’: this is an involvement with craving … (3) … this is \[69\] an involvement with perception … (4) … something conceived … (5) … a proliferation … (6) … an involvement with clinging … (7) … a \[ground for\] remorse; ‘The Tathāgata does not exist after death’: this is a \[ground for\] remorse; ‘The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death’: this is a \[ground for\] remorse; ‘The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death’: this is a \[ground for\] remorse.

“Bhikkhu, the uninstructed worldling does not understand remorse, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation. For him, that remorse increases. He is not freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; he is not freed from suffering, I say.

“But the instructed noble disciple understands remorse, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation. For him, that remorse ceases. He is freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; he is freed from suffering, I say.

“Knowing thus, seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple does not declare: ‘The Tathāgata exists after death’; or: ‘The Tathāgata does not exist after death’; or: ‘The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death’; or: ‘The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.’ Knowing thus, seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple does not make declarations regarding the undeclared points.

“Knowing thus, seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple does not tremble, does not shake, does not vacillate, and does not fall into terror regarding the undeclared points. \[70\]

“Bhikkhu, this is why doubt does not arise in the instructed noble disciple about the undeclared points.”
