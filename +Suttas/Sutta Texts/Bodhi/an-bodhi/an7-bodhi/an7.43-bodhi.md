# AN7.43 Bases for \[Being\] “Ten-less” (2)

> **Division:** IV. DEITIES

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Park. Then, in the morning, the Venerable Ānanda dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Kosambī for alms. It then occurred to him: “It is still too early to walk for alms in Kosambī. Let me go to the park of the wanderers of other sects.”

Then the Venerable Ānanda went to the park of the wanderers of other sects…. \[as in 7:42, substituting Ānanda for Sāriputta and Kosambī for Sāvatthī\] \[38\] … “Is it possible, Bhante, in this Dhamma and discipline to describe a bhikkhu as ‘ten-less’ by the mere counting of years?”

“In this Dhamma and discipline, Ānanda, it isn’t possible to describe a bhikkhu as ‘ten-less’ by the mere counting of years. There are, Ānanda, these seven bases for \[being\] ‘ten-less’ that I have proclaimed after realizing them for myself with direct knowledge. What seven? Here, a bhikkhu has (1) faith, (2) a sense of moral shame, (3) moral dread; (4) he is learned, (5) energetic, (6) mindful, and (7) wise. These are the seven bases for \[being\] ‘ten-less’ that I have proclaimed after realizing them for myself with direct knowledge. \[39\]

“Ānanda, if a bhikkhu possesses these seven bases for \[being\] ‘ten-less,’ then, if he lives the complete and pure spiritual life for twelve years, he is fit to be called ‘ten-less.’ If, too, he lives the complete and pure spiritual life for twenty-four years, he is fit to be called ‘ten-less.’ If, too, he lives the complete and pure spiritual life for thirty-six years, he is fit to be called ‘ten-less.’ If, too, he lives the complete and pure spiritual life for forty-eight years, he is fit to be called ‘ten-less.’”
