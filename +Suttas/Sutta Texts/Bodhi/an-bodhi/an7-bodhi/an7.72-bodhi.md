# AN7.72 Fire

> **Division:** II. THE GREAT CHAPTER

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was walking on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Then, while traveling along the highway, in a certain spot the Blessed One saw a great mass of fire burning, blazing, and glowing. He left the highway, sat down on the seat prepared for him at the foot of a tree, and addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, do you see that great mass of fire burning, blazing, and glowing?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

(1) “What do you think, bhikkhus? Which is better, to embrace that great mass of fire, burning, blazing, and glowing, and sit down or lie down next to it, or to embrace a girl with soft and tender hands and feet—whether from a khattiya, brahmin, or householder clan—and sit down or lie down next to her?”

“It would be far better, Bhante, to embrace a girl with soft and tender hands and feet—whether from a khattiya, brahmin, or householder clan—and sit down or lie down next to her. It would be painful to embrace that great mass of fire, burning, blazing, and glowing, and sit down or lie down next to it.”

“I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you that for an immoral man of bad character—one of impure and suspect behavior, secretive in his actions, not an ascetic though claiming to be one, not a celibate though claiming to be one, inwardly rotten, corrupt, depraved—it would be far better to embrace that great mass of fire, burning, blazing, and glowing, and sit down or lie down next to it. For what reason? Because on that account \[129\] he might undergo death or deadly pain, but for that reason he would not, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. But when that immoral man … embraces a girl with soft and tender hands and feet—whether from a khattiya, brahmin, or householder clan—and sits down or lies down next to her, this leads to his harm and suffering for a long time. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

(2) “What do you think, bhikkhus? Which is better, for a strong man to wrap a tough horsehair rope around both one’s shins and tighten it so that it cuts through one’s outer skin, inner skin, flesh, sinews, and bone, until it reaches the marrow, or for one to accept the homage of affluent khattiyas, brahmins, or householders?”

“It would be far better, Bhante, for one to accept the homage of affluent khattiyas, brahmins, or householders. It would be painful if a strong man were to wrap a tough horsehair rope around both one’s shins and tighten it so that it cuts through one’s outer skin, inner skin, flesh, sinews, and bone, until it reaches the marrow.”

“I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you that for an immoral man … it would be far better if a strong man were to wrap a tough horsehair rope around both his shins and tighten it so that it cuts through his outer skin, inner skin, flesh, sinews, and bone, until it reaches the marrow. For what reason? Because on that account he might undergo death or deadly pain, but for that reason he would not, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. \[130\] But when that immoral man … accepts the homage of affluent khattiyas, brahmins, or householders, this leads to his harm and suffering for a long time. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

(3) “What do you think, bhikkhus? Which is better, for a strong man to strike one in the breast with a sharp spear smeared with oil, or for one to accept reverential salutations from affluent khattiyas, brahmins, or householders?”

“It would be far better, Bhante, for one to accept reverential salutations from affluent khattiyas, brahmins, or householders. It would be painful if a strong man were to strike one in the breast with a sharp spear smeared with oil.”

“I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you that for an immoral man … it would be far better if a strong man were to strike him in the breast with a sharp spear smeared with oil. For what reason? Because on that account he might undergo death or deadly pain, but for that reason he would not, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

(4) “What do you think, bhikkhus? Which is better, for a strong man to wrap a hot iron sheet—burning, \[131\] blazing, and glowing—around one’s body, or for one to use a robe given out of faith by affluent khattiyas, brahmins, or householders?”

“It would be far better, Bhante, for one to use a robe given out of faith by affluent khattiyas, brahmins, or householders. It would be painful if a strong man were to wrap a hot iron sheet—burning, blazing, and glowing—around one’s body.”

“I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you that for an immoral man … it would be far better if a strong man were to wrap a hot iron sheet—burning, blazing, and glowing—around his body. For what reason? Because on that account he might undergo death or deadly pain, but for that reason he would not, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. But when that immoral man … makes use of a robe given out of faith by affluent khattiyas, brahmins, or householders, this leads to his harm and suffering for a long time. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

(5) “What do you think, bhikkhus? Which is better, for a strong man to force open one’s mouth with a hot iron spike—burning, blazing, and glowing—and insert a hot copper ball—burning, blazing, and glowing—which burns one’s lips, mouth, tongue, throat, and stomach, \[132\] and comes out from below taking along one’s entrails, or for one to consume almsfood given out of faith by affluent khattiyas, brahmins, or householders?”

“It would be far better, Bhante, for one to consume almsfood given out of faith by affluent khattiyas, brahmins, or householders. It would be painful if a strong man were to force open one’s mouth with a hot iron spike—burning, blazing, and glowing—and insert a hot copper ball … which burns one’s lips … and comes out from below taking along one’s entrails.”

With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

(6) “What do you think, bhikkhus? Which is better, for a strong man to grab one by the head or shoulders \[133\] and force one to sit or lie down on a hot iron bed or chair—burning, blazing, and glowing—or for one to use a bed and chair given out of faith by affluent khattiyas, brahmins, or householders?”

“It would be far better, Bhante, for one to use a bed and chair given out of faith by affluent khattiyas, brahmins, or householders. It would be painful if a strong man were to grab one by the head or shoulders and force one to sit or lie down on a hot iron bed or chair, burning, blazing, and glowing.”

“I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you that for an immoral man … it would be far better if a strong man were to grab him by the head or shoulders and force him to sit or lie down on a hot iron bed or chair, burning, blazing, and glowing.

(7) “What do you think, bhikkhus? Which is better, for a strong man to grab one, turn one upside down, and throw one into a hot copper cauldron—burning, blazing, and glowing—and while one is boiling there in a swirl of froth, one sometimes rises, sometimes sinks, and sometimes is swept across, or for one to use a dwelling given out of faith by affluent khattiyas, \[134\] brahmins, or householders?”

“It would be far better, Bhante, for one to use a dwelling given out of faith by affluent khattiyas, brahmins, or householders. It would be painful if a strong man were to grab one, turn one upside down, and throw one into a hot copper cauldron—burning, blazing, and glowing—so that while one is boiling there in a swirl of froth, one sometimes rises, sometimes sinks, and sometimes is swept across.”

“I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you that for an immoral man of bad character—one of impure and suspect behavior, secretive in his actions, not an ascetic though claiming to be one, not a celibate though claiming to be one, inwardly rotten, corrupt, depraved—it would be far better for a strong man to grab him, turn him upside down, and throw him into a hot copper cauldron—burning, blazing, and glowing—so that while he is boiling there in a swirl of froth, he sometimes rises, sometimes sinks, and sometimes is swept across.

With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

“Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘When we use robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick, these services that \[others\] provide for us will be of great fruit and benefit to them, and this going forth of ours will not be barren, but fruitful and fertile.’ Thus should you train yourselves. Considering your own good, bhikkhus, it is enough to strive for the goal with heedfulness; considering the good of others, \[135\] it is enough to strive for the goal with heedfulness; considering the good of both, it is enough to strive for the goal with heedfulness.”

This is what the Blessed One said. Now while this exposition was being spoken, sixty bhikkhus vomited hot blood. Sixty bhikkhus gave up the training and returned to the lower life, saying: “It is difficult to do, Blessed One, very difficult to do.” And the minds of sixty bhikkhus were liberated from the taints by non-clinging.
