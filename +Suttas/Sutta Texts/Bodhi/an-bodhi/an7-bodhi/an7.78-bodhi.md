# AN7.78 An Expert in the Discipline (4)

> **Division:** III. THE DISCIPLINE

“Bhikkhus, possessing seven qualities, a bhikkhu is an expert in the discipline. What seven?

“(1) He knows what is an offense. (2) He knows what is not an offense. (3) He knows what is a light offense. (4) He knows what is a grave offense. (5) He recollects his manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births … \[as in 6:2 §4\] … he recollects his manifold past abodes with their aspects and details. (6) With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human … \[as in 6:2 §5\] … he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma. (7) With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge … the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom … he dwells in it.

“Possessing these seven qualities, a bhikkhu is an expert in the discipline.” \[142\]
