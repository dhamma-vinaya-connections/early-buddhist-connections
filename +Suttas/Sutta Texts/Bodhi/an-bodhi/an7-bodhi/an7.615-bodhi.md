# AN7.615

> **Division:** VI. LUST AND SO FORTH REPETITION SERIES

“Bhikkhus, for direct knowledge … for full understanding … for the utter destruction … for the abandoning … for the destruction … for the vanishing … for the fading away … for the cessation … for the giving up … for the relinquishment of hatred … of delusion … of anger … of hostility … of denigration … of insolence … of envy … of miserliness … of deceitfulness … of craftiness … of obstinacy … of vehemence … of conceit … of arrogance … of intoxication … of heedlessness … these seven things are to be developed.” \[149\]

This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One’s statement.

The Book of the Sevens is finished.
