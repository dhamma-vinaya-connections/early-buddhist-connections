# AN7.7 Ugga

> **Division:** I. WEALTH

Then Ugga the king’s chief minister approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

“It’s astounding and amazing, Bhante, how Migāra of Rohaṇa is so rich, with such great wealth and property.”

“But how \[7\] rich is Migāra of Rohaṇa? How much wealth and property does he have?”

“He has a hundred thousand units of minted gold, not to mention silver.”

“There is that kind of wealth, Ugga; this I don’t deny. But that kind of wealth can be taken away by fire, water, kings, thieves, and displeasing heirs. However, Ugga, these seven kinds of wealth cannot be taken away by fire, water, kings, thieves, and displeasing heirs. What seven? The wealth of faith, the wealth of virtuous behavior, the wealth of moral shame, the wealth of moral dread, the wealth of learning, the wealth of generosity, and the wealth of wisdom. These seven kinds of wealth cannot be taken away by fire, water, kings, thieves, and displeasing heirs.”

\[The verses are identical with those of 7:5.\]
