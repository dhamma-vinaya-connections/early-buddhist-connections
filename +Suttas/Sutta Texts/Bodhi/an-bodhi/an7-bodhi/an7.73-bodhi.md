# AN7.73 Sunetta

> **Division:** II. THE GREAT CHAPTER

(1) “Bhikkhus, in the past there was a teacher named Sunetta, the founder of a spiritual sect, one without lust for sensual pleasures. The teacher Sunetta had many hundreds of disciples to whom he taught a Dhamma for companionship with the brahmā world. When he was teaching such a Dhamma, those who did not place confidence in him were, with the breakup of the body, after death, reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but those who placed confidence in him were reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.

“In the past, bhikkhus, (2) there was a teacher named Mūgapakkha … (3) there was a teacher named Aranemi … (4) there was a teacher named Kuddāla … (5) there was a teacher named Hatthipāla … (6)there was a teacher named Jotipāla … (7) there was a teacher named Araka, the founder of a spiritual sect, one without lust for sensual pleasures. The teacher Araka had many hundreds of disciples to whom he taught a Dhamma for companionship with the brahmā world. When he \[136\] was teaching such a Dhamma, those who did not place confidence in him were, with the breakup of the body, after death, reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but those who placed confidence in him were reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.

“What do you think, bhikkhus? These seven teachers were founders of spiritual sects, men without lust for sensual pleasures who had retinues of many hundreds of disciples. If, with a mind of hatred, one had insulted and reviled them and their communities of disciples, wouldn’t one have generated much demerit?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

“If, with a mind of hatred, one had insulted and reviled these six teachers together with their communities of disciples, one would have generated much demerit. But if, with a mind of hatred, one reviles and abuses a single person accomplished in view, one generates even more demerit. For what reason? I say, bhikkhus, there is no injury against outsiders like that against \[your\] fellow monks. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will not let hatred toward our fellow monks arise in our minds.’ Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves.”
