# AN7.37 A Friend (2)

> **Division:** IV. DEITIES

“Bhikkhus, one should associate with a bhikkhu friend who possesses seven qualities; one should resort to him and attend on him even if he dismisses you. What seven? (1) He is pleasing and agreeable; (2) he is respected and (3) esteemed; (4) he is a speaker; (5) he patiently endures being spoken to; (6) he gives deep talks; and (7) he does not enjoin one to do what is wrong.”

He is dear, respected, and esteemed,

a speaker and one who endures speech;

he gives deep talks and does not enjoin one

to do what is wrong.

The person here in whom

these qualities are found is a friend,

benevolent and compassionate.

Even if one is dismissed by him,

one desiring a friend

should resort to such a person.
