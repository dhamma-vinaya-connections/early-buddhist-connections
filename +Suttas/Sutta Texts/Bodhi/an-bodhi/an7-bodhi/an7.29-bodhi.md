# AN7.29 Decline

> **Division:** III. THE VAJJI SEVEN

“Bhikkhus, these seven things lead to the decline of a lay follower. What seven? (1) He stops seeing bhikkhus; (2) he neglects listening to the good Dhamma; (3) he does not train in the higher virtuous behavior; (4) he is full of suspicion toward bhikkhus, whether they be elders, newly ordained, or of middle standing; (5) he listens to the Dhamma with a mind bent on criticism, seeking to find faults with it; (6) he seeks a person worthy of offerings among outsiders; (7) he first does \[meritorious\] deeds there. These seven things lead to the decline of a lay follower.

“Bhikkhus, these seven things lead to the non-decline of a lay follower. What seven? (1) He does not stop seeing bhikkhus; (2) he does not neglect listening to the good Dhamma; (3) he trains in the higher virtuous behavior; (4) he is full of confidence in bhikkhus, whether they be elders, newly ordained, or of middle standing; (5) he listens to the Dhamma with a mind that is not bent on criticism, not seeking to find faults with it; (6) he does not seek a person worthy of offerings among outsiders; (7) he first does \[meritorious\] deeds here. These seven things lead to the non-decline of a lay follower.” \[26\]

The lay follower who stops seeing

\[bhikkhus\] who have developed themselves,

\[who stops\] hearing the noble ones’ teachings,

and does not train in the higher virtue;

whose suspicion toward the bhikkhus

is ever on the increase;

who wants to listen to the good Dhamma

with a mind bent on criticism;

the lay follower who seeks

one worthy of offerings among outsiders

and first undertakes to do

meritorious deeds toward them:

these seven well-taught principles

describe what leads to decline.

A lay follower who resorts to them

falls away from the good Dhamma.

and trains in the higher virtue;

whose confidence in the bhikkhus

is ever on the increase;

who wants to listen to the good Dhamma

with a mind not bent on criticism;

the lay follower who seeks none

worthy of offerings among outsiders;

but who here first undertakes

to do meritorious deeds:

these seven well-taught principles

describe what leads to non-decline.

A lay follower who resorts to them

does not fall away from the good Dhamma.
