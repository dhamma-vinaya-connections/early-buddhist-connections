# AN7.34 Easy to Correct (1)

> **Division:** IV. DEITIES

“Last night, bhikkhus, when the night had advanced, a certain deity of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said to me: ‘Bhante, there are these seven qualities that lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu. What seven? Reverence for the Teacher, reverence for the Dhamma, reverence for the Saṅgha, reverence for the training, reverence for concentration, being easy to correct, and good friendship. These seven qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu.’ This is what that deity said. Then the deity paid homage to me, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there.”

Respectful toward the Teacher,

respectful toward the Dhamma,

deeply revering the Saṅgha,

respectful toward concentration, ardent,

deeply respectful toward the training;

cultivating good friends,

being easy to correct,

deferential and reverential:

such a one cannot fall away

but is close to nibbāna. \[30\]
