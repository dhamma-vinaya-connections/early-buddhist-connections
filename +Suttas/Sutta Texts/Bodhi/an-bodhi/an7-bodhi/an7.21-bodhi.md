# AN7.21 Sārandada

> **Division:** III. THE VAJJI SEVEN

\[16\] Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī at the Sārandada Shrine. Then a number of Licchavis approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One said this to them:

“I will teach you, Licchavis, seven principles of non-decline. Listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante,” those Licchavis replied. The Blessed One said this:

“And what, Licchavis, are the seven principles of non-decline?

(1) “Licchavis, as long as the Vajjis assemble often and hold frequent assemblies, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(2) “As long as the Vajjis assemble in harmony, adjourn in harmony, and conduct the affairs of the Vajjis in harmony, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(3) “As long as the Vajjis do not decree anything that has not been decreed or abolish anything that has already been decreed but undertake and follow the ancient Vajji principles as they have been decreed, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(4) “As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajji elders and think they should be heeded, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(5) “As long as the Vajjis do not abduct women and girls from their families and force them to live with them, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(6) “As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate their traditional shrines, both those within \[the city\] and those outside, \[17\] and do not neglect the righteous oblations as given and done to them in the past, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(7) “As long as the Vajjis provide righteous protection, shelter, and guard for arahants, \[with the intention\]: ‘How can those arahants who have not yet come here come to our realm, and how can those arahants who have already come dwell at ease here?’ only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

“Licchavis, as long as these seven principles of non-decline continue among the Vajjis, and the Vajjis are seen \[established\] in them, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.”
