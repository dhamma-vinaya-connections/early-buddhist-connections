# AN7.76 An Expert in the Discipline (2)

> **Division:** III. THE DISCIPLINE

“Bhikkhus, possessing seven qualities, a bhikkhu is an expert in the discipline. What seven?

“(1) He knows what is an offense. (2) He knows what is not an offense. (3) He knows what is a light offense. (4) He knows what is a grave offense. (5) Both Pātimokkhas have been well transmitted to him in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well determined in terms of the rules and their detailed explication. (6) He is \[141\] one who gains at will … the four jhānas…. (7) With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge … the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom … he dwells in it.

“Possessing these seven qualities, a bhikkhu is an expert in the discipline.”
