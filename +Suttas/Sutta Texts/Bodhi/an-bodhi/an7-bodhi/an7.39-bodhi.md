# AN7.39 Analytical Knowledges (2)

> **Division:** IV. DEITIES

“Bhikkhus, when he possessed seven qualities, Sāriputta realized for himself with direct knowledge the four analytical knowledges and acquired mastery over them. What seven?

“Here, (1) Sāriputta understood as it really is: ‘This is mental sluggishness in me.’ (2) Or when the mind was constricted internally, he understood as it really is: ‘My mind is constricted internally.’ (3) Or when his mind was distracted externally, he understood as it really is: ‘My mind is distracted externally.’ (4) For him, feelings were known as they arose, as they remained present, as they disappeared; (5) perceptions were known as they arose, as they remained present, as they disappeared; (6) thoughts were known as they arose, as they remained present, as they disappeared. (7) Then, among qualities suitable and unsuitable, inferior and superior, dark and bright along with their counterparts, he took up the mark well, attended to it well, reflected upon it well, and penetrated it well with wisdom. When he possessed these seven qualities, Sāriputta realized for himself with direct knowledge the four analytical knowledges and acquired mastery over them.” \[34\]
