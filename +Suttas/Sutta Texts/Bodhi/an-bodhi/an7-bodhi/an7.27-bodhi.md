# AN7.27 Non-Decline (5)

> **Division:** III. THE VAJJI SEVEN

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you seven principles of non-decline. Listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“And what, bhikkhus, are the seven principles of non-decline? (1) As long as the bhikkhus develop the perception of impermanence, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline. (2) As long as they develop the perception of non-self … (3) … the perception of unattractiveness … (4) … the perception of danger … (5) … the perception of abandoning … (6) … the perception of dispassion … (7) … the perception of cessation, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

“Bhikkhus, as long as these seven principles of non-decline continue among the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus are seen \[established\] in them, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.”
