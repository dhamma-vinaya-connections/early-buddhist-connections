# AN7.32 Heedfulness

> **Division:** IV. DEITIES

Then, when the night had advanced, a certain deity of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, \[28\] approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to the Blessed One:

“Bhante, there are these seven qualities that lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu. What seven? Reverence for the Teacher, reverence for the Dhamma, reverence for the Saṅgha, reverence for the training, reverence for concentration, reverence for heedfulness, and reverence for hospitality. These seven qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu.”

This is what that deity said. The Teacher agreed. Then that deity, \[thinking\]: “The Teacher agrees with me,” paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and disappeared right there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Last night, bhikkhus, when the night had advanced, a certain deity of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said to me: ‘Bhante, there are these seven qualities that lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu. What seven? Reverence for the Teacher … and reverence for hospitality. These seven qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu.’ This is what that deity said. Then that deity paid homage to me, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there.”

Respectful toward the Teacher,

respectful toward the Dhamma,

deeply revering the Saṅgha,

respectful toward concentration, ardent,

deeply respectful toward the training;

respectful toward heedfulness,

holding hospitality in reverence:

this bhikkhu cannot fall away,

but is close to nibbāna.
