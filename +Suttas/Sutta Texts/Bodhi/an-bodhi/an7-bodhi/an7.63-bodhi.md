# AN7.63 Wives

> **Division:** I. UNDECLARED

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the residence of the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, where he sat down on the seat that was prepared for him.

Now on that occasion, people in Anāthapiṇḍika’s residence were making an uproar and a racket. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

“Householder, why are people in your residence making such an uproar and a racket? One would think it was fishermen at a haul of fish.”

“This, Bhante, is my daughter-in-law Sujātā, who is rich and has been brought here from a rich family. She doesn’t obey her father-in-law, her mother-in-law, or her husband. She doesn’t even honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Blessed One.”

Then the Blessed One addressed Sujātā: “Come here, Sujātā.”

“Yes, Bhante,” she replied. She went to the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to her: \[92\]

“Sujātā, a man might have seven kinds of wives. What seven? One like a killer, one like a thief, one like a tyrant, one like a mother, one like a sister, one like a friend, and one like a slave. A man might have these seven kinds of wives. Which one are you?”

“Bhante, I do not understand in detail the meaning of this statement that the Blessed One has spoken in brief. Please let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might understand in detail the meaning of this statement spoken in brief.”

“Then listen and attend closely, Sujātā. I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante,” she replied. The Blessed One said this:

“With hateful mind, devoid of sympathy,

lusting for others, despising her husband,

she seeks to kill the one who bought her with wealth:

a wife like this is called a wife and a killer.

“When the woman’s husband acquires wealth

by toiling at a craft, trade, or farming,

she tries to steal it, even if \[he earns\] but little:

a wife like this is called a wife and a thief.

“The lazy glutton, unwilling to work,

harsh, fierce, rough in speech,

a woman who dominates her own supporters:

a wife like this is called a wife and a tyrant. \[93\]

“One always benevolent and sympathetic,

who guards her husband as a mother her son,

who protects the wealth he earns:

a wife like this is called a wife and a mother.

“She who holds her husband in high regard

as younger sister her elder brother,

conscientious, following her husband’s will:

a wife like this is called a wife and a sister.

“One who rejoices when she sees her husband

as if seeing a friend after a long absence;

well raised, virtuous, devoted to her husband:

a wife like this is called a wife and a friend.

“One who remains patient and calm,

when threatened with violence by the rod,

who tolerates her husband with a mind free of hate,

patient, submissive to her husband’s will:

a wife like this is called a wife and a slave.

“The types of wives here called

a killer, a thief, and a tyrant,

immoral, harsh, disrespectful,

with the body’s breakup go to hell.

“But the types of wives here called

mother, sister, friend, and slave,

firm in virtue, long restrained,

with the body’s breakup go to heaven.

“A man, Sujātā, might have these seven kinds of wives. Now which one are you?” \[94\]

“Beginning today, Bhante, let the Blessed One consider me a wife who is like a slave.”
