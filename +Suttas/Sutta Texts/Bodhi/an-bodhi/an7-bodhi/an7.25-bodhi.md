# AN7.25 Non-Decline (3)

> **Division:** III. THE VAJJI SEVEN

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you seven principles of non-decline. Listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this: \[23\]

“And what, bhikkhus, are the seven principles of non-decline?

(1) “As long as the bhikkhus are endowed with faith, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline. (2) As long as they have a sense of moral shame … (3) … have moral dread … (4) … are learned … (5) … are energetic … (6) … are mindful … (7) … are wise, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

“Bhikkhus, as long as these seven principles of non-decline continue among the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus are seen \[established\] in them, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.”
