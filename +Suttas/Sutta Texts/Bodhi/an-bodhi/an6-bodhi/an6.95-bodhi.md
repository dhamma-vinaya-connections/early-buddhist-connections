# AN6.95 Cases (4)

> **Division:** IV. COOLNESS

“Bhikkhus, there are these six cases of incapability. What six? One accomplished in view is (1) incapable of resorting to \[the view that\] pleasure and pain are made by oneself; (2) incapable of resorting to \[the view that\] pleasure and pain are made by another; (3) incapable of resorting to \[the view that\] pleasure and pain are both made by oneself and made by another; (4) incapable of resorting to \[the view that\] pleasure and pain are not made by oneself but have arisen fortuitously; (5) incapable of resorting to \[the view that\] pleasure and pain are not made by another but have arisen fortuitously; (6) incapable of resorting to \[the view that\] pleasure and pain are made neither by oneself nor by another but have arisen fortuitously. For what reason? Because the person accomplished in view has clearly seen causation and causally arisen phenomena. These are the six cases of incapability.” \[441\]
