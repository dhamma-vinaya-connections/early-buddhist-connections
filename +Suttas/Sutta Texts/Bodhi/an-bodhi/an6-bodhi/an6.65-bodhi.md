# AN6.65 Non-Returner

> **Division:** II. NON-RETURNER

“Bhikkhus, without having abandoned six things, one is incapable of realizing the fruit of non-returning. What six? Lack of faith, lack of moral shame, moral recklessness, laziness, muddle-mindedness, and lack of wisdom. Without having abandoned these six things, one is incapable of realizing the fruit of non-returning.

“Bhikkhus, having abandoned six things, one is capable of realizing the fruit of non-returning. What six? Lack of faith … lack of wisdom. Having abandoned these six things, one is capable of realizing the fruit of non-returning.”
