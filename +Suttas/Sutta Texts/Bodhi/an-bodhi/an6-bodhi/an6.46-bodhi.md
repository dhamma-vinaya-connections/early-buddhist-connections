# AN6.46 Cunda

> **Division:** V. DHAMMIKA

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Venerable Mahācunda was dwelling among the Cetis at Sahajāti. There he addressed the bhikkhus:

“Friends, bhikkhus!”

“Friend!” those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Mahācunda said this:

(1) “Here, friends, bhikkhus who are Dhamma specialists disparage those bhikkhus who are meditators, saying: ‘They meditate and cogitate, \[claiming\]: “We are meditators, we are meditators!” Why do they meditate? In what way do they meditate? How do they meditate?’ In this case, the bhikkhus who are Dhamma specialists aren’t pleased, and the bhikkhus who are meditators aren’t pleased, and they aren’t practicing for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, of devas and human beings.

(2) “But the meditating bhikkhus disparage the bhikkhus who are Dhamma specialists, saying: ‘They are restless, puffed up, vain, talkative, rambling in their talk, muddle-minded, lacking clear comprehension, unconcentrated, with wandering minds, with loose sense faculties, \[claiming\]: “We are Dhamma specialists, we are Dhamma specialists!” Why are they Dhamma specialists? In what way are they Dhamma specialists? How are they Dhamma specialists?’ In this case, the meditators aren’t pleased, and the Dhamma specialists aren’t pleased, and they aren’t practicing for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, of devas and human beings.

(3) “Friends, the bhikkhus who are Dhamma specialists praise only bhikkhus who are Dhamma specialists, not those who are meditators. In this case, the bhikkhus who are Dhamma specialists \[356\] aren’t pleased, and those who are meditators aren’t pleased, and they aren’t practicing for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, of devas and human beings.

(4) “But the bhikkhus who are meditators praise only bhikkhus who are also meditators, not those who are Dhamma specialists. In this case, the bhikkhus who are meditators aren’t pleased, and those who are Dhamma specialists aren’t pleased, and they aren’t practicing for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, of devas and human beings.

(5) “Therefore, friends, you should train yourselves thus: ‘Those of us who are Dhamma specialists will praise those bhikkhus who are meditators.’ Thus should you train yourselves. For what reason? Because, friends, these persons are astounding and rare in the world who dwell having touched the deathless element with the body.

(6) “Therefore, friends, you should train yourselves thus: ‘Those of us who are meditators will praise those bhikkhus who are Dhamma specialists.’ Thus should you train yourselves. For what reason? Because, friends, these persons are astounding and rare in the world who see a deep and pithy matter after piercing it through with wisdom.”
