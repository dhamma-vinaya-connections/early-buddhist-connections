“Bhikkhus, without having abandoned six things, one is incapable of contemplating the body in the body. What six? Delight in work, delight in talk, delight in sleep, delight in company, not guarding the doors of the sense faculties, and being immoderate in eating. Without having abandoned these six things, one is incapable of contemplating the body in the body. \[450\]

“Bhikkhus, having abandoned six things, one is capable of contemplating the body in the body. What six? Delight in work … being immoderate in eating. Having abandoned these six things, one is capable of contemplating the body in the body.”

What six? Delight in work, delight in talk, delight in sleep, delight in company, not guarding the doors of the sense faculties, and being immoderate in eating.

“Bhikkhus, by having abandoned six things, one is capable of contemplating phenomena in phenomena both internally and externally. What six? Delight in work … being immoderate in eating.

119 Tapussa
“Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, the householder Tapussa has reached certainty about the Tathāgata and become a seer of the deathless, one who lives having realized the deathless. What six? \[451\] Unwavering confidence in the Buddha, unwavering confidence in the Dhamma, unwavering confidence in the Saṅgha, noble virtuous behavior, noble knowledge, and noble liberation. Possessing these six qualities, the householder Tapussa has reached certainty about the Tathāgata and become a seer of the deathless, one who lives having realized the deathless.”


120

“Bhikkhus, for direct knowledge of lust, six things are to be developed. What six? \[452\] The unsurpassed sight, the unsurpassed hearing, the unsurpassed gain, the unsurpassed training, the unsurpassed service, and the unsurpassed recollection. For direct knowledge of lust, these six things are to be developed.”


 141

“Bhikkhus, for direct knowledge … for full understanding … for the utter destruction … for the abandoning … for the destruction … for the vanishing … for the fading away … for the cessation … for the giving up … for the relinquishment of hatred … of delusion … of anger … of hostility … of denigration … of insolence … of envy … of miserliness … of deceitfulness … of craftiness … of obstinacy … of vehemence … of conceit … of arrogance … of intoxication … of heedlessness … these six things are to be developed.”

This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One’s statement.

The Book of the Sixes is finished.
