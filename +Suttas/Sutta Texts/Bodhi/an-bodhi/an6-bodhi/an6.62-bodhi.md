# AN6.62 Knowledge

> **Division:** I. THE GREAT CHAPTER

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus when he arrived at a Kosalan town named Daṇḍakappaka. Then the Blessed One left the highway and sat down on a seat that was prepared for him at the foot of a tree, and those bhikkhus entered Daṇḍakappaka to search for a rest house.

Then the Venerable Ānanda together with a number of bhikkhus went down to the Aciravatī River to bathe. Having finished bathing and come back out, he stood in one robe drying his body. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Venerable Ānanda and said to him: “Friend Ānanda, was it after full consideration that the Blessed One declared of Devadatta: ‘Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for the eon, unredeemable,’ or did he say this only figuratively?”

“It was just in this way, friend, that the Blessed One declared it.”

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and \[reported what had happened, ending\]: \[403\] “When this was said, Bhante, I said to that bhikkhu: ‘It was just in this way, friend, that the Blessed One declared it.’”

\[The Blessed One said:\] “Ānanda, that bhikkhu must be either newly ordained, not long gone forth, or a foolish and incompetent elder. For when this was declared by me definitively, how can he see any ambiguity in it? I do not see even one other person, Ānanda, about whom I have made a declaration after giving him such full consideration as Devadatta. As long as I saw even a mere fraction of a hair’s tip of a bright quality in Devadatta, I did not declare of him: ‘Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable.’ It was, Ānanda, only when I did not see even a mere fraction of a hair’s tip of a bright quality in Devadatta that I declared this of him.

“Suppose there was a cesspit deeper than a man’s height full of feces right up to the top, and a man was sunk in it so that his head was submerged. Then a man would appear desiring his good, welfare, and security, wishing to pull him out from the cesspit. He would go around the cesspit on all sides but would not see even a mere fraction of a hair’s tip of the man not smeared with feces \[404\] where he might get a grip and pull him out. So too, Ānanda, it was only when I did not see even a mere fraction of a hair’s tip of a bright quality in Devadatta that I declared of him: ‘Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable.’

“If, Ānanda, you would listen to the Tathāgata’s knowledges of a person’s faculties, I will analyze them.”

“It is the time for this, Blessed One! It is the time for this, Fortunate One! The Blessed One should analyze his knowledges of a person’s faculties. Having heard this from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind.”

“Well then, Ānanda, listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante,” the Venerable Ānanda replied. The Blessed One said this:

(1) “Here, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand some person thus: ‘Wholesome qualities and unwholesome qualities are found in this person.’ On a later occasion, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand him thus: ‘This person’s wholesome qualities have disappeared, unwholesome qualities are manifest, but he has a wholesome root that has not been eradicated. From that wholesome root of his the wholesome will appear. Thus this person will not be subject to decline in the future.’ Suppose seeds that are intact, unspoiled, not damaged by wind and the sun’s heat, fecund, well preserved, were deposited in well-prepared soil in a good field. Wouldn’t you know: ‘These seeds will grow, increase, and mature’?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

“In the same way, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind … \[405\] … I understand him thus: ‘This person’s wholesome qualities have disappeared, unwholesome qualities are manifest, but he has a wholesome root that has not been eradicated. From that wholesome root of his the wholesome will appear. Thus this person will not be subject to decline in the future.’ In this way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata knows a person by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata has knowledge of a person’s faculties, acquired by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata knows the future origination of qualities by encompassing \[another’s\] mind with his own mind.

(2) “Then, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand some person thus: ‘Wholesome qualities and unwholesome qualities are found in this person.’ On a later occasion, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand him thus: ‘This person’s unwholesome qualities have disappeared, wholesome qualities are manifest, but he has an unwholesome root that has not been eradicated. From that unwholesome root of his the unwholesome will appear. Thus this person will be subject to decline in the future.’ Suppose, Ānanda, seeds that are intact, unspoiled, not damaged by wind and the sun’s heat, fecund, well preserved, were deposited on a wide rock. Wouldn’t you know: ‘These seeds will not grow, increase, and mature’?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

“In the same way, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind … I understand him thus: ‘This person’s unwholesome qualities have disappeared, wholesome qualities are manifest, but he has an unwholesome root that has not been eradicated. From that unwholesome root of his the unwholesome will appear. Thus this person \[406\] will be subject to decline in the future.’ In this way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata knows a person by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata has knowledge of a person’s faculties, acquired by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata knows the future origination of qualities by encompassing \[another’s\] mind with his own mind.

(3) “Then, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand some person thus: ‘Wholesome qualities and unwholesome qualities are found in this person.’ On a later occasion, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand him thus: ‘This person does not have even a mere fraction of a hair’s tip of a bright quality. This person possesses exclusively black, unwholesome qualities. With the breakup of the body, after death, he will be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.’ Suppose, Ānanda, seeds that are broken, spoiled, damaged by wind and the sun’s heat, were deposited in well-prepared soil in a good field. Wouldn’t you know: ‘These seeds will not grow, increase, and mature’?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

“In the same way, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind … I understand him thus: ‘This person does not have even a mere fraction of a hair’s tip of a bright quality. This person possesses exclusively black, unwholesome qualities. With the breakup of the body, after death, he will be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.’ In this way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata knows a person by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata has knowledge of a person’s faculties, acquired by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata knows the future origination of qualities by encompassing \[another’s\] mind with his own mind.”

When this was said, the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: \[407\] “Is it possible, Bhante, to describe three other persons as the counterparts of those three?”

“It is possible, Ānanda,” the Blessed One said.

(4) “Here, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand some person thus: ‘Wholesome qualities and unwholesome qualities are found in this person.’ On a later occasion, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand him thus: ‘This person’s wholesome qualities have disappeared, unwholesome qualities are manifest, but he has a wholesome root that has not been eradicated. That, too, is about to be completely destroyed. Thus this person will be subject to decline in the future.’ Suppose, Ānanda, coals that are burning, blazing, and glowing were deposited on a wide rock. Wouldn’t you know: ‘These coals will not grow, increase, and spread’?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

“Or suppose, Ānanda, it is evening and the sun is setting. Wouldn’t you know: ‘Light will disappear and darkness will appear’?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

“Or suppose, Ānanda, it is close to midnight, the time for a meal. Wouldn’t you know: ‘Light has disappeared and darkness has appeared’?

“Yes, Bhante.”

“In the same way, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind … I understand him thus: ‘This person’s wholesome qualities have disappeared, unwholesome qualities are manifest, but he has a wholesome root that has not been eradicated. That, too, is about to be completely destroyed. Thus this person will be subject to decline in the future.’ In this way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata knows a person by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, \[408\] the Tathāgata has knowledge of a person’s faculties, acquired by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata knows the future origination of qualities by encompassing \[another’s\] mind with his own mind.

(5) “Then, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand some person thus: ‘Wholesome qualities and unwholesome qualities are found in this person.’ On a later occasion, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand him thus: ‘This person’s unwholesome qualities have disappeared, wholesome qualities are manifest, but he has an unwholesome root that has not been eradicated. That, too, is about to be completely destroyed. Thus this person will not be subject to decline in the future.’ Suppose, Ānanda, coals that are burning, blazing, and glowing were deposited on a heap of dry grass or firewood. Wouldn’t you know: ‘These coals will grow, increase, and spread’?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

“Or suppose, Ānanda, it is the time when the night is fading and the sun is rising. Wouldn’t you know: ‘Darkness will disappear and light will appear’?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

“Or suppose, Ānanda, it is close to noon, the time for a meal. Wouldn’t you know: ‘Darkness has disappeared and light has appeared’?

“Yes, Bhante.”

“In the same way, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind … I understand him thus: ‘This person’s unwholesome qualities have disappeared, wholesome qualities are manifest, but he has an unwholesome root that has not been eradicated. That, too, is about to be completely destroyed. Thus this person will not be subject to decline in the future.’ In this way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata knows a person by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata has knowledge of a person’s faculties, \[409\] acquired by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata knows the future origination of qualities by encompassing \[another’s\] mind with his own mind.

(6) “Then, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand some person thus: ‘Wholesome qualities and unwholesome qualities are found in this person.’ On a later occasion, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand him thus: ‘This person does not have even a mere fraction of a hair’s tip of an unwholesome quality. This person possesses exclusively bright, blameless qualities. He will attain nibbāna in this very life.’ Suppose, Ānanda, coals that are cool and extinguished were deposited on a heap of dry grass or firewood. Wouldn’t you know: ‘These coals will not grow, increase, and spread’?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

“In the same way, Ānanda, having encompassed the mind of someone with my own mind … I understand him thus: ‘This person does not have even a mere fraction of a hair’s tip of an unwholesome quality. This person possesses exclusively bright, blameless qualities. He will attain nibbāna in this very life.’ In this way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata knows a person by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata has knowledge of a person’s faculties, acquired by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata knows the future origination of qualities by encompassing \[another’s\] mind with his own mind.

“Ānanda, among the former three persons, one is not subject to decline, one is subject to decline, and one is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell. Among the latter three persons, one is not subject to decline, one is subject to decline, and one is bound to attain nibbāna.” \[410\]
