# AN6.22 Non-Decline

> **Division:** III. THE UNSURPASSED THINGS

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you these six qualities that lead to non-decline. Listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“And what, bhikkhus, are the six qualities that lead to non-decline? Not taking delight in work, not taking delight in talk, not taking delight in sleep, not taking delight in company, being easy to correct, and good friendship. These are the six qualities that lead to non-decline.

“Bhikkhus, all those in the past who did not decline in wholesome qualities did not decline because of these six qualities. All those in the future who will not decline in wholesome qualities will not decline because of these six qualities. And all those at present who are not declining in wholesome qualities are not declining because of these six qualities.”
