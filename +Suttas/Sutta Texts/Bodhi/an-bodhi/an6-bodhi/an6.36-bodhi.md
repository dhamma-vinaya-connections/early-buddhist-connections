# AN6.36 Disputes

> **Division:** IV. DEITIES

“Bhikkhus, there are these six roots of disputes. What six?

(1) “Here, a bhikkhu is angry and hostile. When a bhikkhu is angry and hostile, he dwells without respect and deference toward the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and he does not fulfill the training. Such a bhikkhu creates a dispute in the Saṅgha that leads to the harm of many people, to the unhappiness of many people, to the ruin, harm, and suffering of devas and humans. If, bhikkhus, you perceive any such root of dispute either in yourselves or in others, you should strive to abandon this evil root of dispute. And if you do not perceive any such root of dispute either in yourselves or in others, you should practice so that this evil root of dispute does not emerge in the future. \[335\] In such a way this evil root of dispute is abandoned and does not emerge in the future.

(2) “Again, a bhikkhu is a denigrator and insolent … (3) … envious and miserly … (4) … crafty and hypocritical … (5) … one who has evil desires and wrong view … (6) … one who adheres to his own views, holds to them tenaciously, and relinquishes them with difficulty. When a bhikkhu adheres to his own views, holds to them tenaciously, and relinquishes them with difficulty, he dwells without respect and deference toward the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and he does not fulfill the training. Such a bhikkhu creates a dispute in the Saṅgha that leads to the harm of many people, to the unhappiness of many people, to the ruin, harm, and suffering of devas and humans. If, bhikkhus, you perceive any such root of dispute either in yourselves or in others, you should strive to abandon this evil root of dispute. And if you do not perceive any such root of dispute either in yourselves or others, you should practice so that this evil root of dispute does not emerge in the future. In such a way this evil root of dispute is abandoned and does not emerge in the future.

“These, bhikkhus, are the six roots of dispute.” \[336\]
