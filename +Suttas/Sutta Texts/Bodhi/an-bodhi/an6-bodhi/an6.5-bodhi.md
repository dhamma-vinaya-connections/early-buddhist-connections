# AN6.5 Thoroughbred (1)

> **Division:** I. WORTHY OF GIFTS

“Bhikkhus, possessing six factors, a king’s excellent thoroughbred horse is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship. What six? Here, a king’s excellent thoroughbred horse patiently endures forms, patiently endures sounds, patiently endures odors, patiently endures tastes, patiently endures tactile objects, and it is endowed with beauty. Possessing these six factors, a king’s excellent thoroughbred horse is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship.

“So too, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What six? \[283\] Here, a bhikkhu patiently endures forms, patiently endures sounds, patiently endures odors, patiently endures tastes, patiently endures tactile objects, and patiently endures mental phenomena. Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.”
