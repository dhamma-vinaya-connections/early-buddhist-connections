# AN6.84 Nights

> **Division:** III. ARAHANTSHIP

“Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu possesses six qualities, whether night or day comes, only deterioration in wholesome qualities, not growth, can be expected for him. What six? Here, (1) a bhikkhu has strong desires, feels distress, and is discontent with any kind of robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick; he is (2) without faith, (3) immoral, (4) lazy, (5) muddle-minded, and (6) unwise. When a bhikkhu possesses these six qualities, whether night or day comes, only deterioration in wholesome qualities, not growth, is to be expected for him.

“Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu possesses six qualities, whether night or day comes, only growth in wholesome qualities, not deterioration, is to be expected for him. Here, (1) a bhikkhu does not have strong desires, does not feel distress, and is content with any kind of robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick; he is (2) endowed with faith, (3) virtuous, (4) energetic, (5) mindful, and (6) wise. When a bhikkhu possesses these six qualities, whether night or day comes, only growth in wholesome qualities, not deterioration, is to be expected for him.” \[435\]
