# AN6.61 Middle

> **Division:** I. THE GREAT CHAPTER

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Bārāṇasī in the deer park at Isipatana. Now on that occasion, after their meal, on returning from their alms round, a number of elder bhikkhus assembled and were sitting together in the pavilion hall when this conversation arose: “It was said, friends, by the Blessed One in the Pārāyana, in ‘The Questions of Metteyya’:

“‘Having understood both ends,

the wise one does not stick in the middle.

I call him a great man:

he has here transcended the seamstress.’

“What, friends, is the first end? What is the second end? What is in the middle? And what is the seamstress?”

(1) When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus: “Contact, friends, is one end; the arising of contact is the second \[400\] end; the cessation of contact is in the middle; and craving is the seamstress. For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence. It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly known; fully understands what should be fully understood; and by doing so, in this very life he makes an end of suffering.”

(2) When this was said, another bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus: “The past, friends, is one end; the future is the second end; the present is in the middle; and craving is the seamstress. For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence. It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly known … in this very life he makes an end of suffering.”

(3) When this was said, another bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus: “Pleasant feeling, friends, is one end; painful feeling is the second end; neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling is in the middle; and craving is the seamstress. For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence. It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly known … in this very life he makes an end of suffering.”

(4) When this was said, another bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus: “Name, friends, is one end; form is the second end; consciousness is in the middle; and craving is the seamstress. For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence. It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly known … in this very life he makes an end of suffering.”

(5) When this was said, another bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus: “The six internal bases, friends, are one end; the six external bases are the second end; consciousness is in the middle; and craving is the seamstress. For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence. It is in this way that a bhikkhu \[401\] directly knows what should be directly known … in this very life he makes an end of suffering.”

(6) When this was said, another bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus: “Personal existence, friends, is one end; the origin of personal existence is the second end; the cessation of personal existence is in the middle; and craving is the seamstress. For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence. It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly known; fully understands what should be fully understood; and by doing so, in this very life he makes an end of suffering.”

When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus: “Friends, we have each explained according to our own inspiration. Come, let’s go to the Blessed One and report this matter to him. As the Blessed One explains it to us, so should we retain it in mind.”

“Yes, friend,” those elder bhikkhus replied. Then the elder bhikkhus went to the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported to him the entire conversation that had taken place, \[asking:\] “Bhante, which of us has spoken well?”

\[The Blessed One said:\] “In a way, bhikkhus, you have all spoken well, but listen and attend closely as I tell you what I intended when I said in the Pārāyana, in ‘The Questions of Metteyya’:

“‘Having understood both ends,

the wise one does not stick in the middle.

I call him a great man:

he has here transcended the seamstress.’”

“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“Contact, bhikkhus, is one \[402\] end; the arising of contact is the second end; the cessation of contact is in the middle; and craving is the seamstress. For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence. It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly known; fully understands what should be fully understood; and by doing so, in this very life he makes an end of suffering.”
