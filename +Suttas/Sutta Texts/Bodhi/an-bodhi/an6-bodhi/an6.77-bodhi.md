# AN6.77 Superior

> **Division:** III. ARAHANTSHIP

“Bhikkhus, without having abandoned six things, one is incapable of realizing any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. What six? Muddle-mindedness, lack of clear comprehension, not guarding the doors of the sense faculties, lack of moderation in eating, duplicity, and flattery. Without having abandoned these six things, one is incapable of realizing any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.

“Bhikkhus, having abandoned six things, one is capable of realizing a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. What six? Muddle-mindedness … flattery. Having abandoned these six things, one is capable of realizing a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.” \[431\]
