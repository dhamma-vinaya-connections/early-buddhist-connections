# AN6.17 Wholesome

> **Division:** II. CORDIALITY

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the meeting hall, where he sat down in the seat that was prepared. In the evening, the Venerable Sāriputta, too, emerged from seclusion and went to the meeting hall, where \[299\] he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna … the Venerable Mahākassapa … the Venerable Mahākaccāyana … the Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita … the Venerable Mahācunda … the Venerable Mahākappina … the Venerable Anuruddha … the Venerable Revata … the Venerable Ānanda, too, emerged from seclusion and went to the meeting hall, where he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side.

Then, having passed most of the night sitting, the Blessed One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. Soon after the Blessed One had left, those venerable ones, too, got up from their seats and went to their own dwellings. But those bhikkhus who were newly ordained, who had not long gone forth and had just recently come to this Dhamma and discipline, slept, snoring away until sunrise. With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, the Blessed One saw those bhikkhus asleep, snoring away until sunrise. He then went to the meeting hall, sat down in the seat prepared for him, and addressed those bhikkhus:

“Bhikkhus, where is Sāriputta? Where is Mahāmoggallāna? Where is Mahākassapa? Where is Mahākaccāyana? Where is Mahākoṭṭhita? Where is Mahācunda? Where is Mahākappina? Where is Anuruddha? Where is Revata? Where is Ānanda? Where have those elder disciples gone?”

“Bhante, not long after the Blessed One left, those venerable ones, too, got up from their seats and went to their own dwellings.”

“Bhikkhus, when the elder bhikkhus left, why did you newly ordained ones sleep, snoring away until sunrise?

(1) “What do you think, bhikkhus? Have you ever seen or heard that a head-anointed khattiya king, while exercising rule all his life, is pleasing and agreeable to the country \[300\] if he spends as much time as he wants yielding to the pleasure of rest, the pleasure of sloth, the pleasure of sleep?”

“No, Bhante.”

“Good, bhikkhus. I too have never seen or heard of such a thing.

(2) “What do you think, bhikkhus? Have you ever seen or heard that a royal official … (3) … a favorite son … (4) … a general … (5) … a village headman … (6) … a guild master, while exercising leadership over the guild all his life, is pleasing and agreeable to the guild if he spends as much time as he wants yielding to the pleasure of rest, the pleasure of sloth, the pleasure of sleep?”

“No, Bhante.”

“Good, bhikkhus. I too have never seen or heard of such a thing.

“Bhikkhus, what do you think? Suppose there is an ascetic or brahmin who spends as much time as he wants yielding to the pleasure of rest, the pleasure of sloth, the pleasure of sleep; one who does not guard the doors of the sense faculties, who is immoderate in eating, and is not intent on wakefulness; who lacks insight into wholesome qualities; who does not dwell intent on the endeavor to develop the aids to enlightenment in the earlier and later phases of the night. Have you ever seen or heard that such a one, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it?”

“No, Bhante.”

“Good, bhikkhus. I too have never seen or \[301\] heard of such a thing.

“Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will guard the doors of the sense faculties, be moderate in eating, and be intent on wakefulness; we will have insight into wholesome qualities, and will dwell intent on the endeavor to develop the aids to enlightenment in the earlier and later phases of the night.’ Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves.”
