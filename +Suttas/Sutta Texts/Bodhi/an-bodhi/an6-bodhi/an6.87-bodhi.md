# AN6.87 A Murderer

> **Division:** IV. COOLNESS

“Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, even while listening to the good Dhamma one is incapable of entering upon the fixed course \[consisting in\] rightness in wholesome qualities. What six? (1) One has deprived one’s mother of life; (2) one has deprived one’s father of life; (3) one has deprived an arahant of life; (4) with a mind of hatred one has shed the Tathāgata’s blood; (5) one has created a schism in the Saṅgha; (6) one is unwise, stupid, obtuse. Possessing these six qualities, even while listening to the good Dhamma one is incapable of entering upon the fixed course \[consisting in\] rightness in wholesome qualities.
