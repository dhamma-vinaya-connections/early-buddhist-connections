# AN6.112 Gratification

> **Division:** I. TRIADS

“Bhikkhus, there are these three things. What three? (1) The view of gratification, (2) the view of self, and (3) wrong view. These are three things. Three \[other\] things are to be developed for abandoning these three things. What three? (4) The perception of impermanence is to be developed for abandoning the view of gratification. (5) The perception of non-self is to be developed for abandoning the view of self. (6) Right view is to be developed for abandoning wrong view. These three things are to be developed for abandoning the former three things.” \[448\]
