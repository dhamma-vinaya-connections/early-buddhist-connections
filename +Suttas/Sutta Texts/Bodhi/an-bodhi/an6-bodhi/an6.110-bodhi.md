# AN6.110 Perceptions

> **Division:** I. TRIADS

“Bhikkhus, there are these three things. What three? (1) Sensual perception, (2) perception of ill will, and (3) perception of harming. \[447\] These are three things. Three \[other\] things are to be developed for abandoning these three things. What three? (4) The perception of renunciation is to be developed for abandoning sensual perception. (5) The perception of good will is to be developed for abandoning the perception of ill will. (6) The perception of harmlessness is to be developed for abandoning the perception of harming. These three things are to be developed for abandoning the former three things.”
