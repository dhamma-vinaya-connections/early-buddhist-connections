# AN6.13 Escape

> **Division:** II. CORDIALITY

“Bhikkhus, there are these six elements of escape. What six?

(1) “Here, a bhikkhu might say thus: ‘I have developed and cultivated the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness, made it my vehicle and basis, carried it out, consolidated it, and properly undertaken it, yet ill will still obsesses my mind.’ He should be told: ‘Not so! Do not speak thus. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; for it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would certainly not speak in such a way. It is impossible and inconceivable, friend, that one might develop and cultivate the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness, make it one’s vehicle and basis, carry it out, consolidate it, and properly undertake it, yet \[291\] ill will could still obsess one’s mind. There is no such possibility. For this, friend, is the escape from ill will, namely, the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness.’

(2) “Then, a bhikkhu might say thus: ‘I have developed and cultivated the liberation of the mind by compassion, made it my vehicle and basis, carried it out, consolidated it, and properly undertaken it, yet the thought of harming still obsesses my mind.’ He should be told: ‘Not so! Do not speak thus. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; for it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would certainly not speak in such a way. It is impossible and inconceivable, friend, that one might develop and cultivate the liberation of the mind by compassion, make it one’s vehicle and basis, carry it out, consolidate it, and properly undertake it, yet the thought of harming could still obsess one’s mind. There is no such possibility. For this, friend, is the escape from the thought of harming, namely, the liberation of the mind by compassion.’

(3) “Then, a bhikkhu might say thus: ‘I have developed and cultivated the liberation of the mind by altruistic joy, made it my vehicle and basis, carried it out, consolidated it, and properly undertaken it, yet discontent still obsesses my mind.’ He should be told: ‘Not so! Do not speak thus. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; for it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would certainly not speak in such a way. It is impossible and inconceivable, friend, that one might develop and cultivate the liberation of the mind by altruistic joy, make it one’s vehicle and basis, carry it out, consolidate it, and properly undertake it, yet discontent could still obsess one’s mind. There is no such possibility. For this, friend, is the escape from discontent, namely, the liberation of the mind by altruistic joy.’

(4) “Then, a bhikkhu might say thus: ‘I have developed and cultivated the liberation of the mind by equanimity, made it my vehicle and basis, carried it out, consolidated it, and properly undertaken it, yet lust still obsesses my mind.’ He should be told: ‘Not so! Do not speak thus. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; for it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would certainly not speak in such a way. It is impossible and inconceivable, friend, that one might develop and cultivate the liberation of the mind by equanimity, make it one’s vehicle and basis, carry it out, consolidate it, and properly undertake it, \[292\] yet lust could still obsess one’s mind. There is no such possibility. For this, friend, is the escape from lust, namely, the liberation of the mind by equanimity.’

(5) “Then, a bhikkhu might say thus: ‘I have developed and cultivated the markless liberation of the mind, made it my vehicle and basis, carried it out, consolidated it, and properly undertaken it, yet my consciousness still follows after marks.’ He should be told: ‘Not so! Do not speak thus. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; for it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would certainly not speak in such a way. It is impossible and inconceivable, friend, that one might develop and cultivate the markless liberation of the mind, make it one’s vehicle and basis, carry it out, consolidate it, and properly undertake it, yet one’s consciousness could still follow after marks. There is no such possibility. For this, friend, is the escape from all marks, namely, the markless liberation of the mind.’

(6) “Then, a bhikkhu might say: ‘I have discarded \[the notion\] “I am,” and I do not regard \[anything as\] “This I am,” yet the dart of doubt and bewilderment still obsesses my mind.’ He should be told: ‘Not so! Do not speak thus. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; for it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would certainly not speak in such a way. It is impossible and inconceivable, friend, that when \[the notion\] “I am” has been discarded, and one does not regard \[anything as\] “This I am,” the dart of doubt and bewilderment could still obsess one’s mind. There is no such possibility. For this, friend, is the escape from the dart of doubt and bewilderment, namely, the uprooting of the conceit “I am.”’

“These, bhikkhus, are the six elements of escape.”
