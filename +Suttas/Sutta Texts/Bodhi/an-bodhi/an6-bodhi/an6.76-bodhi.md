# AN6.76 Arahantship

> **Division:** III. ARAHANTSHIP

“Bhikkhus, without having abandoned six things, one is incapable of realizing arahantship. What six? Conceit, an inferiority complex, arrogance, self-overestimation, obstinacy, and self-abasement. Without having abandoned these six things, one is incapable of realizing arahantship.

“Bhikkhus, having abandoned six things, one is capable of realizing arahantship. What six? Conceit … self-abasement. Having abandoned these six things, one is capable of realizing arahantship.”
