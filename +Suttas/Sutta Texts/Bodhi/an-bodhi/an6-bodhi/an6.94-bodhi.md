# AN6.94 Cases (3)

> **Division:** IV. COOLNESS

“Bhikkhus, there are these six cases of incapability. What six? One accomplished in view is (1) incapable of depriving his mother of life; (2) incapable of depriving his father of life; (3) incapable of depriving an arahant of life; (3) incapable of shedding the Tathāgata’s blood with a mind of hatred; (5) incapable of creating a schism in the Saṅgha; (6) incapable of acknowledging another teacher. These are the six cases of incapability.” \[440\]
