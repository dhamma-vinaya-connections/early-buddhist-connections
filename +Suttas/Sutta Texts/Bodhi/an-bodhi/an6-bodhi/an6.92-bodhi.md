# AN6.92 Cases (1)

> **Division:** IV. COOLNESS

“Bhikkhus, there are these six cases of incapability. What six? \[439\] One accomplished in view is (1) incapable of dwelling without reverence and deference toward the Teacher; (2) incapable of dwelling without reverence and deference toward the Dhamma; (3) incapable of dwelling without reverence and deference toward the Saṅgha; (4) incapable of dwelling without reverence and deference toward the training; (5) incapable of resorting to anything that should not be relied upon; (6) incapable of undergoing an eighth existence. These are the six cases of incapability.”
