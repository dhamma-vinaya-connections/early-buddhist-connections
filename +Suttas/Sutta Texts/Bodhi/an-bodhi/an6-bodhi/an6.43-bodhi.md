# AN6.43 The Nāga

> **Division:** V. DHAMMIKA

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Sāvatthī for alms. When he had walked for alms in Sāvatthī, after his meal, on returning from his alms round, he addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “Come, Ānanda, let us go to Migāramātā’s Mansion in the Eastern Park \[345\] to pass the day.”

“Yes, Bhante,” the Venerable Ānanda replied.

Then the Blessed One, together with the Venerable Ānanda, went to Migāramātā’s Mansion in the Eastern Park.

Then in the evening the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “Come, Ānanda, let us go to the eastern gate to bathe.”

“Yes, Bhante,” the Venerable Ānanda replied.

Then the Blessed One, together with the Venerable Ānanda, went to the eastern gate to bathe. Having bathed at the eastern gate and come out, he stood in one robe drying himself. On that occasion, King Pasenadi of Kosala’s bull elephant named “Seta” was coming out through the eastern gate to the accompaniment of instrumental music and drumming. People saw him and said: “The king’s bull elephant is handsome! The king’s bull elephant is beautiful! The king’s bull elephant is graceful! The king’s bull elephant is massive! He’s a nāga, truly a nāga.”

When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, is it only when people see an elephant possessed of a large massive body that they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ or do people also say this when they see \[other\] things possessed of a large massive body?”

“(1) Udāyī, when people see an elephant possessed of a large massive body, they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ (2) When people see a horse possessed of a large massive body, they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ (3) When people see a bull possessed of a large massive body, they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ (4) When people see a serpent possessed of a large massive body, they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ (5) When people see a tree \[346\] possessed of a large massive body, they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ (6) When people see a human being possessed of a large massive body, they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ But, Udāyī, in the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, I call one a nāga who does no evil by body, speech, and mind.”

“It’s astounding and amazing, Bhante, how well this was stated by the Blessed One: ‘But, Udāyī, in the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, I call one a nāga who does no evil by body, speech, and mind.’ I rejoice, Bhante, in this good statement of the Blessed One with these verses:

“A human being who is fully enlightened,

self-tamed and concentrated,

traveling on the path of brahmā,

he takes delight in peace of mind.

“I have heard from the Arahant

that even the devas pay homage to him,

to the same one whom humans venerate,

the one who has gone beyond everything.

“He has transcended all fetters

and emerged from the jungle to the clearing;

delighting in renunciation of sensual pleasures,

he is like pure gold freed from its ore.

“He is the nāga who outshines all,

like the Himalayas amid the other mountains.

Among all things named nāga,

he, unsurpassed, is the one truly named.

“I will extol for you the nāga:

indeed, he does no evil.

Mildness and harmlessness

are two feet of the nāga.

“Austerity and celibacy

are the nāga’s other two feet.

Faith is the great nāga’s trunk,

and equanimity his ivory tusks.

“Mindfulness is his neck, his head is wisdom,

investigation, and reflection on phenomena.

Dhamma is the balanced heat of his belly,

and seclusion is his tail.

“This meditator, delighting in consolation,

is inwardly well concentrated.

When walking, the nāga is concentrated;

when standing, the nāga is concentrated.

“When lying down, the nāga is concentrated;

when sitting, too, the nāga is concentrated. \[347\]

Everywhere, the nāga is restrained:

this is the nāga’s accomplishment.

“He eats blameless food,

but doesn’t eat what is blameworthy.

When he gains food and clothing,

he avoids storing it up.

“Having cut off all fetters and bonds,

whether they be gross or subtle,

in whatever direction he goes,

he goes without concern.

“The lotus flower

is born and grown up in water,

yet is not soiled by the water

but remains fragrant and delightful.

“Just so the Buddha, well born in the world,

dwells in the world,

yet is not soiled by the world like

the lotus \[unsoiled\] by water.

“A great fire all ablaze

settles down when deprived of fuel,

and when all the coals have gone out,

it is said to be extinguished.

“This simile, which conveys the meaning,

was taught by the wise.

Great nāgas will know the nāga

that was taught by the nāga.

“Devoid of lust, devoid of hatred,

devoid of delusion, without taints,

the nāga, discarding his body,

taintless, is utterly quenched

and attains final nibbāna.”
