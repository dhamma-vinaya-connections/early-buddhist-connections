# AN6.48 Directly Visible (2)

> **Division:** V. DHAMMIKA

Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

“Master Gotama, it is said: ‘The directly visible Dhamma, the directly visible Dhamma.’ In what way, Master Gotama, \[358\] is the Dhamma directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise?”

“Well then, brahmin, I will question you in turn about this. Answer as you see fit. What do you think, brahmin? (1) When there is lust within you, do you know: ‘There is lust within me,’ and when there is no lust within you, do you know: ‘There is no lust within me’?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Since, brahmin, when there is lust within you, you know: ‘There is lust within me,’ and when there is no lust within you, you know: ‘There is no lust within me,’ in this way the Dhamma is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.

“What do you think, brahmin? (2) When there is hatred within you … (3) … delusion within you … (4) … a bodily fault within you … (5) … a verbal fault within you … (6) … a mental fault within you, do you know: ‘There is a mental fault within me,’ and when there is no mental fault within you, do you know: ‘There is no mental fault within me’?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Since, brahmin, when there is a mental fault within you, you know: ‘There is a mental fault within me,’ and when there is no mental fault within you, you know: ‘There is no mental fault within me,’ in this way the Dhamma is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.”

“Excellent, Master Gotama! … \[as in 6:38\] … Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”
