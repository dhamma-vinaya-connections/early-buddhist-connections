# AN6.82 Hell (2)

> **Division:** III. ARAHANTSHIP

“Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, one is deposited in hell as if brought there. What six? One destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, and speaks falsely; one is greedy and impudent. Possessing these six qualities, one is deposited in hell as if brought there.

“Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, one is deposited in heaven as if brought there. What six? One abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech; one is without greed and without impudence. Possessing these six qualities, one is deposited in heaven as if brought there.”
