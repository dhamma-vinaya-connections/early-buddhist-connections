# AN6.106 Craving

> **Division:** V. BENEFIT

“Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of craving, and these three kinds of conceit, that are to be abandoned. What are the three kinds of craving that are to be abandoned? (1) Sensual craving, (2) craving for existence, and (3) craving for extermination: these are the three kinds of craving that are to be abandoned. And what are the three kinds of conceit that are to be abandoned? (4) Conceit, (5) the inferiority complex, and (6) arrogance: these are the three kinds of conceit that are to be abandoned.

“When a bhikkhu has abandoned these three kinds of craving and these three kinds of conceit, he is called a bhikkhu who has cut off craving, stripped off the fetter, and by completely breaking through conceit, has made an end of suffering.”
