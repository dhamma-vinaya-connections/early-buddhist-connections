# AN6.102 Unlasting

> **Division:** V. BENEFIT

“Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu considers six benefits, it is enough for him to establish the unlimited perception of impermanence in all conditioned phenomena. What six? (1) ‘All conditioned phenomena will appear to me as unlasting. (2) My mind will not delight in anything in the world. (3) My mind will rise up from the entire world. (4) My mind will slope toward nibbāna. (5) My fetters will be abandoned. And (6) I will come to possess supreme asceticism.’

“Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu considers these six benefits, it is enough for him to establish the unlimited perception of impermanence in all conditioned phenomena.”
