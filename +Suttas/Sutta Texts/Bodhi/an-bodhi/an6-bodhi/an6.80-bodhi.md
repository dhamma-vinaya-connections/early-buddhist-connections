# AN6.80 Greatness

> **Division:** III. ARAHANTSHIP

“Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu in no long time attains to greatness and vastness in \[wholesome\] qualities. What six? Here, a bhikkhu abounds in light, abounds in effort, abounds in inspiration; he does not become complacent; he does not neglect his duty in regard to wholesome qualities; and he extends himself further. Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu in no long time attains to greatness and vastness in \[wholesome\] qualities.”
