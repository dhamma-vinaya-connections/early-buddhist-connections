# AN6.52 Khattiya

> **Division:** V. DHAMMIKA

Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇī approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: \[363\]

(1) “Master Gotama, what is the aim of khattiyas? What is their quest? What is their support? What are they intent on? What is their final goal?”

“Wealth, brahmin, is the aim of khattiyas; their quest is for wisdom; their support is power; they are intent on territory; and their final goal is sovereignty.”

(2) “But, Master Gotama, what is the aim of brahmins? What is their quest? What is their support? What are they intent on? What is their final goal?”

“Wealth, brahmin, is the aim of brahmins; their quest is for wisdom; the Vedic hymns are their support; they are intent on sacrifice; and their final goal is the brahmā world.”

(3) “But, Master Gotama, what is the aim of householders? What is their quest? What is their support? What are they intent on? What is their final goal?”

“Wealth, brahmin, is the aim of householders; their quest is for wisdom; their craft is their support; they are intent on work; and their final goal is to complete their work.”

(4) “But, Master Gotama, what is the aim of women? What is their quest? What is their support? What are they intent on? What is their final goal?”

“A man, brahmin, is the aim of women; their quest is for adornments; sons are their support; they are intent on being without a rival; and their final goal is authority.”

(5) “But, Master Gotama, what is the aim of thieves? What is their quest? What is their support? What are they intent on? What is their final goal?”

“Robbery, brahmin, is the aim of thieves; their quest is for thickets; craftiness is their support; they are intent on dark places; and their final goal is to remain unseen.”

(6) “But, Master Gotama, what is the aim of ascetics? What is their quest? What is their support? What are they intent on? What is their final goal?”

“Patience and mildness, brahmin, is the aim of ascetics; their quest is for wisdom; virtuous behavior is their support; they are intent on nothingness; and their final goal is nibbāna.”

“It’s astounding and amazing, Master Gotama! Master Gotama knows the aim, quest, support, intent, and final goal of khattiyas, brahmins, householders, women, thieves, \[364\] and ascetics.

“Excellent, Master Gotama! … \[as in 6:38\] … Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”
