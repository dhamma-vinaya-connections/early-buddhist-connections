# AN6.64 Lion’s Roar

> **Division:** I. THE GREAT CHAPTER

“Bhikkhus, there are these six Tathāgata’s powers that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel. What six?

(1) “Here, bhikkhus, the Tathāgata understands as it really is the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible. Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible, this is a Tathāgata’s power that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(2) “Again, the Tathāgata understands as it really is the result of the undertaking of kamma past, future, and present in terms of possibilities and causes. Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is the result of the undertaking of kamma … this too is a Tathāgata’s power that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he … sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(3) “Again, the Tathāgata \[418\] understands as it really is the defilement, the cleansing, and the emergence in regard to the jhānas, emancipations, concentrations, and meditative attainments. Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is the defilement, the cleansing, and the emergence in regard to the jhānas … this too is a Tathāgata’s power that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he … sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(4) “Again, the Tathāgata recollects his manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births … \[as in 6:2 §4\] … Thus he recollects his manifold past abodes with their aspects and details. Since the Tathāgata recollects his manifold past abodes … with their aspects and details, this too is a Tathāgata’s power that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he … sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(5) “Again, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, the Tathāgata sees beings passing away and being reborn … \[as in 6:2 §5\] … and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma. Since the Tathāgata … understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma, this too is a Tathāgata’s power that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he … sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(6) “Again, with the destruction of the taints, the Tathāgata has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. Since the Tathāgata has realized for himself … the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom … this too is a Tathāgata’s power that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he … sets in motion the brahma wheel. \[419\]

“These are the six Tathāgata’s powers that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(1) “If, bhikkhus, others approach the Tathāgata and ask him a question related to his knowledge as it really is of the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible, then the Tathāgata, questioned in this way, answers them exactly as he has understood this knowledge.

(2) “If others approach the Tathāgata and ask him a question related to his knowledge as it really is of the result of the undertaking of kamma past, future, and present in terms of possibilities and causes, then the Tathāgata, questioned in this way, answers them exactly as he has understood this knowledge.

(3) “If others approach the Tathāgata and ask him a question related to his knowledge as it really is of the defilement, the cleansing, and the emergence in regard to the jhānas, emancipations, concentrations, and meditative attainments, then the Tathāgata, questioned in this way, answers them exactly as he has understood this knowledge.

(4) “If others approach the Tathāgata and ask him a question related to his knowledge as it really is of the recollection of past abodes, then \[420\] the Tathāgata, questioned in this way, answers them exactly as he has understood this knowledge.

(5) “If others approach the Tathāgata and ask him a question related to his knowledge as it really is of the passing away and rebirth of beings, then the Tathāgata, questioned in this way, answers them exactly as he has understood this knowledge.

(6) “If others approach the Tathāgata and ask him a question related to his knowledge as it really is of the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, then the Tathāgata, questioned in this way, answers them exactly as he has understood this knowledge.

(1) “I say, bhikkhus, that the knowledge as it really is of the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible is for one who is concentrated, not for one who lacks concentration.

(2) “I say that the knowledge as it really is of the result of the undertaking of kammas past, future, and present in terms of possibilities and causes is for one who is concentrated, not for one who lacks concentration.

(3) “I say that the knowledge as it really is of the defilement, the cleansing, and the emergence in regard to the jhānas, emancipations, concentrations, and meditative attainments is for one who is concentrated, not for one who lacks concentration.

(4) “I say that the knowledge as it really is of the recollection of past abodes is for one who is concentrated, not for one who lacks concentration.

(5) “I say that the knowledge as it really is of the passing away and rebirth of beings is for one who is concentrated, not for one who lacks concentration.

(6) “I say that the knowledge as it really is of the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, is for one who is concentrated, not for one who lacks concentration.

“Thus, bhikkhus, concentration is the path; lack of concentration is the wrong path.” \[421\]
