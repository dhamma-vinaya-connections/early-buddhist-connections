# AN6.39 Origination

> **Division:** IV. DEITIES

“Bhikkhus, there are these three causes for the origination of kamma. What three? (1) Greed is a cause for the origination of kamma; (2) hatred is a cause for the origination of kamma; and (3) delusion is a cause for the origination of kamma. “It is not non-greed that originates from greed; rather, it

is just greed that originates from greed. It is not non-hatred that originates from hatred; rather, it is just hatred that originates from hatred. It is not non-delusion that originates from delusion; rather, it is just delusion that originates from delusion.

“It is not \[339\] \[the realms\] of devas and humans—or any other good destinations—that are seen because of kamma born of greed, hatred, and delusion; rather, it is hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits—as well as other bad destinations—that are seen because of kamma born of greed, hatred, and delusion. These are three causes for the origination of kamma.

“There are, bhikkhus, these three \[other\] causes for the origination of kamma. What three? (4) Non-greed is a cause for the origination of kamma; (5) non-hatred is a cause for the origination of kamma; and (6) non-delusion is a cause for the origination of kamma.

“It is not greed that originates from non-greed; rather, it is just non-greed that originates from non-greed. It is not hatred that originates from non-hatred; rather, it is just non-hatred that originates from non-hatred. It is not delusion that originates from non-delusion; rather, it is just non-delusion that originates from non-delusion.

“It is not hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits—or any other bad destinations—that are seen because of kamma born of non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion; rather, it is \[the realms\] of devas and humans—as well as other good destinations—that are seen because of kamma born of non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion. These are three \[other\] causes for the origination of kamma.”
