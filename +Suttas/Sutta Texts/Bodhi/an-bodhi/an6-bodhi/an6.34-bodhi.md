# AN6.34 Moggallāna

> **Division:** IV. DEITIES

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, while the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was alone in seclusion, the following course of thought arose in him: “Which devas know: ‘I am a stream-enterer, no longer subject to \[rebirth in\] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment’?” \[332\]

Now at that time, a bhikkhu named Tissa had recently died and been reborn in a certain brahmā world. There too they knew him as “the brahmā Tissa, powerful and mighty.” Then, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna disappeared from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that brahmā world. When he saw the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna coming in the distance, the brahmā Tissa said to him:

“Come, respected Moggallāna! Welcome, respected Moggallāna! It has been long since you took the opportunity to come here. Sit down, respected Moggallāna. This seat has been prepared.” The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna sat down on the prepared seat. The brahmā Tissa paid homage to him and sat down to one side. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna then said to him:

“Which devas, Tissa, know: ‘I am a stream-enterer, no longer subject to \[rebirth in\] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment’?”

(1) “The devas \[ruled by\] the four great kings have such knowledge, respected Moggallāna.”

“Do all the devas \[ruled by\] the four great kings have such knowledge, Tissa?”

“Not all, respected Moggallāna. Those who do not possess unwavering confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and who lack the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones, do not have such \[333\] knowledge. But those who possess unwavering confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and who have the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones, know: ‘I am a stream-enterer, no longer subject to \[rebirth in\] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment.’”

(2) “Do only the devas \[ruled by\] the four great kings have such knowledge, or do the Tāvatiṃsa devas … (3) … the Yāma devas … (4) … the Tusita devas … (5) … the devas who delight in creation … (6) … the devas who control what is created by others have it?”

“The devas who control what is created by others also have such knowledge, respected Moggallāna.”

“Do all the devas who control what is created by others have such knowledge, Tissa?”

“Not all, respected Moggallāna. Those who do not possess unwavering confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and who lack the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones, do not have such knowledge. But those who possess unwavering confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and who have the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones, know: ‘I am a stream-enterer, no longer subject to \[rebirth in\] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment.’”

Then, having delighted and rejoiced in the statement of the brahmā Tissa, just as \[334\] a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna disappeared from the brahmā world and reappeared in Jeta’s Grove.
