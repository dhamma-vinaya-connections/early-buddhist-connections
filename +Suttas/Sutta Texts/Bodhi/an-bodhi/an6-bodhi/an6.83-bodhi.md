“Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities a bhikkhu is incapable of realizing arahantship, the foremost state. What six? Here, a bhikkhu is without faith, morally shameless, morally reckless, lazy, unwise, and concerned about his body and life. Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu is incapable of realizing arahantship, the foremost state.
