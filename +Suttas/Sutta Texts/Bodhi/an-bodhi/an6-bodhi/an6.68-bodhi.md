(2) It is impossible that one who does not find delight in solitude when he is alone \[423\] will acquire the object of the mind. (3) It is impossible that one who does not acquire the object of the mind will fulfill right view. (4) It is impossible that one who does not fulfill right view will fulfill right concentration.
