# AN6.89 Without Having Abandoned

> **Division:** IV. COOLNESS

“Bhikkhus, without having abandoned six things, one is incapable of realizing accomplishment in view. What six? Personal-existence view, doubt, wrong grasp of behavior and observances, lust leading to the plane of misery, hatred leading to the plane of misery, and delusion leading to the plane of misery. Without having abandoned these six things, one is incapable of realizing accomplishment in view.

“Bhikkhus, having abandoned six things, one is capable of realizing accomplishment in view. What six? Personal-existence view … delusion leading to the plane of misery. Having abandoned these six things, one is capable of realizing accomplishment in view.”
