# AN6.15 Regret

> **Division:** II. CORDIALITY

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus….

“Friends, a bhikkhu passes his time in such a way that he dies with regret. And how does a bhikkhu pass his time in such a way that he dies with regret?

“Here, (1) a bhikkhu delights in work, takes delight in work, is devoted to delight in work … \[as in 6:14\] … (6) he delights in proliferation, takes delight in proliferation, is devoted to delight in proliferation. When a bhikkhu passes his time in such a way he dies with regret. This is called a bhikkhu who delights in personal existence, who has not abandoned personal existence to completely make an end of suffering.

“Friends, a bhikkhu passes his time in such a way that he dies without regret. And how does a bhikkhu pass his time in such a way that he dies without regret?

“Here, (1) a bhikkhu does not delight in work, does not take delight in work, is not devoted to delight in work … \[295\] … (6) does not delight in proliferation, does not take delight in proliferation, is not devoted to delight in proliferation. When a bhikkhu passes his time in such a way he dies without regret. This is called a bhikkhu who delights in nibbāna, who has abandoned personal existence to completely make an end of suffering.”

\[The verses are identical with those of 6:14.\]
