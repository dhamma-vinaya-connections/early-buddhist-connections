# AN6.24 Himalayas

> **Division:** III. THE UNSURPASSED THINGS

“Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu might split the Himalayas, the king of mountains, how much more then vile ignorance! What six? Here, a bhikkhu is (1) skilled in the attainment of concentration; (2) skilled in the duration of concentration; (3) skilled in emergence from concentration; (4) skilled in fitness for concentration; (5) skilled in the area of concentration; and (6) skilled in resolution regarding concentration. \[312\] Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu might split the Himalayas, the king of mountains, how much more then vile ignorance!”
