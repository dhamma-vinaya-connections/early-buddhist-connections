# AN6.79 Achievement

> **Division:** III. ARAHANTSHIP

“Possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu is incapable of achieving a wholesome quality that he has not yet achieved or of strengthening a wholesome quality that has already been achieved. What six? (1) Here, a bhikkhu is not skilled in gain, (2) not skilled in loss, (3) not skilled in means; (4) he does not generate desire for the achievement of wholesome qualities not yet achieved; (5) he does not guard wholesome qualities already achieved; (6) he does not fulfill his tasks through persistent effort. Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu is incapable of achieving a wholesome quality that he has not yet achieved or of strengthening a wholesome quality that has already been achieved.
