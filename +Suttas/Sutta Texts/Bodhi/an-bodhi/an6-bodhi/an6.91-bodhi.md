# AN6.91 Incapable

> **Division:** IV. COOLNESS

“Bhikkhus, one accomplished in view is incapable of giving rise to these six things. What six? Personal-existence view, doubt, wrong grasp of behavior and observances, lust leading to the plane of misery, hatred leading to the plane of misery, and delusion leading to the plane of misery. One accomplished in view is incapable of giving rise to these six things.”
