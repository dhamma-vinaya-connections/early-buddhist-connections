# AN6.57 Six Classes

> **Division:** I. THE GREAT CHAPTER

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

“Bhante, Pūraṇa Kassapa has described six classes: a black class, a blue class, a red class, a yellow class, a white class, and a supreme white class.

“He has described the black class as butchers of sheep, pigs, poultry, and deer; hunters and fishermen; thieves, executioners, and prison wardens; or those who follow any other such cruel occupation.

“He has described the blue class as bhikkhus who live on thorns or any others who profess the doctrine of kamma, the doctrine of the efficacy of deeds.

“He has described the red class as the Nigaṇṭhas \[384\] wearing a single garment.

“He has described the yellow class as the white-robed lay disciples of the naked ascetics.

“He has described the white class as the male and female Ājīvakas.

“He has described the supreme white class as Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkicca, and Makkhali Gosāla.

“Pūraṇa Kassapa, Bhante, has described these six classes.”

“But, Ānanda, has the whole world authorized Pūraṇa Kassapa to describe these six classes?”

“Certainly not, Bhante.”

“Suppose, Ānanda, there was a poor, destitute, indigent person. They might force a cut \[of meat\] on him against his will, saying: ‘Good man, you must eat this piece of meat and pay for it.’ In the same way, without the consent of those ascetics and brahmins, Pūraṇa Kassapa has described these six classes in a foolish, incompetent, inexpert, and unskilled way. But I, Ānanda, describe six \[different\] classes. Listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante,” the Venerable Ānanda replied. The Blessed One said this:

“And what, Ānanda, are the six classes? (1) Here, someone of the black class produces a black state. (2) Someone of the black class produces a white state. (3) Someone of the black class produces nibbāna, which is neither black nor white. (4) Then, someone \[385\] of the white class produces a black state. (5) Someone of the white class produces a white state. (6) And someone of the white class produces nibbāna, which is neither black nor white.

(1) “And how is it, Ānanda, that someone of the black class produces a black state? Here, someone has been reborn in a low family—a family of caṇḍāla_s_, hunters, bamboo workers, cart makers, or flower scavengers—one that is poor, with little food and drink, that subsists with difficulty, where food and clothing are obtained with difficulty; and he is ugly, unsightly, dwarfish, with much illness—blind, crippled, lame, or paralyzed. He does not obtain food, drink, clothing, and vehicles; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, housing, and lighting. He engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. In consequence, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. It is in such a way that someone of the black class produces a black state.

(2) “And how is it, Ānanda, that someone of the black class produces a white state? Here, someone has been reborn in a low family…. He does not obtain food … and lighting. He engages in good conduct by body, speech, and mind. In consequence, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. It is in such a way that someone of the black class produces a white state.

(3) “And how is it, Ānanda, that someone of the black class produces nibbāna, which is neither black nor white? Here, someone has been reborn in a low family…. \[386\] … He does not obtain food … and lighting. Having shaved off his hair and beard, he puts on ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. When he has thus gone forth, he abandons the five hindrances, defilements of the mind, things that weaken wisdom; and then, with his mind well established in the four establishments of mindfulness, he correctly develops the seven factors of enlightenment and produces nibbāna, which is neither black nor white. It is in such a way that someone of the black class produces nibbāna, which is neither black nor white.

(4) “And how is it, Ānanda, that someone of the white class produces a black state? Here, someone has been reborn in a high family—an affluent khattiya family, an affluent brahmin family, or an affluent householder family—one that is rich, with great wealth and property, abundant gold and silver, abundant treasures and commodities, abundant wealth and grain; and he is handsome, attractive, graceful, possessing supreme beauty of complexion. He obtains food, drink, clothing, and vehicles; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, housing, and lighting. He engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. In consequence, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. It is in such a way that someone of the white class produces a black state.

(5) “And how is it, Ānanda, that someone of the white class produces a white state? Here, someone has been reborn in a high family…. He obtains food … and lighting. He engages in good conduct by body, speech, and mind. In consequence, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. It is in such a way that someone of the white class produces a white state.

(6) “And how is it, Ānanda, that someone of the white class produces nibbāna, which is neither black nor white? \[387\] Here, someone has been reborn in a high family…. He obtains food … and lighting. Having shaved off his hair and beard, he puts on ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. When he has thus gone forth, he abandons the five hindrances, defilements of the mind, things that weaken wisdom; and then, with his mind well established in the four establishments of mindfulness, he correctly develops the seven factors of enlightenment and produces nibbāna, which is neither black nor white. It is in such a way that someone of the white class produces nibbāna, which is neither black nor white.

“These, Ānanda, are the six classes.”
