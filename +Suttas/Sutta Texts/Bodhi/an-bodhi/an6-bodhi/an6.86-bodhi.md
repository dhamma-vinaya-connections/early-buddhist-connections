# AN6.86 Obstructions

> **Division:** IV. COOLNESS

“Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, even while listening to the good Dhamma one is incapable of entering upon the fixed course \[consisting in\] rightness in wholesome qualities. What six? \[436\] One is obstructed by kamma; one is obstructed by defilement; one is obstructed by the result \[of kamma\]; one is without faith; one is without desire; and one is unwise. Possessing these six qualities, even while listening to the good Dhamma one is incapable of entering upon the fixed course \[consisting in\] rightness in wholesome qualities.
