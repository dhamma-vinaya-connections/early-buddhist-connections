# AN6.40 Kimbila

> **Division:** IV. DEITIES

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kimbilā in a _nicula_ grove. Then the Venerable Kimbila approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: \[340\]

“What is the cause and reason why, Bhante, the good Dhamma does not continue long after a Tathāgata has attained final nibbāna?”

“Here, Kimbila, after a Tathāgata has attained final nibbāna, (1) the bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male lay followers, and female lay followers dwell without reverence and deference toward the Teacher. (2) They dwell without reverence and deference toward the Dhamma. (3) They dwell without reverence and deference toward the Saṅgha. (4) They dwell without reverence and deference toward the training. (5) They dwell without reverence and deference toward heedfulness. (6) They dwell without reverence and deference toward hospitality. This is the cause and reason why the good Dhamma does not continue long after a Tathāgata has attained final nibbāna.”
