# AN6.33 Non-Decline (2)

> **Division:** IV. DEITIES

“Last night, bhikkhus, when the night had advanced, a certain deity of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said to me: ‘Bhante, there are these six qualities that lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu. What six? Reverence for the Teacher, reverence for the Dhamma, reverence for the Saṅgha, reverence for the training, reverence for a sense of moral shame, and reverence for moral dread. These six qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu.’ This is what that deity said. Then the deity paid homage to me, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there.”

Respectful toward the Teacher,

respectful toward the Dhamma,

deeply revering the Saṅgha,

endowed with moral shame and moral dread:

one who is deferential and reverential

cannot fall away, but is close to nibbāna.
