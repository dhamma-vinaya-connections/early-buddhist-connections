# AN6.93 Cases (2)

> **Division:** IV. COOLNESS

“Bhikkhus, there are these six cases of incapability. What six? One accomplished in view is (1) incapable of considering any conditioned phenomenon as permanent; (2) incapable of considering any conditioned phenomenon as pleasurable; (3) incapable of considering any phenomenon as a self; (4) incapable of doing a grave act that brings immediate result; (5) incapable of resorting to \[the belief\] that purity comes about through superstitious and auspicious acts; (6) incapable of seeking a person worthy of offerings outside here. These are the six cases of incapability.”
