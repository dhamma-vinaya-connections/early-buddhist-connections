# AN6.38 Self-Initiative

> **Division:** IV. DEITIES

Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had exchanged greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

“Master Gotama, I hold such a thesis and view as this: ‘There is no self-initiative; there is no initiative taken by others.’”

“Brahmin, I have never seen or heard of anyone holding such a thesis and view as this. For how \[338\] can one who comes on his own and returns on his own say: ‘There is no self-initiative; there is no initiative taken by others’?

(1) “What do you think, brahmin? Does the element of instigation exist?”

“Yes, sir.”

“When the element of instigation exists, are beings seen to instigate activity?”

“Yes, sir.”

“When beings are seen to instigate activity because the element of instigation exists, this is the self-initiative of beings; this is the initiative taken by others.

(2) “What do you think, brahmin? Does the element of persistence exist?”

“Yes, sir.”

“When the element of persistence exists, are beings seen to persist in activity?”

“Yes, sir.”

“When beings are seen to persist in activity because the element of persistence exists, this is the self-initiative of beings; this is the initiative taken by others.

(3) “What do you think, brahmin? Does the element of exertion exist?”

“Yes, sir.”

“When the element of exertion exists, are beings seen to exert themselves in activity?”

“Yes, sir.”

“When beings are seen to exert themselves in activity because the element of exertion exists, this is the self-initiative of beings; this is the initiative taken by others.

(4) “What do you think, brahmin? Does the element of strength exist?”

“Yes, sir.”

“When the element of strength exists, are beings seen to be possessed of strength?”

“Yes, sir.”

“When beings are seen to be possessed of strength because the element of strength exists, this is the self-initiative of beings; this is the initiative taken by others.

(5) “What do you think, brahmin? Does the element of continuation exist?”

“Yes, sir.”

“When the element of continuation exists, are beings seen to continue \[in an action\]?”

“Yes, sir.”

“When beings are seen to continue \[in an action\] because the element of continuation exists, this is the self-initiative of beings; this is the initiative taken by others.

(6) “What do you think, brahmin? Does the element of force exist?”

“Yes, sir.”

“When the element of force exists, are beings seen to act with force?”

“Yes, sir.”

“When beings are seen to act with force because the element of force exists, this is the self-initiative of beings; this is the initiative taken by others.

“Brahmin, I have never seen or heard of anyone holding such a thesis and view \[as yours\]. For how can one who comes on his own and returns on his own say: ‘There is no self-initiative; there is no initiative on the part of others’?”

“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms. I now go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”
