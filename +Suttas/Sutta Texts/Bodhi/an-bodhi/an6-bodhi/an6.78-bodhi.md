# AN6.78 Happiness

> **Division:** III. ARAHANTSHIP

“Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu abounds in happiness and joy in this very life, and he has laid the foundation for the destruction of the taints. What six? Here, a bhikkhu delights in the Dhamma, delights in \[mental\] development, delights in abandoning, delights in solitude, delights in non-affliction, and delights in non-proliferation. Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu abounds in happiness and joy in this very life, and he has laid the foundation for the destruction of the taints.”
