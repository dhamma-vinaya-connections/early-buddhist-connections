# AN6.85 Coolness

> **Division:** IV. COOLNESS

“Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu is incapable of realizing the unsurpassed coolness. What six? (1) Here, a bhikkhu does not suppress the mind on an occasion when it should be suppressed; (2) he does not exert the mind on an occasion when it should be exerted; (3) he does not encourage the mind on an occasion when it should be encouraged; and (4) he does not look at the mind with equanimity on an occasion when one should look at it with equanimity. (5) He is of inferior disposition and (6) he takes delight in personal existence. Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu is incapable of realizing the unsurpassed coolness.
