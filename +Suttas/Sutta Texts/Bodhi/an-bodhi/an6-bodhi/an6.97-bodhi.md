# AN6.97 Benefits

> **Division:** V. BENEFIT

“Bhikkhus, there are these six benefits in realizing the fruit of stream-entry. What six? (1) One is fixed in the good Dhamma; (2) one is incapable of decline; (3) one’s suffering is delimited; (4) one comes to possess knowledge not shared by others; (5) one has clearly seen causation; (6) one has clearly seen causally arisen phenomena. These are the six benefits in realizing the fruit of stream-entry.”
