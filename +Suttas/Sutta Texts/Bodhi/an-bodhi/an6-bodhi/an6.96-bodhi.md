# AN6.96 Manifestation

> **Division:** V. BENEFIT

“Bhikkhus, the manifestation of six things is rare in the world. What six? (1) The manifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One is rare in the world. (2) One who can teach the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by a Tathāgata is rare in the world. (3) Rebirth in the sphere of the noble ones is rare in the world. (4) Endowment with unimpaired \[sense\] faculties is rare in the world. (5) Being intelligent and astute is rare in the world. (6) The desire for the wholesome Dhamma is rare in the world. The manifestation of these six things is rare in the world.”
