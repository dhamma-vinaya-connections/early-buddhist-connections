# AN6.71 Capable of Realizing

> **Division:** II. NON-RETURNER

“Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu is incapable of realizing a particular state, \[though\] there is a suitable basis. What six? \[427\] (1) Here, a bhikkhu does not understand as it really is: ‘These are qualities that pertain to deterioration,’ and: (2) ‘These are qualities that pertain to stabilization,’ and: (3) ‘These are qualities that pertain to distinction,’ and: (4) ‘These are qualities that pertain to penetration.’ (5) He does not practice carefully, and (6) he does not do what is suitable. Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu is incapable of realizing a particular state, \[though\] there is a suitable basis.
