# AN6.44 Migasālā

> **Division:** V. DHAMMIKA

Then, in the morning, the Venerable Ānanda dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the house of the female lay follower Migasālā, where he sat down on the seat prepared for him. Then the female lay disciple Migasālā approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

“Bhante Ānanda, just how should this teaching of the Blessed One be understood, where one who is celibate and one who is not celibate both have exactly the same destination in their future life? \[348\] My father Purāṇa was celibate, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person’s practice. When he died, the Blessed One declared: ‘He attained to the state of a once-returner and has been reborn in the Tusita group \[of devas\].’ My paternal uncle Isidatta was not celibate but lived a contented married life. When he died, the Blessed One also declared: ‘He attained to the state of a once-returner and has been reborn in the Tusita group \[of devas\].’ Bhante Ānanda, just how should this teaching of the Blessed One be understood, where one who is celibate and one who is not celibate both have exactly the same destination in their future life?”

“It was just in this way, sister, that the Blessed One declared it.”

Then, when the Venerable Ānanda had received almsfood at Migasālā’s house, he rose from his seat and departed. After his meal, on returning from his alms round, he went to the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: “Here, Bhante, in the morning, I dressed, took my bowl and robe, and went to the house of the female lay follower Migasālā … \[349\] \[all as above, down to\] … When she asked me this, I replied: ‘It was just in this way, sister, that the Blessed One declared it.’”

\[The Blessed One said:\] “Who, indeed, is the female lay follower Migasālā, a foolish, incompetent woman with a woman’s intellect? And who are those \[who have\] the knowledge of other persons as superior and inferior?

“There are, Ānanda, these six types of persons found existing in the world. What six?

(1) “Here, Ānanda, there is one person who is mild, a pleasant companion, with whom his fellow monks gladly dwell. But he has not listened \[to the teachings\], become learned \[in them\], and penetrated \[them\] by view, and he does not attain temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for deterioration, not for distinction; he is one going to deterioration, not to distinction.

(2) “Then, Ānanda, there is one person who is mild, a pleasant companion, with whom his fellow monks gladly dwell. And he has listened \[to the teachings\], become learned \[in them\], and penetrated \[them\] by view, and he attains temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for distinction, not for deterioration; he is one going to distinction, not to deterioration.

“Ānanda, those who are judgmental will pass such judgment on them: ‘This one has the same qualities as the other. Why should one be inferior and the other superior?’ That \[judgment\] of theirs will indeed lead to their harm and suffering for a long time.

“Between them, Ānanda, the person who is mild, a pleasant companion, one with whom his fellow monks gladly dwell, who has listened \[to the teachings\], become learned \[in them\], and penetrated \[them\] by view, and who attains temporary liberation, \[350\] surpasses and excels the other person. For what reason? Because the Dhamma-stream carries him along. But who can know this difference except the Tathāgata?

“Therefore, Ānanda, do not be judgmental regarding people. Do not pass judgment on people. Those who pass judgment on people harm themselves. I alone, or one like me, may pass judgment on people.

(3) “Then, Ānanda, in one person anger and conceit are found, and from time to time states of greed arise in him. And he has not listened \[to the teachings\], become learned \[in them\], and penetrated \[them\] by view, and he does not attain temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for deterioration, not for distinction; he is one going to deterioration, not to distinction.

But he has listened \[to the teachings\], become learned \[in them\], and penetrated \[them\] by view, and he attains temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for distinction, not for deterioration; he is one going to distinction, not to deterioration.

“Ānanda, those who are judgmental will pass such judgment on them…. I alone, or one like me, may pass judgment on people.

(5) “Then, Ānanda, in one person anger and conceit are found, and from time to time he engages in exchanges of words. And he has not listened \[to the teachings\], become learned \[in them\], and penetrated \[them\] by view, and he does not attain temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for deterioration, not for distinction; he is one going to deterioration, not to distinction.

But he has listened \[to the teachings\], become learned \[in them\], and penetrated \[them\] by view, and he attains temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, \[351\] he heads for distinction, not for deterioration; he is one going to distinction, not to deterioration.

“Ānanda, those who are judgmental will pass such judgment on them: ‘This one has the same qualities as the other. Why should one be inferior and the other superior?’ That \[judgment\] of theirs will indeed lead to their harm and suffering for a long time.

“Between them, Ānanda, the person in whom anger and conceit are found, and who from time to time engages in exchanges of words, but who has listened \[to the teachings\], become learned \[in them\], and penetrated \[them\] by view, and who attains temporary liberation, surpasses and excels the other person. For what reason? Because the Dhamma-stream carries him along. But who can know this difference except the Tathāgata?

“Who, indeed, is the female lay follower Migasālā, a foolish, incompetent woman with a woman’s intellect? And who are those \[who have\] the knowledge of other persons as superior and inferior?

“These are the six types of persons found existing in the world.

“Ānanda, if Isidatta had possessed the same kind of virtuous behavior that Purāṇa had, Purāṇa could not have even known his destination. And if Purāṇa had possessed the same kind of wisdom that Isidatta had, Isidatta could not have even known his destination. In this way, Ānanda, these two persons were each deficient in one respect.”
