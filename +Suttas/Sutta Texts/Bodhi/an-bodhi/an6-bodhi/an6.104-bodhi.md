# AN6.104 Without Identification

> **Division:** V. BENEFIT

“Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu considers six benefits, it is enough for him to establish the unlimited perception of non-self in all phenomena. What six? (1) ‘I will be without identification in the entire world. (2) I-makings will cease for me. (3) Mine-makings will cease for me. (4) I will come to possess knowledge not shared \[with worldlings\]. (5) I will have clearly seen causation. And (6) I will have clearly seen causally arisen phenomena.’
