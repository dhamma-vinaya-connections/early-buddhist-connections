# AN6.88 One Wishes to Listen

> **Division:** IV. COOLNESS

“Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, even while listening to the good Dhamma one is incapable of entering upon the fixed course \[consisting in\] rightness in wholesome qualities. What six? When the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata is being taught, (1) one does not wish to listen; (2) one does not lend an ear; (3) one does not set one’s mind on understanding; (4) one grasps the meaning wrongly; (5) one discards the meaning; and (6) one has adopted a conviction that is not in conformity \[with the teaching\]. Possessing these six qualities, even while listening to the good Dhamma one is incapable of entering upon the fixed course \[consisting in\] rightness in wholesome qualities.
