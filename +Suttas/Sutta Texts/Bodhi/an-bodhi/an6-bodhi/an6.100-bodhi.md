“Bhikkhus, (1) it is impossible that a bhikkhu who considers any phenomenon to be a self will possess a conviction in conformity \[with the teaching\]. (2) It is impossible that one who does not possess a conviction in conformity \[with the teaching\] will enter upon the fixed course of rightness. (3) It is impossible that one who does not enter upon the fixed course of rightness will realize the fruit of stream-entry, (4) the fruit of once-returning, (5) the fruit of non-returning, (6) or arahantship.
