# AN6.105 Existence

> **Division:** V. BENEFIT

“Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of existence that are to be abandoned; \[and\] one is to train in the three trainings. What are the three kinds of existence that are to be abandoned? (1) Sense-sphere existence, (2) form-sphere existence, and (3) formless-sphere existence: these are the three kinds of existence to be abandoned. In what three trainings is one to train? (4) In the higher virtuous behavior, (5) in the higher mind, and (6) in the higher wisdom. One is to train in these three trainings.

“When a bhikkhu has abandoned these three kinds of existence and has completed these three trainings, he is called a bhikkhu who has cut off craving, stripped off the fetter, and by completely breaking through conceit, he has made an end of suffering.” \[445\]
