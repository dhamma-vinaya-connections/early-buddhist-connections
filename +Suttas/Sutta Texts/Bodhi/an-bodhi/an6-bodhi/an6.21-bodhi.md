# AN6.21 Sāmaka

> **Division:** III. THE UNSURPASSED THINGS

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Sāmagāmaka near the lotus pond. Then, when the night had advanced, a certain deity of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire lotus pond, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to the Blessed One:

“Bhante, there are these three qualities that lead to the decline of a bhikkhu. What three? (1) Delight in work, (2) delight in talk, and (3) delight in sleep. These are the three qualities that lead to the decline of a bhikkhu.”

This is what that deity said. The Teacher agreed. Then that deity, thinking, “The Teacher agrees with me,” paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and disappeared right there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Last night, bhikkhus, when the night had advanced, a certain deity of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire lotus pond, approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said to me: ‘Bhante, there are these three qualities that lead to the decline of a bhikkhu. What three? Delight in work, delight in talk, and delight in sleep. These are the three qualities that lead to the decline of a bhikkhu.’ This is what that deity said. Having said this, that deity paid homage to me, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there.

“It is, bhikkhus, a misfortune and loss for those of you whom even the deities know are declining in wholesome qualities.

“I will teach, bhikkhus, another three qualities that lead to decline. Listen and attend closely. I will speak.”

“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied.

The Blessed One said this: \[310\] “And what, bhikkhus, are the three \[other\] qualities that lead to decline? (4) Delight in company, (5) being difficult to correct, and (6) bad friendship. Those are the three \[other\] qualities that lead to decline.

“Bhikkhus, all those in the past who declined in wholesome qualities declined because of these six qualities. All those in the future who will decline in wholesome qualities will decline because of these six qualities. And all those at present who are declining in wholesome qualities are declining because of these six qualities.”
