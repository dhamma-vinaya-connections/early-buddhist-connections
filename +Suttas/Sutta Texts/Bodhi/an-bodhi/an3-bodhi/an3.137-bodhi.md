# AN3.137 A Hair Blanket

> **Division:** IV. A WARRIOR

“Bhikkhus, a hair blanket is declared to be the worst kind of woven garment. A hair blanket is cold in cold weather, hot in hot weather, ugly, foul-smelling, and uncomfortable. So too, the doctrine of Makkhali is declared the worst among the doctrines of the various ascetics. The hollow man Makkhali teaches the doctrine and view: ‘There is no kamma, no deed, no energy.’ \[287\]

(1) “Bhikkhus, the Blessed Ones, Arahants, Perfectly Enlightened Ones of the past taught a doctrine of kamma, a doctrine of deeds, a doctrine of energy. Yet the hollow man Makkhali contradicts them \[with his claim\]: ‘There is no kamma, no deed, no energy.’

(2) “The Blessed Ones, Arahants, Perfectly Enlightened Ones of the future will also teach a doctrine of kamma, a doctrine of deeds, a doctrine of energy. Yet the hollow man Makkhali contradicts them \[with his claim\]: ‘There is no kamma, no deed, no energy.’

(3) “At present I am the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, and I teach a doctrine of kamma, a doctrine of deeds, a doctrine of energy. Yet the hollow man Makkhali contradicts me \[with his claim\]: ‘There is no kamma, no deed, no energy.’

“Just as a trap set at the mouth of a river would bring about harm, suffering, calamity, and disaster to many fish, so too, the hollow man Makkhali is, as it were, a ‘trap for people’ who has arisen in the world for the harm, suffering, calamity, and disaster of many beings.”
