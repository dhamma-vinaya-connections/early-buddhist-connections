# AN3.119 Activity

> **Division:** II. BOUND FOR THE PLANE OF MISERY

“Bhikkhus, there are these three failures. What three? Failure in activity, failure in livelihood, and failure in view.

(1) “And what is failure in activity? Here, someone destroys life … and indulges in idle chatter. This is called failure in activity.

(2) “And what is failure in livelihood? Here, someone is of wrong livelihood and earns a living by a wrong type of livelihood. This is called failure in livelihood.

(3) “And what is failure in view? \[271\] Here, someone holds wrong view and has an incorrect perspective thus: ‘There is nothing given … there are in the world no ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right practice who, having realized this world and the other world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.’ This is called failure in view.

“These are the three failures.

“There are, bhikkhus, these three accomplishments. What three? Accomplishment in activity, accomplishment in livelihood, and accomplishment in view.

(1) “And what is accomplishment in activity? Here, someone abstains from the destruction of life … and from idle chatter. This is called accomplishment in activity.

(2) “And what is accomplishment in livelihood? Here, someone is of right livelihood and earns a living by a right type of livelihood. This is called accomplishment in livelihood.

(3) “And what is accomplishment in view? Here, someone holds right view and has a correct perspective thus: ‘There is what is given … there are in the world ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right practice who, having realized this world and the other world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.’ This is called accomplishment in view.

“These, bhikkhus, are the three accomplishments.”
