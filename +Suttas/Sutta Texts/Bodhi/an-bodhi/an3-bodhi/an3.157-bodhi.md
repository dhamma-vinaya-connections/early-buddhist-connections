> **Division:** VI. WAYS OF PRACTICE

(157) “Bhikkhus, there are these three ways of practice. What three? The coarse way of practice, the blistering way of practice, and the middle way of practice.

(1) “And what, bhikkhus, is the coarse way of practice? … \[as in 3:156\] … This is called the coarse way of practice.

(2) “And what is the blistering way of practice? … \[as in 3:156\] … This is called the blistering way of practice.

(3) “And what is the middle way of practice? Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the non-arising of unarisen bad unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. He generates desire for the abandoning of arisen bad unwholesome states … for the arising of unarisen wholesome states … for the maintenance of arisen wholesome states, for their non-decline, increase, expansion, and fulfillment by development; \[297\] he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives….”

(158) “… he develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to desire and activities of striving. He develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to energy and activities of striving … that possesses concentration due to mind and activities of striving … that possesses concentration due to investigation and activities of striving….”

(159) “… he develops the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, the faculty of wisdom….”

(160) “… he develops the power of faith, the power of energy, the power of mindfulness, the power of concentration, the power of wisdom….”

(161) “… he develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, the enlightenment factor of discrimination of phenomena, the enlightenment factor of energy, the enlightenment factor of rapture, the enlightenment factor of tranquility, the enlightenment factor of concentration, the enlightenment factor of equanimity….”

(162) “… he develops right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. This is called the middle way of practice.

“These, bhikkhus, are the three ways of practice.”
