# AN3.104 Gratification (1)

> **Division:** I. ENLIGHTENMENT

(1) “Bhikkhus, I set out seeking the gratification in the world. Whatever gratification there is in the world—that I found. I have clearly seen with wisdom just how far the gratification in the world extends.

(2) “I set out seeking the danger in the world. Whatever danger there is in the world—that I found. I have clearly seen with wisdom just how far the danger in the world extends.

(3) “I set out seeking the escape from the world. Whatever escape there is from the world—that I found. I have clearly seen with wisdom just how far the escape from the world extends.

“So long, bhikkhus, as I did not directly know as they really are the gratification in the world as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape from it as the escape, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans. But when I directly knew as it really is the gratification in the world as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape from it as escape, then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with … its devas and humans.

“The knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘Unshakable is my liberation of mind; this is my last birth; now there is no more renewed existence.’” \[260\]
