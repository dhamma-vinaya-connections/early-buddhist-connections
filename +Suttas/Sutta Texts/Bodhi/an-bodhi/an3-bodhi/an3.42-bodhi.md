# AN3.42 Cases

> **Division:** V. THE MINOR CHAPTER

“Bhikkhus, in three cases one may be understood to have faith and confidence. What three? When one desires to see those of virtuous behavior; when one desires to hear the good Dhamma; and when one dwells at home with a mind devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing. In these three cases, one may be understood to have faith and confidence.”

One who desires to see the virtuous ones,

who wishes to hear the good Dhamma,

who has removed the stain of miserliness,

is called a person endowed with faith. \[151\]
