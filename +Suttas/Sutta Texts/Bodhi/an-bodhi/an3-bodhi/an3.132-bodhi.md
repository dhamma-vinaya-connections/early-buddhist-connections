# AN3.132 Line Etched in Stone

> **Division:** III. BHARAṆḌU

“Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. What three? The person who is like a line etched in stone, the person who is like a line etched in the ground, and the person who is like a line etched in water.

(1) “And what kind of person is like a line etched in stone? Here, some person often gets angry, and his anger persists for a long time. Just as a line etched in stone is not quickly erased by the wind and water but persists for a long time, so too, some person often gets angry, and his anger persists for a long time. This is called the person who is like a line etched in stone.

(2) “And what kind of person is like a line etched in the ground? Here, some person often gets angry, but his anger does not persist for a long time. Just as a line etched in the ground is quickly erased by the wind and water and does not persist for a long time, so too, some person often gets angry, but his anger does not persist for a long time. This is called the person who is like a line etched in the ground.

(3) “And what kind of person is like a line etched in water? Here, some person, even when spoken to roughly \[284\] and harshly, in disagreeable ways, remains on friendly terms \[with his antagonist\], mingles \[with him\], and greets \[him\]. Just as a line etched in water quickly disappears and does not persist for a long time, so too, some person, even when spoken to roughly and harshly, in disagreeable ways, remains on friendly terms \[with his antagonist\], mingles \[with him\], and greets \[him\]. This is called the person who is like a line etched in water.

“These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world.”
