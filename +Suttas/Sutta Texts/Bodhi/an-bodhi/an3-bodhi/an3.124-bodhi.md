# AN3.124 Arguments

> **Division:** III. BHARAṆḌU

“Bhikkhus, wherever bhikkhus take to arguing and quarreling and fall into a dispute, stabbing each other with piercing words, I am uneasy even about directing my attention there, let alone about going there. I conclude about them: ‘Surely, those venerable ones have abandoned three things and cultivated three \[other\] things.’

“What are the three things they have abandoned? Thoughts of renunciation, thoughts of good will, and thoughts of non-harming. These are the three things they have abandoned.

“What are the three things they have cultivated? Sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming. These are the three things they have cultivated.

“Wherever bhikkhus take to arguing and quarreling and fall into a dispute … I conclude: ‘Surely, those venerable ones have abandoned these three things and cultivated these three \[other\] things.’

“Bhikkhus, wherever bhikkhus are dwelling in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, blending like milk and water, viewing each other with eyes of affection, I am at ease about going there, let alone about directing my attention there. I conclude: ‘Surely, those venerable ones have abandoned three things and cultivated three \[other\] things.’

“What are the three things they have abandoned? \[276\] Sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming. These are the three things they have abandoned.

“What are the three things they have cultivated? Thoughts of renunciation, thoughts of good will, and thoughts of non-harming. These are the three things they have cultivated.

“Wherever bhikkhus are dwelling in concord … I conclude: ‘Surely, those venerable ones have abandoned these three things and cultivated these three \[other\] things.’”
