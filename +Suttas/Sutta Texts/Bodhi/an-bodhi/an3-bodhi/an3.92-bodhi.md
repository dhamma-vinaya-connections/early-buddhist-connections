# AN3.92 Urgent

> **Division:** V. A LUMP OF SALT

“Bhikkhus, there are these three urgent tasks of a farmer. What three? (1) First, the farmer swiftly yet thoroughly plows the field and swiftly yet thoroughly harrows it. (2) Next, he swiftly sows seeds. (3) And then he swiftly \[240\] irrigates and drains the field. These are the three urgent tasks of a farmer.

“This farmer has no psychic potency or spiritual might \[by which he could command\]: ‘Let my crops start growing today! Let them mature tomorrow! Let them bear grain the day after tomorrow!’ But, with the change of seasons, there comes a time when the crops grow, mature, and bear grain.

“So too, bhikkhus, there are these three urgent tasks of a bhikkhu. What three? (1) The undertaking of the training in the higher virtuous behavior, (2) the undertaking of the training in the higher mind, and (3) the undertaking of the training in the higher wisdom. These are the three urgent tasks of a bhikkhu.

“This bhikkhu has no psychic potency or spiritual might \[by which he could command\]: ‘Let my mind be liberated from the taints by non-clinging today, or tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow!’ Rather, as this bhikkhu trains in the higher virtuous behavior, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom, there comes an occasion when his mind is liberated from the taints by non-clinging.

“Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will have a keen desire to undertake the training in the higher virtuous behavior, the training in the higher mind, and the training in the higher wisdom.’ It is in this way that you should train yourselves.”
