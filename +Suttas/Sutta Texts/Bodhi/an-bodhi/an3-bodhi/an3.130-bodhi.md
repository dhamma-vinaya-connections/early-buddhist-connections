# AN3.130 Anuruddha (2)

> **Division:** III. BHARAṆḌU

Then the Venerable Anuruddha approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, \[282\] he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:

“Here, friend Sāriputta, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I survey a thousandfold world system. Energy is aroused in me without slackening; my mindfulness is established without confusion; my body is tranquil without disturbance; my mind is concentrated and one-pointed. Yet my mind is still not liberated from the taints through non-clinging.”

\[The Venerable Sāriputta said:\] (1) “Friend Anuruddha, when you think: ‘With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I survey a thousandfold world system,’ this is your conceit.

(2) “And when you think: ‘Energy is aroused in me without slackening; my mindfulness is established without confusion; my body is tranquil without disturbance; my mind is concentrated and one-pointed,’ this is your restlessness.

(3) “And when you think: ‘Yet my mind is still not liberated from the taints through non-clinging,’ this is your remorse.

“It would be good if you would abandon these three qualities and stop attending to them. Instead, direct your mind to the deathless element.”

Some time later the Venerable Anuruddha abandoned those three qualities and stopped attending to them. Instead, he directed his mind to the deathless element. Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, in no long time the Venerable Anuruddha realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, he dwelled in it. He directly knew: “Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.” And the Venerable Anuruddha became one of the arahants.
