# AN3.120 Purity (1)

> **Division:** II. BOUND FOR THE PLANE OF MISERY

“Bhikkhus, there are these three purities. What three? Bodily purity, verbal purity, and mental purity.

(1) “And what is bodily purity? Here, someone abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, and from sexual misconduct. This is called bodily purity.

(2) “And what is verbal purity? Here, someone abstains from false speech, from divisive speech, from harsh speech, and from idle chatter. This is called verbal purity.

(3) “And what is mental purity? Here, someone is without longing, without ill will, \[272\] and holds right view. This is called mental purity.

“These, bhikkhus, are the three purities.”
