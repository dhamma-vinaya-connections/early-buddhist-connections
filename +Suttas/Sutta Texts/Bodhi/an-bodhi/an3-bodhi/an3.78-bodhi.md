# AN3.78 Setting Up

> **Division:** III. ĀNANDA

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One…. The Blessed One then said to him:

“Ānanda, are all behavior and observances, \[austere\] lifestyles, and spiritual life fruitful when set up as the essence?”

“Not exclusively so, Bhante.”

“Well then, Ānanda, distinguish \[them\].”

“Bhante, suppose one cultivates behavior and observances, an \[austere\] lifestyle, and a spiritual life, setting them up as if they were the essence. If unwholesome qualities then increase and wholesome qualities decline, such behavior and observances, \[austere\] lifestyle, and spiritual life, set up as the essence, are fruitless. But if unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, then such behavior and observances, \[austere\] lifestyle, and spiritual life, set up as the essence, are fruitful.”

This is what the Venerable Ānanda said. The Teacher agreed. Then the Venerable Ānanda, thinking, “The Teacher has agreed,” paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and left.

Then, not long after the Venerable Ānanda had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, Ānanda is a trainee, but it is not easy to find one equal to him in wisdom.”
