# AN3.113 Bound for the Plane of Misery

> **Division:** II. BOUND FOR THE PLANE OF MISERY

“Bhikkhus, there are three who, if they do not abandon this \[fault of theirs\], are bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell. Which three? \[266\] (1) One who, though not celibate, claims to be celibate; (2) one who slanders a pure celibate leading a pure celibate life with a groundless charge of non-celibacy; and (3) one who holds such a doctrine and view as this: ‘There is no fault in sensual pleasures,’ and then falls into indulgence in sensual pleasures. These are the three who, if they do not abandon this \[fault of theirs\], are bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell.”
