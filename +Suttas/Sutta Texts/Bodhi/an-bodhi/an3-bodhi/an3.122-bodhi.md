# AN3.122 Sagacity

> **Division:** II. BOUND FOR THE PLANE OF MISERY

“Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of sagacity. What three? Bodily sagacity, verbal sagacity, and mental sagacity.

(1) “And what is bodily sagacity? Here, someone abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, and from sexual activity. This is called bodily sagacity.

(2) “And what is verbal sagacity? Here, someone abstains from false speech, from divisive speech, from harsh speech, and from idle chatter. This is called verbal sagacity.

(3) “And what is mental sagacity? Here, with the destruction of the taints, a bhikkhu has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. This is called mental sagacity.

“These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of sagacity.”

A sage by body, a sage in speech,

a sage in mind, without taints:

they call the sage, accomplished in sagacity,

“one who has abandoned all.” \[274\]
