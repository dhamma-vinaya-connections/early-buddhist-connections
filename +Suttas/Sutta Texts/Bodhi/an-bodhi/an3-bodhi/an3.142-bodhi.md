# AN3.142 Horses (3)

> **Division:** IV. A WARRIOR

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the three kinds of excellent thoroughbred horses and the three kinds of excellent thoroughbred persons. Listen … \[291\]

“And what, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of excellent thoroughbred horses? Here, one kind of excellent thoroughbred horse … possesses speed, beauty, and the right proportions. These are the three kinds of excellent thoroughbred horses.

“And what, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of excellent thoroughbred persons? Here, one kind of person … possesses speed, beauty, and the right proportions.

“And how does an excellent thoroughbred person … possess speed, beauty, and the right proportions? Here, with the destruction of the taints, a bhikkhu has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. This, I say, is his speed. And when asked a question pertaining to the Dhamma or the discipline, he answers and does not falter. This, I say, is his beauty. And he gains robes … and provisions for the sick. This, I say, is his right proportions. In this way an excellent thoroughbred person possesses speed, beauty, and the right proportions.

“These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of excellent thoroughbred persons.”
