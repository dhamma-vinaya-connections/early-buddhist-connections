# AN3.109 Peaked Roof (1)

> **Division:** I. ENLIGHTENMENT

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

“Householder, when the mind is unprotected, bodily, verbal, and mental actions are unprotected.

“For one whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds are unprotected, bodily, verbal, and mental actions become tainted. For one whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds become tainted, bodily, verbal, and mental actions become rotten. One whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds become rotten will not have a good death.

“Suppose a house with a peaked roof is badly thatched: then the roof peak, the rafters, and the walls are unprotected; the roof peak, the rafters, and the walls become tainted; the roof peak, the rafters, and the walls become rotten.

“So too, householder, \[262\] when the mind is unprotected, bodily, verbal, and mental actions are unprotected…. One whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds are rotten will not have a good death.

“When, householder, the mind is protected, bodily, verbal, and mental actions are protected.

“For one whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds are protected, bodily, verbal, and mental actions do not become tainted. For one whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds do not become tainted, bodily, verbal, and mental actions do not become rotten. One whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds do not become rotten will have a good death.

“Suppose a house with a peaked roof is well thatched: then the roof peak, the rafters, and the walls are protected; the roof peak, the rafters, and the walls do not become tainted; the roof peak, the rafters, and the walls do not become rotten.

“So too, householder, when the mind is protected, bodily, verbal, and mental actions are protected…. One whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds do not become rotten will have a good death.”
