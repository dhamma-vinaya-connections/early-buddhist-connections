# AN3.83 The Field

> **Division:** IV. ASCETICS

“Bhikkhus, there are these three preliminary tasks of a farmer. What three? (1) Here, the farmer first of all thoroughly plows and harrows the field. (2) Next, he sows seeds at the proper time. (3) And then he occasionally irrigates \[230\] and drains the field. These are the three preliminary tasks of a farmer.

“So too, bhikkhus, there are these three preliminary tasks of a bhikkhu. What three? (1) The undertaking of the training in the higher virtuous behavior, (2) the undertaking of the training in the higher mind, and (3) the undertaking of the training in the higher wisdom. These are the three preliminary tasks of a bhikkhu.

“Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will have a keen desire to undertake the training in the higher virtuous behavior … the training in the higher mind … the training in the higher wisdom.’ It is in this way that you should train yourselves.”
