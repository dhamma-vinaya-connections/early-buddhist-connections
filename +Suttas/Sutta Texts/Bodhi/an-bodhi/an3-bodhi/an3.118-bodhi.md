# AN3.118 Dice

> **Division:** II. BOUND FOR THE PLANE OF MISERY

“Bhikkhus, there are these three failures. What three? Failure in virtuous behavior, failure in mind, and failure in view.

“And what is failure in virtuous behavior? Here, someone destroys life … \[as in 3:117\] … This is called failure in view.

“Because of failure in virtuous behavior, with the breakup of the body, after death, beings are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. Because of failure in mind … Because of failure in view, with the breakup of the body, after death, beings are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

“Just as dice, when thrown upward, will rest firmly wherever they fall, so too, because of failure in virtuous behavior … failure in mind … failure in view, with the breakup of the body, after death, beings are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

“These, bhikkhus, are the three failures.

“There are, bhikkhus, these three accomplishments. What three? Accomplishment in virtuous behavior, accomplishment in mind, and accomplishment in view.

“And what, bhikkhus, is accomplishment in virtuous behavior? Here, someone abstains from the destruction of life … \[as in 3:117\] … This is called accomplishment in view.

“Because of accomplishment in virtuous behavior, with the breakup of the body, after death, beings are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. Because of accomplishment in mind … Because of accomplishment in view, with the breakup of the body, after death, beings are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.

“Just as dice, when thrown upward, will rest firmly wherever they fall, so too, because of accomplishment in virtuous behavior … accomplishment in mind … accomplishment in view, with the breakup of the body, after death, beings are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.

“These, bhikkhus, are the three accomplishments.”
