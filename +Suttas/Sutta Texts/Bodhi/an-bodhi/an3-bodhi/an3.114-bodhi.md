# AN3.114 Rare

> **Division:** II. BOUND FOR THE PLANE OF MISERY

“Bhikkhus, the manifestation of three \[persons\] is rare in the world. What three? (1) The manifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One is rare in the world. (2) A person who teaches the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata is rare in the world. (3) A grateful and thankful person is rare in the world. The manifestation of these three \[persons\] is rare in the world.”
