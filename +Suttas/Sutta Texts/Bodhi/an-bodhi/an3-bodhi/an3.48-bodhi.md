# AN3.48 Mountains

> **Division:** V. THE MINOR CHAPTER

“Bhikkhus, based on the Himalayas, the king of mountains, great sal trees grow in three ways. What three? (1) They grow in branches, leaves, and foliage; (2) they grow in bark and shoots; and (3) they grow in softwood and heartwood. Based on the Himalayas, the king of mountains, great sal trees grow in these three ways.

“So too, when the head of a family is endowed with faith, the people in the family who depend on him grow in three ways. What three? (1) They grow in faith; (2) they grow in virtuous behavior; and (3) they grow in wisdom. When the head of a family is endowed with faith, the people in the family who depend on him grow in these three ways.”

Just as the trees that grow

in dependence on a rocky mountain

in a vast forest wilderness

might become great “woodland lords,”

so, when the head of a family here

possesses faith and virtue,

his wife, children, and relatives

all grow in dependence upon him;

so too his friends, his family circle,

and those dependent on him. \[153\]

Those possessed of discernment,

seeing that virtuous man’s good conduct,

his generosity and good deeds,

emulate his example.

Having lived here in accord with Dhamma,

the path leading to a good destination,

those who desire sensual pleasures rejoice,

delighting in the deva world.
