# AN3.99 Bark Fabric

> **Division:** V. A LUMP OF SALT

“Bhikkhus, when it is new, cloth made of bark fabric is ugly, uncomfortable, and of little value. When it has been worn, cloth made of bark fabric is ugly, uncomfortable, and of little value. When it is old, cloth made of bark fabric is still ugly, uncomfortable, and of little value. They use old cloth made of bark fabric for cleaning pots or they discard it on a rubbish heap.

(1) (i) “So too, bhikkhus, if a junior bhikkhu is immoral, of bad character, this, I say, counts as his ugliness. \[247\] Just as cloth made of bark fabric is ugly, so, I say, this person is similar.

(ii) “For those who associate with him, resort to him, attend on him, and follow his example, this leads to their harm and suffering for a long time. This, I say, counts as his uncomfortableness. Just as cloth made of bark fabric is uncomfortable, so, I say, this person is similar.

(iii) “When he accepts a robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick, this \[acceptance\] is not of great fruit and benefit for those \[who offer such things\]. This, I say, counts as his being of little value. Just as cloth made of bark fabric is of little value, so, I say, this person is similar.

(2) “If a bhikkhu of middle standing …

(3) “If an elder bhikkhu is immoral, of bad character, this, I say, counts as his ugliness…. \[all as above\] … Just as cloth made of bark fabric is of little value, so, I say, this person is similar.

“If such an elder bhikkhu speaks in the midst of the Saṅgha, the bhikkhus say to him: ‘What gives you, an incompetent fool, the right to speak? Do you think you too are entitled to speak?’ He then becomes angry and displeased and utters speech on account of which the Saṅgha expels him, as if \[discarding\] the clothing made of bark fabric on the rubbish heap.

“When it is new, bhikkhus, cloth from Kāsi is beautiful, comfortable, and of great value. When it has been worn, \[248\] cloth from Kāsi is beautiful, comfortable, and of great value. When it is old, cloth from Kāsi is beautiful, comfortable, and of great value. They use old cloth from Kāsi as a wrapping for gems or they deposit it in a fragrant casket.

(1) (i) “So too, if a junior bhikkhu is virtuous, of good character, this, I say, counts as his beauty. Just as cloth from Kāsi is beautiful, so, I say, this person is similar.

(ii) “For those who associate with him, resort to him, attend on him, and follow his example, this leads to their welfare and happiness for a long time. This, I say, counts as his comfortableness. Just as cloth from Kāsi is comfortable, so, I say, this person is similar.

(iii) “When he accepts a robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick, this \[acceptance\] is of great fruit and benefit for those \[who offer such things\]. This, I say, counts as his being of great value. Just as cloth from Kāsi is of great value, so, I say, this person is similar.

(2) “If a bhikkhu of middle standing …

(3) “If an elder bhikkhu is virtuous, of good character, this, I say, counts as his beauty…. \[all as above\] … Just as cloth from Kāsi is of great value, so, I say, this person is similar.

“If such an elder bhikkhu speaks in the midst of the Saṅgha, \[249\] the bhikkhus say: ‘Please let the venerable ones be quiet. An elder bhikkhu is speaking on the Dhamma and the discipline.’ Those words of his should be preserved, just as they deposit a cloth from Kāsi in a fragrant casket.

“Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will be like cloth from Kāsi, not like cloth made of bark fabric.’ It is in such a way that you should train yourselves.”
