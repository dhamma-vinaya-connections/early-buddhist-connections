# AN3.126 Bharaṇḍu

> **Division:** III. BHARAṆḌU

On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans when he reached Kapilavatthu. Mahānāma the Sakyan heard: “The Blessed One has arrived at Kapilavatthu.” Then Mahānāma the Sakyan approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

“Go, Mahānāma, and find a suitable rest house in Kapilavatthu where we might stay for the night.” \[277\]

“Yes, Bhante,” Mahānāma replied. He then entered Kapilavatthu and searched the entire city but did not see a suitable rest house where the Blessed One could stay for the night. So he returned to the Blessed One and told him: “Bhante, there is no suitable rest house in Kapilavatthu where the Blessed One might stay for the night. But Bharaṇḍu the Kālāma, formerly the Blessed One’s fellow monk, \[is here\]. Let the Blessed One spend the night at his hermitage.”

“Go, Mahānāma, and prepare a mat for me.”

“Yes, Bhante,” Mahānāma replied. Then he went to Bharaṇḍu’s hermitage, prepared a mat, set out water for washing the feet, returned to the Blessed One, and said:

“I have spread a mat, Bhante, and set out water for washing the feet. The Blessed One may go at his own convenience.”

Then the Blessed One went to Bharaṇḍu’s hermitage, sat down on the seat that was prepared for him, and washed his feet. It then occurred to Mahānāma: “This is not a proper time for staying with the Blessed One, for he is tired. I will visit him tomorrow.” Then he paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.

Then, when the night had passed, Mahānāma approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

“There are, Mahānāma, these three kinds of teachers found existing in the world. What three?

(1) “Here, Mahānāma, some teacher prescribes the full understanding of sensual pleasures, but not of forms or feelings. (2) Another teacher prescribes the full understanding of sensual pleasures and forms, but not \[278\] of feelings. (3) Still another teacher prescribes the full understanding of sensual pleasures, forms, and feelings. These are the three kinds of teachers found existing in the world. Is the goal of these three kinds of teachers the same or different?”

When this was said, Bharaṇḍu the Kālāma said to Mahānāma: “Say the same, Mahānāma.” But the Blessed One said to Mahānāma: “Say different, Mahānāma.”

A second time … A third time Bharaṇḍu the Kālāma said to Mahānāma: “Say the same, Mahānāma.” But the Blessed One said to Mahānāma: “Say different, Mahānāma.”

Then it occurred to Bharaṇḍu: “The ascetic Gotama has contradicted me three times in front of the influential Mahānāma the Sakyan. I had better leave Kapilavatthu.”

Then Bharaṇḍu the Kālāma left Kapilavatthu. When he left Kapilavatthu, he left for good and never returned.
