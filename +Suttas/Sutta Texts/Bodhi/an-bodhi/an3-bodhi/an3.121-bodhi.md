# AN3.121 Purity (2)

> **Division:** II. BOUND FOR THE PLANE OF MISERY

“Bhikkhus, there are these three purities. What three? Bodily purity, verbal purity, and mental purity.

(1) “And what is bodily purity? Here, a bhikkhu abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, and from sexual activity. This is called bodily purity.

(2) “And what is verbal purity? Here, a bhikkhu abstains from false speech, from divisive speech, from harsh speech, and from idle chatter. This is called verbal purity.

(3) “And what is mental purity? Here, when there is sensual desire in him, a bhikkhu understands: ‘There is sensual desire in me’; or when there is no sensual desire in him, he understands: ‘There is no sensual desire in me’; and he also understands how unarisen sensual desire arises, how arisen sensual desire is abandoned, and how abandoned sensual desire does not arise again in the future.

“When there is ill will in him … When there is dullness and drowsiness in him … When there is restlessness and remorse in him … \[273\] … When there is doubt in him, he understands: ‘There is doubt in me’; or when there is no doubt in him, he understands: ‘There is no doubt in me’; and he also understands how unarisen doubt arises, how arisen doubt is abandoned, and how abandoned doubt does not arise again in the future. This is called mental purity.

“These, bhikkhus, are the three purities.”

Pure in body, pure in speech,

pure in mind, without taints:

they call the pure one, accomplished in purity,

“one who has washed away evil.”
