# AN3.91 Paṅkadhā

> **Division:** IV. ASCETICS

On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus when he reached the Kosalan town of Paṅkadhā. He then dwelled near Paṅkadhā.

Now on that occasion the bhikkhu Kassapagotta was resident at Paṅkadhā. There the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with the training rules. Then, while the Blessed One was instructing … and gladdening the bhikkhus with a talk on the Dhamma connected with the training rules, the bhikkhu Kassapagotta became impatient and bitter, \[thinking\]: “This ascetic is too stringent.”

Then, having dwelled at Paṅkadhā as long as he wanted, the Blessed One set out on tour toward Rājagaha. Wandering on tour, the Blessed One eventually arrived at Rājagaha. \[237\] There, at Rājagaha, the Blessed One dwelled on Mount Vulture Peak. Then, not long after the Blessed One had left, the bhikkhu Kassapagotta was filled with remorse and regret, \[thinking\]: “It is my misfortune and loss that when the Blessed One was instructing, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with the training rules, I became impatient and bitter, \[thinking\]: ‘This ascetic is too stringent.’ Let me now go to the Blessed One and confess my transgression to him.”

Then the bhikkhu Kassapagotta cleaned up his lodging, took his bowl and robe, and set out for Rājagaha. Eventually he arrived at Rājagaha and went to Mount Vulture Peak. He approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

“Bhante, on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at the Kosalan town of Paṅkadhā. There the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with the training rules. While he was instructing … and gladdening them, I became impatient and bitter, thinking: ‘This ascetic is too stringent.’ Then, having dwelled at Paṅkadhā as long as he wanted, the Blessed One set out on tour for Rājagaha. Not long after he left, I was filled with remorse and regret, thinking: ‘It is my misfortune and loss that when the Blessed One was instructing … and gladdening the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with the training rules, I became impatient and bitter, thinking: “This ascetic is too stringent.” Let me now go to the Blessed One and confess my transgression to him.’

“Bhante, I have committed a transgression \[238\] in that, when the Blessed One was instructing, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with the training rules, I so foolishly, stupidly, and unskillfully became impatient and bitter, thinking: ‘This ascetic is too stringent.’ Bhante, may the Blessed One accept my transgression seen as a transgression for the sake of future restraint.”

“Surely, Kassapa, you have committed a transgression in that, when I was instructing, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus with a talk on the Dhamma connected with the training rules, you so foolishly, stupidly, and unskillfully became impatient and bitter, thinking: ‘This ascetic is too stringent.’ But since you see your transgression as a transgression and make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma, we accept it. For it is growth in the Noble One’s discipline that one sees one’s transgression as a transgression, makes amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma, and undertakes future restraint.

(1) “If, Kassapa, an elder bhikkhu does not desire to train and does not speak praise of undertaking the training; if he does not encourage in the training other bhikkhus who do not desire to train; and if he does not speak genuine, real, and timely praise of those bhikkhus who desire to train, I do not speak praise of such an elder bhikkhu. For what reason? Because other bhikkhus, \[hearing\]: ‘The Teacher speaks praise of him,’ might associate with him, and those who associate with him might follow his example. If they follow his example, this would lead to their harm and suffering for a long time. Therefore I do not speak praise of such an elder bhikkhu.

(2) “If, Kassapa, a bhikkhu of middle standing … (3) If a junior bhikkhu does not desire to train and does not speak praise of undertaking the training; if he does not encourage in the training other bhikkhus who do not desire to train; and if he does not speak genuine, real, and timely praise of those bhikkhus who desire to train, I do not speak praise of such a junior bhikkhu. For what reason? Because other bhikkhus, \[hearing\]: ‘The Teacher speaks praise of him,’ might associate with him, and those who associate with him \[239\] might follow his example. If they follow his example, this would lead to their harm and suffering for a long time. Therefore I do not speak praise of such a junior bhikkhu.

(1) “If, Kassapa, an elder bhikkhu desires to train and speaks praise of undertaking the training; if he encourages in the training other bhikkhus who do not desire to train; and if he speaks genuine, real, and timely praise of those bhikkhus who desire to train, I speak praise of such an elder bhikkhu. For what reason? Because other bhikkhus, \[hearing\]: ‘The Teacher speaks praise of him,’ might associate with him, and those who associate with him might follow his example. If they follow his example, this would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time. Therefore I speak praise of such an elder bhikkhu.

For what reason? Because other bhikkhus, \[hearing\]: ‘The Teacher speaks praise of him,’ might associate with him, and those who associate with him might follow his example. If they follow his example, this would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time. Therefore I speak praise of such a junior bhikkhu.”
