# AN3.128 Pollution

> **Division:** III. BHARAṆḌU

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling in Bārāṇasī at the deer park in Isipatana. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Bārāṇasī for alms. \[280\] While walking for alms near the cattle-yoking fig tree, the Blessed One saw a dissatisfied bhikkhu, \[seeking\] gratification outwardly, muddle-minded, without clear comprehension, unconcentrated, with a wandering mind and loose sense faculties. Having seen him, he said to that bhikkhu:

“Bhikkhu, bhikkhu! Do not pollute yourself. It is inevitable, bhikkhu, that flies will pursue and attack one who has polluted himself and been tainted by a stench.”

Then, being exhorted thus by the Blessed One, that bhikkhu acquired a sense of urgency.

When the Blessed One had walked for alms in Bārāṇasī, after his meal, when he had returned from his alms round, he addressed the bhikkhus:

“Bhikkhus, this morning I dressed, took my bowl and robe, and entered Bārāṇasī for alms. While walking for alms near the cattle-yoking fig tree, I saw a dissatisfied bhikkhu \[seeking\] gratification outwardly, muddle-minded, without clear comprehension, unconcentrated, with a wandering mind and loose sense faculties. Having seen him, I said to that bhikkhu: ‘Bhikkhu, bhikkhu! Do not pollute yourself. It is inevitable, bhikkhu, that flies will pursue and attack one who has polluted himself and been tainted by a stench.’ Then, being exhorted thus by me, that bhikkhu acquired a sense of urgency.”

When this was said, a certain bhikkhu asked the Blessed One: “What, Bhante, is meant by ‘pollution’? What is the ‘stench’? And what are the ‘flies’?”

(1) “Longing, bhikkhu, is what is meant by ‘pollution.’ (2) Ill will is the ‘stench.’ (3) Bad unwholesome thoughts are the ‘flies.’ It is inevitable that flies will pursue and attack one who has polluted himself and been tainted by a stench.” \[281\]

The flies—thoughts based on lust—

will run in pursuit of one

unrestrained in the sense faculties,

unguarded in the eye and ear.

A bhikkhu who is polluted,

tainted by a stench,

is far from nibbāna

and reaps only distress.

Whether in the village or the forest,

the unwise foolish person,

not having gained peace for himself,

goes around followed by flies.

But those accomplished in virtuous behavior

who delight in wisdom and peace,

those peaceful ones live happily,

having destroyed the flies.
