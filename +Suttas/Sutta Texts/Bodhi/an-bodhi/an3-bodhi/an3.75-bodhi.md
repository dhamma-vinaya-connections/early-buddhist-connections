# AN3.75 Should Be Encouraged

> **Division:** III. ĀNANDA

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

“Ānanda, those for whom you have compassion and who think you should be heeded, whether friends or companions, relatives or family members, should be encouraged, settled, and established by you in three things. What three?

(1) “They should be encouraged, settled, and established in unwavering confidence in the Buddha thus: ‘The Blessed One is … \[as in 3:70\] … teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’

(2) “They should be encouraged, settled, and established in unwavering confidence in the Dhamma thus: ‘The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible … \[as in 3:70\] … to be personally experienced by the wise.’

(3) “They should be encouraged, settled, and established in unwavering confidence in the Saṅgha thus: ‘The Saṅgha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practicing the good way … \[as in 3:70\] … the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.’

“There might be, Ānanda, alteration in the four great elements—the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element—but there cannot be alteration in a noble disciple who possesses unwavering confidence in the Buddha. In this context, this is alteration: that this noble disciple who possesses unwavering confidence in the Buddha could be reborn in hell, in the animal realm, or in the sphere of afflicted spirits. Such a thing is impossible. \[223\]
