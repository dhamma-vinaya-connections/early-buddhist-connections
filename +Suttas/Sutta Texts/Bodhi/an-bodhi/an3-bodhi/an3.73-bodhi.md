# AN3.73 The Sakyan

> **Division:** III. ĀNANDA

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Park. Now on that occasion the Blessed One had just recently recovered from illness. Then the Sakyan Mahānāma approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

“For a long time, Bhante, I have understood the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One thus: ‘Knowledge occurs for one who is concentrated, not for one who lacks concentration.’ Does concentration precede knowledge, Bhante, or does knowledge precede concentration?”

Then it occurred to the Venerable Ānanda: “The Blessed One has just recently recovered from his illness, yet this Mahānāma the Sakyan asks him a very deep question. Let me lead Mahānāma the Sakyan off to one side and teach him the Dhamma.”

Then the Venerable Ānanda took Mahānāma the Sakyan by the arm, led him off to one side, and said to him: “The Blessed One has spoken about the virtuous behavior of a trainee and the virtuous behavior of one beyond training, the concentration of a trainee \[220\] and the concentration of one beyond training, the wisdom of a trainee and the wisdom of one beyond training.

(1) “And what, Mahānāma, is the virtuous behavior of a trainee? Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. This is called the virtuous behavior of a trainee.

(2) “And what is the concentration of a trainee? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna … \[as at 3:58\] … the fourth jhāna…. This is called the concentration of a trainee.

(3) “And what is the wisdom of a trainee? Here, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: ‘This is suffering’ … \[as in 3:12\] … ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’ This is called the wisdom of a trainee.

“When this noble disciple is thus accomplished in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom, with the destruction of the taints, he realizes for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.

“It is in this way, Mahānāma, that the Blessed One has spoken about the virtuous behavior of a trainee and the virtuous behavior of one beyond training; about the concentration of a trainee and the concentration of one beyond training; about the wisdom of a trainee and the wisdom of one beyond training.”
