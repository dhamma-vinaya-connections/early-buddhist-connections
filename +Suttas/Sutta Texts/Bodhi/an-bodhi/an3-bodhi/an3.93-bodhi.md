# AN3.93 Solitude

> **Division:** V. A LUMP OF SALT

“Bhikkhus, wanderers of other sects prescribe these three kinds of solitude. What three? Solitude with respect to robes, solitude with respect to almsfood, and solitude with respect to lodgings.

“This, bhikkhus, is what wanderers of other sects prescribe as solitude with respect to robes: they wear hemp robes, robes of hemp-mixed cloth, shroud robes, rag-robes; robes made from tree bark, antelope hides, strips of antelope hide; robes of _kusa_ grass, bark fabric, or wood-shavings fabric; a blanket made of head hair or of animal wool, \[241\] a covering made of owls’ wings. That is what wanderers of other sects prescribe as solitude with respect to robes.

“This is what wanderers of other sects prescribe as solitude with respect to almsfood: they eat greens, millet, forest rice, hide-parings, moss, rice bran, the scum of rice, sesamum flour, grass, or cow dung. They subsist on forest roots and fruits; they feed on fallen fruits. That is what wanderers of other sects prescribe as solitude with respect to almsfood.

“This is what wanderers of other sects prescribe as solitude with respect to lodgings: a forest, the foot of a tree, a charnel ground, remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves, the open air, a heap of straw, a chaff-house. That is what wanderers of other sects prescribe as solitude with respect to lodgings.

“These are the three kinds of solitude that wanderers of other sects prescribe.

“In this Dhamma and discipline, bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of solitude for a bhikkhu. What three?

“Here, (1) a bhikkhu is virtuous; he has abandoned immorality and remains secluded from it. (2) He holds right view; he has abandoned wrong view and remains secluded from it. (3) He is one whose taints are destroyed; he has abandoned the taints and remains secluded from them.

“When a bhikkhu is virtuous, one who has abandoned immorality and remains secluded from it; when he is one of right view, who has abandoned wrong view and remains secluded from it; when he is one whose taints are destroyed, who has abandoned the taints and remains secluded from them, he is then called a bhikkhu who has attained the foremost, attained the core, one who is pure and established in the core.

“Suppose, bhikkhus, there is a farmer whose field of hill rice has ripened. The farmer would swiftly have the plants cut. Then he would swiftly have the plants collected. Then he would swiftly \[242\] have them transported \[to the threshing place\]. Then he would swiftly pile them up, have them threshed, get the straw removed, get the chaff removed, and winnow it. Then he would swiftly have it brought over, get it pounded, and get the husks removed. In this way, the farmer’s grains of rice would be foremost, attained the core, pure, and established in the core.

“So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is virtuous … one of right view … one who has abandoned the taints and remains secluded from them, he is then called a bhikkhu who is foremost, attained the core, pure, and established in the core.”
