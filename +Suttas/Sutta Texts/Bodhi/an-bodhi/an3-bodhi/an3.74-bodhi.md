# AN3.74 The Nigaṇṭha

> **Division:** III. ĀNANDA

On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then the Licchavi Abhaya and the Licchavi Paṇḍitakumāra approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Licchavi Abhaya then said to the Venerable Ānanda:

“Bhante, the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing and to have all-embracing knowledge and vision, \[saying\]: ‘When I am walking, standing, sleeping, and awake, knowledge and vision are constantly and continuously present to me.’ He prescribes the termination of old kammas by means of austerity and the demolition of the bridge by not creating any new kamma. \[221\] Thus, through the destruction of kamma, suffering is destroyed. Through the destruction of suffering, feeling is destroyed. Through the destruction of feeling, all suffering will be worn away. In this way, the overcoming \[of suffering\] takes place through this directly visible purification by wearing away. What does the Blessed One say about this?”

“Abhaya, these three kinds of wearing-away purification have been properly expounded by the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One who knows and sees, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna. What three?

(1) “Here, Abhaya, a bhikkhu is virtuous … \[as in 3:73\] … Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. He does not create any new kamma and he terminates the old kamma having contacted it again and again. The wearing away is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.

(2) “When, Abhaya, this bhikkhu is thus accomplished in virtuous behavior, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna … \[as in 3:58\] … the fourth jhāna…. He does not create any new kamma and he terminates the old kamma having contacted it again and again. The wearing away is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.

(3) “When, Abhaya, this bhikkhu is thus accomplished in virtuous behavior and concentration, then, with the destruction of the taints, he realizes for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. He does not create any new kamma and he terminates the old kamma having contacted it again and again. The wearing away is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.

“These, Abhaya, are the three kinds of wearing-away purification that have been properly expounded by the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One who knows and sees, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna.”

When this was said, the Licchavi Paṇḍitakumāra said to the Licchavi Abhaya: “Why, friend Abhaya, don’t you thank the Venerable Ānanda for his well-stated words?”

“How, friend, could I not thank the Venerable Ānanda for his well-stated words? \[222\] If one were not to thank the Venerable Ānanda for his well-stated words, one’s head would split apart!”
