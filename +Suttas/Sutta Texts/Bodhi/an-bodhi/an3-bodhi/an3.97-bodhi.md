# AN3.97 Thoroughbred (2)

> **Division:** V. A LUMP OF SALT

\[All as in 3:96, with only the following difference in factor (3):\]

“And how does a bhikkhu possess speed? Here, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, a bhikkhu is one of spontaneous birth, due to attain final nibbāna there without ever returning from that world. It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses speed.

“Possessing these three qualities, a bhikkhu is … an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.”
