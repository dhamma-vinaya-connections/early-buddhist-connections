# AN3.85 A Trainee

> **Division:** IV. ASCETICS

Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One … and said to him: “Bhante, it is said: ‘A trainee, a trainee.’ In what way is one a trainee?”

“He trains, bhikkhu, therefore he is called a trainee. And in what does he train? He trains in the higher virtuous behavior; he trains in the higher mind; he trains in the higher wisdom. He trains, bhikkhu, therefore he is called a trainee.”

As the trainee trains

along the straight path,

the knowledge of destruction arises first

immediately followed by final knowledge.

Thereafter, when the fetters of existence are destroyed,

for one liberated by final knowledge,

the knowledge arises:

“My liberation is unshakable.”
