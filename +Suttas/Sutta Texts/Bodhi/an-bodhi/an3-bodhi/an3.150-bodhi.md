# AN3.150 Maimed (1)

> **Division:** V. AUSPICIOUS

“Bhikkhus, possessing three qualities, the foolish, incompetent, bad person maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition; he is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise; and he generates much demerit. What three? Unwholesome bodily action, unwholesome verbal action, and unwholesome mental action. Possessing these three qualities … he generates much demerit.

Wholesome bodily action, wholesome verbal action, and wholesome mental action. Possessing these three qualities … he generates much merit.”
