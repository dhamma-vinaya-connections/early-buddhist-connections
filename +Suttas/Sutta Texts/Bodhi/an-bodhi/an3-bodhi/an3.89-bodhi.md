# AN3.89 The Trainings (1)

> **Division:** IV. ASCETICS

“Bhikkhus, there are these three trainings. What three? The training in the higher virtuous behavior, the training in the higher mind, and the training in the higher wisdom.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the training in the higher virtuous behavior? Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous…. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. This is called the training in the higher virtuous behavior.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the training in the higher mind? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna … the fourth jhāna…. This is called the training in the higher mind.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the training in the higher wisdom? Here, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’ This is called the training in the higher wisdom.

“These, bhikkhus, are the three trainings.”
