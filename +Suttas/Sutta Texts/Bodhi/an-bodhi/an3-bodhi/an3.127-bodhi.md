# AN3.127 Hatthaka

> **Division:** III. BHARAṆḌU

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, when the night had advanced, the young deva Hatthaka, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, \[while thinking:\] “I will stand in front of the Blessed One,” he sank down, descended, and could not remain in place. Just as ghee or oil, when poured on sand, sinks down, descends, and does not remain in place, so the young deva Hatthaka, \[while thinking:\] “I will stand in front of the Blessed One,” sank down, descended, and could not remain in place. \[279\]

Then the Blessed One said to Hatthaka: “Create a gross body, Hatthaka.”

“Yes, Bhante,” Hatthaka replied. Then he created a gross body, paid homage to the Blessed One, and stood to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

“Hatthaka, do those teachings that you could recall in the past, when you were a human being, come back to you now?”

“Bhante, those teachings that I could recall in the past, when I was a human being, come back to me now; and those teachings that I could not recall in the past, when I was a human being, come back to me now. Just as the Blessed One is now hemmed in by bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male and female lay followers, kings and royal ministers, sectarian teachers and their disciples, so I am hemmed in by other young devas. Young devas come to me even from a distance, \[thinking\]: ‘We will hear the Dhamma from the young deva Hatthaka.’

“I died, Bhante, insatiable and unquenchable in three things. What three? (1) I died insatiable and unquenchable in seeing the Blessed One. (2) I died insatiable and unquenchable in hearing the good Dhamma. (3) I died insatiable and unquenchable in attending upon the Saṅgha. I died insatiable and unquenchable in these three things.

“I could never get enough of

seeing the Blessed One,

hearing the good Dhamma,

and attending on the Saṅgha.

“Training in the higher virtuous behavior,

I rejoiced in hearing the good Dhamma.

Hatthaka has gone to \[rebirth in\] Aviha

not having gotten enough of these three things.”
