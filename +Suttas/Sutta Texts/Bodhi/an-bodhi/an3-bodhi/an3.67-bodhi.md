# AN3.67 Bases of Talk

> **Division:** II. THE GREAT CHAPTER

“Bhikkhus, there are these three bases of talk. What three? (1) Referring to the past, one would say: ‘So it was in the past.’ (2) Referring to the future, one would say: ‘So it will be in the future.’ (3) Referring to the present, one would say: ‘So it is now, at present.’

“It is in relation to talk, bhikkhus, that a person may be understood as either fit to talk or unfit to talk. If this person is asked a question that should be answered categorically and he does not answer it categorically; \[if he is asked\] a question that should be answered after making a distinction and he answers it without making a distinction; \[if he is asked\] a question that should be answered with a counter-question and he answers it without asking a counter-question; \[if he is asked\] a question that should be set aside and he does not set it aside, in such a case this person is unfit to talk.

“But if this person is asked a question that should be answered categorically and he answers it categorically; \[if he is asked\] a question that should be answered after making a distinction and he answers it after making a distinction; \[if he is asked\] a question that should be answered with a counter-question and he answers it with a counter-question; \[if he is asked\] a question that should be set aside and he sets it aside, in such a case this person is fit to talk.

“It is in relation to talk, bhikkhus, that a person should be understood as either fit to talk or unfit to talk. If this person is asked a question and he does not stand firm in regard to his position and the opposing position; if he does not stand firm in his stratagem; if he does not \[198\] stand firm in an assertion about what is known; if he does not stand firm in the procedure, in such a case this person is unfit to talk.

“But if this person is asked a question and he stands firm in regard to his position and the opposing position; if he stands firm in his stratagem; if he stands firm in an assertion about what is known; if he stands firm in the procedure, in such a case this person is fit to talk.

“It is in relation to talk, bhikkhus, that a person should be understood as either fit to talk or unfit to talk. If this person is asked a question and he answers evasively, diverts the discussion to an irrelevant subject, and displays anger, hatred, and bitterness, in such a case this person is unfit to talk.

“But if this person is asked a question and he does not answer evasively, divert the discussion to an irrelevant subject, or display anger, hatred, and bitterness, in such a case this person is fit to talk.

“It is in relation to talk, bhikkhus, that a person should be understood as either fit to talk or unfit to talk. If this person is asked a question and he overwhelms \[the questioner\], crushes him, ridicules him, and seizes upon a slight error, in such a case this person is unfit to talk.

“But if this person is asked a question and he does not overwhelm \[the questioner\], or crush him, or ridicule him, or seize upon a slight error, in such a case this person is fit to talk.

“It is in relation to talk, bhikkhus, that a person should be understood as either having a supporting condition or not having a supporting condition. One who does not lend an ear does not have a supporting condition; one who lends an ear has a supporting condition. One who has a supporting condition directly knows one thing, fully understands one thing, abandons one thing, and realizes one thing. Directly knowing one thing, fully understanding one thing, abandoning one thing, and realizing one thing, he reaches right liberation.

“This, bhikkhus, is the goal of talk, the goal of discussion, the goal of a supporting condition, the goal of lending an ear, that is, the emancipation of the mind through non-clinging.” \[199\]

Those who speak with quarrelsome intent,

settled in their opinions, swollen with pride,

ignoble, having assailed virtues,

look for openings \[to attack\] one another.

They mutually delight when their opponent

speaks badly and makes a mistake,

\[they rejoice\] in his bewilderment and defeat;

but noble ones don’t engage in such talk.

If a wise person wants to talk,

having known the time is right,

without quarrelsomeness or pride,

the sagely person should utter

the speech that the noble ones practice,

which is connected with the Dhamma and meaning.

Not being insolent or aggressive,

with a mind not elated,

he speaks free from envy

on the basis of right knowledge.

He should approve of what is well expressed

but should not attack what is badly stated.

He should not train in faultfinding

nor seize on the other’s mistakes;

he should not overwhelm and crush his opponent,

nor speak mendacious words.

Truly, a discussion among the good

is for the sake of knowledge and confidence.

Such is the way the noble discuss things;

this is the discussion of the noble ones.

Having understood this, the wise person

should not swell up but should discuss things.
