# AN3.76 Existence

> **Division:** III. ĀNANDA

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

“Bhante, it is said: ‘existence, existence.’ In what way, Bhante, is there existence?”

(1) “If, Ānanda, there were no kamma ripening in the sensory realm, would sense-sphere existence be discerned?”

“No, Bhante.”

“Thus, Ānanda, for beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, kamma is the field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture for their consciousness to be established in an inferior realm. In this way there is the production of renewed existence in the future.

(2) “If, Ānanda, there were no kamma ripening in the form realm, would form-sphere existence be discerned?”

“No, Bhante.”

“Thus, Ānanda, for beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, kamma is the field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture for their consciousness to be established in a middling realm. In this way there is the production of renewed existence in the future.

(3) “If, Ānanda, there were no kamma ripening in the formless realm, would formless-sphere existence be discerned?” \[224\]

“No, Bhante.”

“Thus, Ānanda, for beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, kamma is the field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture for their consciousness to be established in a superior realm. In this way there is the production of renewed existence in the future.

“It is in this way, Ānanda, that there is existence.”
