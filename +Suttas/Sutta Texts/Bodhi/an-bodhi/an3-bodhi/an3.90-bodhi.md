# AN3.90 The Trainings (2)

> **Division:** IV. ASCETICS

“Bhikkhus, there are these three trainings. What three? The training in the higher virtuous behavior, the training in the higher mind, and the training in the higher wisdom.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the training in the higher virtuous behavior? Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous…. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. This is called the training in the higher virtuous behavior.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the training in the higher mind? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna … \[236\] the fourth jhāna…. This is called the training in the higher mind.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the training in the higher wisdom? Here, with the destruction of the taints, a bhikkhu realizes for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.

“These, bhikkhus, are the three trainings.”

Energetic, strong, and resolute,

meditative, mindful, the faculties guarded,

one should practice the higher virtue,

the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.

As before, so after;

as after, so before;

as below, so above;

as above, so below;

as by day, so at night;

as at night, so by day,

having overcome all quarters,

with measureless concentration.

They call him a trainee on the path,

whose conduct has been well purified.

They call him enlightened in the world,

a wise one who has fulfilled the practice.

For one freed by craving’s destruction,

with the cessation of consciousness

the emancipation of the mind

is like the extinguishing of a lamp.
