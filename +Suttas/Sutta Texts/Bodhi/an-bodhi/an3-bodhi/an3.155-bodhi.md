# AN3.155 A Good Morning

> **Division:** V. AUSPICIOUS

“Bhikkhus, those beings who engage in good conduct by body, speech, and mind in the morning have a good morning. Those beings who engage in good conduct by body, speech, and mind in the afternoon have a good afternoon. And those beings who engage in good conduct by body, speech, and mind in the evening have a good evening.”

Truly propitious and auspicious,

a happy daybreak and a joyful rising,

a precious moment and a blissful hour

will come for those who offer alms

to those leading the spiritual life.

Upright acts of body and speech,

upright thoughts and aspirations:

when one does what is upright

one gains upright benefits.

Those happy ones who have gained such benefits

come to growth in the Buddha’s teaching.

May you and all your relatives

be healthy and happy! \[295\]
