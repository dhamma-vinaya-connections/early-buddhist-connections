# AN3.143 The Peacock Sanctuary (1)

> **Division:** IV. A WARRIOR

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha at the wanderers’ park, the peacock sanctuary. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: …

“Bhikkhus, possessing three qualities, a bhikkhu is best among devas and humans: one who has reached the ultimate conclusion, won ultimate security from bondage, lived the ultimate spiritual life, and gained the ultimate consummation. What three? (1) The aggregate of virtuous behavior of one beyond training, (2) the aggregate of concentration of one beyond training, and (3) the aggregate of wisdom of one beyond training. Possessing these three qualities, a bhikkhu is best among devas and humans … and gained the ultimate consummation.”
