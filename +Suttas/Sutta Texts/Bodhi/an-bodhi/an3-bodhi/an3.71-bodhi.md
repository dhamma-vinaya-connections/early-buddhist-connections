# AN3.71 Channa

> **Division:** III. ĀNANDA

Then the wanderer Channa approached the Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Ānanda:

“Friend Ānanda, do you prescribe the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion?”

“We do, friend.” \[216\]

“But what is the danger that you have seen on account of which you prescribe the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion?”

(1) “One excited by lust, friend, overcome by lust, with mind obsessed by it, intends for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, and for the affliction of both, and he experiences mental suffering and dejection. But when lust is abandoned, he does not intend for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both, and he does not experience mental suffering and dejection.

“One excited by lust, overcome by lust, with mind obsessed by it, engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when lust is abandoned, one does not engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. One excited by lust, overcome by lust, with mind obsessed by it, does not understand as it really is his own good, the good of others, and the good of both. But when lust is abandoned, one understands as it really is one’s own good, the good of others, and the good of both. Lust leads to blindness, loss of vision, and lack of knowledge; it is obstructive to wisdom, aligned with distress, and does not lead to nibbāna.

(2) “One full of hate, overcome by hatred …

(3) “One deluded, overcome by delusion, with mind obsessed by it, intends for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, and for the affliction of both, and he experiences mental suffering and dejection. But when delusion is abandoned, he does not intend for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both, and he does not experience mental suffering and dejection.

“One deluded, overcome by delusion, with mind obsessed by it, engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when delusion is abandoned, he does not engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. One deluded, overcome by delusion, with mind obsessed by it, does not understand as it really is his own good, the good of others, and the good of both. But when delusion \[217\] is abandoned, one understands as it really is one’s own good, the good of others, and the good of both. Delusion leads to blindness, loss of vision, and lack of knowledge; it is obstructive to wisdom, aligned with distress, and does not lead to nibbāna.

“Having seen these dangers in lust, hatred, and delusion, we prescribe their abandoning.”

“But is there a path, friend, is there a way to the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion?”

“There is a path, friend, there is a way to the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion.”

“But what is the path, what is the way to the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion?”

“It is just this noble eightfold path, that is, right view … right concentration. This is the path, the way to the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion.”

“Excellent, friend, is the path, excellent the way to the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion. It is enough, friend Ānanda, to be heedful.”
