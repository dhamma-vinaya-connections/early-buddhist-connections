# AN3.110 Peaked Roof (2)

> **Division:** I. ENLIGHTENMENT

The Blessed One then said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika:

“Householder, when the mind has failed, bodily, verbal, and mental actions fail. One whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds fail will not have a good death.

“Suppose a house with a peaked roof is badly thatched: then the roof peak, the rafters, and the walls fail. So too, when the mind has failed, bodily, verbal, and mental actions fail. One whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds have failed will not have a good death.

“Householder, when the mind has not failed, bodily, verbal, and mental actions do not fail. One whose deeds of body, speech, and mind do not fail will have a good death.

“Suppose a house with a peaked roof is well thatched: then the roof peak, \[263\] the rafters, and the walls do not fail. So too, when the mind has not failed, bodily, verbal, and mental actions do not fail. One whose deeds of body, speech, and mind do not fail will have a good death.”
