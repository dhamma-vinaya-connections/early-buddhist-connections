# AN3.125 Gotamaka

> **Division:** III. BHARAṆḌU

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī at the Gotamaka Shrine. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus …

“Bhikkhus, (1) I teach the Dhamma through direct knowledge, not without direct knowledge. (2) I teach the Dhamma with a basis, not without a basis. (3) I teach the Dhamma that is antidotal, not one without antidotes. Since I teach the Dhamma through direct knowledge, not without direct knowledge; since I teach the Dhamma with a basis, not without a basis; since I teach the Dhamma that is antidotal, not one without antidotes, my exhortation should be acted upon, my instructions should be acted upon. It is enough for you to rejoice, enough for you to be elated, enough for you to be joyful: ‘The Blessed One is perfectly enlightened! The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One! The Saṅgha is practicing the good path!’”

This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One’s statement. And while this discourse was being spoken, the thousandfold world system shook.
