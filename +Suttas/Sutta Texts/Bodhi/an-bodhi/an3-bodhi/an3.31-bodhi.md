# AN3.31 Brahmā

> **Division:** IV. DIVINE MESSENGERS

(1) “Bhikkhus, those families dwell with Brahmā where at home the mother and father are revered by their children. (2) Those families dwell with the first teachers where at home the mother and father are revered by their children. (3) Those families dwell with the gift-worthy where at home the mother and father are revered by their children.

“‘Brahmā,’ bhikkhus, is a designation for mother and father. ‘First teachers’ is a designation for mother and father. ‘Giftworthy’ is a designation for mother and father. For what reason? Mother and father are helpful to their children: they raise them, nurture them, and show them the world.”

Mother and father are called “Brahmā”

and also “first teachers.”

They are worthy of gifts from their children,

for they have compassion for their offspring.

Therefore a wise person should revere them,

and show them due honor,

serve them with food and drink,

with clothes and bedding,

by massaging and bathing them,

and by washing their feet.

Because of this service

to mother and father,

the wise praise one in this world

and after death one rejoices in heaven.
