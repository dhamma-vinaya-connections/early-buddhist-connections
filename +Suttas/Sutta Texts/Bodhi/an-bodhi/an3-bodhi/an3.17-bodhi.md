# AN3.17 Oneself

> **Division:** II. THE CART MAKER

“Bhikkhus, these three qualities lead to one’s own affliction, the affliction of others, and the affliction of both. What three? Bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct. These three qualities lead to one’s own affliction, the affliction of others, and the affliction of both.

“These three \[other\] qualities do not lead to one’s own affliction, the affliction of others, and the affliction of both. What three? Bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, and mental good conduct. These three qualities do not lead to one’s own affliction, the affliction of others, and the affliction of both.” \[115\]
