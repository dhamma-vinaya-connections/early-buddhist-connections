# SN52.7 The Destruction of Craving

At Sāvatthī. There the Venerable Anuruddha addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Friends, bhikkhus!”

“Friend!” those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Anuruddha said this:

“Friends, these four establishments of mindfulness, when developed and cultivated, lead to the destruction of craving. What four? Here, friends, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body … feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. These four establishments of mindfulness, when developed and cultivated, lead to the destruction of craving.”
