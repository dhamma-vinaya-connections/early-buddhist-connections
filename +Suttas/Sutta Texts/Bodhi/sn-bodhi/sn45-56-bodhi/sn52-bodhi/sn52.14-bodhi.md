# SN52.14 Encompassing the Mind

1… "Further, friends, it is because I have developed and cultivated these four establishments of mindfulness that I understand the minds of other beings and persons, having encompassed them with my own mind. I understand a mind with lust as a mind with lust … an unliberated mind as an unliberated mind."
