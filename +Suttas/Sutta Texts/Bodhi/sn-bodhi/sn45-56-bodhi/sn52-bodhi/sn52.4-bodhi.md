# SN52.4 The Thornbush Grove (1)

On one occasion the Venerable Anuruddha, the Venerable Sāriputta, and the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna were dwelling at Sāketa in the Thornbush Grove. Then, in the evening, the Venerable Sāriputta and the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna emerged from seclusion, approached the Venerable Anuruddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side, and the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Anuruddha:

“Friend Anuruddha, what are the things that a bhikkhu who is a trainee should enter and dwell in?”

“Friend, Sāriputta, a bhikkhu who is a trainee should enter and dwell in the four establishments of mindfulness. What four? Here, friend, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body … \[299\] … feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. A bhikkhu who is a trainee should enter and dwell in these four establishments of mindfulness.”
