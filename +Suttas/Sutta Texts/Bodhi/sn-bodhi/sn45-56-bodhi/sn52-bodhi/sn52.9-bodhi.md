# SN52.9 All, or Ambapālī’s Grove

On one occasion the Venerable Anuruddha and the Venerable Sāriputta were dwelling at Vesālī in Ambapālī’s Grove. Then, in the evening, the Venerable Sāriputta emerged from seclusion…. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Anuruddha:

“Friend Anuruddha, your faculties are serene, your complexion is pure and bright. In what dwelling does the Venerable Anuruddha now usually dwell?”

“Now, friend, I usually dwell with a mind well established in the four establishments of mindfulness. What four? Here, friend, I dwell contemplating the body in the body … feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, \[302\] clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world.

“The bhikkhu, friend, who is an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, one completely liberated through final knowledge, usually dwells with a mind well established in these four establishments of mindfulness.”

“It is a gain for us, friend, it is well gained by us, friend, that we were in the very presence of the Venerable Anuruddha when he made such a bellowing utterance.”
