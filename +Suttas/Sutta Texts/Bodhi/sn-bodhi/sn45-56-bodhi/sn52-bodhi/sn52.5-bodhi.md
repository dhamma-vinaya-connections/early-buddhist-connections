# SN52.5 The Thornbush Grove (2)

At Sāketa. Sitting to one side the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Anuruddha:

“Friend Anuruddha, what are the things that a bhikkhu who is beyond training should enter and dwell in?”

“Friend, Sāriputta, a bhikkhu who is beyond training should enter and dwell in the four establishments of mindfulness. What four? Here, friend, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body … feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. A bhikkhu who is beyond training should enter and dwell in these four establishments of mindfulness.”
