# SN52.11 A Thousand Aeons

1On one occasion the Venerable Anuruddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Venerable Anuruddha and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Anuruddha:

2"By having developed and cultivated what things has the Venerable Anuruddha attained to greatness of direct knowledge?"

"It is, friends, because I have developed and cultivated the four establishments of mindfulness that I have attained to greatness of direct knowledge. What four? Here, friends, I dwell contemplating the body in the body … feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world.

"It is, friends, because I have developed and cultivated these four establishments of mindfulness that I have attained to greatness of direct knowledge. Further, friends, it is because I have developed and cultivated these four establishments of mindfulness that I recollect a thousand aeons."
