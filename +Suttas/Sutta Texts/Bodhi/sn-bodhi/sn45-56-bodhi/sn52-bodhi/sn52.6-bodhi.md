# SN52.6 The Thornbush Grove (3)

At Sāketa. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Anuruddha:

“By having developed and cultivated what things has the Venerable Aruruddha attained to greatness of direct knowledge?”

“It is, friend, because I have developed and cultivated the four establishments of mindfulness that I have attained to greatness of direct knowledge. What four? Here, friend, I dwell contemplating the body in the body … feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world.

“It is, friend, because I have developed and cultivated these four establishments of mindfulness that I have attained to greatness of direct knowledge. Further, friend, it is because I have developed and cultivated these four establishments of mindfulness that I directly know the thousandfold world.” \[300\]
