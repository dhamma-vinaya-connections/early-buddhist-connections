# SN48.71-82 The River Ganges—Eastward, Etc.

“Bhikkhus, just as the river Ganges slants, slopes, and inclines towards the east, so too a bhikkhu who develops and cultivates the five spiritual faculties slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.

“And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu develop and cultivate the five spiritual faculties so that he slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the faculty of faith, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. He develops the faculty of energy … the faculty of mindfulness … the faculty of concentration … the faculty of wisdom, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release.

“It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu develops and cultivates the five spiritual faculties so that he slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.” \[240\]

  
  

(The remaining suttas of this vagga are to be similarly elaborated parallel to 45:92-102.)

> Six about slanting to the east  
>   
> And six about slanting to the ocean.  
>   
> These two sixes make up twelve:  
>   
> Thus the subchapter is recited.
