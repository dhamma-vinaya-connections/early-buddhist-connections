# SN48.55 Heartwood

“Bhikkhus, just as among fragrant heartwoods red sandalwood is declared to be their chief, so too, among the states conducive to enlightenment the faculty of wisdom is declared to be their chief, that is, for the attainment of enlightenment.

“And what, bhikkhus, are the states conducive to enlightenment? The faculty of faith … the faculty of wisdom….” \[232\]
