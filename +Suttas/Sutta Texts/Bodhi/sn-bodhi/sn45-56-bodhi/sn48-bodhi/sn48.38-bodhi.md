# SN48.38 Analysis (3)

(All as in the preceding sutta, but with the last two paragraphs as follows: ) \[211\]

“Therein, bhikkhus, the pleasure faculty and the joy faculty should be seen to be pleasant feeling. The pain faculty and the displeasure faculty should be seen to be painful feeling. The equanimity faculty should be seen to be neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.

“Thus, bhikkhus, according to the method of exposition, these five faculties, having been five, become three; and having been three, become five.”
