# SN48.65 Two Fruits

© Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Bodhi.  (More copyright information)
1"Bhikkhus, there are these five faculties. What five? The faculty of faith … the faculty of wisdom. These are the five faculties.

"When, bhikkhus, these five faculties have been developed and cultivated, one of two fruits may be expected: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue of clinging, the state of nonreturning."
