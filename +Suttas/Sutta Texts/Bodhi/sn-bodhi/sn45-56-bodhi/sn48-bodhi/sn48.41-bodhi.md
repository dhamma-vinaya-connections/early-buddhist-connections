# SN48.41 Subject to Aging

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in the Eastern Park in the Mansion of Migāra’s Mother. Now on that occasion the Blessed One had emerged from seclusion in the evening and was sitting warming his back in the last rays of the sun.

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One. Having approached and paid homage, while massaging the Blessed One’s limbs, he said to him: “It is wonderful, venerable sir! It is amazing, venerable sir! The Blessed One’s complexion is no longer pure and bright, his limbs are all flaccid and wrinkled, his body is stooped, and some alteration is seen in his faculties—in the eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, the body faculty.” \[217\]

“So it is, Ānanda! In youth one is subject to aging; in health one is subject to illness; while alive one is subject to death. The complexion is no longer pure and bright, the limbs are all flaccid and wrinkled, the body is stooped, and some alteration is seen in the faculties—in the eye faculty … the body faculty.”

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

> “Fie on you, wretched aging,  
>   
> Aging which makes beauty fade!  
>   
> So much has the charming puppet  
>   
> Been crushed beneath advancing age.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> One who might live a hundred years  
>   
> Also has death as destination.  
>   
> Death spares none along the way  
>   
> But comes crushing everything.”
