# SN48.32 Stream-Enterer

“Bhikkhus, there are these five faculties. What five? The pleasure faculty … the equanimity faculty.

“When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple understands as they really are the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of these five faculties, then he is called a noble disciple who is a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as his destination.” \[208\]
