# SN48.5 Arahant (2)

“Bhikkhus, there are these five faculties. What five? The faculty of faith … the faculty of wisdom.

“When, bhikkhus, having understood as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of these five faculties, a bhikkhu is liberated by nonclinging, then he is called a bhikkhu who is an arahant … one completely liberated through final knowledge.”
