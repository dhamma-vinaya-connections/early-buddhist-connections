# SN48.125-136 The River Ganges—Eastward, Etc.

“Bhikkhus, just as the river Ganges slants, slopes, and inclines towards the east, so too a bhikkhu who develops and cultivates the five spiritual faculties slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.

“And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu develop and cultivate the five spiritual faculties so that he slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the faculty of faith … the faculty of wisdom, which has as its final goal the removal of lust, the removal of hatred, the removal of delusion.

“It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu develops and cultivates the five spiritual faculties so that he slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.” \[242\]
