# SN48.13 In Brief (2)

“Bhikkhus, there are these five faculties. What five? The faculty of faith … the faculty of wisdom. These are the five faculties.

“One who has completed and fulfilled these five faculties is an arahant. If they are weaker than that, one is a nonreturner… a once-returner… a stream-enterer… a Dhamma-follower … a faith-follower.

“Thus, bhikkhus, due to a difference in the faculties there is a difference in the fruits; due to a difference in the fruits there is a difference among persons.” \[201\]
