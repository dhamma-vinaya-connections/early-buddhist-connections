# SN48.35 Ascetics and Brahmins (2)

“Those ascetics or brahmins, bhikkhus, who do not understand the pleasure faculty, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation; who do not understand the joy faculty … the pain faculty … the displeasure faculty … the equanimity faculty, its origin, its cessation, \[209\] and the way leading to its cessation … do not in this very life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism or the goal of brahminhood.

“But, bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who understand these things … in this very life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism and the goal of brahminhood.”
