# SN48.37 Analysis (2)

(All as in the preceding sutta, omitting the last sentence and with the following addition:) \[210\]

“Therein, bhikkhus, the pleasure faculty and the joy faculty should be seen to be pleasant feeling. The pain faculty and the displeasure faculty should be seen to be painful feeling. The equanimity faculty should be seen to be neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.

“These, bhikkhus, are the five faculties.”
