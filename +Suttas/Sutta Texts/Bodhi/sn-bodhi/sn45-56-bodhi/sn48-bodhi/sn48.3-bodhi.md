# SN48.3 Stream-Enterer (2)

“Bhikkhus, there are these five faculties. What five? The faculty of faith … the faculty of wisdom.

“When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple understands as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, \[194\] and the escape in the case of these five faculties, then he is called a noble disciple who is a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as his destination.”
