# SN48.36 Analysis (1)

“Bhikkhus, there are these five faculties. What five? The pleasure faculty … the equanimity faculty.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the pleasure faculty? Whatever bodily pleasure there is, whatever bodily comfort, the pleasant comfortable feeling born of body-contact: this, bhikkhus, is called the pleasure faculty.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the pain faculty? Whatever bodily pain there is, whatever bodily discomfort, the painful uncomfortable feeling born of body-contact: this, bhikkhus, is called the pain faculty.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the joy faculty? Whatever mental pleasure there is, whatever mental comfort, the pleasant comfortable feeling born of mind-contact: this, bhikkhus, is called the joy faculty.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the displeasure faculty? Whatever mental pain there is, whatever mental discomfort, the painful uncomfortable feeling born of mind-contact: this, bhikkhus, is called the displeasure faculty.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the equanimity faculty? Whatever feeling there is, whether bodily or mental, that is neither comfortable nor uncomfortable: this, bhikkhus, is called the equanimity faculty.

“These, bhikkhus, are the five faculties.”
