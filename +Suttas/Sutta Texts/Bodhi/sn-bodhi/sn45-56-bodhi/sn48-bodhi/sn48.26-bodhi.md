# SN48.26 Stream-Enterer

“Bhikkhus, there are these six faculties. What six? The eye faculty … the mind faculty.

“When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple understands as they really are the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of these six faculties, then he is called a noble disciple who is a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as his destination.”
