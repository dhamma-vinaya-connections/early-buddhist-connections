# SN48.34 Ascetics and Brahmins (1)

“Bhikkhus, there are these five faculties. What five? The pleasure faculty … the equanimity faculty.

“Those ascetics or brahmins, bhikkhus, who do not understand as they really are the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of these five faculties … do not in this very life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism or the goal of brahminhood.

“But, bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who understand these things … in this very life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism and the goal of brahminhood.”
