# SN48.70 The Tree (4)

“Bhikkhus, just as, among the trees of the supaṇṇas the silk-cotton tree is declared to be their chief, so too, among the states conducive to enlightenment the faculty of wisdom is declared to be their chief … (all as above) \[239\] … that is, for the attainment of enlightenment.”
