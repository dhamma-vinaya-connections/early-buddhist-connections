# SN48.19 Equipped

Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

“Venerable sir, it is said, ‘one equipped with faculties, one equipped with faculties.’ In what way, venerable sir, is one equipped with faculties?” \[203\]

“Here, bhikkhu, a bhikkhu develops the faculty of faith, which leads to peace, leads to enlightenment. He develops the faculty of energy … the faculty of mindfulness … the faculty of concentration … the faculty of wisdom, which leads to peace, leads to enlightenment.

“It is in this way, bhikkhu, that one is equipped with faculties.”
