# SN48.67 The Tree (1)

“Bhikkhus, just as, among the trees of Jambudīpa the rose-apple tree is declared to be their chief, so too, among the states conducive to enlightenment the faculty of wisdom is declared to be their chief, that is, for the attainment of enlightenment.

“And what, bhikkhus, are the states conducive to enlightenment? The faculty of faith, bhikkhus, is a state conducive to enlightenment; it leads to enlightenment…. The faculty of wisdom is a state conducive to enlightenment; it leads to enlightenment.

“Just as, bhikkhus, among the trees of Jambudīpa the rose-apple tree is declared to be their chief, so too, among the states conducive to enlightenment the faculty of wisdom is declared to be their chief, that is, for the attainment of enlightenment.” \[238\]
