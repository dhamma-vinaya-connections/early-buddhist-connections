# SN55.16 Friends and Colleagues (1)

“Bhikkhus, those for whom you have compassion and who think you should be heeded—whether friends or colleagues, relatives or kinsmen—these you should exhort, settle, and establish in the four factors of stream-entry.

“What four? \[365\] You should exhort, settle, and establish them in confirmed confidence in the Buddha thus: ‘The Blessed One is … teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ You should exhort, settle, and establish them in confirmed confidence in the Dhamma … in the Saṅgha … in the virtues dear to the noble ones, unbroken … leading to concentration.

“Those for whom you have compassion … these you should exhort, settle, and establish in these four factors of stream-entry.”
