# SN55.51 With Verses

(The prose portion is the same as §46.) \[405\]

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

> “When one has faith in the Tathāgata,  
>   
> Unshakable and well established,  
>   
> And good conduct built on virtue,  
>   
> Dear to the noble ones and praised;
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> “When one has confidence in the Saṅgha  
>   
> And view that has been rectified,  
>   
> They say that one is not poor,  
>   
> That one’s life is not vain.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> “Therefore the person of intelligence,  
>   
> Remembering the Buddha’s Teaching,  
>   
> Should be devoted to faith and virtue,  
>   
> To confidence and vision of the Dhamma.”
