# SN55.43 Streams (3)

“Bhikkhus, there are these four streams of merit.… What four?

“Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses confirmed confidence in the Buddha … in the Dhamma … in the Saṅgha.…

“Again, bhikkhus, a noble disciple is wise, he possesses wisdom directed to arising and passing away, \[402\] which is noble and penetrative, leading to the complete destruction of suffering. This is the fourth stream of merit.…

“These are the four streams of merit.…

“When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses these four streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, it is not easy to take the measure of his merit thus: ‘Just so much is his stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, nutriment of happiness’; rather, it is reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.”

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

> “One who desires merit, established in the wholesome,  
>   
> Develops the path to attain the Deathless;  
>   
> He who has reached the Dhamma’s core,  
>   
> Delighting in destruction,  
>   
> Does not tremble thinking,  
>   
> ‘The King of Death will come.’”
