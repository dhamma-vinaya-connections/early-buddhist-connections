# SN55.39 Kāḷigodhā

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha’s Park. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed and, taking bowl and robe, went to the residence of Kāḷigodhā the Sakyan lady, where he sat down in the appointed seat. Then Kāḷigodhā the Sakyan lady approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to her:

“Godhā, a noble woman disciple who possesses four things is a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as her destination. What four?

“Here, Godhā, a noble woman disciple possesses confirmed confidence in the Buddha thus: ‘The Blessed One is … teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ She possesses confirmed confidence in the Dhamma … in the Saṅgha.… \[397\] She dwells at home with a mind devoid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, delighting in relinquishment, one devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing.

“A noble woman disciple, Godhā, who possesses these four things is a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as her destination.”

“Venerable sir, as to these four factors of stream-entry taught by the Blessed One, these things exist in me, and I live in conformity with those things. For, venerable sir, I possess confirmed confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. Moreover, whatever there is in my family that is suitable for giving, all that I share unreservedly among those who are virtuous and of good character.”

“It is a gain for you, Godhā! It is well gained by you, Godhā! You have declared the fruit of stream-entry.”
