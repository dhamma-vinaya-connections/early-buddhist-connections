# SN55.32 Streams of Merit (2)

“Bhikkhus, there are these four streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, nutriments of happiness. What four?

(As above for the first three, the fourth as follows:) \[392\]

“Again, bhikkhus, a noble disciple dwells at home with a mind devoid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, delighting in relinquishment, one devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing. This is the fourth stream of merit.

“These are the four streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, nutriments of happiness.”
