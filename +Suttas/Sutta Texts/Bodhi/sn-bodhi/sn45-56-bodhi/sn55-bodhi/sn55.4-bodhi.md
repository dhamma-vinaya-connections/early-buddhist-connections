# SN55.4 Sāriputta (1)

On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta and the Venerable Ānanda were dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, in the evening, the Venerable Ānanda emerged from seclusion.… Sitting to one side, the Venerable Ānanda said to the Venerable Sāriputta:

  
  

“Friend Sāriputta, on account of possessing how many things are people declared by the Blessed One to be stream-enterers, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as their destination?” \[347\]

“It is on account of possessing four things, friend Ānanda, that people are declared by the Blessed One to be stream-enterers, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as their destination. What four? Here, friend, a noble disciple possesses confirmed confidence in the Buddha thus: ‘The Blessed One is … teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ He possesses confirmed confidence in the Dhamma … in the Saṅgha.… He possesses the virtues dear to the noble ones, unbroken … leading to concentration.

“It is, friend, on account of possessing these four things that people are declared by the Blessed One to be stream-enterers, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as their destination.”
