# SN55.52 One Who Spent the Rains

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now on that occasion a certain bhikkhu who had spent the rains in Sāvatthī had arrived in Kapilavatthu on some business. The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu heard: “A certain bhikkhu, it is said, who spent the rains in Sāvatthī has arrived in Kapilavatthu.”

Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu approached that bhikkhu and paid homage to him, after which they sat down to one side and said to him:

“We hope, venerable sir, that the Blessed One is healthy and robust.”

“The Blessed One, friends, is healthy and robust.” \[406\]

“We hope, venerable sir, that Sāriputta and Moggallāna are healthy and robust.”

“Sāriputta and Moggallāna, friends, are healthy and robust.”

  
  

“We hope, venerable sir, that the bhikkhus of the Saṅgha are healthy and robust.”

“The bhikkhus of the Saṅgha, friends, are healthy and robust.”

“Did you hear and learn anything, venerable sir, in the presence of the Blessed One during this rains?”

“In the presence of the Blessed One, friends, I heard and learnt this: ‘Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus are few who, by the destruction of the taints, in this very life enter and dwell in the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge. Those bhikkhus are more numerous who, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, have become of spontaneous birth, due to attain Nibbāna there without returning from that world.’

“Further, friends, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learnt this: ‘Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus are few who … have become of spontaneous birth.… Those bhikkhus are more numerous who, with the utter destruction of three fetters and with the diminishing of greed, hatred, and delusion, have become once-returners who, after coming back to this world only one more time, will make an end to suffering.’

“Further, friends, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learnt this: ‘Those bhikkhus are few who … have become once-returners.… Those bhikkhus are more numerous who, with the utter destruction of three fetters, have become stream-enterers, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as their destination.’”
