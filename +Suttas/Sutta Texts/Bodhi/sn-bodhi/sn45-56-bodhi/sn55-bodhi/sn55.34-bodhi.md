# SN55.34 Divine Tracks (1)

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, there are these four divine tracks of the devas for the purification of beings who have not been purified, for the cleansing of beings who have not been cleansed. What four?

“Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses confirmed confidence in the Buddha thus: ‘The Blessed One is … teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ This is the first divine track of the devas.… \[393\]

“Again, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses confirmed confidence in the Dhamma … in the Saṅgha.… He possesses the virtues dear to the noble ones, unbroken … leading to concentration. This is the fourth divine track of the devas.…

“These are the four divine tracks of the devas, for the purification of beings who have not been purified, for the cleansing of beings who have not been cleansed.”
