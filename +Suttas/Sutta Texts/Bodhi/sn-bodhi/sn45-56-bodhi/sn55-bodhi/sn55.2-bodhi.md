# SN55.2 Grounded

“Bhikkhus, a noble disciple who possesses four things is a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as his destination. 

“What four? Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses confirmed confidence in the Buddha thus: ‘The Blessed One is … teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ He possesses confirmed confidence in the Dhamma … in the Saṅgha.… He possesses the virtues dear to the noble ones, unbroken … leading to concentration. \[344\]

“A noble disciple, bhikkhus, who possesses these four things is a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as his destination.”

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

> “Those who possess faith and virtue,  
>   
> Confidence and vision of the Dhamma,  
>   
> In time arrive at the happiness  
>   
> Grounded upon the holy life.”
