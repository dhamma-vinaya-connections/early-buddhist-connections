# SN55.37 Mahānāma

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha’s Park. Then Mahānāma the Sakyan approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

“Venerable sir, in what way is one a lay follower?”

“When, Mahānāma, one has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, one is then a lay follower.”

  
  

“In what way, venerable sir, is a lay follower accomplished in virtue?”

“When, Mahānāma, a lay follower abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from wines, liquor, and intoxicants that are a basis for negligence, the lay follower is accomplished in virtue.”

“In what way, venerable sir, is a lay follower accomplished in faith?”

“Here, Mahānāma, a lay follower is a person of faith. He places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: ‘The Blessed One is … teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ In that way a lay follower is accomplished in faith.”

“In what way, venerable sir, is a lay follower accomplished in generosity?”

“Here, Mahānāma, a lay follower dwells at home with a mind devoid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, delighting in relinquishment, one devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing. In that way a lay follower is accomplished in generosity.”

“In what way, venerable sir, is a lay follower accomplished in wisdom?”

“Here, Mahānāma, a lay follower is wise, he possesses wisdom directed to arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative, leading to the complete destruction of suffering. In that way a lay follower is accomplished in wisdom.” \[396\]
