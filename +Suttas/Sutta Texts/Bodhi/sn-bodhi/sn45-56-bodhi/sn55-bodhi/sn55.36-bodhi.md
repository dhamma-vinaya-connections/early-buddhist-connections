# SN55.36 Similar to the Devas

“Bhikkhus, when a noble disciple possesses four things, the devas are elated and speak of his similarity \[to themselves\]. What four?

“Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses confirmed confidence in the Buddha thus: ‘The Blessed One is … teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ To those devatās who passed away here \[in the human world\] and were reborn there \[in a heavenly world\] possessing confirmed confidence in the Buddha, the thought occurs: ‘As the noble disciple possesses the same confirmed confidence in the Buddha that we possessed when we passed away there and were reborn here, he will come into the presence of the devas.’

“Again, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses confirmed confidence in the Dhamma … in the Saṅgha.… He possesses the virtues dear to the noble ones, unbroken … conducive to concentration. To those devatās who passed away here \[in the human world\] and were reborn there \[in a heavenly world\] possessing the virtues dear to the noble ones, the thought occurs: ‘As the noble disciple possesses the same kind of virtues dear to the noble ones that we possessed when we passed away there and were reborn here, he will come into the presence of the devas.’

“When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses these four things, the devas are elated and speak of his similarity \[to themselves\].” \[395\]
