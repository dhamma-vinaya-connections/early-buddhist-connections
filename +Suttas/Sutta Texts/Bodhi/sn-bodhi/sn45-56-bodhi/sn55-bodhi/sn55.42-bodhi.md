# SN55.42 Streams (2)

“Bhikkhus, there are these four streams of merit.… What four?

“Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses confirmed confidence in the Buddha … in the Dhamma … in the Saṅgha.…

“Again, bhikkhus, a noble disciple dwells at home with a mind devoid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, delighting in relinquishment, one devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing.

“These are the four streams of merit.…

“When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses these four streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, it is not easy to take the measure of his merit thus: ‘Just so much is his stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, nutriment of happiness’; rather, it is reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.

“Bhikkhus, just as in the place where these great rivers meet and converge—namely, the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, and the Mahī—it is not easy to take the measure of the water there thus: ‘There are so many gallons of water’ … but rather it is reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water; so too, when a noble disciple possesses these four streams of merit … it is reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.”

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

> “Just as the many rivers used by the hosts of people,  
>   
> … (verses as in §41) …  
>   
> As the rivers carry their waters to the sea.”
