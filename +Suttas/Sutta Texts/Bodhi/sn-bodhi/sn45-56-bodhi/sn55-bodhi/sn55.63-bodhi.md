# SN55.63-74 Extensiveness of Wisdom, Etc.

“Bhikkhus, these four things, when developed and cultivated, lead to extensiveness of wisdom … to vastness of wisdom … to depth of wisdom … to the state of unequalled wisdom … to breadth of wisdom … to abundance of wisdom … to quickness of wisdom … to buoyancy of wisdom … to joyousness of wisdom … \[413\] … to swiftness of wisdom … to sharpness of wisdom … to penetrativeness of wisdom. What four? Association with superior persons, hearing the true Dhamma, careful attention, practice in accordance with the Dhamma. These four things, when developed and cultivated, lead to penetrativeness of wisdom.”
