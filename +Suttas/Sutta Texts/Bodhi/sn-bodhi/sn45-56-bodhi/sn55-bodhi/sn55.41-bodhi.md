# SN55.41 Streams (1)

(The opening is identical with §31, continuing thus:) \[400\]

“When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses these four streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, it is not easy to take the measure of his merit thus: ‘Just so much is his stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, nutriment of happiness’; rather, it is reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.

“Bhikkhus, just as it is not easy to take the measure of the water in the great ocean thus: ‘There are so many gallons of water,’ or ‘There are so many hundreds of gallons of water,’ or ‘There are so many thousands of gallons of water,’ or ‘There are so many hundreds of thousands of gallons of water,’ but rather it is reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water; so too, when a noble disciple possesses these four streams of merit … it is reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.”

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

> “Just as the many rivers used by the hosts of people,  
>   
> Flowing downstream, finally reach the ocean,  
>   
> The great mass of water, the boundless sea,  
>   
> The fearsome receptacle of heaps of gems;
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> “So the streams of merit reach the wise man—  
>   
> Giver of food, drink, and clothes,  
>   
> Provider of beds, seats, and coverlets—  
>   
> As the rivers carry their waters to the sea.” \[401\]
