# SN56.2 Seclusion

“Bhikkhus, make an exertion in seclusion. A bhikkhu who is secluded understands things as they really are.

“And what does he understand as it really is? He understands as it really is: ‘This is suffering.’… ‘This is the origin of suffering. ’… ‘This is the cessation of suffering.’… ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’ \[415\]

  
  

“Bhikkhus, make an exertion in seclusion. A bhikkhu who is secluded understands things as they really are.

“Therefore, bhikkhus, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is suffering.’… An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’”
