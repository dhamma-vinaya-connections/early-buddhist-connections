# SN56.53 Water at the Confluence (1)

“Bhikkhus, suppose that in the place where these great rivers meet and converge—that is, the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, and the Mahī—a man would draw out two or three drops of water. \[461\] What do you think, bhikkhus, which is more: these two or three drops of water that have been drawn out or the water at the confluence?”

“Venerable sir, the water at the confluence is more. The two or three drops of water that have been drawn out are trifling. Compared to the water at the confluence, the two or three drops of water that have been drawn out are not calculable, do not bear comparison, do not amount even to a fraction.”

“So too, bhikkhus, for a noble disciple … Therefore an exertion should be made.…”
