# SN51.30 A Number of Bhikkhus (2)

Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One…. The Blessed One then said to them: “Bhikkhus, what now is spiritual power? What is the basis for spiritual power? What is the development of the bases for spiritual power? What is the way leading to the development of the bases for spiritual power?”

(The Buddha answers his own questions exactly as in §19.)
