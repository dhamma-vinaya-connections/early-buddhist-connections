# SN51.29 A Number of Bhikkhus (1)

Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: “Venerable sir, what now is spiritual power? What is the basis for spiritual power? What is the development of the bases for spiritual power? What is the way leading to the development of the bases for spiritual power?”

(The Buddha’s answers are exactly the same as in §19.) \[288\]
