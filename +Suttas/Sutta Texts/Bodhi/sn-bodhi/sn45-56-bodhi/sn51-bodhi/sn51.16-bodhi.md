# SN51.16 Ascetics and Brahmins (1)

“Bhikkhus, whatever ascetics or brahmins in the past were of great spiritual power and might, all were so because they had developed and cultivated the four bases for spiritual power. Whatever ascetics or brahmins in the future will be of great spiritual power and might, all will be so because they will have developed and cultivated the four bases for spiritual power. Whatever ascetics or brahmins at present are of great spiritual power and might, all are so because they have developed and cultivated the four bases for spiritual power.

“What four? \[274\] Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis for spiritual power that possesses concentration due to desire and volitional formations of striving. He develops the basis for spiritual power that possesses concentration due to energy … concentration due to mind … concentration due to investigation and volitional formations of striving.

“Bhikkhus, whatever ascetics or brahmins in the past … in the future … at present are of great spiritual power and might, all are so because they have developed and cultivated these four bases for spiritual power.”
