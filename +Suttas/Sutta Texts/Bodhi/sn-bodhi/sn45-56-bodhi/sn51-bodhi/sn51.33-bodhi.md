# SN51.33-44 The River Ganges—Eastward, Etc.

“Bhikkhus, just as the river Ganges slants, slopes, and inclines towards the east, so too a bhikkhu who develops and cultivates the four bases for spiritual power slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.

  
  

“And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu develop and cultivate the four bases for spiritual power so that he slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis for spiritual power that possesses concentration due to desire and volitional formations of striving. He develops the basis for spiritual power that possesses concentration due to energy … concentration due to mind … concentration due to investigation and volitional formations of striving.

“It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu \[291\] develops and cultivates the four bases for spiritual power so that he slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.”

  
  

(The remaining suttas of this vagga are to be similarly elaborated parallel to 45:92-102.)

> Six about slanting to the east  
>   
> And six about slanting to the ocean.  
>   
> These two sixes make up twelve:  
>   
> Thus the subchapter is recited.
