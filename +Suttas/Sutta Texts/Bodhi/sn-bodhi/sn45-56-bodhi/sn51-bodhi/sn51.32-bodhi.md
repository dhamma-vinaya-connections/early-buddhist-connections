# SN51.32 The Tathāgata

There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “What do you think, bhikkhus, by having developed and cultivated what things has the Tathāgata become so powerful and mighty?”

“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One….”

  
  

“It is because he has developed and cultivated the four bases for spiritual power that the Tathāgata has become so powerful and mighty. What four? Here, bhikkhus, the Tathāgata has developed the basis for spiritual power that possesses concentration due to desire and volitional formations of striving, thinking: ‘Thus my desire will be neither too slack nor too tense; and it will be neither constricted internally nor distracted externally.’ And he has dwelt perceiving after and before: ‘As before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so at night; as at night, so by day.’ Thus, with a mind that is open and unenveloped, he has developed the mind imbued with luminosity. He has developed the basis for spiritual power that possesses concentration due to energy … concentration due to mind … concentration due to investigation and volitional formations of striving, thinking: ‘Thus my investigation will be neither too slack nor too tense; and it will be neither constricted internally nor distracted externally.’… Thus, with a mind that is open and unenveloped, he has developed the mind imbued with luminosity.

“It is, bhikkhus, because he has developed and cultivated these four bases for spiritual power that the Tathāgata has become so powerful and mighty.

“It is, bhikkhus, because the Tathāgata has developed and cultivated these four bases for spiritual power that he wields the various kinds of spiritual power, such that: having been one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one … \[290\] he exercises mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world….

“It is, bhikkhus, because the Tathāgata has developed and cultivated these four bases for spiritual power that by the destruction of the taints, in this very life he enters and dwells in the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, realizing it for himself with direct knowledge.”
