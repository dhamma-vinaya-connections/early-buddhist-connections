# SN51.77-86 Floods

“Bhikkhus, there are these five higher fetters. What five? Lust for form, lust for the formless, conceit, restlessness, ignorance. These are the five higher fetters. The five powers are to be developed for direct knowledge of these five higher fetters, for the full understanding of them, for their utter destruction, for their abandoning.

“What five? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the power of faith … the power of wisdom, which has as its final goal the removal of lust, the removal of hatred, the removal of delusion.

“These five powers are to be developed for direct knowledge of these five higher fetters, for the full understanding of them, for their utter destruction, for their abandoning.”

> Floods, bonds, kinds of clinging,  
>   
> Knots, and underlying tendencies,  
>   
> Cords of sensual pleasure, hindrances,  
>   
> Aggregates, fetters lower and higher.

(All to be elaborated by way of the five powers having as their final goal the removal of lust, the removal of hatred, the removal of delusion.)
