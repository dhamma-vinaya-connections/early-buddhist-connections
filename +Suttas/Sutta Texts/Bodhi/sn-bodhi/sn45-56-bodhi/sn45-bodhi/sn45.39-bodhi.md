# SN45.39 The Holy Life (1)

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the holy life and the fruits of the holy life. Listen to that….

“And what, bhikkhus, is the holy life? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view ... right concentration. This is called the holy life.

“And what, bhikkhus, are the fruits of the holy life? The fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of nonreturning, the fruit of arahantship. These are called the fruits of the holy life.”
