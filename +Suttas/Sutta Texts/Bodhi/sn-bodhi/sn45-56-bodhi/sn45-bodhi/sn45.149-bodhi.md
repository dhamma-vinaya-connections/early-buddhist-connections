# SN45.149 Strenuous

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, just as whatever strenuous deeds are done, are all done based upon the earth, established upon the earth, \[46\] so too, based upon virtue, established upon virtue, a bhikkhu develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path.

“And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu, based upon virtue, established upon virtue, develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view … right concentration, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu, based upon virtue, established upon virtue, develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path.”
