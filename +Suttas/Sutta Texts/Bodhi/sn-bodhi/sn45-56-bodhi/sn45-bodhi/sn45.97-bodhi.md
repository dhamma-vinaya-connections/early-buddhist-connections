# SN45.97-102 The Ocean

“Bhikkhus, just as the river Ganges … \[40\] … whatever great rivers there are … all slant, slope, and incline towards the ocean, so too a bhikkhu who develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.”

(Complete as in §§91–96.)
