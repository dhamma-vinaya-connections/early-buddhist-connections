# SN45.168 Troubles

“Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of trouble. What three? The trouble of lust, the trouble of hatred, the trouble of delusion. These are the three kinds of trouble. The Noble Eightfold Path is to be developed for direct knowledge of these three kinds of trouble, for the full understanding of them, for their utter destruction, for their abandoning.”
