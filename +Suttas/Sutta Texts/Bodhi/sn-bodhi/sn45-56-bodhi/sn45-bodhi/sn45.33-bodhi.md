# SN45.33 Neglected

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, those who have neglected the Noble Eightfold Path have neglected the noble path leading to the complete destruction of suffering. Those who have undertaken the Noble Eightfold Path have undertaken the noble path leading to the complete destruction of suffering. \[24\]

“And what, bhikkhus, is the Noble Eightfold Path? It is: right view … right concentration. Those who have neglected this Noble Eightfold Path … Those who have undertaken this Noble Eightfold Path have undertaken the noble path leading to the complete destruction of suffering.”
