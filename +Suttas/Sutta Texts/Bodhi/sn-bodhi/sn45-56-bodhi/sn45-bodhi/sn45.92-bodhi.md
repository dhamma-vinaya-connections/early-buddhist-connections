# SN45.92-96 Slanting to the East (2–6)

“Bhikkhus, just as the river Yamunā ... \[39\] … the river Aciravatı̄ … the river Sarabhū … the river Mahı̄ … whatever great rivers there are—that is, the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Aciravatı̄, the Sarabhū, the Mahı̄—all slant, slope, and incline towards the east, so too a bhikkhu who develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.”

(Complete as in §91.)
