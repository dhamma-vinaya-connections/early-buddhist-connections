# SN45.162 Discriminations

“Bhikkhus, there are these three discriminations. What three? The discrimination ‘I am superior,’ the discrimination ‘I am equal,’ the discrimination ‘I am inferior.’ These are the three discriminations. The Noble Eightfold Path is to be developed for direct knowledge of these three discriminations, for the full understanding of them, for their utter destruction, for their abandoning.

“What Noble Eightfold Path? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view … right concentration, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. This Noble Eightfold Path is to be developed for the direct knowledge of these three discriminations … for their abandoning.”
