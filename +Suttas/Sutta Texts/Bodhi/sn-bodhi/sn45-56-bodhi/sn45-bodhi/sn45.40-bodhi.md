# SN45.40 The Holy Life (2)

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the holy life and the goal of the holy life. Listen to that….

“And what, bhikkhus, is the holy life? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view ... right concentration. This is called the holy life. \[27\]

“And what, bhikkhus, is the goal of the holy life? The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion. This is called the goal of the holy life.”
