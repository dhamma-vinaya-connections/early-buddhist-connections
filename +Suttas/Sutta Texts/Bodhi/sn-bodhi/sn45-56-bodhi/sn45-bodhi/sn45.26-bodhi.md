# SN45.26 The Inferior Person (2)

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the inferior person and the one who is worse than the inferior person. I will teach you the superior person and the one who is better than the superior person. Listen to that….

“And what, bhikkhus, is the inferior person? Here someone is of wrong view ... wrong concentration. This is called the inferior person.

  
  

“And what, bhikkhus, is the one who is worse than the inferior person? Here someone is of wrong view ... wrong concentration, wrong knowledge, wrong liberation. This is called the one who is worse than the inferior person.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the superior person? Here someone is of right view ... right concentration. This is called the superior person.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the one who is better than the superior person? Here someone is of right view ... right concentration, right knowledge, right liberation. This is called the one who is better than the superior person.”
