# SN45.38 Brahminhood (2)

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you brahminhood and the goal of brahminhood. Listen to that….

“And what, bhikkhus, is brahminhood? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view ... right concentration. This is called brahminhood.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the goal of brahminhood? The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion. This is called the goal of brahminhood.”
