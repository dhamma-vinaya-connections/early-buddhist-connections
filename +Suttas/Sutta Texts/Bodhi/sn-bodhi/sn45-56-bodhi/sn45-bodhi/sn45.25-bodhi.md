# SN45.25 The Inferior Person (1)

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the inferior person and the superior person. Listen to that….

“And what, bhikkhus, is the inferior person? Here someone is of wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong concentration. This is called the inferior person.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the superior person? Here someone is of right view, right intention, right speech, \[20\] right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. This is called the superior person.”
