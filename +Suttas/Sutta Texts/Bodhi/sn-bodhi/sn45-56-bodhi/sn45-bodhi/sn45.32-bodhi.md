# SN45.32 Practice (2)

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the one practising wrongly and the one practising rightly. Listen to that….

“And what, bhikkhus, is the one practising wrongly? Here someone is of wrong view ... wrong concentration. This is called the one practising wrongly.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the one practising rightly? Here someone is of right view … right concentration. This is called the one practising rightly.”
