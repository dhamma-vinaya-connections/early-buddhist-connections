# SN45.35 Asceticism (1)

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you asceticism and the fruits of asceticism. Listen to that….

“And what, bhikkhus, is asceticism? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view ... right concentration. This is called asceticism.

“And what, bhikkhus, are the fruits of asceticism? The fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of nonreturning, the fruit of arahantship. These are called the fruits of asceticism.”
