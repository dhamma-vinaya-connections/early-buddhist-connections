# SN45.31 Practice (1)

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you wrong practice and right practice. Listen to that….

“And what, bhikkhus, is wrong practice? It is: wrong view .... wrong concentration. This is called wrong practice.

“And what, bhikkhus, is right practice? It is: right view ... right concentration. This is called right practice.”
