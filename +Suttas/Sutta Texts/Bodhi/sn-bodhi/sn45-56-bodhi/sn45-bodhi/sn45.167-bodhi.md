# SN45.167 Stains

“Bhikkhus, there are these three stains. What three? The stain of lust, the stain of hatred, the stain of delusion. These are the three stains. The Noble Eightfold Path is to be developed for direct knowledge of these three stains, for the full understanding of them, for their utter destruction, for their abandoning.”
