# SN45.41 The Fading Away of Lust

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, if wanderers of other sects ask you: ‘For what purpose, friends, is the holy life lived under the ascetic Gotama?’—being asked thus, you should answer them thus: ‘It is, friends, for the fading away of lust that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One.’

“Then, bhikkhus, if the wanderers of other sects ask you: ‘But, friends, is there a path, is there a way for the fading away of lust?’—being asked thus, you should answer them thus: ‘There is a path, friends, there is a way for the fading away of lust.’

“And what, bhikkhus, is that path, what is that way \[28\] for the fading away of lust? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view ... right concentration. This is the path, this is the way for the fading away of lust.

“Being asked thus, bhikkhus, you should answer those wanderers of other sects in such a way.”
