# SN45.27 The Pot

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, just as a pot without a stand is easily knocked over, while one with a stand is difficult to knock over, so the mind without a stand is easily knocked over, while the mind with a stand is difficult to knock over. \[21\]

“And what, bhikkhus, is the stand of the mind? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view ... right concentration. This is the stand of the mind.

“Bhikkhus, just as a pot ... so the mind without a stand is easily knocked over, while the mind with a stand is difficult to knock over.”
