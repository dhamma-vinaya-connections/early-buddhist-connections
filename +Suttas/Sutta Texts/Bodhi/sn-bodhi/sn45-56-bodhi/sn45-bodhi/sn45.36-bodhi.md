# SN45.36 Asceticism (2)

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you asceticism and the goal of asceticism. Listen to that….

“And what, bhikkhus, is asceticism? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view ... right concentration. This is called asceticism.

  
  

“And what, bhikkhus, is the goal of asceticism? The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion. This is called the goal of asceticism.”
