# SN45.172 Bonds

“Bhikkhus, there are these four bonds. What four? The bond of sensuality, the bond of existence, the bond of views, the bond of ignorance. These are the four bonds. This Noble Eightfold Path is to be developed for direct knowledge of these four bonds, for the full understanding of them, for their utter destruction, for their abandoning.”
