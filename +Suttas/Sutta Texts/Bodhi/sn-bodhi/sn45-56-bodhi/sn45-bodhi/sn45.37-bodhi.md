# SN45.37 Brahminhood (1)

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you brahminhood and the fruits of brahminhood. Listen to that….

“And what, bhikkhus, is brahminhood? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view ... right concentration. This is called brahminhood.

“And what, bhikkhus, are the fruits of brahminhood? \[26\] The fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of nonreturning, the fruit of arahantship. These are called the fruits of brahminhood.”
