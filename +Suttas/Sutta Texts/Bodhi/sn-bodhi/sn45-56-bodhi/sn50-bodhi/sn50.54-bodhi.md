# SN50.54 Higher Fetters

“Bhikkhus, there are these five higher fetters. What five? Lust for form, lust for the formless, conceit, restlessness, ignorance. These are the five higher fetters. The four right strivings are to be developed for direct knowledge of these five higher fetters, for the full understanding of them, for their utter destruction, for their abandoning.

“What four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu generates desire for the nonarising of unarisen evil unwholesome states … for the maintenance of arisen wholesome states, for their nondecay, increase, expansion, and fulfilment by development; \[248\] he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives.

“These four right strivings are to be developed for the direct knowledge of these five higher fetters, for the full understanding of them, for their utter destruction, for their abandoning.”

> Floods, bonds, kinds of clinging,  
>   
> Knots, and underlying tendencies,  
>   
> Cords of sensual pleasure, hindrances,  
>   
> Aggregates, fetters lower and higher.
