# SN46.25 Nondecline

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you seven things that lead to nondecline.  Listen to that…. \[86\]

“And what, bhikkhus, are the seven things that lead to nondecline? They are: the seven factors of enlightenment. What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness … the enlightenment factor of equanimity. These are the seven things that lead to nondecline.”
