# SN46.32 Wholesome (2)

“Bhikkhus, whatever states there are that are wholesome, partaking of the wholesome, pertaining to the wholesome, they are all rooted in careful attention, converge upon careful attention, and careful attention is declared to be the chief among them. When a bhikkhu is accomplished in careful attention, it is to be expected that he will develop and cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment.

“And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu who is accomplished in careful attention develop and cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment?…” (All as above.) \[92\]
