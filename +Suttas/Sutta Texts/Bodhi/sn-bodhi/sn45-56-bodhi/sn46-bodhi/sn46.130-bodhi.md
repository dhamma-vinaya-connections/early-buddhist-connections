# SN46.130 Higher Fetters

“Bhikkhus, there are these five higher fetters. What five? Lust for form, lust for the formless, conceit, restlessness, \[137\] ignorance. These are the five higher fetters. The seven factors of enlightenment are to be developed for direct knowledge of these five higher fetters, for the full understanding of them, for their utter destruction, for their abandoning.

“What seven? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness … he develops the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. These seven factors of enlightenment are to be developed for direct knowledge of these five higher fetters, for the full understanding of them, for their utter destruction, for their abandoning.”

> Floods, bonds, kinds of clinging,  
>   
> Knots, and underlying tendencies,  
>   
> Cords of sensual pleasure, hindrances,  
>   
> Aggregates, fetters lower and higher.
