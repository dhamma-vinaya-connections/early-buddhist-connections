# SN46.175-184 Floods, Etc.

“Bhikkhus, there are these five higher fetters. What five? Lust for form, lust for the formless, conceit, restlessness, ignorance. These are the five higher fetters. The five spiritual faculties are to be developed for direct knowledge of these five higher fetters, for the full understanding of them, for their utter destruction, for their abandoning.

“What five? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the faculty of faith … \[243\] … the faculty of wisdom, which has as its final goal the removal of lust, the removal of hatred, the removal of delusion.

“These five spiritual faculties are to be developed for direct knowledge of these five higher fetters, for the full understanding of them, for their utter destruction, for their abandoning.”

> Floods, bonds, kinds of clinging,  
>   
> Knots, and underlying tendencies,  
>   
> Cords of sensual pleasure, hindrances,  
>   
> Aggregates, fetters lower and higher.

(All to be elaborated by way of the five faculties having as their final goal the removal of lust, the removal of hatred, the removal of delusion.)
