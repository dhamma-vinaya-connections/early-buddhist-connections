# SN46.76 Cessation

(i. Of great fruit)

“Bhikkhus, when the perception of cessation is developed and cultivated, it is of great fruit and benefit.

“And how, bhikkhus, is the perception of cessation developed and cultivated so that it is of great fruit and benefit? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness accompanied by the perception of cessation … he develops the enlightenment factor of equanimity accompanied by the perception of cessation, based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. It is in this way that the perception of cessation is developed and cultivated so that it is of great fruit and benefit.”

  
  

(ii. One of two fruits)

“Bhikkhus, when the perception of cessation is developed and cultivated, one of two fruits is to be expected: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue of clinging, the state of nonreturning.

“And how, bhikkhus, is the perception of cessation developed…?”

  
  

(iii–vi. Great good, etc.)

“Bhikkhus, when the perception of cessation is developed and cultivated, it leads to great good … to great security from bondage … to a great sense of urgency … to dwelling in great comfort. \[134\]

“And how does it do so? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness accompanied by the perception of cessation … he develops the enlightenment factor of equanimity accompanied by the perception of cessation, based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. It is in this way that the perception of cessation is developed and cultivated so that it leads to great good … to great security from bondage … to a great sense of urgency … to dwelling in great comfort.”
