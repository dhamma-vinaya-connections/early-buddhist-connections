# SN46.131 The River Ganges—Eastward

“Bhikkhus, just as the river Ganges slants ... towards the east, so too a bhikkhu … inclines towards Nibbāna.

“And how does he do so? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness … he develops the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which has as its final goal the removal of lust, the removal of hatred, the removal of delusion. It is in this way that a bhikkhu … inclines towards Nibbāna.” \[138\]
