# SN46.17 Going Beyond

“Bhikkhus, these seven factors of enlightenment, when developed and cultivated, lead to going beyond from the near shore to the far shore. What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness … the enlightenment factor of equanimity. These seven factors of enlightenment, when developed and cultivated, lead to going beyond from the near shore to the far shore.” \[82\]

(The verses attached to this sutta are identical with those at 45:34 above.)
