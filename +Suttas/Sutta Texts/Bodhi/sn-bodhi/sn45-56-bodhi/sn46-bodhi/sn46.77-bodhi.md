# SN46.77-88 The River Ganges—Eastward, Etc.

“Bhikkhus, just as the river Ganges slants, slopes, and inclines towards the east, so too a bhikkhu who develops and cultivates the seven factors of enlightenment slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.

“And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu develop and cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment so that he slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness … he develops the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu develops and cultivates the seven factors of enlightenment so that he slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.”

  
  

(The remaining suttas of this vagga are to be similarly elaborated parallel to 45:92–102.) \[135\]

> Six about slanting to the east  
>   
> And six about slanting to the ocean.  
>   
> These two sixes make up twelve:  
>   
> Thus the subchapter is recited.
