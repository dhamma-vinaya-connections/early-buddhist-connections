# SN46.15 Ill (2)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Now on that occasion the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was dwelling on Mount Vulture Peak—sick, afflicted, gravely ill. Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and approached the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna … (all as above, with the change of names being the only difference) … In such a way the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was cured of his illness. \[81\]
