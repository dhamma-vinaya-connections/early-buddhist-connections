# SN47.50 Taints

“Bhikkhus, there are these three taints. What three? The taint of sensuality, the taint of existence, the taint of ignorance. \[190\] These are the three taints. The four establishments of mindfulness are to be developed for the full understanding of these three taints.

“What four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body … feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world.

“These four establishments of mindfulness, bhikkhus, are to be developed for the full understanding of these three taints.”
