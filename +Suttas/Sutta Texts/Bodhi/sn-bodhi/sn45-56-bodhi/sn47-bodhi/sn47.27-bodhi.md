# SN47.27 Completely

The same setting. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Anuruddha:

“Friend Anuruddha, it is said, ‘One beyond training, one beyond training.’ In what way, friend, is one beyond training?”

“It is, friend, because one has completely developed the four establishments of mindfulness that one is beyond training. What four?… (as above) … It is because one has completely developed these four establishments of mindfulness that one is beyond training.”
