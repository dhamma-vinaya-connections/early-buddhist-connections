# SN47.39 Development

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the development of the four establishments of mindfulness. Listen to that….

“What, bhikkhus, is the development of the four establishments of mindfulness? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, \[183\] ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. This, bhikkhus, is the development of the four establishments of mindfulness.”
