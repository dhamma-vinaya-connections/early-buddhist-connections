# SN47.31 Unheard Before

At Sāvatthī. “‘This is the contemplation of the body in the body’—thus, bhikkhus, \[179\] in regard to things unheard before, there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light.

  
  

“‘That contemplation of the body in the body is to be developed’ … ‘That contemplation of the body in the body has been developed’—thus, bhikkhus, in regard to things unheard before, there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light.

“‘This is the contemplation of feelings in feelings’ …

“‘This is the contemplation of mind in mind’ …

“‘This is the contemplation of phenomena in phenomena’—thus, bhikkhus, in regard to things unheard before, there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light.

“‘That contemplation of phenomena in phenomena is to be developed’ … ‘That contemplation of phenomena in phenomena has been developed’—thus, bhikkhus, in regard to things unheard before, there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light.”
