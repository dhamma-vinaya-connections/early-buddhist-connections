# SN49.35-44 Searches, Etc.

“Bhikkhus, there are these three searches. What three? The search for sensual pleasure, the search for existence, the search for a holy life. These are the three searches. \[247\] The four right strivings are to be developed for direct knowledge of these three searches, for the full understanding of them, for their utter destruction, for their abandoning.

“What four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu generates desire for the nonarising of unarisen evil unwholesome states … for the maintenance of arisen wholesome states, for their nondecay, increase, expansion, and fulfilment by development; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives.

“These four right strivings are to be developed for the direct knowledge of these three searches, for the full understanding of them, for their utter destruction, for their abandoning.”

  
  

(To be elaborated parallel to 45:161-70.)
