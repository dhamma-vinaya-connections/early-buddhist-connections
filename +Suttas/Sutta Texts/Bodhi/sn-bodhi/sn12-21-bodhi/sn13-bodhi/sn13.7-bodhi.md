# SN13.7 The Ocean (1)

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, suppose that a man would draw out two or three drops of water from the great ocean. What do you think, bhikkhus, which is more: the two or three drops of water that have been drawn out or the water in the great ocean?” \[137\]

“Venerable sir, the water in the great ocean is more. The two or three drops of water that have been drawn out are trifling. They do not amount to a hundredth part, or a thousandth part, or a hundred thousandth part of the water in the great ocean.”

“So too, bhikkhus, for a noble disciple … of such great benefit is it to obtain the vision of the Dhamma.”
