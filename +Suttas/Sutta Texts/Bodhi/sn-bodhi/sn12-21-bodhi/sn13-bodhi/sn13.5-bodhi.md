# SN13.5 The Earth (1)

At Sāvatthı̄. \[136\] “Bhikkhus, suppose that a man would place seven little balls of clay the size of jujube kernels on the great earth. What do you think, bhikkhus, which is more: those seven little balls of clay the size of jujube kernels that have been placed there or the great earth?”

“Venerable sir, the great earth is more. The seven little balls of clay the size of jujube kernels are trifling. They do not amount to a hundredth part, or a thousandth part, or a hundred thousandth part of the great earth.”

“So too, bhikkhus, for a noble disciple … of such great benefit is it to obtain the vision of the Dhamma.”
