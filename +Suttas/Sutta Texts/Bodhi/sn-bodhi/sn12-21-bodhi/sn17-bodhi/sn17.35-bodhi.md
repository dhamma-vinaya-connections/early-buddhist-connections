# SN17.35 Not Long After He Left

\[241\] On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling in Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak not long after Devadatta had left. There, with reference to Devadatta, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:

“Bhikkhus, Devadatta’s gain, honour, and praise arose to his own downfall and destruction. Just as a plantain tree, a bamboo, or a reed yields fruit to its own downfall and destruction, so Devadatta’s gain, honour, and praise arose to his own downfall and destruction. Just as a mule becomes pregnant to its own downfall and destruction, so Devadatta’s gain, honour, and praise arose to his own downfall and destruction. So dreadful, bhikkhus, are gain, honour, and praise…. Thus should you train yourselves.”

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

> “As its own fruit brings destruction  
>   
> To the plantain, bamboo, and reed,  
>   
> As its embryo destroys the mule,  
>   
> So do honours destroy the scoundrel.” \[242\]
