# SN12.47 Jāṇussoṇi

At Sāvatthı̄. Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to him:

“How is it, Master Gotama: does all exist?”

“‘All exists’: this, brahmin, is one extreme.”

“Then, Master Gotama, does all not exist?”

“‘All does not exist’: this, brahmin, is the second extreme. Without veering towards either of these extremes, the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma by the middle….”

When this was said, the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi said to the Blessed One: \[77\] “Magnificent, Master Gotama!… From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
