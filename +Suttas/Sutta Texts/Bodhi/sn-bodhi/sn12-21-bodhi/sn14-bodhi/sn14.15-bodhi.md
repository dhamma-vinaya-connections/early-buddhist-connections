# SN14.15 Walking Back and Forth

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Now on that occasion, not far from the Blessed One, the Venerable Sāriputta was walking back and forth with a number of bhikkhus; the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna … the Venerable Mahākassapa … the Venerable Anuruddha … the Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāniputta … the Venerable Upāli … the Venerable Ānanda was walking back and forth with a number of bhikkhus. And not far from the Blessed One, Devadatta too was walking back and forth with a number of bhikkhus.

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, do you see Sāriputta walking back and forth with a number of bhikkhus?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“All those bhikkhus are of great wisdom. Do you see Moggallāna walking back and forth with a number of bhikkhus?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“All those bhikkhus have great spiritual power. Do you see Kassapa walking back and forth with a number of bhikkhus?” \[156\]

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“All those bhikkhus are proponents of the ascetic practices. Do you see Anuruddha walking back and forth with a number of bhikkhus?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“All those bhikkhus possess the divine eye. Do you see Puṇṇa Mantāniputta walking back and forth with a number of bhikkhus?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“All those bhikkhus are speakers on the Dhamma. Do you see Upāli walking back and forth with a number of bhikkhus?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“All those bhikkhus are upholders of the Discipline. Do you see Ānanda walking back and forth with a number of bhikkhus?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“All those bhikkhus are highly learned. Do you see Devadatta walking back and forth with a number of bhikkhus?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“All those bhikkhus have evil wishes.

“Bhikkhus, it is by way of elements that beings come together and unite. Those of an inferior disposition come together and unite with those of an inferior disposition; those of a good disposition come together and unite with those of a good disposition. In the past they did so, in the future they will do so, \[157\] and now at present they do so too.”
