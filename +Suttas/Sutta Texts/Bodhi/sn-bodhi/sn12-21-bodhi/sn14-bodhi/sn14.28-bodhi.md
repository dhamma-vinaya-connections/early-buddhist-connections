# SN14.28 The Eightfold Path

© Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Bodhi.  (More copyright information)
1At Sāvatthī. "Bhikkhus, it is by way of elements that beings come together and unite. Those of wrong view come together and unite with those of wrong view; those of wrong intention … wrong speech … wrong action … wrong livelihood … wrong effort … wrong mindfulness … wrong concentration come together and unite with those of wrong concentration.

2"Those of right view come together and unite with those of right view; those of right intention … right speech … right action … right livelihood … right effort … right mindfulness … right concentration come together and unite with those of right concentration."
