# SN14.25 The Five Training Rules

1At Sāvatthī. "Bhikkhus, it is by way of elements that beings come together and unite. Those who destroy life come together and unite with those who destroy life; those who take what is not given … who engage in sexual misconduct … who speak falsehood … who indulge in wine, liquor, and intoxicants that cause negligence come together and unite with those who so indulge.

2"Those who abstain from the destruction of life come together and unite with those who abstain from the destruction of life; those who abstain from taking what is not given … from sexual misconduct … from false speech … from wine, liquor, and intoxicants that cause negligence come together and unite with those who so abstain."
