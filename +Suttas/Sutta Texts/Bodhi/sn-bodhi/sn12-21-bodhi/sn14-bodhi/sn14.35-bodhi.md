# SN14.35 Delight

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, one who seeks delight in the earth element seeks delight in suffering. One who seeks delight in suffering, I say, is not freed from suffering. One who seeks delight in the water element … in the heat element … in the air element seeks delight in suffering. One who seeks delight in suffering, I say, is not freed from suffering. \[175\]

“One who does not seek delight in the earth element ... in the air element does not seek delight in suffering. One who does not seek delight in suffering, I say, is freed from suffering.”
