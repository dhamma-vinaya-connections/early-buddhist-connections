# SN14.4 Diversity of Feelings (1)

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, it is in dependence on the diversity of elements that there arises the diversity of contacts; in dependence on the diversity of contacts that there arises the diversity of feelings.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of elements? \[142\] The eye element ... the mind element. This is called the diversity of elements.

“And how is it, bhikkhus, that in dependence on the diversity of elements there arises the diversity of contacts; that in dependence on the diversity of contacts there arises the diversity of feelings? In dependence on the eye element there arises eye-contact; in dependence on eye-contact there arises feeling born of eye-contact. In dependence on the ear element there arises ear-contact; in dependence on ear-contact there arises feeling born of ear-contact. In dependence on the nose element there arises nose-contact; in dependence on nose-contact there arises feeling born of nose-contact. In dependence on the tongue element there arises tongue-contact; in dependence on tongue-contact there arises feeling born of tongue-contact. In dependence on the body element there arises body-contact; in dependence on body-contact there arises feeling born of body-contact. In dependence on the mind element there arises mind-contact; in dependence on mind-contact there arises feeling born of mind-contact.

“It is in this way, bhikkhus, that in dependence on the diversity of elements there arises the diversity of contacts; that in dependence on the diversity of contacts there arises the diversity of feelings.”
