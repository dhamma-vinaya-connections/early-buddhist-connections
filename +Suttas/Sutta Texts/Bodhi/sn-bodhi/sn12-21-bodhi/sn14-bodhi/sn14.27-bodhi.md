# SN14.27 Ten Courses of Kamma

© Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Bodhi.  (More copyright information)
1At Sāvatthī. "Bhikkhus, it is by way of elements that beings come together and unite. Those who destroy life come together and unite with those who destroy life; those … as above, continuing:  … who are covetous … who bear ill will … of wrong view come together and unite with those of wrong view.

2"Those who abstain from the destruction of life … as above … who are uncovetous … without ill will … of right view come together and unite with those of right view."
