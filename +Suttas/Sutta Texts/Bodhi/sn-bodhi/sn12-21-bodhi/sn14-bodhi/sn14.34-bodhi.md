# SN14.34 Exclusively Suffering

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, if this earth element were exclusively suffering, immersed in suffering, steeped in suffering, and if it were not \[also\] steeped in pleasure, beings would not become enamoured with it. But because the earth element is pleasurable, immersed in pleasure, steeped in pleasure, and is not steeped \[only\] in suffering, beings become enamoured with it. \[174\]

“Bhikkhus, if this water element were exclusively suffering … if this heat element were exclusively suffering … if this air element were exclusively suffering, immersed in suffering, steeped in suffering, and if it was not \[also\] steeped in pleasure, beings would not become enamoured with it. But because the air element is pleasurable, immersed in pleasure, steeped in pleasure, and is not steeped \[only\] in suffering, beings become enamoured with it.

“Bhikkhus, if this earth element were exclusively pleasurable, immersed in pleasure, steeped in pleasure, and if it were not \[also\] steeped in suffering, beings would not experience revulsion towards it. But because the earth element is suffering, immersed in suffering, steeped in suffering, and is not steeped \[only\] in pleasure, beings experience revulsion towards it.

“Bhikkhus, if this water element were exclusively pleasurable … if this heat element were exclusively pleasurable … if this air element were exclusively pleasurable, immersed in pleasure, steeped in pleasure, and if it were not \[also\] steeped in suffering, beings would not experience revulsion towards it. But because the air element is suffering, immersed in suffering, steeped in suffering, and is not steeped \[only\] in pleasure, beings experience revulsion towards it.”
