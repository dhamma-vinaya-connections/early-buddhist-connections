# SN14.8 Not Diversity of Quests

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, it is in dependence on the diversity of elements that there arises the diversity of perceptions … (as in preceding sutta) ... in dependence on the diversity of passions that there arises the diversity of quests. The diversity of passions does not arise in dependence on the diversity of quests; \[145\] the diversity of desires does not arise in dependence on the diversity of passions; the diversity of intentions does not arise in dependence on the diversity of desires; the diversity of perceptions does not arise in dependence on the diversity of intentions; the diversity of elements does not arise in dependence on the diversity of perceptions.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of elements? The form element ... the mental-phenomena element. This, bhikkhus, is called the diversity of elements.

“And how is it, bhikkhus, that in dependence on the diversity of elements there arises the diversity of perceptions … that in dependence on the diversity of passions there arises the diversity of quests? That the diversity of passions does not arise in dependence on the diversity of quests ... that the diversity of elements does not arise in dependence on the diversity of perceptions?

“In dependence on the form element there arises perception of form; \[… in dependence on passion for form there arises the quest for form. Passion for form does not arise in dependence on the quest for form; desire for form does not arise in dependence on passion for form; intention regarding form does not arise in dependence on desire for form; perception of form does not arise in dependence on intention regarding form; the form element does not arise in dependence on perception of form.\] ... 

“In dependence on the mental-phenomena element there arises perception of mental phenomena; \[146\] … in dependence on passion for mental phenomena there arises the quest for mental phenomena. Passion for mental phenomena does not arise in dependence on the quest for mental phenomena … the mental-phenomena element does not arise in dependence on perception of mental phenomena.

“It is in this way, bhikkhus, that in dependence on the diversity of elements there arises the diversity of perceptions … that in dependence on the diversity of passions there arises the diversity of quests. That the diversity of passions does not arise in dependence on the diversity of quests ... that the diversity of elements does not arise in dependence on the diversity of perceptions.”
