# SN14.16 With Verses

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, it is by way of elements that beings come together and unite: those of an inferior disposition come together and unite with those of an inferior disposition. In the past they did so, in the future they will do so, and now at present they do so too.

“Just as excrement comes together and unites with excrement, urine with urine, spittle with spittle, pus with pus, and blood with blood, so too, bhikkhus, it is by way of elements that beings come together and unite: those of an inferior disposition come together and unite with those of an inferior disposition. In the past they did so, in the future they will do so, and now at present they do so too. \[158\]

“Bhikkhus, it is by way of elements that beings come together and unite: those of a good disposition come together and unite with those of a good disposition. In the past they did so, in the future they will do so, and now at present they do so too.

“Just as milk comes together and unites with milk, oil with oil, ghee with ghee, honey with honey, and molasses with molasses, so too, bhikkhus, it is by way of elements that beings come together and unite: those of a good disposition come together and unite with those of a good disposition. In the past they did so, in the future they will do so, and now at present they do so too.”

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

> “From association the woods of lust is born,  
>   
> By nonassociation the woods is cut.  
>   
> Just as one who has mounted a wooden plank  
>   
> Would sink upon the mighty sea,  
>   
> So one of virtuous living sinks  
>   
> By consorting with a lethargic person.
>

> 
> “Thus one should avoid such a person—  
>   
> One lethargic, devoid of energy.  
>   
> Keep company with the wise,  
>   
> With resolute meditators,  
>   
> With the noble ones who dwell secluded,  
>   
> Their energy constantly aroused.” \[159\]
