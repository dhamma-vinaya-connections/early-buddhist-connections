# SN14.2 Diversity of Contacts

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, it is in dependence on the diversity of elements that there arises the diversity of contacts. And what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of elements? The eye element, the ear element, the nose element, the tongue element, the body element, the mind element. This is called the diversity of elements.

“And how is it, bhikkhus, that in dependence on the diversity of elements there arises the diversity of contacts? In dependence on the eye element there arises eye-contact; in dependence on the ear element there arises ear-contact; in dependence on the nose element there arises nose-contact; \[141\] in dependence on the tongue element there arises tongue-contact; in dependence on the body element there arises body-contact; in dependence on the mind element there arises mind-contact. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that in dependence on the diversity of elements there arises the diversity of contacts.”
