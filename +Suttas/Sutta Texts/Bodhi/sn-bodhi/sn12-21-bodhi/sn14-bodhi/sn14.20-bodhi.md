# SN14.20 Rooted in those Unafraid of Wrongdoing

(i)

\[164\] “Bhikkhus, it is by way of elements that beings come together and unite. Those unafraid of wrongdoing come together and unite with those unafraid of wrongdoing, the unlearned with the unlearned, the unwise with the unwise. Those afraid of wrongdoing come together and unite with those afraid of wrongdoing, the learned with the learned, the wise with the wise. In the past it was so; in the future it will be so; and now too at present it is so.”

(The next two parts of this sutta substitute the following in the second place, instead of “the unlearned,” and “the learned”:)

> (ii) the lazy, the energetic;

> (iii) the muddle-minded, the mindful.
