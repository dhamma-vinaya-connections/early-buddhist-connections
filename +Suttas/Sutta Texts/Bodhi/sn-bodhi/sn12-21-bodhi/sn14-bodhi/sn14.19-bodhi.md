# SN14.19 Rooted in the Shameless

(i)

“Bhikkhus, it is by way of elements that beings come together and unite. The shameless come together and unite with the shameless, \[163\] those unafraid of wrongdoing with those unafraid of wrongdoing, the unwise with the unwise. Those having a sense of shame come together and unite with those having a sense of shame, those afraid of wrongdoing with those afraid of wrongdoing, the wise with the wise. \[In the past it was so; in the future it will be so; and now too at present it is so.\]” (The next three parts of this sutta substitute the following in the second place, instead of “those unafraid of wrongdoing,” and “those afraid of wrongdoing”:)

> (ii) the unlearned, the learned;

> (iii) the lazy, the energetic;

> (iv) the muddle-minded, the mindful.
