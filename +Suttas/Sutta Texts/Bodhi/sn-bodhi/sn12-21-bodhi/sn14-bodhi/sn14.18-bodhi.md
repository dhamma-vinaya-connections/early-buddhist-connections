# SN14.18 Rooted in those Lacking Faith

(i)

“Bhikkhus, it is by way of elements that beings come together and unite. \[161\] Those lacking faith come together and unite with those lacking faith, the shameless with the shameless, the unwise with the unwise. Those having faith come together and unite with those having faith, those having a sense of shame with those having a sense of shame, the wise with the wise. In the past it was so; in the future it will be so; and now too at present it is so.” (The next four parts of this sutta substitute the following in the second place, instead of “the shameless,” and “those having a sense of shame”:)

> (ii) those unafraid of wrongdoing, those afraid of wrongdoing;

> (iii) the unlearned, the learned; \[162\]

> (iv) the lazy, the energetic;

> (v) the muddle-minded, the mindful.
