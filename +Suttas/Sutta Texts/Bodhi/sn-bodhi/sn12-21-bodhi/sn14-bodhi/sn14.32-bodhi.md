# SN14.32 I Set Out

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, I set out seeking the gratification in the earth element. Whatever gratification there is in the earth element—that I discovered. I have clearly seen with wisdom just how far the gratification in the earth element extends.

“Bhikkhus, I set out seeking the danger in the earth element. Whatever danger there is in the earth element—that I discovered. I have clearly seen with wisdom just how far the danger in the earth element extends.

“Bhikkhus, I set out seeking the escape from the earth element. Whatever escape there is from the earth element—that I discovered. I have clearly seen with wisdom just how far the escape from the earth element extends.

“Bhikkhus, I set out seeking the gratification in … the danger in … the escape from the water element ... the heat element ... the air element. Whatever escape there is from the air element—that I discovered. I have clearly seen with wisdom just how far the escape from the earth element extends.

“So long, bhikkhus, as I did not directly know as they really are the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of these four elements ... (as above) \[172\] … devas and humans.

“The knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘Unshakable is my liberation of mind; this is my last birth; now there is no more renewed existence.’”
