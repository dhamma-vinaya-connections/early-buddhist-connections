# SN14.3 Not Diversity of Contacts

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, it is in dependence on the diversity of elements that there arises the diversity of contacts. The diversity of elements does not arise in dependence on the diversity of contacts.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of elements? The eye element … the mind element. This is called the diversity of elements.

“And how is it, bhikkhus, that in dependence on the diversity of elements there arises the diversity of contacts; that the diversity of elements does not arise in dependence on the diversity of contacts?

“In dependence on the eye element there arises eye-contact; the eye element does not arise in dependence on eye-contact…. In dependence on the mind element there arises mind-contact; the mind element does not arise in dependence on mind-contact. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that in dependence on the diversity of elements there arises the diversity of contacts; that the diversity of elements does not arise in dependence on the diversity of contacts.”
