# SN14.9 Diversity of External Contacts (1)

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, it is in dependence on the diversity of elements that there arises the diversity of perceptions; in dependence on the diversity of perceptions that there arises the diversity of intentions; in dependence on the diversity of intentions that there arises the diversity of contacts; in dependence on the diversity of contacts that there arises the diversity of feelings; in dependence on the diversity of feelings that there arises the diversity of desires; in dependence on the diversity of desires that there arises the diversity of passions; in dependence on the diversity of passions that there arises the diversity of quests; in dependence on the diversity of quests that there arises the diversity of gains.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of elements? The form element ... the mental-phenomena element. This, bhikkhus, is called the diversity of elements.

“And how is it, bhikkhus, that in dependence on the diversity of elements \[147\] there arises the diversity of perceptions … that in dependence on the diversity of quests there arises the diversity of gains?

“In dependence on the form element there arises perception of form; in dependence on perception of form there arises intention regarding form; in dependence on intention regarding form there arises contact with form; in dependence on contact with form there arises feeling born of contact with form; in dependence on feeling born of contact with form there arises desire for form; in dependence on desire for form there arises passion for form; in dependence on passion for form there arises the quest for form; in dependence on the quest for form there arises the gain of form….

“In dependence on the mental-phenomena element there arises perception of mental phenomena; in dependence on perception of mental phenomena there arises intention regarding mental phenomena … contact with mental phenomena … feeling born of contact with mental phenomena … desire for mental phenomena … passion for mental phenomena … the quest for mental phenomena; in dependence on the quest for mental phenomena there arises the gain of mental phenomena.

“It is in this way, bhikkhus, that in dependence on the diversity of elements there arises the diversity of perceptions … that in dependence on the diversity of quests there arises the diversity of gains.”
