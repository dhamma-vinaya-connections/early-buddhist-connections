# SN14.5 Diversity of Feelings (2)

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, it is in dependence on the diversity of elements that there arises the diversity of contacts; in dependence on the diversity of contacts that there arises the diversity of feelings. The diversity of contacts does not arise in dependence on the diversity of feelings; the diversity of elements does not arise in dependence on the diversity of contacts.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of elements? The eye element … the mind element. This is called the diversity of elements.

“And how is it, bhikkhus, that in dependence on the diversity of elements there arises the diversity of contacts; that in dependence on the diversity of contacts there arises the diversity of feelings? That the diversity of contacts does not arise in dependence on the diversity of feelings; that the diversity of elements does not arise in dependence on the diversity of contacts?

“In dependence on the eye element there arises eye-contact; in dependence on eye-contact there arises feeling born of eye-contact. Eye-contact does not arise in dependence on feeling born of eye-contact; \[143\] the eye element does not arise in dependence on eye-contact…. In dependence on the mind element there arises mind-contact; in dependence on mind-contact there arises feeling born of mind-contact. Mind-contact does not arise in dependence on feeling born of mind-contact; the mind element does not arise in dependence on mind-contact.

“It is in this way, bhikkhus, that in dependence on the diversity of elements there arises the diversity of contacts … the diversity of elements does not arise in dependence on the diversity of contacts.”
