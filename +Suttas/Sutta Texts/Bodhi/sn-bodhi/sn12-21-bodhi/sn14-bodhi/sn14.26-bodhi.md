# SN14.26 Seven Courses of Kamma

© Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Bodhi.  (More copyright information)
1At Sāvatthī. "Bhikkhus, it is by way of elements that beings come together and unite. Those who destroy life come together and unite with those who destroy life; those who take what is not given … who engage in sexual misconduct … who speak falsehood … who speak divisively … who speak harshly … who indulge in idle chatter come together and unite with those who so indulge.

2"Those who abstain from the destruction of life … from taking what is not given … from sexual misconduct … from false speech … from divisive speech … from harsh speech … from idle chatter come together and unite with those who so abstain."
