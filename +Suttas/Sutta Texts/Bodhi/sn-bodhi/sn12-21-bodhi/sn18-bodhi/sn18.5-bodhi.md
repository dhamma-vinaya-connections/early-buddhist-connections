# SN18.5 Feeling

… “What do you think, Rāhula, is feeling born of eye-contact ... feeling born of ear-contact ... feeling born of nose-contact … feeling born of tongue-contact … feeling born of body-contact ... feeling born of mind-contact permanent or impermanent?”–“Impermanent, venerable sir.”…

“Seeing thus, Rāhula, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards feeling born of eye-contact … revulsion towards feeling born of mind-contact. Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate…. He understands: ‘... there is no more for this state of being.’”
