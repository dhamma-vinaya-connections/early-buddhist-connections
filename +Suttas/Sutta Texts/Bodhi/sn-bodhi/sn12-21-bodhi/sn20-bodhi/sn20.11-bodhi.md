# SN20.11 The Jackal (1)

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, did you hear an old jackal howling at the flush of dawn?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“That old jackal is afflicted with a disease called mange. Yet he still goes wherever he wants, stands wherever he wants, sits wherever he wants, \[272\] lies down wherever he wants, and a cool breeze even blows upon him. It would be good for a certain person here claiming to be a follower of the Sakyan son if he were to experience even such a form of individual existence.

“Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will dwell diligently.’ Thus should you train yourselves.”
