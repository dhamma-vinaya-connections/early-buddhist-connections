# SN21.9 Tissa

At Sāvatthī. \[282\] Then the Venerable Tissa, the Blessed One’s paternal cousin, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side—miserable, sorrowful, with tears streaming down. Then the Blessed One said to him:

“Tissa, why are you sitting there, miserable, sorrowful, with tears streaming down?”

“Because, venerable sir, the bhikkhus have attacked me on all sides with sharp words.”

“That, Tissa, is because you admonish others but cannot bear being admonished yourself. Tissa, this is not proper for you, a clansman who has gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness, that you admonish others but cannot accept admonition in turn. This is proper for you, Tissa, a clansman who has gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness, that you admonish others and accept admonition in turn.”

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

> “Why are you angry? Don’t be angry!  
>   
> Nonanger is better for you, Tissa.  
>   
> It is to remove anger, conceit, and scorn,  
>   
> That the holy life is lived, O Tissa.”
