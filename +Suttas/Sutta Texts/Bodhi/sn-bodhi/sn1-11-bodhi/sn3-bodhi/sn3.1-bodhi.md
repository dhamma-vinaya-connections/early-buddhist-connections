# SN3.1 Young

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: “Does Master Gotama too claim, ‘I have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment’?”

“If, great king, one speaking rightly could say of anyone, ‘He has awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment,’ it is of me that one might rightly say this. For I, great king, have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment.”

“Master Gotama, even those ascetics and brahmins who are the heads of orders and companies, the teachers of companies, well known and famous founders of sects considered by the multitude to be holy men—that is, Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla,  Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Ajita Kesakambalī—even these, when I asked them whether they had awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment, did not claim to have done so. So why then should Master Gotama \[make such a claim\] when he is so young in years and has newly gone forth?” \[69\]

“There are four things, great king, that should not be despised and disparaged as ‘young.’ What four? A khattiya, great king, should not be despised and disparaged as ‘young’; a snake should not be despised and disparaged as ‘young’; a fire should not be despised and disparaged as ‘young’; and a bhikkhu should not be despised and disparaged as ‘young.’ These are the four.” 

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

> 374 “One should not despise as ‘young’  
>   
> A khattiya of noble birth,  
>   
> A high-born prince of glorious fame:  
>   
> A man should not disparage him.  
>   
> 375 For it may happen that this lord of men,  
>   
> This khattiya, shall gain the throne,  
>   
> And in his anger thrash one harshly  
>   
> With a royal punishment.  
>   
> Therefore guarding one’s own life,  
>   
> One should avoid him.

> 376 “One should not despise as ‘young’  
>   
> A serpent one may see by chance  
>   
> In the village or a forest:  
>   
> A man should not disparage it.  
>   
> 377 For as that fierce snake glides along,  
>   
> Manifesting in diverse shapes,  
>   
> It may attack and bite the fool,   
>   
> Whether a man or a woman.  
>   
> Therefore guarding one’s own life,  
>   
> One should avoid it.

> 378 “One should not despise as ‘young’  
>   
> A blazing fire that devours much,  
>   
> A conflagration with blackened trail:  
>   
> A man should not disparage it.  
>   
> 379 For if it gains a stock of fuel,  
>   
> Having become a conflagration,  
>   
> It may attack and burn the fool,  
>   
> Whether a man or a woman.  
>   
> Therefore guarding one’s own life,  
>   
> One should avoid it.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 380 “When a fire burns down a forest—  
>   
> That conflagration with blackened trail—  
>   
> The shoots there spring to life once more  
>   
> As the days and nights pass by.  
>   
> 381 But if a bhikkhu of perfect virtue   
>   
> Burns one with \[his virtue’s\] fire,  
>   
> One does not gain sons and cattle,  
>   
> Nor do one’s heirs acquire wealth.  
>   
> Childless and heirless they become,  
>   
> Like stumps of palmyra trees. \[70\]
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 382 “Therefore a person who is wise,  
>   
> Out of regard for his own good,  
>   
> Should always treat these properly:  
>   
> A fierce serpent and a blazing fire,  
>   
> A famous khattiya,  
>   
> And a bhikkhu of perfect virtue.”

When this was said, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent, venerable sir! The Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by the Blessed One, as though he were turning upright what had been turned upside down, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go for refuge to the Blessed One, and to the Dhamma, and to the Bhikkhu Saṅgha. From today let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
