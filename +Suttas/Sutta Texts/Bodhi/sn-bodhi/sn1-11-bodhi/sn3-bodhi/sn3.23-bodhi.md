# SN3.23 World

At Sāvatthī. Sitting to one side, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, how many things are there in the world which, when they arise, arise for one’s harm, suffering, and discomfort?” 

“There are, great king, three things in the world which, when they arise, arise for one’s harm, suffering, and discomfort. What are the three? Greed, hatred, and delusion. These are the three things in the world which, when they arise, arise for one’s harm, suffering, and discomfort.

> 433 “Greed, hatred, and delusion,  
>   
> Arisen from within oneself,  
>   
> Injure the person of evil mind  
>   
> As its own fruit destroys the reed.”
