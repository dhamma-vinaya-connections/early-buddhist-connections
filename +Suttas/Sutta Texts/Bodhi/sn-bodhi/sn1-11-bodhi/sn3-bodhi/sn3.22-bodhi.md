# SN3.22 Grandmother

At Sāvatthī. Then, in the middle of the day, King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One.… The Blessed One said to him as he was sitting to one side: \[97\] “Where are you coming from, great king, in the middle of the day?” 

“Venerable sir, my grandmother has died. She was old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage, 120 years from birth. Venerable sir, my grandmother was dear and beloved to me. If, venerable sir, by means of the elephant-gem I could have redeemed her from death, I would have given away even the elephant-gem so that she would not have died. If by means of the horse-gem I could have redeemed her from death ... If by a prize village I could have redeemed her from death ... If by means of the country I could have redeemed her from death, I would have given away even the country so that she would not have died.”

“All beings, great king, are subject to death, terminate in death, and cannot escape death.”

“It is wonderful, venerable sir! It is amazing, venerable sir! How well this has been stated by the Blessed One: ‘All beings, great king, are subject to death, terminate in death, and cannot escape death.’”

“So it is, great king! So it is, great king! All beings, great king, are subject to death, terminate in death, and cannot escape death.  Just as all the potter’s vessels, whether unbaked or baked, are subject to a breakup, terminate in their breakup, and cannot escape their breakup, so all beings are subject to death, terminate in death, and cannot escape death.

> Reaping the fruits of their merit and evil:

> The doers of evil go to hell,  
>   
> The doers of merit to a happy realm.
