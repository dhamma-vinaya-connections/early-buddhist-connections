# SN3.15 Battle (2)

\[84\] (Opening as in §14:)

In that battle King Pasenadi defeated King Ajātasattu and captured him alive. Then it occurred to King Pasenadi: “Although this King Ajātasattu of Magadha has transgressed against me while I have not transgressed against him, still, he is my nephew. Let me now confiscate all his elephant troops, all his cavalry, all his chariot troops,  and all his infantry, and let him go with nothing but his life.”

Then King Pasenadi confiscated all King Ajātasattu’s elephant troops, all his cavalry, all his chariot troops, and all his infantry, and let him go with nothing but his life.

Then, in the morning, a number of bhikkhus dressed and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. When they had walked for alms in Sāvatthī and had returned from their alms round, after the meal they approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported what had happened. \[85\] 

Then the Blessed One, having understood the meaning of this, on that occasion recited these verses:

> 405 “A man will go on plundering  
>   
> So long as it serves his ends,   
>   
> But when others plunder him,  
>   
> The plunderer is plundered.
> 
> >

> 
> 406 “The fool thinks fortune is on his side  
>   
> So long as his evil does not ripen,  
>   
> But when the evil ripens  
>   
> The fool incurs suffering.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 407 “The killer begets a killer,  
>   
> One who conquers, a conqueror.  
>   
> The abuser begets abuse,  
>   
> The reviler, one who reviles.  
>   
> Thus by the unfolding of kamma  
>   
> The plunderer is plundered.” \[86\]
