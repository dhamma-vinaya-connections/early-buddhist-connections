# SN3.9 Sacrifice

At Sāvatthī. Now on that occasion a great sacrifice had been set up for King Pasenadi of Kosala. Five hundred bulls, five hundred bullocks, five hundred heifers, \[76\] five hundred goats, and five hundred rams had been led to the pillar for the sacrifice. And his slaves, servants, and workers, spurred on by punishment and fear, were busy making the preparations, wailing with tearful faces.

Then, in the morning, a number of bhikkhus dressed and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. When they had walked for alms in Sāvatthī and had returned from their alms round, after the meal they approached the Blessed One,  paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: “Here, venerable sir, a great sacrifice has been set up for King Pasenadi of Kosala. Five hundred bulls ... have been led to the pillar for the sacrifice. And his slaves ... are busy making preparations, wailing with tearful faces.”

Then the Blessed One, having understood the meaning of this, on that occasion recited these verses:

> 393 “The horse sacrifice, human sacrifice,  
>   
> Sammāpāsa, vājapeyya, niraggaḷa:  
>   
> These great sacrifices, fraught with violence,  
>   
> Do not bring great fruit.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 394 “The great seers of right conduct  
>   
> Do not attend that sacrifice  
>   
> Where goats, sheep, and cattle  
>   
> Of various kinds are slain. 
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 395 “But when sacrifices free from violence  
>   
> Are always offered by family custom,  
>   
> Where no goats, sheep, or cattle  
>   
> Of various kinds are slain:  
>   
> The great seers of right conduct  
>   
> Attend a sacrifice like this.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 396 “The wise person should offer this,  
>   
> A sacrifice bringing great fruit.  
>   
> For one who makes such sacrifice  
>   
> It is indeed better, never worse.  
>   
> Such a sacrifice is truly vast  
>   
> And the devatās too are pleased.”
