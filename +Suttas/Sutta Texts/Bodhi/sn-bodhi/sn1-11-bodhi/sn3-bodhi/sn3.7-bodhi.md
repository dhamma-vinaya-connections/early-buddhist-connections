# SN3.7 The Judgement Hall

At Sāvatthī. Sitting to one side, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: “Here, venerable sir, when I am sitting in the judgement hall, I see even affluent khattiyas, affluent brahmins, and affluent householders—rich, with great wealth and property, with abundant gold and silver, abundant treasures and commodities, abundant wealth and grain—speaking deliberate lies for the sake of sensual pleasures, with sensual pleasures as the cause, on account of sensual pleasures. Then, venerable sir, it occurs to me: ‘I’ve had enough now with the judgement hall! Now it is Good Face who will be known by his judgements.’”

“So it is, great king! So it is, great king! Even affluent khattiyas, affluent brahmins, and affluent householders … speak deliberate lies for the sake of sensual pleasures, with sensual pleasures as the cause, on account of sensual pleasures. That will lead to their harm and suffering for a long time to come.

> 391 “Enamoured with their pleasures and wealth,  
>   
> Greedy, dazed by sensual pleasures,  
>   
> They do not realize they have gone too far  
>   
> Like fish that enter the net spread out.  
>   
> Afterwards the bitter fruit is theirs,   
>   
> For bad indeed is the result.” \[75\]
