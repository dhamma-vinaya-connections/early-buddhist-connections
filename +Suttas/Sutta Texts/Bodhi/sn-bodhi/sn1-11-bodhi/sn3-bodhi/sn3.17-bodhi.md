# SN3.17 Diligence (1)

At Sāvatthī. Sitting to one side, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: “Is there, venerable sir, one thing which secures both kinds of good, the good pertaining to the present life and that pertaining to the future life?”

“There is one thing, great king, which secures both kinds of good, the good pertaining to the present life and that pertaining to the future life.”

“But what, venerable sir, is that one thing?”

“Diligence, great king. Just as the footprints of all living beings that walk fit into the footprint of the elephant, and the elephant’s footprint is declared to be their chief by reason of its size, so diligence is the one  thing which secures both kinds of good, \[87\] the good pertaining to the present life and that pertaining to the future life.
