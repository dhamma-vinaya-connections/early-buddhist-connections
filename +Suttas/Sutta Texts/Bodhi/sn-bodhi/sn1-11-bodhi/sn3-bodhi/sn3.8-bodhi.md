# SN3.8 Mallikā

At Sāvatthī. Now on that occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala had gone together with Queen Mallikā to the upper terrace of the palace. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala said to Queen Mallikā: “Is there, Mallikā, anyone more dear to you than yourself?”

“There is no one, great king, more dear to me than myself. But is there anyone, great king, more dear to you than yourself?”

“For me too, Mallikā, there is no one more dear than myself.”

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala descended from the palace and approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and related to the Blessed One his conversation with Queen Mallikā. Then the Blessed One, having understood the meaning of this, on that occasion recited this verse: 

> 392 “Having traversed all quarters with the mind,  
>   
> One finds none anywhere dearer than oneself.  
>   
> Likewise, each person holds himself most dear;  
>   
> Hence one who loves himself should not harm others.”
