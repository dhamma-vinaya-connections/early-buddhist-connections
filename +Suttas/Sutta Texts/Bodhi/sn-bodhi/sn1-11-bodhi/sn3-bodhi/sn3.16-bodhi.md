# SN3.16 Daughter

At Sāvatthī. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Then a certain man approached King Pasenadi  and informed him in a whisper: “Sire, Queen Mallikā has given birth to a daughter.” When this was said, King Pasenadi was displeased.  Then the Blessed One, having understood that King Pasenadi was displeased, on that occasion recited these verses:

> 408 “A woman, O lord of the people,  
>   
> May turn out better than a man:  
>   
> She may be wise and virtuous,  
>   
> A devoted wife, revering her mother-in-law.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 409 “The son to whom she gives birth  
>   
> May become a hero, O lord of the land.  
>   
> The son of such a blessed woman  
>   
> May even rule the realm.”
