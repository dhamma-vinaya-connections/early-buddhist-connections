# SN3.2 A Person

At Sāvatthī. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

“Venerable sir, how many things are there which, when they arise within a person, arise for his harm, suffering, and discomfort?”

“There are, great king, three things which, when they arise within a person, arise for his harm, suffering, and discomfort. What are the three? Greed, hatred, and delusion. These are the three things which, when they arise within a person, arise for his harm, suffering, and discomfort.

> 383 “Greed, hatred, and delusion,  
>   
> Arisen from within oneself,  
>   
> Injure the person of evil mind   
>   
> As its own fruit destroys the reed.” \[71\]
