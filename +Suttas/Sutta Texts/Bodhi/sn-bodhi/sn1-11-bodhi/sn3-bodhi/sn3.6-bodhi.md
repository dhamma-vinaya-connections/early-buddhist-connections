# SN3.6 Few

At Sāvatthī. Sitting to one side, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: “Here, venerable sir, while I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind thus: ‘Few are those people in the world who,  when they obtain superior possessions, do not become intoxicated and negligent, yield to greed for sensual pleasures, and mistreat other beings. Far more numerous are those people in the world who, when they obtain superior possessions, become intoxicated and negligent, \[74\] yield to greed for sensual pleasures, and mistreat other beings.’”

“So it is, great king! So it is, great king!”

(The Buddha then repeats the entire statement of King Pasenadi and adds the following verse:)

> 390 “Enamoured with their pleasures and wealth,  
>   
> Greedy, dazed by sensual pleasures,  
>   
> They do not realize they have gone too far  
>   
> Like deer that enter the trap laid out.  
>   
> Afterwards the bitter fruit is theirs,  
>   
> For bad indeed is the result.”
