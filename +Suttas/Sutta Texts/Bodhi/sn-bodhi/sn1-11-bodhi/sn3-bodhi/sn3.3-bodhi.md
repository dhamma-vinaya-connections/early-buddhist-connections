# SN3.3 Aging and Death

At Sāvatthī. Sitting to one side, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, for one who has taken birth, is there anything other \[to expect\] than aging and death?”

“For one who has taken birth, great king, there is nothing other \[to expect\] than aging and death. Even in the case of those affluent khattiyas—rich, with great wealth and property, with abundant gold and silver, abundant treasures and commodities, abundant wealth and grain—because they have taken birth, there is nothing other \[to expect\] than aging and death. Even in the case of those affluent brahmins … affluent householders—rich ... with abundant wealth and grain—because they have taken birth, there is nothing other \[to expect\] than aging and death. Even in the case of those bhikkhus who are arahants, whose taints are destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden,  reached their own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, and are completely liberated through final knowledge: even for them this body is subject to breaking up, subject to being laid down.

> 384 “The beautiful chariots of kings wear out,  
>   
> This body too undergoes decay.  
>   
> But the Dhamma of the good does not decay:  
>   
> So the good proclaim along with the good.”
