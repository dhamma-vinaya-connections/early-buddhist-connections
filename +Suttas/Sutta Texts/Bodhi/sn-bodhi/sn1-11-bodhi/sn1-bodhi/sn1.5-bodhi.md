# SN1.5 How Many Must One Cut?

At Sāvatthī. Standing to one side, that devatā recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 7 “How many must one cut, how many abandon,  
>   
> And how many further must one develop?  
>   
> When a bhikkhu has surmounted how many ties  
>   
> Is he called a crosser of the flood?”

\[The Blessed One:\] 

> 8 “One must cut off five, abandon five,  
>   
> And must develop a further five.  
>   
> A bhikkhu who has surmounted five ties  
>   
> Is called a crosser of the flood.”
