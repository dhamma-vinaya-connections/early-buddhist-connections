# SN1.6 Awake

At Sāvatthī. Standing to one side, that devatā recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 9 “How many are asleep when \[others\] are awake?  
>   
> How many are awake when \[others\] sleep?  
>   
> By how many does one gather dust?  
>   
> By how many is one purified?”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 10 “Five are asleep when \[others\] are awake;  
>   
> Five are awake when \[others\] sleep.  
>   
> By five things one gathers dust,  
>   
> By five things one is purified.” \[4\]
