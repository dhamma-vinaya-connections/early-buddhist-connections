# SN1.17 Difficult to Practise

> 32 “The ascetic life is hard to practise  
>   
> And hard for the inept to endure,  
>   
> For many are the obstructions there  
>   
> In which the fool founders.”
> 
> 33 “How many days can one practise the ascetic life  
>   
> If one does not rein in one’s mind?  
>   
> One would founder with each step  
>   
> Under the control of one’s intentions.

> 34 “Drawing in the mind’s thoughts  
>   
> As a tortoise draws its limbs into its shell,   
>   
> Independent, not harassing others, fully quenched,  
>   
> A bhikkhu would not blame anyone.”
