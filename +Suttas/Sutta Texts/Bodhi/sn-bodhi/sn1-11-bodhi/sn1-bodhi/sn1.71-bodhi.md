# SN1.71 Having Slain

At Sāvatthī. Standing to one side, that devatā addressed the Blessed One in verse:

> 223 “Having slain what does one sleep soundly?  
>   
> Having slain what does one not sorrow?  
>   
> What is the one thing, O Gotama,  
>   
> Whose killing you approve?”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 224 “Having slain anger, one sleeps soundly;  
>   
> Having slain anger, one does not sorrow;  
>   
> The killing of anger, O devatā,  
>   
> With its poisoned root and honeyed tip:  
>   
> This is the killing the noble ones praise,  
>   
> For having slain that, one does not sorrow.”
