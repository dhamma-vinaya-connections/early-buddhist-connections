# SN1.7 Not Penetrated

At Sāvatthī. Standing to one side, that devatā recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 11 “Those who have not penetrated things,  
>   
> Who may be led into others’ doctrines,  
>   
> Fast asleep, they have not yet awakened:  
>   
> It is time for them to awaken.”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 12 “Those who have penetrated things well,  
>   
> Who cannot be led into others’ doctrines,  
>   
> Those awakened ones, having rightly known,  
>   
> Fare evenly amidst the uneven.”
