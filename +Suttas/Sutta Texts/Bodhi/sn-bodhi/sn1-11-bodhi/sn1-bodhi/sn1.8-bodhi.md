# SN1.8 Utterly Muddled

At Sāvatthī. Standing to one side, that devatā recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 13 “Those who are utterly muddled about things,  
>   
> Who may be led into others’ doctrines,   
>   
> Fast asleep, they have not yet awakened:  
>   
> It is time for them to awaken.”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 14 “Those who aren’t muddled about things,  
>   
> Who cannot be led into others’ doctrines,  
>   
> Those awakened ones, having rightly known,  
>   
> Fare evenly amidst the uneven.”
