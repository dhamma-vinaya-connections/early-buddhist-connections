# SN1.11 Nandana

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus!”

“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“Once in the past, bhikkhus, a certain devatā of the Tāvatiṃsa host was revelling in Nandana Grove, < 11 > supplied and endowed with the five cords of celestial sensual pleasure, accompanied by a retinue of celestial nymphs. On that occasion he spoke this verse:

> 20 “‘They do not know bliss  
>   
> Who have not seen Nandana,  
>   
> The abode of the glorious male devas  
>   
> Belonging to the host of Thirty.’ \[6\]

“When this was said, bhikkhus, a certain devatā replied to that devatā in verse:

> 21 “‘Don’t you know, you fool,  
>   
> That maxim of the arahants?  
>   
> Impermanent are all formations;  
>   
> Their nature is to arise and vanish.  
>   
> Having arisen, they cease:  
>   
> Their appeasement is blissful.’”
