# SN1.36 Faith

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, when the night had advanced, a number of devatās belonging to the Satullapa host, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side.

Then one devatā, standing to one side, recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 117 “Faith is a person’s partner;  
>   
> If lack of faith does not persist,  
>   
> Fame and renown thereby come to him,   
>   
> And he goes to heaven on leaving the body.”

Then another devatā recited these verses in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 118 “One should discard anger, cast off conceit,  
>   
> Transcend all the fetters.  
>   
> No ties torment one who has nothing,  
>   
> Who does not adhere to name-and-form.”

\[Another devatā:\]

> 119 “Foolish people devoid of wisdom  
>   
> Devote themselves to negligence.  
>   
> But the wise man guards diligence  
>   
> As his foremost treasure.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 120 “Do not yield to negligence,  
>   
> Don’t be intimate with sensual delight.  
>   
> For the diligent ones, meditating,  
>   
> Attain supreme happiness.” \[26\]
