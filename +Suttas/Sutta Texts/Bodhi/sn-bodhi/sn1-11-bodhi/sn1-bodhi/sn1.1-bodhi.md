# SN1.1 Crossing the Flood

1Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Then, when the night had advanced, a certain devata of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, stood to one side, and said to him:

"How, dear sir, did you cross the flood?"

"By not halting, friend, and by not straining I crossed the flood."



"But how is it, dear sir, that by not halting and by not straining you crossed the flood?"

"When I came to a standstill, friend, then I sank; but when I struggled, then I got swept away. It is in this way, friend, that by not halting and by not straining I crossed the flood."

The devata:

2v.1 "After a long time at last I see
A brahmin who is fully quenched,
Who by not halting, not straining,
Has crossed over attachment to the world."

3This is what that devata said. The Teacher approved. Then that devata, thinking, "The Teacher has approved of me," paid homage to the Blessed One and, keeping him on the right, disappeared right there.
