# SN1.21 A Sword

At Sāvatthī. Standing to one side, that devatā recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 51 “As if smitten by a sword,  
>   
> As if his head were on fire,  
>   
> A bhikkhu should wander mindfully  
>   
> To abandon sensual lust.”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 52 “As if smitten by a sword,  
>   
> As if his head were on fire,  
>   
> A bhikkhu should wander mindfully  
>   
> To abandon identity view.”
