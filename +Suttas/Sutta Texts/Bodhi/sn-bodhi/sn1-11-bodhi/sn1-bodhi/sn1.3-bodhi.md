# SN1.3 Reaching

© Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Bodhi.  (More copyright information)
1At Sāvatthī. Standing to one side, that devata recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

2v.3 "Life is swept along, short is the life span;
No shelters exist for one who has reached old age.
Seeing clearly this danger in death,
One should do deeds of merit that bring happiness."

The Blessed One:

3v.4 "Life is swept along, short is the life span;
No shelters exist for one who has reached old age.
Seeing clearly this danger in death,
A seeker of peace should drop the world's bait."
