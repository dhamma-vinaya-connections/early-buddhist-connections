# SN1.12 Delight

At Sāvatthī. Standing to one side, that devatā recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One: 

> 22 “One who has sons delights in sons,  
>   
> One with cattle delights in cattle.  
>   
> Acquisitions truly are a man’s delight;  
>   
> Without acquisitions one does not delight.”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 23 “One who has sons sorrows over sons,  
>   
> One with cattle sorrows over cattle.  
>   
> Acquisitions truly are a man’s sorrows;  
>   
> Without acquisitions one does not sorrow.”
