# SN9.5 Ānanda

On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling among the Kosalans in a certain woodland thicket. Now on that occasion the Venerable Ānanda was excessively involved instructing lay people.  Then the devatā that inhabited that woodland thicket, having compassion for the Venerable Ānanda, desiring his good, desiring to stir up a sense of urgency in him, approached him and addressed him in verse:

> 772 “Having entered the thicket at the foot of a tree,  
>   
> Having placed Nibbāna in your heart, \[200\]  
>   
> Meditate, Gotama, and don’t be negligent!  
>   
> What will this hullabaloo do for you?”

Then the Venerable Ānanda, stirred up by that deity, acquired a sense of urgency.
