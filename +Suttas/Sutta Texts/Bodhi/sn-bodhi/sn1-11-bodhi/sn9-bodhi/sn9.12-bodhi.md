# SN9.12 Noon

On one occasion a certain bhikkhu was dwelling among the Kosalans in a certain woodland thicket. Then the devatā that inhabited that woodland thicket  approached that bhikkhu and recited this verse in his presence:

> 789 “When the noon hour sets in  
>   
> And the birds have settled down,  
>   
> The mighty forest itself murmurs:  
>   
> How fearful that appears to me!”

\[The bhikkhu:\]

> 790 “When the noon hour sets in  
>   
> And the birds have settled down,  
>   
> The mighty forest itself murmurs:  
>   
> How delightful that appears to me!”
