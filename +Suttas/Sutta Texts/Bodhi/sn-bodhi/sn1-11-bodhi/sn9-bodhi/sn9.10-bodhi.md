# SN9.10 Reciting

On one occasion a certain bhikkhu was dwelling among the Kosalans in a certain woodland thicket. Now on that occasion that bhikkhu had been excessively engrossed in recitation, but on a later occasion he passed the time living at ease and keeping silent. Then the devatā that inhabited that woodland thicket, no longer hearing that bhikkhu recite the Dhamma,  approached him and addressed him in verse:

> 785 “Bhikkhu, why don’t you recite Dhamma-stanzas,  
>   
> Living in communion with other bhikkhus?  
>   
> Hearing the Dhamma, one gains confidence;  
>   
> In this very life \[the reciter\] gains praise.”

\[The bhikkhu:\]

> 786 “In the past I was fond of Dhamma-stanzas  
>   
> So long as I had not achieved dispassion. \[203\]  
>   
> But from the time I achieved dispassion  
>   
> \[I dwell in what\] the good men call  
>   
> ‘The laying down by final knowledge  
>   
> Of whatever is seen, heard, or sensed.”’
