# SN9.6 Anuruddha

On one occasion the Venerable Anuruddha was dwelling among the Kosalans in a certain woodland thicket. Then a certain devatā of the Tāvatiṃsa host named Jālinī, a former consort of the Venerable Anuruddha, approached him and addressed him in verse:

> 773 “Direct your mind there \[to that realm\]  
>   
> Where you dwelt in the past  
>   
> Among the Tāvatiṃsa devas   
>   
> For whom all desires are fulfilled.  
>   
> You will shine forth highly honoured,  
>   
> Surrounded by celestial maidens.”

\[Anuruddha:\]

> 774 “Miserable are celestial maidens  
>   
> Established in identity,  
>   
> And miserable too are those beings  
>   
> Attached to celestial maidens.”

\[Jālinī:\]

> 775 “They do not know bliss  
>   
> Who have not seen Nandana,  
>   
> The abode of the glorious male devas  
>   
> Belonging to the host of Thirty.”

\[Anuruddha:\]

> 776 “Don’t you know, you fool,  
>   
> That maxim of the arahants?  
>   
> Impermanent are all formations;  
>   
> Their nature is to arise and vanish.  
>   
> Having arisen, they cease:  
>   
> Their appeasement is blissful.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 777 “Now I will never again dwell   
>   
> Among the deva host, Jālinī!  
>   
> The wandering on in birth is ended:  
>   
> Now there is no more renewed existence.”
