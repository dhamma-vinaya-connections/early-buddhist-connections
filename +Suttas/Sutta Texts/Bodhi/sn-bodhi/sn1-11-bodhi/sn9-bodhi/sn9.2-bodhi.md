# SN9.2 Rousing

On one occasion a certain bhikkhu was dwelling among the Kosalans in a certain woodland thicket. \[198\] Now on that occasion when that bhikkhu had gone for his day’s abiding he fell asleep. Then the devatā that inhabited that woodland thicket, having compassion for that bhikkhu, desiring his good, desiring to stir up a sense of urgency in him, approached him and addressed him in verses:

> 761 “Get up, bhikkhu, why lie down?   
>   
> What need do you have for sleep?  
>   
> What slumber \[can there be\] for one afflicted,  
>   
> Stricken, pierced by the dart?
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 762 “Nurture in yourself that faith  
>   
> With which you left behind the home life  
>   
> And went forth into homelessness:  
>   
> Don’t come under sloth’s control.”

\[The bhikkhu:\]

> 763 “Sensual pleasures are impermanent, unstable,  
>   
> Though the dullard is enthralled with them.  
>   
> When he’s free, detached among those bound,  
>   
> Why trouble one gone forth?
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 764 “When, by the removal of desire and lust  
>   
> And the transcendence of ignorance,  
>   
> That knowledge has been cleansed,  
>   
> Why trouble one gone forth? 
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 765 “When, by breaking ignorance with knowledge  
>   
> And by destruction of the taints,  
>   
> He is sorrowless, beyond despair,  
>   
> Why trouble one gone forth?
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 766 “When he is energetic and resolute,  
>   
> Always firm in his exertion,  
>   
> Aspiring to attain Nibbāna,  
>   
> Why trouble one gone forth?”
