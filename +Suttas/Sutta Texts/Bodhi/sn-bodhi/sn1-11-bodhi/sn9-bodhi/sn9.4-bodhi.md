# SN9.4 A Number

On one occasion a number of bhikkhus were dwelling among the Kosalans in a certain woodland thicket. Then, when they had spent the rains there, after the three months had passed those bhikkhus set out on tour.  Then the devatā that inhabited that woodland thicket, not seeing those bhikkhus, lamenting, on that occasion recited this verse:

> 770 “Today discontent appears to me  
>   
> When I see here so many vacant seats.  
>   
> Where have they gone, Gotama’s disciples,  
>   
> Those splendid speakers rich in learning?”

When this was said, another devatā replied in verse:

> 771 “They’ve gone to Magadha, gone to Kosala,  
>   
> And some are in the Vajjian land.  
>   
> Like deer that roam free from ties,  
>   
> The bhikkhus dwell without abode.”
