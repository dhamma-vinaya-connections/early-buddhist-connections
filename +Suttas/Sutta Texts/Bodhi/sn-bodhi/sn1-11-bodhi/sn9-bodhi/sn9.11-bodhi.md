# SN9.11 Unwholesome Thoughts

On one occasion a certain bhikkhu was dwelling among the Kosalans in a certain woodland thicket. Now on that occasion, when that bhikkhu had gone for the day’s abiding, he kept on thinking evil unwholesome thoughts, that is, thoughts of sensuality, ill will, and harming.  Then the devatā that inhabited that woodland thicket, having compassion for that bhikkhu, desiring his good, desiring to stir up a sense of urgency in him, approached him and addressed him in verses:

> 787 “Because of attending carelessly,  
>   
> You, sir, are eaten by your thoughts.  
>   
> Having relinquished the careless way,  
>   
> You should reflect carefully.
> 
> >

> 788 “By basing your thoughts on the Teacher,  
>   
> On Dhamma, Saṅgha, and your own virtues,  
>   
> You will surely attain to gladness,  
>   
> And rapture and happiness as well.  
>   
> Then when you are suffused with gladness,  
>   
> You’ll make an end to suffering.”

Then that bhikkhu, stirred up by that devatā, acquired a sense of urgency.
