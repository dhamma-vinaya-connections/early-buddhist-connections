# SN9.7 Nāgadatta

On one occasion the Venerable Nāgadatta was dwelling among the Kosalans in a certain woodland thicket. Now on that occasion the Venerable Nāgadatta had been entering the village too early and returning too late in the day. Then the devatā that inhabited that woodland thicket, having compassion for the Venerable Nāgadatta, desiring his good, desiring to stir up a sense of urgency in him, \[201\] approached him and addressed him in verses:

> 778 “Entering the village early,  
>   
> Returning late in the day,  
>   
> Nāgadatta associates too closely with lay folk,  
>   
> Sharing their happiness and suffering.
> 
> >

> 779 “I am afraid for Nāgadatta,  
>   
> So impudent, bound to families.  
>   
> Do not come under the End-maker’s control,   
>   
> \[In the grip\] of the powerful King of Death.”

Then the Venerable Nāgadatta, stirred up by that deity, acquired a sense of urgency.
