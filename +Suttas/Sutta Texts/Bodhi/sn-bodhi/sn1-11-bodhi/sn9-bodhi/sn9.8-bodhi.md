# SN9.8 Family Mistress

On one occasion a certain bhikkhu was dwelling among the Kosalans in a certain woodland thicket. Now on that occasion that bhikkhu had become excessively intimate with a certain family. Then the devatā that inhabited that woodland thicket, having compassion for that bhikkhu, desiring his good, desiring to stir up a sense of urgency in him, manifested herself in the form of the mistress of that family. Having approached that bhikkhu, she addressed him in verse:

> 780 “By the riverbanks and in the rest house,  
>   
> In the meeting halls and along the roads,  
>   
> People meet and gossip about this:  
>   
> What’s going on between you and me?”

\[The bhikkhu:\]

> 781 “There are many disagreeable sounds   
>   
> That an ascetic must patiently endure.  
>   
> One should not be dismayed because of that,  
>   
> For it is not by this one is defiled.
> 
> >

> 782 “If one is frightened by random sounds  
>   
> Like an antelope dwelling in the woods,  
>   
> They call him ‘one with a fickle mind’:  
>   
> His practice does not succeed.”
