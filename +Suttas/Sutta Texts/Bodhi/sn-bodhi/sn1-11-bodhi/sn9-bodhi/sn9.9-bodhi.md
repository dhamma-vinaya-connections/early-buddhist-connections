# SN9.9 Vajjian Prince (or Vesālī)

On one occasion a certain bhikkhu, a Vajjian prince, was dwelling at Vesālī in a certain woodland thicket. Now on that occasion an all-night festival was being held in Vesālī. \[202\] Then that bhikkhu, lamenting as he heard the clamour of instruments, gongs, and music coming from Vesālī, on that occasion recited this verse:

> 783 “We dwell in the forest all alone  
>   
> Like a log rejected in the woods.  
>   
> On such a splendid night as this   
>   
> Who is there worse off than us?”

Then the devatā that inhabited that woodland thicket, having compassion for that bhikkhu, desiring his good, desiring to stir up a sense of urgency in him, approached him and addressed him in verse:

> 784 “As you dwell in the forest all alone  
>   
> Like a log rejected in the woods,  
>   
> Many are those who envy you,  
>   
> As hell-beings envy those going to heaven.”

Then that bhikkhu, stirred up by that devatā, acquired a sense of urgency.
