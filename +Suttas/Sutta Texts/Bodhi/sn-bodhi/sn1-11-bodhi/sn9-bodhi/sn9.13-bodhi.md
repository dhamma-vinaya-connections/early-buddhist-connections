# SN9.13 Loose in Sense Faculties

On one occasion a number of bhikkhus were dwelling among the Kosalans in a certain woodland thicket. They were restless, puffed up, personally vain, rough-tongued, \[204\] rambling in their talk, muddle-minded, without clear comprehension, unconcentrated, scatter-brained, loose in their sense faculties. Then the devatā that inhabited that woodland thicket, having compassion for those bhikkhus, desiring their good,  desiring to stir up a sense of urgency in them, approached them and addressed them with verses:

> 791 “In the past the bhikkhus lived happily,  
>   
> The disciples of Gotama.  
>   
> Without wishes they sought their alms,  
>   
> Without wishes they used their lodgings.  
>   
> Having known the world’s impermanence,  
>   
> They made an end to suffering.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 792 “But now like headmen in a village  
>   
> They make themselves hard to maintain.  
>   
> They eat and eat and then lie down,  
>   
> Infatuated in others’ homes.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 793 “Having reverently saluted the Saṅgha,  
>   
> I here speak only about some:  
>   
> They are rejected, without protector,  
>   
> Become just like the dead.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 794 “My statement is made with reference  
>   
> To those who dwell in negligence.  
>   
> As for those who dwell in diligence,  
>   
> To them I humbly pay homage.”

Then those bhikkhus, stirred up by that devatā, acquired a sense of urgency.
