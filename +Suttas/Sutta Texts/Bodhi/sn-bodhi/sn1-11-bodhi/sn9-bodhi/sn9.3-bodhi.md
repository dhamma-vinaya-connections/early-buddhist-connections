# SN9.3 Kassapagotta

On one occasion the Venerable Kassapagotta was dwelling among the Kosalans in a certain woodland thicket. Now on that occasion, when he had gone for his day’s abiding, the Venerable Kassapagotta exhorted a certain hunter. Then the devatā that inhabited that woodland thicket, having compassion for the Venerable Kassapagotta, desiring his good, desiring to stir up a sense of urgency in him, approached him and addressed him in verses:

> 767 “The bhikkhu strikes me as a dolt   
>   
> Who out of season exhorts a hunter  
>   
> Roaming in the rugged mountains  
>   
> With little wisdom, devoid of sense.
> 
> >

> 
> 768 “He listens but does not understand,  
>   
> He looks but does not see;  
>   
> Though the Dhamma is being spoken,  
>   
> The fool does not grasp the meaning. \[199\]
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 769 “Even if you would bring ten lamps  
>   
> \[Into his presence\], Kassapa,  
>   
> Still he would not see forms,  
>   
> For he does not have eyes to see.”

Then the Venerable Kassapagotta, stirred up by that devatā, acquired a sense of urgency.
