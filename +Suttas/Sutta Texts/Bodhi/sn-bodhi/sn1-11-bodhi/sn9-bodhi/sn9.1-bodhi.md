# SN9.1 Seclusion

Thus have I heard. On one occasion a certain bhikkhu was dwelling among the Kosalans in a certain woodland thicket. Now on that occasion, while that bhikkhu had gone for his day’s abiding, he kept on thinking evil unwholesome thoughts connected with the household life.

Then the devatā that inhabited that woodland thicket, having compassion for that bhikkhu, desiring his good, desiring to stir up a sense of urgency in him, approached him and addressed him in verses:

> 758 “Desiring seclusion you entered the woods,  
>   
> Yet your mind gushes outwardly.  
>   
> Remove, man, the desire for people;  
>   
> Then you’ll be happy, devoid of lust.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 759 “You must abandon discontent, be mindful—  
>   
> Let us remind \[you\] of that \[way\] of the good.   
>   
> Hard to cross, indeed, is the dusty abyss;  
>   
> Don’t let sensual dust drag you down.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 760 “Just as a bird littered with soil  
>   
> With a shake flicks off the sticky dust,  
>   
> So a bhikkhu, strenuous and mindful,  
>   
> With a shake flicks off the sticky dust.”

Then that bhikkhu, stirred up by that devatā, acquired a sense of urgency.
