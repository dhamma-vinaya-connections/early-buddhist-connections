# SN9.14 The Thief of Scent

On one occasion a certain bhikkhu was dwelling among the Kosalans in a certain woodland thicket. Now on that occasion, when he had returned from his alms round, after his meal that bhikkhu used to descend into a pond and sniff a red lotus. Then the devatā that inhabited that woodland thicket, having compassion for that bhikkhu, desiring his good, desiring to stir up a sense of urgency in him, approached him and addressed him in verse:

> 795 “When you sniff this lotus flower,  
>   
> An item that has not been given,  
>   
> This is one factor of theft:  
>   
> You, dear sir, are a thief of scent.”

\[The bhikkhu:\]

> 796 “I do not take, I do not damage,  
>   
> I sniff the lotus from afar;  
>   
> So for what reason do you say  
>   
> That I am a thief of scent?
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 797 “One who digs up the lotus stalks,  
>   
> One who damages the flowers,  
>   
> One of such rough behaviour:   
>   
> Why is he not spoken to?” \[205\]

\[The devatā:\]

> 798 “When a person is rough and fierce,  
>   
> Badly soiled like a nursing cloth,  
>   
> I have nothing to say to him;  
>   
> But it’s to you that I ought to speak.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 799 “For a person without blemish,  
>   
> Always in quest of purity,  
>   
> Even a mere hair’s tip of evil  
>   
> Appears as big as a cloud.”

\[The bhikkhu:\]

> 800 “Surely, spirit, you understand me,  
>   
> And you have compassion for me.  
>   
> Please, O spirit, speak to me again,  
>   
> Whenever you see such a deed.”

\[The devatā:\]

> 801 “We don’t live with your support,  
>   
> Nor are we your hired servant.  
>   
> You, bhikkhu, should know for yourself   
>   
> The way to a good destination.”

Then that bhikkhu, stirred by that devatā, acquired a sense of urgency.
