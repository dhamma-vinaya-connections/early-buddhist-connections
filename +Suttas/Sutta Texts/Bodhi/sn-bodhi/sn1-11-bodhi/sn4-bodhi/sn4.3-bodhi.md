# SN4.3 Beautiful

While dwelling at Uruvelā. Now on that occasion the Blessed One was sitting out in the open air in the thick darkness of the night while it was drizzling. Then Māra the Evil One, wishing to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in the Blessed One, approached the Blessed One and, not far from him, displayed diverse lustrous shapes, both beautiful and hideous. Then the Blessed One, having understood, “This is Māra the Evil One,” addressed him in verses:

> 450 “You’ve wandered on through the long course  
>   
> Creating beautiful and hideous shapes.  
>   
> Enough, Evil One, with that trick of yours:  
>   
> You’re defeated, End-maker!
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 451 “Those who are well restrained  
>   
> In body, speech, and mind,  
>   
> Do not come under Māra’s control  
>   
> Nor become Māra’s henchmen.”

Then Māra the Evil One … disappeared right there. \[105\]
