# SN4.14 Suitable

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Kosalans at the brahmin village of Ekasālā. Now on that occasion the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople.

Then it occurred to Māra the Evil One: “This ascetic Gotama is teaching the Dhamma while surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople.  Let me approach the ascetic Gotama in order to confound them.”

Then Māra the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:

> 474 “This is not suitable for you,  
>   
> That you instruct others.  
>   
> When so engaged don’t get caught  
>   
> In attraction and repulsion.”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 475 “Compassionate for their welfare,  
>   
> The Buddha instructs others.  
>   
> The Tathāgata is fully released  
>   
> From attraction and repulsion.”

Then Māra the Evil One … disappeared right there.
