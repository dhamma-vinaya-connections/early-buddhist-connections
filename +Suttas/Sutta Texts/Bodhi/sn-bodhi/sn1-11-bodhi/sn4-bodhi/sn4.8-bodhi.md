# SN4.8 He Delights

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

Then Māra the Evil One approached the Blessed One and recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 461 “One who has sons delights in sons,  
>   
> One with cattle delights in cattle. \[108\]   
>   
> Acquisitions truly are a man’s delight;  
>   
> Without acquisitions one does not delight.”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 462 “One who has sons sorrows over sons,  
>   
> One with cattle sorrows over cattle.  
>   
> Acquisitions truly are a man’s sorrow;  
>   
> Without acquisitions one does not sorrow.”

Then Māra the Evil One … disappeared right there.
