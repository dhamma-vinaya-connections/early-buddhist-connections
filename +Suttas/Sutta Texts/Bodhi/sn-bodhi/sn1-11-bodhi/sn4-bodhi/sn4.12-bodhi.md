# SN4.12 Lion

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now on that occasion the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma while surrounded by a large assembly. \[110\]

Then it occurred to Māra the Evil One: “This ascetic Gotama is teaching the Dhamma while surrounded by a large assembly.  Let me approach the ascetic Gotama in order to confound them.”

Then Māra the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:

> 468 “Why now do you roar like a lion,  
>   
> Confident in the assembly?  
>   
> For there is one who’s a match for you,  
>   
> So why think yourself the victor?”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 469 “The great heroes roar their lion’s roar  
>   
> Confident in the assemblies—  
>   
> The Tathāgatas endowed with the powers  
>   
> Have crossed over attachment to the world.”

Then Māra the Evil One … disappeared right there.
