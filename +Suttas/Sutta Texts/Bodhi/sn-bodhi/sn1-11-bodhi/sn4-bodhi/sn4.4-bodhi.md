# SN4.4 Māra’s Snare (1)

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus!”

“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“Bhikkhus, by careful attention, by careful right striving, I have arrived at unsurpassed liberation, I have realized unsurpassed liberation. You too, bhikkhus, by careful attention, by careful right striving, must arrive at unsurpassed liberation, must realize unsurpassed liberation.”

Then Māra the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:

> 452 “You are bound by Māra’s snare  
>   
> Both celestial and human;  
>   
> You are bound by Māra’s bondage:  
>   
> You won’t escape me, ascetic!”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 453 “I am freed from Māra’s snare  
>   
> Both celestial and human;  
>   
> I am freed from Māra’s bondage:   
>   
> You’re defeated, End-maker!”

Then Māra the Evil One … disappeared right there.
