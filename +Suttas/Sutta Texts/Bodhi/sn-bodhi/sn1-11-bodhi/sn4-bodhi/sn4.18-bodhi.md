# SN4.18 Alms

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Magadhans at the brahmin village of Pañcasālā. \[114\] Now on that occasion the gift-festival of the young people was being held at the brahmin village of Pañcasālā.  Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed and, taking bowl and robe, entered Pañcasālā for alms. Now on that occasion Māra the Evil One had taken possession of the brahmin householders of Pañcasālā, \[inciting in them the thought,\] “Don’t let the ascetic Gotama get alms.”

Then the Blessed One left Pañcasālā with his bowl just as cleanly washed as it was when he entered it for alms. Then Māra the Evil One approached the Blessed One and said to him: “Maybe you got alms, ascetic?”

“Was it you, Evil One, who saw to it that I didn’t get alms?”

“Then, venerable sir, let the Blessed One enter Pañcasālā a second time for alms. I will see to it that the Blessed One gets alms.”

  
  

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 482 “You have produced demerit, Māra,  
>   
> Having assailed the Tathāgata.  
>   
> Do you really think, O Evil One,   
>   
> ‘My evil does not ripen’?

>   
> We who own nothing at all.  
>   
> We shall dwell feeding on rapture  
>   
> Like the devas of Streaming Radiance.”

Then Māra the Evil One … disappeared right there.
