# SN4.9 Life Span (1)

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus!”

“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“Bhikkhus, this life span of human beings is short. One has to go on to the future life. One should do what is wholesome and lead the holy life; for one who has taken birth there is no avoiding death. One who lives long, bhikkhus, lives a hundred years or a little longer.”

Then Māra the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:

> 463 “Long is the life span of human beings,  
>   
> The good man should not disdain it.  
>   
> One should live like a milk-sucking baby:  
>   
> Death has not made its arrival.” 

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 464 “Short is the life span of human beings,  
>   
> The good man should disdain it.  
>   
> One should live like one with head aflame:  
>   
> There is no avoiding Death’s arrival.”

Then Māra the Evil One … disappeared right there.
