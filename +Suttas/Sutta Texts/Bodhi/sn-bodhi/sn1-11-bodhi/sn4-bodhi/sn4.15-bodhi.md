# SN4.15 Mental

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then Māra the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:

> 476 “There is a snare moving in the sky,   
>   
> Something mental which moves about  
>   
> By means of which I’ll catch you yet:  
>   
> You won’t escape me, ascetic!”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 477 “Forms, sounds, tastes, odours,  
>   
> And delightful tactile objects—  
>   
> Desire for these has vanished in me:  
>   
> You’re defeated, End-maker!”

Then Māra the Evil One … disappeared right there. \[112\]
