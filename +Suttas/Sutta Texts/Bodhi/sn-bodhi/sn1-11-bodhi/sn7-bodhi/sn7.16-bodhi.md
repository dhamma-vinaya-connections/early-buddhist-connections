# SN7.16 Paccanīka

At Sāvatthī. Now on that occasion a brahmin named Paccanīkasāta, Relisher of Contradiction, was residing at Sāvatthī. Then it occurred to the brahmin Paccanīkasāta: “Let me approach the ascetic Gotama and contradict whatever he says.”

Now on that occasion the Blessed One was walking back and forth in the open. Then the brahmin Paccanīkasāta approached the Blessed One and said to him while he was walking back and forth: “Speak Dhamma, ascetic!”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 693 “Well-spoken counsel is hard to understand  
>   
> By one who relishes contradiction,  
>   
> By one with a corrupt mind   
>   
> Who is engrossed in aggression.
>

> 694 “But if one has removed aggression  
>   
> And the distrust of one’s heart,  
>   
> If one has cast away aversion,  
>   
> One can understand well-spoken counsel.”

When this was said, the brahmin Paccanīkasāta said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama!… Let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”
