# SN7.3 Asurindaka

1On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. The brahmin Asurindaka Bharadvaja heard: "It is said that the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan has gone forth from the household life into homelessness under the ascetic Gotama." Angry and displeased, he approached the Blessed One and abused and reviled him with rude, harsh words.

When he had finished speaking, the Blessed One remained silent. Then the brahmin Asurindaka Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One: "You’re beaten, ascetic! You’re beaten, ascetic!"

The Blessed One:

2v.619 "The fool thinks victory is won
When, by speech, he bellows harshly;
But for one who understands,
Patient endurance is the true victory.

3v.620 "One who repays an angry man with anger
Thereby makes things worse for himself.
Not repaying an angry man with anger,
One wins a battle hard to win.

4v.621 "He practises for the welfare of both—
His own and the other's—
When, knowing that his foe is angry,
He mindfully maintains his peace.

5v.622 "When he achieves the cure of both—
His own and the other's—
The people who consider him a fool
Are unskilled in the Dhamma."
6When this was said, the brahmin Asurindaka Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! … " And the Venerable Bharadvaja became one of the arahants.
