# SN7.21 Saṅgārava

At Sāvatthī. Now on that occasion a brahmin named Saṅgārava was residing at Sāvatthī. He was a practitioner of water-purification, one who believed in purification by water, who dwelt devoted to the practice of immersing himself in water at dusk and at dawn.

Then, in the morning, the Venerable Ānanda dressed and, taking bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Having walked for alms in Sāvatthī, when he had returned from his alms round, after his meal he approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, \[183\] and said to him:

“Here, venerable sir, a brahmin named Saṅgārava is residing at Sāvatthī. He is a practitioner of water-purification … devoted to the practice of immersing himself in water at dusk and at dawn. It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would approach the residence of the brahmin Saṅgārava  out of compassion.” The Blessed One consented by silence.

Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed and, taking bowl and robe, approached the brahmin Saṅgārava’s residence, where he sat down in the appointed seat. Then the brahmin Saṅgārava approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him, after which he sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him: “Is it true, brahmin, that you are a practitioner of water-purification, one who believes in purification by water, devoted to the practice of immersing yourself in water at dusk and at dawn?”

“Yes, Master Gotama.”

“Considering what benefit do you do this, brahmin?”

“Here, Master Gotama, whatever evil deed I have done during the day I wash away by bathing at dusk. Whatever evil deed I have done at night I wash away by bathing at dawn.” 

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 705 “The Dhamma, brahmin, is a lake with fords of virtue—  
>   
> A limpid lake the good praise to the good—  
>   
> Where the knowledge-masters go to bathe,  
>   
> And, dry-limbed, cross to the far shore.”

When this was said, the brahmin Saṅgārava said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama!… Let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.” \[184\]
