# SN7.20 The Mendicant

At Sāvatthī. Then a mendicant brahmin approached the Blessed One … and said to him: “Master Gotama, I am a mendicant and you are a mendicant. What is the difference between us in this respect?”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 703 “It is not thus that one becomes a mendicant,  
>   
> Just because one begs others for alms.  
>   
> If one has taken up a domestic practice,  
>   
> One still has not become a bhikkhu.

>   
> Having expelled merit and evil,   
>   
> Who fares in the world with comprehension:  
>   
> He is truly called a bhikkhu.”

When this was said, the mendicant brahmin said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama!… Let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”
