# SN7.15 Mānatthaddha

At Sāvatthī. Now on that occasion a brahmin named Mānatthaddha, Stiff with Conceit, was residing at Sāvatthī. He did not pay homage to his mother or father, nor to his teacher or eldest brother. Now on that occasion the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma surrounded by a large assembly.  Then it occurred to the brahmin Mānatthaddha: “This ascetic Gotama is teaching the Dhamma surrounded by a large assembly. Let me approach him. If the ascetic Gotama addresses me, then I will address him in turn. But if he does not address me, neither will I address him.”

Then the brahmin Mānatthaddha approached the Blessed One and stood silently to one side, but the Blessed One did not address him. Then the brahmin Mānatthaddha, thinking, “This ascetic Gotama doesn’t know anything,” wanted to turn back, \[178\] but the Blessed One, having known with his own mind the reflection in the brahmin’s mind, addressed the brahmin Mānatthaddha in verse:

> 689 “The fostering of conceit is never good  
>   
> For one keen on his welfare, brahmin.  
>   
> You should instead foster that purpose  
>   
> Because of which you’ve come here.” 

Then the brahmin Mānatthaddha, thinking, “The ascetic Gotama knows my mind,” prostrated himself right there with his head at the Blessed One’s feet. He kissed the Blessed One’s feet, stroked them with his hands, and announced his name thus: “I am Mānatthaddha, Master Gotama! I am Mānatthaddha, Master Gotama!”

Then that assembly was struck with amazement and the people said: “It is wonderful indeed, sir! It is amazing indeed, sir! This brahmin Mānatthaddha does not pay homage to his mother and father, nor to his teacher or eldest brother, yet he shows such supreme honour towards the ascetic Gotama.”

Then the Blessed One said to the brahmin Mānatthaddha: “Enough, brahmin! Get up and sit in your own seat, as your mind has confidence in me.”

Then the brahmin Mānatthaddha sat down in his own seat and addressed the Blessed One in verse:

> 690 “Towards whom should one avoid conceit?  
>   
> Towards whom should one show reverence?  
>   
> To whom should one be ever respectful?   
>   
> Whom is it proper to venerate deeply?”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 691 “First one’s own mother and father,  
>   
> Then one’s eldest family brother,  
>   
> Then one’s teacher as the fourth:  
>   
> Towards these one should avoid conceit;  
>   
> Towards these one should be reverential;  
>   
> These should be well respected;  
>   
> These it is good to venerate deeply.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 692 “Having struck down conceit, humble,  
>   
> One should pay homage to the arahants,  
>   
> Those cool of heart, their tasks done,  
>   
> The taintless ones, unsurpassed.”

When this was said, the brahmin Mānatthaddha said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama!…  Let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.” \[179\]
