# SN7.7 Suddhika

At Sāvatthī. Then the brahmin Suddhika Bhāradvāja approached the Blessed One  and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side \[166\] and recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 629 “In the world no brahmin is ever purified  
>   
> Though he be virtuous and austere in practice;  
>   
> One accomplished in knowledge and conduct is purified,  
>   
> Not the others, the common folk.”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 630 “Even though one mutters many chants,  
>   
> One does not become a brahmin by birth  
>   
> If one is rotten within and defiled,  
>   
> Supporting oneself by fraudulent means.
> 
> >

> 
> 631 “Whether khattiya, brahmin, vessa, sudda,  
>   
> Caṇḍāla or scavenger,  
>   
> If one is energetic and resolute,  
>   
> Always firm in exertion,  
>   
> One attains the supreme purity:  
>   
> Know, O brahmin, that this is so.” 

When this was said, the brahmin Suddhika Bhāradvāja said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama!”… And the Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the arahants.
