# SN7.8 Aggika

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Now on that occasion milk-rice with ghee had been set out for the brahmin Aggika Bhāradvāja, who had thought: “I will offer a fire sacrifice, I will perform the fire oblation.”

Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed and, taking bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms. Walking for alms on uninterrupted alms round in Rājagaha, the Blessed One approached the residence of the brahmin Aggika Bhāradvāja and stood to one side. The brahmin Aggika Bhāradvāja saw the Blessed One standing for alms and addressed him in verse: 

> 632 “One endowed with the triple knowledge,  
>   
> Of proper birth, of ample learning,  
>   
> Accomplished in knowledge and conduct,  
>   
> Might partake of this milk-rice meal.”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 633 “Even though one mutters many chants,  
>   
> One does not become a brahmin by birth  
>   
> If one is rotten within and defiled,  
>   
> With followers gained by fraudulent means. \[167\]
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 634 “One who has known his past abodes,  
>   
> Who sees heaven and the plane of woe,  
>   
> Who has reached the destruction of birth,  
>   
> A sage consummate in direct knowledge:
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 635 “By means of these three kinds of knowledge  
>   
> One is a triple-knowledge brahmin.  
>   
> This one accomplished in knowledge and conduct  
>   
> Might partake of this milk-rice meal.” 

\[The brahmin Aggika Bhāradvāja:\] “Let Master Gotama eat. The worthy is a brahmin.”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 636 “Food over which verses have been sung  
>   
> Is not fit to be eaten by me.  
>   
> This, brahmin, is not the principle  
>   
> Observed by those who see.  
>   
> The Enlightened Ones reject such food  
>   
> Over which verses have been sung.  
>   
> As such a principle exists, O brahmin,  
>   
> This is their rule of conduct.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 637 “Serve with other food and drink  
>   
> The consummate one, the great seer  
>   
> With taints destroyed and remorse stilled,  
>   
> For he is the field for one seeking merit.”
> 
>   
>   
> 
> When this was said, the brahmin Aggika Bhāradvāja said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama!”… And the Venerable Aggika Bhāradvāja became one of the arahants.
