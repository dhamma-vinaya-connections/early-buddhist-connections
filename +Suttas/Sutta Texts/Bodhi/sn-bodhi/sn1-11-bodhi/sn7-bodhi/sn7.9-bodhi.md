# SN7.9 Sundarika

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Kosalans on the bank of the river Sundarika. Now on that occasion  the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja was offering a fire sacrifice and performing the fire oblation on the bank of the river Sundarika. Then the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja, having offered the fire sacrifice and performed the fire oblation, rose from his seat and surveyed the four quarters all around, wondering: “Who now might eat this sacrificial cake?”

The brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja saw the Blessed One sitting at the foot of a tree with his head covered. Having seen him, he took the sacrificial cake in his left hand and the waterpot in his right hand and approached the Blessed One. When the Blessed One heard the sound of the brahmin’s footsteps, he uncovered his head. Then the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja, thinking, “This worthy is shaven-headed, \[168\] this worthy is a shaveling,” wanted to turn back;  but it occurred to him: “Some brahmins here are also shaven-headed. Let me approach him and inquire about his birth.”

Then the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja approached the Blessed One and said to him: “What is the worthy one’s birth?”

  
  

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 638 “Ask not of birth but ask of conduct:  
>   
> Fire is indeed produced from any wood.  
>   
> A resolute sage, though from low family,  
>   
> Is a thoroughbred restrained by a sense of shame.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 639 “The sacrificer should invoke this one:  
>   
> One tamed by truth, perfect by taming,  
>   
> Who has reached the end of knowledge,  
>   
> A fulfiller of the holy life.  
>   
> Then he makes a timely oblation  
>   
> To one worthy of offerings.” 

\[The brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja:\]

> 640 “Surely my sacrifice is well performed  
>   
> As I have seen such a knowledge-master.  
>   
> Because I had not seen those like yourself  
>   
> Other people ate the sacrificial cake.

“Let Master Gotama eat. The worthy is a brahmin.”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 641-42 “Food over which verses have been sung  
>   
> … (verses = 636-37) …  
>   
> For he is the field for one seeking merit.” 

“Then, Master Gotama, should I give this sacrificial cake to someone else?”

“I do not see anyone, brahmin, in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, who could eat and properly digest this sacrificial cake \[169\] except the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata. Therefore, brahmin, throw away the sacrificial cake in a place where there is sparse vegetation or dispose of it in water where there are no living beings.”

Then the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja disposed of that sacrificial cake in water where there were no living beings. When it was disposed of in the water, that sacrificial cake sizzled and hissed and gave off steam and smoke. Just as a ploughshare, heated all day, sizzles and hisses and gives off steam and smoke if placed in water, so too that sacrificial cake,  when disposed of in the water, sizzled and hissed and gave off steam and smoke.

Then the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja, shocked and terrified, approached the Blessed One and stood to one side. The Blessed One then addressed him with verses:

> 643 “When kindling wood, brahmin, do not imagine  
>   
> This external deed brings purity;  
>   
> For experts say no purity is gained  
>   
> By one who seeks it outwardly.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 644 “Having given up the fire made from wood,  
>   
> I kindle, O brahmin, the inner light alone.  
>   
> Always ablaze, my mind always concentrated,  
>   
> I am an arahant living the holy life.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 645 “Conceit, O brahmin, is your shoulder-load,   
>   
> Anger the smoke, false speech the ashes;  
>   
> The tongue is the ladle, the heart the altar,  
>   
> A well-tamed self is the light of a man.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 646 “The Dhamma is a lake with fords of virtue—  
>   
> Limpid, praised by the good to the good—  
>   
> Where the knowledge-masters go to bathe,  
>   
> And, dry-limbed, cross to the far shore.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 647 “Truth, Dhamma, restraint, the holy life,  
>   
> Attainment of Brahmā based on the middle: \[170\]  
>   
> Pay homage, O brahmin, to the upright ones;  
>   
> I call that person one impelled by Dhamma.”

When this was said, the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama!”… And the Venerable Sundarika Bhāradvāja became one of the arahants.
