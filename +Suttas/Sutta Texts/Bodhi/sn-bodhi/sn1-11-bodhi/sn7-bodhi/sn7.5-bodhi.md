# SN7.5 Ahiṁsaka

1At Sāvatthī. Then the brahmin Ahiṁsaka Bharadvaja, Bharadvaja the Harmless, approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: "I am Ahiṁsaka the Harmless, Master Gotama. I am Ahiṁsaka the Harmless, Master Gotama."

The Blessed One:

2v.324 "If one were as one's name implies
You would be a harmless one.
But it is one who does no harm at all
By body, speech, or mind,
Who really is a harmless one
As he does not harm others."

3When this was said, the brahmin Ahiṁsaka Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! … " And the Venerable Ahiṁsaka Bharadvaja became one of the arahants.
