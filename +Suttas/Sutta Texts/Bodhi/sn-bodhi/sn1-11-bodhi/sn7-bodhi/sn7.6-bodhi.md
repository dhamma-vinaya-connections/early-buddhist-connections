# SN7.6 Tangle

1At Sāvatthī. Then the brahmin Jaṭa Bharadvaja, Bharadvaja of the Tangle, approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and addressed the Blessed One in verse:

2v.625 "A tangle inside, a tangle outside,
This generation is entangled in a tangle.
I ask you this, O Gotama,
Who can disentangle this tangle?"

The Blessed One:

3v.626 "A man established on virtue, wise,
Developing the mind and wisdom,
A bhikkhu ardent and discreet:
He can disentangle this tangle.

4v.627 "Those for whom lust and hatred
Along with ignorance have been expunged,
The arahants with taints destroyed:
For them the tangle is disentangled.

5v.628 "Where name-and-form ceases,
Stops without remainder,
And also impingement and perception of form:
It is here this tangle is cut."

6When this was said, the brahmin Jaṭa Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! … " And the Venerable Bharadvaja became one of the arahants.
