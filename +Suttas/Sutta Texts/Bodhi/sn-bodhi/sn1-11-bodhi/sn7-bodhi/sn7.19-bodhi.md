# SN7.19 The Mother Supporter

At Sāvatthī. Then a brahmin who supported his mother approached the Blessed One … and said to him: “Master Gotama, I seek almsfood righteously and thereby support my mother and father. In doing so, am I doing my duty?”

“For sure, brahmin, in doing so you are doing your duty. One who seeks almsfood righteously \[182\] and thereby supports his mother and father generates much merit.

> 702 “When a mortal righteously supports his parents,  
>   
> Because of this service to them  
>   
> The wise praise him here in this world,  
>   
> And after death he rejoices in heaven.” 

When this was said, the brahmin who supported his mother said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama!… Let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”
