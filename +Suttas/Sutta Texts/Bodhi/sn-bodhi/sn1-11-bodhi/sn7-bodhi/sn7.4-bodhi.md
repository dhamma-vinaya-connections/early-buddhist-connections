# SN7.4 Bilangika

1On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. The brahmin Bilangika Bharadvaja heard: "It is said that the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan has gone forth from the household life into homelessness under the ascetic Gotama." Angry and displeased, he approached the Blessed One and silently stood to one side.

Then the Blessed One, having known with his own mind the reflection in the brahmin Bilangika Bharadvaja's mind, addressed him in verse:

2v.623 "If one wrongs an innocent man,
A pure person without blemish,
The evil falls back on the fool himself
Like fine dust thrown against the wind."

3When this was said, the brahmin Bilangika Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! … " And the Venerable Bharadvaja became one of the arahants.
