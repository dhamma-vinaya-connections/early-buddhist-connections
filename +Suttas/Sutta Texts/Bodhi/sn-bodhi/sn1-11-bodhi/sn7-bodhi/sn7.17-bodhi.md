# SN7.17 Navakammika

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Kosalans in a certain woodland thicket. Now on that occasion the brahmin Navakammika Bhāradvāja was getting some work done in that woodland thicket. The brahmin Navakammika Bhāradvāja saw the Blessed One sitting at the foot of a certain sal tree with his legs folded crosswise, holding his body erect, having set up mindfulness in front of him. Having seen him, he thought:  “I take delight in getting work done in this woodland thicket. What does this ascetic Gotama take delight in getting done?”

Then the brahmin Navakammika Bhāradvāja approached the Blessed One \[180\] and addressed him in verse:

> 695 “With what kind of work are you engaged  
>   
> Here in this sal woods, bhikkhu,  
>   
> By reason of which you find delight  
>   
> Alone in the forest, Gotama?”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 696 “There is nothing in the woods I need to do;  
>   
> Cut down at the root, my woods is dried up.  
>   
> Woodless and dartless, discontent cast off,  
>   
> I find delight alone in the woods.” 

When this was said, the brahmin Navakammika Bhāradvāja said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama!… Let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”
