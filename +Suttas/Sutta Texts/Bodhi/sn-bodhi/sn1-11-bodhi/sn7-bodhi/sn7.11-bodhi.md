# SN7.11 Kasi Bhāradvāja

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Magadhans at Dakkhiṇāgiri near the brahmin village of Ekanāḷa. Now on that occasion the brahmin Kasi Bhāradvāja, Bhāradvāja the Ploughman, had five hundred ploughs fastened to their yokes at the time of sowing. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed and, taking bowl and robe, went to the place where the brahmin Kasi Bhāradvāja was at work.

Now on that occasion the brahmin Kasi Bhāradvāja’s food distribution was taking place. Then the Blessed One approached the place of the food distribution  and stood to one side. The brahmin Kasi Bhāradvāja saw the Blessed One standing for alms and said to him:

“Recluse, I plough and sow, and when I have ploughed and sown I eat. You too, ascetic, ought to plough and sow; then, when you have ploughed and sown, you will eat.”

“I too, brahmin, plough and sow, and when I have ploughed and sown I eat.”

“But we do not see Master Gotama’s yoke or plough or ploughshare or goad or oxen; yet Master Gotama says, ‘I too, brahmin, plough and sow, and when I have ploughed and sown I eat.’”

Then the brahmin Kasi Bhāradvāja addressed the Blessed One in verse: 

> 662 “You claim to be a man who works the plough,  
>   
> But I do not see your ploughing.  
>   
> If you’re a ploughman, answer me:  
>   
> How should we understand your ploughing?”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 663 “Faith is the seed, austerity the rain,  
>   
> Wisdom my yoke and plough;  
>   
> Shame is the pole, mind the yoke-tie,  
>   
> Mindfulness my ploughshare and goad.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 664 “Guarded in body, guarded in speech,  
>   
> Controlled in my appetite for food,  
>   
> I use truth as my weeding-hook,  
>   
> And gentleness as my unyoking. \[173\]
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 665 “Energy is my beast of burden,  
>   
> Carrying me to security from bondage.  
>   
> It goes ahead without stopping  
>   
> To where, having gone, one does not sorrow .
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 666 “In such a way this ploughing is done  
>   
> Which has the Deathless as its fruit.  
>   
> Having finished this work of ploughing,   
>   
> One is released from all suffering.”

“Let Master Gotama eat! The worthy is a ploughman, since Master Gotama does ploughing that has even the Deathless as its fruit.”

> 667-68 “Food over which verses have been sung  
>   
> … (verses = 636-37) …  
>   
> For he is the field for one seeking merit.”

When this was said, the brahmin Kasi Bhāradvāja said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! The Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama, as though he were turning upright what had been turned upside down, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms.  I go for refuge to Master Gotama, and to the Dhamma, and to the Bhikkhu Saṅgha. Let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”
