# SN7.13 Devahita

At Sāvatthī. Now on that occasion the Blessed One was afflicted by winds and the Venerable Upavāṇa was his attendant. Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Upavāṇa thus: “Come now, Upavāṇa, find some hot water for me.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” the Venerable Upavāṇa replied. Then he dressed and, taking bowl and robe, went to the residence of the brahmin Devahita, where he stood silently to one side. The brahmin Devahita saw the Venerable Upavāṇa standing silently to one side and addressed him in verse: \[175\]

> 673 “Silent, the worthy one stands,  
>   
> Shaven-headed, clad in a stitched robe.  
>   
> What do you want, what do you seek,  
>   
> What have you come here to beg?”

\[The Venerable Upavāṇa:\]

> 674 “The Arahant, the Fortunate One in the world,  
>   
> The Sage, is afflicted with winds.   
>   
> If there is any hot water, brahmin,  
>   
> Please give it for the Sage.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 675 “He is worshipped by those worthy of worship,  
>   
> Honoured by those worthy of honour,  
>   
> Respected by those worthy of respect:  
>   
> It is to him that I wish to take it.”

Then the brahmin Devahita ordered a man to bring a carrying pole with hot water and presented a bag of molasses to the Venerable Upavāṇa. Then the Venerable Upavāṇa approached the Blessed One. He had the Blessed One bathed with the hot water, and he mixed the molasses with hot water and offered it to him. Then the Blessed One’s ailment subsided.

Then the brahmin Devahita approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him, after which he sat down to one side and addressed the Blessed One in verse:

> 676 “Where should one give a proper gift?   
>   
> Where does a gift bear great fruit?  
>   
> How, for one bestowing alms,  
>   
> Does an offering bring success—just how?”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 677 “One who has known his past abodes,  
>   
> Who sees heaven and the plane of woe,  
>   
> Who has reached the destruction of birth,  
>   
> A sage consummate in direct knowledge:
> 
> 678 Here one should give a proper gift,  
>   
> Here a gift bears great fruit.  
>   
> That’s how, for one bestowing alms,  
>   
> An offering brings success—just so!”

When this was said, the brahmin Devahita said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent , Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama!… Let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”
