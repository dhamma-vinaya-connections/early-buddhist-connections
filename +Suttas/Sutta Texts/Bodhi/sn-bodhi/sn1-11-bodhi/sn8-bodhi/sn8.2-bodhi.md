# SN8.2 Discontent

On one occasion the Venerable Vaṅgīsa was dwelling at Āḷavī at the Aggāḷava Shrine together with his preceptor, the Venerable Nigrodhakappa. Now on that occasion, when the Venerable Nigrodhakappa returned from his alms round, after his meal he would enter the dwelling and would come out either in the evening or on the following day.

Now on that occasion dissatisfaction had arisen in the Venerable Vaṅgīsa; lust had infested his mind. Then it occurred to the Venerable Vaṅgīsa: “It is a loss for me indeed, it is no gain for me! It is a mishap for me indeed, it is not well gained by me, that dissatisfaction has arisen in me, that lust has infested my mind.  How could anyone else dispel my dissatisfaction and arouse delight? Let me dispel my own dissatisfaction and arouse delight by myself.”

Then the Venerable Vaṅgīsa, having dispelled his own dissatisfaction and aroused delight by himself, on that occasion recited these verses:

> 712 “Having abandoned discontent and delight  
>   
> And household thoughts entirely,  
>   
> One should not nurture lust towards anything;  
>   
> The lustless one, without delight—  
>   
> He is indeed a bhikkhu.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 713 “Whatever exists here on earth and in space,  
>   
> Comprised by form, included in the world—  
>   
> Everything impermanent decays;  
>   
> The sages fare having pierced this truth. 
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 714 “People are tied to their acquisitions,  
>   
> To what is seen, heard, sensed, and felt;  
>   
> Dispel desire for this, be unstirred:  
>   
> They call him a sage  
>   
> Who clings to nothing here. \[187\]
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 715 “Then those caught in the sixty,  
>   
> Led by their own thoughts—  
>   
> There are many such among the people  
>   
> Who have settled on wrong doctrine:  
>   
> One who would not join their faction anywhere,  
>   
> Nor utter corrupt speech—he is a bhikkhu.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 716 “Proficient, long trained in concentration,  
>   
> Honest, discreet, without longing,  
>   
> The sage has attained the peaceful state,  
>   
> Depending on which he bides his time  
>   
> Fully quenched within himself.”
