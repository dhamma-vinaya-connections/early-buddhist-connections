# SN8.7 Pavāraṇā

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in the Eastern Park in the Mansion of Migāra’s Mother together with a great Saṅgha of bhikkhus, with five hundred bhikkhus, all of them arahants. Now on that occasion—the Uposatha day of the fifteenth—the Blessed One was sitting in the open surrounded by the Bhikkhu Saṅgha in order to hold the Pavāraṇā. Then, having surveyed the silent Bhikkhu Saṅgha, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Come now,  bhikkhus, let me invite you: Is there any deed of mine, either bodily or verbal, which you would censure?”

When this was said, the Venerable Sāriputta rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and, raising his joined hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One, said to him: “Venerable sir, there is no deed of the Blessed One, either bodily or verbal, that we censure. \[191\] For, venerable sir, the Blessed One is the originator of the path unarisen before, the producer of the path unproduced before, the declarer of the path undeclared before. He is the knower of the path, the discoverer of the path, the one skilled in the path. And his disciples now dwell following that path and become possessed of it afterwards.  And I, venerable sir, invite the Blessed One: Is there any deed of mine, either bodily or verbal, which the Blessed One would censure?”

“There is no deed of yours, Sāriputta, either bodily or verbal, that I censure. For you, Sāriputta, are wise, one of great wisdom, of wide wisdom, of joyous wisdom, of swift wisdom,  of sharp wisdom, of penetrative wisdom. Just as the eldest son of a wheel-turning monarch properly keeps in motion the wheel \[of sovereignty\] set in motion by his father, so do you, Sāriputta, properly keep in motion the Wheel of Dhamma set in motion by me.”

“If, venerable sir, the Blessed One does not censure any deed of mine, bodily or verbal, does he censure any deed, bodily or verbal, of these five hundred bhikkhus?”

“There is no deed, Sāriputta, bodily or verbal, of these five hundred bhikkhus that I censure. For of these five hundred bhikkhus, Sāriputta, sixty bhikkhus are triple-knowledge bearers, sixty bhikkhus are bearers of the six direct knowledges, sixty bhikkhus are liberated in both ways, while the rest are liberated by wisdom.”

Then the Venerable Vaṅgīsa rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and, raising his joined hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One, said to him: “An inspiration has come to me, Blessed One! An inspiration has come to me, Fortunate One!”

The Blessed One said: “Then express your inspiration, Vaṅgīsa.” 

Then the Venerable Vaṅgīsa extolled the Blessed One to his face with suitable verses:

> 734 “Five hundred bhikkhus have gathered today,  
>   
> The fifteenth day, for purification—  
>   
> Untroubled seers who have ended renewed existence,  
>   
> Who have cut off all fetters and bonds. \[192\]
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 735 “Just as a king, a wheel-turning monarch,  
>   
> Accompanied by his ministers,  
>   
> Travels all over this mighty earth  
>   
> Bounded by the deep dark ocean—
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 736 So they attend on the victor in battle,  
>   
> The unsurpassed caravan leader—  
>   
> The disciples bearing the triple knowledge,  
>   
> Who have left Death far behind.

> 737 “All are true sons of the Blessed One,  
>   
> Here no worthless chaff is found.  
>   
> I worship the Kinsman of the Sun,   
>   
> Destroyer of the dart of craving.”
