# SN8.10 Moggallāna

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on the Black Rock on the Isigili Slope, together with a great Saṅgha of bhikkhus, with five hundred bhikkhus all of whom were arahants. Thereupon the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna searched their minds with his own mind \[and saw that they were\] released, without acquisitions.

Then it occurred to the Venerable Vaṅgīsa: “The Blessed One is dwelling at Rājagaha on the Black Rock on the Isigili Slope…. Thereupon the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna has searched their minds with his own mind \[and seen that they are\] released, without acquisitions. Let me extol the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna in the Blessed One’s presence with suitable verses.” \[195\]

Then the Venerable Vaṅgīsa rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and, raising his joined hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One, said to him:  “An inspiration has come to me, Blessed One! An inspiration has come to me, Fortunate One!”

“Then express your inspiration, Vaṅgīsa.”

Then the Venerable Vaṅgīsa extolled the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna in the Blessed One’s presence with suitable verses:

> 749 “While the sage is seated on the mountain slope,  
>   
> Gone to the far shore of suffering,  
>   
> His disciples sit in attendance on him,  
>   
> Triple-knowledge men who have left Death behind.
>

> 750 “Moggallāna, great in spiritual power,  
>   
> Encompassed their minds with his own,  
>   
> And searching \[he came to see\] their minds:  
>   
> Fully released, without acquisitions!
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 751 “Thus those perfect in many qualities  
>   
> Attend upon Gotama,  
>   
> The sage perfect in all respects,  
>   
> Gone to the far shore of suffering.”
