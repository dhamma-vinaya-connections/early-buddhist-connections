# SN8.3 Well Behaved

On one occasion the Venerable Vaṅgīsa was living at Āḷavī at the Aggāḷava Shrine together with his preceptor, the Venerable Nigrodhakappa. Now on that occasion, the Venerable Vaṅgīsa, because of his own ingenuity, had been looking down at other well-behaved bhikkhus. Then the thought occurred to the Venerable Vaṅgīsa: “It is a loss for me indeed, it is no gain for me! It is a mishap for me indeed, it is not well gained by me, that because of my ingenuity I look down upon other well-behaved bhikkhus.”

Then the Venerable Vaṅgīsa, having aroused remorse in himself, on that occasion recited these verses:

> 717 “Abandon conceit, O Gotama,  
>   
> And leave the pathway of conceit entirely.  
>   
> Infatuated with the pathway of conceit,  
>   
> For a long time you’ve been remorseful. 
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 718 “People smeared by denigration,  
>   
> Slain by conceit, fall into hell.  
>   
> People sorrow for a long time,  
>   
> Slain by conceit, reborn in hell.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 719 “But a bhikkhu never sorrows at all,  
>   
> A path-knower practising rightly.  
>   
> He experiences acclaim and happiness;  
>   
> Truly they call him a seer of Dhamma. \[188\]
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 720 “Therefore be pliant here and strenuous;  
>   
> Having abandoned the hindrances, be pure.  
>   
> Having entirely abandoned conceit,  
>   
> Be an end-maker by knowledge, peaceful.”
