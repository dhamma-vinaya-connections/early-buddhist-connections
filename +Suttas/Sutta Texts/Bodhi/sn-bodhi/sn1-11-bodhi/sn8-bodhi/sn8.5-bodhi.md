# SN8.5 Well Spoken

At Sāvatthī. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus!”

“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“Bhikkhus, when speech possesses four factors, then it is well spoken, not badly spoken, and it is blameless, not blameworthy among the wise. What four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu speaks only what is well spoken, not what is badly spoken. He speaks only on the Dhamma, not on non-Dhamma. \[189\] He speaks only what is pleasant, not what is unpleasant. He speaks only what is true, not what is false.  When speech possesses these four factors, it is well spoken, not badly spoken, and it is blameless, not blameworthy among the wise.”

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

> 726 “What is well spoken, the good say, is foremost;  
>   
> Second, speak Dhamma, not non-Dhamma;  
>   
> Third, speak what is pleasant, not unpleasant;  
>   
> Fourth, speak the truth, not falsehood.”

Then the Venerable Vaṅgīsa rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and, raising his joined hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One, said to him: “An inspiration has come to me, Blessed One! An inspiration has come to me, Fortunate One!”

The Blessed One said: “Then express your inspiration, Vaṅgīsa.”

Then the Venerable Vaṅgīsa extolled the Blessed One to his face with suitable verses:

> 727 “One should utter only such speech  
>   
> By which one does not afflict oneself  
>   
> Nor cause harm to others:  
>   
> Such speech is truly well spoken. 
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 728 “One should utter only pleasant speech,  
>   
> Speech that is gladly welcomed.  
>   
> When it brings them nothing evil  
>   
> What one speaks is pleasant to others.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 729 “Truth, indeed, is deathless speech:  
>   
> This is an ancient principle.  
>   
> The goal and the Dhamma, the good say,  
>   
> Are established upon truth.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 730 “The secure speech which the Buddha utters  
>   
> For the attainment of Nibbāna,  
>   
> For making an end to suffering  
>   
> Is truly the foremost speech.”
