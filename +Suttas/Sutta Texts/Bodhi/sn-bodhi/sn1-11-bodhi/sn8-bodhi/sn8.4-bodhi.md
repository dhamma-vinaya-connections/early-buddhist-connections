# SN8.4 Ānanda

On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, in the morning, the Venerable Ānanda  dressed and, taking bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms with the Venerable Vaṅgīsa as his companion. Now on that occasion dissatisfaction had arisen in the Venerable Vaṅgīsa; lust had infested his mind. Then the Venerable Vaṅgīsa addressed the Venerable Ānanda in verse:

> 721 “I am burning with sensual lust,  
>   
> My mind is engulfed by fire.  
>   
> Please tell me how to extinguish it,  
>   
> Out of compassion, O Gotama.”

\[The Venerable Ānanda:\]

> 722 “It is through an inversion of perception  
>   
> That your mind is engulfed by fire.  
>   
> Turn away from the sign of beauty  
>   
> Provocative of sensual lust.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 723 “See formations as alien,  
>   
> As suffering, not as self.  
>   
> Extinguish the great fire of lust;  
>   
> Don’t burn up again and again.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 724 “Develop the mind on foulness,  
>   
> One-pointed, well concentrated;   
>   
> Apply your mindfulness to the body,  
>   
> Be engrossed in revulsion.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 725 “Develop meditation on the signless,  
>   
> And discard the tendency to conceit.  
>   
> Then, by breaking through conceit,  
>   
> You will be one who fares at peace.”
