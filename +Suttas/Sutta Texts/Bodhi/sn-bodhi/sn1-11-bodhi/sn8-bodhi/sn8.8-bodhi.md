# SN8.8 Over a Thousand

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park, together with a great Saṅgha of bhikkhus, with 1,250 bhikkhus. Now on that occasion the Blessed One was instructing, exhorting, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk concerning Nibbāna. And those bhikkhus were listening to the Dhamma with eager ears, attending to it as a matter of vital concern, directing their whole mind to it.

Then it occurred to the Venerable Vaṅgīsa: “This Blessed One is instructing the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk concerning Nibbāna. And those bhikkhus are listening to the Dhamma with eager ears…. Let me extol the Blessed One to his face with suitable verses.”

Then the Venerable Vaṅgīsa rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and, raising his joined hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One, said to him: “An inspiration has come to me, Blessed One! An inspiration has come to me, Fortunate One!”

“Then express your inspiration, Vaṅgīsa.”

Then the Venerable Vaṅgīsa extolled the Blessed One to his face with suitable verses: 

> 738 “Over a thousand bhikkhus here  
>   
> Attend upon the Fortunate One  
>   
> As he teaches the dust-free Dhamma,  
>   
> Nibbāna inaccessible to fear.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 739 “They listen to the stainless Dhamma  
>   
> Taught by the Perfectly Enlightened One.  
>   
> The Enlightened One indeed shines  
>   
> Honoured by the Bhikkhu Saṅgha.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 740 “O Blessed One, your name is ‘Nāga,’  
>   
> The best seer of the seers.  
>   
> Like a great cloud bearing rain  
>   
> You pour down on the disciples. \[193\]
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 741 “Having emerged from his daytime abode  
>   
> From a desire to behold the Teacher,  
>   
> Your disciple Vaṅgīsa, O great hero,  
>   
> Bows down in worship at your feet.”

“Had you already thought out these verses, Vaṅgīsa, or did they occur to you spontaneously?” 

“I had not already thought out these verses, venerable sir; they occurred to me spontaneously.”

“In that case, Vaṅgīsa, let some more verses, not already thought out, occur to you.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” the Venerable Vaṅgīsa replied. Then he extolled the Blessed One with some more verses that had not been previously thought out:

> 742 “Having overcome the deviant course of Māra’s path,  
>   
> You fare having demolished barrenness of mind.  
>   
> Behold him, the releaser from bondage,  
>   
> Unattached, dissecting into parts.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 743 “For the sake of leading us across the flood  
>   
> You declared the path with its many aspects.  
>   
> The seers of Dhamma stand immovable  
>   
> In that Deathless declared by you. 
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 744 “The light-maker, having pierced right through,  
>   
> Saw the transcendence of all stations;  
>   
> Having known and realized it himself,  
>   
> He taught the chief matter to the five.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 745 “When the Dhamma has been so well taught,  
>   
> What negligence is there for those who understand it?  
>   
> Therefore, living diligent in the Blessed One’s Teaching,  
>   
> One should always reverently train in it.”
