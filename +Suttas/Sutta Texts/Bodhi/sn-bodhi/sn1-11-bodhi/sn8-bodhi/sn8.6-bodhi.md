# SN8.6 Sāriputta

On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now on that occasion the Venerable Sāriputta was instructing, exhorting, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk,  \[spoken\] with speech that was polished, clear, articulate, expressing well the meaning. And those bhikkhus were listening to the Dhamma with eager ears, attending to it as a matter of vital concern, directing their whole mind to it.

Then it occurred to the Venerable Vaṅgīsa: \[190\] ”This Venerable Sāriputta is instructing the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk, \[spoken\] with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressing well the meaning. And those bhikkhus are listening to the Dhamma with eager ears…. Let me extol the Venerable Sāriputta to his face with suitable verses.”

Then the Venerable Vaṅgīsa rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and, raising his joined hands in reverential salutation towards the Venerable Sāriputta, said to him: “An inspiration has come to me, friend Sāriputta! An inspiration has come to me, friend Sāriputta!”

“Then express your inspiration, friend Vaṅgīsa.”

Then the Venerable Vaṅgīsa extolled the Venerable Sāriputta to his face with suitable verses:

> 731 “Deep in wisdom, intelligent,  
>   
> Skilled in the true path and the false,  
>   
> Sāriputta, of great wisdom,  
>   
> Teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus.

> 732 “He teaches briefly,   
>   
> He speaks in detail.  
>   
> His voice, like that of a myna bird,  
>   
> Pours forth inspired discourse.

> 733 “As he teaches them, they listen  
>   
> To his sweet utterance.  
>   
> Uplifted in mind, made joyful  
>   
> By his delightful voice,  
>   
> Sonorous and lovely,  
>   
> The bhikkhus incline their ears.”
