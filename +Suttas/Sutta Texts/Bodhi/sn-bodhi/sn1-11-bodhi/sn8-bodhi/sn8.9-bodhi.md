# SN8.9 Koṇḍañña

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Then the Venerable Aññā Koṇḍañña, after a very long absence, approached the Blessed One, prostrated himself with his head at the Blessed One’s feet, kissed the Blessed One’s feet, \[194\] stroked them with his hands,  and announced his name thus: “I am Koṇḍañña, Blessed One! I am Koṇḍañña, Fortunate One!”

Then it occurred to the Venerable Vaṅgīsa: “This Venerable Aññā Koṇḍañña, after a very long absence, has approached the Blessed One … kisses the Blessed One’s feet, strokes them with his hands, and announces his name…. Let me extol the Venerable Aññā Koṇḍañña in the Blessed One’s presence with suitable verses.”

Then the Venerable Vaṅgīsa rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and, raising his joined hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One, said to him: “An inspiration has come to me, Blessed One! An inspiration has come to me, Fortunate One!”

“Then express your inspiration, Vaṅgīsa.”

Then the Venerable Vaṅgīsa extolled the Venerable Aññā Koṇḍañña in the Blessed One’s presence with suitable verses:

> 746 “Enlightened in succession to the Buddha,  
>   
> The elder Koṇḍañña, of strong endeavour,  
>   
> Is one who gains pleasant dwellings,  
>   
> One who often gains the seclusions.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 747 “Whatever may be attained by a disciple  
>   
> Who practises the Master’s Teaching,  
>   
> All that has been attained by him,   
>   
> One who trained diligently.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 748 “Of great might, a triple-knowledge man,  
>   
> Skilled in the course of others’ minds—  
>   
> Koṇḍañña, a true heir of the Buddha,  
>   
> Pays homage at the Teacher’s feet.”
