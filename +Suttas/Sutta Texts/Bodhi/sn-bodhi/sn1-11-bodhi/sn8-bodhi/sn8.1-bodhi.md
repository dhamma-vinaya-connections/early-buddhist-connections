# SN8.1 Renounced

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Venerable Vaṅgīsa was dwelling at Āḷavī at the Aggāḷava Shrine together with his preceptor, the Venerable Nigrodhakappa. Now on that occasion the Venerable Vaṅgīsa, newly ordained, not long gone forth, had been left behind as a caretaker of the dwelling.

Then a number of women, beautifully adorned, approached the Aggāḷavaka Park in order to see the dwelling. When the Venerable Vaṅgīsa saw those women, dissatisfaction arose in him; lust infested his mind. Then it occurred to him: “It is a loss for me indeed, it is no gain for me! It is a mishap for me indeed, it is not well gained by me, that dissatisfaction has arisen in me, that lust has infested my mind. How could anyone else dispel my dissatisfaction and arouse delight?  Let me dispel my own dissatisfaction and arouse delight by myself.”

Then the Venerable Vaṅgīsa, having dispelled his own dissatisfaction and aroused delight by himself, on that occasion recited these verses:

> 707 “Alas, though I am one who has renounced,  
>   
> Gone from home into homelessness,  
>   
> These thoughts still run over me,  
>   
> Impudent thoughts from the Dark One.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 708 “Even if mighty youths, great archers,  
>   
> Trained men, masters of the bow,  
>   
> A thousand such men who do not flee  
>   
> Should surround me on all sides,
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 709 And if women were to come here  
>   
> Still more numerous than this,  
>   
> They would never make me tremble  
>   
> For I stand firmly in the Dhamma. \[186\]
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 710 “I have heard this as a witness   
>   
> From the Buddha, Kinsman of the Sun:  
>   
> The path leading to Nibbāna—  
>   
> That is where my mind delights.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 711 “If, while I am dwelling thus,  
>   
> You approach me, Evil One,  
>   
> I will act in such a way, O Death,  
>   
> That you won’t even see my path.”
