# SN8.12 Vaṅgīsa

 On one occasion the Venerable Vaṅgīsa was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now on that occasion the Venerable Vaṅgīsa had only recently attained arahantship and, while experiencing the happiness of liberation, on that occasion he recited these verses:

> 753 “Drunk on poetry, I used to wander  
>   
> From village to village, town to town.  
>   
> Then I saw the Enlightened One  
>   
> And faith arose within me.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 754 “He then taught me the Dhamma:  
>   
> Aggregates, sense bases, and elements.  
>   
> Having heard the Dhamma from him,  
>   
> I went forth into homelessness.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 755 “Indeed, for the good of many,  
>   
> The sage attained enlightenment,  
>   
> For the bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs   
>   
> Who have reached and seen the fixed course.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 756 “Welcome indeed has it been for me,  
>   
> My coming into the Buddha’s presence.  
>   
> The three knowledges have been obtained,  
>   
> The Buddha’s Teaching has been done.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 757 “I know now my past abodes,  
>   
> The divine eye is purified.  
>   
> A triple knowledge man, attained to spiritual powers,  
>   
> I am skilled in the course of others’ minds.”
