# SN8.11 Gaggarā

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Campā on the bank of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond together with a great Saṅgha of bhikkhus, with five hundred bhikkhus, seven hundred male lay followers,  seven hundred female lay followers, and many thousands of devatās. The Blessed One outshone them in beauty and glory.

Then it occurred to the Venerable Vaṅgīsa: “This Blessed One is dwelling at Campā … and many thousands of devatās. The Blessed One outshines them in beauty and glory. Let me extol the Blessed One to his face with suitable verses.”

Then the Venerable Vaṅgīsa rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and, raising his joined hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One, said to him: “An inspiration has come to me, Blessed One! An inspiration has come to me, Fortunate One!”

“Then express your inspiration, Vaṅgīsa.”

Then the Venerable Vaṅgīsa extolled the Blessed One to his face with a suitable verse: \[196\]

> 752 “As the moon shines in a cloudless sky,  
>   
> As the sun shines devoid of stain,  
>   
> So you, Aṅgīrasa, O great sage,  
>   
> Outshine the whole world with your glory.”
