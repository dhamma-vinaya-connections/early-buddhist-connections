# SN5.9 Selā

At Sāvatthī. Then, in the morning, the bhikkhunī Selā dressed … she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day’s abiding.

Then Māra the Evil One, desiring to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in the bhikkhunī Selā, desiring to make her fall away from concentration, approached her and addressed her in verse:

> 548 By whom has this puppet been created?  
>   
> Where is the maker of the puppet?  
>   
> Where has the puppet arisen?  
>   
> Where does the puppet cease?” 

Then it occurred to the bhikkhunī Selā: “Now who is this…? This is Māra the Evil One … desiring to make me fall away from concentration.”

Then the bhikkhunī Selā, having understood, “This is Māra the Evil One,” replied to him in verses:

> 549 “This puppet is not made by itself,  
>   
> Nor is this misery made by another.  
>   
> It has come to be dependent on a cause;  
>   
> With the cause’s breakup it will cease.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 550 “As when a seed is sown in a field  
>   
> It grows depending on a pair of factors:  
>   
> It requires both the soil’s nutrients  
>   
> And a steady supply of moisture:
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 551 “Just so the aggregates and elements,  
>   
> And these six bases of sensory contact,  
>   
> Have come to be dependent on a cause;  
>   
> With the cause’s breakup they will cease.”

Then Māra the Evil One, realizing, “The bhikkhunī Selā knows me,” sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.
