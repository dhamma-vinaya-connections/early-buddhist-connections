# SN5.2 Somā

At Sāvatthī. Then, in the morning, the bhikkhunī Somā dressed and, taking bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. When she had walked for alms in Sāvatthī and had returned from her alms round, after her meal she went to the Blind Men’s Grove for the day’s abiding. Having plunged into the Blind Men’s Grove, she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day’s abiding.

Then Māra the Evil One, desiring to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in the bhikkhunī Somā, desiring to make her fall away from concentration, approached her and addressed her in verse:

> 522 “That state so hard to achieve  
>   
> Which is to be attained by the seers,  
>   
> Can’t be attained by a woman  
>   
> With her two-fingered wisdom.”

Then it occurred to the bhikkhunī Somā: “Now who is this that recited the verse—a human being or a nonhuman being?” Then it occurred to her: “This is Māra the Evil One, who has recited the verse desiring to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in me, desiring to make me fall away from concentration.”

Then the bhikkhunī Somā, having understood, “This is Māra the Evil One,” replied to him in verses: 

> 523 “What does womanhood matter at all  
>   
> When the mind is concentrated well,  
>   
> When knowledge flows on steadily  
>   
> As one sees correctly into Dhamma.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 524 “One to whom it might occur,  
>   
> ‘I’m a woman’ or ‘I’m a manʹ  
>   
> Or ‘I’m anything at all’—  
>   
> Is fit for Māra to address.”

Then Māra the Evil One, realizing, “The bhikkhunī Somā knows me,” sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.
