# SN5.1 Āḷavikā

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

Then, in the morning, the bhikkhunī Āḷavikā dressed and, taking bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. When she had walked for alms in Sāvatthī and had returned from her alms round, after her meal she went to the Blind Men’s Grove seeking seclusion. 

Then Māra the Evil One, desiring to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in the bhikkhunī Āḷavikā, desiring to make her fall away from seclusion, approached her and addressed her in verse:

> 519 “There is no escape in the world,  
>   
> So what will you do with seclusion?  
>   
> Enjoy the delights of sensual pleasure:  
>   
> Don’t be remorseful later!”

Then it occurred to the bhikkhunī Āḷavikā: “Now who is it that recited the verse—a human being or a nonhuman being?” Then  it occurred to her: “This is Māra the Evil One, who has recited the verse desiring to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in me, desiring to make me fall away from seclusion.”

Then the bhikkhunī Āḷavikā, having understood, “This is Māra the Evil One,” replied to him in verses:

> 520 “There is an escape in the world  
>   
> Which I have closely touched with wisdom.  
>   
> O Evil One, kinsman of the negligent,  
>   
> You do not know that state.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 521 “Sensual pleasures are like swords and stakes;  
>   
> The aggregates like their chopping block.  
>   
> What you call sensual delight  
>   
> Has become for me nondelight.” \[129\]

Then Māra the Evil One, realizing, “The bhikkhunī Āḷavikā knows me,” sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.
