# SN5.4 Vijayā

At Sāvatthī. Then, in the morning, the bhikkhunī Vijayā dressed … she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day’s abiding.

Then Māra the Evil One, desiring to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in the bhikkhunī Vijayā, desiring to make her fall away from concentration, approached her and addressed her in verse: \[131\]

> 528 “You are so young and beautiful,  
>   
> And I too am a youth in my prime.  
>   
> Come, noble lady, let us rejoice  
>   
> With the music of a fivefold ensemble.”

Then it occurred to the bhikkhunī Vijayā: “Now who is this…? This is Māra the Evil One … desiring to make me fall away from concentration.” 

Then the bhikkhunī Vijayā, having understood, “This is Māra the Evil One,” replied to him in verses:

> 529 “Forms, sounds, tastes, odours,  
>   
> And delightful tactile objects—  
>   
> I offer them right back to you,  
>   
> For I, O Māra, do not need them.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 530 “I am repelled and humiliated  
>   
> By this foul, putrid body,  
>   
> Subject to break up, fragile:  
>   
> I’ve uprooted sensual craving.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 531 “As to those beings who fare amidst form,  
>   
> And those who abide in the formless,  
>   
> And those peaceful attainments too:  
>   
> Everywhere darkness has been destroyed.”

Then Māra the Evil One, realizing “The bhikkhunī Vijayā knows me,” sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.
