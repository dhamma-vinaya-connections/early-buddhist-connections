# SN5.10 Vajirā

 At Sāvatthī. Then, in the morning, the bhikkhunī Vajirā dressed and, taking bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. When she had walked for alms in Sāvatthī \[135\] and had returned from her alms round, after her meal she went to the Blind Men’s Grove for the day’s abiding. Having plunged into the Blind Men’s Grove, she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day’s abiding.

Then Māra the Evil One, desiring to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in the bhikkhunī Vajirā, desiring to make her fall away from concentration, approached her and addressed her in verse:

> 552 “By whom has this being been created?  
>   
> Where is the maker of the being?  
>   
> Where has the being arisen?  
>   
> Where does the being cease?”

Then it occurred to the bhikkhunī Vajirā: “Now who is this that recited the verse—a human being or a nonhuman being?” Then it occurred to her: “This is Māra the Evil One, who has recited the verse desiring to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in me, desiring to make me fall away from concentration.”

Then the bhikkhunī Vajirā, having understood, “This is Māra the Evil One,” replied to him in verses:

> 553 “Why now do you assume ‘a being’?  
>   
> Māra, is that your speculative view?   
>   
> This is a heap of sheer formations:  
>   
> Here no being is found.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 554 “Just as, with an assemblage of parts,  
>   
> The word ‘chariot’ is used,  
>   
> So, when the aggregates exist,  
>   
> There is the convention ‘a being.’
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 555 “It’s only suffering that comes to be,  
>   
> Suffering that stands and falls away.  
>   
> Nothing but suffering comes to be,  
>   
> Nothing but suffering ceases.”

Then Māra the Evil One, realizing, “The bhikkhunī Vajirā knows me,” sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.
