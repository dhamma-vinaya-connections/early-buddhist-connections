# SN5.3 Gotamī

At Sāvatthī. Then, in the morning, the bhikkhunī Kisāgotamī dressed and, taking bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. When she had walked for alms in Sāvatthī and had returned from her alms round, \[130\] after her meal she went to the Blind Men’s Grove for the day’s abiding. Having plunged into the Blind Men’s Grove, she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day’s abiding. 

Then Māra the Evil One, desiring to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in the bhikkhunī Kisāgotamī, desiring to make her fall away from concentration, approached her and addressed her in verse:

> 525 “Why now, when your son is dead,  
>   
> Do you sit alone with tearful face?  
>   
> Having entered the woods all alone,  
>   
> Are you on the lookout for a man?”

Then it occurred to the bhikkhunī Kisāgotamī: “Now who is this that recited the verse—a human being or a nonhuman being?” Then it occurred to her: “This is Māra the Evil One, who has recited the verse desiring to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in me, desiring to make me fall away from concentration.”

Then the bhikkhunī Kisāgotamī, having understood, “This is Māra the Evil One,” replied to him in verses:

> 526 “I’ve gotten past the death of sons;  
>   
> With this, the search for men has ended.  
>   
> I do not sorrow, I do not weep,  
>   
> Nor do I fear you, friend .
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 527 “Delight everywhere has been destroyed,  
>   
> The mass of darkness has been sundered.   
>   
> Having conquered the army of Death,  
>   
> I dwell without defiling taints.”

Then Māra the Evil One, realizing, “The bhikkhunī Kisāgotamī knows me,” sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.
