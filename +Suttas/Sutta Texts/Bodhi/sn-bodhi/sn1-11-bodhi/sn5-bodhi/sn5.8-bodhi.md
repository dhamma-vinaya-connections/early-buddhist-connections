# SN5.8 Sīsupacālā

 At Sāvatthī. Then, in the morning, the bhikkhunī Sīsupacālā dressed … she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day’s abiding.

Then Māra the Evil One approached the bhikkhunī Sīsupacālā and said to her: “Whose creed do you approve of, bhikkhunī?”

“I don’t approve of anyone’s creed, friend.”

> 544 “Under whom have you shaved your head?  
>   
> You do appear to be an ascetic,  
>   
> Yet you don’t approve of any creed,  
>   
> So why wander as if bewildered?”

\[The bhikkhunī Sīsupacālā:\]

> 545 “Outside here the followers of creeds  
>   
> Place their confidence in views.  
>   
> I don’t approve of their teachings;  
>   
> They are not skilled in the Dhamma. \[134\]

>   
> The Enlightened One, without an equal,   
>   
> Conqueror of all, Māra’s subduer,  
>   
> Who everywhere is undefeated,  
>   
> Everywhere freed and unattached,  
>   
> The One with Vision who sees all.

>   
> Liberated in the extinction of acquisitions,  
>   
> That Blessed One is my Teacher:  
>   
> His is the teaching I approve.”

Then Māra the Evil One, realizing, “The bhikkhunī Sīsupacālā knows me,” sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.
