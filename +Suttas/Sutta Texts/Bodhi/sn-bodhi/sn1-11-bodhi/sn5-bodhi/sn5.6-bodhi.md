# SN5.6 Cālā

At Sāvatthī. Then, in the morning, the bhikkhunī Cālā dressed … she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day’s abiding.

Then Māra the Evil One approached the bhikkhunī Cālā and said to her: “What don’t you approve of, bhikkhunī?”

“I don’t approve of birth, friend.”

> 536 “Why don’t you approve of birth?  
>   
> Once born, one enjoys sensual pleasures.  
>   
> Who now has persuaded you of this:  
>   
> ‘Bhikkhunī, don’t approve of birth’?”

\[The bhikkhunī Cālā:\]

> 537 “For one who is born there is death;  
>   
> Once born, one encounters sufferings—  
>   
> Bondage, murder, affliction—  
>   
> Hence one shouldn’t approve of birth.
>

> 538 “The Buddha has taught the Dhamma,   
>   
> The transcendence of birth;  
>   
> For the abandoning of all suffering  
>   
> He has settled me in the truth. \[133\]

>   
> And those who abide in the formless—  
>   
> Not having understood cessation,  
>   
> They come again to renewed existence.”

Then Māra the Evil One, realizing, “The bhikkhunī Cālā knows me,” sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.
