# SN2.18 Kakudha

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāketa in the Añjana Grove, the Deer Park. Then, when the night had advanced, the young deva Kakudha,  of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Añjana Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, stood to one side, and said to him:

“Do you delight, ascetic?”

“Having gained what, friend?”

“Then, ascetic, do you sorrow?”

“What has been lost, friend?”

“Then, ascetic, do you neither delight nor sorrow?”

“Yes, friend.”

> 305 “I hope that you’re untroubled, bhikkhu.  
>   
> I hope no delight is found in you.  
>   
> I hope that when you sit all alone  
>   
> Discontent doesn’t spread over you.”

>   
> Yet no delight is found in me.  
>   
> And when I’m sitting all alone

> Discontent doesn’t spread over me.”

> How is no delight found in you?

> How come, when you sit all alone,

> Discontent doesn’t spread over you?”

> 308 “Delight comes to one who is miserable,  
>   
> Misery to one filled with delight.

> As a bhikkhu undelighted, untroubled:

> That’s how you should know me, friend.”

> A brahmin who is fully quenched,  
>   
> A bhikkhu undelighted, untroubled,  
>   
> Who has crossed over attachment to the world.”
