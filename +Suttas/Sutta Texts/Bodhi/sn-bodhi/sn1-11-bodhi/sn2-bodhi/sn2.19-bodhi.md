# SN2.19 Uttara

Setting at Rājagaha. Standing to one side, the young deva Uttara recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One: \[55\] 

> 310 “Life is swept along, short is the life span;  
>   
> No shelters exist for one who has reached old age.  
>   
> Seeing clearly this danger in death,  
>   
> One should do deeds of merit that bring happiness.”
