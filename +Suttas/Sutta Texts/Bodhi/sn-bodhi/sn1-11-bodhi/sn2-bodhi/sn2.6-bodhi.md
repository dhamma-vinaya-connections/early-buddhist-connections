# SN2.6 Kāmada

At Sāvatthī. Standing to one side, the young deva Kāmada said to the Blessed One:

“Hard to do, Blessed One! Very hard to do, Blessed One!”

> 265 “They do even what is hard to do,  
>   
> \[O Kāmada,” said the Blessed One,\]  
>   
> “The trainees endowed with virtue, steadfast.  
>   
> For one who has entered the homeless life  
>   
> Contentment brings along happiness.”

“That is hard to gain, Blessed One, namely, contentment.”

> 266 “They gain even what is hard to gain,  
>   
> \[O Kāmada,” said the Blessed One,\]  
>   
> “Who delight in calming the mind,  
>   
> Whose minds, day and night,  
>   
> Take delight in development.”

“That is hard to concentrate, Blessed One, namely, the mind.”

> 267 “They concentrate even what is hard to concentrate,  
>   
> \[O Kāmada,” said the Blessed One,\]  
>   
> “Who delight in calming the faculties.  
>   
> Having cut through the net of Death,  
>   
> The noble ones, O Kāmada, go their way.”

“The path is impassable and uneven, Blessed One.” 

> 268 “Though the path is impassable and uneven,  
>   
> The noble ones walk it, Kāmada.  
>   
> The ignoble ones fall down head first,  
>   
> Right there on the uneven path,  
>   
> But the path of the noble ones is even,  
>   
> For the noble are even amidst the uneven.”
