# SN2.4 Māgadha

At Sāvatthī. Standing to one side, the young deva Māgadha addressed the Blessed One in verse:

> 259 “How many sources of light are in the world  
>   
> By means of which the world is illumined?   
>   
> We’ve come to ask the Blessed One this:  
>   
> How are we to understand it?”
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 260 “There are four sources of light in the world;  
>   
> A fifth one is not found here.  
>   
> The sun shines by day,  
>   
> The moon glows at night,  
>   
> 261 And fire flares up here and there  
>   
> Both by day and at night.  
>   
> But the Buddha is the best of those that shine:  
>   
> He is the light unsurpassed.”
