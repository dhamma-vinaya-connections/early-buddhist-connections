# SN2.16 Vasudatta

Standing to one side, the young deva Vasudatta recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 301 “As if smitten by a sword,  
>   
> As if his head were on fire,  
>   
> A bhikkhu should wander mindfully  
>   
> To abandon sensual lust.”

> As if his head were on fire,  
>   
> A bhikkhu should wander mindfully  
>   
> To abandon identity view.”
