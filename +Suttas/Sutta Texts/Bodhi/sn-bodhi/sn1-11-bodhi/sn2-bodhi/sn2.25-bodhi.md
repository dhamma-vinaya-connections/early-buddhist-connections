# SN2.25 Jantu

Thus have I heard. On one occasion a number of bhikkhus were dwelling among the Kosalans in a little forest hut on a slope of the Himalayas—restless, puffed up, personally vain, rough-tongued, rambling in their talk, muddle-minded, without clear comprehension, unconcentrated, scatter-brained, loose in their sense faculties.

Then, on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, the young deva Jantu approached those bhikkhus and addressed them in verses:

> 353 “In the past the bhikkhus lived happily,  
>   
> The disciples of Gotama.  
>   
> Without wishes they sought their alms,  
>   
> Without wishes they used their lodgings.  
>   
> Having known the world’s impermanence,  
>   
> They made an end to suffering.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 354 “But now like headmen in a village  
>   
> They make themselves hard to maintain.  
>   
> They eat and eat and then lie down,   
>   
> Infatuated in others’ homes. 
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 355 “Having reverently saluted the Saṅgha,  
>   
> I here speak only about some:  
>   
> They are rejected, without protector,  
>   
> Become just like the dead.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 356 “My statement is made with reference  
>   
> To those who dwell in negligence.  
>   
> As for those who dwell in diligence,  
>   
> To them I humbly pay homage.”
