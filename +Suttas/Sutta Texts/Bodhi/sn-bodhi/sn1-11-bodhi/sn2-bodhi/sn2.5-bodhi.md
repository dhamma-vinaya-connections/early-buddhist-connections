# SN2.5 Dāmali

At Sāvatthī. Then, when the night had advanced, the young deva Dāmali, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, stood to one side, and recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 262 “This should be done by the brahmin:  
>   
> Striving without weariness,   
>   
> That by his abandoning of sensual desires  
>   
> He does not yearn for existence.”
>

> 
> 263 “For the brahmin there is no task to be done,  
>   
> \[O Dāmali,” said the Blessed One\],  
>   
> “For the brahmin has done what should be done.  
>   
> While he has not gained a footing in the river, \[48\]  
>   
> A man will strain with all his limbs;  
>   
> But a footing gained, standing on the ground,  
>   
> He need not strain for he has gone beyond.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 264 “This is a simile for the brahmin, O Dāmali,  
>   
> For the taintless one, the discreet meditator.  
>   
> Having reached the end of birth and death,  
>   
> He need not strain for he has gone beyond.”
