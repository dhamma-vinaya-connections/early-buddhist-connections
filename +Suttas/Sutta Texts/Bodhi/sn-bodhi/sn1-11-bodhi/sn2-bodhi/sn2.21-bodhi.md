# SN2.21 Siva

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, when the night had advanced, the young deva Siva, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, stood to one side, and recited these verses in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 320 “One should associate only with the good;  
>   
> With the good one should foster intimacy.  
>   
> Having learnt the true Dhamma of the good,  
>   
> One becomes better, never worse. 
>

> 321 “One should associate only with the good;  
>   
> With the good one should foster intimacy.  
>   
> Having learnt the true Dhamma of the good,  
>   
> Wisdom is gained, but not from another.
> 
>   
>

> 322 “One should associate only with the good;  
>   
> With the good one should foster intimacy.  
>   
> Having learnt the true Dhamma of the good,  
>   
> One does not sorrow in the midst of sorrow.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 323 “One should associate only with the good;  
>   
> With the good one should foster intimacy. \[57\]  
>   
> Having learnt the true Dhamma of the good,  
>   
> One shines amidst one’s relations.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 324 “One should associate only with the good;  
>   
> With the good one should foster intimacy.  
>   
> Having learnt the true Dhamma of the good,  
>   
> Beings fare on to a good destination.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 325 “One should associate only with the good;  
>   
> With the good one should foster intimacy.  
>   
> Having learnt the true Dhamma of the good,  
>   
> Beings abide comfortably.” 

Then the Blessed One replied to the young deva Siva in verse:

> 326 “One should associate only with the good;  
>   
> With the good one should foster intimacy.  
>   
> Having learnt the true Dhamma of the good,  
>   
> One is released from all suffering.”
