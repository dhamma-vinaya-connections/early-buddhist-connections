# SN2.29 Susīma

At Sāvatthī. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him: “Do you too, Ānanda, approve of Sāriputta?”

“Indeed, venerable sir, who would not approve of the Venerable Sāriputta, unless he were foolish, full of hatred, deluded, or mentally deranged? The Venerable Sāriputta, venerable sir, is wise, one of great wisdom, of wide wisdom, of joyous wisdom, of swift wisdom, of sharp wisdom, of penetrative wisdom. The Venerable Sāriputta, venerable sir, has few wishes; he is content, secluded, aloof, energetic. The Venerable Sāriputta, venerable sir, is one who gives advice, one who accepts advice, a reprover, one who censures evil. Indeed, venerable sir, who would not approve of the Venerable Sāriputta, unless he were foolish, full of hatred, deluded, or mentally deranged?” \[64\]

“So it is, Ānanda, so it is! Indeed, Ānanda, who would not approve of Sāriputta, unless he were foolish, full of hatred, deluded, or mentally deranged? Sāriputta, Ānanda, is wise ... (as above) … unless he were mentally deranged?”

Then, while this praise of the Venerable Sāriputta was being spoken, the young deva Susīma, accompanied by a great assembly of young devas, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, stood to one side, and said to him: “So it is, Blessed One! So it is, Fortunate One! Indeed, venerable sir, who would not approve of the Venerable Sāriputta … (all as above) … unless he were mentally deranged? In my case too, venerable sir, no matter what assembly of young devas I have approached, I have often heard this same report: ‘The Venerable Sāriputta is wise … one who censures evil. Indeed, who would not approve of the Venerable Sāriputta, unless he were foolish, full of hatred, deluded, or mentally deranged?’”

Then, while this praise of the Venerable Sāriputta was being spoken, the young devas in Susīma’s assembly—elated, gladdened, full of rapture and joy—displayed diverse lustrous colours. Just as a beryl gem—beautiful, of fine quality, eight-faceted, of excellent workmanship—when placed on a brocade cloth, shines and beams and radiates,  so too the young devas in Susīma’s assembly \[65\] … displayed diverse lustrous colours.

And just as an ornament of finest gold—very skilfully burnished in a furnace by an adroit goldsmith—when placed on a brocade cloth, shines and beams and radiates, so too the young devas in Susīma’s assembly … displayed diverse lustrous colours.

And just as, when the night is fading, the morning star shines and beams and radiates, so too the young devas in Susīma’s assembly ... displayed diverse lustrous colours.

And just as in the autumn, when the sky is clear and cloudless, the sun, ascending in the sky,  dispels all darkness from space as it shines and beams and radiates, so too the young devas in Susīma’s assembly—elated, gladdened, full of rapture and joy—displayed diverse lustrous colours.

Then, with reference to the Venerable Sāriputta, the young deva Susīma recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 363 “He is widely known to be a wise man,  
>   
> Sāriputta, who is free of anger;  
>   
> Of few wishes, gentle, tamed,  
>   
> The seer adorned by the Teacher’s praise.”

Then the Blessed One, with reference to the Venerable Sāriputta, replied to the young deva Susīma in verse:

> 364 “He is widely known to be a wise man,  
>   
> Sāriputta, who is free of anger;  
>   
> Of few wishes, gentle, tamed,  
>   
> Developed, well tamed, he awaits the time.”
