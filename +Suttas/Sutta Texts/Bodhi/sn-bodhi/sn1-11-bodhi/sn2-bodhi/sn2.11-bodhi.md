# SN2.11 Candimasa

At Sāvatthī. Then, when the night had advanced, the young deva Candimasa, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, \[52\] approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, stood to one side,  and recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 290 “They will surely reach to safety  
>   
> Like deer in a mosquito-free marsh,  
>   
> Who, having attained the jhānas,  
>   
> Are unified, discreet, mindful.”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 291 “They will surely reach the far shore  
>   
> Like a fish when the net is cut,  
>   
> Who, having attained the jhānas,  
>   
> Are diligent, with flaws discarded.”
