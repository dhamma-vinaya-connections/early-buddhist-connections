# SN2.9 Candimā

At Sāvatthī. Now on that occasion the young deva Candimā had been seized by Rāhu, lord of the asuras. Then, recollecting the Blessed One, the young deva Candimā on that occasion recited this verse:

> 281 “Let homage be to you, the Buddha!  
>   
> O hero, you are everywhere released.  
>   
> I have fallen into captivity,  
>   
> So please be my refuge.”

Then, referring to the young deva Candimā, the Blessed One addressed Rāhu, lord of the asuras, in verse:

> 282 “Candimā has gone for refuge  
>   
> To the Tathāgata, the Arahant.  
>   
> Release Candimā, O Rāhu,  
>   
> Buddhas have compassion for the world.”

Then Rāhu, lord of the asuras, released the young deva Candimā and hurriedly approached Vepacitti, lord of the asuras. Having approached, shocked and terrified, he stood to one side.  Then, as he stood there, Vepacitti, lord of the asuras, addressed him in verse:

> 283 “Why, Rāhu, did you come in a hurry?  
>   
> Why did you release Candimā?  
>   
> Having come as if in shock,  
>   
> Why do you stand there frightened?”
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 284 “My head would have split in seven parts,  
>   
> While living I would have found no ease,  
>   
> If, when chanted over by the Buddha’s verse,  
>   
> I had not let go of Candimā.” \[51\]
