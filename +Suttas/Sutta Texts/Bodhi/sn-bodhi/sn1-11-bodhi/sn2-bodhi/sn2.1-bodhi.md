# SN2.1 Kassapa (1)

1Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Then, when the night had advanced, the young deva Kassapa, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, approached the Blessed One.
 Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, stood to one side, and said to the Blessed One:

"The Blessed One has revealed the bhikkhu but not the instruction to the bhikkhu."

"Well then, Kassapa, clear up this point yourself."

2v.255 "He should train in well-spoken counsel,
And in the exercise of an ascetic,
In a solitary seat, alone,
And in the calming of the mind."

3This is what the young deva Kassapa said. The Teacher approved. Then the young deva Kassapa, thinking, "The Teacher has approved of me," paid homage to the Blessed One and, keeping him on the right, he disappeared right there.
