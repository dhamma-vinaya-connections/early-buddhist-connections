# SN2.15 Candana

Standing to one side, the young deva Candana addressed the Blessed One in verse:

> 298 “Who here crosses over the flood,  
>   
> Unwearying by day and night?  
>   
> Who does not sink in the deep,  
>   
> Without support, without a hold?”
> 
> >

> 299 “One always perfect in virtue,  
>   
> Endowed with wisdom, well concentrated,  
>   
> One energetic and resolute  
>   
> Crosses the flood so hard to cross.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 300 “One who desists from sensual perception,  
>   
> Who has overcome the fetter of form,   
>   
> Who has destroyed delight in existence—  
>   
> He does not sink in the deep.”
