# SN2.8 Tāyana

At Sāvatthī. Then, when the night had advanced, the young deva Tāyana, formerly the founder of a religious sect, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, stood to one side, and recited these verses in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 271 “Having exerted oneself, cut the stream!  
>   
> Dispel sensual desires, O brahmin!  
>   
> Without having abandoned sensual desires,  
>   
> A sage does not reach unity.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 272 “If one would do what should be done,  
>   
> One should firmly exert oneself.   
>   
> For a slack wanderer’s life  
>   
> Only scatters more dust.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 273 “Better left undone is the misdeed,  
>   
> A deed that later brings repentance.  
>   
> Better done is the good deed  
>   
> Which when done is not repented.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 274 “As kusa\-grass, wrongly grasped,  
>   
> Only cuts one’s hand,  
>   
> So the ascetic life, wrongly taken up,  
>   
> Drags one down to hell.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 275 “Any deed that is slackly done,  
>   
> Any corrupted vow,  
>   
> A holy life that breeds suspicion,  
>   
> Does not yield great fruit.”

This is what the young deva Tāyana said. Having said this, he paid homage to the Blessed One and, keeping him on the right, he disappeared right there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, last night, when the night had advanced, the young deva Tāyana, formerly the founder of a religious sect ...  ... approached me ... and in my presence recited these verses:

> 276–80 “‘Having exerted oneself, cut the stream!… \[50\] …  
>   
> Does not yield great fruit.’

“This is what the young deva Tāyana said. Having said this, he paid homage to me and, keeping me on the right, he disappeared right there. Learn Tāyana’s verses, bhikkhus. Master  Tāyana’s verses, bhikkhus. Remember Tāyana’s verses, bhikkhus. Tāyana’s verses are beneficial, bhikkhus, they pertain to the fundamentals of the holy life.”
