# SN2.22 Khema

Standing to one side, the young deva Khema recited these verses in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 327 “Foolish people devoid of wisdom  
>   
> Behave like enemies towards themselves.  
>   
> They go about doing evil deeds  
>   
> Which yield only bitter fruit.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 328 “That deed is not well performed  
>   
> Which, having been done, is then repented,  
>   
> The result of which one experiences  
>   
> Weeping with a tearful face.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 329 “But that deed is well performed  
>   
> Which, having been done, is not repented,  
>   
> The result of which one experiences  
>   
> Joyfully with a happy mind.” 

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 330 “One should promptly do the deed  
>   
> One knows leads to one’s own welfare;  
>   
> The thinker, the wise one, should not advance  
>   
> With the reflection of the carter.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 331 “As the carter who left the highway,  
>   
> A road with an even surface,  
>   
> And entered upon a rugged bypath  
>   
> Broods mournfully with a broken axle—
> 
> 332 “So the fool, having left the Dhamma  
>   
> To follow a way opposed to Dhamma,  
>   
> When he falls into the mouth of Death  
>   
> Broods like the carter with a broken axle.”
