# SN2.14 Nandana

Standing to one side, the young deva Nandana addressed the Blessed One in verse:

> 295 “I ask you, Gotama, broad of wisdom—  
>   
> Unobstructed is the Blessed One’s knowledge and vision:  
>   
> \[53\]  
>   
> What is he like whom they call virtuous?  
>   
> What is he like whom they call wise?  
>   
> What is he like who has passed beyond suffering?  
>   
> What is he like whom the devatās worship?”
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 296 “One virtuous, wise, of developed mind,  
>   
> Concentrated, mindful, enjoying jhāna,  
>   
> For whom all sorrows are gone, abandoned,  
>   
> A taint-destroyer bearing his final body:
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 297 It is such a one that they call virtuous,   
>   
> Such a one that they call wise,  
>   
> Such a one has passed beyond suffering,  
>   
> Such a one the devatās worship.”
