# SN6.13 Andhakavinda

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Magadhans at Andhakavinda. Now on that occasion the Blessed One was sitting out in the open in the thick darkness of the night while it was drizzling. Then, when the night had advanced, Brahmā Sahampati … approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, he recited these verses in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 598 “One should resort to remote lodgings,  
>   
> Practise for release from the fetters.  
>   
> But if one does not find delight there,  
>   
> Guarded and mindful, dwell in the Saṅgha. 
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 599 “Walking for alms from family to family,  
>   
> Faculties guarded, discreet, mindful,  
>   
> One should resort to remote lodgings,  
>   
> Freed from fear, liberated in the fearless.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 600 “Where terrible serpents glide,  
>   
> Where lightning flashes and the sky thunders,  
>   
> In the thick darkness of the night  
>   
> There sits a bhikkhu devoid of terror.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 601 “For this has actually been seen by me,  
>   
> It is not merely hearsay:  
>   
> Within a single holy life  
>   
> A thousand have left Death behind.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 602 “There are five hundred more trainees,  
>   
> And ten times a tenfold ten:  
>   
> All have entered the stream,  
>   
> Never returning to the animal realm.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 603 “As for the other people who remain—  
>   
> Who, to my mind, partake of merit—  
>   
> I cannot even number them  
>   
> From dread of speaking falsely.” \[155\]
