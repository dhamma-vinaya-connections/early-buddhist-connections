# SN6.7 Kokālika (1)

At Sāvatthī. Now on that occasion the Blessed One had gone for his day’s abiding and was in seclusion. Then the independent brahmās Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa approached the Blessed One and stood one at each doorpost. Then, referring to the bhikkhu Kokālika, the independent brahmā Subrahmā recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 586 “What wise man here would seek to define  
>   
> An immeasurable one by taking his measure?   
>   
> He who would measure an immeasurable one  
>   
> Must be, I think, an obstructed worldling.ʺ
