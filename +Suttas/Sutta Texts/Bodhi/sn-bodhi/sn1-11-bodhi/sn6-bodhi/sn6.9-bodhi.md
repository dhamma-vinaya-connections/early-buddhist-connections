# SN6.9 Brahmā Tudu

At Sāvatthī. Now on that occasion the bhikkhu Kokālika was sick , afflicted , gravely ill . Then , when the night had advanced, the independent brahmā Tudu, of stunning beauty, advanced, the independent brahma Tudu, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the bhikkhu Kokālika. Having approached, he stood in the air and said to the bhi kkhu Kokālika : “Placeconfidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, Kokālika. Sāriputta and Moggallāna are well behaved.”

“Who are you, friend?”

“I am the independent brahmā Tudu.”

“Didn’t the Blessed One declare you to be a nonreturner, friend? Then why have you come back here? See how far you have transgressed.”
