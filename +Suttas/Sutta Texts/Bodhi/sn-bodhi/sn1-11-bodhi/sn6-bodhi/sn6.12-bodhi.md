# SN6.12 Devadatta

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak not long after Devadatta had left.  Then, when the night had advanced, Brahmā Sahampati, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Mount Vulture Peak, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. \[154\] Standing to one side, referring to Devadatta, he recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

> 597 “As its own fruit brings destruction  
>   
> To the plantain, bamboo, and reed,  
>   
> As its embryo destroys the mule,   
>   
> So do honours destroy the scoundrel.”
