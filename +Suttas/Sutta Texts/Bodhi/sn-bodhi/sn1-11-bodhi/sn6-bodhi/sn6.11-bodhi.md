# SN6.11 Sanaṅkumāra

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on the bank of the river Sappinī. Then, when the night had advanced, Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire bank of the river Sappinī, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, he recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One: 

> 596 “The khattiya is the best among people  
>   
> For those whose standard is the clan,  
>   
> But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct  
>   
> Is best among devas and humans.”

This is what Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra said. The Teacher approved. Then Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra, thinking, “The Teacher has approved of me,” paid homage to the Blessed One and, keeping him on his right, he disappeared right there.
