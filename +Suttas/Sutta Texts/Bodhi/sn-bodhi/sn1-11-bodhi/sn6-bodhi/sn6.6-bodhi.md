# SN6.6 A Brahmā World (Negligence)

At Sāvatthī. Now on that occasion the Blessed One had gone for his day’s abiding and was in seclusion. Then the independent brahmās Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa approached the Blessed One and stood one at each doorpost. Then the independent brahmā Subrahmā said to the independent brahmā Suddhāvāsa:  “It is not the right time, dear sir, to visit the Blessed One. The Blessed One has gone for his day’s abiding and is in seclusion. Such and such a brahmā world is rich and prosperous, and the brahmā there is dwelling in negligence. Come, dear sir, let us go to that brahmā world and stir up a sense of urgency in that brahmā.” \[147\]

“Yes, dear sir,” the independent brahmā Suddhāvāsa replied.

Then, just as quickly as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the independent brahmās Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa disappeared in front of the Blessed One and reappeared in that brahmā world. That brahmā saw those brahmās coming in the distance and said to them: “Now where are you coming from, dear sirs?” 

“We have come, dear sir, from the presence of the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. Dear sir, you should go to attend upon that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One.”

When this was said, that brahmā refused to accept their advice. Having created a thousand transformations of himself, he said to the independent brahmā Subrahmā:  “Do you see, dear sir, how much power and might I have?”

“I see, dear sir, that you have so much power and might.”

“But, dear sir, when I am so powerful and mighty, what other ascetic or brahmin should I go to attend upon?”

Then the independent brahmā Subrahmā, having created two thousand transformations of himself, said to that brahmā: “Do you see, dear sir, how much power and might I have?”

“I see, dear sir, that you have so much power and might.”

“That Blessed One, dear sir, is still more powerful and mighty than both you and I. You should go, dear sir, to attend upon that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One.”

Then that brahmā addressed the independent brahmā Subrahmā in verse: \[148\]

> 584 “Three \[hundred\] supaṇṇas, four \[hundred\] geese,  
>   
> And five hundred falcons:  
>   
> This palace, O Brahmā, of the meditator shines  
>   
> Illuminating the northern quarter.”

\[The independent brahmā Subrahmā:\]

> 585 “Even though that palace of yours shines  
>   
> Illuminating the northern quarter,   
>   
> Having seen form’s flaw, its chronic trembling,  
>   
> The wise one takes no delight in form.”

Then the independent brahmās Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa, having stirred up a sense of urgency in that brahmā, disappeared right there. And on a later occasion that brahmā went to attend upon the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One.
