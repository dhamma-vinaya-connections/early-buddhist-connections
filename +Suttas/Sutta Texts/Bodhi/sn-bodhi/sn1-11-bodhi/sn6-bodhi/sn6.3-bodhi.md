# SN6.3 Brahmadeva

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now on that occasion a certain brahmin lady had a son named Brahmadeva  who had gone forth from the household life into homelessness under the Blessed One.

Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute, the Venerable Brahmadeva, by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life entered and dwelt in that unsurpassed goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness. He directly knew: “Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.” And the Venerable Brahmadeva became one of the arahants.

Then, in the morning, the Venerable Brahmadeva dressed and, taking bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Walking on continuous alms round in Sāvatthī, he came to his own mother’s residence. \[141\] Now on that occasion the brahmin lady, the Venerable Brahmadeva’s mother, had been offering a constant oblation to Brahmā. Then it occurred to Brahmā Sahampati: “This brahmin lady, the Venerable Brahmadeva’s mother, has been offering a constant oblation to Brahmā. Let me approach her and stir up a sense of urgency in her.”

Then,  just as quickly as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, Brahmā Sahampati disappeared from the brahmā world and reappeared in the residence of the Venerable Brahmadeva’s mother. Then, standing in the air, Brahmā Sahampati addressed the brahmin lady in verse:

> 565 “Far from here, madam, is the brahmā world  
>   
> To which you offer a constant oblation.  
>   
> Brahmā does not eat such food, lady:  
>   
> So why mumble, not knowing the path to Brahmā?
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 566 “This Brahmadeva, madam,  
>   
> Without acquisitions, has surpassed the devas.  
>   
> Owning nothing, nourishing no other,  
>   
> The bhikkhu has entered your house for alms.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 567 “Gift-worthy, knowledge-master, inwardly developed,  
>   
>   
>   
> He deserves offerings from humans and devas.  
>   
> Having expelled all evil, unsullied,  
>   
> Cooled at heart, he comes seeking alms.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 568 “For him there is nothing behind or in front—  
>   
> Peaceful, smokeless, untroubled, wishless;  
>   
> He has laid down the rod towards frail and firm:  
>   
> Let him eat your oblation, the choicest alms.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 569 “Aloof from the crowd, with peaceful mind,  
>   
> Like a nāga he fares, tamed, unstirred.  
>   
> A bhikkhu of pure virtue, well liberated in mind:  
>   
> Let him eat your oblation, the choicest alms.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 570 “With confidence in him, free from wavering, \[142\]  
>   
> Present your offering to one who deserves it.  
>   
> Having seen a sage who has crossed the flood,  
>   
> O madam, make merit leading to future bliss.” 
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 571 With confidence in him, free from wavering,  
>   
> She presented her offering to one who deserved it.  
>   
> Having seen a sage who has crossed the flood,  
>   
> The lady made merit leading to future bliss.
