# SN6.5 A Certain Brahmā (Another View)

At Sāvatthī. Now on that occasion the following evil speculative view had arisen in a certain brahmā: “There is no ascetic or brahmin who can come here.” Then, having known with his own mind the reflection in that brahmā’s mind, just as quickly as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Blessed One disappeared from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that brahmā world. The Blessed One sat cross-legged in the air above that brahmā, having entered into meditation on the fire element.

Then it occurred to the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna: “Where now is the Blessed One dwelling at present?” With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna saw the Blessed One sitting cross-legged in the air above that brahmā, having entered into meditation on the fire element. Having seen this,  just as quickly as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna disappeared from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that brahmā world. Then the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna stationed himself in the eastern quarter and sat cross-legged in the air above that brahmā—though lower than the Blessed One—having entered into meditation on the fire element.

Then it occurred to the Venerable Mahākassapa: “Where now is the Blessed One dwelling at present?” With the divine eye … the Venerable Mahākassapa saw the Blessed One sitting cross-legged in the air above that brahmā…. Having seen this, … \[145\] the Venerable Mahākassapa disappeared from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that brahmā world. Then the Venerable Mahākassapa stationed himself in the southern quarter and sat cross-legged in the air above that brahmā—though lower than the Blessed One—having entered into meditation on the fire element.

Then it occurred to the Venerable Mahākappina: “Where now is the Blessed One dwelling at present?” With the divine eye … the Venerable Mahākappina saw the Blessed One sitting cross-legged in the air above that brahmā…. Having seen this, … the Venerable Mahākappina disappeared from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that brahmā world. Then the Venerable Mahākappina stationed himself in the western quarter  and sat cross-legged in the air above that brahmā—though lower than the Blessed One—having entered into meditation on the fire element.

Then it occurred to the Venerable Anuruddha: “Where now is the Blessed One dwelling at present?” With the divine eye … the Venerable Anuruddha saw the Blessed One sitting cross-legged in the air above that brahmā … . Having seen this, … the Venerable Anuruddha disappeared from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that brahmā world. Then the Venerable Anuruddha stationed himself in the northern quarter and sat cross-legged in the air above that brahmā—though lower than the Blessed One—having entered into meditation on the fire element.

Then the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed that brahmā in verse:

> 580 “Today, friend, do you still hold that view,  
>   
> The view that you formerly held?  
>   
> Do you see the radiance  
>   
> Surpassing that in the brahmā world?” 
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 581 “I no longer hold that view, dear sir,  
>   
> The view that I formerly held.  
>   
> Indeed I see the radiance  
>   
> Surpassing that in the brahmā world.  
>   
> Today how could I maintain,  
>   
> ‘I am permanent and eternal’?”

Then, having stirred up a sense of urgency in that brahmā, just as quickly as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Blessed One disappeared from that brahmā world and reappeared in Jeta’s Grove.

Then that brahmā addressed one member of his assembly thus: “Come now, dear sir, approach the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and say to him: ‘Sir Moggallāna, are there any other disciples of the Blessed One that are as powerful \[146\] and mighty as Masters Moggallāna, Kassapa, Kappina , and Anuruddha?’”

“Yes, dear sir,” that member of Brahmā’s assembly replied. Then he approached the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and asked him: “Sir Moggallāna, are there any other disciples of the Blessed One that are as powerful and mighty as Masters Moggallāna, Kassapa, Kappina, and Anuruddha?”

Then the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed that member of Brahmā’s assembly in verse:

> 582 “Many are the disciples of the Buddha  
>   
> Who are arahants with taints destroyed,  
>   
> Triple-knowledge bearers with spiritual powers,  
>   
> Skilled in the course of others’ minds.” 

Then that member of Brahmā’s assembly, having delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna’s statement, approached that brahmā and told him: “Dear sir, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna speaks thus:

> 583 “‘Many are the disciples of the Buddha …  
>   
> Skilled in the course of others’ minds.’”

This is what that member of Brahmā’s assembly said. Elated, that brahmā delighted in his statement.
