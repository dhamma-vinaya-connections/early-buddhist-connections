# SN10.5 Sānu

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now on that occasion a certain female lay follower had a son named Sānu who had been possessed by a yakkha. Then that female lay follower, lamenting, on that occasion recited these verses:

> 816 “With those who lead the holy life,  
>   
> Who observe the Uposatha days  
>   
> Complete in eight factors  
>   
> On the fourteenth or fifteenth,
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 817 And on the eighths of the fortnight,   
>   
> And during special periods,  
>   
> The yakkhas do not sport around:  
>   
> So I have heard from the arahants.  
>   
> But now today I see for myself  
>   
> The yakkhas sporting with Sānu.”

\[The yakkha that has entered Sānu:\] \[209\]

> 818 “With those who lead the holy life,  
>   
> Who observe the Uposatha days  
>   
> Complete in eight factors  
>   
> On the fourteenth or fifteenth,
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 819 And on the eighths of the fortnight,  
>   
> And during special periods,  
>   
> The yakkhas do not sport around:  
>   
> What you heard from the arahants is good.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 820 “When Sānu has awakened tell him  
>   
> This injunction of the yakkhas:   
>   
> Do not do an evil deed  
>   
> Either openly or in secret.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 821 If you should do an evil deed,  
>   
> Or if you are doing one now,  
>   
> You won’t be free from suffering  
>   
> Though you fly up and flee.”

\[Sānu:\]

> 822 “They weep, mother, for the dead  
>   
> Or for one living who isn’t seen.  
>   
> When you see, mother, that I’m alive,  
>   
> Why, O mother, do you weep for me?”

\[Sānu′s mother:\]

> 823 “They weep, O son, for the dead  
>   
> Or for one living who isn’t seen;  
>   
> But when one returns to the home life  
>   
> After renouncing sensual pleasures,  
>   
> They weep for this one too, my son,  
>   
> For though alive he’s really dead.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 824 “Drawn out, my dear, from hot embers,   
>   
> You wish to plunge into hot embers;  
>   
> Drawn out, my dear, from an inferno,  
>   
> You wish to plunge into an inferno.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 825 “Run forward, good luck be with you!  
>   
> To whom could we voice our grief?  
>   
> Being an item rescued from the fire,  
>   
> You wish to be burnt again.”
