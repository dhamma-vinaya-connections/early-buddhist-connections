# SN10.11 Cīrā

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Now on that occasion a certain lay follower gave a robe to the bhikkhunī Cīrā. Then a yakkha who had full confidence in the bhikkhunī Cīrā, going from street to street and from square to square in Rājagaha, on that occasion recited this verse:

> 845 “He has engendered much merit—  
>   
> Wise indeed is this lay follower,  
>   
> Who just gave a robe to Cīrā,  
>   
> One released from all the bonds.”
