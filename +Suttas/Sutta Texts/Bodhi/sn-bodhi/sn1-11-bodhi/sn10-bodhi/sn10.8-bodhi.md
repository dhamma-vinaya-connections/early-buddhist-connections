# SN10.8 Sudatta

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Cool Grove. Now on that occasion the householder Anāthapiṇḍika had arrived in Rājagaha on some business. He heard: “A Buddha, it is said, has arisen in the world!” He wanted to go and see the Blessed One immediately, \[211\] but it occurred to him: “It is not the right time to go and see the Blessed One today. I will go and see the Blessed One early tomorrow morning.”

He lay down with his mindfulness directed to the Buddha, and during the night he got up three times thinking it was morning. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the gate of the charnel ground. Nonhuman beings opened the gate.  Then, as the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was leaving the city, the light disappeared and darkness appeared. Fear, trepidation, and terror arose in him and he wanted to turn back. But the yakkha Sīvaka, invisible, made the proclamation:

> 837 “A hundred \[thousand\] elephants,  
>   
> A hundred \[thousand\] horses,  
>   
> A hundred \[thousand\] mule-drawn chariots,  
>   
> A hundred thousand maidens  
>   
> Adorned with jewellery and earrings,  
>   
> Are not worth a sixteenth part  
>   
> Of a single step forward.

“Go forward, householder! Go forward, householder! Going forward is better for you, not turning back again.”

Then the darkness disappeared and light appeared to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, and the fear, trepidation, and terror that had arisen in him subsided.

A second time … (verse 838 is included in this repetition)  … A third time the light disappeared and darkness appeared before the householder Anāthapiṇḍika. Fear, trepidation, and terror arose in him and he wanted to turn back. But a third time the yakkha Sīvaka, invisible, made the proclamation:

> 839 “A hundred \[thousand\] elephants …  
>   
> Of a single step forward.

“Go forward, householder! Go forward, householder! Going forward is better for you, not turning back again.”

Then the darkness \[212\] disappeared and light appeared to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, and the fear, trepidation, and terror that had arisen in him subsided.

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One in the Cool Grove. Now on that occasion the Blessed One, having risen at the first flush of dawn, was walking back and forth in the open. The Blessed One saw the householder Anāthapiṇḍika coming in the distance. He descended from the walkway, sat down in the seat that was prepared, and said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika: “Come, Sudatta.”

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, thinking, “The Blessed One has addressed me by my name,” \[thrilled and elated\], prostrated himself right on the spot with his head at the Blessed One’s feet  and said to him: “I hope, venerable sir, that the Blessed One slept well.”

  
  

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 840 “Always indeed he sleeps well,  
>   
> The brahmin who is fully quenched,  
>   
> Who does not cling to sensual pleasures,  
>   
> Cool at heart, without acquisitions.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 841 “Having cut off all attachments,  
>   
> Having removed care from the heart,  
>   
> The peaceful one sleeps well,  
>   
> Having attained peace of mind.”
