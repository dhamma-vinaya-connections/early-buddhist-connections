# SN10.4 Maṇibhadda

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Magadhans at the Maṇimālaka Shrine, the haunt of the yakkha Maṇibhadda. Then the yakkha Maṇibhadda approached the Blessed One and in the Blessed One’s presence recited this verse:

> 812 “It is always good for the mindful one,  
>   
> The mindful one thrives in happiness.  
>   
> It is better each day for the mindful one,  
>   
> And he is freed from enmity.”

\[The Blessed One:\] 

> 813 “It is always good for the mindful one,  
>   
> The mindful one thrives in happiness.  
>   
> It is better each day for the mindful one,  
>   
> But he is not freed from enmity.

>   
> Takes delight in harmlessness,  
>   
> Who has lovingkindness for all beings—  
>   
> For him there is enmity with none.”
