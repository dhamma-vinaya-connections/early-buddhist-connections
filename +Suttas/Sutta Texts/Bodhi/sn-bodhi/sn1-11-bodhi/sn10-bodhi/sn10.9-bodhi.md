# SN10.9 Sukkā (1)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Now on that occasion the bhikkhunī Sukkā, surrounded by a large assembly, was teaching the Dhamma. Then a yakkha who had full confidence in the bhikkhunī Sukkā, going from street to street and from square to square in Rājagaha, on that occasion recited these verses:

> 842 “What has happened to these people in Rājagaha?   
>   
> They sleep as if they’ve been drinking mead.  
>   
> Why don’t they attend on Sukkā  
>   
> As she teaches the deathless state?
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 843 “But the wise, as it were, drink it up—  
>   
> That \[Dhamma\] irresistible,  
>   
> Ambrosial, nutritious—  
>   
> As travellers do a cloud.”
