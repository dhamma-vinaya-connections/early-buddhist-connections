# SN10.12 Āḷavaka

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Āḷavī, the haunt of the yakkha Āḷavaka. Then the yakkha Āḷavaka approached the Blessed One and said to him: “Get out, ascetic!” 

“All right, friend,” the Blessed One said, and he went out.

“Come in, ascetic.”

“All right, friend,” the Blessed One said, and he went in.

A second time … \[214\] A third time the yakkha Āḷavaka said to the Blessed One: “Get out, ascetic!”

“All right, friend,” the Blessed One said, and he went out.

“Come in, ascetic.”

“All right, friend,” the Blessed One said, and he went in.

A fourth time the yakkha Āḷavaka said to the Blessed One: “Get out, ascetic.”

“I won’t go out, friend. Do whatever you have to do.”

“I’ll ask you a question, ascetic. If you won’t answer me, I’ll drive you insane or I’ll split your heart or I’ll grab you by the feet and hurl you across the Ganges.”

“I do not see anyone in this world, friend, with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, who could drive me insane or split my heart or grab me by the feet and hurl me across the Ganges. But ask whatever you want, friend.”

\[The Blessed One:\]
