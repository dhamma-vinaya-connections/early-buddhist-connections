# SN10.1 Indaka

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Inda’s Peak, the haunt of the yakkha Indaka. Then the yakkha Indaka approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:

> 802 “As the Buddhas say that form is not the soul,  
>   
> How then does one obtain this body?  
>   
> From where do one’s bones and liver come?  
>   
> How is one begotten in the womb?”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 803 “First there is the kalala;  
>   
> From the kalala comes the abbuda;  
>   
> From the abbuda the pesī is produced;  
>   
> From the pesī the ghana arises;  
>   
> From the ghana emerge the limbs,  
>   
> The head-hair, body-hair, and nails. 
> 
> 804 And whatever food the mother eats—  
>   
> The meals and drink that she consumes—  
>   
> By this the being there is maintained,  
>   
> The person inside the mother’s womb.”
