# SN10.2 Sakkanāmaka

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Then the yakkha Sakkanāmaka approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:

> 805 “Having abandoned all the knots  
>   
> As one fully released,  
>   
> It isn’t good for you, an ascetic,  
>   
> To be instructing others.”

\[The Blessed One:\]

> 806 “If, O Sakka, for some reason  
>   
> Intimacy with anyone should arise,  
>   
> The wise man ought not to stir his mind  
>   
> With compassion towards such a person.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 807 “But if with a mind clear and pure  
>   
> He gives instructions to others,  
>   
> He does not become fettered   
>   
> By his compassion and sympathy.” \[207\]
