# SN10.7 Punabbasu

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. \[210\] Now on that occasion the Blessed One was instructing, exhorting, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk concerning Nibbāna. And those bhikkhus were listening to the Dhamma with eager ears, attending to it as a matter of vital concern, applying their whole mind to it. Then the female yakkha Punabbasu’s Mother hushed her little children thus:

> 828 “Be quiet, Uttarikā,  
>   
> Be quiet, Punabbasu!   
>   
> I wish to listen to the Dhamma  
>   
> Of the Teacher, the Supreme Buddha.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 829 “When the Blessed One speaks of Nibbāna,  
>   
> Release from all the knots,  
>   
> There has arisen within me  
>   
> Deep affection for this Dhamma.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 830 “In the world one’s own son is dear,  
>   
> In the world one’s own husband is dear;  
>   
> But for me the quest for this Dhamma  
>   
> Has become even dearer than them.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 831 “For neither one’s own son nor husband,  
>   
> Though dear, can release one from suffering  
>   
> As listening to true Dhamma frees one  
>   
> From the suffering of living beings.
> 
>   
>   
> 
> 832 “In this world steeped in suffering,  
>   
> Fettered by aging and death,  
>   
> I wish to listen to the Dhamma  
>   
> That he—the Buddha—fully awakened to,  
>   
> For freedom from aging and death.  
>   
> So be quiet, Punabbasu!” 

\[Punabbasu:\]

> 833 “Mother dear, I am not talking;  
>   
> This Uttarā is silent, too.  
>   
> Pay attention only to the Dhamma,  
>   
> For listening to true Dhamma is pleasant.  
>   
> Because we have not known true Dhamma  
>   
> We’ve been living miserably, mother.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 834 “He is the maker of light  
>   
> For bewildered devas and humans;  
>   
> Enlightened, bearing his final body,  
>   
> The One with Vision teaches the Dhamma.”

\[Punabbasu’s mother:\]

> 835 “It is good that my son has become so wise,  
>   
> He whom I bore and nursed at my breast.  
>   
> My son loves the pure Dhamma  
>   
> Of the Supremely Enlightened One.
> 
> >   
> >   
> 
> 836 “Punabbasu, be happy!  
>   
> Today I have emerged at last.   
>   
> Hear me too, O Uttarā:  
>   
> The noble truths are seen!”
