# SN10.10 Sukkā (2)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. \[213\] Now on that occasion a certain lay follower gave food to the bhikkhunī Sukkā. Then a yakkha who had full confidence in the bhikkhunī Sukkā, going from street to street and from square to square in Rājagaha, on that occasion recited this verse:

> 844 “He has engendered much merit—  
>   
> Wise indeed is this lay follower,  
>   
> Who just gave food to Sukkā,   
>   
> One released from all the knots.”
