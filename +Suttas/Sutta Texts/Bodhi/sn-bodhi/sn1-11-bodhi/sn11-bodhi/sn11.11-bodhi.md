# SN11.11 Vows

At Sāvatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, in the past, when Sakka, lord of the devas, was a human being, he adopted and undertook seven vows by the undertaking of which he achieved the status of Sakka. What were the seven vows?

(1) “‘As long as I live may I support my parents.’

(2) “‘As long as I live may I respect the family elders.’

(3) “‘As long as I live may I speak gently.’

(4) “‘As long as I live may I not speak divisively.’

(5) “‘As long as I live may I dwell at home with a mind devoid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing.’

(6) “‘As long as I live may I speak the truth.’

(7) “‘As long as I live may I be free from anger, and if anger should arise in me may I dispel it quickly.’

“In the past, bhikkhus, when Sakka, lord of the devas, was a human being, he adopted and undertook these seven vows by the undertaking of which he achieved the status of Sakka. 

> 904 “When a person supports his parents,  
> And respects the family elders;  
> When his speech is gentle and courteous,  
> And he refrains from divisive words;
>

> 
> 905 When he strives to remove meanness,  
> Is truthful, and vanquishes anger,  
> The Tāvatiṃsa devas call him  
> Truly a superior person.” \[229\]
