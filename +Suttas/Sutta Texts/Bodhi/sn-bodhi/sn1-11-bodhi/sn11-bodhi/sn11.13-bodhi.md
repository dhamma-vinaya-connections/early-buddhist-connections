# SN11.13 Mahāli

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālı̄ in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked Roof. Then Mahāli the Licchavi approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

“Venerable sir, has the Blessed One seen Sakka, lord of the devas?”

“I have, Mahāli.”

“Surely, venerable sir, that must have been one who looked like Sakka, lord of the devas; for Sakka, lord of the devas, is difficult to see.”

“I know Sakka, Mahāli, and I know the qualities that make for Sakka, by the undertaking of which Sakka achieved the status of Sakka. 

“In the past, Mahāli, when Sakka, lord of the devas, was a human being, he was a brahmin youth named Magha. Therefore he is called Maghavā….”

(Here follows the names of Sakka as in 11:12 and the seven vows as in 11:11, followed by verses 908-9 = 904-5.) \[231\]
