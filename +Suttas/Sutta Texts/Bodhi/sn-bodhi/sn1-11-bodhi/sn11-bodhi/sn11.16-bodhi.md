# SN11.16 Bestowing Alms

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Then Sakka, lord of the devas, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, he addressed the Blessed One in verse:

> 915 “For those people who bestow alms,  
> For living beings in quest of merit,  
> Performing merit of the mundane type,  
> Where does a gift bear great fruit?”

\[The Blessed One:\] 

> 916 “The four practising the way  
> And the four established in the fruit:  
> This is the Saṅgha of upright conduct  
> Endowed with wisdom and virtue.
> 
> >   
> 
> 917 “For those people who bestow alms,  
> For living beings in quest of merit,  
> Performing merit of the mundane type,  
> A gift to the Saṅgha bears great fruit.”
