# SN11.24 Transgression

At Sāvatthı̄. Now on that occasion two bhikkhus had a quarrel and one bhikkhu had transgressed against the other. Then the former bhikkhu confessed his transgression to the other bhikkhu, but the latter would not pardon him.

Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported to him what had happened.  \[The Blessed One said:\]

“Bhikkhus, there are two kinds of fools: one who does not see a transgression as a transgression; and one who, when another is confessing a transgression, does not pardon him in accordance with the Dhamma. These are the two kinds of fools.

“There are, bhikkhus, two kinds of wise people: one who sees a transgression as a transgression; and one who, when another is confessing a transgression, pardons him in accordance with the Dhamma. These are the two kinds of wise people.

“Once in the past, bhikkhus, Sakka, lord of the devas, instructing the Tāvatiṃsa devas in the Sudhamma assembly hall, on that occasion recited this verse: \[240\]

> 944 “‘Bring anger under your control;  
> Do not let your friendships decay.  
> Do not blame one who is blameless;  
> Do not utter divisive speech.  
> Like a mountain avalanche  
> Anger crushes evil people.’”
