# SN11.12 Sakka’s Names

At Sāvatthı̄ in Jeta’s Grove. There the Blessed One said to the bhikkhus:

“Bhikkhus, in the past, when Sakka, lord of the devas, was a human being, he was a brahmin youth named Magha; therefore he is called Maghavā.

“Bhikkhus, in the past, when Sakka, lord of the devas, was a human being, he gave gifts in city after city; therefore he is called Purindada, the Urban Giver.

“Bhikkhus, in the past, when Sakka, lord of the devas, was a human being, he gave gifts considerately; therefore he is called Sakka.

“Bhikkhus, in the past, when Sakka, lord of the devas, was a human being,  he gave a rest house; therefore he is called Vāsava.

“Bhikkhus, Sakka, lord of the devas, thinks of a thousand matters in a moment; therefore he is called Sahassakkha, Thousand-eyed.

“Bhikkhus, Sakka’s wife is the asura maiden named Sujā; therefore he is called Sujampati, Sujā’s husband.

“Bhikkhus, Sakka, lord of the devas, exercises supreme sovereignty and rulership over the Tāvatiṃsa devas; therefore he is called lord of the devas.

“Bhikkhus, in the past, when Sakka, lord of the devas, was a human being, he adopted and undertook seven vows by the undertaking of which he achieved the status of Sakka….”
