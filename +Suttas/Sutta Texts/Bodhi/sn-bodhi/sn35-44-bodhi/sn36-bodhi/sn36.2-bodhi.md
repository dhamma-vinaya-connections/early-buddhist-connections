# SN36.2 Pleasure

© Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Bodhi.  (More copyright information)
1"Bhikkhus, there are these three feelings. What three? Pleasant feeling, painful feeling, neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. These are the three feelings."
2Whether it be pleasant or painful
Along with the neither-painful-nor-pleasant,
Both the internal and the external,
Whatever kind of feeling there is:

3Having known, "This is suffering,
Perishable, disintegrating,"
Having touched and touched them, seeing their fall,
Thus one loses one's passion for them.
