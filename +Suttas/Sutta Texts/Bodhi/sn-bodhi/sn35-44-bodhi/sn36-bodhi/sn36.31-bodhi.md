# SN36.31 The Cause

“Bhikkhus, there are these five powers of a woman … the power of virtue.

“Bhikkhus, it is not because of the power of beauty, or the power of wealth, or the power of relatives, or the power of sons, that with the breakup of the body, after death, a woman is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. It is because of the power of virtue that a woman is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.

“These are the five powers of a woman.” \[249\]
