# SN41.5 Kāmabhū (1)

On one occasion the Venerable Kāmabhū was dwelling at Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. Then Citta the householder approached the Venerable Kāmabhū, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Venerable Kāmabhū then said to him: “This has been said, householder:

> “‘With faultless wheel and a white awning,  
>   
> The one-spoked chariot rolls.  
>   
> See it coming, trouble-free,  
>   
> The stream cut, without bondage.’

How, householder, should the meaning of this brief statement be understood in detail?”

“Was this stated by the Blessed One, venerable sir?”

“Yes, householder.”

“Then wait a moment, venerable sir, while I consider its meaning.”

Then, after a moment’s silence, Citta the householder said to the Venerable Kāmabhū: \[292\]

“‘Faultless’: this, venerable sir, is a designation for the virtues. ‘White awning’: this is a designation for liberation. ‘One spoke’: this is a designation for mindfulness. ‘Rolls’: this is a designation for going forward and returning. ‘Chariot’: this is a designation for this body consisting of the four great elements, originating from mother and father, built up out of rice and gruel, subject to impermanence, to being worn and rubbed away, to breaking apart and dispersal.

“Lust, venerable sir, is trouble; hatred is trouble; delusion is trouble. For a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed, these have been abandoned, cut off at the root, made like palm stumps, obliterated so that they are no more subject to future arising. Therefore the bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is called ‘trouble-free. ’ The ‘one who is coming’ is a designation for the arahant.

“‘The stream’: this, venerable sir, is a designation for craving. For a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed, this has been abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising. Therefore the bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is called ‘one with the stream cut.’

“Lust, venerable sir, is bondage; hatred is bondage; delusion is bondage. For a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed, these have been abandoned, cut off at the root, made like palm stumps, obliterated so that they are no more subject to future arising. Therefore the bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is called ‘one no more in bondage.’

  
  

“Thus, venerable sir, when it was said by the the Blessed One:

> “‘With faultless wheel and a white awning,  
>   
> The one-spoked chariot rolls.  
>   
> See it coming, trouble-free,  
>   
> The stream cut, without bondage’—

it is in such a way that I understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by the Blessed One in brief.”

“It is a gain for you, householder, it is well gained by you, householder, in that you have the eye of wisdom that ranges over the deep Word of the Buddha.” \[293\]
