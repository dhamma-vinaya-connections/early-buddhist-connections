# SN41.2 Isidatta (1)

On one occasion a number of elder bhikkhus were dwelling at Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. Then Citta the householder approached those elder bhikkhus, paid homage to them, sat down to one side, and said to them: “Venerable sirs, let the elders consent to accept tomorrow’s meal from me.”

The elder bhikkhus consented by silence. \[284\] Then Citta the householder, having understood that the elders had consented, rose from his seat, paid homage to them, and departed, keeping them on his right.

When the night had passed, in the morning the elder bhikkhus dressed, took their bowls and outer robes, and went to the residence of Citta the householder. There they sat down on the appointed seats. Then Citta the householder approached the elder bhikkhus, paid homage to them, sat down to one side, and said to the venerable chief elder:

“Venerable Elder, it is said, ‘diversity of elements, diversity of elements.’ In what way, venerable sir, has the diversity of elements been spoken of by the Blessed One?”

When this was said, the venerable chief elder was silent. A second time and a third time Citta the householder asked the same question, and a second time and a third time the venerable chief elder was silent.

Now on that occasion the Venerable Isidatta was the most junior bhikkhu in that Sȧgha. Then the Venerable Isidatta said to the venerable chief elder: “Allow me, venerable elder, to answer Citta the householder’s question.”

“Answer it, friend Isidatta.”

“Now, householder, are you asking thus: ‘Venerable elder, it is said, “diversity of elements, diversity of elements.” In what way, venerable sir, has the diversity of elements been spoken of by the Blessed One?’” \[285\]

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“This diversity of elements, householder, has been spoken of by the Blessed One thus: the eye element, form element, eye-consciousness element ... the mind element, mental-phenomena element, mind-consciousness element. It is in this way, householder, that the diversity of elements has been spoken of by the Blessed One.”

Then Citta the householder, having delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable Isidatta’s words, with his own hand served and satisfied the elder bhikkhus with the various kinds of delicious food. When the elder bhikkhus had finished eating and had put away their bowls, they rose from their seats and departed.

Then the venerable chief elder said to the Venerable Isidatta: “It is good, friend Isidatta, that the answer to this question occurred to you. The answer did not occur to me. Therefore, friend Isidatta, whenever a similar question comes up at some other time, you should clear it up.”
