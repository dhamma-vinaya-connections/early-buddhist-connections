# SN41.6 Kāmabhū (2)

On one occasion the Venerable Kāmabhū was dwelling at Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. Then Citta the householder approached the Venerable Kāmabhū, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: “Venerable sir, how many kinds of formations are there?”

“There are, householder, three kinds of formations: the bodily formation, the verbal formation, and the mental formation.” “Good, venerable sir,” Citta the householder said. Then, having delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable Kāmabhū’s statement, he asked him a further question: “But, venerable sir, what is the bodily formation? What is the verbal formation? What is the mental formation?”

“In-breathing and out-breathing, householder, are the bodily formation; thought and examination are the verbal formation; perception and feeling are the mental formation.”

“Good, venerable sir,” Citta the householder said. Then ... he asked him a further question: “But, venerable sir, why are in-breathing and out-breathing the bodily formation? Why are thought and examination the verbal formation? Why are perception and feeling the mental formation?”

“Householder, in-breathing and out-breathing are bodily, these things are dependent upon the body; that is why in-breathing and out-breathing are the bodily formation. First one thinks and examines, then afterwards one breaks into speech; that is why thought and examination are the verbal formation. Perception and feeling are mental, these things are dependent upon the mind; that is why perception and feeling are the mental formation.”

Saying, “Good, venerable sir,”… he then asked him a further question: “Venerable sir, how does the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling come about?”

“Householder, when a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and feeling, it does not occur to him: ‘I will attain the cessation of perception and feeling,’ or ‘I am attaining the cessation of perception and feeling,’ or ‘I have attained the cessation of perception and feeling’; \[294\] but rather his mind has previously been developed in such a way that it leads him to such a state.”

Saying, “Good, venerable sir,”… he then asked him a further question: “Venerable sir, when a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and feeling, which of these things ceases first in him: the bodily formation, the verbal formation, or the mental formation?”

“Householder, when a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and feeling, first the verbal formation ceases, after that the bodily formation, and after that the mental formation.”

Saying, “Good, venerable sir,”… he then asked him a further question: “Venerable sir, what is the difference between one who is dead and gone, and a bhikkhu who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling?”

“Householder, in the case of one who is dead and gone, the bodily formation has ceased and subsided, the verbal formation has ceased and subsided, the mental formation has ceased and subsided; his vitality is extinguished, his physical heat has been dissipated, and his faculties are fully broken up. In the case of a bhikkhu who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, the bodily formation has ceased and subsided, the verbal formation has ceased and subsided, the mental formation has ceased and subsided; but his vitality is not extinguished, his physical heat has not been dissipated, and his faculties are serene. This is the difference between one who is dead and gone, and a bhikkhu who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling.”

Saying, “Good, venerable sir,”… he then asked him a further question: “Venerable sir, how does emergence from the cessation of perception and feeling come about?”

“Householder, when a bhikkhu is emerging from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, it does not occur to him: ‘I will emerge from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling,’ or ‘I am emerging from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling,’ or ‘I have emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling’; but rather his mind has previously been developed in such a way that it leads him to such a state.” \[295\]

Saying, “Good, venerable sir,”… he then asked him a further question: “Venerable sir, when a bhikkhu is emerging from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, which of these things arises first in him: the bodily formation, the verbal formation, or the mental formation?”

“Householder, when a bhikkhu is emerging from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, first the mental formation arises, after that the bodily formation, and after that the verbal formation.”

Saying, “Good, venerable sir,”… he then asked him a further question: “Venerable sir, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, how many kinds of contact touch him?”

“Householder, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, three kinds of contact touch him: emptiness-contact, signless-contact, undirected-contact.” 

Saying, “Good, venerable sir,”… he then asked him a further question: “Venerable sir, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, towards what does his mind slant, slope, and incline?”

“Householder, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, his mind slants, slopes, and inclines towards seclusion.”

“Good, venerable sir,” Citta the householder said. Then, having delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable Kāmabhū’s statement, he asked him a further question: “Venerable sir, how many things are helpful for the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling?”

“Indeed, householder, you are asking last what should have been asked first; but still I will answer you. For the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, two things are helpful: serenity and insight.”
