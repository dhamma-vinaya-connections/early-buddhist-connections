# SN41.10 Seeing the Sick

Now on that occasion Citta the householder was sick, afflicted, gravely ill. Then a number of park devatās, grove devatās, tree devatās, and devatās dwelling in medicinal herbs and forest giants assembled and said to Citta the householder: “Make a wish, householder, thus: ‘May I become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!’”

When this was said, Citta the householder said to those devatās: “That too is impermanent; that too is unstable; one must abandon that too and pass on.”

When this was said, Citta the householder’s friends and companions, relatives and kinsmen, said to him: \[303\] “Set up mindfulness, master. Don’t babble.”

“What did I say that makes you speak to me thus.”

“You said to us: ‘That too is impermanent; that too is unstable; one must abandon that too and pass on.’”

“That was because park devatās, grove devatās, tree devatās, and devatās dwelling in medicinal herbs and forest giants assembled and said to me: ‘Make a wish, householder, thus: “May I become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!”’ And I said to them: ‘That too is impermanent; that too is unstable; one must abandon that too and pass on.’”

“What advantage do those devatās see, master, that they speak to you thus?”

“It occurs to those devatās: ‘This Citta the householder is virtuous, of good character. If he should wish: “May I become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!”—as he is virtuous, this wish of his would succeed because of its purity. The righteous king of righteousness will provide righteous offerings.’ Seeing this advantage, those devatās assembled and said: ‘Make a wish, householder, thus: “May I become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!”’ And I said to them: ‘That too is impermanent; that too is unstable; one must abandon that too and pass on.’”

“Then exhort us too, householder.”

“Therefore, you should train yourselves thus: \[304\] ‘We will be possessed of confirmed confidence in the Buddha thus: “The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.”

“‘We will be possessed of confirmed confidence in the Dhamma thus: “The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.”

“‘We will be possessed of confirmed confidence in the Saṅgha thus: “The Saṅgha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practising the good way, practising the straight way, practising the true way, practising the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals—this Saṅgha of the Blessed One’s disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.”

“‘Whatever there may be in our family that can be given away, all that we will share unreservedly with the virtuous ones who are of good character.’ It is in such a way that you should train yourselves.”

Then, having inspired confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha among his friends and colleagues, his relatives and kinsmen, and having exhorted them in generosity, Citta the householder passed away.
