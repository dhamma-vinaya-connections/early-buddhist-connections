# SN41.1 The Fetter

On one occasion a number of elder bhikkhus were dwelling at Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove.

Now on that occasion, when the elder bhikkhus had returned from their alms round, after their meal they assembled in the pavilion and were sitting together when this conversation arose: “Friends, ‘the fetter’ and ‘the things that fetter’: are these things different in meaning and also different in phrasing, or are they one in meaning and different only in phrasing?”

Some elder bhikkhus answered thus: “Friends, ‘the fetter’ and ‘the things that fetter’ are different in meaning and also different in phrasing.” But some \[other\] elder bhikkhus answered thus: “Friends, ‘the fetter’ and ‘the things that fetter’ are one in meaning and different only in phrasing.”

Now on that occasion Citta the householder had arrived in Migapathaka on some business. \[282\] Then Citta the householder heard: “A number of elder bhikkhus, it is said, on returning from their alms round, had assembled in the pavilion after their meal and were sitting together when this conversation arose.…” Then Citta the householder approached those elder bhikkhus, paid homage to them, sat down to one side, and said to them: “I have heard, venerable sirs, that when a number of elder bhikkhus were sitting together this conversation arose: ‘Friends, “the fetter” and “the things that fetter”: are these things different in meaning and also different in phrasing, or are they one in meaning and different only in phrasing?’”

“That is so, householder.”

  
  

“Venerable sirs, ‘the fetter’ and ‘the things that fetter’ are different in meaning and also different in phrasing. I will give you a simile for this, since some wise people here understand the meaning of a statement by means of a simile.

“Suppose, venerable sirs, a black ox and a white ox were yoked together by a single harness or yoke. Would one be speaking rightly if one were to say: ‘The black ox is the fetter of the white ox; the white ox is the fetter of the black ox’?” \[283\]

“No, householder. The black ox is not the fetter of the white ox nor is the white ox the fetter of the black ox, but rather the single harness or yoke by which the two are yoked together: that is the fetter there.”

“So too, friend, the eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eye, but rather the desire and lust that arise there in dependence on both: that is the fetter there. The ear is not the fetter of sounds ... The nose is not the fetter of odours … The tongue is not the fetter of tastes ... The body is not the fetter of tactile objects ... The mind is not the fetter of mental phenomena nor are mental phenomena the fetter of the mind, but rather the desire and lust that arises there in dependence on both: that is the fetter there.”

“It is a gain for you, householder, it is well gained by you, householder, in that you have the eye of wisdom that ranges over the deep Word of the Buddha.”
