# SN41.4 Mahaka’s Miracle

On one occasion a number of elder bhikkhus were dwelling at Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. \[289\] Then Citta the householder approached those elder bhikkhus, paid homage to them, sat down to one side, and said to them: “Venerable sirs, let the elders consent to accept tomorrow’s meal from me in my cowshed.”

The elder bhikkhus consented by silence. Then Citta the householder, having understood that the elders had consented, rose from his seat, paid homage to them, and departed, keeping them on his right.

When the night had passed, in the morning the elder bhikkhus dressed, took their bowls and outer robes, and went to the cowshed of Citta the householder. There they sat down on the appointed seats.

Then Citta the householder, with his own hand, served and satisfied the elder bhikkhus with delicious milk-rice made with ghee. When the elder bhikkhus had finished eating and had put away their bowls, they rose from their seats and departed.

Then Citta the householder, having said, “Give away the remainder,” followed close behind the elder bhikkhus. Now on that occasion the heat was sweltering, and the elders went along as if their bodies were melting because of the food they had eaten.

Now on that occasion the Venerable Mahaka was the most junior bhikkhu in that Saṅgha. Then the Venerable Mahaka said to the venerable chief elder: “It would be good, venerable elder, if a cool wind would blow, and a canopy of clouds would form, and the sky would drizzle.”

“That would be good, friend.”

Then the Venerable Mahaka performed such a feat of spiritual power \[290\] that a cool wind blew, and a canopy of clouds formed, and the sky drizzled.

Then it occurred to Citta the householder: “Such is the spiritual power and might possessed by the most junior bhikkhu in this Saṅgha!”

  
  

Then, when the Venerable Mahaka arrived at the monastery, he said to the venerable chief elder: “Is this much enough, Venerable Elder?”

“That’s enough, friend Mahaka. What’s been done is sufficient, friend Mahaka, what’s been offered is sufficient.”

Then the elder bhikkhus went to their dwellings and the Venerable Mahaka went to his own dwelling.

Then Citta the householder approached the Venerable Mahaka, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: “It would be good, venerable sir, if Master Mahaka would show me a superhuman miracle of spiritual power.”

“Then, householder, spread your cloak upon the verandah and scatter a bundle of grass upon it.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” Citta the householder replied, and he spread his cloak upon the verandah and scattered a bundle of grass upon it.

Then, when he had entered his dwelling and shut the bolt, the Venerable Mahaka performed a feat of spiritual power such that a flame shot through the keyhole and the chink of the door and burnt the grass but not the cloak. Citta the householder shook out his cloak and stood to one side, shocked and terrified.

Then the Venerable Mahaka came out of his dwelling and said to Citta the householder: “Is this much enough, householder?” \[291\]

“That’s enough, Venerable Mahaka. What’s been done is sufficient, Venerable Mahaka, what’s been offered is sufficient. Let Master Mahaka delight in the delightful Wild Mango Grove at Macchikāsaṇḍa. I will be zealous in providing Master Mahaka with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites.”

“That is kindly said, householder.”

Then the Venerable Mahaka set his lodging in order and, taking bowl and robe, he left Macchikāsaṇḍa. When he left Macchikāsaṇḍa, he left for good and he never returned.
