# SN40.7 The Base of Nothingness

… “Here, friends, while I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind thus: ‘It is said, “the base of nothingness, the base of nothingness.” What now is the base of nothingness?’

“Then, friends, it occurred to me: ‘Here, by completely transcending the base of the infinity of consciousness, aware that “there is nothing,” a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. This is called the base of nothingness.’

  
  

“Then, friends, by completely transcending the base of the infinity of consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ I entered and dwelt in the base of nothingness. While I dwelt therein perception and attention accompanied by the base of the infinity of consciousness assailed me.

“Then, friends, the Blessed One came to me by means of spiritual power and said this: ‘Moggallāna, Moggallāna, do not be negligent, brahmin, regarding the base of nothingness. Steady your mind in the base of nothingness, \[268\] unify your mind in the base of nothingness, concentrate your mind in the base of nothingness.’ Then, on a later occasion, by completely transcending the base of the infinity of consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ I entered and dwelt in the base of nothingness.

“If, friends, one speaking rightly could say of anyone: ‘He is a disciple who attained to greatness of direct knowledge with the assistance of the Teacher,’ it is of me that one could rightly say this.”
