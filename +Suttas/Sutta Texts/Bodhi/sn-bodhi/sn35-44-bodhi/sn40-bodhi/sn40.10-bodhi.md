# SN40.10 Sakka

## I

On one occasion the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was dwelling at Sāvatthı̄ in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, just as quickly as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna disappeared from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared among the Tāvatiṃsa devas. Then Sakka, lord of the devas, approached the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna together with five hundred devatās. \[270\] Having approached, he paid homage to the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and stood to one side. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna then said to him:

“Good, lord of the devas, is the going for refuge to the Buddha. Because of going for refuge to the Buddha, some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. Good, lord of the devas, is the going for refuge to the Dhamma. Because of going for refuge to the Dhamma, some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. Good, lord of the devas, is the going for refuge to the Saṅgha. Because of going for refuge to the Saṅgha, some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.”

“Good, Sir Moggallāna, is the going for refuge to the Buddha … to the Dhamma … to the Saṅgha. Because of going for refuge to the Saṅgha, some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.”

Having approached, he paid homage to the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and stood to one side. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna then said to him:
