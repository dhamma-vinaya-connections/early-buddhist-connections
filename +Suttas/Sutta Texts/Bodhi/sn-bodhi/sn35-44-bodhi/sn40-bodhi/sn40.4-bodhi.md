# SN40.4 The Fourth Jhāna

… “Here, friends, while I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind thus: ‘It is said, “the fourth jhāna, the fourth jhāna.” What now is the fourth jhāna?’

“Then, friends, it occurred to me: ‘Here, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and displeasure, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is neither painful nor pleasant and includes the purification of mindfulness by equanimity. This is called the fourth jhāna.’

“Then, friends, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain ... I entered and dwelt in the fourth jhāna…. While I dwelt therein perception and attention accompanied by happiness assailed me.

“Then, friends, the Blessed One came to me by means of spiritual power and said this: ‘Moggallāna, Moggallāna, do not be negligent, brahmin, regarding the fourth jhāna. Steady your mind in the fourth jhāna, unify your mind in the fourth jhāna, concentrate your mind in the fourth jhāna.’ Then, on a later occasion, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and displeasure, \[266\] I entered and dwelt in the fourth jhāna, which is neither painful nor pleasant and includes the purification of mindfulness by equanimity.

“If, friends, one speaking rightly could say of anyone: ‘He is a disciple who attained to greatness of direct knowledge with the assistance of the Teacher,’ it is of me that one could rightly say this.”
