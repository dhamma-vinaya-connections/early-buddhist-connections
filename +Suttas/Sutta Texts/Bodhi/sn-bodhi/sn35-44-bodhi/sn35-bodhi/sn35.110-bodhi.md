# SN35.110 Things That Can Be Clung To

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the things that can be clung to and the clinging. Listen to that….

“And what, bhikkhus, are the things that can be clung to, and what is the clinging? The eye, bhikkhus, is a thing that can be clung to; the desire and lust for it is the clinging there. The ear is a thing that can be clung to … The mind is a thing that can be clung to; the desire and lust for it is the clinging there. These are called the things that can be clung to, and this the clinging.”
