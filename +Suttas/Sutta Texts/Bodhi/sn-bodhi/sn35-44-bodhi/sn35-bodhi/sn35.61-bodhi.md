# SN35.61 The Exhaustion of All Clinging (1)

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the Dhamma for the exhaustion of all clinging. Listen to that….

“And what, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma for the exhaustion of all clinging? In dependence on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises…. (as above) … With its deliverance he understands: ‘Clinging has been exhausted by me.’

“In dependence on the ear and sounds … the mind and mental phenomena, mind-consciousness arises…. \[34\] … With its deliverance he understands: ‘Clinging has been exhausted by me.’

“This, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma for the exhaustion of all clinging.”
