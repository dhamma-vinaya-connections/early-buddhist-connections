# SN35.147 Suitable for Attaining Nibbāna (1)

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the way that is suitable for attaining Nibbāna. Listen to that….

“And what, bhikkhus, is the way that is suitable for attaining Nibbāna? Here, a bhikkhu sees the eye as impermanent, he sees forms as impermanent, he sees eye-consciousness as impermanent, he sees eye-contact as impermanent, he sees as impermanent whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition, whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant.

“He sees the ear as impermanent ... \[134\] … He sees the mind as impermanent, he sees mental phenomena as impermanent, he sees mind-consciousness as impermanent, he sees mind-contact as impermanent, he sees as impermanent whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition, whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant.

“This, bhikkhus, is the way that is suitable for attaining Nibbāna.”
