# SN35.60 The Full Understanding of All Clinging

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the Dhamma for the full understanding of all clinging. Listen to that….

“And what, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma for the full understanding of all clinging? In dependence on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as condition, feeling \[comes to be\]. \[33\] Seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye, towards forms, towards eye-consciousness, towards eye-contact, towards feeling. Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion \[the mind\] is liberated. With its deliverance  he understands: ‘Clinging has been fully understood by me.’

“In dependence on the ear and sounds … In dependence on the mind and mental phenomena, mind-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as condition, feeling \[comes to be\]. Seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the mind, towards mental phenomena, towards mind-consciousness, towards mind-contact, towards feeling. Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion \[the mind\] is liberated. With its deliverance he understands: ‘Clinging has been fully understood by me.’

“This, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma for the full understanding of all clinging.”
