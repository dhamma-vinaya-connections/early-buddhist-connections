# SN35.219-221 What Is Nonself of the Past, Etc. (External)

“Bhikkhus, forms ... mental phenomena of the past ... of the future ... of the present are nonself. What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Seeing thus ... He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”
