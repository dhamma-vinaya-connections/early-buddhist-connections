# SN35.86 The Dhamma in Brief

Sitting to one side, the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute.”

“What do you think, Ānanda, is the eye permanent or impermanent?” - “Impermanent, venerable sir.”

(Complete as in §32, down to “there is no more for this state of being.”) \[55\]

  
  

87 (4) Channa
