# SN35.174-176 Desire for Nonself (Internal), Etc.

“Bhikkhus, you should abandon desire for whatever is nonself…. You should abandon lust for whatever is nonself…. You should abandon desire and lust for whatever is nonself. And what is nonself? The eye is nonself … The mind is nonself; you should abandon desire for it. Bhikkhus, you should abandon desire and lust for whatever is nonself.”
