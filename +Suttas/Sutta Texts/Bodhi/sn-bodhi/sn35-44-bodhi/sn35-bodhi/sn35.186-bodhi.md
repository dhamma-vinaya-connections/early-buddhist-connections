# SN35.186 The Past as Impermanent (Internal)

“Bhikkhus, the eye … the mind of the past was impermanent. Seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye ... towards the mind. Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion \[his mind\] is liberated. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It’s liberated.’ He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’”
