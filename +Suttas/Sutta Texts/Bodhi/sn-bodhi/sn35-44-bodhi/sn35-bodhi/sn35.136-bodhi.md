# SN35.136 Delight in Forms (1)

“Bhikkhus, devas and humans delight in forms, take delight in forms, rejoice in forms. With the change, fading away, and cessation of forms, devas and humans dwell in suffering. Devas and humans delight in sounds ... delight in odours … delight in tastes ... delight in tactile objects ... delight in mental phenomena, \[127\] take delight in mental phenomena, rejoice in mental phenomena. With the change, fading away, and cessation of mental phenomena, devas and humans dwell in suffering.

“But, bhikkhus, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Fully Enlightened One, has understood as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of forms. He does not delight in forms, does not take delight in forms, does not rejoice in forms. With the change, fading away, and cessation of forms, the Tathāgata dwells happily.

“He has understood as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of sounds ... odours … tastes ... tactile objects ... mental phenomena. He does not delight in mental phenomena, does not take delight in mental phenomena, does not rejoice in mental phenomena. With the change, fading away, and cessation of mental phenomena, the Tathāgata dwells happily.”

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

> “Forms, sounds, odours, tastes,

> Tactiles and all objects of mind—  
>   
> Desirable, lovely, agreeable,

>   
> Are able to understand this state?

> When they have rightly known that state,

> The taintless ones are fully quenched.”
