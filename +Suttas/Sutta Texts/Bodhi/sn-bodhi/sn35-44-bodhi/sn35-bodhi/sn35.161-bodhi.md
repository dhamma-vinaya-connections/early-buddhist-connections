# SN35.161 Jı̄vakas Mango Grove (2)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in Jı̄vaka’s Mango Grove. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus:

“Bhikkhus, make an exertion in seclusion. When a bhikkhu is secluded, things become manifest to him as they really are. And what becomes manifest to him as it really is?”

(All as in preceding sutta.) \[145\]

  
  

162 (7) Koṭṭhita (1)
