# SN35.55 Uprooting the Fetters

… “Venerable sir, how should one know, how should one see, for the fetters to be uprooted?”

“Bhikkhu, when one knows and sees the eye as nonself, \[32\] the fetters are uprooted. When one knows and sees forms as nonself … (all as above) … When one knows and sees thus, bhikkhu, the fetters are uprooted.”
