# SN35.33 Subject to Birth

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, all is subject to birth. And what, bhikkhus, is the all that is subject to birth? \[27\] The eye is subject to birth. Forms … Eye-consciousness … Eye-contact … Whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition … that too is subject to birth.

“The ear … The tongue … The body … The mind … Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … that too is subject to birth.

“Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye, towards forms, towards eye-consciousness, towards eye-contact … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”

  
  

34 (2)-42 (10) Subject to Aging, Etc.
