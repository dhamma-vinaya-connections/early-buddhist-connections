# SN35.183-185 Desire for Nonself (External), Etc.

“Bhikkhus, you should abandon desire for whatever is nonself…. You should abandon lust for whatever is nonself…. You should abandon desire and lust for whatever is nonself. And what is nonself? Forms are nonself … Mental phenomena are nonself; you should abandon desire and lust for them. Bhikkhus, you should abandon desire and lust for whatever is nonself.”

  
  

186 (19) The Past as Impermanent (Internal)
