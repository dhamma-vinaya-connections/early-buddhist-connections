# SN35.158 The Destruction of Delight (3)

“Bhikkhus, attend carefully to the eye. Recognize the impermanence of the eye as it really is. When a bhikkhu, attending carefully to the eye, recognizes the impermanence of the eye as it really is, he feels revulsion towards the eye. With the destruction of delight comes destruction of lust; with the destruction of lust comes destruction of delight. With the destruction of delight and lust the mind is said to be well liberated. \[143\]

“Bhikkhus, attend carefully to the ear ... to the mind. Recognize the impermanence of the mind as it really is…. With the destruction of delight and lust the mind is said to be well liberated.”
