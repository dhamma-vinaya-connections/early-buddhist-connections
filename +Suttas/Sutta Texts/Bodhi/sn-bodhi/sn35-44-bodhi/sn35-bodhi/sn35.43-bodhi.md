At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, all is impermanent…. All is suffering…. All is nonself…. \[29\] All is to be directly known…. All is to be fully understood…. All is to be abandoned…. All is to be realized…. All is to be fully understood through direct knowledge…. All is oppressed…. All is stricken….” (Each to be completed as in §33.) \[30\]
