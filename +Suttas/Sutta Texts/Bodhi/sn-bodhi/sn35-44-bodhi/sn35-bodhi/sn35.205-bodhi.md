# SN35.205 What Is Impermanent of the Future (Internal)

“Bhikkhus, the eye ... the mind of the future will be impermanent. What is impermanent is suffering. What is suffering is nonself. What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Seeing thus ... He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”
