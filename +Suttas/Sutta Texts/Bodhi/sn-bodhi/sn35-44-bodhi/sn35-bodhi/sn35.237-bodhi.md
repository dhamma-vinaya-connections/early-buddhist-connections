# SN35.237 The Simile of Hands and Feet (2)

“Bhikkhus, when there are hands, there is picking up and putting down….

“So too, bhikkhus, when there is the eye, pleasure and pain arise internally with eye-contact as condition…. When there is the mind, pleasure and pain arise internally with mind-contact as condition.

“When, bhikkhus, there are no hands, there is no picking up and putting down….

“So too, bhikkhus, when there is no eye ... no mind, no pleasure and pain arise internally with mind-contact as condition.”



238 (1) The Simile of the Vipers
