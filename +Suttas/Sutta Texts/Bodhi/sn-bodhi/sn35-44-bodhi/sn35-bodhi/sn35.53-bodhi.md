# SN35.53 Abandoning Ignorance

At Sāvatthī. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, \[31\] and said to him:

“Venerable sir, how should one know, how should one see, for ignorance to be abandoned and true knowledge to arise?”

“Bhikkhu, when one knows and sees the eye as impermanent, ignorance is abandoned and true knowledge arises. When one knows and sees forms as impermanent … When one knows and sees as impermanent whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-norpleasant—ignorance is abandoned and true knowledge arises. When one knows and sees thus, bhikkhu, ignorance is abandoned and true knowledge arises.”
