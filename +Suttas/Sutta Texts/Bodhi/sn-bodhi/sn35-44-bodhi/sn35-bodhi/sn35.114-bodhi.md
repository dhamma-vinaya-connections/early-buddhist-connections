# SN35.114 Māra’s(1)

“Bhikkhus, there are forms cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a bhikkhu seeks delight in them, welcomes them, and remains holding to them, he is called a bhikkhu who has entered Māra’s lair, who has come under Māra’s control; Māra’s snare has been fastened to him so that he is bound by the bondage of Māra and the Evil One can do with him as he wishes.

“There are, bhikkhus, sounds cognizable by the ear … mental phenomena cognizable by the mind that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a bhikkhu seeks delight in them ... \[92\] … the Evil One can do with him as he wishes.

“There are, bhikkhus, forms cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a bhikkhu does not seek delight in them, does not welcome them, and does not remain holding to them, he is called a bhikkhu who has not entered Māra’s lair, who has not come under Māra’s control; Māra’s snare has been unfastened from him so that he is not bound by the bondage of Māra and the Evil One cannot do with him as he wishes.

“There are, bhikkhus, sounds cognizable by the ear … mental phenomena cognizable by the mind that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. \[93\] If a bhikkhu does not seek delight in them … the Evil One cannot do with him as he wishes.”
