# SN35.62 The Exhaustion of All Clinging (2)

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the Dhamma for the exhaustion of all clinging. Listen to that….”

“And what, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma for the exhaustion of all clinging? What do you think, bhikkhus, is the eye permanent or impermanent?”

… (To be completed as in §32) … \[35\]

“This, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma for the exhaustion of all clinging.”


63 (1) Migajāla (1)
