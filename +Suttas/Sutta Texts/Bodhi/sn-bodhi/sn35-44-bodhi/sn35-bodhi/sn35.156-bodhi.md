# SN35.156 The Destruction of Delight (1)

“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu sees as impermanent the eye which is actually impermanent: that is his right view. Seeing rightly, he experiences revulsion. With the destruction of delight comes destruction of lust; with the destruction of lust comes destruction of delight. With the destruction of delight and lust the mind is said to be well liberated.

“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu sees as impermanent the ear which is actually impermanent… the mind which is actually impermanent: that is his right view…. With the destruction of delight and lust the mind is said to be well liberated.”
