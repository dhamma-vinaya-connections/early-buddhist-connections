# SN35.177-179 Desire for the Impermanent (External), Etc.

“Bhikkhus, you should abandon desire for whatever is impermanent…. You should abandon lust for whatever is impermanent…. You should abandon desire and lust for whatever is impermanent. And what is impermanent? Forms are impermanent … Mental phenomena are impermanent; you should abandon desire and lust for them. Bhikkhus, you should abandon desire and lust for whatever is impermanent.”
