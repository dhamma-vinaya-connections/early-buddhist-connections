# SN35.30 Appropriate for Uprooting

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the way that is appropriate for uprooting all conceivings. \[22\] Listen to that and attend closely, I will speak….

“And what, bhikkhus, is the way that is appropriate for uprooting all conceivings? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not conceive the eye, does not conceive in the eye, does not conceive from the eye, does not conceive, ‘The eye is mine.’ He does not conceive forms … eye-consciousness … eye-contact … and as to whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—he does not conceive that, does not conceive in that, does not conceive from that, does not conceive, ‘That is mine.’

“He does not conceive the ear … He does not conceive the mind … mental phenomena … mind-consciousness … mind-contact … \[23\] and as to whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … he does not conceive that, does not conceive in that, does not conceive from that, does not conceive, ‘That is mine.’

“He does not conceive all, does not conceive in all, does not conceive from all, does not conceive, ‘All is mine.’

“Since he does not conceive anything thus, he does not cling to anything in the world. Not clinging, he is not agitated. Being unagitated, he personally attains Nibbāna. He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’

“This, bhikkhus, is the way that is appropriate for uprooting all conceivings.”
