# SN35.142 Nonself with Cause (Internal)

“Bhikkhus, the eye is nonself. The cause and condition for the arising of the eye is also nonself. As the eye has originated from what is nonself, how could it be self?

“The ear is nonself…. The mind is nonself. The cause and condition for the arising of the mind \[131\] is also nonself. As the mind has originated from what is nonself, how could it be self?

“Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”

  
  

143 (10)-145 (12) Impermanent with Cause, Etc. (External)
