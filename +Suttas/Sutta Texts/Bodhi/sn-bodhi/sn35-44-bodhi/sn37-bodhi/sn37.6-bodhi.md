# SN37.6-13 Malicious, Etc.

“When, Anuruddha, a woman possesses five qualities, with the breakup of the body, after death, she is reborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the nether world, in hell. What five?

“She is without faith, shameless, unafraid of wrongdoing, malicious, \[envious ... stingy … of loose conduct ... immoral … unlearned ... lazy ... muddle-minded,\] unwise. When a woman possesses these five qualities she is reborn in a state of misery ... in hell.” \[242–43\]
