# SN37.5 Angry

Then the Venerable Anuruddha approached the Blessed One … and said to him: “Here, venerable sir, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I see women, with the breakup of the body, after death, being reborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the nether world, in hell. When a woman possesses how many qualities, venerable sir, is she reborn thus?”

  
  

“When, Anuruddha, a woman possesses five qualities, with the breakup of the body, after death, she is reborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the nether world, in hell. What five?

“She is without faith, shameless, unafraid of wrongdoing, angry, unwise. When a woman possesses these five qualities \[241\] she is reborn in a state of misery ... in hell.”
