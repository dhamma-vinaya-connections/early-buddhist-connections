# SN37.16-23 Without Malice, Etc.

“When, Anuruddha, a woman possesses five qualities, with the breakup of the body, after death, she is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. What are the five?

“She has faith, she has a sense of shame, she is afraid of wrongdoing, she is without malice, \[without envy ... not stingy ... not of loose conduct ... virtuous ... learned ... energetic ... mindful,\]  wise. When a woman possesses these five qualities she is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.” \[245\]
