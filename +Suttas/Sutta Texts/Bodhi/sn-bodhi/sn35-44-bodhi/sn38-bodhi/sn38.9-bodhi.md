# SN38.9 Ignorance

“Friend Sāriputta, it is said, ‘ignorance, ignorance.’ What now is ignorance?”

“Not knowing suffering, not knowing the origin of suffering, not knowing the cessation of suffering, not knowing the way leading to the cessation of suffering. This is called ignorance.”

“But, friend, is there a path, is there a way for the abandonment of this ignorance?”

“There is a path, friend, there is a way ... this Noble Eightfold Path….” \[257\]
