# SN38.2 Arahantship

“Friend Sāriputta, it is said, ‘arahantship, arahantship.’ What now is arahantship?”

“The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion: this, friend, is called arahantship.”

“But, friend, is there a path, is there a way for the realization of this arahantship?”

“There is a path, friend, there is a way for the realization of this arahantship.”

“And what, friend, is that path, what is that way for the realization of this arahantship?”

“It is, friend, this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view … right concentration. This is the path, friend, this is the way for the realization of this arahantship.”

“Excellent is the path, friend, excellent is the way for the realization of this arahantship. And it is enough, friend Sāriputta, for diligence.”
