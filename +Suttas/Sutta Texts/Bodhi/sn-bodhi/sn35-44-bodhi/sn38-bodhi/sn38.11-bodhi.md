# SN38.11 Floods

“Friend Sāriputta, it is said, ‘flood, flood.’ What now is a flood?”

“There are, friend, these four floods: the flood of sensuality, the flood of existence, the flood of views, the flood of ignorance. These are the four floods.”

“But, friend, is there a path, is there a way for the abandonment of these four floods?”

“There is a path, friend, there is a way … this Noble Eightfold Path….” \[258\]
