# SN38.3 Proponents of Dhamma

“Friend Sāriputta, who are the proponents of Dhamma in the world? Who are practising well in the world? Who are the fortunate ones in the world?”

“Those, friend, who teach the Dhamma for the abandonment of lust, \[253\] for the abandonment of hatred, for the abandonment of delusion: they are the proponents of Dhamma in the world. Those who are practising for the abandonment of lust, for the abandonment of hatred, for the abandonment of delusion: they are practising well in the world. Those for whom lust, hatred, and delusion have been abandoned, cut off at the root, made like palm stumps, obliterated so that they are no more subject to future arising: they are the fortunate ones in the world.” “But, friend, is there a path, is there a way for the abandonment of this lust, hatred, and delusion?”

“There is a path, friend, there is a way for the abandonment of this lust, hatred, and delusion.”

“And what, friend, is that path…?”

“It is, friend, this Noble Eightfold Path….”

  
  

“Excellent is the path, friend, excellent is the way for the abandonment of this lust, hatred, and delusion. And it is enough, friend Sāriputta, for diligence.”
