# SN38.15 Identity

“Friend Sāriputta, it is said, ‘identity, identity.’ What now is identity?”

“These five aggregates subject to clinging, friend, have been called identity by the Blessed One; that is, the form aggregate subject to clinging, the feeling aggregate subject to clinging, the perception aggregate subject to clinging, the volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging, \[260\] the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging. These five aggregates subject to clinging have been called identity by the Blessed One.”

“But, friend, is there a path, is there a way for the full understanding of this identity?”

“There is a path, friend, there is a way for the full understanding of this identity.”

“And what, friend, is that path, what is that way for the full understanding of this identity.”

“It is, friend, this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view ... right concentration. This is the path, friend, this is the way for the full understanding of this identity.”

  
  

“Excellent is the path, friend, excellent is the way for the full understanding of this identity. And it is enough, friend Sāriputta, for diligence.”
