# SN30.3 Ambivalent (1)

At Sāvatthī…. Sitting to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, what is the cause and reason why someone here, with the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in the company of egg-born supaṇṇas?”

“Here, bhikkhu, someone acts ambivalently in body, speech, and mind. He has heard: ‘Egg-born supaṇṇas are long-lived, beautiful, and abound in happiness.’ He thinks: ‘Oh, with the breakup of the body, after death, may I be reborn in the company of egg-born supaṇṇas!’ Then, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of egg-born supaṇṇas.

“This, bhikkhu, is the cause and reason why someone here, with the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in the company of egg-born supaṇṇas.”
