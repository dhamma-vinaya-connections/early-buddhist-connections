# SN30.2 They Carry Off

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, there are these four modes of generation of supaṇṇas….

“Therein, bhikkhus, egg-born supaṇṇas carry off only nāgas that are egg-born, not those that are womb-born, moisture-born, or spontaneously born. Womb-born supaṇṇas carry off nāgas that are egg-born and womb-born, but not those that are moisture-born or spontaneously born. Moisture-born supaṇṇas carry off nāgas that are egg-born, womb-born, and moisture-born, but not those that are spontaneously born. Spontaneously born supaṇṇas carry off nāgas that are egg-born, womb-born, moisture-born, and spontaneously born.

“These, bhikkhus, are the four modes of generation of supaṇṇas.”
