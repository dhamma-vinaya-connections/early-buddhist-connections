# SN34.46 Resolution in relation to the Range

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of meditators. What four?

“Here, bhikkhus, a meditator is skilled in the range but not in resolution … skilled in resolution but not in the range … skilled neither in the range nor in resolution … skilled both in the range and in resolution regarding concentration.

“Therein, bhikkhus, the meditator who is skilled both in the range and in resolution regarding concentration is the chief … the most excellent of these four kinds of meditators.”
