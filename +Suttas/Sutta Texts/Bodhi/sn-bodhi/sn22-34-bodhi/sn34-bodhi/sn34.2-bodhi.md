# SN34.2 Maintenance in relation to Concentration

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of meditators. What four?

“Here, bhikkhus, a meditator is skilled in concentration regarding concentration but not skilled in maintenance regarding concentration.

“Here a meditator is skilled in maintenance regarding concentration but not skilled in concentration regarding concentration.

“Here a meditator is skilled neither in concentration nor in maintenance regarding concentration.

“Here a meditator is skilled both in concentration and in maintenance regarding concentration.

“Therein, bhikkhus, the meditator who is skilled both in concentration and in maintenance regarding concentration \[265\] is the chief, the best, the foremost, the supreme, the most excellent of these four kinds of meditators.

“Just as, bhikkhus, from a cow comes milk … and from ghee comes cream-of-ghee, which is reckoned the best of all these, so too the meditator who is skilled both in concentration and in maintenance regarding concentration … is the most excellent of these four kinds of meditators.”
