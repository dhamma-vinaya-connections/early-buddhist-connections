# SN34.41 The Range in relation to the Object

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of meditators. What four?

“Here, bhikkhus, a meditator is skilled in the object but not in the range … skilled in the range but not in the object … skilled neither in the object nor in the range … skilled both in the object and in the range regarding concentration.

“Therein, bhikkhus, the meditator who is skilled both in the object and in the range regarding concentration is the chief … the most excellent of these four kinds of meditators.” \[276\]
