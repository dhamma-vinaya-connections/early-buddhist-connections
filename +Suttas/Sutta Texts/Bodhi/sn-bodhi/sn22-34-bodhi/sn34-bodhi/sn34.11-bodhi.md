# SN34.11 Maintenance in relation to Attainment

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of meditators. What four?

“Here, bhikkhus, a meditator is skilled in attainment regarding concentration but not skilled in maintenance regarding concentration.

“Here a meditator is skilled in maintenance regarding concentration but not skilled in attainment regarding concentration.

“Here a meditator is skilled neither in attainment nor in maintenance regarding concentration.

“Here a meditator is skilled both in attainment and in maintenance regarding concentration.

“Therein, bhikkhus, the meditator who is skilled both in attainment and in maintenance regarding concentration is the chief, the best, the foremost, the highest, the most excellent of these four kinds of meditators.

“Just as, bhikkhus, from a cow comes milk … and from ghee comes cream-of-ghee, which is reckoned the best of all these, so too the meditator who is skilled both in attainment and in maintenance regarding concentration … is the most excellent of these four kinds of meditators.”
