# SN34.1 Attainment in relation to Concentration

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of meditators. What four? \[264\]

“Here, bhikkhus, a meditator is skilled in concentration regarding concentration but not skilled in attainment regarding concentration.

“Here a meditator is skilled in attainment regarding concentration but not skilled in concentration regarding concentration.

“Here a meditator is skilled neither in concentration regarding concentration nor in attainment regarding concentration.

“Here a meditator is skilled both in concentration regarding concentration and in attainment regarding concentration.

“Therein, bhikkhus, the meditator who is skilled both in concentration regarding concentration and in attainment regarding concentration is the chief, the best, the foremost, the highest, the most excellent of these four kinds of meditators.

“Just as, bhikkhus, from a cow comes milk, from milk comes cream, from cream comes butter, from butter comes ghee, and from ghee comes cream-of-ghee, which is reckoned the best of all these, so too the meditator who is skilled both in concentration regarding concentration and in attainment regarding concentration is the chief, the best, the foremost, the highest, the most excellent of these four kinds of meditators.”
