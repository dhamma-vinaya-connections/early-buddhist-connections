# SN34.20 Emergence in relation to Maintenance

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of meditators. What four?

“Here, bhikkhus, a meditator is skilled in maintenance regarding concentration but not skilled in emergence regarding concentration.

“Here a meditator is skilled in emergence regarding concentration but not skilled in maintenance regarding concentration.

“Here a meditator is skilled neither in maintenance nor in emergence regarding concentration.

“Here a meditator is skilled both in maintenance and in emergence regarding concentration.

“Therein, bhikkhus, the meditator who is skilled both in maintenance and in emergence regarding concentration is the chief … the most excellent of these four kinds of meditators.” \[273\]
