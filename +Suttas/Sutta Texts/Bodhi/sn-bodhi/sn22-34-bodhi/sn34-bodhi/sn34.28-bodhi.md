# SN34.28 Pliancy in relation to Emergence

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of meditators. What four?

“Here, bhikkhus, a meditator is skilled in emergence but not in pliancy … \[274\] … skilled in pliancy but not in emergence … skilled neither in emergence nor in pliancy … skilled both in emergence and in pliancy regarding concentration.

“Therein, bhikkhus, the meditator who is skilled both in emergence and in pliancy regarding concentration is the chief … the most excellent of these four kinds of meditators.”
