# SN26.5 Feeling

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, the arising, continuation, production, and manifestation of feeling born of eye-contact … of feeling born of mind-contact is the arising of suffering, the continuation of disease, the manifestation of aging-and-death.

“The cessation, subsiding, and passing away of feeling born of eye-contact … of feeling born of mind-contact is the cessation of suffering, the subsiding of disease, the passing away of aging-and-death.”
