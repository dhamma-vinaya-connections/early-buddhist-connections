# SN27.1 The Eye

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, desire and lust for the eye is a corruption of the mind. Desire and lust for the ear … for the nose … for the tongue … for the body … for the mind is a corruption of the mind. When a bhikkhu has abandoned the mental corruption in these six cases, his mind inclines to renunciation. A mind fortified by renunciation becomes wieldy in regard to those things that are to be realized by direct knowledge.”
