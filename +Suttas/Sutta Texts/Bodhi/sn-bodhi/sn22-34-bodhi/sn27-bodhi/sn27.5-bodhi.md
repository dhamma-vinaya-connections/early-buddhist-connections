# SN27.5 Feeling

“Bhikkhus, desire and lust for feeling born of eye-contact … for feeling born of mind-contact is a corruption of the mind. When a bhikkhu has abandoned the mental corruption in these six cases … \[his mind\] becomes wieldy in regard to those things that are to be realized by direct knowledge.”
