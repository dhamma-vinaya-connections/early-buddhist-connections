# SN27.8 Craving

“Bhikkhus, desire and lust for craving for forms … for craving for mental phenomena is a corruption of the mind. When a bhikkhu has abandoned the mental corruption in these six cases … \[his mind\] becomes wieldy in regard to those things that are to be realized by direct knowledge.”
