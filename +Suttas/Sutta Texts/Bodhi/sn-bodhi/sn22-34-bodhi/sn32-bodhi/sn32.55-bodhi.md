# SN32.55 Storm-Cloud Devas

… “Venerable sir, what is the cause and reason why it sometimes becomes stormy?”

“There are, bhikkhu, what are called storm-cloud devas. When it occurs to them, ‘Let us revel in our own kind of delight,’ then, in accordance with their wish, it becomes stormy. This, bhikkhu, is the cause and reason why it sometimes becomes stormy.”
