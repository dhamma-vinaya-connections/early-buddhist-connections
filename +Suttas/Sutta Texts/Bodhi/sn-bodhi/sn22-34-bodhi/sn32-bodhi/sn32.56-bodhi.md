# SN32.56 Wind-Cloud Devas

… “Venerable sir, what is the cause and reason why it sometimes becomes windy?”

“There are, bhikkhu, what are called wind-cloud devas. \[257\] When it occurs to them, ‘Let us revel in our own kind of delight,’ then, in accordance with their wish, it becomes windy. This, bhikkhu, is the cause and reason why it sometimes becomes windy.”
