# SN32.54 Warm-Cloud Devas

… “Venerable sir, what is the cause and reason why it sometimes becomes warm?”

“There are, bhikkhu, what are called warm-cloud devas. When it occurs to them, ‘Let us revel in our own kind of delight,’ then, in accordance with their wish, it becomes warm. This, bhikkhu, is the cause and reason why it sometimes becomes warm.”
