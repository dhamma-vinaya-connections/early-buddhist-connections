# SN32.53 Cool-Cloud Devas

At Sāvatthī…. Sitting to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, what is the cause and reason why it sometimes becomes cool?”

“There are, bhikkhu, what are called cool-cloud devas. When it occurs to them, ‘Let us revel in our own kind of delight,’ then, in accordance with their wish, it becomes cool. This, bhikkhu, is the cause and reason why it sometimes becomes cool.”
