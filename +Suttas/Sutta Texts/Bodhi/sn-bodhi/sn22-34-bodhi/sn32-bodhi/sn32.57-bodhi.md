# SN32.57 Rain-Cloud Devas

… “Venerable sir, what is the cause and reason why it sometimes rains?”

“There are, bhikkhu, what are called rain-cloud devas. When it occurs to them, ‘Let us revel in our own kind of delight,’ then, in accordance with their wish, it rains. This, bhikkhu, is the cause and reason why it sometimes rains.”
