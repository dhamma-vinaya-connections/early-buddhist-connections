# SN24.2 This Is Mine

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, when what exists, by clinging to what, by adhering to what, does such a view as this arise: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?”

“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One….” \[204\]

“When there is form, bhikkhus, by clinging to form, by adhering to form, such a view as this arises: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ When there is feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness, by clinging to consciousness, by adhering to consciousness, such a view as this arises: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’…

“When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple has abandoned perplexity in these six cases … he is then called a noble disciple who is a stream-enterer … with enlightenment as his destination.”
