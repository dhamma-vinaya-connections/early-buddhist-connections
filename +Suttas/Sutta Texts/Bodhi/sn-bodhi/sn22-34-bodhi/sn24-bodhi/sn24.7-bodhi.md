# SN24.7 Cause

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, when what exists, by clinging to what, by adhering to what, does such a view as this arise: ‘There is no cause or condition for the defilement of beings; beings are defiled without cause or condition. There is no cause or condition for the purification of beings; beings are purified without cause or condition. \[There is no action by self, no action by others, no manly action.\] There is no power, no energy, no manly strength, no manly exertion. All beings, all living beings, all creatures, all souls are without mastery, power, and energy; moulded by destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes?”

“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One….”

“When there is form, bhikkhus, when there is feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness, by clinging to consciousness, by adhering to consciousness, such a view as this arises: ‘There is no cause or condition for the defilement of beings … they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes.’…

“When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple has abandoned perplexity in these six cases … \[211\] … he is then called a noble disciple who is a stream-enterer … with enlightenment as his destination.”
