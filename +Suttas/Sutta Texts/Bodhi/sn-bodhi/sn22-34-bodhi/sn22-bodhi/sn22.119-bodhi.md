# SN22.119 Interrogation (2)

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, what do you think, do you regard form thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self’?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Good, bhikkhus! Form should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

“Do you regard feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self’?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Good, bhikkhus! Consciousness should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

“Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”
