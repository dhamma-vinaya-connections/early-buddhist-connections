# SN22.125 Kappa (2)

At Sāvatthī. Then the Venerable Kappa approached the Blessed One … and said to him:

“Venerable sir, how should one know, how should one see so that, in regard to this body with consciousness and in regard to all external signs, the mind is rid of I-making, mine-making, and conceit, has transcended discrimination, and is peaceful and well liberated?”

(Remainder identical with §72, but addressed to Kappa.)
