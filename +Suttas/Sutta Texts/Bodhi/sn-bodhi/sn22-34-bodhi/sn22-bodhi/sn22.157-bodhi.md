# SN22.157 Adherence (1)

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, when what exists, by clinging to what, by adhering to what, do the fetters, adherences, and shackles arise?”

“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One….”

“When there is form, bhikkhus, by clinging to form, by adhering to form, the fetters, adherences, and shackles arise. When there is feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness, by clinging to consciousness, by adhering to consciousness, the fetters, adherences, and shackles arise.”…

“Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’” \[187\]
