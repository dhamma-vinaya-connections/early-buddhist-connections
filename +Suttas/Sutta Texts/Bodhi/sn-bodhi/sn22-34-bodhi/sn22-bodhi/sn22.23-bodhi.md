# SN22.23 Full Understanding

At Sāvatthī. \[27\] “Bhikkhus, I will teach you things that should be fully understood and also full understanding. Listen to that….

“And what, bhikkhus, are the things that should be fully understood? Form, bhikkhus, is something that should be fully understood; feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness is something that should be fully understood. These are called the things that should be fully understood.

“And what, bhikkhus, is full understanding? The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion. This is called full understanding.”
