# SN22.126 Subject to Arising (1)

At Sāvatthī. \[171\] Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One … and said to him: “Venerable sir, it is said, ‘ignorance, ignorance.’ What now, venerable sir, is ignorance, and in what way is one immersed in ignorance?”

“Here, bhikkhu, the uninstructed worldling does not understand form subject to arising as it really is thus: ‘Form is subject to arising.’ He does not understand form subject to vanishing as it really is thus: ‘Form is subject to vanishing.’ He does not understand form subject to arising and vanishing as it really is thus: ‘Form is subject to arising and vanishing.’ He does not understand feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness subject to arising … subject to vanishing … subject to arising and vanishing as it really is thus: ‘Consciousness is subject to arising and vanishing.’

“This is called ignorance, bhikkhu, and in this way one is immersed in ignorance.”

When this was said, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One:

“Venerable sir, it is said, ‘true knowledge, true knowledge.’ What now, venerable sir, is true knowledge, and in what way has one arrived at true knowledge?”

“Here, bhikkhu, the instructed noble disciple understands form subject to arising as it really is thus: ‘Form is subject to arising.’ He understands form subject to vanishing as it really is thus: ‘Form is subject to vanishing.’ \[172\] He understands form subject to arising and vanishing as it really is thus: ‘Form is subject to arising and vanishing.’ He understands feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness subject to arising … subject to vanishing … subject to arising and vanishing as it really is thus: ‘Consciousness is subject to arising and vanishing.’

  

“This is called true knowledge, bhikkhu, and in this way one has arrived at true knowledge.”
