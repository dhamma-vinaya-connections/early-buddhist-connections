# SN22.108 Ascetics (2)

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, there are these five aggregates subject to clinging. What five? The form aggregate subject to clinging … the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging.

“Bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who do not understand as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of these five aggregates subject to clinging: these I do not consider to be ascetics among ascetics or brahmins among brahmins….

“But, bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who understand these things as they really are … in this very life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism and the goal of brahminhood.”
