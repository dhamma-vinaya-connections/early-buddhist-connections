# SN22.150 Internally

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, when what exists, by clinging to what, do pleasure and pain arise internally?” \[181\]

“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One….”

“When there is form, bhikkhus, by clinging to form, pleasure and pain arise internally. When there is feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness, by clinging to consciousness, pleasure and pain arise internally.

“What do you think, bhikkhus, is form permanent or impermanent?”

“Impermanent, venerable sir.”

“Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?”

“Suffering, venerable sir.”

“But without clinging to what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, could pleasure and pain arise internally?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Is feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness permanent or impermanent?… But without clinging to what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, could pleasure and pain arise internally?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”
