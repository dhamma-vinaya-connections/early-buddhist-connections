# SN22.19 Suffering with Cause

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, form is suffering. The cause and condition for the arising of form is also suffering. As form has originated from what is suffering, how could it be happiness?

“Feeling is suffering…. Perception is suffering…. Volitional formations are suffering…. \[24\] Consciousness is suffering. The cause and condition for the arising of consciousness is also suffering. As consciousness has originated from what is suffering, how could it be happiness?

“Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”
