# SN22.104 Suffering

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the way leading to the cessation of suffering.

“And what, bhikkhus, is suffering? It should be said: the five aggregates subject to clinging. What five?… (as above) … This is called suffering.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the origin of suffering? It is this craving that leads to renewed existence…. This is called the origin of suffering.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the cessation of suffering? It is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving…. This is called the cessation of suffering. \[159\]

“And what, bhikkhus, is the way leading to the cessation of suffering? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view … right concentration. This is called the way leading to the cessation of suffering.”
