# SN22.131 Origin (1)

At Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana…. “Friend Sāriputta, it is said, ‘ignorance, ignorance.’ What now, friend, is ignorance, and in what way is one immersed in ignorance?”

“Here, friend, the uninstructed worldling does not understand as it really is the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness. This, friend, is called ignorance, and in this way one is immersed in ignorance.”
