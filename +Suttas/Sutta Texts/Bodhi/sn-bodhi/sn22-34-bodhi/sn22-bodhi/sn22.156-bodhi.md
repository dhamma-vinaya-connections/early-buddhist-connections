# SN22.156 View of Self

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, when what exists, by clinging to what, by adhering to what, does view of self arise?”

“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One….”

“When there is form, bhikkhus, by clinging to form, by adhering to form, view of self arises. \[186\] When there is feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness, by clinging to consciousness, by adhering to consciousness, view of self arises.”…

“Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”
