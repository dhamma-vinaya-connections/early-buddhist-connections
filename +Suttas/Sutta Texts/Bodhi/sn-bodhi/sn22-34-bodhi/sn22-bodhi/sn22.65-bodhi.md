# SN22.65 In Seeking Delight

At Sāvatthī. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One … and said to him:

“Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief….”

“Bhikkhu, in seeking delight one is bound by Māra; by not seeking delight one is freed from the Evil One.”

“Understood, Blessed One! Understood, Fortunate One!”

“In what way, bhikkhu, do you understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by me in brief?”

“In seeking delight in form, venerable sir, one is bound by Māra; by not seeking delight in it one is freed from the Evil One. In seeking delight in feeling … in perception … in volitional formations … in consciousness one is bound by Māra; by not seeking delight in it one is freed from the Evil One. \[76\]

“It is in such a way, venerable sir, that I understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by the Blessed One in brief.”

“Good, good, bhikkhu! It is good that you understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by me in brief. In seeking delight in form, bhikkhu, one is bound by Māra … (as above in full) … by not seeking delight in it one is freed from the Evil One. It is in such a way that the meaning of what was stated by me in brief should be understood in detail.”

… And that bhikkhu became one of the arahants.
