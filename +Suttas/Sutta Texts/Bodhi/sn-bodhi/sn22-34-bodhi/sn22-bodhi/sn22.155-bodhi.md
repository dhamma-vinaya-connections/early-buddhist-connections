# SN22.155 Identity View

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, when what exists, by clinging to what, by adhering to what, does identity view arise?”

“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One….”

“When there is form, bhikkhus, by clinging to form, by adhering to form, identity view arises. When there is feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness, by clinging to consciousness, by adhering to consciousness, identity view arises.”…

“Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”
