# SN22.135 Koṭṭhita (3)

The same setting. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita: “Friend Koṭṭhita, it is said, ‘ignorance, ignorance.’ What now, friend, is ignorance, and in what way is one immersed in ignorance?”

“Here, friend, the uninstructed worldling does not understand form, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation. He does not understand feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation. This, friend, is called ignorance, and in this way one is immersed in ignorance.”

When this was said, the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita: “Friend Koṭṭhita, it is said, ‘true knowledge, true knowledge.’ What now, friend, is true knowledge, and in what way has one arrived at true knowledge?”

“Here, friend, the instructed noble disciple understands form, \[177\] its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation. He understands feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation. This, friend, is called true knowledge, and in this way one has arrived at true knowledge.”
