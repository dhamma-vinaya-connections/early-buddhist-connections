# SN22.116 A Speaker on the Dhamma (2)

At Sāvatthī…. Sitting to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One:

“Venerable, sir, it is said, ‘a speaker on the Dhamma, a speaker on the Dhamma.’ In what way, venerable sir, is one a speaker on the Dhamma? In what way is one practising in accordance with the Dhamma? In what way has one attained Nibbāna in this very life?”

(The rest of this sutta is identical with the preceding one.)
