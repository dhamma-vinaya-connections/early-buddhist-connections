# SN22.154 Wrong View

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, when what exists, by clinging to what, by adhering to what, does wrong view arise?”

“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One….”

“When there is form, bhikkhus, by clinging to form, by adhering to form, wrong view arises. When there is feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness, by clinging to consciousness, by adhering to consciousness, wrong view arises.

“What do you think, bhikkhus, is form … consciousness permanent or impermanent?” \[185\]

“Impermanent, venerable sir.”…

“But without clinging to what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, could wrong view arise.”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”
