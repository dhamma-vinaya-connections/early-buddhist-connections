# SN22.151 This Is Mine

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, when what exists, by clinging to what, by adhering to what, does one regard things thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?”

“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One….”

“When there is form, bhikkhus, by clinging to form, by adhering to form, \[182\] one regards things thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ When there is feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness, by clinging to consciousness, by adhering to consciousness, one regards things thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’

“What do you think, bhikkhus, is form … consciousness permanent or impermanent?”

“Impermanent, venerable sir.”…

“But without clinging to what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, could one regard anything thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”
