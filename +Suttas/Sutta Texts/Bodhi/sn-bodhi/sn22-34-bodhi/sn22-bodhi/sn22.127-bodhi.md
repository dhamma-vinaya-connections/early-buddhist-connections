# SN22.127 Subject to Arising (2)

On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta and the Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita were dwelling at Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana. Then, in the evening, the Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita emerged from seclusion, approached the Venerable Sāriputta, … and said to him: “Friend Sāriputta, it is said, ‘ignorance, ignorance. ’ What now, friend, is ignorance, and in what way is one immersed in ignorance?”

(The rest of this sutta is identical with the exchange on ignorance in the preceding sutta.) \[173\]
