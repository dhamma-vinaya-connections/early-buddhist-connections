# SN22.153 It Might Not Be For Me

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, when what exists, by clinging to what, by adhering to what, does such a view as this arise: ‘I might not be, and it might not be for me; I will not be, \[and\] it will not be for me’?”

“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One….”

“When there is form, bhikkhus, by clinging to form, by adhering to form, such a view as this arises: ‘I might not be, and it might not be for me; I will not be, \[and\] it will not be for me.’ When there is feeling … perception … volitional formations … \[184\] consciousness, by clinging to consciousness, by adhering to consciousness, such a view as this arises: ‘I might not be … and it will not be for me.’

“What do you think, bhikkhus, is form … consciousness permanent or impermanent?”

“Impermanent, venerable sir.”…

“But without clinging to what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, could such a view as that arise?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”
