# SN22.120 Things That Fetter

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the things that fetter and the fetter. Listen to that….

“And what, bhikkhus, are the things that fetter, and what is the fetter? Form, bhikkhus, is a thing that fetters; the desire and lust for it is the fetter there. Feeling … Perception … Volitional formations … \[167\] Consciousness is a thing that fetters; the desire and lust for it is the fetter there. These are called the things that fetter, and this the fetter.”
