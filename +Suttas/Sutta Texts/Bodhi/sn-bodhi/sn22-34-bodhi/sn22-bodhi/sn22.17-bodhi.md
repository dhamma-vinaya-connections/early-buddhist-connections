# SN22.17 What is Nonself

At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, form is nonself. What is nonself \[23\] should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

“Feeling is nonself…. Perception is nonself…. Volitional formations are nonself…. Consciousness is nonself. What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

“Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”
