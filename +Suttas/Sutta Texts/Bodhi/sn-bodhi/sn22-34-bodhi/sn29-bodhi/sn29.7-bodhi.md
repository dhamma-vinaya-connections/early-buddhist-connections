# SN29.7 He Has Heard (1)

At Sāvatthī…. Sitting to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, what is the cause and reason why someone here, with the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in the company of egg-born nāgas?”

“Here, bhikkhu, someone acts ambivalently in body, speech, and mind. He has heard: ‘Egg-born nāgas are long-lived, beautiful, and abound in happiness.’ He thinks: ‘Oh, with the breakup of the body, after death, may I be reborn in the company of egg-born nāgas!’ Then, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of egg-born nāgas.

“This, bhikkhu, is the cause and reason why someone here, with the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in the company of egg-born nāgas.”
