# SN29.3 The Uposatha (1)

At Sāvatthī. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: “Venerable sir, what is the cause and reason why some egg-born nāgas here observe the Uposatha and relinquish \[concern for\] their bodies?”

“Here, bhikkhus, some egg-born nāgas think thus: ‘In the past we acted ambivalently in body, speech, and mind. Having done so, with the breakup of the body, after death, we were reborn in the company of egg-born nāgas. If today we practise good conduct of body, speech, and mind, then with the breakup of the body, after death, we shall be reborn in a happy destination, in a heavenly world. Come now, let us practise good conduct of body, speech, and mind.’

“This, bhikkhu, is the cause and reason why some egg-born nāgas here observe the Uposatha and relinquish \[concern for\] their bodies.” \[242\]
