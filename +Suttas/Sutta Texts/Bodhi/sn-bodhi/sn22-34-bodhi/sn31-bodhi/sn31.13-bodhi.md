# SN31.13-22 With the Support of Giving (1)

At Sāvatthī…. Sitting to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, what is the cause and reason why someone here, with the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in the company of the devas who dwell in fragrant roots?”

“Here, bhikkhu, someone practises good conduct of body, speech, and mind. He has heard: ‘The devas who dwell in fragrant roots are long-lived, beautiful, and abound in happiness.’

“He thinks: ‘Oh, with the breakup of the body, after death, may I be reborn in the company of the devas who dwell in fragrant roots!’ He gives food…. He gives drink…. He gives clothing…. He gives a vehicle…. He gives a garland…. He gives a fragrance…. He gives an unguent…. He gives a bed…. He gives a dwelling…. He gives a lamp. Then, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the devas who dwell in fragrant roots.

“This, bhikkhu, is the cause and reason why someone here, with the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in the company of the devas who dwell in fragrant roots.” \[253\]
