# SN31.2 Good Conduct

At Sāvatthī…. Sitting to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, what is the cause and reason why someone here, with the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in the company of the devas of the gandhabba order?”

“Here, bhikkhu, someone practises good conduct of body, speech, and mind. He has heard: ‘The devas of the gandhabba order are long-lived, beautiful, and abound in happiness.’ He thinks: ‘Oh, with the breakup of the body, after death, may I be reborn in the company of the devas of the gandhabba order!’ Then, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the devas of the gandhabba order.

“This, bhikkhu, is the cause and reason why someone here, with the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in the company of the devas of the gandhabba order.”
