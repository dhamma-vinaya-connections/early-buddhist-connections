# SN23.1 Māra

At Sāvatthī. Then the Venerable Rādha approached the Blessed One, \[189\] paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: “Venerable sir, it is said, ‘Māra, Māra.’ In what way, venerable sir, might Māra be?”

“When there is form, Rādha, there might be Māra, or the killer, or the one who is killed. Therefore, Rādha, see form as Māra, see it as the killer, see it as the one who is killed. See it as a disease, as a tumour, as a dart, as misery, as real misery. Those who see it thus see rightly.

“When there is feeling … When there is perception … When there are volitional formations … When there is consciousness, Rādha, there might be Māra, or the killer, or the one who is killed. Therefore, Rādha, see consciousness as Māra, see it as the killer, see it as the one who is killed. See it as a disease, as a tumour, as a dart, as misery, as real misery. Those who see it thus see rightly.”

“What, venerable sir, is the purpose of seeing rightly?”

“The purpose of seeing rightly, Rādha, is revulsion.”

“And what, venerable sir, is the purpose of revulsion?”

“The purpose of revulsion is dispassion.”

“And what, venerable sir, is the purpose of dispassion?”

“The purpose of dispassion is liberation.”

“And what, venerable sir, is the purpose of liberation?”

“The purpose of liberation is Nibbāna.”

“And what, venerable sir, is the purpose of Nibbāna?”

“You have gone beyond the range of questioning, Rādha. You weren’t able to grasp the limit to questioning. For, Rādha, the holy life is lived with Nibbāna as its ground, Nibbāna as its destination, Nibbāna as its final goal.”
