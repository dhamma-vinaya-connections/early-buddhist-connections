# SN23.15 Suffering

© Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Bodhi.  (More copyright information)
1At Sāvatthī. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Radha said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, it is said, ‘suffering, suffering.’ What now, venerable sir, is suffering?"

"Form, Radha, is suffering, feeling is suffering, perception is suffering, volitional formations are suffering, consciousness is suffering. Seeing thus … He understands: ’ … there is no more for this state of being.’"
