# SN23.16 Of Painful Nature

© Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Bodhi.  (More copyright information)
1At Sāvatthī. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Radha said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, it is said, ‘of a painful nature, of a painful nature.’ What now, venerable sir, is of a painful nature?"

"Form, Radha, is of a painful nature. Feeling … Perception … Volitional formations … Consciousness is of a painful nature. Seeing thus … He understands: ’ … there is no more for this state of being.’"
