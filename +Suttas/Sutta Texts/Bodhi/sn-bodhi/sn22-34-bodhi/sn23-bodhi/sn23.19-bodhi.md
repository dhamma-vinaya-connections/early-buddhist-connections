# SN23.19 Subject to Destruction

© Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Bodhi.  (More copyright information)
1At Sāvatthī. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Radha said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, it is said, ‘subject to destruction, subject to destruction.’ What now, venerable sir, is subject to destruction?"

"Form, Radha, is subject to destruction. Feeling … Perception … Volitional formations … Consciousness is subject to destruction. Seeing thus … He understands: ’ … there is no more for this state of being.’"
