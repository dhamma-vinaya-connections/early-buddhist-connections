# SN23.20 Subject to Vanishing

© Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Bodhi.  (More copyright information)
1At Sāvatthī. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Radha said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, it is said, ‘subject to vanishing, subject to vanishing.’ What now, venerable sir, is subject to vanishing?"

"Form, Radha, is subject to vanishing. Feeling … Perception … Volitional formations … Consciousness is subject to vanishing. Seeing thus … He understands: ’ … there is no more for this state of being.’"
