# SN23.24-34 Subject to Māra, Etc.

… “Rādha, you should abandon desire, you should abandon lust, you should abandon desire and lust, for whatever is subject to Māra … \[199\] … for whatever is impermanent … for whatever is of an impermanent nature … for whatever is suffering … for whatever is of a painful nature … for whatever is nonself … for whatever is of a selfless nature … for whatever is subject to destruction … for whatever is subject to vanishing … for whatever is subject to arising … for whatever is subject to cessation. And what, Rādha, is subject to cessation? Form is subject to cessation. Feeling … Perception … Volitional formations … Consciousness is subject to cessation. Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”
