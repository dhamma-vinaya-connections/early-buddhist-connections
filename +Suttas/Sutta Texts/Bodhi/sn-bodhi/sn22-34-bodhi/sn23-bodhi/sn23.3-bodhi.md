# SN23.3 The Conduit to Existence

At Sāvatthī. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Rādha said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, it is said, ‘the conduit to existence, the conduit to existence.’ What, venerable sir, is the conduit to existence, and what is the cessation of the conduit to existence?” \[191\]

“Rādha, the desire, lust, delight, craving, engagement and clinging, mental standpoints, adherences, and underlying tendencies regarding form: this is called the conduit to existence. Their cessation is the cessation of the conduit to existence.

“The desire, lust, delight, craving, engagement and clinging, mental standpoints, adherences, and underlying tendencies regarding feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness: this is called the conduit to existence. Their cessation is the cessation of the conduit to existence.”
