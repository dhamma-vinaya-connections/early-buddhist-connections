# SN23.17 Nonself

© Translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Bodhi.  (More copyright information)
1At Sāvatthī. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Radha said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, it is said, ‘nonself, nonself.’ What now, venerable sir, is nonself?"

"Form, Radha, is nonself, feeling is nonself, perception is nonself, volitional formations are nonself, consciousness is nonself. Seeing thus … He understands: ’ … there is no more for this state of being.’"
