# SN23.23 Māra

At Sāvatthī. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Rādha said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute.”

“Rādha, you should abandon desire, you should abandon lust, you should abandon desire and lust, for whatever is Māra. And what, Rādha, is Māra? Form is Māra. Feeling … Perception … Volitional formations … Consciousness is Māra. Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”
