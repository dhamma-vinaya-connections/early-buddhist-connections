# SN28.10 Sucimukhī

On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Then, in the morning, the Venerable Sāriputta dressed and, taking bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms. Then, when he had walked for alms on continuous alms round in Rājagaha, he ate that almsfood leaning against a certain wall.

Then the female wanderer Sucimukhī approached the Venerable Sāriputta and said to him: “Ascetic, do you eat facing downwards?ʺ

“I don’t eat facing downwards, sister.”

“Then, ascetic, do you eat facing upwards?”

“I don’t eat facing upwards, sister.” \[239\]

“Then, ascetic, do you eat facing the \[four\] quarters?”

“I don’t eat facing the \[four\] quarters, sister.”

“Then, ascetic, do you eat facing the intermediate directions?”

“I don’t eat facing the intermediate directions, sister.”

“When you are asked, ‘Ascetic, do you eat facing downwards? ’… ‘Do you eat facing the intermediate directions?’ you reply, ‘I don’t eat thus, sister.’ How then do you eat, ascetic?”

“Sister, those ascetics and brahmins who earn their living by the debased art of geomancy—a wrong means of livelihood—these are called ascetics and brahmins who eat facing downwards. Those ascetics and brahmins who earn their living by the debased art of astrology—a wrong means of livelihood—these are called ascetics and brahmins who eat facing upwards. Those ascetics and brahmins who earn their living by undertaking to go on errands and run messages—a wrong means of livelihood—these are called ascetics and brahmins who eat facing the \[four\] quarters. Those ascetics and brahmins who earn their living by the debased art of palmistry—a wrong means of livelihood—these are called ascetics and brahmins who eat facing the intermediate directions.

“Sister, I do not earn my living by such wrong means of livelihood as the debased art of geomancy, or the debased art of astrology, or by undertaking to go on errands and run messages, or by the debased art of palmistry. I seek almsfood righteously and, having sought it, I eat my almsfood righteously.” \[240\]

Then the female wanderer Sucimukhī went from street to street and from square to square in Rājagaha announcing: “The ascetics following the Sakyan son eat righteous food; they eat blameless food. Give almsfood to the ascetics following the Sakyan son.”
