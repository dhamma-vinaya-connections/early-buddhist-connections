## Chapter 12: The Brahmins

142. Varṣākāra
Fascicle 35 of the _Medium Discourses_
Translated by the Kashmiri Tripiṭa Gautama Saṅghadeva during the Eastern Jin (398 CE)
Chapter 12: The Brahmins
- [142] Varṣākāra, [143] Saṅgāra, [144] the Mathematician,    
    [145] Gomaya, [146] the Parable of the Elephant’s Footprint,    
    [147] The Virtue of Learning, [148] What’s Suffering? [149] Desire,    
    [150] Aiṣukāri, and [151] Asaha.
Varṣākāra Visits the Buddha
1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma142note01) One time, the Buddha travelled to Rājagṛha and was staying on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa.
2. It was then that the King of Magadha Ajātaśatru, who was the son of a wise woman,[2](#^ma142note02) and the Vṛji disliked each other. He often said this while he was with his entourage: “The people of Vṛji have great willpower, great dignity, great fortune, and great spirit. I will wipe out the Vṛji tribes and destroy Vṛji. I’ll cause a measureless disaster to befall those Vṛji people.”
3. When King Ajātaśatru heard that the Bhagavān had travelled to Rājagṛha and was staying on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa, he told his great minister Varṣākāra:[3](#^ma142note03) “I’ve heard that the ascetic Gautama has travelled to Rājagṛha and is staying on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa. Varṣākāra, you go to the ascetic Gautama and ask in my name: ‘Is the sage feeling well, in good health, and as energetic as usual?’ Then you are to say to him, ‘Gautama, the King of Magadha Ajātaśatru, who is the son of a wise woman, greets you and asks whether the sage is feeling well, in good health, and as energetic as usual? Gautama, King Ajātaśatru and the Vṛji dislike each other. He often says this while he’s with his entourage: “The people of Vṛji have great willpower, great dignity, great fortune, and great spirit. I will wipe out the Vṛji tribes and destroy Vṛji. I will cause a measureless disaster to befall those Vṛji people.” What does the ascetic Gautama have to say about that?’ Varṣākāra, if the ascetic Gautama has something to say about it, remember it well. Why is that? Such men as he never speak falsely.”
4. Having accepted the King’s instructions, the great minister Varṣākāra mounted an excellent chariot and left Rājagṛha with five hundred other chariots to visit Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa. He ascended Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa after dismounting and proceeded on foot to visit the Buddha. Then, he exchanged greetings with the Bhagavān and withdrew to sit to one side. He said, “Gautama, the King of Magadha Ajātaśatru, who is the son of a wise woman, greets you and asks whether the sage is feeling well, in good health, and as energetic as usual? Gautama, King Ajātaśatru and the Vṛji dislike each other. He often says this while he’s with his entourage: ‘The people of Vṛji have great willpower, great dignity, great fortune, and great spirit. I will wipe out the Vṛji tribes and destroy Vṛji. I’ll cause a measureless disaster to befall those Vṛji people.’ What does the ascetic Gautama have to say about that?”
Seven Ways the Vṛji Do Not Decline
5. Having heard this, the Bhagavān told him, “Varṣākāra, I once travelled to Vṛji in the past. That country has a temple called Cāpāla.[4](#^ma142note04) Varṣākāra, I taught the people of Vṛji seven ways to not decline then, and the people of Vṛji were able to accept and practice those seven ways to not decline. Varṣākāra, if the people of Vṛji practice the seven ways to not decline and they don’t violate them, then Vṛji will surely be victorious and won’t decline.”
6. That great minister Varṣākāra said to the Bhagavān, “The ascetic Gautama has briefly described this matter without discerning it in detail. We aren’t able to understand its meaning. Please, ascetic Gautama, discern it fully for us so that we might know its meaning.”
The Bhagavān told him, “Listen closely, Varṣākāra, and consider it well. I will discuss the meaning of this in more detail for you.” That great minister Varṣākāra accepted the teaching and listened.[5](#^ma142note05)
7. At the time, Venerable Ānanda was holding a fan and attending to the Buddha. The Bhagavān turned around and asked him, “Ānanda, have you heard whether the Vṛji hold frequent meetings and have large gatherings?”[6](#^ma142note06)
Venerable Ānanda replied, “Bhagavān, I have heard that the Vṛji hold frequent meetings and have large gatherings.”
The Bhagavān then told Varṣākāra, “If those Vṛji hold frequent meetings and have large gatherings, then the Vṛji will surely be victorious and won’t decline.”
8. The Bhagavān again asked Venerable Ānanda, “Have you heard that the Vṛji assemble together, conduct the affairs of Vṛji together, and rise together?”[7](#^ma142note07)
Venerable Ānanda said, “Bhagavān, I have heard that the Vṛji assemble together, conduct the affairs of Vṛji together, and rise together.”
The Bhagavān then told Varṣākāra, “If those Vṛji assemble together, conduct the affairs of Vṛji together, and rise together, then Vṛji will surely be victorious and won’t decline.”
9. The Bhagavān again asked Venerable Ānanda, “Have you heard that the Vṛji don’t establish what’s yet to be established, don’t change what has been established, and accept the ancient Vṛji law?”[8](#^ma142note08)
Venerable Ānanda said, “Bhagavān, I have heard that the Vṛji don’t establish what’s yet to be established, don’t change what has been established, and accept the ancient Vṛji law.”
The Bhagavān then told Varṣākāra, “If those Vṛji don’t establish what’s yet to be established, don’t change what has been established, and accept the ancient Vṛji law, then Vṛji will surely be victorious and won’t decline.”
10. The Bhagavān again asked Venerable Ānanda, “Have you heard that the Vṛji don’t forcefully violate another’s wife or another’s maiden?”[9](#^ma142note09)
Venerable Ānanda said, “Bhagavān, I have heard that the Vṛji don’t forcefully violate another’s wife or another’s maiden.”
The Bhagavān then told Varṣākāra, “If those Vṛji don’t forcefully violate another’s wife or another’s maiden, then Vṛji will surely be victorious and won’t decline.”
11. The Bhagavān again asked Venerable Ānanda, “Have you heard that the Vṛji have famous and virtuous sages, and all the Vṛji people honor, respect, give them offerings, and accept the teachings that they hear from them?”[10](#^ma142note10)
Venerable Ānanda said, “Bhagavān, I have heard that the Vṛji have famous and virtuous sages, and all the Vṛji people honor, respect, give them offerings, and accept the teachings that they hear from them.”
The Bhagavān then told Varṣākāra, “If the Vṛji have famous and virtuous sages, and all the Vṛji people honor, respect, give them offerings, and accept the teachings that they hear from them, then Vṛji will surely be victorious and won’t decline.”
12. The Bhagavān again asked Venerable Ānanda, “Have you heard that Vṛji has ancient temples that all the Vṛji people decorate, venerate, and give support and honors, never being remiss in doing what has been done and not reducing what has been done in the past?”[11](#^ma142note11)
Venerable Ānanda said, “Bhagavān, I have heard that Vṛji has ancient temples that all the Vṛji people decorate, venerate, and give support and honors, never being remiss in doing what has been done and not reducing what has been done in the past.”
The Bhagavān then told Varṣākāra, “If Vṛji has ancient temples that all the Vṛji people decorate, venerate, and give support and honors, never being remiss in doing what has been done and not reducing what has been done in the past, then Vṛji will surely be victorious and won’t decline.”
13. The Bhagavān again asked Venerable Ānanda, “Have you heard that the Vṛji all protect the _arhat_s with the greatest affection and respect? Do they always wish for future _arhat_s to go there and live happily for a long time once they do? Do they always ensure that they are not in want of clothing, food, bedding, medicine, or any other accoutrements of life?”[12](#^ma142note12)
Venerable Ānanda said, “Bhagavān, I have heard that the Vṛji all protect the _arhat_s with the greatest affection and respect. They always wish for future _arhat_s to go there and live happily for a long time once they do. They always ensure that they are not in want of clothing, food, bedding, medicine, or any other accoutrements of life.”
The Bhagavān then told Varṣākāra, “If those Vṛji all protect the _arhat_s with the greatest affection and respect, always wish for future _arhat_s to go there and live happily for a long time once they do, and always ensure that they are not in want of clothing, food, bedding, medicine, or any other accoutrements of life, then Vṛji will surely be victorious and won’t decline.
14. “Varṣākāra, the Vṛji practice these seven ways to not decline. Given that they’ve adopted these seven ways to not decline, the Vṛji will surely be victorious and won’t decline.”
15. Thereupon, Varṣākāra rose from his seat, adjusted his robe to bare his shoulder, and saluted the Buddha with his palms together. He said, “Gautama, supposing that the Vṛji accomplished one of these ways to not decline, the King of Magadha Ajātaśatru, who is the son of a wise woman, could not defeat them. How could he if they possess all seven ways to not decline? Gautama, I have many duties of state. I request leave to return to them.”
The Bhagavān replied, “You may go when you wish.”
16. That great minister Varṣākāra then remembered well what he had heard the Buddha say. He got up, circled the Bhagavān three times, and departed.
Seven Ways to Prevent the Decline of the Dharma
17. Then, not long after Varṣākāra was gone, the Bhagavān turned around and said, “Ānanda, go call all the monks who are staying anywhere on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa to the meeting hall. Come back and tell me once they’ve all gathered.”
18. Venerable Ānanda accepted the Buddha’s instructions: “Very well, Bhagavān.” Venerable Ānanda then went around announcing: “If there are monks staying anywhere on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa, they are to assembly in the meeting hall now.” Once they had all gathered there, he returned to the Buddha, bowed his head to him, and withdrew to sit at one side. He said, “Bhagavān, I have made the announcement: ‘If there are monks staying anywhere on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa, they are to assembly in the meeting hall now,’ and they have gathered there. Please let the Bhagavān decide when it’s time.”
19. Then, the Bhagavān led Venerable Ānanda to the meeting hall, arranged a seat there, and sat in front of the assembled monks. He then addressed the monks, “Now, I will teach you seven ways to not decline. All of you, listen closely, and consider it well.”
The monks then said, “Very well!”
20. The Buddha said, “What are the seven? If the monks hold frequent meetings and have large gatherings, they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline.[13](#^ma142note13)
21. “If the monks assemble in unity, perform the community’s duties together, and get up together,[14](#^ma142note14) they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline.
22. “If the monks do not establish what has yet to be established, don’t change what has been established in the past, and put the precepts that I have taught into practice well,[15](#^ma142note15) they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline.
23. “If the monks don’t follow cravings for a future existence that arise together with delight and desire or the love of this or that existence,[16](#^ma142note16) they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline.
24. “If the monks train in the religious practice together with senior honored ones whom they all respect, honor, and support and from whom they accept the teachings that they hear,[17](#^ma142note17) then they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline.
25. “If the monks have places in mountain forests, on high peaks, or in secluded dwellings that are quiet, peaceful, without noise, far away, without evils, and devoid of people where they sit in repose while living happily and not leaving,[18](#^ma142note18) then they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline.
26. “Suppose the monks all protect religious practitioners, having the utmost affection and respect for them. Suppose they always hope religious practitioners will come in the future and that those who have arrived will be happy to stay for a long time. Suppose they always ensure that religious practitioners want not for clothing, food, bedding, medicine, and any other accoutrements of life. Then, they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline. If the monks practice these seven ways to not decline, keeping and not violating them,[19](#^ma142note19) then they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline.”
More Ways to Prevent the Decline of the Dharma
27. The Bhagavān then addressed the monks again, “I will teach you another seven ways to not decline. All of you, listen closely and consider it well.”[20](#^ma142note20)
The monks then said, “Very well!”
28. The Buddha said, “What are the seven? If the monks respect, take very seriously, support, and serve [1] the venerable teacher, then they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline. If the monks respect, take very seriously, support, and serve [2] the Dharma … [3] Saṅgha … [4] precepts … [5] carefulness … [6] benefactors … [7] _samādhi_, then they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline. If the monks practice these seven ways to not decline, remembering and not violating them, then they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline.”[21](#^ma142note21)
29. The Bhagavān then addressed the monks again, “I will teach you another seven ways to not decline. All of you, listen closely and consider it well.”
The monks then said, “Very well!”
30. The Buddha said, “What are the seven? [1] If the monks don’t undertake work, don’t enjoy work, and don’t practice work, then the monks will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline … [2] don’t undertake boisterous talk, don’t enjoy boisterous talk, and don’t practice boisterous talk … [3] don’t undertake gatherings, don’t enjoy gatherings, and don’t practice gatherings … [4] don’t undertake mixing together, don’t enjoy mixing together, and don’t practice mixing together … [5] don’t undertake being sleepy, don’t enjoy being sleepy, and don’t practice being sleepy … [6] don’t practice the religious life for profit, fame, or another person … [7] don’t give up in the middle of the effort to bring about merit and benefit for a moment for merit and benefit … the monks will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline. If the monks practice these seven ways to not decline, remembering and not violating them, then they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline.”[22](#^ma142note22)
31. The Bhagavān then addressed the monks again, “I will teach you another seven ways to not decline. All of you, listen closely and consider it well.”
The monks then said, “Very well!”
32. The Buddha said, “What are the seven? If the monks accomplish wealth in faith … wealth in precepts … wealth in modesty … wealth in conscience … wealth in broad learning … wealth in generosity … accomplish wealth in wisdom, they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline. If the monks practice these seven ways to not decline, remembering and not violating them, then they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline.”[23](#^ma142note23)
33. The Bhagavān then addressed the monks again, “I will teach you another seven ways to not decline. All of you, listen closely and consider it well.”
The monks then said, “Very well!”
34. The Buddha said, “What are the seven? If the monks accomplish the power of faith … power of energy … power of modesty … power of conscience … power of mindfulness … power of _samādhi_ … accomplish the power of wisdom, they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline. If the monks practice these seven ways to not decline, remembering and not violating them, then they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline.”[24](#^ma142note24)
35. The Bhagavān then addressed the monks again, “I will teach you another seven ways to not decline. All of you, listen closely and consider it well.”
The monks then said, “Very well!”
36. The Buddha said, “What are the seven? If the monks cultivate the awakening factor of mindfulness with the support of seclusion, lack of desire, and cessation that lead to escape … analyzing teachings … effort … joy … calm … _samādhi_ … cultivate the awakening factor of equanimity with the support of seclusion, lack of desire, and cessation that lead to escape, they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline. If the monks practice these seven ways to not decline, remembering and not violating them, then they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline.”[25](#^ma142note25)
37. The Bhagavān then addressed the monks again, “I will teach you another seven ways to not decline. All of you, listen closely and consider it well.”
The monks then said, “Very well!”
38. The Buddha said, “[1] If the monks should be granted the Vinaya in person and are granted the Vinaya in person … [2] should be granted the Vinaya in memory and are granted the Vinaya in memory … [3] should be granted the Vinaya without uncertainty and are granted the Vinaya without uncertainty … [4] should be granted their own confession and are granted their own confession … [5] should be granted living quarters and are granted living quarters … [6] should be granted a place in the order and are granted a place in the order … [7] will stop disputes when they arise in the community with the rules to stop them like sweeping away refuse, they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline. If the monks practice these seven ways to not decline, remembering and not violating them, then they will surely be victorious and the Dharma won’t decline.”[26](#^ma142note26)
39. The Bhagavān then addressed the monks again, “I will teach you another six ways of giving comfort. All of you, listen closely and consider it well.”
The monks then said, “Very well!”
40. The Buddha said, “What are the six? [1] Being kind in one’s physical conduct towards religious practitioners is a way of giving comfort, a way of affection, and a way of happiness. It ensures affection, ensures honor, ensures acceptance, ensures respect, ensures cultivation, and ensures inclusion. One becomes an ascetic, becomes whole-hearted, becomes energetic, and gains _nirvāṇa_. _Likewise are [2] kind verbal conduct and [3] kind mental conduct._
41. “[4] If there’s something beneficial that’s obtained according to the Dharma [such as] getting a meal for oneself that’s put into one’s bowl, sharing such beneficial things with other religious practitioners is a way of giving comfort, a way of affection, and a way of happiness. It ensures affection, ensures honor, ensures acceptance, ensures respect, ensures cultivation, and ensures inclusion. One becomes an ascetic, becomes whole-hearted, becomes energetic, and gains _nirvāṇa_.
42. “[5] Suppose there are precepts that are not omitted, not breached, not polluted, without blackness, like the Earth in not following others, commended by noble people, and fully and well remembered. Such precepts that are given to religious practitioners are a way of giving comfort, a way of affection, and a way of happiness. They ensure affection, ensure honor, ensure acceptance, ensure respect, ensure cultivation, and ensure inclusion. One becomes an ascetic, becomes whole-hearted, becomes energetic, and gains _nirvāṇa_.
43. “[6] Suppose there are views that are a noble escape, that comprehend and penetrate deeply, and that can reach the proper end to suffering. Such views given to religious practitioners are a way of giving comfort, a way of affection, and a way of happiness. They ensure affection, ensure honor, ensure acceptance, ensure respect, ensure cultivation, and ensure inclusion. One becomes an ascetic, becomes whole-hearted, becomes energetic, and gains _nirvāṇa_. I had said I would state the six ways of giving comfort, and that’s why I have taught them.”[27](#^ma142note27)
44. This is what the Buddha said. The monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved. ^ma142note01-ref ^ma142note02-ref ^ma142note03-ref ^ma142note04-ref ^ma142note05-ref ^ma142note06-ref ^ma142note07-ref ^ma142note08-ref ^ma142note09-ref ^ma142note10-ref ^ma142note11-ref ^ma142note12-ref ^ma142note13-ref ^ma142note14-ref ^ma142note15-ref ^ma142note16-ref ^ma142note17-ref ^ma142note18-ref ^ma142note19-ref ^ma142note20-ref ^ma142note21-ref ^ma142note22-ref ^ma142note23-ref ^ma142note24-ref ^ma142note25-ref ^ma142note26-ref ^ma142note27-ref

### Notes

^ma142note01
1. For the source text, cf. [T26.1.648a24-50b8]. The direct parallels to this _sūtra_ include [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN7/AN7.22]], [[EĀ40.2]](../ekottarika/40/EA_40_02.html), and [T211, Chapter 36](../../02_avadana/dharmapada/T211/T211c36v1.html). Parallels are also found in most of the extant editions of the Parinirvāṇa Sūtra ([DĀ 2](../dirgha/DA_2.html), [DN 16], T5-7, T1451, and the [Sanskrit] and Tibetan versions). In the case of T7, however, the story of Varṣākāra is absent. Instead, the seven ways to not decline are taught to the Licchavis after the Buddha has announced his impending _parinirvāṇa_. This then leads to other lists being taught that are vaguely similar to those found in the other parallels. 

[↩︎](#^ma142note01-ref)

^ma142note02
2. _King of Magadha Ajātaśatru, who was the son of a wise woman_. C. 摩竭陀王、未生怨、鞞陀提子, P. _rājā māgadho ajātasattu vedehiputto_, S. _rājā māgadho ’jātaśatrur vaidehīputro_. Here, the C. translates Ajātaśatru’s name as “Yet-to-be Born Enemy” or “Enemy Before Birth” (未生怨), which is usually understood to refer to a prophesy made to his mother while she was pregnant that her unborn son would kill his father. This was likely an epithet and not his given name.
    
    The C. also includes an epithet equiv. to P. _vedehiputta_, but here _vedehi_ was pronounced _vadadi_ or perhaps _vededi_ (i.e., EMC 鞞陀提 = IPA bei-da-dei). Both words are attested in G. as forms of the S. verb _vedayate_, which meant “to know, experience, explain, make known.” This might well be the source of the tradition reported to us by Buddhaghosa that _vedehi_ meant “the wise woman.” Here, this was apparently the literal meaning of the epithet. I have rendered the epithet as such given the EMC pronunciation.

^ma142note03
3. _great minister Varṣākāra_. C. 大臣雨勢, P. _vassakāra brāhmaṇa magadhamahāmatta_, S. _varṣākāra brāhmaṇamagadhamahāmātra_. The C. translates Varṣākāra lit. as “power” or “vitality of rain.” His title is translated simply as “great minister.” This translated S. _mahāmātra_ (“prime minister”), but the added details of being a brahmin from Magadha are not included as they are in DN 16 and Waldschmidt’s Sanskrit. The more verbose edition in T1451 does call him a brahmin as well as a prime minister. 

[↩︎](#^ma142note03-ref)

^ma142note04
4. _a temple called Cāpāla_. C. 寺名遮惒邏 (EMC “temple named” + tʃɪă-ɦua-la), C. 急疾神舍 (T5), C. 躁神舍 (T6), P. _sārandada cetiya_, S. _cāpāla caitya_ (Waldschmidt). It would seem that what we have here is a G. reading of S. _cāpāla_ as _cavala_. This is supported by the shrine being named _cāpāla_ in Waldschmidt’s Sanskrit edition, but the shrine is not mentioned in T1451.
    
    In G., _cavala_ could be read lit. to mean “wavering, trembling” or “quick.” The first reading agrees with that of P. _capala_. The second reading was perhaps derived from S. _java_, where the _j-_ has changed to _c-_. These readings might explain the C. translations we find in T5 (急疾神舍 = lit. “the spirit house of quickness”) and T6 (躁神舍 = lit. “spirit house of being unsettled”). The Theravāda tradition departs from the Sarvāstivāda on this detail of the story, naming the shrine _sārandada_.

5. What follows is a set of seven practices or customs considered to make a country difficult to conquer. Presumably, this is because such a country is well organized and unified through maintenance of strong social bonds, continuous communication, and cooperative planning and governance. These principles are then restated in a different context as advice for the community of monks to follow. After that restatement, a series of related lists are given to reiterate the basic idea that a religious community that maintains a solid social and moral basis will endure.
    
    There are a total of one partial ([[EĀ40.2]]) and six full parallels (DN 16, Waldschmidt, DĀ 2, T5, T6, and T1451) for this portion of MĀ 142. There is quite a bit of diversity and variation between them. However, this version has a clear relationship with DN 16 and Waldschmidt’s Sanskrit edition, leading me to believe that they descended from a common text. That common text, however, seems to have included only this initial list of seven practices by the Vṛji and their corollaries taught to the monks after Varṣākāra departs the scene. I say this because the remaining material is quite different between MĀ 142, DN 16, and the Sanskrit. That increase in diversity is also reflected in the other parallels. I suspect the remainder was added at some later date, after the various sectarian recensions were established in regional canons.
    
    Going forward, I will confine myself to comparing this version to that found in DN 16 and Waldschmidt’s Sanskrit, making observations about the other parallels only when the larger context is significant. 

[↩︎](#^ma142note05-ref)

^ma142note06
6. _the Vṛji hold frequent meetings and have large gatherings_. C. 䟦耆數數集會，多聚集, P. _vajjī abhiṇhaṁ sannipātā sannipātabahulā_, S. _vṛjayo ’bhīkṣṇasannipātā abhīkṣṇaṃ sannipātabahulā viharanti_ (Waldschmidt).
    
    With the exception of [[EĀ40.2]], the parallels agree on the initial “frequent meetings” but disagree on the follow up description. These three versions all reiterate it with “large (or many) meetings,” but other parallels specify the purpose of the meetings (e.g., to discuss the law or arrange a common defense). 

[↩︎](#^ma142note06-ref)

^ma142note07
7. _the Vṛji assemble together, conduct the affairs of Vṛji together, and rise together_. C. 䟦耆共俱集會，俱作䟦耆事，共俱起, P. _vajjī samaggā sannipatanti, samaggā vuṭṭhahanti, samaggā vajjikaraṇīyāni karontī_, S. _vṛjayaḥ samagrāḥ sannipatanti samagrā vyuttiṣṭhanti samagrā vṛjikaraṇīyāni kurvanti_ (Waldschmidt).
    
    Here, again, these three versions are remarkably similar, differing only in the order of the three things the Vṛji do together. The other parallels have versions that emphasize harmony between those in high and low social positions. 

[↩︎](#^ma142note07-ref)

^ma142note08
8. _the Vṛji don’t establish what’s yet to be established, don’t change what has been established, and accept the ancient Vṛji law_. C. 䟦耆未施設者不更施設，本所施設而不改易，舊䟦耆法善奉行, P. _vajjī apaññattaṁ na paññapenti, paññattaṁ na samucchindanti, yathāpaññatte porāṇe vajjidhamme samādāya vattantī_, S. _’praṇihitaṃ na praṇidadhati praṇihitaṃ ca na samucchindati yathāprajñaptaṃ vṛjidharmaṃ samādāya vartante_ (Waldschmidt).
    
    Here, again, these three versions are nearly verbatim of each other. The other parallels have more of a focus on the people of Vṛji being law abiding and being anxious about any violations they might make. 

[↩︎](#^ma142note08-ref)

9. _the Vṛji don’t forcefully violate another’s wife or another’s maiden_. C. 䟦耆不以力勢而犯他婦、他童女, P. _vajjī yā tā kulitthiyo kulakumāriyo, tā na okkassa pasayha vāsentī_, S. _yās tā vṛjīnāṃ vṛjiprajāpatyo vṛjikumārikāś ca pitṛrakṣitā mātṛrakṣitā bhrātṛrakṣitā bhaginīrakṣitāḥ śvaśurarakṣitā śvaśrurakṣitā jñātirakṣitā gotrarakṣitāḥ saparidaṇḍāḥ sasvāmikāḥ kanyāḥ paraparigṛ(hītā antaśo mālāguṇaparikṣiptā api tadrūpāsu na sahasā balenānupraskandya kāmeṣu cāritram āpadyante_ (Waldschmidt).
    
    Here, DN 16 reverses the order of items four and five compared to all of the Sarvāstivāda parallels (including T1451). The P. parallel is succinct like this version here in MĀ 142. Waldschmidt and T1451 are both much more verbose, mainly because they exhaustively list the relatives who might serve as the guardian of a woman. The other parallels have a more general statement about men and women obeying the ettiquette governing their relationships, or that men are not lustfully attached to a woman’s form.

10. _the Vṛji have famous and virtuous sages, and all the Vṛji people honor, respect, give them offerings, and accept the teachings that they hear from them_. C. 䟦耆有名德尊重者，䟦耆悉共宗敬、恭奉、供養，於彼聞教則受, P. _vajjī ye te vajjīnaṁ vajjimahallakā, te sakkaronti garuṁ karonti mānenti pūjenti, tesañca sotabbaṁ maññantī_, S. _ye te vṛjīnāṃ vṛjimahallakās tān satkurvanti gurukurvanti mānayanti pūjayanti teṣāṃ vacanaṃ śrotavyaṃ manyante_ (Waldschmidt).
    
    All three versions are very similar, except that this is item 4 in DN 16’s list. T1451, however, has the Vṛji respecting their parents and teachers specifically, which is in agreement with the other parallels rather than the Theravāda-Sarvāstivāda version.

^ma142note11
11. _Vṛji has ancient temples that all the Vṛji people decorate, venerate, and give support and honors, never being remiss in doing what has been done and not reducing what has been done in the past_. C. 䟦耆所有舊寺，䟦耆悉共修飾，遵奉、供養、禮事，本之所施常作不廢，本之所為不減損, P. _vajjī yāni tāni vajjīnaṁ vajjicetiyāni abbhantarāni ceva bāhirāni ca, tāni sakkaronti garuṁ karonti mānenti pūjenti, tesañca dinnapubbaṁ katapubbaṁ dhammikaṁ baliṁ no parihāpentī_, S. _vṛjayo ye te vṛjīnāṃ caturdikṣu vṛjicaityās tān satkurvanti gurukurvanti mānayanti pūjayanti teṣāṃ ca paurāṇaṃ cihnavṛttaṃ na samucchindanti_ (Waldschmidt).
    
    All the parallels include an item toward the end of this list (either item 6 or 7) that recommends the Vṛji continue to venerate their shrines, spirits, or both in the traditional way. This was clearly one of the original items in the list.

^ma142note12
12. _the Vṛji all protect the _arhat_s with the greatest affection and respect? Do they always wish for future _arhat_s to go there and live happily for a long time once they do? Do they always ensure that they are not in want of clothing, food, bedding, medicine, or any other accoutrements of life?_ C. 䟦耆悉共擁護諸阿羅訶，極大愛敬？常願未來阿羅訶者而欲令來，既已來者樂恒久住？常使不乏衣被、飲食、床榻、湯藥、諸生活具, P. _vajjīnaṁ arahantesu dhammikā rakkhāvaraṇagutti susaṁvihitā, kinti anāgatā ca arahanto vijitaṁ āgaccheyyuṁ, āgatā ca arahanto vijite phāsu vihareyyun_, S. _vṛjīnām arhatām antike tīvracetasa ārakṣāsmṛtiḥ pratyupasthitā kaccid anāgatāś cārhanta āgaccheyur āgatāś cābhirameraṃs te ca na vihanyerañ cīvarapiṇḍapātaśayanāsanaglānapratyayabhaiṣajyapariṣkāraiḥ_ (Waldschmidt).
    
    This item is actually one long question, which I’ve broken into three for readability’s sake.
    
    All of the Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda parallels agree in encouraging the Vṛji to support the _arhat_s and attract them to their land. The other parallels are not so specific. They reference religious practitioners in general as sages, brahmins, and/or ascetics. One version (T6) does mention _arhat_s along with the other practitioners. It would seem that the Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda versions took a more sectarian tack with this item.

^ma142note13
13. cf. C. 若比丘數數集會，多聚集者，比丘必勝，則法不衰, P. _Yāvakīvañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhū abhiṇhaṁ sannipātā sannipātabahulā bhavissanti, vuddhiyeva, bhikkhave, bhikkhūnaṁ pāṭikaṅkhā, no parihāni._, S. _yāvac ca bhikṣavo ’bhīkṣṇasannipātā abhīkṣṇaṃ sannipātabahulā vihariṣyanti vṛddhir eva bhikṣūṇāṃ pratikāṃkṣitavyā kuśalānāṃ dharmāṇāṃ na parihāṇiḥ_ (Waldschmidt).
    
    The most important part of this item is nearly identical to the Pali parallel in DN 16: _Yāvakīvañca_ (若)_, bhikkhave, bhikkhū_ (比丘) _abhiṇhaṁ_ (數數) _sannipātā_ (集會) _sannipātabahulā_ (多聚集) _bhavissanti_.
    
    The conclusion, however, differs: In Pali, the monks can expect (_pāṭikaṅkhā_) to grow (_vuddhiyeva_) and not decline (_no parihāni_). In this Sarvāstivāda version, they will surely be victorious (必勝), and the Dharma won’t decline (法不衰). The Sanskrit edition partially agrees with both: The monks can expect to grow (_vṛddhir eva bhikṣūṇāṃ pratikāṃkṣitavyā_), and the good _dharma_s won’t decline (_kuśalānāṃ dharmāṇāṃ na parihāṇiḥ_). The Pali version would seem the closest to the original, assuming that it simply substituted the Saṅgha for the Vṛji.

^ma142note14
14. cf. C. 共齊集會，俱作眾事，共俱起, P. _samaggā sannipatissanti, samaggā vuṭṭhahissanti, samaggā saṅghakaraṇīyāni karissanti_, S. _samagrāḥ sannipatiṣyanti samagrā vyutthāsyanti samagrāḥ saṃghakaraṇīyāni kariṣyanti_ (Waldschmidt).
    
    Here it would seem that the C. translates an equiv. of P. _samaggā_ (S. _samagrā_) with different expressions (共齊, 俱, and 共俱) that are all synonyms for “together.” 共齊 has a stronger connotation of unity, given the primary meaning of 齊 (“uniform, equal, regular”).
    
    Otherwise, the Pali matches the meaning of the C. here closely (集會 = _sannipatissanti_, 作眾事 = _saṅghakaraṇīyāni karissanti_, 起 = _vuṭṭhahissanti_), excepting that the order is a little different. It seems more logical than the Pali and Sanskrit parallels as a description of monks coming together for a meeting, conducting business, and then departing. 

[↩︎](#^ma142note14-ref)

^ma142note15
15. cf. C. 未施設事不更施設，本所施設而不改易，我所說戒善奉行, P. _apaññattaṁ na paññapessanti, paññattaṁ na samucchindissanti, yathāpaññattesu sikkhāpadesu samādāya vattissanti_, S. _’praṇihitaṃ na praṇidhāsyanti praṇihitaṃ ca na samucchetsyanti yathāprajñaptikāṃ śikṣāṃ samādāya vartiṣyante_ (Waldschmidt).
    
    施設 (“to arrange, set up, implement”) translates a word like P. _paññatta_ (“prepared, readied; declared, made known”). In this passage, _paññatta_ is usually read to mean “declared, made known, decreed,” but the C. translation matches the “readied, prepared” reading better. I’ve translated it as “to establish or institute” as a compromise. It seems to refer to the institution or changing of Vinaya rules by the monks. The Sanskrit has a different word, _praṇihita_, which has a wide set of meanings, but perhaps meant “resolve upon, determined, agreed to” in this context.
    
    Another difference is that 改易 here does not equate to P. _samucchindissanti_ or S. _samucchetsyanti_, which both mean “to abolish, completely eliminate.” Rather, 改易 means “to reform, change.”
    
    The overall conclusion is that a divergence in wording has formed between the P. and S. and this version of the list, but it’s superficial. The basic structure and meaning that’s shared between these three texts is preserved. 

[↩︎](#^ma142note15-ref)

^ma142note16
16. cf. C. 此未來有愛，喜、欲共俱，愛樂彼彼有起不隨, P. _uppannāya taṇhāya ponobbhavikāya na vasaṁ gacchissanti_, S. _tṛṣṇāyāḥ paunarbhavikyā nandirāgasahagatāyās tatra tatrābhinandinyā vaśaṃ na gacchanti_ (Waldschmidt).
    
    In DN 16, this is the fifth item of the list. Here, the C. and S. versions match each other fairly well, both being more verbose than the P. version. We can safely assume that they reflect some early Sarvāstivāda source that expanded the description of craving for a future existence.
    
    The S. version includes the beginning and ending found in the P. but has _nandirāgasahagatāyās tatra tatrābhinandinyā_ inserted between them, which is less apparent in the C. version because the verb “to arise” (起) is at the end of the expression rather than being an adjective at the start. Also, there is no equiv. for P. _vasaṁ_ (S. _vaśaṃ_). We can see here that the divergences have increased even further compared to the first couple items of the list. 

[↩︎](#^ma142note16-ref)

^ma142note17
17. cf. C. 比丘有長老、上尊、俱學梵行，比丘悉共宗敬、恭奉、供養，於彼聞教則受, P. _ye te bhikkhū therā rattaññū cirapabbajitā saṅghapitaro saṅghapariṇāyakā, te sakkarissanti garuṁ karissanti mānessanti pūjessanti, tesañca sotabbaṁ maññissanti_, S. _ye te bhikṣavaḥ sthavirā rātrijñāś cirapravrajitā ............... tān satkariṣyanti gurukariṣyanti mānayiṣyanti pūjayiṣyanti teṣāṃ vacanaṃ śrotavyaṃ maṃsyante_ (Waldschmidt).
    
    In DN 16, this is the fourth item of the list. The P. and possibly the S. versions have a list of five epithets for senior and accomplished monks in the Saṅgha. I say possibly for the S. version because it includes the first three epithets found in P., but then the extant recensions were too damaged for Waldschmidt to extrapolate the other two epithets.
    
    Here, the C. version seems to only include two epithets: senior (長老) and honored (上尊). The remainder of their description says that they train together (俱學) in the religious life (梵行) with the other monks. The C. version found in T1451 departs from the list of epithets in DN 16 as well, but it’s much more verbose than this version. For whatever reason, we end up with a S. edition that is very similar to the P. version, but the two C. versions are divergent. 

[↩︎](#^ma142note17-ref)

^ma142note18
18. cf. C. 比丘有無事處山林、高巖，閑居靜處，寂無音聲，遠離，無惡，無有人民，隨順宴坐，樂住不離, P. _bhikkhū āraññakesu senāsanesu sāpekkhā bhavissanti_, S. _’raṇyavanaprasthāni prāntāni śayanāsanāny adhyāvasiṣyanti_ (Waldschmidt).
    
    Again, as with the previous item, the P. version in DN 16 and Waldscmidt’s S. version are terse, though the wording between them differs, and this is the case with T1451, too. Our C. version here is the outlier with a lengthy listing of different types of remote dwellings and why they are desirable as places for a monk to go into seclusion. While the basic meaning is the same in all four versions, they all have different wordings. 

[↩︎](#^ma142note18-ref)

^ma142note19
19. cf. C. 比丘悉共擁護諸梵行者，至重愛敬，常願未來諸梵行者而欲令來，既已來者樂恒久住，常使不乏衣被、飲食、床榻、湯藥、諸生活具, P. _bhikkhū paccattaññeva satiṁ upaṭṭhapessanti: ‘kinti anāgatā ca pesalā sabrahmacārī āgaccheyyuṁ, āgatā ca pesalā sabrahmacārī phāsu vihareyyun’ti_, S. _sabrahmacāriṇām antike tīvracetasa ārakṣāsmṛtiḥ pratyupasthitā kaccid anāgatāś ca sabrahmacāriṇa āgaccheyur āgatāś cābhirameraṃs te ca na vihanyerañ cīvarapiṇḍapātaśayanāsanaglānapratyayabhaiṣajyapariṣkārair_ (Waldschmidt).
    
    This version in C. is more verbose than DN 16 and diverges a bit more from the other versions. The main difference is that it enjoins the monks to have the utmost affection and respect for religious practitioners, where the other versions have the monks practicing right mindfulness. Otherwise, they have the same basic meanings as each other, differing mainly in the amount of detail added.

^ma142note20
20. At this point, there is a great deal more divergence between the parallels that include these additional lists. DN 16 includes four more sets of seven and a set of six. The S. version by Waldschmidt and T1451 include five more sets of seven and a set of six. This version in MĀ 142 includes six more sets of seven and a set of six, making it the largest. Thus, the number of additional lists varies between these closely related recensions, to say nothing of their content. It would seem that the reciters treated this material as ancilliary to the first list and improvised with additional lists. Or perhaps the material was expanded by each tradition independently over time, leading to significant differences. 

[↩︎](#^ma142note20-ref)

^ma142note21
21. This list is not found in DN 16. However, a parallel list occurs next in both Waldschmidt and T1451 with the same set of things for the monks to honor and support. The Sanskrit edition has a slightly different set of seven items: _śāstāra … dharma … śikṣā … anuśāsana … apramāda … pratisaṃstara … samādhi_. T1451’s list is closer to Waldschmidt’s edition: 大師處⋯法⋯戒⋯教授事⋯不放逸事⋯臥具事⋯修定事. This shows that there was some divergence here among Sarvāstivādins (MĀ 142) and Mūlasarvāstivādins (Waldschmidt & T1451). 

[↩︎](#^ma142note21-ref)

^ma142note22
22. The parallel list in DN 16 has these seven items: _kamma … bhassa … nidda … saṅgaṇika … pāpicchā pāpika iccha … pāpamittā pāpasahāyā pāpasampavaṅkā … oramattakena visesādhigamena antarāvosānaṁ_. It’s striking how the list changes from single words to longer descriptions. This occurs in MĀ 142 as well.
    
    T1451 has a list of six negative things and one positive: 作業⋯言談⋯睡眠⋯聚集及近惡友⋯名利參問他人⋯常修於定.
    
    Finally, we have Waldschmidt’s Sanskrit list which appears to mirror DN 16 (but which is unfortunately damaged): _karma … bhāṣya … nidra … saṃgaṇika .......... viśeṣādhigamenāntarāvasān._
    
    While we see a remarkable correspondence between Waldschmidt’s edition and DN 16, there is some diversity in the C. versions after the first four items. 

[↩︎](#^ma142note22-ref)

^ma142note23
23. Parallel lists are found in DN 16, T1451, and Waldschmidt, but this version is the only one that presents the list as forms of wealth. We do, however, find a very similar list of seven wealths in T6.
    
    There are minor differences in these parallel lists. DN 16 lists _saddhā … hirimanā … ottappī … bahussutā … āraddhavīriyā … upaṭṭhitassatī … paññavanto._ T1451 differs in substituting _samādhi_ or _samāhita_ for P. _bahussutā_ in its list: 淨信心⋯有慚⋯有愧⋯具大精勤⋯有念⋯定⋯慧. Waldschmidt’s edition agrees with T1451: _śrāddhā hrīmanto avatrāpiṇa ārabdhavīryā upasthitasmṛtayaḥ samāhitāḥ prajñāvanto_.
    
    Comparing these to the present text, we find that MĀ 142 includes precepts and generosity instead of making effort and mindfulness, but it does agree with DN 16 in including learning. The parallels overall have faith, modesty, conscience, and wisdom in common; the other three items vary in one way or another. 

[↩︎](#^ma142note23-ref)

^ma142note24
24. This list of seven powers does not appear among the other parallels. It inserts modesty and conscience after energy in the more standard five powers. This matches a list of seven powers found in other EBTs (e.g., [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN7/AN7.3]]-[4], [[[SĀ11.45]] (688)]). It would seem to be a combination of two lists of five powers, which differ only in substituting modesty and conscience for mindfulness and _samādhi_. 

[↩︎](#^ma142note24-ref)

^ma142note25
25. The seven factors of awakening are included in all the other parallels except for T5 (which has a completely different set of lists). 

[↩︎](#^ma142note25-ref)

^ma142note26
26. This last list of seven is unique to MĀ 142 among the parallels, which makes the practical interpretation of some of these items challenging. What, for instance, it meant by being “given the Vinaya in memory” (與憶律)? Perhaps it refers to being taught to recite it. What I have translated as “granted a place in the order” (與展轉) lit. means “granted a turn.” Presumably, it refers to one’s place in the line to receive alms, but there is no context provided. 

[↩︎](#^ma142note26-ref)

^ma142note27
27. Except for T5, this list is found at least partially in all of the parallels that include the additional lists. Even T7, which includes parallel lists in a different context, has a list of seven items that includes the first four items found here (cf. [T7.1.194b1]).
    
    This suggests to me that this last list is much older than the other additional lists of seven, but it has been expanded in some traditions. This version in MĀ 142 and the one in T1451 are verbose and yet differ from each other quite a bit. E.g., T1451 adds material to the first three items to describe specific ways in which a monk might show kindness to his fellow religious practitioners.
