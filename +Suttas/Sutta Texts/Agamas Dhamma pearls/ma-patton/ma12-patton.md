## Chapter 2: Related to Deeds

12. Vāṣpa
1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma12note01) One time, the Buddha was travelling among the Śākya people of Kapilavastu and stayed at the banyan tree park.[2](#^ma12note02)
2. It was then that Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana and a group of monks had assembled in the discussion hall after the midday meal to do some task. At the time, a Jain disciple[3](#^ma12note03) from the Śākya tribe named Vāṣpa[4](#^ma12note04) went for a walk in the afternoon. When he happened upon Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana, they exchanged greetings, and he withdrew to sit at one side.
3. Thereupon, Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana questioned that Jain about this topic: “Vāṣpa, what do you think? If a monk guards his body, speech, and mind, do you think that could cause him to produce contaminants that aren’t good, that lead to an afterlife?”
4. Vāṣpa replied, “Mahāmaudgalyāyana, if a monk guards his body, speech, and mind, I do think that could cause him to produce contaminants that aren’t good, that lead to an afterlife. Mahāmaudgalyāyana, if he had committed acts that aren’t good in a previous life, that would cause him to produce contaminants that aren’t good, that lead to an afterlife.”
5. At that time, the Bhagavān was sitting in a quiet place. Using his heavenly ear that goes beyond that of humans, he heard Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana and that Jain disciple of the Śākya tribe named Vāṣpa having this conversation. Having overheard them, the Bhagavān rose from his seat of repose that afternoon and went to the discussion hall. He prepared a seat in front of the assembled monks and sat down. Once he was seated, the Bhagavān asked, “Maudgalyāyana, what were you discussing with this Jain disciple of the Śākya tribe named Vāṣpa? And what was the reason for your meeting here in the discussion hall?”
6. Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana said, “Bhagavān, I and this group of monks assembled here in the discussion hall today after the midday meal to do something. This Jain disciple Vāṣpa was out walking this afternoon and came upon us. We exchanged greetings, and he withdrew to sit at one side. I questioned him about this: ‘Vāṣpa, what do you think? If a monk guards his body, speech, and mind, do you think that could cause him to produce contaminants that aren’t good, that lead to an afterlife?’
7. “Vāṣpa answered me: ‘If a monk guards his body, speech, and mind, I do think that could cause him to produce contaminants that aren’t good, that lead to an afterlife. Mahāmaudgalyāyana, if he committed acts that aren’t good in a previous life, that would cause him to produce contaminants that aren’t good, that lead to an afterlife.’ Bhagavān, this was the conversation between myself and Vāṣpa. This was the reason we assembled here in the discussion hall.”
8. The Bhagavān then said to Vāṣpa, “If what I say is correct, you should say, ‘So it is.’ If it isn’t correct, then you should say, ‘That’s not so.’ If you have doubts about it, then you can ask me, ‘Ascetic Gautama, what’s the reason for this? What’s the meaning of that?’ If you can accept what I say, then you and I can have a discussion about this topic.”
Vāṣpa replied, “Ascetic Gautama, if what you say is correct, I will say, ‘So it is.’ If it’s not correct, then I will say, ‘That’s not so.’ If I have doubts, I will ask Gautama, ‘Gautama, what’s the reason for this? What’s the meaning of that?’ I will then accept and retain what ascetic Gautama says about it. The ascetic Gautama will discuss this topic only with me.”
9. The Bhagavān then asked, “Vāṣpa, what do you think? Suppose a monk creates unskillful physical actions that were contaminants, afflictions, fevers, and griefs.[5](#^ma12note05) Some time after that, he ceases that unskillful physical action and doesn’t do any new deeds. Abandoning his former deeds, he then reaches the final end in the present life and has no affliction or fever.[6](#^ma12note06) He always lives unchanging, which is to say what is seen and known by a noble sage.
10. “As his bodily action was unskillful, his speech was unskillful, and his mental action was unskillful. His ignorant actions were contaminants, afflictions, fevers, and griefs. Some time after that, he ceases his unskillful and ignorant actions and doesn’t do any new deeds. Abandoning his former deeds, he then reaches the final end in the present life and has no affliction or fever. He always lives unchanging, which is to say what is seen and known by a noble sage.
11. “How is it, Vāṣpa? Do you think that a monk guarding his body, speech, and mind in this way could produce contaminants that aren’t good, that lead to an afterlife?”
Vāṣpa answered, “Gautama, if a monk guards his body, speech, and mind in this way, I don’t think that could cause him to produce contaminants that aren’t good, that lead to an afterlife.”
12. The Bhagavān commended him, “Good, Vāṣpa! How is it, Vāṣpa? Suppose a monk has ended ignorance and produced insight. Having ended ignorance and produced insight, the feelings of his last body arise, and then he knows, ‘The feelings of this last body are arising.’ The feelings of his last life arise, and then he knows, ‘The feelings of this last life are arising.’[7](#^ma12note07) His body breaks up and his life ends. Having reached the end of his life span, all the feelings from his present life completely subside. It should be known that he has reached the final cooling.
13. “Vāṣpa, it’s like a tree that causes a shadow to be cast. Suppose someone comes and chops that tree down at its root with a sharp axe. Piece by piece, they gradually chop it up, chopping it into ten or a hundred pieces. Then, they burn it until it’s reduced to ash. It might be blown away in the wind or dumped in a river. What do you think, Vāṣpa? That shadow had existed because of the tree. Would it cease and not arise again as a result of its cause having ended?”
Vāṣpa replied, “Yes, Gautama.”
14. “Vāṣpa, you should know that a monk who has ended ignorance and produced insight is likewise. Having ended ignorance and produced insight, the feelings of his last body arise, and then he knows, ‘The feelings of this last body are arising.’ The feelings of his last life arise, and then he knows, ‘The feelings of this last life are arising.’ His body breaks up and his life ends. Having reached the end of his life span, all the feelings from his present life completely subside. It should be known that he has reached the final cooling.
15. “Vāṣpa, a monk who is correctly liberated in mind in this way gains six good abiding places. What are the six? Vāṣpa, seeing forms with his eye, a monk isn’t pleased or displeased. With correct mindfulness and correct understanding, he abandons pursuits and does nothing.[8](#^ma12note08) Vāṣpa, this is called the first good abiding place gained by a monk who is correctly liberated in mind in this way. Thus … with his ear … nose … tongue … body … knowing notions with his mind, he isn’t pleased or displeased. With correct mindfulness and correct understanding, he abandons pursuits and does nothing. Vāṣpa, this is called the sixth good abiding place gained by a monk who is correctly liberated in mind in this way. Vāṣpa, these are the six good abiding places gained by a monk who is correctly liberated in mind in this way.”
Vāṣpa said, “Yes, Gautama. A well-versed noble disciple who is correctly liberated in mind in this way gains six good abiding places. What are the six? Gautama, seeing forms with his eye, a well-versed noble disciple isn’t pleased or displeased. With correct mindfulness and correct understanding, he abandons pursuits and does nothing. Gautama, this is called the first good abiding place gained by a well-versed noble disciple who is correctly liberated in mind in this way. Thus … with his ear … nose … tongue … body … knowing notions with his mind, he isn’t pleased or displeased. With correct mindfulness and correct understanding, he abandons pursuits and does nothing. So it is, Gautama. This is called the sixth good abiding place gained by a well-versed noble disciple who is correctly liberated in mind in this way. So it is, Gautama. A well-versed noble disciple who is liberated in mind in this way gains these six good abiding places.”
16. Vāṣpa then said to the Bhagavān, “I’ve comprehended it, Gautama. I’ve understood, Sugata.[9](#^ma12note09) Gautama is like a man with clear vision who turns up what has been overturned, reveals what has been hidden, points the way to the lost, and provides a light in the dark so that those with eyes can see a form. The ascetic Gautama is like this. He has explained the Dharma and made its meaning plain to me using measureless methods, which accords with the profound awakening.[10](#^ma12note10) Bhagavān, I now devote myself to the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha of monks. Please, Bhagavān, accept me as a lay disciple. Starting today, I will devote myself to them for the rest of my life.
17. “Bhagavān, I’ve been like a man who breeds poor quality horses hoping to make a profit, but he exhausts himself and doesn’t obtain any profit. Bhagavān, I’ve been like that. Those foolish Jains don’t comprehend well, cannot understand, aren’t familiar with the excellent field, and don’t investigate things for themselves. I’ve revered, supported, and paid homage to them hoping to gain some profit from it for a long time, but it has been pointless, painful, and profitless. For the second time, Bhagavān, I now devote myself to the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha of monks. Please, Bhagavān, accept me as a lay disciple. Starting today, I will devote myself to them for the rest of my life.
18. “Bhagavān, I knew nothing before, believing and respecting those foolish Jains. That stops today. Why is that? Because they fooled me. For the third time, Bhagavān, I now devote myself to the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha of monks. Please, Bhagavān, accept me as a lay disciple. Starting today, I will devote to myself to them for the rest of my life.”
19. This is what the Buddha said. Vāṣpa and the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved. ^ma12note01-ref ^ma12note02-ref ^ma12note03-ref ^ma12note04-ref ^ma12note05-ref ^ma12note06-ref ^ma12note07-ref ^ma12note08-ref ^ma12note09-ref ^ma12note10-ref

### Notes

^ma12note01
1. For the source text, cf. [T26.1.434a12-5a23]. It’s parallel with [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN4/AN4.195]]. 

[↩︎](#^ma12note01-ref)

^ma12note02
2. _Śākya people._ C. 釋羇瘦 (EMC. ʃɪɛk-kɪĕ-ṣïəu = Pr. _śakeṣu_?), P. _sakkesu_. This is the translit. of a term that means the people of Śākya. The English equivalent would be Śākyans, just as “Americans” means “people of America.”  
    _Kapilavastu._ C. 迦維羅衛 (EMC. kă-yiui-la-ɦɪuɛi = G. _Ka’ilava[stu]_?), P. _kapilavatthu_. This was the capital of the Śākya lands.  
    _banyan tree park._ C. 尼拘類園 (EMC. nei-kɪu-lɪui + “park” = Pr. _nigro[dha]_? + _arama_), P. _nigrodhārāma_, S. _nyagrodhārāma_. The name of the banyan tree (presumably Pr. _nigrodha_) was translit. to C. This was a park near Kapilavastu. 

[↩︎](#^ma12note02-ref)

^ma12note03
3. _Jain_. C. 尼乾 (EMC. nei-kan = Pr. _nigan[tha]_), G. _nigaṭ́ha_, P. _nigaṇṭha_, S. _nirgrantha_. Nirgranthajñāniputra was the founder of the religion that is today known as Jainism. His disciples were known generally as Nirgranthas in Buddhist texts (which lit. means “mendicant” or “unhindered”), which was usu. translit. in C. I’ve used the modern name for clarity. 

[↩︎](#^ma12note03-ref)

^ma12note04
4. _Vāṣpa_. C. 惒破 (EMC. ɦua-p‘ua = Pr. _vapa_), G. _vapa_?, P. _vappa_, S. _vāṣpa_. This Jain disciple’s name lit. meant “planting” in Pali. I’ve adopted a S. equiv. The name was also sometimes written _bāṣpa_ in BHS sources according to Edgerton. 

[↩︎](#^ma12note04-ref)

^ma12note05
5. _Suppose a monk creates unskillful physical actions that were contaminants, afflictions, fevers, and griefs._. C. 若有比丘生不善身行，漏、煩、熱、憂慼, P. _ye kāyasamārambhapaccayā uppajjanti āsavā vighātapariḷāhā_. The P. phrasing is generalized (“whoever” instead of “a monk”), but _āsavā vighāta pariḷāhā_ appears directly parallel with 漏、煩、熱. There is a functional equivalence between 生 … 身行 and P. _kāyasamārambhapaccayā_, but _samārambha_ applied to body, speech, and mind is peculiar to [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN4/AN4.195]]. It seems to refer not simply to actions but to ascetic practices designed to extirpate past deeds. 不善身行 in this version seems more likely to translate a standard Buddhist expression like S. _akuśala kāya karmapatha_ (or _saṃskāra_). As the passage continues, this difference in approach is more apparent. 

[↩︎](#^ma12note05-ref)

^ma12note06
6. _final end_. C. 究竟. It’s not clear whether this refers to the end of unskillful deeds or rebirth. [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN4/AN4.195]] is more explicit that the passage is refer to the gradual extirpation of past deeds by forcing their fruition through self-punishment practices. This certainly would align with the beliefs of ascetic traditions like Jainism that believed self-mortification was necessary to escape future reincarnation. In this version, this is not spelled out to the reader, and perhaps it shouldn’t be assumed to be a subtext. The Buddha seems instead to be asserting that someone who reforms himself has done enough in this regard. 

[↩︎](#^ma12note06-ref)

^ma12note07
7. C. 生後身覺便知：『生後身覺』，生後命覺便知：『生後命覺』, P. _So kāyapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ vediyamāno ‘kāyapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ vediyāmī’ti pajānāti; jīvitapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ vediyamāno ‘jīvitapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ vediyāmī’ti pajānāti._ Presumably, 後身覺 and 後命覺 translate expressions very similar to P. _kāyapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ_ and _jīvitapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ_. I say similar because the lit. meaning of 後身 is “a later body,” meaning one in the next life. There’s no sense of ending that we’d expect from a trans. of P. _pariyantika_. It’s possible the translator was intending 後 to be read as 最後 “last.” That makes the most sense given that the passage appears to describe _nirvāṇa_ after the monk’s death, interpreted as 竟冷 “the final cooling.” I’ve therefore trans. 後 as “last” in this passage. “Later” would only make sense if _nirvāṇa_ were considered a kind of afterlife. 

[↩︎](#^ma12note07-ref)

^ma12note08
8. _With correct mindfulness and correct understanding, he abandons pursuits and does nothing._ C. 捨求無為，正念正智, P. _upekkhako viharati sato sampajāno_. The expression 捨求無為 only occurs in this _sūtra_ and corresponds to P. _upekkhaka_, which means being “disinterested or uninvolved” and is often rendered into English as “equanimity.” It’s possible the C. translation is an awkward attempt to translate the concept of disinterest (“abandoning pursuits and doing nothing”), but Sarvāstivāda texts habitually added synonyms to clarify passages.  
    The expression 正念正智 (correct mindfulness and correct understanding) occurs often in MĀ and corresponds to P. _sati sampajāna_. The G. equiv. of _sampajāna_ is attested as _saṃprajana_. There were clear cases of G. _saṃ_ (complete), _sama_ (equal), and _saṃma_ (correct) being conflated because _saṃma_ was often contracted in practice. However, I find it difficult to consider this reading mistaken when even Xuanzang translates the S. expression as 正念正知. I’ve therefore preserved the translator’s interpretation here, but I read 智 as meaning 知. 

[↩︎](#^ma12note08-ref)

^ma12note09
9. This paragraph and the next are parallel with a standard conclusion found in Pali _sutta_s in which an interlocutor praises the Buddha for having revealed the truth to them: “_Abhikkantaṁ, bho gotama, abhikkantaṁ, bho gotama. Seyyathāpi, bho gotama, nikkujjitaṁ vā ukkujjeyya, paṭicchannaṁ vā vivareyya, mūḷhassa vā maggaṁ ācikkheyya, andhakāre vā telapajjotaṁ dhāreyya: ‘cakkhumanto rūpāni dakkhantī’ti; evamevaṁ bhotā gotamena anekapariyāyena dhammo pakāsito. Esāhaṁ bhavantaṁ gotamaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi dhammañca bhikkhusaṅghañca. Upāsakaṁ maṁ bhavaṁ gotamo dhāretu ajjatagge pāṇupetaṁ saraṇaṁ gatan”ti._”  
    In [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN4/AN4.195]], this finale has been abbreviated away at the end after the simile of the horse trader, which occurs next in this version. However, this version departs from the Pali by depicting Vāṣpa as taking refuge three times rather than once. 

[↩︎](#^ma12note09-ref)

^ma12note10
10. _profound awakening_. C. 甚深道. I’ve adopted the alternate reading, which changes 隨其諸道 (“follows his paths”) to 隨甚深道 (“accords with the profound awakening”). 道 is ambiguous to me because of this alternate reading. The Taisho reading (諸道) would be a plural noun, so it would be natural to read it as “many paths,” whereas it seems more natural to read 道 as a translation of _bodhi_ when modified by 甚深 (“deep, profound”).
