110. Examining One’s Own Mind (2)
1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma110note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If a monk is unable to examine another’s mind well, he should examine his own mind well. He should train in that way. How does a monk examine his own mind well? If a monk were to perform this examination, he’d surely gain much from it: ‘Do I often act covetous, or do I often act without covetousness?’ ‘Do I often act hateful, or do I often act without hatefulness?’ ‘Do I often act ensnared in drowsiness, or do I often act without drowsiness?’ ‘Do I often act haughty, or do I often act without haughtiness?’ ‘Do I often act uncertainly or do I often act without uncertainty?’ ‘Do I often act violent, or do I often act without violence?’ ‘Do I often act with defiled thoughts, or do I often act without defiled thoughts?’ ‘Do I often act faithfully, or do I often act unfaithfully?’ ‘Do I often act energetically, or do I often act lazily?’ ‘Do I often act mindfully, or do I often act unmindfully?’ ‘Do I often act settled, or do I often act unsettled?’ ‘Do I often act with poor wisdom, or do I often act without poor wisdom?’[2](#^ma110note02)
3. “Suppose that a monk knows this when he examines himself: ‘I often act covetous … hateful … ensnared in drowsiness … haughty … uncertain … violent … with defiled thoughts … unfaithful … lazy … unmindful … unsettled … often act with poor wisdom.’ Wanting to cease these bad and unskillful qualities, that monk will quickly pursue the methods to do so. He trains with utmost diligence, right mindfulness, right knowledge, and perseverance, not letting himself regress. He’s like a man with his hair and clothes on fire. He immediately seeks to put out his hair and clothes. Such is this monk who wants to cease these bad and unskillful qualities. He quickly pursues the method to do so. He trains with utmost diligence, right mindfulness, right knowledge, and perseverance, not letting himself regress.
4. “Suppose a monk knows this when he examines himself: ‘I often act without covetousness … without hatefulness … without drowsiness … without haughtiness … without uncertainty … without violence … without defiled thoughts … with faithfulness … with energy … with mindfulness … with settledness … often act without poor wisdom.’ Having abided in these good qualities, that monk must seek to realize the knowledge that his contaminants are ended. Why is that? I say there’s clothing that none of which can be kept, and I say there’s clothing that all of which can be kept. What is the clothing that none of which can be kept? If keeping the clothing increases bad and unskillful qualities and diminishes skillful qualities, such clothing I say cannot be kept. What is the clothing I say can be kept? If keeping the clothing increases skillful qualities and diminishes bad and unskillful qualities, such clothing I say can be kept.[3](#^ma110note03)
5. “_Like clothing, meals, seats, and towns are likewise_. I say there are people whom none can be associated with, and I also say there are people whom all can be associated with. Who are the people whom I say cannot be associated with? If associating with a person increases bad and unskillful qualities and diminishes skillful qualities, such people I say cannot be associated with. Who are the people whom I say can be associated with? If associating with a person increases skillful qualities and diminishes bad and unskillful qualities, such people I say can be associated with.
6. “He truly knows which qualities should be cultivated, and he truly knows which qualities shouldn’t be cultivated. Once he truly knows that, he doesn’t cultivate the qualities that shouldn’t be cultivated, and he cultivates the qualities that should be cultivated. Once he doesn’t cultivate the qualities that he shouldn’t and cultivates the qualities that he should, he then increases skillful qualities and diminishes bad and unskillful qualities. This is called a monk who examines his own mind well and skillfully chooses and discards qualities once he knows his mind well.”
7. This is what the Buddha said. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

^ma110note01
1. For the source text, cf. [T26.1.598c21-9b7]. [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.51]] is a direct parallel to this _sūtra_. It’s very similar to [MĀ 109](MA_109.html) (and [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.53]]). It also bears a resemblance to [MĀ 95](MA_095.html) and [96](MA_096.html), sharing a couple different standard formulas with them.

^ma110note02
2. This list of bad and unskillful qualities is the same as the one found in [MĀ 95](MA_095.html) and [96](MA_096.html). I annotated my translation of each term in [the notes to MĀ 95](MA_095.html#notes).

3. See the notes to [MĀ 109](MA_109.html#notes) for my comments on this passage about things that can and cannot be kept.
