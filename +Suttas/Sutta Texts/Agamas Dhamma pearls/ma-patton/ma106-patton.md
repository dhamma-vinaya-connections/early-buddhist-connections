### Translating Classical Buddhism to Modern English
### Translator: Charles Patton

## Chapter 9: Causation

106. Conceptions
1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma106note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Suppose an ascetic or priest conceives about earth that there is earth: ‘Earth is the soul, earth belongs to the soul, or the soul belongs to earth.’ Having supposed that earth is the soul, they do not know earth. So it is with water … fire … air … spirits … gods … Prajāpati … Brahmā … Avṛha … Atapa … They conceive about purity that there is purity: ‘Purity is the soul, purity belongs to the soul, or the soul belongs to purity.’ Having supposed that purity is the soul, they do not know purity … the abode of measureless space … abode of measureless awareness … abode of nothingness … abode neither with nor without conception … oneness … distinction … diversity … what’s seen … heard … discerned … known … found … investigated … mental thought … mental intention … from this world to that world … from that world to this world … They conceive about everything that there is everything. ‘Everything is the soul, everything belongs to the soul, or the soul belongs to everything.’ Having supposed that everything is the soul, they don’t know everything.[2](#^ma106note02)
3. “Suppose an ascetic or priest knows about earth that it’s earth: ‘Earth isn’t a soul, earth doesn’t belong to a soul, and the soul doesn’t belong to earth.’ Not supposing that earth is a soul, they know earth. So it is with water … fire … air … spirits … gods … Prajāpati … Brahmā … Avṛha … Atapa … They know about purity that it’s purity: ‘Purity isn’t a soul, purity doesn’t belong to a soul, and the soul doesn’t belong to purity.’ Not supposing that purity is a soul, they know purity… the abode of measureless space … abode of measureless awareness … abode of nothingness … abode neither with nor without conception … oneness … distinction … diversity … what’s seen … heard … discerned … known … found … investigated … mental thought … mental intention … from this world to that world … from that world to this world … They know about everything that it’s everything: ‘Everything isn’t a soul, everything doesn’t belong to a soul, and the soul doesn’t belong to everything.’ Not supposing that everything is a soul, they know everything.
4. “I know about earth that it’s earth: ‘Earth isn’t a soul, earth doesn’t belong to a soul, and the soul doesn’t belong to earth.’ Not supposing that earth is a soul, I know earth. So it is with water … fire … air … spirits … gods … Prajāpati … Brahmā … Avṛha … Atapa … I know about purity that it’s purity: ‘Purity isn’t a soul, purity doesn’t belong to a soul, and the soul doesn’t belong to purity.’ Not supposing that purity is a soul, I know purity … the abode of measureless space … abode of measureless awareness … abode of nothingness … abode neither with nor without conception … oneness … distinction … diversity … what’s seen … heard … discerned … known … found … investigated … mental thought … mental intention … from this world to that world … from that world to this world … I know about everything that it’s everything: ‘Everything isn’t a soul, everything doesn’t belong to a soul, and the soul doesn’t belong to everything.’ Not supposing that everything is a soul, I know everything.”
5. This is what the Buddha said. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved. ^ma106note01-ref ^ma106note02-ref

### Notes

^ma106note01
1. For the source text, cf. [T26.1.596b9-c17]. Its parallels include [MN 1], [[EĀ44.6]], and T56. It has a stronger resemblance to T56, while MN 1 and [[EĀ44.6]] are quite similar to each other.  
    The main difference between this version and MN 1 is that the Theravāda version goes through the analysis of the list of concepts eight times as opposed to three times in MĀ 106. Both begin with the case of the deluded person who believes the various concepts are a form of soul (S. _atman_). MĀ 106 then moves to the case of someone who understands these concepts properly as not being a soul. Finally, the Buddha says the same of himself. MN 1 adds the case of a trainee monk between a common person and an _arhat_ and finishes with the Buddha’s own knowledge about these things. MN 1 repeats some of these cases to make different statements about attainments, such as the elimination of the three unskillful roots.  
    The closest parallel to MN 1, [[EĀ44.6]], is a much more succinct version but covers the same four cases: the ordinary person, the unliberated disciple, the _arhat_, and the Tathāgata.

2. _earth … everything._ C. 地⋯水⋯火⋯風⋯神⋯天⋯生主⋯梵天⋯無煩⋯無熱⋯淨⋯無量空處⋯無量識處⋯無所有處⋯非有想非無想處⋯一⋯別⋯若干⋯見⋯聞⋯識⋯知⋯得⋯觀⋯意所念⋯意所思⋯從此世至彼世⋯從彼世至此世⋯一切, P. _pathaviṁ … āpaṁ … tejaṁ … vāyaṁ … bhūte … deve … pajāpatiṁ … brahmaṁ … ābhassare … subhakiṇhe … vehapphale … abhibhuṁ … ākāsānañcāyatanaṁ … viññāṇañcāyatanaṁ … ākiñcaññāyatanaṁ … nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṁ … diṭṭhaṁ … sutaṁ … mutaṁ … viññātaṁ … ekattaṁ … nānattaṁ … sabbaṁ … nibbānaṁ_.  
    This list of concepts has 28 items, while the parallel list in MN 1 has 24. T56 has a list very similar to this one that contains 24 or 25 items depending on how it’s parsed. [[EĀ44.6]] has a list much closer to that of MN 1 that includes 23 items. The differences are mainly in which form realm heavens are included and also the end of the list, which sometimes ends with “everything” and sometimes with “_nirvāṇa_.” There’s not enough space here to compare four parallel lists of this size, but I do want to make a few remarks about my translation of the present version.  
    _earth … water … fire … air_. C. 地⋯水⋯火⋯風, P. _pathaviṁ … āpaṁ … tejaṁ … vāyaṁ_. These are the four basic elements, which begin all four of the parallel lists. They collectively represent the physical Earth in Buddhism and Brahmanism.  
    _spirits … gods … Prajāpati … Brahmā … Avṛha … Atapa … purity_. C. 神⋯天⋯生主⋯梵天⋯無煩⋯無熱⋯淨, P. _bhūte … deve … pajāpatiṁ … brahmaṁ … ābhassare … subhakiṇhe … vehapphale … abhibhuṁ_. This section of the list covers the heavenly beings of the desire and form realm. I’ve translated 神 as “spirits” based on the reading in the closely related list in T56, which reads 天神 (“gods and spirits”). Three of the gods listed are translated to C.: 生主 (“Lord of Living Things”) = Prajāpati, 無煩 (“No Vexation”) = Avṛha, and 無熱 (“No Burning”) = Atapa. I’m not sure what 淨 (“pure, clean”) translates here. Presumably, it represents a form realm heaven above Atapa, so perhaps the original is Śubha or Śuddha. I’ve translated it literally for the time being.  
    _the abode of measureless space … abode of measureless awareness … abode of nothingness … abode neither with nor without conception_. C. 無量空處⋯無量識處⋯無所有處⋯非有想非無想處, P. _ākāsānañcāyatanaṁ … viññāṇañcāyatanaṁ … ākiñcaññāyatanaṁ … nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṁ._ These are the four formless realm heavens that became standard among Buddhists.  
    _oneness … distinction … diversity._ C. 一⋯別⋯若干, P. _ekattaṁ … nānattaṁ_. Here, the list moves from cosmological categories to categories of concepts, knowledge, and experience. MN 1 places these items at the end just before “the all” and “_nirvāṇa_.” This version is the only one that includes 別, which presumably is intended to be the antonym of 一 (“oneness”). I’ve rendered it as “distinction.”  
    _what’s seen … heard … discerned … known … found … investigated … mental thought … mental intention … from this world to that world … from that world to this world._ C. 見⋯聞⋯識⋯知⋯得⋯觀⋯意所念⋯意所思⋯從此世至彼世⋯從彼世至此世, P. _diṭṭhaṁ … sutaṁ … mutaṁ … viññātaṁ_. This portion of the list is the most expanded. It appears to lift ten items from the six abodes of views found in MĀ 200, which read: 見，聞，識，知，所得，所觀，意所思、念，從此世至彼世，從彼世至此世 (cf. MN 22: _diṭṭhaṁ sutaṁ mutaṁ viññātaṁ pattaṁ pariyesitaṁ, anuvicaritaṁ manasā_). This makes it clear that 得 (“attained, found,” P. _pattaṁ_) and 觀 (“observed, investigated,” P. _pariyesitaṁ_) are separate items in the list. 意所思念 in MĀ 200 is separated into two items here, which mean something like “mental thought” and “mental intention,” though the practical meaning that was intended isn’t clear to me.  
    _everything_. C. 一切, P. _sabbaṁ_. MN 1 and [[EĀ44.6]] end the list with _nirvāṇa,_ and MN 1 includes _sabbaṁ_ as the next to the last item. T56 doesn’t include either of these final items. In other early _sūtra_s, “everything” refers to the entire world of experience.
