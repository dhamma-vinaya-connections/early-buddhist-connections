## Chapter 12: The Brahmins

159. Agrahana
1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma159note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.
2. It was then that the priest Agrahana[2](#^ma159note02) went for a walkabout in the afternoon. He paid the Buddha a visit, exchanging greetings with him and withdrawing to sit at one side. He said, “Gautama, I have a question I would like to ask if you would permit me.”
The Bhagavān told him, “You may ask your question.”
3. The priest asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the priestly scriptures?”
The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the priestly scriptures is humanity.”
4. The priest also asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of humanity?”
The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of humanity is grain.”
5. The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of grain?”
The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of grain is the earth.”
6. The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the earth?”
The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the earth is water.”
7. The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of water?”
The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of water is air.”
8. The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of air?”
The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of air is space.”
9. The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of space?”
The Bhagavān replied, “Space has no basis. It’s only because of the sun and moon that there is space.”
10. The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the sun and moon?”[3](#^ma159note03)
The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the sun and moon is the Heaven of the Four Kings.”
11. The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the Heaven of the Four Kings?”
The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the Heaven of the Four Kings is the Trayastriṃśa Heaven.”
12. The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the Trayastriṃśa Heaven?”
The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the Trayastriṃśa Heaven is the Yama Heaven.”
13. The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the Yama Heaven?”
The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the Yama Heaven is the Tuṣita Heaven.”
14. The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the Tuṣita Heaven?”
The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the Tuṣita Heaven is the Nirmāṇarati Heaven.”
15. The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the Nirmāṇarati Heaven?”
The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the Nirmāṇarati Heaven is the Paranirmāṇarati Heaven.”[4](#^ma159note04)
16. The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the Paranirmāṇarati Heaven?”
The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the Paranirmāṇarati Heaven is the Brahma world.”
17. The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the Brahma world?”
The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the Brahma world is Mahābrahmā.”
18. The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of Mahābrahmā?”
The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of Mahābrahmā is patience and gentleness.”
19. The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of patience and gentleness?”
The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of patience and gentleness is _nirvāṇa_.”[5](#^ma159note05)
20. The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of _nirvāṇa_?”
The Bhagavān replied, “Priest, you want the basis of something that’s endless. Now, you could put limitless questions to me about it, but _nirvāṇa_ has no basis.[6](#^ma159note06) It’s only _nirvāṇa_ that completely extinguishes [a person].[7](#^ma159note07) _Nirvāṇa_ is the highest. Priest, the religious life is practiced under me for this goal.”
21. The priest again asked, “I know, Bhagavān! I understand, Sugata! Bhagavān, I now devote myself to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha of monks. Please, Bhagavān, accept me as a layman. Starting today, I will devote myself to them for the rest of my life.”
22. This is what the Buddha said. When the priest Agrahana heard what the Buddha taught, he rejoiced and approved. ^ma159note01-ref ^ma159note02-ref ^ma159note03-ref ^ma159note04-ref ^ma159note05-ref ^ma159note06-ref ^ma159note07-ref

### Notes

^ma159note01
1. For the source text, cf. [T26.1.681c25-2b9]. It has no known parallel among Buddhist sources, nor have I found any occurrence of the priest who appears as the Buddha’s interlocutor. However, there is a very similar passage in the Br̥hadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (@ [3.6.1]) in which Gargi questions Yajnavalkya in a very similar way as Agrahana questions the Buddha here in this _sūtra_. The similarity is difficult to dismiss, but it’s also difficult to determine which might be the original and which was the tradition influenced by it. It could certainly be viewed as a Buddhist response that places _nirvāṇa_ in the position of Yajnavalkya’s unknowable Brahma. See the notes below for more discussion of this parallel.

^ma159note02
2. _Agrahana_. C. 阿伽羅訶那 (EMC. a-gɪă-la-ha-na = Pr. _agrahana_ or _agarahana_). The only evidence of the meaning or original Indic word for this transliterated name is the EMC. reconstruction and a gloss in the 翻梵語 (@ [T2130.54.1014b11]). The gloss says that the translit. should be amended to 阿他訶那 and that it meant 无熱 (“no burning”). This would indicate S. _adāhana_ (“not reduced to ashes”). Unfortunately, this seems a case of the glossary compiler being ignorant of the Pr. readings in the original Āgama text and suggesting speculative corrections based on later S.  
    Setting this suggestion aside, it also seems plausible that the name could have been S. _Āgrahāyaṇa_ (the name of a month), _Agṛhana_ (“without a house”), or _Agarhana_ (“without reproach”), all of which might resolve to G. _agrahana_ or _agarahana_. I have adopted Agrahana for this translation, but the exact name in the original remains unclear to me without an Indic parallel or a more plausible gloss of its meaning.

^ma159note03
3. In the Upaniṣad parallel, the progression begins: “all this” is pervaded by water, which is pervaded by air, which is pervaded by the sky, which is pervaded by the world of _gandharva_s, which is pervaded by the world of the sun, which is pervaded by the world of the moon. 

[↩︎](#^ma159note03-ref)

^ma159note04
4. _Paranirmāṇarati_. C. 他化樂. The usual name for this heaven was S. _paranirmita-vaśavartin_. Here, the C. trans. clearly is _para_ (他) _nirmāṇa_ (化) _rati_ (樂), which is the same as the previous heaven with “other” (_para_, 他) added as a prefix. The meaning would be “Heaven of Pleasures Created by Others.” 

[↩︎](#^ma159note04-ref)

^ma159note05
5. In the Upaniṣad parallel, the progression continues: The world of the moon is pervaded by the world of the stars, which is pervaded by the world of the gods, which is pervaded by the world of Indra, which is pervaded by the world of Prajāpati, which is pervaded by the world of Brahma.  
    Thus, _nirvāṇa_ in this _sūtra_ stands as the basis beyond Brahma, who is the unknowable deity to Yajnavalkya. _Nirvāṇa_ itself was considered to be an unknowable state by Buddhists, so it also would serve as the parallel to Yajnavalkya’s Brahma in that way. 

[↩︎](#^ma159note05-ref)

^ma159note06
6. This conclusion is similar to Yajnavalkya’s chiding of Gargi: “Do not, O Gargi, question too much, lest your head should fall off. You are questioning too much about a deity about whom we should not ask too much. Do not ask too much, O Gargi.” 

[↩︎](#^ma159note06-ref)

^ma159note07
7. _completely extinguishes [a person]._ C. 滅訖. While this text has no parallels, the verb 滅訖 corresponds to P. _parinibbāyati_ and _nibbāyati_ in MĀ’s parallels to [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN4/AN4.23]] and MN 140. The trouble is that in English it needs an object that’s being extinguished, so I have inserted “a person.” This is simply for grammatical reasons, not an attempt to draw any profound ontological conclusions about the passage.
