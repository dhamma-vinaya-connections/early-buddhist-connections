## Chapter 14: Mind

### 176. Meditators

1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma176note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove. ^ma176note01-ref

2. It was then that the Bhagavān told the monks, “The world in truth has four kinds of meditator. What are the four? Some meditators are waxing but say that they are waning. Some meditators are waning but say that they are waxing. Some meditators are waning, and they truly know that they are waning. Some meditators are waxing, and they truly know that they are waxing.

#### The Practitioner Who Is Waxing but Says They Are Waning

3. “How does a meditator wax but say they are waning? That meditator is is secluded from desires and secluded from bad and unskillful things. While they notice and examine things, this seclusion produces joy and happiness in them, and they accomplish and dwell in the first meditation.

4. “Cultivating right thought in their mind, they then move from the first meditation toward the second meditation, which is a greater tranquility. That meditator then thinks, ‘My mind has parted with the primary signs [of this _samādhi_]. It will move toward another abode, lose the first meditation, and its _samādhi_ will cease.’ That meditator doesn’t truly know, ‘My mind is cultivating right thought and delighting in tranquility. It’ll move from the first meditation toward the second meditation, which is a greater tranquility.’ Not truly knowing that, their mind retreats in this way and loses its _samādhi_. Thus, the meditator is waxing but says that they are waning.

5. “Furthermore, once noticing and examining things has subsided, the meditator has inner calm and a unified mind. Without noticing or examining things, this _samādhi_ produces joy and happiness, and they accomplish and dwell in the second meditation.

6. “Cultivating right thought in their mind, they then move from the second meditation toward the third meditation, which is a greater tranquility. That meditator then thinks, ‘My mind has parted with the primary signs [of this _samādhi_]. It will move to another abode, lose the second meditation, and its _samādhi_ will cease.’ That meditator doesn’t truly know, ‘My mind is cultivating right thought and delighting in tranquility. It’ll move from the second meditation toward the third meditation, which is a greater tranquility.’ Not truly knowing that, their mind retreats in this way and loses its _samādhi_. Thus, the meditator is waxing but says that they are waning.

7. “Furthermore, parting with desire for that joy, the meditator lives in equanimity and pursues nothing. With right mindfulness and right knowledge, they personally experience happiness, about which the noble ones teach them the noble’s happy abiding place of detachment and mindfulness. They accomplish and dwell in the third meditation.

8. “Cultivating right thought in their mind, they then move from the third meditation toward the fourth meditation, which is a greater tranquility. That meditator then thinks, ‘My mind has parted with the primary signs [of this _samādhi_]. It will move to another abode, lose the third meditation, and its _samādhi_ will cease.’ That meditator doesn’t truly know, ‘My mind is cultivating right thought and delighting in tranquility. It’ll move from the third meditation toward the fourth meditation, which is a greater tranquility.’ Not truly knowing that, their mind retreats in this way and loses its _samādhi_. Thus, the meditator is waxing but says that they are waning.

9. “Furthermore, the meditator’s pleasure ceases and their pain ceases. Their past joy and sorrow having ceased, they feel neither pain nor pleasure. With the purification of their equanimity and mindfulness, they accomplish and dwell in the fourth meditation.

10. “Cultivating right thought in their mind, they then move from the fourth meditation toward the abode of measureless space, which is a greater tranquility. That meditator then thinks, ‘My mind has parted with the primary signs [of this _samādhi_]. It will move to another abode, lose the fourth meditation, and its _samādhi_ will cease.’ That meditator doesn’t truly know, ‘My mind is cultivating right thought and delighting in tranquility. It’ll move from the fourth meditation toward the abode of measureless space, which is a greater tranquility.’ Not truly knowing that, their mind retreats in this way and loses its _samādhi_. Thus, the meditator is waxing but says that they are waning.

11. “Furthermore, the meditator crosses over all notions of form, ceases the notion of resistance, and doesn’t attend to diverse notions to [reach] measureless space, and they accomplish and dwell in the abode of measureless space.

12. “Cultivating right thought in their mind, they then move from the abode of measureless space toward the abode of measureless consciousness, which is a greater tranquility. That meditator then thinks, ‘My mind has parted with the primary signs [of this _samādhi_]. It will move to another abode, lose the abode of measureless space, and its _samādhi_ will cease.’ That meditator doesn’t truly know, ‘My mind is cultivating right thought and delighting in tranquility. It’ll move from the abode of measureless space to the abode of measureless consciousness, which is a greater tranquility.’ Not truly knowing that, their mind retreats in this way and loses its _samādhi_. Thus, the meditator is waxing but says that they are waning.

13. “Furthermore, the meditator crosses over all the abode of measureless space to measureless consciousness, and they accomplish and dwell in the abode of measureless consciousness.

14. “Cultivating right thought in their mind, they then move from the abode of measureless consciousness toward the abode of nothingness, which is a greater tranquility. That meditator then thinks, ‘My mind has parted with the primary signs [of this _samādhi_]. It will move to another abode, lose the abode of measureless consciousness, and its _samādhi_ will cease.’ That meditator doesn’t truly know, ‘My mind is cultivating right thought and delighting in tranquility. It’ll move from the abode of measureless consciousness to the abode of nothingness, which is a greater tranquility.’ Not truly knowing that, their mind retreats in this way and loses its _samādhi_. Thus, the meditator is waxing but says that they are waning.

15. “Furthermore, the meditator crosses over all the abode of measureless consciousness to nothingness, and they accomplish and dwell in the abode of nothingness.

16. “Cultivating right thought in their mind, they then move from the abode of nothingness toward the abode that’s neither with nor without conception, which is a greater tranquility. That meditator then thinks, ‘My mind has parted with the primary signs [of this _samādhi_]. It will move to another abode, lose the abode of nothingness, and its _samādhi_ will cease.’ That meditator doesn’t truly know, ‘My mind is cultivating right thought and delighting in tranquility.
