### 48. Precepts (2)

1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma48note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove. ^ma48note01-ref

2. It was then that Venerable Śāriputra addressed the monks, “Good men, if a monk violates the precepts, that’s detrimental to having no regrets … gladness … joy … calmness … happiness … samādhi … true seeing and true knowing … disenchantment … lack of desire … liberation. If he doesn’t have liberation, that’s detrimental to nirvāṇa.

3. “Good men, it’s like a tree that has damaged. It’s branches … trunk … core … joints … limbs … leaves … flowers … fruit then don’t form completely.

4. “Good men, you should know that a monk is likewise. If he violates the precepts, that’s detrimental to having no regrets … gladness … joy … calmness … happiness … samādhi … true seeing and true knowing … disenchantment … lack of desire … liberation. If he doesn’t have liberation, that’s detrimental to nirvāṇa.

5. “Good men, if a monk observes the precepts, he readily cultivates having no regrets … gladness … joy … calmness … happiness … samādhi … true seeing and true knowing … disenchantment … lack of desire … liberation. If he has liberation, he readily cultivates nirvāṇa.

6. “Good men, it’s like a tree that doesn’t have damaged roots. It’s branches … trunk … core … joints … limbs … leaves … flowers … fruit then will form completely.

7. “Good men, you should know that a monk is likewise. If a monk observes the precepts, he readily cultivates having no regrets … gladness … joy … calmness … happiness … samādhi … true seeing and true knowing … disenchantment … lack of desire … liberation. If he has liberation, he readily cultivates nirvāṇa.”

8. Venerable Śāriputra spoke thus. Those monks who heard what Venerable Śāriputra taught rejoiced and approved.
