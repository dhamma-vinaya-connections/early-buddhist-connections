## Chapter 4: Unprecedented Things

41. The Prominent Man Hastaka (2)
1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma41note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to Āṭavikā and stayed at Agrāṭavika Grove.[2](#^ma41note02)
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “The prominent man Hastaka[3](#^ma41note03) possesses eight unprecedented qualities. What are the eight? The prominent man Hastaka has few desires, and he is faithful, modest, conscientious, diligent, mindful, settled, and wise.
3. “Why do I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka has few desires’? Hastaka himself has few desires, but he doesn’t want others to know, ‘I have few desires.’ … faithful … modest … conscientious … diligent … mindful … settled … wise … Hastaka himself has wisdom, but he doesn’t want others to know, ‘I have wisdom.’ This is why I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka has few desires.’
4. “Why do I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is faithful’? Hastaka has obtained a firmness of faith. He is deeply attached to the Tathāgata, has established the faculty of faith, and will never follow ascetics and priests of other religions, gods like Māra and Brahmā, or any other worldly person. This is why I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is faithful.’
5. “Why do I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is modest’? Hastaka always conducts himself with modesty. He is ashamed and feels shame about bad and unskillful things, defilements, and afflictions that bring bad results and create the roots of birth and death. This is why I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is modest.’
6. “Why do I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is conscientious’? He is embarrassed and feels embarrassment by bad and unskillful things, defilements, and afflictions that bring bad results and create the roots of birth and death. This is why I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is conscientious.’
7. “Why do I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is diligent’? Hastaka always conducts himself with diligence. He rids himself of what’s bad and unskillful and cultivates skillful things. He constantly motivates himself, focuses firmly on the roots of goodness, and doesn’t abandon the means to do so. This is why I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is diligent.’
8. “Why do I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is mindful’? Hastaka observes internal body as body, observes internal feelings … mind … principles as principles. This is why I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is mindful.’
9. “Why do I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is settled’? Hastaka is secluded from desires and secluded from bad and unskillful things … he accomplishes and dwells in the fourth meditation. This is why I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is settled.’
10. “Why do I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is wise’? Hastaka cultivates wisdom. He observes the principle of arising and decline and acquires knowledge that accords with it. He masters the noble wisdom, discerns it, and comprehends it. He uses it to correctly end suffering. This is why I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is wise.’ This is why I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka has eight unprecedented qualities.’”
11. This is what the Buddha said. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved. ^ma41note01-ref ^ma41note02-ref ^ma41note03-ref

### Notes

^ma41note01
1. For the source text, cf. [T26.1.484b28-5a1]. It’s parallel with [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN8/AN8.23]]. These two texts are quite similar; however, a doctrinal difference becomes apparent when we observe the two lists of qualities attributed to Hastaka.  
    In [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN8/AN8.23]], the seven qualities of Hatthaka are that he was faithful (P. _saddho_), ethical (_sīlavā_), conscientious (_hirīmā_), prudent (_ottappī_), learned (_bahussuto_), generous (_cāgavā_), and wise (_paññavā_). When the Buddha learns of Hatthaka’s modesty about being praised in this way, he adds an eight quality of having few desires.  
    In the present _sūtra_, he is said to possess eight qualities: He had few desires (少欲) and was faithful (有信), modest (有慚), conscientious (有愧), diligent (有精進), mindful (有念), settled (有定), and wise (有慧).  
    These two lists have five items in common, which are few desires (P. _appicchatāyā_), faith (P. _saddha_, 信), conscience/modesty (_hirī_, 慚), prudence/conscience (_ottappa_, 愧), and wisdom (_pañña_, 慧). [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN8/AN8.23]] includes three other items that one might expect for a almsgiving layperson: ethics, generosity, and learnedness. MĀ 41 has instead three items that we might expect from a full pracitioner: diligence, mindfulness, and settledness (i.e., _samādhi_).  
    This and similar _sūtra_s praising prominent laymen (e.g., MĀ 39) explicitly depict them as accomplishing the four meditations, something that seems not to happen in Pali sources. There must have been different expectations of laypeople among Sarvāstivādins compared to Theravādins. We should also consider the possible influence of the “retired layman _bodhisattva_” concept that developed. E.g., the Buddha teaches the layman Ugra about this practice in Mahāratnakūṭa No. 19 (T310.11.472b7-80b28).

2. 阿邏鞞伽邏在惒林 (EMC. •a-la-bei-k‘ie-la-dzəi-ɦua-lɪəm = Pr. _aḷavi_ + _[a]gaḷa_ + “to be at” + _va_ + “grove”?), P. _āḷaviyaṁ viharati aggāḷave cetiye_. It would appear that the C. found here and in MĀ 40 may have suffered some confusion, with 在 (“was at”) being misplaced or inserted. If we remove 在, the expression 阿邏鞞伽邏惒 could easily be read as a translit. of _aḷavi_ (阿邏鞞) and _[a]gaḷava_ (伽邏惒), which is plausible as a Prakrit equivalent of the two Pali place names. Perhaps the passage should instead read 佛遊阿邏鞞，在(阿)伽邏惒林. Assuming this is the case, I’ve adopted the S. equivalents of these two Pali place names.

3. _the prominent man Hastaka_. C. 手長者, G. _*hasta[ka]_, P. _hatthaka_, S. _hastaka_. The C. translates this layman’s name lit. as “hand,” which is the meaning of the Indic name. While he has no title in [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN8/AN8.23]], he here is called a “prominent man” (C. 長者, P. _seṭṭhi_, S. _śreṣṭhin_) rather than a “householder” (C. 居士, S. _gṛhapati_, P. _gahapati_). “Prominent” here typically referred to being a well-to-do landowner or successful merchant. Such people, usu. men, were prominent members of a community but existed outside the political or religious heirarchy.
