## Chapter 3: Related to Śāriputra

### 31. Discernment of the Noble Truths

1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma31note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove. ^ma31note01-ref

2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “This is the correct practice of teaching Dharma, which is to gather in detail, contemplate in detail, discern, disclose, reveal, define, make known, and direct others to the four noble truths.

3. “Tathāgatas, Arhats, and Fully Awakened Ones of the past also had this correct practice of teaching Dharma, which was to gather in detail, contemplate in detail, discern, disclose, reveal, define, make known, and direct others to the four noble truths. Tathāgatas, Arhats, and Fully Awakened Ones of the future also will have this correct practice of teaching Dharma, which will be to gather in detail, contemplate in detail, discern, disclose, reveal, define, make known, and direct others to the four noble truths. I am the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Fully Awakened One of the present who also has this correct practice of teaching Dharma, which is to gather in detail, contemplate in detail, discern, disclose, reveal, define, make known, and direct others to the four noble truths.

4. “The monk Śāriputra’s wisdom is clever, quick, fast, sharp, detailed, profound, essential, insightful, and eloquent. The monk Śāriputra has accomplished real wisdom. Why is that? When I taught these four noble truths in brief, the monk Śāriputra then could teach them in detail for others, contemplate them in detail, discern, disclose, reveal, define, make known, and direct others to them. When he teaches and shows them in detail, discerns, discloses, reveals, defines, makes known, and directs others to these four noble truths, the monk Śāriputra causes measureless people to attain their contemplation. The monk Śāriputra can make right view be his guide.

5. “The monk Maudgalyāyana can lead others to stand at the supreme limit of reality, which is the ultimate end of the contaminants. The monk Śāriputra gives birth to religious practitioners like a birthing mother, and the monk Maudgalyāyana nurtures religious practitioners like a nursing mother. Religious practitioners therefore should serve, support, respect, and venerate the monks Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana. Why is that? The monks Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana seek what’s purposeful and beneficial for religious practitioners. They seek their welfare and happiness.”

6. After speaking thus, the Bhagavān rose from his seat and retired to sit in his dwelling.

7. Thereupon, Venerable Śāriputra addressed the monks, “Good men, the Bhagavān appeared in the world for us. That is, it was to teach and show in detail these four noble truths for others and to discern, disclose, reveal, define, make known, and direct others to them. What are the four? They are the noble truth of suffering and the noble truths of suffering’s formation, suffering’s cessation, and the path to suffering’s cessation.

61. “Good men, what is right view? When the noble disciple is mindful that suffering is suffering … formation is formation … cessation is cessation … when he’s mindful that the path is the path, he might examine what he has done in the past, train in the mindfulness of deeds, see the danger of deeds, or see the stillness of nirvāṇa.

Discriminating qualities, examining, fully examining, and observing them with insight and comprehension is called right view.

62. “Good men, what is right intention?

When he’s mindful without attachment and observes the liberation of good thoughts, he doesn’t seek things without reason, doesn’t have many desires without tire, and doesn’t pursue various wrong livelihoods like the arts or reciting incantations. Seeking clothing by Dharma and not by what’s not Dharma and seeking food and seating by Dharma and not by what’s not Dharma is called right livelihood.

66. “Good men, what is right method? When the noble disciple is mindful that suffering is suffering … formation is formation … cessation is cessation … when he’s mindful that the path is the path, he might examine what he has done in the past, train in the mindfulness of deeds, see the danger of deeds, or see the stillness of nirvāṇa. When he’s mindful without attachment and observes the liberation of good thoughts, then if he possesses the method of effort, diligently pursues a single heading, and has the strength to head for it, he’ll continue without abandoning it. Not relenting or retreating and correctly controlling the mind is called right method.

67. “Good men, what is right mindfulness? When the noble disciple is mindful that suffering is suffering … formation is formation … cessation is cessation … when he’s mindful that the path is the path, he might examine what he has done in the past, train in the mindfulness of deeds, see the danger of deeds, or see the stillness of nirvāṇa. When he’s mindful without attachment and observes the liberation of good thoughts, then his mind follows mindfulness and doesn’t give attention to what’s contrary to it. Being fully mindful, recollecting, further recollecting, and not forgetting what should be remembered is called right mindfulness.

68. “Good men, what is right _samādhi_? When the noble disciple is mindful that suffering is suffering … formation is formation … cessation is cessation … when he’s mindful that the path is the path, he might examine what he has done in the past, train in the mindfulness of deeds, see the danger of deeds, or see the stillness of nirvāṇa. When he’s mindful without attachment and observes the liberation of good thoughts, then if he abides his mind, abides in meditation, abides in following, he isn’t confused or distracted. To be collected, calm, and rightly concentrated is called right _samādhi_.

69. “Good men, this noble truth of the path to suffering’s cessation in the past and these noble truths of the path to suffering’s cessation in the future and present are true and not false. They don’t part from this, and they are not mistaken. They are true and completely genuine. Union with such truth is possessed, known, seen, comprehended, obtained, and completely awakened to by the noble ones. Therefore, it’s called the noble truth of the path to suffering’s cessation.”

70. Thereupon, he spoke this verse:

- “The Buddha’s insight about things  
    Sees measureless good virtues.  
    He presents and discerns well the noble truths  
    Of suffering, formation, cessation, and the path.”

71. This is what Venerable Śāriputra said. Those monks who heard what Venerable Śāriputra said rejoiced and approved.
