### 81. Mindfulness of Body

1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma81note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Aṅga with a group of great monks. They went to Āpaṇa and stayed at Kaineya’s residence. ^ma81note01-ref

#### Introduction

2. After the night passed and the sun rose, the Bhagavān put on his robe and took his bowl into Āpaṇa to solicit alms. When his meal was finished, he put away his robe and bowl, washed his hands and feet, put his sitting mat over his shoulder, and went into a grove in the afternoon. Going into that grove, he spread out his sitting mat under a tree and sat cross-legged there.

3. At the time, a great assembly of monks had gathered in the meeting hall after the midday meal, and they were conversing about this topic: “Good men, the Bhagavān is rare and extraordinary. He cultivates mindfulness of body and discerns and disseminates it. His is the highest knowledge, highest observation, highest cultivation, and highest discipline. He has well perfected good conduct and resides in a unified mind. The Buddha teaches that mindfulness of body has great rewards. One attains the vision and eyes to see the supreme truth.”

4. Just then, the Bhagavān was sitting in repose and used the divine ear that transcends that of humans. He heard the monks gathered in the meeting hall after the midday meal conversing about this topic: “Good men, the Bhagavān is rare and extraordinary. He cultivates mindfulness of body and discerns and disseminates it. His is the highest knowledge, highest observation, highest cultivation, and highest discipline. He has well perfected good conduct and resides in a unified mind. The Buddha teaches that mindfulness of body has great rewards. One attains the vision and eyes to see the supreme truth.” After hearing this, the Bhagavān then got up from his repose in the afternoon, went to the meeting hall, prepared his seat in front of the monks, and sat down.

5. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “What topic have you been discussing together? What was the reason you gathered here in the meeting hall?”

The monks said, “Bhagavān, we monks gathered here in the meeting hall after the midday meal to discuss this topic: ‘Good men, the Bhagavān is rare and extraordinary. He cultivates mindfulness of body and discerns and disseminates it. His is the highest knowledge, highest observation, highest cultivation, and highest discipline. He has well perfected good conduct and resides in a unified mind. The Buddha teaches that mindfulness of body has great rewards. One attains the vision and eyes to see the supreme truth.’ Bhagavān, we’ve been discussing this topic together. This was the reason we gathered here in the meeting hall.”

6. The Bhagavān again addressed the monks, “How do I teach the cultivation of mindfulness of body, discerning and disseminating it? What great rewards does it attain?”

The monks then said to the Bhagavān, “The Bhagavān is the Dharma root! The Bhagavān is the Dharma Lord! The Dharma comes from the Bhagavān! May it please him to discuss it. After hearing it, we’ll get a detailed knowledge of its meaning.”

7. The Buddha then told them, “Listen closely, and consider it well. I will discern its meaning for you.”

The monks then accepted the teaching and listened.

#### The Eighteen Practices

8. The Buddha said, “How does a monk cultivate mindfulness of body? That monk walks and knows he’s walking. He stands and knows he’s standing, sits and knows he’s sitting, and lies down and knows he’s lying down. He sleeps and knows he’s sleeping, wakes and knows he’s waking, and he sleeps and wakes and knows he’s slept and woke up.

9. “Thus, a monk follows his physical actions, truly knowing the above. If he thus goes into seclusion and lives alone, his thoughts aren’t careless. He cultivates diligence, stops mental disturbances, and attains a concentrated state of mind. After attaining a concentrated state of mind, he then truly knows the above. This is called a monk who cultivates mindfulness of body.

10. “Furthermore, a monk cultivates mindfulness of body. That monk correctly knows that he’s entering and exiting, observes and discerns well that he’s bending and stretching high and low. His manner is peaceful, and he wears his outer and other robes and carries his bowl well. He’s correctly aware when walking, standing, sitting, lying, sleeping, waking, speaking, and being silent.

11. “Thus, a monk follows his physical actions, knowing the above as it truly is. If he thus goes into seclusion and lives alone, his thoughts aren’t careless. He cultivates diligence, stops mental disturbances, and attains a concentrated state of mind. After attaining a concentrated state of mind, he then truly knows the above. This is called a monk who cultivates mindfulness of body.

12. “Furthermore, a monk cultivates mindfulness of body. That monk produces mindfulness of what’s bad and unskillful. He subdues and extinguishes it with mindfulness of what’s good. He’s like a carpenter or a carpenter’s apprentice who ties wood together with a cord and then chops off the excess with a sharp ax to make it straight. Thus, the monk produces mindfulness of what’s bad and unskillful, and he subdues and extinguishes it with mindfulness of what’s good.

13. “Thus, a monk follows his physical actions, truly knowing the above. If he thus goes into seclusion and lives alone, his thoughts aren’t careless. He cultivates diligence, stops mental disturbances, and attains a concentrated state of mind. After attaining a concentrated state of mind, he then truly knows the above. This is called a monk who cultivates mindfulness of body.

14. “Furthermore, a monk cultivates mindfulness of body. That monk puts his teeth together, presses his tongue up against his palate, and uses his mind to govern his thoughts, subduing and extinguishing them. It’s like two strong men arresting a weak man. They go from place to place holding, controlling, and disciplining him. Thus, that monk puts his teeth together, presses his tongue against his palate, and uses his mind to govern his thoughts, subduing and extinguishing them.

15. “Thus, a monk follows his physical actions, truly knowing the above. If he thus goes into seclusion and lives alone, his thoughts aren’t careless. He cultivates diligence, stops mental disturbances, and attains a concentrated state of mind. After attaining a concentrated state of mind, he then truly knows the above. This is called a monk who cultivates mindfulness of body.

16. “Furthermore, a monk cultivates mindfulness of body. That monk is mindful of breathing in and knows he’s mindful of breathing in. He’s mindful of breathing out and knows he’s mindful of breathing out. He breaths in long and knows he’s breathing in long. He breaths out long and knows he’s breathing out long. He breaths in short and knows he’s breathing in short. He breaths out short and knows that he’s breathing out short. He learns to breath in with his whole body and learns to breath out with his whole body. He learns to calm his physical activity when breathing in and learns to calm his verbal activity when breathing out.

17. “Thus, a monk follows his physical actions, truly knowing the above. If he thus goes into seclusion and lives alone, his thoughts aren’t careless. He cultivates diligence, stops mental disturbances, and attains a concentrated state of mind. After attaining a concentrated state of mind, he then truly knows the above. This is called a monk who cultivates mindfulness of body.

18. “Furthermore, a monk cultivates mindfulness of body. That monk’s body is wet and moistened by joy and happiness that arises from seclusion. It thoroughly fills what’s in his body. There’s nowhere that joy and happiness that arises from seclusion doesn’t reach. It’s like a bath worker who fills a dish with soap and mixes it with water to make a ball. The water wets and moistens it and thoroughly fills it. There’s nowhere it doesn’t reach. Thus, a monk’s body is wet and moistened by joy and happiness that arises from seclusion. It thoroughly fills what’s in his body. There’s nowhere that joy and happiness that arises from seclusion doesn’t reach.

19. “Thus, a monk follows his physical actions, truly knowing the above. If he thus goes into seclusion and lives alone, his thoughts aren’t careless.

20. “Furthermore, a monk cultivates mindfulness of body. That monk’s body is wet and moistened by joy and happiness that arises from _samādhi_. It thoroughly fills what’s in his body. There’s nowhere that joy and happiness that arises from seclusion doesn’t reach. It’s like a mountain spring that fills to overflowing with the purest and clearest water. On all four sides, there’s no way for water to go into it. From the bottom of that spring, the water spontaneously wells up and flows out to wet and moisten the mountain and thoroughly fill it. There’s nowhere it doesn’t reach. Thus, a monk’s body is wet and moistened by the joy and happiness that arises from _samādhi_. It thoroughly fills what’s in his body. There’s nowhere that joy and happiness that arises from _samādhi_ doesn’t reach.

21. “Thus, a monk follows his physical actions, truly knowing the above. If he thus goes into seclusion and lives alone, his thoughts aren’t careless.

22. “Furthermore, a monk cultivates mindfulness of body. That monk’s body is wet and moistened by happiness that arises from the absence of joy. It thoroughly fills what’s in his body. There’s nowhere that happiness that arises from the absence of joy doesn’t reach. It’s like the blue lotus and the red and white lotuses, which are born from water and grow in water. At the water’s bottom, their roots, stems, flowers, and leaves are all wet and moistened. They are thoroughly filled, and there’s nowhere the water doesn’t reach. Thus, the monk’s body is wet and moistened by happiness that arises from the absence of joy. It thoroughly fills what’s in his body. There’s nowhere that happiness that arises from the absence of joy doesn’t reach.

He’s like a person wearing a seven- or eight-cubit robe. From head to toe, there’s no part of his body that isn’t covered. Thus, what’s in that monk’s body is filled with the accomplishment of the mental freedom of a pure mind. There’s nowhere in his body that that pure mind doesn’t reach.

25. “Thus, a monk follows his physical actions, truly knowing the above. If he thus goes into seclusion and lives alone, his thoughts aren’t careless.

As above, it’s likewise below. Thus, he isn’t mistaken, and his mind has no fetters. He cultivates a radiant mind, and his mind is never covered by darkness.

30. “Furthermore, a monk cultivates mindfulness of body. That monk follows this body’s loveliness and ugliness from head to toe according to its abiding.

It’s because that ascetic or priest is empty and lacks mindfulness of body. They’re like a clay pot that’s empty and lacks water when it’s placed upright on the ground. If someone were to bring water and pour it into the pot, what do you monks think? Will that pot accept the water this way?”
