## Chapter 8: Defilement

96. Not Having
1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma96note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.
2. It was then that Venerable Śāriputra addressed the monks, “Venerables, suppose a monk or nun isn’t able to hear the Dharma they haven’t heard yet, or they forget it after having heard it. Suppose that they’ve practiced, spread, and recited the Dharma before and understood it with wisdom, but they don’t remember it anymore. They know it, and then they don’t know it. Venerables, this is called a monk or nun who has declined in the pure Dharma.[2](#^ma96note02)
3. “Venerables, suppose a monk or nun is able to hear the Dharma they haven’t heard yet, and they don’t forget it after having heard it. Suppose that they’ve practiced, spread, and recited the Dharma before, understood it with wisdom, and they always remember it. They knew it, and they still know it. Venerables, this is called a monk or nun who has improved in the pure Dharma.
4. “Venerables, a monk should contemplate in this way: ‘Do I have covetousness, or do I have no covetousness? Do I have hateful thoughts, or do I have no hateful thoughts? Am I ensnared in drowsiness, or am I not ensnared in drowsiness? Do I have haughtiness, or do I have no haughtiness? Do I have uncertainty, or do I have no uncertainty? Am I violent, or am I not violent? Do I have defiled thoughts, or do I have no defiled thoughts? Do I have faith, or do I have no faith? Do I have energy, or do I have no energy? Do I have mindfulness, or do I have no mindfulness? Am I settled, or am I unsettled? Do I have poor wisdom, or do I have no poor wisdom?’[3](#^ma96note03)
5. “Venerables, suppose when he contemplates this, a monk knows, ‘I have covetousness … hateful thoughts … drowsiness … haughtiness … uncertainty … violence … defiled thoughts … no faith … no energy … no mindfulness … no settledness … have poor wisdom.’[4](#^ma96note04) Venerables, Wanting to cease these bad and unskillful things, that monk will quickly pursue the methods to do that. He trains with utmost diligence, right mindfulness, and right knowledge and patiently doesn’t let himself regress. He’s like a man with his hair or clothes on fire who instantly seeks to put them out. Thus is this monk who wants to cease these bad and unskillful things and quickly pursues the method to do that. He trains with utmost diligence, right mindfulness, and right knowledge and patiently doesn’t let himself regress.
6. “Venerables, suppose when he contemplates this, a monk knows, ‘I have no covetousness … no hateful thoughts … no drowsiness … no haughtiness … no uncertainty … no violence … no defiled thoughts … have faith … have energy … have mindfulness … have settledness … no poor wisdom.’ Wanting to abide in these skillful qualities and not forget or retreat from cultivating and disseminating them, that monk quickly seeks the method to do that. He trains with utmost diligence, right mindfulness, and right knowledge and patiently doesn’t let himself regress. He’s like a man with his hair or clothes on fire who instantly seeks to put them out. Thus, Venerables, is this monk who wants to abide in these skillful qualities and not forget or retreat from cultivating and disseminating them. He quickly seeks the method to do that. He trains with utmost diligence, right mindfulness, and right knowledge and patiently doesn’t let himself regress.”
7. This is what Venerable Śāriputra said. Those monks who heard what Venerable Śāriputra taught rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

^ma96note01
1. For the source text, cf. [T26.1.577c15-8a25]. Its parallel is [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.55]], but it shares more in common with [MĀ 95](MA_095.html) and [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.53]].
    
    The title of this _sūtra_ reads simply as 無 (“nothing” or “having no”), which might be a reading of a word similar to [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.55]]’s title, but the C. trans. of _parihāna_ (“decline, regress”) would instead be 衰退. I’ve chosen to read 無 in the way it’s used in the body of the _sūtra_, which is to mean “having no” unskillful qualities.
    
    This _sūtra_ and [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.55]] have somewhat differently worded introductions, yet they contain the same keywords and meaning. Afterward, Śāriputra gives the same teaching as the one given by the Buddha in MĀ 95, as the final three paragraphs in both _sūtra_s are nearly identical. The parallel to this _sūtra_, [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.55]], has a different teaching in which the practitioner assesses their skillful rather than unskillful qualities. As a result, it is only a similar parallel.

2. [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.55]] has a more verbose introduction in which Śāriputra announcing the topics that he would be discussing for an assembly of monk. This _sūtra_ begins at the point when he defines what being liable to decline means. Despite these differences, we can see that both include four specific points describing a person’s grasp of the Dharma: hearing Dharma that they haven’t heard yet (未聞法者得聞, _assutañceva dhammaṁ suṇāti_), not forgetting the Dharma they’ve heard (已聞法者不忘失, _sutā cassa dhammā na sammosaṁ gacchanti_), reciting or rehearsing the Dharma (若使有法本所修行、廣布、誦習, _ye cassa dhammā pubbe cetaso asamphuṭṭhapubbā te cassa samudācaranti_), and understanding it (慧之所解, _aviññātañceva vijānāti_). These points are worded differently in these two versions, but we can see the basic commonality: hearing, not forgetting, rehearsing, and understanding.

3. This list of qualities is verbatim of that found in [MĀ 95](MA_095.html). See the notes to that _sūtra_ for a detailed discussion of my translation here.

^ma96note04
4. _no energy_. C. 無進. I’ve read 進 as an abbreviation of 精進 (≈ P. _āraddhaviriya_ in MĀ 95/[[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.53]]).
