109. Examining One’s Own Mind
1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma109note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If a monk is unable to examine another’s mind well, he should examine his own mind well. He should train in that way. How does a monk examine his own mind well? If a monk performs this examination, he’ll surely gain much by it: ‘Having gained an inner calm, have I not been able to contemplate the Dharma with the highest wisdom?’[2](#^ma109note02) ‘Having been able to contemplate the Dharma with the highest wisdom, have I not gained an inner calm?’ ‘Have I neither been able to gain an inner calm nor contemplate the Dharma with the highest wisdom?’ ‘Have I gained an inner calm and contemplated the Dharma with the highest wisdom?’
3. “Suppose a monk knows this after his examination: ‘I’ve gained an inner calm, but I’m not able to contemplate the Dharma with the highest wisdom.’ After gaining an inner calm, that monk must seek to contemplate the Dharma with the highest wisdom. Sometime later, he will gain both an inner calm and contemplate the Dharma with the highest wisdom.
4. “Suppose a monk knows this after his examination: ‘I’m able to contemplate the Dharma with the highest wisdom, but I’ve not gained an inner calm.’ After abiding in the contemplation of Dharma with the highest wisdom, that monk must pursue an inner calm. Sometime later, he will gain both the contemplation of Dharma with the highest wisdom and an inner calm.
5. “Suppose a monk knows this after his examination: ‘I’ve not gained an inner calm nor am I able to contemplate the Dharma with the highest wisdom.’ Not having gained these good qualities, such a monk will quickly pursue the methods to do so out of the desire to gain them. He trains with utmost diligence, right mindfulness, right knowledge, and perseverance, not letting himself regress. He’s like a man with his hair and clothes on fire. He immediately seeks to put out his hair and clothes. Such is this monk who hasn’t gained these good qualities. He quickly pursues the methods to do so out of the desire to gain them. He trains with utmost diligence, right mindfulness, right knowledge, and perseverance, not letting himself regress. Sometime later, he will gain both an inner calm and the contemplation of the Dharma with the highest wisdom.
6. “Suppose a monk knows this after his examination: ‘I’ve gained both an inner calm and the contemplation of Dharma with the highest wisdom.’ Having abided in these good qualities, that monk must seek to realize the knowledge that his contaminants are ended. Why is that? I say there’s clothing that none of which can be kept, and I say there’s clothing that all of which can be kept.[3](#^ma109note03) What is the clothing that none of which can be kept? If keeping the clothing increases bad and unskillful qualities and diminishes skillful qualities, such clothing I say can4ot be kept.[4](#^ma109note04) What is the clothing I say can be kept? If keeping the clothing increases skillful qualities and diminishes bad and unskillful qualities, such clothing I say can be kept.
7. “_Like clothing, meals, seats, and towns are explained in the same way._[5](#^ma109note05) I say there are people whom none can be associated with, and I also say there are people whom all can be associated with. Who are the people whom I say cannot be associated with? If associating with a person increases bad and unskillful qualities and diminishes skillful qualities, such people I say cannot be associated with. Who are the people whom I say can be associated with? If associating with a person increases skillful qualities and diminishes bad and unskillful qualities, such people I say can be associated with.
8. “He truly knows which qualities should be cultivated, and he truly knows which qualities shouldn’t be cultivated. Once he truly knows that, he doesn’t cultivate the qualities that shouldn’t be cultivated, and he cultivates the qualities that should be cultivated. Once he doesn’t cultivate the qualities that he shouldn’t and cultivates the qualities that he should, he increases his skillful qualities and diminishes his bad and unskillful qualities. This is called a monk who examines his own mind well and skillfully chooses and discards qualities once he knows his mind well.”
9. This is what the Buddha said. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

^ma109note01
1. For the source text, cf. [T26.1.598b7-8c20]. [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.54]] is a direct parallel, while [MN 114] included a section that details the same list found in [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.54]], making it tangentially parallel with this _sūtra_.
    
    This _sūtra_ differs with [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.54]] in only a couple superficial ways. One is that it lacks the metaphor of a person examining their face in a mirror as a way of explaining the benefit gained by examining oneself. Second, the list of items at the end that are avoided or used depending on whether they promote skillful qualities or not is slightly different. Beyond this, these are a few language issues that I discuss in more detail in the notes below.

^ma109note02
2. _inner calm … contemplate Dharma with the highest wisdom._ C. 內止⋯最上慧觀法, P. _cetosamathassa … adhipaññādhammavipassanāya._ Here, calm (C. 止, P. _samatha_, S. _śamatha_) and contemplation (C. 觀, P. _vipassanā_, S. _vipaśyanā_) are treated as mutually supportive attainments. They are also both glossed with qualifiers: In C. the calm is within, while it’s explicitly calming of the heart in [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.54]]. Contemplation is contemplation of Dharma (or, alternatively, any particular thing) with the highest wisdom.
    
    It should be noted that “highest wisdom” (C. 最上慧, S. _adhiprajñā_) interprets _adhi-_ as _adhika_, which has a superlative meaning of “extraordinary, highest.” However, when _adhiprajñā_ describes the training in Abhidharma, _adhi_ is read as "with regard to,” and the term is then interpreted as “concerning wisdom.” The ambiguity of _adhi_ as a prefix was an issue when context didn’t make clear how it should be read (cf. Edgerton 527 under _śikṣā_).
    
    It may be that _adhiprajñā_ was here a tacit reference to Abhidharma training. It would make sense that a monk could “contemplate with the highest wisdom” while also lacking a calm heart if “highest wisdom” referred to the theoretical philosophy found in Abhidharma. This interpretation would also give us a more practical sense of what this _sūtra_ is describing, namely alternative paths of a monk’s training. A monk might train in Abhidharma before developing _samādhi_, or he might pursue meditation before studying philosophy. In either case, the monk would need to master the other discipline to be well-rounded in his training. Presumably, the training in conduct is assumed to be completed beforehand.

3. _there’s clothing that none of which can be kept … there’s clothing that all of which can be kept._ C. 不得畜一切衣⋯得畜一切衣, P. _cīvarampāhaṁ … sevitabbampi asevitabbampi._ Here, 畜 (“to store, stockpile, keep; tend to, care for”) is equivalent to P. _sevitabba_ (S. _sevitavya_). This qualifier is applied to a number of things useful to a monk: clothes, food, seating, towns, and people. Except for towns or people, they are all things that could be kept or discarded, and a town or person could be figuratively kept or discarded in terms of whether a monk chooses to associate with them or not. I’ve therefore opted for this reading of 畜.
    
    It should be noted, however, that S. _sevitavya_ does sometimes have the meaning “to be tended, taken care of,” whereas this reading is not recognized in P. This would explain the word choice in the C. translation: 畜 typically refers to the raising of livestock or children. The meaning “to keep or store” is an extension of that context: animal husbandry was often a source of wealth in terms of the number of animals that were kept and cared for.
    
    The whole clause 得畜一切衣 makes little sense literally: “can keep all clothing” and the converse “cannot keep all clothing.” I’ve assumed the grammar of the original was more complex, with “all” combining with the negative to mean “none.” The P. parallel makes this clearer by first saying there are two kinds of clothing, but it lacks any parallel for 一切 (“all, whole”).

^ma109note04
4. _bad and unskillful qualities … skillful qualities._ C. 惡不善法⋯善法, P. _akusalā dhammā … kusalā dhammā._ As is often the case, the P. parallel lacks the “bad” (惡, _pāpaka_) qualifier of unskillful qualities that is nearly ubiqitous in MĀ, though it does occur in some P. passages. The next _sūtra_, [MĀ 110](MA_110.html) will address what these unskillful qualities are, and the same list that occurs there is also found in [MĀ 95](MA_095.html) and [MĀ 96](MA_096.html). The skillful qualities would seem to be absence of each unskillful quality in this context. They could also refer to the skillful qualities taught in [MĀ 1](MA_001.html).

^ma109note05
5. [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.54]] has a slightly larger list of items: robes, food, lodging, villages or towns, countries, people, and robes again. Here, seating has been substituted for lodging, and countries are not mentioned.
