## Chapter 3: Related to Śāriputra

25. The Water Parable (2)
1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma25note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.
2. It was then that Venerable Śāriputra addressed the monks, “Venerables, now I will teach you the five ways to eliminate irritation.[2](#^ma25note02) Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well.” Those monks accepted the teaching and listened.
3. Venerable Śāriputra said, “What are the five? Venerables, there might be someone whose physical conduct is impure, but their verbal conduct is pure. If a wise person is angered by seeing this, they should eliminate that anger. Furthermore, Venerables, there might be someone whose verbal conduct is impure, but their physical conduct is pure. If a wise person is angered by seeing this, they should eliminate that anger. Furthermore, Venerables, there might be someone whose physical and verbal conduct is impure, but their mind has some purity.[3](#^ma25note03) If a wise person is angered by seeing this, they should eliminate that anger. Furthermore, Venerables, there might be someone whose physical, verbal, and mental conduct is impure. If a wise person is angered by seeing this, they should eliminate that anger. Furthermore, Venerables, there might be someone whose physical, verbal, and mental conduct is pure. If a wise person is angered by seeing this, they should eliminate that anger.
4. “Venerables, there might be someone whose physical conduct is impure, but their verbal conduct is pure. If a wise person is angered by seeing this, how should they eliminate that anger? Venerables, it’s like a forest monk[4](#^ma25note04) who takes discarded clothes from rubbish. He sees some discarded clothes in a pile of rubbish that are stained by excrement, urine, phlegm, or some other impurity. Having seen it, he holds it in his left hand and spreads it out with his right hand. He then tears off and takes what’s not stained by excrement, urine, phlegm, or some other impurity and doesn’t have holes.
5. “In this way, Venerables, there might be someone whose physical conduct is impure, but their verbal conduct is pure. Don’t think about their impure physical conduct. Just think about their pure verbal conduct. If a wise person is angered by what they see, they should eliminate that anger in this way.
6. “Venerables, there might be someone whose verbal conduct is impure, but their physical conduct is pure. If a wise person is angered by seeing this, how should they eliminate that anger? Venerables, it’s like a deep water near a village that’s hidden by moss and grass.[5](#^ma25note05) Suppose someone comes along who is hot, distressed, hungry, thirsty, exhausted, and oppressed by wind and heat. Once they reach the water, they leave their clothes on the shore and wade into the pool. Parting the moss and grass with both hands, they bathe there as much as they like, which eliminates their fever, distress, hunger, thirst, and exhaustion.
7. “In this way, Venerables, there might be someone whose verbal conduct is impure, but their physical conduct is pure. Don’t think about their impure verbal conduct. Just think about their pure physical conduct. If a wise person is angered by what they see, they should eliminate that anger in this way.
8. “Venerables, there might be someone whose physical and verbal conduct is impure, but their mind has some purity. If a wise person is angered by seeing this, how should they eliminate that anger? Venerables, it’s like a puddle in a cow’s footprint in an four-way intersection. Suppose someone comes along who is hot, distressed, hungry, thirsty, exhausted, and oppressed by wind and heat. They think, ‘This little puddle of water in this intersection would be stirred up and become muddy if I scoop it up with my hands or a leaf, and then it won’t eliminate my fever, distress, hunger, thirst, and exhaustion. I’d better kneel down on my hands and knees and drink from it with my mouth.’ They then kneel down on their hands and knees and drink from it with their mouth. Then, they can eliminate their fever, distress, hunger, thirst, and exhaustion.
9. “In this way, Venerables, there might be someone whose physical and verbal conduct is impure, but their mind has some purity. Don’t think about their impure physical and verbal conduct. Just think about their mind having some purity. Venerables, if a wise person is angered by what they see, they should eliminate that anger in this way.
10. “Venerables, there might be someone whose physical, verbal, and mental conduct is impure. If a wise person is angered by seeing this, how should they eliminate that anger? Venerables, it’s like someone who falls ill on the road while traveling a long distance. They’re in distress and exhausted, alone without companions, the last town is far away, and they’ve yet to reach the next one. Suppose someone comes along and stands next to them. They’d see that this traveler is in distress and exhausted, alone without companions, the last town is far away, and they’ve yet to reach the next one. If they can help that traveler, they would lead them from that wilderness to a town, give them excellent medicine, feed them a sumptuous meal, and look after them well. In this way, that person could surely recover from their illness. That is, this other person has thoughts of utmost compassion and caring for that ill person.
11. “In this way, Venerables, there might be someone whose physical, verbal, and mental conduct is impure. If a wise person sees this, they should think, ‘This Venerable’s physical, verbal, and mental conduct are impure. Don’t let this Venerable end up in a bad destiny or be born in hell when their body breaks up and their life ends because their physical, verbal, and mental conduct is impure. If this Venerable could meet a good friend, they would abandon their impure physical conduct and cultivate pure physical conduct … abandon their impure verbal … mental conduct and cultivate pure verbal … mental conduct. In this way, this Venerable would surely end up in a good destination or even be born up in heaven when their body breaks and their life ends because their physical, verbal, and mental conduct would be pure.’ This is the utmost thought of compassion and caring this Venerable has for that other Venerable. If a wise person is angered by what they see, they should eliminate that anger in this way.
12. “Venerables, there might be someone whose physical, verbal, and mental conduct is pure. If a wise person is angered by seeing this, how should they eliminate that anger? Venerables, it’s like a beautiful pond not far from a village that’s even more lovely when it’s clear. It’s deep, calm, and full, and it has green grass covering its banks and four rings of flowers and trees around it. Suppose someone comes along who’s hot, distressed, hungry, thirsty, exhausted, and oppressed by wind and heat. Once they reach the water, they leave their clothes on the shore and wade into the pool. They bathe as much as they like there, which eliminates their fever, distress, hunger, thirst, and exhaustion.
13. “In this way, Venerables, there might be someone whose physical, verbal, and mental conduct is pure. You should always be mindful of their pure physical, verbal, and mental conduct. If a wise person is angered by what they see, they should eliminate that anger in this way. Venerables, I said I would discuss five ways to eliminate irritation, and so I have done that.”[6](#^ma25note06)
14. This is what Venerable Śāriputra said. The monks who heard it rejoiced and approved. ^ma25note01-ref ^ma25note02-ref ^ma25note03-ref ^ma25note04-ref ^ma25note05-ref ^ma25note06-ref

### Notes

^ma25note01
1. For the source text, cf. [T26.1.454a3-c17]. The only known parallel is [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN5/AN5.162]]. While there are a few minor variations in wording, especially in the five similes used to illustrate the five methods, these two texts are identical in their meaning and structure.  
    The Taisho editors made a note about [SĀ 496] having a possible relationship with this _sūtra_. It recommends how two monks involved in a dispute should examine themselves and others to discipline themselves. There doesn’t appear to be a direct textual relationship with this _sūtra_, but they do both address the issue of monks getting upset with each other’s behavior. 

[↩︎](#^ma25note01-ref)

^ma25note02
2. _five ways to eliminate irritation_. C. 五除惱法, P. _pañcā aghatapaṭivinayā_. The C. 惱 here is a general term for irritation, vexation, anxiety, and similar unpleasant feelings that cause distress. P. _aghata_ lit. means “to be angered” and generally refers to irritation or annoyance. Throughout the _sūtra_ below, 惱 is translated as 恚惱, which I’ve rendered to English as “to be angered” as when a pet peeve or irritating situation causes a flare of emotion. 

[↩︎](#^ma25note02-ref)

^ma25note03
3. _their mind has some purity_. C. 心少有淨, P. _labhati ca kālena kālaṁ cetaso vivaraṁ cetaso pasādaṁ_. In [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN5/AN5.162]], the parallel expression is somewhat more verbose, meaning something like “who gets an openness and clarity of heart from time to time.” The C. has “purity” (淨) here where we’d expect the original to be S. _prasāda_ (P. _pasāda_). This word has many meanings in S. for a good heart ranging from kindness to clarity. It also sometimes means “faithfulness” specifically. This particular part stands out in an otherwise mechanical passage, apparently meaning that a person’s mental conduct is sometimes pure.  
    The Pali expression is repeated in the last three items of this list, while here in MĀ 25 the next two items use the more standard “mental conduct” alongside physical and verbal conduct. The result is that it seems more out of place, but it’s equally unusual in [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN5/AN5.162]] even if it was applied more consistently than here. 

[↩︎](#^ma25note03-ref)

^ma25note04
4. _forest monk_. C. 阿練若比丘 (EMC. •a-len-niă-bii-k‘iəu = _araña bhikhu_). 阿練若 is a translit. of Pr. _araña_ (G. _araṃña_, P. _arañña_, S. _araṇya_), which lit. means “forest, wilderness.” Applied to a monk, it usu. means a renunciate who lives away from towns and cities in remote forests or other types of uninhabited areas. This qualifier doesn’t occur in [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN5/AN5.162]]. 

[↩︎](#^ma25note04-ref)

^ma25note05
5. _hidden by moss and grass_. C. 藳草所覆, P. _sevālapaṇakapariyonaddhā_. The P. expression lit. means “overgrown by (_pariyonaddhā_) aquatic plants and moss (_sevālapaṇaka_).” Interestingly, a variant reading replaces 藳 (“straw”) with 苔 (“moss”). I’ve adopted this other reading given that it agrees with the Pali. 

[↩︎](#^ma25note05-ref)

^ma25note06
6. _I said I would discuss five ways to eliminate irritation, and so I have done that._. C. 我向所說五除惱法者，因此故說. This brief conclusion to Śāriputra’s discourse is one of the few places that MĀ 25 and [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN5/AN5.162]] disagree. In AN, Sāriputta concludes instead with: “Relying on a person who is impressive all around, the mind becomes confident” (_samantapāsādikaṁ, āvuso, puggalaṁ āgamma cittaṁ pasīdati_).
