### Translating Classical Buddhism to Modern English
### Translator: Charles Patton

## Chapter 2: Related to Deeds

13. Crossings
1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma13note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are three fording places of different clans, different names, different traditions, and different teachings. That is to say, they are well accepted, firmly held, and taught to others by wise people, but they aren’t profitable. What are the three?
3. “Some ascetics and priests have a view and a teaching that says the cause of everything a person does is created by their previous lives.[2](#^ma13note02) Again, some ascetics and priests have a view and a teaching that says the cause of everything a person does is created by the Lord God.[3](#^ma13note03) Again, some ascetics and priests have a view and a teaching that says that there is no cause or condition for anything a person does.
4. “Now, if some ascetic or priest had a view and a teaching that said the cause of everything a person does is created by their previous lives, I would visit them. Upon arriving, I would then ask, ‘Venerables, is it true that you have a view and a teaching that says the cause of everything a person does is created by their previous lives?’
“They would answer, ‘That’s right.’
5. “I would again say to them, ‘If that’s so, then you Venerables are all killers of beings. Why is that? Because the cause of all that is created by your previous lives. Thus, you Venerables take what’s not given … engage in wrong sex … speak falsely … _up to_ … have wrong views. Why is that? Because the cause of all that is created by your previous lives.
6. “‘Venerables, if someone truly has the view that the cause of all this is created by previous lives, that would be an internal cause for them to do what shouldn’t be done. None of them would have any desire or make any effort.[4](#^ma13note04) Venerables, if they do what they shouldn’t, and they don’t truly know it, then they’d lose their right mindfulness and have no right knowledge. Then, they’d be impossible to instruct.’ When an ascetic’s teaching makes such a claim, that ascetic or priest can be defeated with reason.
7. “Now, if some ascetic or priest had a view and a teaching that said the cause of everything a person does is created by the Lord God, I would visit them. Upon arriving, I would then ask, ‘Venerables, is it true that you have a view and a teaching that says the cause of everything a person does is created by the Lord God?’
“They would answer, ‘That’s right.’
8. “Again, I would say to them, ‘If that’s so, Venerables, all of you are killers of beings. Why is that? Because the cause of all that is created by God. Thus, Venerables, you take what’s not given … engage in wrong sex … speak falsely … _up to_ … have wrong views. Why is that? Because the cause of all that is created by God.

None of them would have any desire or make any effort. Venerables, if they do what they shouldn’t, and they don’t truly know it, then they’d lose their right mindfulness and have no right knowledge. Then, they’d be impossible to instruct.’ When an ascetic’s teaching makes such a claim, that ascetic or priest can be defeated with reason.
10. “Now, if some ascetic or priest had a view and a teaching that said there is no cause or condition for anything a person does, I would visit them. Upon arriving, I would then ask, ‘Venerables, is it true that you have a view and a teaching that says there is no cause or condition for anything a person does?’
“They would answer, ‘That’s right.’
11. “Again, I would say to them, ‘If that’s so, Venerables, all of you are killers of beings. Why is that? Because there’s no cause or condition for any of that. Thus, Venerables, you take what’s not given … engage in wrong sex … speak falsely … _up to_ … have wrong views. Why is that? Because there’s no cause or condition for any of that.
12. “‘Venerables, if someone truly has the view that there’s no cause or condition for any of this, that would be an internal cause for them to do what shouldn’t be done. None of them would have any desire or make any effort. Venerables, if they do what they shouldn’t, and they don’t truly know it, then they’d lose their right mindfulness and have no right knowledge. Then, they’d be impossible to instruct.’ When an ascetic’s teaching makes such a claim, that ascetic or priest can be defeated with reason.
13. “No ascetic, priest, god like Māra or Brahmā, or any other worldly person can defeat, defile, or overcome this Dharma that I’ve known and realized myself and teach for you.[5](#^ma13note05) How is it that no ascetic, priest, god like Māra or Brahmā, or any other worldly person can defeat, defile, or overcome this Dharma that I’ve known and realized myself and teach for you? ‘There are six senses’ is a principle that I’ve known and realized myself and teach for you, which no ascetic, priest, god like Māra or Brahmā, or any other worldly person can defeat, defile, or overcome. Again, ‘there are six elements’[6](#^ma13note06) is a principle that I’ve known and realized myself and teach for you, which no ascetic, priest, god like Māra or Brahmā, or any other worldly person can defeat, defile, or overcome.
14. “What is the principle of the six senses[7](#^ma13note07) that I’ve known and realized myself and teach for you? They are the sense of the eye … ear … nose … tongue … body … sense of the mind. This is the principle of the six senses that I’ve known and realized myself and teach for you. What is the principle of the six elements that I’ve known and realized myself and teach for you? They are the element of earth … water … fire … air … space, and element of awareness. This is the principle of six elements that I’ve known and realized myself and teach for you.
15. “One is born in a mother’s womb because these six elements come together. As a result of these six elements, the six senses exist.[8](#^ma13note08) As a result of these six senses, there is contact. As a result of contact, there is feeling. Monks, if someone has feeling, then they will truly know suffering … the formation of suffering … the cessation of suffering, and truly know the path to suffering’s cessation.[9](#^ma13note09)
16. “How do they truly know suffering? It’s the suffering of birth, suffering of old age, suffering of illness, suffering of death, suffering of associating with what’s disliked, suffering of being separated from what’s loved, and suffering of not getting what’s sought. In brief, it’s the suffering of the five proliferating aggregates. This is truly knowing suffering.
17. “How do they truly know the formation of suffering? ‘This craving will get a future existence, bring me together with delight and desires, and seek this or that existence.’ This is truly knowing the formation of suffering.[10](#^ma13note10)
18. “How do they truly know the cessation of suffering? ‘This craving will get a future existence, bring me together with delight and desires, and seek this or that existence’: They eliminate this [craving] without remainder and abandon, reject, exhaust, and have no desire for it. It ceases, stops, and disappears. This is truly knowing the cessation of suffering.[11](#^ma13note11)
19. “How is the path to suffering’s cessation truly known? It’s the eightfold noble path: Right view … _up to_ … right _samādhi_ are the eight. This is truly knowing the path to suffering’s cessation.
20. “Monks, you should truly know suffering, should eliminate the formation of suffering, should realize the cessation of suffering, and should cultivate the path to suffering’s cessation. If a monk truly knows suffering, eliminates the formation of suffering, realizes the cessation of suffering, and cultivates the path to suffering’s cessation, this is a monk who has ended all the contaminants. Once he is freed from the bonds, he can reach the end of suffering with right knowledge.”
21. This is what the Buddha said. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved. ^ma13note01-ref ^ma13note02-ref ^ma13note03-ref ^ma13note04-ref ^ma13note05-ref ^ma13note06-ref ^ma13note07-ref ^ma13note08-ref ^ma13note09-ref ^ma13note10-ref ^ma13note11-ref

### Notes

^ma13note01
1. For the source text, cf. [T26.1.435a24-6a11]. It’s parallel with [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN3/AN3.61]].  
    The title of this _sūtra_ was translated as 度 (“go beyond, liberate, freedom”), but 度 is often read as a simpler form of 渡 (“to ford a river”). This is confirmed when we observe that the Theravāda parallel is titled P. _titthāyatana_. Here, _tittha_ is reasonably read in this context as meaning the tenets or doctrines of a religious sect, but the literal meaning is a “fording place” on a river. This is because Indian liberation religions used the metaphor of crossing a river or flood for the attainment of their ultimate goal. Thus, the truths or tenets that they claimed would achieve that goal were idiomatically called “fording places.” Given all of this, we can safely assume that 度 translates a cognate of P. _tittha_ (cf. G. _tiṭ́ha_ > S. _tīrtha_). I’ve maintained the literal reading to represent the C. translator’s intent.  
    In general, this _sūtra_ is a close parallel to [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN3/AN3.61]]. There are, however, some significant differences in wording, and the AN version has an added section on eighteen mental preoccupations. Otherwise, the two texts are the same in their basic outline and content.

^ma13note02
2. _everything a person does._ C. 人所為一切, P. _yaṁ kiñcāyaṁ purisapuggalo paṭisaṁvedeti sukhaṁ vā dukkhaṁ vā adukkhamasukhaṁ vā sabbaṁ_. There is a divergence here with [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN3/AN3.61]]. The C. translation speaks of “everything done by a person” (人所為一切) while the P. speaks of “everything that a person experiences …” (_purisapuggalo paṭisaṁvedeti … sabbaṁ_). The passage reads the same aside from this alternation between 所為 and _paṭisaṁvedeti sukhaṁ vā dukkhaṁ vā adukkhamasukhaṁ_. The C. version seems to fit the larger context better given that the Buddha tells the holders of these views that they must break the cardinal precepts (presumably because they don’t take responsibility for their actions). Still, the Theravāda version makes sense in a more indirect way: A person might not take holding precepts seriously if they don’t think they are the cause of what they will experience. Essentially, the argument is one of free will vs. determinism or random fate. 

[↩︎](#^ma13note02-ref)

^ma13note03
3. _created by the Lord God._ C. 尊祐造, P. _issara nimmāna_, S. _īśvara nirmāṇa_. 尊祐 lit. means “honored” or “excellent blessing.” This term also occurs in MĀ 18, 19, 28, 104, and 174. In MĀ 19, we find the term used in the similar context of discussing Jain beliefs. The other passages all involve a recitation of three heavenly figures, the sun, moon, and 尊祐, making it clear that it was the name or title of a god.  
    Outside of MĀ, this particular term only occurs in two other C. texts: An older translation of a _prajñāpāramitā sūtra_ (cf. [T221.8.68a17]) and twice in a _samādhi sūtra_ (cf. [T636.15.514a10] & [516c2]). All three of these cases appear to translate S. _bhagavān_ in reference to the Buddha. In MĀ, however, S. _bhagavān_ was translated as 眾祐 (“many blessings”) when it occurs in the context of the ten epithets.  
    The difficulty is that S. _īśvara_ itself was often a superlative title for gods with similar interpretations as _bhagavān_, so C. translations of the two terms were somewhat interchangeable. A clearer C. trans. of _īśvara_ was 尊豪, which lit. means “honored and great,” or perhaps “supreme lord.” While 尊祐 bears some resemblance to translations of S. _bhagavān_ (世尊 and 衆祐), it’s reasonable enough to assume the original passage here read the same as [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN3/AN3.61]] and MN 101 (_issara nimmāna_). It’s possible that it was _bhagavān_ rendered differently to disambiguate it as a title of a god instead of the Buddha. I’ve translated the passage assuming that 尊祐 translated S. _īśvara_, but the translator’s intention isn’t entirely clear to me.

^ma13note04
4. _Venerables, if someone truly has the view that the cause of all this is created by previous lives, that would be an internal cause for them to do what shouldn’t be done. None of them would have any desire or make any effort._. C. 諸賢，若一切皆因宿命造，見如真者，於內因內，作以不作，都無欲、無方便, P. _pubbekataṁ kho pana, bhikkhave, sārato paccāgacchataṁ na hoti chando vā vāyāmo vā idaṁ vā karaṇīyaṁ idaṁ vā akaraṇīyanti_.  
    作以不作 would appear to correspond with _idaṁ vā karaṇīyaṁ idaṁ vā akaraṇīyanti_, and 都無欲、無方便 corresponds with to _na hoti chando vā vāyāmo_, but 於內因內 doesn’t have a parallel in [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN3/AN3.61]] that I can see. Its intended meaning is unclear.  
    A theory was proposed by the BDK translators that 因內 is a literary abbrev. of 因明 and 内明. This might be plausible if we were reading native exegetical prose, but not so much in this context. It’s not uncommon for the translator of MĀ to render passages in overly literal ways that were nearly impenetrable in Chinese. In these situations, we have to guard against the impulse to assume a convenient meaning and then fashion a rationalization for it. Instead, we need to pay attention to what the original translator was likely to be rendering.  
    內 most likely translated the equiv. of P. _ajjhatta_ and 因 would be P. _hetu_ or a word synomynous with it. When Buddhists speak of “internal” and “external” they usu. mean “self” vs. “other” or “oneself” vs. “the outside environment.” Using the term “internal” might serve to point out the irony that a view about external causes for bad behavior (i.e., past _karma_ or a creator god) is actually an internal cause for that behavior. The Buddha’s point may be that these views would cause one to not take responsibility for their actions in the present. The same argument is repeated for the next two beliefs that effectively shift responsibility from the person doing these deeds. Thus, my best guess is that 於內因內 meant something like “an internal cause for oneself …” But here the Buddha is speaking theoretically of other people, so I translate the second 內 as “them.”

^ma13note05
5. _no ascetic, priest, god like Māra or Brahmā, or any other worldly person can defeat, defile, or overcome this Dharma that I’ve known and realized myself and teach for you._. C. 我所自知、自覺法，為汝說者，若沙門、梵志，若天、魔、梵及餘世間皆無能伏，皆無能穢，皆無能制, P. _ayaṁ kho pana, bhikkhave, mayā dhammo desito aniggahito asaṅkiliṭṭho anupavajjo appaṭikuṭṭho samaṇehi brāhmaṇehi viññūhi._  
    While these two statements in C. and P. are essentially the same, there are notable differences in wording. [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN3/AN3.61]] only mentions ascetics and priests, while this version expands that part of the statement to be all inclusive of gods and any other person.  
    Also, the first two verbs in this version correspond well enough to those in [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN3/AN3.61]]: 無能伏 (“none can defeat”) ≈ _aniggahito_ (“irrefutable”) and 無能穢 (“none can defile”) ≈ _asaṅkiliṭṭho_ (“undefiled, uncorrupted”). However, 無能制 (“none can overcome”) doesn’t match either _anupavajjo_ (“blameless, beyond reproach”) or _appaṭikuṭṭho_ (“not scorned, not disapproved”).  
    It would seem that both versions have added content in different but harmless ways.

^ma13note06
6. _six senses … six elements._. [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN3/AN3.61]] adds eighteen mental preoccupations (_aṭṭhārasa manopavicārā_) and the four noble truths (_cattāri ariyasaccāni_) to this list of subjects to be defined. The four noble truths are brought up later in this version, but they aren’t announced as a subject to be covered in this passage. The eighteen preoccupations are the happiness, sadness, and indifference (_somanassa_, _domanassa_, and _upekkhā_) that result from each of the six types of sense experience (i.e., three feelings x six senses = eighteen preoccupations). 

[↩︎](#^ma13note06-ref)

^ma13note07
7. _principle of the six senses._. C. 六處法, P. _phassāyatanāni_. This version diverges a bit from [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN3/AN3.61]]. While the underlying word that 處 trans. is no doubt a cognate of P. _āyatanāni_, [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN3/AN3.61]] went in a different direction, qualifying the _āyatanāni_ as “places of contact,” which are the same six senses. 

[↩︎](#^ma13note07-ref)

^ma13note08
8. _as a result of these six elements, the six senses exist._. C. 因六界便有六處, P. _okkantiyā sati nāmarūpaṁ, nāmarūpapaccayā saḷāyatanaṁ_. [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN3/AN3.61]] inserts name and form (_nāmarūpa_) as the antecedent of the six senses, whereas this version does not. We should note that the six elements could be considered equivalent to name and form since they include the four material elements and awareness. Sarvāstivādins defined name as the four formless aggregates and considered awareness to imply the other three formless aggregates (i.e., feeling, conception, and volition) as being present as well. This might explain why name and form is missing in this passage. 

[↩︎](#^ma13note08-ref)

^ma13note09
9. _if someone has feeling, then they will truly know suffering …_. C. 若有覺者便知苦如真⋯, P. _vediyamānassa kho panāhaṁ, bhikkhave, idaṁ dukkhanti paññapemi …_. This version reads awkwardly, as it seems to imply that anyone who is subject to feeling will come to know the four noble truths. [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN3/AN3.61]] reads differently: The Buddha teaches the four noble truths for such people. The difference is in the verbs that take the noble truths as their object. The C. passage has “to truly know” (≈ S. _yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti_) where [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN3/AN3.61]] has “to teach, declare” (P. _paññapemi_). Both share the same root (S. _prajñā_, P. _pañña_), so it’s conceivable that a phonetic change or conflation is responsible for the different readings.  
    [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN3/AN3.61]] certainly seems to make better sense here. Taken literally, this version in MĀ is reminescent of the later Buddhist idea that suffering inevitably leads to awakening as beings cycling through _saṃsāra_ endlessly are certain to (eventually) encounter the Dharma, practice it, and escape rebirth. 

[↩︎](#^ma13note09-ref)

^ma13note10
10. [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN3/AN3.61]] instead defines the origin of suffering as the twelve-step chain of dependent origination that begins with ignorance. 

[↩︎](#^ma13note10-ref)

^ma13note11
11. [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN3/AN3.61]] also defines the cessation of suffering as the twelve-step chain of dependent cessation that begins with the cessation of ignorance.
