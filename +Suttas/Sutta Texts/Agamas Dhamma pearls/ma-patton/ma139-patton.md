## Chapter 11: The Greats

139. The Path of Calming
1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma139note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Junior monks who’ve recently accomplished the precepts should frequently resort to the path of calming by contemplating these signs:[2](#^ma139note02) signs of bones, blueness, rot, being eaten, and the skeleton. Once these signs have been well perceived and retained, they should return to their residence. They should then wash their hands and feet, spread out their sitting mat, sit down cross-legged on that seat, and recollect these signs: signs of bones, blueness, rot, being eaten, and the skeleton. Why is that? If that monk develops these signs, he will quickly rid his mind of the illnesses of desire and dislike.”
3. Thereupon, the Bhagavān spoke these verses:
- “If a junior monk’s training    
    Has yet to yield a calm mind,    
    He should resort to the path of calming    
    Wanting to get rid of his lust.[3](#^ma139note03)
- With no hateful disputes in his heart,    
    He has compassion for sentient beings.    
    Everywhere in all directions,    
    He goes to contemplate their bodies.
- He should observe the sign of blueness    
    And being rotten, putrid, and scattered.    
    Observe them eaten by birds and insects    
    And their bones linked together with sinews.[4](#^ma139note04)
- Having developed these signs,    
    [Junior monks] return to their homes,    
    Wash their hands and feet,    
    Prepare a seat, and sit upright.
- They should contemplate truly    
    Their own body and other bodies,    
    The feces and urine filling them,    
    And their hearts, kidneys, livers, and lungs.[5](#^ma139note05)
- If they want a serving of food,    
    They go among people in a village.    
    Like officers marching in armor,    
    Their attention is on what’s ahead of them.
- If they see a form that’s lovely    
    And associated with desire for purity,[6](#^ma139note06)    
    They observe its reality upon seeing it,    
    Mindful of the Buddha’s Dharma and Vinaya.
- There are no bones or sinews,    
    Neither flesh nor blood,    
    No heart, kidneys, liver, or lungs,    
    And no tears, spit, or brains.
- The whole earth is empty,    
    And likewise is the water element.    
    Empty is all that is fire element;    
    Likewise is the air element empty.
- Whatever feelings they have    
    That are associated with the desire for purity,    
    They are all calmed    
    And observed the way a sage observes them.
- They practice in this way diligently,    
    Recollecting perceptions of the impure.    
    Ending lust, hate, and delusion forever,    
    They are rid of all ignorance.    
    When they produce pure insight,    
    A monk reaches the end of suffering.”
4. This is what the Buddha said. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved. ^ma139note01-ref ^ma139note02-ref ^ma139note03-ref ^ma139note04-ref ^ma139note05-ref ^ma139note06-ref

### Notes

^ma139note01
1. For the source text, cf. [T26.1.646c9-7a14]. The Taisho editors suggest [Snp 1.11] as a parallel. These two texts share the same general topic of contemplating the perceptions of impurity, but they do not appear to descend from a common source. Perhaps they are inspired by only a verse or two summarizing the meditations on impurity.  
    Buddhaghosa reports two origin stories for Snp 1.11 in his commentary. The first teaching was said to be for the benefit of a nun who was still attached to her own beauty by making her realize its impermanence. The second teaching was to correct a monk after a beautiful laywoman who had supported him passed away.  
    The brief background provided here in MĀ 139 seems to be in a different context of teaching junior monks in general. Also, the verses here begin by saying a monk calms his feelings of dislike by contemplating the bodies of all sentient beings, which then makes him feel compassion for them. I would think the origin story for MĀ 139 would’ve been different from the two stories that Buddhaghosa tells us (both of which involve not a small amount of mysogyny).

^ma139note02
2. _signs._ C. 相. Sometimes in Middle Chinese, similarly pronounced or written words became interchangeable, which causes confusion when read literally. 相 and 想 were a case of this. 相 typically translated S. _nimitta_ or _lakṣaṇa_ (“sign, image”), while 想 translated words like S. _saṃjñā_ (“notion, idea, perception”), but sometimes 相 should actually be read as a simplified form of 想.  
    This passage appears to reference the nine perceptions of impurity, but it doesn’t do so completely or in the usual order. It might be better to assume 相 was read as 想, but I have left it as it is in my translation for now. The intention may have been to label these items as the “attributes” of a decaying body that served as objects of contemplation exercises. If that were the case, the original may have read S. _nimitta_ (or similar) instead of _saṃjñā_.

^ma139note03
3. _If a junior monk’s training/ Has yet to yield a calm mind,//_ C. 若年少比丘，覺未得上意. I’ve adopted two alternate readings found in the Taisho notes that make better sense of the second line (覺未得上意 > **學**未得**止**意). Using the Taisho edition, my translation would read: “If a junior monk’s feeling (?)/ Has yet to yield the higher mentality,//”.

^ma139note04
4. This verse corresponds generally to verses 8-9 in Snp 1.11 (i.e., Snp 202-3). 

[↩︎](#^ma139note04-ref)

^ma139note05
5. This verse corresponds generally to verses 3-7 in Snp 1.11 (i.e. Snp 197-201). 

[↩︎](#^ma139note05-ref)

^ma139note06
6. _associated with desire for purity_. C. 清淨欲相應. The BDK translators chose to render this expression as “associated purely with desire,” which is likely because they did not understand how purity (清淨) could be a modifier of desire (欲) or vice versa. So, they read it as an adverb of “associated with” (相應).  
    This expression makes more sense read straightfowardly when we remember that S. _śubha_ (P. _subha_) was usually trans. to C. as 清淨. The subject of this text are the perceptions of impurity, which are the _aśubha saṃjñā_ (P. _asubha saññā_). P. _subha_ is often trans. to English as “beauty” because it’s a form of sensual purity that instigates desire.  
    Therefore, I’m assuming that 清淨欲 translated something like _śubha chanda_, meaning “desire for purity” in the sense of the desire for what’s attractive. This is precisely what the _aśubha saṃjñā_ contemplations are meant to counteract.  
    The overall context of this verse suggest that the “lovely form” that a monk guards against when he goes into a village is probably that of a woman, but perhaps it could apply to other things that are attractive.
