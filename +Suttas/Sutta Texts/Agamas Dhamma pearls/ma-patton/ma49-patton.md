### 49. Veneration

1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma49note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove. ^ma49note01-ref

2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “A monk should pay respect to, observe well, and pay homage to others of the religious life. Suppose a monk hasn’t paid respects to, well observed, or paid homage to others of the religious life. There’s no way he’ll be well behaved. Not being well behaved, there’s no way he’ll possess learning. Not being learned, there’s no way he’ll possess the body of precepts. Not possessing the body of precepts, there’s no way he’ll possess the body of samādhi. Not possessing the body of samādhi, there’s no way he’ll possess the body of wisdom. Not possessing the body of wisdom, there’s no way he’ll possess the body of liberation. Not possessing the body of liberation, there’s no way he’ll see and know the body of liberation. Not seeing and knowing the body of liberation, there’s no way he’ll possess nirvāṇa.

3. “Suppose a monk pays respect to, observes well, and pays homage to others of the religious life. It’s possible for him to be well behaved. Being well behaved, it’s possible for him to possess learning. Being learned, it’s possible for him to possess the body of precepts. Possessing the body of precepts, it’s possible for him to possess the body of samādhi. Possessing the body of samādhi, it’s possible for him to possess the body of wisdom. Possessing the body of wisdom, it’s possible for him to possess the body of liberation. Possessing the body of liberation, it’s possible for him to see and know the body of liberation. Seeing and knowing the body of liberation, it’s possible for him to possess nirvāṇa.”

4. This is what the Buddha said. Those monks who had heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

^ma49note01
1. For the source text, cf. [T26.1.486c21-7a13]. The closest Pali parallel to this _sūtra_ is [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN5/AN5.22]], but this list has additional steps.
