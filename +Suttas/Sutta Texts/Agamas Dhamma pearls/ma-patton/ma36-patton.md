## Chapter 4: Unprecedented Things

36. Earthquake
Begin Fascicle 9

1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma36note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to a city called *Mahī in the country of Vajrā.[2](#^ma36note02)
2. At the time, there was a great earthquake. During that great earthquake, strong winds blew from all four sides, comets appeared in all four directions, and houses and walls crumbled and were destroyed.[3](#^ma36note03) Venerable Ānanda witnessed this great earthquake, during which strong winds blew from all four sides, comets appeared in all four directions, and houses and walls crumbled and were destroyed.
3. When he saw this, Venerable Ānanda was frightened and his hair stood on end. He went to the Buddha, bowed his head at his feet, and withdrew to stand at one side. He said, “Bhagavān, there was a great earthquake just now! During that great earthquake, strong winds blew from all four sides, comets appeared in all four directions, and houses and walls crumbled and were destroyed.”
The Bhagavān then said to Venerable Ānanda, “Yes, Ānanda, there was a great earthquake just now. Yes, Ānanda, during that great earthquake, strong winds blew from all four sides, comets appeared in all four directions, and houses and walls crumbled and were destroyed.”
4. Venerable Ānanda asked, “Bhagavān, how many causes and conditions are there that cause a great earthquake, during which strong winds blow from all four sides, comets appear in all four directions, and houses and walls crumble and are destroyed?”
5. The Bhagavān replied, “Ānanda, there are three causes and conditions for a great earthquake, during which strong winds blow from all four sides, comets appear in all four directions, and houses and walls crumble and are destroyed. What are the three?[4](#^ma36note04)
6. “Ānanda, this Earth rests on water, the water rests on wind, and the wind is supported by empty space. Ānanda, sometimes a great wind blows in the empty space. When the wind rises, the water is disturbed. When the water is disturbed, there is an earthquake. This is the first cause and condition for a great earthquake, during which strong winds blow from all four sides, comets appear in all four directions, and houses and walls crumble and are destroyed.
7. “Furthermore, Ānanda, a monk has great psychic abilities, great majesty, great blessings, great spiritual power, and the psychic abilities of mental freedom. He might form the idea that the Earth is small and the idea that the water is measureless. The Earth responds to his wishes because of that. Following his thinking, it’s disturbed repeatedly and shakes repeatedly. A monk-protecting god would likewise have great psychic abilities, great majesty, great blessings, great spiritual power, and the psychic abilities of mental freedom. He might form the idea that the Earth is small and the idea that the water is measureless. The Earth responds to his wishes because of that. Following his thinking, it’s disturbed repeatedly and shakes repeatedly. This is the second cause and condition for a great earthquake, during which strong winds blow from all four sides, comets appear in all four directions, and houses and walls crumble and are destroyed.
8. “Furthermore, Ānanda, suppose a Tathāgata will _parinirvāṇa_ soon, within the next three months. This is a reason for a great earthquake, during which strong winds blow from all four sides, comets appear in all four directions, and houses and walls crumble and are destroyed. This is the third cause and condition for a great earthquake, during which strong winds blow from all four sides, comets appear in all four directions, and houses and walls crumble and are destroyed.”
9. When Venerable Ānanda heard this, he cried and wept.[5](#^ma36note05) He saluted the Buddha with his hands together and said, “How amazing and extraordinary, Bhagavān, are the virtues and unprecedented qualities accomplished by the Tathāgata, the Arhat, and Completely Awakened One! Why is that? That great earthquake happened because the Tathāgata will soon _parinirvāṇa_ within the next three months. During that earthquake, strong winds blew from all four sides, comets appeared in all four directions, and houses and walls crumbled and were destroyed.”
The Bhagavān said to Venerable Ānanda, “Yes, Ānanda! Yes, Ānanda! The virtues and unprecedented qualities accomplished by the Tathāgata, the Arhat, and Completely Awakened One are amazing and extraordinary. Why is that? That great earthquake happened because the Tathāgata will soon _parinirvāṇa_ within the next three months. During that earthquake, strong winds blew from all four sides, comets appeared in all four directions, and houses and walls crumbled and were destroyed.
10. “Furthermore, Ānanda, I have visited measureless hundreds of thousands of warrior assemblies. I sat and conversed with them, which pleased their minds. Once I was seated with them and settled, my appearance was like their appearance. My voice sounded like their voices. My manner and customs were like their manner and customs. If they asked about a subject, my answer was about that subject.
11. “Furthermore, I taught them the Dharma, encouraging, rousing, and making them rejoice. After teaching them Dharma using measureless methods and encouraging, rousing, and making them rejoice, I then disappeared from the place. After I disappeared, they didn’t know whether I was human or non-human. Ānanda, that’s how amazing and extraordinary the virtues and unprecedented qualities accomplished by the Tathāgata, the Arhat, and Completely Awakened One are. _So it was with the brahmin, householder, and ascetic assemblies._
12. “Ānanda, I’ve visited measureless hundreds of thousands of assemblies in the Heaven of the Four Kings. I sat and conversed with them, which pleased their minds. Once I was seated with them and settled, my appearance was like their appearance. My voice sounded like their voices. My manner and customs were like their manner and customs. If they asked about a subject, my answer was about that subject.
13. “Furthermore, I taught them the Dharma, encouraging, rousing, and making them rejoice. After teaching them Dharma using measureless methods and encouraging, rousing, and making them rejoice, I then disappeared from the place. After I disappeared, they didn’t know whether I was a god or something other than a god. Ānanda, that’s how amazing and extraordinary the virtues and unprecedented qualities accomplished by the Tathāgata, the Arhat, and Completely Awakened One are. _So it was with the Trāyastriṃśa Gods, Yama Gods, Tuṣita Gods, Nirmāṇarati Gods, Paranirmāṇarati Gods, Brahmakāyika Gods, Brahmapurohita Gods, Parīttābha Gods, Apramāṇābha Gods, Ābhāsvara Gods, Parīttaśubha Gods, Apramāṇaśubha Gods, Śubhakṛtsna Gods, Cloudless Gods, Receiving Merit Gods, Bṛhatphala Gods, Avṛha Gods, Atapa Gods, Sudarśani Gods, and Sudarśana Gods._
14. “Ānanda, I’ve visited measureless hundreds of thousands of assemblies in the Akaniṣṭha Heaven. I sat and conversed with them, which pleased their minds. Once I was seated with them and settled, my appearance was like their appearance. My voice sounded like their voices. My manner and customs were like their manner and customs. If they asked about a subject, my answer was about that subject.
15. “Furthermore, I taught them the Dharma, encouraging, rousing, and making them rejoice. After teaching them Dharma using measureless methods and encouraging, rousing, and making them rejoice, I then disappeared from the place. After I disappeared, they didn’t know whether I was a god or something other than a god. Ānanda, that’s how amazing and extraordinary the virtues and unprecedented qualities accomplished by the Tathāgata, the Arhat, and Completely Awakened One are.”
16. This is what the Buddha said. Venerable Ānanda and the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved. ^ma36note01-ref ^ma36note02-ref ^ma36note03-ref ^ma36note04-ref ^ma36note05-ref

### Notes

^ma36note01
1. For the source text, cf. [T26.1.477b23-8b12]. Direct parallels include [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN8/AN8.70]] and [[EĀ42.5]].
    
    This _sūtra_ both here and in AN appears to be an excerpt lifted from the Parinirvāṇa Sūtra and made into an independent text. Or, perhaps, it was incorporated into the same and later elements of the story there found its way back into these smaller _sūtra_s. Whichever is the case, the backstory of the Buddha attempting to give a hint to Ānanda to request that he remain in the world and Māra’s successful request for the Buddha to _parinirvāṇa_ is included in [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN8/AN8.70]]. That introduction is not included here in MĀ 36, but it’s placed in the same context when Ānanda becomes upset upon realizing that the cause for the earthquake was the Buddha choosing to _parinirvāṇa_.
    
    [[EĀ42.5]], on the other hand, lacks any context that would place it in the narrative of the Parinirvāṇa Sūtra. Ānanda is not the intercutor, and the discourse occurs in the default location of Śrāvastī. The Buddha simply gives the monks a lecture defining the causes of earthquakes.
    
    Beyond that, the other major difference is that this version only details three reasons for a great earthquake, whereas [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN8/AN8.70]] and [[EĀ42.5]] present the well-known list of eight reasons.

^ma36note02
2. _to a city called *Mahī in the country of Vajrā_. C. 金剛國，城名曰地. Both of these placenames have been trans. to C. The first is straightforward: 金剛 (“diamond”) is a well-known trans. of S. _vajra_ (G. _vayira_, P. _vajira_). As a placename, there was a city named Vajirā in Pali sources like the Mahāvamsa and Buddhavamsa. Here, it was apparently the name for a region, though its exact identity is unclear to me. The name of the city referenced here was trans. as 地 (“earth”). My guess is that it perhaps trans. something like _mahī_. Normally, it was the name of a major river in India that lit. means “earth.” Perhaps there was a city or town that bore the same name. 

[↩︎](#^ma36note02-ref)

^ma36note03
3. _there was a great earthquake … walls crumbled and were destroyed._ C. 彼地大動。地大動時，四面大風起，四方彗星出，屋舍牆壁皆崩壞盡, P. _mahābhūmicālo ahosi bhiṁsanako salomahaṁso, devadundubhiyo ca phaliṁsu_. This lengthy description will be repeated quite often. In [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN8/AN8.70]], it’s described more simply: “there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky” (Sujato). The reference here to comets might actually describe lights in the sky that sometimes coincide with seismic events. 

[↩︎](#^ma36note03-ref)

^ma36note04
4. This version gives only three reasons for a great earthquake: The geological reason of the earth being disturbed by the water beneath it, a powerful monk or god using their spiritual powers, or when a Buddha decides to _parinirvāṇa_.
    
    [[AN8.70]] agrees with the first two items, then adds: when a _bodhisattva_ is conceived on Earth, when a _bodhisattva_ is born, when a Buddha realizes completely awakening, and when a Buddha first sets the Dhamma wheel in motion. The seventh reason agrees with the third here in MĀ 36: When a Buddha surrenders his life force. The eighth and last reason in [[AN8.70]] is when a Buddha actually _parinirvāṇa_s. It’s not difficult to imagine that MĀ 36 might represent an older list that has been expanded given that the agreement between the two lists is in the initial and final items, and many of the additions appear drawn from a source like the story of Bodhisatta Vipassī from DN 14.

^ma36note05
5. What follows is not included in [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN8/AN8.70]], which ends with the list of causes of earthquakes. It would seem that this _sūtra_ is a direct excerpt from this tradition’s Parinirvāṇa Sutra.
