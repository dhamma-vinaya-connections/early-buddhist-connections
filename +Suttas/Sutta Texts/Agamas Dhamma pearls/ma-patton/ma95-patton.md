## Chapter 8: Defilement

95. Abiding in Qualities
1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma95note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I’ll discuss retreating from skillful qualities and not abiding in or increasing them. I’ll discuss abiding in skillful qualities and not retreating from or increasing them. I’ll also discuss increasing skillful qualities and not retreating from or abiding in them.[2](#^ma95note02)
3. “How does one retreat from skillful qualities and not abide in or increase them? Suppose a monk has faith, precepts, learning, generosity, wisdom, eloquence, scriptures, and his attainments.[3](#^ma95note03) That man retreats from these qualities and doesn’t abide in or increase them. This is called retreating from skillful qualities and not abiding in or increasing them.
4. “How does one abide in skillful qualities and not retreat from or increase them? Suppose a monk has faith, precepts, learning, generosity, wisdom, eloquence, scriptures, and his attainments. That man abides in these qualities and doesn’t retreat from or increase them. This is called abiding in skillful qualities and not retreating from or increasing them.
5. “How does one increase skillful qualities and not retreat from or abide in them? Suppose a monk has faith, precepts, learning, generosity, wisdom, eloquence, scriptures, and his attainments. That man increases these qualities and doesn’t retreat from or abide in them. This is called increasing skillful qualities and not retreating from or abiding in them.
6. “A monk who performs this examination will surely gain much from it: ‘Do I often act covetous, or do I often act without covetousness?’ ‘Do I often act hateful, or do I often act without hatefulness?’ ‘Do I often act ensnared in drowiness, or do I often act without drowiness?’ ‘Do I often act haughty, or do I often act without haughtiness?’ ‘Do I often act uncertainly or do I often act without uncertainty?’ ‘Do I often act violent, or do I often act without violence?’ ‘Do I often act with defiled thoughts, or do I often act without defiled thoughts?’ ‘Do I often act faithfully, or do I often act unfaithfully?’ ‘Do I often act energetically, or do I often act lazily?’ ‘Do I often act mindfully, or do I often act unmindfully?’ ‘Do I often act settled, or do I often act unsettled?’ ‘Do I often act with poor wisdom, or do I often act without poor wisdom?’[4](#^ma95note04)
7. “Suppose that when he contemplates this, a monk knows, ‘I often practice with covetousness … with hatefulness … with drowsiness … with haughtiness … with uncertainly … with violence … with defiled thoughts … with unfaithfulness … with laziness … without mindfulness … with unsettledness … often practice with poor wisdom.’ Wanting to cease these bad and unskillful things, that monk will quickly pursue the methods to do that. He trains with utmost diligence, right mindfulness, and right knowledge and patiently doesn’t let himself regress. He’s like a man with his hair or clothes on fire who instantly seeks to put them out. Thus is this monk who wants to cease these bad and unskillful things and quickly pursues the method to do that. He trains with utmost diligence, right mindfulness, and right knowledge and patiently doesn’t let himself regress.
8. “Suppose that when he contemplates this, a monk knows, ‘I often practice without covetousness … without hatefulness … without drowsiness … without haughtiness … without uncertainty … without violence … without defiled thoughts … with faithfulness … with energy … with mindfulness … with settledness … often practice without poor wisdom.’ Wanting to abide in these skillful qualities and not forget or retreat from cultivating and disseminating them, that monk quickly seeks the method to do that. He trains with utmost diligence, right mindfulness, and right knowledge and patiently doesn’t let himself regress. He’s like a man with his hair or clothes on fire who instantly seeks to put them out. Thus, Venerables, is this monk who wants to abide in these skillful qualities and not forget or retreat from cultivating and disseminating them. He quickly seeks the method to do that. He trains with utmost diligence, right mindfulness, and right knowledge and patiently doesn’t let himself regress.”
9. This is what the Buddha said. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

^ma95note01
1. For the source text, cf. [T26.1.577b2-c13]. It’s parallel with [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.53]]. These two texts are quite similar to [MĀ 96](MA_096.html) and [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.55]]. 

[↩︎](#^ma95note01-ref)

^ma95note02
2. _discuss_. C. 說, P. _vaṇṇayāmi_. In [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.53]], the Buddha says he doesn’t praise abiding or retreating, but only growth in skillful qualities, whereas here he simply announces three topics that he’ll discuss for the monks. The C. could well translate the same word as the P. because _vaṇṇayāmi_ can mean “comment on, interpret, explain” or “praise, extol.” [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.53]] indicates the latter reading by negating the verb for the undesireable topics. This looks like an example of a single word being interpreted differently by separate traditions or dialects and the context being shaped to accomodate the chosen reading.
    
    _in skillful qualities_. While the C. could be read as “good Dharma,” [[AN10.53]] reads _kusalesu dhammesu_, which is in the plural locative case. The list of character traits that will follows also confirms that this is the correct reading.

^ma95note03
3. _faith, precepts, learning, generosity, wisdom, and eloquence, scriptures, and his attainments_. C. 篤信、禁戒、博聞、布施、智慧、辯才、阿含、及其所得, P. _saddhā sīla suta cāga paññā paṭibhāna_. This C. list is the same set of skillful qualities given in the definition of “knowing oneself” in [MĀ 1](MA_001.html). The list found in [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.53]] is “faith, ethics, generosity, wisdom, and eloquence,” and [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN7/AN7.68]] is the same except for the addition of “learning.” In general, the MĀ parallels have added two items: “scriptures” (_āgama_) and “attainments.”

4. Cf. the corresponding passage in [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.53]]: “_abhijjhālu bahulaṁ viharāmi, byāpannacitto bahulaṁ viharāmi, thinamiddhapariyuṭṭhito bahulaṁ viharāmi, uddhato bahulaṁ viharāmi, vicikiccho bahulaṁ viharāmi, kodhano bahulaṁ viharāmi, saṅkiliṭṭhacitto bahulaṁ viharāmi, sāraddhakāyo bahulaṁ viharāmi, kusīto bahulaṁ viharāmi, asamāhito bahulaṁ viharāmī’ti, tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā tesaṁyeva pāpakānaṁ akusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ pahānāya adhimatto chando ca vāyāmo ca ussāho ca ussoḷhī ca appaṭivānī ca sati ca sampajaññañca karaṇīyaṁ._” This same list is also found in [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.51]]. This version of the list here in MĀ 95 is repeated in [MĀ 96](MA_096.html) and [110](MA_110.html). Similar lists are also found in MĀ 91 and 104. Below are my notes for each term in the list:
    
    _covetous_. C. 增伺, G. _avhij̄a_?, P. _abhijjhālu_, S. _abhidhyālu_. The C. translates S. _abhi-_ (增) and _-dhyā_ (伺) separately. The resulting expression means something like “increasing search.” The P. (and S.) word means “covetous.” The S. root _dhyā_ had the basic meaning of “thinking,” hence the derivation of _dhyāna_ for “meditation.” Here, it refers to thinking often of something desired.
    
    _hateful_. C. 瞋恚心, G. ?, P. _byāpannacitta_, S. _vyāpannacitta_. The C. lit. means “hateful thought,” which matches the reading of P. _byāpanna_ better than S. _vyāpanna_, though S. _vyāpannacitta_ was used to mean “maliciousness.”
    
    _ensnared by drowsiness_. C. 睡眠纏, G. _stinamidha_, P. _thinamiddhapariyuṭṭhita_, S. _styānamiddhaparyavasthita_. The C. translation lit. means “wrapped up” or “fettered by sleepiness.” The reading of S. _paryavasthāna_ (syn. with _paryavasthita_) was apparently sometimes trans. to Tibetan as “complete wrapping up, ensnaring,” which agrees with 纏.
    
    _haughty_. C. 調貢高, G. _udhida_, P. _uddhata_, S. _uddhata_. This term occurs in five other MĀ _sūtra_s (15, 16, 91, 95, and 96), making it unlikely to be a typo. There is an alternate reading that changes 調 to 掉, which is a case of amending an older translation with a later one. 掉 has the meaning of “shaking, swinging, rocking,” which probably was intended to describe physical restlessness.
    
    調 is a term that occurs in parallel to P. _uddhacca_ or _uddhata_ in MĀ, but it doesn’t mean agitation. Its usual meaning is “to even out, harmonize, check over, tune.” A lesser known meaning was “to ridicule, make fun of” (cf. Gakken 1227). In MĀ, this term often occurs in tandem with 貢高, which means “haughty, arrogant,” and this is indeed a reading of S. _uddhata_. It’s treated by P. references and translators as a variant spelling of _uddhacca_ and translated as “agitated,” but here we see that it was interpreted as arrogance. This may well be a case of excessive leveling in P. sources, which served to eliminate variant readings by forcing standard meanings onto them.
    
    _uncertain_. C. 疑惑, G. _vicigitsa_, P. _vicikiccha_, S. _vicikitsā_. The C. translation lit. means “doubt and confusion, perplexity.”
    
    _violent_. C. 身諍, G. _krosana_, P. _kodhana_, S. _krodhana_. The C. translation lit. means “physical” or “personal quarrel,” which doesn’t match P. _kodhana_. However, P. _sāraddhakāya_ occurs below in the place of “faith” in the P. list, which does mean physical violence or anger. I think that is likely the term that was translated here as 身諍.
    
    _defiled thoughts_. C. 穢污心, G. , P. _saṅkiliṭṭhacitta_, S. _saṃkliṣṭacitta_. The C. translation means “defiled thought.” Lit. 穢污 refers to heavy soiling or filthiness, involving disgusting substances such as dirt, excrement, or rotten food.
    
    _faithful_. C. 信, G. ?, P. _sāraddhakāya_, S. _saṃrabdhakāya_. The C. here translates a different word than that found in [[AN10.51]], probably P. _saddhā_, S. _śraddhā_. It’s of interest to note the phonetic similarity between P. _saddhā_ and _sāraddha_. There might have been some sort of corruption that took place, but the P. word appears to occur earlier in the C. list as 身諍.
    
    _energetically … lazily_. C. 精進⋯懈怠, G. _kusida … aradhaviriya_, P. _kusīta … āraddhavīriya_, S. _kusīda … ārabdhavīrya_. The C. translation reverses the order of these two items, putting the positive one first. This will continue for a couple more items before the list returns to defiled states.
    
    _mindful_. C. 念. This item is not in the [[AN10.51]] list.
    
    _settled_. C. 定, G. _samahida_, P. _samāhita_, S. _samāhita_. The C. translation is the same as the standard one for P/S. _samādhi_, indicating that the terms were considered equivalent. It’s probably significant, though, that _samādhi_ is not the word chosen here, given the setting here is outside of meditation. My translation is along the lines of “composed, settled, stablized” that is common to both 定 and _samāhita_. Another possibility would be “decided” and “undecided.”
    
    _poor wisdom_. C. 惡慧. This term does not occur in [[AN10.51]]’s list. It might translate a word like S. _dusprajñā_, which lit. means “bad wisdom.” In practice, it referred to someone lacking the intellect to become wise (i.e., “stupid” or “dull-witted”).
