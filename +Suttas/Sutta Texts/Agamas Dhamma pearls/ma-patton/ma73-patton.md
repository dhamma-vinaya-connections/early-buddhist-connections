### 73. The Gods

1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma73note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to Cedi and stayed at Waterside Grove. ^ma73note01-ref

#### 1. Purifying Knowledge and Vision

2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Before I had awakened to the unsurpassed and correct awakening, I had the thought, ‘I’d like to be able to produce their light. As a result of their light, I’ll see shapes and forms. Thus, my knowledge and vision will be fully and radiantly purified.’

3. “In order for knowledge and vision to be fully and radiantly purified, I lived alone in seclusion, my mind wasn’t careless, and I cultivated diligence. As a result of living alone in seclusion, not being careless, and cultivating diligence, I apprehended light and then saw forms. That was before I had met with those gods, before we exchanged greetings, before any conversation, and before any reply.

#### 2. Meeting and Conversing with Gods

4. “Again, I thought, ‘I’d like to be able to produce their light. As a result of their light, then I’ll see shapes and forms. I’ll also meet with those gods, exchange greetings, and have some conversation and receive replies from them. Thus, my knowledge and vision will be fully and radiantly purified.’

5. “In order for knowledge and vision to be fully and radiantly purified, I lived alone in seclusion, my mind wasn’t careless, and I cultivated diligence. As a result of living alone in seclusion, not being careless, and cultivating diligence, I apprehended light and then saw forms. I also met with those gods, exchanged greetings, and had some conversation and received some replies from them. Still, I didn’t know about the clans, names, or births of those gods.

#### 3. The Names and Births of Gods

6. “Again, I thought, ‘I’d like to be able to produce their light. As a result of their light, then I’ll see shapes and forms. I’ll meet with those gods, exchange greetings, and have some conversation and receive some replies from them. I’ll also know about the clans, names, or births of those gods. Thus, my knowledge and vision will be fully and radiantly purified.’

I met with those gods, exchanged greetings, and had some conversation and received some replies from them. I also knew about the clans, names, or births of those gods.

I also knew about their food and the pains and pleasures experienced by those gods. Still, I didn’t know about the life spans, durations, or the ends of those gods’ lives.

#### 5. The Life Spans of Gods

10. “Again, I thought, ‘I’d like to be able to produce their light. As a result of their light, then I’ll see shapes and forms.

#### Conclusion

18. “If I didn’t rightly know and apprehend these eight practices, then I couldn’t thoroughly declare their attainment. I wouldn’t know that I had awakened to the unsurpassed and correct awakening, nor could I have gone beyond this world’s gods, Māra, Brahmā, ascetics, and priests. I wouldn’t have been liberated by various liberations. I wasn’t yet free from delusions. I also wouldn’t have truly known: ‘Birth has been ended, the religious practice has been established, the task has been accomplished, and I will not again be subject to existence.’

19. “If I rightly knew and attained these eight practices, then I could thoroughly declare their attainment. I knew I had awakened to the unsurpassed and correct awakening. I had gone beyond this world’s gods, Māra, Brahmā, ascetics, and priests. I was liberated by various liberations. My mind was free of delusions. I also truly knew: ‘Birth has been ended, the religious practice has been established, the task has been accomplished, and I will not again be subject to existence.’”

20. This is what the Buddha said. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
