## Chapter 11: The Greats

137. The World
1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma137note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “The Tathāgata himself has discovered the world and teaches it for others. The Tathāgata knows the world. The Tathāgata himself has discovered the formation of the world and teaches it for others. The Tathāgata has ended the formation of the world. The Tathāgata himself has discovered the cessation of the world and teaches it for others. The Tathāgata has realized the cessation of the world. The Tathāgata himself has discovered the way of the world and teaches it for others. The Tathāgata has cultivated the way of the world.[2](#^ma137note02) Whatever there is that’s entirely correct, the Tathāgata has known, seen, realized, and obtained it all. Why is that?
3. “During the time between the night that he realized the unsurpassed, correct, and complete awakening until the day that he will choose to completely cease in the realm of remainderless _nirvāṇa_, the Tathāgata has spoken words and given responses that are all the truth. They aren’t false, don’t depart from what is, and aren’t mistaken. They’re true, they bear out, and they’re genuine. If anyone is described as a lion, they are being described like the Tathāgata. Why is that?
4. “The lectures that the Tathāgata gives to the assembly are called a lion’s roar. Of the whole world with its gods, Māra, and Brahmā, ascetics and priests from humans to the heavens, the Tathāgata is the one who is sacred.[3](#^ma137note03) The Tathāgata is cooled. He has no affliction and no fever. He is genuine and not false.”[4](#^ma137note04)
5. Thereupon, the Bhagavān spoke these verses:
- “Knowing the whole world    
    And leaving the whole world,    
    The Buddha explains the whole world,    
    All the world as it really is.[5](#^ma137note05)
- He is the supreme hero sage    
    Who has been freed from all fetters.[6](#^ma137note06)    
    He has brought all deeds to an end[7](#^ma137note07)    
    And is freed from all birth and death.
- The gods and also the human beings    
    Who have taken refuge in the Buddha[8](#^ma137note08)    
    Bow their heads down to the Tathāgata,    
    Who is the deepest and greatest of seas.
- Having known him and cultivated respect,    
    There are gods and _gandharva_ spirits    
    Who also bowed their heads to the Buddha    
    And continue to follow him in death.
- Bowing their heads down before that wise man,    
    They take refuge in the best of humans.    
    Without sorrow or dust and at peace,    
    Nothing obstructs their liberations.
- Thus, they always enjoy meditation,    
    While living aloof and fully settled.    
    They themselves have realized insight.    
    Without me, they would’ve missed their chance.    
    Those who missed it are aggrieved,    
    When they fall down into hell.”
6. This is what the Buddha said. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved. ^ma137note01-ref ^ma137note02-ref ^ma137note03-ref ^ma137note04-ref ^ma137note05-ref ^ma137note06-ref ^ma137note07-ref ^ma137note08-ref

### Notes

^ma137note01
1. For the source text, cf. [T26.1.645b9-c13]. It’s parallel with [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN4/AN4.23]] and [Iti 112]. Both of the Pali parallels are identical with each other aside from a couple formatting differences.  
    The beginning of this _sūtra_ is essentially the same as the Pali version. It applies an analysis very similar to that applied to suffering in the Turning the Dharma Wheel Sūtra (cf. [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/SN Bodhi 5/SN45-56/SN56/SN56.11]] and [[SĀ4.1]](../samyukta/04/SA4_1.html)). After that introduction, there is more variation between this text and the P. parallels, but the basic points are the same. Both this and the Pali version end with seven stanzas of verse, and they overlap strikingly in about two or three verses of this material. Overall, however, the degree of divergence suggests that both versions have had verses added to expand an originally shorter summary in different ways.

^ma137note02
2. _The Tathagata himself has discovered the world … way of the world._ C. 如來自覺世間，亦為他說。如來知世間。如來自覺世間習，亦為他說。如來斷世間習。如來自覺世間滅，亦為他說。如來世間滅作證。如來自覺世間道跡，亦為他說。如來修世間道跡. P. _Loko, bhikkhave, tathāgatena abhisambuddho. Lokasmā tathāgato visaṁyutto. Lokasamudayo, bhikkhave, tathāgatena abhisambuddho. Lokasamudayo tathāgatassa pahīno. Lokanirodho, bhikkhave, tathāgatena abhisambuddho. Lokanirodho tathāgatassa sacchikato. Lokanirodhagāminī paṭipadā, bhikkhave, tathāgatena abhisambuddhā. Lokanirodhagāminī paṭipadā tathāgatassa bhāvitā._  
    These passages both present something very similar to what is found in [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/SN Bodhi 5/SN45-56/SN56/SN56.11]] and [[SĀ4.1]], but here the format is more succinct. There are a few differences to note:
    
    - Here in MĀ 137, the Buddha describes these four insights as “self discovered” (自覺 ≈ _abhisambuddha_) and “taught for others” (missing from P.).
    - [[AN4.23]] says that the Tathāgata is “detached” from the world instead of “knows” it (_visaṁyutta_ ≠ 知).
    - MĀ 137 doesn’t specify that the “way of the world” (世間道跡) leads to its cessation, but the P. version does (_lokanirodhagāminī paṭipadā_).
    
    Thus, both versions depart from the templates of [[SN56.11]] and [[SĀ4.1]] in a couple minor ways.

^ma137note03
3. _the Tathāgata is the one who is sacred … not false._ C. 如來是梵有。如來至冷有。無煩亦無熱。真諦、不虛有. I’ve chosen to translate 梵 (S. _brāhma_) as an adj. here since it would make little sense for the Buddha to call himself the god Brahmā. The verb 有 (“to exist, possess”) appended to the end of this and the following phrases appears to be a lit. trans. of Indic grammar. It likely translated S. _bhavati_ (G. _bhodi_, P. _hoti_), which functioned as a copular verb here.

^ma137note04
4. This prose section generally agrees with [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN4/AN4.23]] in its content, but it isn’t organized as a list of reasons why the Buddha is called a Tathāgata. Instead, it simply praises his teaching as true and beyond the ken of other teachers.

^ma137note05
5. Compare this with verse 1 in [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN4/AN4.23]]: _Sabbaṁ lokaṁ abhiññāya, sabbaṁ loke yathātathaṁ; Sabbaṁ lokaṁ visaṁyutto, sabbaloke anūpayo._ 

[↩︎](#^ma137note05-ref)

^ma137note06
6. Compare this first couplet with the first couplet of verse 2 in [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN4/AN4.23]]: _Sa ve sabbābhibhū dhīro, sabbaganthappamocano._ 

[↩︎](#^ma137note06-ref)

^ma137note07
7. Compare this third line with the third line of verse 3 in [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN4/AN4.23]]: _Sabbakammakkhayaṁ patto._ 

[↩︎](#^ma137note07-ref)

^ma137note08
8. Compare this couplet with the first couplet of verse 5 in [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN4/AN4.23]]: _Iti devā manussā ca, ye buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gatā._
