## Chapter 4: Unprecedented Things

34. Bakula
1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma34note01) One time not long after the Buddha’s _parinirvāṇa_, Venerable Bakula traveled to Rājagṛha and was staying at the Squirrels’ Park in the Bamboo Grove.
2. At the time, there was a heretic who had been a good friend of Venerable Bakula before the latter had left home.[2](#^ma34note02) He visited Venerable Bakula then while out for a walk in the afternoon. After they had exchanged greetings, that man of another training withdrew to sit at one side and said, “Venerable Bakula, I would like to ask a question if you would permit me.”
Venerable Bakula replied, “Heretic, go ahead and ask your question. I will consider it once I hear it.”
3. The heretic asked, “Venerable Bakula, how long have you been training on the path in this correct Dharma and Vinaya?”
Venerable Bakula replied, “Heretic, I have been training on the path in this correct Dharma and Vinaya for eighty years now.”
4. The heretic then asked, “Venerable Bakula, you have been training on the path in this correct Dharma and Vinaya for eighty years now. Do you recall having engaged in a sex act?”
Venerable Bakula said to him, “You shouldn’t ask that. Ask about something else, such as: ‘Venerable Bakula, you have been training on the path in this correct Dharma and Vinaya for eighty years now. Do you recall having had notions of desire occur to you?’ Heretic, this is what you should ask.”
5. That heretic said, “Now, I’ll ask again: Venerable Bakula, you have been training on the path in this correct Dharma and Vinaya for eighty years now. Do you recall having had notions of desire occur to you?”
6. As a result of this heretic’s question, Venerable Bakula then said to the monks, “Gentlemen, I have been training on the path in this correct Dharma and Vinaya for eighty years now. I do not have any notions at all of pride that have arisen because of that.” _This is what Venerable Bakula said. This is called an unprecedented quality of Venerable Bakula._[3](#^ma34note03)
7. Furthermore, Venerable Bakula said, “Gentlemen, during these eighty years I have been training on the path in this correct Dharma and Vinaya, I have yet to have a notion of desire.”[4](#^ma34note04) _This is what Venerable Bakula said. This is called an unprecedented quality of Venerable Bakula._
8. Furthermore, Venerable Bakula said, “Gentlemen, I’ve worn robes made of discarded clothes for eighty years now. I do not have any notions at all of pride that have arisen because of that.” _This is what Venerable Bakula said. This is called an unprecedented quality of Venerable Bakula._
9. Furthermore, Venerable Bakula said, “Gentlemen, I’ve worn robes made of discarded clothes for eighty years now. I don’t recall ever accepting laypeople’s clothes … ever cutting and making robes … ever employing other monks to make robes … ever using a needle to sew robes … ever carrying a sowing kit … even a single thread.”[5](#^ma34note05) _This is what Venerable Bakula said. This is called an unprecedented quality of Venerable Bakula._
10. Furthermore, Venerable Bakula said, “Gentlemen, I’ve solicited alms for eighty years now. I do not have any notions at all of pride that have arisen because of that.” _This is what Venerable Bakula said. This is called an unprecedented quality of Venerable Bakula._
11. Furthermore, Venerable Bakula said, “Gentlemen, I’ve solicited alms for eighty years now. I don’t recall ever accepting invitations from householders … ever passing on soliciting alms … ever soliciting alms from great households to get food that’s pure, excellent, wonderful, and abundant to eat and digest … ever looking at a woman’s face … ever entering a nun’s quarters … ever exchanging greetings with a nun … even having a conversation with one on the road.”[6](#^ma34note06) _This is what Venerable Bakula said. This is called an unprecedented quality of Venerable Bakula._
12. Furthermore, Venerable Bakula said this, “Gentlemen, I’ve been training on the path in this correct Dharma and Vinaya for eighty years now. I don’t recall ever taking care of a novice … ever teaching Dharma for laypeople … even reciting a four-line verse for them.”[7](#^ma34note07) _This is what Venerable Bakula said. This is called an unprecedented quality of Venerable Bakula._
13. Furthermore, Venerable Bakula said, “Gentlemen, I’ve been training on the path in this correct Dharma and Vinaya for eighty years now. I’ve never had an illness … even a headache that lasted as long as a finger snap. I don’t recall ever taking medicine … even a single piece of yellow myrobalan fruit.”[8](#^ma34note08) _This is what Venerable Bakula said. This is called an unprecedented quality of Venerable Bakula._
14. Furthermore, Venerable Bakula said, “Gentlemen, for eighty years now, I have sat cross-legged without ever leaning against a wall or a tree.”[9](#^ma34note09) _This is what Venerable Bakula said. This is called an unprecedented quality of Venerable Bakula._
15. Furthermore, Venerable Bakula said, “Gentlemen, I realized the three masteries in three days and nights.”[10](#^ma34note10) _This is what Venerable Bakula said. This is called an unprecedented quality of Venerable Bakula._
16. Furthermore, Venerable Bakula said, “Gentlemen, I’ll be seated cross-legged when I _parinirvāṇa_.” Venerable Bakula then entered _parinirvāṇa_ while sitting cross-legged. _Venerable Bakula entered _parinirvāṇa_ while sitting cross-legged. This is called an unprecedented quality of Venerable Bakula._
17. This is what Venerable Bakula said. When that heretic and the monks heard what he taught, they rejoiced and approved. ^ma34note01-ref ^ma34note02-ref ^ma34note03-ref ^ma34note04-ref ^ma34note05-ref ^ma34note06-ref ^ma34note07-ref ^ma34note08-ref ^ma34note09-ref ^ma34note10-ref

### Notes

^ma34note01
1. For the source text, cf. [T26.1.475a11-c15]. The only known parallel is [MN 124].
    
    While the introduction here indicates that these events occurred shortly after the Buddha’s _parinirvāṇa_, MN 124 is silent on this point. Bhikkhu Bodhi reports that the commentary to MN 124 says that it was added to the canon a hundred years after the Buddha. This might explain the interlinear commentary declaring Bākula’s unprecedented qualities. The Buddha wasn’t present to declare it himself, so the compilers added their own declaration. 

[↩︎](#^ma34note01-ref)

^ma34note02
2. _a heretic who had been a good friend of Venerable Bakula._ Bakula’s interlocutor goes nameless throughout this _sūtra_. He is called “[someone of] another training” or “a heterodox [person]” 異學, which I take to be a translation of S. _tīrthika_. This was an epithet that seems to usually apply to adherents of other ascetic traditions. In MN 124, he is identified as the naked ascetic Kassapa. 

[↩︎](#^ma34note02-ref)

^ma34note03
3. _This is called an unprecedented quality of Venerable Bakula._ According to the Pali commentary to MN 124, this statement is the voice of the compilers of the canon during the second council a hundred years after the Buddha’s _parinirvāṇa_. Here in this version, it’s clear that there is a change in speaker because Bakula is spoken of in the third person. I’ve therefore set it off in italics as a comment by the narrator.
    
    This statement by Bakula that he had no pride about his virtue is repeated twice more below. These additional statements are not found in MN 124. 

[↩︎](#^ma34note03-ref)

^ma34note04
4. MN 124 adds the lack of notions of ill-will (P. _byāpādasañña_), cruelty (_vihiṁsāsañña_), and thoughts (_vitakka_) of desire, ill-will, and cruelty after this virtue. 

[↩︎](#^ma34note04-ref)

^ma34note05
5. MN 124 begins with the same two items in this section, and then continues with dyeing robes, sewing robes during the robe-making ceremony, and wandering in search of material for another monk making robes. Despite their differences, both versions arrive at six robe-related virtues. 

[↩︎](#^ma34note05-ref)

^ma34note06
6. This section combines items regarding soliciting alms and interacting with women. Here, there’s a total of seven items, while in MN 124 these two topics are covered by ten items. Strictly speaking, the two versions only share three items in common: Not accepting invitations, not having looked at a woman, and not having entered a nun’s quarters. 

[↩︎](#^ma34note06-ref)

^ma34note07
7. This section of three items corresponds with seven items in MN 124. They only share the one item of not having had a novice. 

[↩︎](#^ma34note07-ref)

^ma34note08
8. This version and MN 124 share both of these items, but the illustration for the first differs between them. It should be noted that never being ill is the quality for which Bakula was famous in addition to being an hermit ascetic. See, e.g., passages in the Commentary to the Great Perfection of Wisdom @ [223c27], [238a5], and [271b18].
    
    _yellow myrobalan fruit._ C. 訶梨勒 (EMC. ha-lɪi-lək = Pr. _harilak[i]_?), P/S. _harītakī_. The C. translit. appears to be a Prakrit variant of the well-known S. _harītakī_, which was the name for the medicinal fruit of the yellow myrobalan tree in India. 

[↩︎](#^ma34note08-ref)

^ma34note09
9. MN 124 contains two items that correspond roughly to this section: Not leaning on a board or preparing a cot. 

[↩︎](#^ma34note09-ref)

^ma34note10
10. MN 124 has two single-item sections here: One is never having spent a rainy season in a village, and the second is being awakening on the eighth day after leaving home. After those two sections, the ascetic Kassapa receives ordination from Bakula, practices diligently, and becomes an _arhat_. None of these details are found here in MĀ 34.
