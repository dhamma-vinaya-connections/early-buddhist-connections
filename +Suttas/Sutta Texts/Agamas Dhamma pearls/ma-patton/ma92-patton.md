## Chapter 8: Defilement

92. The Analogy of the Blue and White Lotus Flowers
1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^ma92note01) One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Some things are ceased physically but not verbally. Some things are ceased verbally but not physically. Some things are not ceased physically or verbally but only by seeing wisely.
3. “What is something that’s ceased physically but not verbally? [Suppose] a monk has consummated some unskillful physical conduct and fully accepts it. He is attached to this physicality. The monks who see this rebuke that monk: ‘Venerable, you’ve consummated unskillful physical conduct and fully accept it. How can you be attached to this physicality? Venerable, you can abandon that unskillful physical conduct and train in skillful physical conduct.’ Some time later, he abandons his unskillful physical conduct and trains in skillful physical conduct. This is said to be something that’s ceased physically but not verbally.
4. “What is something that’s ceased verbally but not physically? [Suppose] a monk has consummated unskillful verbal conduct and fully accepts it. He is attached to that speech. The monks who see this rebuke that monk: ‘Venerable, you’ve consummated unskillful verbal conduct and fully accept it. How can you be attached to this speech? Venerable, you can abandon this unskillful verbal conduct and train in skillful verbal conduct.’ Some time later, he abandons his unskillful verbal conduct and trains in skillful verbal conduct. This is said to be something that’s ceased verbally but not physically.
5. “What is something that’s not ceased physically or verbally but only by seeing wisely? Longing is not ceased physically or verbally but only by seeing wisely. Thus, contentiousness … malice … fits of rage … not admitting [other’s virtues] … fixation … stinginess … jealousy … deception … fraud … lack of modesty … lack of conscience … bad desires … bad views[2](#^ma92note02) aren’t ceased physically or verbally but only by seeing wisely. This is said to be something that isn’t ceased physically or verbally but only by seeing wisely.
6. “The Tathāgata might have an observation while examining another person’s mind and know, ‘This person hasn’t cultivated themselves, the precepts, their mind, or wisdom in such a way that they could cease their longing. Why is that? Because bad longings arise in this person’s mind and remain there.’ Thus … contentiousness … malice … fits of rage … not admitting [other’s virtues] … fixation … stinginess … jealousy … deception … fraud … lack of modesty … lack of conscience … ‘they could cease their bad desires and bad views. Why is that? Because bad desires and bad views arise in this person’s mind and remain there.’
7. “He might know, ‘This person has cultivated himself, the precepts, their mind, and their wisdom in such a way that they have ceased longing. Why is that? Because bad longings don’t arise in this person’s mind and remain there.’ Thus … contentiousness … malice … fits of rage … not admitting [other’s virtues] … fixation … stinginess … jealousy … deception … fraud … lack of modesty … lack of conscience … ‘they’ve ceased their bad desires and bad views. Why is that? Because bad desires and bad views don’t arise in this person’s mind and remain there.’
8. “Take the example of a blue, red, or white lotus flower. It sprouts from water, grows in water, and rises out of the water, but no water clings to it. In this way, the Tathāgata is born from the world, grows in the world, and his practice leaves the world, but worldly ways don’t cling to him.[3](#^ma92note03) Why is that? The Tathāgata, the Arhat, and Completely Awakened One leaves the whole world.”
9. Venerable Ānanda was at the time attending to the Buddha with a fan. He then faced the Buddha with his palms together and said, “Bhagavān, what shall this _sūtra_ be called? How are we to maintain it?”
10. The Bhagavān thereupon told him, “Ānanda, the name of this _sūtra_ is ‘The Analogy of the Blue and White Lotus Flowers.’ You should maintain and recite it well in this way.”
11. The Bhagavān then told the monks, “All of you should together accept this _Analogy of the Blue and White Lotus Flowers Sūtra_, recite it, and preserve it. Why is that? This _Analogy of the Blue and White Lotus Flowers Sūtra_ has a meaning that accords with the Dharma. As the origin of the religious life, it brings about penetration, awakening, and _nirvāṇa_. If a clansman shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the reddish-brown robes, becomes a believer, and leaves home to train on the path in homelessness, he should accept this _Analogy of the Blue and White Lotus Flowers Sūtra_, recite it, and preserve it well.”
12. This is what the Buddha said. Venerable Ānanda and the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved. ^ma92note01-ref ^ma92note02-ref ^ma92note03-ref

### Notes

^ma92note01
1. For the source text, cf. [T26.1.574c1-5a18]. Its direct parallels are [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.23]] and [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/SN Bodhi 5/SN22-34/SN22/SN22.94]]. It shares the same initial sermon with [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.23]] but then concludes with the metaphor of the lotus flower that concludes [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/SN Bodhi 5/SN22-34/SN22/SN22.94]]. The list of defilements is closer to that found in [MN 40] and MĀ 183 than the one found in [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.23]]-24, but the two versions appear to be variants of the same list. See the notes below for more details on these points.

2. _Longing … contentiousness … malice … fits of rage … not admitting [other’s virtues] … fixation … stinginess … jealousy … deception … fraud … lack of modesty … lack of conscience … bad desires … bad views._ C. 增伺⋯諍訟⋯恚恨⋯瞋纏⋯不語⋯結⋯慳⋯嫉⋯欺誑⋯諛諂⋯無慙⋯無愧⋯惡欲⋯惡見. The separation of this list into fourteen items is based on the passages in MĀ 183 that treats each separately (see below).  
    A similar list of ten defilements is found at [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.23]]-24 that reads _lobha … dosa … moha … kodha … upanāha … makkha … paḷāsa … macchariya … pāpikā issā … pāpikā icchā_. A parallel set of twelve defilements is also found in MN 40: _abhijjhā … byāpāda … kodha … upanāha … makkha … paḷāsa … issā … macchariya … sāṭheyyā … māyā … pāpikā icchā … micchādiṭṭhi_. A parallel to this list occurs in MĀ 183: 貪伺⋯恚⋯瞋⋯不語⋯結⋯慳⋯嫉⋯諛諂⋯欺誑⋯無慙⋯無愧⋯惡欲⋯邪見. We can surmise, then, that there were at least three versions of this list of defilements, with some minor discrepancies in their different witnesses.  
    Many of the defilements in these lists were incorporated into the later Abhidharma rubric of “secondary afflictions” (S. _upakleśa_). These earlier _sūtra_ lists don’t show much direct influence from this Abhidharma rubric, given that they include major afflictions as well as secondary ones. The most distinctive feature of these lists in MĀ 92 and [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.23]]-24 is that they end with defilements described as 惡 (P. _pāpikā_, “bad”).  
    In MN 40 and MĀ 183, the last item was changed to wrong view (邪見, _micchādiṭṭhi_). MĀ 92 seems to represent an in-between stage of this change, having bad view (惡見, _pāpikādiṭṭhi_) as its last item. Its version of the list also begins the same as the MN version. Thus, MĀ 92 appears to be a hybrid of [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.23]] and MN 40 that contains the sermon in AN and a variant of the list of defilements in MN.  
    Deciphering the individual items in this list of defilements is helped by consulting MĀ 183 and MN 40, which represent two sectarian versions of the same. A few of the C. translations are overly literal or otherwise unclear. Below are notes about my translation of each:  
    _longing._ C. 增伺, P. _abhijjhā_, S. _abhidhyā_. The C. here is typically understood as a lit. trans. of _abhi-_ (增) and _-dhyā_ (伺), meaning “excessive searching.” The term is translated as 貪伺 in MĀ 183, and this passage has a variant reading that amends 增 to 貪. 貪伺 lit. means “greedy searching.” In either case, the intended reading would seem to be “intense desire” or “longing.”  
    _contentiousness._ C. 諍訟, P. _paḷāsa_, S. _pradāsa_. This defilement is otherwise missing from the other C. parallels. It seems likely to correspond to P. _paḷāsa_ or one of its synonyms. The C. lit. means “fighting, quarrelling.”  
    _malice._ C. 恚恨, P. _byāpāda_, S. _vyāpāda_. The C. lit. means “angry resentment.”  
    _fits of rage._ C. 瞋纏, P. _kodha_, S. _krodha_. The C. lit. means “wrapped in anger.” It’s possible the term here was S. _krodha paryavasthāna_, which meant “possessed by rage” (i.e., an episode of demonic possession). The term _paryavasthāna_, however, was sometimes interpreted to mean “wrapped up” or “ensnared” by both Chinese and Tibetan translators, as was the case here. I’ve translated it colloquilly as “fits of rage.”  
    _not admitting [other’s virtues]._ C. 不語, P. _makkha_?, S. _mrakṣa_?. This C. translation seems very strange, but there was apparently a reading of the S. verb _mrakṣayati_ as “speaking indistinctly or incorrectly.” In the P. tradition, _makkha_ has a lit. meaning of “smearing” or “dirtying” which is extended to refer to “disparaging” others, just as done in English. It was usu. a counterpart to _pradāsa_, meaning to “disparage” other people to minimize their good qualities. _Pradāsa_, on the other hand, is the concealment of one’s own faults. Together, they describe hypocrisy. My translation assumes the C. must refer to a reading like this, but it’s unclear.  
    _fixation._ C. 結, P. _upanāha_, S. _upanāha_. In the context of these defilements, _upanāha_ is understood to mean a binding enmity that someone is unable to relinquish for a long time. _Upanāha_ had other unrelated uses, however, because its lit. meaning was “a tie” or “binding.” Here, the C. translation reflected this lit. meaning, where 結 means “a tie” or “bondage.” I’ve translated it here as “fixation,” intending the meaning of someone who has an unhealthy obsession.  
    _stinginess._ C. 慳, P. _macchariya_, S. _mātsarya_. This and the next term are usually paired together to represent a type of selflish disregard or dislike of others. One is the unwillingness to be generous, and the other is dislike of another’s fortune.  
    _jealousy._ C. 嫉, P. _issā_, S. _īrṣyā_.  
    _deception._ C. 欺誑, P. _sāṭheyyā_, S. _śāṭhya_.  
    _fraud._ C. 諛諂, P. _māyā_, S. _māyā_.  
    _lack of modesty._ C. 無慙, P. _ahiri_, S. _ahrī_. There is very little difference in the meaning of this and next term in C., and it could be argued that there isn’t in the Indic terms, either. Traditionally, one is defined as the lack of a personal sense of morality, and the other is a disregard for social conventions of propriety. Essentially, they both mean “shamelessness.”  
    _lack of conscience._ C. 無愧, P. _anottappa_, S. _anapatrapa_.  
    _bad wishes._ C. 惡欲, P. _pāpikā icchā_, S. _pāpika icchā_. [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.23]] gives us a gloss of this term, saying that it means a person who wants to be known as possessing a virtue that they know they do not.  
    _bad views._ C. 惡見, P. _pāpikā diṭṭhi_, S. _pāpika dṛṣṭi_. The precise meaning intended here is not clear, but there are glosses in other contexts. For example, [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/AN_flat/AN10/AN10.104]] glosses bad view as the viewpoint that results from following the wrong eightfold path, which in turn leads “to what is unlikable, undesirable, disagreeable, harmful, and suffering” (P. _aniṭṭhāya akantāya amanāpāya ahitāya dukkhāya saṁvattanti_). Thus, “bad” views are those that lead to the bad results of bad actions that they motivate.

3. _Take for example … don’t cling to him._. C. 猶如青蓮華⋯紅赤⋯白蓮花，水生水長，出水上，不著水。如是，如來世間生、世間長，出世間行，不著世間法.  
    Compare this passage with the conclusion of [[Clean Files 3/bodhi/SN Bodhi 5/SN22-34/SN22/SN22.94]]: “Suppose there was a blue water lily, or a pink or white lotus. Though it sprouted and grew in the water, it would rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to it. In the same way, though I was born and grew up in the world, I live having mastered the world, unsullied by the world.” (_Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, uppalaṁ vā padumaṁ vā puṇḍarīkaṁ vā udake jātaṁ udake saṁvaḍḍhaṁ udakā accuggamma ṭhāti anupalittaṁ udakena; evameva kho, bhikkhave, tathāgato loke jāto loke saṁvaḍḍho lokaṁ abhibhuyya viharati anupalitto lokenā”ti._)
