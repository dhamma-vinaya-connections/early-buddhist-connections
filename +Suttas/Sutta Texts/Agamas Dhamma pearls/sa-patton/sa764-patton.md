## [13. Factors of the Noble Path](index.html)

### 18 (764). Cultivation of the Noble Path

1. Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.

2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Now, I will explain the cultivation of the noble eightfold path. Listen closely and consider it well.

3. “What is the cultivation of the noble eightfold path? Here, a monk cultivates right view, relying on seclusion, the lack of desire, cessation, and an orientation towards renunciation … cultivates right intention … right speech … right action … right livelihood … right method … right mindfulness … right samādhi, relying on seclusion, the lack of desire, cessation, and an orientation towards renunciation. This is called cultivating the noble eightfold path.”

4. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
