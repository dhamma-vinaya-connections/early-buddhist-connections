## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

15 (9). Disillusionment
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Form is impermanent. What’s impermanent is painful, something painful is not self, and something that’s not self doesn’t belong to self, either. Observing it in this way is called true and correct observation.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] Thus, feeling … conception … volition … awareness is impermanent. What’s impermanent is painful, something painful is not self, and something that’s not self doesn’t belong to self, either. Observing it in this way is called a true observation.
3. “Noble disciples who observe it in this way become disillusioned with form … become disillusioned with sensation … conception … volition … awareness. Because they’re disillusioned, they don’t enjoy them. Because they don’t enjoy them, they attain liberation. This true knowledge arises in someone who is liberated: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”
4. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
