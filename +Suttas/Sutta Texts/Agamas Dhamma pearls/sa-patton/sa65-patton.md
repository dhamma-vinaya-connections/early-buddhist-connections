### Translating Classical Buddhism to Modern English

## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

62-73 (65). Feeling
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “You must always cultivate the methods of meditative contemplation and have inner peace in your heart. Why is that? A monk must always cultivate the methods of meditative contemplation and have inner peace in his heart to truly [62] examine … [63] discern … [64] discern in various ways … [65] know … [66] know in detail … [67] know in various ways … [68] be familiar with, [69] cultivate, [70] cultivate often, [71] enter, [72] contact, and [73] realize something. What is truly examined … _up to_ … realized? ‘This is form.’ ‘This is form’s formation.’ ‘This is form’s cessation.’ ‘This is feeling … conception … volition … awareness.’ ‘This is the formation of awareness.’ ‘This is the cessation of awareness.’
3. “What is the formation of form … feeling … conception … volition … the formation of awareness? A foolish, unlearned man doesn’t truly examine … _up to_ … realize painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant feelings. Because he doesn’t truly examine … _up to_ … realize ‘this is the formation of feeling’ … ‘cessation of feeling’ … ‘enjoyment of feeling’ … ‘trouble of feeling’ … ‘escape of feeling,’ grasping is produced from his delight and attachment to feeling. Grasping conditions existence, existence conditions birth, and birth conditions old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain. The whole mass of suffering forms in this way and arises. This is called the formation of form. This is called the formation of feeling … conception … volition … awareness.
4. “What is the cessation of form … feeling … conception … volition … cessation of awareness? A well-versed noble disciple truly examines … _up to_ … realizes painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant feelings. Because he truly examines … _up to_ … realizes ‘this is the formation of feeling’ … ‘cessation of feeling’ … ‘enjoyment of feeling’ … ‘trouble of feeling’ … ‘escape of feeling,’ his delight and attachment to feeling ceases. Grasping ceases because attachment ceases, existence ceases because grasping ceases, birth ceases because existence ceases, and old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain cease because birth ceases. The whole mass of suffering is completely ceased in this way. This is called the cessation of form … feeling … conception … volition … cessation of awareness.
5. “Therefore, monks, you must always cultivate the methods of meditative contemplation and have inner peace in your heart. Monks, abide in meditative contemplation, have inner peace in your heart. Be diligent in these methods, and truly examine … _up to_ … realize these things.”<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2]
6. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
(_Like [62] “examine,” likewise is [63] “discern,” [64] “discern in various ways,” [65] “know,” [66] “know in detail,” [67] “know in various ways,” [68] “be familiar with,” [69] “cultivate,” [70] “cultivate often,” [71] “enter,” [72] “contact,” and [73] “realize” are twelve_ sūtra_s recited in full.<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3]_)
