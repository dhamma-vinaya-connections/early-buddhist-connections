## [3. Dependent Origination](index.html)

3.11 (293). Beyond Doubt
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at the Squirrels’ Bamboo Grove of Rājagṛha.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed a certain monk, “‘Having gone beyond doubt, I’m free of hesitation, have pulled out the thorn of false views, and I won’t be going back to that again. Since my mind is attached to nothing, where would there be an “I”?’<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] I teach the Dharma for that monk [who says this]. I teach that monk according to the Dharma of dependent origination that’s related to the noble and supermundane emptiness. That is to say: ‘This thing exists because there is this, and this thing arises because this thing exists.’ That is to say, ‘Action is conditioned by ignorance. Awareness is conditioned by action. Name and form are conditioned by awareness. The six sense fields are conditioned by name and form. Contact is conditioned by the six sense fields. Feeling is conditioned by contact. Craving is conditioned by feeling. Clinging is conditioned by craving. Existence is conditioned by clinging. Birth is conditioned by existence. Old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, and trouble are conditioned by birth. Thus, the whole mass of suffering forms in this way … _up to_ … The whole mass of suffering ceases in this way.’”
3. “I teach the Dharma in this way, but then that monk has doubts and hesitations. Beforehand, he had the idea of attaining what he hadn’t attained, achieving what he hadn’t achieved, and realizing what he hadn’t realized. Now that he has heard the Dharma, he becomes unhappy, bitter, scarce, and blocked. Why is that? This is a deep standpoint, which is to say that of dependent origination. It’s twice again as profound and hard to see; that is, to part with all grasping, end craving, have no desire, be peacefully ceased, and _nirvāṇa_-d.
4. “Now, there are two things, namely the created and the uncreated. The created might be arising, remaining, changing, or ceasing. The uncreated doesn’t arise, doesn’t remain, doesn’t change, and doesn’t cease. This is called the peaceful cessation and _nirvāṇa_ of a monk’s actions and suffering.
5. “Suffering forms because of the formation of its causes, and suffering ceases because of the cessation of its causes. All pathways are cut, and continuity ceases. When continuity ceases, this is called the limit of suffering.
6. “Monks, what is it that ceases? It’s the remaining suffering. If it ceases, stops, cools, subsides, and disappears, that is called the ceasing of all grasping, the ending of craving, having no desire, peaceful cessation, and _nirvāṇa_.”
7. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
