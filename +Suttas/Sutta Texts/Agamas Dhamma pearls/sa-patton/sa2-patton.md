### Translating Classical Buddhism to Modern English
### Translator: Charles Patton

## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

5 (2). Correctly Contemplated
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “One should correctly contemplate form,<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] observe that form is impermanent, and truly know it. Why is that? Monks, when someone correctly contemplates form, observes it to be impermanent, and truly knows it, they stop desire and greed for form. When someone stops desire and greed, I say their mind is liberated.
3. “Thus, one should correctly contemplate feeling … conception … volition … awareness, observe that awareness is impermanent, and truly know it. Why is that? When someone correctly contemplates awareness, observes it to be impermanent[, and truly knows it], they stop desire and greed for awareness. When someone stops desire and greed, I say their mind is liberated.
4. “In this way, someone who wants to realize the mind’s liberation for themselves can realize: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3]

5. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
