## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

1-4 (1). Impermanent, Painful, Empty, and Not Self
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “You should observe that form is [1] impermanent … [2] painful … [3] empty … [4] not self. Observing it in this way is right view.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] Correctly observing it gives rise to disillusionment. When someone is disillusioned, delight and greed end. When delight and greed end, I say one’s mind is liberated.
3. “Thus observe that feeling … conception … volition … awareness is impermanent … painful … empty … not self. Observing it in this way is right view. Correctly observing it gives rise to disillusionment. When someone is disillusioned, delight and greed end. When delight and greed end, I say one’s mind is liberated.
4. “In this way, monks, someone who wants to realize the mind’s liberation for themselves can realize: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3] has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”
_(Like “observe … impermanent,” “pain,” “emptiness,” and “not self” are taught in the same way.)_
5. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
