## [2. The Sense Fields](index.html)

7 (191). Not Knowing (2)
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If someone doesn’t know and understand the eye, and they don’t stop and become free of desire for it, they aren’t capable of transcending the suffering of birth, old age, illness, and death. If someone doesn’t know and understand the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, and they don’t stop and become free of desire for it, they aren’t capable of transcending the suffering of birth, old age, illness, and death.
3. “Monks, if someone knows and understands the eye, and they stop and become free of desire for it, they’re capable of transcending the suffering of birth, old age, illness, and death. If they know and understand the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, and they stop and become free of desire for it, they’re capable of transcending the suffering of birth, old age, illness, and death.”
4. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
