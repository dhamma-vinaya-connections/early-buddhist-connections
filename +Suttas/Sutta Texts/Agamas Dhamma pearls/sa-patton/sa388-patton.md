## [4. The Truths](index.html)

10 (388). The Four Noble Truths (9)
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at the Residence of Sages in the Deer Preserve of Bārāṇasī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are four noble truths. What are the four? They are the noble truth of suffering, the noble truth of suffering’s formation, the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, and the noble truth of the path to suffering’s cessation.
3. “If a monk has known the noble truth of suffering, then he has understood [suffering] … has known the noble truth of suffering’s formation, then he has ended [its formation] … has known the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, then he has realized [its cessation] … has known the noble truth of the path to suffering’s cessation, then he has cultivated [that path]. He is called a monk who has ended the five factors, achieved six parts, guarded one thing, and relied upon four things. He abandons truths, leaves the crossroads, and realizes the ideas. By his own doing, his mind is well liberated, and his wisdom is well liberated. Being entirely pure white, he is called a superior man.”<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2]
4. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
