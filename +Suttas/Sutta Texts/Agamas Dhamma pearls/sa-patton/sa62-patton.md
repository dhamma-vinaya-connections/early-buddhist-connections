## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

59 (62). Greed and Attachment
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “What are the five acquired aggregates? They are the acquired aggregate of form … feeling … conception … volition … the acquired aggregate of awareness. A foolish and unlearned man without wisdom or insight becomes tied to views of self about these five acquired aggregates that arise. Greed is produced when his mind is tied to them. Monks, a well-versed noble disciple with wisdom and insight doesn’t become tied to views of self about these five acquired aggregates or is greed produced when his mind is tied to them.
3. “How does the foolish and unlearned man without wisdom or insight become tied to views of self about the five acquired aggregates and produce greed when his mind is tied to them? Monks, that foolish and unlearned man without wisdom or insight sees form as self, different than self, or either being present in the other. In this way, [he sees] feeling, conception, volition, and awareness as self, different than self, or either as present in the other. This is the way the foolish and unlearned man without wisdom or insight becomes tied to views of self about the five acquired aggregates and produces greed when his mind is tied to them.
4. “Monks, how does the noble disciple with wisdom and insight not become tied to claims about self or produce greed when his mind is tied to them? The noble disciple doesn’t see form as self, different than self, or either as being present in the other. In this way, he doesn’t see feeling, conception, volition, and awareness as self, different than self, or either as present in the other. This is the way the well-versed noble disciple with wisdom and insight doesn’t become tied to views of self about these five acquired aggregates or produce greed when his mind is tied to them.
5. “Whatever form there is, whether it’s past, future, or present, internal or external, crude or fine, beautiful or ugly, distant or near, all of them are correctly observed as being entirely impermanent. In this way, feeling … conception … volition … awareness … whether past, future, or present, internal or external, crude or ugly, beautiful or ugly, distant or near, they are all correctly observed as being entirely impermanent.”
6. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
