166 (54). The World
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at the Residence of Sages in the Deer Preserve of Bārāṇasī.
2. At the time, there was a brahmin from the village of *Vikataloka who came to visit the Buddha.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] He saluted, exchanged greetings with the Buddha, and withdrew to sit to one side. He said to the Buddha, “Gautama, I have a young disciple who knows astronomy and the clans. He divines fortune and misfortune for the great community. When he says there is something, then there surely is. When he says there is nothing, then there surely isn’t. When he says something will be created, it surely is. When he says something will be destroyed, it surely is. Gautama, what do you think about this?”
3. The Buddha told the brahmin, “Let’s set aside this young disciple of yours who knows astronomy and the clans. I will ask you a question; you answer it as you think. Brahmin, what do you think? Does form originally have no seed?”<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3]
He replied, “Yes, Bhagavān.”
4. “Does feeling … conception … volition … awareness originally have no seed?”
He replied, “Yes, Bhagavān.”
5. The Buddha told the brahmin, “You said, ‘My young disciple knows astronomy and the clans. He divines fortune and misfortune for the great community. When he says there is something, then there surely is. When he says there is nothing, then there surely isn’t …’ Isn’t his knowing and seeing untrue?”
He replied, “Yes, Bhagavān.”
6. The Buddha told the brahmin, “What do you think? Is there form that always exists for a hundred years? Is it one thing when it arises and something else when it’s destroyed? Do feeling … conception … volition … awareness always exist for a hundred years? Is it one thing when it arises and something else when it’s destroyed?”
He replied, “Yes, Bhagavān.”
7. The Buddha asked the brahmin, “What do you think? Your young disciple knows astronomy and the clans. He teaches the great community that something created isn’t destroyed. Isn’t his knowing and seeing unchanging?”
He replied, “Yes, Bhagavān.”
8. The Buddha asked the brahmin, “What do you think? Which is the better: this Dharma or his Dharma; this teaching or his teaching?”
9. The brahmin said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, it’s this teaching and Dharma, as the Buddha has taught it, made it plain, and revealed it. He is like someone who saves another from drowning in a river, saves another who was captured, shows the way to someone lost, or lights a lamp in the dark. The Bhagavān today has well explained a better Dharma, and he has made it plain and revealed it in the same way.”
10. After he spoke this _sūtra_, that brahmin from *Vikataloka who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and was gladdened. He then rose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha’s feet, and departed.
