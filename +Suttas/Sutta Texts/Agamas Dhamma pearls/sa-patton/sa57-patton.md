## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

1.169 (57). Self Pride
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān put on his robe and took his bowl into Śrāvastī to solicit alms. He returned carrying his robe and bowl, but he didn’t speak to the assembly or address his attendant. He went alone and without another to the western lands and toured among the people there.
3. At the time, there was a monk in Andha Forest who saw the Bhagavān from afar as he left alone without speaking to the assembly or addressing his attendant. Seeing that, he proceeded to visit Venerable Ānanda and said to him, “Venerable, you should know that the Bhagavān left alone to go touring without speaking to the assembly or addressing his attendant.”
4. Then, Ānanda said to that monk, “If the Bhagavān left alone to go touring without speaking to the assembly or addressing his attendant, then he shouldn’t be followed. Why is that? Because the Bhagavān wishes today to live in peace with few duties.”
5. Then, the Bhagavān wandered north to the village of Pada in Pañcāla. He stayed under a good sal tree in a forest that was guarded by wardens. Then, a group of monks went to Ānanda and said to him, “Have you heard lately where the Bhagavān is?”
Ānanda replied, “I heard that the Bhagavān went north to the village of Pada in Pañcāla. He is staying under a good sal tree in a forest protected by wardens.”
6. Then, the monks said to Ānanda, “Venerable, you must know that we haven’t seen the Bhagavān for a long time. If people weren’t troublesome, they could go together to visit the Bhagavān because he is merciful.” Knowing it was time, Ānanda silently assented.
7. Then, Venerable Ānanda and that group of monks rose early in the morning after the night had passed. They put on their robes and took their bowls into Śrāvastī to solicit alms. After soliciting alms, they returned to the monastery, put away their bedding, took their bowls, and headed west to tour among the people. They then went north to the village of Pada in Pañcāla and stayed in that forest that was protected by wardens. Once they had put away their robes and bowls and washed their feet, Venerable Ānanda and the group of monks then went to the Bhagavān, bowed their heads at his feet, and sat to one side.
8. The Bhagavān then taught the Dharma for that group of monks, making it plain, teaching, benefiting, and gladdening them.
9. Then, one of the monks sitting there had the thought: “By knowing what and seeing what does one swiftly put an end to the contaminants.”
10. Then, the Bhagavān knew the thought in that monk’s mind. “If there’s a monk sitting here who is thinking, ‘By knowing what and seeing what does one swiftly put an end to the contaminants,’ I have taught this Dharma. I said, ‘One must observe the aggregates. That is to say, the four abodes of mindfulness, four right efforts, four psychic abilities, five faculties, five powers, seven factors of awakening, and eight factors of the noble path.’ After being taught the Dharma in this way, one then observes the aggregates.
11. “But now there is still a good son who doesn’t diligently wish to do this, doesn’t diligently enjoy it, doesn’t diligently remember it, and doesn’t diligently believe it, but he is proud of himself. He’s unable to advance and put an end to the contaminants. If, again, a good son observes the aggregates with this Dharma I’ve taught, diligently desires to do so, diligently enjoys it, diligently remembers it, and diligently believes it, he can swiftly put an end to the contaminants.
12. “A foolish and unlearned ordinary man sees form as his self. If someone sees a self, this is called an action. What causes that action? What forms it? What produces it? What develops it? Ignorant contact produces craving, and the condition of craving brings about that action. What causes that craving? What forms it? What produces it? What develops it? Feeling causes that craving, feeling forms it, feeling produces it, and feeling develops it. What causes that feeling? What forms it? What produces it? What develops it? Contact causes that feeling, contact forms it, contact produces it, and contact develops it. What causes that contact? What forms it? What produces it? What develops it? The six sense fields cause contact, the six sense fields form it, the six sense fields produce it, and the six sense fields develop it.
13. “Those six sense fields are impermanent, created, and things that dependently arise from the mind. That contact … feeling … craving … action<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] is also impermanent, created, and something that dependently arises from the mind. One who contemplates in this way sees form as self. He might not see form as self but sees form as belonging to self … might not see form as belonging to self but sees form as present in self … might not see form as present in self but sees self as present in form …
14. “He might not see self present in form but sees feeling as self … might not see feeling as self but sees feeling as belonging to self … might not see feeling as belonging to self but sees feeling as present in self … might not see feeling as present in self but sees self as present in feeling …
15. “He might not see self as present in feeling but sees conception as self … might not see conception as self but sees conception as belonging to self … might not see conception as belonging to self but sees conception as present in self … might not see conception as present in self but sees self as present in conception …
16. “He might not see self as present in conception but sees volition as self … might not see volition as self but sees volition as belonging to self … might not see volition as belonging to self but sees volition as present in self … might not see volition as present in self but sees self as present in volition …
17. “He might not see self as present in volition but sees awareness as self … might not see awareness as self but sees awareness as belonging to self … might not see awareness as belonging to self but sees awareness as present in self … might not see awareness as present in self but sees self as present in awareness …
18. “He might not see self as present in awareness, but he makes views of termination and erodes views of existence.<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3] He might not make views of termination or erode views of existence, but he isn’t free of self pride. Someone who isn’t free of self pride will again see a self. Seeing a self is an action. What causes that action? What forms it? What produces it? What develops it? _As was said before up to_ … self pride. Someone who thus knows and thus sees will swiftly put an end to the contaminants.”
19. After he spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
