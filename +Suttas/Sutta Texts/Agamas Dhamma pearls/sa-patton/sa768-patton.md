### 23 (768). Good Friends

1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying in Rājagṛha at a mountain valley monastery.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2]

2. It was then that the Venerable Ānanda had this thought while alone in a quiet abode, “Half of the religious practice is good friends, good associates, and good followers …”

3. The Buddha told Ānanda, “The religious practice is entirely, fully, and purely good friends. What is the reason for that? It was because of good friends that I led sentient beings to cultivate right view by relying on seclusion, having no desire, cessation, and being oriented toward renunciation … to cultivate right _samādhi_ by relying on seclusion, having no desire, cessation, and an orientation towards renunciation.”

4. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
