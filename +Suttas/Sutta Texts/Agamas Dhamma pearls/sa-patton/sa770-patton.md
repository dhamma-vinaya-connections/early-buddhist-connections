### 25 (770). Wrong and Right

1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.

2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “You must part with wrong view; you must stop wrong view. If stopping wrong view weren’t possible, then I would never say that you must part with and stop wrong view. It’s because wrong view can be stopped that I say monks should part with wrong view. If they don’t part with wrong view, then wrong view will make them undertake what’s aimless, unbeneficial, and painful. I therefore say you must part with wrong view. _Wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong method, wrong mindfulness, and wrong_ samādhi _are likewise explained._

3. “Monks, after you part with wrong view, you must cultivate right view. If cultivating right view weren’t possible, I would never say that you must cultivate right view. It’s because right view can be cultivated that I say monks must cultivate right view. If they don’t cultivate right view, they will undertake what’s aimless, unbeneficial, and painful. Because not cultivating right view undertakes what’s aimless, unbeneficial, and painful, I therefore say you must cultivate right view. Because it’s purposeful and beneficial, it’ll always attain well-being. Therefore, monks, you must cultivate right view. _Right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right method, right mindfulness, and right_ samādhi _are likewise explained._”

4. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
