## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

152 (40). Stagnation
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Someone who is stagnated isn’t liberated, but when they aren’t stagnated, then they are liberated. How is someone stagnated not liberated? Monks, awareness abides in its substrates of four acquired aggregates. What are the four? Awareness abides stagnated in form. Awareness abides stagnated in feeling … conception … volition [as its substrate. Watered with greed and delight, it arises, grows, increases, and develops. Monks, whether while it’s coming, going, remaining, disappearing, or arising, awareness arises, grows, increases, and develops.]<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1]
3. [“Monks, if someone claims awareness has come, gone, remained, ceased, or arisen apart from form, feeling, conception, and volition, that would only be an assertion. When questioned, they would not know it, and this would increase delusion] because it’s something that’s impossible. This is called someone not being liberated because they are stagnated.
4. “How is someone who isn’t stagnated then liberated? Part with greed for the domain of form. [After parting with that greed, the mental stagnation in form that produced bondage is ended. After that, the substrate of form is ended. After the substrate has ended, awareness has nowhere to dwell, and it doesn’t arise again, grow, increase, or develop.]
5. “Part with greed for the domain of feeling … conception … volition. [After parting with that greed, the mental stagnation in volition that produced bondage is ended. After that, the substrate of volition is ended. After the substrate has ended, awareness has nowhere to dwell, and it doesn’t arise again, grow, increase, or develop.]
6. [“Because it doesn’t arise and grow, volitions aren’t made. Once volitions aren’t made, then one abides. Having abided, one is satisfied. Once one is satisfied, they’re liberated. Once they’re liberated, they grasp nothing and attach to nothing in all the world. Once they grasp nothing and attach to nothing, they realize _nirvāṇa_ for themselves: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’]
7. [“I say that their awareness doesn’t go east, west, south, north, to the four intercardinals, up, or down. It has no destination to which it goes. When they are about to enter _nirvāṇa_, it’s truly ceased, quenched, and] purified in the present life. This is someone being liberated because they are not stagnated.”
8. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
