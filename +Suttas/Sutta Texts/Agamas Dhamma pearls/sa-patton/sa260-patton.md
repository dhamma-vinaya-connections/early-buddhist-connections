## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

43 (260). Cessation
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. At the time, Venerable Śāriputra paid a visit to Venerable Ānanda. After they had exchanged greetings, he withdrew to sit at one side. Venerable Śāriputra then asked Venerable Ānanda, “I have a question I’d like to ask if you, sir, might have some time to answer it for me?”
Ānanda said, “Sir, you may ask your question. I’ll answer with what I know.”
3. Śāriputra asked, “Ānanda, there’s the term ‘cessation.’ What is it that ceases? Who possesses this cessation?”
4. Ānanda said, “Śāriputra, the five acquired aggregates created by past actions and wished for in the past are impermanent and subject to cessation. It’s cessation of those things that’s called ‘cessation.’ What are the five? The acquired aggregate of form created by past actions and wished for in the past is impermanent and subject to cessation. The cessation of that thing is called ‘cessation.’ In the same way, feeling … conception … volition … awareness created by past actions and wished for in the past is impermanent and subject to cessation. The cessation of that thing is called ‘cessation.’”
5. Śāriputra said, “Yes, yes! Ānanda, it’s as you say. These five acquired aggregates created by past actions and wished for in the past are impermanent and subject to cessation. It’s cessation of those things that’s called ‘cessation.’ What are the five? The acquired aggregate of form created by past actions and wished for in the past is impermanent and subject to cessation. The cessation of that thing is called ‘cessation.’ In the same way, feeling … conception … volition … awareness created by past actions and wished for in the past is impermanent and subject to cessation. The cessation of that thing is called ‘cessation.’
6. “Ānanda, how could they cease if these five acquired aggregates were not created by actions in the past and wished for in the past? Ānanda, it’s because these five acquired aggregates were created in the past and wished for in the past that they are impermanent and subject to cessation. It’s their cessation that’s called ‘cessation.’”
7. When those two gentlemen each heard what was taught, they rejoiced and departed.
