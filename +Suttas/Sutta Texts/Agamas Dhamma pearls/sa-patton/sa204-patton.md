77 (204). Truly Knowing and Seeing
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying in Doctor Jīvaka Kumāra’s Mango Park of Vaiśālī.
2. It was then that the Buddha addressed Venerable Ānanda, “One should truly know and truly see the eye. Whether it’s form,<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] visual awareness, visual contact, or painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant feelings that arise as a result of visual contact, they should be truly known and truly seen, too. _The ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are likewise._
3. “Once it’s truly known and truly seen, one becomes disillusioned with the eye. Whether it’s form, visual awareness, visual contact, or painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant feelings that arise as a result of visual contact, one becomes disillusioned with them, too. _The ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are likewise_. Once someone is disillusioned with it, they don’t enjoy it. Once someone doesn’t enjoy it, they are liberated from it. Being liberated, one knows and sees: ‘My births have ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished.’ They know for themselves that they won’t be subject to a later existence.”
4. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
