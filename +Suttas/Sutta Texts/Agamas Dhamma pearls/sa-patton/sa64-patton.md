## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

61 (64). Udāna
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at the Mṛgāra’s Mother Meeting Hall in the Eastern Park of Śrāvastī.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2]
2. It was then that the Bhagavān rose from meditation in the afternoon and exited the meeting hall. He prepared a seat for himself in the shadow of the hall in front of a large assembly. He then praised this _udāna_ verse:
- “‘Things have no self,    
    Nor are they possessed by a self, either.    
    Given that a self will not exist,    
    From what would something possessed by a self arise?’    
    A monk freed by this    
    Cuts off the lower bonds.”<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3]
3. A monk then rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, and spoke to the Buddha with his palms together, “Bhagavān, how is it that ‘there is no self nor anything possessed by a self’? Or, ‘given that a self will not exist, from what would something possessed by a self arise’? How is it that ‘a monk who is freed by this cuts off the lower bonds’?”<a id="fnref4"></a>[^4]
4. The Buddha told the monk, “A foolish, unlearned man imagines form to be self, different than self, or either being present in the other. [He imagines] feeling … conception … volition … awareness to be self, different than self, or either being present in the other. A well-versed, noble disciple doesn’t see form as self, different than self, or either being present in the other. He doesn’t see feeling … conception … volition … awareness to be self, different than self, or either being present in the other.
5. “[The ordinary man] also doesn’t know and doesn’t see: ‘This form is impermanent. Feeling … conception … volition … awareness is impermanent. Form is painful. Feeling … conception … volition … awareness is painful. Form is selfless. Feeling … conception … volition … awareness is selfless. This form will not exist. Feeling … conception … volition … awareness will not exist. This form will be destroyed. Feeling … conception … volition … awareness will be destroyed.<a id="fnref5"></a>[^5] Therefore, they are not self and not possessed by a self. A self and what’s possessed by a self will not exist.’ Someone who is freed in this way cuts off the lower bonds.”
6. That monk then asked the Buddha, “Bhagavān, how does a monk end the contaminants once he has cut the five lower bonds? How does he become uncontaminated, liberated in mind, and liberated in wisdom? How does he fully dwell in his own knowledge and direct experience here in the present: ‘My births have been ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished’? How does he himself know he won’t be subject to a later existence?”<a id="fnref6"></a>[^6]
7. The Buddha told the monk, “A foolish ordinary man is an unlearned sentient being who becomes fearful where there’s nothing to fear. A foolish ordinary man is an unlearned sentient being who becomes fearful of this: ‘There is no self and nothing possessed by a self, and neither of these two things will arise.’
8. “The four abodes of awareness are its substrates.<a id="fnref7"></a>[^7] What are the four? Form is an abode of awareness, and form is its substrate. When it craves and delights in form, [awareness] increases, enlarges, and grows. Feeling … conception … volition is an abode of awareness and its substrate. When it craves and delights [in volition], [awareness] increases, enlarges, and grows.
9. “Monk, whether when coming, going, abiding, arising, or ceasing, awareness increases, enlarges, and grows in these places. Suppose someone were to say, ‘Whether when coming, going, abiding, arising, or ceasing, awareness increases, enlarges, and grows in something else.’ This would only be a claim. When questioned, they wouldn’t know [the answer], and their uncertainty would increase because it’s not their area.<a id="fnref8"></a>[^8] And why is that?
10. “Monk, once one is free from greed for the element of form, the fetters produced by the mind regarding form are cut as well. Once the fetters produced by the mind regarding form are cut, that substrate of awareness is cut, too. Awareness no longer abides, and it doesn’t increase, enlarge, and grow anymore. Once one is free from greed for the element of feeling … conception … volition, the fetters produced by the mind regarding feeling … conception … volition are cut as well. Once the fetters produced by the mind regarding feeling … conception … volition are cut, that substrate [of awareness] is cut, too. Awareness has nowhere to abide, and it doesn’t increase, enlarge, or grow anymore.
11. “Awareness doesn’t grow because it has nowhere to abide. It creates nothing because it doesn’t grow. It abides then because it creates nothing. One is satisfied because it abides. One is liberated because they’re satisfied. One doesn’t grasp anything at all from any world because they are liberated. They have no attachments because they grasp nothing. They realize their own _nirvāṇa_ because they have no attachments: ‘My births have been ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished.’ They themselves know they won’t be subject to a later existence.<a id="fnref9"></a>[^9]
12. “Monk, I teach that awareness doesn’t abide to the east, south, west, north, the four intercardinals, up, or down. Being rid of desire, one sees the Dharma, _nirvāṇa_, complete cessation, tranquility, and cooling.”<a id="fnref10"></a>[^10]
13. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
