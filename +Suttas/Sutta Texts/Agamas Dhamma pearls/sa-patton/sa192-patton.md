## [2. The Sense Fields](index.html)

8 (192). Free of Desire
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If someone doesn’t become free of desire for the eye, their mind isn’t liberated, and they aren’t capable of correctly ending suffering. If they don’t become free of desire for the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, their mind isn’t liberated, and they aren’t capable of correctly ending suffering.
3. “Monks, if someone is free of desire for the eye, their mind is liberated, and they’re capable of correctly ending suffering. If someone is free of desire for the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, their mind is liberated, and they’re capable of correctly ending suffering.”
4. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
