## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

151 (39). Seeds
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are five kinds of seeds. What are the five? They are root seeds, stem seeds, joint seeds, seeds that fall naturally, and fruit seeds.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] Suppose these five seeds aren’t broken, decayed, spoiled, or blown away, newly ripened, and substantial. When earth element is present but not water element, those seeds won’t grow, increase, and develop.<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3] Suppose those seeds are newly ripened, substantial, aren’t broken, decayed, or blown away. When the water element is present but not earth element, those seeds also won’t grow, increase, and develop. Suppose those seeds are newly ripened, substantial, aren’t broken, decayed, spoiled, or blown away. When both the earth element and water element are present, then those seeds will grow, increase, and develop.
3. “Monks, those five seeds are analogous to the acquired aggregates together with awareness. The earth element is analogous to the four abodes of awareness, and the water element is analogous to the greed and delight of awareness abiding in those four acquired substrates.<a id="fnref4"></a>[^4] What are the four? Awareness abides in form and has form as its substrate. Watered with greed and delight, it arises, grows, increases, and develops. Awareness abides in feeling … conception … volition and has feeling … conception … volition as its substrate. Watered with greed and delight, it arises, grows, increases, and develops. Monks, whether while it’s coming, going, remaining, disappearing, or arising, awareness arises, grows, increases, and develops.
4. “Monks, if [someone claims] awareness has come, gone, remained, [ceased,] or arisen apart from form, feeling, conception, and volition, that would only be an assertion. When questioned, they would not know it, and this would increase delusion because it’s something that’s impossible.<a id="fnref5"></a>[^5]
5. “Part with greed for the domain of form. After parting with that greed, the mental stagnation in form that produced bondage is ended.<a id="fnref6"></a>[^6] After that, the substrate [of form] is ended. After the substrate has ended, awareness has nowhere to dwell, and it doesn’t arise again, grow, increase, or develop.
6. “Part with greed for the domain of feeling … conception … volition. After parting with that greed, the mental stagnation in volition that produced bondage is ended.<a id="fnref6"></a>[^6] After that, the substrate [of volition] is ended. After the substrate has ended, awareness has nowhere to dwell, and it doesn’t arise again, grow, increase, or develop.
7. “Because it doesn’t arise and grow, volitions aren’t made. Once volitions aren’t made, then one abides. Having abided, one is satisfied. Once one is satisfied, they’re liberated. Once they’re liberated, they grasp nothing and attach to nothing in all the world. Once they grasp nothing and attach to nothing, they realize _nirvāṇa_ for themselves: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’
8. “I say that their awareness doesn’t go east, west, south, north, to the four intercardinals, up, or down.<a id="fnref6"></a>[^6] It has no destination to which it goes. When they are about to enter _nirvāṇa_, it’s truly ceased, quenched, and purified in the present life.”
9. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
