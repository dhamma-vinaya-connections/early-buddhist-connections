24 (18). Not Another’s
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. There was then a certain monk who rose from his seat. He adjusted his robes to bare his right shoulder, bowed to the Buddha, and withdrew to stand at one side. He then said to the Buddha, “It would be good, Bhagavān, if you were to give me a brief explanation of the Dharma. Having listened to the Dharma, I will go alone to a quiet place, focus on contemplation, and live earnestly … _up to_ … ‘“I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.”’”
3. The Bhagavān then told that monk, “Good! It’s good that you said, ‘Bhagavān, give me a brief explanation of the Dharma. Having listened to the Dharma, I’ll go alone to a quiet place, focus on contemplation, and live earnestly … _up to_ … “‘I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”’ [Is this what you said?]”
The monk said to the Buddha, “Yes, Bhagavān.”
4. The Buddha addressed the monk, “Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain this for you. If something doesn’t belong to you and it doesn’t belong to someone else, then this is something to get rid of quickly. Once you’ve gotten rid of that thing, you will be benefited by this doctrine, and you’ll find happiness for a long time.”
That monk then said to the Buddha, “I’ve understood, Bhagavān! I’ve understood, Sugata!”
5. The Buddha said to the monk, “How do you understand the meaning of my brief explanation of the Dharma in full?”
6. The monk said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, form is not self, doesn’t belong to me, and doesn’t belong to someone else, so I should get rid of this thing quickly. Having gotten rid of it, I will benefit by this doctrine, and I’ll find happiness for a long time. Thus, feeling … conception … volition … awareness is not self, doesn’t belong to me, and doesn’t belong to someone else, so I should get rid of this thing quickly. Having gotten rid of it, I will benefit by this doctrine, and I’ll find happiness for a long time. Therefore, I understand the meaning of the Bhagavān’s brief explanation of the Dharma in full.”
7. The Buddha said, “Good! It’s good, monk, that you understand the meaning of my brief explanation of the Dharma in full. Why is that? Monk, form is not self, doesn’t belong to us, and doesn’t belong to someone else, so one should get rid of this thing quickly. Having gotten rid of it, one will benefit by this doctrine, and they’ll find happiness for a long time. Thus, feeling … conception … volition … awareness is not self, doesn’t belong to us, and doesn’t belong to someone else, so one should get rid of this thing quickly. Having gotten rid of it, one will benefit by this doctrine, and they’ll find happiness for a long time.”
8. When that monk heard what the Buddha taught, he felt great joy. He then bowed to the Buddha and withdrew. He went alone to a quiet place where he diligently trained and lived earnestly … _up to_ … “‘I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”
9. That monk’s mind was liberated, and he became an _arhat_.
