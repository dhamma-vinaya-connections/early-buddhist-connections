### 20-21 (766). The Arising of the Noble Path

1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.

2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Suppose a monk’s right view is pure, cleansed, without fault, and free of afflictions. This never happens except when he’s disciplined by a buddha (12.20) _or_ a sugata (12.21) … [right samādhi is pure, cleansed, without fault, and free of afflictions. This never happens except when he’s disciplined by a Buddha.]

3. “Suppose a monk’s right view is pure, cleansed, without fault, and free of afflictions. This can only happen when he’s [disciplined by a buddha _or_ a sugata … right samādhi is pure, cleansed, without fault, and free of afflictions. This can only happen when he’s disciplined by a buddha.]” <a id="fnref2"></a>[^2]

4. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
