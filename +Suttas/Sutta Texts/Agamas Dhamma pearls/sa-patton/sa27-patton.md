33 (27). Going from One Principle to the Next
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. There was then a certain monk who came to visit the Buddha. He bowed his head and withdrew to stand at one side. He then said to the Buddha, “The Bhagavān says ‘going from one principle to the next.’ How does one go from one principle to the next?”<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2]
3. The Buddha told the monk, “Good, good! Do you want now to know about going from one principle to the next?”
The monk said to the Buddha, “Indeed, Bhagavān.”
4. The Buddha told the monk, “[Listen closely!] Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain this for you. Monk, heading for disillusionment with form, becoming free of desire for it, and completely ceasing it is called going from one principle to the next. _It’s the same with feeling, conception, volition, and awareness_ … heading for disillusionment with awareness, becoming free of desire for it, and completely ceasing it is called going from one principle to the next.”
5. When that monk heard what the Buddha taught, he celebrated and rejoiced. He then bowed and departed.
