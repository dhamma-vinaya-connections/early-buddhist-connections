## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

165 (53). Sālā
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was wandering among the people of Kosala and stayed in the rosewood tree grove north of the village of Sālā.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2]
2. It was then that the lord of the village and the great clan of brahmins heard this: “An ascetic who was a son of the Śākya tribe and from a great clan of the Śākyas shaved off his hair and beard, put on the reddish-brown robes, had proper faith in homelessness, and left home to train on the path. Having achieved the unsurpassed and complete awakening, he is wandering now among the people here in Kosala. He has arrived here and is staying in the rosewood grove north of Sālā.
3. “Moreover, that ascetic Gautama has such an appearance, fame, truth, and virtue that praises of him from both gods and humans are heard in all eight directions. He is the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Completely Awakened One, the One Complete in Insight and Conduct, the Well Gone One, the Understander of the World, the Unsurpassed Man, the Trainer of Men, and the Teacher of Gods and Humans who is the Buddha and Bhagavān. He is the great sage in the world with its gods like Māra and Brahmā and ascetics and brahmins. He knows by his own realization: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished.’ He himself knows that he won’t be subject to a later existence. He teaches for the world a Dharma that is good in the beginning, middle, and end, and it’s good in its content and good in its expression. Being consistent, complete, and pure, it explains the wondrous Dharma of the clean religious practice.”
4. “It would be excellent to see him! It would be excellent to visit him! It would be excellent to pay our respects to him!” After having this thought, they then prepared their horses and led many of their followers while carrying golden vases, golden batons, and parasols. They went to the Buddha to pay their respects and offer service.
5. When they reached the entrance of the grove, they dismounted and proceeded on foot. When they reached the Bhagavān, they asked if he was doing well and withdrew to sit to one side. They then said to the Bhagavān, “Ascetic Gautama, what is your theory and what is your teaching?”
6. The Buddha told the brahmins, “My theory is causation, and I teach causation.”
7. Again, they asked the Buddha, “What is your theory of causation? What causation do you teach?”
8. The Buddha told the brahmins, “There are causes and conditions that bring about the world and causes and conditions that are the formation of the world. There are causes and conditions that cease the world and causes and conditions that are the cessation of the world.”
9. The brahmins asked the Buddha, “Bhagavān, what are the causes and conditions that form the world, and what causes and conditions are the formation of the world?”
10. The Buddha told the brahmins, “The foolish and unlearned ordinary man doesn’t truly know the formation of form, cessation of form, enjoyment of form, trouble of form, or escape from form. Not truly knowing them, he takes delight in form, praises form, is affected by it, and his mind abides there. He grasps it because he takes delight in form. Grasping is a condition for existence, existence is a condition for birth, birth is a condition for old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain. This then forms a great mass of suffering. _Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are likewise._ Brahmins, these are called the causes and conditions that form the world and the causes and conditions that are the formation of the world.”
11. The brahmins asked the Buddha, “What are the causes and conditions that cease the world, and what causes and conditions are the cessation of the world?”
12. The Buddha told the brahmins, “The well-versed noble disciple truly knows the formation of form, cessation of form, enjoyment of form, trouble of form, and escape from form. Truly knowing them, he doesn’t take delight in form, praise form, become affected by it, or remain there. His craving for form ceases because he doesn’t take delight or remain in it. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, existence ceases. When existence ceases, birth ceases. When birth ceases, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain cease. _Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are likewise._ Brahmins, these are called the causes and conditions that cease the world and the causes and conditions that are the cessation of the world. Brahmins, this is called my theory of causation and my teaching of causation.”
13. The brahmins said to the Buddha, “Gautama, such is a theory of causation; such is a teaching of causation. The world has its many duties; now we request to return to them.”
The Buddha told the brahmins, “You may go when you’re ready.”
14. After he spoke this _sūtra_, those brahmins who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and were gladdened. They bowed at his feet and departed.
