## [2. The Sense Fields](index.html)

95 (211). Become Aware of the Sense Fields
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Doctor Jīvaka Kumāra’s Mango Park of Vaiśālī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Before I became a correctly awakened one, I went alone to a quiet place and meditated. I thought, ‘What does my mind often turn to examine?’ My mind often chased after the virtues of the five desires from the past. It seldom chased after the virtues of the five desires in the present, and very seldom did it turn to chase them in the future. Noticing that my thoughts often chased the five desires from the past, I finally produced the methods to earnestly guard myself so that I wouldn’t continue following those virtues of the five desires from the past.
3. “Because I earnestly guarded myself, I eventually drew near the unsurpassed and complete awakening. You monks also often chase after the virtues of the five desires from the past, and very seldom do you chase after them in the present or future. Now, you too should increasingly guard yourselves because your thoughts often chase after the virtues of the five desires from the past. You too should reach the end of the contaminants before long. Without contamination, you will be liberated in mind and liberated in wisdom. Then you’ll realize for yourselves in the present: ‘My births have been ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished.’ You yourselves will know that you won’t be subject to another existence.
4. “Why is that? Inner feelings arise as a result of the eye seeing forms, whether they are painful, pleasant, or neither painful nor pleasant. Inner feelings arise as a result of the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind … notions, whether they are painful, pleasant, or neither painful nor pleasant. Therefore, monks, you must realize this about those sense fields: If the eye ceases, perception of forms then is escaped. If the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind ceases, perception of notions then is escaped.”<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2]
5. The Buddha said, “You should become aware of the six sense fields.” After saying that, he went to his room and sat in meditation.
6. There was then a group of monks who had a discussion after the Bhagavān was gone: “The Bhagavān gave us a brief teaching about the Dharma without discerning it fully, and then he went to his room to sit in meditation. The Bhagavān said, ‘You should become aware of the six sense fields. If the eye ceases, perception of forms then is escaped. If the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind ceases, perception of notions then is escaped.’ Today, we were given this brief teaching about the Dharma, but we still don’t understand it. Who here in the assembly has the power of wisdom to fully explain the meaning of the Bhagavān’s brief teaching about the Dharma for us?”
7. Again, they thought, “There’s just Venerable Ānanda. He’s always attending to the Bhagavān, and he’s always praised by the great teacher as being astute in the religious life. There’s only Venerable Ānanda who’s capable of fully explaining the meaning of the Bhagavān’s brief explanation of the Dharma. Let’s go together to Venerable Ānanda today and ask him about this brief meaning. We’ll all accept what Ānanda teaches us.”
8. That group of monks then went to Venerable Ānanda. After they had exchanged greetings, they sat to one side and said to Venerable Ānanda, “Venerable, you should know that the Bhagavān gave us a brief explanation of the Dharma … _as was said before_ … We all request that Ānanda give us a full explanation of the meaning of this.”
9. Venerable Ānanda told the monks, “Listen closely, and consider this well. I will give you a full explanation of the Bhagavān’s brief explanation of the Dharma. The Bhagavān’s brief teaching was to cease the six sense fields, but there was more to say. Therefore, he said, ‘The eye sense field ceases, and perception of forms then is escaped. The ear … nose … tongue … body … mind sense field ceases, and the perception of notions then is escaped.’ After the Bhagavān gave this brief explanation of this Dharma, he went into his room to sit in meditation. Now, I’ve given you an discerning explanation of this meaning.”
10. After he spoke this meaning, the monks who heard what Venerable Ānanda taught rejoiced and approved.
