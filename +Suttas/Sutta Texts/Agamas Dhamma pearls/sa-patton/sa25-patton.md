## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

31 (25). Well Versed
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that a certain monk came to visit the Buddha. He bowed to the Buddha and withdrew to stand at one side. He said to the Buddha, “The Bhagavān says ‘well versed.’ How is one well versed?”
3. The Buddha said to that monk, “Good, good! Are you asking me now about the meaning of ‘well versed’?”
The monk said to the Buddha, “Indeed, Bhagavān.”
4. The Buddha told the monk, “[Listen closely!] Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain it for you. Monk, you should know that if one learns about becoming disillusioned with form, becoming free of desire for it, completely ceasing it, and the principle of peace,<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] this is called being well versed. Thus, if one learns about becoming disillusioned with feeling … conception … volition … awareness, becoming free of desire for it, completely ceasing it, and the principle of peace, this is called being well versed. Monk, this is what the Tathāgata says is being well versed.”
5. When that monk heard what the Buddha taught, he celebrated and rejoiced. Then, he bowed and departed.
