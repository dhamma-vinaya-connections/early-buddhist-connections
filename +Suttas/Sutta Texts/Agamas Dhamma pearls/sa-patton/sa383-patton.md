## [4. The Truths](index.html)

5 (383). The Four Noble Truths (4)
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at the Residence of Sages in the Deer Preserve of Bārāṇasī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are four noble truths. What are the four? They are the noble truth of suffering, the noble truth of suffering’s formation, the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, and the noble truth of the path to suffering’s cessation.
3. “If a monk has known the noble truth of suffering, then he has understood [suffering] … has known the noble truth of suffering’s formation, then he has ended [its formation] … has known the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, then he has realized [its cessation] … has known the noble truth of the path to suffering’s cessation, then he has cultivated [that path]. In this way, a monk then ends craving and turns away from the bonds. Immediately understanding, he reaches the final end of suffering.”<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2]
4. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
