## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

145 (33). Not Self
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Form is not self. If form were self, it wouldn’t be that illness and pain arise from form, and there wouldn’t be these desires about form: ‘Let it be so; let it not be so.’ Because form has no self, illness and pain arise from it, and these desires become possible: ‘Let it be so; let it not be so.’ _Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are likewise._
3. “Monks, what do you think? Is form permanent, or is it impermanent?”
The monks said to the Buddha, “Impermanent, Bhagavān.”
4. “Monks, if something is impermanent, is it painful?”
The monks said to the Buddha, “It’s painful, Bhagavān.”
5. “If it’s impermanent and painful, it’s liable to change. Given that, would a well-versed noble disciple see form as having self, as being other than self, or that either form or self is present in the other?”
The monks said to the Buddha, “No, Bhagavān.”
6. “_Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are likewise._ Therefore, monks, whatever forms exist, whether in the past, future, or present, internal or external, crude or fine, beautiful or ugly, or distant or near, they are all not self, not other than self, nor are either present in the other. Observe them in this way. _Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are likewise._
7. “Monks, a well-versed noble disciple truly observes that what’s in these five acquired aggregates is not self and doesn’t belong to self. Having truly observed this, they take hold of nothing from all the world. Because they take hold of nothing, they have no attachments. Because they have no attachments, they realize _nirvāṇa_ for themselves: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”
8. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
