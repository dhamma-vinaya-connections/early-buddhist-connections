## [2. The Sense Fields](index.html)

128 (233). The World
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān told the monks, “Now, I will discuss the world, the world’s formation, the world’s cessation, and the path to the world’s cessation. Listen closely, and consider it well!”
3. “What is the world? It’s the six inner sense fields. What are the six? The inner sense field of the eye … ear … nose … tongue … body … the inner sense field of the mind.
4. “What is the world’s formation? It’s craving for a future existence together with delight and greed and attachment to the formation of one [existence] or another.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2]
5. “What is the world’s cessation? Craving for a future existence together with delight and greed and attachment to the formation of one [existence] or another is stopped without remainder. This having been abandoned, rejected, and ended, one is free of desire, and it ceases, stops, and disappears.
6. “What is the path to the world’s cessation? It’s the eightfold path, which is right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right method, right mindfulness, and right _samādhi_.”
7. After he spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
