## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

163 (51). What’s Destroyed
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Now, I will discuss for you the things that are destroyed and those are aren’t destroyed.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain this for you.
3. “Monks, form is something that’s destroyed, but the cessation and _nirvāṇa_ of that form is not something that’s destroyed.<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3] Feeling … conception … volition … awareness is something that’s destroyed, but the cessation and _nirvāṇa_ of that awareness is not something that’s destroyed.”
4. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
