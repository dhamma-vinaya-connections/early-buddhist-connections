## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

149 (37). I Myself
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I have no quarrel with the world, but the world quarrels with me. Why is that? Monks, if someone speaks according to the teaching, they don’t have a quarrel with the world. The world’s sages say, ‘That exists,’ and I also say, ‘That exists.’ How is it that the world’s sages say, ‘That exists,’ and I also say, ‘That exists’?
3. “Monks, form is impermanent, painful, and liable to change. The world’s sages say, ‘That exists,’ and I also say, ‘That exists.’ In this way, feeling … conception … volition … awareness is impermanent, painful, and liable to change. The world’s sages say, ‘That exists,’ and I also say, ‘That exists.’
4. “The world’s sages say, ‘That doesn’t exist,’ and I also say, ‘That doesn’t exist.’ That is, ‘Form is permanent, eternal, unchanging, and remains the same.’ The world’s sages say, ‘That doesn’t exist,’ and I say, ‘That doesn’t exist.’ ‘Feeling … conception … volition … awareness is permanent, eternal, unchanging, and remains the same.’ The world’s sages say, ‘That doesn’t exist,’ and I say, ‘That doesn’t exist.’ This is called the worldly sages saying, ‘That doesn’t exist,’ and I myself saying, ‘That doesn’t exist.’
5. “Monks, there is a mundane way of the world that I know and realize, and I also discern, explain, and demonstrate it for people. The world is blind, without eyes, and doesn’t know or see it, but it’s not me who is mistaken.
6. “Monks, what is the mundane way of the world that I myself know and realize and that I explain, discern, and demonstrate for people who are blind, without eyes, and don’t know or see it? Monks, form is impermanent, painful, and liable to change. This is called the mundane way of the world. Thus, feeling … conception … volition … awareness is impermanent, painful, and liable to change. This is the mundane way of the world. Monks, this is the mundane way of the world that I know and realize and that I discern, explain, and demonstrate for people. Those who are blind and without eyes don’t know or see it. How am I like those who are blind and without eyes and don’t know or see it?”
7. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
