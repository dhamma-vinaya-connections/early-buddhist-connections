### Translating Classical Buddhism to Modern English

## [3. Dependent Origination](index.html)

8 (290). Unlearned
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Squirrels’ Bamboo Grove of Rājagṛha.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “A foolish, untaught ordinary man becomes disillusioned, free of desire, and freed from the form body of four elements, but not awareness. Why is that? It’s apparent that the form body of the four elements increases and decreases, and it’s acquired and discarded. Whether it’s his heart, mind, or awareness, that foolish, untaught ordinary man cannot become disillusioned, free of desire, or freed from that awareness. Throughout the long night, he protects, values, and ties it to himself.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] Whether it’s ascertained or grasped, he says: ‘This is my self, it belongs to me, they exist together.’ Therefore, the foolish, untaught ordinary man isn’t able to become disillusioned, free of desire, freed from that.
3. “It would be better for a foolish, untaught ordinary man to tie his self and what belongs to that self to the form body of four elements, and he shouldn’t tie his self and what belongs to self to awareness. Why is that? The form body of four elements might last ten, twenty, thirty … _up to_ … a hundred years. If he’s in a good situation, it might last a little longer. His heart, mind, and awareness is divided day and night, not remaining for a moment as it develops and changes in verious ways, arising as one thing and ceasing as another.<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3] It’s like a large monkey wandering in a forest, staying in each place for a moment. It takes hold of branches and twigs, letting go of one and grabbing another. A man’s heart, mind, and awareness is likewise, arising as one thing and ceasing as another.
4. “The well-versed, noble disciple considers and observes the dependent arising of things.<a id="fnref4"></a>[^4] That is, contact with something pleasant conditions the arising of pleasant feeling. When he’s aware of a pleasant feeling, he truly knows that he’s aware of a pleasant feeling. When that contact with something pleasant ceases, then the feeling that dependently arose from that pleasant contact also ceases. It stops, cools, calms, and disappears. Like that pleasant feeling, a painful contact … happy contact … sad contact … neutral contact conditions the arising of a neutral feeling. When he’s aware of that neutral feeling, he truly knows that he’s aware of a neutral feeling. When that neutral contact ceases, the neutral feeling that dependently arose from that neutral contact also ceases. It stops, cools, calms, and disappears.<a id="fnref5"></a>[^5]
5. “It’s like two pieces of wood that combine to produce a fire when rubbed together. If those two pieces of wood are thrown away, the fire also ceases as a result. Thus, feelings are conditioned by the formation of contact, and contact produces that formation of contact.<a id="fnref6"></a>[^6] If this or that contact forms, then this or that feeling also forms. When the formation of this or that contact ceases, the formation of this or that feeling also ceases. It stops, cools, calms, and disappears.
6. “The well-versed noble disciple who contemplates in this way will be liberated from form … feeling … conception … volition … liberated from awareness. He’ll be liberated from birth, old age, illness, death, grief, sorrow, pain, and trouble. I say he will become liberated from suffering.”
7. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what he taught rejoiced and approved.
