127 (232). Samṛddhi (5)
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. There was then a monk named Samṛddhi who went to the Buddha, bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet, and withdrew to sit at one side. He said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, there’s the expression ‘the world is empty.’ What does the ‘the world is empty’ mean?”
3. The Buddha told Samṛddhi, “The eye is empty. It’s empty of something constant, eternal, and unchanging and empty of something that belongs to self. Why is that? It’s naturally like this. Whether it’s form, visual awareness, visual contact, feelings that dependently arise from visual contact that are painful, pleasant, or neither painful nor pleasant, they are also empty. They are empty of something constant, eternal, and unchanging and empty of something that belongs to self. Why is that? They are naturally like this. _The ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are likewise._ This is called ‘the world is empty.’”
4. After he spoke this _sūtra_, the monk Samṛddhi who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
