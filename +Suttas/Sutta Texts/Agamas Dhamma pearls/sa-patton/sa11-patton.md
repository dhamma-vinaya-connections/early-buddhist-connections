## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

17 (11) Causes and Conditions
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Form is impermanent. Whatever causes and conditions give rise to forms, they are also impermanent. How could forms that arise from impermanent causes and conditions be permanent? Thus, feeling … conception … volition … awareness is impermanent. Whatever causes and conditions give rise to instances of awareness, they are also impermanent. How could instances of awareness that arise from impermanent causes and conditions be permanent?
3. “Thus, monks, form is impermanent. Feeling … conception … volition … awareness is impermanent. What’s impermanent is painful, something painful is not self, and something that’s not self doesn’t belong to self.
4. “Noble disciples who observe it in this way become disillusioned with form … become disillusioned with feeling … conception … volition … awareness. Being disillusioned, they don’t enjoy it. Not enjoying it, they are liberated. Being liberated, they know and see: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”
5. When the monks who heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
