## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

160 (48). Faithful (2)
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “A good son of faith who is homeless and left home out of correct faith thinks to himself, ‘I should follow the Dharma. I must live often cultivating disillusionment with form … feeling … conception … volition … live often cultivating disillusionment with awareness.’
3. “A good son of faith who is homeless and left home out of correct faith then lives often cultivating disillusionment with form … feeling … conception … volition … lives often cultivating disillusionment with awareness. He can escape from form … feeling … conception … volition … can escape from awareness.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] I say that he will escape from all birth, old age, illness, death, grief, sorrow, pain, and trouble.”
4. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
