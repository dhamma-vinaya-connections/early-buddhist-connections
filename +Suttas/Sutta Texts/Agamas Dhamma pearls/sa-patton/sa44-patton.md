156 (44). The Bound and Awakened (2)
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Whoever is born is bound. To not be born is to not be bound. Listen closely, and consider it well! I will explain this for you.
3. “How is it that whoever is born is bound? Because he does not truly know form’s formation, cessation, enjoyment, trouble, and escape, a foolish and unlearned ordinary man takes delight in form, praises, grasps, and attaches to it, and grasps it as a self or what belongs to self. If that form changes or becomes different after he grasps it, his mind changes and becomes different along with it. He then accepts this mental abode because his mind changes and becomes different along with it. Then, fear, obstructions, and expectations arise because he accepts that mental abode, which is because he was born and bound. _Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are likewise._ This is called being born and bound.
4. “How is one not born and not bound? A well-versed noble disciple truly knows form’s formation, cessation, enjoyment, trouble, and escape. Truly knowing it, he doesn’t take delight in form or praise, grasp, or become attached to it. Nor is he bound by self or what belongs to self and grasp them. If that form changes or becomes different, his mind doesn’t change or become different along with it because he doesn’t grasp it. His mind doesn’t become bound or accept a mental abode because his mind doesn’t change and become different along with it. His mind isn’t fearful, obstructed, or expectant because he doesn’t accept that mental abode, which is because he isn’t born and bound. _Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are likewise._ This is called not being born and not being bound.”
5. After he spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
