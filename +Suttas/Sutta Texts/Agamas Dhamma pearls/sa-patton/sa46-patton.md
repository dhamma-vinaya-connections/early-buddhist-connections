## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

158 (46). Worldly Food
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are five acquired aggregates. What are the five? The acquired aggregate of form … feeling … conception … volition … the acquired aggregate of awareness. Suppose an ascetic or priest is aware of their various past lives using the knowledge of past lives. That past awareness, future awareness, or present awareness are all about these five acquired aggregates. [They think this] about that past awareness, future awareness, or present awareness: ‘Throughout my past, my form was thus, my feeling was thus, my conception was thus, my volition was thus, and my awareness was thus.’
3. “If something is resistant and divisible, it’s called the acquired aggregate of form. When something resists when touched by a hand, stone, stick, blade, cold, heat, thirst, hunger, biting insects, vipers, wind, or rain, it’s called contacting something resistant. Therefore, something resistant is the acquired aggregate of form. Moreover, this acquired aggregate of form is impermanent, painful, and liable to change.
4. “The aspects of sensation is the acquired aggregate of feeling. What is sensed? Pain is sensed, pleasure is sensed, and what’s neither painful nor pleasant is sensed. Therefore, we call these aspects of sensation the acquired aggregate of feeling. Moreover, this acquired aggregate of feeling is impermanent, painful, and liable to change.
5. “Concepts are the acquired aggregate of conception. What’s conceived? The concept of ‘a few,’ the concept of ‘many,’ the concept of ‘measureless,’ and complete nothingness creates the concept of ‘nothingness.’ Therefore, they are called the acquired aggregate of conception. Moreover, this acquired aggregate of conception is impermanent, painful, and liable to change.
6. “The nature of being made is the acquired aggregate of volition. What is it that’s being made? It’s form that’s being made … feeling … conception … volition … awareness being made. Therefore, the nature of being made is the acquired aggregate of volition. Moreover, this acquired aggregate of volition is impermanent, painful, and liable to change.
7. “The nature of distinguishing<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] is the acquired aggregate of awareness. It’s aware of what? It’s aware of form … sound … odor … flavor … touch … aware of ideas. Therefore, this is called the acquired aggregate of awareness. Moreover, this acquired aggregate of awareness is impermanent, painful, and liable to change.
8. “Monks, that well-versed noble disciple trains in this way regarding this acquired aggregate of form: ‘I’m being eaten by this present form, and I’ve been eaten by the forms I had in past lives just as I am now.’ Again, they think, ‘I’m being eaten by this present form. If I were to delight in a future form, I’ll be eaten by that form just as I am now.’ After knowing this, they don’t look back at past form, don’t delight in future form, and become disillusioned with this present form. They part with desire for it and completely cease it.<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3]
9. “A noble disciple trains in this way regarding this acquired aggregate of feeling … conception … volition … awareness: ‘‘I’m being eaten by this present awareness, and I’ve been eaten by the awareness I had in past lives just as I am now. I’m being eaten by this present awareness. If I were to delight in future awareness, I’ll be eaten by that awareness just as I am now.’ After knowing this, they don’t look back at past awareness, don’t delight in future awareness, and become disillusioned with this present awareness. They part with desire for it and completely cease it.
10. “They decrease and don’t increase,<a id="fnref4"></a>[^4] retreat and don’t advance, cease and aren’t produced, and are abandoned and not accepted. What decreases and doesn’t increase? Form decreases and doesn’t increase. Feeling … conception … volition … awareness decreases and doesn’t increase. What retreats and doesn’t advance? Form retreats and doesn’t advance. Feeling … conception … volition … awareness retreats and doesn’t advance. What ceases and isn’t produced? Form ceases and isn’t produced. Feeling … conception … volition … awareness ceases and isn’t produced. What’s abandoned and not accepted? Form is abandoned and not accepted. Feeling … conception … volition … awareness is abandoned and not accepted.
11. Decreasing and not increasing, they peacefully decrease and abide. Retreating and not advancing, they peacefully retreat and abide. Ceasing and not producing, they peacefully cease and abide. Abandoning and not accepting, they don’t become attached [to the aggregates]. Once the disciple isn’t attached to them, they themselves realize _nirvāṇa_: ‘My births have been ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”
12. When the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, a group of monks didn’t produce the contaminants, and their minds were liberated.
13. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
