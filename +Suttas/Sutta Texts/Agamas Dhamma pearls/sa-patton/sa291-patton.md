9 (291). Introspection
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at the Squirrels’ Bamboo Grove of Rājagṛha.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Do all of you grasp the introspection that I teach?”<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2]
3. Then, a certain monk rose from his seat, adjusted his robes, and bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet. He put his palms together and said to the Buddha, “I have grasped the introspection taught by the Bhagavān.” Then, that monk related his own description of it as such and such right there in front of the Buddha. Whatever he said, the Buddha wasn’t pleased by it.
4. At that time, Venerable Ānanda was behind the Buddha, holding a fan and fanning him. The Buddha told Ānanda, “Introspection that accords with the noble Dharma and Vinaya is different than what this monk has said.”
5. Ānanda said to the Buddha, “Now is the right time! Bhagavān, please explain the introspection of the noble Dharma and Vinaya. After they hear it, the monks will accept and approve of it.”
6. The Buddha told Ānanda, “Good! Listen closely, and I will explain it for you. These monks who grasp introspection should consider this: ‘If the many and diverse pains possessed by sentient beings arise, what is the cause, formation, arising, and instigation of these pains?’<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3] When they grasp it in this way, you should know that these pains are caused, formed, produced, and instigated by attachments.<a id="fnref4"></a>[^4]
7. “Furthermore, a monk [who grasps] introspection [should also know]: ‘What is the cause, formation, arising, and instigation of attachments?’ When they grasp it, they should again know that attachments are caused, formed, produced, and instigated by craving.
8. “Furthermore, a monk who grasps introspection should also know: ‘What is the cause, formation, arising, and instigation of craving?’ When they grasp it in this way, they should know that it’s worldly forms that are agreeable and proper.<a id="fnref5"></a>[^5] Craving for them arising, it arises; [craving for that] binding, it binds; and [craving for that] abiding, it abides.
9. “If ascetics and priests form the concept of permanence, concept of eternity, concept of safety, concept of healthiness, concept of self, or the concept of what belongs to self about worldly forms that are agreeable and proper when they view them, then their craving for these forms will grow. Once their craving has grown, their attachments will grow. Once their attachments have grown, then their will suffering grow. Once their suffering has grown, then they won’t be liberated from birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, and trouble. I say they won’t liberated from suffering.
10. “It’s like a cool pond alongside a road, which is full of fragrance and flavor but has been poisoned by someone during the hot month of spring. Travellers on the road oppressed by wind, heat, and thirst come wanting to drink from it. Someone tells them, ‘Man, this cool pond is full of fragrance and flavor,<a id="fnref6"></a>[^6] but there’s poison in it. Don’t drink from it! If you drink from it, you’ll die or suffer while close to death.’ Yet, those thirsty people don’t believe him and drink from the pond. Even though it tastes delicious, they either die in an instant or suffer while close to death.
11. “Likewise are ascetics and priests who form the view of permanence, view of eternity, view of safety, view of healthiness, or the views of self or what belongs to self about worldly forms that are agreeable and proper … _up to_ … They won’t be liberated from birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain.
12. “If ascetics and priests observe worldly forms that are agreeable and proper as illnesses, as abscesses, as thorns, as killers, and as impermanent, painful, empty, and not self, then they would part with their cravings of them. They would part with their attachments because they’ve parted with their cravings. They would part with suffering because they’ve parted with their attachments. They would part with birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, and trouble because they’ve parted with suffering.
13. “It’s like a cool pond alongside a road, which is full of fragrance and flavor but has been poisoned by someone during the hot month of spring. Travellers on the road oppressed by wind, heat, and thirst all come wanting to drink from it. Someone tells them, ‘This water is poisoned! None of you drink from it. If you drink from it, you will die or suffer while close to death.’ Those travellers then think, ‘This water is poisoned. If I were to drink it, I will either die in an instant or suffer while close to death. I’ll endure my thirst for now. I’ll eat a meal of dry flour, and not take any water to drink.’
14. “Likewise are ascetics and priests who observe worldly forms that are agreeable [and proper] as illnesses, as abscesses, as thorns, as killers, and as impermanent, painful, empty, and not self … _up to_ … They will be liberated from birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain.
15. “Therefore, Ānanda, see it in this way, learn it in this way, realize it in this way, and know it in this way. In the past and in the future, too, the path is likewise investigated in this way.”
16. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and accepted it.
