## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

159 (47). Faithful
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “A good son of faith<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] should have this thought, ‘I should follow the Dharma. I must live often cultivating disillusionment with form … feeling … conception … volition … live often cultivating disillusionment with awareness.’<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3]
3. “A good son of faith then often lives often cultivating disillusionment with form … feeling … conception … volition … lives often cultivating disillusionment with awareness. He therefore becomes disillusioned with form … feeling … conception … volition … becomes disillusioned with awareness. Once he’s disillusioned, he parts with desire for them and is liberated from them. He knows and sees his liberation: ‘My births have been ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”<a id="fnref4"></a>[^4]
4. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
