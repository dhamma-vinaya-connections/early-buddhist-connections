## [2. The Sense Fields](index.html)

81-84 (208). The Inner Sense Fields Are Impermanent, Etc.
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying in Doctor Jīvaka Kumāra’s Mango Park of Vaiśālī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “The eye in the past and future is [81] impermanent … [82] painful … [83] empty … [84] not self. Wouldn’t that be the case for the eye in the present, too? The well-versed noble disciple who contemplates in this way doesn’t look back at the eye in the past, doesn’t anticipate the eye in the future, and becomes disillusioned with the eye in the present. They don’t enjoy it, become free of desire for it, and turn towards its cessation.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] _The ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are likewise._”
3. After he spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
_(As with impermanence, pain, emptiness, and not self were likewise taught.)_
(_Like the four_ sūtra_s on the inner sense fields, there are four_ sūtra_s about the outer sense fields of form, sound, odor, flavor, touch, and ideas, and four_ sūtra_s about the inner and outer sense fields were taught as well._)

85-88 (208). The Outer Sense Fields Are Impermanent, Etc.
1. Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha was staying in Doctor Jīvaka Kumāra’s Mango Park of Vaiśālī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Form in the past and future is [85] impermanent … [86] painful … [87] empty … [88] not self. Wouldn’t that be the case for form in the present, too? The well-versed noble disciple who contemplates in this way doesn’t look back at form in the past, doesn’t anticipate form in the future, and becomes disillusioned with form in the present. They don’t enjoy it, become free of desire for it, and turn towards its cessation. _Sound, odor, flavor, touch, and ideas are likewise._”
3. After he spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.

89-92 (208). The Inner and Outer Sense Fields Are Impermanent, Etc.
1. Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha was staying in Doctor Jīvaka Kumāra’s Mango Park of Vaiśālī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “The eye and form in the past and future are [89] impermanent … [90] painful … [91] empty … [92] not self. Wouldn’t that be the case for the eye and form in the present, too? The well-versed noble disciple who contemplates in this way doesn’t look back at the eye and form in the past, doesn’t anticipate the eye and form in the future, and becomes disillusioned with eye and form in the present. They don’t enjoy them, become free of desire for them, and turn towards its cessation. _The ear and sound, nose and odor, tongue and flavor, body and touch, and mind and ideas are likewise._”
3. After he spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
