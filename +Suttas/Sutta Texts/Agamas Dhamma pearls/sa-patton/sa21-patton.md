## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

27 (21). Shaken
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. There was then a certain monk who rose from his seat, [adjusted his robes to bare his right shoulder,] bowed to the Buddha, [and withdrew to stand at one side]. He then said to the Buddha, “[It would be good,] Bhagavān, if you were to give me a brief explanation of the Dharma. Having listened to the Dharma, I will go alone to a quiet place, focus on contemplation, and live earnestly. Having lived earnestly, I’ll then think, “A good son [leaves home, cuts off his hair and beard, puts on the Dharma robes,] believes at home in being homeless, and leaves home … _up to_ …‘“I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.”’”
3. The Bhagavān then told that monk, “Good! It’s good that you said, ‘It would be good, Bhagavān, if you were to give me a brief explanation of the Dharma. Having listened to the Dharma, I’ll go alone to a quiet place, focus on contemplation, and live earnestly … _up to_ … “‘I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”’ [Is this what you said?]”
The monk said to the Buddha, “Yes, Bhagavān.”
4. The Buddha addressed the monk, “Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain this for you. Monk, when one is shaken, they are tied up by Māra. If one isn’t shaken, then they are free of Māra.”<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2]
That monk then said to the Buddha, “I’ve understood, Bhagavān! I’ve understood, Sugata!”
5. The Buddha said to the monk, “How do you understand my brief explanation of the Dharma in full?”
6. The monk said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, when form shakes [a person], then they are tied up by Māra. If someone isn’t shaken by it, then they are free of Māra. Thus, when feeling … conception … volition … awareness shakes them, then they are tied up by Māra. If someone isn’t shaken by it, then they are free of Māra. Therefore, I understand the meaning of the Bhagavān’s brief explanation of the Dharma in full.”
7. The Buddha said, “Good! It’s good that you understand the meaning of my brief explanation of the Dharma in full. Why is that? When form shakes a person, then they are tied up by Māra. If someone isn’t shaken by it, then they are free of Māra. Thus, when feeling … conception … volition … awareness shakes them, then they are tied up by Māra. If someone isn’t shaken by it, then they are free of Māra.”
8. … _Up to_ … “‘I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence’” … His mind was liberated, and he became an _arhat_.”
