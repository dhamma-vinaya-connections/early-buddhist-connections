## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

60 (63). Thorough Contemplation
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are five acquired aggregates. They are the acquired aggregate of form … feeling … conception … volition … the acquired aggregate of awareness. Monks, if ascetics or brahmins suppose there is a self, they would all suppose there is a self in relation to these five acquired aggregates. What are the five?
3. “Ascetics and brahmins see form as self, different than self, or either being present in the other. In this way, feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are seen as being self, different than self, or either being present in the other.
4. “Thus, his imagined self, ignorance, and discernments being observed this way, a foolish and unlearned man doesn’t discard what belongs to self. Someone who doesn’t discard what belongs to self enters the faculties. Once they enter the faculties, then they produce contact. Entering what is contacted by those six contacts, a foolish and unlearned man produces pain and pleasure, and everything else arises from this. This is called the six kinds of contact. What are the six?
5. “They are the sense field of visual contact … auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … sense field of mental contact. Monks, there is an element of having a mind, an element of notions, and an element of ignorance, which are what come together as ignorant contact. The foolish and unlearned man speaks of existence, non-existence, existence and non-existence, neither existence nor non-existence, the supremacy of self, the resemblance of self, and knowing self and seeing self.
6. “Furthermore, monks, the learned and noble disciple lives in the six sense fields of contact, but he tires of ignorance and produces insight. He parts with desire for ignorance and produces insight, not existence, not non-existence, not existence and non-existence, not neither existence or non-existence, not the supremacy of self, not the resemblance of self, nor knowing self and seeing self. Once he knows and sees in this way, his ignorant contacts that arose previously will cease, and afterward insightful contact arises.”
7. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
