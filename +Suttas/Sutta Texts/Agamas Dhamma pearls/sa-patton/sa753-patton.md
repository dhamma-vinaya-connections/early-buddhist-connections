### 6 (753). Immortality

1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.

2. It was then that a monk named Ariṣṭa went to the Buddha, prostrated at his feet, and withdrew to sit at one side. He said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, there’s the expression ‘immortal.’<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] What is it that’s called ‘immortal’?”

Buddha told Ariṣṭa, “‘Immortal’ is the name of a realm, but I take it to be the end of the contaminants of existence. That’s a clear explanation of this name.”

3. The monk Ariṣṭa said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, isn’t there a path and steps to attaining immortality when cultivated and cultivated often?”

The Buddha addressed the monk, “There is. It’s known as the noble eightfold path, which is right view … right samādhi.”

4. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
