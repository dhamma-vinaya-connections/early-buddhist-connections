26 (347). Susīma
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] The Buddha was staying at the Squirrels’ Bamboo Grove of Rājagṛha. People gave them respect, honors, and offerings,whether they were the king, great ministers, priests, prominent men, householders, or other worldly people. The Buddha and his assembly of disciples obtained great offerings of clothing, meals, bedding, and medicines, but no one gave respect, honors, or offerings of clothing, meals, bedding, or medicines to the other various religious assemblies.
The Heretics’ Plan
2. A group of people from another religion gathered in a meeting hall where they hadn’t before.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] This is what they discussed: “In the past, we’ve always been served, respected, and given offerings of clothing, meals, bedding, and medicines by the king, great ministers, prominent men, householders, and everyone else, but now that has stopped. They give their respect and offerings of clothing, meals, bedding, and medicines only to the ascetic Gautama and the disciples in his assembly. Now, is there a wise and great man<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3] in this group who could secretly ordain with that ascetic Gautama’s assembly? After listening to his Dharma, he could come back and teach it to us in full. We could then use that Dharma that he learned to convert the king, ministers, prominent men, and householders. They’ll have confidence in it, and they would return to giving us offerings as they had before.”
Then, someone said, “There is a youth named Susīma<a id="fnref4"></a>[^4] who’s astute and intelligent. He could secretly ordain with the ascetic Gautama’s assembly. Having listened closely to their Dharma, he could come back and teach it to us.”
3. Those adherents of another religion went to Susīma and said to him, “Today, a large group of us gathered in a meeting hall where we hadn’t before. This is what we discussed: ‘Up until now, we’ve always been served, respected, and given offerings of clothing, meals, bedding, and medicines by the king, great ministers, prominent men, householders, and worldly people, but now that has stopped. The king, great ministers, prominent men, householders, and worldly people all give their service … to the ascetic Gautama and his great assembly of disciples. Is there a man in this assembly who is astute and intelligent enough to secretly ordain with that ascetic Gautama’s assembly and train on the path? After listening to their Dharma, he could come back and teach it to us, and we’ll convert the king, great ministers, prominent men, and householders. Then, our assembly would get their respect, honors, and offerings again.’
“Someone among us said, ‘There’s only Susīma who’s astute and intelligent enough to secretly ordain with the ascetic Gautama’s assembly and train on the path. Having listened to their Dharma, he could retain all of it and then come back to teach it to us.’ Therefore, we’ve come to ask you, sir, if you would do that.”
4. That Susīma silently agreed and went to the Squirrels’ Bamboo Grove of Rājagṛha. There was a group of monks who had left their residence to go for a walk out in the open at the time. Susīma went to that group of monks and said, “Venerables, could I leave home and receive ordination<a id="fnref5"></a>[^5] in the correct Dharma and cultivate the religious life?”
5. That group of monks led Susīma to the Bhagavān, bowed their heads at the Buddha’s feet, and withdrew to sit at one side. They then said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, this Susīma is from another religion and seeks to leave home, receive ordination in the correct Dharma, and cultivate the religious life.”
6. The Bhagavān then knew the thoughts that were in Susīma’s mind. He told the monks, “All of you should liberate that Susīma who’s from another religion and allow him to leave home.” The monks then promised to liberate Susīma.
The Monk Liberated by Wisdom
7. Half a month after he had left home, there was a monk who said to Susīma, “Susīma, you should know that we have ended birth and death, established the religious life, and accomplished the task. We ourselves know we wont be subject to a later existence.”<a id="fnref6"></a>[^6]
8. Susīma then asked the monk, “How is it, Venerable? One trains while secluded from desires and bad and unskillful things. While they notice and examine things, this seclusion produces joy and happiness in them, and they perfect the first meditation. Was that what stopped the contaminants and well liberated your mind?”
The monk answered, “No, Susīma.”
9. Susīma again asked, “How is it, Venerable? Secluded from noticing and examining things, one has an inner purity and unified mind. Without noticing or examining things, this _samādhi_ produces joy and happiness, and one perfects the second meditation. Was that what stopped the contaminants and well liberated your mind?”
The monk answered, “No, Susīma.”
10. Susīma again asked, “How is it, Venerable? Parting with that joy, one lives in equinimity with right mindfulness and knowledge. In body and mind, they feel the happiness that nobles teach as well as detachment, which perfects the third meditation. Was that what stopped the contaminants and well liberated your mind?”
The monk answered, “No, Susīma.”
11. Susīma again asked, “How is it, Venerable? Parting with pain, stopping pleasure, and sorrow and joy having ended previously, one feels neither pain nor pleasure. With equanimity, purification, mindfulness, and unified mind, one perfects the fourth meditation. Was that what stopped the contaminants and well liberated your mind?”
The monk answered, “No, Susīma.”
12. Susīma again asked, “Suppose one personally realizes and fully abides in the peaceful liberation that produces form and formless [heavenly rebirth]. Was that what stopped the contaminants and well liberated your mind?”
The monk answered, “No, Susīma.”<a id="fnref7"></a>[^7]
13. Susīma again asked, “How is it, Venerable? You’re statements are not the same; the first and last ones contradict each other. How can one not have attained meditative _samādhi_ and also declare that [they are free of rebirth]?”
The monk answered, “I was liberated by wisdom.”
After that was said, each of that group of monks got up from their seat and departed.
Susīma Questions the Buddha
14. Once he knew that group of monks was gone, Susīma considered this: “The statements of these venerables were not the same; the first and last ones contradicted each other. They said they hadn’t gained these attainments, but they also declared that they knew realization for themselves.” After considering this, he went to the Buddha, bowed his head at his feet, and withdrew to stand at one side. He said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, a group of monks declared right in front of me: ‘Our births have been ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished. We ourselves know we won’t be subject to a later existence.’<a id="fnref8"></a>[^8]
15. “I then asked those venerables, ‘Being secluded from desires and bad and unskillful things … _up to_ … personally realized. Was that what stopped the contaminants and well liberated your mind?’ They replied, ‘No, Susīma.’
16. “I then asked, ‘Your statements are not the same; the first and last ones contradict each other. You say you’ve not reached these attainments, but you also declare that you know realization for yourselves.’ They replied, ‘We’ve been liberated by wisdom.’ After saying that, they each got up from their seats and departed.
17. “Now, I ask the Bhagavān: How can their statements not be the same, with the first and last ones contradicting each other? They haven’t reached these attainments but also declare that they know realization for themselves.”
18. The Buddha told Susīma, “First, they knew the Dharma life, and later they knew _nirvāṇa_. Those good sons went alone to a quiet place, focused on contemplation, and were careful. They parted with views of self, the contaminants stopped, and their minds were well liberated.”
Susīma said to the Buddha, “Now, I didn’t know that they first knew the Dharma life and then later knew _nirvāṇa_. Those good sons went alone to a quiet place, focused on contemplation, and were careful. They parted with views of self, the contaminants stopped, and their minds were well liberated.”
The Buddha told Susīma, “I didn’t ask if you knew or didn’t know that they first knew the Dharma life and afterward knew _nirvāṇa_. Those good sons went to alone to a quiet place, focused on contemplation, and were careful. They parted with views of self, the contaminants stopped, and their minds were well liberated.”
19. Susīma said to the Buddha, “Please, Bhagavān, teach the Dharma for me so that I can know the knowledge of the Dharma life and can see the knowledge of the Dharma life.”
20. The Buddha told Susīma, “Now, I will question you. Answer me with what you think. Susīma, what do you think? Are there old age and death because there’s birth? Are there old age and death when birth isn’t gone?”
Susīma answered, “Yes, Bhagavān.”
21. “There are old age and death because there’s birth. There aren’t old age and death without birth. _So it is with birth, existence, clinging, craving, feeling, contact, the six sense fields, name and form, awareness, action, and ignorance._ Is there action because there’s ignorance? Is there action when ignorance isn’t gone?”
Susīma answered, “Yes, Bhagavān. There’s action because there’s ignorance. There isn’t action without ignorance.”
22. The Buddha told Susīma, “Are there no old age and death when there’s no birth? Do old age and death cease without the cessation of birth?”
Susīma answered, “Yes, Bhagavān. There are no old age and death when there’s no birth. Old age and death don’t cease without the cessation of birth.”
23. “So it is … _up to_ … Is there no action when there’s no ignorance? Does action cease without the cessation of ignorance?”
Susīma answered, “Yes, Bhagavān. There’s no action when there’s no ignorance. Action doesn’t cease without the cessation of ignorance.”
24. The Buddha asked Susīma, “Has someone who knows and sees in this way been secluded from desires and bad and unskillful things … _up to_ … personally realized and fully abided [in the meditative attainments]?”
Susīma answered, “No, Bhagavān.”
25. The Buddha told Susīma, “This is called first knowing the Dharma life and afterward knowing _nirvāṇa_. Those good sons went alone to a quiet place, focused on contemplation, and were careful. They had parted with views of self, the contaminants stopped, and their minds were well liberated.”
Susīma Converts to the Buddha’s Teaching
26. After the Buddha taught this _sūtra_, Venerable Susīma became free of dust and dirt and his Dharma eye was clarified. Susīma then saw the Dharma, got the Dharma, and realized the Dharma beyond doubt. He didn’t get it by believing someone else or by another’s liberation. He gained confidence in the correct Dharma. He bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet and said to the Buddha, “I must apologize now, Bhagavān. I secretly left home to steal the correct Dharma, so I must apologize.”
27. The Buddha asked Susīma, “In what way did you secretly leave home to steal the correct Dharma?”
28. Susīma told the Buddha, “Bhagavān, there was a group of adherents of another religion who came to me and said, ‘Susīma, you should know, we were respected before and received offerings from kings, great ministers, prominent men, householders, and the other worldly people, but now that has stopped. They all give their offerings to the ascetic Gautama and his great assembly of disciples. Now, you could secretly go to that ascetic Gautama and ordain with his assembly of disciples to get his Dharma. Once you’ve gotten his Dharma, come back and explain it to us. We will use that Dharma we learn to convert worldly people so that they will give their respect and offerings as they did before.’ Therefore, Bhagavān, I secretly left home to steal the correct Dharma and Vinaya. Today, I apologize for that. Please, Bhagavān, accept my apology out of pity for me!”
29. The Buddha told Susīma, “I accept your apology. You should state it in full: ‘I was a fool, unskillful, and ignorant. I secretly left home to steal the correct Dharma and Vinaya, but today I apologize for that, having seen and known my misdeed. In the future, I will achieve the deportment of the Vinaya and develop virtue that will never be reduced.’ Why is that? Often when someone does something wrong, sees and knows it themselves, and apologizes for it, they achieve the deportment of the Vinaya and develop virtue that will never be reduced in the future.”
30. The Buddha told Susīma, “Now, I will tell you a story. Those who are wise can understand things with stories. Suppose a king had a warden who caught a thief, bound him, and escorted him to the king. He said, ‘Great King, this man is a thief. Please, King, decide his punishment.’
31. “The King said, ‘Take this criminal away, bind both of his hands, and announce his bad reputation everywhere in the kingdom. Afterward, take him outside of the city to the place where criminals are punished, and stab his whole body and four limbs with a hundred lances.’
“The executioner accepted the King’s instructions. He escorted that criminal with both his hands bound and announced his bad reputation everywhere in the city. He then led the criminal out of the city to the place where criminals were punished, and his whole body and four limbs were stabbed with a hundred lances.
32. “In the middle of the day, the King asked, ‘Is that criminal still alive?’”
“An official replied, ‘He lives.’”
33. The king then ordered the official, ‘Stab him with another hundred lances.’ Late in the afternoon, he was again stabbed with a hundred lances, but he still didn’t die.”
34. The Buddha told Susīma, “That king decreed his punishment was to be stabbed with three hundred lances. Could there be an intact spot left on that criminal’s body [as big as] the palm of his hand?”
Susīma answered, “There wouldn’t be, Bhagavān.”
35. He again asked Susīma, “Then, that criminal was stabbed with another hundred lances. Wouldn’t that be a cause for feeling pain, extreme pain, and suffering?”
Susīma said to the Buddha, “Extreme pain, Bhagavān. The pain would be difficult to endure if he were stabbed with a single lance. How could three hundred lances be endured?”
36. The Buddha told Susīma, “That’s all we can expect. If someone secretly leaves home to steal away the correct Dharma and Vinaya and teach it to others, such a person would experience pain that’s double that.”
37. When the Buddha taught this Dharma, Susīma from another religion ended his contaminants and his mind was freed. After the Buddha taught this _sūtra_, Venerable Susīma rejoiced and approved of it upon hearing what the Buddha taught.
