147 (35). Three Gentlemen
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at the Bamboo Park Monastery in Cedi.
2. At that time, there were three gentlemen who had left home not long before. They were Venerable Aniruddha, Venerable Nandika, and Venerable Kimbila.
3. Knowing what they were thinking in their minds, the Bhagavān then instructed them: “Monks, this is heart, this is mind, this is awareness. One should contemplate this and not contemplate that. Stopping this desire and stopping this form, a person fully abides in realization.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] Monks, could there be a form that remains permanent, unchanging, and the same?”
The monks said to the Buddha, “No, Bhagavān.”
4. The Buddha told the monks, “Good, good! Form is impermanent and liable to change. Rejecting it and parting with desire for it, it ceases, becomes tranquil, and disappears. Since the distant past, all forms have been impermanent, painful, and liable to change. Once known in this way, involvement with those forms that produce the contaminants, which are harmful, burning, and grievous, is entirely destroyed. Once it’s destroyed, one has no attachments. Once they have no attachments, one lives in well-being. Once they live in well-being, one will attain _parinirvāṇa_. _Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are likewise._”
5. When the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, those three gentlemen didn’t produce the contaminants, and their minds were liberated.
6. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
