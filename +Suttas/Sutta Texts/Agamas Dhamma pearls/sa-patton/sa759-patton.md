## [13. Factors of the Noble Path](index.html)

### 12 (759). Feeling

1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.

2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are three feelings that are impermanent, conditioned, and dependently arisen. What are the three? They are pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and feeling that’s neither pleasant nor painful.”

3. The monks asked the Buddha, “Bhagavān, isn’t there a path and steps that put an end of these three feelings when cultivated and cultivated often?”

4. The Buddha told the monks, “There is a path and steps that put an end to these three feelings when cultivated and cultivated often. What is that path and those steps that put an end to these three feelings when cultivated and cultivated often?”

5. The Buddha told the monks, “They are the noble eightfold path and right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right method, right mindfulness, and right samādhi.”

6. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
