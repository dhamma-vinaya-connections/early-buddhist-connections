## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

153 (41). Five Turns
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are five acquired aggregates: the acquired aggregate of form … feeling … conception … volition … the acquired aggregate of awareness. I truly know these five acquired aggregates in five ways: I truly know form … form’s formation … form’s enjoyment … form’s trouble … truly know form’s escape. Thus, I truly know feeling … conception … volition … awareness … awareness’ formation … awareness’ enjoyment … awareness’ trouble … truly know awareness’ escape.
Form
3. “How is form truly known? All the forms that exist are all four basic elements and forms made of the four basic elements are called form. Form is thus truly known.
4. “How is form’s formation truly known? Delight and craving for form are called form’s formation. Form’s formation is thus truly known.
5. “How is form’s enjoyment truly known? Delight and pleasure that arise dependent on form are called form’s enjoyment. Form’s enjoyment is thus truly known.
6. “How is form’s trouble truly known? When form is impermanent, painful, and liable to change, this is called form’s trouble. Form’s trouble is thus truly known.
7. “How is form’s escape truly known? When desire for form is controlled, stopped, and transcended, this is called form’s escape. Form’s escape is thus truly known.
Feeling
8. “How is feeling truly known? There is the body of six feelings: feeling that arises from visual contact … auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … feeling that arises from mental contact. This is called feeling. Feeling is thus truly known.
9. “How is feeling’s formation truly known? The formation of contact is feeling’s formation. Feeling’s formation is thus truly known.
10. “How is feeling’s enjoyment truly known? Delight and pleasure that arise dependent on the six feelings are called feeling’s enjoyment. Feeling’s enjoyment is thus truly known.
11. “How is feeling’s trouble truly known? When feeling is impermanent, painful, and liable to change, this is called feeling’s trouble. Feeling’s trouble is thus truly known.
12. “How is feeling’s escape truly known? When desire for feeling is controlled, stopped, and transcended, this is called feeling’s escape. Feeling’s escape is thus truly known.
Conception
13. “How is conception truly known? There’s the body of six conceptions. What are the six? They are conceptions that arise from visual contact … auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … and conceptions that arise from mental contact. This is called conception. Conception is thus truly known.
14. “How is conception’s formation truly known? The formation of contact is conception’s formation. Conception’s formation is thus truly known.
15. “How is conception’s enjoyment truly known? Delight and pleasure that arise dependent on conception are called conception’s enjoyment. Conception’s enjoyment is thus truly known.
16. “How is conception’s trouble truly known? When conception is impermanent, painful, and liable to change, this is called conception’s trouble. Conception’s trouble is thus truly known.
17. “How is conception’s escape truly known? When desire for conception is controlled, stopped, and transcended, this is called conception’s escape. Conception’s escape is thus truly known.
Volition
18. “How is volition truly known? There’s the body of six intentions: intentions that arise from visual contact … auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … and intentions that arises from mental contact. This is called volition. Volition is thus truly known.
19. “How is volition’s formation truly known? The formation of contact is volition’s formation. Volition’s formation is thus truly known.
20. “How is volition’s enjoyment truly known? Delight and pleasure that arise dependent on volition are called volition’s enjoyment. Volition’s enjoyment is thus truly known.
21. “How is volition’s trouble truly known? When volition is impermanent, painful, and liable to change, this is called volition’s trouble. Volition’s trouble is thus truly known.
22. “How is volition’s escape truly known? When desire for volition is controlled, stopped, and transcended, this is called volition’s escape. Volition’s escape is thus truly known.
Awareness
23. “How is awareness truly known? There are six bodies of awareness: the body of visual awareness … auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … and the body of mental awareness. These are called the bodies of awareness. The bodies of awareness are thus truly known.
24. “How is awareness’ formation truly known? The formation of name and form is called awareness’ formation. Awareness’ formation is thus truly known.
25. “How is awareness’ enjoyment truly known? Delight and pleasure that arise dependent on awareness are called awareness’ enjoyment. Awareness’ enjoyment is thus truly known.
26. “How is awareness’ trouble truly known? When awareness is impermanent, painful, and liable to change, this is called awareness’ trouble. Awareness’ trouble is thus truly known.
27. “How is awareness’ escape truly known? When desire for awareness is controlled, stopped, and transcended, this is called awareness’ escape. Awareness’ escape is thus truly known.
28. “Monks, if an ascetic or priest knows and sees form in this way and thus knows and sees the way to part with desire, this is called the correct heading. If someone is correctly headed, I say that they have entered. _Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are likewise._
29. “If an ascetic or priest truly knows and sees form, then disillusionment with form arises. Parting with desire for it, they don’t produce the contaminants, and the mind becomes liberated. If someone’s mind becomes liberated, then it becomes consistent. It being consistent, the religious life is established. Someone established in the religious life is free of another’s control. This is called the end of suffering. _Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness is likewise._”<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2]
30. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
