## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

157 (45). The Aggregates in the Past, Future, and Present
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are five acquired aggregates. What are the five? They are the acquired aggregate of form … feeling … conception … volition … the acquired aggregate of awareness. If ascetics and brahmins see some self, they all see these five acquired aggregates as self. Ascetics and brahmins see form as self, form as different than self, self as present in form, or form as present in self. They see feeling … conception … volition … awareness as self, awareness as different than self, self as present in awareness, or awareness as present in self.
3. “Foolish and unlearned ordinary men see form as self, different than self, or either as being present in the other because of ignorance. They say, ‘Self really is not abandoned. The faculties grow because it wasn’t abandoned. Contacts increase because the faculties have grown. This is because of the things with which the six contacts of the senses make contact.’<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] Those foolish and unlearned ordinary men have painful and pleasant experiences that are produced from contact with the senses. What are the six? They are the sense of visual contact … auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … the sense of mental contact.
4. “Thus, monks, the foolish and unlearned ordinary man has the elements of mind, ideas, and ignorance. Experiences of existence, non-existence, both existence and non-existence, ‘I am superior,’ ‘I am equal,’ ‘I am inferior,’ and ‘I know and I see’ arise because of his ignorant contacts. He thus knows and sees these experiences because of the six senses of contact.<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3]
5. “The well-versed noble disciple abandons ignorance and produces insight about these six contacts of the senses. They don’t produce experiences of existence, non-existence, both existence and non-existence, superiority, equality, inferiority, or ‘I know and I see.’ Knowing and seeing in this way, they first cease producing ignorant contacts and afterward produce the experiences of insightful contacts.”
6. After he spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
