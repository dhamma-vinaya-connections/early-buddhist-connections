## [3. Dependent Origination](index.html)

3.14 (296). Dependent Origination
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at the Squirrels’ Bamboo Grove of Rājagṛha.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Now, I’ll explain the principle of dependent origination and the things that are dependently arisen.
3. “What is the principle of dependent origination? That exists because this exists. That is to say, actions are conditioned by ignorance, awareness is conditioned by actions … _up to_ … In this way, the whole mass of suffering forms.
4. “What are the things that are dependently arisen? They are ignorance and actions. Whether a _buddha_ arises in the world or has yet to arise, these things are always present as abiding principles and the realm of principles.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] Those things are realized by the Tathāgata himself, and he achieves the complete and perfect awakening. He teaches them for others, revealing and disclosing them. That is to say, actions exist conditioned by ignorance … _up to_ … Old age and death exist conditioned by birth.
5. “Whether a _buddha_ has arisen in the world or has yet to arise, these things are always present as abiding principles and the realm of principles. Those things are realized by the Tathāgata himself, and he achieves the complete and perfect awakening. He teaches them for others, revealing and disclosing them. That is to say, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain exist because they dependently arise. Such things as these are abiding principles, [definite] principles, principles of suchness, and principles that are so. They are principles that aren’t apart from suchness and aren’t different from suchness. They are genuine, real, and not distortions.<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3] In this way, they follow their dependent arising. This is called the things that are dependently arisen, namely ignorance, actions, awareness, name and form, the six sense fields, contact, feeling, craving, clinging, existence, birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain. These are the things that are dependently arisen.
6. “The well-versed noble disciple rightly knows and sees well the principle of dependent origination and the things that are dependently arisen, and he does not seek their earliest point, saying: ‘Did I exist in past lives or not? What was I in past lives? What was I like in past lives?’ He does not seek a final point, [saying]: ‘Will I exist in future lives? What will I be? What will I be like?’ He does not hesitate inbetween, [saying]: ‘What sort of thing am I? What was before this existence? Who will it be after I die? Where did this sentient being come from? What will it be when it disappears from here?’
7. “Suppose that ascetics and priests appear who are bound by conventional views, meaning they are bound by the views of teachings about self, the views of teachings about sentient beings, the views of teachings about lives, or the views of what’s inauspicious or auspicious. At that point, he ends all [those views], knows them all, and cuts them at their root like chopping a palm tree at its base so that they do not arise again in a future life. This is called a well-versed noble disciple truly and correctly knowing the principle of dependent origination and the things that are dependently arisen. He sees them well, realizes them well, cultivates them well, and enters them well.”
8. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
