3.12 (294). The Foolish and the Wise
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at the Squirrels’ Bamboo Grove of Rājagṛha.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Foolish and unlearned ordinary men, being shrouded by ignorance and bound by the conditioning of craving, obtain this body of awareness. Internally, there is this body of awareness, and there is name and form externally. These two causes and conditions give rise to contact. Those things contacted by the six sense fields of contact cause painful and pleasant feelings experienced by foolish and unlearned ordinary men, which arise in various kinds.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] What are the six? The visual sense field of contact, auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … mental sense field of contact.
3. “If a wise person is shrouded by ignorance and bound by the conditioning of craving, they will obtain this body of awareness. Thus, there’s a body of awareness internally, and there’s name and form externally. These two conditions give rise to the six sense fields of contact. A wise person’s experience of painful and pleasant feelings arises because of what is contacted by the six sense fields of contact, which causes them to arise in various kinds. What are the six? The visual sense field of contact, auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … mental sense field of contact. What difference is there between a fool and a wise person who cultivates this religious practice of mine?”
The monks said to the Buddha, “The Bhagavān is the Dharma root, Dharma eye, and Dharma basis. Excellent, Bhagavān! Please explains this. Once they hear it, the monks will accept and approve of it!”
4. The Bhagavān then said to the monks, “Listen closely, and consider it well! I’ll explain this for you. Monks, those foolish and unlearned ordinary men, being shrouded by ignorance and bound by the conditioning of craving, obtain this body of awareness. Their ignorance doesn’t stop and their conditioning of craving doesn’t end. When their bodies break up and their lives ends, they return again and receive a body. Because they return and receive a body, they aren’t liberated from birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, and trouble. Why is that? Because these foolish ordinary men haven’t cultivated the religious practice in the past, nor were they correctly headed for the end of suffering and the final limit of suffering. Therefore, when their bodies broke up and their lives ended, they returned again and received a body. Because they returned and received a body, they haven’t been liberated from birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, and trouble.
5. “If a wise person is shrouded by ignorance and bound by the conditioning of craving, they will obtain this body of awareness. Their ignorance is stopped and their conditioning of craving is ended. Because their ignorance stops and their conditioning of craving ends, they won’t receive another [body] when their body breaks up and their life ends. Because they won’t receive another [body], they are liberated from birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, and trouble. Why is that? Because they were already cultivating the religious practice and were correctly headed to the end of suffering and the final limit of suffering. Therefore, when their body broke up and their life ended, they didn’t receive another [body]. Because they didn’t receive another [body], they were liberated from birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, and trouble. These are called the various differences between an ordinary man and a wise person who cultivates this religious practice of mine.”
6. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
