## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

167 (55). The Aggregates
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at the Residence of Sages in the Deer Preserve of Bārāṇasī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will now explain the aggregates and the acquired aggregates. What are the aggregates? Whatever forms there are, whether they are past, future, or present, internal or external, crude or fine, beautiful or ugly, or distant or near, they are all generally referred to as the form aggregate. Whatever feelings, conceptions, volitions, and instances of awareness there are are likewise. They are all generally referred to as the feeling, conception, volition, and awareness aggregate. They are called the aggregates.
3. “What are the acquired aggregates? If form is contaminated and it’s grasped, whether that form is past, future, or present, it produces greed, hate, delusion, and the rest of the manifold qualities of the higher mental defilements.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] _It’s the same with feeling, conception, volition, and awareness._ They are called the acquired aggregates.”
4. After he spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
