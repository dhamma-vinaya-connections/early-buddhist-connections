## [2. The Sense Fields](index.html)

126 (231). Samṛddhi (4)
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. There was then a monk named Samṛddhi who went to the Buddha, bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet, and withdrew to sit at one side. He said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, there’s the expression ‘the world.’ What is it that’s called the ‘world’?”
3. The Buddha told Samṛddhi, “What’s fragile and decaying, that is called ‘the world.’ What is it that’s fragile and decaying? Samṛddhi, the eye is something that’s fragile and decaying. Whether it’s form, visual awareness, visual contact, feelings that dependently arise from visual contact, or inner experiences that are painful, pleasant, or neither painful nor pleasant, they are all fragile and decaying. _The ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are likewise._ These things that are said to be fragile and decaying are called ‘the world.’”
4. After he spoke this _sūtra_, the monk Samṛddhi who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
