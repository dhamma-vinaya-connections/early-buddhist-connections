## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

168 (56). Being Contaminated and Uncontaminated
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at the Residence of Sages in the Deer Preserve of Bārāṇasī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will now explain being contaminated and uncontaminated. When form is contaminated and grasped, that form can produce love and hate. In this way, when feeling … conception … volition … awareness is contaminated and grasped, that awareness can produce love and hate. This is being contaminated.
3. “What is being uncontaminated? Whatever forms there are that aren’t contaminated or acquired, they don’t produce love or hate, whether they are past, future, or present. In this way, feelings … conceptions … volitions … instances of awareness that aren’t contaminated or acquired don’t produce love or hate,<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] whether they are past, future, or present. This is called being uncontaminated.”
4. After he spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
