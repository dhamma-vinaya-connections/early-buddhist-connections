### 19 (765). Past and Future Cultivation

1. Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.

2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Now, I will explain a monk’s past cultivation of the noble eightfold path and future cultivation of the noble eightfold path. [Listen closely and consider it well.]”

3. [“What is the cultivation of the noble eightfold path? Here, a monk cultivates right view, relying on seclusion, the lack of desire, cessation, and an orientation towards renunciation … cultivates right intention … right speech … right action … right livelihood … right method … right mindfulness … right samādhi, relying on seclusion, the lack of desire, cessation, and an orientation towards renunciation. This is called cultivating the noble eightfold path.”] <a id="fnref1"></a>[^1]

4. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
