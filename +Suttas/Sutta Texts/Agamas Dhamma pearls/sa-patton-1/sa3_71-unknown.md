71 (371). Four Foods
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are four foods that provide benefits to sentient beings and make it possible for them to remain in the world, be sustained, and grow. What are the four? The first is coarse lumps of food. Second is food of fine contact. Third is food of mental thought. Fourth is food of awareness.
3. “What causes these foods? What forms them? What produces them? What contacts them?<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] Craving is the cause of these foods, craving forms them, craving produces them, and craving contacts them. What causes this craving? What forms it? What produces it? What contacts it? Feeling causes craving, feeling forms it, feeling produces it, and feeling contacts it. What causes this feeling? What forms it? What produces it? What contacts it? Contact causes feeling, contact forms it, contact produces it, and contact contacts it. What causes this contact? What forms it? What produces it? What contacts it? The six sense fields cause contact, the six sense fields form it, the six sense fields produce it, and the six sense fields contact it.
4. “The formation of the six sense fields is the formation of contact. The formation of contact is the formation of feeling. The formation of feeling is the formation of craving. The formation of craving is the formation of food.<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3] Future birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain form because of the formation of food. The whole mass of suffering forms in this way.
5. “In this way, the cessation of the six sense fields ceases contact. The cessation of contact then ceases feeling. The cessation of feeling then ceases craving. The cessation of craving then ceases food. Future birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain cease because of the cessation of food. The whole mass of suffering ceases in this way.”
6. After he spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
