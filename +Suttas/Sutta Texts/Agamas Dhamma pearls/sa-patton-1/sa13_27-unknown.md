### 27 (772). The Other Shore (2)

1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.

2. A certain monk then came to visit the Buddha, prostrated at his feet, and withdrew to sit at one side. He said, “Bhagavān, there is what’s not the other shore and what is the other shore. Bhagavān, what’s not the other shore, and what is the other shore?”

3.The Buddha told that monk, “Wrong view is not the other shore, but right view is the other shore. Wrong intention … wrong speech … wrong action … wrong livelihood … wrong method … wrong mindfulness … wrong _samādhi_ is not the other shore, but right intention … right speech … right action … right livelihood … right method … right mindfulness … right _samādhi_ is the other shore.”

4. The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:

- “Rare are the people who can  
    Cross over to the other shore;  
    Everyone else in the world  
    Wander around on this shore.

- Of this right teaching and discipline,  
    There are some who can follow it;  
    They are the ones who can cross over  
    That difficult ford of birth-and-death.”

5. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
