## [2. The Sense Fields](index.html)

5 (189). Correctly Contemplated
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “One should correctly contemplate the eye, observe that it’s impermanent[, and truly know it].<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] Why is that? Because the eye is correctly contemplated, observed to be impermanent, [and truly known,] one’s desire and greed for the eye stops. I say one’s mind is correctly liberated because they’ve stopped desire and greed.
3. “Because one correctly contemplates and observes … the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, they stop desire and greed … I say one’s mind is correctly liberated because they’ve stopped desire and greed.
4. “Thus, monks, someone who’s mind is correctly liberated can declare about themselves: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”
5. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
