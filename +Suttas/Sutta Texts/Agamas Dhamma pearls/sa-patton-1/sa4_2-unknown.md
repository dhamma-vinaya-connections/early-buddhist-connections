## [4. The Truths](index.html)

2 (380). The Four Noble Truths
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at the Residence of Sages in the Deer Preserve of Bārāṇasī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are four noble truths. What are the four? They are the noble truth of suffering, the noble truth of suffering’s formation, the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, and the noble truth of the path to suffering’s cessation.”
3. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
