### 74 (784). The Eightfold Path

1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.

2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There’s wrong, and there’s right. Listen closely and consider it well. I will explain this for you.

3. “What’s wrong? This refers to wrong view … wrong _samādhi_. What’s right? This refers to right view … right _samādhi_.

4. “What’s right view? It’s refers to the teaching that there’s generosity, there’s the teaching, there are observances, there are good conduct and bad conduct, and there are the results of good and bad conduct. There’s this world, and there’s the other world. There’s father and mother and the birth of sentient beings. There are arhats who arrive well, are headed well, and know and realize for themselves the perfect abode, whether it’s in this or the other world: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, the task has been accomplished. I know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’

5. “What’s right intention? It’s intent of renunciation, intent without anger, and intent that’s not harmful.

6. “What’s right speech? It’s being free of false speech, free of duplicity, free of harsh words, and free of fancy speech.

7. “What’s right action? It’s being free of killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct.

8. “What’s right livelihood? It’s pursuing clothing, food and drink, bedding, and medicine in ways that are according to Dharma and not contrary to it.

9. “What’s right method? It’s desire, effort, method, setting out, striving, and the ability to work constantly and not retreat.

10. “What’s right mindfulness? It’s mindfully following and remembering what’s not false or pointless.

11. “What’s right _samādhi_? It’s abiding with mind unconfused, resolute, collected, tranquil, in _samādhi_, and single-minded.”

12. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
