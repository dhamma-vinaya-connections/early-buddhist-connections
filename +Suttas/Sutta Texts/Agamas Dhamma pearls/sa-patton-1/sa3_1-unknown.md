1 (283). Planting a Tree
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If those things that are tying bonds are savored, thought about, and fetter the mind, then craving arises. Craving conditions grasping. Grasping conditions existence. Existence conditions birth. Birth conditions old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain. Such is the way that the whole mass of suffering forms.
3. “It’s like someone who plants a tree. At first, it’s small, flexible, and weak. When cared for and protected, it’s made secure. They cultivate it with fertile soil, water it at appropriate times, and make it suitable for cold and warm weather. As a result of these conditions, the tree grows larger afterward.
4. “In this way, monks, when things that are tying bonds are savored and nourished, this then gives rise to craving. Craving conditions grasping. Grasping conditions existence. Existence conditions birth. Birth conditions old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain. Such is the way that the whole mass of suffering forms.
5. “When things that are tying bonds are followed by contemplation of impermanence, contemplation of duration, arising, and cessation, contemplation of desiring nothing, contemplation of cessation, and contemplation of detachment, then one won’t think about them. Their mind won’t be bound up by them, and then craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, existence ceases. When existence ceases, birth ceases. When birth ceases, old age, illness, death, grief, sorrow, trouble, and pain cease. Such is the way that the whole mass of suffering ceases.
6. “It’s like someone who plants a tree. At first, it’s small, flexible, and weak. When it isn’t cared for and protected, it doesn’t become secure. They don’t cultivate it with fertile soil, water it at appropriate times, or make it suitable for cold or warm weather. [As a result of these conditions,] the tree doesn’t grow larger.
7. “Suppose, again, they cut it at the root, chop off its branches, cut it into sections, and the pieces are broken down further. It dries out in the wind, and the sun bakes it. They burn it to ash and use it as fertilizer, it’s blown away by the wind, or it’s carried away by a stream. Monks, what do you think? Wouldn’t that tree be destroyed when they cut it at the root … burn it to ash? It wouldn’t be something that arises again in the future, would it?”
They answered, “It wouldn’t, Bhagavān.”
8. “So it is, monks, when things that are tying bonds are followed by contemplation of impermanence, contemplation of duration, arising, and cessation, contemplation of desiring nothing, contemplation of cessation, and contemplation of detachment, then one won’t think about them. Their mind won’t be bound up by them, and then craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, existence ceases. When existence ceases, birth ceases. When birth ceases, old age, illness, death, grief, sorrow, trouble, and pain cease. Such is the way that the whole mass of suffering ceases.”
9. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
