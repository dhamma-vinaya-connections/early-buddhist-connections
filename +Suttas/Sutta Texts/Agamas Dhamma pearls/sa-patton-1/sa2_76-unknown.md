76 (203). Knowing and Seeing Ignorance
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying in Doctor Jīvaka Kumāra’s Mango Park of Vaiśālī.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2]
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If there is a monk who can end one thing, then he will attain right knowledge and be able to claim about himself: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished.’ He himself knows that he won’t be subject to a later existence.”
The monks said to the Buddha, “The Bhagavān is the root of the Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, and the basis of the Dharma. Please explain this in detail! After hearing it, the monks will accept and approve of it.”
3. The Buddha told the monks, “Listen closely, and consider it well! I will explain it for you. Monks, by ending what one thing … _up to_ … they won’t be subject to a later existence? That thing is ignorance. Insight arises when one becomes free of desire. Having attained right knowledge, a monk can claim about himself: ‘My births have ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished.’ He himself knows that he won’t be subject to a later existence.”
4. A certain monk then rose from his seat. He adjusted his robes to bare his right shoulder, bowed to the Buddha, and knelt down on his right knee with his palms together. He then said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, how does one know and see ignorance to become free of desire and produce insight?”
5. The Buddha told that monk, “One should correctly contemplate the eye as impermanent. Whether it’s form, visual awareness, visual contact, or painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant feelings that arise as a result of visual contact, they are correctly contemplated as impermanent, too. _The ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are likewise._ Monk, knowing and seeing ignorance in this way, one becomes free of desire and produces insight.”
6. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
