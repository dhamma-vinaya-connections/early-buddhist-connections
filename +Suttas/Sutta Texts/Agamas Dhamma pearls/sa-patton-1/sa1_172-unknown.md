## [1. The Aggregates](index.html)

1.172 (104). Yamaka
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
Yamaka’s Wrong View
2. It was then that a monk named Yamaka<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] had an evil view occur to him. He said, “As I understand the Dharma taught by the Buddha, an _arhat_ who has ended the contaminants will no longer exist when their body breaks up and their life ends.”
3. There was a group of monks who overheard what he said. They went to that monk Yamaka and said to him, “Did you really say ‘As I understand the Dharma taught by the Buddha, an _arhat_ who has ended the contaminants will no longer exist when their body breaks up and their life ends’?”
He replied, “That’s true, Venerables.”
4. The monks then said to Yamaka, “Don’t slander the Bhagavān. Slandering the Bhagavān isn’t good. The Bhagavān doesn’t say that. You should abandon this evil view.”
5. When the monks said this to him, Yamaka still held on to this evil view. He said, “Venerables, only this is true; anything else is false.” He said this three times.
6. Being unable to discipline Yamaka, the monks gave up and left. They went to Venerable Śāriputra and said to him, “Venerable, you should know that the monk Yamaka has had this evil view occur to him: ‘As I understand the Dharma taught by the Buddha, an _arhat_ who has ended the contaminants will no longer exist when their body breaks up and their life ends.’ After we heard what Yamaka had said, we went and asked him, ‘Did you really say that you know and see this?’
“He answered, ‘Venerables, that’s true; anything else is foolish talk.’
7. “We then said, ‘Don’t slander the Bhagavān. The Bhagavān doesn’t say that. You should abandon this evil view.’ We admonished him three times, but still he didn’t abandon this evil view, so we’ve come to you, Venerable. Please, Venerable, you should make Yamaka desist from this evil view out of compassion for him!”
Śāriputra said, “Yes, I will make him to desist from that evil view.”
That group of monks rejoiced and were glad when they heard Śāriputra say this, and then they returned to their abodes.
Śāriputra Makes Yamaka Desist
8. The Venerable Śāriputra then put on his robe and took his bowl into Śrāvastī to solicit alms early in the morning. After he ate, he left the city. Once he had returned to the monastery and put away his robes and bowl, he paid a visit to Yamaka. When Yamaka saw Venerable Śāriputra coming from a distance, he prepared a seat and set out a footstool for washing his feet.<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3] He went out to receive Śāriputra, took his robe and bowl, and invited him to take his seat.
9. After he had taken his seat and washed his feet, Śāriputra said to Yamaka, “Do you really say ‘As I understand the Dharma taught by the Bhagavān, an _arhat_ who has ended the contaminants won’t exist when his body breaks up and his life ends’?”
Yamaka said, “That’s true, Venerable Śāriputra.”
10. Śāriputra said, “Now, I’ll ask you a question, and you tell me what you think. How is it, Yamaka? Is form permanent, or is it impermanent?”
He replied, “Venerable Śāriputra, it’s impermanent.”
11. Again, he asked, “If something is impermanent, it’s painful, isn’t it?”
He replied, “It’s painful.”
12. Again, he asked, “If it’s impermanent and painful, it’s liable to change. Would a well-versed disciple see form as self, other than self, or either of them present in the other?”<a id="fnref4"></a>[^4]
He replied, “No, Venerable Śāriputra.”
“_Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are likewise._”
13. Again, Śāriputra asked, “How is it, Yamaka? Is form the Tathāgata?”
He replied, “No, Venerable Śāriputra.”
14. “Is feeling … conception … volition … awareness the Tathāgata?”
He replied, “No, Venerable Śāriputra.”
15. Again, Śāriputra asked, “How is it, Yamaka? Is there a Tathāgata who is something other than form? Is there a Tathāgata who is something other than feeling … conception … volition … awareness?”
He replied, “No, Venerable Śāriputra.”
16. Again, he asked, “Is there a Tathāgata in form? Is there a Tathāgata in feeling … conception … volition … awareness?”
He replied, “No, Venerable Śāriputra.”
17. Again, he asked, “Is there form in the Tathāgata? Is there feeling … conception … volition … awareness in the Tathāgata?”
He replied, “No, Venerable Śāriputra.”
18. Again, he asked, “Is there a Tathāgata who isn’t form … feeling … conception … volition … awareness?”
He replied, “No, Venerable Śāriputra.”
19. “So it is, Yamaka. The Tathāgata in the present life truly abides thus as nothing found and nothing postulated.<a id="fnref5"></a>[^5] How can you say, ‘As I understand the Bhagavān’s teaching, an _arhat_ who has ended the contaminants won’t exist when his body breaks up and his life ends’? Is that an appropriate statement?”<a id="fnref6"></a>[^6]
He replied, “No, Venerable Śāriputra.”
20. Again, he asked, “Yamaka, you had said before, ‘As I understand the Bhagavān’s teaching, an _arhat_ who has ended the contaminants won’t exist when his body breaks up and his life ends.’ Would you say that now?”
21. Yamaka said, “Venerable Śāriputra, I didn’t understand and was ignorant before, so I stated this evil view. After listening to what the Venerable Śāriputra has said, my misunderstanding and ignorance has been completely dispelled.”
22. Again, Śāriputra asked him, “Yamaka, if again you were asked, ‘Monk, about that evil view that you stated before: What do you know and see now that you’ve entirely abandoned it?’ How would you answer?”
23. Yamaka answered, “Venerable Śāriputra, if someone came and asked me that, I would answer in this way: ‘The form of an _arhat_ who has ended the contaminants is impermanent. Something that’s impermanent is painful, and what’s painful has become tranquil, has cooled, and has disappeared forever. _Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are likewise._’ Were someone to come and ask me that, I would answer them in this way.”
24. Śāriputra said, “Good, Yamaka! Good! You should answer them is that way. Why is that? The form of an _arhat_ who has ended the contaminants is impermanent. Something that’s impermanent and painful is something that arises and ceases. _Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are likewise._”
25. When Venerable Śāriputra taught this Dharma, Yamaka parted with dust and defilement, and his Dharma eye was purified.
The Simile of the False Friend
26. Venerable Śāriputra said to Yamaka, “Now, I will give you an analogy, for wise people can understand things using analogies. Take the example of a prominent man’s son. This prominent man’s son was quite wealthy and had much property. He searched widely for servants to keep his property well-guarded.
27. “Then, an evil man from a rival clan becomes his servant as a pretense to befriend him. This man always watches for an opportunity while he sleeps at night, when he gets up in the morning, or when his servants are away. This evil man takes great care in his work and is modest when speaking so that his employer would be pleased and think of him as a friend or a son. Trusting him completely and not being suspicious, his employer doesn’t guard himself. After that, that evil man takes a sharp knife and ends his life with it.
28. “Yamaka, what do you think? Was this evil man from a rival clan a friend of that prominent man? Did he not have an intent to harm him from the start, always watching for an opportunity until his death? But that prominent man didn’t realize it until he was attacked.”
Yamaka replied, “That’s true, Venerable.”
29. Śāriputra said to Yamaka, “What do you think? Had the prominent man known at the start that that man befriended him as a pretense to attack him, wouldn’t he have guarded himself well and avoided being attacked?”
He replied, “Yes, Venerable Śāriputra.”
30. “So it is, Yamaka. Foolish and uneducated ordinary people think of the five acquired aggregates as permanence, safety, good health, self, and what belongs to self. They preserve and cherish these five acquired aggregates, but in the end the five acquired aggregates are a rival clan that attacks them. As with that prominent man, the aggregates befriend them as a pretense to attack them, but ordinary people don’t realize it.
31. “Yamaka, well-versed noble disciples observe that these five acquired aggregates are like illnesses, abscesses, thorns, and killers. They’re impermanent, painful, empty, not self, and don’t belong to self. Noble disciples don’t cling to or acquire these five acquired aggregates. Because they don’t acquire them, they aren’t attached to them. Because they aren’t attached to them, they themselves realize _nirvāṇa_: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”
32. When Venerable Śāriputra explained the Dharma, Yamaka didn’t produce the contaminants, and his mind was liberated. After Venerable Śāriputra had explained the Dharma and shown, taught, illuminated, and gladdened him, Yamaka got up from his seat and left.
