93 (209). The Sense Fields of Contact
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Doctor Jīvaka Kumāra’s Mango Park of Vaiśālī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān told the monks, “There are six sense fields of contact. What are the six? The sense field of visual contact … auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … and the sense field of mental contact. Suppose an ascetic or brahmin doesn’t truly know the formation, cessation, enjoyment, trouble, and escape from these six sense fields of contact. You should know that this ascetic or brahmin is as far away from my Dharma and Vinaya as the sky is from the Earth.”
3. There was then a certain monk who rose from his seat. He adjusted his robes, bowed to the Buddha, and saluted him with his palms together. He said to the Buddha, “I fully and truly know the formation, cessation, enjoyment, trouble, and escape from these six sense fields of contact.”
4. The Buddha asked this monk, “Now, I will ask you a question, and you answer that question. Monk, do you see the sense field of visual contact as self, different than self, or either as being present in the other?”
He answered, “No, Bhagavān.”
5. The Buddha told the monk, “Good, good! This sense field of visual contact is not self, not different than self, and neither is present in the other. When someone truly knows and sees this, they don’t produce the contaminants, their mind isn’t affected by attachments, and their mind becomes liberated. This is called the first sense field of contact having been ended and known. Its root being cut like a palm tree chopped down at its base, it will never again produce what is called visual awareness and forms in the future.
6. “Do you see the sense field of auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … mental contact as self, different than self, or either as being present in the other?”
He answered, “No, Bhagavān.”
7. The Buddha told him, “Good, good! The sense field of auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … mental contact is not self, not different than self, and neither is present in the other. When someone truly knows and sees this, they don’t produce the contaminants, their mind isn’t affected by attachments, and their mind becomes liberated. This is called the sixth sense field of contact having been ended and known. Its root being cut like a palm tree chopped down at its base, it will never again produce what is called mental awareness and notions in the future.”
8. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
