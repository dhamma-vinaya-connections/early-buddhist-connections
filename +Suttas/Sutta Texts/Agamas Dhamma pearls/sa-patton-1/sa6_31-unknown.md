## [6. Feelings](index.html)

31 (489). Ten Things (4)
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at the Squirrels’ Bamboo Park of Rājagṛha.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If one contemplates one thing as impermanent, contemplates it as changing, contemplates it without desire, contemplates its cessation, and contemplates its abandonment, that is the ultimate end of suffering, and they will be freed from suffering. That is, all sentient beings rely on food to survive. There are also two things: name and form … There are also three things: the three feelings … There are also four things: the four foods … There are also five things: the five acquired aggregates … There are also six things: the six internal and external sense fields … There are also seven things: the seven abodes of awareness … There are also eight things: the eight qualities of the world … There are also nine things: the nine homes of sentient beings … There are also ten things: the path of ten deeds. One who contemplates these ten things as impermanent, contemplates them as changing, contemplates them without desire, contemplates their cessation, and contemplates their abandonment, that is the ultimate end of suffering, and they will be freed from suffering.”
3. After he spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
