### 14-15 (761). Trainees and Adepts

1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.

2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will explain the trainee and the adept (13.14) _or_ the correct man and the great man<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] (13.15). Listen closely and consider it well. What is a trainee _or_ correct man? It means their accomplishment of right view … right intention … right speech … right action … right method … right mindfulness … accomplishment of right samādhi. This is called a trainee _or_ correct man. What is an adept _or_ great man? It means their accomplishment of right view … right intention … right speech … right action … right method … right mindfulness … accomplishment of right samādhi. This is called an adept _or_ great man.”

3. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
