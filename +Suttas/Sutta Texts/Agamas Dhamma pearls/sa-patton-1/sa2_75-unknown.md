75 (202). How to End Views about Self
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. There was then a certain monk who paid a visit to the Buddha. He bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet and said, “Bhagavān, knowing and seeing what will successively end views about self and produce the view of no self?”
3. The Buddha told that monk, “Correctly contemplate the eye as being no self.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] Whether it’s form, visual awareness, visual contact, or painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant feelings that arise as a result of visual contact, they are correctly contemplated as being no self. Thus … _up to_ … painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant feelings that arise as a result of mental contact, they are correctly contemplated as being no self, too. Monk, knowing and seeing in this way will successively end views of self and produce the view of no self.”
4. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, that monk who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced. Having rejoiced, he bowed and departed.
