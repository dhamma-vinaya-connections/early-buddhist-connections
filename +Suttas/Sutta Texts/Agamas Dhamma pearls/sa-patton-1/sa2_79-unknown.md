## [2. The Sense Fields](index.html)

79 (206). Truly Knowing
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying in Doctor Jīvaka Kumāra’s Mango Park of Vaiśālī.
2. It was then that the Buddha addressed the monks, “One should be diligent in the methods of meditation and inner peace of mind. Why is that? Monks, with the methods of meditation and inner peace of mind, one thus truly knows what appears to them.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] What does one truly know is appearing? One truly knows appearances of the eye. Whether it’s form, visual awareness, visual contact, or painful, pleasant, or neither painful nor pleasant feelings that arise as a result of visual contact, one truly knows those appearances, too. _The ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are likewise._ One also truly knows these appearances to be things that are impermanent and created.”
3. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
