## [3. Dependent Origination](index.html)

3.13 (295). Not Yours
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at the Squirrels’ Bamboo Grove of Rājagṛha.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “This body is not possessed by you, nor is it possessed by someone else. That is, the six sense fields of contact are the wishes cultivated in the past that obtained this body.<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] What are the six? The visual sense field of contact … auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … and the mental sense field of contact.
3. “The well-versed noble disciple skillfully and correctly considers and investigates dependently arisen things: ‘There are these bodies of six kinds of awareness, six kinds of contact, six kinds of feeling, six kinds of conception, and six kinds of intention. Because they exist, there will be future birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain. In this way, the whole mass of suffering forms. This is called there being causes and conditions for the world to form.<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3]
4. “‘Because this doesn’t exist, these bodies of six kinds of awareness, six kinds of contact, six kinds of feeling, six kinds of conception, and six kinds of intention don’t exist. Because they don’t exist, there is no future birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, and trouble. In this way, the whole mass of suffering ceases.’
5. “If a well-versed noble disciple truly and correctly knows, sees well, realizes well, and enters well the formation and cessation of the world, this is called a noble disciple who invites this good Dharma, attains this good Dharma, knows this good Dharma, and enters this good Dharma. Perceptively knowing and seeing the birth and cessation of the world, he accomplishes the noble escape, the real tranquility, correctly ends suffering, and reaches the final limit of suffering. Why is that? The well-versed noble disciple truly knows, sees well, realizes well, and enters well the formation and cessation of the world.”<a id="fnref4"></a>[^4]
6. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
