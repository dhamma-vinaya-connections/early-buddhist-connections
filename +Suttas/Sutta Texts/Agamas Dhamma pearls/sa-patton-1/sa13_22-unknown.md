### 22 (767). Wholesome and Unwholesome Aggregates

1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.

2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “The expression ‘bad aggregate’ means the five hindrances. This is the correct explanation. What is the reason for that? It’s an entirely unwholesome aggregate that’s called the five hindrances. What are the five? They are the hindrance of greed … anger … drowsiness … restlessness, and the hindrance of doubt.

3. “The expression ‘good aggregate’ means the noble eightfold path. This is called the correct explanation. What is the reason for that? It’s an entirely, fully, and purely good aggregate that’s called the noble eightfold path. What are the eight? They are right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right method, right mindfulness, and right _samādhi_.”

4. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
