78 (205). Impermanent and Changing
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying in Doctor Jīvaka Kumāra’s Mango Park of Vaiśālī.
2. After reciting all the _udāna_ verses, the Bhagavān told Venerable Ānanda, “The eye is impermanent, painful, changing, and liable to become something else. Whether it’s form, visual awareness, visual contact, or painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant feelings that arise as a result of visual contact, they are impermanent, painful, changing, and liable to become something else, too. _The ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are likewise_.
3. “The well-versed noble disciple who contemplates it in this way becomes liberated from the eye. Whether it’s form, visual awareness, visual contact, or [painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant] feelings that arise as a result of visual contact, the noble disciple becomes liberated from them, too. … the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind … ideas, mental awareness, mental contact, or painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant feelings that arise as a result of mental contact, the noble disciple becomes liberated from them, too. I say they are liberated from birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and suffering.”
4. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, Venerable Ānanda heard what the Buddha taught, rejoiced, and approved.
