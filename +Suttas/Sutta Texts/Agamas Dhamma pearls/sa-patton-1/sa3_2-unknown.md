2 (284). A Great Tree
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If things that are grasped are savored, thought about, and fetter the mind, then one’s mind runs around chasing after name and form. Name and form conditions the six senses. The six senses condition contact. Contact conditions feeling. Feeling conditions craving. Craving conditions grasping. Grasping conditions existence. Existence conditions birth. Birth conditions old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain. Such is the way the whole mass of suffering forms.
3. “It’s like the roots, trunk, limbs, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit of a great tree. Its roots are deep and secure. Cultivated with fertile soil and irrigated with water, that tree will always be secure in the world and not decay.
4. “So it is, monks, when things that are grasped are savored, thought about, and fetter the mind, then one’s mind runs around chasing after name and form. Name and form conditions the six senses. The six senses condition contact. Contact conditions feeling. Feeling conditions craving. Craving conditions grasping. Grasping conditions existence. Existence conditions birth. Birth conditions old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain. Such is the way the whole mass of suffering forms.
5. “If those things that are grasped are followed by contemplation of impermanence, contemplation of duration, arising, and cessation, contemplation of desiring nothing, contemplation of cessation, and contemplation of detachment, one won’t think about them, and one’s mind won’t be fettered by anything. One’s awareness won’t run around chasing after name and form, and then name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six senses cease. When the six senses cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, existence ceases. When existence ceases, birth ceases. When birth ceases, old age, illness, death, grief, sorrow, trouble, and pain cease. Thus ceases the whole mass of suffering.
6. “It’s like someone who plants a tree. [At first, it’s small, flexible, and weak.] If it’s not cared for and protected at the appropriate times to make it secure, not cultivated with fertile soil, not watered at the appropriate times, andor make it suitable for cold and warm weather, it won’t grow larger.
7. “Suppose, again, they cut it at the root, chop off its branches, cut it into sections, and the pieces are broken down further. It dries out in the wind, and the sun bakes it. They burn it to ash and use it as fertilizer, it’s blown away by the wind, or it’s carried away by a stream. Monks, what do you think? Wouldn’t that tree be destroyed when they cut it at the root … burn it to ash? It wouldn’t be something that arises again in the future, would it?”
They answered, “Yes, Bhagavān!”
8. “So it is, monks, when things that are grasped are followed by contemplation of impermanence, contemplation of duration, arising, and cessation, contemplation of desiring nothing, contemplation of cessation, and contemplation of detachment, one won’t think about them, and one’s mind won’t be fettered by anything. One’s awareness won’t run around chasing after name and form, and then name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six senses cease. When the six senses cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, existence ceases. When existence ceases, birth ceases. When birth ceases, old age, illness, death, grief, sorrow, trouble, and pain cease. Thus ceases the whole mass of suffering.”
9. After the Buddha spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
