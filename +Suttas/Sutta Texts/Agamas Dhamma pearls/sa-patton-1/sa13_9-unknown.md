## [13. Factors of the Noble Path](index.html)

### 9 (756). Immortality (2)

1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.

2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There’s the expression ‘immortal.’ What is it that’s called ‘immortal’? ‘Immortal’ is the name of a realm, but I take it to be the end of the contaminants of existence. That’s a clear explanation of this name.”

3. The monks said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, isn’t there a path and steps to attaining immortality when cultivated and cultivated often?”

The Buddha addressed the monk, “There is. It’s known as the noble eightfold path, which is right view … right samādhi.”

4. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
