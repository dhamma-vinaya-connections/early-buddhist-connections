## [6. Feelings](index.html)

28 (486). Ten Things
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at the Squirrels’ Bamboo Park of Rājagṛha.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If one is correctly disillusioned with, doesn’t enjoy, and abandons one thing, they will put an end to the contaminants: That is, all sentient beings rely on food to survive. There are also two things: name and form … There are also three things: the three feelings … There are also four things: the four foods … There are also five things: the five acquired aggregates … There are also six things: the six internal and external sense fields … There are also seven things: the seven abodes of awareness … There are also eight things: the eight qualities of the world … There are also nine things: the nine homes of sentient beings … There are also ten things: the path of ten deeds. One who becomes disillusioned with, doesn’t enjoy, and abandons these ten things will put an end to the contaminants.”
3. After he spoke this _sūtra_, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
