129 (234). The End of the World
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I don’t say someone could travel to the end of the world, nor do I say that there’s an ultimate end of suffering for someone who doesn’t travel to the end of the world.” After saying this, he went into his dwelling to sit in meditation.
3. A group of monks then discussed it after the Bhagavān was gone: “The Bhagavān only gave this brief teaching: ‘I don’t say someone could travel to the end of the world, nor do I say that there’s an ultimate end of suffering for someone who doesn’t travel to the end of the world.’ After saying this, he went into his dwelling to sit in meditation. We’ve yet to understand the meaning of the Bhagavān’s brief teaching. Who among the Venerables is capable of explaining the meaning of the Bhagavān’s brief teaching for us?”
4. Again, they said, “There’s only Venerable Ānanda. He’s wise, has a complete memory, and always attends to the Bhagavān, right and left. The Bhagavān praises him as a well-versed religious practitioner. He’s capable of explaining the meaning of the Bhagavān’s brief teaching for us. Let’s go to Venerable Ānanda and ask him to explain it.”
That group of monks then went to Venerable Ānanda after having this discussion and sat to one side. They then asked Ānanda about the matter.
5. It was then that Ānanda told the monks, “Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain it for you. Whether it’s the world, the world’s names, the world’s ideas, the world’s expressions, and the world’s languages, they all enter the world, and it proliferates. Venerables, that’s to say that when the eye is the world, the world’s names, the world’s ideas, the world’s expressions, and the world’s languages, which all enter the world, and it proliferates. _The ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are likewise._
6. “The well-versed noble disciple truly knows the formation, cessation, enjoyment, trouble, and escape from the six sense fields. This is called the noble disciple who travels to the end of the world, knows the world, is honored by the world, and crosses over the world.”
7. It was then that Venerable Ānanda restated this in verse:
- “It’s not by traveling on foot    
    That the end of the world is reached;    
    Not reaching the end of the world,    
    Myriad pains can’t be escaped.
- Therefore, the honored sage    
    Is called the ‘Knower of the World;’    
    Able to reach the end of the world,    
    He established the religious practice.
- The end of the world is only something    
    Truly understood with right knowledge;    
    Awakened wisdom penetrates the world,    
    Which is called ‘crossing to the other side.’
8. “Indeed, Venerables. The Bhagavān only gave this brief teaching and went into his dwelling to sit in meditation. Now, I’ve discerned and explained it for you in detail.”
9. After he explained this teaching, that group of monks who heard what Venerable Ānanda taught rejoiced and approved.
