|如是我聞： 一時，佛在舍衛國、祇樹、給孤獨園。 與大比丘眾千二百五十人俱。|1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^da12note01) One time, the Buddha was at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī. He was accompanied by a great assembly of 1,250 monks.|
|爾時，世尊告諸比丘： 「我與汝等說微妙法，義味清淨，梵行具足，謂三聚法。 汝等諦聽，思惟，念之！ 當為汝說。」|2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will give all of you a teaching of the sublime Dharma, the content and expression of which are pure and perfect the religious life. It’s called the Dharma in three categories. All of you, listen closely, consider, and remember it! I will teach this for you.”|
|時，諸比丘受教而聽。|The monks then accepted the teaching and listened.|
|佛告比丘： 「三法聚者，一法趣惡趣，一法趣善趣，一法趣涅槃。|3. The Buddha addressed the monks, “Regarding these three categories, there’s one thing that leads to bad destinies, one thing that leads to good destinies,[2](#^da12note02) and one thing that leads to _nirvāṇa_.|

This is called the sublime and correct teaching in three categories. Being the Tathāgata, I’ve provided you with all that I should. Having pity for you, I’ve lectured on the _sūtra_s and the path. You should also have pity for yourselves, go to a quiet place under a tree or in an empty dwelling, and contemplate. Don’t be lazy! You’ll gain nothing by not exerting yourselves today and regretting it later.”|
|諸比丘聞佛所說歡喜，奉行。|44. The monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.| ^da12note01-ref ^da12note02-ref ^da12note03-ref ^da12note04-ref ^da12note05-ref ^da12note06-ref
