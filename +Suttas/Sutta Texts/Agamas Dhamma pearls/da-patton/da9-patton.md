|（九）佛說長阿含 第二分 眾集經第五|9. The Gathered Saṅgha|
|---|---|
|如是我聞： 一時，佛於末羅遊行。 與千二百五十比丘俱，漸至波婆城闍頭菴婆園。|1. Thus I have heard:[1](#^da9note01) One time, the Buddha was traveling among the Mallas. Accompanied by a great assembly of 1,250 monks, he eventually arrived at Cunda’s Mango Grove of Pāpā.[2](#^da9note02)|
|爾時，世尊以十五日月滿時，於露地坐，諸比丘僧前後圍繞。 世尊於夜多說法已，告舍利弗言： 「今者四方諸比丘集，皆共精勤。 捐除睡眠，吾患背痛。 欲暫止息。 汝今可為諸比丘說法。」|2. It was the fifteenth-day full moon when the Bhagavān sat in an open area with the assembly of monks both in front and behind him. After he had given them many discourses on the Dharma that evening, the Bhagavān addressed Śāriputra, “The monks have gathered today from the four directions to diligently apply themselves together. They aren’t sleepy yet, but I’m suffering from back pain. I’d like to take a break for a while. Perhaps you can explain the Dharma for the monks now?”|
|對曰： 「唯然，當如聖教。」|Śāriputra replied, “Very well, I’ll explain the noble teaching.”|
|爾時，世尊即四牒僧伽梨，偃右脇如師子，累足而臥。|3. The Bhagavān folded his outer robe four times and laid on his right side like a lion with his feet together.|
|時，舍利弗告諸比丘： 「今此波婆城有尼乾子命終未久。 其後弟子分為二部，常共諍訟相求長短，迭相罵詈。 各相是非： 『我知此法。汝不知此。汝在邪見。我在正法。言語錯亂，無有前後。』 自稱己言，以為真正： 『我所言勝，汝所言負。我今能為談論之主。汝有所問，可來問我。』|4. Śāriputra then addressed the monks, “Now, here in this city of Pāpā, it hasn’t been long since Nirgrantha Jñātaputra’s life ended. Since then, his disciples have split into two factions that constantly argue and look for shortcomings to reproach each other. They contradict each other, saying: ‘I know this teaching.’ ‘You don’t know this.’ ‘You hold wrong views.’ ‘I hold to the right teaching.’ ‘Their words are confused and without proper order.’ They consider statements praising themselves to be true, saying: ‘My statement is the winner; your words are defeated. I’m the one who gives discourses now. Come and ask me when you have questions.’|
|「諸比丘，時，國人民奉尼乾者，厭患此輩鬪訟之聲，皆由其法不真正故；法不真正無由出要，譬如朽塔不可復圬，此非三耶三佛所說。諸比丘，唯我釋迦無上尊法，最為真正可得出要，譬如新塔易可嚴飾，此是三耶三佛之所說也。|5. “Monks, the people of the country who make offerings to the Nirgranthas are weary and troubled by the noise of their fighting. As a result, they consider their teaching to be untrue. A teaching that’s untrue has no way to escape, just as a ruined shrine cannot be repainted. It’s not the teaching of a completely awakened one. Monks, only we Śākyans have the unsurpassed, noble teaching that’s truest and can lead to the escape, just as a newly built shrine is easily decorated. It’s the teaching of a completely awakened one.|
|「諸比丘，我等今者，宜集法、律，以防諍訟，使梵行久立，多所饒益，天、人獲安。|6. “Monks, today, we ought to collect the Dharma and Vinaya to safeguard them from disputes, establish the religious life for a long time, and benefit many people so that gods and humans will obtain peace.|
