### A Message on the Publication of the

### English Tripiṭaka

The Buddhist canon is said to contain eighty-four thousand different teachings. 
I believe that this is because the Buddha’s basic approach was to prescribe a 
different treatment for every spiritual ailment, much as a doctor prescribes a 
different medicine for every medical ailment. Thus his teachings were always 
appropriate for the particular suffering individual and for the time at which the 
teaching was given, and over the ages not one of his prescriptions has failed to 
relieve the suffering to which it was addressed. 
Ever since the Buddha’s Great Demise over twenty-five hundred years ago, 
his message of wisdom and compassion has spread throughout the world. Yet 
no one has ever attempted to translate the entire Buddhist canon into English 
throughout the history of Japan. It is my greatest wish to see this done and to 
make the translations available to the many English-speaking people who have 
never had the opportunity to learn about the Buddha’s teachings. 
Of course, it would be impossible to translate all of the Buddha’s eighty-four 
thousand teachings in a few years. I have, therefore, had one hundred thirty-nine 
of the scriptural texts in the prodigious Taishō edition of the Chinese Buddhist 
canon selected for inclusion in the First Series of this translation project. 
It is in the nature of this undertaking that the results are bound to be criticized. 
Nonetheless, I am convinced that unless someone takes it upon himself or herself 
to initiate this project, it will never be done. At the same time, I hope that an 
improved, revised edition will appear in the future. 
It is most gratifying that, thanks to the efforts of more than a hundred Buddhist 
scholars from the East and the West, this monumental project has finally gotten 
off the ground. May the rays of the Wisdom of the Compassionate One reach 
each and every person in the world.

### Editorial Foreword

In January 1982, Dr. NUMATA Yehan, the founder of Bukkyō Dendō Kyōkai 
(Society for the Promotion of Buddhism), decided to begin the monumental 
task of translating the complete Taishō edition of the Chinese Tripiṭaka (Buddhist 
canon) into the English language. Under his leadership, a special preparatory 
committee was organized in April 1982. By July of the same year, the Translation 
Committee of the English Tripiṭaka was officially convened. 
The initial Committee consisted of the following members: (late) H ANAYAMA 
Shōyū (Chairperson), (late) BANDŌ Shōjun, ISHIGAMIZennō, (late) K AMATA 
Shigeo, (late) K ANAOKA Shūyū, M AYEDA Sengaku, N ARA Yasuaki, (late) S AYEKI 
Shinkō, (late) S HIOIRIRyōtatsu, T AMARU Noriyoshi, (late) T AMURA Kwansei, 
URYŪZU Ryūshin, and Y UYAMA Akira. Assistant members of the Committee 
were as follows: K ANAZAWA Atsushi, W ATA NABE Shōgo, Rolf Giebel of New 
Zealand, and Rudy Smet of Belgium. 
After holding planning meetings on a monthly basis, the Committee selected 
one hundred thirty-nine texts for the First Series of translations, an estimated 
one hundred printed volumes in all. The texts selected are not necessarily limited 
to those originally written in India but also include works written or composed 
in China and Japan. While the publication of the First Series proceeds, the texts 
for the Second Series will be selected from among the remaining works; this 
process will continue until all the texts, in Japanese as well as in Chinese, have 
been published. 
Frankly speaking, it will take perhaps one hundred years or more to accomplish 
the English translation of the complete Chinese and Japanese texts, for they 
consist of thousands of works. Nevertheless, as Dr. NUMATA wished, it is the 
sincere hope of the Committee that this project will continue unto completion, 
even after all its present members have passed away. 
Dr. N UMATA passed away on May 5, 1994, at the age of ninety-seven, entrusting 
his son, Mr. N UMATA Toshihide, with the continuation and completion of the 
Translation Project. The Committee also lost its able and devoted Chairperson,

viii

Professor H ANAYAMA Shōyū, on June 16, 1995, at the age of sixty-three. After 
these severe blows, the Committee elected me, then Vice President of Musashino 
Women’s College, to be the Chair in October 1995. The Committee has renewed 
its determination to carry out the noble intention of Dr. N UMATA , under the lead- 
ership of Mr. N UMATA Toshihide. 
The present members of the Committee are M AYEDA Sengaku (Chairperson), 
ICHISHIMA Shōshin, ISHIGAMIZennō, K ATSURA Shōryū, N AMAIChishō, N ARA 
Yasuaki, S AITŌ Akira, S HIMODA Masahiro, Kenneth K. Tanaka, W ATANABE Shōgo, 
and Y ONEZAWA Yoshiyasu. 
The Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research was established in 
November 1984, in Berkeley, California, U.S.A., to assist in the publication of 
the BDK English Tripiṭaka First Series. The Publication Committee was organized 
at the Numata Center in December 1991. In 2010, the Numata Center’s operations 
were merged into Bukkyō Dendō Kyōkai America, Inc. (BDK America) and 
BDK America continues to oversee the English Tripiṭaka project in close coop- 
eration with the Editorial Committee in Tokyo.

### Publisher’s Foreword

On behalf of the members of the Publication Committee, I am happy to present 
this volume as the latest contribution to the BDK English Tripiṭaka Series. The 
Publication Committee members have worked to ensure that this volume, as all 
other volumes in the series, has gone through a rigorous process of editorial efforts. 
The initial translation and editing of the Buddhist scriptures found in this 
and other BDK English Tripiṭaka volumes are performed under the direction of 
the Editorial Committee in Tokyo, Japan. Both the Editorial Committee in Tokyo 
and the Publication Committee, headquartered in Moraga, California, are ded- 
icated to the production of accurate and readable English translations of the 
Buddhist canon. In doing so, the members of both committees and associated 
staff work to honor the deep faith, spirit, and concern of the late Reverend Dr. 
Yehan Numata, who founded the BDK English Tripiṭaka Series in order to dis- 
seminate the Buddhist teachings throughout the world. 
The long-term goal of our project is the translation and publication of the 
texts in the one hundred-volume Taishō edition of the Chinese Buddhist canon, 
along with a number of influential extracanonical Japanese Buddhist texts. The 
list of texts selected for the First Series of this translation project may be found 
at the end of each volume in the series. 
As Chair of the Publication Committee, I am deeply honored to serve as the 
fifth person in a post previously held by leading figures in the field of Buddhist 
studies, most recently by my predecessor, John R. McRae. 
In conclusion, I wish to thank the members of the Publication Committee for 
their dedicated and expert work undertaken in the course of preparing this volume 
for publication: Senior Editor Marianne Dresser, Dr. Hudaya Kandahjaya, Dr. 
Carl Bielefeldt, Dr. Robert Sharf, and Rev. Brian Kensho Nagata, Director of the 
BDK America English Tripiṭaka Project.

### Translator’s Introduction

#### The Textual Origin and Contents of the

#### Canonical Lengthy Discourses

The complex historical context in which the textual translation of the _Dīrgha 
Āgama_ took place is beyond the scope of this brief introduction. I attempt to 
provide here, however, an evaluation of three major features of this canonical 
tradition: the nature of this sutra collection and its contents, the translators and 
the times of translation, and the canonical legacy from the point of view of the 
premodern and modern contemporary Tripiṭaka Buddhist library. 
The _Chang ahan jing_ (Skt. _Dīrgha Āgama_ ), or the _Canonical Collection of 
Lengthy Discourses,_ is one of the four canonical collections that were upheld 
by the orthodox Dharmaguptaka school. Since this school descended from the 
Sthāvira orthodoxy that had a prominent position in the few centuries around 
the Third Buddhist Council, held around 250 to 236 B.C.E.,^1 centuries after the 
Buddha’s demise, the origin of this school’s canonical tradition (Āgamas) may 
be traced back to some scriptural matrix^2 whose contents had been compiled 
and authenticated by the time of the Third Council. 
There were three or four general councils during Buddhism’s early centuries. 
The First Council was held at Rājagṛha (present-day Rājgīr, Bihar) immediately 
after Śākyamuni’s passing (485 or 486 B.C.E.) in order to assure the oral preser- 
vation of the core teachings Śākyamuni Buddha taught directly to his disciples. 
The Second Council was held at Vaiśālī (Vesālī) a century later to settle some 
controversies on the Vinaya rules and disciplines set forth by Śākyamuni as the 
moral and spiritual codes for Buddhist monks and their communities. This 
council contributed to the ascertainment of legality on the nature of Vinaya 
codes, despite some challenges and disputes raised by changing historical and 
social contexts. At that time, it is said that some elder monks still remembered 
how some of the first-generation disciples had upheld the discipline while remain- 
ing active in daily life.

Translator’s Introduction

Though our knowledge of it is confined to Theravāda documents,^3 the Third 
Council was held under the auspices of the Mauryan Buddhist ruler Aśoka in 
the seventeenth year of his reign (251 B.C.E.) at the capital city Pāṭaliputra (Patna, 
Bihar). Although this council failed in its intended goal of preventing schism 
from sectarian movements, the Third Council was pivotal to the subsequent 
history of the Buddhist canonical tradition for two reasons. First, since the 
Buddha’s teaching and organization evolved in various forms during the initial 
two and a half centuries of its development, Buddhist leaders were compelled 
to reexamine their canonical traditions and establish an authenticated standard 
to prevent sectarian diversion and doctrinal variation. Second, it was during this 
council that Buddhist scriptures were formally classified into the threefold cat- 
egories of Sutra (teaching), Vinaya (discipline), and Abhidharma (doctrine), i.e., 
the threefold canonical baskets (Skt. Tripiṭaka; Pāli Tipiṭaka). From that time on, 
the Tripiṭaka served as the basic categorization of Buddhist literature. 
The last general conference was held in Kāśmīra under the auspices of King 
Kaniṣka, the Kuṣāṇa ruler (known in China as Great Yüeji), toward the end of 
the first century C.E., and itcentered on the Hinayana orthodoxy, the Sthāvira- 
Sarvāstivāda school. Though the historical veracity of this conference is not 
conclusive, the likelihood of its occurrence can be argued based on the detailed 
Abhidharma discussions recorded in the _Mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra,_^4 and especially 
in the epilogue left by its translator Xuanzang, as well as the historical fact of 
the massive Hindu reaction which spurred efforts to compile their literary legacy 
in the early second century C.E.^5 In any case, after the Fourth Council meeting 
in Kāśmīra, Kuṣāṇa monks began to reach the Chinese continent during the Late 
Han period.

#### The Synopsis between the Sanskrit Dīrgha

#### Āgama and the Pāli Dīgha Nikāya

The _Canonical Collection of Lengthy Discourses_ was one of the four Āgamas 
essential to the Sutra _-piṭaka_ that was preserved by the Dharmaguptaka school. 
To explain the nature of this Āgama, it is best to show the synopsis between the 
content of the _DīrghaĀgama_ and that of the _Dīgha Nikāya_ (DN), upheld by the 
Thera vāda school as part of the fivefold _sutta-piṭaka._ The Theravāda school 
prospered in Sri Lanka and its descendants in Southeast Asia (Burma, Thailand,

and Indochina), preserved the fivefold Nikāyas through the Pāli canonical lan- 
guage. The Dharmaguptaka school, one of the descendants of the Sthāvira- 
Sarvāstivāda school that prospered in Northern India, inherited the _Dīrgha Āgama_ 
as part of their Sutra _-piṭaka_ through the canonical language of Sanskrit or, more 
precisely, Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit.^6 
The fourfold Āgamas that constitute the Sutra _-piṭaka_ of the Hinayana ortho- 
doxy were preserved throughout the medieval period as part of the Mahayana 
Tripiṭaka corpus through the Chinese versions since the fifth century C.E.The 
following is a chart of the synopsis between the four Dharmaguptaka Āgamas 
originally in Sanskrit and the five Nikāyas (Pāli _sutta_ collections) preserved by 
the Theravāda school.

**Four Sanskrit Āgamas Five Pāli Nikāyas** 
(Dharmaguptaka) (Theravāda)

1. _Dirgha Āgama_ ( _Lengthy_ 1. _Dīgha Nikāya_ ( _Lengthy Discourses_ ) 
 _Discourses_ )
2. _Madhyama Āgama_ ( _Middle-length_ 2. _Majjhima Nikāya_ ( _Middle-length 
 Discourses_ ) _Discourses_ )
3. _SaṃyuktaĀgama_ ( _Mixed_ 3. _Saṃyutta Nikāya_ ( _Mixed Discourses_ ) 
 _Discourses_ )
4. _Ekottarikā Āgama_ ( _Gradually_ 4. _Aṅguttara Nikāya_ ( _Increasing Each 
 Increased Discourses_ ) _by a Doctrine_ )
 5. _Khuddaka Nikāya_ ( _Short_ 
 _Dis courses_ )

As can be inferred from this table, the Sanskrit _Dīrgha Āgama_ and the Pāli _Dīgha 
Nikāya_ have many synoptic parallels in their respective content, namely, between 
the thirty sutras of the _Chang ahan jing_ and the thirty-four _suttanta_ s of the Pāli 
_Dīgha Nikāya._^7 There are twenty-seven sutras that are identified with the twenty- 
seven _suttanta_ s, but differences in their respective ordering and arrangement of 
scriptures must be recognized. Seven _suttanta_ s^8 are omitted in the _Chang ahan 
jing,_ but this includes a sutra that is not found in the _Dīgha Nikāya._ Because of 
this close synoptic correlations, it is reasonable to assume that the Sanskrit 
_Dīrgha Āgama_ and the Pāli _Dīgha Nikāya_ had a common canonical matrix that 
could have been determined as standard during the Third Buddhist Council.

Translator’s Introduction

The _Chang ahan jing_ is unique in two ways. First, the editors of the Āgama 
in organizing the sutras set forth four major sections, reflecting their major con- 
cerns: (1) the centrality of Śākyamuni Buddha as the primary subject, (2) the 
importance of the Dharma and doctrine, (3) the resultant practice, discipline, 
and advanced spiritual states, and (4) a record of the cosmological origins of 
the world. Second, the “Sutra of Cosmology,” which is totally absent in the 
_Dīgha Nikāya_ of the Pāli canon, was added as the last text in the collection in 
order to present the Buddha’s teaching more effectively and attractively to a 
non-Buddhist Hindu audience. According to some scholars, the underlying prin- 
ciple of the _Chang ahan jing_ reflects a conciliatory impulse that was intended 
to bridge the original Buddha’s teaching (the ninefold or twelvefold categories 
of discourses) on the one hand, and early Maha yana Buddhist teaching and 
scriptures on the other.^9 
The correlations between the two scriptural traditions, the sutras of the _Chang 
ahan jing_ and the _suttanta_ s of the Pāli _Dīgha Nikāya,_ are presented below. In 
addition, the corresponding texts are noted at the beginning of each sutra in this 
translation.

Translator’s Introduction

#### Translators and Historical

#### Times

The translator of the _Chang ahan jing_ was the _śramaṇa_ Buddhayaśas, a native 
of Kāśmīra who moved to Khotan in Central Asia, where he resided for some 
time before he was invited to Chang’an specifically to engage in scriptural trans- 
lation. There are two stories of how Buddhayaśas was invited to Chang’an and 
what contribution his translation was to accomplish. 
Fifth-century China was divided into northern and southern political regions 
separated by the Yangzi River. In the north were Louyang and Chang’an, which 
were the two major government seats of the Han and Tang dynasties, as well as 
several other political and cultural centers. Since the north was dominated by 
the descendants of the five racially foreign regimes, resulting in the short-lived 
period of sixteen states, Buddhism had a fair chance to develop its influence 
despite competition from indigenous Confucian and Daoist traditions. Two cen- 
turies from the initial introduction of Buddhism to China during the Late Han 
period, Chinese Buddhists began to be aware that they needed more scriptural 
sources for deeper understanding as well as for consolidating their communities 
through Buddhist ethical and moral practice. 
According to one story, Buddhayaśas was invited to the capital by the ruler 
of the Late Qin, Yaoxing (r. 394–415 C.E.), with the assistance of Kumārajīva, 
his religious counselor. Kumārajīva (344–413) was a scholar-monk from the 
country of Kuccha in Eastern Turkestan. Born to Indian and Central Asian 
parents, he excelled in training in Buddhist studies in Kāśmīra and acquired lin- 
guistic skill in Chinese. He had been brought to Liangzhou as the captive of 
Fujian’s general, Lüguang, and was subsequently invited to Chang’an in 401 to 
serve as Yao xing’s religious counselor and lead the government’s Buddhist trans- 
lation project. Buddhayaśas had been Kumārajīva’s teacher on the Sarvāstivāda 
Vinaya (the _Daśabhāṇavāra-vinaya,_ the subject of Abhidharma treatises) more 
than two decades previously.^10 Because he had once been Kumārajīva’s teacher, 
Buddha yaśas was reverentially nicknamed the “red-bearded professor” or the 
“senior doctrinal professor” (Vaibhāṣika) in Chang’an. 
It is said that, in part, Kumārajīva needed Buddhayaśas’ help in collaborating 
on completing the translation of the _Daśabhūmika-sūtra_ ( _Sutra on the Ten Stages 
of the Bodhisattva Career_ ), and that the ruler Yaoxing also requested the _śramaṇa_

in 410 C.E.to translate both the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya ( _Dharmaguptaka-vinaya; 
Sifen lü; Vinaya in Four Divisions_ ) and the _Dīrgha Āgama_ of the same school. 
The Vinaya translation was completed 412 C.E.The next year, 413, Buddha - 
yaśas began to translate the _Dīrgha Āgama_ with Zhu Fonian, a _śramaṇa_ of 
Liang zhou, as co-translator, and the translation was completed that same year. 
As for the reasons the _Chang ahan jing_ originally belonged to the Dharma - 
guptaka school, we have four indirect proofs. First, the editorial point of view of 
the _Chang ahan jing_ itself coincides with the Dharmaguptaka tradition in which 
the principle of the centrality of the Buddha is emphasized in terms of veneration 
for Śākyamuni as founder of the religion. Second, the text displays a great emphasis 
on the merit to be accrued by the cult worship of the sacred relics enshrined in 
stupas (commemorative towers). Third, the text’s translator, Buddhayaśas, who 
also translated the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, was a _bhikṣu_ affiliated with the Dharma - 
guptaka school. Finally, the Vinaya text, especially its fifty-fourth chapter, refers 
to seven sutras that were included in the _Chang ahan jing_ , including the “Sutra 
of Buddhist Cosmology” that is not found in the Pāli _Dīgha Nikāya_.^11 
The second story comes from the introduction to the _Dharmaguptaka-vinaya,_ 
which gives a somewhat different version. Zhi Faling, a Chinese _śramaṇa,_ trav- 
eled to the Central Asia on the instructions of his master, Huiyüen, to search for 
Vinaya texts, and happened to meet Buddhayaśas in Khotan, where he was 
already renowned as a Mahayana Tripiṭaka master. With due respect, Faling 
requested him to visit Chang’an and accompanied him there, transporting Uighur 
textual sources. Faling’s master Huiyüen was a close friend of Kumarajīva, and 
is known to have organized the Lotus Association at Lushan in the Pure Land 
sectarian faith, whose adherents devoted their lives to the ideal of rebirth in the 
Pure Land. There was a growing concern among Chinese Buddhists at the time 
to consolidate their growing communities and regulate the conduct of their fol- 
lowers, and so there was a need for the Vinaya _-piṭaka._ As requested, Buddhayaśas 
immediately began to translate the _Dharmaguptaka-vinaya_ with the assistance 
of three hundred monks and scholars involved in the project. Zhi Faling is said 
to have had his own disciple, Huibian, participate in the sessions as he had excel- 
lent knowledge of Central Asian languages. The fact that active pursuit of Vinaya 
texts was the major trend of the time can be attested by the independent case of 
the monk Faxian’s (339–420) risky journey to India in search of Vinaya texts.^12

Translator’s Introduction

xx

Buddhayaśas did not extend his stay in Chang’an upon completion of the 
translation project and soon returned to Kāśmīra. Kumārajīva likely suffered an 
illness (Huangshi, thirteenth year) soon after completing the translation of the 
_Satyasiddhi-śāstra_ ( _Cheng shi lun_ ; _Treatise on the Establishment of Truth_ ) and 
passed away in 413 (Huangshi, fifteenth year). Yaoxing abdicated his rule in the 
seventeenth year of Huangshi (415 C.E.). Buddhayaśas is said to have sent the 
_Xukongyun pusa jing_ ( _Ākāśagarbha-sūtra; Sutra on Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva_ ) 
as a gift to the sangha of Liangzhou through a traveling messenger. In fact, the 
translation of this text ascribed to him is recorded in the _Chu sanzang ji ji (Col- 
lection of the Tripiṭaka Textual Records)_ (Taishō vol. 13, no. 405) compiled by 
Sengyou (445–518).

#### The Significance of the Text in the New

#### Taishō Tripitaka Edition

The _Chang ahan jing_ is placed at the very beginning of the first volume of the 
_Taishō shinshū daizōkyō_ ( _Taishō New Tripiṭaka Edition_ ) compiled by Japanese 
Buddhists from 1924–1934 (Taishō 13 to Shōwa 9). This may represent an 
entirely different reorganization of the Buddhist canon from all of the preceding 
Tripiṭaka editions. The format of the preceding editions were based on the clas- 
sification order of Mahayana first, Hinayana second, each of which was again 
divided into the order of Sutra, Vinaya, and Abhidharma texts. The historical 
legacy of the _Chang ahan jing_ should be examined as to what the text is meant 
to represent in the modern Taishō edition. 
The earliest reliable catalogue of Buddhist texts was due to the work of 
Dao’an (314–385), author of the _Zhongjing mulu_ ( _Comprehensive Record of 
the Textual Catalogues_ ), and Sengyou, author of the _Chu sanzang ji ji._ Of the 
two, Dao’an’s catalogues formed the core foundation of Sengyou’s enlarged 
record of textual catalogues. These two sets of catalogues thus mark the reliable 
beginning of all subsequent Chinese Tripiṭaka editions. 
By the turn of the fifth century, Buddhist communities in Chang’an began 
to exercise their own choices in the history of Buddhist affairs. This change was 
a natural development, because Buddhist leaders were more or less trained in 
Confucian academism or Daoist philosophical training. Dao’an was invited to 
Chang’an to serve as the religious counselor of Fujian (Yaoxing’s predecessor) 
from the capital of a southern state. Dao’an profoundly regretted that the Buddhist

communities in China had not been properly equipped with the Tripiṭaka divisions 
of Sutra, Vinaya, and Abhidharma. He actively promoted study on the Mahayana 
Wisdom sutras, especially the Prajñāpāramitā sutras, and he recruited talented 
young Buddhist converts to engage in exploration of their philosophical and 
spiritual meaning. It is within this historical circumstance that Kumārajīva was 
invited to Chang’an in 401 by Yaoxing (Fujian’s successor) as his religious coun- 
selor. Sengzhao (374–414), a young Buddhist convert from a Daoist background, 
became Kumārajīva’s dedicated disciple and quickly proved himself to be an 
excellent scholar-monk among the Chang’an academic community. His monograph, 
the _Zhao lun,_ was praised as exhibiting superb comprehension of _prajñā_ insight 
and the philosophy of emptiness ( _śūnyatā_ ),second only to that of his master. 
Sengzhao’s introduction to the _Chang ahan jing_ reflects Dao’an’s cherished 
objective. At the outset he calls attention to the Tripiṭaka canonical tradition:

The great teaching consisted of three [basic] divisions. For regulating 
physical and verbal behavior there is the collection of injunctive disciplines 
(Vinaya). For guiding human conduct by distinguishing good and bad 
there is the collection of doctrinal scriptures (Sutra). For differentiating 
subtle and delicate subject matter, there is the collection of analytical char- 
acteristics of the mental and conscious elements (Abhidharma). Thus, 
there came to be the three baskets of scriptures (Tripiṭaka). 
Buddhayaśas’ translation of the _Chang ahan jing_ was perhaps partial fulfill- 
ment of the goal sought by Dao’an. 
Following Dao’an’s and Sengyou’s catalogues, a series of records of Buddhist 
textual catalogues was compiled in the _Gezhong qinding zhongjing mulu_ ( _Buddhist 
Canonical Textual Catalogues_ or _Complete Buddhist Tripiṭaka Library,_ literally, 
“Great Textual Storehouse”). During the sixth century, the four catalogues came 
to exist under the auspices of four different regimes. Unlike Dao’an’s and Seng - 
you’s catalogues, which placed the texts by the translators’ names in chronological 
order, these state-supported enterprises adopted the new order of classification 
by placing the Maha yana Tripiṭaka catalogues first, followed by those of the 
Hinayana Tripi ṭaka. The short-lived Sui dynasty (which dissolved at the unification 
of north and south into an empire in 589), twice supported the compilation of 
the entire inclusive catalogues of the Tripiṭaka library: first, the _Sui Kaihuang 
lidai sanbao ji_ ( _Sui Kaihuang Record of the Threefold Buddhist Treasuresof the_

Translator’s Introduction

xxii

_Successive Dynasties_ ) in 598, followed by its revised edition, the _Renshou 
zhongjing mulu_ ( _Renshou Record of Textual Catalogues_ ) in 602, which stream- 
lined the preexistent catalogues and scrutinized the authenticity of each text. 
The _Renshou zhongjing mulu_ became the basic model of all subsequent Buddhist 
Tripiṭaka libraries. 
The filing of the catalogues of the Tripiṭaka library reached its apex during 
the Tang period. The dynastic enterprises successfully compiled seven major 
editions together with their respective records of catalogues. Any record of cat- 
alogues is supposed to provide not only the basic principles of textual classifi- 
cation and those texts already catalogued as authentic, but also include new 
translations and new discoveries as well as exclude suspicious and fraudulent 
texts. For instance, the _Kaiyuan shijiao lu_ ( _Kaiyuan Record of Buddhist Textual 
Catalogues_ ), compiled in 731, is said to have represented the best model format, 
so that all subsequent editions followed it in recording catalogues of hand-copied 
texts as well as printed texts. The classification order, however, was unchanged 
from the Sui-era _Renshou zhongjing mulu_ of 602, following the format of: (1) 
Mahayana sutras, (2) Mahayana Vinaya texts, (3) Mahayana Abhi dharma texts, 
(4) Hinayana sutras, (5) Hinayana Vinaya texts, (6) Hinayana Abhidharma texts, 
and (7) works written by the “wise and saints.” We know. therefore, that the 
_Renshou zhongjing mulu_ model and that of _Kaiyuan shijiao lu_ together became 
the standard format of the Buddhist Tripiṭaka library as a whole, of which very 
little had changed until the modern Taishō Tripiṭaka edition. 
This extremely conservative nature developed due to two reasons. First, 
toward the end of Tang dynasty the dissemination of the complete Tripiṭaka 
library was based on hand-copied texts made under government supervision. 
Second, from the Northern Song period on, the dissemination of the Buddhist 
Tripiṭaka was based on printed texts, for which printing blocks had to be carved, 
a laborious and expensive process. In the Northern Song, for instance, a 972 
decree stipulated the production of the entire set of textual woodcut prints and 
the carving of one hundred and thirty thousand woodblocks by the year 983. 
The dissemination of the Buddhist scriptures was under government supervision 
for centuries but gradually transferred to a number of Buddhist temples. While 
the main task of carving woodblocks was still carried out by dynastic enterprises, 
private temple versions began to appear and the distribution of texts was soon 
widely localized and even spread beyond the Chinese border. This was roughly

the history of the Buddhist Tripiṭaka library through the Song, Yuan, Ming, and 
Jing periods. 
The Taishō Tripiṭaka edition shows a striking innovation, especially in the 
change of classification order that follows the general historical development 
of Buddhism. The method of detailed examination of textual contents for the 
sake of new classifications also developed more precision due to modern schol- 
arship. First, the Taishō Tripiṭaka editors changed the order by placing the 
Hinayana Sutra _-piṭaka_ before the Mahayana texts. They set the Hinayana canon 
of the four Āgamas and individual texts bearing their strains in the first two vol- 
umes, under the Āgama section. Second, they created a new classification under 
the name of “original causality” to collect those texts in which the bodhisattva 
ideal and career is germinated in reference to early Mahayana history. Third, 
the remaining Mahayana sutras are classified, more or less, similarly to those 
of preceding editions, but each is assigned to different volumes by specifying 
type or class:

1. Prajñā section: Taishō Tripiṭaka vols. 5–8;
2. Lotus and Huayan section: vol. 9 (both groups) and vol. 10 (Huayan only);
3. Ratnakūṭa and Nirvana section: vol. 11 (Ratnakūṭa only) and vol. 12 (both 
 groups);
4. _Mahāsaṃnipāta-sūtra_ ( _Great Collection Sutra_ ) section: vol. 13;
5. Sutra collection (Hinayana and Mahayana) section: vols. 14–17;
6. Esoteric sutras section: vols. 18–21. 
 Fourth, the Taishō Tripiṭaka editors also placed the Vinaya- and Abhi dharma _- 
 piṭaka_ s after the Sutra _-piṭaka_ in the order of Hinayana first, then Mahayana:
7. Vinaya section: vols. 22–23 (all Hinayana) and vol. 24 (both Hinayana 
 and Mahayana);
8. Sutra expository treatise section: vols. 25–26 (partial Abhidharma);
9. Abhidharma section: vols. 27–29;
10. Madhyamaka-Yōgācāra section: vol. 30 (Madhyamaka only), vol. 31 (par- 
 tially Yogācāra), and vol. 32 (Yogācāra only);
11. Collected logical treatises section: vol. 32. 
 From here, the Taishō Tripiṭaka places texts written as commentaries on 
 sutras and treatises ( _śāstra_ s),^13 sectarian documents and writings, and so forth

Translator’s Introduction

up to the one-hundredth volume, but for the purpose of evaluating the legacy 
of the _Chang ahan jing_ , these can be excluded from consideration. 
Modern scholarship focuses on the fundamental spirituality of Śākyamuni 
Buddha, because his spiritual insight and evangelical life were the foundation 
of all the doctrines and practices that developed in the later history of Buddhism. 
In medieval China, every Tripiṭaka library started with the class of Wisdom texts 
(Prajñāpāramitā sutras) under the Mahayana category, beginning with the massive, 
six hundred-fascicle _Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra_ ( _Great Perfection of Wisdom 
Sutra_ ) translated by Xuanzang. In contrast, the Hinayana Āgamas, which are 
supposed to comprise the original, earliest sources and present Śākyamuni’s life 
and teaching as closely as possible to his original time and social context, were 
all buried amid thousands of files of textual catalogues or among the books and 
fascicles in the Hinayana section. Finally, after many centuries, the Taishō edition 
restored the proper place for the Hinayana Āgamas by moving this text to the 
very beginning of the collection. 
In his preface to the _Chang ahan jing_ , Sengzhao defines _Ahan_ (Āgama) as 
“the authority to which the laws return” ( _fa-gui_ ). The “authority to which laws 
return” means, in all probability, the profound collection of all that is good upheld 
by the secluded cloister of contemplative recollection ( _dhāraṇī_ ). These are made 
into the collection of sutras as the source of authority. It was in this sense that 
Chang’an’s Buddhist communities, by the turn of the fifth century, were motivated 
to have the Prajñāparāmitā texts translated rapidly, within a decade, and to also 
have the earliest canonical Sutra _-piṭaka_ translated along with the Vinaya texts. 
Most of all, this active motivation arose from the critical study of textual records 
of translation and visually corroborated reliable textual collections. 
Modern Buddhist studies began in the mid-nineteenth century, based on the 
method of text criticism and aided by scholars’ knowledge of Pāli, Sanskrit, 
Chinese, and Tibetan, and it has successfully promoted Buddhist studies through- 
out the world. It benefited contemporary Japanese Buddhists in publishing the 
Taishō Tripiṭaka library and its catalogue, with some success in reforming and 
improving the longstanding Tripiṭaka traditions. Nearly three quarters of a 
century after publication of the _Taishō shinshū daizōkyō,_ Dr. Yehan Numata and 
his associates established the project to put the entire corpus of texts collected 
in the Taishō Tripiṭaka into English translation, with the global cooperation of 
Buddhist scholars. When this massive project is completed, there will be a new

demand to build another edifice of the Buddhist Tripiṭaka library for the sake 
of Buddhist and human communities worldwide. Once again, the _Chang ahan 
jing_ will be highlighted as representing the earliest phase of Buddhism that 
marked its beginning.

#### Epilogue

I would like to make a few points regarding the way in which this translation 
has been accomplished. First, since the original Sanskrit text is no longer extant, 
I relied almost exclusively on the Pāli _Dīgha Nikāya_ and its English translation, 
especially that rendered by the founding members of the Pali Text Society, as 
the sole corroborative references for the Chinese text.^14 For instance, it is 
extremely difficult to identify from Chinese transliteration what a given proper 
name or proper noun might be in the Sanskrit original. Second, I preferred a 
straightforward style of narration to the Chinese idiomatic definitive style. As 
a cognate language of Sanskrit, though to a lesser degree, Pāli has an intricate 
case system to specify the contextual relationships between things that are 
referred to by words through case indicatives, whereas Chinese expression often 
relies on word order alone, without case indicative changes. Hence, in my English 
presentation of the _Chang ahan jing,_ I have relied on the English version of the 
_Dīgha Nikāya_ presented in scholarly translations of the text. This English version 
of the _Chang ahan jing_ may thus appear to be more like a translation made from 
the Pāli Nikāya than a directly rendered English version vis-à-vis the Chinese 
original. As English is not my native language, I did not consider that presenting 
the textual contents only through a grammatically learned second language 
would be successful. Due of the length of the original text, this translation will 
be presented in three volumes, to be published in sucession. Volume I contains 
sutras 1–10; Volumes II and III will contain the remaining twenty sutras, 11–30. 
A glossary will be included with the third, final volume of the translation. 
I looked for a model narrative format to translate foundational Buddhist texts, 
such as the _Chang ahan jing_. After searching for a feasible format among various 
samples of translations of Buddhist texts, I finally decided that it was best to follow 
the traditions established by the Pali Text Society in dealing with ancient Buddhist 
literature by means of modern languages. I am, however, obliged to assert that 
this translation has been produced totally based on my own understanding of 
Buddhism accrued through my lifelong study and practice of the religion.

Translator’s Introduction

Śākyamuni’s religion began with a dialectical insight underling the fourfold 
truths of the life process. While engaged in final revision of this translation, I 
personally encountered the messengers of old age, illness, and death, and my 
attention was drawn to these messagers more acutely because of my engagement 
in rereading the draft translation. It is my hope that readers of this text will 
realize the fundamental wisdom of Buddhist spirituality in regard to these serious 
matters. May the reader discover from this text his or her successful pathway 
toward liberation.

#### Shi Sengzhao

#### at Chang’an

The ultimate truth of religion transcends the words of naming and describing. 
It is because of this that wise and holy people remain in complaisant silence. 
The subtle meaning, [however,] cannot be communicated unless it is expressed 
by word. This is why Śākyamuni laid out his teaching, and the enlightened 
[Tathāgata] appeared in this world. The great teaching consisted of three 
[basic] divisions. For regulating physical and verbal behavior there is the 
collection of injunctive disciplines (Vinaya). For guiding human conduct by 
distinguishing good and bad there is the collection of doctrinal scriptures 
(Sutra). For differentiating subtle and delicate subject matter, there is the col- 
lection of analytical characteristics of the mental and conscious elements 
(Abhidharma). Thus, there came to be the three baskets of scriptures (Tri - 
piṭaka). The original source accommodated the particular divisions and yet 
united them in terms of the ultimate truth. Though the ways are varied, they 
all have one and the same goal. 
The injunctive disciplines make up the branch of Vinaya, which comprises 
four major divisions and ten sections. The analyses of mental and conscious 
elements ( _dharma_ s) make up the branch of Abhidharma, which comprises 
four major divisions and five sections. The branch of Sutras comprises four 
Āgamas: the _Chang ahan_ ( _Dīrgha Āgama_ ; _Collection of Lengthy Discourse_ ), 
the _Zengyi ahan_ ( _Aṅguttara Āgama; Discourses Increasing Each by One 
Doctrine_ ), which comprises four major divisions and eight sections; the 
_Zhong ahan_ ( _Madhyama Āgama; Middle-length Discourses_ ), which comprises 
four major divisions and five sections; and the _Za ahan_ ( _Saṃyukta Āgama_ ; 
_Mixed Discourses_ ), which comprises four major divisions and ten sections. 
The present _Chang ahan_ ( _Dīrgha Āgama_ ) comprises four major divisions 
and four sections, altogether thirty sutras, making up one composite unit. 
_Ahan_ (Āgama) in the Qin (Chinese) language means “the authority to 
which the laws return” ( _fa-gui_ ). The “authority to which laws return” means,

in all probability, the profound collection of all that is good upheld by the 
secluded cloister of contemplative recollection ( _dhāraṇī_ ). These are made 
into the collection of sutras as the source of authority. It is profoundly abundant 
and liberally rich, enclosing and yet filling far and wide, intelligently declaring 
the cases of fortune and misfortune by tracing [the deeds of] the wise and 
the foolish, giving judgment to whatever case it may be as to its truth or 
falsity, its difference or similarity, historically recording the destiny of success 
and the fate of failure in ancient and present times. There is no place, [even] 
in frontier regions, where the path is not followed or the law nonexistent, 
just as the two primordial principles [of _yin_ and _yang_ ] operate everywhere 
with the natural relation of things classified. Like the great ocean to which 
a hundred rivers return, the branch of Sutras is called the authority where all 
laws return. 
In exposition and analysis of the path of practice, whatever is recorded 
[in the sutras of this collection] is long and detailed. Because of this, the 
initial word of this collection is “Lengthy.” Whoever spends time with this 
source of authority may be lost for a long time but suddenly awaken at dawn. 
Right and wrong are difficult to distinguish, but once revealed they are like 
day and night. In announcement they are dark and vague, and under shedding 
light they are revealed like anything that has a shadow or an echo. The num- 
bers of eons ( _kalpa_ s), though they indicate distance [in time], are felt to be 
as near as the morning and evening, and the expanse [of space] in the six 
directions, though far-reaching, is seen [to be] as close as if before one’s 
eyes. This may be expressed as follows: reciting the great wisdom (the sutras) 
in a dark room, one may provide many blind [people] with the five extraor- 
dinary powers of vision, so that even without opening a window of the house, 
their knowledge permeates everywhere. 
The emperor of the great Qin, [endowed with intelligence] in viewing the 
essentials beyond peripheries, surpassing all others with his sublime deportment, 
thus nurturing his quiet wisdom, governs both the religious and secular but 
has been concerned with [the matter of the people’s] understanding about dif- 
ferent customs (culture) because of the subtle language of Buddhist religion. 
The duke of Jin, Yaoshuang, an official attached to the district subdivision as 
envoy of the Junior (right) General, is by nature straightforward, pure and 
gentle, endowed with a subtle mind transcending to reach anywhere, with

respectful concern for the great Dharma, with subtle insight arising sponta- 
neously, and on whom the [emperor] has bestowed his [favorable] attention. 
Thus the emperor appointed Duke Yaoshuang to conduct religious affairs. 
In the twelfth year of Hongshi (412 C.E.), the year order of Geng ( _shang- 
zhang_ ) and Xu ( _yan-mao_ ), the emperor requested the Tripiṭaka master from 
Kāśmīra named Buddhayaśas to translate the Vinaya _-piṭaka_ as one unit con- 
sisting of forty-five rolls. This was completed by the fourteenth year of Hong- 
shi (414 C.E.). From the fifteenth year (415 C.E.), the year order of Gui ( _zhao- 
yang_ ) and Chao ( _chifen-ruo_ ), the translation project of this _Chang ahan jing_ 
was completed. The _śramaṇa_ [Zhu] Fonian from the province of Liang 
assisted [with the] translation, and the Daoist Daohan, a citizen of Qin, [was] 
in charge of writing it down. 
At that time, those Buddhist monks ( _śramaṇa_ s) who were renowned in 
the capital as well as in the country of Xia (which represents Qin) were invited 
to participate in a series of editorial revisions. Respectfully receiving the 
statements on doctrines and confirming the absence of discordance, they 
made the essences illustrious, venerated the substances, and devoted their 
attention to retaining the intended meaning of the emperor. I happened to 
receive such auspicious opportunities and participated by listening on many 
occasions. Though I did not make any merit of [providing] good assistance, 
I am assigned to [conclude] this translation project. Thus I have made this 
brief note about the times and events to show to those wise people who will 
come to read this sutra collection.

### Sutra 1

### The Great Origin

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 14: Mahāpadāna Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was staying in the country of 
Śrāvastī in the Kareri-kuṭikā quarter of Jetavana Monastery, accompanied 
by one thousand two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s (disciples, monks). 
At that time, after the morning almsround was completed, some _bhikṣu_ s 
gathered at the hall adjacent to the Kareri-kuṭikā, and each engaged in dis- 
cussion with others, saying:

```
Venerable monks, the Unsurpassed Honorable One ( anuttarā ) is alone
extraordinary. His supernormal power is far-reaching and has wide and
great influence. Thus he [alone] knows those innumerable past buddhas
who entered into nirvana, terminating all the defilements and extin-
guishing obsessive conceptualization. Again, he knows the numbers
of eons ago when each of these respective buddhas appeared, their
titles and names, the families into which they were born, the kinds of
food of which they partook, whether their respective life spans were
long or short, and in what social contexts they experienced the change
between suffering and happiness. Again, he knows that each of those
buddhas upheld a certain respective precept, taught a certain doctrine,
realized a certain insight, acquired a certain understanding, and stayed
in a certain state of realization. How extraordinary is his knowledge,
venerable colleagues! The Tathāgata distinctly knows the nature of
things. Because he knows these things of the past, the heavenly gods
( deva s) come to talk to him.
At that time, the World-honored One was staying at a secluded place. As
his supernormal power of hearing was crystal clear, he happened to listen to
the foregoing discussion that went on among the disciples. He arose from
his seat at once, went to the Kareri-kuṭikā hall, and took his proper seat in
the set position. Then, knowingly, the World-honored One deliberately asked
```

```

```
his disciples, “O bhikṣu s, having gathered here, what have you been dis-
cussing?” The bhikṣu s recounted the subject of their discussion in detail.
Thereupon the World-honored One said to them:
Very good, very good. You have renounced family life, each equally
motivated by faith, and have been engaged in the practice of the path.
Of those prescribed practices, there are two kinds in general. First, the
preaching of the wise and holy; and second, the silence of the wise
and holy. O monks, the subject of your discussion must be formulated
in the following manner: “The Tathāgata’s supernormal power has
wide and great influence. Thus, he alone knows all events of the past
through innumerable eons. As he thoroughly understands the nature
of things, and because the heavenly gods come to talk to the Buddha,
these things are known to him.”
The Buddha then continued in verse:
The bhikṣu s assembled in the lecture hall,
Engaged in discussion on the nature of the wise and holy.
The Thus-come One remained in a secluded room,
Knowing all through his supernormal hearing.
Like the rays of the sun, the Buddha illuminates the world,
Discriminates the spheres of elements, and
Knows all things of the past.
He knows of the final nirvana of those perfectly enlightened [ones],
Their titles, names, ancestry, and their birthplaces.
Following their lives wherever they were in place and time,
The Buddha records everything
Through his witness by pure vision.
Heavenly gods appeared with great authority and handsomeness,
Descended to inform me of the nirvana of those three groups of
past buddhas,
Their titles and names, and the sound of mourning upon their
[entrance into] nirvana.
The Unsurpassed Honorable One above heaven [and earth]
Thus has recorded [the destinies of] the past buddhas.
```

```
Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

The World-honored One again addressed his disciples: 
O _bhikṣu_ s, do you wish [the Tathāgata] to impart my supernormal 
knowledge about the destinies of the past buddhas and their causes 
and conditions, or not? [If you do], I shall recount it for you. 
The disciples replied: 
World-honored One, this is the most opportune time, sir. We are your 
joyful audience. Indulge us, World-honored One! May your reverence 
transmit to us the wisdom of the past buddhas at once. We shall follow 
intently the instruction that is imparted, sir. 
The Buddha spoke to the _bhikṣu_ s: “Listen attentively, you should retain 
and consider well the following. I shall deliver analysis and explanation for 
your sake.” Thereupon the _bhikṣu_ s listened to the teaching. 
The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s: 
Ninety-one eons ago there was a buddha in this world; the Tathāgata 
and Arhat, Vipaśyin by name, appeared in this world. Again, O _bhikṣu_ s, 
a buddha next came forth thirty-one eons ago; the Tathāgata and Arhat 
Śikhin by name appeared in this world. Again, O _bhikṣu_ s, during that 
same eon, there was yet another buddha; the Tathāgata and Arhat 
Viśvabhū by name appeared in this world. Again, O _bhikṣu_ s, in the 
present auspicious eon ( _bhadrakalpa_ ) there appeared in this world a 
series of buddhas, Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni, and Kāśyapa by name, 
and now again, during this same auspicious eon, I myself have realized 
highest, perfect enlightenment ( _anuttara samyaksaṃbodhi_ ). 
The Buddha then continued in verse: 
Ninety-one eons ago, 
There was Vipaśyin Buddha; 
Next, thirty-one eons ago, 
There appeared Śikhin Buddha; 
In that same eon, 
There appeared Viśvabhū Tathāgata. 
Now, during this present auspicious eon,

```
A period of many innumerable nayuta s of years,
There came forth four great sages,
Known for their compassion for all sentient beings:
Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni, Kāśyapa, and Śākyamuni.
You should know that when Vipaśyin Buddha appeared, human life
span was as much as eighty thousand years. When Śikhin Buddha
appeared, human life span was as much as seventy thousand years.
When Viśvabhū Buddha appeared, human life span was as much as
sixty thousand years. When Krakucchanda Buddha appeared, human
life span was as much as forty thousand years. When Kanakamuni
Buddha appeared, human life span was as much as thirty thousand
years. When Kāśyapa Buddha appeared, human life span was as much
as twenty thousand years. Now that I have appeared, human life span
is less than a hundred years for most, with only a few living longer
than that.
Then the Buddha continued in verse:
In the time of Vipaśyin,
Human life span was eighty-four thousand years;
In the time of Śikhin Buddha,
Human life span was seventy thousand years;
In the time of Viśvabhū,
Human life span was sixty thousand years;
In the time of Krakucchanda,
Human life span was forty thousand years;
In the time of Kanakamuni,
Human life span was thirty thousand years;
In the time of Kāśyapa Buddha,
Human life span was twenty thousand years;
Now, I myself do not exceed
The current human life span of a hundred years.
Vipaśyin Buddha came from the class of kṣatriya s, bearing the family
name of Kauṇḍinya (Pāli Koṇḍañña). Śikhin Buddha and Viśvabhū

```
Buddha also came from the same kṣatriya class, bearing the same
family name. Krakucchanda Buddha came from the brāhmaṇa class,
bearing the name of Kāśyapa. Both Kanakamuni Buddha and Kāśyapa
Buddha came from the same brāhmaṇa class, bearing the same family
name. Myself, being the highest and most honorable, come from the
kṣatriya class and bear the name of Gautama.
```

The Buddha then continued in verse:

```
The tathāgatas Vipaśyin, Śikhin, and Viśvabhū,
These three perfectly enlightened beings
Came from the kṣatriya class with the family name of Kauṇḍinya.
The next three tathāgatas
Came from the brāhmaṇa class with the name of Kāśyapa.
Myself now, the highest and most honorable,
For the purpose of guiding sentient beings,
Come from the family of courage and valor,
Primary among all heavenly gods,
With the name of Gautama.
The first three perfectly enlightened beings
Came from the kṣatriya class,
While the second three tathāgatas
Came from the brāhmaṇa class.
Now I, myself, the highest and most honorable,
Come from the kṣatriya class with courage and valor.
Vipaśyin Buddha sat under a pippala tree and realized perfect enlight-
enment. Śikhin Buddha sat under a puṇḍarīka tree and realized perfect
enlightenment. Viśvabhū Buddha sat under a śāla tree and realized
perfect enlightenment. Krakucchanda Buddha sat under a śirīsā tree
and realized perfect enlightenment. Kanakamuni Buddha sat under an

I, the Buddha and Arhat, sat under an paṭala tree and realized perfect
enlightenment.

The Buddha then continued in verse:
Vipaśyin Tathāgata approached a pippala tree
And under that tree he realized perfect enlightenment.
Śikhin Tathāgata extinguished defilement under a puṇḍarīka tree;
Viśvabhū Tathāgata sat under a śāla tree
And there he realized the knowledge of his deliverance and
The freedom of supernormal power.
Krakucchanda Tathāgata sat under a śirīsā tree
And realized his omniscience, pure and genuine,
To be neither defiled nor attached.
Kanakamuni sat under an udumbara tree
And under that tree extinguished desire, sorrow, and affliction.
Kāśyapa Tathāgata sat under a nyagrodha tree
And under that tree terminated the origin of varied existence.
I, now, as Śākyamuni, sat under an paṭala tree
And as the Tathāgata, I have acquired the ten powers of insight,
Terminated many defilements,
Overcame the spells of [Māra], the Evil One, and
Have now been imparting great knowledge to the disciples.
The seven buddhas’ powers of exertion
Emitted rays of light that destroyed the darkness of ignorance.
Each of the buddhas sat under a tree
And there each realized perfect enlightenment.
Vipaśyin Tathāgata taught his Dharma before the assembly of disciples
on three occasions; attendance was one hundred and sixty thousand in
number at the initial assembly, one hundred thousand at the second,
and eighty thousand at the third. Śikhin Tathāgata also taught his
Dharma before the assembly of disciples on three occasions; attendance
was one hundred thousand in number at the initial assembly, eighty
thousand at the second, and seventy thousand at the third. Viśvabhū
Tathāgata taught his Dharma before the assembly of disciples on two
occasions; attendance was seventy thousand in number at the initial
assembly and sixty thousand at the second. Krakucchanda Tathāgata

taught his Dharma before the assembly of disciples on one occasion,
with an attendance of forty thousand. Kanakamuni Tathāgata taught
his Dharma before the assembly of disciples on one occasion, with an
attendance of thirty thousand. Kāśyapa Tathāgata taught his Dharma
before the assembly of disciples on one occasion, with an attendance
of twenty thousand. I now teach the Dharma before the assembly of
disciples on a single occasion, with an attendance of one thousand two
hundred and fifty.
```

The Buddha then continued in verse:

```
Vipaśyin excelled in the contemplation of names;
His insight was immeasurable.
He had no fear whatsoever in lecturing
Before the assembly of his disciples on three occasions.
Śikhin’s light [of wisdom] was immovable and
Thus destroyed all defilements.
No one could fathom his authority and virtue,
So immeasurable and great.
This buddha also held on three occasions
The assembly of his disciples
Gathered together from all places.
Viśvabhū terminated defilements, and
Many great sages assembled for his teaching.
His name was heard in all regions, and
The great name of his Dharma arose.
The disciples of the two assemblies propagated everywhere
The profound meaning [of his teaching].
Krakucchanda taught his Dharma
Before the assembly on one occasion,
And as their guide helped, with his compassion,
The disciples thus assembled
To overcome suffering and accomplish conversion.
Kanakamuni Tathāgata
Realized highest enlightenment and

Likewise taught his Dharma.
His physical features looked splendid, of purplish-gold color,
Every aspect of his physical form was equally perfect.
The disciples of his assembly spread his teaching everywhere.
[When Kāśyapa taught his Dharma before the assembly,]
There was no bristling of his hair,
Nor any confusion in his thought,
Nor any word of unnecessary repetition.
The disciples of his single assembly
Revered his contemplation of compassion in [perfect] quiescence.
I, from the Śākya family,
Superior to all the śramaṇa s,
Center of all heavenly quarters, most honorable,
Have the disciples of my single assembly.
It is the intention of my appearance before that assembly
To propagate the pure and genuine teaching.
With my mind filled with delight,
With all defilements extinguished,
I have no subsequent existence.
Vipaśyin and Śikhin taught their Dharma before three assemblies,
Viśvabhū Buddha taught before two assemblies,
The remaining four buddhas each taught [the Dharma]
On single occasions before an assembly of sages.
Vipaśyin Buddha had two disciples, Khaṇḍa and Tiṣya; they surpassed
all the other disciples. Śikhin Buddha had two disciples, Abhibhū and
Saṃbhava; they surpassed all the other disciples. Viśvabhū Buddha
had two disciples, Soṇa (Pāli) and Uttama; they surpassed all the other
disciples. Krakucchanda Buddha had two disciples, Sañjīva and Vi -
dhūra (Pāli); they surpassed all the other disciples. Kanakamuni Buddha
had two disciples, Bhiyyosa (Pāli) and Uttara; they surpassed all other
disciples. Kāśyapa Buddha had two disciples, Tiṣya and Bharadvāja;

Khaṇḍa and Tiṣya were the disciples of Vipaśyin;
Abhibhū and Saṃbhava were the disciples of Śikhin Buddha;

Sañjīva and Vidhūra were the disciples of Krakucchanda;
Bhiyyosa and Uttara were the disciples of Kanakamuni;
Tiṣya and Bharadvāja were the disciples of Kāśyapa Buddha;
Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana are my first-rank disciples.
Vipaśyin Buddha had a disciple by the name of Aśoka, who was his chief
personal attendant. Śikhin Buddha had a disciple by the name of Kṣema -
kāra [as his personal attendant]. Viśvabhū Buddha had an attendant dis-
ciple, Upaśāntā by name; Krakucchanda Buddha had an attendant dis-
ciple, Buddhija by name; Kanakamuni Buddha had an attendant disciple,
Sotthija (Pāli) by name; Kāśyapa Buddha had an attendant disciple,
Sarvamitra by name. Śākyamuni Buddha has an attendant disciple,
Ānanda by name.
```

The Buddha then continued in verse:

```
Aśoka, Kṣemakāra, Upaśāntā, Buddhija,
Sotthija, Sarvamitra, and Ānanda as the seventh;
They each became personal attendants
Of their respective buddhas and
Assisted them in various roles, endowed with goals and means.
Refraining from indolence day and night,
Benefiting themselves as well as others,
These seven wise disciples closely attended the seven buddhas,
Dedicated their service with delight, and
Quietly entered nirvana.
Vipaśyin Buddha had a son, Fangying by name; Śikhin Buddha had a
son, Apramāṇa by name; Viśvabhū Buddha had a son, Subuddha by
name; Krakucchanda Buddha had a son, Shangsheng by name; Kanaka-

Fangying, Apramāṇa, Subuddha, Shangsheng,
Lokanāyaka, Sanghasena, and Rāhula as the seventh;
These scions, successors of the heroic lineages of the buddhas,
Dedicated themselves to morality,
Delighted in charity, and
Had no fear of conscience before the sacred Dharma.
The father of Vipaśyin Buddha was Bandhumant, from a royal family
of kṣatriya s, and his mother was Bandhumatī. The city ruled by the
king was called Bandhumatī.
The Buddha then continued in verse:
The father, perfect-eyed one,
Was Bandhumant, the mother was Bandhumatī.
The city ruled by Bandhumant was Bandhumatī,
Where the Buddha taught his Dharma.
The father of Śikhin Buddha was Aruṇa, from a royal family of kṣa-
triya s, and his mother was called Prabhāvatī. The city ruled by the king
was Aruṇavatī.
Then the Buddha continued in verse:
Śikhin’s father was Aruṇa, and
His mother [was] Prabhāvatī.
While Aruṇa remained in the capital
His authority and virtue vanquished his enemies.
The father of Viśvabhū Buddha was Suppatīta (Pāli), from a royal
family of kṣatriya s, and his mother was called Yaśavatī. The city ruled

I was born to them.
These are the stories of the buddhas, their names, familial backgrounds,
and the places of their birth. How could a wise person, having listened
to these stories, not rejoice and give rise to a feeling of dedication?
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
Listen attentively, you should retain and consider well the following. I
shall deliver analysis and explanation for your sake. O bhikṣu s, you should
know the regularity of the buddhas. The bodhisattva Vipaśyin descended
from Tuṣita Heaven to enter the womb of his heavenly mother through
her right side, and remained therein in the state of mindfulness, his mind
undisturbed. At that moment, the earth trembled and a great ray of light
illumined the entire world. The illumination reached even to the region
where the sun and the moon cannot give their great illumination to every
sentient being. Even those sentient beings of the dark underworld could
see each other and recognize the place of their destiny. At that time the
light also illuminated the palace of the Evil One. Although illumination
was extended to all the heavenly beings, with Indra as their head, the god
Brahmā, śramaṇa s, brāhmaṇa s, as well as other sentient beings, only the
gods were not revealed because of their own rays of light.
The Buddha then continued in verse:
While heavy clouds gathered thickly in midair,
Bolts of lightning illuminating heaven and earth,
Vipaśyin descended and entered into his mother’s womb.
```

```
Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

The ray of light equally illuminated the regions 
Where the sun and moon cannot reach. 
There was hardly anyone 
Who did not receive the great illumination. 
The one thus impregnated is immaculate and stainless. 
This is the regularity of the buddhas. 
O _bhikṣu_ s, you should [further] know the regularity of the buddhas. 
Being in his mother’s womb, the bodhisattva Vipaśyin was steadfast 
with his concentration, his mind undisturbed. The four heavenly 
guardians of the four heavenly quarters took up halberds and protected 
the Bodhisattva. Neither human nor nonhuman [beings] could approach 
and disturb him. This is the regularity of the buddhas. 
The Buddha then continued in verse: 
The four princes (guardians) of the four quarters of heaven 
Were renowned for their authority and virtue. 
Commanded by the god Indra, 
They protected the Bodhisattva well. 
They took up the arms of the halberd and 
Always guarded him, without leaving his side, 
Against the approach of any [evil] human or nonhuman [being]. 
This is the regularity of the buddhas. 
The heavenly gods protected the Bodhisattva well 
As though nymphs guarding a heavenly palace. 
All the retainers of the gods were also thus delighted. 
This is the regularity of the buddhas. 
Again the Buddha spoke to the _bhikṣu_ s on the regularity of the lives of 
the buddhas:

```
The bodhisattva Vipaśyin descended from Tuṣita Heaven to enter into
his mother’s womb and abided there in concentration, his mind undis-
turbed, while his mother’s body was safe and in peace with no prob-
lems. With her wisdom increased, she examined her fetus and saw
the well-developing body of the Bodhisattva endowed with limbs and

senses as spotless as purplish-gold. It was like a [perfect] lapis lazuli
gem; an expert on examining its [perfect] transparency within and
without would find neither shadow nor flaw. This is the regularity of
the buddhas.
At that moment the Buddha continued in verse:
As pure as a gem of lapis lazuli and
As clear as the bright sun and moon,
The Honorable One remained in his mother’s body,
Disturbing not his mother’s gestation.
With her wisdom increased,
She examined her fetus and
Saw the body of her child like a golden image.
Her pregnancy was safe and peaceful.
This is the regularity of the buddhas.
The Buddha told the bhikṣu s:
The bodhisattva Vipaśyin descended from Tuṣita Heaven to enter into
his mother’s womb and abided there in concentration, his mind undis-
turbed. His mother’s mind was pure and genuine. She was free from
any thought of desire or from being burned by immoral desire. This is
the regularity of the buddhas.
At that time, the World-honored One continued in verse:
While the Bodhisattva abided in the mother’s womb,
Heavenly blessings increased,
Bestowed [upon the Bodhisattva] from the highest heavens.
The thoughts of the mother were pure and genuine,
With no thought of desire.
Forsaking sensual longing,
Unstained and unapproached,
She was free from the flame of immoral desire.
This is the regularity of the buddhas’ life-careers.
The Buddha [again] spoke to the bhikṣu s on the regularity of the buddhas:
```

```
Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

The Bodhisattva descended from Tuṣita Heaven to enter his mother’s 
womb and abided there in concentration, his mind undisturbed. His 
mother upheld the five precepts ( _pañca-śīla_ ) and her practice of austerity 
was pure and genuine. With her sincere faith, compassion, and goodwill, 
well fulfilled, with nothing but happiness, she was born in Trāyastriṃśa 
Heaven at the time of her body’s dissolution at the end of her life. This 
is the regularity of the buddhas. 
At that time, the World-honored One continued in verse: 
While carrying within her body 
The highest, most honorable among humans, 
Upholding the precepts with vigor, 
She was destined to gain 
A heavenly body in her future life. 
Because of this she is called the mother of the buddhas. 
The Buddha [again] spoke to the _bhikṣu_ s on the regularity of the lives of 
the buddhas:

```
When the bodhisattva Vipaśyin was born, he came from his mother’s
right side. At that moment the earth trembled and a ray of light illu-
minated the entire world. Just as when the Bodhisattva initially entered
his mother’s womb, the illumination reached even to the dark under-
world, benefiting every sentient being with its great illumination. This
is the regularity of the buddhas.
At that time, the World-honored One continued in verse:
When the prince was born, the earth trembled,
A ray of light illuminated everywhere without exception,
This world as well as the other worlds,
Above and below in all directions,
Thus granting the pure and genuine cause [of salvation].
Endowed with the sublime voice of rejoicing,
One after another the heavenly beings praised
The name of the Bodhisattva.
```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

The Buddha [again] spoke to the _bhikṣu_ s on the regularity of the lives of 
buddhas:

```
The bodhisattva Vipaśyin came from his mother’s right side at the time
of his birth and remained there in concentration, his mind undisturbed.
At that moment the mother of the Bodhisattva pulled down a tree branch
[to support herself], neither sitting nor lying down. Then the four heav-
enly guardians respectfully offered scented water and spoke to the
mother: “As was ordained, O heavenly mother, now the holy child is
born. May your ladyship be free from worry and sorrow.” This is the
regularity of the buddhas.
At that time the World-honored One continued in verse:
The mother of the Buddha
Neither took a seat nor reclined upon the ground,
But was steadfast in the precepts and
The practice of austerity.
Born in the house of nobility,
She never slackened in her exertion
While attended by heavenly beings.
The Buddha [again] spoke to the bhikṣu s on the regularity of the buddhas:
The bodhisattva Vipaśyin came from his mother’s right side at the time
of his birth and abided there in concentration, his mind undisturbed.
His body was immaculate, never subjected to defilement by filth or
evil thoughts. [It was] like a gem, pure and genuine, [which] when
expertly mixed with white paint neither affects nor is affected [by the
paint], because it is pure and genuine. It is the same with the Bodhi-
sattva’s emerging from his mother’s womb. This is the regularity of
the buddhas.
At that time the World-honored One continued in verse:
Like a gem, pure and genuine,
[When] mixed with paint [it] neither affects nor [is] affected [by the
paint],
```

```
Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

```
When the Bodhisattva emerged from his mother’s womb,
He was pure and spotless.
```

The Buddha [again] spoke to the _bhikṣu_ s on the regularity of the buddhas:

```
The bodhisattva Vipaśyin, at the time of his birth, came from his
mother’s right side and abided there in concentration, his mind undis-
turbed. Coming down to the ground from his mother’s right side, he
took seven steps and, without any help from others, glancing in all
directions, he raised his hand and declared: “Above heaven and below,
I alone am most honorable. I am here to save sentient beings from the
woes of birth, old age, sickness, and death.” This is the regularity of
the buddhas.
```

At that time the World-honored One continued in verse:

```
Just as a lion walks,
[The Bodhisattva] glanced in the four directions, and
A lionlike child, he took seven steps upon the ground.
Again, as with a great dragon’s movement,
[The Bodhisattva] glanced in the four directions, and
[Like] a dragonlike child, when born
He took seven steps on descending to the ground.
At the time of [his] birth,
The two-legged (i.e., human) Honorable One
Took seven firm steps, and
Glancing in the four directions,
Raised his voice to declare the termination of the suffering of life
and death.
At the very beginning of his birth,
He had no equal [but was] equal [only] to other buddhas.
He perceived the origination of life and death, and
That this life [would be] his last.
```

The Buddha [again] spoke to the _bhikṣu_ s on the regularity of the buddhas:

```
The bodhisattva Vipaśyin, at the time of his birth, came from his mother’s
right side and abided there in concentration, his mind undisturbed.Two

fountains sprang out, one warm and the other cool, as an offering for
the bathing of the Bodhisattva. This is the regularity of the buddhas.
At that time the World-honored One continued in verse:
When the two-legged Honorable One was born,
Two fountains sprang out as an offering
For the bathing of the Bodhisattva.
The infant, endowed with his perfect eyes,
Was bathed clean in [the water of] these fountains.
The two fountains sprang out naturally;
The water was very pure and clean;
One was a warm spring while the other was cool,
Both for the bathing of the Omniscient [One].
When the prince was born, his father, King Bandhumant, invited a host
of soothsayers who specialized in magical formulas to see the prince
and prophesy about his fortune or fate. The soothsayers came to see
the prince as instructed. Having noted the eminent marks the child bore
when they opened his clothing, the soothsayers told the king of his
fortune:
We have no doubt in our mind that whoever bears these marks is
bound to have one of two destinies. If he remains in household life,
he will become the universal ruler ( cakravartin ) who turns the sacred
wheel and will become king of all four quarters on earth. He will
acquire the four divisions of armies and will rule the land under the
right Dharma with impartiality, benefiting everything under the
heavens. He will spontaneously acquire the seven kinds of treasures
and, accompanied by a thousand brave and strong soldiers, he will
be able to overcome any foreign enemy [even] without [resorting
to] arms in punishment; thus he will keep the peace of all lands
under the heavens. Should he renounce household life and pursue
the path [of salvation], he is destined to realize perfect enlightenment
and be named by ten sacred titles of buddhahood.
Then the soothsayers said to the king:
```

```
Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

```
Your majesty, the prince bears the thirty-two eminent marks. We
have no doubt in mind that he is bound to realize one of two des-
tinies, sire. Should he stay in household life, he will become the
universal ruler who turns the sacred wheel. Should he renounce
household life, he will realize perfect enlightenment and be named
by ten epithets of buddhahood.
```

The Buddha then continued in verse:

```
The prince was born endowed with innumerable fortunes.
The soothsayers said:
“We have no doubt in our mind that,
Like a case predetermined in the book of legal codes,
The prince has two destinies, sire.
Should he choose household life,
He is bound to become a universal ruler
Who turns the sacred wheel.
He will spontaneously acquire
The seven kinds of treasures [that are] ordinarily difficult to obtain.
He will acquire the sacred wheel
Which is made of a thousand golden spokes,
With a golden thread attached around its outer edge.
When it is turned,
It can run to any place as though flying;
Hence it is called the first treasure, the heavenly wheel.
He will acquire the well-trained elephants
Endowed with seven tusks, huge and wide, and
As white as snow, capable of flying in midair.
This is called the second treasure, the elephant.
He will acquire horses that, when they run,
Can go any place under the heavens,
Leaving in the morning and
Returning in the evening for feed,
With shining hair and the voice of a peacock.
This is called the third treasure, the horse.
```

```
He will acquire the lapis lazuli gem, pure and genuine,
Which reflects a light that shines over the distance of a yojana,
Illuminating the night as brightly as the day.
This is called the fourth treasure, the divine gem ( maṇi-ratna ).
He will acquire the queen whose figure,
Voice, scent, taste, and touch have no equal,
Foremost among all women.
This is called the fifth treasure, the queen.
He will acquire men of wealth
Who, to their hearts’ content,
Make gifts of lapis lazuli gems and
All other precious stones.
This is called the sixth treasure, the treasury household.
He will acquire bands of armies, brave and strong,
Which can swiftly move back and forth as he commands.
This is called the seventh treasure, the military commander.
These are the seven treasures of the universal ruler, sire:
The wheel, the white elephant, the horse, the gems,
The woman, the wealthy men, and the army.
The prince will like these things and
Enjoy a life of fulfillment
With the five kinds of desire, and yet,
Just as an elephant decisively breaks its reins,
He will renounce household life and
Realize perfect enlightenment.
Your Majesty, this is the fortune, sir,
Due to this prince, Most Honorable among Humans,
Who will turn the wheel of Dharma in this world,
Without ceasing, even after his realization of the path.”
At that moment, the father-king [again] asked the soothsayers three
times with due courtesy, “May you also examine the thirty-two marks
of the prince and, naming them, explain their respective meanings.”
Then the soothsayers at once opened the prince’s clothing and explained
the thirty-two eminent marks: (1) even and flat soles of the feet, for

steady footing; (2) the two soles marked symmetrically with the symbol
of the thousand-spoked wheel; (3) webbed hands and feet like those
of a goose; (4) hands and feet as smooth and delicate as the fabric of
a heavenly robe; (5) unequaled delicate, elongated fingers and toes;
(6) wide-surfaced, rounded feet of pleasant appearance; (7) rounded
heels narrowing gradually to straight calves like those of a deer; (8)
well-connected ribs like the links of a chain; (9) a genital organ hidden
within folds [of skin], like that of a horse; (10) elongated upper limbs,
hands touching the knees even in an upright position; (11) each hair
growing from its respective root, coiling to the right, the color of lapis
lazuli; (12) bodily hairs coiling to the right, the color of navy blue,
growing upward; (13) a physical body of golden complexion ( suvarṇa-
varṇa ); (14) dust-repellent, delicate, tender skin; (15) symmetrically
even and round shoulders filled with vigor; (16) a chest marked with
the auspicious sign of a mirror-image svastika; (17) physical stature
twice as tall as a normal body; (18) well-developed seven parts of the
body (hands, feet, lower shoulders, and nape); (19) a wide and grand
body like a banyan tree; (20) rounded, pronounced cheeks like those
of a lion; (21) an upper torso straight and upright, lionlike in form;
(22) a set of forty teeth; (23) teeth of neat, square form and in good
alignment ( sama-danta ); (24) teeth having no spaces [in between];
(25) white and clean teeth; (26) a pure throat and palate fit for the best
of partaken food; (27) a wide and elongated tongue that reaches the
ears ( pra bhūta-tanu-jihvā ); (28) a beautiful, heavenly voice; (29) dark-
blue eyes; (30) twinkling eyes and eyelids like those of an ox; (31) a
curl of white hair on the forehead ( ūrṇā ), flexible and long, stretching
ten feet, coiling back to the right like a trumpet shell when stretched
and released; and (32) a protuberance on top of the head ( uṣṇīṣa ). These
are the thirty-two eminent marks of a buddha.”

The Buddha then continued in verse:

Do not leave traces of their passing on the ground.

Embellished with bright colors.
Like a nyagrodha tree,
His physical stature is equally wide and tall.
Marvelously hidden is the Tathāgata’s male organ
Like that of a horse.
In his body, well embellished with golden accessories,
All the other eminent marks are mutually reflected.
Though passing through this ordinary world,
Neither dust nor soil defiles his body,
Which bears the heavenly complexion,
Exceedingly soft and tender.
The royal canopy spontaneously covers his presence, and
His body, the source of the heavenly voice,
Is purplish-gold, as fresh as [lotus] flowers
Blooming for the first time on the surface of a pond.
The king asked the soothsayers, and
They respectfully replied to him,
Praising the eminent marks of the Bodhisattva.
The entirety of his body is enveloped
With bright light revealing all his limbs,
His feet and hands, externally and from within.
He tastes the essence of all foods;
His upper torso, upright without stooping,
The wheels of his soles are revealed, and
His voice sounds like that of a kalaviṅka bird.
Endowed with the form of rounded heels
Gradually narrowing toward straight calves,
This is the meritorious reward of his past destiny.
His upper arms and elbows,
Rounded and perfect, are nice to look at,
While his facial features are exceedingly handsome.
The honorable lion among humans
Surpasses all others in his might,
Both of his cheeks round and balanced,
```

```
Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

```
With the poise of a reclining lion.
The set of his teeth, forty in number, is regular and
Evenly aligned with no spaces in between.
His unearthly voice is marvelous and
Attracts everyone from far and near.
He stands upright without stooping,
Both hands reaching down to the knees.
His hands are evenly developed and soft.
It is the form of beauty ever endowed
To the honorable and best among all humans.
His bodily hairs each grow from respective roots,
His hands and feet are endowed with webbing.
He has a protuberance on top of his head,
Dark-blue eyes, twinkling,
Both eyelids moving,
Both shoulders bearing rounded fullness.
He is thus endowed with thirty-two eminent marks.
There is no imbalance of high or low
With his heels and straight calves,
Delicate like those of the deer.
As if the best of all heavenly beings descended to the earth,
Just as an elephant decisively tears away its reins,
He was prepared to have all sentient beings
Rescued from suffering,
Himself facing the cycle of birth,
Old age, sickness, and death.
Moved by his compassion,
He taught the Four Noble Truths,
Explained the meaning of the verses on Dharma, and
Had his disciples dedicate themselves to the Most Honorable One.
```

The Buddha [again] spoke to the _bhikṣu_ s:

```
When Vipaśyin Buddha was born, the heavenly gods hovered in midair
holding a white canopy and fans, thereby protecting him from coldness
and heat, wind and rain, dust and dirt.
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
The Buddha then continued in verse:
Having never before appeared among humans,
The Most Honorable One is [now] born as a two-legged being.
The gods pay him their respects
In offering the canopy and fans.
At that time the father-king provided the prince with four nursing
maids: the first fed him milk, the second bathed him, the third applied
scented oil to his body, and the fourth accompanied him in play. Joyful
in heart, they reared him diligently.
Thus continued the Buddha in verse:
With love and affection,
The nursing maids reared the prince;
The first feeding him milk,
The second bathing him,
The third applying scented oil to his body,
The fourth accompanying him in play.
The best of scented oils,
They applied to the Most Honorable among Humans.
When he had grown to adolescence, all the maidens of the country
never tired of looking at the young prince.
Here the Buddha continued in verse:
Adored by many with much respect
Like a golden image initially cast,
Men and women watched him attentively,
Never tiring of gazing at him.
When he had grown to adolescence, all the citizens, male and female,
adored him as if embracing and savoring the scent of a precious flower.
Here the Buddha continued in verse:
When the Most Honorable [One] was born,
He was adored by many with love and respect.
```

6a

```
Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

```
One after another they embraced him,
[Just as if] holding a precious flower and savoring its fragrance.
When the Bodhisattva was born, he did not blink his eyes, much like
the gods of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven. Because of the absence of blinking,
he was called Vipaśyin.
```

Here the Buddha continued in verse:

```
The best of all among the heavens did not blink,
Just like the gods of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven.
Staring at an object (i.e., form),
He contemplated it with insight.
Hence he was called Vipaśyin.
When the Bodhisattva was born his voice was exceedingly clear, tender
and graceful like the voice of a kalaviṅka bird.
```

Here the Buddha continued in verse:

```
Even as a Himalayan bird enhances its voice
With a diet of fruit juice,
So was the voice of the Honorable One
Clear and penetrating like that of the bird.
When the Bodhisattva was born, his eyes were able to see across the
distance of a yojana.
```

Here the Buddha continued in verse:

```
In reward for his past deeds, pure and genuine,
He obtained the miraculous light of the heavens.
His eyes we were able to see everything
Within the radius of a yojana.
After his birth, year by year, the Bodhisattva grew up to be a young
man and took up his office in the main hall, inculcating the path of
morality in the citizens, thus benefiting them. His name and virtue were
renowned even in distant regions.
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
The Buddha continued in verse:
While he was still a young man,
Taking up his office at the main hall,
He benefited the citizens by inculcating the path of morality and
Dealt with varieties of decision-making.
Because of this he was called Vipaśyin.
His knowledge, pure and genuine,
Is vast and detailed and
As profound as the great ocean.
He thus helped the people
To gladly accept his inculcation and
Increase and expand their wisdom.
Then the Bodhisattva, wishing to go on an excursion, ordered his atten-
dant, “Make the chariot be ready. I wish to visit that [royal] grove to
look at things and sites.”
Having prepared the chariot, the attendant reported, “It is ready,
sir.” The prince at once boarded [the chariot] and set out on the road
toward the grove. On the roadway, however, he saw an old white-haired
man, his teeth all gone, his face wrinkled, his body bent down and sup-
ported by a cane, his steps slow and weak, his breath labored. Looking
back at that old man, the prince questioned his attendant, “What kind
of person is that?”
[The attendant] replied, “That is an old man, sir.”
The prince again asked, “What does it mean to be old?”
The attendant replied, ‘Sir, it means that the span of life is approach-
ing its end, leaving only a limited duration of time to live. This is called
old age, sir.”
The prince asked again, “I too will become like this and am unable
to escape it, is this not so?”
The attendant replied, “Yes, sir. Whosoever is born is bound to
become old. There is no difference between rich and poor [in this
regard], sir.”
At that moment the prince lost interest [in the excursion]. He told
the attendant to turn the chariot around at once and return to the palace.
```

6b

```
Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

```
While withdrawing in contemplative silence, he thought to himself,
“This suffering of old age must also be with me.”
```

Here the Buddha again continued in verse:

```
Having seen an old man
Whose life was nearing the end,
Walking with feeble steps,
Supported only by his cane,
The Bodhisattva thought to himself:
“I too cannot escape this fate.”
At that time the father-king questioned the attendant, “Did the prince
enjoy his excursion?”
[The attendant] replied, “No, sire.” The king asked why. The atten-
dant replied, “Sire, we encountered an old man on the roadway. The
prince was not pleased because of that, sir.”
At that moment, the father-king did not say anything to the attendant
but thought to himself:
Once, when a group of soothsayers prophesied the prince’s fortune,
they told me that he was bound to renounce household life. Now
he is unhappy with his life here. Is there not some means by which
to change his feeling? I must contrive some sort of expediency, such
as to place his new quarters in the rear part of the palace. Let him
enjoy his five senses fully, distracting his mind, thereby preventing
him from leaving household life.
At once the king had the prince’s new quarters attractively decorated
and assigned selected palace ladies to entertain him.
```

Here the Buddha continued in verse:

```
Having listened to the words of the attendant,
The father-king contrived an expediency
To have the prince’s quarters decorated and
To attract his five senses with increased entertainment,
Hoping to prevent him from giving up household life.
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
The prince later ordered his attendant to again prepare a chariot and
visited the outside world on an excursion. [This time] he met an ailing
man. The man’s body was weakened, his belly distended, his face was
dark, he lay amid his own excrement and filth with no one attending
him, and his illness was so serious that he could not speak. The prince,
asked his attendant, “What kind of person is this?”
The attendant replied, “He is a sick man, sir.”
The prince asked again, “What is meant by ‘sick’?”
The attendant replied: “Sir, it means that many sharp pains torment
an ailing person, making it uncertain as to whether or not he may live.
Hence this is called sickness, sir.”
The prince asked, “I too will become like this and am unable to
escape it, is that not so?”
The attendant replied, “Yes, sir. Whoever is born is bound to become
sick. There is no difference between the noble and the humble [in this
regard], sir.”
At that moment, the prince lost interest [in the excursion]. He told
the attendant to turn the chariot around at once and return to the palace.
While withdrawing in contemplative silence, he thought to himself,
“This suffering of illness must also be with me.”
Here the Buddha again continued in verse:
Having seen a man with chronic illness
Whose complexion was emaciated and dark,
The Bodhisattva withdrew in silent contemplation,
Thinking to himself, “I too cannot escape this fate.”
At that time the father-king questioned the attendant, “Did the prince
enjoy his excursion?”
He replied, “No, sire.” The king asked again as to why. The attendant
replied, “Sire, we encountered an ailing man on the roadway. The
prince was not pleased because of that, sir.”
At that moment, the father-king did not question the attendant again
but thought to himself:
```

he is unhappy with his life here. Is there not some means by which

increase his entertainment with music and dance, distracting his
mind, thereby preventing him from leaving household life.
At once, [the king] had the new quarters attractively decorated and
assigned selected palace ladies to entertain the prince.
```

Here the Buddha continued in verse:

```
Form, sound, smell, taste, and touch
Are delicate and pleasurable.
As the merit due to the Bodhisattva,
He thus enjoyed his life among these pleasures.
Again, on another occasion, the prince ordered his attendant to prepare
a chariot and visited the outside world on an excursion, but he encoun-
tered a dead man on the roadway. The family and relatives, lamenting
and crying loudly, went out of the city in funeral procession, with var-
ious banners to the front and rear.
The prince again questioned his attendant, “What is this man?” He
replied: “This is a dead man, sir.”
The prince asked, “What is meant by death?” The attendant replied:
Sir, it means extinction, which is preceded by the ceasing of the
breath, next the loss of warmth, and then the dissolution of the
senses. The living and the dead are in [totally] different worlds.
This [completely] separates one from his household. Hence, this is
called death, sir.
The prince once again asked, “I too will become like this and be unable
to escape it, is that not so?”
The attendant replied, “Yes, sir. Whosoever is once born is bound
to die. There is no difference between the noble and the humble [in
this regard], sir.”
```

```

At that moment, the prince lost interest [in the excursion] and told
the attendant to turn the chariot around at once and return to the palace.
Withdrawing in contemplative silence, he thought to himself, “This
suffering of death must also be with me.”
Here the Buddha again continued in verse:
Having seen a dead man for the first time, and
Knowing the rebirth of the dead,
He withdrew in silent contemplation,
Thinking, “I too cannot escape this fate.”
At that time the father-king asked the attendant, “Did the prince enjoy
his excursion?” He replied, “No, sire.”
The king asked again as to why. The attendant replied, “Sire, we
encountered a dead man on the roadway. The prince was not pleased
because of that, sir.”
At that moment, the father-king did not question the attendant any
more but thought to himself:

he is unhappy with his life here. Is there some means to change his

assigned selected palace ladies to entertain the prince.
Here the Buddha continued in verse:
The young prince, widely renowned,
Surrounded by palace ladies,
Enjoyed the pleasures of the five senses,
Just like the god Indra.
Again, on another occasion, the prince ordered his attendant to prepare
a chariot and visited the outside world on an excursion. He encountered
```

7a

```
Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

a wandering mendicant ( _śramaṇa_ ) on the roadway. He wore a _bhikṣu_ ’s 
_saṃghāṭī_ robe and with his almsbowl in hand walked with his eyes 
cast down on the road. 
The prince at once asked the attendant: “What is this man?” He 
replied, “This is a _śramaṇa_ , sir.” 
The prince asked, “What is meant by _śramaṇa_ ?” The attendant 
replied:

```
Sir, it means that the man has renounced his familial relations, having
gone forth from household life. He is engaged in the practice of
religion, controlling his senses and preventing himself from being
drawn to external objects of desire. Due to his compassion, he
refrains from any injurious action, neither entrapped by worries of
suffering, nor delighted in experiencing pleasure; long persevering
like the earth, hence he is called śramaṇa , sir.
```

The prince said:

```
Very good. This man’s path must be true and right, transcending
the world of dust and dirt forever. Delicate and subtle, noble and
humble, I consider it most satisfactory!
```

At once he instructed the attendant, “Turn the chariot around and stop 
next to that man.” Thereupon he questioned the wandering mendicant, 
“Having shaven your hair and beard, donned a _saṃghāṭī_ robe, and car- 
rying an almsbowl in your hand, what do you seek?” The _śramaṇa_ 
replied:

```
Whosoever has renounced family life should be concerned with
restraining his mind and will, transcending worldly things. Helping
sentient beings with compassion, yet not being drawn to them, with
an unprejudiced mind and a mind of quiescence, he concentrates
on the practice of the path.
```

The prince responded, “Very good. This path of yours is most true and 
right.” Next he said to his attendant, “Take my garment and the chariot, 
and return to convey my words to the king”:

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

```
I will shave my hair and beard in this place, wear the mendicant’s
three robes, leave household life, and practice the path of religion.
The reason [for this] is that I am concerned with restraining my
mind and will, transcending worldly things; I wish to keep my mind
pure and genuine, thereby learning the method of the path.
Thereupon the attendant turned the chariot [toward the palace] in order
to convey the prince’s message to his father, the king. Subsequently,
the prince shaved his hair and beard and donned the three mendicant
robes, thus accomplishing his renunciation of household life.
The Buddha told the bhikṣu s:
The prince saw an aged and ailing person and came to realize the facts
of suffering and agony. When he saw a dead person, he lost his attach-
ment to the ordinary world. But as soon as he saw a śramaṇa he at
once achieved a profound spiritual breakthrough. When he alighted
from his chariot he tempered his stride, proceeding at one half his reg-
ular pace, and removed his garments of bondage. This is the true renun-
ciation of family life. This is the true withdrawal from the ordinary
world. Then, having shaved his hair and beard, he donned a saṃghāṭī
robe, and with an almsbowl in hand he went forth to practice the path.
The countrymen said to each other:
This must be the true path, because it has caused even the prince to
decide to forsake the splendor of his career and position. This resulted
in the occurrence of many similar renunciations. From throughout
the country, there then came to the prince eighty-four thousand cit-
izens, who became his disciples, renouncing family life, and entering
into the practice of the path.
The Buddha then continued in verse:
Having heard that [the prince] chose
The profound and sublime Dharma,
Many followed his lead
In renouncing their family life.
```

```
Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

Distancing themselves from 
The bondage of indebtedness and love, 
They were freed from the cause of attachment.

Thereupon, accepting these new converts and allowing them to accom- 
pany him, the prince wandered from village to village, from country 
to country, promulgating his teaching wherever he happened to stop. 
Wherever he sojourned, people invariably offered four kinds of support 
(i.e., food and drink, robes or cloth, bedding, and medicine) out of 
respect and honor. The Bodhisattva thought to himself:

```
I have been traveling with a host of disciples among the citizens of
various countries, but I no longer enjoy the congestion and noise.
I must find ways to leave these crowds and seek the ultimate path
in some quiet location.
```

Later on, the prince accomplished his wish of solitary pursuit and con- 
centrated on his practice in a secluded place. But again he was pressed 
by a thought:

```
It is a pity to see that all living beings remain always in the darkness
of ignorance and face a variety of dangers, whether of birth, old
age, illness, or death; in this darkness all these forms of suffering
occur at once, with death here and rebirth there, death there and
rebirth here. Because this aggregate (i.e., physical and mental ele-
ments) is itself suffering, the cycle of sansaric life is endless. I will
someday accomplish a thorough understanding of this aggregate
that is by nature suffering, and thereby [once and for all] bring the
suffering of birth, old age, and death to total cessation.
```

Again the prince thought to himself:

```
In following or in depending upon what does the process of birth and
death arise? Examining through analytical insight the cause of this
arising, I see it this way: Following birth ( jāti ) there arises the process
of old age and death. Birth is the indirect causal condition of the
process of old age and death ( jarāmaraṇa ). Birth arises following a
```

```
7b
```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

```
will-to-becoming ( bhava ); the will-to-becoming is the condition of
birth. The will-to-becoming arises following an act of grasping
( upādāna ); the act of grasping is the condition of the will-to-becom-
ing. The act of grasping arises following attachment or thirstlike
craving ( tṛṣṇā ); thirstlike craving is the condition of an act of grasp-
ing. Thirstlike craving arises following sensation or feeling ( vedanā );
sensation is the condition of thirstlike craving. Sensation arises fol-
lowing sense contact ( sparśa ) [with an object]; sense contact is the
condition of sensation. Sense contact arises following the operations
of the six sense faculties ( āyatana ) (i.e., sight, hearing, smell, taste,
touch, and thought); the sixfold sense operations are the condition
of sense contact. The sixfold sense operation arises following a
mental and physical process ( nāma rūpa ); a mental and physical
process is the condition of the sixfold sense operation. A mental
and physical process arises following consciousness ( vijñāna ); con-
sciousness is the condition of a mental and physical process. Con-
sciousness arises following the forces of disposition ( saṃskāra );
the forces of disposition are the condition of consciousness. The
forces of disposition arise following ignorance ( avidyā ). In regard
to the truth of the foregoing dependent origination ( pra tītya -
samutpāda ), ignorance is the condition of the forces of disposition.
Thus, depending on the state of ignorance, there arise the forces of
disposition. Depending on the forces of disposition, there arises
consciousness. Depending on consciousness, there arises a mental
and physical process. Depending on a mental and physical process,
there arises a sixfold sense operation. Depending on the sixfold
sense operation, there arises sense contact (with an object). Depend-
ing on sense contact, there arises sensation (sense perception).
Depending on sensation, there arises thirstlike craving. Depending
on this craving, there arises the act of grasping. Depending on grasp-
ing, there arises a will-to-becoming. Depending on the will-to-
becoming, there arises birth. Depending on birth, there arises the
process of old age, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering,
and agony. This aggregate that is suffering in itself arises on the
basis of birth. This is called the causal aggregate of suffering. When
```

```
Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

```
the Bodhisattva contemplated this causal aggregate of suffering,
there arose in him knowledge, vision ( cakṣus ), awareness, wisdom,
insight, and testimony (experience).
```

Then the Bodhisattva again thought to himself:

```
In the absence of what can I say that there is no more process of
old age and death? In the cessation of what does the process of old
age and death cease to be? Examining the cause of this cessation
through [analytical] insight, I see it this way: When birth is absent,
there is no more process of old age and death; in the cessation of
birth, the process of old age and death ceases to be. When the will-
to-becoming is absent, there is no more birth; in the cessation of
the will-to-becoming, birth ceases to be. When there is no act of
grasping, there is no more will-to-becoming; in the cessation of
grasping, the will-to-becoming ceases to be. When there is no thirst-
like craving, there is no more act of grasping; in the cessation of
thirstlike craving, the act of grasping ceases to be. When there is
no sensation or feeling, there is no more thirstlike craving; in the
cessation of sensation, thirstlike craving ceases to be. When there
is no sense contact, there is no more sensation or feeling; in the ces-
sation of sense contact, sensation ceases to be. When there is no
sixfold sense operation, there is no more sense contact; in the ces-
sation of the sixfold sense operation, sense contact ceases to be.
When there is no mental and physical process, there is no more six-
fold sense operation; in the cessation of the mental and physical
process, the sixfold sense operation ceases to be. When there is no
consciousness, there is no more mental and physical process; in the
cessation of consciousness, the mental and physical process ceases
to be. When there are no forces of disposition, there is no more con-
sciousness; in the cessation of the forces of disposition, consciousness
ceases to be. When there is no ignorance, there are no more forces
of disposition; in the cessation of ignorance, the forces of disposition
cease to be.
This means that in the cessation of ignoance, the forces of dis-
position cease to be. In the cessation of the forces of disposition,
```

```

consciousness ceases to be. In the cessation of consciousness, the
mental and physical process ceases to be. In the cessation of mental
and physical process, the sixfold sense operation ceases to be. In
the cessation of the sixfold sense operation, sense contact ceases to
be. In the cessation of sense contact, sensation or feeling ceases to
be. In the cessation of sensation, thirstlike craving ceases to be. In
the cessation of thirstlike craving, the act of grasping ceases to be.
In the cessation of grasping, the will-to-becoming ceases to be. In
the cessation of the will-to-becoming, birth ceases to be. In the ces-
sation of birth, the process of old age, death, sorrow, lamentation,
suffering, and mental agony ceases to be.
When the Bodhisattva contemplated the cessation of the causal aggre-
gate of suffering, there arose in him knowledge, vision, awareness,
wisdom, insight, and testimony (or experience). At that time, the Bodhi-
sattva contemplated the twelvefold chain of causation ( pra tītya -
samutpāda ) in accordance with the conformative course toward phe-
nomenalization as well as in accordance with the opposite course
toward dephenomenalization. In these dual processes, he thus accom-
plished the ultimate way of knowing things as they really are and seeing
things as they really are. On that single seat where he sat, the Bodhi-
sattva realized highest, perfect enlightenment.
The Buddha then continued in verse:
The following is the theory taught before the bhikṣu s—
Listen to this very attentively.
When the Bodhisattva of olden times
Investigated the Dharma that had never before been learned,
He questioned:
“Dependent on what condition and in what cause
Does the process of old age and death arise?”
Having examined the matter in the right way,
He realized that its origin is in the [fact] of birth.
“Dependent on what condition or in what cause
Is the origin of birth?”
```

```
Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

Having thought in such a manner, 
He realized that birth arises 
Depending on the will-to-becoming. 
Grasping this or grasping that, 
The will-to-becoming is reinforced and 
Becomes stronger from one [stage] to another. 
Because of this reinforcement, 
The Tathāgata explained that the will-to-becoming 
Arises depending on the act of grasping. 
Just as a pile of filthy garbage on the surface of water (i.e., the 
aggregates) 
Floats on the stream driven by a gust of wind (i.e., strong desire and 
attachment), 
So too does the act of grasping 
Reach far and wide 
Through the force of strong thirstlike craving. 
This thirstlike craving arises depending on feeling, 
The origin of all nets of suffering, 
Pain and pleasure are respectively expanded in accordance with 
The force of attachment. 
“Dependent on what and in what 
Is the origin of sensation?” 
Having thought in this way, 
He realized that sensation arises depending on sense contact. 
“Dependent on what and in what 
Is the origin of sense contact?” 
Having thought in this way, 
He realized that sense contact 
Arises depending on the six sense operations. 
“Dependent on what and in what 
Is the origin of the six sense operations?” 
Having thought in this way, 
He realized that the six sense operations 
Arise depending on the mental and physical process.

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
“Dependent on what and in what
Is the origin of the mental and physical process?”
Having thought in this way,
He realized that the mental and physical process
Arises depending on consciousness.
“Dependent on what and in what
Is the origin of consciousness?”
Having thought in this way,
He realized that consciousness
Arises depending on the forces of disposition.
“Dependent on what and in what
Is the origin of the forces of disposition?”
Having thought in this way,
He realized that the forces of disposition
Arise depending on ignorance.
The foregoing dependent origination is called “true cause.”
When one examines causal relation
Through insight and expediency,
He is able to perceive the root of dependent origination.
Suffering is neither a product of the wise and holy,
Nor is it existent without cause and condition.
Because it has causes and conditions,
The phenomenon of suffering is subject to change, and
Hence it is the object that can be terminated or
Removed by the wise and holy.
When ignorance ceases,
Neither then are there the forces of disposition.
When the forces of disposition are absent,
Neither is there consciousness.
When consciousness ceases,
Neither is there mental and physical process.
When mental and physical process has already ceased,
Neither is there the sixfold sense operation.
When the sixfold sense operation ceases,
Neither is there sense contact.
```

8a

```
Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

When sense contact ceases, 
Neither is there sensation. 
When feeling ceases, 
Neither is there thirstlike craving. 
When thirstlike craving ceases, 
Neither is there grasping. 
When grasping ceases, 
Neither is there the will-to-becoming. 
When the will-to-becoming ceases, 
Neither is there birth. 
When birth ceases, 
Neither is there the aggregate of suffering, 
Such as old age and death. 
The entire mass of suffering ceases to be forever. 
The causality of twelve-limbed dependent origination, 
As taught by the wise, is very profound, 
Difficult to see, and difficult to recognize. 
The Buddha alone thoroughly understands 
The way in which things 
Arise through depending on another, and 
In which things cease to be through the absence of another. 
If one thoroughly investigates this causal linkage, 
There arises no sixfold sense operation. 
Whoever sees the causality of dependent origination thoroughly 
Will not seek a teacher. 
He will be thoroughly liberated 
From desire and thirstlike craving in regard to the aggregates, 
The sphere of realities, and the sense faculties. 
He is worthy of receiving all kinds of offerings and 
Repaying the donor’s charity. 
If one acquires four kinds of rhetorical excellence (i.e., on rules, 
meanings, interpretations, and explanations) 
He will reach unshakable certainty, 
Will be able to be rid of all bondage, and 
While having extinguished it,

```

```
Will yet have no slackening whatsoever.
The five aggregates, namely,
Form, feeling, ideation,
Forces of disposition, and consciousness,
Are like an old cart.
When one contemplates this matter attentively,
He will be able to realize perfect enlightenment
Just as a bird flies freely in midair
In accordance with the winds of east and west.
The Bodhisattva is able to terminate
The bondage of various defilements
Just as the wind flowing through a light robe
Sheds its dust.
Vipaśyin Buddha was staying at a secluded place and
Contemplated the foregoing matters, namely,
“Dependent on what condition
Does the process of old-age and death arise?” and
“Dependent on what cause does that process cease?”
Having successfully completed
His contemplation on these matters,
He realized the insight that is true and genuine.
He realized that the process of old age and death
Arises depending on birth.
But when birth ceases,
The process of old age and death also ceases.
When Vipaśyin Buddha initially accomplished the path, he frequently
practiced two types of contemplation: first, contemplation in the state
of peace and comfort; and second, contemplation in the state of tran-
scendence.
Here the Buddha continued in verse:
With none as his equal,
The Tathāgata often practiced two types of contemplation:
That of peace and comfort and that of transcendence.

Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

The Sage crossed over to the yonder shore and 
Liberated his mind by terminating all defilement. 
Ascending the mountaintop, 
He glanced in all directions. 
Hence he was called Vipaśyin. 
The light of great insight removes darkness 
Just as a light illumines itself through a reflective mirror. 
He removed sorrow and agony for all people 
By extinguishing the suffering of birth, old age, and death.

Vipaśyin Buddha, in his secluded place, again thought to himself:

```
Though I have now accomplished this highest Dharma, as it is pro-
found and subtle, it is difficult for ordinary people to understand
and difficult for them to perceive. This Dharma is quiescent, pure
and genuine; it can only be known by a person of insight, and hence
it cannot be attained by any common person or fool. People have
different capacities for patience, different views of things, different
responses to perceptions, and different practices. Hence, they are
oriented toward those things and goals that are in their own interest,
each devoting himself to that with which he is accustomed. Because
of this, they cannot fathom this profound truth of dependent origi-
nation, nor can they understand why nirvana increases when thirstlike
craving diminishes. Even if I try to teach this Dharma, they will
necessarily not only fail to understand it but also, to the contrary,
will be increasingly irritated through the attendant sense contact
(i.e., hearing the Dharma).
```

Having thought in this manner, he once again returned to his silence 
and did not try to teach the Dharma to anyone. 
Then the god Brahmā, knowing what Vipaśyin Tathāgata had been 
thinking, immediately thought:

```
It is a pity that the people of this world now falter toward destruction.
Although Vipaśyin Buddha has been able to realize this profound
Dharma, he is not inclined to teach it to the people.
```

```

```

```
In an instant, as swiftly as a wrestler bends his arm and straightens it,
Brahmā descended from his heavenly palace in and stood before
[Vipaśyin] Buddha. With a reverential gesture, honoring [Vipaśyin by
lowering] his forehead [to his feet], he withdrew to one side. Then the
god Brahmā, kneeling with his right knee on the ground and with both
palms together, spoke to [Vipaśyin] Buddha:
May I make a request of you, O World-honored One? Teach the
Dharma to the world when the time comes. At this time, the people
of this world, affected by various defilements, have become insincere
and frivolous, their senses drawn completely to their own profit.
Their nature must be reformed and made more respectful [in regard
to religion]; [they should] fear committing grave transgressions for
which there can be no expiation even in their life to come, to thereby
restrain them from [committing] evil deeds while encouraging them
to promote good deeds.
The Buddha replied to the god Brahmā:
You are right. What you have said is indeed correct. But may I tell
you what I have thought myself in my secluded place? The right
Dharma I have realized is extremely profound and subtle, difficult
for ordinary people to understand and difficult for them to perceive.
Even if I try to teach this Dharma to the people, they will fail to
understand it, and their irritation will increase on hearing my teach-
ing. Because of this, I have decided to remain in silence and do not
wish to teach. Since innumerable past eons I have continued, in
exertion and without slackening, to practice the highest path, and I
have now finally accomplished this Dharma that is most difficult
to realize. If I teach this Dharma to those who are consumed by
desire, hatred, and ignorance, for all practical purposes my teaching
would never be accepted by them and only leave me exhausted.
This Dharma is subtle and contradictory to the [general] character-
istics of the human world. People are stained with desires, blanketed
by the darkness of ignorance, unable to believe and understand. O
Brahmā, lord of gods, this is what I have been thinking. Because
```

8c

```
Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

```
of this, I have remained in silence and have not tried to teach the
Dharma.
```

Then the lord of Brahmā Heaven requested the Buddha to change his 
mind, repeating three times the following words:

```
O World-honored One, if you do not teach the Dharma to this human
world now faltering toward destruction, it will be the greatest pity.
May I request, O World-honored One, that you promulgate the teach-
ing at some proper time, thus preventing humankind from falling
to the lesser courses of the life cycle.
```

At that time, having listened to the god Brahmā’s courteous request 
three times, Vipaśyin Buddha observed the world, finding that some 
people were less defiled and others more, some were better endowed 
and others less, [and he then realized] that it would be easier to teach 
some of them while it would be more difficult to teach others. Those 
to whom it is easier to teach the Dharma should instill a fear of com- 
mitting transgressions that cannot be atoned for in the life to come, 
and hence encourage the extinguishing of evil deeds while promoting 
good deeds. For instance, among those lotuses that bloom in different 
colors, such as blue, pink, red, and white, some are growing out of 
dirty mud, not yet reaching the surface of the water; some are just 
emerging onto the surface of the water; and some have emerged onto 
the water’s surface but are not yet blooming—yet all are equally 
unspoiled by the water and ready to bloom. The people of the world 
are similar to these lotus plants.

At that time, the World-honored One spoke to the lord Brahmā:

```
As I have been moved by pity for all of you, I shall open the gate
of the Dharma, the nectar of life, and teach it to the world. But since
it is very profound and subtle, difficult to fathom and know, I shall
teach only those who believe in it and listen to it with joy, [and will]
not teach those who are irritated on hearing it and hence are not
benefited by it.
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
At that time, the lord Brahmā knew that the Buddha had accepted his
request and, delighted, joyful, and encouraged, he proceeded to walk
around the Buddha to the right, circumambulating him three times.
Having honored [the Buddha by lowering his forehead to his] feet,
[Brahmā] suddenly disappeared. Not long after Brahmā’s disappearance,
the Tathāgata quietly thought to himself, “To whom should I first teach
the Dharma?” He made up his mind, thinking, “I should go to the city
of Bandhumatī and initially open the gate of nectar for the sake of
Prince Tiṣya and the son of the minister Khaṇḍa.” The Buddha suddenly
disappeared from his seat under the bodhi tree but in an instant, [the
length of time] it takes for a wrestler to bend his arm and straighten it,
he reached the Deer Park in the city of Bandhumatī, which belonged
to King Bandhumant and, spreading his sitting cloth there, he took his
seat on it.
Here the Buddha continued in verse:
Just as a lion wanders in the forest
As leisurely as it wishes,
So did that buddha wander in a similar manner
With no obstruction whatsoever.
Vipaśyin Buddha said to the guardian of the grove,
Return to the city and speak to Prince Tiṣya and the son of the min-
ister Khaṇḍa with the following words: “Would you like to know,
sir, that Vipaśyin Buddha has arrived in the grove of the Deer Park
and wishes to see you. It is a good opportunity, sir!”
As instructed, the grove guardian then went to see them and conveyed
the [Buddha’s] words to them in detail. Having listened to the guard,
[Prince Tiṣya and the son of the minister Khaṇḍa] immediately went
the place where the Buddha was staying, and after bowing their fore-
heads to his feet they withdrew and sat to one side.
Thereupon the Buddha began to teach them the Dharma, encour-
aging, benefiting, and delighting them. He taught them the doctrine of
charity, the doctrine of morality, the doctrine of birth in heaven, the
```

9a

```
Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

```
doctrine that bondage by thirstlike craving and impure defilements is
dangerous, and the doctrine that renunciation of these obstacles is pri-
mary, subtle, pure, and praiseworthy.
At that time, the World-honored One observed that the minds of
these youths were receptive, filled with joy and faith, and accepting
of the right Dharma. Thereupon, he introduced (1) the doctrine of the
noble truth of suffering ( ārya-duḥkha-satya ), explained it in detail,
and helped them understand it. Moreover, he set forth the remaining
three truths individually and gave due commentary on these respective
doctrines, namely: (2) the noble truth of the cause of suffering, (3) the
noble truth of the cessation of suffering, and (4) the noble truth of the
path of cessation.
At that time, Prince Tiṣya and the son of the minister Khaṇḍa attained
realization in that single session [right in their seats], exhausted all the
defilements, and thus acquired genuine insight into the nature of the
Dharma, just as a white cloth can be easily dyed any color.
At that moment, the god of the earth made an announcement with
the following words:
Vipaśyin Tathāgata has turned the wheel of the supreme Dharma at
the Deer Park near the city of Bandhumatī. No one whosoever,
whether a śramaṇa, a brāhmaṇa, a heavenly god, the Evil One, or
any other in the human world, has been able to turn that wheel.
In this manner, the news spread from one to another throughout the
four quarters of heaven, as well as to the gods who were capable of
assuming any shape desired, to the sixth heaven, the highest in the
realm of desire, and before too long it reached the heaven of the god
Brahmā.
```

Then the Buddha continued in verse:

```
With elation and joy, everyone praised the Tathāgata,
Who became Vipaśyin Buddha and
Turned the supreme wheel of Dharma.
Departing from under the bodhi tree,
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
He reached the city of Bandhumatī and
Turned the wheel of Dharma,
Teaching Khaṇḍa and Tiṣya the Four Noble Truths.
Having thus received the teaching from the Buddha,
At that first session Khaṇḍa and Tiṣya were converted.
There is no higher practice of austerity
Than turning the sacred wheel of Dharma.
The gods of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven and their lord Indra
Spoke to each other in elation and delight,
Which all the gods surely heard:
“The Buddha appeared in the human world and
Turned the highest wheel of Dharma.
This increases the well-being of the gods but
Reduces the advantage of the asura demigods.”
The name of the one
Who accomplished highest enlightenment
Was heard everywhere, and
The insight thus reached by him is gone
Beyond the human realm.
Totally at home with all things,
His insight thus turns the wheel of Dharma.
Contemplating all things as being of equal nature,
His breath and mind were clean and spotless.
Liberated from the yoke of birth and death,
His insight turns the wheel of Dharma.
Having terminated suffering,
Freed from evil deeds, and
Liberated beyond desires and
From the bondage of worldly love and indebtedness,
His insight turns the wheel of the Dharma.
Most honorable among those enlightened,
The Honored One of the human world,
Well restrained and unencumbered by bondage,
His insight turns the wheel of Dharma.
```

9b

```
Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

Whoever excels in teaching and guidance 
Overcomes the animosity of the Evil One; 
Freed from all evils, 
His insight thus turns the wheel of Dharma. 
The power of insight annihilates defilements, 
And defeats the Evil One; 
Senses well controlled without slackening, terminating defilements, 
He liberates himself from the bondage of the Evil One, 
His insight turning the wheel of Dharma. 
If one studies the truth that is completely certain, 
He will know that all things ( _dharma_ s) are without reality ( _anātman_ ); 
This is the highest among all truths. 
Thus his insight turns the wheel of Dharma. 
He does not turn the wheel for the sake of gain, 
Nor for the sake of fame, 
But out of compassion for all sentient beings; 
Thus his insight turns the wheel of Dharma. 
Having observed the yoke of suffering of all beings, 
Oppressed by old age, sickness, and death, 
It is for preventing the three evil courses of the life cycle 
That his insight turns the wheel of Dharma. 
Having terminated desire, hatred, and ignorance, 
Removing the root of thirstlike craving, 
Unshakeable and liberated, 
His insight thus turns the wheel of Dharma. 
Though I felt it difficult to overcome, 
Having won, I let the Evil One acknowledge his defeat; 
The difficult enemy has been defeated. 
Thus, his insight turns the wheel of Dharma. 
This wheel of Dharma, having nothing higher, 
The Buddha alone is able to turn it. 
Neither gods nor the Evil One, nor Indra, nor Brahmā, 
Can turn that wheel. 
Abiding closely with Dharma and turning it, 
Benefiting gods and humans;

```
The master of gods and humans
Is able to cross to the yonder shore.
At that time, Prince Tiṣya and the son of the minister Khaṇḍa perceived
the Dharma with insight, realized its fruit, and, betraying no truth,
accomplished the state of certainty. At once they said to Vipaśyin
Buddha, “We wish to practice austerity under the Dharma of the Tathā-
gata.”
The Buddha said, “Welcome, bhikṣu s. The Dharma I teach is pure
and genuine and unbounded. By practicing it, you may exhaust the
limit of the suffering.”
At that time, the two were granted higher ordination. Not too long
after the occasion of ordination, the Tathāgata demonstrated to his dis-
ciples three mysteries: (1) the supernormal power of freedom, (2) the
supernormal power of knowing the minds of others, and (3) the super-
normal power of teaching to achieve the destruction of defilement,
emancipation from the intoxication of mind, and insight freed from
the obstacle of birth and death.
Then, having heard that the two men had renounced household life
in order to practice the path, had donned saṃghāṭī robes and with alms-
bowls in hand were carrying out the practice of austerity, many citizens
of the city of Bandhumatī said to each other, “This path must surely
be true, because it has caused them to forsake the glory of their worldly
careers, the opportunity to obtain important roles in the world.”
Then the eighty-four thousand citizens of the city visited the place
where Vipaśyin Buddha was staying in the Deer Park, and after bowing
their foreheads to his feet to honor him, they withdrew and sat to one
side. Thereupon, the Buddha began to teach them the Dharma, encour-
aging, benefiting, and delighting them. He taught them the doctrine of
charity, the doctrine of morality, the doctrine of birth in heaven, the
doctrine that bondage in thirstlike desires and impure defilements are
dangerous, and the doctrine that renunciation of these obstacles is pri-
mary, subtle and pure, and praiseworthy.
At that time, the World-honored One observed that the minds of
these citizens were receptive, filled with joy and faith, and accepting

the right Dharma. Thereupon he introduced (1) the noble truth of suf-
fering, explained it in detail, and had them understand it. Moreover,
he set forth separately the remaining three truths and gave due com-
mentary on these respective doctrines, namely (2) the noble truth of
the cause of suffering, (3) the noble truth of the cessation of suffering,
and (4) the noble truth of the path of cessation.
At that time, those eighty-four thousand citizens attained realization
in that single session [at their seats], exhausted all the defilements, and
thus acquired genuine insight into the nature of the Dharma, just as a
white cloth can be easily dyed any other color.
Having perceived the Dharma with insight, realized its fruit, and,
betraying no truth, accomplished the state of certainty, the citizens of
the city of Bandhumatī said to Vipaśyin Buddha, “We wish to practice
austerity under the Dharma of your tathāgatahood.”
The Buddha said: “Welcome, bhikṣu s. The Dharma I teach is pure
and genuine and unbounded. By practicing it, you may exhaust the
limit of suffering.”
At that time, the eighty-four thousand citizens were granted higher
ordination. Not too long after the occasion of ordination, the Tathāgata
demonstrated to his disciples three mysteries: (1) the supernormal
power of freedom, (2) the supernormal power of knowing the minds
of others, and (3) the supernormal power of teaching to achieve the
destruction of defilement, emancipation from the intoxication of mind,
and insight freed from the obstacle of birth and death. Then those
eighty-four thousand citizens who had heard the news that at the Deer
Park, near the city of Bandhumatī, Vipaśyin Tathāgata had turned the
wheel of the supreme Dharma, which no one, whether a śramaṇa, a
brāhmaṇa, a heavenly god, the Evil One, or anyone in the human world
is able to turn, at once visited the place where Vipaśyin Buddha was
staying, and after bowing their foreheads to his feet to honor him, with-
drew and sat to one side.
```

The Buddha then continued in verse:

```
Just as a man tries to be rescued
From his burning mind, and
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
Seeks a place to extinguish that fire
As quickly as possible,
These citizens have come
To see the Tathāgata in like manner.
Then the Buddha began to teach the Dharma again as before. At that
time, there were one hundred and sixty-eight thousand bhikṣu s in the
city of Bandhumatī. The bhikṣu s Tiṣya and Khaṇḍa both arose in midair
before the assembly of bhikṣu s, demonstrating their supernormal powers
of spraying water, emitting fire, and teaching the miraculous Dharma.
At that time, the Tathāgata remained silent and thought to himself:
Now we have one hundred and sixty-eight thousand bhikṣu s in this
city. It may be good for them to travel through various regions in
teams of two, sojourning here and there for a duration of six years.
Then, returning to this city, they may report to the sangha their
achievement of a new ordination.
Then the god Śuddhāvāsa, knowing the Tathāgata’s thoughts, appeared
before the World-honored One in an instant, as swiftly as a wrestler
bends his arm and straightens it, and, after honoring [the Buddha] by
bowing his forehead to his feet, withdrew to one side. Soon he spoke
to the Buddha:
O World-honored One, there are so many bhikṣu s in this city. It
would be better for them to travel to various regions. After six years,
they may return to this city and report to the sangha how many ordi-
nations each of them has accomplished. I shall protect each who
will be traveling, and guard [them from] anyone who might make
this an opportunity for personal advantage, sir.
Having listened to this god’s advice, the Tathāgata gave his assent by
remaining silent. Then the god Śuddhāvāsa, understanding that the
Buddha had granted permission by remaining silent, at once bowed
his forehead to [the Buddha’s] feet and suddenly disappeared, returning
to his heavenly abode. Not long after the god’s departure, the Buddha
told the bhikṣu s:
```

10a

```
Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

```
Now there are many bhikṣu s in this city. You are advised to travel
to various regions in order to propagate the Dharma and, after six
years’ time, return to this city and report to the sangha how many
ordinations each of you has accomplished.
Then, following the Buddha’s instruction, the bhikṣu s, each carrying
his robe and bowl, left on their sojourn after venerating the Buddha.
```

The Buddha then continued in verse:

```
Neither disturbing the bhikṣu s,
Nor desiring anything [for himself],
Nor having any attachment,
The Buddha abides with his authority.
Like the mythological garuḍa bird,
Like a crane leaving an empty pond,
He makes his departure.
The god Śuddhāvāsa spoke to each of the bhikṣu s after one year:
Your sojourn has passed one year, and there remain five years. You
should remember that after six years you must return to the city and
report to the sangha how many ordinations each of you has accom-
plished.
In this manner, time passed through the sixth year. The god again said
to the bhikṣu s, “A full six years have already passed. May all of you
return to the city to report on your accomplishment.”
On hearing [Śuddhāvāsa’s] words, the bhikṣu s picked up their robes
and almsbowls, returned to the city of Bandhumatī, and came to the
place where Vipaśyin Buddha was staying in the Deer Park. After hon-
oring him by bowing their foreheads to his feet, they withdrew and sat
to one side.
```

The Buddha then continued in verse:

```
Just as those well-trained elephants
Follow their riders’ commands freely,
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
In like manner the assembly of bhikṣu s
Returned here as instructed.
At that time, the Tathāgata ascended into midair before the assembly of
bhikṣu s and, while suspended in midair, cross-legged in the lotus posture,
he lectured on the book of discipline, making the virtue of perseverance pri-
mary.
The Buddha taught that nirvana is the highest goal of his Dharma, and
that even if one has a shaven hair and beard (i.e., a monk), if he injures others
he is no longer a śramaṇa.
Then the god Śuddhāvāsa, abiding not too far from the Buddha, praised
him by reciting the following verse:
The great insight of the Tathāgata
Is [extremely] subtle and
It alone is most honorable.
Endowed with both the practice of calming the mind ( śamatha ) and
That of analytical insight ( vipaśyanā ),
He realized highest, perfect enlightenment.
Because he had compassion for sentient beings,
He stayed in the human world and realized that goal.
He taught the four veritable truths to his disciples ( śrāvaka s):
The [truths of] suffering, of the cause of suffering,
Of the cessation of suffering, and
The eightfold path of the wise and holy
That leads to the place of peace and comfort.
Vipaśyin Buddha appeared in the human world,
Surrounded by his disciples,
Like the brightly shining sun.
Having recited these verses, the god suddenly disappeared.
At that time, the World-honored One spoke to the bhikṣu s:
I recollect that at one time in the past, when I was at Vulture Peak
(Gṛdhrakūṭa) in the city of Rājagṛha, I happened to think to myself
like this:
```

10b

```
Sutra 1: The Great Origin
```

```
There is no place in all the world where my birth has never taken
place, except one place, Śuddhāvāsa Heaven. If I were born in that
heaven I would not have returned to this world.
O bhikṣu s, again I thought myself, “I wish to visit Avṛhā Heaven.”
Then, in an instant, as swiftly as a wrestler bends his arm and straightens
it, I left this world and appeared in that heaven. The residents of that
heaven, having seen me approaching, honored me [by bowing] their
foreheads, withdrew to one side, and said to me, “We are the disciples
of Vipaśyin Tathāgata. Because we followed his teaching, we have
been born into this heaven, sir.” Thus they told me the stories of that
buddha from beginning to end.
Some of them also claimed, “The buddhas Śikhin, Viśvabhū, Kraku -
cchanda, Kanakamuni, Kāśyapa, and Śākyamuni are equally our mas-
ters, sir. Because we followed their teaching, we have been born here,
sir.” Again they explained to me the stories of these buddhas from
beginning to end. When I was born in Akaniṣṭha Heaven (the highest
of the five Śuddhāvāsa heavens), the same event was repeated.
```

The Buddha then continued in verse:

```
In an instant, as swiftly as a wrestler
Bends his arm and straightens it,
Through my supernormal power,
I reached Śuddhāvāsa Heaven, Avṛhā Heaven, and
Defeated two evil ones.
Then the god Atapā (“one who torments no one”) approached and
Greeted me with his palms together like a pārichattaka tree.
The name of the Śākya master is renowned
Even in distant regions.
Well endowed in his features and appearance,
He has reached Sudṛśa Heaven.
Just as a lotus untouched by water, free from stains,
The World-honored One has reached Sudṛśa Heaven,
Like the sun that initially arises,
Pure, spotless, and without shade,

### Sutra 2

### Last Journey and Sojourns

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 16: Mahāparinibbāna Suttanta )

#### First Episode

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was sojourning on the [moun- 
taintop called] Vulture Peak in the city of Rājagṛha, together with one thousand 
two hundred and fifty disciples. At that time, Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, 
desired to conquer the country of Vṛji. The king thought to himself, “Though 
the Vṛji countrymen are known to be brave and the people physically strong, 
it would not be too difficult for me to conquer them.” Thereupon, King Ajā- 
taśatru summoned his prime minister, Varṣākāra, a _brāhmaṇa,_ saying:

May you visit the World-honored One at Vulture Peak, [venerate him] in 
my proxy, and greet him with words of enquiry regarding his well-being: 
“Is his holiness at ease with his rising and sitting and does he feel strong 
in his walking?” Then speak to the World-honored One [with my words]: 
“The Vṛji countrymen are proud of their valor and of the physical strength 
of their people, and do not submit to my authority. I wish to conquer them, 
but since I have not thoroughly examined the matter, may I ask if the 
World-honored One could give some words of instruction on my behalf?” 
If the World-honored One does say something, bear in mind exactly what 
he has said without missing a word, and tell me his words exactly as you 
have heard them. Whatever the Tathāgata says cannot be false. 
Having received the king’s order, Prime Minister Varṣākāra at once boarded 
a carriage leaving for Vulture Peak, reached the point where he had to alight 
from the vehicle, and then approached on foot. On reaching the World-honored 
One’s dwelling place and greeting him with a bow, Varṣākāra withdrew to 
one side to take his seat and said to the World-honored One:

```
The king of Magadha, Ajātaśatru, [venerates] the Buddha by bowing
to your feet and respectfully greets the World-honored One with words
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
of enquiry: “Is his holiness at ease in his rising and sitting and does he
feel strong in his walking?” Again his majesty says to the World-
honored One: “The Vṛji countrymen are proud of their valor and of
the physical strength of their people, and do not submit to his authority.
His Majesty wishes to conquer them, but since [the king] has not thor-
oughly examined the matter, he requests the World-honored One to
give some words of instruction on his behalf.”
At that time, Ānanda was sitting behind the World-honored One, fanning
him. The Buddha said to Ānanda, “Haven’t you heard that the Vṛji countrymen
have frequently assembled to discuss the matter of their governance?” Ānanda
replied, “Yes, I have heard so, sir.” The Buddha said to Ānanda:
If that is really the case, the young and old are harmonious, together
they are all the more prosperous, their country should be secure for
some time to come and cannot be invaded by any other country. O
Ānanda, haven’t you heard that the leaders and the followers of the
Vṛji country are harmonious and have respect for each other between
the superior and the inferior?
Ānanda answered, “Yes, this also I have heard, sir.” The Buddha spoke
to him again:
O Ānanda, if that is really the case, the young and old are harmonious,
together they are all the more prosperous, their country should be secure
for some time to come and cannot be invaded by any other country. O
Ānanda, haven’t you heard that the Vṛji countrymen respect their law,
know what should be avoided, and do not fail to perform their customary
duties?
Ānanda answered, “Yes, this also have I heard, sir.” The Buddha spoke
to him again:
O Ānanda, if that is really the case, the young and old are harmonious,
together they are all the more prosperous, their country should be secure
for some time to come and cannot be invaded by any other country. O
Ānanda, haven’t you heard that the Vṛji countrymen are filial to their
parents and obedient to their teachers and elders?

Ānanda answered, “Yes, this also have I heard, sir.” The Buddha spoke 
to him again:

O Ānanda, if that is really the case, the young and old are harmonious, 
together they are all the more prosperous, their country should be secure 
for some time to come and cannot be invaded by any other country. O 
Ānanda, haven’t you heard that the Vṛji countrymen venerate the 
Buddhist shrines ( _abhyantara-caitya_ ) and respect the heretic shrines? 
Ānanda answered, “Yes, this I also have heard, sir.” The Buddha spoke 
to him again:

O Ānanda, if that is really the case, the young and old are harmonious, 
together they are all the more prosperous, their country should be secure 
for some time to come and cannot be invaded by any other country. O 
Ānanda, haven’t you heard that the wives and daughters of the Vṛji coun- 
trymen are genuine, faithful, spotless, and speak no evil even in jest? 
Ānanda answered, “Yes, this also have I heard, sir.” The Buddha spoke 
to him again:

O Ānanda, if that is really the case, the young and old are harmonious, 
together they are all the more prosperous, their country should be secure 
for some time to come and cannot be invaded by any other country. O 
Ānanda, haven’t you heard that the Vṛji countrymen render services 
for the needs of religious practitioners, the _śramaṇa_ s, revere those who 
are steadfast in moral precepts, and ready themselves to guard the reli- 
gion and protect the practitioners, having never failed in doing so? 
Ānanda answered, “Yes, this also I have heard, sir.” The Buddha spoke 
to him again:

```
O Ānanda, if that is really the case, the young and old are harmonious,
together they are all the more prosperous, their country should be secure
for some time to come and cannot be invaded by any other country.
Thereupon, Prime Minister Varṣākāra said to the Buddha:
When the people of that country uphold even a single principle of well-
being, it is an unwise scheme [to wage war against them]. How much

more so when they uphold all the seven principles of well-being. Since
I am obliged to deal with many matters of the state, may I now ask
Your Holiness for permission to depart, sir.
The Buddha said, “You may do as suits you best.”
Then Varṣākāra stood up from his seat, circumambulated the Buddha three
times, and, with a bow, withdrew. Not long after his departure, the Buddha
instructed Ānanda, “Go at once and instruct all the disciples, right and left,
in their residences in Rājagṛha to assemble at the meeting hall.”
Ānanda replied, “Yes, sir, right away.” At once he went to the city of
Rājagṛha and urged the bhikṣu s to assemble at the meeting hall, and he
reported back to the World-honored One: “All the bhikṣu s have assembled,
sir. May Your Holiness be ready.”
Thereupon, the World-honored One stood up from his seat, and, reaching
the meeting hall, took his seat in the place prepared for him and said to the
bhikṣu s, “I shall speak to you on the subject of seven principles of well-
being. Listen attentively, you should contemplate and remember [what I shall
now say].”
The bhikṣu s responded to the Buddha, “Yes, World-honored One. We are
ready to listen, sir.”
The Buddha said to them:
The seven principles of well-being means the following: The first is
the principle of frequent assembly to discuss the matter of right mean-
ings, so that the bhikṣu s of the sangha, young and old, may be harmo-
nious and the Dharma should not decline. The second is the principle
of harmonious cooperation and obedience regarding the teaching of
the Dharma between the superior and the inferior, so that the bhikṣu s
of the sangha, young and old, may be harmonious and the Dharma
should not decline. The third is the principle of respecting rules ( fa ),
knowing what should be avoided ( ji ), and following regulations, so
that the bhikṣu s of the sangha, young and old, may be harmonious and
the Dharma should not decline. The fourth is the principle of the sangha
leader’s protection and guidance for the members, so that the bhikṣu s
of the sangha, young and old, may be harmonious and the Dharma

should not decline. The fifth is the principle of guarding one’s mind
and adhering to piety toward the elders, so that the bhikṣu s of the
sangha, young and old, may be harmonious and the Dharma should
not decline. The sixth is the principle of practicing pure and genuine
austerity and refraining from desire, so that the bhikṣu s of the sangha,
young and old, may be harmonious and the Dharma should not decline.
The seventh is the principle of letting others be first and yourself second
in matters of the order and refraining from [seeking] fame or advantage,
so that the bhikṣu s of the sangha, young and old, may be harmonious
and the Dharma should not decline.
```

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

```
There is also another set of seven principles of well-being that enable
the Dharma to flourish and protect it from slander. The first is the prin-
ciple of concentrating on a few [matters] rather than being involved
in many, which enables the Dharma to flourish and not be subject to
slander. The second is the principle of maintaining quietude and silence
and refraining from the use of many words. The third is the principle
of reducing sleep and refraining from indulging in sleep. The fourth
is the principle of refraining from the habit of group mentality and the
indulgence in useless conversation. The fifth is the principle of refraining
from praising oneself without [the presence of] real virtues in oneself.
The sixth is the principle of refraining from joining any group of bad
influence. The seventh is the principle of abiding in a secluded, quiet
place in the forest. If each of you keep these principles, O bhikṣu s, you
shall enable the Dharma to flourish and protect it from slander.
```

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

```
Again there is another set of seven principles^16 that enables the Dharma
to flourish and protect it from slander. The first is the principle of faith
in the arhatship of the Tathāgata and in the ten titles attributed to the
Buddha who realized perfect enlightenment. The second is the principle
of having a sense of shame regarding one’s own deficiencies. The third
is the principle of knowing shame regarding one’s wrong actions toward

others. The fourth is the principle of maximizing learning, examining
the deep meanings of what one has learned regarding good, better, and
best, and carrying out the practice of pure and genuine austerity. The
fifth is the principle of exerting oneself in ascetic practice, refraining
from evil, and promoting good action. The sixth is the principle of bear-
ing in mind whatever one has learned and practiced in the past. The
seventh is the principle of practicing insight, knowing the law of birth
and cessation, and following the essentials of the wise and holy, thereby
terminating the origin of suffering. These are the seven principles that
enable the Dharma to flourish and protect it from slander.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
There is another set of seven principles that enable the Dharma to flourish
and protect it from slander. What are the seven principles? First, the prin-
ciple of reverence toward the Buddha; second, the principle of reverence
toward the Dharma; third, the principle of reverence toward the sangha;
fourth, the principle of reverence toward the precepts; fifth, the principle
of reverence toward the practice of concentration; sixth, the principle of
reverence toward one’s parents; seventh, the principle of reverence toward
the discipline of attentiveness. These are the seven principles that enable
the Dharma to flourish and protect it from slander.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
There is another set of seven principles that enable the Dharma to flourish
and protect it from slander. First, the principle of contemplating the
impurity of the physical body; second, the principle of contemplating
the impurity of food; third, the principle of not being pleased with the
human world; fourth, the principle of reminding oneself always of the
thought of death; fifth, the principle of giving rise to the thought of
impermanence; sixth, the principle of giving rise to the thought of suf-
fering due to impermanence; seventh, the principle of giving rise to
the thought of suffering and nonself. These are the seven principles
that enable the Dharma to flourish and protect it from slander.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:

Again there is another set of seven principles that enable the Dharma
to flourish and protect it from slander. What are these seven? First, the
principle of mindfulness regarding discerning insight, the retention of
previous experiences with good memory, and abiding in seclusion,
quietude, nondesire, and non-action by transcending both suffering
and happiness; second, the principle of differentiation of psycho physical
elements ( skandha s) retained in memory with regard to their truthfulness
or falsity; third, the principle of exertion in the pursuit of critically dis-
cerning right dharma s from false ones; fourth, the principle of abiding
in the delight arising from the preceding practices; fifth, the principle
of freedom from bodily and mental disturbances through the state of
delight previously accomplished; sixth, the principle of “mental con-
centration to realize bodily and mental calmness”; seventh, the principle
of maintaining a mind of equanimity and equilibrium. These are the
seven principles that enable the Dharma to flourish and protect it from
slander.

The Buddha spoke to the _bhikṣu_ s:

```
Again there are six principles that enable the Dharma to flourish and
protect it from slander. What are these six? First, the principle of acting
with a sense of friendly love ( maitrī ) and non-harm toward sentient
beings; second, the principle of speaking words of friendly love and
not speaking words of evil intent; third, the principle of keeping friendly
love in one’s mind and not holding any grudge or criticism; fourth, the
principle of obtaining pure and genuine material support and sharing
it with others equally; fifth, the principle of adhering to the precepts
of the wise and holy without deficiency and without omission, unshak-
able in purity and genuineness; sixth, the principle of seeing the path
of the wise and holy and thus acquiring insight into the origin of suf-
fering. These are the six principles that enable the Dharma to flourish
and protect it from slander.
```

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

```
Again there is another set of six principles that enable the Dharma to
flourish and protect it from slander. First, the principle of mindfulness

of the Buddha; second, the principle of mindfulness of the Dharma; 
third, the principle of mindfulness of the Sangha; fourth, the principle 
of mindfulness of the precepts; fifth, the principle of mindfulness of 
the practice of charity; sixth: the principle of mindfulness of birth in 
heaven. These are the six principles that enable the Dharma to flourish 
and protect it from slander. 
At that time, the World-honored One sojourned in Rājagṛha as long as he 
wished, and then said to Ānanda, “You are doing well [in the life of daily 
practice]. I wish to visit the Bamboo Grove monastery.” 
Ānanda replied, “Yes, sir.” At once, he packed the Buddha’s robe and 
almsbowl and, carrying them [on his shoulder], followed behind him together 
with the other _bhikṣu_ s. Proceeding on the highway of Magadha, the World- 
honored One then reached the Bamboo Grove, entered the monastic building, 
and took his seat in the meeting hall. There, he taught the _bhikṣu_ s the cur- 
riculum of three [major] trainings: (1) moral precepts ( _śīla_ ), (2) mental con- 
centration ( _samādhi_ ), and (3) [analytical] insight ( _prajñā_ ).

Being steadfast in the set of moral precepts and experiencing mental 
concentration, you may acquire great reward; being steadfast in the expe- 
rience of mental concentration and the application of analytical insight, 
you may acquire great reward. Being steadfast in the application of ana- 
lytical insight and realizing the purity of your mind, you may acquire 
perfect deliverance and extinguish three kinds of defilements, namely, 
defilement due to carnal desire, defilement due to existential desire, and 
defilement due to ignorance. When one has realized deliverance, he 
acquires the subsequent knowledge that he has realized emancipation, 
namely, “Whosoever has terminated [the cause of] birth and death, 
accomplished the goal of the practice of austerity, completed whatever 
should be done, for him there will be no more birth after this life.” 
At that time, the World-honored One sojourned at the Bamboo Grove as 
long as he wished, and then said to Ānanda, “You are doing well [in the life 
of daily practice]. I should proceed to the city of Pāṭaliputra.” 
Ānanda replied, “Yes, sir.” At once, he packed the Buddha’s robe and 
almsbowl and, carrying them [on his shoulder], followed behind him together

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

with the other _bhikṣu_ s. Traveling on the highway of Magadha, the World- 
honored One then reached the city of Pāṭaliputra and took his seat under a 
_paṭala_ tree. 
Having heard that the Buddha had arrived from a long distance at the 
_paṭala_ tree accompanied by a group of his disciples, a group of lay devotees 
came out from the city and from a distance saw the World-honored One 
seated under the _paṭala_ tree. They realized that his handsome appearance 
and calm, restrained senses were most sublimely matched in his holiness, 
just as a great dragon can be clearly seen through transparent water. They 
noted that the thirty-two eminent marks and eighty additional marks embel- 
lished his physical features. With delight in their hearts, they finally reached 
the place of the Buddha and, having honored him [by bowing] their foreheads 
to his feet, they withdrew to one side and took their seats. At that moment, 
the World-honored One began to teach them the doctrine of Dharma, thus 
encouraging, benefiting, and delighting them. 
Having listened to the teaching, the lay devotees said to the Buddha: 
We humbly wish to take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. 
May your holiness, with compassion, grant us lay devotees your per- 
mission. From now on, we are committed to upholding the five precepts: 
not to injure life, not to steal, not to indulge in sexual misconduct, not 
to speak falsehoods, and not to ingest intoxicants. We have also planned 
to set up a place to make our offerings, sir. We earnestly wish, O World- 
honored One, that your holiness as well as the host of venerables have 
sympathy with us in accepting our offerings. 
At that time, the World-honored One remained silent, thus granting their 
wish. Having seen that the World-honored One remained silent, the lay devo- 
tees stood up from their seats, circumambulated the Buddha three times, and 
with veneration, they returned [to the city]. At once they built a grand hall 
for the Tathāgata, fixing things here and there, cleaning up, burning incense, 
and respectfully placing a cushion at the main guest seat, they arranged the 
offerings in due order. They then returned to the World-honored One, saying, 
“The place has already been prepared. Whenever your holiness is ready, sir.” 
Thereupon, the World-honored One stood up from his seat, donned his 
_saṃghāṭī_ robe, and with his almsbowl in hand he went into the hall. After

```
washing his hands and feet, he took his seat in the prepared position. Then
the host of bhikṣu s took their seats on the left side, whereas the lay devotees
sat on the right side. At that time, the World-honored One said to the lay
devotees:
In general, when someone commits a moral transgression against the
five precepts, he is then visited with five kinds of disasters. What are
the five? First, even though one wishes to acquire wealth, he cannot
do so; second, even when one obtains some sort of gain, it is exhausted
within a single day; third, wherever one is, no one respects his presence;
fourth, his bad name and rumors [about him] spread through the world;
fifth, when his body dissolves and his life comes to an end he falls into
the hells.
Again he said to the lay devotees:
In general, when a person keeps moral precepts, he is then visited with
five kinds of blessings. What are the five? First, one is able to obtain what-
ever he wishes to acquire; second, his own wealth increases, with never
a loss; third, wherever he is, his presence is respected; fourth, his good
name is widely known in the world; fifth, after the dissolution of his body
and his life’s end he is bound to be born among the heavenly gods.
The time quickly passed through one half of the night. The World-honored
One told the lay devotees, “May each of you return home.” They then followed
the word of the Buddha, circumambulated him three times, and after vener-
ating him, went away.
At that time, during the latter half of the night as dawn approached, the
World-honored One went to his secluded place and, through his supernormal
vision, witnessed various high-ranking gods occupying the city, and also the
middle- and lower-ranking gods as well, all occupying that city. Thereupon,
the World-honored One at once returned to the meeting hall and took his seat
on the cushion. As he thought it was the right time, he asked Ānanda, “Who
built this city of Pāṭaliputra?”
Ānanda replied, “It was Prime Minister Varṣākāra, sir, and it is said that
he built this to defend against a possible invasion of the Vṛji, sir.”
```

12c

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

The Buddha said to Ānanda: 
Whoever built this city has received the gods’ approval. During the 
latter half of the night when the dawn was approaching, I went to a 
secluded place [for meditation] and, through my supernormal vision, 
saw high-ranking gods occupying the city and also middle- and lower- 
ranking gods as well. O Ānanda, you should know that when humans 
live at a site that high-ranking gods occupy, their lives will become 
secure and prosperous. Whoever lives at a site that middle-ranking 
gods occupy will be among the middle class of people. The site that 
lower-ranking gods occupy is the section where lower-class people 
live. Even these people have varied degrees of merit; their respective 
prosperity is somehow limited by these conditions. 
O Ānanda, this is a place where the wise may reside, it will also be 
a center where people come for commercial and business transactions, 
and the laws of the state are true and cannot be false. This is the best 
of cities, to be commended by many and not to be destroyed. Should 
this city be destroyed at some future time, it would necessarily be due 
to one of these three causes: first, by a great flood; second, by a great 
fire; or third, by the conspiracy of city residents who side with foreign 
invaders. The city would be destroyed for one of these causes. 
Throughout that night the lay devotees were then engaged in preparation 
of the next day’s provisions. When the preparations were complete, they 
came to the Buddha, announcing, “The morning meal has already been pre- 
pared, sir. Whenever your holiness is ready.” 
Then they set up a dining hall, served food to everyone with their own 
hands, and served water at the end of the meal. Thereupon, they each took 
their small sitting cloths with them and took their seats before the Buddha. 
At once, the World-honored One began to teach them:

```
Now, I shall tell you that this is the city where the wise and the learned
will reside, many of them upholding moral precepts, engaging in the
practice of austerity, because of which those gods of good nature will
be delighted. At once they recited mysterious charms for the presence
of gods’ blessings, if they are respected and served with respect, thus
```

```

```
widely conducting charity, love, and sympathy. This is the place the
gods praise and hence it is destined to meet with good fortune and will
not meet with bad things.
At that time, when the World-honored One had completed his teaching,
he stood up from his seat and the assembly circumambulated around the
Buddha and followed him in leaving the city. Prime Minister Varṣākāra, fol-
loweing after the procession, thought to himself:
Now, the śramaṇa Gautama went out of this gate. This gate will be
named “Gautama’s gate.” Again, the riverbank from which the Tathāgata
crossed the Ganges will be called “Gautama’s fording place.”
At that time, leaving the city of Pāṭaliputra, the World-honored One reached
the riverbank, where many people tried to find a means of crossing the river.
Some of them boarded boats in order to cross, while others got on bamboo
rafts, and yet others crossed the river on wooden rafts. At that time the World-
honored One was together with the host of disciples. Within an instant, as
swiftly as a wrestler bends his arm and straightens it, he at once reached the
yonder shore. The World-honored One contemplated the meaning of this and
spoke in verse:
The Buddha is the captain of an oceangoing ship.
The Dharma [that he teaches]
Bridges rivers and fords.
The vessel of the great path ( mahāyāna-mārga ) [that he steers]
Transports both gods and humans across the water together.
One may untie his knots (i.e., the defilements),
Cross over to the [yonder] shore, and
Ascend to the state of the sages.
[But] the Buddha is the one who helps his disciples
To untie their knots together and thereby realize nirvana.
At that time, the World-honored One, traveling on the highway of Vṛji,
reached the village of Koṭigāma. Resting under a forest tree, he said to the
disciples:
```

13a

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

There are four profound branches of the Dharma^17 (1) noble precepts, 
(2) noble concentration, (3) noble insight, and (4) noble deliverance. 
These doctrines are subtle and difficult to fathom. If I and you had not 
clearly understood these subjects, we would have been in the endless 
cycle of birth and death. 
Thereupon, having contemplated these subjects, the World-honored One 
continued in verse:

It is the Buddha who alone can differentiate 
The four divisions of the Dharma: 
Moral precepts, mental concentration, 
Analytical insight, and deliverance. 
Liberated from the state of suffering, 
He helps others to come to their conversion and 
To terminate their cycle of birth and death. 
At that time, the World-honored One sojourned in the Koṭigāma village 
as long as he wished. Then he said to Ānanda, “I wish to proceed to the 
village of Nādikā.” Thus instructed, packing the Buddha’s robe and almsbowl 
and carrying them [on his shoulder], Ānanda followed the World-honored 
One together with the other _bhikṣu_ s. Traveling on the highway of Vṛji, he 
reached Nādikā village and rested at a brick resthouse. At that time, Ānanda 
remained in a secluded place and thought to himself:^18

In this village, twelve lay devotees once lived. Their names were: (1) 
Kakkaṭa (or Kakkudha), (2) Kaliṅga, (3) Nikaṭa, (4) Lishu, (5) Sāḷha, 
(6) Poyalou, (7) Potoulou, (8) Subhadra, (9) Tuolishetu, (10) Soudal- 
ishetu, (11) Yaśas, and (12) Yeshuduolou. These people are all dead 
and must have been reborn somewhere. Again, fifty of the people passed 
away. Again, five hundred of them have died. Where have these people 
been reborn? 
Having thought thus, Ānanda arose from his secluded place. Coming to 
the World-honored One, after honoring him by bowing his forehead to his 
feet, he withdrew to one side and said to him:

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
O World-honored One, while I was silently contemplating in my
secluded place, I came to think of those twelve lay devotees, such as
Kakkaṭa, and so on, who have died. Then again, fifty people also passed
away in this village, and again five hundred of them have died since
then. Where have these people been reborn, sir? I wish that your holiness
would explain these matters.
The Buddha replied to Ānanda:
Those twelve, including Kakkaṭa, extinguished the five defilements
that bind sentient beings to the lower sphere of desire, and after their
deaths they were born among heavenly beings. They will enter the
final nirvana ( parinirvāṇa ) from where they are, and will not return to
this human world.
Those fifty people who passed away extinguished the first three of
the five defilements (i.e., heretical belief in self, doubt, and attachment
to non-Buddhist practices and observances), and freed themselves from
desire, hatred, and delusion, thus realizing the saintly state of stream-
enterer ( srotaāpanna ), first of the four [states of spiritual development].
They return to this world and will terminate the root cause of suffering.
Those five hundred people who have died also extinguished the
three defilements and realized the state of stream-enterer. It is certain
that they are not destined for an evil course of the life cycle, hence
they will realize the path by returning to this world seven times in order
to terminate the cause of suffering.
O Ānanda, it is the universal rule that once born, everyone is bound
to die. There is no question about this. If everyone, when their death
approaches, asks me about their destiny, wouldn’t this be a great tragedy
on their part?
Ānanda replied, “From the point of view of believers in the destinies, it
will indeed be a tragedy, sir.”
The Buddha said to Ānanda:
Now, I am obliged to teach you the Dharma mirror. You should tell
these noble disciples that if, in their present life, they can remove the
cause of falling into the three evil courses of life and can realize the
```

13b

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

holy state of stream-enterer, they should be able to exhaust the cause 
of suffering before passing through the seventh return to this human 
world. Also you should share the following: 
O Ānanda, the Dharma mirror refers to the state of unshakable faith 
that every noble disciple should acquire: 
(1) Delighted at heart, every disciple should have faith in the Buddha 
Tathāgata as endowed with the ten titles, such as “one who has totally 
extinguished defilements,” “one who is fully enlightened,” and so forth. 
(2) Delighted at heart, every disciple should not hesitate, whenever 
possible, to inculcate the Dharma that is real and subtle and to show 
the path of nirvana, believing in the testimony of what the knower of 
the path has been practicing. 
(3) Delighted at heart, every disciple should have faith in the Sangha 
whose members are in harmonious cooperation, sincere and direct, 
and without false flattery; in which the fruits of the path are realized; 
in which harmonious obedience is held regarding the teaching between 
the superior and inferior; and in which each of the members respectively 
embodies the Dharma in himself. For, when the members are ready as 
candidates for the state of stream-enterer, they will realize it; when 
they are ready for the state of once-returner ( _sakṛ dā gāmin_ ), they will 
realize it; when they are ready for the state of nonreturner ( _anāgāmin_ ), 
they will realize it; when they are ready for the state of arhat, they will 
realize it. 
(4) Every disciple should have faith in these [holy] men who are 
called the “four pairs of men” or the “eight [distinguished] personal- 
ities,” the wise and holy disciples of the Tathāgata, worthy of honor 
and respect as the best field of the world in which to harvest merit [by 
making offerings to them and serving them]. Every disciple should 
have faith in the body of precepts, pure, genuine, and spotless, neither 
deficient nor missing, adhered to by these wise and holy people. Every 
disciple should have faith in the practice and realization of mental con- 
centration by the bright and sagacious. 
O Ānanda, these are the contents of the Dharma mirror. You should 
tell the noble disciples that if, in their present life, they can annihilate 
the causes for falling into the three evil courses of life and realize the

```

```

holy state of stream-enterer, then they should be able to exhaust the 
cause of suffering before passing through the seventh return to this 
world. Also you should tell these things to those [who seriously wish 
to know about them]. 
At that time, the World-honored One sojourned in Koṭigāma village as 
long as he wished, and then said to Ānanda, “Let us go to the country of 
Vaiśālī.” Thus, having packed the Buddha’s robe and almsbowl and carrying 
them [on his shoulder], Ānanda followed the World-honored One together 
with other _bhikṣu_ s. Traveling on the highway of Vṛji, the World-honored 
One reached Vaiśālī and took his seat under a tree. 
A courtesan, Ambapālī by name, having heard that the Buddha, accom- 
panied by his disciples, had arrived in Vaiśālī and was resting under the tree, 
at once boarded a carriage to visit the place where the Buddha stayed, wishing 
to venerate him with offerings. Even before reaching the site, she saw the 
World-honored One from a distance, noting his handsome appearance, his 
extraordinary senses, and his eminent marks, as though seeing the moon 
among stars. Delighted at heart, Ambapālī alighted from the carriage and 
approached on foot. She finally reached the place of the Buddha and, having 
honored him by bowing her forehead to his feet, she withdrew to one side 
and took her seat. 
At that time, the World-honored One began to teach the Dharma, encour- 
aging, benefiting, and delighting her. Having listened to the Buddha’s teaching, 
Ambapālī was delighted and said to the Buddha: 
From today, for the first time, I humbly take refuge in the Three Treasures. 
May your holiness grant this wish. I will become an _upāsikā_ (laywoman) 
in order to devote myself to the right Dharma and, until the end of my 
life, will keep my vow not to injure life, not to steal, not to commit sexual 
misconduct, not to tell lies, and not to take intoxicants, sir. 
She again said to the Buddha: 
May I request, World-honored One, that your holiness and the venerable 
disciples accept tomorrow’s meal at my place. And may you take your 
rest for the night in the grove that I own. 
13c

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

At that time, the World-honored One maintained his silence, thus granting 
her wish. Having realized the Buddha’s silent acceptance, Ambapālī arose 
from her seat, venerated him, and after circumambulating the Buddha, 
departed. Not long after Ambapālī left, the Buddha said to Ānanda: “I am 
ready to go to the grove together with all of you.” Ānanda replied, “Yes, sir.” 
The Buddha stood up from his seat, and carrying his robe and almsbowl him- 
self, he went to Ambapālī’s grove accompanied by one thousand two hundred 
and fifty disciples. 
The Licchavi clanspeople of Vaiśālī, having heard that the Buddha was 
sojourning at Ambapālī’s grove, at once hurriedly set up their carriages dec- 
orated in five colors. Some of them rode a blue carriage drawn by a horse 
colored in blue, wearing blue garments, under a blue canopy with the mark 
of a blue streamer and a blue official ensign. The five colored carriages, 
horses, and so forth were all arranged in a similar manner. The five hundred 
Licchavi clanspeople, whose garments were of variegated colors, then equally 
wished to visit the Buddha. 
After leaving the place of the Buddha, Ambapālī returned alone to her 
home but on the way she encountered the Licchavi clanspeople on the same 
path. Her horse shied and her carriage rubbed against one of the Licchavi 
clansman’s decorated carriages and damaged its canopy and streamer. She 
did not, however, try to turn out of the way of their passage. The Licchavi 
clansman said accusingly:

Under what authority have you not turned out of the way of our passage? 
By bumping into my carriage, you have damaged my canopy and 
streamer. 
Ambapālī replied: 
Gentlemen, I have already requested the Buddha to come to my place 
for tomorrow’s meal. In order to prepare the meals, I am returning 
home. Because of this, I have to make this carriage run as fast as it 
can, not allowing it to turn off from this road, sirs. 
Some Licchavi clanspeople then asked [her]: “Can you set your request 
aside for a while, and give us the opportunity [to make the first offerings to 
the Buddha]? We shall give you one hundred thousand gold pieces for it.”

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

Ambapālī at once replied, “I am the first to have requested the Buddha 
and it has already been settled. I cannot transfer this opportunity to you, sirs.” 
Then the Licchavi clanspeople again said to [her]: “Then we shall give 
you sixteen times that amount of one hundred thousand gold pieces. Give 
us the first opportunity.” 
Ambapālī still did not agree, asserting, “My request has been granted. I 
cannot transfer it to you, sirs.” 
Then the Licchavi clanspeople said to her again, “We will give you one 
half of the state’s wealth. Let us have the first opportunity.” 
Ambapālī again replied: 
Even if you promise me all the wealth of the state, I am not interested 
in it, sirs. The reason is that the Buddha is sojourning at my grove and 
has accepted my request. This matter has been settled, sirs. 
Thus she refused. All of the Licchavi clanspeople wrung their hands and 
lamented, “Now, because of this woman, we have lost the opportunity to 
make the first offering!” but they proceeded on their way toward the grove. 
At that time, the World-honored One saw from a distance the five hundred 
Licchavi clanspeople approaching the grove, accompanied by tens of thou- 
sands of carriages and horses, filling up the entire roadway. He said to the 
_bhikṣu_ s: 
If you wish to know how the gods of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven play games 
and enjoy their heavenly garden, it would not differ much from the 
oncoming host of visitors in pomp and stateliness. All of you, _bhikṣu_ s, 
should maintain your minds in good unity and present yourselves in a 
dignified manner. 
What, O _bhikṣu_ s, is called good unity of the mind? Here, O _bhikṣu_ s, 
exert yourselves in observing the inner body (i.e., inner senses) in con- 
centration, without slackening, being mindful and remembering your 
observations, thereby discarding worldly desires and worries. Exert 
yourselves also in observing the outer body (i.e., outer senses), without 
slackening, being mindful and remembering your observations, thereby 
discarding worldly desires and worries. [Further,] exert yourselves to 
observe both the inner and outer body, without slackening, being mindful 
14a

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

and remembering your observations, thereby discarding worldly desires 
and worries. It is the same with observing one’s sensation (senses), 
mind (intellect), and psychophysical elements. 
O _bhikṣu_ s, what then does it mean to not be dignified in respect to 
manners? [It is the opposite of dignified conduct and discipline.] In 
this matter, O _bhikṣu_ s, whatever one should do, he should know how 
to do it. Whatever one should stop, he should know how to stop. Look 
around right and left, bend forward, stretch back, look downward and 
look upward, holding the robe and almsbowl; you should not lose the 
[dignified] manner of eating and drinking hot water and medicine; 
applying properly expedient means, you should remove obstacles, 
keeping your mind intact in silence without [letting it become] scattered, 
whether walking, stopping, sitting, lying down, sleeping, or speaking. 
Such a one is called a _bhikṣu_ who is well endowed with dignified man- 
ners and discipline. 
The five hundred Licchavi clanspeople reached the grove owned by 
Ambapālī and, having alighted from their carriages, proceeded on foot toward 
the place of the Buddha. After honoring him by bowing their foreheads to 
his feet, they withdrew to one side to take their seats. The Tathāgata, abiding 
on his seat, cast his aura of authority and holiness over the entire assembly, 
just as the autumnal moon casts its light, and also as the sun alone shines 
brightly from midair through a clear sky, onto the clean ground with no speck 
of dust whatsoever. 
At that time, while his seat was surrounded by the five hundred Licchavi 
clanspeople who sat on the ground, the Buddha alone amid the entire assembly 
revealed his holy illumination. At that time, there was a _brāhmaṇa,_ Piṅgiyānī 
by name, among the assembly. He suddenly stood up from his seat, rearranged 
his garments to expose his right shoulder, and with his right knee touching 
the ground and both palms held together in respect, praised the Buddha in 
verse:

```
King Aṅga of Magadha (i.e., Bimbisāra)
Seeking merit-worthy prosperity,
Clad himself in the heraldic paragon of armor.
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
The World-honored One appeared in this land and
Shook the triple world with his aura of authority and virtue.
The fame of his name has arisen like that of the Himalayas, and
[That of his virtue] like the blooming lotus flowers
With their subtle and delicate fragrance.
Now, the brightness of his presence
Is like the sun arising at the beginning of the day and
Like the moon playfully passing through the sky
With no shade of clouds whatsoever.
Even so is the World-honored One
Whose light illumines the human world.
His supreme insight is just as clear and bright
As a garden torch perceived through the darkness of night.
He has bestowed on everyone the eyes of insight and
Dispelled all doubt from the minds of humans.
Then, the five hundred Licchavi clanspeople, having listened to Piṅgiyānī’s
recitation of his verse of tribute, requested of him, “May you recite the verse
of praise once again.” Thereupon, Piṅgiyānī repeated the recitation three
times before the Buddha. Having listened to the verse of praise repeatedly
sung by Piṅgiyānī, each of the Licchavi clanspeople took off their garments
and gave them to the brāhmaṇa for his recital. Piṅgiyānī at once presented
these garments to the Buddha as his offering, and the Buddha accepted his
gift with compassion.
Thereupon, the World-honored One said to the Licchavi clanspeople of
Vaiśālī:
In the world, there are five kinds of treasures that are difficult to obtain.
What are the five? First is the appearance of the Tathāgata in this world,
who has realized the state of arhatship. Such an appearance is difficult
to meet. Second is a person who is capable of expounding the right
Dharma of the Tathāgata. Such a person is difficult to find. Third is a
person who is capable of believing and understanding the Dharma taught
by the Tathāgata. Such a person is difficult to find. Fourth is a person
who is capable of realizing the Dharma taught by the Tathāgata. Such
a person is difficult to find. Fifth is a person who knows how occasions

```

of crisis recur and how to rescue others from disasters. Such a person 
is difficult to find. These are the five treasures most difficult to obtain. 
Then, having listened to the teaching of the Buddha, the five hundred Lic- 
chavi clanspeople were delighted and said to the Buddha, “We humbly wish, 
O World-honored One, that your holiness and the venerable disciples accept 
our invitation.” 
The Buddha replied to the Licchavi clanspeople: 
Dear noblemen, you have invited me and I have now already accepted 
your offerings. Ambapālī made an invitation in advance, and this has 
already been accepted by the Buddha, hence it still stands. 
When all the Licchavi clanspeople heard this, each of the five hundred 
clanspeople wrung his hands and expressed regret, saying, “While we wished 
to make our offerings to the Tathāgata and his party, this woman has already 
taken the first auspicious opportunity.” At once they rose from their seats 
and, having honored the Buddha by bowing their foreheads to his feet, they 
circumambulated the Buddha and departed. 
During the night, Ambapālī prepared various foods for the next day’s 
offering. The next morning, when the time came, the World-honored One, 
surrounded by one thousand two hundred and fifty disciples, each neatly 
dressed in the _saṃghāṭī_ robe and with almsbowl in hand, arrived at the place 
they had been invited to and took a seat in the prepared position. 
Thereupon, Ambapālī set forth superb foods for the Buddha as well as 
the members of the sangha. When the meal was over, the bowls were set 
aside and the tables were removed. Ambapālī then carried a golden pitcher 
to serve water for washing. As she stepped forward toward the Buddha she 
said to him:

```
Among all the groves in the city of Vaiśālī, the one that I own is the
best. I would like to present it as gift to the Tathāgata. With compassion
for me, may your holiness accept this gift.
The Buddha said to Ambapālī:
Your ladyship, make this grove an offering to the universal sangha
(i.e., of the bhikṣu s of all regions) with the Buddha as its head. The
```

```

```

```
reason is that whatever belongs to the Tathāgata, namely, the six items,
such as groves, forests, rooms, houses, robes, and bowls, cannot be
transferred as gifts to anyone, even ones such as [the Evil One] Māra,
Indra, Brahmā, and other powerful gods, who are not equally worthy
to the Tathāgata.
Thus instructed, Ambapālī at once dedicated her grove to the universal
sangha with the Buddha as its head. With compassion, the Buddha accepted
her gift and praised her deed in verses:
Whosoever builds the commemorative tower (stupa),
Whoever builds the monastic residence ( vihāra ),
Whoever dedicates the grove and orchard with cool shade,
Whoever helps people cross the water
By building bridges and steering boats,
Whoever provides travelers in the wilderness
With water and grass as well as a resthouse,
His merit increases by day and by night thereof,
With his moral quality pure and genuine,
He is bound to reach the goal of highest good.
Then Ambapālī brought a small table before the Buddha and took her
seat. The Buddha began to teach the Dharma, encouraging, benefiting, and
delighting her, by expounding the doctrine of charity, the doctrine of morality,
the doctrine of rebirth in heaven, instructing that desires are to be shunned
as great danger, unclean and impure, determining ongoing defilements of
passion as an obstacle, but [on the other hand], commending the path of dis-
tancing oneself from both suffering and pleasure as necessary and best (toward
the goal of salvation).
At that time, the World-honored One observed that [Ambapālī’s] mind
became receptive, peaceful, little obstructed, and ready to be educated. There-
upon, following the rule of all buddhas, he expounded on her behalf the noble
truths of suffering, the cause of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the
necessary path of cessation (i.e., the Four Noble Truths).
At that time, Ambapālī, with faith pure and genuine, like white cloth that
can be easily dyed any color, at once in that single session [at her seat]
removed herself from all defilement and thus acquired genuine insight into
```

```

```

the nature of the Dharma, realized the Dharma as she envisioned it, became 
determined to abide in the right path without falling into any evil course, and 
thus attained the state of fearlessness. Thereupon, Ambapālī said to the 
Buddha, “Now I humbly take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.” 
After repeating the words of her vow, she said:

May your holiness grant me permission to become a lay devotee. From 
now until the end of my life, I will not injure life, nor steal, nor indulge 
in sexual misconduct, nor lie, nor drink intoxicating liquor. 
Therewith, Ambapālī received the five precepts from the Buddha. Casting 
away her earlier trade, she annihilated all unclean stains, and arising from 
her seat, she venerated the Buddha and departed. 
At that time, the World-honored One sojourned in Vaiśālī as long as he 
wished, and then said to Ānanda, “You are doing well [in the life of daily 
practice]. I wish to proceed to Beluva-gāma.” Having answered, “Yes, sir,” 
Ānanda packed the Buddha’s robe and almsbowl, and carrying them on his 
shoulder he followed the World-honored One with other the _bhikṣu_ s. Traveling 
on the highway of Vṛji, the World-honored One reached the bamboo forest 
of the village. 
There was a _brāhmaṇa,_ Pishatuoya by name. Having heard that the 
Buddha, accompanied by his disciples, had arrived at the bamboo forest, he 
thought to himself in contemplation:

This _śramaṇa_ Gautama is renowned of name and virtue in all regions. 
He is [perfectly] endowed with the ten supreme titles and has excelled 
beyond all the heavenly beings, such as Indra, Brahmā, [Māra], the 
Lord of Evil, and the evil ones ( _deva-māra_ s), the _śramaṇa_ s, and the 
_brāhmaṇa_ s, in his direct experience of deliverance, and has ever since 
continued to teach the Dharma. Whatever he says at the beginning, in 
the middle, as well as at the end, is true and right and is profoundly 
subtle in its meaning, and matches his practice of austerity. It will be 
good for me to see such a perfected person free from all attachment. 
Then the _brāhmaṇa_ came out of the bamboo forest and came to the place 
where the World-honored One stayed and, having greeted him with a bow, 
he took a seat at one side.

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
The World-honored One then began to teach the Dharma on his behalf,
encouraging, benefiting, and delighting him. Having listened to the teaching,
delighted in his heart, the brāhmaṇa requested the World-honored One and
his disciples to accept his offering of the next day’s meal and an overnight
resting place. The Buddha remained silent, thus accepting his invitation. The
brāhmaṇa, having understood that his request was accepted, rose from his
seat and, after circumambulating the Buddha, went home. At once, during
the night, the brāhmaṇa prepared the food and drink, and the next morning
he announced, “It is time, sir, if the World-honored One is ready.”
Thereupon, the World-honored One, donning the saṃghāṭī robe and with
his almsbowl in hand, reached the house accompanied by his disciples, and
took his seat in the prepared position. Then the brāhmaṇa served varieties
of good food for the Buddha and the members of the sangha. When the meal
was over and the bowls were set aside, he served water for rinsing the bowls
and washing hands. Then he brought out a small chair and sat before the
Buddha. Thereupon, the Buddha praised his deed in verse:
Providing those who are steadfast with moral precepts
With food and drink, robe and garment, as well as bedding,
One is bound to acquire great reward.
Such merit is a true companion,
Following him always and everywhere,
Just as the shadow following its form.
In this way it is best to plant good seeds
For securing food in the world to come.
Making merit, he is secure on that basis.
Protected by heavenly gods wherever he goes,
He will be free from disaster in all of his life and
Will be born in heaven when he dies.
At that time, the World-honored One taught the subtle Dharma on behalf
of the brāhmaṇa, benefiting and delighting [him], and having done so, rose
from his seat and left the house.
The crops were very expensive in that land and because of the prevailing
famine it was very difficult to obtain almsfood. The Buddha said to Ānanda,
```

15a

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

“Call all the _bhikṣu_ s residing in this country and assemble them in the meeting 
hall.” 
Ānanda answered, “Yes, sir,” and released the message far and near to 
call [all the _bhikṣu_ s] to assemble at the hall. Thereupon, all the _bhikṣu_ s residing 
in that country came to assemble, and Ānanda reported to the Buddha, “The 
_bhikṣu_ s have assembled, sir. May your holiness be ready.” 
At that time, the World-honored One rose from his seat, reached the hall, 
and, having taken his seat in the prepared position, said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

It is a time of famine in this land, and it is difficult to obtain almsfood. 
All of you form groups and go to Vaiśālī or the country of Vṛji to rely 
on your friends and relatives. If you settle there for the duration of the 
summer retreat, you may not have to face the difficulty of food shortage. 
I alone will remain here with Ānanda to arrange the summer retreat. 
The reason for sending you away is that I foresee food scarcity as well 
as other things here. 
Thereupon, the _bhikṣu_ s at once departed as instructed for their respective 
destinations. 
The Buddha alone remained in that country with Ānanda. Later on, during 
the summer retreat, the Buddha experienced physical ailment with pains 
throughout his body. He attentively spoke to himself:

Now I have got an illness and my whole body hurts very severely. But 
all the disciples are not here. It would not be good if I were to take the 
course of death here. For the time being, I must exert myself to prolong 
my life. 
At that time, the World-honored One came out of his secluded room and 
took his seat in a cool spot. Having seen his appearance, Ānanda quickly 
approached him and said to the Buddha, “As I see your holiness now, you 
look to be suffering from an illness, sir.”

```
Ānanda again said:
I have known that the World-honored One has been ill. My mind has
been upset and distracted because of the defilement of sorrow and
```

```
lamentation, without clear consciousness. Since my breath has still
survived, I tried to wake and gather my thoughts, then realized that
the Tathāgata has not entered nirvana. The Eye of Wisdom of the human
world has not entered nirvana. The great Dharma has not yet been dam-
aged. But why has the World-honored One not yet left a testament for
all the bhikṣu s of the sangha, sir?
The Buddha said to Ānanda:
Is there anything that the sangha expects from me? If anyone claims “I
am one who holds the sangha and who unites the sangha,” then such a
person may leave some sort of instruction to the sangha. But I, the Tathā-
gata, have never said “I am one who holds the sangha and unites the
sangha.” Why should I leave some sort of instruction after my death?
O Ānanda, the Dharma that I teach has been put into practice with
no distinction of inside or outside. Without a claim of “I,” the Dharma
that I [originally] realized has been practiced all through. I have become
aged, just about eighty years. Just as an old cart can barely [continue
to] travel by means of repairs, so it is the same with my body. I can
prolong my span of life for awhile by means of expediency, and I am
trying to forebear this ongoing pain. When I let go of all forms of
thought, I enter the state of no-thought where I feel at peace and at
ease with my body, feeling none of its affliction.
Therefore, O Ānanda, you must make yourself your own light, you
must make the Dharma your light, but you should not make anything
else your light. Take refuge in yourself, in the Dharma, but not in any-
thing else. Why do I say to you, “Make yourself your own light, make
the Dharma your light, but not make anything else your light. Rely on
yourself, rely on the Dharma, but do not rely on anything else”?
O Ānanda, when a bhikṣu observes his inner body (inner senses) in
concentration, he should exert himself with no slackening, being mindful
of his observations and keeping them in memory, thereby removing
worldly desires and worries. In observing his outer body (outer senses),
and also observing both inner and outer body, he should exert himself
with no slackening, being mindful of his observations and keeping
them in memory, thereby removing worldly desires and worries. It is
```

15b

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

the same with observing one’s sense perceptions, mind (intellect), and 
psychophysical elements. 
This is what I mean by making oneself one’s own light, making the 
Dharma one’s light, but not making anything else one’s light; to rely 
on oneself as one’s refuge, to rely on the Dharma as one’s refuge, but 
not to rely on anything else as one’s refuge. 
The Buddha said to Ānanda: 
If there is anyone who would really be able to practice this discipline, 
he surely would be the primary practitioner of the path among all my 
disciples. 
The Buddha said to Ānanda, “We shall go to the Cāpāla shrine.” 
“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. The Buddha stood up, donned the _saṃghāṭī_ 
robe, and with his almsbowl in hand, reached the shade of a tree. He said to 
Ānanda, “Spread my sitting cloth. My back hurts. I wish to rest here.” 
“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda, and he at once spread the sitting cloth. The 
Tathāgata took his seat and Ānanda also set up a small seat and sat before 
him. The Buddha said to Ānanda:

There are those who practice the four kinds of supernormal power. 
While practicing these powers, they are always mindful of these prac- 
tices so as to keep them in good memory. When one so desires, he can 
prolong his life on the basis of his power for as long as the remaining 
duration of the current eon. 
O Ānanda, the Buddha has already practiced these four supernormal 
powers on many occasions and, being mindful of these experiences, 
he does not forget the use of them. If it is necessary, the Tathāgata can 
extend his life span for the remaining duration of the present eon, so 
that he may remove darkness, benefit the world, and make heavenly 
gods happier. 
At that time, Ānanda remained silent and did not respond. The Buddha 
repeated these words three times, but Ānanda still remained silent. At that 
time Ānanda was obstructed by the Evil One and did not understand the 
Buddha’s words. After three repetitions the Buddha suggested that he respond,

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
yet Ānanda was unaware that he should ask the Buddha to prolong his life.
[Finally] the Buddha said to Ānanda, “You ahould know what to do.”
At that moment, Ānanda understood [the Buddha’s] words, rose from his
seat, and, after venerating the Buddha, left that place. He sat under a tree not
far from the Buddha and engaged in meditation and reflection.
A short while later the Evil One [Māra] appeared before the Buddha and
said to him:
O Enlightened One, when you have no further wish, you should take
the course of entering final nirvana. Now is the right moment. You
should quickly enter final nirvana.
The Buddha replied to the Evil One:
Speak no more. I, myself, know the right time. I, the Tathāgata, will
not take the course of nirvana just yet. I must wait for the time when
all the bhikṣu s come together. I shall, by control of my own destiny,
approach courageously and without cowardice the goal of peace and
ease. I shall continue to take my own merit and will be the teacher
( ācaryaka ) for others. I shall continue to be a propagator of the teaching
of the sutras and will expound the meaning of each sentence.
If there is any heretical teaching, I will repudiate it on the basis of
the right Dharma. I shall vindicate the testimony of my own experience
on the mysteries of the Dharma. My disciples are not yet assembled
for all this, nor have the bhikṣu s, bhikṣuṇī s, upāsaka s (laymen), or upā-
sikā s (laywomen) assembled yet. Now it is still necessary to propagate
the practice of austerity and to expound the enlightened mind, allowing
the heavenly beings to witness the mystery of the Dharma.
Then the Evil One again spoke to the Buddha:
O Enlightened One, in the olden days, when you realized supreme
enlightenment under the ajapāla-nyagrodha tree by the bank of the
Nairañjanā River in the village of Uruvilvā, I appeared before you, O
World-honored One, and urged the Tathāgata to enter final nirvana,
saying “It is the right time now for you to enter nirvana swiftly and at
once.”
```

15c

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

At that time, O Tathāgata, you replied to me, saying “Stop, Evil 
One, I, myself, know the right time. I, the Tathāgata, will not take the 
course of entering nirvana. When a good number of disciples has assem- 
bled, and so forth, even allowing the heavenly beings to witness the 
mystery of the Dharma, only then I will take the course of entering 
nirvana.” 
O Enlightened One, now you have acquired many disciples and the 
heavenly beings have all witnessed the mystery of the Dharma. Now 
is the right time. Why are you not taking the course of entering nir- 
vana? 
The Buddha said: 
Stop, Evil One! The Buddha himself knows the right time. I will not 
abide for a long time. Three months from now, at the spot between two 
_śāla_ trees near Kuśinagara, the original place of the Mallan clan, I shall 
take the course of entering final nirvana. 
Then the Evil One quickly thought to himself, “The Buddha does not lie. 
He will surely enter nirvana soon.” Dancing and jumping for joy, he suddenly 
disappeared. 
Not too long after the Evil One had departed, the Buddha exerted himself 
to concentrate on volitional concentration at the Cāpāla shrine solely to extend 
his life span. Exactly at that time, the great earth trembled and all the people 
of that country were stricken with fear; there were none whose hair did not 
stand on end. The Buddha emitted a great ray of light that penetrated every- 
where without limitation, even illuminating the dark underworld, thus enabling 
the beings therein to see each other. At that time, the World-honored One 
uttered these words in verse:

Of the two divisions of the conditioned and the unconditioned, 
I have now forsaken the conditioned, 
Abiding solely in the state of concentration; 
Like a chick coming out of the shell. 
At that time, wise Ānanda, with a frightened mind, his hair standing on 
end, quickly approached the Buddha. Having honored the Buddha by bowing

his forehead to his feet, he withdrew to one side and said to the Buddha, “It
is very strange, O World-honored One, that the earth trembled, sir. Why did
this happen?” The Buddha said to Ānanda:
In general there are eight causes for the occasion of the trembling of
the earth. What are the eight? The ground is floating above water. Water
stays on wind, and wind stays in space. When a storm arises in midair,
a great churning of water automatically follows. When the great water
is churned, every part of the ground shakes. This is called the trembling
of the earth.
Next, O Ānanda, when a bhikṣu or a bhikṣuṇī, as well as the powerful
among the gods, has realized the path, recognized an imbalance between
the ground and the water, and has tested his or her capacity to balance
them, the ground necessarily shakes. This is the second reason.
Again next, O Ānanda, when a bodhisattva initially descends from
Tuṣita Heaven to his mother’s womb and abides there in concentration
with his mind undisturbed, the ground then trembles. This is the third
reason.
Again next, O Ānanda, when a bodhisattva comes out of his mother’s
right side and abides there in concentration with his mind undisturbed,
then the ground trembles greatly. This is the fourth reason.
Again next, O Ānanda, when a bodhisattva realizes supreme enlight-
enment, at that moment the ground trembles greatly. This is the fifth
reason.
Again next, O Ānanda, when the Buddha, after his realization of
the path, turns the supreme wheel of Dharma that neither the Evil One
nor his evil gods, neither śramaṇa nor brāhmaṇa, neither gods nor
people can do, then the ground everywhere shakes greatly. This is the
sixth reason.
Again next, O Ānanda, when the Buddha’s teaching is close to its
end, and if he abides in concentration with his mind undisturbed and
decides to forsake his longevity, then the ground everywhere shakes
greatly. This is called the seventh reason.
Again next, O Ānanda, when the Tathāgata, while abiding in the com-
plete state of nirvana ( anupadiśeṣa-nirvana ), [freed from both mental

and bodily continuation,]enters parinirvāṇa, the ground shakes greatly.
This is called the eighth reason.
These eight causes make the ground tremble greatly.
```

At that time, the Buddha continued in verse:

```
Highest among all humans, great ascetic śramaṇa,
Is he who illuminates the human world.
To this teacher of heavenly gods asked Ānanda:
“Why does the ground tremble, sir?”
With compassion, thus expounded the Tathāgata
With his voice like that of a kalaviṅka bird.
“All of you listen to what I explain.
The ground lies on water, water lies upon wind.
If wind moves in space, the ground shakes greatly.
This is the first cause of the ground that trembles.
O bhikṣu s, bhikṣuṇī s, if you wish to test your supernormal power,
Hills, oceans, the ground, and myriad grasses and trees all tremble.
When the gods Indra, Brahmā, and
All powerful gods wish to shake the ground,
The spirits of hills and oceans shake the ground.
The Bodhisattva, Most Honorable among Humans,
Endowed with hundreds of meritorious virtues,
When he initially enters his mother’s womb,
The ground trembles because of it.
Abiding for the duration of ten months in the mother’s body
Is like a dragon lying in a cushion mattress.
When he appeared from the mother’s right side,
The ground trembles greatly because of it.
When the Buddha was a youth,
His defilement was already extinguished, and
His enlightenment excelled infinitely,
Because of this the ground trembled.
When he turned the wheel of the Dharma in the Deer Park,
The gathering place of all sages, and
When his power of insight overcame the Evil One,
```

```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

```
The ground trembled greatly.
The Evil One frequently visited the Buddha,
Urging him to enter nirvana.
When the Buddha himself decided to enter final nirvana,
The ground trembled greatly.
The Most Honorable among Humans, Great Teacher, Sage,
One who exhausted the cause of subsequent existence,
Remained unmoved, and yet
When he decided on the course of entering nirvana,
The ground trembled greatly.
By one whose eyes were pure and genuine
The eight kinds of events are explained
As accompanying the ground’s trembling.
As the eighth cause,
It was the time when the Buddha enters final nirvana
From the complete state of cessation,
That the ground everywhere trembles greatly.”
```

#### Second Episode

The Buddha said to Ānanda:

```
There are eight kinds of people in the world. What are the eight? First,
the kṣatriya s (nobility); second, the brāhmaṇa s (priesthood); third, the
lay householders; fourth, the śramaṇa s (ascetic mendicants); fifth, the
four guardians of the heavens; sixth, the gods of the thirty-three levels
of heaven; seventh, the followers of the Evil One [Māra]; eighth, the
gods of Brahmā Heaven. I recollect the following regarding myself:
Long ago I was once associated with the kṣatriya people. The number
of times I sat with them, stood with them, and exchanged words with
them are beyond counting. Wherever I was with them, because of
my endeavors and powers of concentration I was a prominent figure.
Some of the kṣatriya people had good complexions, but my com-
plexion far exceeded theirs. Some of them had good voices, but my
voice far exceeded theirs. They ceased to compete with me, but I
did not stop competing with them. Whatever subject matter they
```

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

could discuss well, I too could discuss equally as well as they. What- 
ever subject matter they could not discuss, I could discuss. O Ānanda, 
I taught them the Dharma extensively, benefiting and delighting 
them. I died while I was among them, but they believed that I was 
a heavenly god and did not realize that I was actually a human. In 
this way, I mingled with the followers of the god Brahmā and, 
through incalculable times back and forth [through transmigration], 
extensively taught the Dharma to the heavenly gods, and yet no one 
knew who I really was. 
Ānanda said to the Buddha: 
It is marvelous, sir. O World-honored One, no one ever, before your 
holiness, could accomplish such [great] tasks as those accomplished 
by the World-honored One, sir. 
The Buddha continued: 
This subtle, delicate, and rare Dharma, O Ānanda, is exceedingly unique 
and has never before been realized by anyone. Only the Tathāgata alone 
could realize this Dharma. 
Again he spoke to Ānanda: 
The Tathāgata alone knows the nature of the arising, abiding, and per- 
ishing of sensation; he alone knows the nature of the arising, abiding, 
and perishing of ideation; he alone knows the nature of the arising, 
abiding, and perishing of analytical introspection. This is the unique, 
never-before-realized Dharma, which the Tathāgata alone has accom- 
plished. You should take this Dharma to heart and make it work for 
yourself. 
At that time, the World-honored One said to Ānanda, “Let us go to the 
Kūṭāgāra hall (near Vaiśālī).” He then sat on the sitting cloth spread under a 
tree. The Buddha said to Ānanda, “Go and tell the _bhikṣu_ s residing in the 
right and left quarters of the Kūṭāgāra [hall], without missing anyone, to 
assemble in the meeting hall.” 
As instructed, Ānanda assembled all the _bhikṣu_ s in the hall and reported 
to the Buddha, “All the _bhikṣu_ s have assembled, sir. May your holiness be

```
16c
```

ready.” Thereupon, the World-honored One at once went to the hall, took his 
seat in the prepared position, and said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

```
You should know the following disciplines, on the basis of which I
myself accomplished the direct experience and realization of perfect
enlightenment. They are: (1) four kinds of mindfulness, (2) four kinds
of endeavor, (3) four kinds of supernormal power for acquiring con-
centration, (4) four kinds of meditation, (5) five kinds of spiritual fac-
ulties, (6) five kinds of spiritual power, (7) seven kinds of auxiliary
disciplines of enlightenment, and (8) eight kinds of paths pertaining
to the wise and saintly practitioner. You should be in harmonious coop-
eration, respectful and obedient toward each other with regard to these
disciplines, refraining from creating disputes. When you have one and
the same teacher, all of you receive the same water and milk. Whoever
receives the practice of these disciplines from me should make of them
your light, equally, and share your delight in practicing them.
O bhikṣu s, you should know the following sources in which I have
expounded the Dharma since I accomplished the direct experience of
it. They are: (1) the sūtra collection, the sacred discourses in prose; (2)
the geya collection, the sacred discourses in prose and verse; (3) the
vyākaraṇa collection, the doctrines and destinies of religious fulfillment;
(4) the gāthā collection, the literature in verse; (5) the udāna collection,
the Buddha’s solemn and joyous utterances in prose and verse; (6) the
nidāna collection, the doctrinal and Vinaya discourses on motives and
occasions; (7) the jātaka collection, stories of past lives and experiences
as a bodhisattva; (8) the itivṛttaka collection, stories of past events; (9)
the vaipulya collection, extensive doctrinal studies; (10) the adbhuta
or adbhuta-dharma collection, descriptions of supernormal events and
mysteries; (11) the avadāna collection, moral instructions consisting
of heroic stories and moral retributions; and (12) the upadeśa collection,
detailed and extensive expositions and interpretations.
You should take these sources of the Dharma thoroughly to heart
and carefully evaluate and analyze them so as to avail yourselves of
them when needed, according to given circumstances. Why do I say
this? Because I shall not live for a long time. Three months from now
I shall enter final nirvana.
```

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

Having heard these words, all the _bhikṣu_ s were terror-stricken, shocked, 
and confused; some threw themselves to the ground. One cried out in a loud 
voice, “How is it that the Buddha will take the course of cessation so soon?” 
Another mourned, “How sad it is that Eye of Insight of the world goes to 
cessation! Without his holiness, we will wither away over time.” Some _bhikṣu_ s 
cried in sorrow and stamped [their feet] in grief, twisting their bodies and 
wailing, totally out of control, just as a snake that has had its head cut off 
twists and wriggles without knowing where it is going. 
The Buddha said to them: 
O _bhikṣu_ s, halt your wailing a moment. You should not be overwhelmed 
by sorrow. There is no one in the entire world, whether one is in heaven, 
on earth, or among human beings, who does not perish once born. No 
matter how hard one wishes to halt conditioned things from changing, 
one cannot do so. I have previously taught you that whomever you 
love, whomever you find endearing, all such is impermanent; whoever 
meets with another will after all become separated. The physical body 
is not one’s possession. Life does not continue to exist forever. 
Thereupon, the World-honored One continued in verse: 
Now I am free to take my course 
Reaching the place of peace and quiescence. 
Hence, I have assembled the members of the sangha 
To tell them what I mean. 
I am aged, having no more years to live. 
I have accomplished that which should be done. 
Now I am ready to forsake my life. 
Being mindful, without slackening, 
I have been steadfast with the precepts of the _bhikṣu_ s. 
Keeping myself intact by concentrating on my volition, 
I protect my mind [from scattering]. 
Whoever is steady, without slackening, 
With the Dharma I have taught, 
Can annihilate the root cause of suffering, 
Thus overcoming the fate of birth, old age, and death.

```

```
Again the Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
I have given you these admonitions now, because the Evil One among
gods came to urge me, saying, “O Enlightened One, when you have
no further purpose, you should take the course of final nirvana. Now
is the right time. You should quickly enter that nirvana.”
I replied to the Evil One, “Stop, Evil One. The Enlightened One
himself knows the right time. I will wait for the time when all the
bhikṣu s come together and all the gods are able to witness the mystery
of the Dharma.”
The Evil One again said, “O Enlightened One, in the olden days,
when you realized supreme enlightenment under the ajapāla-nyagrodha
tree by the bank of the Nairañjanā River in the village of Uruvilvā, I
appeared before you, O World-honored One, and urged the Tathāgata
to enter final nirvana, saying: ‘It is now the right time that you enter
final nirvana swiftly and at once.’ At that time, O Tathāgata, you replied,
‘Stop, Evil One, I myself know the right time. I, Tathāgata, will not
take the course of entering nirvana. When a good number of disciples
have assembled, and so forth, even allowing the heavenly beings to
witness the mystery of the Dharma, only then I will take the course of
entering nirvana.’ O Enlightened One, now, you have acquired many
disciples and the heavenly beings have all witnessed the mystery of
the Dharma. Now is the right time. Why are you not taking the course
of entering nirvana?”
I said: “Stop, Evil One, the Buddha himself knows the right time.
I will not abide much longer. Three months from now, at the spot
between two śāla trees near Kuśinagara, the original place of the Mallan
clanspeople, I shall take the course of entering final nirvana.”
Then the Evil One quickly thought to himself: “The Buddha does
not lie. He will surely enter nirvana soon.” Thus, dancing and jumping
for joy, he suddenly disappeared. Not long after the Evil One had
departed, I exerted myself to concentrate on volitional concentration
at the Cāpāla shrine solely to extend my life span. Exactly at that time
the great earth trembled, while all the people of that country were fear-
stricken and there were none among them whose hair did not stand on
```

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

end. I emitted a great ray of light that penetrated everywhere without 
limitation, even illuminating the dark underworld, thus enabling the 
beings therein to see each other. 
At that time, I uttered the following words in verse: 
Of the two divisions of the conditioned and the unconditioned, 
I have now forsaken the conditioned, 
Abiding solely in the state of concentration; 
Like a chick coming out of the shell. 
At that time, Venerable Ānanda stood up from his seat, rearranged his 
robe to expose the right shoulder, knelt with his right knee touching the 
ground, and with his palms joined together, said to the Buddha:

O World-honored One, we request that your holiness remain in this 
world by extending your life span until the fulfillment of the present 
eon, not taking the course of final nirvana. With compassion for all 
sentient beings, may your holiness benefit gods and humans. 
At that time, the World-honored One remained silent, without responding. 
Ānanda repeated his request in the same manner three times. Thereupon, the 
Buddha said to Ānanda, “Do you believe in the path through which the Tathā- 
gata realized supreme enlightenment?” 
He replied, “Yes, sir. I believe in the word of the Buddha.” 
The Buddha continued: 
If you believe in it, why have you approached to press me three times? 
You heard it closely from me and closely received instruction from me 
before, namely: 
There are those who practice four kinds of supernormal power. 
While practicing these powers, they are always mindful of these 
practices so as to keep them in good memory. When one so desires, 
he can prolong his life on the basis of his power for as long as the 
remaining duration of the current eon. O Ānanda, the Buddha has 
already practiced these four supernormal powers on many occasions 
and, being mindful of these experiences, he does not forget the use 
of them. If it is necessary, the Tathāgata can extend his life span

```
17b
```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

for the remaining duration of the present eon, so that he may remove 
darkness, benefit the world, and make heavenly gods happier. 
At that time, why didn’t you repeat your request asking me not to take 
the course of final nirvana? Your wish could have been fulfilled if you 
had inquired twice, or up to a third time. You could have requested me 
at that time to extend my life span for the remaining duration of the 
present eon, thereby removing darkness, benefiting the world, and 
making heavenly gods happier. You have now made this request, but 
isn’t it foolish? I expressed my intention three times, yet you remained 
silent throughout. Why didn’t you ask me at that time, “May the Tathā- 
gata extend his life for the remaining duration of the present eon, 
thereby removing darkness and benefiting the world”? 
Nay, do not press me any more, Ānanda. I have already forsaken the 
span of my life. I have discarded it and vomited it out. Even if you urge 
the Tathāgata to contradict his own word, you know that it is of no avail. 
It is as if a wealthy man has vomited food upon the ground. How and 
why would he retrieve the food once vomited upon the ground? 
Ānanda replied, “There is no reason, sir.” 
[The Buddha continued:] 
It is the same with the Tathāgata. He has forsaken it and already vomited 
it out. How and why should you ask him to retrieve what he has already 
forsaken? 
The Buddha said to Ānanda, “Let us go to Ambala village.” Packing up 
the Buddha’s robe and almsbowl [and carrying them on his shoulder], Ānanda 
followed the World-honored One together with the other _bhikṣu_ s. Traveling 
on the highway of Vṛji, he reached Ambala village and sojourned in a forest 
on a hill. 
At that time, the World-honored One taught the _bhikṣu_ s the three [main] 
branches of training: (1) moral precepts ( _śīla_ ), (2) mental concentration 
( _samādhi_ ), and (3) [analytical] insight ( _prajñā_ ):

```
Being steadfast with the set of moral precepts and experiencing mental
concentration, you may acquire great reward; being steadfast with the
```

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

experience of mental concentration and applying analytical insight, 
you may acquire great reward. Being steadfast with the application of 
analytical insight and realizing the purity of your mind, you may acquire 
perfect deliverance and extinguish three kinds of defilements, namely: 
defilement due to carnal desire, defilement due to existential desire, 
and defilement due to ignorance. When one has realized deliverance, 
he acquires a subsequent insight of his realization ( _vimukti-jñāna_ ): 
“Whoever has exhausted [the cause of] birth and death, accomplished 
the goal of the practice of austerity, and completed that which should 
be done [in life], to him there will be no more birth after this life.” 
At that time, the World-honored One sojourned in Ambala village as long 
as he wished. [Then] the Buddha said to Ānanda, “You are doing well [in 
the life of daily practice]. I wish to visit the villages of Jambugrāma, Bhāṇḍa- 
grāma, Hastigrāma, and then the town of Bhoganagara.” 
Ānanda replied, “Yes, sir,” and packing up the Buddha’s robe and almsbowl 
at once, he followed him together with the host of other _bhikṣu_ s. Traveling 
on the highway of Vṛji, gradually visiting those places, they finally reached 
the forest of _śiṃśapā_ trees north of the town of Bhoganagara and sojourned 
there. 
The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s, “I shall introduce you to four principles 
of great importance. Listen attentively, you should contemplate and remember 
[what I shall now say].” The _bhikṣu_ s responded, “Yes, sir. We are delighted 
and ready to listen to the teaching, sir.” 
The Buddha began to teach: 
What are the four [principles]? Suppose a _bhikṣu_ (or a group of _bhikṣu_ s) 
asserts a certain matter by saying, “At such-and-such village or town 
or country, I listened directly to the word of the Buddha and received 
directly from him this doctrine, this discipline, or this teaching.” Even 
so, you should neither believe it nor reject it unless whatever is asserted 
is examined to be true in reference to the scriptures, the rules of dis- 
cipline, or in reference to its origin and adaptation with the system of 
authentic belief. If it is neither in accord with the scriptures, nor with 
the rules of discipline, nor with the system of authentic belief, you

```
17c
```

```
should respond to the assertion by saying, “Venerable, the Buddha did
not teach this particular thing. You may have heard it from the group
of bhikṣu s erroneously. My understanding in reference to the scriptures,
the rules of discipline, or the system of authentic belief is different
from what you have asserted. The Buddha did not teach this particular
thing that you have asserted, because we have examined it in reference
to the scriptures, the discipline, and the system of authentic belief.
What you previously asserted is not in accord with the system of authen-
tic belief, nor is it in accord with the rules of discipline, nor is it in
accord with its origin and adaptation. Venerable, you should not keep
it, nor should you teach it to others. You should discard it.” If, however,
what he has asserted accords with the scriptures, the rules of discipline,
and the system of authentic belief, you should say to him, “What you
have previously asserted is truly the Buddha’s teaching, because we
have examined it in reference to the scriptures, the rules of discipline,
and the system of authentic belief. Venerable, you should hold it and
teach it widely for the sake of others. You should be careful not to dis-
card it.” This is the first principle of great importance.
Again next, O bhikṣu s, when a bhikṣu (or a group of bhikṣu s) asserts
a certain matter by saying “At such-and-such village or town or country,
I listened directly to the words of a learned elder of the harmonious
sangha and received directly from him this doctrine, this discipline,
and this teaching.” Even so, you should not believe what is said [to be
the Buddha’s teaching], nor reject it either. But you should respond to
this similar case by saying, “Venerable, we must examine whether
what you assert is true or false in reference to the scriptures and clarify
its origin and adaptation on the basis of the system of authentic belief.”
If, however, what is asserted does not accord with either the scriptures,
or the Vinaya, or the system of authentic belief, then you should say
to him, “The Buddha did not teach this particular thing that you have
asserted. You may have heard it from a group of bhikṣu s erroneously.
The reason is that our understanding in reference to the scriptures, the
rules of discipline, and the system of authentic belief is different from
what you have previously asserted. Venerable, you should not keep it,
nor should you teach it to others.” If, however, what he has asserted

accords with the scriptures, the rules of discipline, and the system of 
authentic belief, you should say to him, “What you have previously 
asserted is truly the Buddha’s teaching, because we have examined it in 
reference to the scriptures, the rules of discipline, and the system of authen- 
tic belief. Venerable, you should hold it and teach it widely for the sake 
of others. You should be careful not to discard it.” This is the second prin- 
ciple of great importance. 
Again next, O _bhikṣu_ s, when a _bhikṣu_ (or a group of _bhikṣu_ s) asserts 
a certain matter concerning the doctrinal teaching and the moral dis- 
cipline, saying, “At such-and-such village or town or country, I listened 
directly to the words of a group of learned elders who uphold the doc- 
trinal teaching, the rules of discipline, and the maintenance of model 
restraints and received directly from them this doctrine, this moral dis- 
cipline, and this teaching.” Even so, you should not respond to this 
similar case by saying, “Venerable, we should examine whether what 
you assert is true or false in reference to the scriptures and clarify its 
origin and adaptation on the basis of the doctrine and the discipline.” 
If what is asserted is neither in accordance with the scriptures, nor with 
the rules of discipline, nor with the system of authentic belief, then 
you should say to him, “The Buddha did not teach this particular thing 
that you have previously asserted. You may have heard it from the 
group of _bhikṣu_ s erroneously. The reason is that our understanding in 
reference to the scriptures, the rules of discipline, and the system of 
authentic belief is different from what you have previously asserted. 
Venerable, you should not keep it, nor should you teach it to others; 
you should discard it.” If, however, what he has asserted is in accordance 
with the scriptures, the rules of discipline, and the system of authentic 
belief, you should say to him, “What you have previously asserted is 
truly the Buddha’s teaching, as we examined it in reference to the scrip- 
tures, the rules of discipline, and the system of authentic belief. Ven- 
erable, you should hold it and teach it widely for the sake of others. 
You should be careful not to discard it.” This is the third principle of 
great importance. 
Again next, when a _bhikṣu_ (or a group of _bhikṣu_ s) asserts that “At 
such-and-such village or town or country, I listened directly to the words

of a _bhikṣu_ about this doctrine, this rule of discipline, and the maintenance 
of model restraints, and received directly from him this doctrine, this 
moral discipline, and this teaching.” Even so, you should not respond 
to this similar case by saying, “Venerable, we should examine whether 
what you assert is true or false in reference to the scriptures, and clarify 
its origin and adaptation on the basis of the doctrine and the discipline.” 
If what he previously asserted does not accord with the scriptures, nor 
with the rules of discipline, nor with the system of authentic belief, you 
should say to him, “The Buddha did not teach this particular thing that 
you have previously asserted. You may have heard it from the group of 
_bhikṣu_ s erroneously. The reason is that our understanding in reference 
to the scriptures, the rules of discipline, and the system of authentic belief 
differs from what you have previously asserted. Venerable, you should 
not keep it, nor should you teach it to others; you should discard it.” If, 
however, what he has asserted is in accordance with the scriptures, the 
rules of discipline, and the system of authentic belief, you should say to 
him, “What you have previously asserted is truly the Buddha’s teaching, 
as we examined it in reference to the scriptures, the rules of discipline, 
and the system of authentic belief. Venerable, you should hold it and 
teach it widely for the sake of others. You should be careful not to discard 
it.” This is the fourth principle of great importance. 
At that time, the World-honored One sojourned at the town of Bhoganagara 
as long as he wished, and then said to Venerable Ānanda, “Let us go to the 
city of Pāvā.” Having replied, “Yes, sir,” Ānanda packed the Buddha’s robe 
and almsbowl and followed the World-honored One together with the host 
of other _bhikṣu_ s. Traveling on the highway of the Mallan country, he reached 
Dutou Grove near the city of Pāvā. 
There was then a son of a blacksmith, Cunda by name. Having heard that 
the Buddha had arrived in the city by way of the Mallan highway, he dressed 
up and visited the place where the Buddha sojourned and, after honoring 
him by touching his forehead to the Buddha’s feet, he withdrew and sat to 
one side. The Buddha then began to teach Cunda the Dharma, encouraging 
him, benefiting him, and delighting him. After the Buddha’s teaching, his 
heart filled with faith and delight, Cunda said to the World-honored One, 
18b

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

“May your holiness accept my invitation to the next day’s meal.” Thereupon 
the Buddha accepted [Cunda’s offer by] remaining silent. 
Having noted that the Buddha had accepted his request, Cunda rose from 
his seat, and after venerating the Buddha, he returned home. During the night 
he prepared various provisions consisting of rice and other food for the morn- 
ing meal. The following day, at the proper time [after the announcement:] 
“May the Buddha be ready,” the World-honored One donned his _saṃghāṭī_ 
robe and, with his almsbowl in hand, surrounded by the host of _bhikṣu_ s, 
arrived at the house and took his seat in the prepared position. 
Thereupon, Cunda set forth food and drink, offering them to the Buddha 
and the members of the sangha. He had separately cooked mushrooms grown 
on the roots of a _sandal_ tree ( _sūkara-maddava_ ),^19 known as a rare delicacy, 
and offered this dish only to the World-honored One. The Buddha said to 
Cunda, “Refrain from serving this food to the _bhikṣu_ s.” As instructed, Cunda 
did not serve that food to the _bhikṣu_ s. Then an elderly _bhikṣu,_ who had 
renounced family life at a late age, put the remainder of the food onto a sep- 
arate plate. At that time, having observed that all the _bhikṣu_ s had finished 
the meal, Cunda removed the food vessels and served water. Thereupon, he 
asked the Buddha in verse:

```
May I proffer my question, O Holiness,
Possessor of great wisdom, perfectly enlightened,
Most Honorable among Humans,
Unrivaled leader and charioteer of the truth?
How many kinds of śramaṇa s are there in this world, sir?
At that time the World-honored One also replied in verse:
As to your question, I would say,
In general there are four.
But their goals vary and are not identical;
These you must distinguish for yourself.
First, those who excel in the practice of the path;
Second, those who excel in expounding the meaning of the path;
Third, those who rely on the path for living;
Fourth, those who do bad things in the name of the path.

[Now, what are these four?]
One who overcomes the thorns of love and
Affection for familial relations and
Enters nirvana with no obstacle whatsoever,
He is beyond the realm of heavenly beings—
This is the śramaṇa who excels in the practice of the path.
One who excels in understanding
The primary meaning of transcendence and
Is spotless in expounding the path,
[And] with friendly love and compassion
Dissolves doubts from people’s minds—
This is the śramaṇa who excels in expounding the path.
One who excels in propagating the words of the Dharma and
Living his life in reliance upon the path,
[And who] yearns from a distance
For the place of total freedom from defilement—
This is the śramaṇa who lives his life in reliance upon the path.
One who is crooked within but clean in [outward] appearance,
Fraudulent, without sincerity,
This is the śramaṇa
Who does wrong things in the name of the path.
Why, however, with good and bad together,
Purity and impurity intermixed, both looking alike,
Should all appear agreeable externally,
Just as copper within and gold coating without?
Looking at such a fake
Ordinary people wrongly regard him as a disciple
Endowed with holy insight.
But, [I say,] the remaining disciples
Are not necessarily like that false one.
[Therefore,] do not forsake [your] faith in them.
Even alone, a single bhikṣu (or a host of bhikṣu s) can uphold
The standard of the sangha.
While [one who is] muddy within yet clean externally
May cover up fraudulence externally and
```

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

Hide recklessness within. 
[Therefore], by merely seeing the external appearance, 
One should not be drawn toward anyone 
Trusting them without caution. 
Because even if some 
Do not leave any trace of external wickedness, 
They may retain recklessness within. 
At that time, taking a small seat with him, Cunda approached and sat 
before the Buddha. The Buddha began to teach the Dharma and, having thus 
benefited and delighted [Cunda], he left the house, surrounded by the host 
of _bhikṣu_ s. On the roadway the Buddha stopped under a tree and said to 
Ānanda, “My shoulder pain is pressing me. Spread my sitting cloth on the 
ground.” 
[Ānanda] answered, “Yes, sir,” at once spread the sitting cloth, and the 
World-honored One took his seat on it. Then Ānanda spread his small sitting 
cloth and sat before the Buddha. The Buddha said to him: “Have you noticed 
any appearance of regret in Cunda? If he has a sense of regret, what do you 
think caused it?” Ānanda said to the Buddha:

```
[It is probably] because Cunda, despite his charitable conduct, may not
acquire merit, sir. The reason is that at his place the Tathāgata received
his last food, which may be a further cause of final nirvana, sir.
The Buddha warned Ānanda:
Do not speak like that. Cunda will soon acquire great benefit and
longevity, a good complexion and physical strength, enjoy great fame,
and acquire wealth and treasures. When he dies he will be born in
heaven and will be able to obtain whatever he wishes. Why? Because
there is no difference in merit between one who offers food at the time
of the initial enlightenment of the Buddha and one who offers food at
the time of his final nirvana. Go see Cunda and tell him:
O Cunda, I have closely heard from the Buddha, and closely received
the teaching from the Buddha. O Cunda, because you have offered
food to the Buddha you will acquire great benefit and great reward.
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
Thereupon, as instructed by the Buddha, Ānanda visited Cunda and said
to him:
O Cunda, I have closely heard from the Buddha, and closely received
the teaching from the Buddha. O Cunda, because you have offered
food to the Buddha you will acquire great benefit and great reward.
The reason is that there is no difference in merit between one who
offers food at the time of the [Buddha’s] initial enlightenment and one
who offers food at the time of his final nirvana.
(The narrative continues in verse:)
After offering food [to the Tathāgata] at his house,
Cunda heard for the first time
That the illness of the Tathāgata had become serious, and
That his life was about to end.
Although his illness worsened
After eating the sandal tree mushrooms,
The Buddha, bearing his illness,
Continued, step by step,
On the road toward the town of Kuśinagara.
At that time, the World-honored One rose from his seat and walked around
by himself for a while. When he arrived under a tree, he again said to Ānanda,
“My shoulder pain is pressing me. Spread my sitting cloth.”
Ānanda at once spread [the sitting cloth] and the Tathāgata took his seat
on it to catch his breath. Ānanda venerated [the Buddha] and then sat to one
side.
Passing by was a [former] lay disciple, Ālāra Kālāma^20 Pukkusa by name,
who was on the way from the town of Kuśinagara to Pāvā. He saw the Buddha
resting under a tree, with his handsome appearance and calm senses and
mind, restrained in sublime quiescence, like a great dragon in transparent
water, pure and spotless. Pukkusa was delighted, and with good intent arising
in his heart he approached the Buddha. After venerating him [by touching
his forehead to the Buddha’s feet], Pukkusa withdrew to sit at one side and
said to the Buddha:
```

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

```
O World-honored One, whoever has renounced family life is remarkable
because he stays in a place pure and clean, and seeks the abode of hap-
piness and transcendence. Even if five hundred oxcarts were to pass
by before him, such an ascetic would neither see nor hear them. My
teacher was once silently sitting under a tree by the roadside between
the two towns of Kuśinagara and Pāvā. Then five hundred carts passed
before him. Despite the loud noise of the carts, though awake, he did
not hear any of the noise created by the carts, sir. At that time, a man
came and asked him, “Did you see the carts that passed by here a short
time ago, sir?” My teacher replied, “No, I did not see them.” Again he
asked, “Did you hear the noise, sir?” [The teacher replied,] “No, I did
not hear it.” So the man asked once again, “At that time were you here
or somewhere else, sir?” My teacher replied, “I was here.” [The man]
then asked, “Were you awake at the time, sir?” He replied, “Yes, I was
awake.” Again, the man questioned him, “Were you awake or were
you asleep, sir?” He replied, “I was not asleep.” The questioner silently
thought to himself, “This is marvelous; when this ascetic was in his
concentration, even though fully awake he did not hear any of the loud
noise of the carts.” He then said to my teacher, “A short while ago, five
hundred carts passed by on this road, sir. But you did not hear anything,
even when the carts shook [the ground] loudly. How much less would
you be able to hear anything other than that noise.” Then, giving greetings
to my teacher and with a delighted heart, the man departed, sir.
```

The Buddha said to Pukkusa:

```
I shall now question you; answer me as you like. Which of the two do
you think is more difficult: While awake, not hearing anything of the
multiple carts passing by, or not hearing anything when lightning and
thunder shake the ground?
```

Pukkusa replied:

```
Even tens of thousands of carts cannot match the loud noise made by
thunder and lightning. It is not so difficult for an ascetic to not hear
the noise of carts as [compared to] not hearing thunder and lightning,
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
sir. When thunder and lightning shake the ground, not hearing that
sound is definitely far more difficult, sir.
The Buddha said to Pukkusa:
Once, while visiting the village of Ātumā, I stayed in a grass-thatched
abode. Ominous clouds arose, accompanying a storm of some magnitude.
Thunder and lightning shook [the entire area] and mortally struck two
brother farmers and their four oxen. Many people gathered because of
this [unfortunate] event. At that time, I was outside the abode, engaged
in a meditative walk, roaming [the field]. A man left the gathering and,
after venerating [me] by bowing his forehead toward my feet, began to
walk along with me. I was aware of a person at my side and asked him,
“What are those people that are gathered there doing?” The man asked
me, “Where were you a little while ago, sir? Were you awake or asleep?”
I answered, “When I am walking like this, I am certainly not asleep.”
The man was again impressed and exclaimed to himself, “This is mar-
velous! When one acquires concentration he becomes like the Buddha,
who, even though awake, hears nothing when in total quiescence, even
as thunder and lightning shake the entire sky and earth with a resounding
noise.” Then he said to [me], “A short while ago ominous clouds arose,
accompanying a storm of some magnitude. Thunder and lightning shook
with tremendous noise and struck two brother farmers and their four
oxen, killing them. Many people have gathered here because of that
event, sir. [But I now realize that] this [concentration] is the right place,
sir.” This man, with joy in his heart, was delighted with the Dharma
and, after venerating [me], went on his way.
At that time Pukkusa took up two golden garments of extraordinary value,
worth a hundred thousand [cash], and rose [from his seat]. Kneeling respect-
fully with palms joined together, he said to the Buddha, “May I present these
two garments to the World-honored One as a gift, sir. May your holiness
accept this gift.”
The Buddha said to Pukkusa, “You should dedicate one garment to me
and the other to Ānanda.” Then, following that advice, Pukkusa presented
one [garment] to the Tathāgata and the other to Ānanda as gifts. The Buddha
```

19b

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

accepted it out of compassion. Then Pukkusa, having venerated the Buddha, 
stayed to one side. The Buddha began to teach the Dharma, encouraging, ben- 
efiting, and delighting him by expounding upon the doctrines of (1) charity, 
(2) morality, (3) rebirth in heaven, (4) abandoning unclean and impure desires 
as a great danger, (5) determining that any ongoing defilement from passion 
is an obstacle, and (6) the commendability and necessity of the path of dis- 
tancing oneself from both suffering and pleasure as the best [step toward the 
spiritual goal]. 
The Buddha then observed that Pukkusa’s mind was filled with joy, had 
become receptive without hindrance, and was ready to be educated. In accor- 
dance with the rule of all buddhas, he taught Pukkusa (1) the doctrine of the 
noble truth of suffering and the remaining three truths: (2) the truth of the cause 
of suffering, (3) the truth of the cessation of suffering, and (4) the truth of the 
path of cessation. At that time, Pukkusa, with pure and genuine faith, like a 
white cloth that can easily be dyed any color, immediately in that single session 
[at his seat] removed himself from all defilement and acquired genuine insight 
into the nature of the Dharma; realized the Dharma as he envisioned it; became 
determined to abide in the right path, without falling into any evil course; and 
thus attained the state of fearlessness. He then said to the Buddha:

Now, I humbly take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. May 
your holiness grant me permission to become a lay devotee. From now 
on until my life ends, I will not harm life, steal, indulge in sexual mis- 
conduct, lie, or ingest intoxicants. May your holiness grant me per- 
mission to become a lay devotee. 
Again he said to the Buddha: 
If your holiness should visit or sojourn in Pāvā, may you pass by the 
poverty-stricken houses and proceed directly to my residence. Whatever 
I have in my house, food and drink, couch and bed, garment and cloth, 
hot water and medicine, will be ready for use in the service of the 
World-honored One. If your holiness accepts my humble charity, my 
household will be blessed, becoming safe and peaceful, sir. 
The Buddha said, “What you have said is good.” At that time, the World- 
honored One [further] taught the Dharma to Pukkusa, encouraging, benefiting,

```

```
and delighting him. Pukkusa stood, venerated the Buddha by bowing his
forehead to his feet, and departed with delight in his heart.
Not long after Pukkusa left, Ānanda presented the golden garment to the
Tathāgata, and the Tathāgata accepted it for Ānanda’s sake, and put it on. At
that moment, in his whole expression the World-honored One looked most
composed, his aura of authority as expansive as ever, his senses pure and
immaculate, and his complexion harmoniously delightful. Observing this,
Ānanda remained silent and thought to himself:
It has been twenty-five years since I began to serve the Buddha as his
personal attendant, but I have never before seen him with such a won-
derful appearance, emitting a shining ray of light like that of gold.
At once Ānanda stood up and, kneeling with his right knee on the ground
and both palms joined together, said to the Buddha:
During the twenty-five years in which I have attended your holiness,
I have never seen the Buddha’s complexion so bright and golden as it
is now, sir. I do not know why this is so. May your holiness explain to
me why this is so?
The Buddha said to Ānanda:
There are two reasons why the complexion of the Tathāgata becomes
especially different from its usual [aspect]. First, it happens when the
Buddha realizes perfect enlightenment for the first time; second, it hap-
pens when the Buddha decides to take the course of final nirvana, for-
saking his span of life. O Ānanda, in these two situations, such a bright
complexion becomes prominent and distinct from the ordinary.
At that time, the World-honored One continued in verse:
The golden robe, delightful its reflection,
Fine and soft to the touch, clean and fresh,
Pukkusa offered it to the World-honored One,
He, emitting from the forehead
A ray as white as snow.

Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

The Buddha said to Ānanda, “I feel thirsty. I need water. Please go and 
fetch some.” Ānanda replied:

A while ago, five hundred carriages crossed the river upstream, causing 
the water to become muddy, and it has not returned to its normal trans- 
parency, sir. It can be used for washing the feet but not for drinking, sir. 
In this manner, the Buddha asked him three times, “O Ānanda, please go 
and fetch water.” Ānanda replied: “Not too far from here there is a river called 
Kakuṭṭhā, the water of which is clean and cool and can be used for drinking 
as well as for bathing, sir.” Then a spirit that resided in the Himalaya mountains, 
a believer in the Buddhist path, immediately scooped up clean water of eight 
qualities with a bowl and offered it to the World-honored One. With compas- 
sion, the Buddha received [the water] and uttered the following verses:

```
In eight kinds of voice,
The Buddha asked Ānanda to fetch water, saying:
“I am thirsty. Now I wish to drink water.”
Having finished drinking the water,
He reached Kuśinagara.
His soft, pleasant voice and
The meaning of what he spoke
Equally pleased the minds of the people.
Attending the Buddha closely,
Ānanda said to the World-honored One:
“In the distance, five hundred carts entered the stream and
Crossed the river to the yonder shore,
Making its water muddy and unsanitary for drinking.
The Kakuṭṭhā River is not far from here.
Its water is beautiful, clean, and cool.
It is better to drink water there and
Also to bathe your body in that river.”
A spirit residing in the Himalaya
Fetched water for the Tathāgata.
Having finished it, the World-honored One
Regained his strength and

Walked with gait of a lion.
In the waters [of that river] a dragon abides,
[The water is] clear and transparent,
Spotless, with no speck of dust.
With his holy appearance resembling [in grandeur] the Himalayas,
The World-honored One crossed the Kakuṭṭhā River
In peace and tranquility.
At that time, the World-honored One crossed the Kakuṭṭhā River and,
after drinking water and bathing himself, he went on with the host of bhikṣu s.
On the way, the World-honored One wished to rest and stopped under a tree.
He asked [Venerable] Cundaka, “Take out the saṃghāṭī robe, fold it into four
layers, and spread it on the ground. I must rest as my back pain presses me.”
As instructed, Cundaka spread out the robe and the Buddha took his seat
upon it. Having venerated the Buddha, Cundaka remained at one side and
then said to the Buddha, “I wish to take the course of entering nirvana, sir.”
The Buddha said to him, “You know it is the right time.” Thereupon Cundaka
entered final nirvana in the presence of the Buddha. At that time the Buddha
uttered these verses:
The Kakuṭṭhā River where the Buddha arrived
Was clean, with no mud whatsoever.
After bathing his body in the water,
The Most Honorable among Humans
Crossed the river to the yonder shore and
Said to Cundaka, who was leading the group of bhikṣu s:
“I say that I now feel my body is exceedingly exhausted.
Spread the cloth on the ground.”
Folding up the robe into four layers,
Cundaka spread it on the ground.
When the Tathāgata had rested [and caught] his breath,
Cundaka, seated before him, said to the Buddha:
“May I take the course of entering nirvana, sir.
Now I am ready to reach the place
Where there is neither love nor hate,
The yonder ocean, immeasurably meritorious.”
```

20a

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

The [Tathāgata,] highest among humans, 
Replied to him: 
“You have done what should be done. 
Now is the right time.” 
[Having] obtained his permission, 
Cundaka doubled his exertion in concentration and 
Thus accomplished total cessation. 
He was gone, like a flame that has been extinguished. 
Thereupon, Ānanda stood up from his seat, stepped forward, and enquired 
of the Buddha, “How should the funeral rite be conducted after the nirvana 
of the Buddha, sir?” The Buddha replied, “You should instead be quietly 
concerned with what you should accomplish [in your religious life]. Leave 
the matter to the lay devotees who themselves wish to conduct it.” Ānanda, 
however, asked him again three times, “How should the funeral rite be con- 
ducted after the nirvana of the Buddha, sir?” The Buddha replied,

If you wish to know the funeral rite for the Buddha, you should conduct 
it exactly as you would conduct the rite for a universal ruler. 
Ānanda again asked, “How should the funeral rite for the universal ruler 
be conducted, sir?” The Buddha said to Ānanda:

```
First, you should bathe the body in warm scented water, cover the
entire body with new cotton cloth, wrap it in a cloth equally as long
as five hundred pairs of garments, place the body within a golden coffin,
pour sesame oil over it, place the golden coffin inside a second, larger
iron vault, cover it with a sandalwood vault, cover that vault with a
thick pile of a various incense, and then cremate the entire thing. After
retrieving the ashes, build a commemorative tower (stupa) or shrine
at each major crossroads and hang a picture on a rock pillar set before
it, so as to enable the citizens of the country who are passing on the
roads to view the towers of the universal ruler of the law, [thereby]
causing a sense of affection to arise in their hearts toward his benevolent
rule, thus bringing about a beneficial influence upon the populace.
O Ānanda, if you wish to conduct the funeral rite for me, you should
bathe my body with warm scented water, cover the entire body with

new cotton cloth, wrap it in a cloth equally as long as five hundred 
pairs of garments, place the body within a golden coffin, pour sesame 
oil over it, place the golden coffin inside a second, larger iron vault, 
cover it with a sandalwood vault, cover that vault with a thick pile of 
various incense, and then cremate the entire thing. After retrieving my 
ashes, build a commemorative tower or shrine at each major crossroads 
and hang my picture on a rock pillar set before it, so as to enable who- 
ever passes on the road to view the Buddha’s tower, refreshing his 
sense of affectionate regard for the religious deed accomplished by the 
Tathāgata, and encouraging him to strive for his own goal of happiness 
in life when born into this world, and to obtain the opportunity to be 
reborn in heaven when he dies. 
Then the World-honored One contemplated the matter once more and 
uttered the following verses:

```
Ānanda stood up from his seat, and
Kneeling down respectfully,
Said to the World-honored One:
“After the nirvana of the Tathāgata,
How should his funeral rite be conducted?”
[The Buddha replied:]
“O Ānanda, you should instead be quietly concerned
With what you should accomplish in life.
Leave the matter to the lay devotees
Who themselves wish to conduct it.”
Then, because Ānanda again
Repeated his enquiry three times,
The Buddha thus replied,
Explaining the funeral rite of the universal ruler.
“In conducting the funeral rite for the Tathāgata,
One should wrap his body with a long garment cloth,
Place it in the coffin, and then in a second vault.
[After cremation,] erect a commemorative tower or shrine
At every major crossroads
So as to benefit sentient beings.
```

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

Whoever comes to venerate and 
Pay respect to the tower 
Will acquire immeasurable merit. 
The Buddha said to Ānanda, 
There are four kinds of [supreme] personalities in the world, for whom 
a commemorative tower (stupa) should be erected, and for whom offer- 
ings of incense, flowers, images, canopies, song and dance, and food 
should be made. What are these four? They are, first, the Tathāgata, 
for whom the commemorative tower should be erected; second, the 
solitary buddha ( _pratyekabuddha_ ); third, the saintly disciple ( _śrāvaka_ ); 
and fourth, the universal ruler ( _cakravartin_ ). These are the four kinds 
of personalities for whom the commemorative tower should be erected, 
and the rite of offering incense, flowers, images, canopies, song and 
dance, and food should be conducted. 
At that time, the World-honored One continued in verse: 
The Buddha should be commemorated 
In the primary tower, and 
Then follow the _pratyekabuddha,_ 
The _śrāvaka_ buddha, and 
The universal ruler ( _cakravartin_ ). 
For these four towers, 
Administered under the authority of the primary one, 
There should be conducted offering rites. 
The Tathāgata referred thus to the stupas of the Buddha, 
The _pratyekabuddha,_ the _śrāvaka_ buddha, and 
The universal ruler ( _cakravartin_ ). 
At that time, the World-honored One said to Ānanda, “Let us go to the 
town of Kuśinagara, to the spot between two _śāla_ trees.” Replying, “Yes, 
sir,” Ānanda together with the host of _bhikṣu_ s surrounded him and proceeded 
on the road. Then a _brāhmaṇa_ who happened to be on the road between the 
towns of Pāvā and Kuśinagara saw the World-honored One from a distance 
and observed his handsome appearance, senses well restrained in sublime

quiescence. Delighted in heart and with good intent, he approached the 
Buddha and, after greeting him, withdrew to one side and said to him:

O World-honored One, the village of my residence is not too far from 
this place. May I request, O Gautama, that you sojourn overnight 
there, and after partaking of the morning meal proceed to the town of 
Kuśinagara. 
The Buddha replied to the _brāhmaṇa,_ “May you ask me no more. Your 
offering has already been made.” The _brāhmaṇa,_ however, respectfully repeated 
his request three times. The Buddha replied as before, but advised the _brāh- 
maṇa,_ “Ānanda is coming along behind me. Speak to him about your wish.” 
Thereupon, as instructed, the _brāhmaṇa_ immediately went to Ānanda. After 
greeting him with a bow, he withdrew to one side and said to him:

The village of my residence is not far from here. I humbly wish that 
Gautama accept my invitation to visit there for my offering. After the 
morning meal, his holiness may proceed to the town of Kuśinagara. 
Ānanda replied, “Ask no more. O _brāhmaṇa,_ your offering has already 
been fully appreciated.” The _brāhmaṇa,_ however, again respectfully repeated 
his invitation [for a second and] third time. Ānanda replied:

The weather is already hot, and the village is too far from the road. 
Since the World-honored One is exhausted, it is no longer feasible to 
[continue to ask] him about it. 
At that time, the World-honored One envisioned what was going on and 
uttered the following verse:

```
One who is endowed
With eyes pure and genuine
Proceeded on the road,
With exceeding fatigue,
Toward the pair of śāla trees.
A brāhmaṇa saw the Buddha from a distance;
Quickly he approached him.
Having greeted him with a bow, the brāhmaṇa said:
```

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

“The village of my residence is in this neighborhood. 
With compassion, may your holiness come to stay overnight. 
I shall set forth the next day’s meal in the morning. 
Thereafter, may your holiness take the course toward town.” 
[The Buddha said:] 
“O _brāhmaṇa,_ my body is exhausted. 
It is too far for me to go that way. 
My close attendant is coming behind. 
May you go and speak to him.” 
As instructed, the _brāhmaṇa_ 
Came to Ānanda at once and 
Said to him: 
“I just invited the Buddha to come to my village, and 
After the next day’s meal 
Leave upon his journey, sir.” 
Ānanda said: 
“Please, ask no more. 
The weather is already hot, and 
It is not feasible for the World-honored One 
To visit your residence.” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ repeated his wish three times, but in vain. 
[The Buddha said:] 
“No one is free from worry and affliction, 
Nor can he be satisfied or at ease, 
Ah! With these conditioned elements ( _saṃskṛta-dharma_ s) so 
evanescent, 
Never remaining unchanged. 
Now, at the spot between the pair of _śāla_ trees, 
I shall extinguish this body 
Though already free from defilement ( _anāsrava-kāya_ ). 
The Buddha, _pratyekabuddha, śrāvaka,_ 
All equally return to this nirvana, 
Because there is no other choice 
With the way in which the world is impermanent 
Like a forest ablaze with fire.

```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

At that time, having reached the town of Kuśinagara, the World-honored 
One proceeded through the original land of the Mallan clanspeople toward 
the pair of _śāla_ trees, and he instructed Ānanda:

Set up my bedding between the pair of _śāla_ trees, with my head to the 
north and facing toward the west. For my teaching will spread toward 
the north and flourish there for some time. 
With his answer, Ānanda spread the sitting cloth on the ground with the 
head toward the north. At that time, the World-honored One folded his 
_saṃghāṭī_ robe into four layers by himself, lay down on his right side, and 
placed his left foot on top of the right, like a lion. Then the tree spirits abiding 
between the twin _śāla_ trees, with their firm faith in the Buddha, scattered 
flowers that were blooming out of season. At that moment the World-honored 
One said to Ānanda: “These spirits of the twin _śāla_ trees made an offering 
of flowers blooming out of season. This is not a true offering for the Tathāgata, 
however.” Ānanda enquired, “What kind of things are regarded as true offer- 
ings for the Tathāgata, sir?” [The Buddha] answered, “When a person receives 
the Dharma well and practices it well, this is regarded as a true offering for 
the Tathāgata.” Having contemplated on the meaning of this, the Buddha 
uttered the following verses:

```
The Buddha laid himself down
Between the twin śāla trees
With his mind undisturbed.
The tree spirits, with their minds pure and genuine,
Scattered flowers upon the Buddha.
Ānanda enquired of the Buddha:
“What is a true offering?’
[The Buddha replied:]
“Having received the Dharma well, and
Practiced it well,
One offers the flower of enlightenment.
Even scattering the purplish-golden flower garlands
Over the Buddha does not make a true offering.
Only when one realizes the insight of nonself
```

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

With the five aggregates, 
This is the best, primary offering.” 
At that time, Venerable Upavāna was sitting before the Buddha, fanning 
him. The Buddha said to him, “Upavāna, leave the place where you are and 
make that space open.” Then Ānanda quietly thought to himself:

Upavāna has always been by the Buddha’s side, serving him with what- 
ever he needed. He is so devoted to the Tathāgata that he never tires 
of looking at him. Now this is the Buddha’s last moment; he should 
be permitted to see his last moment. The Buddha, however, asks him 
to leave his position. What is his reason for doing that? 
Thinking thus, Ānanda rearranged his robe, proceeded forward, and said 
to the Buddha:

```
Upavāna has always been by the Buddha’s side and has served your
holiness with whatever was needed. He is so devoted to the Tathāgata
that he never tires of looking at [you]. Now it is your holiness’ last
moment; he should be allowed to attend this moment. Yet your holiness
asks him to withdraw from his position. What is your holiness’ reason
for doing so, sir?
The Buddha said to Ānanda:
Beyond this town of Kuśinagara, there are regions within the range of
a distance of twelve yojana s where great distinguished spirits reside
in concentration, leaving no empty space. These spirits equally wish
that [Upavāna] should not stand before the Buddha because they wish
to witness my last moment, but this monk’s eminence in authority and
virtue and his luminous body obstruct their vision and direct access
for their veneration and offerings. O Ānanda, for this reason I have
asked him to withdraw from in front of me.
Ānanda said to the Buddha:
What kind of merit has this honorable bhikṣu accumulated, and also
what kind of discipline has he practiced, for which he has realized an
aura of authority and virtue such as that, sir?
```

The Buddha replied to Ānanda: 
During the period ninety-one eons ago, there appeared a buddha in this 
world, Vipaśyin by name. This _bhikṣu_ then, with delight in his heart, 
held a grass torch to illuminate the commemorative tower of that 
buddha. Because of this deed, now his aura of authority and virtue 
reaches the twenty-eighth level of the heavens, making the gods of the 
lower heavens unable to compete with him in splendor. 
At that time, Ānanda rose from his seat, rearranged his robe to expose his 
right shoulder, respectfully knelt with his right knee on the ground, and, with 
his palms joined together, said to the Buddha:

```
May the World-honored One refrain from taking the course of entering
nirvana in this region near a small, rustic town. Why, sir? There are
many large capitals elsewhere—Campā, Vaiśālī, Rājagṛha, Vṛji, Śrāvastī,
Kapilavastu, and Vārāṇasī, sir. In those centers there are many people
and clanspeople who cherish their faith in the Buddha’s teaching
(Dharma). After the nirvana of the Buddha, they surely will enshrine
the ashes most respectfully and with veneration, sir.
The Buddha replied:
Speak no more. You should not produce prejudice. Nor should you
regard this region as [merely] rustic countryside. Why is this so?
Once upon a time, this country had a king, Mahāsudarśana by name.
At that time this town was called Kuśavatī and it was that great king’s
capital, one hundred twenty miles in length and seventy miles wide. At
that time, the crops and rice harvests were abundant, the citizens were
prosperous, and the city was protected by seven rings of moats and
seven levels of railings as well. Records were inscribed on iron plates
[hung on the railings], and metallic bells were hung between them. The
depth of the city wall was twenty-four feet (below the ground) and the
height was ninety-six feet from the ground. The height of the tower
cloister was a further ninety-six feet above that building, and the cir-
cumference of its main pillars was twenty-four feet. The four sides of
the city were embellished with four precious materials, such as a golden

wall endowed with a silver gate [on the first side]; a silver wall endowed 
with a golden gate [on the second]; a lapis lazuli wall endowed with a 
quartz gate [on the third]; and a quartz wall endowed with a lapis lazuli 
gate [on the fourth side]. The railings inlaid in these four sides were 
also embellished with the same four precious materials. To the golden 
tower were attached silver bells, to the silver tower were attached golden 
bells, while the seven moats were filled with all kinds of lotus flowers: 
blue, pink, red, and white. Golden sands spread in the depths of the 
water revealed the bottom of the moats, while palm trees were planted 
on those narrow banks. These golden palm trees bore leaves, flowers 
and fruits made of silver; the silver palm trees bore leaves, flowers, and 
fruits made of gold; likewise, the palm trees made of quartz bore flowers 
and fruits made of lapis lazuli, while the lapis lazuli palm trees bore 
flowers, and fruits made of quartz. Between these palm trees there were 
a number of bathing ponds with clean streams, deep pools, all pure and 
spotless, demarcated by tiles studded with the four precious materials. 
There were golden stairways with silver steps, silver stairways with 
golden steps, and lapis lazuli stairways with golden steps. The steps of 
some lapis lazuli stairways were inlaid with quartz, while the steps of 
some quartz stairways were inlaid with lapis lazuli. The railings that sur- 
rounded the city were continuous, and within the city there grew palm 
trees here and there. The golden palms bore leaves, flowers, and fruits 
made of silver; the silver palms bore leaves, flowers, and fruits made of 
gold; the quartz trees bore flowers and fruits made of lapis lazuli; the 
lapis lazuli trees bore flowers and fruits made of quartz. Between these 
trees there were placed four kinds of ponds [each respectively] filled 
with four kinds of lotus flowers. 
The streets and houses were neatly aligned, and the town blocks 
were well organized with parallel streets running horizontally as well 
as vertically. Quantities of flowers scattered by the wind fell upon the 
streets. A mild breeze arose four times [daily], passing through these 
trees, creating soft sounds like those of heavenly music. The people 
of this country, male or female, adult or child, played among these 
trees and enjoyed their games.

In that country ten kinds of sounds were always heard, [those pro-
duced by:] (1) a conch shell, (2) a drum, (3) a hand drum, (4) singing,
(5) dancing, (6) musical instruments such as flutes, (7) elephants, (8)
horses, (9) carriages, and (10) gatherings in which people were drinking,
eating, joking, and laughing.
At that time, King Mahāsudarśana was endowed with seven precious
treasures and enjoyed four blessings. He was the universal ruler of all
four quarters of the earth under the sky. What are these seven treasures?
They are: (1) the golden wheel, (2) the white elephant, (3) the dark-
blue horse, (4) the divine gem, (5) the jadelike queen, (6) the house-
holder, (7) the military commander. The following was the way in
which the universal ruler managed to use his first treasure, the golden
wheel. The king bathed in scented water on the full moon day, the fif-
teenth of the month, and ascended to the top of a pavilion surrounded
by the palace ladies. The sacred wheel then appeared of its own accord
before the king, with a thousand spokes of rich color and splendor. It
was built by a heavenly master and did not belong to the human world.
Made of genuine gold, it had a diameter of thirty-two feet.
King Mahāsudarśana quietly thought to himself:
I once heard from my virtuous elders the following words: “When
a king of the kṣatriya race, anointed on his head for the throne, takes
a scented bath on the full moon day, the fifteenth of the month, and
ascends to the top of the pavilion surrounded by the palace ladies,
then at that moment the golden wheel is supposed to appear before
him of its own accord. The wheel has a thousand spokes of rich
color and splendor. It is built by a heavenly master and does not
belong to this world. It is made of genuine gold and has a diameter
of thirty-two feet. Thereupon, the king is called the cakravartin,
‘one who turns the sacred wheel.’”
Now I see this wheel before me, but who knows if this shall
really work. I should now test this treasured wheel.
Then King Mahāsudarśana called the four divisions of the army to
assemble. He faced the golden wheel directly and, rearranging his gar-
ment to expose his right shoulder and kneeling with his right knee on
```

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

the ground, he rubbed the wheel with his right hand and spoke to the 
wheel: “Let the wheel turn itself toward the east, turning as it should, 
without losing regularity.” The wheel at once began to roll toward the 
east. Then King Mahāsudarśana followed after the wheel leading the 
four divisions of his army. When the golden wheel was turning forward, 
the four guardian gods were in charge of guiding it. Wherever the wheel 
stopped, the king stopped his chariot. 
At that time, having seen the great king approaching, the rulers of 
the small countries in the eastern regions prepared a golden bowl filled 
with silver grains and a silver bowl filled with golden grains, stepped 
forward toward the king, and, with heads bowed, said to him:

```
Welcome, great king. The eastern countries are now blessed with
an abundance of harvests and produce, the people are prosperous,
the nature of the populace is friendly and harmonious, and all are
filial to their parents and loyal to their rulers. O holy ruler, your
majesty is recommended to govern these lands through offices estab-
lished here. We shall closely attend your majesty and will execute
your commands as you wish, sir.
```

At that time, King Mahāsudarśana replied to the rulers of the small 
countries:

```
Enough, dear wise kings, your offerings have already been appre-
ciated by me. Your kingships rule these countries on the basis of
the right Dharma, so that neither injustice nor wrong action can take
place in your countries. I say that these two principles embody my
governance.
```

After listening to his exhortation, the kings of the small countries then 
accompanied him on his inspection tour until they reached the eastern 
ocean. 
Next, the great king proceeded toward the south, then to the west, 
and then to the north; in whichever direction the wheel rolled, the [king 
and his army] followed. The kings of the small countries in these regions 
all abnegated their dominions for the sake of the great ruler, just as the 
eastern rulers had done.

```
At that time, King Mahāsudarśana, having already made a complete
round of the four oceans by following the golden wheel, educated the
populace in the path of morality, provided security in their lives, and
then returned to his own country. The golden wheel continued to hover
in midair above the palace gate. Rejoicing by dancing and leaping, King
Mahāsudarśana said, “This treasure, the golden wheel, is truly my bless-
ing. Now I am truly the universal ruler who turns this sacred wheel.”
This is called the realization of the first treasure, the golden wheel.
Next, the following describes how the king was able to use his sec-
ond treasure, the white elephant. When King Mahāsudarśana was seated
in the main hall of the palace early in the morning, the white elephant
of its own accord suddenly appeared before him. The color of its hair
was pure white, the seven parts of its body (four feet, two shoulders,
and neck) were equally developed, and it could fly in midair. The neck
had mixed colors, the six tusks were delicate and studded with real
gold pieces. Then, having seen the elephant, the king thought to himself,
“This elephant is supposed to be wise and good- natured. If it is well
trained, it can serve me in riding.” He immediately tried to see if it
could be trained, and it revealed a capacity fit for all training. Then,
wishing to take his first ride, King Sudarśana mounted the elephant,
went out of the capital in the morning, made a round of all four oceans,
and by breakfast time he had already returned to his palace. Then,
rejoicing by dancing and leaping, the King Sudarśana said, “This white
elephant is truly my blessing. Now I am truly the universal ruler who
turns the sacred wheel.” This is called the realization of the second
treasure, the white elephant.
Next, the following describes how the king was able to use his third
treasure, the horse. King Sudarśana was seated at the main hall early
in the morning when of its own accord the horse suddenly appeared
before him. Its color was dark blue, but it had a long mane and tail,
red in color. Its head and neck were like those of an elephant, and it
could fly in midair. Having seen the treasured horse, the king thought
to himself, “This horse is supposed to be wise and good-natured. If it
is well trained, it can serve as my steed.” He immediately tried to see
if it could be trained, finding that it revealed a capacity fit for all training.

Then, wishing to take his first ride, King Sudarśana mounted the horse, 
went out of the capital in the morning, made a round of all four oceans, 
and by breakfast time he had already returned to his palace. Then, 
rejoicing by dancing and leaping, King Sudarśana said, “This dark- 
blue horse is indeed my blessing. I am now truly the universal ruler 
who turns the sacred wheel.” This is called the realization of the third 
treasure, the dark-blue horse. 
Next, the following describes how the king was able to use his fourth 
treasure, the divine gem. King Sudarśana was seated at the main hall 
early in the morning when of its own accord the divine gem suddenly 
appeared before him. The quality and color of this gem were evident 
in its clear transparency and purity. Having seen the divine gem, King 
Sudarśana thought to himself, “This gem is mysterious and very nice; 
it is supposed to be able to illuminate a region as wide as this entire 
palace compound when light shines upon it.” Wishing to test the gem 
himself, King Sudarśana immediately called the four divisions of his 
army and placed the gem on top of the flagpole. In the darkness of the 
night, he carried the flag pole and went out of the city. The gem emitted 
a ray of light that illuminated the entire army, just as if it were daytime. 
Then, rejoicing by dancing and leaping, King Sudarśana said, “Now 
this treasured gem is truly my blessing. I am truly the universal ruler 
who turns the sacred wheel.” This is called the realization of the fourth 
treasure, the divine gem. 
Next, the following describes how the king was served by his fifth 
treasure, the jadelike queen. The treasured queen suddenly appeared 
before the king, her complexion well composed, beautiful in appearance, 
neither too tall nor too short, neither fleshy nor bony, neither too light 
nor too dark, neither too hard nor too soft, her body warm in winter 
and cool in summer. The scent of the _sandal_ tree radiated from the 
roots of her hair throughout her body and the scent of a blue lotus 
emananted from her mouth. Her words and speech were invariably 
gentle and her manner was stable; she never failed to awake before the 
king or to stay awake until the king fell asleep. As King Sudarśana had 
realized purity [by extinguishing defilement] and was totally freed from 
attachment, he did not keep her in his mind even for a moment [as an

obstacle]; how much less could he have approached her physically [as
an object of desire]? Rejoicing by dancing and leaping, King Sudarśana
said, “This treasured jadelike queen is indeed my blessing. I am now
truly the universal ruler who turns the sacred wheel.” This is called
the realization of the fifth treasure, the jadelike queen.
Next, the following describes how the king was assisted by his sixth
treasure, the householder. The householder gentleman suddenly
appeared of his own accord before the king, and the storehouses were
automatically filled with immeasurable riches and treasures. This person
was endowed with special vision due to his past merit; namely, he was
able to see any treasure buried underground, whether or not it belonged
to others. He protected the treasures that belonged to some owners,
while yielding those with no ownership to the king’s treasury. The
householder came to the king and said to him, “O great king, may you
have no worry about the stipend payments. I am able to manage the
funds by myself, sir.”
The king wished to test the gentleman treasurer. He arranged an
excursion on a pleasure boat, and while aboard, the king said to the
treasurer householder, “I need some gold pieces. Provide them to me
at once.” The treasurer replied, “O great king, give me a bit of time,
and I shall go to the shore, sir.” Pressing him further, the king said, “I
cannot stop this boat now. Bring the golden treasure right away.” Having
received the king’s urgent order, the householder kneeled down on the
boat and dipped his right hand into the water. A series of urns filled
with treasures arose from the water, following his hand upward, just
as insects cling to tree branches. The other treasurers too joined him,
all equally dipping their hands into the water to draw up immeasurable
treasures, and the boat was soon filled with treasure. The householder
gentleman then asked the king, “Your majesty needed some gold treas-
ure before; how much more do you need, sir?’ Then King Sudarśana
said, “Bring no more treasure. I do not need any more. I only wished
to test your ability. Your service has already been appreciated.” On
hearing the king’s words, the householder returned all the treasures to
the water. Then, rejoicing by dancing and leaping, King Sudarśana
said, “This treasure householder is indeed my blessing. I am now truly

the universal ruler who turns the sacred wheel.” This is called the real- 
ization of the sixth treasure, the householder. 
Next, the following describes how the king was assisted by his sev- 
enth treasure, the military commander. The military commander, having 
excellent knowledge, strategy, valor, and toughness, bright and decisive, 
suddenly appeared. He went to King Mahāsudarśana and said to him, 
“Great king, may you have no worry, sir, if you should wish to punish 
any country. I shall be able to handle the task, sir.” King Sudarśana 
then, to test him, immediately called the four divisions of the army and 
told the general, “Make the entire army ready for battle. Assemble 
those who have not come forth, release those who have already come; 
let those who are not well prepared get ready for battle, and release 
those who are already well prepared. Let those who still remain in the 
assembly to return home, and let those who have already returned stay 
in their places.” Then, having heard the king’s words, this military 
commander at once assembled those who did not come forth to the 
assembly, released those who had already assembled, let those who 
were not well prepared get ready, released those who were already pre- 
pared, let those who still remained in the assembly to return home, and 
let those who had already returned home stay in their places. At that 
time, rejoicing by dancing and leaping, King Sudarśana said, “This 
treasured military commander is truly my blessing. I am now truly the 
universal ruler who turns the sacred wheel.” O Ānanda, this is called 
the realization of the seventh treasure by the universal king who turns 
the golden wheel. 
What are the four kinds of blessings that pertain to the universal 
ruler? First, as the universal king, he has longevity and can never meet 
with an early death; in this no one can match the king. Second, he has 
a strong physical body and never contracts illness; in this no one can 
match the king. Third, he has the most handsome appearance; in this 
no one can match the king. Fourth, his storehouses are filled with treas- 
ures; in this no one can match the king. The foregoing are the seven 
treasures and four blessings that pertain to the universal ruler. 
O Ānanda, after a rather long time had passed, King Sudarśana 
had his carriage prepared, visited the royal park grove, and said to his

```

```

```
charioteer, “You should safely return [alone] with this carriage. The
reason is that I must contemplate whether or not the state and the
citizens are safe and will be free from oncoming danger.” The citizens
who happened to see the king on the streets said to his attendant, “Pro-
ceed slowly, we wish to see the countenance of the holy ruler.” O
Ānanda, King Sudarśana was concerned about the people as well as
with their material needs, just as a father is concerned about his children.
The people felt affection toward the king as if he was their father. They
made gifts of all kinds of rarities to the king, saying, “May his majesty
accept this” and “May this be of his majesty’s use.” The king replied,
“Bring no more, dear subjects, I have my own treasures. You should
keep these things for yourselves.”
On another occasion, the king thought to himself, “Now I should
build a palace building.” About the same time that this idea came to his
mind, the citizens of the country all said to King Sudarśana, “We wish
now to build a palace building for your majesty, sir.” The king replied,
“Even if I wish to accept your gifts I have enough treasures of my own,
sufficient for building the palace pavilion.” The people, however, further
repeated their wish to the king, “We wish to join in your majesty’s task
of building the palace pavilion, sir.” The king was finally obliged to
reply, “I shall follow your wish.” As soon as their wish was granted,
the citizens filled eighty-four thousand carts with gold and brought them
to the capital city, Kuśavatī, to build the Su dharma pavilion.
At that time, the heavenly being ( deva ) Viśvakarman, master of
architectural building and resident of the second Trāyastriṃśa heaven,
quietly thought to himself, “Only I myself, together with King Su -
darśana, could build the Sudharma pavilion on such a grand scale.” O
Ānanda, the god Viśvakarman subsequently constructed the Su dharma
pavilion, fifteen miles in length and seven and a half miles wide, embel-
lished with the four precious materials, with a straight and even foun-
dation, and with seven layers of tiles piled upon each other to make
the stairways. The pillars of this Sudharma pavilion were as many as
eighty-four thousand, consisting of golden pillars with silver beam
supports, silver pillars with golden beam supports, and likewise, lapis
lazuli pillars with quartz beam supports and quartz pillars with lapis
```

```

```

lazuli beam supports. There were four railings around the pavilion, 
made of the four precious materials mentioned before. The four stairways 
were also made of the four precious materials. Above the Sudharma 
pavilion were built eighty-four thousand towers; each of the golden 
towers had a silver door, while each of the silver towers had a golden 
door; in similar manner, each of the quartz towers had a lapis lazuli 
door, while each of the lapis lazuli towers had a quartz door. Each of 
the golden towers was equipped with silver couches, while each of the 
silver towers was equipped with golden couches. Each couch was cov- 
ered with a soft and fine cushion woven of golden thread; the lapis lazuli 
and quartz couches were also covered with similar cushions. The bright- 
ness of the pavilion was so blinding to viewers’ eyes that it was like the 
intense light of the sun, such that no one could look directly at it. 
Then King Sudarśana thought to himself, “I should build pools with 
palm trees around them on both sides of the pavilion.” The four sides 
of the pools were each one _yojana_ long. The king again thought to 
himself, “In front of the Sudharma pavilion there should be set the 
Dharma pond.” When it was built, each of its four sides were one 
_yojana_ long. The water was clean and clear, pure and spotless. The 
bottom of the pond was constructed with tiles made of the four kinds 
of precious materials as before. A railing was attached around the four 
sides of the pond, studded with four kinds of precious materials, such 
as gold, silver, quartz, and lapis lazuli. Inside the pond grew varieties 
of water grass and all kinds of lotus plants with blue, pink, red, and 
white flowers that released exquisitely delicate fragrance in all directions. 
The gardens that surrounded the four sides of the pool were also filled 
with varieties of blooming flowers, such as _atimukta ka, campaka, pāṭalī, 
sumanā, vārṣika,_ and _dhanuṣkari._ The pond was looked after by some 
caretakers, but if any citizens who passed by the pond wished to bathe 
in it they could do so, because it was cool and refreshing. Fruit juice as 
well as food were amply provided to anyone who wished to drink or 
partake of it, as much as they might desire. Clothing, carriages, horses, 
fragrant flowers, riches, and treasures were all available to anyone. 
O Ānanda, King Sudarśana had eighty-four thousand elephants, 
among which the treasured elephant, decorated with gold and silver

ornaments on which precious gems were strung, was foremost. He had
eighty-four thousand carriages mounted with bridles made of lion’s
hide, decorated with four precious gems, among which the divine gem
was foremost. He had eighty-four thousand horses, among which the
treasured horse, also decorated with ornaments of gold and silver on
which precious gems were strung, was foremost. He had eighty-four
thousand gems, among which the treasure, the divine gem, was fore-
most. He had eighty-four thousand women, among whom the treasure
of the jadelike queen was foremost. He had eighty-four thousand house-
holders, among whom the treasure of the householder gentleman was
foremost. He had eighty-four thousand soldiers, among whom the treas-
ure of the military commander was foremost. He had eighty-four thou-
sand cities, among which Kuśavatī was foremost. He had eighty-four
thousand pavilions, among which the Sudharma pavilion was foremost.
He had eighty-four thousand towers, among which the central tower
was foremost. He had eighty-four thousand couches all made of gold
and silver and various precious stones, which were covered with exqui-
site cushions and fine and soft spreads. He had eighty-four thousand
million garments, of which those made of hemp, muslin, and cotton
were foremost. He had eighty-four thousand kinds of food, of which
a meal was provided each day, all with different flavors.
O Ānanda, King Sudarśana, riding on the second treasure, the white
elephant, foremost among all his eighty-four thousand elephants, left
his capital in the morning, traveling the entire land under the sky,
making the round of the four oceans, and returning within a short time
to his castle for the morning meal. The king, riding on the third treasure,
the dark-blue horse, foremost among all his eighty-four thousand
horses, left his capital in the morning, traveled the entire land under
the sky, made the round of the four oceans, and returned within a short
time to his castle for the morning meal. The king, riding on the first
treasure, the golden wheel vehicle, [drawn by] the treasured horse,
foremost among all his eighty-four thousand vehicles, left his capital
in the morning, traveled the entire land under the sky, made the round
of the four oceans, and within a short time returned to his castle for
the morning meal.

The king used the fourth treasure, the divine gem, foremost among
all his eighty-four thousand gemstones, to illuminate the entire palace
compound, making night as bright as day. He had the sixth treasure,
the jadelike queen, foremost among all of his eighty-four thousand
ladies, serve him at his side. The king entrusted the sixth treasure, the
householder gentleman, foremost among all his eighty-four thousand
householders, with managing financial matters. The king entrusted the
seventh treasure, the military commander, foremost among all of his
eighty-four thousand soldiers, with [the duty of] disciplining any [mis-
creants] among the troops.
King Sudarśana’s central capital city, foremost among the eighty-
four thousand cities he ruled, was Kuśinagara. The king always stayed
at the Sudharma pavilion, foremost among all of his eighty-four thou-
sand pavilions. The king always stayed at the central tower, foremost
among all of his eighty-four thousand towers. The king always sat on
the quartz seat, foremost among all of his eighty-four thousand seats,
because it was best for meditation. He ordered all of his eighty-four
thousand million garments to be inlaid with precious stones. Donning
a garment at one’s will is done out of modesty externally as well as
internally. The king always ate naturally grown rice, preferring it from
among all the eighty-four thousand different kinds of meals, because
he knew the proper amount of food for his best health.
The eighty-four thousand elephants came to the capital city and
injured and killed sentient beings on innumerable occasions. The king
then thought to himself, “These elephants come around frequently,
causing innumerable injuries and damage; from now on, each elephant
shall be permitted to come only once during a hundred-year period.”
In this way, a rotation system was put in order. When a hundred years
had passed, it started over again from the beginning.

#### Third Episode

At that time, the Buddha said to Ānanda:

```
Then King Sudarśana contemplated to himself, “What kind of merits
did I originally accumulate, what kind of good discipline did I practice,
```

```
23c
```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

```
such that I have now acquired such an august and splendid reward as
universal rulership?”
Again he contemplated to himself, “I have acquired this fortunate
reward due to three causes. What are the three? First, charity ( dāna );
second, morality ( śīla ); and third, meditation ( dhyāna ). Because of
these causes, I have now acquired such a great reward.”
The king again contemplated to himself, “I have now already
acquired this fortunate reward as a human; I must further upgrade my
practice of good karma so as to be rewarded a heavenly destiny. I
should sacrifice myself, withdraw from daily noise and trouble, reside
in a secluded place, and practice the path.”
The king then said to his treasured queen, Sumatī, “I have now
already obtained this splendid reward as a human, I must further
improve my practice of good karma so as to be rewarded a heavenly
destiny. I should sacrifice myself, withdraw from daily noise and trouble,
reside in a secluded place and practice the path.”
The queen replied, “I understand, sir.” She thus notified [everyone]
both within and without [the palace] to cancel appointments to attend
as well as receive an audience [with the king].
Thereupon, King Sudarśana ascended to the Sudharma pavilion,
entered the golden cloister tower, and sat on the silver couch. He con-
templated the eradication of defilements, such as avarice, carnal desire,
craving, evil, and wrongdoing; he realized the first meditative state of
absorption ( dhyāna-samādhi ), in which there is an awareness of an
object and an act of examining while the sense of joy and bliss increase
through removal of the cause of birth, thus reaching the supramundane
sphere. Next, eliminating the awareness of an object and the subjective
act of examination, with tranquility or self-confidence (Pāli saṃpasā-
dana ) increasing, continually applying concentration of the mind, he
proceeded to the second meditative state of absorption, in which there
is neither the awareness of an object nor a subjective act, the sense of
joy and bliss predominating in the arising state of concentration. Next,
the sense of joy fading away, dwelling in the sense of equanimity, fully
aware of subtler bliss, he reached the third meditative state of absorption
in which one experiences the mindfulness and bliss sought by the wise

and holy practitioner. Next, transcending both pain and pleasure, 
removing sorrow and joy, he realized the fourth meditative state of 
absorption in which there is neither pain nor pleasure, but an increase 
of the state of equanimity ( _upekṣā_ ) that consolidates pure and genuine 
mindfulness. 
Thereupon, King Sudarśana arose from the silver chair, came out 
of the golden cloister tower, went to the central tower, sat on the lapis 
lazuli chair, and practiced the four kinds of immeasurable minds ( _brah- 
mavihāra_ s), first by permeating friendly love ( _maitrī_ ) infinitely in one 
direction, and then likewise in the remaining three directions. Thus he 
extended his immeasurable mind of benevolence universally in all 
directions, neither [divided] nor bound to limitation. Casting away var- 
ious feelings of hatred, leaving no ill will in his mind, the king enjoyed 
the state of tranquility and silence, compassion and tenderness. He also 
completed the remaining three practices, namely, the immeasurable 
mind of compassion ( _karuṇā_ ), the immeasurable mind of sympathetic 
joy ( _muditā_ ), and the immeasurable mind of equanimity ( _upekṣā_ ). 
At that time, the treasured queen quietly thought herself, “I have 
not seen his majesty for some time and wish to set up an occasion for 
audience. I shall now notify the king of this.” Then the treasured queen 
Sumatī said to the eighty-four thousand palace ladies, “May all of you 
bathe in warm scented water and attire yourselves in formal dress. 
Since we have not seen his majesty for some time, we are going to see 
the countenance of his majesty.” As instructed, the palace ladies bathed 
and properly attired themselves. Then Queen Sumatī also said to the 
treasured military commander, “May your leadership assemble the 
four divisions of the army. Since we have not seen his majesty for some 
time, we are going to have an audience.” Thereupon, the treasured mil- 
itary commander, having assembled the four divisions of the army, 
reported, “The four divisions of the army have already been assembled. 
Whenever your ladyship is ready.” Thereupon, leading the eighty-four 
thousand palace ladies, accompanied by the four divisions of the army, 
the queen reached the golden palm tree grove. The sound of the mul- 
titude reached the king’s cognizance. Having heard the sound, the king 
looked through a window and saw the treasured queen standing by the

doorside. Seeing the queen, the king said to her, “Please halt there and
do not proceed. I am coming out of this cloister.”
Thereupon, King Sudarśana stood up from the quartz seat, came out
of the central tower, came down to the Sudharma pavilion, and together
with the treasured queen, walked toward the palm tree grove, [where
he] took his seat in the prepared position. At that time, the great king
Sudarśana’s complexion was more luminous than on ordinary days. The
queen thought to herself, “Now, his majesty’s complexion exceeds that
seen on other ordinary days. What kind of auspicious sign is this?”
Then Queen Sumatī said to the king, “Your majesty’s complexion
exceeds that of ordinary days. This may not be an auspicious sign, but
is it because your majesty has decided to forsake the span of life, sir?
Among the eighty-four thousand elephants, foremost is the treasured
white elephant decorated with gold and silver ornaments from which
precious gems are strung. The elephant, the precious gem, and so on
are themselves your majesty’s possessions. I entreat your majesty: be
reminded of these treasures and enjoy a further span of this life with
us. May your majesty not forsake your life span and leave tens of thou-
sands of your subjects without their ruler.
“Again, among the host of eighty-four thousand horses, the treasured
horse is foremost. Among the eighty-four thousand chariots, the treas-
ured golden wheel is foremost. Among the eighty-four thousand gems,
the divine gem is foremost. Among the eighty-four thousand women,
the treasured jadelike lady is foremost. Among the eighty-four thousand
householders, the treasured householder gentleman is foremost. Among
the eighty-four thousand warriors, the treasured military commander
is foremost. Among the eighty-four thousand cities, Kuśinagara is fore-
most. Among the eighty-four thousand pavilions, the Sudharma pavilion
is foremost. Among the eighty-four thousand towers, the central tower
is foremost. Among the eighty-four thousand thrones, the bejeweled
throne is foremost. Among the eighty-four thousand million garments,
the soft and smooth garment is foremost. The eighty-four thousand
kinds of meals are each different and exquisite in taste. All of these
varieties of treasures, without exception, belong to your majesty. I
entreat your majesty: be reminded of these treasures and enjoy a further

```

span of life with us. May your majesty not forsake your life span and 
leave tens of thousands of subjects without their ruler.” 
At that time, King Sudarśana replied to the queen, “Your ladyship, 
since olden days you have assisted me in the virtues of mercy, gentle- 
ness, respectfulness, and obedience, and you have never uttered a care- 
less word. Why do you say this to me now?” 
The queen said to the king, “I do not understand, sir. How could 
my statement be contrary to your majesty, sir?” The king replied to the 
queen, “The things to which you have referred, namely, the elephants, 
horses, chariots, the golden wheel, the palace pavilion and cloister, the 
good garments, the exquisite meals—all these are impermanent and 
cannot be held for a long time. Though you have urged me to remain 
in this life, how can I follow this request?” 
Queen Sumatī said again to the king, “I do not understand, sir. Your 
majesty is my merciful teacher. What else could I say, sir?” The king 
replied, “If you understand that the elephants, horses, chariots, golden 
wheel, pavilions and cloisters, garments, and exquisite meals are all 
impermanent, and hence cannot be held beyond a temporary period of 
time, you would not exhaust your mind and thoughts out of attachment 
to these things. The reason is that I have no more life left and must 
soon leave for the next life. It is the universal rule that whenever there 
is birth, there is death; whenever there is a meeting, there is a separation. 
Who could, once born into this life, live forever? One should sever 
oneself from affection and love and give weight to the path of seeking 
the ultimate goal. Such are [what I consider to be] words of respect 
and obedience.” 
O Ānanda, at that time, having heard the king’s exhortation, the 
treasured lady wept and cried in sorrow. Wiping away her tears, she 
said to the king, “Your majesty, those elephants, horses, chariots, golden 
wheel, pavilions and cloisters, renowned garments, exquisite meals, 
are all impermanent and hence cannot be held beyond a temporary 
period of time, sir. May your majesty not exhaust your mind and thoughts 
out of attachment to these things. Your majesty has no more time left 
in the span of life and must soon leave for the life to come. It is the uni- 
versal rule that whenever there is birth, there is death; whenever there

is a meeting, there is a separation. Who could, once born into this life, 
live forever? One should sever oneself from affection and love and 
give weight to the path of seeking the ultimate goal, sir.” 
O Ānanda, as the treasured lady was uttering this statement, King 
Sudarśana suddenly passed away. Just as when a valiant soldier bites 
into a delicious morsel, there was no suffering or agony. The king’s 
spirit ascended to the seventh Brahmā Heaven (i.e., the twentieth of 
thirty-three heavens). Seven days after the death of the great king 
Sudarśana, the treasures of the golden wheel, the divine gem, and so 
on all disappeared of their own accord. The treasures of the elephant, 
the horse, the ladyship, the master householder, and the military com- 
mander all passed away on the same day the king died. The castle, the 
ponds, the Sudharma pavilion, the cloister tower, the ornamented items, 
the golden palm tree grove—all turned into earth and forest. 
The Buddha continued, saying to Ānanda: 
Whatever is conditioned is impermanent, is subject to change, and nec- 
essarily ends in cessation. When one does not mind avarice and pursues 
it, he will exhaust his life. When one is attached to someone with affec- 
tion and love, he will not find the limit of satisfaction. Only those who 
have realized the right insight and thus see the path as it really is can 
know the limit of satisfaction. 
O Ānanda, I recall that in my past lives I returned to this land six 
times to become the universal ruler and laid my ashes in this land. In 
this [seventh] life, I have accomplished supreme, perfect enlightenment 
and once again forsake my life span and lay my ashes at this place. 
There will be no more birth and death after this, and hence, no land 
where my body may be placed after this. This is the last and the limit 
of my life cycle, with no more birth hereafter. 
At that time, the World-honored One was about to reach final cessation 
in the spot between the paired _śāla_ trees in the _śāla_ grove, the original place 
of the Mallan clan, in the city of Kuśinagara. He instructed Ānanda,

```
Go to the city of Kuśinagara and tell the Mallan clanspeople, “Wise
friends, you should know that the Tathāgata is going to enter final nirvana
```

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

in the middle of this night under the twin _śāla_ trees. You should be 
there to ask him about whatever doubts you have [regarding religious 
salvation] and directly receive his answer and instruction. Do not make 
cause for regret by missing this opportunity.” 
Thus instructed, Ānanda rose from his seat and, after venerating the Buddha, 
left for Kuśinagara. With tears in his eyes he went into the city, accompanied 
by a _bhikṣu_. At that time he happened to see that five hundred Mallan clans- 
people were gathering in a place for some purpose. Seeing Ānanda approaching 
them, the Mallans stood up to greet him but, remaining at one side, they 
enquired, “It is strange to see the venerable coming into town now, at this 
time. It is already almost evening. What is your purpose, sir?” 
With tears in his eyes, Ānanda said to them: 
I came here in order to benefit you. I announce to you, wise friends, 
that the Tathāgata is about to enter final nirvana in the middle of this 
night. You should go ask him about whatever doubts you have [regard- 
ing your salvation] and directly receive his answer and instruction. Do 
not make cause for regret by missing this opportunity. 
At that time, having heard this news, the Mallan clanspeople loudly cried 
out in grief, their bodies twisting and falling to the ground as they fainted, 
then recovering consciousness, just as when huge trees fall due to the complete 
loss of their roots’ hold, their branches breaking in a mess [on the ground]. 
They lamented in unison:

```
How is it that so soon the Buddha should go to cessation? Why must the
Buddha go to cessation so quickly? When the Eye of Insight of the world
ceases to be, all sentient beings will surely wither for a long time to come.
Ānanda was then obliged to console the Mallans:
Please stop your wailing and do not be grief-stricken. There is no one
in heaven or on earth who once his life has begun it will not end. No
matter how hard we try to make conditioned things continue in their
existence, such a result is totally out of the question. Hasn’t the Buddha
said frequently that whenever there is a meeting, there is a separation?
Whatever has its birth has its death as well.
```

```
The Mallan clanspeople then said to each other:
We shall go home at once and then go to the twin śāla trees accompa-
nied by our families, as well as taking with us white cloth equally as
long as five hundred suits of garments.
The Mallan clanspeople then returned home at once and, accompanying
their families and taking with them a white cloth equally as long as five hun-
dred suits of garments, they started out from Kuśinagara to the site of the
twin śāla trees, where Ānanda [awaited their arrival].
Seeing the Mallan clanspeople approaching, Ānanda thought to himself:
“There are too many people. If each of them wishes to see the Buddha, he
will have passed away before everyone in the line has seen him. I should
present all of them to the Buddha together before midnight.” Thus he led the
five hundred Mallan clanspeople and their families to the place where the
Buddha was, and after venerating him by bowing his forehead to the Buddha’s
feet, he stood to one side. He then stepped forward and said to the Buddha:
So-and-so, so-and-so, [these] Mallan clanspeople and their families
respectfully enquire of the World-honored One as to whether or not
he is at ease with his rising and sitting, and whether he feels strong or
weak in his walking, sir.
The Buddha replied [to all the Mallan clanspeople], “I appreciate your
visit and wish you a long life and freedom from illness and pain.” In this
manner, Ānanda guided the Mallan clanspeople and their families to see the
Buddha. Subsequently, they venerated the Buddha by bowing their foreheads
to his feet, and sat to one side. The World-honored One then taught them
about the impermanence of life, encouraging, benefiting, and delighting them.
With a feeling of delight in their hearts, after listening to the teaching the
Mallan clanspeople presented to the Buddha the white cloth, equally as long
as five hundred sets of garments, which they had brought with them. The
Buddha accepted it for the sake of their merit. The Mallan clanspeople rose
from their seats and, having venerated the Buddha, departed.
At this time, there was a brāhmaṇa ascetic in the city of Kuśinagara,
Subhadra by name. He was as old as one hundred twenty years of age, well
established in his career, and renowned for his knowledge. Having heard
```

25a

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

that the _śramaṇa_ Gautama was taking the course of cessation, he thought to 
himself:

I still have some doubt regarding religious salvation in the matter of 
Dharma. Only Gautama alone understands the meaning of my doubt. 
Now I should see him, visiting there by my own strength. 
At once, he left the city of Kuśinagara during the night, [traveling to] the 
twin _śāla_ trees, and arrived at the place where Ānanda was. Having greeted 
him, he stood to one side and said to Ānanda:

I was informed that the _śramaṇa_ Gautama is going to enter cessation 
during this night. I have come here because of that. I wish to meet him 
because I have a doubt about a religious matter on the nature of Dharma. 
By meeting Gautama, I wish to settle my mind once and for all. If there 
is some extra time, may I be allowed to see him, sir? 
Ānanda replied, “O Subhadra, do not impose [your questions] on him. 
The Buddha is physically very ill. You should not bother him.” 
Subhadra, however, firmly requested repeatedly, saying three times: 
I have heard that the Tathāgata appears in this world only once in a 
long period of time, like the _udumbara_ flower that blooms only very 
rarely and intermittently. Therefore, I have dared to come here, because 
I wish to settle my doubt. May I see the Buddha even for a short time, 
if he can spare any moment at all? 
Ānanda replied in the same way, “The Buddha is physically very ill. You 
should not bother him.” However, the Buddha said to Ānanda:

Do not prevent him. Let him come here and permit him to settle his 
doubt. It will not bother me too much. If he listens to my answer to 
his question on the subject of Dharma, he will surely be able to resolve 
his problem 
Ānanda immediately conveyed the Buddha’s permission to Subhadra, 
“If you wish, you may see him whenever you are ready.” At once Subhadra 
went in and, having greeted the Buddha with a bow, sat to one side and said 
to him:

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
I have been troubled by a doubt on the matter of religious salvation,
sir. If your holiness has a moment, may you help me to settle my doubt
once and for all, sir.
The Buddha replied, “Question me as freely as you wish.” Subhadra then
asked:
Why, O Gautama, are there a number of teachers, each of whom respec-
tively claim that they themselves are the true teachers, for example,
Purāṇa-kāśyapa, Maskarin-gośālīputra, Ajitakeśa-kambalin, Kakuda-
katyāyana, Sañjayin-vairāṭīputra, and Nirgrantha-jñātiputra. These teachers
all hold different doctrines. O śramaṇa Gautama, I wish to know whether
or not your holiness has understood all these doctrines without exception.
The Buddha said:
Do not ask me to talk about all these doctrines. Let me simply say that
I know all of them without exception. For now, for your sake, I shall
teach you the very profound and subtle doctrine. Listen attentively,
and you should contemplate and remember [what I shall now say].
Subhadra focused his attention on the teaching. The Buddha said to him:
If whatever doctrine among these schools lacks the practice of the
eightfold noble path ( āryāṣṭāṅgika-mārga ), it can neither yield the fruit
of the first saintly state, nor that of the second, nor that of the third,
nor that of the fourth. O Subhadra, if any of these doctrines had this
practice of the eightfold noble path, it should have yielded the fruit of
the initial state of spiritual development, or that of the second, or that
of the third, or that of the fourth. O Subhadra, there is the practice of
the eightfold noble path in my teaching; hence it yields the fruits of
the first saintly state, the second, the third, and the fourth. But no other
school or group of practitioners has this fruit of the śramaṇa.
At that time, the World-honored One uttered the following verses for Su -
bhadra:
In the twenty-ninth year of my life,
I renounced family life
```

25b

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

To seek the path of religion (i.e., the good path). 
O Subhadra, it has been already fifty years now 
Since I realized enlightenment. 
I have practiced morality, concentration, and wisdom, 
And I have been in solitary thought in seclusion. 
Now, I am explaining to you the essentials of my teaching. 
There is no saintly realization 
Through anything else but this practice. 
The Buddha said to Subhadra, “If _bhikṣu_ s diligently worked for the goal 
of deliverance, this world would be filled with arhats and would not be a for- 
saken place.” Subhadra then said to Ānanda:

His teaching assures us that if every _śramaṇa_ has already been practicing 
the practice of austerity under the guidance of Buddha, is currently 
engaged in the practice of austerity, and will continue to carry it out 
properly in the future, [that _śramaṇa_ ] will be able to realize the great 
result. O Ānanda, you too have realized that great result since you have 
been engaged in the practice of austerity under the guidance of the 
Tathāgata. I have directly met the Tathāgata and have been able to ask 
him about my doubts; therefore, I should be able to realize that great 
result. Now, the Tathāgata has assured me that as his disciple I too am 
able to accomplish such a great result. 
Then he asked the Buddha, “May I now renounce my family life under 
the Tathāgata’s Dharma and be ordinained to receive the vow of the precepts?” 
The Buddha told Subhadra:

```
If a brāhmaṇa ascetic, [previously] a student of another school, wishes
to be ordained for the practice of austerity under my Dharma [and
Vinaya], there is set a probation period of four months during which
he should be subjected to observation as to his practice and his per-
sonality. If he is able to maintain dignity and proper manners, he may
be ordained under my Dharma [and Vinaya] to receive the vow of pre-
cepts. O Subhadra, you should know that it depends on the nature of
the candidate’s conduct.
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
Subhadra again said to the Buddha:
I understand, sir, that in the case of a student ascetic of any other school
there is a probation period of four months during which he should be
subjected to observation as to his practice and his personality. If he is
able to maintain dignity and proper manners, he may be ordained under
your authority of Dharma [and Vinaya] to receive the vow of precepts.
I have served in the right Dharma for the duration of four years by
now, sir. I have maintained my dignity and proper manner without
omission. I should be entitled to the ordination, sir.
The Buddha replied, “I have already said that it depends solely on the
person’s conduct.” As it happened, that night Subhadra went forth from
family life to be ordained, strove for perfection in the practice of austerity,
directly experienced for himself in the present life [the realization] that the
cause of birth and death is exhausted; the practice of austerity was accom-
plished; what should be done [for religious salvation] was thus accomplished;
and Subhadra realized the insight into the nature of things as they really are
and the subsequent insight that there would be no further birth for him. Before
the night had passed he realized the ultimate state of arhatship. Thus he was
regarded as the last direct disciple of the Buddha. Thereupon, it was Subhadra
who initially passed away into cessation, and the Buddha entered into final
cessation afterward.
At that time, Ānanda was standing behind the Buddha and stroking the
edge of the bed couch he wept bitterly, unable to control himself. Weeping,
he said:
How is it that so soon the Buddha should go to cessation? Why must
the Buddha go to cessation so quickly? How swiftly the great religion
(i.e., the Dharma) is lost and obscured. When the Eye of the World
ceases to be, sentient beings shall surely wither for a long time to come.
Why? Though I have received the Buddha’s teaching and have been
practicing moral discipline, before I am able to realize what should be
done in my religious path he will have gone to cessation forever.
At that time the World-honored One, though [already] knowing [the
```

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

answer], deliberately questioned the _bhikṣu_ s, “Is the _bhikṣu_ Ānanda present 
now?” The _bhikṣu_ s replied:

```
The bhikṣu Ānanda is standing behind your holiness, sir. Stroking the
edge of the bed couch, he weeps bitterly in sorrow, unable to control
himself, sir. While sobbing, he lamented, “How is it that so soon the
Buddha should go to cessation? Why must the Buddha go to cessation
so quickly? How swiftly the great religion (the Dharma) is lost and
obscured. When the eye of the world ceases to be, sentient beings shall
surely wither for a long time to come. For what reason? Though receiv-
ing the Buddha’s teaching and being able to practice moral discipline,
before I am able to realize what should be done in my religious path,
he will have gone to cessation forever.”
The Buddha said to Ānanda:
May you grieve no more, nor do not wail any more. Since you began to
serve as my personal attendant I have noticed an incomparable and
immeasurable sense of love (i.e., benevolence) in your physical conduct,
an incomparable and immeasurable sense of love in your verbal conduct,
and an incomparable and immeasurable sense of love in your volitional
conduct. O Ānanda, you have attended me with care ( paricarati ). Your
merit is great, far superior to that of anyone, whether they are gods, evil
ones, Brahmā, śramaṇa s, or brāhmaṇa s. You must continue to exert
yourself. It will not be too long before you realize enlightenment.
Thereupon, the World-honored One said to the bhikṣu s:
Those disciples who personally attended the past buddhas were also
like Ānanda. Those disciples who will personally attend future buddhas
will also be like Ānanda. Each of those personal attendants of the past
buddhas knew what his master wished of him only after he was told,
but my attendant Ānanda now knows what I wish him to do through
observing my eyes: “The Tathāgata wishes to have this done. The
World-honored One wishes to have that done.” This is a wondrous
realization of excellence on Ānanda’s part. You should acquire this
kind of excellence.
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
The universal ruler had four kinds of wondrous excellence. What
are the four? First, whichever country the holy ruler happened to visit,
all the people of that land assembled to welcome his arrival with the
sense of hospitality. Second, they were delighted in seeing the ruler
and rejoiced in listening to his exhortation. Third, they never tired of
viewing his dignified countenance. Fourth, regardless of whether he
was walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, all the officials and the
populace came to see him, were delighted to see him, rejoiced in lis-
tening to his exhortation, and never tired of viewing his dignified coun-
tenance. These are the four signs of the extraordinary popularity of the
universal ruler.
I point out now that our Ānanda is also endowed with four such
kinds of popularity. What are the four? First, when Ānanda joins the
gathering of bhikṣu s, even without [speaking] a word, the members of
the sangha are delighted. Second, when he preaches the Dharma to the
members of the sangha, they are delighted to listen to it. Third, they
are also delighted to observe his dignified manner and listen to his preach-
ing, and they never tire of doing so. Fourth, regardless of whether it is an
assembly of bhikṣuṇī s (nuns), lay [male] householders ( upāsaka s), or
[lay] female householders ( upāsikā s), when he joins their meeting, even
without [speaking] a word, the participants of that meeting are delighted
to see him, rejoice in listeningto his preaching, and never tire of viewing
his dignified countenance and pleasant manner. These are his four kinds
of excellence.
At that time, Ānanda rearranged his robe to expose his right shoulder,
kneeled with his right knee on the ground, and said to the Buddha:
O World-honored One, at present, the śramaṇa s of all regions, well
learned and knowledgeable, those who clearly understand the collection
of scriptures and disciplines and who are endowed with excellent virtue
and noble conduct, have all come to see the World-honored One.
Because of this I have been able to venerate and respect them, closely
associate with them, and greet them with a bow. After the Buddha takes
the course of cessation, however, they will not return again, because
```

26a

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

```
there [will no longer be] someone to look up to, sir. What should be
done about this situation?
```

The Buddha replied to Ānanda:

```
Have no worry, for those sons of good families have four kinds of
thought recollection. What are the four? First, they are mindful of the
birthplace of the Buddha and will always be delighted to see it. They
will not forget it but cherish a feeling of yearning for it. Second, they
are mindful of the place of the Buddha’s initial enlightenment and will
always be delighted to see it. They will not forget it but cherish a feeling
of yearning for it. Third, they are mindful of the place of the Buddha’s
initial turning of the wheel of the Dharma and will always be delighted
to see it. They will not forget it but cherish a feeling of yearning for it.
Fourth, they are mindful of the place of the Buddha’s final nirvana and
will always be delighted to see it. They will not forget it but cherish a
feeling of yearning for it. O Ānanda, after my final nirvana, the merit
of those sons and daughters of good families who are mindful of the
time of my birth is as such. It is also like this with the merit of their
being mindful of how the Buddha’s supernormal power acquired
enlightenment. It is also like this with the merit of their being mindful
of how his initial turning of the wheel of the Dharma brought conver-
sion. It is also like this with the merit of their being mindful of how
the Buddha left the Dharma for them at the time of his final nirvana.
If they have each respectively completed their journeys and sojourns
to these places and have paid tribute to the Buddha at various com-
memorative towers and temples, they will be born in heaven after death,
except for those who [have already] realized enlightenment.
```

The Buddha said to Ānanda:

```
After my final nirvana, when the Śākya clanspeople come to seek the
path, you should permit them to renounce family life and grant them
the ordination vow of precepts for joining the sangha. You should not
make it difficult for them to stay on. If a follower of a non-Buddhist
school genuinely comes to seek the path, you should not impose the
```

```
four-month probation period. Why is this so? Even if he has different
thoughts regarding religion, after staying a while he may come to share
the original doctrine of the Dharma.
At that time, Ānanda knelt and, with his palms joined together, said to
the Buddha:
The bhikṣu Channa, because of his background, behaves in an insistent
manner regarding his own way. How should we deal with his behavior
after the Buddha’s cessation?
The Buddha said to Ānanda:
After my cessation, if Channa does not follow the standard manner of
dignity, refuses to follow the admonitions, all of you should apply the
punishment of verbal excommunication by instructing all bhikṣu s to
not exchange words with him, nor engage in forwarding or relaying
instructions to or from him.
At that time, Ānanda again said to the Buddha, “After the Buddha’s nir-
vana, what should be done with the female members who still refuse to take
the act of repentance, sir?” The Buddha replied to Ānanda, “No one should
meet with them.” Ānanda again said, “If someone [unexpectedly] encounters
them directly, what should be done, sir?” The Buddha replied, “You should
not exchange words.” Ānanda again asked, “If one is in an inevitable situation
of talking with them, what should be done, sir?” The Buddha replied, “One
should examine his own mind.” The Buddha continued:
O Ānanda, are you saying that after the Buddha’s nirvana there will
be no protective umbrella (i.e., cover) over your head or that you might
lose whatever you have? You should not entertain this kind of view.
Since my realization of enlightenment, the discourses and disciplines
that I have continually taught are your protectors and your possessions.
O Ānanda, from today onward, the bhikṣu s must be permitted to aban-
don trivial formalities and adopt the [simplified] rule of propriety as a
measure for distinguishing between senior and junior bhikṣu s. This is
called the rule of propriety for bhikṣu s.
The Buddha said to the bhikṣu s:
```

Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

If any of you have doubt regarding the Buddha, Dharma, or Sangha, 
or doubt regarding the path, you should question me at once. Don’t let 
this opportunity pass without asking me about your doubts, and later 
have regret because you did not do so now. As long as I am alive, I 
shall explain the subject with which your doubts are concerned. 
All the _bhikṣu_ s remained silent, not uttering a word. The Buddha again 
said to them:

If any of you have doubt regarding the Buddha, Dharma, or Sangha, 
or doubt regarding the path, you should question me at once. Don’t let 
this opportunity pass without asking me about your doubts, only later 
to have regret because you did not do so now. As long as I am alive I 
shall explain the subject with which your doubts are concerned. 
Once again all the _bhikṣu_ s did not utter a word, remaining silent. The 
Buddha again said to them:

If you do not question me about your doubts because you are afraid 
of shame within or without, bring up your questions to me by way of 
your colleagues. Don’t let this opportunity pass without asking me 
about your doubts, only later to regret not having done so now. 
The _bhikṣu_ s once again did not utter a word and remained silent. Ānanda 
said to the Buddha:

I have no doubt in my mind that all the members of this sangha are 
steady in genuine faith, sir. There is not even a single _bhikṣu_ who doubts 
the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha or the path. 
The Buddha said to Ānanda: 
I myself know that even the youngest _bhikṣu_ of this sangha now sees 
the path of practice and shall not fall into an evil course of life. The 
[ _bhikṣu_ s] will return seven times to this world and necessarily exhaust 
the fundamental cause of suffering. 
At that time, the World-honored One thus granted his assurance to the 
one thousand and two hundred _bhikṣu_ s regarding their respective goals of

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

realization. Thereupon, the World-honored One opened his upper robe to 
reveal his golden forearm and said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

You should contemplate the fact that the Tathāgata appears in this world 
only once in a long period of time, like _udumbara_ flowers that bloom 
only very rarely and intermittently. 
At that time, contemplating the meaning of this matter, the World-honored 
One repeated it in verse:

His right arm is of purplish-golden hue. 
The appearance of the Buddha 
Is like that of a divine gem. 
Things that pass away and 
Come into being are impermanent; 
[Hence] there is no dissoluteness in manifesting cessation. 
[The Buddha continued:] 
Therefore, O _bhikṣu_ s, be on guard against dissoluteness. It was on the 
basis of constant vigilance against indolence that I realized perfect 
enlightenment. An immeasurable number of sentient beings will also 
realize perfect enlightenment on the basis of constant vigilance against 
indolence. Of all things in this world, there is nothing whatsoever that 
exists forever. This is the teaching exhorted by the Tathāgata in his last 
moment of life. 
Thereupon, the World-honored One entered the initial state of meditative 
absorption; coming out of this state he then entered the second state of med- 
itative absorption; coming out of this state he then entered the third state of 
meditative absorption; coming out of this state he then entered the fourth 
state of meditative absorption; coming out of this state he then entered the 
first formless state of concentration on the sphere of infinite space; coming 
out of this state he then entered the second formless state of concentration 
on the sphere of infinite consciousness; coming out of this state he then 
entered the third formless state of concentration on the sphere of nothing or 
nonutility; coming out of this state he then entered the fourth formless state 
of concentration on the sphere of “neither ideation nor nonideation”; coming

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

out of this state he then entered the final state of cessation, transcendent from 
senses and ideation, equivalent to third saintly state of an _anāgāmin._ 
At this time, Ānanda asked Anuruddha, “Has the World-honored One 
entered final nirvana?” Anuruddha replied:

Not yet. O Ānanda, the World-honored One is now in the state of ces- 
sation. In olden days I directly heard from the Buddha that the final 
nirvana is entered from the fourth meditative state of absorption. 
Then at that time, the World-honored One, coming out of the state of ces- 
sation of ideation, entered into concentration on the sphere of “neither ideation 
nor nonideation”; coming out of this state he then entered into concentration 
on the sphere of nothing or nonutility; coming out of this state he then entered 
into concentration on the sphere of consciousness; coming out of this state 
he then entered into concentration on the sphere of space; coming out of this 
state he then entered into the fourth meditative absorption ( _rūpa-dhyāna- 
samādhi_ ); coming out of this state he then entered into the third meditative 
absorption; coming out of this state he then entered into the second med- 
itative absorption; coming out of this state he then entered into the first 
meditative absorption; coming out of this state he then entered into the sec- 
ond meditative absorption; coming out of this state he then entered into 
the third meditative absorption; coming out of this state he then entered 
into the fourth meditative absorption; coming out of this state he then 
entered final nirvana. 
Just at that moment the earth trembled greatly and heavenly gods and 
humans were greatly terrified. Various underworlds, dark and gloomy, in 
which neither the sun or moon shone, were equally illuminated, allowing 
those beings who were born therein to see each other, and they all exclaimed, 
“That person has been reborn here,” “That one too was born here,” [and so 
on]. A ray of light permeated the entire world, surpassing the luminosity of 
heavenly beings. Then from the thirty-third heaven various lotus flowers, 
blue _utpala,_ pink _padma,_ red _kumuda,_ and white _puṇḍarīka,_ dropped and 
scattered into the air over the Tathāgata as well as the assembled host of 
_bhikṣu_ s, and heavenly sandalwood powder also scattered over the Buddha 
below and the assembly of _bhikṣu_ s. The Buddha thus passed away into final 
nirvana. Thereupon, the god Brahmā uttered these verses from midair:

```

```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

```
Whoever belongs to the species of sentient beings
Should equally discard the configured aggregates of his being.
The Buddha is one who is highest,
Unsurpassed by any one of this world.
O Tathāgata, the Great Sage hero,
Endowed with fearless supernormal power,
Though he could remain forever,
He has now entered final nirvana.
At that time, the god Indra uttered the following verse:
No permanence is found
With the conditioned elements of an aggregate.
They embody nothing but the law of arising and perishing.
Once born, no one escapes from death.
The Buddha made his cessation the goal of happiness.
Then Vaiśravaṇa, guardian of northern heavenly quarter, composed the
following verse:
O fortunate trees and the great grove,
Those śāla trees acquired the highest fortune,
Because, at the spot between the twin śāla trees,
The best and most qualified
For offerings and merit-cultivation passed away.
Then Anuruddha composed the following verse:
The Buddha abides in unconditioned transcendence and
Does not depend on breathing in and breathing out.
He originally came from that total quiescence,
Where the Sun (i.e., the Buddha) himself set.
Then the bhikṣu Upavāna composed the following verse:
With neither indolence nor pride,
But with self-restraint,
He practiced the supreme faculty of prajñā.
```

27a

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

```
Free from attachment and untainted by defilement,
He was the foremost Honorable [One]
Who freed himself from craving desire.
```

Then, the _bhikṣu_ Ānanda composed the following verse:

```
Heavenly gods were terrified, and
Because of this their hair stood on end.
Everything was fulfilled and
The Perfectly Enlightened [One] took the course of cessation.
```

Then the god Kumbhīra also composed a verse:

```
This world has lost the protective umbrella.
Sentient beings shall remain blinded for a long time,
Nor will they see the Perfectly Enlightened [One],
The human Hero, the Lion of the Śākyas, again.
```

Then the guardian god Guhyaka composed the following verse:

```
Whether it in this life or in the next,
The residents of Brahmā Heaven
Could never see such a human hero
Like that of the Śākya lion.
```

Then, Māyā, the mother of the Buddha, composed the following verse:

```
The Buddha was born in the Lumbinī grove;
His religion has spread widely.
He returned to the place
From which he was originally born, and
Forsook his human body
That was subject to the law of impermanence.
```

Then the spirit of the twin _śāla_ trees composed the following verse:

```
We do not know when we may again
Make an offering of unseasonably blooming flowers,
After now scattering them over the Buddha like this.
```

```

```
Well endowed with
The ten supreme powers of authority and virtue,
The Tathāgata has entered final nirvana.
Then the spirit of the śāla forest composed the following verse:
This is the most satisfactory place
Where the Buddha grew up,
Where he turned his Dharma wheel, and
Where he has entered final nirvana.
Then the four guardians of the heavens composed the following verse:
With his highest transcendental knowledge,
The Tathāgata always taught
The doctrine of impermanence,
Rescued all sentient beings from the bondage of suffering,
And having realized the ultimate goal,
He has entered final nirvana.
Then the lord of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven composed the following verse:
During the period of millions of millions of kalpa s,
He sought the highest goal of the path,
Rescued sentient beings from the bondage of suffering,
And, having realized the ultimate goal,
He entered final nirvana.
Then the lord of the Yamaka underworld composed the following verse:
This is the last robe that the Buddha wore
Before his cessation.
Since the Buddha has gone to final nirvana,
To whom should this robe be given?
Then the lord of Tuṣita Heaven composed the following verse:
This is the last body of the Buddha,
In which the configuration of his aggregates
```

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns

Has been totally dissolved. 
There are neither thoughts of sorrow nor of joy, 
Nor any danger of birth and death. 
Then the lord of Nirmāṇarataya Heaven composed the following verse: 
The Buddha laid down 
Upon his right side; 
The Śākya lion entered final nirvana 
In this _śāla_ grove. 
Then the lord of Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven composed the following 
verse:

The world shall wither in darkness 
For a long time to come 
The moon, lord of the stars, fell away, and 
Hindered by the force of impermanence, 
The sun of great wisdom 
Is shadowed for a long time. 
At that time, the _bhikṣu_ s composed the following verse: 
This body is like a water bubble. 
Vulnerable as it is to any danger, 
Who could ever enjoy it? 
The Buddha obtained the imperishable body 
Like that of a diamond, and 
Yet his body is dissolved 
Because of the force of impermanence. 
The buddhas are in possession of the diamondlike body, 
Yet all are subject to the force of impermanence, 
So quickly perishing like a small pile of snow. 
How could anything else be any different from this? 
The Buddha thus entered final nirvana. Some of the _bhikṣu_ s fainted in 
sorrow and grief, casting themselves upon the ground, bitterly weeping, their 
bodies twisting, unable to control themselves. While weeping, they lamented:

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
How is it that so soon the Buddha should go to cessation? Why must
the Buddha go to cessation so quickly? How swiftly the great religion
(i.e., the Dharma) is lost and obscured! Sentient beings shall surely
wither for a long time to come, when the world has lost its Eye of Insight
forever, just as when huge trees fall due to the total loss of their roots’
hold, their branches breaking in a mess; or just as a snake, its head
chopped off, continues twisting and wriggling without knowing where
it is going.
Then some other bhikṣu s also fainted, grief-stricken, throwing themselves
to the ground, their bodies twisted, wailing loudly in grief, unable to control
themselves. While weeping, they lamented:
How is it that so soon the Buddha should go to cessation? Why must the
Buddha go to cessation so quickly? How swiftly the great religion (the
Dharma) is lost and obscured! Sentient beings shall surely wither for a
long time to come when the Eye of Insight of the world has ceased to be.
At that time, the elder bhikṣu Anuruddha said to those bhikṣu s, “All of
you, grieve no more. The host of heavenly beings above us are also curiously
voicing similar lamentations.” Then the bhikṣu s questioned Anuruddha, “How
many gods are there above us?” Anuruddha replied:
They fill the entirety of space, beyond calculation. All of them are
roaming in midair in confusion, weeping, wailing, stamping with grief,
and shedding tears, saying, “How is it that so soon the Buddha should
go to cessation? Why must the Buddha go to cessation so quickly?
How swiftly the great religion (the Dharma) is lost and obscured! Sen-
tient beings shall surely wither for a long time to come, when the world
has lost its Eye of Insight forever, just as huge trees fall due to the total
loss of their roots’ hold, breaking their branches in a mess, or just as
a snake, its head chopped off, continues to twist and wriggle without
knowing where it is going.”
At that moment, the heavenly beings, as described by Anuruddha, who
were roaming in midair in confusion, weeping, wailing, stamping with grief,
and shedding tears, said:

Buddha go to cessation so quickly? How swiftly the great religion (the 
Dharma) is lost and obscured! Sentient beings shall surely wither for a 
long time to come when the world has lost its Eye of Insight forever. 
Thereupon, throughout that night, the host of _bhikṣu_ s discussed the words 
of the Dharma and completed [the recitation] by the arrival of the dawn. 
Anuruddha said to Ānanda:

May you go to the city and tell the Mallan clanspeople, “The Buddha 
has already entered final nirvana. Those who wish to make tribute and 
offerings to the Buddha are commended to know that now is the appro- 
priate time.” 
At that time, Ānanda stood up and after venerating the Buddha, accompanied 
by a _bhikṣu_ , with tears on his face, he entered the city, where he happened to 
see five hundred Mallans gathered in one place for some reason. The Mallan 
clanspeople too, noticing Ānanda approaching them, stood up to greet him, 
venerated him [by bowing their foreheads to] his feet, and said to him, “Venerable, 
why have you come here so early, sir?” Ānanda replied:

Because I wish to benefit you, I have come here as quickly as possible 
this early morning. You should know that the Tathāgata already entered 
final nirvana last night. If you wish to make offerings, now is the appro- 
priate time. 
When the Mallan clanspeople heard this news, there was none among 
them who did not lament and grieve. Wiping tears from their faces, they said, 
“How is it that the Buddha has gone to final nirvana so soon? How is it that 
so swiftly the Eye of Insight has ceased to be in this world?” Ānanda 
responded:

```
Dear friends, weep no more. Even if one wished to prevent conditioned
things from changing, this is not at all possible. Did not the Buddha
teach us while he was alive that “whoever is once born is bound to die;
whenever one meets with another, he will be separated from the other;
and that there is none in this world whom we love and for whom we
feel affection who will exist forever”?
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
Then some Mallan clanspeople said to each other:
We should return home, and bringing with us various incense, flowers,
and musical instruments, go to the twin śāla trees as quickly as possible
to make offerings to the World-honored One or his ashes.
[Again, some other Mallans said:]
After an entire day of offerings, we should place the body on the couch,
let the Mallan youths lift the four corners of the couch, and carry the
canopy and the streamers. [We should] burn incense, scatter flowers,
and with accompanying musical performance, enter the city from the
eastern gate, make a round through various streets so as to allow all
the citizens of the country the opportunity to make offerings, then come
out of the western gate, proceed to a higher and visible place, and cre-
mate the body there.
Having discussed the proceedings, they went home to prepare incense,
flowers, and musical instruments, gathered at the twin śāla trees, and made
their offerings the whole day long. When the first day ended, they placed the
body on a couch, and a number of Mallan clanspeople got together and tried
to lift the couch, but they could not do so. Then Anuruddha said to the clans-
people. “You should leave the couch as it is. Do not exhaust yourselves in
vain. Soon some heavenly beings who wish to lift the couch will come.”
Some of the Mallan clanspeople questioned Anuruddha, “Why do these gods
wish to lift this couch, sir?” Anuruddha replied:
You have been planning to make offerings to the Buddha’s body with
incense, flowers, and music for the entire day, then to place the body
on the couch. The Mallan youths will then lift the four corners of the
couch and carrying the canopy and streamers, burning incense, scat-
tering flowers, and with accompanying musical performance, they will
enter the city from the eastern gate, making a round through various
streets so as to allow all the citizens of the country to have an oppor-
tunity to make offerings. They will then come out of the western gate,
proceed to a higher and more visible place, and cremate the body there.
Yet, according to their will, the heavenly gods wish to have the body

28a

```

remain in the same place for seven days, to be honored throughout that 
period with various offerings, and thereafter to place the body on the 
couch. Then the Mallan youths will lift the four corners of the couch, 
and carrying the canopy and streamers, burning incense, scattering 
flowers, and with accompanying musical performance, they will enter 
the city from the eastern gate, make a round through various streets so 
as to allow all the citizens of the country to have an opportunity to 
make offerings. They will then go out of the northern gate, cross the 
Hiraṇyavatī River to reach the Makuṭabandhana shrine, and cremate 
the body there. Because of this wish, the heavenly gods will not [yet] 
allow the couch to be lifted. 
The Mallan clanspeople said, “We agree, sir.” Splendid were the words 
of Anuruddha! It precisely accorded with the will of the heavens.

The Mallan clanspeople said to each other: 
Let us go back to the city and repair the roads and streets, clean them, 
and burn incense along them, then return here and continue to make 
offerings to the World-honored One for seven full days. 
All the Mallan clanspeople then returned to town, repaired the roads and 
streets, cleaned them, burned incense along them, and, coming out of the town, 
made offerings for seven full days at the twin _śāla_ trees by scattering flowers, 
burning incense, and playing musical instruments near the time of sunset on 
the last day. The body was then moved onto the couch. The Mallan youths lifted 
the four corners of the couch. They carried the canopy and streamers, scattered 
flowers, burned incense, and played musical instruments. In this manner, the 
[funeral] procession proceeded, calmly accompanied in front and behind by the 
leading group and the following group, respectively. 
Then the gods of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven scattered from midair various lotus 
flowers, blue, pink, red, and white, as well as heavenly sandalwood incense 
over the body of the World-honored One, thus filling up the streets with [these 
offerings]. Some heavenly beings played music and the spirits sang songs. Then 
the Mallan clanspeople spoke among themselves, “Halt the human performance 
of music and let the heavenly performance of music be an offering to the body.” 
In this manner, the Mallans carried the couch and proceeded gradually. Entering

the town from the eastern gate, they stopped at various streets to make offerings
by burning incense, scattering flowers, and performing music.
The daughter of a Mallan, a devoted believer of the path taught by the
Buddha, offered a golden flower garland as large as a carriage wheel. An
elderly woman gave praise in an uplifted voice:
These Mallans will acquire great benefit. For at the end of his career,
the Tathāgata entered final nirvana in this place, and it is for him that
all the citizens of this country are delightfully paying tribute by means
of various offerings.
Having completed the various offerings, the procession of Mallans then
departed from the northern gate of the city, crossed the Hiraṇyavatī River,
and reached the Makuṭabandhana shrine, where they placed the couch on
the ground. The Mallan clanspeople then said to Ānanda, “What else should
we do to make additional offerings?” Ānanda replied:
I closely heard from the Buddha and received an instruction directly
from him. The funeral rite should be exactly similar to that which
should be held for a universal ruler.
The Mallans asked him again, “How should the funeral rite for the universal
ruler be done, sir?” [Quoting the Buddha’s words,] Ānanda replied:
For a universal ruler, you should first bathe the body with warm scented
water, cover the entire body with new cotton cloth, wrap it in a cloth
equally as long as five hundred sets of garments, place the body within
a golden coffin, pour sesame oil over it, place the golden coffin inside
a second but larger iron vault, cover it with a sandalwood vault, cover
that vault with a thick pile of a variety of incense, and then cremate
the whole thing. After retrieving the ashes, build a commemorative
tower or shrine at each major crossroads and hang a picture on the
rock pillar set before it, so as to enable the citizens of the country who
are passing on the roads to view the towers of the universal ruler of
the law, causing a sense of affection to rise in their hearts toward his
benevolent rule, and thus bring about a beneficial influence upon the
populace.
```

Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns

O Ānanda, if you wish to conduct the funeral rite for me, you should 
bathe my body with warm scented water, cover my entire body with 
new cotton cloth, wrap it in a cloth equally as long as five hundred sets 
of garments, place the body within a golden coffin, pour sesame oil 
over it, place the golden coffin inside a second but larger iron vault, 
cover it with a sandalwood vault, cover that vault with a thick pile of 
a variety of incense, then cremate the whole thing. After retrieving my 
ashes, build a commemorative tower or shrine at each major crossroads 
and hang my picture on the rock pillar set before it, so as to enable 
whoever passes on the road to view the Buddha’s tower, refreshing his 
[or her] sense of affection toward the religious deeds accomplished by 
the Tathāgata and encouraging them to strive for their own goal of hap- 
piness in life when born into this world, and obtain the opportunity 
upon their death to be reborn in heaven. Of course, this excludes those 
who have [already] realized the ultimate goal of the path. 
Thereupon, the Mallan clanspeople said to each other: 
We should go back to the city to collect the funeral items, the incense 
and flowers, cotton cloth, the coffin and vault, and the scented oil, as 
well as the roll of white cloth. 
They returned together and completed the preparation of the necessary 
things. Returning to the Makuṭabandhana shrine, they bathed the Buddha’s 
body with warm scented water, covered it entirely with a new cotton cloth, 
wrapped it in the roll of cloth equally as long as five hundred sets of garments, 
placed it in the golden coffin, poured scented oil over it, placed the coffin inside 
a second, larger iron vault, covered it with another sandalwood vault, and cov- 
ered the vault with a thick pile of various renowned incense. The minister of 
the Mallan country held up a huge torch to set fire to the funeral pyre of the 
Buddha but the flame did not reach the pyre. A few other Mallan dignitaries 
one after another tried to set fire to the pyre, but the flame would not reach the 
pyre. Then Anuruddha said to the Mallan clanspeople,“Try no more. Wise gen- 
tlemen, it is beyond your power. The fire extinguished itself due to the will of 
the gods.” The Mallans questioned him, “Why should the heavenly gods prevent 
it from being burned, sir?” Anuruddha replied:

```

```
Our senior bhikṣu Mahākāśyapa, accompanied by five hundred disciples,
is enroute midway from the city of Pāvā to this place. If it has not yet
been cremated, he wishes to see the Buddha’s body once again. As the
gods know his thoughts, they have prevented this funeral pyre from
burning.
The Mallans said, “Let his wish be realized.”
At that time, Mahākāśyapa was hurrying on the way from Pāvā, accom-
panied by five hundred of his disciples. Mahākāśyapa and his disciples met
a Jain ascetic who was holding a mandāra flower in his hand, standing on
the road. Noticing the Jain ascetic from a distance, Mahākāśyapa approached
him and questioned him, “Where have you come from?”
[The Jain ascetic] replied, “I have come from the city of Kuśinagara, sir.”
Kāśyapa again asked him, “Do you know my master?”
He replied, “Yes, I know him.”
[Kāśyapa] again asked, “Is he still alive?”
[The ascetic] answered, “Seven days have now passed since his final nir-
vana. I have come from there, having obtained this heavenly flower, sir.”
Having heard this, Kāśyapa was disheartened with disappointment. The
five hundred disciples, having heard of the Buddha’s cessation, wept in
sorrow, wailing, their bodies twisted, hardly able to control themselves.
Wiping away their tears, they lamented:
How is it that the Buddha should go to cessation so soon? Why must
the Buddha go to cessation so quickly? How swiftly the great religion
(the Dharma) is lost and obscured! When the Eye of the World ceases
to be sentient beings shall surely wither for a long time to come, just
as when huge trees fall due to the total loss of their roots’ hold, breaking
their branches in a mess, or just as a snake, its head chopped off, con-
tinues to twist and wriggle without knowing where it is going.
At that time, a Śākya monk, Upananda by name, stopped the bhikṣu s,
saying:
Don’t worry. Because of the World-honored One’s cessation I have
obtained my freedom. He used to say to us, “Do this at all times,” “This
you should not do.” From now on I can do as I wish.
```

Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns

Having heard these words, Kāśyapa was disheartened, and with disap- 
pointment said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

All of you, pack your robes and almsbowls. We are going to the place 
of the twin _śāla_ trees. Since the cremation has not yet been done we 
may yet be able to see the Buddha. 
Then the _bhikṣu_ s, having heard Mahākāśyapa’s words, rose from their 
seats and followed him, proceeding to the city of Kuśinagara, crossing the 
Hiraṇyavatī River, and [finally] arriving at the Makuṭabandhana shrine. 
Having arrived at the place where Ānanda was, and after greeting him with 
a bow, Mahākāśyapa said to him, “We wish to see the body once again. Since 
the cremation has not yet been done, is it possible to do so?” Ānanda replied:

Though the cremation has not yet been done, it would be very difficult 
to see the body, sir. The reason is that the Buddha’s body was washed 
with warm scented water, totally covered with new cotton cloth, wrapped 
in a roll of cloth equally as long as five hundred sets of garments, placed 
in a golden coffin, then placed inside a second, larger iron vault, and 
then encased in a sandalwood vault. Because of this it would be very 
difficult to see the Buddha’s body once again, sir. 
Though Kāśyapa requested three times, Ānanda replied exactly as he had 
first replied, “For this reason, it would be difficult to see the Buddha’s body 
again, sir.” Mahākāśyapa then faced the funeral pyre directly and both of the 
Buddha’s feet extended out from within the vault, bearing a strange color. 
Having examined this, Kāśyapa was curious and asked Ānanda, “Why do the 
Buddha’s feet appear so different, having a golden color?” Ānanda replied:

Previously, an elderly woman, in her grief, stretched out both her hands 
to rub his feet. The change in the color of the Buddha’s feet was effected 
by her tears falling upon them, sir. 
Having heard this, Kāśyapa again felt disheartened with disappointment, 
but he faced directly the funeral pyre and venerated the Buddha’s body. At 
that moment, all four kinds of the Buddha’s disciples (i.e., _bhikṣu_ s, _bhikṣuṇī_ s, 
_upāsaka_ s, and _upāsikā_ s) as well as heavenly beings all accordingly offered 
veneration at the same time. At that moment both of the Buddha’s feet suddenly

disappeared. Thereupon, Mahākāśyapa circumambulated the funeral pyre 
three times and uttered the following verses:

```
The supreme insight of all the buddhas,
Which has no equal in this world
Except among the buddhas themselves,
To that sacred insight
That is without equal in this world,
I pay tribute with a bow.
The śramaṇa who has no equal in this world
Except among the buddhas themselves,
Highest, spotless, the Great Sage of all relations,
Most honored by heavenly gods,
Toward that foremost human hero,
I pay tribute with a bow.
Having no equal in the practice of austerity,
Teaching others without attachment,
Untainted and undefiled,
Toward that highest Honorable One,
I pay tribute with a bow.
Having totally exhausted three fundamental defilements,
He who was engaged
In the practice of ultimate quiescence;
Having neither a second, nor any of similar standing,
Toward he who is worthy of the ten supreme titles,
I pay tribute with a bow.
The Sugata (Well-gone) was the highest,
The most honorable
Among all venerable ones in the human world;
He who discovered the Four Noble Truths and
The way that leads to ultimate cessation,
To that insight of safety and peace,
I pay tribute with a bow.
```

```
Sutra 2: Last Journey and Sojourns
```

The highest among the ascetic mendicants ( _śramaṇa_ s), 
Turning wrong to right, 
He who introduced the way to total quiescence, 
Toward he whose trace is like the deep water, 
I pay tribute with a bow. 
Without the heat (of passion), 
With the spotless teaching, 
And the mind that is quiescent, 
He who has removed all defilements, 
Toward that Honorable One, without defilement, 
I pay tribute with a bow. 
Immeasurable with his eye of insight, 
Wonderful and unthinkable is the title 
Of [sublime] authority like that of nectar, 
Toward that matchless (i.e., unequaled) one, 
I pay tribute with a bow. 
With his voice like a lion’s roar, 
With no fear in the forest, 
He who overcame the Evil One [Māra] 
And transcended the four social classes, 
For that reason, 
I pay tribute with a bow. 
Thus Mahākāśyapa, who was endowed with great authority and virtue, 
well equipped with the four logical-linguistic excellences ( _catuṣ-pratisaṃvi- 
daḥ_ ), finished the foregoing verses. At that moment, the funeral pyre started 
to burn of its own accord. The Mallan clanspeople said to each other:

Now the fire appears to have intensified and is spreading over the pyre, 
and it may not be controlled. After cremation it will extinguish itself, 
but where can we now obtain water to prevent the fire from spreading 
over the whole pyre? 
Then the _śāla_ tree spirit by the side of the funeral pyre, who was devoted 
to the path of the Buddha, extinguished the fire with his supernormal power.

```

```
The Mallan clanspeople said to each other:
To the right and left beyond the city of Kuśinagara, for a range of
twelve yojana s, let us go collect fragrant flowers to offer to the Buddha’s
body.
At once they left the city and collected fragrant flowers to be used for the
funeral rite. Then each of the Mallan clanspeople of Pāvā, having heard that
the Buddha had entered final nirvana under the twin śāla trees, without excep-
tion thought, “I must now go there and seek a part of his ashes ( śarīra s). We
shall erect a commemorative tower in our original place and conduct offering
services to the Buddha.” The Mallan clanspeople of Pāvā assembled the four
divisions of their army, the elephants, horses, chariots, and foot soldiers, and
well prepared they marched toward the city of Kuśinagara. On their arrival
they sent a messenger who delivered the following words:
We have been informed that the Buddha stayed in reliance upon your
service and entered final nirvana in your country. He was also our
teacher. We have come here to receive some of his ashes out of respect
and affection for the World-honored One. We intend to erect commem-
orative towers in order to make offerings to him.
The king of Kuśinagara replied:
That is right, sir. Your claim is indeed correct, sir. However, the World-
honored One happened to be here and entered final nirvana in our land.
Our officials and countrymen should themselves perform the memorial
service for the Buddha. Though it has caused you such trouble to come
from such a long distance, we cannot pass the ashes into your hands, sir.
At that time, the Buli people of the country of Allakappa, the Kauliyan
people of Rāmagrāma, the brāhmaṇa s of Vaṭhadvīpa (Veṭhādīpa), the Śākya
people of Kapilavastu, the Licchavi people of Vaiśālī, and King Ajātaśatru
of Magadha had been informed that the Tathāgata had entered final nirvana
at the twin śāla trees near the city of Kuśinagara. All equally thought to them-
selves, “We must now go there and receive some ashes.” So the rulers of
those countries, [especially] King Ajātaśatru of Magadha, at once ordered

their countrymen to assemble the four divisions of their armies, the elephants, 
horses, chariots, and foot soldiers, and well prepared they marched and 
crossed the Ganges River, sending the _brāhmaṇa_ Droṇa as [the king’s] proxy 
by instructing him:

Go to the city of Kuśinagara under my name and ask the Mallan clans- 
people: “May I enquire as to whether you gentlemen are at ease in your 
rising and siting, and feel strong in your walking, sirs. Wise gentlemen, 
I am delighted to exchange mutual respect with you. We have been on 
good terms as to territorial demarcation and have never put the matter 
into the form of a public suit. I understand that the Tathāgata has entered 
final nirvana within your country. I simply wish to pay my respects 
and reverence to the highest Honorable One as if he were a heavenly 
god. Hence I have traveled a great distance to obtain a share of the 
Buddha’s ashes, and upon taking the ashes to my own land I will erect 
a commemorative tower for them in order to conduct offerings. If you 
grant me some of the ashes, I will arrange for some of my country’s 
treasure to be shared with your country, sir.” 
Having thus received the king’s instruction, the _brāhmaṇa_ Droṇa at once 
went to the city and said to the Mallan clanspeople:

```
The king of Magadha makes courteously enquires as to whether you
[respected gentlemen] are at ease in your rising and sitting, and feel
strong in your walking. [He says:] “Wise gentlemen, I am delighted
to exchange mutual respect with you. We have been on good terms as
to territorial demarcation and have never put the matter into the form
of a public entered final nirvana within your country. I simply wish to
pay my respects and reverence to the highest Honorable One as if he
were a heavenly god. Hence I have traveled a great a distance to share
some of the Buddha’s ashes, and on taking the ashes to my own land
I will erect a commemorative tower for them in order to conduct offer-
ings. If you grant me some of the ashes, I will arrange for some of my
country’s treasure to be shared with your country, sir.”
At that time, the Mallan clanspeople replied:

```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

That is right, sir. Your claim is indeed correct, sir. However, the World- 
honored One happened to enter final nirvana in our land. Our officials 
and countrymen should themselves perform the memorial service for 
the Buddha. Alhough it has caused you such trouble to come from such 
a long distance, we cannot pass the ashes into your hands, sir. 
The rulers of various countries assembled their respective officials to dis- 
cuss the matter and composed the following verse:

With courtesy we have come from a far distance 
For the sake of a peaceful consultation and to 
Request a share of the ashes 
With words of moderation. 
If this is not granted, 
We have readied the four divisions of our armies here. 
If [the relics] cannot be obtained on a justifiable basis, 
Without fearing injury or death, 
We will obtain them by force. 
Then the people of Kuśinagara [also] assembled their officials, and together 
with the public they discussed the matter and replied in verse:

```
Although you have taken the trouble
To come from a long distance and
Proposed a deal with humility,
We dare not allow ourselves to yield
The ashes of the Tathāgata.
If you decide to resort to military force,
We have our own force here and
Will fight against you even if we lose our lives.
We have no doubt about this.
At that time, the brāhmaṇa advised the people:
Dear wise men, you have received the Tathāgata’s teaching through
the long night. Do you not wish to recite the words of his Dharma,
convert yourselves to his compassion, and be mindful of the peace of
all sentient beings? If you raise armed conflict for the sake of the

```

Buddha’s ashes, everyone shall injure and kill each other. If you wish 
to have the Tathāgata’s ashes, benefit everyone widely; since the ashes 
are available here, it is surely better to divide them among those who 
wish to have a portion. 
Everyone agreed that this would be best. Next, they discussed who would 
be fairminded enough to carry out the task. Everyone agreed, “Let the _brāh- 
maṇa_ Droṇa divide the ashes through his humane wisdom.” Thereupon, those 
rulers of the various countries entrusted the task to the _brāhmaṇa_ Droṇa, 
saying, “Please divide the ashes on our behalf into eight equal portions.” 
Droṇa, having listened to the rulers’ agreement, went to the place where the 
ashes were stored and, having honored the ashes by bowing his head, pro- 
ceeded to gently take an upper tooth and placed it aside. He sent for a mes- 
senger and instructed him:

Carry this upper tooth of the Buddha to King Ajātaśatru. You should 
present my words to his majesty: “O great king, may I humbly enquire 
as to whether your majesty is at ease in his rising and sitting, and feels 
strong in his walking. Since the ashes have not yet been brought forth, 
your majesty may feel immeasurably impatient. Now I have entrusted 
an upper tooth of the Tathāgata in the hands of this messenger to carry 
it to your majesty, so that an offering service may be conducted before 
it and so that your majesty may be comforted by it, prior to the expected 
plan (i.e., of erecting a commemorative tower). At sunrise tomorrow 
I shall complete [the task of] dividing the ashes and will personally 
transport your portion of the ashes to your majesty.” 
Having received Droṇa’s instruction, the messenger at once went to King 
Ajātaśatru and said:

```
With immeasurable honor, the brāhmaṇa Droṇa enquires as to whether
your majesty is at ease in his rising and sitting, and feels strong in his
walking. Since the ashes have not yet been distributed, your majesty
may feel immeasurably impatient. Now he has entrusted an upper tooth
of the Tathāgata into my hands to bring to your majesty, so that an offering
service may be conducted before it and so that your majesty may be
comforted by it, prior to the expected plan (of erecting a commemorative

tower). At sunrise tomorrow he will complete the division of the ashes, 
and will personally transport your portion of the ashes to your majesty. 
At that time Droṇa received all the ashes, measuring one _shi,_ collected in 
a urn, and at once divided the ashes into eight equal portions. Having done 
so, he said to those who attended the session, “May I request you to use this 
urn and yourselves witness who takes what through mutual consultation.” 
Everyone praised Droṇa, “What splendid wisdom this is! He really knows 
what is most proper at this given moment,” and each mutually agreed to 
accept a portion. Then the people of Pippalavana made a request of all the 
people, saying:

We would like to receive the amber that remains on the ground, for 
the sake of erecting a commemorative tower in our country in order 
to conduct an offering service. 
Everyone agreed, “Let them have it.” Then the people of Kuśinagara 
received a portion and erected their commemorative tower for conducting 
their offering service. The people of Pāvā, those of Allakappa, those of Rāma- 
grāma, those of Veṭhadvīpa, those of Kapilavastu, those of Vaiśālī, and the 
king of Magadha, Ajātaśatru, having received their respective portions, 
returned to their countries and erected commemorative towers for conducting 
offering services. The _brāhmaṇa_ Droṇa received the urn that contained the 
ashes, returned to his country, and erected a commemorative tower there. 
The people of Pippalavana took the amber to their country and erected a 
commemorative tower in their country. At that time, eight commemorative 
towers were built, and a ninth was erected for enshrining the vase, a tenth 
for enshrining the amber, and an eleventh for enshrining the World-honored 
One’s hair. 
When was the Buddha born? When did the Buddha realize enlightenment? 
And when did he enter final nirvana? He was born when the boiling star 
( _feixing_ ) appeared; he was enlightened when the boiling star appeared; he 
entered the city of nirvana when the boiling star appeared.^21

When was the foremost among humans born?
When did he renounce the world of suffering?
When did he realize the highest path?

Various lights mutually illuminated. 
At that original place, 
The Tathāgata entered final nirvana. 
When the Great Merciful [One] entered final nirvana, 
Many people praised and venerated him. 
Having removed all the people’s fearfulness, 
He was determined to take the course of nirvana.

### Sutra 3

### A Great Treasury Councilor

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 19: Mahāgovinda Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was sojourning on the [moun- 
taintop called] Vulture Peak in the city of Rājagṛha, together with one thousand 
two hundred and fifty disciples. At that time, the god Pañcaśika, son of Gan- 
dharva, brightly illuminated Vulture Peak with a great ray of light and visited 
the Buddha when the place was all quiet and no one was around. Having 
venerated the Buddha [by bowing] his forehead to [the Buddha’s] feet, he 
withdrew and stood to one side, then said to the Buddha:

The god Brahmā, lord of Brahmā Heaven, recently visited Trāyastriṃśa 
Heaven to consult with the god Indra, lord of that heaven. I happened 
to hear directly from the god Brahmā. Shall I now tell your holiness 
about this matter? 
The Buddha replied, “If you wish to tell me about it, then do so.” Pañca - 
śika thus related the following story:

```
At one time, the gods of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven assembled at the Su -
dharma-sabhā hall to discuss a certain matter. At that time, the four
guardians of the heavens stationed themselves in their respective posi-
tions. Dhṛtarāṣṭra sat to the east while facing west; Indra was in front
of him. Virūḍhaka sat to the south while facing north; Indra was in
front of him. Virūpākṣa sat to the west while facing east; Indra was in
front of him. Vaiśravaṇa sat to the north while facing south; Indra was
in front of him. Waiting until all these four guardians took their seats,
I then sat down.
There were also other great luminaries who had previously accom-
plished the practice of pure and genuine austerity under the Buddha’s
guidance. Upon death they were reborn in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven and
[now] help the residents of that heaven increase the five kinds of ben-
efits: (1) heavenly longevity, (2) good appearance, (3) prominence,
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
(4) happiness, and (5) authority and virtue. [Accordingly,] the residents
of that heaven all rejoice, dancing and leaping, and praise them, “They
promote our well-being, thereby causing the advantage of the asura s,
the adversarial demigods, to diminish.”
At that time, knowing the joy of the residents in his heaven, the god
Indra composed the following verse on their behalf:
The residents of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven and
Their lord Indra rejoice together
In the harmonious life of pleasure and happiness,
And respectfully venerate the Tathāgata and
The truth of his Dharma.
[For] the heavenly citizens have been benefited
With visible fortunes, such as
Longevity, good complexion, fame,
Happiness, and authority.
The contributors of these benefits
Were previously trained under the Buddha’s guidance
In the practice of austerity, pure and genuine,
And because of that merit
They have been born in this heaven.
Some of these citizens,
Whose auras and complexions
Are exceedingly noble and august,
Were [previously] the disciples of the Buddha.
Having acquired insight and
Having been born into this heaven,
They too became prominent.
The residents of Trāyastriṃśa and
The lord of this heaven, Indra,
Thinking of the state of happiness promoted by them,
Venerate respectfully the Tathāgata and
The truth of his Dharma.
Upon hearing this verse uttered by their lord, the gods of Trāyastriṃśa
Heaven could not help rejoicing all the more about such good fortune
```

```

beyond their control, which thus promoted their well-being while caus- 
ing the advantage of the _asura_ s, the adversarial demigods, to diminish. 
Having observed their joy and delight, the lord Indra said to them, 
“Dear wise citizens, don’t you wish to learn the eight supreme qualities 
that pertain to the Tathāgata?” The Trāyastriṃśa gods replied, “Yes, 
we would be most delighted to hear about them, sir.” The god Indra 
said, “Listen attentively, you should contemplate and remember the 
following.”

```
O wise citizens, the Tathāgata is endowed with ten titles, such as
One who Realized Ultimate Truth, One who Realized Perfect
Enlightenment, and so forth. Throughout the past, present, and future
I have never seen anyone like the Buddha, to whom these ten titles,
Arhat and so forth, pertain so perfectly. Not only in teaching the
subtle Dharma so well but also in putting his knowledge of this
subtle Dharma into his own practice, throughout the past, present,
and future I have never seen anyone like the Buddha who combines
these two aspects of excellence in unison. Because of this subtle
Dharma, the Buddha was himself enlightened with it, became an
expert in it, and enjoyed it. Throughout the past, present, and future
I have never seen anyone like the Buddha who, because of this
Dharma, was himself enlightened, became an expert in it, and
enjoyed it.
O wise citizens, because of this Dharma, the Buddha was not
only enlightened, but the passage that leads to the goal of nirvana
was also opened and shown; he associated himself with this path,
gradually proceeded upon it, and finally entered the state of total
quiescence, just like the waters of the Ganges and Yamunā Rivers
combine and flow together into the same ocean. The Buddha is also
like this. Not only in opening and showing the passage toward the
goal of nirvana but also in associating himself with it and gradually
proceeding on it, and finally entering the state of total quiescence.
Throughout the past, present, and future I have never seen anyone
like the Buddha who opened and showed the passage that leads to
the goal of nirvana.
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
O wise citizens, the Tathāgata organized the members of his
[religious] family. Whether they were kṣatriya s, brāhmaṇa s, house-
holders, or śramaṇa s, whoever has acquired insight is a member of
his sangha. Throughout the past, present, and future I have never
seen anyone like the Buddha who has accomplished such a family.
O wise citizens, the Tathāgata organized his host of followers,
namely bhikṣu s, bhikṣuṇī s, and [male and female lay] householders
( upāsaka s and upāsikā s). Throughout the past, present, and future
I have never seen anyone like the Buddha who accomplished an
organization of such a host of members.
O wise citizens, the Tathāgata’s words and conduct match per-
fectly. Whatever he says becomes his action; however he acts is in
accordance with his words. In accomplishing the constant relation
between what is said and what is done like this, throughout the past,
present, and future I have never seen anyone like the Buddha, none
who is as consistent in his speech and conduct, accomplishing such
an invariable relation between what is said and what is done.
O wise citizens, the Tathāgata enormously benefited people in
their well-being and gave them [real] assurance. In benefiting heav-
enly citizens through his mercy and sympathy, throughout the past,
present, and future I have never seen anyone like the Buddha who
benefited us so well and gave us such assurance. O wise citizens,
these are the eight supreme qualities that pertain to the Tathāgata.
At that time, the gods of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven argued, asserting an
opinion:
If we could have eight buddhas arise into this world, they would
promote our well-being while causing the advantage of the asura s,
the adversarial demigods, to diminish.
Another group of Trāyastriṃśa residents spoke:
Setting aside the number of eight buddhas, seven, or six, and so on,
if even only two buddhas should arise into this world simultaneously,
this too would greatly enhance the fortunes of the heavenly citizens,
```

31a

```
Sutra 3: A Great Treasury Councilor
```

```
while contrarily causing the advantage of the asura s to diminish.
How much more so if all eight buddhas could arise at once!
Then the lord Indra said to the Trāyastriṃśa residents:
I have heard from the Buddha, directly from him, that even if people
wish for two buddhas to arise simultaneously, there is no such place
in this world where they could arise at the same time. If only one
could successfully cause the Tathāgata to extend his life span, then,
since his love and sympathy are great, there would be many more
ways in which Tathāgata could benefit people, but there also would
be greater appeasement of the heavenly citizens through the pro-
motion of their well-being, thereby diminishing the advantage of
the asura s, the adversarial demigods.
```

At that time, Pañcaśika said to the Buddha:

```
O World-honored One, the purpose for which the Trāyastriṃśa residents
assembled at the Sudharma-sabhā hall was to discuss together, to think
together, to evaluate together, to investigate together, and to instruct
together. After that, the assembly gave various instructions to the four
guardians of the heavens and, having received the instructions, the
guardians returned to their respective positions. But soon after they
had returned to their respective positions an unusual ray of light illu-
minated all the regions. The Trāyastriṃśa gods, having seen this light,
were all terrified, thinking, “What kind of ill omen does this unusual
ray of light indicate?” Some of the great deities endowed with super-
normal powers were also terrified, wondering, “What kind of ill omen
does this unusual ray of light indicate?”
The god Brahmā then assumed the form of a young boy and, with
his head shaped like a pentagon and his hair spread out over the host
of gods, he rose in midair. His appearance was exceedingly handsome,
surpassing that of the gods. His body was purplish gold, overwhelming
the luminosity of all the heavenly beings. The Trāyastriṃśa residents
did not then stand up to welcome him, nor did they greet him or com-
mend him to take his seat. The Brahmā youth, however, took his seat
```

```

```
in an available space. He was delighted, as if an anointed kṣatriya had
ascended to the throne, and rejoiced, dancing and leaping. Soon after
he sat down, he changed himself into the form of a young boy, with
his head in the shape of a pentagon and his hair spreading out over the
host of gods, sitting in midair, just as a wrestler sits in his permanent
seat, immovable like a mountain. He then composed the following
verse:
The residents of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven and
Their lord Indra rejoice together
In the harmonious life of pleasure and happiness,
And respectfully venerate the Tathāgata and
The truth of his Dharma.
[For] the heavenly citizens have been benefited
With visible fortunes, such as
Longevity, good complexion, fame,
Happiness, and authority.
The contributors of these benefits
Were previously trained under the Buddha’s guidance
In the practice of pure and genuine austerity,
And because of that merit
They have been born in this heaven.
Some of these citizens,
Whose auras and complexions
Are exceedingly noble and august,
Were [previously] the disciples of the Buddha.
Having acquired insight and
Having been born into this heaven,
They too became prominent.
The Trāyastriṃśa residents and
The lord of this heaven, Indra,
Thinking of this state of happiness promoted by them,
Venerate respectfully the Tathāgata and
The truth of his Dharma.
```

31b

```
Sutra 3: A Great Treasury Councilor
```

At that time, the citizens of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven said to the Brahmā 
youth, “We have just heard our lord Indra’s exhortation on the eight 
supreme qualities that pertain to the Tathāgata and have been rejoicing, 
dancing and leaping; we feel as if we are beyond self-control.” 
The Brahmā youth said to the Trāyastriṃśa gods, “What are the 
eight supreme qualities of the Tathāgata? I wish to also hear about 
them, sirs.” Thus, the lord Indra at once also gave him his exhortation 
on the Tathāgata’s eight supreme qualities. Having twice listened to 
Indra’s exhortation, the Trāyastriṃśa gods uncontrollably rejoiced all 
the more at the promotion of their well-being and the diminishment 
of the _asura_ s’ advantage. 
At that time, observing the rejoicing Trāyastriṃśa gods, the Brahmā 
youth also felt more and more joyous, as if he could not stop himself 
from dancing, and at once said to the Trāyastriṃśa gods, “Do you not 
wish to hear about another supreme quality of the Tathāgata?” The 
gods replied, “Excellent, we wish to hear about it!” The boy said to 
them, “Since you do wish to hear about it, listen attentively and I shall 
explain it to you.” He related the following story to the gods:

```
Once, when the Tathāgata was a bodhisattva, he was sagacious and
acquired all kinds of knowledge in his birthplace. O wise citizens,
you should know that in an immemorial past there was a king,
Diśāṃpati (“Lord of the Region”) by name, in that world, and his
eldest prince was called Reṇu (“Mercy”). The king had a treasurer,
Govinda, as his prime councilor, and the latter had a son called
Jyotipāla. Prince Reṇu had a group of six kṣatriya friends who were
also ministers. When King Diśāṃpati withdrew to the rear palace
for leisurely amusement and pastimes, it was customary that he
entrusted the business of governance to the treasury councilor. Only
then did he withdraw to his palace to enjoy [the pleasures of the]
five senses, such as listening to music, watching performances of
dancing, and so on.
Whenever the treasury councilor Govinda conducted government
business he first listened to his own son’s advice, and only then
made his decisions. Whenever he faced issues that required a decision,
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
he sought his son’s advice. After a while, the treasury councilor
suddenly passed away. When King Diśaṃpati was informed of the
treasury councilor’s death, he felt pity and sorrow, lamenting, “Alas,
what can I do now? I have lost the most important pillar of my
state.”
Prince Reṇu quietly thought to himself, “The king regrets the
death of the treasury councilor. I should go see him to advise him
that he should not succumb to his suffering in mourning his coun-
cilor’s death, because his son, Jotipāla by name, is sagacious and
learned, and has acquired varieties of knowledge exceeding even
that of his father. The king should appoint him to conduct the gov-
ernance of the state.”
Prince Reṇu at once visited his father, the king, and advised him,
explaining the foregoing in detail. Having heard this advice, the king
summoned Jyotipāla and said to him, “I shall appoint you to the same
position held by your respected father and entrust you with the seal
of the councilor.” As soon as Jyotipāla received it, the king further
instructed him to take over the duties of governance and retreated to
the rear palace. By then, the councilor Jyotipāla knew the business
of governing well; he knew not only what his father had been doing
before him but also whatever his father had left unaccomplished.
Jyotipāla’s name and reputation spread throughout the continent as
far as the limit of the ocean, and everywhere under the sky he was
called the “great treasury councilor” by everyone.
Sometime later, the great treasury councilor thought to himself,
“King Diśāṃpati, whose body and mind have been impaired by
age, has little time left before his death. It would not be difficult for
the prince to succeed his throne. I should inform the six kṣatriya
ministers, ‘King Diśāṃpati, whose body and mind have deteriorated
from age, has little time left before his death. It would not be difficult
for the prince to succeed his throne. Your territorial lands too must
be sealed for your respective kingdoms. Do not forget this matter
after the new king is enthroned.’”
The great treasury councilor then visited the six kṣatriya ministers
and said to them, “Your honors, you should know that now King
```

Sutra 3: A Great Treasury Councilor
```

Diśāṃpati, whose body and mind are impaired by age, has little 
time left before his death. It would not be difficult for the prince to 
succeed to the throne. Go speak to the prince about this matter, say- 
ing, ‘Honorable prince, we were born together with you and 
befriended you from childhood. If your excellence is suffering, we 
too are suffering. If your excellence is happy, we too feel happy. 
Now the king’s body and mind have become impaired, and his age 
is reaching its limit and he has little time left before passing away. 
It would not be difficult for your excellence to succeed to the throne. 
When you ascend the throne, may you also seal the respective ter- 
ritorial lands for our kingdoms.’” 
Thereupon, having listened to this advice, the six _kṣatriya_ min- 
isters at once visited the prince and advised him by explaining the 
foregoing matters. The prince replied, “When I ascend the throne, 
with whom, I wonder, should I consult in order to enumerate the 
lands and allocate the countries?” 
The king died suddenly soon after. The ministers of the state in 
due order supported Pince Reṇu’s ascent to the throne. Having been 
enthroned, the new king thought to himself, “I should now appoint 
someone as my prime minister, following the fashion of the previous 
ruler. Who is capable of this position? The great treasury councilor 
who assisted my father before—he alone should be appointed as 
my prime minister.” 
King Reṇu summoned [the treasury councilor] and said to him, 
“I now appoint you as prime minister and give you the official seal. 
May you, with exertion and care, assume general oversight of the 
governance of state affairs.” 
Having heard to the king’s words, the great treasury councilor 
accepted the seal. It was customary that whenever the king withdrew 
to the rear palace for his pastimes he entrusted the task of governance 
to the prime minister. The great treasury councilor again thought to 
himself, “I should visit the six _kṣatriya_ ministers now and ask them 
if they remember what was said in the past about their feudal lands 
and countries.”

```
32a

```
At once he visited and said to the ministers, “Your honors, do
you still remember what was said in the past? Prince Reṇu has now
been enthroned. He withdraws to the rear palace to enjoy his five
senses in pastimes. Your honors should visit the king to enquire,
‘Your majesty has ascended the throne and enjoys the five senses
in pastimes. Does your majesty still remember what was said about
our feudatory lands and countries, sir?’”
Having heard his advice, the six kṣatriya ministers at once visited
the king and said to him, “Your majesty has ascended the throne
and enjoys the five senses in pastimes, but do you recall what was
said in the past regarding our feudal lands and countries? The
arrangement of lands and districts should be sealed for each of us
respectively, sir.” The king replied, “I have not forgotten what I said
in the past. It was for you, and for whom else should I speak about
such arrangements of lands and districts to be sealed?”
The king again thought to himself, “This Jambudvīpa continent
extends wider toward the north but is narrower toward the south.
Who would be able to divide this continent into seven equal parts?”
Again he thought to himself, “The great treasury councilor alone is
capable of such a task.” Thus he at once asked the treasury councilor,
“Please divide the Jambudvīpa continent into seven parts.” Accord-
ingly, the great treasury councilor took up the task. First, he accom-
plished the administrative divisions of the territory that his king ruled
into cities, villages, towns, counties, and countries, and then, in a
similar manner, he accomplished the administrative divisions for the
six territories to be sealed for the six new kṣatriya rulers.
Delighted, King Reṇu said, “My wish has been granted.” The
six kṣatriya s were also pleased, and with satisfaction said, “Our
wishes have also been realized. It is due to the great treasury coun-
cilor’s talent that this deed has been accomplished.” The six kṣatriya
kings each thought again to themselves, “My country has just been
founded, and I need someone who can assist me as prime minister.
Who is really capable of this task? Our great treasury councilor
alone is capable of such a task.” Each of the six kṣatriya kings sum-
moned the councilor, saying, “My state needs a prime minister. May

you take on the general oversight of the governance of my state.” 
Thereupon, all six kings each granted their official seals to the great 
treasury councilor. As soon as the latter accepted the official seals, 
the six kings retreated to their rear palaces to enjoy pastimes of 
games and amusements. Thus, entrusted with the task of governance, 
the great treasury councilor assumed general oversight of the gov- 
ernance of all seven countries. There was nothing whatsoever that 
was left incomplete in his stewardship. 
At that time, there were seven wealthy householders within the 
country. The treasury councilor also managed their household affairs 
for them, as well as teaching seven hundred _brāhmaṇa_ s how to recite 
their sutras. The seven kings respectfully treated the great treasury 
councilor as if he were a god, the seven wealthy householders 
regarded him as if he were a great king, and the seven hundred _brāh- 
maṇa_ s looked up to him as if he were the god Brahmā. Then the 
seven kings, seven householders, and seven hundred _brāhmaṇa_ s 
respectively thought to themselves, “The great treasury councilor 
always meets with the god Brahmā, exchanges words with him, and 
sits down and stands up in intimate association with him.” 
The great treasury councilor, however, who quietly knew the 
thoughts of the kings, householders, and _brāhmaṇa_ s, thought to 
himself, “According to their beliefs, I meet often with the god 
Brahmā, exchange words with him, and sit down and stand up in 
intimate association with him. In actuality, however, I have never 
seen the god Brahmā, nor have I exchanged words with him, hence 
I ought not to accept this praise by remaining silent. I also remember 
the words of various learned elders that if one withdraws into a 
secluded place during the four summer months and practices the 
four kinds of immeasurable minds, the god Brahmā will descend 
from his heaven to meet with the practitioner. I should now practice 
the discipline of the four immeasurable minds and see if the god 
Brahmā really will come down to meet with me.” 
Having so decided, the great treasury councilor went to see each 
of the seven kings, requesting of each, “Your majesty, may you take 
over the general oversight of the governance [of your country], for

```
32b
```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

```
I wish to take a leave of absence for the duration of the four summer
months in order to practice the discipline of the four immeasurable
minds, sir.” The seven kings each answered, “You may go whenever
you are ready.” The great treasury councilor also said to the seven
wealthy householders, “You should look after your household affairs
by yourselves for the duration of the four summer months, because
I wish to practice the discipline of the four immeasurable minds
during that time.” The householders all answered, “Yes, sir. You
may go whenever you are ready, sir.”
He also said to the seven hundred brāhmaṇa s, “You should be
busily engaged in the practice of recitation and also teach each other
among yourselves. I am planning to leave for the four summer
months in order to practice the discipline of the four immeasurable
minds.” The brāhmaṇa s replied, “Yes, sir. Great teacher, you know
you may go whenever you are ready, sir.”
The great treasury councilor then built a secluded abode on the
eastern outskirts of the city and resided there while engaging in the
practice of the four immeasurable minds during the summer months.
Lord Brahmā, however, did not come to meet him. The treasury
councilor thought to himself, “According to my learning from the
words of some elders, if one practices the discipline of the four
immeasurable minds during the four summer months, Lord Brahmā
is supposed to descend, manifesting himself before the practitioner.
Now, however, in my state of quiescence, there is no trace at all of
such a vision.” Then, on the fifteenth of the month, on the night of
the full moon, the great treasury councilor came out of his solitary
abode and sat in the outdoor alley. Soon after he sat down outdoors
there appeared a bright illumination. The great treasury councilor
quietly thought to himself, “Is this strange light the sign of Brahmā
descending?” Brahmā then transfigured himself into the form of a
boy and appeared with his pentagonal-shaped head and wildly
disheveled hair, and hovered in midair in a sitting posture above
the treasury councilor. On seeing this, the treasury councilor com-
posed the following verse:
```

```
Sutra 3: A Great Treasury Councilor
```

```
What heavenly god is this form,
Sitting in midair,
Illuminating all four directions
Like a great fire burning intensely?
```

The Brahmā youth responded in verse:

```
Only those gods of Brahmā Heaven
Know that I am Brahmā in the form of a boy.
The rest call me a god of fire and
Enshrine me in the fire god shrine.
```

The great treasury councilor continued in verse:

```
Now I wish to communicate with you,
Receive your instruction,
Pay my reverence and respect to you, and
Set forth a meal of superior taste for you, sir.
May I request, O god:
“May you fathom my mind of enquiry.”
```

The Brahmā youth replied again in verse:

```
O treasury councilor,
While you are engaged in practicing some discipline,
What do you wish to seek for?
Since you have set forth this offering,
I shall accept it for your sake.
```

Again the god Brahmā said to the great treasury councilor, “If you 
have any questions, ask me as freely as you wish. I shall answer them 
for you.” Thereupon, the great treasury councilor thought to himself, 
“Now, should I ask about the matter of the present life or that of the 
future?” Again he thought to himself, “Sometime later I may ask 
about present life matters. I should instead ask about the future life 
after death.” He thus questioned the Brahmā youth in verse:

```
Now I shall ask the Brahmā youth,
“May you resolve my doubt
```

```
32c
```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

```
So as to free me of doubt.
By practicing (studying) what discipline and
Abiding in what kind of mental state ( dharma ),
Can I be born in Brahmā Heaven, sir?”
At that time, the Brahmā youth replied in verse:
You should forsake the thought of selfishness,
Abide in seclusion,
Practice the mind of benevolence,
Remove desires, and absent yourself from filthiness.
Then you may be able
To be born in Brahmā Heaven.
At that moment, when the great treasury councilor heard this reply,
he thought to himself, “The Brahmā youth replied in verse that one
should remove filthiness, but I do not understand what this means.
I must ask him again.” Then the great treasury councilor questioned
the god Brahmā in verse:
Your verse refers to filthiness.
May I now ask you to explain to me what this means?
Who opens the gate of this world
Through which one falls into evil courses of life and
Cannot be born in the world of heaven?
At that time, the Brahmā youth replied in verse:
Those who harbor deceit and jealousy,
Who are accustomed to self-conceit and undue self-esteem,
Who cherish avarice in the heart,
Desire, hate, anger, delusion, and arbitrariness,
These people are said to be filthy.
Now I let you know that these vices
Open the gate that leads to the fall
Into the evil courses of life,
And not to rebirth in heaven.
```

```
Sutra 3: A Great Treasury Councilor
```

At that time, having heard this verse, the treasury councilor thought 
to himself, “I have now understood the meaning of ‘filthiness,’ but 
it is not possible to remove it while living a householder’s life. 
Shouldn’t I now renounce ordinary life, go forth from family ties, 
shave my hair and beard, wear a mendicant’s robe, and practice the 
path of religion?” At that moment, the Brahmā youth knew the coun- 
cilor’s thoughts and related the following in verse:

```
You have good courage.
Your wish is superb.
It is what a man of wisdom does, and after death,
He will surely be born in Brahmā Heaven.
```

Thereupon, the Brahmā youth suddenly disappeared. The foremost 
treasury councilor returned to visit the seven kings and said to them, 
“Your majesties, may you make yourselves models in assuming 
oversight of governing state affairs. I am planning to leave family 
life, wear a mendicant’s robe, and practice the path of religion. The 
reason is this, sirs. Recently I happened to listen to the god Brahmā’s 
exhortation on the defiled state of life, and in my mind I despise it. 
As long as I am in the householder’s life there is no possibility of 
removing it totally from my life, sirs.” 
At that time, the seven kings thought to themselves, “The _brāh- 
maṇa_ s in general desire riches and treasures. I should open up the 
state’s storehouses and let him have whatever he wishes, so that he 
will change his mind.” The seven kings said to the treasury councilor, 
“If you need anything, I will give you whatever you wish. You 
should not leave the householder’s life.” 
The treasury councilor replied to the kings, “I have now already 
received your generous offer. I have my own riches and treasures, 
sirs, but I shall present all of them to your majesties as my gift. May 
I request your majesties to accept my petition so that I may realize 
the goal of my pursuit, sirs.” 
Then the seven kings thought to themselves, “The _brāhmaṇa_ s 
in general desire fancy food. I should provide him with some palace

```
ladies to satisfy his mind and taste, so that he may change his mind.”
Then each king told him, “If you need some palace ladies, you may
have any of them as you wish. You should not leave the house-
holder’s life.”
The treasury councilor replied, “I have now already received
your generous offer, sirs. Though I have a number of palace ladies
in my household now, I have sent them all away in order to sever
the relation of love and affection, and am ready to go forth in the
practice of the religious path. The reason is this, sirs. Recently I
happened to listen to the god Brahmā’s exhortation on the defilement
of life, and in my mind I despise it. As long as I am in the house-
holder’s life there is no possibility of removing it totally from my
life, sirs.” Then the great treasury councilor said to King Reṇu in
verse:
May your majesty allow me my say:
The king is the most honorable among men.
Though you would provide me riches and ladies,
These treasures are not ones with which I can be satisfied.
King Reṇu replied in verse as well:
Kaliṅga and its capital city, Dantapura,
Aśvaka and its capital, Potana,
Avanti and its capital, Māhīṣmatī,
Aṅga and its capital city, Caṃpā,
The cities of Xiuo, Shumisaluo, and Roruka,
Vārāṇasī and its capital, Kāśī,
All these have been developed by you, the treasury councilor.
If you lack anything in your possessions
For the fulfillment of the senses,
I shall provide you with anything you need.
May you remain in the position and,
Together with me, handle the state’s affairs.
You need not go away,
Renouncing your family relations.
```

```
Sutra 3: A Great Treasury Councilor
```

At that time, the great treasury councilor responded in verse:

```
I have little desire to fulfill my five senses, and
Hence naturally I am not attached to my life
In the manner of other people.
I have already heard the words of the heavenly god.
Hence my mind will never remain in the householder’s life.
```

King Reṇu replied in verse:

```
From which god have you acquired, as you say,
The wish to forsake the objects
Of the five senses?
Now I ask you to reply to me at once.
```

The treasury councilor replied in verse:

```
Some time ago I sat alone and
Thought to myself in a secluded place.
Then the god Brahmā descended
With the splendid ray of light illuminating everywhere.
Ever since I learned things from him,
I have not been able to enjoy this world.
```

Then King Reṇu told him in verse:

```
Remain a short while, O great treasury councilor.
Let us together propagate the good influence of religion and
Then let us renounce family life together.
You are my teacher.
Just as lapis lazuli gems, pure and genuine,
Fill up the midair,
Now my faith, pure and genuine,
Is permeated with the teaching of the Buddha.
```

Then the great treasury councilor said in verse:

```
The heavenly gods and the people of this world
Should forsake the objects of the five senses,
```

```
33b
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
Remove various defilements, and
Carry out the practice of pure and genuine austerity.
At that time, the seven kings said to the great treasury councilor,
“You should remain seven years, enjoying entirely the five senses
in this world, and then abandon the country, leaving things to our
children and relations. Wouldn’t it be a good idea for you to renounce
family life together with us? We shall then follow you; whatever
you do, we shall do likewise.”
The great treasury councilor replied to the seven kings, “The
world is impermanent. Human life passes swiftly and cannot be
sustained [unchanged] even for a moment’s breath. Therefore, isn’t
the duration of seven years an awfully long time?”
The seven kings said again, “If you think that seven years is too
long a time, let us wait for six years, five years, nay even only one
year, staying in a quiet palace, exhaustively enjoying the five senses,
spending time together in pastimes; then, after that, let us renounce
our countries, leaving them to our children and relations. Wouldn’t
it be a good idea for you to renounce family life together with us?
Whatever you do, we shall do likewise.”
The great treasury councilor again spoke to the kings, saying,
“The world is impermanent. Human life passes swiftly and cannot
be sustained [unchanged] even for a moment’s breath. Therefore,
isn’t the duration of one year an awfully long time? In this matter,
seven months and so forth, even a month, is all the same and I cannot
wait for that period, sir.”
The kings said again, “For seven days we shall stay in the rear
palace and enjoy in every way the five senses in this world. After that
we shall renounce our states, leaving them to our sons and relations,
and together we shall renounce family life. Is this not a good idea?”
The great treasury councilor replied, “The duration of seven days
is not too long. By my own decision I shall remain, sirs. May I,
however, emphasize to your majesties that the words of your pledge
must be honored without fail, sirs. If after seven days your majesties
do not leave, I shall myself go forth alone, sirs.”
```

33c

```
Sutra 3: A Great Treasury Councilor
```

Thereupon, the great treasury councilor visited the seven wealthy 
householders and said to them, “Dear householders, you should 
handle your household affairs by yourselves. I shall be leaving 
family life and will practice the path to realize the goal of uncon- 
ditioned transcendence. The reason is that recently I happened to 
listen to the god Brahmā’s exhortation on the defilement of life, and 
in my mind I despise it. As long as I am in the householder’s life 
there is no possibility of totally removing it from my life.” 
The seven householders replied to the treasury councilor, “Your 
decision is splendid. You should know when it is the right time. We 
wish to renounce our family ties at the same time, together with 
you, sir. In whatever you do, we shall follow and do the same.” 
Then the great treasury councilor also visited the seven hundred 
_brāhmaṇa_ s and said to them, “Gentlemen, you should exert your- 
selves in the practice of reciting sutras, search for the meaning of 
morality, and teach among yourselves. I shall be leaving family life 
to practice the path and realize the goal of unconditioned transcen- 
dence. The reason is that recently I happened to listen to the god 
Brahmā’s exhortation on the defilement of life, and in my mind I 
despise it. As long as I am in the householder’s life, there is no pos- 
sibility of totally removing it from my life.” 
The seven hundred _brāhmaṇa_ s said to the treasury councilor, 
“Great teacher, you should not renounce family life. The house- 
holder’s life is much easier, and one is entitled to enjoy the five 
senses. In the householder’s life many people attend and take care 
of you, and you do not have to suffer or worry about anything. [In 
contrast,] those who renounce family life have to live in the wilder- 
ness, neither desiring anything, nor grasping anything because of 
desire.” 
The treasury councilor replied, “If I consider the householder’s 
life as a happy one, I would regard its renunciation as suffering, 
and thus eventually discard such an idea myself. But it is solely 
because I consider the householder’s life to be suffering and its 
renunciation to be happiness that I shall take the course of forsaking 
the householder’s life.”

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
The brāhmaṇa s replied: “O great teacher, if you renounce family
life, we too shall renounce family life, sir. Whatever your reverence
does, we shall do likewise, sir.”’
Then the treasury councilor returned to his wives and said to
them, “Ladies, according to your preference, whoever wishes to
stay may stay, and whoever wishes to return [to their original home]
may do so. This is because I wish to renounce family life and practice
the path of religion in order to realize the unconditioned state of
transcendence.”
He discussed the matter and explained his intended renunciation
in detail. His wives then replied, “O great treasury councilor, you
have been in part my husband, and in part my father. Though you
are renouncing family life, we shall follow your path, sir. Whatever
the treasury councilor practices, we shall likewise practice, sir.”
In this way, after seven days had passed, the great treasury coun-
cilor shaved his hair and beard and departed, wearing the three
formal robes of a mendicant, leaving household life. The seven
kings, seven great householders, seven hundred brāhmaṇa s, and
forty wives respectively increased the number of their companions
one after another, finally adding up to as many as eighty-four thou-
sand people. All of them simultaneously renounced family life and
followed the treasury councilor.
Subsequently, the great treasury councilor wandered through
many different countries and benefited people everywhere widely
by propagating the influence of the religious path.
At that time, the god Brahmā said to the residents of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven:
This treasury councilor was none other than Śākyamuni Buddha himself,
you should never think otherwise. The World-honored One then
renounced his family life after seven days of waiting and, leading a
host of people, wandered through various countries, benefiting people
everywhere widely by propagating the influence of the religious path.
All of you, if you have any doubt regarding my words, since the World-
honored One is sojourning at Vulture Peak you should visit him and
ask him about it directly. Whatever the Buddha says should be accepted.
```

34a

```
Sutra 3: A Great Treasury Councilor
```

The visitor Pañcaśika said:

```
Because of this story I have come here, sir. Is it true that this great
treasury councilor is indeed the same as the World-honored One, sir?
World-honored One, after seven days of waiting, did your holiness
really renounce family life together with the seven kings, and so forth,
and also with a host of eighty-four thousand people who simultaneously
renounced family life? Did you really accomplish the propagation of
your religious path by wandering through various countries and ben-
efiting people everywhere, sir?
```

The Buddha replied to Pañcaśika:

```
Indeed, the treasury councilor of that time was none other than myself,
Śākyamuni Buddha, you should never think otherwise. At that time
the people of that country all came out in procession, and excitedly,
despite some unavoidable damage, everyone raised their voices, chant-
ing, “Homage to the great treasurer Mahāgovinda, the seven kings’
councilor! Homage to the great treasurer, the seven kings’ councilor!”
The chanting was repeated in this way three times.
O Pañcaśikha, although the great treasury councilor bore such great
virtue and power he could not teach the ultimate path of salvation for
the sake of his disciples, he could not help them practice the ultimate
discipline of austerity, and he could not lead them to the ultimate place
of safety and freedom. The doctrine he taught and which his disciples
followed in practice was that which said that when one’s body dissolved
at the end of life he would be born in Brahmā Heaven. If one’s practice
could not reach full realization but only the secondary level, then that
person would be born among the gods who control enjoyments that
are magically created by others, highest in the world of the senses; if
one’s practice reached the third level, that person would be born among
the gods who control enjoyments magically created by themselves,
and so on. In descending gradation, then, one would be born among
the gods of Tuṣita Heaven, Yāmadeva Heaven, Trāyastriṃśa Heaven,
in the realm of the four guardians, then among the kṣatriya s, the brāh-
maṇa s, the lay [Buddhist] householders ( upāsaka s and upāsikā s), and
```

```
finally in any wealthy family able to acquire anything freely according
to their wish.
O Pañcaśikha, those who were the disciples of the great treasury
councilor, who renounced family life without confusion, were able to
acquire their rewards and teachings but because it was not the ultimate
path they could not be helped to practice the ultimate discipline of aus-
terity, and hence they could not reach the ultimate place of safety and
freedom, nirvana. For whoever excelled well in this path was only des-
tined to be born in Brahmā Heaven.
Now I have been exhorting the Dharma to my disciples in order to
help them realize the ultimate path, the ultimate practice of austerity,
and the ultimate place of safety and freedom, namely, the final goal of
nirvana. Any disciple who accepts and practices my teaching of the
Dharma will be able to forsake the defiled state of conditioned existence
and accomplish the undefiled state of unconditioned transcendence,
realize the emancipation of mind and emancipation through analytical
insight, and will himself directly experience in the present life the
exhaustion of the cause of birth and death. [Furthermore, he will]
accomplish the practice of austerity, accomplish that which should be
done [for religious salvation], and become free from rebirth. Even for
the disciple who cannot reach this final goal, insofar as his practice
reaches a secondary level he will still be able to terminate the five
defilements that bind sentient beings to the lower sphere of desire, and
he will enter final nirvana directly from the heavenly state in which he
is reborn without returning to this human world again (i.e., the state
of anāgāmin ).
Those disciples who reach the third level will extinguish the initial
three of those five defilements (i.e., the heretical belief in a real per-
sonality, doubt, and attachment to non-Buddhist practices and obser-
vances), and reduce the affectation of desire ( rāga ), hate ( dveṣa ), and
delusion ( moha ), returning only once to this world (i.e., the state of
sakṛdāgāmin ) before realizing final nirvana.
Those disciples who reach the fourth level will likewise terminate
three of the five defilements, preventing themselves from falling into
the evil courses of life, will realize the saintly state of stream-enterer
```

```
Sutra 3: A Great Treasury Councilor
```

and, returning to this world seven times, shall surely realize final nirvana 
on the last return. 
O Pañcaśikha, those among my disciples who have renounced family 
ties in genuine faith will receive reward and instruction, investigate 
the methods of the path, thoroughly carry out the practice of austerity, 
seek the ultimate place of security and peace, and thus finally return 
to nirvana. 
At that time, having listened to the Buddha’s exhortation, Pañcaśikha was 
delighted and respectfully followed what had been instructed.

### Sutra 4

### Janavasabha’s Exhortation

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 18: Janavasabha Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was sojourning at the resthouse 
called Giñjakāvasatha in the village of Nādika, accompanied by a host of 
one thousand two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s. At that time, Venerable Ānanda 
was in meditation in a secluded room and quietly thought to himself:

```
It is remarkable and extraordinary that the Tathāgata assures people of
their destinies, thereby enormously benefiting them. When the minister
Kakkaṭa (or Kakkudha) died, the Tathāgata assured his destiny, pre-
dicting that upon his death he would terminate the five defilements that
bind sentient beings in the lower world of desire, take the course of
entering nirvana from the heaven into which he was born, and hence
not return to this world again.
In a similar manner, when Kaliṅga, Nikaṭa, Lishu, Sāḷha, Poyalou,
Potoulou, Subhadra, Tuolishetu, Soudalishetu, Yaśas, and Yeshuduolou
(some of whom were ministers) died, the Buddha also assured that
they had terminated the five defilements that bind sentient beings in
the lower world of desire, taking the course of entering nirvana from
the heaven into which they were born, and would not return to this
world again.
When a group of fifty people died, the Buddha also assured that
they terminated the initial three of those five defilements: heretical
belief in a real personality, doubt, and attachment to non-Buddhist
practices and observances, whereby they were freed from desire, hatred,
and delusion, and thus acquired the saintly state of stream-enterer, the
first of the four states of spiritual development. They were obliged to
return to this world once in order to terminate the root causes of suf-
fering. Also when [another] five hundred people died, the Buddha again
assured that they had terminated the initial three defilements and had
acquired the first saintly state of stream-enterer, and would not fall into

an evil course of life but return to the world seven times and would
surely terminate the root cause of suffering.
When the disciples died, the Buddha invariably assured their des-
tinies without fail, predicting that so-and-so would be born in such-
and-such place, so-and-so would be born in such-and-such place. The
Buddha assured without exception the destinies of those who died in
the sixteen major countries, such as Aṅga, Magadha, Kāśī, Kośala,
Vṛji, Malla, Ceḍi, Vatsa, Kuru, Pañcāla, Aśvaka, Avanti, Matsya,
Sūrasena, Gandhāra, and Kāmboja. However, he did not make any
assurance for the people of Magadha who were kṣatriya s and those
Maga dhans who were trusted by the kings, even after their deaths.
Thereupon, Ānanda left the secluded room and came to the place of the
World-honored One. Having venerated the Buddha by bowing his forehead
to [the Buddha’s] feet, he withdrew to sit at one side and said to the Buddha:
A while ago, I was contemplating that it is remarkable and extraordinary
that the Tathāgata assures the destinies of people, thereby benefiting
them enormously. Your holiness assured without exception the destinies
of those who died in the sixteen major countries. The people of Maga-
dha, however, even those who are kṣatriya s and are trusted by other
kings, alone have not been assured of their destinies, even upon their
deaths, sir. May I request, O World-honored One, that the destinies of
these people be assured, sir. May I repeatedly request that an assurance
be granted for their destinies, sir. Your holiness’ assurance will benefit
people and gods for their ultimate quiescence.
Again the Magadhan faithful who realized the path and died in
their country have not yet been assured of their destinies. May I
request, O World-honored One, that their destinies be assured. O
World-honored One, may I repeat this request that your holiness
assure their destinies, sir. The king of Magadha, Bimbisāra, for
instance, became a faithful devotee of the Buddha and provided many
offerings before his death. Through this king, many were drawn to
the religion and dedicated themselves to the Three Treasures. Despite
this, sir, the Tathāgata has not given any assurance about his destiny.
```

34c

```
Sutra 4: Janavasabha’s Exhortation
```

I earnestly wish, O World-honored One, that an assurance be given 
to [Bimbisāra] as well as others, so that all sentient beings may be 
assured and heavenly beings may be at ease. 
At that time, having made a request to the World-honored One on behalf 
of the people of Magadha, Ānanda rose from his seat and, after venerating 
the Buddha, left the room. 
Thereupon, the World-honored One, donning his _saṃghāṭī_ robe and with 
his almsbowl in hand, went into the city of Nādika. After the almsround, 
having come to the great forest, he sat under a tree and meditated on the 
Magadhan devotees with respect to their deaths and births. 
At that moment there was a spirit not too far away from the Buddha. He 
introduced himself to the World-honored One, “I am Janavasabha, I am 
Janavasabha” (“Victor over Delusion”). The Buddha said:

Why do you call yourself by the name Janavasabha? On the basis of 
what religion do you use such a subtle expression that means “you 
have witnessed the trace of the path”? 
Janavasabha replied: 
I am not from another place. I was formerly a king. I became a lay 
devotee of the Tathāgata’s religion and ended my life with the earnest 
recollection of the Buddha in my mind. Because of that, I was reborn 
as the prince of the guardian god Vaiśravaṇa. Ever since, I have been 
able to illuminate the various religious practices and realized the state 
of stream-enterer, never falling into the evil courses of life. Thus 
throughout seven rebirths in the human world I have always been called 
Janavasabha, sir. 
The Buddha stayed in the great forest as time allowed and then returned 
to the brick resthouse in Nādika. After he took his seat in the prepared position, 
he asked a _bhikṣu_ , “Please convey my words to Ānanda: ‘Come see me.’” 
The _bhikṣu_ answered “Yes, sir” and went to call Ānanda. Having arrived at 
the place of the World-honored One, Ānanda venerated him by bowing his 
forehead to the Buddha’s feet and, withdrawing to sit at one side, he said to 
the Buddha:

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
I notice that the Tathāgata’s complexion is especially superior today and
your sense faculties are most quiescent, sir. Through what kind of thought
has your holiness managed to attain such a good demeanor, sir?
The World-honored One said to Ānanda:
A while ago you came to see me concerning the people of Magadha
and requested me to assure their destinies. After you left, I donned my
robe and went into the city of Nādika for an almsround and then pro-
ceeded to the great forest. I sat under a tree to contemplate the destinies
of those Magadhan people with regard to their deaths and births. At
that moment, there was a yakṣa, a spirit, not too far from my place,
and he introduced himself to me by repeating his name, saying, “I am
Jana vasa bha. I am Janavasabha.” O Ānanda, have you ever heard the
name Janavasabha?
Ānanda replied:
I have never heard that name, sir. Having heard the name now, I feel
a sense of thrill and my hair stands on end. O World-honored One, this
yakṣa must have great authority and virtue. Because of that he may be
called Janavasabha, sir.
The Buddha continued:
I then asked him, “Why do you call yourself by the name Janavasabha?
On the basis of what religion do you use such a subtle expression that
means you have yourself witnessed the trace of religious salvation?”
Janavasabha replied, “I am not from anywhere else, nor [was my
name given] on the basis of any other religion. I was formerly a king,
sir. I became a disciple of the World-honored One, and with earnest
faith, became a lay householder and ended my life with earnest recol-
lection of the Buddha in my mind. Because of that, I was reborn as the
prince of the guardian god Vaiśravaṇa, realized the state of stream-
enterer, never falling into the evil course of life, and thus returned here
seven times in order to exhaust the root cause of suffering. Throughout
seven rebirths in the human world, I have always been called Janava -
sabha, sir.”
```

```
Sutra 4: Janavasabha’s Exhortation
```

[Janavasabha continued his story:]

```
At one time, the Buddha was seated under a tree in the great forest. I
happened to be riding on the heavenly thousand-spoked wheel to visit
the guardian god Virūḍhaka for some reason, and on the way I saw the
World-honored One seated under a tree in the great forest. His appearance
was handsome and his calm, restrained senses were like a deep pool of
still water, transparent, bright, and clear. Having seen the Buddha, I
thought to myself, “I should instead visit the World-honored One and
ask him where the Magadhan people will be reborn after their deaths.”
Again, on another occasion, the guardian god Vaiśravaṇa uttered a
verse among the gods:
We do not try to recollect the past or repeated things.
Now, as I have met the world-honored One,
[I feel that] my longevity has been increased.
Again on another occasion, the residents of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven were
assembled at one place for some reason. The four guardian gods were
seated in their respective positions: Dhṛtarāṣṭra sat to the east while
facing west; Indra was in front of him. Virūḍhaka sat to the south while
facing north; Indra was in front of him. Virūpākṣa sat to the west while
facing east; Indra was in front of him. Vaiśravaṇa sat to the north while
facing south; Indra was in front of him. Waiting for the moment when
all these four guardians took their seats, I then sat down.
There were also other great luminaries who had previously accom-
plished the practice of pure and genuine austerity under the Buddha’s
guidance. They were reborn in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven upon their deaths
and [now] help the residents of that heaven increase their five kinds
of benefits: heavenly longevity, good complexion, prominence, hap-
piness, and authority and virtue. [Accordingly,] the residents of that
heaven all rejoice with dancing and leaping, and praise them, “They
promote our well-being, thereby causing the advantage of the asura s,
our adversarial demigods, to diminish.” At that time, knowing the res-
idents’ joy in his heaven, the god Indra composed the following verse
on behalf of those residents:
```

```
35b
```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

```
The residents of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven and
Their lord Indra rejoice together
In the harmonious life of pleasure and happiness and
Respectfully venerate the Tathāgata and
The truth of his Dharma.
[For] the heavenly citizens have been benefited
With visible good fortune, such as
Longevity, good complexion, fame,
Happiness, and authority.
The contributors of these benefits
Were previously trained under the Buddha’s guidance
In the practice of austerity, pure and genuine,
And because of that merit
They have been born in this heaven.
Some of these citizens,
Whose auras and complexions
Are exceedingly noble and august,
Were [previously] the disciples of the Buddha.
Having acquired insight and
Having been born into this heaven,
They too became prominent.
The Trāyastriṃśa residents and
The lord of this heaven, Indra,
Thinking of this state of happiness promoted by them,
Venerate respectfully the Tathāgata and
The truth of his Dharma.
The god Janavasabha continued:
The purpose for which the Trāyastriṃśa residents assembled at the Su -
dharma-sabhā hall was to conduct discussion together, to think together,
to evaluate together, to investigate together, and to instruct together.
After that, the assembly gave various instructions to the four guardians
of the heaven and, having thus received the instructions, the guardians
returned to their respective positions. Soon after they had settled in their
respective positions, an unusual ray of light illuminated all the regions.
```

```
Sutra 4: Janavasabha’s Exhortation
```

Then the Trāyastriṃśa gods, having seen this light, were all terrified, 
thinking, “What kind of ill omen does this unusual ray of light indicate?” 
Some of the great deities endowed with supernormal powers were also 
terrified, wondering, “What kind of ill omen does this unusual ray of 
light indicate?” 
Then the god Brahmā assumed the form of a young boy, and with 
his pentagonal head and his hair spread out over the host of gods, he 
rose in midair. His appearance was exceedingly handsome, surpassing 
that of the gods. His body was purplish gold, overwhelming the lumi- 
nosity of all the heavenly beings. The Trāyastriṃśa residents did not 
then stand up to welcome him, nor did they greet him or bid him to 
take his seat. The Brahmā youth, however, took his seat in an available 
space. He was delighted, as if an anointed _kṣatriya_ had ascended to 
the throne, and rejoiced with dancing and leaping. Soon after he sat 
down he changed himself into the form of a young boy, with his head 
in the shape of a pentagon and his hair spreading out over the host of 
gods, sitting in midair, just as a wrestler sits in his permanent seat, 
immovable like a mountain. He then uttered the following verse:

```
O foremost honorable one in the discipline of restraint,
May the source of wisdom arise in this world.
One who is endowed with the great insight
Exhorts the truth of the Dharma.
His practice of austerity has no equal companion.
May the sentient beings, pure and genuine
Be born in the heavens of purity.
```

Thereupon, having uttered this verse, the Brahmā youth said to the 
gods of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven:

```
There are five kinds of pure and clear [qualities of] sound, which
are called the sounds of the god Brahmā. What are these five types
of sound? The first is honest; the second, gentle; the third, thoroughly
clear; the fourth, deep and wide; and the fifth, heard in all directions
and in the far distance. If a sound possesses these five qualities it
is regarded as Brahmā’s sound.
```

```
35c
```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

```
Let me further explain. Listen attentively. The disciples of the
Tathāgata, the Magadhan householders, realized either the saintly
state of nonreturner, the state of once-returner, or the state of stream-
enterer when they died, and were reborn in either the heaven of con-
trolling enjoyments magically created by others, the heaven of con-
trolling enjoyments magically created by themselves, Tuṣita Heaven,
Yāmadeva Heaven, Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, the realm of the four
guardians, among the kṣatriya s, the brāhmaṇa s, the lay [Buddhist]
householders, or wealthy families. In all of these cases, they freely
enjoyed the five senses.
Then the Brahmā youth composed a verse:
I have been told that
As many as eighty-four thousand Magadhan lay householders,
Equally accomplished their paths when they died,
Realizing the saintly state of stream-enterer,
Thus not falling again into an evil course of life,
Equally riding on the right road,
Reaching the path and salvation.
These sentient beings,
Aided by their insight derived from their merits,
Were able to forsake their love and affection,
To liberate themselves from fraudulence
Through the repentance of inner
As well as outer senses of shame, and
Are reported by the Brahmā youth
To those Trāyastriṃśa gods
As having realized the state of stream-enterer,
All rejoicing.
Having heard this verse, Vaiśravaṇa was delighted and said:
It is extraordinary and it has never before happened that the World-
honored One appeared in this world and taught such a true doctrine.
Originally I did not know that the Tathāgata appeared in this world,
```

```
Sutra 4: Janavasabha’s Exhortation
```

```
taught such a true doctrine, and made the residents of Trāyastriṃśa
Heaven greatly rejoice.
```

Then the Brahmā youth said to the god Vaiśravaṇa:

```
Why do you make such a statement? Why do you think it is extraor-
dinary and that it has never before happened that the Tathāgata
appeared in this world and taught the true doctrine like this? The
Tathāgata taught through his power of expediency what is good and
what is bad; while thus giving detailed exhortation on this, he did
not make them as ultimately real by exhorting on the pure nature
of elements of existence as empty, whereby he accomplished some
attainment of real insight. This truth is delicate and subtle like the
first taste of the cream of clarified butter.
```

Then the Brahmā youth again said to the residents of Trāyastriṃśa 
Heaven:

```
Listen attentively. Contemplate and remember what I am going to
explain to you. The Tathāgata who is “liberated from attachment”
teaches the set of four applications of mental awareness on four
conditions of existence through an efficient analytical method. What
are these four? First, observation of one’s inner body or inner senses;
one should exert himself without slackening, being mindful of his
observations and keeping them in memory, thereby removing worldly
desires and worries.
Further, in observing his outer body or outer senses, one should
exert himself without slackening, being mindful of his observations
and keeping them in memory, thereby removing worldly desires
and worries. It is the same with the three remaining applications:
in observing one’s sense perception, mental intellect, and psy-
chophysical elements, one should exert himself with no slackening,
being mindful of his observations and keeping them in memory,
thereby removing worldly desires and worries. When observation
into the outer body is completed there should arise insight into the
bodies of others; when observation of the inner sense perception is
```

```
36a
```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

```
completed, there should arise insight into the inner sense perception
of others; when observation into the inner mind is completed there
should arise insight into the minds of others; when observation into
the inner psychophysical elements is completed there should arise
insight into the psychophysical elements of others. The foregoing
are called the four applications of mental awareness on the four
conditions of existence in the Tathāgata’s efficient analytical method.
Again, O residents of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, listen attentively,
and I shall explain next the Tathāgata’s seven requirements of con-
centration ( sapta-samādhi-pariṣkāra ) in efficient analytical method.
What are the seven? They are: right view, right conception, right
speech, right action, right livelihood, right endeavor, and right
mindfulness.
Next, O residents of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, I shall explain the
Tathāgata’s four supernormal powers of concentration in efficient
analytical method. What are the four? They are: first, the supernormal
power derived from dispositional forces bearing the exertion of con-
centration motivated by desire; second, the supernormal power
derived from dispositional forces bearing the exertion of concen-
tration motivated by mind; third, the supernormal power derived
from dispositional forces bearing the exertion of concentration moti-
vated by endeavor; fourth, the supernormal power derived from
dispositional forces bearing the exertion of concentration motivated
by investigation. These are the four supernormal powers of con-
centration in the Tathāgata’s efficient analytical method.
Again, may I tell you, O residents of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, that
the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s of the past who relied on innumerable
expedients to produce immeasurable supernormal powers did so
fundamentally by deriving them from the four foregoing types of
supernormal powers (as variations). Therefore, those future śra-
maṇa s and brāhmaṇa s also should rely on innumerable expedients
to produce immeasurable supernormal powers, doing so funda-
mentally by inducing them from the four foregoing types of super-
normal powers.
```

```
Sutra 4: Janavasabha’s Exhortation
```

At that moment the Brahmā youth transfigured himself into thirty-three 
bodies which respectively sat together with the thirty-three gods, saying 
to each of them, “Have you recognized my supernormal power of trans- 
figuration?” They replied, “Yes, we have seen it.” The Brahmā youth 
said, “Since I practice the four types of supernormal powers I am able 
to transfigure myself into innumerable forms.” 
At that moment, each of the thirty-three gods thought to themselves, 
“Now a single Brahmā youth sits alone in my seat and speaks these 
words to me. Thus, the transfigured form of this Brahmā youth speaks 
this way, and other transfigured Brahmā youths are also speaking. 
When the original Brahmā youth becomes silent, all the transfigured 
forms shall fall silent as well.” 
The Brahmā youth then removed the spell of supernormal power, 
seated himself in the position of Indra, and said to the residents of 
Trāyastriṃśa Heaven:

```
I shall now explain to you. Listen attentively. The Tathāgata, who
is the Arhat, himself opened the three passages with his own power,
and himself realized the perfect enlightenment through such a pas-
sage. What are these three?
First, suppose a human being has strong desire and learns of bad
things. If he later associates with good friends and listens to words
on the Dharma, and then acquires the truth of that Dharma, having
done so he shall free himself of desires and abandon bad conduct,
obtain a feeling of delight, and joy and simply become happy. Also,
the way in which great joy arises from within happiness is like the
manner in which, having thrown away poor food after partaking of
a tasty meal, a person still seeks an even better meal. The practitioner
should be like this. Having forsaken morally bad elements one
obtains a state of joy and happiness, and yet within the state of hap-
piness one finds further causes for the arising of great joy. This is
the stage in which the Tathāgata opened the initial passage of real-
ization through his power, himself realizing perfect enlightenment
through this passage.
```

```
36b
```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

Second, again suppose some individual entertains a sense of hatred 
and anger and does not forsake his bad physical, verbal, and volitional 
habits. Later on, however, he meets some good friends and listens 
to good words on the Dharma and then acquires the truth of the 
Dharma. Having done so, he frees himself from bad physical, verbal, 
and volitional actions, causes joy to arise in his mind, and simply 
becomes happy. He then finds within the state of happiness further 
cause for the arising of great joy. This is like the manner in which, 
having thrown away poor food after partaking of a tasty meal, a per- 
son still seeks an even better meal. The practitioner should be like 
this. Having forsaken morally bad elements one obtains a state of 
joy and happiness, and yet within that state of happiness one finds 
further cause for the arising of great joy. This is the second passage 
of realization that the Tathāgata opened. 
Third, again, some people are stupid and ignorant, do not know 
what is good and what is bad, and cannot know the Four Noble 
Truths, [the nature of] suffering, the causes, cessation, and the path 
as they truly are. Later on, however, a person meets some good 
friends and listens to good words on the Dharma and then acquires 
the truth of the Dharma. Having done so, he frees himself from bad 
physical, verbal, and volitional actions, causing joy to arise in his 
mind, and he simply becomes happy. He then finds within the state 
of happiness further cause for the arising of great joy. This is like 
the manner in which, having thrown away poor food after partaking 
of a tasty meal, a person still seeks an even better meal. The prac- 
titioner should be like this. Having forsaken morally bad elements 
one obtains a state of joy and happiness, and yet within that state 
of happiness one finds further cause for the arising of great joy. This 
is the third passage of realization that the Tathāgata opened. 
At that time, the Brahmā youth exhorted the foregoing doctrines to the 
Trāyastriṃśa gods, and the guardian god Vaiśravaṇa became a follower of 
his teaching and propagated the right Dharma along with him. The _yakṣa_ 
Janavasabha also exhorted this Dharma before the Buddha, and the World- 
honored One exhorted this Dharma to Ānanda. Ānanda then also exhorted

```
Sutra 4: Janavasabha’s Exhortation
```

this Dharma to the _bhikṣu_ s, _bhikṣuṇī_ s, and male and female lay householders 
( _upāsaka_ s and _upāsikā_ s). Having listened to this doctrine taught by the 
Buddha, Ānanda experienced joy, respectfully received the teaching, and 
carried out what was taught by the Buddha.

[End of Sutra 4: Janavasabha’s Exhortation]

### Sutra 5

### Lesser Causality

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 27: Aggañña Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was sojourning in the country 
of Śrāvastī at Mṛgamātā’s lecture hall at the Nunnery of the Eastern Grove, 
accompanied by one thousand two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s. At that time, 
two _brāhmaṇa_ s, with firm faith in their hearts, visited the place of the Buddha, 
renounced family life, and joined the Buddha’s religious path. One was called 
Vāseṭṭha (Pāli) and the other was Bhāradvāja. 
At that time, the World-honored One came out of the meditation room 
and began his meditative walk back and forth on the hall’s terrace. Then, 
having seen the Buddha practicing walking meditation, Vaseṭṭha quickly 
went to Bhāradvāja and said to him:

Don’t you know that the Tathāgata has now come out of the meditation 
room and has begun his meditative walk? We should go see the World- 
honored One, and we should listen to what the Tathāgata teaches us. 
Then, as advised by his friend, Bhāradvāja followed Vāseṭṭha to visit the 
World-honored One and, having venerated the Buddha by bowing their fore- 
heads to his feet, both began to follow the Buddha in the practice of walking 
meditation. 
At that time, the World-honored One said to Vāseṭṭha, “O you two, born 
in the _brāhmaṇa_ class, with firm faith in the Dharma that I teach, have you 
decided to forsake family life and practice the way?” Vāseṭṭha replied, “Yes, 
we have so decided, sir.” 
The Buddha said to them, “O you two, when you are practicing the path 
of religion under my instruction, isn’t it likely that other _brāhmaṇa_ s will 
accuse you and make complaints and warnings?” They answered, “Yes, sir, 
our renunciation of family life and conversion to the path of practice under 
the Buddha’s guidance will invite such accusations of us, sir.” 
The Buddha asked, “Why do they accuse you?” At once they replied to 
the Buddha:

```
36c
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
They accuse us, saying, “Our brāhmaṇa class is superior while the rest
are inferior; our class is clean and white, while the rest are black and
dark; our class is derived from Brahmā, born of his mouth; and as our
class realizes pure and genuine emancipation in this present life, the
life to come will [therefore] also be pure and genuine. Why do you
abandon our pure and genuine class and join the different religion pro-
fessed by Gautama?” O World-honored One, when they see our renun-
ciation of family life and conversion to the practice of the Buddha’s
path, they will surely criticize us with these accusations, sir.
The Buddha said to Vāseṭṭha:
You may find many people who are as stupid and ignorant as animals
and birds. Thus some claim, “Our brāhmaṇa class is superior while
the rest are inferior; our class is clean and white while the rest are black
and dark; our class is derived from Brahmā, born of his mouth; and as
our class realizes pure and genuine emancipation in this present life,
the life to come will [therefore] also be pure and genuine.”
O Vāseṭṭha, in the path of the highest truth that I now teach, no such
criterion invoking class difference is needed. The path I cultivate does
not rely on a mind of self-conceit. The secular world relies on such a
criterion, but not my religious salvation. If any śramaṇa or brāhmaṇa
relies on the class-status criterion, he cannot realize highest, perfect
enlightenment. Only when one casts away the class-status criterion
and removes the mind of self-conceit can one realize genuine enlight-
enment and accept the right Dharma that I teach. People do not like
those of inferior backgrounds. The Dharma that I teach does not so
discriminate.
The Buddha said to Vāseṭṭha:
Even when the four class divisions are differentiated, I am obliged to
say that both good and bad are equally found in all of their members,
and the wise praise equally the good while accusing the bad in any
of these classes of people. What are the four [classes]? They are first,
the kṣatriya s, with royal or warrior status; second, the brāhmaṇa s, of
priestly or scholarly status; third, the vaiśya householders, who are
```

37a

```
Sutra 5: Lesser Causality
```

farmers and merchants; and fourth, the _śūdra_ s, who are destitute or of 
servile status. 
O Vāseṭṭha, listen carefully. Within the _kṣatriya_ class there are mur- 
derers, thieves, those who commit sexual abuse, speakers of falsehood, 
double-dealers, speakers of harsh words, frivolous sycophants, those 
who have covetous minds, those with malicious intent, and those with 
wrong views. There are also these kinds of wrongdoers among the _brāh- 
maṇa_ class, among the _vaiśya_ s, and among the _śūdra_ people as well. 
O Vāseṭṭha, for any wrong action there will be a unfortunate retri- 
bution. When one commits an evil action, he will reap an evil retribu- 
tion. If such causal effect occurs only among those of the _kṣatriya, 
vaiśya,_ and _śūdra_ classes but not among the _brāhmaṇa_ s, then the _brāh- 
maṇa_ s could claim that their class is superior while the rest are inferior; 
that their class is clean and white while the rest are black and dark; 
that their class is derived from Brahmā, born of his mouth; and that 
because their class realizes pure and genuine emancipation in the present 
life, the life to come will also be pure and genuine. If, however, accord- 
ing to the same principle, for a wrong action there is an evil retribution; 
that is, if one were to commit an evil action, black and dark in nature, 
that person will receive an evil retribution equivalent in nature with 
its action. This also invariably applies equally to those of the _brāhmaṇa, 
kṣatriya,vaiśya,_ and _śūdra_ classses, and therefore the _brāhmaṇa_ s 
cannot claim that their class alone is pure and genuine and superior. 
O Vāseṭṭha, if, on the other hand, within the _kṣatriya_ class there are 
those who abstain from committing murder, theft, sexual abuse, speak- 
ing falsehoods, double-talk, using harsh words, frivolous sycophancy, 
and who do not have a covetous mind, malicious intent, and wrong 
views, then in a similar manner there are also those who abstain from 
these wrong deeds among those of the _brāhmaṇa_ , _vaiśya,_ and _śūdra_ 
classes. If anyone who belongs to any of these classes should learn the 
foregoing ten kinds of good deeds and actually put them into practice, 
good rewards will necessarily follow. If one commits a good and gen- 
uine act, he will receive a good reward. If this principle of causal reward 
applies only to the _brāhmaṇa_ people and not to _kṣatriya_ s, _vaiśya_ s, or 
_śūdra_ s, then the _brāhmaṇa_ s can claim that their _brāhmaṇa_ class alone

```

```

```
is pure and genuine and superior. If, however, the same principle equally
and invariably applies to all four classes, then the brāhmaṇa s cannot
claim that their class is pure and genuine and superior.
The Buddha said to Vāseṭṭha:
Now, we see no difference from others in the manner of childbirth in
marriage among the brāhmaṇa people, yet some of them falsely claim
that their brāhmaṇa class is born from the mouth of the creator Brahmā,
is pure and genuine in this life, and will also be pure and genuine in
the life to come. My disciples all vary as to their class status and back-
grounds, yet even though they come from different classes and back-
grounds, they have renounced family life and joined my religion, and
have received higher ordination in order to practice the path. If someone
asks them, “What class are you from?”, they should reply to this ques-
tion by saying, “I am a son [or daughter] of the Śākya śramaṇa .”
One should also say, of his own initiative:
We śramaṇa s are all born from the parental mouth. Born out of our
religious conversion, we realize the pure and genuine life [now]
and the life to come will also be pure and genuine. The reason is
that the name “the great god Brahmā” is a title for the Tathāgata,
and the Tathāgata is the Eye of Wisdom of this world, the insight
of this world, the Dharma of this world, the Brahmā of this world,
the Dharma wheel of this world, the nectar of this world, and the
foremost religious master of this world.
O Vāseṭṭha, if one among the kṣatriya people devoutly believes in the
Buddha, he necessarily believes that the Tathāgata is endowed with
the ten supreme titles, such as the one liberated from attachment, the
fully enlightened one, and so forth. He who devoutly believes in the
Dharma believes that the Dharma of the Tathāgata, subtle and delicate,
pure and genuine, should be practiced and exhorted at all times, that
it is shown to be the essential nature of nirvana, and that it can be
known only by people of insight. It is not the kind of teaching that an
ordinary person can fathom. He who devoutly believes in the sangha
believes that the members of the sangha are good and honest, have
```

```
Sutra 5: Lesser Causality
```

```
realized the fruits of the path, and have acquired their own disciples
and followers, and, being true disciples of the Buddha, they have accom-
plished the truth of the Dharma. “Sangha” means realization of the
membership that embodies the discipline, concentration, analytical
insight, emancipation, and subsequent insight of emancipation. The
sangha consists of those who are spiritually ready for the state of stream-
enterer, and those who have realized it; those who are ready for the
state of once-returner, and those who have realized it; those who are
ready for the state of nonreturner, and those who have realized it; those
who are ready for the state of arhat, and those who have realized it.
Whoever devotedly believes in the sangha should have faith in these,
known as the four pairs of people or the eight distinguished persons,
the wise and holy disciples of the Tathāgata, worthy of honor and
respect as the best field of merit for charity in the world. Therefore
when one has devout faith in the efficacy of precepts and discipline
and holds steadfastly to them, without slackening, without dropping
out in hiatus, without defilement, that person will be one who is praised
by the wise as perfectly endowed with goodness and quiescence.
O Vāseṭṭha, all people, whether they are members of the brāhmaṇa,
vaiśya, or śūdra class, should firmly believe in the Buddha, Dharma,
and Sangha and thereby realize the holy precepts and discipline that
are upheld by holy disciples.
O Vāseṭṭha, among those of the kṣatriya class, there are many who
dedicate themselves to the Arhat (i.e., the Buddha) with offerings of
food and service, reverence and veneration. In a similar manner, among
members of the brāhmaṇa , vaiśya, and śūdra classes too, there should
also be those who dedicate themselves to the Arhat with offerings of
food and service, reverence and veneration.
```

The Buddha said further to Vāseṭṭha:

```
Now, on the one hand, those kṣatriya s who are related to me as members
of the Śākya clan support King Prasenajit of Kośala as their common
ancestral monarch with propriety and respect, while, on the other hand,
King Prasenajit visits me with offerings of food and service, as well
as reverence and veneration. It is not because the king thinks to himself,
```

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
“The śramaṇa Gautama comes from a powerful clan, whereas I come
from a family inferior to his.” Nor is it because he thinks, “The śramaṇa
Gautama was born in a family endowed with great wealth and great
influential power, whereas I was born in a lowly, impoverished, and
uncultured family.” Nor is it because he makes offerings and service
to the Tathāgata that visits me with offerings and service. King Prasenajit
views things in reference to the Dharma and clearly recognizes the dis-
tinction between what is true and what is false. Because of his conviction
he began to develop pure and genuine faith, and now offers his respects
to the Tathāgata.
O Vāseṭṭha, I shall now inform you of the ultimate origin of the
four class-status differences. At the beginning of this new eon and at
the end of the former one, when the preceding eon was totally destroyed,
all sentient beings died and were reborn in Light-sound Heaven, where
light becomes word. They were physically transformed so as to be able
to live on ideas or thoughts as food, emitting light automatically, and
flying in midair with supernormal speed. Later on, the surface of the
earth changed into water all around. There was no sun, moon, or stars,
neither day or night, year or month; total darkness prevailed. Later on,
when the water had changed into solid ground, the heavenly beings in
Light-sound Heaven naturally lost their merit after their deaths and
they came to be born in this new land. Although they were reborn in
a different world they still continued to live on thoughts, fly with super-
normal speed, their bodies automatically emitting light, and they con-
tinued to exist in that new world for some time. They called themselves
“sentient beings.”
Later on, however, a fountain of sweet water sprang up, just as
cream arises from butter or honey springs up from underground. Some
of the firstborn, whose natures were imprudent, having seen the foun-
tain quietly thought to themselves, “I shall taste this water to find out
what it is.” Immediately they stuck their fingers into the fountain and
tasted the water, and in this way, having repeated this a few times,
they were addicted to the sweetness of the taste and openhandedly
indulged themselves, partaking of it with insatiable desire. This kind
of attachment, addicted to pleasure, can hardly be ended through a
```

37c

```
Sutra 5: Lesser Causality
```

sense of weariness due to overabundance. Other sentient beings also 
imitated these beings in tasting the water, and after a few tastes they 
too were invariably soon addicted to it as well. Even before they felt 
fully satisfied, because of this diet their bodies became coarse and their 
flesh became stiff, losing its heavenly subtle color. They no longer had 
the supernormal speed of flight and were only able to crawl on the sur- 
face of the ground. Their bodily light was totally diminished, and 
heaven and earth were nearly all dark. 
O Vāseṭṭha, you should know of the regularity of heaven and earth, 
such that after the great darkness there will appear the sun, moon, and 
stars in mid-space; later there will appear day and night and brightness 
and darkness, respectively; and finally, days, months, and years. At 
that time the sentient beings ate only from the earth and thus existed 
a while on the surface of the ground. Whoever ate more of the food 
developed a sickly complexion with rough and ugly skin, whereas 
whoever ate less of it continued to bear a pleasant complexion. Varieties 
of appearance, such as pleasant, ugly, noble, and handsome, all began 
from that circumstance. 
Some of those whose appearance was more handsome than ordinary 
became conceited and slighted those whose appearance was ugly. In 
return, those whose appearance was ugly felt jealous and covetous, 
and hated those whose had a better appearance. The sentient beings 
began to dispute among themselves. At that time, the sweetwater foun- 
tain dried up of its own accord, but the area naturally produced out- 
growths upon the ground, which were of pleasant color and taste, good 
scent and cleanliness, and could be eaten. At that time, the sentient 
beings continued to live again by partaking of these outgrowths from 
the ground. Whoever ate [of these outgrowths] excessively lost their 
good complexion, their skin becoming rough and ugly, while whoever 
ate less retained their pleasant complexion. The beings who managed 
to keep their pleasant appearance became conceited and disdained 
those who looked ugly, while the latter became jealous and covetous 
and hated the former. The sentient beings thus once again began to dis- 
pute among themselves.

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
At that time the outgrowths ceased to be produced, and in the ground
there grew instead coarse, thick outgrowths, some of which had good
scent and taste and could be eaten, though these were far fewer in quan-
tity. The sentient beings continued to live again by partaking of these
outgrowths from the ground. Whoever ate excessively lost their good
complexion, their skin becoming rough and ugly, while whoever ate
much less maintained a pleasant complexion. As before, the problem
of good or bad with regard to those whose appearance was handsome
and those whose appearance was ugly [once again] led to disputes.
Then those outgrowths ceased to be produced. In the ground there
instead grew a nonglutinous rice crop. Since its grains had no husks
but were of good color and taste and were quite edible, the sentient
beings again continued to live for some time by partaking of this rice
crop. While their subsistence on the rice crop continued in the world,
male and female beings were attracted to each other, resulting in the
natural arousal of carnal desire and mutual intimate relations. Having
seen them together, the others warned them, saying, “What you are
doing is not right. You are excommunicated and driven out of our human
community. Come back when the duration of three months has passed.”
The Buddha continued:
What had once been regarded as bad then came to be regarded as good.
Those sentient beings learned the pleasure of sexual intercourse, pursued
emotion, and fulfilled desire in every way without control, without
restriction. Because of their mutual shame they began to construct pri-
vate houses. This was the beginning of the institution of housing. As
they indulged in sexual intercourse, this naturally reinforced their carnal
desire to increase in intensity. Thus developed the womb, due to unclean
behavior, and this was the functional beginning of the human repro-
ductive organs.
At that time, the sentient beings partook of rice grain grown naturally.
They harvested it as needed throughout the day, and hence it was never
overharvested. Then a lazy person quietly thought to himself, “Har-
vesting rice for breakfast in the morning and again for dinner in the
evening is too much work. I will take at one time enough rice for both
```

38a

```
Sutra 5: Lesser Causality
```

meals.” Later, one of his friends called him to go harvest rice together. 
The former replied, “I have [already] harvested enough rice to be used 
for two meals today. If you wish to harvest, go by yourself.” The man 
then thought to himself, “How cunning he is! He harvested more rice 
than he needed for one meal and stored it until it was needed. I too will 
now harvest and store enough rice for three days.” Thus, that man [har- 
vested and] stored enough rice for three days’ meals. Then another 
man asked him to harvest rice together. He replied, “I have already 
harvested and stored the amount I need for three days. If you wish to 
go harvest rice, go by yourself.” So this man too thought to himself, 
“He is cunning; he harvested enough rice to serve for three days and 
keeps it in storage. I will try to best him by harvesting and storing 
enough rice for five days.” At once he harvested rice to serve for five 
days. Soon all the sentient beings tried to outdo the others in harvesting 
rice. Thus, overharvested, the rice crop became barren and weed-ridden 
and began to produce husks. Once cut down it did not grow again. 
The sentient beings were not pleased at all and were worried and 
bewildered. They thought:

```
When originally born, I initially lived on thoughts as food, flew
with supernormal speed in midair, my body automatically emitted
light, and I continued to exist in this world. Later on a sweetwater
fountain sprang up. Since it was like cream from butter or honey
with its good scent and taste, it was edible and we partook of it
together at all times. As things went on in this manner for some
time, whoever partook of it more began to look ugly with a bad
complexion, whereas those who partook of it less maintained their
good appearance and pleasant complexion. Because of this difference
in diet, our appearances began to vary as to fair or ugly. We sentient
beings thus held different judgments and hated each other.
Then the sweetwater fountain dried up all by itself, and some
outgrowth from the soil of this land then developed. Since the taste
of this outgrowth was endowed with good color, flavor, and scent
and it was edible, we began to partake of it again for some time to
come. Whoever partook of it more began to look ugly with a bad

```
complexion, whereas those who ate less of it maintained their good
looks and pleasant complexion. Because of this difference in our
diets our complexions began to vary as to fair or ugly. The sentient
beings thus held different judgments and hated each other.
At that time, the [previous] outgrowth from the ground ceased
to grow, replaced instead by a coarse, thick outgrowth. Since some
of this outgrowth was of good scent and taste and was edible, we
again began to partake of it. Because of this difference in diet, our
complexions began to vary as to fair or ugly. The sentient beings
thus held different judgments and hated each other.
Then that outgrowth ceased to be produced and a nonglutinous
rice crop grew instead. Since the grains had no husks, all of us sen-
tient beings again continued to live by partaking of this rice for
some time to come. Then some lazy ones among us tried to outdo
the others in harvesting it and storing the rice. Thus, overharvested,
the rice crop became barren and weed-ridden and began to produce
husks, and once cut down it ceased to grow again. What should we
do now?
[The sentient beings] then said to each other, “We should divide the
land for each of us and put up signs [demarcating ownership].” At
once, they divided the land among different owners and erected sign-
posts on their parcels of land.
O Vāseṭṭa, this was the origin of the term “rice paddy,” a plot of
land for cultivating the rice crop. At that time, when the sentient beings
established the boundaries for the respective plots of land assigned to
them, the thought of stealing the crops belonging to others gradually
developed. Having seen such behavior, the other sentient beings said,
“What you have done is not good. Your conduct is wrong because even
though you have your own plot of land you steal others’ crops. From
now on you should not do such a thing.” Yet there was no end to the
thought of theft among those sentient beings. Nor was there an end on
the part of other sentient beings of accusing those who had misbehaved.
Sometimes they punished those who had misbehaved by striking them
and reporting to the others, “This man, who has his own plot of land,
has stolen things belonging to others.” The accused, on the other hand,
```

```
Sutra 5: Lesser Causality
```

also reported to the others, “This man struck me.” At that time, having 
seen such disputes, everyone was distressed and they said:

```
The sentient beings are deteriorating morally, just as a rolling stone
[degrades], and because of such wrong actions the defilement of filth
has developed in this society. This is the cause of birth, old age,
illness, and death, and the effect of the suffering of defilement is to
fall into the three evil courses of life. These disputes arose because
of the parceled lands of rice crops. We would be better off if we
elected someone as our leader and let him deal with these disputes.
He should protect those who are worthy of protection and punish
those who should be punished. Every member of the community
shall give a portion of their rice harvest as payment for the service
undertaken by the appointed person in dealing with these disputes.
```

Then they chose someone from among themselves who was tall and 
physically imposing, handsome in appearance, and who projected an 
aura of authority. They said to him, “We wish you to become our leader 
as elected by us, equal voters, to protect those who need protection, 
punish those who should be punished, and leave alone those whose 
lives need not be interrupted. We shall collect a portion of each of our 
rice harvests for your stipend.” The person thus chosen by the members 
of the community listened to the people’s words, took on the role of 
chieftain, and dealt with the various disputes, while the community 
collected a portion of each member’s rice harvest and provided it to 
their leader. The [leader] consoled the public with good words. Having 
heard his words, the people greatly rejoiced and praised him, “Very 
good, _mahārāja_ (“great king”).” 
This was the origin of the title of “king” in the human world. Because 
the king ruled his citizens in reliance on the right Dharma, he was 
called a _kṣatriya_. This was the very beginning of the _kṣatriya_ class in 
the human world. 
There was one person among the members of the community who 
thought to himself, “Household life is a great danger; it is a poisonous 
thorn. I should abandon my household and stay in the mountain forests, 
practicing austerity in a secluded place.” This man thus renounced

```
38c
```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

```
household life, entered the mountain forests, and practiced contemplation
in total quietude and silence. When the proper time came, he picked up
an almsbowl and went to a nearby village for an almsround. On seeing
him, the people willingly offered him food and praised him with delight,
“Very good, sir. You courageously renounced family life to reside in
the mountain forests, practicing austerity in total silence, in order to
free yourself from all kinds of evil influences.” This was the origin of
the word brāhmaṇa in human society. Among these brāhmaṇa s there
were some who did not enjoy the life of meditation and contemplation
in a secluded place, so they returned to ordinary society, making a pro-
fession of learning and reciting sutras, and thus said of themselves, “I
am a nonpractitioner of meditation.” Because of this, people called such
a person a “nonpracticing brāhmaṇa .” When such a person lives among
ordinary people he is called an ordinary human brāhmaṇa. Thus there
came to be the brāhmaṇa class in human society.
Among the sentient beings there were some types of people in human
society who enjoyed conducting business and amassing riches and
wealth. Because of this activity, people called them vaiśya, household-
ers. Again, among the people there were those who excelled in various
activities such as engineering, craftsmanship, and so on, and they were
the producers of many things. Because of this, there came to be the
name śūdra , craftsman.
O Vāseṭṭha, I have now explained the four kinds of classes, but there
was another, fifth classification, called śramaṇa. The reason that this
term came to be used, Vāseṭṭha, is that among the kṣatriya s there was
a man who disliked his own family’s profession, shaved his hair and
beard, donned the robe of a mendicant, and practiced austerity. This
was the beginning of the word śramaṇa. Regardless of whether one is
of the brāhmaṇa, vaiśya, or śūdra class, therefore, when he does not
wish to pursue his duty or profession, shaves his hair and beard, dons
the mendicant robe, and practices austerity, he is to be regarded as a
śramaṇa.
O Vāseṭṭha, if someone of the kṣatriya class physically commits a
wrong action, verbally commits a wrong action, or volitionally commits
a wrong action, when his body comes to dissolution and his life ends
```

```
Sutra 5: Lesser Causality
```

he is bound to receive the retribution of suffering. In like manner, if 
someone of the _brāhmaṇa, vaiśya,_ or _śūdra_ classes commits wrong 
physical, verbal, or volitional actions, then when his body comes to 
dissolution and his life ends he is bound to receive the retribution of 
suffering. 
O Vāseṭṭha, if someone of the _kṣatriya_ class performs good physical, 
verbal, or volitional actions, when his body comes to dissolution and 
his life ends he is bound to receive the reward of happiness. In like 
manner, if someone of the _brāhmaṇa, vaiśya,_ or _śūdra_ classes performs 
good physical, verbal, or volitional actions, then when his body comes 
to dissolution and his life ends he is bound to receive the reward of 
happiness. 
O Vāseṭṭha, if someone of the _kṣatriya_ class commits a good or bad 
action physically, verbally, or mentally, when his body comes to dis- 
solution and his life ends he is bound to receive one of two types [of 
result]: either the reward of happiness or the retribution of suffering. 
In like manner, if someone, whether he is of the _brāhmaṇa, vaiśya,_ or 
_śūdra_ class, commits good or bad physical, verbal, or mental conduct, 
when his body comes to dissolution and his life ends he is bound to 
receive either the reward of happiness or the retribution of suffering. 
If someone of the _kṣatriya_ class shaves his hair and beard, dons the 
mendicant robe, and practices the path, and if he is engaged in the prac- 
tice of the seven auxiliary practices of enlightenment, it will not be long 
before he realizes the path. Why is that so? When someone of the _kṣatriya_ 
class decides to wear the mendicant robe, renounce family life, and 
practice foremost austerity, he is certain to experience directly in the 
present life the exhaustion of the cause of birth and death, the accom- 
plishment of the practice of austerity, the accomplishment of what should 
be done [for religious salvation], and freedom from further rebirth. In 
the same way, when someone, whether he belongs to the _brāhmaṇa, 
vaiśya,_ or _śūdra_ class, decides to shave his hair and beard, wear the 
mendicant robe, and practice the seven auxiliary practices of enlight- 
enment, it will not be long before he realizes the path. Why? Because 
if he wears the mendicant robe, renounces family life, and practices 
foremost austerity, he is certain to experience directly in the present life

```

```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

the exhaustion of the cause of birth and death, the accomplishment of 
the practice of austerity, the accomplishment of what should be done 
[for religious salvation], and freedom from further rebirth. 
O Vāseṭṭha, those _śramaṇa_ s who come out of those four different 
classes and are destined to realize insight and practice in perfect accor- 
dance, and thereby attain the ultimate state of arhatship, should indeed 
be regarded as primary among the five classes of people. 
The Buddha said to Vāseṭṭha, “The god Brahmā uttered the following 
verse:”

Among all the sentient beings, 
The _kṣatriya_ s are superior 
In their decisive renunciation of class status. 
They are foremost in the human world 
In regard to their capacity 
Of matching insight and practice. 
The Buddha said to Vāseṭṭha: 
What this Brahmā god said is good, it is not misleading. What this 
Brahmā god understood is not wrong, it is not a mistaken meaning. I 
shall now immediately approve his statement. Why? Because as Tathā- 
gata I am ready to assert the same statement. 
Among all the sentient beings, 
The _kṣatriya_ s are superior 
In their decisive renunciation of class status. 
They are foremost in the human world 
In regard to their capacity 
Of matching insight and practice. 
At that time, the World-honored One completed the foregoing exhortation. 
Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja realized freedom from the influence of defilements 
and attained the state in which their minds were totally liberated. Having lis- 
tened to the Buddha’s teaching, the two were delighted with the teaching 
and followed it.

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 26: Cakkavati-sīhanāda Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was sojourning in the communities 
of the Mātulā country (in Magadha), and after a leisurely journey accompanied 
by one thousand two hundred and fifty disciples, he arrived at the country of 
Mātulā. At that time, the World-honored One said to his disciples:

```
You should make yourself your [own] lamplight, make the Dharma
your lamplight, but you should not make anything else your lamplight.
Rely on yourself as your refuge and rely on the Dharma as your refuge,
but do not rely on anything else as your refuge. What do you think this
means, O bhikṣu s, to say that you should make yourself your [own]
lamplight, make the Dharma your lampight, but not make anything
else your lamplight, and that you should make yourself your refuge,
make the Dharma your refuge, but not make anything else your refuge?
Here, each bhikṣu should observe his inner body or inner senses in
concentration; he should exert himself with no slackening, be mindful
of his observations and keep them in memory, and thereby remove worldly
desires and worries. In observing his outer body or outer senses, and also
observing both the inner and outer body, each bhikṣu should exert himself
with no slackening, be mindful of his observations, and keep them in
memory, and thereby remove worldly desires and worries. It is the same
with observing one’s sense perception, intellect, psychophysical aggre-
gation of elements, and analytical introspection. This is what I mean
when I say that each monk should make himself his [own] lamplight,
make the Dharma his lamplight, but not make anything else his lamplight,
and to make himself his refuge, make the Dharma his refuge, but not
make anything else his refuge. Any practitioner who steadfastly keeps
the above principle cannot be deceived even by the Evil One, and that
practitioner’s merit will increase every day. Why is that so?

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

```
Once, during a period in the immemorial past, there was a king,
Daḷhanemi (Pāli) by name, who was of the kṣatriya class, anointed on
his head, and duly enthroned. He became the holy cakravartin, the
universal ruler who turns the golden wheel, and he ruled all four quarters
of the continent. The king spontaneously ruled the continent in reliance
on the Dharma and was endowed with the seven extraordinary treasures:
first, the heavenly wheel; second, the white elephant; third, the dark
blue horse; fourth, the divine gem; fifth, the jadelike queen; sixth, the
gentleman householder; and seventh, the military commander. He had
one thousand sons, courageous and valiant, who could defeat any adver-
sary and enabled peace to prevail spontaneously everywhere without
the use of weapons.
King Daḷhanemi thus ruled for a long time, but finally he was
approaching the end of his life. Then the golden wheel suddenly left
its usual position, hovering in midair. The official in charge of the
golden wheel at once reported this to the king, “Your majesty, the
golden wheel has now moved away from its usual position in midair,
sir.” Having heard this report, the king thought to himself:
I once heard from some learned elders that when the golden wheel
changes its position it means that the king’s life span is near its end.
Though I have already enjoyed extraordinary rewards foremost
among men, I aspire to a heavenly happiness through further expe-
diency. I should have the prince enthroned as the ruler of all the
quarters of the continent, except for a village that I may spare for
my barber, and have him shave my hair and beard. I will don the
three mendicant robes, go forth from family life, and practice the
path of religion.
Then King Daḷhanemi at once summoned the prince and said to him:
I wonder if you know this. I was told by some learned elders that
when the golden wheel changes its position, the king’s life span is
close to its end. Though I have already enjoyed extraordinary rewards
foremost among men, I aspire to a heavenly happiness through further
expediency. Now, I am going to shave my hair and beard, wear the
```

```
Sutra 6: The Universal Ruler’s Practice
```

```
three mendicant robes, renounce family relations, and practice the
path of religion. I entrust to your rule the four quarters of the continent.
You should exert yourself in inquiring after the populace and assisting
them in their well-being and the security of their possessions.
```

The prince accepted all the instructions the king left for him. Thereupon, 
King Daḷhanemi shaved his hair and beard, donned the three robes, 
and renounced family life for the practice of the path. After seven days 
had passed since the king’s renunciation of household life, the golden 
wheel suddenly disappeared. The official in charge of the wheel reported 
this to the new king: “Your majesty, the golden wheel has suddenly 
disappeared, sir.” The king was not pleased and at once visited the [for- 
mer] king Daḷhanemi and said to him, “O father-king, the golden wheel 
has suddenly disappeared, sir.” Daḷhanemi replied to his son:

```
Do not be worried or displeased. This golden wheel is no longer
[my] possession. When you have accomplished your rule with exer-
tion, according to the right Dharma that is to be upheld by the holy
ruler, you should bathe in scented warm water on the full-moon
night, the fifteenth of the month, and ascend to the top of the Su -
dharma-sabhā hall surrounded by the palace ladies. The golden
wheel will [then] spontaneously appear before you. The golden
wheel has a thousand spokes, rich in color and splendor. It was built
by a heavenly master and does not belong to the human world.

The son asked his father, the [former] king, “What is the right Dharma 
of the holy king _cakravartin_ , sir? O father-king, please tell me what I 
should do, sir.” The [former] king said to his son:

```
Dear king, you should commit yourself to making the Dharma your
reliance, uphold it and let it accompany you as your assistance; you
should pay respect and reverence to the Dharma and honor it, care-
fully evaluate its practical application, make the law primary, and
thus protect the right Dharma. Again, you should teach the palace
ladies according to the Dharma, and also keep a protective watch
over them; you shall instruct the princes, ministers, fellow officials,
and all bureaucratic members as well as various people, śramaṇa s

and brāhmaṇa s, and keep a protective watch over all of them, even
down to the level of birds and animals.
The king said again to his son:
Again, if you find within your territorial confines some śramaṇa s
and brāhmaṇa s who faithfully carry out pure and true conduct, who
exert themselves without slackening in the removal of self-conceit,
who uphold perseverance and benevolence and with self-motivation
practice in solitary seclusion, realizing quiescence and nirvana; and
who, having removed their avarice and desire, help others remove
their avarice and desire; and, having removed their hatred and anger,
help others remove their hatred and anger as well as to remove their
delusion; who on meeting with passion are yet unaffected by it, on
meeting with evil are yet unaffected by it, on meeting with delusion
are yet free from it, on meeting with something with which to become
attached they remain unattached to it; who on meeting with something
upon which to dwell are not drawn to it and on meeting with some-
thing with which to be occupied do not become preoccupied with
it; who are honest in their physical, verbal, and volitional deeds; who
are pure and genuine in their physical deeds, verbal expressions, and
mental thoughts, as well as in right thought; who never weary of
compassion and wisdom; who are satisfied with their food and robes
and know how to be content; who go with an almsbowl on alms -
rounds, blessing the donors who offer charity—if you find such prac-
titioners, endowed with all of the foregoing virtues, you should visit
them from time to time and question them:
As to the disciplines that one practices, what is good and what
is bad? What should and should not be regarded as committing
an offense? With what should one associate and with what
should one not associate? What should one do and not do?
What kind of principles should one apply in implementing pol-
icy in order to secure happiness for a long time?
After asking these questions, you should evaluate their answers in
your mind and execute whatever should be done and abandon whatever

should not be done. If there are elderly people without children, the
state should provide for them. When those who are covetous, impov-
erished, destitute, and lowly come to take things, you should refrain
from rejecting them. You should not change the ancient laws that have
existed in the state. These are the major principles that the universal
ruler, worthy of turning the golden wheel, should practice. May you
respectfully accept these principles and carry them out.
```

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

```
Having listened to his father’s instructions, the new universal ruler
carried out his practice of governance in compliance with his father’s
admonitions. Later, on the fifteenth day [of the month], the full-moon
day, he bathed in scented warm water and ascended to the top of the
Sudharma-sabhā hall, surrounded by the palace ladies. The treasured
wheel then suddenly appeared before the king of its own accord. The
wheel had a thousand spokes, rich in color and splendor. It was built
by a heavenly master and was not of this world. It was made of genuine
gold and had a diameter of thirty-two feet. The universal ruler quietly
thought to himself:
I once heard from my virtuous elder the following words: “When
a king of the kṣatriya race, anointed on his head and thus duly
enthroned, bathes in scented warm water on the full-moon day, the
fifteenth of the month, and ascends to the top of the pavilion, sur-
rounded by the palace ladies, then at that moment the golden wheel
will appear before him spontaneously. The wheel, rich in color and
splendor, has a thousand spokes. It was built by a heavenly master
and does not belong to this world. It is made of genuine gold and
has a diameter of thirty-two feet. Thereupon, the king is called the
cakravartin, or the one who turns the sacred wheel.”
I see this wheel before me, but who knows if it really works? I
should now test this wheel treasure.
Then the king cakravartin called the four divisions of the army to
assemble. He faced the golden wheel directly, and rearranging his gar-
ment to expose his right shoulder and kneeling with his right knee

touching the ground, he rubbed the wheel with his right hand and said
to the wheel, “Let the wheel turn itself toward the east, turning as it
should, without losing regularity.” The wheel at once began to roll
toward the east. King Mahāsudarśana followed after the wheel, leading
the four divisions of his army. As the golden wheel rolled forward the
four guardian gods were in charge of guiding it. Wherever the wheel
stopped, the king stopped his chariot.
At that time, having seen the great king approaching, the rulers of
the small countries in the eastern regions prepared a golden bowl filled
with silver grains and a silver bowl filled with golden grains, sap-
proached the king, and, with their heads bowed, said to him:
Welcome, great king. The eastern countries are now blessed with
an abundance of harvests and produce, the people are prosperous,
the nature of the populace is friendly and harmonious, and all are
filial to their parents and loyal to their rulers. O holy ruler, your
majesty is recommended to govern these lands through offices estab-
lished here. We shall closely attend your majesty and will execute
your commands as you wish, sir.
At that time, King Mahāsudarśana replied to the rulers of the small
countries:
Enough, dear wise kings, your offerings have already been appre-
ciated by me. Your majesties rule these countries on the basis of the
right Dharma, so that neither injustice nor wrong action can take
place in your countries. I say that these two principles embody my
governance.
After listening to his exhortation, the kings of the small countries
accompanied King Mahāsudarśana on his inspection tour until they
reached the eastern ocean The great king then proceeded toward the
south, then to the west, then to the north, and in whatever direction the
wheel rolled they followed. The kings of the small countries in these
regions all abnegated their dominions for the sake of the great ruler,
just as the eastern rulers had done.
```

```
Sutra 6: The Universal Ruler’s Practice
```

At that time, King Mahāsudarśana, having made a complete round 
of the four oceans following the golden wheel, educated the populace 
in the path of morality, provided security in their lives, and then returned 
to his own country. The golden wheel continued to hover in midair 
above the palace gate. Rejoicing by dancing and leaping, King Mahā- 
sudarśana said, “This treasure, the golden wheel, is truly my blessing. 
Now I am truly the universal ruler who turns this sacred wheel.” This 
is called the realization of the first treasure, the golden wheel. Since 
that time, the king ruled the continent for the full duration of his life. 
The golden wheel then suddenly shifted its position from where it 
had been before. The official in charge of the golden wheel at once 
reported this event to the king: “Your majesty, the golden wheel has 
now moved away from its usual position, sir.” Having heard this report, 
the king thought to himself:

```
I once heard from some learned elders that when the golden wheel
changes its position it means that the king’s life span is near its end.
Though I have already enjoyed extraordinary rewards foremost among
men, I aspire to a heavenly happiness through further expediency. I
will have the prince enthroned as ruler of all the [four] quarters of
the continent, except for a village I will spare for my barber, who will
shave my hair and beard. Wearing the three mendicant robes, I will
go forth from family life and practice the path of religion.
```

Then the king at once summoned his prince and told him:

```
I wonder if you know of this. I was told by some learned elders that
when the golden wheel changes its position the king’s life span is
near its end. Though I have already enjoyed extraordinary rewards
foremost among men, I aspire to a heavenly happiness through fur-
ther expediency. Now I am going to shave my hair and beard, don
the three mendicant robes, renounce family relations, and practice
the path of religion. I shall entrust to your rule the four quarters of
the continent. You should exert yourself in inquiring after the pop-
ulace and assisting them in their well-being and the security of their
possessions.
```

```
The prince accepted all the instructions the king left for him. Thereupon,
King Daḷhanemi shaved his hair and beard, donned the three robes,
and renounced family life for the practice of the path. When seven
days had passed since the king’s renunciation of household life, the
golden wheel suddenly disappeared. The official in charge of the wheel
reported this to the new king, “Your majesty, the golden wheel has
suddenly disappeared, sir.” The king was not worried and he did not
immediately go visit his father, the king. The father-king then suddenly
passed away.
Before the new king, the preceding six cakravartin rulers had handed
down the principles of governance from one to another and ruled the
continent on the basis of the right Dharma. But the new king of the
present time relied solely on his own principles and did not rely on the
ancient principles for governing the continent. As a result, his reign
became unfair and unjust and the entire continent under the heavens
was filled with grievances and protests. The land was damaged, its
productivity diminished, and the populace declined. A brāhmaṇa min-
ister visited the king and advised him:
Your majesty, know that the land has now been damaged, its pro-
ductivity has been diminished, and the populace has declined, sir.
Your majesty, we have still some people who, being learned and
knowledgeable, know the history of the past and present, and in
addition they know the legacy of the previous king’s governance.
Why not summon them and listen to what they advise, sir? They
can reply directly to your majesty.
Thereupon, the king invited the retainers and questioned them about
the legacy of the previous king’s governance. These wise and knowl-
edgeable men answered his questions in detail. Following their advice,
the king adopted the ancient principles of governance in an effort to
protect the world through the Dharma. But he could not extend the
reign’s service and protection either to elderly people who were without
support or to those who lived in abject poverty and destitution.
The citizens of the country became increasingly impoverished and
finally began committing various crimes of mutual encroachment and

seizure by violence, and theft and robbery became more frequent than 
ever. Then an accuser, hoping to regain his possessions, brought a crim- 
inal before the king, asserting: “This man is a thief, sir. Please punish 
him.” The king questioned the [accused] man, “Did you really commit 
theft?” He replied, “Yes, sir. I am poor, destitute, and unable to survive. 
Hence, I could not help doing it, sir.” The king provided the man with 
some money from his treasury, admonishing him, “With this you should 
support your parents and rescue your family. From now on, do not 
commit theft.” 
Some of those who heard this story then deliberately committed 
theft, and the king also gave them money from his treasury. Thus, again, 
when someone was robbed of his possessions, in the hope of regaining 
his losses he brought the robber before the king, asserting, “This man 
robbed me, sir. Please, punish him.” The king questioned the accused, 
“Did you really commit robbery?” He replied, “Yes, sir. I am poor, des- 
titute, starved, and cannot otherwise survive, sir. I could not help it, sir.” 
The king then provided the man with some money from his treasury 
and admonished him, “With this, you should support your parents and 
rescue your family, and from now on do not commit robbery.” 
Having heard that the king gave money to a man who had committed 
robbery, some again openly plundered others’ possessions. Those who 
had been robbed, hoping to regain their losses, brought the criminals 
before the king, saying: “This man is a robber, sir. Please punish him.” 
The king questioned them, “Did you really commit robbery?” and they 
replied, “Yes, sir. I am poor, destitute, starved, and I could not otherwise 
survive, sir. I could not help it, sir.” The king, however, thought to himself:

```
I saw a dire state of poverty and destitution in those earlier cases
of robbery, and thought that if some means were granted these people
then their criminal behavior would end. Yet it seems that having
heard about the earlier cases from one another, some of these mis-
creants have imitated the others and criminal behavior has increased.
The way I have tried to rectify this situation is no longer working.
Therefore, I should now have this man bound on a wooden rack,
issue an announcement of his execution to the public on every street

corner, and then have him transported in a carriage from the city to
the wilderness for execution. This might prevent future occurrences
of robbery.
The king thus ordered his aides to have the man chained and pulled
all around the city streets, accompanied by the sound of drumming
and the announcement of his crime, and then had him transported out
of the city and executed in the wilderness.
Then the people all knew, “Whoever steals will be caught by the
king’s forces, pulled through the streets with his crime announced to
the citizens, and then executed in the wilderness.” The news spread
by word of mouth, “If anyone commits robbery, their fate will be exactly
like that of the criminal who has been executed.” In this situation, the
people began to equip themselves with various weapons in order to
protect themselves, such as fighting sticks, knives, swords, and bows
and arrows, and they began injuring, murdering, attacking, plundering,
and violently robbing one another.
From the time of this king poverty and destitution became a part of
human society for the first time; because of poverty and destitution,
for the first time there came to be crimes of theft and robbery; because
of robbery or plunder, for the first time there occurred armed conflict;
because of armed conflict, for the first time there occurred murders;
and because of murder the people suffered from bad complexions and
exhaustion and their life spans decreased. At that time, the human life
span was as long as forty thousand years. Thereafter, it quickly shortened
and the average person’s life span became twenty thousand years. The
age of people then became limited, they met untimely deaths, and suf-
fered unhappiness. Then those suffering people began to have passion
for sexual indulgence and insatiable material desire and contrived
fraudulent ways to steal others’ things. The sentient beings of that time
indeed underwent the depredations of poverty and destitution, robbery
and theft, armed conflict and murder, one after another, rapidly and
frequently.
Human life span was now decreased to ten thousand years. During
the age when the life span was reduced to ten thousand years, the sentient
```

```

beings were also engaged in robbery and theft. When an accuser brought 
a criminal before the king in the hope of regaining his lost possessions, 
and appealed to him, “This man robbed me, may the king punish him,” 
and the king then questioned the criminal, “Have you really robbed?”, 
the criminal replied, “No, sir.” Thus, the vice of speaking falsehoods 
arose in human society. At that time, because of poverty and destitution 
many sentient beings were engaged in criminal acts of robbery and 
theft. Because of robbery by bandits, there occurred armed conflict. 
Because of armed conflict, murders occurred; because of murders, the 
insatiable desire for material goods and sexual indulgence occurred; 
because of insatiable desire for material goods and passion for sexual 
indulgence, the vice of falsehood occurred; because of the vice of false- 
hood, human life span rapidly decreased down to one thousand years. 
During the period when the life span was one thousand years, three 
wrong verbal behaviors arose for the first time: deceptive speech, verbal 
abuse, and sycophancy, or flattering words. These wrong behaviors 
spread widely. As a result, the human life span was reduced to five 
hundred years of age. During the period when the life span was five 
hundred years, there arose three other wrongdoings: immoral sexual 
behavior, avarice, and erroneous views. These three wrong behaviors 
spread widely. As a result human longevity futher decreased to three 
or two hundred years. The present people of our age live only up to a 
hundred years of age, only a few people live beyond one hundred while 
the majority live less than that. 
In this manner, wrongdoings arose and spread without end and human 
life span decreased further, eventually down to ten years of age. During 
the period when human life span is ten years, only five months after birth 
a female would be of marriageable age. The society of this time would 
not know of items such as butter, cooking oil, molasses, raw sugar, or 
any foods of various sweet tastes. The rice grains or rice crop would turn 
to grass and weeds. Clothing made of silken fabric, silk brocade, twilled 
fabric, cotton, or white wool, all well known in the present age, would 
be unknown to those sentient beings. They would make only a rough 
woven cloth of woolen yarn for wrapping around their upper bodies.

```
At that time, the ground would be covered with all kinds of thorny
plants and the number of all kinds of poisonous insects such as mos-
quitoes and gadflies, as well as flies and lice, snakes and vipers, and
bees and maggots would multiply. Well-known precious materials,
such as gold, silver, lapis lazuli, jade, and pearls, would all sink deep
down underground, and only clay, rocks, sand, and gravel would surface.
In that age, sentient beings would not have heard of the ten good deeds
for a long time. Only the ten bad deeds would prevail and overwhelm
their society. There would be no name that refers to any of the good
laws or norms of conduct. Indeed, how could these people discipline
themselves with good conduct when there is no idea of good whatso-
ever? The sentient beings of that age would commit all kinds of
wretched, hideous crimes.
They would not be filial to their parents, nor would they pay respect
to their teachers and elders, nor would they be loyal, nor would they
have any sense of commitment. Thus only treacherous and unprincipled
people would be praised, in exact contrast to the present day, where
respect and reverence accrue only to those who are filial to their parents,
respectful toward teachers and elders, loyal and faithful, and who prac-
tice the disciplines according to the principle of righteousness and
morality. The sentient beings of that age would indeed commit the ten
evil deeds and thus fall into evil courses of life. Whenever people meet
they would wish to kill one another, just as a hunter today would wish
to kill deer when encountering a group of them. The earth would be
filled with ditches and pits, creeks and torrential mountain rivers, deep
valley crevices, and the terrain would mostly be desert with scarcely
any people; it would be extremely frightening to travel throughout the
land. In that time, whenever an armed conflict or uprising occurred
people would fashion spears and lances out of plants and wood, and
mutual slaughter and killing would begin and spread widely for seven
days. Then some wise one would escape far away from the killing
grounds and hide in a pit or cave, and with his mind filled with fear,
he would utter words of friendly love, “If you do not injure me, I too
shall not injure you.” Eating fruit and the roots of grass and trees, he
would maintain his life for seven days. Finally, emerging from the

shelter and finding someone who had survived, he would exclaim in 
joy, “You have not been killed!” and the two would rejoice and con- 
gratulate each other. Such joy may be compared to the parents’ joy 
when their child has been separated from them for some time but they 
finally find him and are reunited. The person in question would feel 
exactly like that, and [the survivors] would mutually congratulate each 
other. They would then return to their homes, only to find that many 
of their relations had died. 
Again, for seven days, they would cry in sorrow, wailing and mourn- 
ing. Having passed the initial seven days like this, upon meeting each 
other and other survivors, once again they would congratulate one 
another and enjoy and rejoice in their survival. They would then think 
to themselves, “Our accumulation of evil causes is extensive. Because 
of this, we have met the disaster of all our relations having died and 
our households reduced to nothing. Now we should practice good 
together. What kind of good deeds do we need to do? It must be the 
principle of not taking life.” At that time, all sentient beings would be 
determined to cherish friendly love and not kill each other. Under this 
circumstance, the life span of sentient beings would rapidly increase 
from ten to twenty years. 
The people of this period, whose life span is only twenty years, would 
think to themselves, “We have upheld the practice of good, namely not 
taking life, so our life spans have increased to twenty years. Now we 
should practice still more good. What kind of good should we practice? 
We have already upheld not killing, hence it should now be the principle 
of not stealing.” Having thus practiced the principle of not stealing, 
their life spans would be able to increase to forty years. The people of 
this period would then think to themselves, “Because of our practice 
of an additional good principle, we have been able to lengthen our life 
spans. Now we should increase the number of good principles again. 
What kind of good should we practice? It should be not to indulge in 
immoral sex.” Thus, whoever refrained entirely from wrong sexual con- 
duct would to have his life span extended to eighty years. 
The people of this period would then think to themselves, “Because 
of our practice of another good principle we have lengthened our life

spans. Now we should increase the number of good principles again.
What kind of good should we practice? It should be not to speak false-
hood.” Thus, whoever refrained entirely from speaking false words
would have their life span extended to one hundred and sixty years.
The people of this period would then think to themselves, “Because
of our practice of another good principle, we have lengthened our life
spans. Now we should increase the number of good principles. What
kind of good should we practice? It should be not to speak deceptively.”
Thus whoever refrained entirely from deceit would have their life span
extended to three hundred and twenty years.
The people of this period would then think to themselves, “Because
of our practice of another good principle we have lengthened our life
spans. Now we should increase the number of good principles. What
kind of good should we practice? It should be not to speak abusive
words.” Thus whoever has refrained entirely from speaking abusive
words would have their life span extended to six hundred and forty years.
The people of this period would then think to themselves, “Because
of our practice of another good principle we have lengthened our life
spans. Now we should increase the number of good principles. What
kind of good should we practice? It should be not to speak flattering
words.” Thus, whoever refrained entirely from false flattery would
have their life span extended to two thousand years.
The people of this period would then think to themselves, “Because
of our practice of another good principle we have lengthened our life
spans. Now we should increase the number of good principles. What kind
of good should we practice? It should be not to be greedy.” Under this
circumstance, whoever refrained entirely from being greedy and practiced
liberal charity would have their life span extended to five thousand years.
The people of this period would then think to themselves, “Because
of our practice of another good principle we have lengthened our life
spans. Now we should increase the number of good principles. What
kind of good should we practice? It should be not to be jealous but to
practice instead friendly love.” Thus, whoever refrained entirely from
being jealous and practiced friendly love would have their life span
extended to ten thousand years.

The people of this period would then think to themselves, “Because 
of our practice of another good principle we have lengthened our life 
spans. Now we should increase the number of good principles. What 
kind of good should we practice? It should be not to insist on an erro- 
neous perception but to practice right perception.” Thus, whoever prac- 
ticed right perception and entirely refrained from erroneous perception 
would have their life span extended to twenty thousand years. 
The people of this period would then think to themselves, “Because 
of our practice of another good principle we have lengthened our life 
spans. Now we should increase the number of good principles. What 
kind of good should we practice? It should be to end three kinds of 
wrongdoings: immoral sex, immoral greed, and wrong views of life.” 
Thus, whoever entirely abandoned these three wrongdoings would have 
their life span extended to forty thousand years. 
The people of this period would then think to themselves, “Because 
of our practice of another good principle we have lengthened our life 
spans. Now we should increase the number of good principles. What 
kind of good should we practice? It should be to be filial to our parents 
and respectfully serve our teachers and elders.” Thus, whoever was 
filial to his parents and respectfully served his teachers and elders would 
have their life span extended to eighty thousand years.When the human 
life span increases to eighty thousand years, a woman would be married 
for the first time at the age of five hundred years. 
[Even though] at that time there would be nine causes of sickness 
for humans (cold, heat, hunger, thirst, excretion, urination, desire, cov- 
etousness, and aging), the ground would be smooth, even, and orderly 
with no ditches or pits, no barren hills or wastelands, no thorny trees 
or plants. There would not be any mosquitoes or gadflies, snakes or 
vipers, or poisonous insects, and clay, rocks, and gravel would turn to 
lapis lazuli. The population would increase and there would be no limit 
to the degree of bountiful produce of all kinds of crops for each member 
of society, even those of the lowest classes. At that time, eighty thousand 
large cities would be built. Since cities and villages would be close to 
one another the sound of the roosters crowing in the morning would 
be heard from one town to the next.

At that time, there will appear a buddha. He will be called Maitreya
Tathāgata, well endowed with the ten supreme titles, such as Arhat, Per-
fectly Enlightened, and so forth, just as the present Tathāgata is endowed
with all these titles. He will directly accomplish his ultimate experience
before the gods Indra and Brahmā, the Evil One [Māra] and his retainers,
śramaṇa s, and brāhmaṇa s, just as I have accomplished the ultimate
experience before the gods Indra and Brahmā, the Evil One and his
retainers, śramaṇa s, and brāhmaṇa s. This future buddha will teach the
doctrine of his Dharma. His teaching will be lovely at the beginning,
lovely in the middle, and lovely at the end; his words will be endowed
with the well-matched meaning and subjective sense; and he will carry
out the practice of pure and genuine austerity. It shall be just as my
words of teaching today are true and right at the beginning, in the middle,
and at the end, well endowed with meaning and sense, and just as I have
engaged in the practice of pure and genuine austerity.
His disciples will be innumerable, thousands of tens of thousands,
just as I have today innumerable disciples. The people of that age shall
call his disciples the sons and daughters of Maitreya, just as my disciples
today are called the sons and daughters of the Śākya. The king of that
age shall be called Suṃkha, a kṣatriya anointed on his head for enthrone-
ment. This universal king will rule the four quarters of the continent on
the basis of the principle of the right Dharma. There will be no other
king who can contest his rule and he will be endowed with the seven
treasures of the golden wheel, the white elephant, the dark blue horse,
the divine gem, the jadelike queen, the householder gentleman, and the
military commander. The king will have a thousand children, courageous
and valiant, who will repulse any adversaries or invaders. Thus all four
quarters of the continent will pledge respectful allegiance, causing no
wars, and peace will naturally prevail everywhere.
At that time, the holy ruler cakravartin will erect a streamer post
made of precious gems, with a circumference of one hundred twenty
feet and eight thousand feet tall, embellished with a thousand varieties
of colors. There will be a hundred corners on the top of the tower post,
each corner divided into three branches, from which hang streamers
woven out of precious metal threads and studded with various precious

gems. After it is completed, the holy ruler will dismantle the tower. The
entire structure will be donated to the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s as well
as to those who are in poverty, and thereafter the cakravartin will shave
his head, don the three robes, renounce family life, engage in the practice
of the highest path, and will directly experience in the present life the
exhaustion of the cause of birth and death, the accomplishment of the
practice of austerity, the accomplishment of what should be done [for
religious salvation], and freedom from further birth.
```

The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s:

```
You should practice good as strictly as possible. When one practices
good norms his life span will increase, his complexion improves, and
he will enjoy his life in peace and happiness. You may acquire abundant
treasures and will be endowed with the power of authority. As successive
rulers complied with the ancient rules of the cakravartin, their life spans
increased, their complexions improved; they enjoyed their lives in peace
and happiness; and they were endowed with abundant riches and treasures
and vested with the power of authority. It is the same with the bhikṣu s.
You should practice good. Your life span will increase, your complexion
will improve, and you will enjoy lives of peace and happiness.
How can a bhikṣu increase his life span? Each bhikṣu should rely
on the practice of concentration motivated by desire, applying his effort,
without slackening, to the cessation of dispositional forces and to the
practice of the supernormal power thereby attained. In a similar manner,
one should rely on the practice of concentration motivated by endeavor,
motivated by mind, and motivated by thought, applying his effort,
without slackening, to the cessation of dispositional forces and to the
practice of the supernormal powers thereby attained. This is called the
extension of one’s religious life.
How can the bhikṣu s increase their good appearance? If a bhikṣu is
well endowed with the precepts and disciplines he will realize the man-
ner and aura of authority. He experiences great fear over even a minor
offense, learns all the precepts and complies with all of them equally,
and satisfies all of them meticulously. This is the bhikṣu ’s realization
of increased good appearance.

How can the bhikṣu s enjoy lives of peace and happiness? A bhikṣu
should abandon sexual desire and abandon such wrong passion. He
realizes the first meditative state of absorption in which there is an
awareness of an object and an act of examining, while the sense of
joy and bliss increase through removal of the cause of birth (i.e., reach-
ing the supramundane sphere). Next, eliminating the awareness of an
object and the subjective act of its examination, with increasing tran-
quility or self-confidence, continually applying concentration of the
mind, he proceeds to the second meditative state of absorption in
which there is neither the awareness of an object nor a subjective act
but the sense of joy and bliss predominate in the arising state of con-
centration. Next, with the fading away of the sense of joy but dwelling
in a sense of equanimity, fully aware of subtler bliss, he reaches the
third meditative state of absorption in which one experiences the mind-
fulness and bliss sought by a wise and holy practitioner. Next, tran-
scending both pain and pleasure, removing sorrow and joy, he realizes
the fourth meditative state of absorption in which there is neither pain
nor pleasure but an increase in the state of equanimity that consolidates
pure and genuine mindfulness. This is the bhikṣu ’s realization of a
life of peace and happiness.
How can a bhikṣu be endowed with abundant riches and treasures?
A bhikṣu learns and practices the mind of friendly love, first by perme-
ating his mind of friendly love infinitely in one direction, then likewise
in the remaining three directions. Thus he extends his immeasurable
mind of benevolence universally in all directions, neither divided nor
bound to limitation. Casting away various feelings of hatred, leaving
no ill-will in his mind, the bhikṣu enjoys the state of tranquility and
silence, compassion and tenderness. He also completes the remaining
three practices: the immeasurable mind of compassion, the immeasurable
mind of sympathetic joy, and the immeasurable mind of equanimity.
This is the bhikṣu ’s realization of abundant riches and treasures.
How can the bhikṣu s be endowed with the power of authority? A
bhikṣu sees the noble truth of suffering as it really is, and likewise sees
as they really are the remaining three [noble truths]—[the truth of] the
cause of suffering, [the truth of] the cessation of suffering, and [the
```

```

truth of] the path to the cessation of suffering. This is the _bhikṣu_ ’s real- 
ization of the power of authority. 
The Buddha said to the _bhikṣu_ s: 
I have observed all kinds of holders of supernormal power, but none 
of them surpasses the power of the Evil One [Māra]. Yet a _bhikṣu_ who 
has annihilated the influences of defilement has power that is superior 
to that of the Evil One. 
At that time, having listened to the Buddha’s exhortation, the _bhikṣu_ s 
rejoiced, respectfully received it, and carried it out.

### Pāyāsi’s Dialogue

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 23: Pāyāsi Suttanta )

At one time, Kumara-Kāśyapa was leisurely traveling through the country 
of Kośala together with five hundred _bhikṣu_ s and arrived at the village of 
Śvetavyā. Kumara-Kāśyapa then stayed in a forest of _śiṃśapā_ trees to the 
north of the village. There happened to be a _brāhmaṇa_ , Pāyāsi by name, who 
resided in this village. The village was prosperous with bountiful harvests, 
populous, and full of luxuriant trees. King Prasenajit had granted the _brāhmaṇa_ 
Pāyāsi the village as a special fief and exempted it from tax collection. The 
_brāhmaṇa_ always held an unusual view of life and taught it to others: “There 
is no world after death, nor is there rebirth, nor even any reward for good or 
bad deeds done in this world.” 
The people of Śvetavyā village, having heard that Kumara-Kāśyapa had 
arrived at the _śiṃśapā_ forest together with five hundred _bhikṣu_ s from the 
country of Kośala, said to each other:

This _bhikṣu_ Kumara-Kāśyapa is renowned for his realization of the 
state of arhatship. Being a _bhikṣu_ of advanced, senior rank, learned 
and erudite in stature, he can respond to anyone with his sagacity, intel- 
ligence, and eloquence, and he is especially good at doctrinal debate. 
It would be great if we could see him. 
The people of the village then visited the _bhikṣu_ every day in due order. 
At that time Pāyāsi was watching the villagers from the top of a high tower 
as they proceeded one after another in groups, but he was unable to see where 
they were going. He asked his attendants, who were holding parasols over 
him on each side, “Where and why are these people forming groups and 
going one after another?” The attendants replied:

```
We were told that the bhikṣu Kumara-Kāśyapa, with five hundred
bhikṣu s, has been traveling through the country of Kośala and just
arrived at the śiṃśapā forest. We have also heard that being a bhikṣu

```
of advanced, senior rank, learned and erudite in stature, he can respond
to anyone with his sagacity, intelligence, and eloquence, and that he
is especially good at doctrinal debate. These people are forming groups
and going, one after another, to see the bhikṣu Kāśyapa, sir.
Thereupon, the brāhmaṇa said to his attendants:
Go quickly to these villagers and tell them, “Wait awhile. Pāyāsi will
come with you to see the bhikṣu. Why? [I wish to know] if the bhikṣu
is a fool, because he is deceiving the people by asserting that there is
an afterlife, that there will be rebirth, or that there will be retribution
for good or bad conduct, whereas in actuality there is neither afterlife,
nor rebirth, nor reward for good or bad deeds.”
As instructed, the messenger at once ran after the villagers and told them,
“I am conveying to you that the brāhmaṇa asks you to wait awhile, because
he wishes to go with you to see the bhikṣu .” The villagers replied, “Certainly,
that is splendid. If he comes here, we shall go together.”
The messenger returned and reported to Pāyāsi, “The villagers are waiting
for you, sir. If you wish to go with them, you may go.” The brāhmaṇa came
down from the high tower, had his attendant drive the carriage, and surrounded
by villagers in front as well as behind, proceeded toward the śiṃśapā forest.
Having reached the forest, he descended from the carriage, proceeded on
foot, approached the place of Kāśyapa, and, after exchanging greetings with
him with a bow, withdrew to one side to take his seat. Some of the villagers,
brāhmaṇa s and householders, venerated the bhikṣu and then sat; some greeted
him with a bow and sat; others announced their names and sat; some respect-
fully joined their palms together and sat; and some quietly sat down without
saying anything.
Thereupon, the brāhmaṇa Pāyāsi said to Kumara-Kāśyapa, “I am obliged
to question you. Can you spare me some time for my questions?” Kāśyapa
replied, “Let me first hear your question. Then I will know if I can [give you
some time].”
The brāhmaṇa said, “Now, as to my own view of life, I hold that there is
neither afterlife, nor rebirth, nor reward for good or bad action. What is your
theory, sir?” Kāśyapa replied:
```

43a

```
Sutra 7: Pāyāsi’s Dialogue
```

I shall question you now, and please reply accordingly, as you wish. 
Now, do the sun and moon above us belong to this human world or 
another world? Are they heavenly things or human things? 
Pāyāsi answered, “The sun and moon belong to the other world and not 
to this world. Heavenly things are not human things.” 
Kāśyapa said, “According to your reply, there is necessarily another world; 
there is also rebirth, as well as the moral retribution of good and bad.” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ said: 
Although you assert that there is another world, rebirth, and reward 
and retribution of good and bad, my reply to your previous question, 
that the sun and moon belong to the other world, leads to my theory 
that these three (i.e., afterlife, rebirth, and reward or retribution for 
good or bad) are impossible. 
Kāśyapa asked, “Do you have some causal reasons by which to know that 
there is neither afterlife, nor rebirth, nor reward or retribution for good or 
bad actions?” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “I have some reason for ascertaining my theory.” 
Kāśyapa asked, “On what causal reason do you assert that there is no 
afterlife?” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied: 
O Kāśyapa, I have some relations and friends who are suffering because 
they have encountered some calamities and also because they have 
been ill. I visited and asked them, “Some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s 
respectively teach their different doctrines, such as ‘Whoever is guilty 
of committing murder, enegaging in theft, immoral sex, double-dealing, 
harsh words, false speech, frivolous sycophancy, or who have a covetous 
mind, malicious intent, or wrong views will fall into hell when his 
body dissolves and his life ends.’ I cannot believe this kind of thing 
from the outset, because I have never known anyone who, after death, 
returned to tell us where his [new] life is. If someone were to return 
after death and tell me where he has been, then I will certainly believe 
it. Now, you have done all ten kinds of wrongdoings, just as I have 
done. If the teaching of the _śramaṇa_ is correct, when you die you will

```
fall into the great hell. I will believe decisively whatever you say. When
you actually find hell, return to tell me and let me know about it. Then
I will definitely believe it.”
O Kāśyapa, after someone died he did not return, even today. He was
my close relation and certainly would not lie to me. The fact that he has
not returned to let me know [about the afterlife] means that there is no
such afterlife.
Kāśyapa responded:
Many wise people acquire their wisdom by way of analogy. I shall
now give you an analogy to help you understand. For instance, people
such as thieves or robbers always contrive cunning schemes in violation
of the king’s law. When such a person is caught redhanded, with clear
evidence, he is brought before the king and charged: “This man com-
mitted robbery. May your majesty punish him.” The king then orders
his aides, “Chain him to the wooden rack, pull him all around the city
streets, announcing his crime to the public, then transport him out of
the city and hand him over to the executioner.” Thus, as instructed, the
king’s aides carry out the order and finally transfer the criminal to the
executioner. The criminal speaks in an insinuating voice to the guards,
“You should let me go. I must go see my family in order to say goodbye.
After that, I will return here.” What do you think, O brāhmaṇa , would
that guard agree to let him go?
The brāhmaṇa replied, “No, he would not.”
Kāśyapa continued:
There are many people like this criminal in the world, and no guard
would let such a person go. How much more so with someone like
your kinsman, who committed all ten kinds of wrongdoing and was
predestined for hell after his body dissolved and his life ended. The
hellish guards are merciless, nonhuman; they are in the world of the
dead, distinct from the world of the living. If your kinsman had spoken
to those guards in an insinuating voice, “Please let me go for a while.
I will return to the living world and see my relations in order to say

43b

```
Sutra 7: Pāyāsi’s Dialogue
```

goodbye, and then return here,” what do you think—would those guards 
have let him go?” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “No, sir.” 
Kāśyapa continued: 
If you compare both cases, it would be sufficient for you to know that 
it is reasonable [that there is such an afterworld]. Why do you insist 
on a delusion that leads to a wrong view [that there is no afterlife]? 
The _brāhmaṇa_ countered, “Although you assert that there is an afterlife 
by referring to such an analogy, I would still say that there is no such world 
after death.” 
Kāśyapa asked again, “Do you have any other reason on the basis of which 
you know that there is no afterlife?” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “I have another reason to infer that there is no 
afterlife.” 
Kāśyapa asked, “What is the reason?” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied: 
O Kāśyapa, one of my relations was seriously ill. I visited him and 
said to him, “Some _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s respectively teach their 
different doctrines, saying that there is an afterlife, such that whoever 
has abstained from committing murder, engaging in theft, immoral 
sex, double-dealing, harsh words, false speech, frivolous sycophancy, 
and who does not have a covetous mind, malicious intent, and wrong 
views will be born among heavenly beings after his body dissolves 
and his life ends. I cannot believe this kind of thing from the outset, 
because I have never known anyone who, after death, returned to tell 
us where his [new] life is. If someone was to return after death and tell 
me where he has been, I will certainly believe it. Now, you are my 
close relation and have maintained all ten kinds of good deeds. If the 
teaching of the _śramaṇa_ is correct, after death you will surely be reborn 
in the heavenly world. I will believe decisively whatever you say, and 
if it is apparent that you have received the reward of heavenly birth, 
return to tell me and let me know about it. Then I shall believe it.”

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
O Kāśyapa, after his death he has not returned, even now. He was
my close relation and certainly would not lie to me. The fact that he
has not returned to let me know [about the afterlife] means that there
is no such afterlife.
Kāśyapa again said:
Many wise people acquire their wisdom by way of analogy. I shall now
make an analogy to help you understand. For instance, a man fell into
a deep latrine and his entire body sank up to his neck. The king ordered
his attendants to pull him out, take a bamboo spatula and scrape the
filth off of his body three times, wash his body with bean soap and wood
ash, then bathe his body with scented warm water, apply scented powder
and various incense to his body, have a barber wash his hair and beard,
and then wash his body again, three more times. After having his body
cleansed with scented warm water, scented powder applied to his body,
clothed in a renowned upper garment; and having allowed him to enter
the palace and enjoy all the flavors of good food and games and amuse-
ments, would he then return to the latrine?
The brāhmaṇa replied, “No, he would not. That was a filthy and smelly
place. Why would he return to such a place?”
Kāśyapa said:
It would be the same with heavenly beings. This Jambudvīpa continent
is smelly and filthy and impure. The heavenly beings are far distant,
one hundred yojana s above us, and yet they can sense human odors
and smell human waste. O brāhmaṇa , one of your relations or friends,
well endowed with the ten kinds of good deeds, was necessarily born
among the gods and is now enjoying the best of all pleasures through
the five senses. So how could he think of returning to this world, which
is like a lavatory?
The brāhmaṇa replied. “He could not, sir.”
Kāśyapa said again, “If you compare both cases, it is self-evident. Why
do you insist on delusion and cherish a wrong view?”
The brāhmaṇa , however, argued, “Though you assert that there is an
```

43c

```

afterlife on the basis of the foregoing analogy, I still insist that there is no 
such world after death.” 
Kāśyapa again asked, “Do you have any other reason on the basis of which 
you also know that there is no afterlife?” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “I have another reason to infer that there is no 
afterlife.” 
Kāśyapa asked, “What is that reason?” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied: 
O Kāśyapa, someone among my relations was been seriously ill and 
was about to die. I visited him and said to him, “Some _śramaṇa_ s and 
_brāhmaṇa_ s respectively teach their different doctrines, asserting that 
there is an afterlife such that whoever has abstained from committing 
murder, enaging in theft, sexual indulgence, false speech, or ingesting 
intoxicants will be born in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven.” I cannot believe this 
kind of thing from the outset, because I have never seen anyone who, 
after death, returned to tell us in which course of life he has been. If 
someone were to return after death and tell me where he has been, I 
will certainly believe it. Now, you are my close relation and you have 
upheld well the five precepts, so [according to the teaching of the _śra- 
maṇa_ ] you will be born in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven after death. I will 
believe decisively whatever you say, and if it is apparent that you have 
received the reward of heavenly birth, return to tell me and let me know 
about it. Then I will believe it.” 
O Kāśyapa, after his death he has not returned, even now. He was 
my close relation and certainly would not lie to me. The fact that he 
has not returned to let me know [about the afterlife] means that there 
is no such afterlife. 
Kāśyapa replied: 
One hundred years on earth is only a single day and night in Trāyas- 
triṃśa Heaven. In this manner, thirty days make up a month, twelve 
months make a year, and the life span of the residents of Trāyastriṃśa 
Heaven is said to be one thousand years. O _brāhmaṇa_ , your close rela- 
tion who upheld the five precepts was necessarily reborn in that heaven

```

```
when his body dissolved and his life ended. But suppose that after
being born in that heaven he thought to himself, “Since I have been
born here for the first time, I should enjoy my stay here for a few days.”
If he then comes back to report to you about his experience, would he
be able to find you here?
The brāhmaṇa replied. “No, he would not. It would already be long after
the time of my death. How could he find me?” Still, Pāyāsi insisted, “I cannot
believe your story. Who could come down from Trāyastriṃśa Heaven and
tell you that there is such a heaven and that the life span there is such-and-
such?”
Kāśyapa said:
Many wise people acquire their wisdom by way of metaphors. I shall
now make another analogy for you to help you understand. For instance,
a man who has been blind since his birth cannot know the difference
between the five colors of blue, yellow, red, white, and black, nor could
he know by sight the rough or fine surface of objects or the length or
size of objects, nor could he see the sun or moon, the shapes of the
stars, or hills or ditches. Someone asks him, “What are the five colors
of blue, yellow, red, white, and black?” The blind person replies, “There
are no such five colors, nor is there anything, rough or fine, long or
short, nor is there anything such as sun, moon, the shapes of stars, or
hills and ditches.” O brāhmaṇa , would his answer be correct?
[Pāyāsi] replied:
No, it is not correct, because we know that there are actually five dif-
ferent colors, blue, yellow, red, white, and black, [and that there are]
rough or fine and long or short objects, [and that] the sun, moon, the
shapes of the stars, and hills and ditches exist, even though he denies
their existence.
Kāśyapa continued:
You are also like this blind man. The life span of the residents of Trāyas-
triṃśa Heven is real and not unreal. But you deny it just because you
have not seen it yourself.
```

The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “Though you assert that there is an afterlife, I still 
cannot believe it.” 
Kāśyapa again asked the _brāhmaṇa,_ “On the basis of what other reason 
do you know that there is no afterlife?” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied: 
O Kāśyapa, among the people of the village that I received as my fief 
there are some who have committed robbery. The villagers caught one 
thief redhanded and, with clear evidence, they brought him before me, 
demanding, “This man committed robbery. Please punish him.” I 
replied, “Tie him up, put him into a large cauldron, set its lid tightly 
and seal it thickly with mud, so that nothing leaks out.” I ordered men 
to surround the cauldron and build a fire underneath it. At that time I 
wished to test if the person’s spirit could escape from the cauldron and 
I walked around it, followed by my retainers, but I did not see any evi- 
dence of the person’s spirit coming out from that cauldron. Nor did I 
see any spirit coming or going when I examined the interior by opening 
the lid. For this reason, I came to know that there is no afterlife. 
Kāśyapa continued: 
Now I shall question you. Answer me if you can, in any way you wish. 
O _brāhmaṇa_ , when you rest and fall asleep on the high floor of your 
residence, have you ever dreamed of mountain forests and rivers, park 
groves and bathing ponds, country villages and city streets? 
He answered, “Yes, I have.” 
Kāśyapa again asked him, “O _brāhmaṇa_ , when you dream, do your family 
and members of your household guard you closely for your safety?” 
[Pāyāsi] answered, “Yes, they do.” 
[Kāśyapa] again questioned him: “O _brāhmaṇa_ , do your household mem- 
bers see your spirit of consciousness going and coming?” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ answered, “No, they don’t.” 
Kāśyapa said: 
You cannot see the spirit of living consciousness going and coming. 
How much less could you see the spirit of a dead man. You should not 
try to observe the destined afterlife in reference to actual phenomena

appearing before your eyes. O brāhmaṇa , the bhikṣu s reduce the time
of sleep during the hours before and after midnight, and without slack-
ening they exert themselves to be mindful of the auxiliary disciplines
of the path and exercise supernormal vision through the power of con-
centration. It is through this supernormal vision that they see the destinies
of sentient beings in terms of having died here and having been born
there, dying there and being born here, having lived a long life or a
short life, having had a good or bad complexion, beautiful or ugly fea-
tures, having acquired rewards from good or bad deeds, and having
entered good or bad courses of life. You should not try to see through
ordinary human eyes that are defiled. You deny it because your human
vision cannot penetrate the courses of life to which sentient beings are
respectively destined. O brāhmaṇa , because of this, you should know
that there is necessarily an afterlife.
The brāhmaṇa said, “Though you assert that there is an afterlife by making
an analogy, according to my view, an afterlife is still impossible.”
Kāśyapa again said to the brāhmaṇa, “Do you have any other reason on
the basis of which you know that there is no afterlife?”
The brāhmaṇa replied, “Yes, I do.”
Kāśyapa asked, “What is the reason?”
The brāhmaṇa replied:
O Kāśyapa, among the people of the village that I received as my fief,
some committed robbery. The villagers caught one thief redhanded,
and with clear evidence, they brought him before me, demanding,
“This man committed robbery. Please punish him.” I ordered my aides
to tie him up and skin him alive, and [while this was being done] I
sought to find the spirit of his consciousness but I could not find it. I
also ordered my aides to cut open the flesh and I looked there to find
the spirit of consciousness, but again I could not find it. I also ordered
my aides to sever the sinews and I sought to find the spirit of con-
sciousness between the bones, but still I could not find it. I also ordered
my aides to crush the bones and squeeze the marrow out and I sought
to find the spirit of consciousness within the marrow, but again I could
not find it. For this reason, I know that there is no afterlife.

Sutra 7: Pāyāsi’s Dialogue
```

Kāśyapa again said:

```
Many wise people acquire their wisdom by way of analogy. I will now
give another analogy to help you understand. Once in the immemorial
past there was a country where the land was barren and ruined, and
could no longer be used for normal cultivation. Then a group of mer-
chants with five hundred carriages passed through that land. There was
a brāhmaṇa who always stayed in the forest to conduct the fire rite in
service to the fire god. All the traveling merchants stopped to rest
overnight and departed early the next morning. The brāhmaṇa thought
to himself, “Last night, many merchants stayed in the forest and they
departed early this morning. They might have left some things behind.
I shall just go and see.” At once he went to the place where they had
camped. He found nothing left behind, but there was a small child, as
young as a year old, sitting alone. The brāhmaṇa thought to himself,
“I cannot bear to see this child die before my eyes. I must take this
child to my place to raise him.” So he picked up the child and returned
to his place to rear the child. The child grew quickly and grew to be
some ten years of age.
At that time the brāhmaṇa, wishing to go to town for some minor
reason, said to the boy, “I must leave on some business and will be
gone from here for a while. You should guard this fire and never let it
be extinguished. If the fire happens to go out, you should use this drill
to bore wood and make fire by friction, kindling it into flames again.”
Having instructed the boy in detail, the brāhmaṇa left the forest on his
journey. After his departure, however, the boy indulged in his pastimes
and forgot to tend the fire as frequently as he should have. The fire
eventually went out. Returning from his play, the boy noticed that the
fire had gone out and, distressed, he thought to himself, “What I have
done is not good. When my father left he instructed me in detail how
to guard this fire and prevent its extinction. But I indulged in my pas-
times and allowed the fire to go out. What should I do now?”
At once, the boy tried to rekindle the fire by blowing on the embers,
but he could not find the fire there. He cut wood with a hatchet, seeking
fire, but he could not find it inside the wood. Then he chopped up some
wood and pounded it in a mortar, but he still could not get fire.
```

```
44c
```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

At that time the _brāhmaṇa_ returned from town and entered the forest. 
He said to the boy, “I instructed you before to guard the fire. I hope 
that the fire has not gone out.” The boy replied, “While I was playing 
I failed to guard it at times; the fire is extinct, sir.” The _brāhmaṇa_ asked 
him, “In what way have you tried to make fire?” The boy replied, 
“Since fire comes from wood, I split wood with a hatchet, but I could 
not obtain it. I also chopped up wood and pounded it in the mortar, but 
I could not obtain fire there either, sir.” Thereupon, the _brāhmaṇa_ 
picked up the drill to bore wood and made fire by friction, piling sticks 
on it for kindling. He then told the boy, “When you wish to make a 
fire you should do so in this manner. You cannot get fire by splitting 
wood or pounding it.” 
O _brāhmaṇa_ , you too are like that boy, lacking a proper way. By 
skinning a dead corpse, and so forth, you seek the spirit of conscious- 
ness. Concerning sentient beings, you cannot know it just by looking 
at the actual phenomena before your human eyes. O _brāhmaṇa_ , the 
_bhikṣu_ s reduce the time of sleep during the hours before and after mid- 
night, and exert themselves without slackening to be mindful of the 
auxiliary disciplines of the path and exercise supernormal vision through 
the power of concentration. It is through this supernormal vision that 
they see the destinies of sentient beings in terms of their having died 
here and having been born there, dying there and being born here, hav- 
ing lived a long or short life, having had good or bad complexion, 
beautiful or ugly features, having acquired rewards or retribution from 
good or bad deeds, and having entered good or bad courses of life. You 
should not try to see through ordinary human eyes that are defiled. You 
deny it because your human vision cannot penetrate the courses of life 
in which sentient beings are respectively destined. O _brāhmaṇa_ , because 
of this, you should know that there is necessarily an afterlife. 
The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “Though you assert that there is an afterlife by quoting 
an analogy, according to my view, an afterlife is still impossible.” 
Kāśyapa again asked the _brāhmaṇa,_ “Do you have any other reason on 
the basis of which you also know that there is no afterlife?” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “Yes, I do.” 
Kāśyapa asked, “What is that reason?”

```
Sutra 7: Pāyāsi’s Dialogue
```

The _brāhmaṇa_ replied: 
O Kāśyapa, among the people of the village that I received as my fief 
there are some who committed robbery. The villagers caught one thief 
redhanded, and with clear evidence they and brought him before me, 
demanding, “This man committed robbery. Please punish him.” I 
instructed my aides to measure the man’s weight on a scale. When they 
completed the measurement of the criminal’s weight, I further instructed 
them, “Take him away and execute him through the easiest means, but 
do not damage the skin or flesh.” He was executed without any damage 
to his body. I instructed my aides to measure the weight of the corpse, 
which resulted in an indication that the corpse was heavier than the 
living body. 
O Kāśyapa, when the criminal was measured while still alive and 
the spirit of consciousness was still in his body, his physical complexion 
was pleasant and good, he was able to talk, and his body was also 
lighter. After death, however, with the spirit of his consciousness gone, 
with no particular complexion, and speechless, the corpse turned out 
to be heavier than the living body. Because of this, I know that there 
is no afterlife. 
Kāśyapa said to the _brāhmaṇa_ : 
Now I shall question you. Answer me if you can, in any way you wish. 
O _brāhmaṇa_ , your experience is comparable to the case in which men 
measure the weight of iron ore. First, they measure it while it is cool, 
and then they measure it after it has been heated. Why is iron lighter 
when it is heated, becoming bright and pliable? Why is it heavier when 
it is cold and has become dark, hard, and rigid? 
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “Heated iron is bright in color, pliable, and lighter, 
whereas cooled iron has no bright color, is rigidly hard, and is heavier.” 
Kāśyapa said: 
Human beings are also like this. When a person is alive he has color 
in his complexion and his body is flexible, but after death the body 
loses color and becomes stiff and heavier. Because of this, you should 
know that there is necessarily an afterlife.

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “Though you assert that there is an afterlife by quoting 
an analogy, according to my view, an afterlife is still impossible.” 
Kāśyapa again asked the _brāhmaṇa,_ “Do you have any other reason on 
the basis of which you also know that there is no afterlife?” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied: 
I had a relation who became ill, [and when his illness] became critical 
I visited him and spoke with him. When I helped him lie down on his 
right side, the movement of his eyes, his limbs stretching and bending, 
and even his speech was just the same as when he was well. Again, when 
I helped him turn onto his left side , the turning and twisting of his body, 
the stretching and bending of his limbs, his eyes’ movement, and even 
his speech were all ordinary. Then he died. Again I had some men turn 
his body over to lay it with the right side down and then back the other 
way, with the left side down. I observed [the body] carefully but it did 
not stretch or bend, there was no eye movement, and there was no speech. 
Because of this, I know that there is necessarily no afterlife. 
Kāśyapa said again to the _brāhmaṇa_ : 
Many wise people acquire their wisdom by way of analogy. I shall 
now give another analogy to help you understand. Once there was a 
country where the sound of the conch shell was never heard. At that 
time a skillful conch horn player reached that country and, entering a 
[border] village, he blew the conch horn three times and then set the 
conch shell on the ground. Having heard the sound, the villagers, men 
and women, were all surprised and asked among themselves, “What 
was that sound? It was both soft and pleasant and yet thoroughly clear!” 
The man pointed at the conch shell on the ground and said, “It was the 
sound of this thing.” Then the village people touched the shell with 
their hands, saying, ‘O you, make a sound, make a sound!” The shell 
did not make any sound at all. The owner of the conch shell picked it 
up and blew it three times, then set it back down on the ground. The 
villagers said, “The beautiful sound we heard was not because of this 
shell’s power. It is due to the hands that support it, the mouth that blows 
air into it, and the air blown through it that it thereby makes a sound.”

```
Sutra 7: Pāyāsi’s Dialogue
```

A human being is also like this. If he has a span of life still to live 
and posesses consciousness, and is breathing in and breathing out, he 
should be able to stretch or bend his body, look at things by moving 
his eyes, and speak. On the other hand, when his life span is exhausted 
and his consciousness is gone, neither breathing in nor breathing out, 
he can neither stretch nor bend his body, nor move his eyes, nor speak. 
Kāśyapa thus said to the _brāhmaṇa,_ “You should abandon your wrong 
view. You should not prolong your suffering and bring yourself distress.” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “I cannot abandon my theory, because from the 
time of my birth I have continued to intone and repeat it for a long time. Why 
should I now abandon it?” 
Kāśyapa said: 
Many wise people acquire their wisdom by way of analogy. I will now 
give another analogy to help you understand. Once in the immemorial 
past there was a country in a frontier region that had been mostly 
deserted by people. There were two friends in that country; one was 
called “Wise” and the other was called “Fool.” They said to each other, 
“I am your friend; I will go out of the city with you and we shall seek 
our fortune together.” Thus they traveled together. They came to an 
open space [in a village] and saw a heap of hemp that had been thrown 
away. Wise talked to Fool and they decided that they would both take 
the hemp. Carrying packs of hemp on their backs, they passed the next 
village and saw another pile of discarded hemp thread. Wise said, “This 
hemp thread is well made, lightweight and of fine texture. We should 
pick it up.” The other fellow, however, said, “I am already carrying a 
load of hemp, bound tightly and fixed into a pack; I cannot throw it 
away.” The wise one at once threw away his load of hemp and picked 
up the hemp thread as his new load. 
Again both proceeded on their way and they next found a pile of 
hemp cloth. The wise one said, “This hemp cloth is well made, light- 
weight and of fine texture. We should pick it up.” The other fellow, 
however, said, “I am already carrying a load of hemp bound tightly 
and fixed into a pack; I cannot throw it away.” Thus, the wise one threw 
down his load of hemp thread and picked up a new load of hemp cloth.

```

```
Again they proceeded onward and then found a pile of cotton cloth.
The wise one said, “Cotton cloth is costly, and this cloth is well made,
lightweight, and of fine texture. We should pick it up.” The other fellow
said, “I am already carrying a load of hemp bound tightly and fixed
into a pack; I carried it for a long distance, so I cannot throw it away.”
Thus, only the wise one discarded his hemp cloth and picked up the
new load of cotton cloth. They proceeded in this manner, coming upon
a pile of cotton thread, next a pile of white cotton blankets, then a pile
of copper, silver, and finally gold.
“The wise one said, “If there is no gold, we should pick up silver;
if no silver, we should pick copper, and so forth; we should pick up
hemp thread, and if there is no hemp thread, as the last choice, we
should pick up the hemp material. This village is located above a pile
of amassed gold treasure. You should throw away the hemp. I too will
throw away my silver. Both of us should pick up this gold and carry
it on our backs on our return.” The other fellow, however, said, “I am
already carrying a load of hemp, bound tightly and fixed into a pack;
I cannot throw it away. If you wish to pick up the gold, go ahead.” The
wise one threw away his silver, picked up the gold, and carried it on
the return home. The wise one’s relatives, having seen the gold treasure
he was carrying, were delighted and welcomed his return. The wise
one who carried a load of gold was also delighted to see his relatives
and to be welcomed on his return. On the other hand, the relatives of
the foolish man who returned with a load of hemp were not pleased,
nor did they come out to welcome him back. Thus, the one who had
carried the hemp felt even more regret and distress.
O brāhmaṇa, you should now abandon your obstinate insistence
and wrong view. Do not increase your suffering for such a long time.
Do not be the foolish man who carried the hemp material, whose obsti-
nate nature was firm to the extent that he did not pick up the gold but
continued to carry the hemp material all the way back. He wasted his
energy for nothing, his relations were displeased, and his poverty per-
sisted for a long time, thus increasing his distress and suffering.
The brāhmaṇa said:
```

45c

Sutra 7: Pāyāsi’s Dialogue
```

```
I cannot abandon this view of mine after all, because I have been teach-
ing others from this point of view. When the kings of all the other
regions hear my name, without exception, they know me as the one
whose view of life is that there is no afterlife.
```

Again Kāśyapa said:

```
Many wise people acquire their wisdom by way of analogy. I shall
now quote another analogy to help you understand. Once in the imme-
morial past there was a country in a frontier region that had been
mostly deserted by the people. A group of merchants, driving a thou-
sand carriages, were traveling through the region, but they did not
have enough water and grain, firewood, and grass. The leader of the
merchants thought to himself, “Since we have too many accompanying
members, and we do not have sufficient water or grain, firewood, or
grass, we shall divide the caravan into two parts.” The first caravan
departed as the advance party. The leader of this party saw a huge,
tough-looking man, red-eyed, dark-faced, his body smeared witth
mud, approaching from the far distance. The leader asked him, “From
where have you come?” The man replied, “I have come from the last
village, where you are heading.” Again the leader asked, “Is there
adequate water, grain, firewood, and grass available in that village?”
The man replied, “The place I came from had plenty of water, grain,
firewood, and grass. There is no scarcity. During my journey there
was a heavy rainstorm and the area should be abundant with water as
well as firewood and grass.” He also told the merchant, “If you are
hauling grain and grass in your carriages you should discard all of it.
Since everything is plentiful where you are going, why should you
travel with heavy carriages?”
The leader of the advance party then said to the merchants in the
caravan, “I saw a man who approached from the direction in which
we are going. I asked this man, who had red eyes, a dark face, and a
mud-smeared body, ‘Where have you come from?’ The man replied,
‘I have come from the last village, where you are going on your path.’
Again I asked him, ‘Is there enough water, grain, firewood, and grass
```

```

```
available in that place?’ He replied, ‘Everything is plentiful there.’
He also said to me, ‘A while ago, I encountered a rainstorm on my
way and the area should be abundant with water as well as firewood
and grass.’ In addition, he further told me, ‘If you are carrying grain
and grass in the carriages you should discard it all. Since everything
is plentiful where you are going, why should you drive heavy car-
riages?’ You should discard all of the grain and grass here, and we
will travel through with lightened carriages.” Proceeding onward,
they did not see any water or grass for a whole day, a second day, a
third, and so forth, until a seventh day had passed. The merchants
became trapped in a desert marsh, or quicksand, and they were
devoured by evil spirits.
Later on, the second party also departed, continuing their journey.
The leader of this caravan also saw a man approaching from the direc-
tion in which they were headed. He was red-eyed, dark-faced, and had
a mud-smeared body. The merchant leader asked him, “Where have
you come from?” The man replied, “I have come from the last village,
where you are going.” Again I asked him, “Is there enough water, grain,
firewood, and grass available in that village?” He replied, “Everything
is plentiful there.” He also said, “A while ago I encountered a rainstorm
on my way and the area should be abundant with water as well as fire-
wood and grass.” Moreover, he told me, “If you are carrying grain and
grass in the carriages you should discard it all here. Since everything
is plentiful there, why should you drive heavy carriages?”’
Then the merchant leader said to his caravan members, “I have seen
a traveling man who told me ‘If you are carrying grain and grass in
the carriages you should throw all of it away. Since everything is plen-
tiful where you are heading, why should you drive heavy carriages?’
The merchant leader, however, instead advised the members of the
caravan, “Refrain from discarding the grain and grass. Only when a
new supply has been obtained should you throw out the old stuff,
because by replacing old with new continuously we may be able to
cross this wilderness.”
Thus, the second caravan went on, driving heavily laden carriages.
They did not see water or grass for an entire day, a second day, a third,
```

```
and so forth, until a seventh day had passed. On the way they saw scat-
tered all over the ground the skeletons of many people who had been
devoured by evil spirits.
O brāhmaṇa , that red-eyed, dark-faced man was a cannibal demon.
Those who follow your teaching will receive suffering for a long time
to come, just like the victims of that demon. The merchants of the
advance party, lacking wisdom, followed the words of the [foolish]
leader and perished. O brāhmaṇa , if they had instead heeded the words
given through the exertion and insight of those śramaṇa s and brāh-
maṇa s and followed their teaching, they would have been safe. Just
like the leader of the second caravan, if one is endowed with wisdom
he can escape from crisis or danger. O brāhmaṇa , you should abandon
your wrong view now. You must not increase the suffering and agony
of a long night.
```

The _brāhmaṇa_ replied:

```
I cannot abandon my point of view after all. Even if someone comes
to reprimand me, this only creates indignation on my part. I cannot
abandon my view.
```

Kāśyapa again said:

```
Many wise people acquire their wisdom by way of analogy. I will give
another analogy to help you understand. Once in the immemorial past
there was a country in a frontier region where the land had been mostly
deserted by people. There was a man who was engaged in raising pigs.
He visited another village and found dried cow dung in an open public
space. At once he thought to himself, “Here is plenty of cow dung.
Since my pigs are starving, I should wrap this dung in grass and carry
it on my head.” At once, he collected grass, wrapped up the cow dung,
and loaded it onto his head. On the way back, however, he encountered
heavy rain and the dung melted, running down his body, down to his
heels. Seeing him like that, people regarded him as insane, saying,
“Smeared with dung, smelling hideous, it would be terrible to carry
such a load on one’s head even on a sunny day, how much more so the
impossibility of carrying such a load on one’s head on a rainy day like

this!” Infuriated, the man spoke angry words at them: “You are stupid,
because you don’t know how hungry my pigs are. If you knew, you
wouldn’t laugh at me.”
O brāhmaṇa , you should abandon your wrong view. You should
not invite protracted suffering by upholding your delusion. It is like
the foolish man who carries cow dung on his head. Even when people
gave him warning he became angry at them instead, pointing to their
ignorance!
The brāhmaṇa said to Kāśyapa:
You people (i.e., śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s) insist on saying that if one
does good he will be born in heaven, and in that case his afterlife will
be better than the present life. If this is so, you should all commit suicide
with a knife, or swallow poison, or bind your bodies and throw your-
selves from a cliff. But you seem to be desirous of life, unable to commit
suicide. This means that you know that the afterlife is not better than
this life.
Kāśyapa continued:
Many wise people acquire their wisdom by way of analogy. I will now
give another analogy to help you understand. There once lived a brāh-
maṇa in Śvetavyā village. He was an established and erudite man, one
hundred twenty years of age, and had two wives. One of his wives had
a son, while the other had become pregnant for the first time. The brāh-
maṇa passed away soon after. The first wife’s child said to the second
wife, “My father’s wealth should be given to me in its entirety; none
should be spared for you.” The second wife said, “You should wait
until my baby comes. If it is a boy, the wealth should be divided, and
if a baby girl is born I will remarry to obtain wealth for her.” The boy,
however, politely asked her the same thing repeatedly, and the woman
replied in the same way as before. The child insisted on asking her for
the same thing. The woman then cut open her own body in order to
see if her baby was a boy or a girl.
Kāśyapa said to the brāhmaṇa :
```

46b

```
Sutra 7: Pāyāsi’s Dialogue
```

```
The mother killed herself and [in doing so] she killed her fetus as well.
O brāhmaṇa , your suggestion implies a similar case. By killing yourself
you would also kill others as well. If the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s
who are well endowed in exertion, good discipline, and the virtue of
precepts abide in this world for a long time it will be of greater benefit
to this world, since the gods and human beings will thereby be secured
under their guidance.
I will give a final analogy to help you understand what disasters
may be incurred by holding wrong views. Once there were two gamblers
who played dice in the village of Śvetavyā. When the two competed,
one of them won; the other who did not do well said to the winner, “Let
us stop playing today. Tomorrow we shall try again to see who is more
skillful.” The man who did not do well returned home and applied
poison to the dice and dried them in the sun. The next day, taking the
dice with him, he visited the house of the other fellow who had won
the day before and said to him, “Let us compete again to see who is
more skillful.” To begin the game, the man who did not do well gave
the dice to the winner who, on receiving them, licked them to moisten
them before casting. Then the man who had poisoned the dice picked
them up and moistened them by licking them. The poison began to work
in him faster, causing his body to tremble. The one who had poisoned
the dice cursed at the other in verse:
I applied poison to the dice.
You licked them without knowing it.
Playing for a short time,
Since you have already touched them,
You will soon know its effect.
```

Kāśyapa said to the _brāhmaṇa_ :

```
You should abandon your wrong view. Do not increase the poison of
suffering by prolonging your delusion. You are like that dice player
who ingested the poison without knowing it.
```

At that time the _brāhmaṇa_ said to Kāśyapa:

```
46c
```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

Venerable, when you gave the analogy of the moon, I already under- 
stood it. That I tried to refute your exhortation back and forth has been 
to examine your rhetorical skill and insight, thereby causing the arising 
of firm belief in myself. Now I believe what you have said, O Kāśyapa, 
and I wish for you to be my refuge. 
Kāśyapa said, “Do not make me your refuge. You should take the Highest 
and Most Venerable One, who is also my own refuge, as your refuge.” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “I do not know where the Highest and Most Venerable 
One to whom you refer is at this time.” 
Kāśyapa replied, “My master, the World-honored One, entered final nirvana 
not long ago.” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ said: 
If the World-honored One was still alive I would not hesitate, whether 
close or distant, to visit him directly and venerate him as my refuge. 
Unfortunately, as I have now heard, the Tathāgata has entered cessation. 
I will now uphold the Buddha who entered nirvana, the Dharma, and 
the Sangha as my refuge. O Kāśyapa, please permit me to become a 
lay devotee of the right Dharma. From now until the end of my life I 
will uphold the five precepts: abstention from killing life, from stealing, 
from sexual misconduct, from speaking falsehoods, and from ingesting 
intoxicants. I will now also offer general charity to all beings. 
Kāśyapa said to him: 
If you kill sentient beings, beat young boys, and then offer charity, this 
is not pure and genuine charity. Just as thorny plants prevail in a poor 
land with rocks and shallow soil, there will be no good harvest even 
if you were to sow seeds or plant trees there. If you kill animals, beat 
young boys, and offer charity to the sangha while holding a wrong 
view, neither is this a pure and genuine charity. If, however, you offer 
general charity, neither killing living beings nor beating children with 
sticks, but make offerings to the sangha with delight, then there will 
be a great reward, just as one obtains real fruit by sowing seeds or 
planting trees in good soil, as they wish.

```
Sutra 7: Pāyāsi’s Dialogue
```

The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “O Kāśyapa, from now on, I will continue to make 
offerings to the sangha at all times without fail.” 
At that time there was a young _brāhmaṇa_ , Mānava by name, standing 
behind Pāyāsi. Pāyāsi, looking back at him, said, “I wish to offer universal 
charity. Please organize an event to offer charity on my behalf.” Having heard 
Pāyāsi’s instruction, the young _brāhmaṇa_ organized and completed the event 
of universal charity, and then announced, “May Pāyāsi not be rewarded with 
any fortune in this life as well as in the hereafter.” 
Pāyāsi was informed that when the event of offering charity had been 
completed the young _brāhmaṇa_ had said, “May Pāyāsi not be rewarded with 
any fortune in this life as well as in the hereafter.” Pāyāsi questioned the 
man, “Did you really say such words?” He replied:

Yes, sir. I did indeed make such a wish, sir, because the food prepared 
for the charity event was of poor quality, and this bad-tasting food was 
what was offered to the sangha. If the same food were presented before 
your lordship you would not even touch it, much less partake of it. 
What was provided is not the kind of food with which one could be 
pleased or enjoy eating. How could anyone who offers such poor food 
acquire a good reward in the afterlife, sir? Moreover, your lordship 
offered robes to the sangha but the clothes were made of hemp. If such 
clothing were shown to your lordship you would have kicked them 
away without even touching them, much less wearing them. What has 
been offered is not the kind of clothing with which one may be pleased 
or enjoy wearing. How could anyone who offers such poor clothing 
acquire a good reward in the afterlife, sir? 
Pāyāsi then said to the young _brāhmaṇa_ , “From now on, please prepare 
and offer to the sangha the same kinds of food I eat and clothing of similar 
quality to what I wear.” 
Thus instructed, the young _brāhmaṇa_ then made offerings to the sangha 
of exactly the same quality of food and clothing as those enjoyed by Pāyāsi. 
Thus, the _brāhmaṇa,_ on the basis of his genuine offering, was born in Vimāna 
Heaven after his body dissolved and his life ended. The _brāhmaṇa_ youth 
who had organized the event of universal charity was born in Trāyastriṃśa 
Heaven upon the dissolution of his body and the end of his life.

At that time, having listened to this teaching, the _brāhmaṇa_ Pāyāsi, the 
young _brāhmaṇa_ , as well as the householders of Śvetavyā village, all rejoiced 
and respectfully received it and carried it out.

### Sutra 8

### Sandhāna

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 25: Udumbarika-

#### Sīhanāda Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was sojourning at the Saptaparṇa 
Cave on Vulture Peak in the city of Rājagṛha, together with one thousand 
two hundred and fifty disciples. There was a householder, Sandhāna by name, 
in that city, who enjoyed making an excursion every day to go out of the city 
and visit the Buddha. One such day, when the householder looked up at the 
sun’s position, he quietly thought to himself:

Now would not be a proper time for me to visit the Buddha. By this 
time, his holiness is surely retired in a secluded room for his daily con- 
templation and concentration. The disciple _bhikṣu_ s should also be 
engaged in their practice of quiet meditation. I should instead visit 
Queen Udumbarikā’s pleasure garden set aside for _brāhmaṇa_ wanderers. 
When the proper time comes, I will visit the World-honored One and 
greet him with devotion and respect, and in addition also visit the 
_bhikṣu_ s to greet them with respect. 
At that time, a _brāhmaṇa_ , Nyagrodha by name, was staying in that grove 
together with five hundred _brāhmaṇa_ ascetics. The _brāhmaṇa_ ascetics had 
gathered there and were involved in massive arguments with loud voices on 
various nonreligious topics, thus passing many hours, all day long. Some 
argued about matters of state, while others argued about battles and weapons, 
still others on matters of justice and peace between the states, or on matters 
of ministers and people, or on such topics as carriages, horses, and excursions 
to groves and forests, or seating, clothing, food and drink, or about women, 
or about mountains, oceans, and the carapace of a turtle. They thus spent the 
whole day doing nothing but talking about such nonreligious matters. 
The _brāhmaṇa_ Nyagrodha saw from afar the householder Sandhāna 
approaching them and at once ordered the members of the assembly to be

quiet, saying, “The lay disciple of the _śramaṇa_ Gautama now coming from 
outside is the foremost among Gautama’s lay devotees. He surely will come 
here, you should all quiet down.” Then all the _brāhmaṇa_ s stopped talking. 
The householder Sandhāna reached the place of the _brāhmaṇa_ Nyagrodha, 
and, after greeting him, sat to one side and said to him:

My master, the World-honored One, always enjoys leisure and quietude 
and does not like noisy confusion like this. He does not act in the way 
that you do, putting yourself among your disciples who are arguing in 
loud voices on various nonreligious topics. 
The _brāhmaṇa_ responded to the householder: 
_Śramaṇa_ Gautama has never debated with others. [So] how can the 
public know that the _śramaṇa_ is [really] in possession of great insight? 
Your teacher prefers to stay alone in a secluded place, just like a one- 
eyed cow that roams alone and onesidedly turns [in a circle] only the 
part of the grass field that comes into its vision. Your teacher Gautama 
is like that cow, because he likes to stay alone in an isolated place 
where no other person is around. If your teacher happens to come here, 
I shall call him “One-eyed cow.” He always claims that he has great 
insight. [But] with a single word I will surely cause him to be at a loss 
and pursue him until he surrenders like a turtle withdrawn into its cara- 
pace. I say that with a single shot of an arrow it would be no trouble 
to cause him to be at a loss for a way out. 
At that time, the World-honored One was alone in his meditation room 
and, he heard through his supernormal hearing what the _brāhmaṇa_ told the 
householder. He at once came out of the Saptaparṇa Cave and traveled to 
the Udumbarikā Grove. The _brāhmaṇa_ saw the Buddha from a distance 
approaching the Udumbarikā Grove. He ordered his disciples:

```
All of you, be silent. The śramaṇa Gautama seems to be coming here.
Neither pay respect to him by standing up, nor venerate him, nor invite
him to take a seat. A separate seat [apart from us] can be offered, and
as soon as he sits down, you should question him: “O śramaṇa Gau-
tama, from the beginning of your career, for what kind of religion have
```

```
Sutra 8: Sandhāna
```

you originally taught your disciples so that they may acquire the state 
of comfort and tranquility and practice moral and religious austerity?” 
The Buddha eventually reached the grove. Then, unintentionally, the _brāh- 
maṇa_ himself stood up, received the World-honored One, and uttered the 
following words of welcome:

O Gautama, welcome. O _śramaṇa_ , welcome. I have seen you for a 
long time. For what purpose have you come here, sir? Please take a 
seat here at the front. 
The World-honored One at once sat on the seat as invited, and laughed 
cheerfully. He quietly thought to himself:

These foolish men cannot even uphold their [intended] actions on their 
own terms. Despite planning a cool reception for me, they have behaved 
contrary to their intent. It is because, before the Buddha’s supernormal 
power, their minds of ill intent have spontaneously been broken. 
The householder Sandhāna venerated the Buddha by bowing to his feet 
and then sat to one side. The _brāhmaṇa_ Nyagrodha greeted the Buddha with 
a bow, then sat on the other side and asked him:

```
O śramaṇa Gautama, from the beginning of your career, upon what
religious teaching have you originally instructed your disciples and
trained them to acquire the state of comfort and tranquility and to gen-
uinely practice moral and religious austerity?
The World-honored One responded to the brāhmaṇa:
Please stop for a moment, O brāhmaṇa. My religious teaching is pro-
found and vast. From the beginning of my career I have guided my
disciples on the basis of this teaching and trained them to acquire the
state of comfort and tranquility and to genuinely practice moral and
religious austerity. It cannot be compared with what you are doing.
He continued:
What exactly causes your teacher as well as your disciples (i.e., the

tradition as a whole) to practice the disciplines of the path to comprise 
purity as well as impurity? I can explain them exhaustively. 
Then all five hundred disciples of the _brāhmaṇa_ clamored in raising their 
voices, saying:

O _śramaṇa_ Gautama, you boast of your greatness and supernormal 
power, to the extent that when you are asked about your teaching, you 
set aside [the queston] and instead challenge us to explain our teaching! 
The _brāhmaṇa_ Nyagrodha then said to the Buddha, “Very well, Gautama, 
please analyze and explain what you mean by that.” 
The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa,_ “Listen attentively. I shall explain it 
for you.” The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “Delighted, sir. I am ready [to listen], sir.” 
The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa:_

```
What you practice is entirely base and vulgar. You remove all your
clothing and go about naked, covering your front with your hands. You
accept food neither from a jug or from a serving vessel, nor do you
accept food placed inside the threshold, food placed between two
people, food placed between two sticks, food placed between two
plates, or food placed near people who are eating; nor will you accept
food from a pregnant woman or from a house where there is a dog, or
from a house with swarming flies; nor do you accept food for which
you have been invited or food from a family with whom another ascetic
is acquainted; nor do you accept fish, meat, intoxicants, or anything
that has been placed between two cooking vessels (e.g., mortar and
pestle). You accept meals and a drinks, and so on, as many as up to
seven portions. But when you receive almsfood or helpings you do not
go beyond a seventh portion. You partake either one meal a day or a
meal every two days or three days, or four, five, or six days, or every
seven days. Or else you partake of fruit and potherbs, you drink rice-
water froth, eat sesame seeds or hemp grains, or partake of wild rice,
cow dung, or antelope dung. Or you eat plant roots, branches, and
leaves, or fruit that has fallen to the ground.
You wear any kind of poor-quality clothing, or clothes made of kuśa
grass fiber, or bark garments, or you cover your body with grass, or
```

```
Sutra 8: Sandhāna
```

you wear an antelope hide. You let your hair grow, or cover your body 
with a net made of hair, or you wear clothing taken from a corpse. 
Some of you keep your arms lifted at all times, or never sit on a couch 
or chair but only in a squatting position. Even if you shave your head 
you keep both moustache and beard. You lay on a bed of thorns or on 
a floor covered with plant husks, or you lay down naked in cow dung, 
or you bathe three times a day or three times during the night. You 
mortify your body with extreme physical pain and suffering. How 
indeed, O Nyagrodha, are these forms of practice regarded as genuine, 
pure disciplines? 
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “These disciplines are pure and genuine and are 
not contrary, sir.” 
The Buddha sid to the _brāhmaṇa,_ “Though you claim that these forms of 
practice are pure and genuine disciplines, I will explain to you why they are 
morally defiled.” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “Very well, Gautama, explain why our forms of 
practice are morally impure and defiled. I wish to know about it.” 
The Buddha continued: 
The ascetics engaged in self-mortifying forms of practice invariably 
entertain an expectation in their mind, thinking, “My ascetic practice 
should persuade people to make offerings with respect and admiration 
[for my austerities].” This expectation is by nature a moral defilement. 
Having received an offering, satisfied and reinforced, these extreme 
ascetics are firmly attached to their extreme forms of practice, neither 
knowing how it is important to distance oneself from worldly matters, 
nor knowing what the essential path of salvation is. This wrong orien- 
tation is a moral defilement. 
If they see anyone near them or approaching them from a distance, 
these extreme ascetics invariably assume their [arduous] practice of 
meditation, but in the absence of other people they resume their undis- 
ciplined behavior, idly sitting or lying about according to their incli- 
nation. This is a moral defilement. 
Even when they hear a precise exposition of their doctrine by others, 
they do not acknowledge that it is correct. This is a moral defilement.

```
When a proper question about their doctrine is presented to them,
these extreme ascetics keep their mouths shut and do not answer or
explain it. This is a moral defilement.
When they see people making offerings for the śramaṇa s and brāh-
maṇa s, these extreme ascetics accuse the donors to prevent their acts
of charity. This is a moral defilement.
When they see the śramaṇa s and brāhmaṇa s partake of various
seed items that regrow as food (i.e., rice grains), these extreme ascetics
accuse them. This is a moral defilement.
Even when they receive excess food that is not suitable for them,
these ascetics do not offer it to others. When they obtain food that is
suitable for them they greedily partake of it all by themselves, neither
seeing their own fault of greediness nor knowing that freedom from
attachment is essential to salvation. This is a moral defilement.
These extreme ascetics praise their own goodness (regarding their
acts of self-mortification), and discredit the practices of other schools.
This is a moral defilement.
These extreme ascetics commit some of these wrongdoings: injuring
life, taking what is not given, engaging in sexual misconduct, engaging
in deceptive speech, verbal abuse, using false words, flattery, greediness,
jealousy, and wrong views. This is a moral defilement.
These extreme ascetics take delight in idleness and forgetfulness
of the practice of meditation, acquiring no insight, just like birds and
animals. This is a moral defilement.
These extreme ascetics project a lofty air of self-conceit and arro-
gance. This is a moral defilement.
These extreme ascetics not only have neither the virtue of faithful-
ness, nor of repeated practice, nor of genuine precepts, but they also
do not seriously listen to others’ admonitions. As they always associate
with wrong kinds of people, they continue to do wrong things without
ever despising their actions. This is a moral defilement.
These extreme ascetics are prone to anger and resentment and they
contemplate treacherous schemes against others, trying to show off
their views and finding fault with others. They always entertain wrong
opinions and agree with one-sided views. This is a moral defilement.
```

Sutra 8: Sandhāna

How then, Nyagrodha, can these manners of practice be said to be 
morally free of blemish? 
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “These are morally defiled and cannot be said to 
be pure and genuine [practices], sir.” 
The Buddha continued, “Now, in reference to each of those morally defiled 
forms of practice, I shall explain what the morally pure and genuine nature is.” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ replied, “Please explain them one by one, sir.” 
The Buddha continued: 
These ascetics should cherish no expectation in their minds and aban- 
don the thought, “My practice should bring me offerings, respect, and 
admiration.” This nonanticipatory practice is free from moral defile- 
ment. 
After receiving offerings, these ascetics should not greedily attach 
themselves to extreme forms of practice.They should become aware 
of the importance of distancing themselves from worldly matters, 
knowing what the essential path of salvation is. This right orientation 
is free from moral defilement. 
These ascetics should maintain regularity in the practice of medi- 
tation, whether or not other people are present or absent. This form of 
discipline is free from moral defilement. 
These ascetics should be delighted when followers of other schools 
have a correct understanding of their doctrines, and they should readily 
acknowledge this. This discipline is free from moral defilement. 
These ascetics should be delighted when an appropriate question 
is presented and they should openly answer and explain it. This disci- 
pline is free from moral defilement. 
Seeing others offering charity to the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s, 
these ascetics should rejoice in the moral and religious advancement 
expressed in such acts of charity, instead of discouraging the donors. 
This discipline is free from moral defilement. 
Seeing the _śramaṇa_ s and _brāhmaṇa_ s who partake of various seed 
items that regrow as food, these ascetics should not accuse them. This 
discipline is free from moral defilement.

These ascetics should neither be stingy with excess food that is not
suitable for them, nor should they be overwhelmed by greedy attach-
ment when they receive suitable food, thus reflecting upon their own
faults and knowing the essential path to salvation. This discipline is
free from moral defilement.
These ascetics should not boast of their scrupulousness in practices
of self-mortification, nor should they despise the practices of other
schools. This discipline is free from moral defilement.
These ascetics should not commit any of the ten kinds of wrongdoing:
injuring life, taking what is not given, engaging in sexual misconduct,
deceptive speech, verbal abuse, false words, flattery, greediness, jealousy,
and wrong views. This discipline is free from moral defilement.
These ascetics should not be forgetful but diligently engage in the
practice of meditation and acquire many levels of insight, not regressing
to the state of ignorance, like animals. This discipline is free from
moral defilement.
These ascetics should refrain from projecting a lofty air of self-con-
ceit and arrogance. This discipline is free from moral defilement.
These ascetics should always enhance the virtues of faithfulness, con-
tinuous practice, and genuine precepts; they should listen seriously to
others’ admonitions, and by associating always with good people never
cease to do good things. This discipline is free from moral defilement.
These ascetics should neither cherish anger and resentment, nor
contemplate treacherous schemes against others, nor show off their
own achievements while trying to find fault in others, nor should they
entertain wrong opinions along with one-sided views or prejudices.
This discipline is free from moral defilement.
Brāhmaṇa , are these forms of practice to be regarded as the way to
acquire morally blameless practice?
The brāhmaṇa replied, “Yes, these should be regarded as the way to
acquire morally blameless practice, sir.” He further asked the Buddha, “If
anyone upholds this kind of ascetic practice, is he regarded to have achieved
the utmost essence of the practice, sir?”
The Buddha replied, “No, not yet. This is only the beginning, only the
outer bark portion of a tree.”

Sutra 8: Sandhāna

The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “May I request you to explain the progressive stages 
of restraint in the ascetic practice in analogy with a tree.” 
The Buddha said, “Listen carefully. I shall explain it to you.” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “Yes, sir. I am ready.” 
The Buddha continued: 
O _brāhmaṇa_ , each of these ascetics does not himself commit murder 
nor persuade others to do so; neither does he himself commit theft nor 
persuade others to do so; neither does he himself commit sexual mis- 
conduct nor persuade others to do so; neither does he himself speak 
falsehoods nor persuade others to do so. Instead he permeates friendly 
love infinitely in one quarter of the world, then likewise in the remaining 
three quarters. Thus he extends his immeasurable mind of benevolence 
universally in all directions, undivided and not bound to limitation. 
Without enmity, his mind of benevolence permeates throughout the 
human world, and so do his immeasurable mind of compassion, his 
immeasurable mind of sympathetic joy, and his immeasurable mind 
of equanimity [pervade] in a similar manner throughout the human 
world. These are regarded as the progressive stages of restraint in the 
tree analogy of ascetic practice. 
The _brāhmaṇa_ said to the Buddha, “Please explain the essence of ascetic 
practice, sir.” 
The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa,_ “Listen attentively. I shall explain it 
to you.” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “Yes, World-honored One, I am ready, sir.” 
The Buddha continued: 
Each of these ascetics neither himself commits murder nor persuade 
another to do so; neither does he himself commit theft nor persuade 
others to do so; neither does he himself commit sexual misconduct nor

Thus he extends his immeasurable mind of benevolence universally in

so do his immeasurable minds of compassion, of sympathetic joy, and 
of equanimity [pervade] in a similar manner throughout the human world. 
This ascetic becomes aware of things that happened since imme- 
morial past eons, and entirely knows all those events during his initial 
life, second life, and so forth, up to his innumerable positions in the 
life cycle. Throughout those periods from the beginning to the end of 
many eons he himself knows through direct perception: “I was once 
born in such-and-such a class status, had such-and-such name, ate 
meals consisting of such-and-such food, lived so-and-so many years 
of age, and experienced such-and-such happiness and suffering. I was 
reborn from that state to this one, then reborn from that to this, and in 
this manner I recollect exhaustively all the things that happened through- 
out immeasurable numbers of eons.” 
This, O _brāhmaṇa_ , is the essential core of ascetic practice that is 
imperishable. 
The _brāhmaṇa_ spoke to the Buddha, “What is the primary of ascetic prac- 
tice, sir?” 
The Buddha replied, “O _brāhmaṇa_ , listen attentively. I shall explain it to 
you.” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ said, “Yes, World-honored One, I am ready, sir.” 
The Buddha continued: 
Each of these ascetics neither himself commits murder nor does he per- 
suade another to do so; neither himself commits theft nor persuade 
others to do so; neither himself commits sexual misconduct nor persuades 
others to do so, neither himself speaks falsehoods nor persuades others 
to do so. Instead he permeates friendly love infinitely in one quarter of 
the world, then likewise in the remaining three quarters. Thus he extends 
his immeasurable mind of benevolence universally in all directions, 
undivided and not bound to limitation. Without enmity, his mind of 
benevolence permeates throughout the human world, and so do his 
immeasurable minds of compassion, of sympathetic joy and of equa- 
nimity [pervade] in a similar manner throughout the human world.

immemorial past eons, and entirely knows all those events during his

initial life, second life, and so forth, up to his innumerable positions 
in the life cycle, throughout the periods from the beginning to the end 
of many eons. He also knows through direct perception: “I was once 
born in such-and-such class status, had such-and-such family name, 
ate meals consisting of such-and-such food, lived to so-and-so many 
years of age, and experienced such-and-such happiness and suffering. 
I was reborn from that state to this one, and reborn from that to this, 
and in this manner I recollect exhaustively all the things that happened 
throughout immeasurable numbers of eons.” 
With his pure and genuine heavenly vision he exhaustively perceives 
and knows the kinds of sentient beings as passing away here and being 
reborn there, as endowed with good complexions, handsome or ugly, 
with resulting courses of life due to their good or bad deeds, wherever 
they fall due to their deeds. Also he knows how some of those sentient 
beings who committed wrong physical, verbal, and mental deeds, speak- 
ing slanderous remarks against the wise and holy and believing in per- 
verse, wrong views, fell into the three evil courses of life when their 
bodies dissolved and their lives ended. He also knows how other sentient 
beings who have accumulated good physical, verbal, and mental deeds, 
who speak no evil against the wise and holy and hold the right view, 
are born among heavenly gods when their bodies dissolved and their 
lives ended. Thus, each practitioner, endowed with pure and genuine 
heavenly vision, perceives [the destinies or fates of] sentient beings, 
wherever they fall according to their deeds, and there is nothing he 
cannot see. This is the primary essence of ascetic practice. 
The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa_ : 
In this foremost primary type of ascetic practice, there is again a superior 
one, on the basis of which I always teach my disciples ( _śrāvaka_ s). Their 
discipline of austerity is based on this superior type of ascetic practice. 
At that moment all of the five hundred disciples of the _brāhmaṇa_ raised 
their voices, saying to each other, “Now the World-honored One seems to 
be the highest, foremost venerable, with whom even our teacher cannot be 
equaled.”

```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

Then the householder Sandhāna said to the _brāhmaṇa:_ 
You said to me before, “If Gautama comes here, I will call him ‘One- 
eyed Cow.’ Now that the World-honored One is here, why don’t you call 
him [by that name]? Also, you said before, “I surely will cause him to 
be at a loss with a single word, and pursue him until he surrenders like 
a turtle withdrawn into its carapace. It will be no trouble for me, with a 
single shot of an arrow I can surely cause him to be at a loss for a way 
out.” Why can you not now, with a single word, cause the Tathāgata to 
be at a loss? 
The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa,_ “Do you remember that you said such 
a thing before?” 
He replied, “I really said so, sir.” 
The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa:_ 
Haven’t you heard from your _brāhmaṇa_ elders that buddhas and tathā- 
gatas reside alone in forest hermitages and enjoy a secluded location, 
just as I enjoy a life of seclusion, quite opposite to your way of living 
in which you enjoy congestion, noisiness, speak of useless matters, 
and thereby pass the hours of the day? 
The _brāhmaṇa_ said: 
Yes, sir. I have heard that the buddhas of the past enjoyed seclusion 
and quietude and lived their solitary lives in forest hermitages, just as 
the World-honored One does. It is certainly not like our way of living 
in which we enjoy congestion and noisiness, speak of useless matters, 
and thus pass the hours of the day, sir. 
The Buddha further said to the _brāhmaṇa:_ 
You should keep the following in your mind: the _śramaṇa_ Gautama 
teaches the doctrine of enlightenment well, has himself accomplished 
self-control and helps others learn self-control, has himself realized 
mental calmness and helps others calm their minds, has himself crossed 
the water to reach the yonder shore and helps others cross to the yonder 
shore, has himself attained liberation of his consciousness and helps

```
Sutra 8: Sandhāna
```

others liberate their consciousnesses, and has himself realized the ulti- 
mate goal of nirvana and helps others realize ultimate nirvana. 
At that moment, the _brāhmaṇa_ rose from his seat, venerated the Buddha 
by bowing to the Buddha’s feet and, holding the Buddha’s feet in his hands, 
he announced his name, saying, “I am a _brāhmaṇa_ , Nyagrodha by name. I 
now venerate the World-honored One by bowing to his feet.” 
The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa,_ “Stop, Nyagrodha. Remain seated, 
and just let your liberated mind pay veneration and respect toward me.” 
The _brāhmaṇa_ , however, completed a second veneration to the Buddha’s 
feet and then returned to his seat. 
The Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa:_ 
You should never say that the Buddha exhorted his doctrine of practice 
for the sake of material gain. You should not think so. If there is any 
material donation for [my teaching] I will give all of it to you as charity. 
The doctrine I have exhorted, subtle and foremost, is set forth for the 
sake of terminating wrong practices and promoting good ones. 
Again he said to the _brāhmaṇa:_ 
You should never say that the Buddha exhorted his doctrine because 
he wished to protect his fame and keep his name as a religious master, 
or because he wished to acquire new converts [from among your dis- 
ciples] and the members of the sangha. You should not think so. All 
of your disciples are yours. The doctrine I have exhorted is set forth 
for the sake of terminating wrong practices and promoting good ones. 
Again he said to the _brāhmaṇa:_ 
You should never say that the Buddha abandoned you in the assembly 
of bad and ignorant people. You should not think so. As far as those 
bad and ignorant members are concerned, you should exclude them 
from your assembly. I have taught only on the essential nature of the 
good practice. 
Again the Buddha said to the _brāhmaṇa:_

```
49b
```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

You should never say that the Buddha has taken these good and genuine 
members away from you. You should not think so. You should carry 
out your practice diligently among those who carry out good practice 
and who are genuine. I have exhorted you on the nature of ascetic prac- 
tice that is good and genuine so as to terminate wrong practices and 
promote good ones. 
At that time, the five hundred disciples of the _brāhmaṇa_ listened eagerly 
and attentively to what the Buddha was teaching. The Evil One Pāpīyān 
thought to himself, “These five hundred disciples of the _brāhmaṇa_ are now 
eagerly and attentively listening to the Buddha’s teaching. I should go and 
disrupt their minds.” Thereupon, the Evil One disrupted the minds of those 
in the assembly. 
At that moment, the Buddha said to Sandhāna: 
While the _brāhmaṇa’_ s five hundred disciples were eagerly and atten- 
tively listening to my teaching, the Evil One Pāpīyān has now disrupted 
their minds. Now I wish to return. You should leave here with me. 
Then the World-honored One touched the householder Sandhāna with his 
right hand, held him within his palm, and flew through space. The householder 
Sandhāna, the _brāhmaṇa_ Nyagrodha, as well as the five hundred _brāhmaṇa_ 
disciples who had heard the Buddha’s exhortation, rejoiced, respectfully received 
the teaching, and carried out what was taught by the Buddha.

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 33: Saṅgīti Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha sojourned in the Mallan country 
accompanied by one thousand two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s. He arrived at 
the mango grove that belonged to Cunda in the city of Pāvā. On the fifteenth 
day of the month, the full moon night, the World-honored One sat in the open 
ground, surrounded by the assembly of _bhikṣu_ s on all sides. The World-hon- 
ored One spent hours of the night teaching the Dharma, and he then said to 
Śāriputra:

Now many disciples have assembled from all quarters and, being dili- 
gent, they are disregarding the hours of sleep. Since I have pain in my 
back and should rest for a while, please conduct the teaching session 
for the sake of these _bhikṣu_ s. 
Śāriputra replied, “Yes, sir. I shall do as instructed.” Then the World-honored 
One folded his outer robe into four layers, spread it on the ground, and lay 
down on his right side, with one foot placed upon the other, like a lion. 
Śāriputra said to the _bhikṣu_ s: 
The head of the Nirgrantha (Jain) school resided in this city of Pāvā, 
and not long ago he passed away. After that, his disciples divided into 
two groups, each of which looked for its own advantage and found 
fault with the other, mutually disdaining and accusing each other as to 
what is right or wrong, arguing, “We know the right thing, whereas 
you do not. You hold a wrong view, whereas we hold the right one.” 
Their words and language are all confused without logical sequence. 
Each party claims that their own statements are regarded as true and 
right, saying, “What we say is superior, while what you said is inferior.” 
Now, I am going to conduct this session of doctrinal discussion. Who- 
ever has questions, please come up and question me.

O bhikṣu s, the countrymen who have been supporting the Nirgrantha
religion are weary of the mutually contesting voices of the [two schools].
This inner conflict seem to show that the religion they proclaim is not
really true and right. Unless a religion is true and genuine, it cannot
be an essential path of deliverance, just as a dilapidated tower with a
crumbling inner structure cannot be repaired only by means of external
reinforcement. Their religion is quite different from the religion taught
to us by the Perfectly Enlightened One. O bhikṣu s, the religious path
that our foremost Venerable Śākyamuni has taught to us is the most
true and genuine, because through practicing it we are able to realize
religious salvation. It is like a new tower that can be easily embellished
with external ornaments. This has been taught by the Perfectly Enlight-
ened One. All of the bhikṣu s should collect the doctrines and disciplines
so as to prevent future disputes and controversies, to consolidate the
practice of austerity for a long time to come, and so that various benefits
derived thereby will increase the well-being of gods and humans.
O bhikṣu s, the Tathāgata taught the singular doctrines of his right
Dharma: (1) All sentient beings subsist on food for maintaining life.
(2) There is another single doctrine that asserts that all sentient beings
exist due to their dispositional forces. The foregoing are the right doc-
trines taught by the Tathāgata. We should collect these doctrines in
memory to prevent dispute or controversy, to consolidate the practice
of austerity for a long time to come, and so that the various benefits
will thereby increase the well-being of gods and humans.
O bhikṣu s, the Tathāgata taught the double doctrines of his right
Dharma: (1) There is a doctrine that explains first, the category of
names; second, the category of forms.
(2) Again there is another double doctrine that explains first, igno-
rance; second, craving for existence.
(3) Again there is another double doctrine that explains first, the
view of existence as eternalism; second, the view of nonexistence as
view of nihilism.
(4) Again there is another double doctrine that explains first, shame-
lessness as to self-reflection; second, shamelessness before others.
```

```
Sutra 9: Numerically Assembled Doctrines
```

(5) Again there is another double doctrine that explains first, shame- 
fulness as to self-reflection; second, shamefulness before others. 
(6) Again there is another double doctrine that explains first, knowl- 
edge of the total eradication of defilement; second, knowledge of the 
nonorigination of the states of existence. 
(7) Again there is another double doctrine that asserts that two causes 
and two conditions give rise to desire and craving: first, pure, subtle 
form, and second, indifference. 
(8) Again there is another double doctrine that asserts that two causes 
and two conditions give rise to hate: first, enmity; second, indifference. 
(9) Again there is another double doctrine that asserts that two causes 
and two conditions give rise to wrong views: first, informed by others; 
second, wrong thought. 
(10) Again there is another double doctrine that asserts that two 
causes and two conditions give rise to right views: first, informed by 
others; second, right thought. 
(12) Again there is another double doctrine that asserts that two 
causes and two conditions give rise first to the realization of deliverance 
with further training, and second to the ultimate realization of deliv- 
erance without further training. 
(13) Again there is another double doctrine that asserts that two 
causes and two conditions give rise first, to the sphere of conditioned 
phenomena; second, to the sphere of the unconditioned. 
O _bhikṣu_ s, these are the right doctrines taught by the Tathāgata. We 
should collect these doctrines [in memory] to prevent disputes and 
controversy, to consolidate the practice of austerity for a long time to 
come, and so that the various benefits derived thereby increase the 
well-being of gods and humans. 
O _bhikṣu_ s, the Tathāgata has taught the [following] triple doctrines 
of his right Dharma: 
(1) A triple doctrine explains three kinds of unfavorable roots: greed, 
hatred, and delusion. 
(2) Again there is another triple doctrine that explains three good 
roots: absence of greed, absence of hatred, and absence of delusion.

(3) Again there is another triple doctrine that explains three kinds

derived from the supernormal power of vision, and knowledge of total

of extraordinary occurrence: magical performance through supernormal

O _bhikṣu_ s, these are the right doctrines taught by the Tathāgata. We 
should collect these doctrines [in memory] so as to prevent disputes 
and controversies, to consolidate the practice of austerity for a long 
time to come, and so that the various benefits derived thereby will 
increase the well-being of gods and humans. 
O _bhikṣu_ s, the Tathāgata taught the fourfold doctrines of his right 
Dharma: 
(1) There is a fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds of ignoble 
verbal actions: speaking falsehoods and engaging in double talk, abusive 
speech, and flattery. 
(2) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds 
of noble actions: abstinence from speaking falsehoods, from double talk, 
from harsh speech, and from flattery. 
(3) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds 
of ignoble speech: the false assertion that one has seen something that 
one has not actually seen, that one has heard something that one has 
not actually heard, that one has been aware though actually one has 
not been aware, and that one has known something though actually 
one has not known. 
(4) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds 
of noble speech: the true assertion that one has seen when one has actually

```

```

```
seen, the true assertion that one has heard something that one has actually
heard, the true assertion that one has been aware when one has actually
been aware, and the true assertion that one has known when one has actu-
ally known.
(5) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds
of food: edible, material food that is either nutritious [and gives strength]
or is exquisite; nutriment that is ingested by tactile contact; nutriment
derived from volition and thought; and nutriment derived from con-
sciousness.
(6) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds
of causal relationships between suffering and happiness: [the causal
relationship between] hard exertion now and an unhappy effect later;
[the causal relationship between] hard exertion now and a happy effect
later; [the causal relationship between] easy exertion now and an
unhappy effect later; and [the causal relationship between] easy exertion
now and a happy effect later.
(7) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds
of grasping or attachment: attachment to desires, attachment to the
self, attachment to the vow of precepts, and attachment to views.
(8) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds
of fetters: the fetter of covetousness, the fetter of malice, the fetter of
the practice and observance of wrong precepts from other schools, and
the fetter of the inclination to assert “Only this is the truth” (i.e., strong
attachment to a particular dogmatic view).
(9) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds
of obstacles:^24 the obstacle of desire, the obstacle of malice, the obstacle
of wrong view, and the obstacle of self-conceit.
(10) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds
of living creatures: creatures born oviparously, creatures born from a
womb, creatures born of moisture, and creatures born through incar-
nation (e.g., gods, ghosts, etc.).
(11) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds
of application of mental awareness. First, when a bhikṣu observes his
inner body (sense faculties) in concentration he should exert himself
with no slackening, being mindful of his observations to keep them in
```

50c

```

```

memory, and thereby remove worldly desires and worries. Second, 
observing his outer body (outer sense stimuli) he should exert himself 
with no slackening, being mindful of his observations to keep them in 
memory, and thereby remove worldly desires and worries. Third, while 
observing both the inner and outer body he should exert himself with 
no slackening, being mindful of his observations to keep them in mem- 
ory, and thereby remove worldly desires and worries. It is the same 
with the second application, observing one’s sense perceptions; with 
the third application, observing one’s mind (intellect); and with the 
fourth application, observing one’s psychophysical elements. 
(12) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds 
of vigorous effort: a _bhikṣu_ applies vigorous effort to prevent unfavor- 
able mental elements from arising, vigorous effort to terminate unfa- 
vorable mental elements that already have arisen, vigorous effort to 
help favorable mental elements to arise, and vigorous effort to con- 
template favorable mental elements that have arisen so as to help sustain 
and increase them. 
(13) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds 
of supernormal powers: first, a _bhikṣu_ realizes supernormal power 
derived from dispositional forces bearing the effort of concentration 
motivated by desire. It is the same with the other three cases: through 
concentration motivated by mind, motivated by endeavor, and motivated 
by investigation. 
(14) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four 
kinds of meditative absorption ( _dhyāna-samādhi_ ): first, a _bhikṣu_ con- 
templates the eradication of defilements, such as desire, evil, and unfa- 
vorable things, and realizes the first meditative state of absorption, in 
which there is awareness of objects and the act of examining while 
the sense of joy and bliss increases. Second, he eliminates awareness 
of objects and the subjective act of examination, with increasing tran- 
quility or self-confidence, continually applying concentration of the 
mind, and proceeds to the second meditative state of absorption in 
which there is neither the awareness of an object nor subjective acts 
but a sense of joy and bliss predominate in the arising state of con- 
centration. Third, he distances himself from a sense of joy but dwells

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
in a sense of equanimity, fully aware of subtler bliss, reaching the third
meditative state of absorption in which one experiences the mindfulness,
equanimity, and bliss sought by a wise and holy practitioner. Fourth,
he transcends both pain and pleasure and removes sorrow and joy, thus
realizing the fourth meditative state of absorption in which there is
neither pain nor pleasure but an increase in the state of equanimity that
consolidates pure and genuine mindfulness.
(15) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds
of immeasurable mind: the immeasurable mind of friendly love and
benevolence ( maitrī ), the immeasurable mind of compassion ( karuṇā ),
the immeasurable mind of sympathetic joy ( muditā ), and the immeas-
urable mind of equanimity ( upekṣā ).
(16) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds
of formless concentration. First, a bhikṣu transcends all thoughts of
forms [in the objective sphere], totally exhausts all malicious thoughts
[in the subjective sphere], and thus is freed from any other thought in
the sphere of infinite space. Second, coming out of [this concentration]
he then enters the sphere of infinite consciousness. Third, coming out
of [this concentration] he then enters the sphere of nothingness or nonu-
tility. Fourth, coming out of [this concentration] he then enters the
sphere of neither ideation nor nonideation.
(17) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four
kinds of foundations of religious consciousness: the absence of cov-
etousness and malice and the presence of right mindfulness and right
concentration.
(18) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds
of noble genealogy. First, a bhikṣu knows how to be content with [sim-
ple] robes or garments; he is neither delighted by obtaining good mate-
rial nor dspleased by obtaining poor material, neither affected by nor
attached to the kind of cloth [for a robe] he obtains, knowing the reg-
ulation about the prohibition and restriction [of cloth for robes]. He
knows the essential path of deliverance and exerts himself in the practice
of the path without slackening, and he is able to equip himself with the
robe as required, neither slackening nor falling short of the regulation,
```

51a

```
Sutra 9: Numerically Assembled Doctrines
```

as well as helping others to be outfitted with the requisite robe. This 
is the first kind of self-contentment with the robe requisite, qualifying a 
_bhikṣu_ to be a member of the noble genealogy. He is neither disturbed in 
his mind from the beginning until the present, nor can any fault be found 
in him by gods, evil ones, Brahmā, _śramaṇas_ , _brāhmaṇas_ , [those of] the 
heavenly as well human worlds. H also knows how to be content with 
the remaining three requisites of food, lodging, and medicine for use in 
illness. 
(19) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds 
of characteristics of sympathy: liberality, kind speech, skill in helping 
others, and the sagacious conduct of equality. 
(20) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds 
of the saintly state of stream-enterer: serenity based on trust and faith 
in the Buddha, serenity based on trust and faith in the Dharma, serenity 
based on trust and faith in the Sangha, and serenity based on trust and 
faith in the precepts. 
(21) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds 
of direct experience for oneself: the sense perception of forms expe- 
rienced directly by one’s own eyes, the cessation of bodily sense per- 
ception experienced directly in one’s own body, the [recollection of 
one’s] previous lives experienced directly in one’s own memory, and 
the exhaustion of influences caused by defilement experienced directly 
through one’s own insight. 
(22) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds 
of the mode of progress: painful practice resulting in knowledge slowly 
acquired, painful practice resulting in knowledge quickly acquired, 
pleasant practice resulting in knowledge slowly acquired, and pleasant 
practice resulting in knowledge quickly acquired. 
(23) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains the Four 
Noble Truths: the truth of suffering, the truth of the cause of suffering, 
the truth of the cessation of suffering, and the truth of the path of ces- 
sation of suffering. 
(24) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four results 
of the mendicant life: the result of the saintly state of stream-enterer

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

```
( srotaāpanna ), the result of the saintly state of once-returner ( sakṛ dā -
gāmin ), the result of the saintly state of nonreturner ( anāgāmin ) and
the result of the saintly state of arhatship.
(25) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains the four
firm bases [of religious life]: upholding the truth as one’s firm basis,
upholding the norm of renunciation as one’s firm basis, upholding ana-
lytical insight as one’s firm basis, and upholding the state of quiescence
as one’s firm basis;
(26) Again there is another fourfold doctrine of the four kinds of
knowledge: knowledge of the Dharma, knowledge of what follows,
knowledge of the general agreement or tradition, and knowledge of
the minds of others.
(27) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds
of rhetorical skill and knowledge: rhetorical skill in religious teaching,
rhetorical skill in the meaning [of the teaching], skill and knowledge
of different regional dialects, and skill and knowledge of using the
foregoing three types [of rhetorical skill].
(28) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds
of regions where cognition abides: the cognitive faculty that relies on
an external form as its indirect cause and grows stronger together with
the form and the subjective mental force of craving attachment as its
direct cause; it is the same with the remaining three: immediate sensation
or impression, symbolic signs or ideations, and dispositional forces of
configuration.
(29) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds
of fetters: desire as a fetter, volitional acts of existence as a fetter, wrong
view as a fetter, and ignorance as a fetter.
(30) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds
of severance from fetters: severance from desire, from volition toward
existence, from wrong views, and from ignorance.
(31) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds
of purity: upholding one’s purity with the precepts, upholding one’s
purity with the mind, upholding one’s purity with right views, and
upholding one’s purity through transcending doubt.^25
```

```
Sutra 9: Numerically Assembled Doctrines
```

(32) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds 
of discernment: one discerns what he can or should accept, how he can 
or should act, what he can or should enjoy, and what he can or should 
forsake. 
(33) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds 
of discerning propriety or deportment: a _bhikṣu_ discerns what deportment 
or mode of walking, standing, sitting, or lying down he should adopt.^26 
(34) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four kinds 
of thought: thought with a focus on a limited scope, thought with a 
range expanded over a wider scope, thought with an infinitely wide 
and expansive range, and thought without a specific focus or object.^27 
(35) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains four dialec- 
tical disciplines in questions and answers: a type of dialectical discipline 
to answer categorically, a type of dialectical discipline to explain ana- 
lytically, a type of dialectical discipline to respond with a counter-ques- 
tion, and a type of dialectical discipline to set aside a question. 
(36) Again there is another fourfold doctrine that explains the four 
points of the Tathāgata that do not need to be guarded for purity and 
genuineness: his physical conduct is completely and automatically 
pure so that he does not need to be on guard with it, and it is the same 
with his verbal and mental conduct and his livelihood. 
O _bhikṣu_ s, these are the right doctrines taught by the Tathāgata. We 
should collect these doctrines in memory to prevent dispute and con- 
troversy, to consolidate the practice of austerity for a long time to come, 
and so that the various benefits derived thereby will help increase the 
well-being of gods and humans. 
Also again, all of the _bhikṣu_ s, the Tathāgata has taught the fivefold 
doctrines of his right Dharma: 
(1) A fivefold doctrine explains five bases of cognition: form as the 
objective basis of the eyes, sound as the objective basis of the ears, 
smell as the objective basis of the nose, taste as the objective basis of 
the tongue, and tactile contact as the objective basis of the body. 
(2) Again there is another fivefold doctrine that explains the five 
aggregates that are the basis of clinging to existence: the aggregate of

```
51b
```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

```
material elements, the aggregate of sensation, the aggregate of ideation,
the aggregate of dispositional forces, and the aggregate of consciousness.
(3) Again there is another fivefold doctrine that explains five kinds
of moral and spiritual hindrances: sexual desire, malice, sloth and
torpor, agitation and anxiety,^28 and doubt.
(4) Again there is another fivefold doctrine that explains five kinds
of defilement that bind sentient beings to the lower sphere of desire:
the heretical belief in a real personality, attachment to practices and
observances other than those approved by Buddha, doubt, sexual desire,
and malice.
(5) Again there is another fivefold doctrine that explains five kinds
of defilement that bind sentient beings to the upper spheres, the realms
of form ( rūpadhātu ) and formlessness ( ārūpyadhātu ): attachment to
form, attachment to the formless, and attachment to ignorance, self-
conceit, and agitation.
(6) Again there is another fivefold doctrine of the five kinds of spir-
itual faculties: the faculties of faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration,
and insight.
(7) Again there is another fivefold doctrine that explains five kinds
of spiritual power: the power of faith, the power of effort, the power
of mindfulness, the power of concentration, and the power of insight.
(8) Again there is another fivefold doctrine that explains five kinds
of vigorous effort toward ultimate cessation. First, a bhikṣu should
believe that the Buddha Tathāgata is perfectly endowed with the ten
supreme titles, such as “One Liberated from Attachment” and “Fully
Enlightened One.” Second, he should be free from illness and always
maintain his physical safety and well-being. Third, he should be honest
and direct, without flattery toward those whom the Tathāgata has taught
the path to nirvana. Fourth, he should control his mind, upholding it
firmly and not allowing it to become disrupted, and keep in memory
whatever scripture has been recited, even long ago. Fifth, he should
be capable of skillfully investigating the rising and falling of the psycho -
physical elements and thus terminate the root of suffering through the
same practices as those accomplished by wise and saintly disciples.
```

```
Sutra 9: Numerically Assembled Doctrines
```

(9) Again there is another fivefold doctrine of five kinds of accusa- 
tions: untimely accusation, baseless accuasation, meaningless accusa- 
tion, accusation through harsh words, and accusation derived from 
enmity with no compassion. 
(10) Again there is another fivefold doctrine that explains five kinds 
of good imputations: those that are timely, based in fact, meaningful, 
made with kind, helpful words, and derived from compassion. 
(11) Again there is another fivefold doctrine that explains five kinds 
of envious resentment: envy toward another _bhikṣu_ ’s residence, toward 
lay patrons, toward material goods, toward pleasing appearance, and 
toward access to instruction. 
(12) Again there is another fivefold doctrine that explains five kinds 
of liberation according to five thoughts: contemplation on the impurity 
of the body, contemplation on the impurity of food, contemplation on 
the impermanence of all things, contemplation on the human world as 
not enjoyable, and contemplation on the necessary end of death.^29 
(13) Again there is another fivefold doctrine that explains five essen- 
tial elements for liberation: a _bhikṣu_ should be neither pleased nor dis- 
turbed by desire nor intimated by it but, mindful of the essential elements 
of salvation, he should instead be content in distancing himself from 
it. Even when he happens to be close to desire, he should exert himself 
in controlling his mind without slackening and dissociate himself from 
it by distancing from it. When he has completely discarded and termi- 
nated the defilements that were under evil influences caused by desire, 
he will be able to realize deliverance. This is the first element of lib- 
eration from desire. It is the same with the remaining four: liberation 
from malice, from jealous vexation, from external forms, and from the 
heretical belief in a real personality. 
(14) Again there is another fivefold doctrine that explains five bases 
of liberation. First, if a _bhikṣu_ does not slacken exertion, is content to 
stay in a secluded place, and concentrates his mind, he will be able to 
understand what has not yet been understood, complete what has not 
yet been completed, and settle in himself what has not yet been settled. 
What are these five bases? When a _bhikṣu_ listens to the teaching of the

```
51c
```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

```
Tathāgata, that of a practitioner of austerity, or that of an elder bhikṣu ,
contemplates and examines it, and analyzes its meaning, then he becomes
aware of inner joy. Having experienced such inner joy he acquires
predilection toward the Dharma, and with this predilection he realizes
physical and mental peace and comfort. Once he realizes physical and
mental peace and comfort he is ready to accomplish the state of absorp-
tion and concentration in the practice of meditation, through which he
acquires insight into the nature of things as they really are. This acqui-
sition is the first basis of deliverance. At this point, having listened to
the teaching and experienced inner joy, the bhikṣu retains the teaching
in memory and by reciting it by heart, thus also enhancing his inner joy.
When he teaches what he has learned to other bhikṣu s or other people
he is bound to experience a further increase of inner joy. When he con-
templates and analyzes the teaching he again experiences the reinforce-
ment of inner joy. It is the same [progression] as when he realizes the
state of concentration.
(15) Again there is another fivefold doctrine that explains five kinds
of saints who enter final nirvana without remainder: an anāgāmin (non-
returner) who passes away in the middle of his lifetime in a particular
heaven; an anāgāmin who passes away in the realm of desire ( kāma -
dhatu ), is reborn in the realm of form ( rūpadhatu ), and enters nirvana
from there; an anāgāmin who enters nirvana after proper mental prepa-
ration; an anāgāmin who enters nirvana without any mental preparation;
and an anāgāmin who is born in the highest Akaniṣṭha Heaven and
enters nirvana from there.
O bhikṣu s, these are the right doctrines taught by the Tathāgata. We
should collect these doctrines in memory to prevent disputes and con-
troversies, to consolidate the practice of austerity for a long time to
come, and so that the various benefits derived thereby will increase
the well-being of gods and humans.
Also again, O bhikṣu s, the Tathāgata has taught the sixfold doctrines
of his right Dharma:
(1) There is a sixfold doctrine that explains the six internal bases
of cognition: the sense faculty of sight, the sense faculty of hearing,
```

```
Sutra 9: Numerically Assembled Doctrines
```

the sense faculty of smell, the sense faculty of taste, the sense faculty 
of touch, and the mental sense faculty of consciousness. 
(2) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that explains the six exter- 
nal bases of cognition: material form, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile 
sensations, and mental objects. 
(3) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that explains the six kinds 
of consciousness: visual consciousness derived from the sense faculty 
of seeing, auditory consciousness derived from the sense faculty of 
hearing, olfactory consciousness derived from the sense faculty of smell, 
gustatory consciousness derived from the sense faculty of taste, tactile 
consciousness derived from the sense faculty of touch, and mental con- 
sciousness derived from the mental faculty of thought. 
(4) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that explains the six kinds 
of contact between sense faculties and their objects: contact of the 
visual faculty with its object (form), contact of the auditory faculty 
with its object (sound), contact of the olfactory faculty with its object 
(odor), contact of the gustatory faculty with its object (taste), contact 
of tactile faculty with its tangible object, and contact of the mental fac- 
ulty with its mental object (thought). 
(5) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that explains the six kinds 
of sense perception (or sensation): the visual sense perception arising 
from contact [with the object]; likewise, auditory sense perception, 
olfactory sense perception, gustatory sense perception, tactile sense 
perception, and mental sense perception. 
(6) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that comprises six kinds 
of ideation: ideation of the object of seeing, ideation of the object of 
hearing, ideation of the object of smelling, ideation of the object of 
taste, ideation of the object of touch, and ideation of the mental object. 
(7) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that explains the six kinds 
of thought: thought of the object of seeing, thought of the object of 
hearing, thought of the object of smelling, thought of the object of 
taste, thought of the object of touch, and thought of the mental object. 
(8) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that explains the six kinds 
of craving for the objects of faculties: craving for the object of seeing,

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
craving for the object of hearing, craving for the object of smelling,
craving for the object of taste, craving for the object of touch, and sixth,
craving for the mental object.
(9) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that explains the six roots
of disputes or controversies. First, suppose that a bhikṣu tends to hold
animosity [against others] and reveres neither the Tathāgata (the
Buddha), nor the Dharma, nor the Sangha. He is careless and negligent
in his practice of the precepts, resulting in gaps and weaknesses [in
his practice]. Morally corrupted and impure, he frequently causes dis-
putes or controversies within the sangha. Disliked by everyone, he dis-
turbs other sangha members who are genuinely motivated, and he is
unable to contribute to the well-being of gods and humans.
O bhikṣu s, you should examine your inner selves. If there is anyone
like the bhikṣu in this example, someone who is vindictive and disrup-
tive, you should call for an assembly of the sangha with harmonious
unity and establish various measures (expedients) to eradicate the root
cause of the dispute or controversy. You also should apply introspection
to yourselves. When the cause of enmity has been eradicated, you
should set forth some expedient means to prevent the reoccurrence of
similar mental agitation or discontent. Do not let a similar dispute or
controversy recur.
O bhikṣu s, the remaining five cases should be treated in a similar
manner: when a bhikṣu is hypocritical and merciless, when he is spiteful
and jealous, when he is deceptive and untruthful, when he is arrogant
and will not forsake his wrong view despite the fact that it has been
disproved, and when he is deluded by a heretical view and upholds
that view along with other one-sided views.
(10) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that explains the six ele-
ments of external reality: earth, fire, water, wind, space, and consciousness.
(11) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that explains the six
kinds of correlation sought by the six internal faculties respectively
for the six external objects: the visual faculty examines and finds form
as its proper object. In like manner, the auditory faculty does the same
with its proper object, sound; the olfactory faculty with its object, odor;
```

Sutra 9: Numerically Assembled Doctrines
```

the gustatory faculty with its object, taste; the tactile faculty with its 
object, touch; and the mental faculty with its mental object.^30 
(12) Again there is another sixfold doctrine that explains the six 
essential elements of liberation. Suppose a _bhikṣu_ says, “I have practiced 
the immeasurable mind of friendly love ( _maitrī_ ) for the sake of liberation 
yet I still experience malice.” Other _bhikṣu_ s warn him, “You should not 
say this. Your statement slanders the Tathāgata, because the Tathāgata 
has not taught us the way you have experienced. It is utterly impossible 
that if he wishes us to learn the practice of the mind of friendly love as 
an essential element for liberation, we would still experience a thought 
of malice. According to the Buddha, when one eradicates the mind of 
malice, only then he is ready to acquire the mind of benevolence.” 
The remaining five essential elements of liberation should be shown 
by similar responses if a _bhikṣu_ says “I have practiced the immeasurable 
mind of compassion ( _karuṇā_ ) for the sake of liberation yet I still expe- 
rience a mind of jealousy,” “I have practiced the immeasurable mind 
of sympathetic joy ( _muditā_ ) for the sake of liberation yet I still expe- 
rience anxiety,” “I have practiced the immeasurable mind of equanimity 
( _upekṣā_ ) for the sake of liberation yet I still experience mental states 
of attachment and aversion,” “I have practiced the mind of nonself, 
yet I still experience doubt,” and “I have practiced the concentration 
of signlessness for the sake of liberation (i.e., nonapplication of symbols) 
yet I still experience multiple thoughts due to the use of symbols.” 
(13) Again there is a sixfold doctrine that explains the six kinds of 
highest excellence: highest philosophical thought, highest listening to 
teachings, highest material attainment, highest discipline, highest serv- 
ice, and highest mindfulness and recollection. 
(14) Again there is a sixfold doctrine that explains the six objects 
of mindfulness or recollection: being mindful of the Buddha, Dharma, 
and Sangha and being mindful of the precepts, charity, and divinity. 
O _bhikṣu_ s, these are the right doctrines taught by the Tathāgata. We 
should collect these doctrines in memory to prevent disputes and con- 
troversy, to consolidate the practice of austerity for a long time to come, 
and so that the various benefits derived thereby increase the well-being 
of gods and humans.

```
Also again, O bhikṣu s, the Tathāgata has taught the sevenfold doc-
trines of his right Dharma:
(1) There is a sevenfold doctrine that explains the seven kinds of
detrimental conditions for the practice of religion: the absence of faith,
shamelessness in self-reflection, shamelessness before others, having
little learning, lack of zeal, forgetfulness, and having no insight.
(2) Again there is another sevenfold doctrine that explains the seven
kinds of good conditions for the practice of religion: the presence of
faith, shamefulness in self-reflection, shamefulness before others, being
well learned, being well endowed with energy and zeal, having a well-
sustained memory, and having full insight.
(3) Again there is another sevenfold doctrine that explains the seven
places where consciousness abides. When sentient beings are in pos-
session of different bodies and different ideations, these are humans
and heavenly beings. This is the first abode of consciousness. When
some sentient beings possess individual bodies but one and the same
ideation, this is the time when the god Brahmā was initially born in
Ābhāsvara Heaven, where communication is accomplished by trans-
mitted light instead of sound. This is the second abode of consciousness.
When some sentient beings possess one and the same body but different
ideations, this is the aforementioned Ābhāsvara Heaven. This is the
third abode of consciousness. When some sentient beings possess one
and the same body and ideation, this is Śubhakṛtsna Heaven. This is
the fourth abode of consciousness. The remaining three abodes are the
sphere of infinite space, the sphere of infinite consciousness, and the
sphere of nothingness or nonutility, respectively.
(4) Again there is another sevenfold doctrine that explains the seven
kinds of effort: a bhikṣu exerts himself to practice the precepts, to
exhaust avarice in preparation for the discipline of charity, to break
any wrong view in preparation for the right view, to learn as much as
he can, to maintain the discipline of effort, to uphold right mindfulness,
and to practice meditation and concentration.
(5) Again there is another sevenfold doctrine that explains the seven
kinds of thought: the thought of the impurity of the human body, the
thought that food is impure [in order to eradicate desire], the thought
```

52b

```
Sutra 9: Numerically Assembled Doctrines
```

that there is nothing that can be enjoyed in the world, the thought of 
death, the thought of impermanence, the thought of suffering due to 
impermanence, the thought of suffering due to nonself. 
(6) Again there is another sevenfold doctrine that explains the seven 
auxiliary disciplines of concentration: right view, right thought, right 
speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness. 
(7) Again there is another sevenfold doctrine that explains the seven 
auxiliary disciplines of enlightenment: mindfulness, discernment of 
the psychophysical elements, effort, delight, freedom from bodily and 
mental disturbance, the practice of concentration, and the mind of 
equanimity. 
O _bhikṣu_ s, these are the right doctrines taught by the Tathāgata. We 
should collect these doctrines [in memory] to prevent disputes and 
controversies, to consolidate the practice of austerity for a long time 
to come, and so that the various benefits derived thereby increase the 
well-being of gods and humans. 
O _bhikṣu_ s, the Tathāgata taught the eightfold doctrines of his right 
Dharma: 
(1) There is an eightfold doctrine that explains the eight worldly 
concerns: gain and loss, pleasure and pain, fame and disgrace, and 
praise and blame. 
(2) Again there is another eightfold doctrine that explains the eight 
kinds of liberation: the liberation realized when one, with an internal 
ideation of form, perceives external forms; the liberation realized when 
one, without any internal form ideation, perceives external forms; the 
liberation realized when one has thus terminated all defilements; the 
liberation realized when one, having transcended all form ideations and 
annihilated sensory reaction, abides in the first formless state of con- 
centration, the sphere of infinite space; the deliverance realized when 
one, having transcended the sphere of infinite space, abides in the sphere 
of infinite consciousness; the liberation realized when one, having tran- 
scended the previous sphere, abides in the sphere of nothing or nonutility; 
the liberation realized when one, having transcended the previous sphere, 
abides in the sphere of neither ideation nor nonideation; and the liberation 
realized when one, having transcended the previous sphere, abides in

```

```

the final state of cessation free from the senses and ideation (i.e., the 
third saintly state of _anāgāmin_ ). 
(3) Again there is another doctrine that explains the eightfold noble 
path: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, 
right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. 
(4) Again there is another eightfold doctrine that explains the eight 
saintly personalities: a _bhikṣu_ who is ready for the state of stream-enterer 
and one who has realized the state of stream-enterer; one who is ready 
for the state of once-returner and one who has realized the state of 
once-returner; one who is ready for the state of nonreturner and one 
who has realized the state of nonreturner; and one who is ready for the 
state of arhat and one who has realized arhatship. 
These are the right doctrines taught by the Tathāgata. We should 
collect these doctrines [in memory] to prevent disputes and controver- 
sies, to consolidate the practice of austerity for a long time to come, 
and so that the various benefits derived thereby will increase the well- 
being of gods and humans. 
O _bhikṣu_ s, the Tathāgata taught the ninefold doctrines of his right 
Dharma: 
(1) There is a ninefold doctrine that explains the nine places of sen- 
tient beings. Sentient beings who are in possession of different bodies 
and different ideations are humans and heavenly beings. This is the 
first abode of sentient beings. When some sentient beings possess dif- 
ferent bodies but one and the same ideation, this is the time when the 
god Brahmā was initially born in Ābhāsvara Heaven, where commu- 
nication is accomplished by transmitted light instead of sound. This is 
the second abode of sentient beings. When some sentient beings possess 
one and the same body but different ideations, this is the aforementioned 
Ābhāsvara Heaven. This is the third abode of sentient beings. When 
some sentient beings possess one and the same body and ideation, this 
is Śubhakṛtsna Heaven. This is the fourth abode of sentient beings. 
When some sentient beings reside in the sphere of neither ideation nor 
external awareness, this is Āsaṃjñika Heaven. This is the fifth abode 
of sentient beings. When some sentient beings reside in the sphere of 
52c

```
Sutra 9: Numerically Assembled Doctrines
```

infinite space, this is the sixth abode of sentient beings. When some 
sentient beings reside in the sphere of infinite consciousness, this is 
the seventh abode of sentient beings. When some sentient beings reside 
in the sphere of nothingness or nonutility, this is the eighth abode of 
sentient beings. When some sentient beings reside in the sphere of nei- 
ther ideation nor nonideation, this is the ninth abode of sentient beings. 
These are the right doctrines taught by the Tathāgata. We should 
collect these doctrines [in memory] to prevent disputes and controver- 
sies, to consolidate the practice of austerity for a long time to come, 
and so that the various benefits derived thereby increase the well-being 
of gods and humans. 
O _bhikṣu_ s, the Tathāgata taught a tenfold doctrine of his right 
Dharma, namely, the ten norms for the arhat who does not require fur- 
ther training: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right 
livelihood, right mindfulness, right effort, right concentration, right 
wisdom, and right liberation. 
These are the right doctrines taught by the Tathāgata. We should 
collect these doctrines [in memory] to prevent disputes and controver- 
sies, to consolidate the practice of austerity for a long time to come, 
and so that the various benefits derived thereby increase the well-being 
of gods and humans. 
At that time, the World-honored One verified what Śāriputra had exhorted, 
and all the _bhikṣu_ s who had listened to his lecture experienced joy, respectfully 
received the teaching, and carried out what was taught by Śāriputra.

```
[End of Sutra 9: Numerically Assembled Doctrines]

### Sutra 10

### Ten Progressively

### Classified Doctrines

#### ( Dīgha Nikāya 34: Dasuttara-Suttanta )

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha sojourned in the country of Aṅga 
accompanied by one thousand two hundred and fifty _bhikṣu_ s. He arrived at 
the city of Campā and stayed overnight on the shore of Queen Gaggarā’s 
lotus pond. As it was the full-moon night on the fifteenth day, the World- 
honored One sat in an open area surrounded by the assembly of _bhikṣu_ s and 
taught the Dharma throughout the night. The World-honored One said to 
Śāriputra:

```
Now many bhikṣu s have assembled from all quarters. They have all
been diligently listening to the teaching, disregarding the hours of their
sleep. I have pain in my back and wish to rest for awhile. Please teach
the Dharma for the sake of these bhikṣu s.
```

Having thus instructed Śāriputra, the World-honored One folded his outer 
robe into four layers, spread it on the ground, and lay down on his right side, 
placing one foot on top of the other, like a lion. 
Thereupon, the elder disciple Śāriputra said to the _bhikṣu_ s: 
Whatever doctrine I exhort, whether at the beginning, the middle, or 
the end, is true and genuine. Each doctrine is endowed with its meaning 
and essence. It is well balanced with the practice of pure and genuine 
austerity. All of you, listen attentively, and think about and remember 
what I say. I will begin my discourse to you. 
The _bhikṣu_ s were attentive and ready to listen. Śāriputra said to the _bhikṣu_ s: 
There are ten progressively classified doctrines arranged from one to 
ten, all of which can help you remove varieties of moral and spiritual 
fetters, and thereby help you reach the goal of nirvana and bring an 
end to all suffering. These ten groups altogether comprise five hundred

```
and fifty doctrinal items. Now, I am going to enumerate the ten classified
groups individually.
Listen attentively, all of you. O bhikṣu s, the first group comprises
the doctrinal items that are very useful for religious salvation; the
second group comprises the doctrinal items that should be practiced;
the third group comprises the doctrinal items that should be compre-
hensively understood; the fourth group comprises the doctrinal items
that should be abandoned; the fifth group comprises the doctrinal items
conducive to lessening perversity and ignorance; the sixth group com-
prises the doctrinal items conducive to increasing distinction; the
seventh group comprises the doctrinal items that are difficult to fathom;
the eighth group comprises the doctrinal items that should be brought
into being; the ninth group comprises the doctrinal items that are known
as supernormal powers; and the tenth group comprises the doctrinal
items that should be directly experienced by oneself.
(1) What is the singular useful item? It is the discipline of nonheed-
lessness with regard to all good [psychophysical] elements. (2) What
is the singular item to be practiced? It is the discipline of mindfulness
in contemplation of the body. (3) What is the singular item to be exactly

What is a singular item that is difficult to realize? It is the state of con-
tinuous concentration without lapse. (8) What is the singular item to
be brought into existence? It is deliverance or the unshakable knowledge
of the transcendent in the realm that is under the influence of defilement.
(9) What is the singular item of supernormal knowledge? It is the truth
that all sentient beings continue to subsist on food. (10) What is the sin-
gular item to be directly experienced? It is the deliverance of the mind
that is unshakable or undisturbed toward the realm that is beyond the
influence of defilement.

that is very useful to religious salvation, (2) the double doctrinal item 
that should be practiced, (3) the double doctrinal item that should be 
comprehensively understood, (4) the double doctrinal item that should

aggregates, and the (corporeal) category of form, i.e., the material aggre- 
gate. (4) What is the double item to be abandoned? It means ignorance 
of the Four Noble Truths and desirous craving for existence. (5) What 
is the double item that is conducive to declining into perversity and 
ignorance? It means transgression of the precepts, association with the

item that is conducive to increasing distinction? It means adherence to 
the precepts and right views. (7) What is the double item that is difficult 
to fathom? It means the way in which sentient beings are defiled due 
to direct and indirect causes, and the way in which they are purified 
from defilement due to direct and indirect causes. (8) What is the double 
item to be brought into existence? It means knowledge of total eradication 
of defilement and knowledge of non-origination of states of being. (9) 
What is the double item to be known as supernormal power? It means 
the sphere of conditioned elements and the sphere of transcendent or 
unconditioned elements. (10) What is the double item to be directly 
experienced by oneself? It means acquisition of knowledge of the Four 
Noble Truths and the realization of liberation.

of things, and concentration on the objectless or goal-free state of exis-
tence. (3) What is the triple item to be comprehensively understood?
It means three kinds of sensation or feeling: feeling pain, feeling pleas-
ure, and feeling neither pain nor pleasure. (4) What is the triple item
to be abandoned? It means three kinds of attachment: craving for desire,

from the realm of form leading to the realm of formlessness, and escape 
from the realm of formlessness leading to cessation. (10) What is the 
triple item to be directly experienced by oneself? It means the three 
kinds of supernormal knowledge: knowledge of the recollection of past 
lives, knowledge derived from the supernormal power of vision, and 
knowledge of the total eradication of the influence of defilements. 
O _bhikṣu_ s, the foregoing group comprises thirty doctrinal items. 
Having realized them by himself, the Tathāgata has taught us these doc- 
trinal items with equal emphasis as they really are and not otherwise. 
Again there is a fourth group of ten: (1) the fourfold doctrinal item 
that is very useful for religious salvation, (2) the fourfold doctrinal 
item that should be practiced, (3) the fourfold doctrinal item that should 
be comprehensively understood, (4) the fourfold doctrinal item that 
should be abandoned, (5) the fourfold doctrinal item that is conducive 
to declining into perversity and ignorance, (6) the fourfold doctrinal 
item that is conducive to increasing distinction, (7) the fourfold doctrinal 
item that is difficult to fathom, (8) the fourfold doctrinal item that 
should be brought into existence, (9) the fourfold doctrinal item that 
should be known as supernormal power, (10) and the fourfold doctrinal 
item that should be directly experienced by oneself. 
(1) What is the fourfold item that is very useful for religious salva- 
tion? It means the four kinds of blessings: residing in the proper place 
(i.e., the middle region of India, the Gangetic basin), association with 
and support from good friends, perfect effort motivated by oneself, 
and having planted good roots in one’s past lives. 
(2) What is the fourfold item to be practiced? It means the practice 
of four kinds of application of mental awareness. First, when a _bhikṣu_ 
observes his inner body (i.e., internal senses) in concentration, he 
should exert himself with no slackening, being mindful of his obser- 
vations to keep them in memory, and thereby remove worldly desires 
and anxiety. Second, when observing his outer body (i.e., external 
senses), he should exert himself with no slackening, being mindful of 
his observations to keep them in memory, and thereby remove worldly 
desires and anxiety, Third, when observing both the inner and outer 
body, he should exert himself with no slackening, being mindful of his

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

```
observations to keep them in memory, and thereby remove worldly
desires and anxiety. It is the same with the second application: observing
one’s sense perceptions; the third application, observing one’s mind
(intellect); and the fourth application, observing one’s aggregate of
psychophysical elements.
(3) What is the fourfold item to be comprehensively understood?
It means four kinds of food: edible, material food that is either nutri-
tious or exquisite; nutriment received through contact; nutriment
received through volition or thought; and nutriment received through
consciousness.
(4) What is the fourfold item to be abandoned? It means four kinds
of grasping or attachment: attachment to desires, to the self, to precepts
belonging to other schools, and to wrong views.
(5) What is the fourfold item that is conducive to declining into per-
versity and ignorance? It means the four kinds of fetters: the fetters of
desire, the volitional act of existence, wrong view, and ignorance.
(6) What is the fourfold item that is conducive to increasing dis-
tinction? It means the four kinds of severance from fetters: severance
from the fetters of desire, volition toward existence, wrong view, and
ignorance.

It means the Four Noble Truths: the truth of suffering, the truth of the
cause of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering, and the truth
of the path of cessation of suffering.
(8) What is the fourfold item to be brought into existence? It means
four kinds of knowledge: knowledge of the Dharma, knowledge of
what follows, knowledge of the general agreement or tradition, and
knowledge of the minds of others.
(9) What is the fourfold item to be known as supernormal power? It
means the four kinds of rhetorical skill and knowledge: rhetorical skill
in religious teaching and its meaning, skill and knowledge of different
regional dialects, and skill and knowledge in using the foregoing three.
(10) What is the fourfold item to be directly experienced by oneself?
It means the four results of the mendicant life: the four states of spiritual
development of stream-enterer, once-returner, nonreturner, and arhatship.

Sutra 10: Ten Progressively Classified Doctrines
```

O _bhikṣu_ s, the foregoing group comprises forty doctrinal items. Hav- 
ing realized them by himself, the Tathāgata has taught us these doctrinal 
items with equal emphasis as they really are and not otherwise. 
Again there is a fifth group of ten: (1) the fivefold doctrinal item that 
is very useful for religious salvation, (2) the fivefold doctrinal item that 
should be practiced, (3) the fivefold doctrinal item that should be com- 
prehensively understood, (4) the fivefold doctrinal item that should be 
abandoned, (5) the fivefold doctrinal item that is conducive to declining 
into perversity and ignorance, (6) the fivefold doctrinal item that is con- 
ducive to increasing distinction, (7) the fivefold doctrinal item that is 
difficult to fathom or penetrate, (8) the fivefold doctrinal item that should 
be brought into existence, (9) the fivefold doctrinal item that should be 
known as supernormal power, and (10) the fivefold doctrinal item that 
should be directly experienced by oneself. 
(1) What is the fivefold item that is very useful for religious salva- 
tion? It means the five kinds of effort toward ultimate cessation: striving 
to establish belief that the Buddha Tathāgata is perfectly endowed with 
the ten supreme titles, such as One Liberated from Attachment and 
Fully Enlightened One; second, striving to be free from illness and 
thus always maintain one’s physical health and well-being; third, 
striving to be honest and direct, without the vice of flattery, toward 
those to whom the Tathāgata has taught the path to nirvana; fourth, 
striving to control one’s mind, upholding it firmly and not being dis- 
rupted, and keeping in one’s memory whatever scripture was once 
recited, even long ago; and fifth, striving to be capable of investigating 
the rising and falling of the psychophysical elements skillfully, and 
thus terminate the root of suffering through the same practice as that 
accomplished by wise and saintly disciples. 
(2) What is the fivefold item to be practiced? It means the practice of 
five spiritual faculties: the faculty of faith, the faculty of effort, the faculty 
of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of insight.^31 
(3) What is the fivefold item to be comprehensively understood? It 
means the five aggregates that are the basis of clinging to existence: 
the aggregates of material elements, sensation, ideation, dispositional 
forces, and consciousness.

```

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

```
(4) What is the fivefold item to be abandoned? It means five kinds
of moral and spiritual hindrances: sexual desire, malice, sloth and
torpor, agitation and anxiety, and doubt.
(5) What is the fivefold item that is conducive to declining into per-
versity and ignorance? It means the five kinds of barren mind arising
from doubt. First, a bhikṣu cherishes a doubt against the Buddha. Because
of his doubt he does not approach the Buddha, and because of this alien-
ation he does not pay reverence and respect toward the Buddha. This
is the initial kind of barren mind arising from doubt. Again, in this con-
text, the bhikṣu [naturally] creates blemishes in his practice of the pre-
cepts as the second kind of barren mind; does dishonest actions in
relation to the sangha as the third kind of barren mind; and develops
impure conduct [contrary to the teaching] influenced by defilement as
the fourth kind of barren mind in neglecting the practice of the precepts
and disrespecting adherence to them. These are four kinds of a barren
mind respectively arising from doubt. Also, again the bhikṣu [inevitably]
harbors malice or antagonism toward the other members of the sangha,
and with a joyless and unhappy mind he accuses them in abusive lan-
guage. This is the fifth kind of barren mind arising from doubt.
(6) What is the fivefold item that is conducive to increasing distinc-
tion? It means the five modes of right concentration: inner joy, mental
recollection, self-contentment or self-reliance, a sense of pleasant ease,
and mental focus.^32
(7) What is the fivefold item that is difficult to fathom? It means the
five bases of liberation. If a bhikṣu does not slacken from his effort, is
content to live in a secluded place, and concentrates his mind, he will
be able to understand what has not yet been understood, to complete
what has not yet completed, and to settle in himself what has not yet
been settled. What are these five bases? When a bhikṣu listens to the
teaching of the Tathāgata, that of a practitioner of austerities, or that of
an elder bhikṣu , contemplates and examines it, and analyzes its meaning,
he becomes aware of inner joy; having experienced this inner joy he
acquires a predilection for the Dharma; with this predilection he realizes
physical and mental peace and comfort. Once he has realized physical
and mental peace and comfort he is ready to accomplish the state of

absorption and concentration in the practice of meditation, through 
which he acquires insight into the nature of things as they really are. 
This is the first basis of liberation. Second, having listened to the teach- 
ing and experienced inner joy the _bhikṣu_ retains the teaching in memory 
and by reciting it by heart, thus also enhancing his inner joy; third, 
when he teaches what he has learned to other _bhikṣu_ s or people he is 
bound to feel a further increase of inner joy; fourth, when he contem- 
plates and analyzes the teaching his experience of inner joy is again 
reinforced; finally, it is the same when he realizes the state of concen- 
tration as regards the teaching. 
(8) What is the fivefold item to be brought into existence? It means 
five kinds of knowledge, especially that derived from the practice of 
concentration. First, through the practice of concentration one acquires 
insight into the inner and outer cognitive interaction in blissful absorp- 
tion in the present moment as well as a subsequent effect of the future; 
second, one acquires insight into the inner and outer corporeal faculties 
as a transcendent saintly state of nonattachment; third, one acquires 
insight into the inner and outer cognitive interaction as a state that is 
[always] pursued by the buddhas and saintly disciples; fourth, one 
acquires insight into the inner and outer cognitive interaction as a state 
characteristic of total quiescence and solitude; and fifth, through the 
state of concentration one acquires insight into the inner and outer cog- 
nitive interaction as a state into which the mind enters and from which 
it reemerges. 
(9) What is the fivefold item to be known as supernormal powers? 
It means the five essential elements for liberation. First, a _bhikṣu_ should 
be neither pleased with nor disturbed by [the object of] desires nor 
intimidated by it but, mindful of the essential elements of liberation, 
he is content to distance himself from it. Even if he happens to be 
closely bound up with desire he should exert himself to control his 
mind without slackening and dissociate himself from it by distancing 
from it. When he has completely abandoned and terminated those 
defilements that were under the evil influences caused by desires he 
will be able to realize liberation. This is the first element of liberation 
from desire. It is the same with the remaining four: liberation from

malice, from jealous vexation, from external form, and from the heretical
belief in a self.
(10) What is the fivefold item to be directly experienced by oneself?
It means the five kinds of religious doctrines for one who has realized
the state of arhat and requires no further levels of training: the doctrine
of moral precepts and disciplines, the doctrine of meditative concen-
tration, the doctrine of analytical insight, the doctrine of spiritual libertion,
and the doctrine of the insight acknowledging liberation.
The foregoing group comprises fifty doctrinal items. Having realized
them by himself, the Tathāgata has taught us these doctrinal items with
equal emphasis as they really are and not otherwise.
Again there is a sixth group of ten: (1) the sixfold doctrinal item that
is very useful for religious salvation, (2) the sixfold doctrinal item that
should be practiced, (3) the sixfold doctrinal item that should be com-
prehensively understood, (4) the sixfold doctrinal item that should be
abandoned, (5) the sixfold doctrinal item that is conducive to declining
into perversity and ignorance, (6) the sixfold doctrinal item that is con-
ducive to increasing distinction, (7) the sixfold doctrinal item that is
difficult to fathom or penetrate, (8) the sixfold doctrinal item that should
be brought into existence, (9) the sixfold doctrinal item that should be
known as supernormal power, and (10) the sixfold doctrinal item that
should be directly experienced by oneself.
(1) What is the sixfold item that is very useful for religious salvation?
It means the six principles of fraternity: whe a bhikṣu adheres to the six
principles of fraternity in practice his conduct is worthy of respect and
reverence and creates harmony within the sangha, without any dispute
or controversy, enabling him to act independently without the admixture
of confusion. What are these six principles of fraternity? First, if a monk
always acts in benevolence, pays respect toward those who uphold the
practice of austerity, and abides with a mind of benevolence and love,
his benevolence is regarded as “the principle of fraternity,” worthy of
respect, reverence, creating harmony within the sangha, without any
dispute or controversy, and he can independently proceed without the
admixture of confusion. Second, through adherence to benevolent and
friendly speech and, third, through adherence to benevolent and friendly

thought, a _bhikṣu_ may obtain material support on the basis of the doctrinal 
teaching. Fourth, he should share whatever he receives in his almsbowl 
with his colleagues without keeping it all for himself. Fifth, when a 
_bhikṣu_ upholds the practice of precepts belonging to the practitioners 
of saintly status that should not be violated or altered but kept free from 
immoral contamination, he equips himself well with the foregoing prin- 
ciples that the learned elders praise and realizes the state of mental con- 
centration. Sixth, the _bhikṣu_ realizes the deliverance of those of saintly 
status, terminates the state of suffering together with others (i.e., equally), 
and continues to adhere to right views and various practices of austerity. 
These principles are worthy of respect and reverence, and they create 
harmony within the sangha, without any dispute or controversy, enabling 
one to act independently without the admixture of confusion. 
(2) What is the sixfold item to be practiced? It means the six kinds 
of mindfulness: being mindful of Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, and 
mindfulness of the precepts, charity, and heavenly beings. 
(3) What is the sixfold item to be comprehensively understood? It 
means the six internal bases of cognition: the sense faculties of seeing, 
hearing, smell, taste, and touch, and the mental faculty of consciousness. 
(4) What are the sixfold items to be abandoned? It means the six 
kinds of craving desire that are respectively directed to the external 
bases of cognition, i.e., the objects of the faculties: craving for the 
object of seeing, craving for the object of hearing, craving for the object 
of smell, craving for the object of taste, craving for the object of touch, 
and craving for the mental object. 
(5) What is the sixfold item that is conducive to declining into per- 
versity and ignorance? It means the six kinds of disrespect: disrespect 
toward the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha; and disrespect toward the 
precepts, concentration, and one’s parents. 
(6) What is the sixfold item that is conducive to increasing distinc- 
tion? It means the six kinds of respect: respect for Buddha, Dharma, 
and Sangha; respect for the precepts and concentration, and respect 
for one’s parents. 
(7) What is the sixfold item that is difficult to fathom or penetrate? 
It means the six kinds of highest excellence: highest philosophical

```
The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I
```

```
thought, highest comprehension in listening to discourses, greatest
material attainment, highest discipline and service, and greatest mind-
fulness and recollection.
(8) What is the sixfold item to be brought into existence? It means
the six kinds of long life. Fiirst, a bhikṣu concentrates his mind to abide
in the state of equanimity, neither distressed nor delighted when with
his visual faculty he sees its object, form; likewise, when in a state of
equanimity, he hears with his auditory faculty its object, sound; [and
likewise] when with his olfactory faculty he smells its object, odor,
his gustatory faculty tastes its object, taste; his bodily faculty touches
its object, tactile contact; and when his mental faculty conceives its
object, an idea or conception—[in all cases] he concentrates his mind
to abide in the state of equanimity, neither distressed nor delighted.
(9) What is the sixfold item to be known as supernormal power? It
means the six essential elements of liberation. Suppose a bhikṣu says,
“I have practiced the immeasurable mind of friendly love for the sake
of liberation yet I still experience malice.” Other bhikṣu s warn him, “You
shuld not say this. Your statement constitutes slander against the Tathāgata,
because the Tathāgata has not taught us the way you have experienced.
It is utterly impossible that when he teaches us to learn the practice of
the mind of friendly love as an essential element for liberation he also
causes us to experience a malicious thought. According to the Buddha,
when one eradicates the mind of malice, only then is he ready to acquire
the mind of benevolence.” The remaining five essential elements of lib-
eration are found in similar responses when a bhikṣu says “I have practiced
the immeasurable mind of compassion for the sake of liberation yet I
still experience jealousy,” “I have practiced the immeasurable mind of
sympathetic joy for the sake of liberation yet I still experience anxiety,”
“I have practiced the immeasurable mind of equanimity for the sake of
liberation yet I still experience attraction and aversion,” “I have practiced
the mind of nonself yet I still experience doubt,” and “I have practiced
the concentration of signlessness (i.e., nonapplication of symbols) for
the sake of liberation yet I still experience multiple thoughts arising due
to the application of symbols.”

(10) What is the sixfold item to be directly experienced by oneself? 
It means the six kinds of supernormal powers: supernormal psychic 
power, supernormal hearing, the supernormal power of knowing the 
minds of others, the supernormal power of recollecting and knowing 
one’s past lives, supernormal vision, and the supernormal power of 
eradicating defilements. 
The foregoing group comprises sixty doctrinal items. Having realized 
them by himself, the Tathāgata taught us these doctrinal items with 
equal emphasis as they really are and not otherwise. 
Again there is a seventh group of ten: (1) the sevenfold doctrinal 
item that is very useful for religious salvation, (2) the sevenfold doctrinal 
item that should be practiced, (3) the sevenfold doctrinal item that should 
be comprehensively understood, (4) the sevenfold doctrinal item that 
should be abandoned, (5) the sevenfold doctrinal item that is conducive 
to declining into perversity and ignorance, (6) the sevenfold doctrinal 
item that is conducive to increasing distinction, (7) the sevenfold doctrinal 
item that is difficult to fathom or penetrate, (8) the sevenfold doctrinal 
item that should be brought into existence, (9) the sevenfold doctrinal 
item that should be known as supernormal power, and (10) the sevenfold 
doctrinal item that should be directly experienced by oneself. 
(1) What is the sevenfold item that is very useful for religious sal- 
vation? It means the seven kinds of possessions (or wealth, treasure, 
etc.): first, possessing faith; second, possessing precepts; third, pos- 
sessing a sense of shame in self-reflection; fourth, possessing shame 
before others; fifth, possessing learning; sixth, possessing charity; and 
seventh, possessing insight. 
(2) What is the sevenfold item to be practiced? It means the seven 
auxiliary disciplines of enlightenment. A _bhikṣu_ practices the discipline 
of mindfulness on the basis of nondesire, quiescence, and distancing 
[himself from worldly matters]. In like manner, he practices the dis- 
cipline of discernment of the psychophysical elements, the discipline 
of effort, the discipline of delight [in the practice], the discipline of 
freedom from physical and mental disturbances; the discipline of the 
practice of concentration; and the discipline of the mind of equanimity

```

```
on the basis of nondesire, quiescence, and distancing [oneself from
worldly matters].
(3) What is the sevenfold item to be comprehensively understood?
It means the seven places where consciousness abides. Sentient beings
that possess different bodies and different ideations are humans and
heavenly beings. This is the initial abode of consciousness. When some
sentient beings possess individual bodies but one and the same ideation,
this is when the god Brahmā was initially born in Ābhāsvara Heaven,
where communication is accomplished by transmitted light instead of
sound. This is the second abode of consciousness. When sentient beings
possess one and the same body but different ideations, this is the afore-
mentioned Ābhāsvara Heaven. This is the third abode of consciousness.
When some sentient beings possess one and the same body and ideation,
this is Śubhakṛtsna Heaven, the fourth abode of consciousness. When
some sentient beings reside in the sphere of infinite space, this is the
fifth abode of consciousness. When some sentient beings reside in the
sphere of infinite consciousness, this is the sixth abode of consciousness.
When some [sentient beings] reside in the sphere of nothingness or
nonutility, this is the seventh abode of consciousness.
(4) What is the sevenfold item to be abandoned? It means the seven
kinds of defilement: craving for sexual desire, craving for existence,
wrong view, self-conceit, malice, ignorance, and doubt.
(5) What is the sevenfold item that is conducive to declining into
perversity and ignorance? It means the seven detrimental conditions
counter to the practice of religion: the absence of faith, shamelessness
in self-reflection, shamelessness before others, having little learning,
lacking zeal, forgetfulness, and lacking insight.
(6) What is the sevenfold item that is conducive to increasing dis-
tinction? It means the seven good conditions for the practice of religion:
a bhikṣu possesses faith, a sense of of shame in self-reflection, and a
sense of shame before others; he is well learned, endowed with effort
and zeal, possesses a well-sustained memory, and is full of insight.
(7) What is the sevenfold item that is difficult to fathom or penetrate?
It means the seven qualities of a good person: a bhikṣu is endowed
with good purpose, with good teachings, with good judgment as to
```

54c

```
Sutra 10: Ten Progressively Classified Doctrines
```

proper timing, with good judgment as to proper degrees of satisfaction, 
with a good capacity of self-restraint, with good organizational skill 
to assemble others, and with good judgment about human character. 
(8) What is the sevenfold item to be brought into existence? It means 
the seven kinds of ideation or thought: the thought of the impurity of 
the human body, the thought of food as distasteful, the thought that 
there is nothing that can be enjoyed in the world, the thought of death, 
the thought of impermanence, the thought of suffering due to imper- 
manence, and the thought of suffering due to nonself. 
(9) What is the sevenfold item to be known as supernormal power? 
It means the seven kinds of effort: a _bhikṣu_ exerts himself to practice 
precepts, to exhaust avarice in preparation for the discipline of charity, 
to break any wrong view in preparation for right view, to learn as much 
as he can, to maintain the discipline of endeavor, to uphold right mind- 
fulness, and to practice meditation and concentration. 
(10) What is the sevenfold item to be directly experienced by one- 
self? It means the seven kinds of power that exhaust the influence of 
defilement. A _bhikṣu_ who has terminated the influence of defilement 
sees all the elements of existence as suffering, originated from causal 
concatenation, and which can be brought to cessation as they really 
are in reference to the essential method of liberation. He sees desires 
as a fiery pit or as a weapon, like a knife or sword. Though he knows 
the arising of desire and sees it, he is not attached to it nor does he 
abide in it. The _bhikṣu_ who has terminated the influence of defilement 
practices introspection of the causal chain in the order of cessation as 
well as in the order of origination, and thus understands the origin of 
desire and its cessation as it really is. The worldly vices of avarice and 
parsimony and evil and bad psychophysical elements—these do not 
exercise any influence on his existence nor do they arise in his existence. 
He practices the four disciplines of applying mental awareness, and is 
thus engaged with many items to be practiced and carried out. He is 
also engaged in cultivating the five spiritual faculties and their correl- 
ative forces and practicing the seven auxiliary disciplines of enlight- 
enment as well as the eightfold noble path of cessation.

The Canonical Book of the Buddha’s Lengthy Discourses, Volume I

```
The foregoing group comprises seventy doctrinal items. Having
realized them by himself, the Tathāgata has taught us these doctrinal
items with equal emphasis as they really are and not otherwise.
Again there is an eighth group of ten: (1) the eightfold doctrinal
item that is very useful for religious salvation, (2) the eightfold item
that should be practiced, (3) the eightfold item that should be compre-
hensively understood, (4) the eightfold item that should be abandoned,
(5) the eightfold item that is conducive to declining into perversity and
ignorance, (6) the eightfold doctrinal item that is conducive to increasing
distinction, (7) the eightfold doctrinal item that is difficult to fathom
or penetrate, (8) the eightfold doctrinal item that is to be brought into
existence, (9) the eightfold doctrinal item that is to be known as super-
normal power, and (10) the eightfold doctrinal item that is to be directly
experienced by oneself.
(1) What is the eightfold item that is very useful for religious sal-
vation? It means the eight kinds of causal factors that enable one to
acquire knowledge when the practice of austerity has not been fully
perfected, and to broaden and strengthen it when the practice of austerity
has been perfected. What are these eight items? First, when a bhikṣu
abides in reliance on the World-honored One, his elder teacher, or a
practitioner of austerity endowed with knowledge, he becomes aware
of a sense of shame in his self-reflection and shame before his teacher,
and he cherishes a sense of adoration and reverence toward the teacher.
This is the first kind of causal factor that enables a bhikṣu to acquire
knowledge when the practice of austerity has not yet been fully per-
fected, and to broaden and strengthen it when the practice of austerity
has been perfected. Second, a bhikṣu who abides in reliance on the
World-honored One closely questions him whenever possible, asking,
“What is the meaning of this doctrine, sir?” and “What is intended by
it, sir?” At that time, any honorable senior [monk] should explain the
profound meaning of each doctrine referred to or asked about for the
sake of the junior [monk]. This is the second kind of causal factor. Third,
having thus listened to the meaning of the doctrine, the junior bhikṣu
realizes well-established settlement within his body and mind. This is
```

```
Sutra 10: Ten Progressively Classified Doctrines
```

the third causal factor. Fourth, having thus realized well-established 
settlement within his body and mind, the junior _bhikṣu_ does not engage 
in nonreligious or trivial speech and when he joins his colleagues he 
either talks about the doctrine or invites others to talk about it; otherwise, 
he does not forsake the discipline of noble silence. This is the fourth 
causal factor. Fifth, he attends many discourses for learning, widens 
his knowledge, and upholds it without forgetting it. He intuits the depth 
of the various doctrines, the various degrees of higher, middle, and 
lower goods, the truth of meanings and essences, and, endowed with 
the practice of austerity, he abides firmly unswayed in his mind upon 
reviewing what he has learned. This is the fifth causal factor. Sixth, 
engaged in the practice of terminating evil while increasing good with- 
out slackening, he strives hard, sustains the doctrine, and does not for- 
sake it. This is the sixth causal factor. Seventh, he comes to acquire 
the insight of origin and cessation, know the goal of saintly realization, 
and thus reaches the end of suffering. This is the seventh causal factor. 
Eighth, he analytically intuits the five aggregates of existence as to 
their origination and cessation by specifying, “This is the aggregate 
of material form, its causal context, and its cessation. This is the aggre- 
gate of feeling (sensation), that of ideation, that of dispositional forces, 
that of consciousness, the causal context of consciousness, and the ces- 
sation of it.” This is the eighth causal factor that enables a _bhikṣu_ to 
acquire knowledge when the practice of austerity has not yet been fully 
perfected, and to broaden and strengthen it when the practice of austerity 
has been perfected. 
(2) What is the eightfold item to be practiced? It means the noble 
eightfold path: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right 
livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. 
(3) What is the eightfold item to be comprehensively understood? 
It means the eight concerns of the secular world: gain and loss, disgrace 
and fame, praise and blame, and suffering and happiness. 
(4) What is the eightfold item to be abandoned? It means the eight 
kinds of wrong conduct [counter to the eightfold noble path]: wrong 
view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, 
wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong concentration.

```
(5) What is the eightfold item that is conducive to declining into
perversity and ignorance? It means the eight kinds of indolence. What
are the eight items of indolence? First, if a bhikṣu does not obtain alms
and thinks to himself, “Today I went down to the village for alms but
could not get any. Because of this I am so exhausted that I cannot
sustain myself to conduct the practice of meditation and meditative
walking. Now I should lie down and rest.” This inactive bhikṣu at once
lies down and does not exert himself to acquire what he has not
acquired, realize what he has not realized, and experience what he has
not experienced directly by himself. This is the first kind of indolence.
Second, the inactive bhikṣu , having obtained alms and satisfied with
[the meal], thinks to himself, “This morning I went down to the village
and received more [food than was] than necessary. Since I have eaten
too much, I feel too dull in my body and cannot sustain myself in the
conduct of the practice of meditation and meditative walking. Now I
should lie down and take a short rest.” The inactive bhikṣu at once lies
down and does not exert himself to acquire what he has not acquired,
realize what he has not realized, and experience what he has not expe-
rienced directly by himself. Third, when the inactive bhikṣu does a
little work he thinks to himself, “Because I have handled this small
matter today I am extremely tired and cannot sustain myself to conduct
the practice of meditation and meditative walking. Now I should lie
down and take a short rest.” The inactive bhikṣu at once lies down for
a rest. Fourth, if the inactive bhikṣu, wishing to do some minor work,
thinks to himself, “Tomorrow, I have to deal with such-and-such thing
and there will necessarily be some physical exertion. I should not
engage now in practicing meditation and meditative walking but instead
get enough rest beforehand for tomorrow’s [activity].” The inactive
bhikṣu at once lies down for a rest. Fifth, when the inactive bhikṣu goes
out for an errand in the morning he thinks to himself, “Since I went
out this morning for the errand I am extremely tired and cannot sustain
myself to practice meditation and meditative walking. Now I should
lie down and rest.” The inactive bhikṣu at once lies down for a rest.
Sixth, when the inactive bhikṣu wishes to go out for some minor errand
he thinks to himself, “Since I must go out for an errand tomorrow I
```

```
Sutra 10: Ten Progressively Classified Doctrines
```

will necessarily be exhausted then. I cannot now practice meditation 
and meditative walking but should instead take enough rest beforehand 
for tomorrow.” The inactive _bhikṣu_ at once lies down and [thus, just 
as in the preceding cases,] he does not exert himself to acquire what 
he has not acquired, realize what he has not realized, and experience 
what he has not experienced directly by himself. This is the sixth kind 
of indolence. Seventh, again, when such an inactive _bhikṣu_ suffers 
from a minor illness he thinks to himself, “Since I am extremely ill 
and feel unwell and feeble I cannot sustain myself to practice meditation 
and meditative walking. I must rest [instead].” The inactive _bhikṣu_ 
continues to lie around idly and does not exert himself to acquire what 
he has not acquired, realize what he has not realized, and experience 
what he has not experienced directly by himself. Eighth, when the 
inactive _bhikṣu_ recovers from his minor illness but again thinks to him- 
self, “I was ill and it has not been long since I recovered from it. Since 
I am still feeble I cannot sustain myself to practice meditation and 
meditative walking and should lay down to rest.” He at once lies down 
and does not exert himself to acquire what he has not acquired, realize 
what he has not realized, and experience what he has not experienced 
directly by himself. 
(6) What is the eightfold item that is conducive to increasing dis- 
tinction? It means the eight kinds of indefatigable effort. What are the 
eight kinds of indefatigable effort? First, if a _bhikṣu_ does not obtain 
alms and thinks to himself, “I am physically slight and do not need 
much sleep. I should exert myself in the practice of meditation and med- 
itative walking so as to acquire what I have not acquired, realize what 
I have not realized, and experience what I have not yet experienced 
directly by myself.” Thus he at once continues to exert himself. He is 
regarded as a _bhikṣu_ who is endowed with the virtue of effort. Second, 
having obtained alms enough to sustain himself, the aspiring _bhikṣu_ 
thinks to himself, “Now I went into the village, obtained enough alms, 
and feel vigorous in my mental and physical energies. I should exert 
myself in the practice of meditation and meditative walking so as to 
acquire what I have not acquired, realize what I have not realized, and 
experience what I have not yet experienced directly by myself.” Here

```
the bhikṣu at once continues to exert himself. Third, when the aspiring
bhikṣu does a little work and thinks to himself, “Since I have engaged
in some work and could not conduct my regular practice today, I should
now exert myself in the practice of meditation and meditative walking
so as to acquire what I have not acquired, realize what I have not real-
ized, and experience what I have not yet experienced directly by
myself.” Here the bhikṣu at once continues to exert himself. Fourth, if
the aspiring bhikṣu wants to do some work [other than his daily practice]
he thinks to himself, “Tomorrow I have to deal with such-and-such
thing, and so I am not going to be able to conduct my regular practice.
I should now exert myself in the practice of meditation and meditative
walking so as to acquire what I have not acquired, realize what I have
not realized, and experience what I have not yet experienced directly
by myself.” Here he exerts himself. Fifth, when the aspiring bhikṣu
makes an excursion he thinks to himself, “Since I went out this morning
for an errand and could not conduct my regular practice, I should now
exert myself in the practice of meditation and meditative walking so
as to acquire what I have not acquired, realize what I have not realized,
and experience what I have not yet experienced directly by myself.”
Here he continues to exert himself. Sixth, when the aspiring bhikṣu
wants to make an excursion, he thinks to himself, “Since I have to go
out for an errand tomorrow I will miss my regular practice. I should
now exert myself in the practice of meditation and meditative walking
so as to acquire what I have not acquired, realize what I have not real-
ized, and experience what I have not yet experienced directly by
myself.” Seventh, when the aspiring bhikṣu suffers from an illness he
thinks to himself, “Since I am extremely unwell and my life might
come to an end, I should now exert myself in the practice of meditation
and meditative walking so as to acquire what I have not acquired,
realize what I have not realized, and experience what I have not yet
experienced directly by myself.” Eighth, when the aspiring bhikṣu
recovers from the illness and has made a temporary recovery he thinks
to himself, “Because I was ill I was obliged to forsake my regular
practice a little in the beginning but now increasingly more during
my illness. I should now exert myself in the practice of meditation

```

and meditative walking so as to acquire what I have not acquired, 
realize what I have not realized, and experience what I have not yet 
experienced directly by myself.” Here he rallies to exert himself in the 
practice of meditation and meditative walking. These are the eight 
kinds of indefatigable exertion. 
(7) What is the eightfold item that is difficult to fathom or penetrate? 
It means the eight kinds of places where the practice of austerity is 
obstructed. What are these eight places? First, despite the fact that the 
Tathāgata, who has realized the state of arhatship, has appeared in this 
world, exhorting the supreme Dharma, quiescent and transcendent, 
and proceeded on the path of enlightenment, some sentient beings are 
born in the world of hells. This is the first place where the practice of 
austerity is obstructed. Second, despite the fact that the Tathāgata, who 
has realized the state of arhatship, has appeared in this world, exhorting 
the supreme Dharma, quiescent and transcendent, and proceeded on 
the path of enlightenment, some sentient beings are born among animals; 
third, among hungry ghosts ( _preta_ s); fourth, among the gods of extraor- 
dinary longevity; and fifth, among the nonreligious in the remote frontier 
regions where there are no believers. These are places where the practice 
of austerity is obstructed. Sixth, despite the fact that the Tathāgata, 
who has realized the state of arhatship, has appeared in this world, 
exhorting the supreme Dharma, quiescent and transcendent, and pro- 
ceeded on the path of enlightenment, some people who are born in the 
central country (i.e., India) still adhere to wrong views and perverted 
thoughts, and thus, having done evil deeds, they are bound to fall into 
hell. This is the place where the practice of austerity is obstructed. Sev- 
enth, despite the fact that the Tathāgata, who has realized the state of 
arhatship, has appeared in this world, exhorting the supreme Dharma, 
quiescent and transcendent, and proceeded on the path of enlightenment, 
some people who are born in the middle country (i.e., China) are deaf, 
blind, and dumb and cannot listen to the exhortation of the Dharma, 
nor can they engage in the practice of austerity. This is the seventh 
place where the practice of austerity is obstructed. Eighth, when the 
Tathāgata, who has realized the state of arhatship, has neither appeared 
in this world nor does he exhort the supreme Dharma, quiescent and

```

```
transcendent, nor does he proceed on the path of enlightenment, some
people are born in the middle country and are perfectly endowed with
various faculties, and are thus capable of receiving the noble teaching.
But because they do not encounter the Buddha they have lost the oppor-
tunity to be introduced to the practice of austerity. This is the eighth
place where the practice of austerity is obstructed.
(8) What is the eightfold item to be brought into existence? It means
the eight kinds of established mind upheld by great persons. The [right]
path consists of having less desire, whereas greater desire means the
wrong path. The [right] path consists of being content with little,
whereas insatiable need is the wrong path. The [right] path consists of
an environment of leisurely quietude, whereas interaction with a mul-
titude is the wrong path. The [right] path consists of self-restraint,
whereas a [frivolous] attitude of joking and laughing is the wrong path.
The [right] path consists of indefatigable effort, whereas idle slackening
is the wrong path. The [right] path consists of concentration and mind-
fulness, whereas forgetfulness is the wrong path. The [right] path con-
sists of the state of concentration, whereas a state of scattered confusion
is the wrong path. The [right] path consists of wisdom or insight,
whereas delusion or mental dullness is the wrong path.
(9) What is the eightfold item to be known as supernormal power?
It means the eight kinds of mastery over the senses. An inner ideation
of form perceives a part of external material form, always judging it
and being reminded of it either as good or ugly. This is the first sense
base over which one should have mastery. Second, an inner ideation
of form perceives the immeasurably [vast number of ] external material
forms, always judging them and reminded of them as either good or
ugly. This is the second sense base [over which one should have] mas-
tery. Third, an inner immaterial ideation in possession of a consciousness
perceives a part of external material form, always judging it and
reminded of it either as good or ugly. This is the third sense base [over
which one should have] mastery. Fourth, an inner immaterial ideation
(e.g., consciousness) perceives the immeasurably [vast umbers of]
external material forms, always judging them and reminded of them
either as good or ugly. This is the fourth sense base [over which one

should have] mastery. Fifth, an inner immaterial ideation perceives the 
blue color of an external material form, for instance, like perceiving a 
blue lotus flower with blue color, blue luminescence, and bluish effect, 
or like perceiving a blue Vārāṇasī garment with pure blue color, blue 
luminescence, and bluish effect; and, having formulated an ideation 
like this, always judges it and is reminded of it. This is the fifth sense 
base [over which one should have] mastery. Sixth, an inner immaterial 
ideation perceives the yellow color of an external material form, for 
instance, like perceiving a yellow lotus flower with yellow color, yellow 
luminescence, and yellowish effect, or perceiving a yellow Vārāṇasī 
garment with pure yellow color, yellow luminescence, and yellowish 
effect; and, having always judged it and been reminded of it, formulates 
an ideation like this. [This is the sixth sense base over which one should 
have mastery.] Seventh, an inner immaterial ideation perceives the red 
color of an external material form, for instance, like perceiving a red 
lotus flower with red color, red luminescence, and reddish effect, or 
perceiving a red Vārāṇasī garment with pure red color, red luminescence, 
and reddish effect; and, having always judged it and been reminded of 
it, formulates an ideation like this. This is the seventh sense base [over 
which one should have] mastery. Eighth, an inner immaterial ideation 
perceives the white color of an external material form, for instance, 
like perceiving a white lotus flower with white color, white lumines- 
cence, and whitish effect, or perceiving a white Vārāṇasī garment with 
pure white, white luminescence, and whitish effect; and, having always 
judged it and been reminded of it, formulates an ideation like this. This 
is the eighth sense base [over which one should have] mastery. 
(10) What is the eightfold item to be directly experienced by oneself? 
It means the eight kinds of liberation. First, the liberation that is realized 
when one, with an internal ideation of form, perceives external forms; 
second, the liberation that is realized when one, without any internal 
ideation of form, perceives external forms; third, the liberation that is 
realized when one thus has terminated all defilements; fourth, the lib- 
eration that is realized when one, having transcended all ideations of 
form and annihilated sensory reaction, abides in the first formless state 
of concentration, the sphere of infinite space; fifth, the liberation that

is realized when one, having transcended the sphere of infinite space,
abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness; sixth, the liberation that
is realized when one, transcending the previous sphere, abides in the
sphere of nothingness or nonutility; seventh, the liberation that is real-
ized when one, having transcended the previous sphere, abides in the
sphere of neither ideation nor nonideation; and eighth, the liberation
that is realized when one, having transcending this sphere, abides in
the final state of cessation transcendent from senses and ideation, equiv-
alent to the third saintly state of anāgāmin (nonreturner).
O bhikṣu s, the foregoing group comprises eighty doctrinal items.
Having realized them by himself, the Tathāgata has taught us these doc-
trinal items with equal emphasis as they really are and not otherwise.
Again there is the ninth group of ten: the ninefold doctrinal item
that is very useful for religious salvation, the ninefold doctrinal item
that should be practiced, the ninefold item that should be comprehen-
sively understood, the ninefold doctrinal item that should be abandoned,
the ninefold item that is conducive to declining into perversity and
ignorance, the ninefold doctrinal item that is conducive to increasing
distinction, the ninefold doctrinal item that is difficult to fathom or
penetrate, the ninefold doctrinal item that should be brought into exis-
tence, the ninefold doctrinal item that should be known as supernormal
power, and the ninefold doctrinal item that should be directly experi-
enced by oneself.
(1) What is the ninefold item that is very useful for religious salva-
tion? It means the nine qualities for which to strive: moral purity in
upholding precepts, purity of mind, purity of views, purity of over-
coming doubt, purity of analytical excellence, knowing the right path
from wrong ones, purity of knowing the method for reaching the goal,
purity of the absence of desire, and purity of liberation.
(2) What is the ninefold item to be practiced? It means the nine
roots of proper mental attention: delight, devotion, joy, comfort,
concentration, absolute knowledge, eradication [of defilement], equa-
nimity or nondifferentiation, absence of desire, and liberation.
(3) What is the ninefold item to be comprehensively understood?
It means the nine places of sentient beings. When sentient beings are
```

```
Sutra 10: Ten Progressively Classified Doctrines
```

in possession of different bodies and different ideations, these are 
humans and heavenly beings. This is the first abode of sentient beings; 
second, when some sentient beings possess different bodies but one 
and the same ideation, this is the time when the god Brahmā was initially 
born in Ābhāsvara Heaven, where communication is accomplished by 
transmitted light instead of sound. This is the second abode of sentient 
beings. Third, when some sentient beings possess one and the same 
body but different ideations, this is the aforementioned Ābhāsvara 
Heaven. This is the third abode of sentient beings. Fourth, when some 
sentient beings possess one and the same body and ideation, this is 
Śubhakṛtsna Heaven. This is the fourth abode of sentient beings. Fifth, 
again when some sentient beings reside in the sphere where one has 
neither ideation nor external awareness, this is Āsaṃjñika Heaven. 
This is the fifth abode of sentient beings. Sixth, when some sentient 
beings reside in the sphere of infinite space, this is the sixth abode of 
sentient beings. Seventh, when some sentient beings reside in the sphere 
of infinite consciousness, this is the seventh abode of sentient beings. 
Eighth, when some sentient beings reside in the sphere of nothingness 
or nonutility, this is the eighth abode of sentient beings. Ninth, when 
some sentient beings reside in the sphere of neither ideation nor non- 
ideation, this is the ninth abode of sentient beings. 
(4) What is the ninefold item to be abandoned? It means the nine 
roots of craving. First, there is craving; second, because of craving the 
act of seeking arises; third, because of seeking a gain arises; fourth, 
because of gain there arises a thought of its utility; fifth, because of 
the thought of utility there arises desire; sixth, because of desire strong 
attachment arises; seventh, because of attachment an act of grasping 
arises; eighth, because of grasping a parsimonious act arises; and ninth, 
because of parsimony an act of guarding arises. 
(5) What is the ninefold item that is conducive to declining into per- 
versity and ignorance? It means the nine kinds of hatred. First, hatred 
arises when someone thinks about another person, “He abused me in 
the past.” Second, hatred arises when he thinks, “He abuses me now.” 
Third, hatred arises when he thinks, “He will surely abuse me in the 
future.” Fourth, a person again hates someone when he thinks, “He

abused someone I love.” Fifth, hatred arises when he thinks, “He is
now abusing someone I love.” Seventh, hatred arises when he thinks,
“He will surely abuse someone I love in the future.” Seventh, a person
again hates someone when he thinks, “He associated with someone
whom I hate.” Eighth, hatred arises when he thinks, “He is now asso-
ciating with someone whom I hate.” Ninth, hatred arsises when he
thinks, “He will associate with someone whom I hate in the future.”
(6) What is the ninefold item that is conducive to increasing dis-
tinction? It means the nine kinds of subduing hatred. First, a person
subdues his hatred toward someone, thinking, “This person abused me
in the past but what benefit is there in my holding hatred against him?
I have already subdued my hatred.” Second, he thinks, “Now I am sub-
duing my hatred.” Third, he thinks, “I will subdue my hatred in the
future.” Fourth, a person subdues his hatred toward someone, thinking,
“This person abused someone I love but what benefit is there in my
holding hatred against him? I have already subdued my hatred.” Fifth,
he thinks, “Now I am subduing my hatred.” Sixth, he thinks, “I will
certainly subdue my hatred in the future.” Seventh, a person subdues
his hatred toward someone, thinking, “Though this person has
befriended someone I hate, what benefit is there in holding hatred
against him? I have already subdued my hatred.” Eighth, he also thinks,
“Now I am subduing my hatred.” Ninth, he also thinks, “I will subdue
my hatred in the future.”
(7) What is the ninefold item that is difficult to fathom or penetrate?
It means nine kinds of the practice of austerity. [First, if a bhikṣu does
not have sincere faith he is not regarded as having accomplished the
practice of austerity. When he acquires sincere faith he will be endowed
with the first step of the practice of austerity.^33 Second, if a bhikṣu has
sincere faith but not moral precepts he is not regarded as having accom-
plished the practice of austerity. When he acquires adherence to the
precepts in addition to faith, he will be endowed with the practice of
austerity. Third, if a bhikṣu has sincere faith and adheres to the moral
precepts but is not well learned, he is not regarded as having accom-
plished the practice of austerity. When he is well learned in addition
to having sincere faith and [upholding] moral precepts, he will be
```

```
Sutra 10: Ten Progressively Classified Doctrines
```

endowed with the practice of austerity. Fourth, if a _bhikṣu_ is endowed 
with sincere faith, moral precepts, and learnedness but has little expe- 
rience with preaching, he is not regarded as having accomplished the 
practice of austerity. When he is well experienced with preaching in 
addition to the preceding excellences he will be endowed with the prac- 
tice of austerity. Fifth, if [a _bhikṣu_ ] is well endowed with sincere faith, 
moral precepts, learnedness, and [skilled in] doctrinal preaching but 
is not capable of supporting the sangha, he is not regarded as having 
accomplished the practice of austerity. When he becomes capable of 
supporting the sangha in addition to the preceding excellences, he will 
be endowed with the practice of austerity. Sixth, if a _bhikṣu_ is endowed 
with sincere faith, moral precepts, learnedness, [skilled in preaching,] 
and [capable of] supporting the sangha but is not capable of discoursing 
on the doctrines before the assembly of the _bhikṣu_ s, he is not regarded 
as having accomplished the practice of austerity. When he becomes 
capable of discoursing on the doctrines before the assembly of the 
_bhikṣu_ s in addition to the preceding excellences, he will be endowed 
with the practice of austerity. Seventh, if a _bhikṣu_ is endowed with sin- 
cere faith, moral precepts, learnedness, [skill in preaching, and is 
capable of] supporting the sangha and [discoursing] on the doctrines 
before the assembly of _bhikṣu_ s but has not acquired freedom with the 
four levels of meditative concentration, he is not regarded as having 
accomplished the practice of austerity. When he acquires the excellence 
of freedom with the four levels of meditative concentration in addition 
to the preceding excellences, he will be endowed with the practice of 
austerity. Eighth, if a _bhikṣu_ is endowed with sincere faith, moral precepts, 
learnedness, [skill in preaching, is capable of] supporting the sangha and 
discoursing on doctrines before the assembly of _bhikṣu_ s, and [has attained] 
freedom with the four levels of meditative concentration but has not 
attained freedom with the eight levels of liberation, traversing them in 
successiveorder as well as returning in reverse order, he is not regarded 
as having accomplished the practice of austerity. When he acquires the 
excellence of freedom with the eight kinds of liberation in addition to 
the preceding excellences he will be endowed with the practice of aus- 
terity. Ninth, if a _bhikṣu_ is endowed with sincere faith, moral precepts,

learnedness, [and skill in preaching; is capable of] supporting the sangha
and discoursing on doctrines before the assembly of bhikṣu s, and has
attained freedom in the four levels of meditative concentration and
freedom in the eight levels of liberation, traversing them in successive
order as well as returning in reverse order, but has not accomplished
ultimate realization, he is not regarded as having accomplished the
practice of austerity, namely: “terminating the influences of defilement
and realizing freedom from worldly influences, realizing the liberation
of the mind and liberation through analytical insight, directly experi-
encing in one’s present life that the cause of birth and death has been
exhausted, the practice of austerity has been accomplished, what should
be done [for religious salvation] has thus been accomplished, and that
there will be no more birth to him again.” When in addition to the pre-
ceding excellences of being endowed with sincere faith, moral precepts,
learnedness, [skill in preaching,] supporting the sangha, discoursing
on doctrines before the assembly of bhikṣu s, freedom in the four levels
of meditative concentration, and freedom in the eight levels of liberation,
traversing them in successive order as well as returning in reverse
order, he acquires ultimate realization, namely: “terminating the influ-
ences of defilement and realizing freedom from worldly influences,
realizing the liberation of the mind, liberation through the analytical
insight, having directly experienced in the present life that the cause
of birth and death have been exhausted, the practice of austerity has
been accomplished, what should be done [for religious salvation] has
been accomplished, and will not again be reborn,” he will be endowed
with the practice of austerity thus perfected.
(8) What is the ninefold item to be brought into existence? It means
the nine kinds of ideation or thought: first, the thought of the impurity
of the human body; second, the thought of food as distasteful; third,
the thought that there is nothing that can be enjoyed in the world; fourth,
the thought of death; fifth, the thought of impermanence; sixth, the
thought of suffering due to impermanence; seventh, the thought of suf-
fering due to nonself; eighth, the thought of the cessation of suffering;
and ninth, the thought of freedom from desire.
```

Sutra 10: Ten Progressively Classified Doctrines

(9) What is the ninefold item to be known as supernormal power? 
It means the nine kinds of causal interaction to be intuited as manifold: 
first, because the causal (external) domain is manifold the (internal) 
effectual domain that arises in correspondence with the former is man- 
ifold (different); second, because of these manifold external and internal 
domains there arises the manifold domain of contacts between the 
senses and objects; third, because of this manifold contact there arise 
manifold sense perceptions; fourth, because of these manifold sensations 
(or feelings) there arise manifold ideations; fifth, because of these man- 
ifold ideations there arise manifold conceptions;^34 sixth, because of 
manifold conceptions there arise manifold desires; seventh, because 
of manifold desires there arise manifold passions;^35 eighth, because of 
manifold passions there arise manifold yearning or seeking; ninth, 
because of manifold yearning there arise manifold gains.^36 
(10) What is the ninefold item to be directly experienced oneself? 
It means the nine stages of the successive process of cessation. First, 
when a _bhikṣu_ enters the first meditative absorption there ceases to be 
the ideation of desire.^37 Second, in the second meditative state of absorp- 
tion, the mental activity of thinking and deliberation ceases. Third, in 
the third meditative state of absorption the awareness of delight ceases. 
Fourth, in the fourth meditative state of absorption the signs of inhalation 
or exhalation cease. Fifth, in the sphere of infinite space, the first form- 
less state of concentration, the ideation of external form ceases. Sixth, 
in the sphere of infinite consciousness the ideation of empty space 
ceases. Seventh in the sphere of nothingness or nonutility the ideation 
of consciousness ceases. Eighth, in the sphere of neither ideation nor 
nonideation the ideation of nonutility or nothingness ceases. Ninth, in 
the final state of cessation, in which the senses and ideation equivalent 
to third saintly state of _anāgāmin_ have been transcended, both ideation 
and sensation cease. 
O _bhikṣu_ s, the foregoing group comprises eighty doctrinal items. 
Having realized them by himself, the Tathāgata has taught us these 
doctrinal items with equal emphasis as they really are and not otherwise. 
Again there is a tenth group of ten doctrinal items: the tenfold doc- 
trinal item that is very useful for religious salvation, the tenfold doctrinal

item to be practiced, the tenfold doctrinal item that should be com-
prehensively understood, the tenfold doctrinal item that should be
abandoned, the tenfold doctrinal item that is conducive to declining
into perversity and ignorance, the tenfold doctrinal item that is con-
ducive to increasing distinction, the tenfold doctrinal item that is difficult
to fathom or penetrate, the tenfold doctrinal item that should be brought
into existence, the tenfold doctrinal item that should be known as super-
normal power, and the tenfold doctrinal item that should be directly
experienced by oneself.
(1) What is the tenfold item that is very useful for religious salva-
tion? It means the ten kinds of refuge for religious salvation. First, a
bhikṣu is endowed with the two hundred and fifty disciplines as well
as with dignified deportment, is careful not to commit even a minor
offense, and trains in all the disciplines with meticulous evenness, hav-
ing no detrimental imbalance. Second, he befriends good associates.
Third, he adequately uses words, neither in excess nor insufficiently,
and is able to understand meanings beyond words. Fourth, he willingly
seeks opportunities to listen to discourses on the Dharma and liberally
disseminates whatever doctrine he has thereby received to others without
hesitation. Fifth, he goes out to visit various practitioners of austerity,
openhandedly offers his assistance to help them, accomplishes whatever
is difficult to accomplish, and also teaches others how to do the same.
Sixth, he attends as many lectures as possible to acquire knowledge
and retains whatever he has learned in memory without losing anything
in forgetfulness. Seventh, he exerts himself to eradicate unfavorable
mental obstacles and promote favorable mental elements. Eighth, with
self-motivation he always focuses his mind with vigilant mindfulness
on essentially good conduct as if he has visualized it before his own
eyes. Ninth, he realizes transcendental insight and knowledge, intuitively
perceives the origination and cessation of the psychophysical elements,
and, on the basis of the disciplines upheld by wise and saintly disciples,
he eradicates the root of all suffering. Tenth, he is content with leisurely
seclusion, engaged in mental contemplation, and never wastes time on
worldly pastimes during sessions of meditation.

(2) What is the tenfold item to be practiced? It means the ten right 
practices: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right 
livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration, right 
liberation, and right wisdom. 
(3) What is the tenfold item to be comprehensively understood? It 
means the ten bases of cognition, namely the five senses and their 
respective objects: the visual organ, the eye; the auditory organ, the 
ears; the olfactory organ, the nose; the gustatory organ, the tongue; the 
tactile organ, the body; the visual object, form; the auditory object, 
sound; the olfactory object, smell; the gustatory object, taste; and the 
tactile object, touch. 
(4) What is the tenfold item to be abandoned? It means the ten kinds 
of wrong paths: wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong 
action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong 
concentration, wrong deliverance, and wrong knowledge. 
(5) What is the tenfold item that is conducive to declining into per- 
versity and ignorance? It means the ten kinds of wrongful deeds: first, 
taking life; second, theft, taking what is not given; third, sexual mis- 
conduct; fourth, [speaking] falsehoods; fifth, [deceptive speech]; sixth, 
harsh [speech]; seventh, flattery; eighth, covetousness; ninth, malicious 
intent; and tenth, [holding] wrong views. 
(6) What is the tenfold item conducive to increasing distinction? It 
means the ten kinds of good deeds: first, not taking life; second, not 
[committing] theft; third, [not committing] sexual misconduct; fourth, 
[not speaking] falsehoods; fifth, [not engaging in deceptive speech]; 
sixth, not speaking harshly; seventh, [not engaging in] flattery; eighth, 
not being covetous; ninth, [not harboring] malicious intent; and tenth, 
[not holding] wrong views. 
(7) What is the tenfold item that is difficult to fathom or penetrate? 
It means the ten abodes of the saintly disciple. First, the five items of 
striving toward ultimate cessation (i.e., examination of the fivefold cog- 
nition). Second, examination of the six faculties including mental cog- 
nition: if a _bhikṣu_ adheres to the six principles of community in practice, 
his conduct is worthy of respect and reverence and is harmonious with

```

```
the sangha, without creating any disputes or controversy, enabling him
to act independently without the admixture of confusion. Third, the
singular item to be abandoned, namely, the sense of self-conceit. Fourth,
the four kinds of reliance: first, contentment with the robe requisite
(simple robes or garments that qualify a bhikṣu as a member of the
noble genealogy), and also with the remaining three requisites of food,
lodging, and medicine for use in illness. Fifth, the sixfold alternative
or the different truth of cessation. Sixth, the search for the supreme
and subtle for religious salvation, namely, transcendental insight and
knowledge, intuitively perceiving the origination and cessation of the
psychophysical elements, and eradicating the root of suffering on the
basis of the disciplines upheld by wise and saintly disciples. Seventh,
the thought of nondefilement. Eighth, accomplishment of the practice
of austerity and completion of what should be done [for religious sal-
vation]. Ninth, liberation of the mind. Tenth, liberation through insight.
(8) What is the tenfold item to be brought into existence? It means
the ten kinds of reverence for praise. First, when a bhikṣu has firmly
acquired faith and explains it to others, he should praise those [other
than himself] who have acquired faith. Second, when a bhikṣu has
firmly adhered to the precepts and explains them to others, he should
praise those who have adhered to the precepts. Third, when a bhikṣu
has disciplined himself to desire less and when he explains [this dis-
cipline] to others, he should praise those who have disciplined them-
selves to desire less. Fourth, when a bhikṣu has trained to know con-
tentment and explains this to others, he should praise those who have
also trained to know contentment. Fifth, when a bhikṣu is content with
leisurely seclusion and explains it to others, he should praise those
who are also content with such leisurely seclusion. Sixth, when a bhikṣu
is well learned [in listening] and explains it to others, he should praise
those who are also well learned [in listening]. Seventh, when a bhikṣu
exerts himself in the practice of the path and explains it to others, he
should praise those who have also exerted themselves in the practice
of the path. Eighth, when a bhikṣu has show self-discipline in the prac-
tice of concentration and explains it to others, he should praise those
who have also shown self-discipline in the practice of concentration;
```

Sutra 10: Ten Progressively Classified Doctrines

Ninth, when a _bhikṣu_ has realized meditative concentration and explains 
it to others, he should praise those who have also realized meditative 
concentration. Tenth, when a _bhikṣu_ has realized ultimate insight and 
explains it to others, he should praise those who have also realized 
ultimate insight. 
(9) What is the tenfold item to be known as supernormal power? It 
means the ten kinds of things to be destroyed: first, he who holds right 
views can destroy wrong views, remove all derivative evils arising 
from wrong views, cause innumerable good things to arise through 
various right views, and thereby accomplish whatever he aspires toward. 
It is the same with the remaining nine items: right thought, right speech, 
right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right con- 
centration, right liberation, and right knowledge, just as one who has 
realized right knowledge can destroy wrong knowledge, remove all 
derivative evils arising from wrong knowledge, cause innumerable 
good things to arise through varieties of right knowledge, and thereby 
accomplish whatever one aspires toward. 
(10) What is the tenfold item to be directly experienced by oneself? 
It means the ten norms of the arhat who requires no further training: 
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right 
mindfulness, right effort, right concentration, right wisdom, and right 
liberation. 
O _bhikṣu_ s, the foregoing group comprises one hundred doctrinal 
items. Having realized them by himself, the Tathāgata has taught us 
these doctrinal items with equal emphasis as they really are and not 
otherwise. 
At that time, the World-honored One cofirmed what Śāriputra had exhorted, 
and all the _bhikṣu_ s who had listened to his discourse experienced joy, respect- 
fully received the teaching, and carried out what Śāriputra had taught.
