# The Long Discourses
Translated by Charles Patton
## The Great Legend

### Introduction

Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha was at the Flowering Grove Hut in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī. He was accompanied by a large assembly of 1,250 monks.

It was then that the monks gathered in the Flowering Grove Hall after soliciting alms. They engaged in a discussion with each other: “Venerable monks, only the unsurpassed sage is so extraordinary! His miraculous powers are far-reaching, and his authority is tremendous. He has come to know the countless buddhas of the past who have entered nirvāṇa, broken the bonds, and eliminated idle speculation.”

“He also knows how many eons ago those buddhas lived as well as their names, surnames, the clans to which they were born, the meals they had, the length of their lives, and what suffering and happiness they experienced.”

“He also knows that those buddhas possessed such precepts, such principles, such wisdom, such liberation, and such abodes.”

“What do you think, gentlemen? Does the Tathāgata know this by discerning well the nature of things, or does he know these things because the gods come and tell him about them?”

The Bhagavān was in a quiet place at the time and clearly overheard the monks having that discussion with his heavenly ear. He rose from his seat, went to the Flowering Grove Hall, prepared a seat, and sat down.

He knew the answer, but the Bhagavān still asked them, “Monks, what have you been discussing after gathering here?” The monks then related to him what it had been.

The Bhagavān told the monks, “Good, good! With correct faith, you’ve left home to cultivate the path, and you practice as you should. All of you have two types of conduct: The first is noble discussion of the teaching, and the second is noble silence. This discussion of yours is as it should be: ‘The Tathāgata’s miraculous powers [are far-reaching,] and his authority are tremendous. He fully knows the events of countless eons in the past. He knows it because he understands well the nature of things and because the gods come and tell him.’”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “Monks gathered in the Dharma hall  
> And held a noble discussion;  
> In a quiet place, the Tathāgata  
> Heard it all with his heavenly ear.

> The Buddha sun’s light shines everywhere  
> As he discerns the Dharma realm’s meaning.  
> He also knows the past events of  
> The Completely Awakened and their nirvāṇa.

> Their names, surnames, and families,  
> The births they received, I know, too.  
> The places where they had lived,  
> I recall them with clear vision.

> Those gods of great authority,  
> Quite dignified in appearance,  
> Also come and tell me about  
> The Completely Awakened and their nirvāṇa.

> Recounting their births, names, and surnames,  
> Their _kalaviṅka_ voices fully knew them.  
> To the Unsurpassed Sage of Gods and Humans,  
> They describe the buddhas of the past.”

### The Seven Buddhas

He again asked the monks, “Would you like to hear about the circumstances of past buddhas that the Tathāgata knows with the knowledge of past lives? I’ll tell you about them.”

The monks said, “Bhagavān, now would be a good time for it.” “We’d be glad to hear it.” “Excellent, Bhagavān!” “If there’s time for a discourse, we’ll approve of it.”

The Buddha told the monks, “Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well. I’ll discern and explain it for you.” The monks then accepted the teaching and listened.

The Buddha told the monks, “Ninety-one eons ago, there was a buddha named Vipaśyin who was the Tathāgata, the Arhat, that arose in the world. Furthermore, monks, thirty-one eons ago, there was a buddha named Śikhin who was the Tathāgata, the Arhat, that arose in the world. Furthermore, monks, thirty-one eons ago, there was another buddha named Viśvabhū who was the Tathāgata, the Arhat, that arose in the world. Furthermore, monks, during this present eon of fortune, there was a buddha named Krakucchanda, another who was named Kanakamuni, and another who was named Kāśyapa. Now, I’ve also achieved the supreme and complete awakening during this present eon of fortune.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “Ninety-one eons in the past,  
> There was the Buddha Vipaśyin.  
> Next, thirty-one eons ago,  
> There was the Buddha named Śikhin.  
> During that same eon,  
> Tathāgata Viśvabhū arose.

> During the present eon of fortune,  
> There’ve been countless millions of years.  
> There were four great sages  
> Who arose because of their pity for beings:  
> Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni,  
> Kāśyapa, and Śākyamuni.

### Their Life Spans

“You should know that during the time of Buddha Vipaśyin, people lived for 80,000 years. During the time of Buddha Śikhin, people lived for 70,000 years. During the time of Buddha Viśvabhū, people lived for 60,000 years. During the time of Buddha Krakucchanda, people lived for 40,000 years. During the time of Buddha Kanakamuni, people lived for 30,000 years. During the time of Buddha Kāśyapa, people lived for 20,000 years. In the present time that I’ve arisen in the world, few people live more than a hundred years, and many live for less.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “During the time of Vipaśyin,  
> People lived for 84,000 years.  
> During the time of Buddha Śikhin,  
> People lived for 70,000 years.

> During the time of Viśvabhū,  
> People lived for 60,000 years.  
> During the time of Krakucchanda,  
> People lived for 40,000 years.

> During the time of Kanakamuni,  
> People lived for 30,000 years.  
> During the time of Buddha Kāśyapa,  
> People lived for 20,000 years.

> During my present time,  
> People live for not more than a hundred.

### Their Clans and Surnames

“Buddha Vipaśyin arose from a warrior clan, and his surname was Kauṇḍinya. Buddha Śikhin and Buddha Viśvabhū had the same type of clan and surname. Buddha Krakucchanda arose from a priestly clan, and his surname was Kāśyapa. Buddha Kanakamuni and Buddha Kāśyapa had the same type of clan and surname. Now, I’m a Tathāgata, an Arhat, who arose from a warrior clan, and my surname is Gautama.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “The Tathāgatas Vipaśyin,  
> Śikhin, and Viśvabhū:  
> These Completely Awakened Ones  
> Arose from the Kauṇḍinya clan.  
> The next three Tathāgatas after that  
> Arose from the Kāśyapa clan.

> Now, I am the unsurpassed sage,  
> The trainer of sentient beings,  
> And supreme among gods and humans  
> Who’s from the courageous Gautama clan.

> The first three Completely Awakened Ones  
> Arose from warrior clans,  
> And the next three Tathāgatas  
> Arose from priestly clans.  
> Now, I’m the unsurpassed sage  
> Who courageously arose from warriors.

### Their Trees of Awakening

“Buddha Vipaśyin sat under a patala tree and achieved the supreme and complete awakening. Buddha Śikhin sat under a mango tree and achieved the supreme and complete awakening. Buddha Viśvabhū sat under a sal tree and achieved the supreme and complete awakening. Buddha Krakucchanda sat under a sirisa tree and achieved the supreme and complete awakening. Buddha Kanakamuni sat under an cluster fig tree and achieved the supreme and complete awakening. Buddha Kāśyapa sat under a banyan tree and achieved the supreme and complete awakening. Now, I am a Tathāgata, an Arhat, who sat under a sacred fig tree and achieved the supreme and complete awakening.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “The Tathāgata Vipaśyin  
> Went to a patala tree,  
> Made it his abode,  
> And achieved supreme and complete awakening.

> Śikhin’s was a mango tree where he  
> Awakened and destroyed the source of existence.

> The Tathāgata Viśvabhū  
> Sat under a sal tree.  
> Knowing and seeing liberation,  
> His miraculous abilities had no hindrance.

> The Tathāgata Krakucchanda  
> Sat under a sirisa tree,  
> Purified the knowledge of everything,  
> And became undefiled and unattached.

> Kanakamuni  
> Sat under an cluster fig tree.  
> He made it his dwelling place  
> And destroyed all craving and anguish.

> Tathāgata Kāśyapa sat  
> Under a banyan tree.  
> He made it his dwelling place  
> And eradicated the source of all existences.

> Now, I’m Śākyamuni  
> Who sat at a sacred fig tree;  
> The Tathāgata, the Ten-Powered Sage  
> Who broke the bonds.  
> I crushed the army of Māra  
> And explained great insight to the multitudes.

> These seven buddhas with the power of effort  
> Radiated light and dispelled darkness.  
> They each sat under trees  
> Where they achieved the complete awakening.

### Their Congregations

“Tathāgata Vipaśyin taught Dharma to three congregations. The first congregation had 168,000 disciples. The second congregation had 100,000 disciples. The third congregation had 80,000 disciples. Tathāgata Śikhin taught Dharma to three congregations. The first congregation had 100,000 disciples. The second congregation had 80,000 disciples. The third congregation had 70,000 disciples. Tathāgata Viśvabhū taught Dharma to two congregations. The first congregation had 70,000 disciples, and the next congregation had 60,000 disciples. Tathāgata Krakucchanda taught Dharma to one congregation of 40,000 disciples. Tathāgata Kanakamuni taught Dharma to one congregation of 30,000 disciples. Tathāgata Kāśyapa taught Dharma to one congregation of 20,000 disciples. Now, I teach Dharma to one congregation of 1,250 disciples.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “Vipaśyin was named for vision;  
> His wisdom was immeasurable.  
> He saw everything without fear  
> And had three congregations of disciples.

> Śikhin’s light was undisturbed,  
> And he destroyed the bonds.

> Krakucchanda had one congregation;  
> He took pity on them and healed their pains.  
> That teacher educated the sentient beings  
> In that single congregation of disciples.

> Tathāgata Kanakamuni  
> Was likewise supreme.  
> His body was the color of purple gold,  
> And his appearance was perfect.  
> To his one congregation of disciples,  
> He widely proclaimed the subtle teaching.

> Kāśyapa’s unified mind perceived  
> Each one of his hairs without distraction.  
> With a single discourse that wasn’t troubling,  
> He had a single congregation of disciples.

> Śākyamuni’s thinking was tranquil,  
> That highest ascetic of the Śākya tribe.  
> Being the Supreme Sage, the God among Gods,  
> I have a single congregation of disciples.

> To that congregation, I show the doctrine  
> And proclaim the pure teaching.  
> My mind always feels joyous  
> With contaminants gone and later lives ended.

> Vipaśyin and Śikhin had three,  
> Buddha Viśvabhū had two,  
> And four buddhas each had one  
> Congregation of sages whom they taught.

### Their Parents and Cities

“The Buddha Vipaśyin’s father was named Bandhuma, and he was from a lineage of warrior kings. His mother was named Bandhuvatī, and the king ruled from a city named Bandhuvatī.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “Universal Vision’s father was Bandhuma,

> Where that Buddha taught Dharma.

“The Buddha Śikhin’s father was named *Aruṇa, and he was from a lineage of warrior kings. His mother’s name was *Prabhāvātī. The king ruled from a city named *Aruṇavātī.”

> And his capital was *Anopamā.

“The Buddha Krakucchanda’s father was named *Yajñadatta, and he was from a priestly clan. His mother was named *Suśākhā. The King was named *Kṣema and that king’s capitol was named *Kṣemāvatī after him.”

> And his city of residence was *Śubhavatī.

> That place where I was born.

“These were the conditions, names, clan types, and birthplaces of those buddhas. What wise person who hears these circumstances wouldn’t rejoice and feel delighted by it?”

### Bodhisattva Vipaśyin

The Bhagavān then told the monks, “Now, I’d like to give a talk on the events of past buddhas using the knowledge of past lives. Would you like to hear it?”

The monks replied, “Now is the right time. We’d be glad to hear it!”

The Buddha told the monks, “Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well. I will give you a discerning explanation.

### His Descent from the Tuṣita Heaven

“Monks, you should know the way it always is with buddhas. When his spirit descended from the Tuṣita Heaven to his mother’s womb, Bodhisattva Vipaśyin entered her right side while properly mindful and undisturbed.

“At that moment, there was an earthquake, and a great radiance illuminated the whole world. The sun and moon couldn’t compare to its brilliance. Sentient beings that were in complete darkness saw each other and recognized where they were. When this light illuminated Māra’s palace and the gods, Śakra, Brahmā, ascetics, priests, and other sentient beings, they were all outshined by its brilliance. The radiance of those gods naturally disappeared.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “Dense clouds collect in the sky,  
> And lightning illuminates the earth.  
> When he descended into the womb,  
> Vipaśyin’s radiance was likewise.

> The sun and moon couldn’t compare;  
> No light wasn’t outshined by it.  
> He dwelled in the womb, pure and undefiled:  
> This is the way it is with buddhas.

### The Four Heavenly Guards

“Monks, you should know the way it always is with buddhas. While he was in his mother’s womb, Bodhisattva Vipaśyin was focused and undisturbed. Four gods armed with spears stood guard over his mother so that no human nor non-human could do her harm. This is the way it always is [with buddhas].”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “Those four gods from four directions,  
> They were famous and dignified.  
> The Lord of Gods Śakra sent them  
> To guard the Bodhisattva well.

> Always with spears in hand,  
> They never left their posts.  
> Humans and non-humans did them no harm:  
> This is the way it always is with buddhas.

> She was protected by these gods  
> Like a goddess guarded in heaven.  
> Her retinue felt joyous:  
> This is the way it always is with buddhas.”

### His Mother Beheld Him in Her Womb

He also told the monks, “This is the way it always is with buddhas. When his spirit descended from the Tuṣita Heaven to his mother’s womb, Bodhisattva Vipaśyin was focused and undisturbed. His mother’s body was at ease, she didn’t have any kind of illness, and her wisdom improved.

“His mother looked into her womb and saw the Bodhisattva’s body with fully formed faculties. He was the color of purple gold and had no blemishes. She was like a man with eyesight looking at a pure beryl that’s transparent and lacks any obstructions to his vision. Monks, this is the way it always is with buddhas.”

The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:

> “Like a pure beryl gemstone  
> That’s bright as the sun and moon,  
> That gentle sage dwelled in his mother’s womb,  
> And his mother had no illness.

> Her wisdom was improved,  
> And she saw he was like a gold statue.  
> His mother’s pregnancy was comfortable:  
> This is the way it always is with buddhas.”

### His Mother Had No Desire

The Buddha told the monks, “[This is the way it always is with buddhas.] When his spirit descended from the Tuṣita Heaven to his mother’s womb, Bodhisattva Vipaśyin was focused and undisturbed. His mother’s heart was pure, without any notions of desire. Nor was she burned by the fire of lust. This is the way it always is with buddhas.”

The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:

> “The Bodhisattva in his mother’s womb  
> Had died after achieving heavenly merit.  
> His mother’s heart was pure;  
> She didn’t have any notions of desire.

> She abandoned lustful desires,  
> Neither defiled nor being intimate.  
> She wasn’t burned by the fire of desire:  
> The mothers of buddhas are always pure.”

### His Mother Upheld the Five Precepts

The Buddha told the monks, “This is the way it always is with buddhas. When his spirit descended from the Tuṣita Heaven to his mother’s womb, Bodhisattva Vipaśyin was focused and undisturbed. His mother upheld the five precepts, purified the religious practice, and was devoted and loving. Having accomplished these virtues, she was happy and confident. When her body broke up and her life ended, she was born in the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven. This is the way it always is [with buddhas].”

The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:

> “The woman who’s pregnant with the sage  
> Makes effort and perfects the precepts.  
> She’s sure to get a goddess’ body later:  
> This is the reason she’s called ‘buddha’s mother.’”

### The Bodhisattva’s Birth

The Buddha told the monks, “This is the way it always is with buddhas. When he was born, Bodhisattva Vipaśyin emerged from his mother’s right side. There was an earthquake, and a radiance illuminated [the whole world], just as it did when he first entered her womb. There was no place of darkness that wasn’t illuminated. This is the way it always is [with buddhas].”

The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:

> “When the prince was born, the earth shook,  
> And a great light shined everywhere  
> In this world and in other worlds,  
> Above, below, and in all directions.

> He emitted a light that granted pure sight  
> Of his fully-formed heavenly body.  
> With joyous and pure voices,  
> The Bodhisattva’s name was announced.”

### His Mother Gave Birth while Standing

The Buddha told the monks, “This is the way it always is with buddhas. When he was born, Bodhisattva Vipaśyin emerged from his mother’s right side, and he was focused and undisturbed. The Bodhisattva’s mother held onto a tree limb, neither sitting nor lying down. Four gods stood in front his mother and presented fragrant water. They said, ‘Oh, heavenly mother! Now you’ve given birth to a holy son. Don’t feel anguish over it!’ This is the way it always is [with buddhas].”

The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:

> “A Buddha’s mother doesn’t sit or lie down,  
> Standing in precepts and the religious life.  
> Giving birth to the sage, she’s not indolent,  
> But gods and humans offer her their help.”

### The Bodhisattva Was Born Clean

The Buddha told the monks, “This is the way it always is with buddhas. When he was born, Bodhisattva Vipaśyin emerged from his mother’s right side, and he was focused and undisturbed. His body was clean and not sullied by filth. It was like a man with eyesight putting a pure, bright jewel on white silk. Neither of them dirties the other because they are both pure. The Bodhisattva emerged from the womb in the same way. This is the way it always is [with buddhas].”

The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:

> “He was like a pure and bright jewel  
> That isn’t defiled when placed on silk.  
> When he emerged from his mother’s womb,  
> The Bodhisattva was clean and undefiled.”

### The Bodhisattva Walked Seven Paces at Birth

The Buddha told the monks, “This is the way it always is with buddhas. When he was born, Bodhisattva Vipaśyin emerged from his mother’s right side, and he was focused and undisturbed. Upon emerging from her right side, he fell to the ground and walked seven paces without anyone helping him. He looked all around in the four directions, raised his hand, and said, ‘Only I am exalted by both Heaven and Earth, for I will save sentient beings from birth, old age, illness, and death.’ This is the way it always is [with buddhas].”

The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:

> “He took his steps like a lion  
> And looked around in all four directions.  
> He fell to the ground and walked seven paces  
> Like a lion among humans.

> He also walked like a great elephant  
> And looked around in all four directions.  
> He fell to the ground and walked seven paces  
> Like an elephant among humans.

> When the most exalted of bipeds was born,  
> He walked seven paces, steady on his feet.  
> He looked in the four directions and said:  
> ‘I will end the suffering of birth and death.’

> Right when he was first born,  
> He was equal to the unequaled.  
> He himself saw the root of birth and death,  
> And that body was his very last.”

### He Was Bathed in Warm and Cool Water

The Buddha told the monks, “This is the way it always is with buddhas. When he was born, Bodhisattva Vipaśyin emerged from his mother’s right side, and he was focused and undisturbed. Two streams of water sprang forth, one warm and one cool, which were provided for bathing him. This is the way it always is [with buddhas].”

The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:

> “When the most exalted of bipeds was born,  
> Two streams of water sprang forth.  
> They were provided to the Bodhisattva  
> To cleanse and purify Universal Vision.

> Two streams sprang forth,  
> And their water was extremely pure.  
> One stream was warm, and the other was cool,  
> With which the Omniscient One was bathed.

### The Fortune Tellers’ Prediction

“When the prince was first born, his father King Bandhuma summoned a group of fortune tellers and seers to examine the prince and determine his fortune or misfortune.

“The fortune tellers accepted his command and examined the prince. Lifting his robe, they saw he had the full set of signs. They predicted, ‘Someone possessing these signs will have [one of] two destinies, without a doubt. If he remains at home, he’ll become a noble wheel-turning king. He’ll be the king of the four continents, and his four armies will be complete. He’ll rule with the correct Dharma without any tyranny, and he’ll be a blessing to the world. The seven treasures will come naturally to him, and he’ll have a thousand courageous sons. He’ll defeat foreign adversaries without using weapons, and there’ll be a great peace in the world. If he leaves home to train on the path, then he’ll achieve complete awakening and be given the ten epithets.’

“The fortune tellers then said to the king, ‘This son born to the King has the thirty-two signs. He’ll arrive at [one of] two places, without a doubt. If he stays at home, he’ll become a noble wheel-turning king. If he leaves home, he’ll achieve complete awakening and be given the ten epithets.’”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “The prince was born with a hundred merits  
> Described by the fortune tellers  
> Like reading from a book they carried:  
> ‘He’ll have [one of] two destinies, without doubt.

> If he’s happy with the home life,  
> He’ll become a wheel-turning king.  
> Seven treasures that are hard to get  
> Will naturally come and make him a king.

> The gold wheel is replete with a thousand spokes  
> That hold a golden rim all around them.  
> It turns and flies wherever he travels;  
> Therefore, it’s called the heavenly wheel.

> Well-trained and standing with seven tusks,  
> Tall, broad, and white as snow.  
> It’s able to fly through the sky;

### The Thirty-Two Signs of a Great Man

“His father the king repeated himself three times, asking the physiognomists, ‘Look again at the prince’s thirty-two signs. What are they called?’

“The fortune-tellers lifted the prince’s robe and described his thirty-two signs: ‘First, his feet are flat. The soles of his feet are level and full, and they step on the ground securely. Second, the soles of his feet are marked with wheels. Complete with a thousand spokes, they shine with many lights. Third, his hands and feet are webbed like the king of geese. Fourth, his hands and feet are soft like heavenly cloth. Fifth, his fingers and toes are unmatched in slenderness and length. Sixth, his heels are so full one never tires of looking at them. Seventh, his calves are straight up and down like a deer’s legs. Eighth, his bones are a chain, and his joints hook together like chain links. Ninth, his organ is hidden like that of a horse. Tenth, his hands hang down beyond his knees. Eleventh, each of his pores has a hair growing from it, the hairs curl to the right, and they’re the color of a dark blue beryl. Twelfth, his hair curls to the right, is blue in color, and turns upward. Thirteenth, his body is the color of gold. Fourteenth, his skin is fine and soft, and dirt doesn’t cling to it. Fifteenth, his shoulders are even, full, rounded, and attractive. Sixteenth, he has the _svastika_ symbol on his chest. Seventeenth, his body is twice as long as a human. Eighteenth, his seven points are equally full. Nineteenth, his body’s length and breadth is like that of a banyan tree. Twentieth, he has rounded cheeks like a lion. Twenty-first, his breast is dignified like that of a lion. Twenty-second, he has forty teeth in his mouth. Twenty-third, he is dignified and symmetrical. Twenty-fourth, the gaps between his teeth are hidden. Twenty-fifth, his teeth are pure white and bright. Twenty-sixth, his throat is clean. Whatever food he eats, its flavor is always agreeable. Twenty-seventh, his tongue is so long and broad, it can lick his left or right ear. Twenty-eighth, his Brahmā voice is clear. Twenty-ninth, his eyes are deep blue. Thirtieth, he has eyes like a bull king that blink up and down together. Thirty-first, he has a white tuft of soft and shiny hair between his brows. It’s a fathom long when pulled, and it curls to the right when released, like a jeweled conch shell. Thirty-second, he has a fleshy knot on his crown. These are the thirty-two signs.’”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “He stands well on soft feet  
> That don’t leave footprints on the ground;  
> They’re adorned with thousand-spoked signs,  
> All of which are lustrous.

> He’s like a banyan tree  
> In circumference, straightness, and evenness.  
> The Tathāgata is unprecedented,  
> Whose organ is hidden like that of a horse.

> His body is adorned with golden treasures  
> As his many signs reflect each other.  
> Though he travels conventionally,  
> Neither dust nor earth dirty him.

> His heavenly form is so soft and gentle,  
> And a heavenly parasol naturally shades him.  
> His Brahma voice and purple-gold body  
> Are like a lotus when it first emerges from water.

> The king asked the fortune-tellers,  
> And they respectfully answered him.  
> They praised the Bodhisattva’s signs,  
> As his whole body was glowing.  
> His hands, feet, limbs, and joints,  
> His center and extremities were all apparent.

> The flavor of his food is entirely complete;  
> His body is straight and not crooked;  
> The wheels on the soles of his feet are clear;  
> His voice is like that of a _kalaviṅka_ bird.

> The shape of his thighs is full,  
> Being formed by his past actions.  
> His arms are full and well-rounded,  
> And his eyebrows are quite dignified.

> He’s an exalted lion among humans;  
> His majestic power is supreme.  
> His rounded cheeks are dignified,  
> And he lies on his side like a lion.

> His well-arranged teeth are forty,  
> And the gaps between them are hidden.  
> His Brahma voice is unprecedented,  
> And [people] come from far and near.

> Standing straight, not leaning over,  
> Both his hands touch his knees.  
> His hands are even and soft,  
> And people honor his beautiful signs.

> Each of his pores has a hair growing from it,  
> And his hands and feet have the sign of webbing.  
> He has a fleshy topknot and deep blue eyes,  
> Which both blink up and down.

> Both his shoulders are full and well-rounded,  
> Completing his thirty-two signs.  
> His heels are neither high nor low,  
> And his calves are straight and slender like deer legs.

> A god among gods has come to us  
> Like an elephant that broke its leg bonds.  
> He’ll free sentient beings from suffering  
> That dwell in birth, old age, illness, and death.

> Out of kindness and compassion,  
> He’ll teach the four truths.  
> With plain Dharma expressions and meaning,  
> He’ll prompt many offerings and utmost honors.”

### The Bodhisattva’s Early Life

The Buddha told the monks, “When he was born, Bodhisattva Vipaśyin was sheltered from cold, heat, wind, rain, and dust by gods in the sky, who held white parasols and jeweled fans for him.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “Unprecedented among humans,  
> He was born the most exalted of bipeds.  
> The gods respected and supported him,  
> Offering jeweled parasols and fans.

“His father, the King, provided him with four wetnurses: The first fed him milk, the second bathed him, and third rubbed him with incense, and the fourth entertained him. They joyously nurtured him without any neglect.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “The wetnurses were kind and loving,  
> Entrusted to nurture the boy from birth.  
> One fed him milk, one bathed him,  
> Two applied incense and entertained him.  
> The fragrance was the world’s most superb  
> With which the exalted of humans was rubbed.

“When he was a youth, the whole country’s men and women watched him without tire.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “He was respected and liked by people  
> Like a freshly-made gold statue.  
> Men and women clearly observed him,  
> And they watched him tirelessly.

“While he was a youth, the whole country’s men and women would pass him around and hold him up as though they were looking at a jeweled flower.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “When the exalted of bipeds was born,  
> He was respected and loved by people.  
> They took turns holding him up  
> As though looking at a jeweled flower.

“When he was born, the Bodhisattva’s eyes were unblinking like those of a Trāyastriṃśa god. He was named Vipaśyin because he didn’t blink.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “The god among gods didn’t blink  
> Just like a Trāyastriṃśa god.  
> Seeing a form, he rightly observed it;  
> Therefore, he was called Vipaśyin.

“When he was born, the Bodhisattva’s voice was clear, gentle, and harmonious like the voice of a _kalaviṅka_ bird.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “He was like the bird of the Himalayas  
> That drinks flower nectar and sings.  
> The most exalted of bipeds  
> Had a voice that was just as clear.

“When he was born, the Bodhisattva’s vision could see clearly as far away as a _yojana_.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “As a result of practicing pure deeds,  
> He got the marvelous glow of a god.  
> The Bodhisattva’s eyes could see  
> At a range of a one _yojana_.

“When he was born, the Bodhisattva grew up to adulthood and was educated in the way [of governing] in the royal hall. His favor reached the common people, and his reputation for virtue was heard far away.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “In the royal hall, that young man  
> Educated the world with the way.  
> He made a variety of decisions,  
> So he was called Vipaśyin.

> His pure knowledge was vast  
> And deep like the ocean.  
> He delighted the mass of beings  
> And improved their wisdom.

“At that point, the Bodhisattva wanted to go out sight-seeing, so he ordered his driver to prepare a chariot and horses to go tour a forest park. Once the chariot and horses were ready, the driver returned and said, ‘Now is a good time.’ The prince then rode in the precious chariot to the scenic park. While they were on the road, they saw an elderly man. His hair was white, his teeth had fallen out, and his wrinkled body was bent. He walked wearily with a cane and was short of breath.

“The prince asked his aide, ‘What sort of man is that?’

“He answered, ‘This is an old man.’

“The prince also asked, ‘What is “old”?’

“He answered, ‘Old age happens as the end of one’s life approaches. When there aren’t many years left, it’s called being old.’

“The prince asked, ‘Will I be likewise? Will I not escape this hardship?’

“He answered, ‘Yes, anyone born is sure to become old. It doesn’t matter if they are rich or poor.’

“The prince was disturbed and unhappy at that point. He told his driver to turn the chariot around and go back to the palace. He silently thought to himself, ‘To think I’ll also have to suffer being old!’”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “Seeing an old man, his life about to end,  
> Walking weakly with a cane,  
> The Bodhisattva thought to himself,  
> ‘I’ve yet to escape from this hardship!’

“His father, the King, then asked the driver, ‘Did the prince enjoy his excursion?’

“He answered, ‘He didn’t enjoy it.’

“The King asked him why, and the driver replied, ‘We happened upon an old man on the road, which made him unhappy.’

“His father, the king, then thought silently to himself, ‘The fortune-tellers foretold that the prince would leave home, and now he isn’t happy. Is there nothing I can do? I’ll devise a way to make him stay in the inner palace and entertain him with the five desires. He’ll be delighted, which will prevent him from leaving home!’ He then decorated the palace’s guest quarters and selected some maidens to entertain the prince.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “His father, the King, heard this said  
> And decorated the palace guest quarters.  
> He gave him more of the five desires,  
> To prevent the prince from leaving home.

“On another occasion after that, the prince again ordered his driver to prepare a chariot and horses for an excursion, and they encountered a sick man on the road. His body was limp, and his belly was huge. His face and eyes were dark, and he was lying alone in his own waste without anyone to look after him. His illness was so painful; he couldn’t speak.

“The prince looked back at his driver and said, ‘What sort of man is that?’

“He answered, ‘That is a sick man.’

“The prince asked, ‘What is ‘sickness’?’

“He answered, ‘Sickness is being attacked by one of myriad diseases. When a person is still alive and hasn’t died yet, they are called sick.’

“‘Will I be likewise? Haven’t I escape this hardship yet?’

“‘Yes, anyone born becomes sick. It doesn’t matter if they are rich or poor.’

“The prince was disturbed and unhappy. He told the driver to turn the chariot around and return to the palace. He thought silently to himself, ‘To think I’ll also have to suffer being sick!’”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “Seeing that man who’d been sick a long time,  
> Whose countenance had wasted away,  
> The prince thought quietly to himself,  
> ‘I’ve yet to escape from this hardship!’

“His father, the King, again asked the driver, ‘Did the prince enjoy his excursion?’

“He answered, ‘He didn’t enjoy it.’

“The king asked him why, and the driver answered, ‘We happened upon a sick man on the road, and he wasn’t happy about it.’

“His father, the King, thought, ‘The fortune-tellers foretold that the prince would leave home, and now he isn’t happy. Is there nothing I can do? I’ll devise a way to improve his entertainment. He’ll be delighted, which will prevent him from leaving home!’ The King then decorated the palace guest quarters and selected maidens to entertain the prince.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “Sight, sound, odor, flavor, and touch,  
> Sublime and delightful were they,  
> As a result of the Bodhisattva’s merits;  
> Therefore, he was entertained by them.

“On another occasion, the prince ordered his driver to prepare a chariot and horses for an excursion, and they encountered a dead man on the road. Multi-colored banners were posted in front and behind his corpse, and his relatives and family were lamenting and crying as they sent it out of the city. The prince again asked, ‘What sort of man is that?’

“He answered, ‘That’s a dead man.’

“‘What exactly is “dead”?’

“‘Death is the end. Breath goes first, warmth goes next, and then the faculties decay. When a person dies, they go somewhere else and live in a separate family. Therefore, it’s called death.’

“The prince also asked the driver, ‘Will I be likewise? Haven’t I escaped this trouble?’

“He answered, ‘Yes, everyone born is sure to die. It doesn’t matter if they are rich or poor.’

“The prince was disturbed and unhappy. He told the driver to turn the chariot around and return to the palace. He silently thought, ‘To think I too will have to suffer this death!’”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “When he first saw a dead person,  
> The prince knew they would be reborn.  
> He silently thought to himself,  
> ‘I haven’t escaped this hardship yet!’

“His father, the King, again asked the driver, ‘Did the prince enjoy his excursion?’

“He answered, ‘He didn’t enjoy it.’

“The King asked him why, and the driver answered, ‘We happened upon a dead man on the road, and he wasn’t happy about it.’

“His father, the King, thought to himself, ‘The fortune-tellers foretold that the prince would leave home, and now he isn’t happy. Is there nothing I can do? I’ll devise a way to improve his entertainment. He’ll be delighted, which will prevent him from leaving home!’ The King then decorated the palace guest quarters and selected maidens to entertain the prince.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “The young man was famous  
> And surrounded by many maidens.  
> He enjoyed the five desires,  
> Like that Lord of Gods, Śakra.

“On another occasion, he ordered his driver to prepare a chariot and horses for an excursion, and they encountered an ascetic on the road. He wore Dharma clothes and carried a bowl, looking at the ground as he walked. The prince asked his driver, ‘What sort of man is that?’

“His driver replied, ‘That is an ascetic.’

“The prince also asked, ‘What is an ascetic?’

“He answered, ‘An ascetic renounces love, leaves home, and cultivates the path. He controls his faculties so that he isn’t defiled by external desires. He’s kind to everyone, and he doesn’t do any harm. When he encounters suffering, he isn’t saddened. When he meets with pleasure, he isn’t delighted. He’s tolerant like the earth; therefore, he’s called an ascetic.’

“The prince said, ‘Excellent! This is the path is that truly severs worldly ties. It’s subtle, pure, and clear. This is the only way to happiness.’ He then ordered his driver to pull the chariot over [beside the ascetic].”

“The prince then asked the ascetic, ‘What’s the purpose of cutting off one’s hair and beard, putting on Dharma robes, and carrying a bowl?’

“The ascetic replied, ‘A person leaves home wanting to train their mind, forever part with dirtiness, kindly nurture living things, and do no harm. They quiet vain thoughts; their only work is the path.’

“The prince said, ‘Excellent! This path is the truest!’ He immediately ordered his driver, ‘Take my precious clothes and carriage and return them to the great King. I’m going to cut off my hair and beard, put on the three Dharma robes, and leave home to cultivate the path. Why is that? I want to train my mind, discard dirtiness, and purify my life in order to seek the methods of the path.’

“Thereupon, the driver drove the prince’s precious chariot and clothes back to his father, the King. Afterward, the prince cut off his hair and beard, put on the three Dharma robes, and left home to cultivate the path.”

The Buddha told the monks, “When he saw the elderly man and the sick man, the prince recognized the suffering of the world. When he saw the dead man, his feelings of attraction to the world ceased. Then, he saw the ascetic and the vastness of the great awakening. When he dismounted from his precious chariot, he walked away from bondage, step by step. This was how he genuinely left home; this was his genuine renunciation.

“The people of the country heard that the prince had cut off his hair and beard, put on Dharma robes, carried a bowl, and left home to cultivate the path. They said to each other, ‘This path must be genuine for the prince to give up his position as the country’s heir. That’s a serious thing to discard!’ Thereupon, 84,000 people in the country went to the prince wanting to become his disciples and leave home to cultivate the path.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “He choose the profound teaching;  
> They heard and left home with him.  
> Free of the prison of love,  
> They had none of the various bonds.

“The prince then accepted them [as disciples], and they traveled together, giving teachings in various places. From town to town and country to country, he was paid respects everywhere with the four types of service and support. The Bodhisattva thought, ‘The hustle and bustle of traveling the countries with a large assembly doesn’t suit me. When will I be free of these crowds of people? The genuine pursuit of the path is done in a secluded place; then, someone can fulfill their aspirations. In a quiet place, I could focus my efforts on cultivating the path.’

“He also thought, ‘Sentient beings are pitiable, always living in darkness and experiencing the physical frailties of birth, old age, illness, and death, that collection of myriad pains. Dying here, they’re born there, and they’re born here from elsewhere. As a result of this mass of suffering, they cycle around endlessly. When will I comprehend this mass of suffering and extinguish birth, old age, and death?’

“Again, he thought, ‘Where does birth and death come from? What’s the condition for their existence?’ He then wisely examined their source: ‘Old age and death comes from birth. Birth is the condition for old age and death. Birth arises from existence. Existence is the condition for birth. Existence arises from clinging. Clinging is the condition for existence. Clinging arises from craving. Craving is the condition for clinging. Craving arises from feeling. Feeling is the condition for craving. Feeling arises from contact. Contact is the condition for feeling. Contact arises from the six senses. The six senses are the condition for contact. The six senses arise from name and form. Name and form are the condition for the six senses. Name and form arise from consciousness. Consciousness is the condition for name and form. Consciousness arises from volition. Volition is the condition for consciousness. Volition arises from ignorance. Ignorance is the condition for volition.

“‘From the condition of ignorance, there’s volition. Volition is the condition for consciousness. Consciousness is the condition for name and form. Name and form is the condition for the six senses. The six senses are the condition for contact. Contact is the condition for feeling. Feeling is the condition for craving. Craving is the condition for clinging. Clinging is the condition for existence. Existence is the condition for birth. Birth is the condition for old age, illness, death, grief, sorrow, pain, and trouble. This whole mass of suffering exists based on the condition of birth. This is the formation of suffering.’

“When the Bodhisattva contemplated the formation of this mass of suffering, knowledge arose, vision arose, awakening arose, insight arose, comprehension arose, wisdom arose, and realization arose.

“The Bodhisattva contemplated this as well: ‘The absence of what would cause the absence of old age and death? The cessation of what would cause the cessation of old age and death?’

“He then wisely observed its origin: ‘Old age and death doesn’t exist because birth doesn’t exist. Old age and death cease because birth ceases. Birth doesn’t exist because existence doesn’t exist. Birth ceases because existence ceases. Existence doesn’t exist because clinging doesn’t exist. Existence ceases because clinging ceases. Clinging doesn’t exist because craving doesn’t exist. Clinging ceases because craving ceases. Craving doesn’t exist because feeling doesn’t exist. Craving ceases because feeling ceases. Feeling doesn’t exist because contact doesn’t exist. Feeling ceases because contact ceases. Contact doesn’t exist because the six senses don’t exist. Contact ceases because the six senses cease. The six senses don’t exist because name and form don’t exist. The six senses cease because name and form cease. Name and form don’t exist because consciousness doesn’t exist. Name and form cease because consciousness ceases. Consciousness doesn’t exist because volition doesn’t exist. Consciousness ceases because volition ceases. Volition doesn’t exist because ignorance doesn’t exist. Volition ceases because ignorance ceases.

“‘It’s because ignorance ceases that volition ceases. Consciousness ceases because volition ceases. Name and form cease because consciousness ceases. The six senses cease because name and form cease. Contact ceases because the six senses cease. Feeling ceases because contact ceases. Craving ceases because feeling ceases. Clinging ceases because craving ceases. Existence ceases because clinging ceases. Birth ceases because existence ceases. Old age, death, grief, sorrow, pain, and trouble cease because birth ceases.’

When the Bodhisattva contemplated the cessation of this mass of suffering, knowledge arose, vision arose, awakening arose, insight arose, comprehension arose, wisdom arose, and realization arose.”

“The Bodhisattva then observed these twelve causal conditions in forward and reverse order. When he truly knew and saw them, he achieved the supreme, correct, and complete awakening right there on his seat.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “These words I say to the assembly,  
> All of you should pay close attention to them.  
> That past bodhisattva contemplated  
> Principles he’d never heard before.

> ‘What’s the condition for old age and death?  
> What cause is there for them to exist?’  
> Having thus correctly observed them,  
> He knew the source from which they arose.

> ‘What condition is the root of birth?  
> What cause is there for it to exist?’  
> Having thus contemplated it,  
> He knew that birth arises from existence.

> Having clung to this and clung to that,  
> One cycles through further existences.  
> Therefore, the Tathāgata teaches  
> That clinging is the condition for existence.

> Like a pile of different kinds of filth  
> Blown all around by the wind,  
> Clinging thus causes clinging,  
> Which proliferates because of craving.

> Craving arises from feeling  
> And then the snare of suffering takes root.  
> Conditioned by its obsession,  
> Pain and pleasure become associated.

> ‘What condition is the root of feeling?  
> What cause is there for feeling to exist?’  
> Having contemplated this,  
> He knew feeling arises from contact.

> ‘What condition is the root of contact?  
> What cause is there for contact to exist?’  
> Having contemplated this,  
> [He knew] contact arises from the six senses.

> ‘What is the root of the six senses?  
> What cause is there for six senses to exist?’  
> Having contemplated this,  
> [He knew] six senses arise from name and form.

> ‘What condition is the root of name and form?  
> What cause is there for name and form to exist?’  
> Having contemplated this,  
> [He knew] name and form arise from consciousness.

> ‘What condition is the root of consciousness?  
> What cause is there for consciousness to exist?’  
> Having contemplated this,  
> He knew consciousness arises from volition.

> ‘What condition is the root of volition?  
> What cause is there for volition to exist?’  
> Having contemplated this,  
> He knew that volition arises from ignorance.

> Such causes and conditions  
> Are called the true meaning of causation.  
> With wise and skillful observation,  
> He saw the root of dependent origination.

> Suffering is not a noble creation,  
> Nor does it exist without reason.  
> Therefore, the discomfort of change  
> Is what wise people eliminate.

> If ignorance completely ceases,  
> Then there’s no volition.  
> If there isn’t any volition,  
> Then there isn’t any consciousness, either.

> If consciousness is forever ceased,  
> There isn’t any name and form.  
> When name and form have ceased,  
> Then there aren’t any senses.

> If the senses are forever ceased,  
> Then there isn’t any contact.  
> If contact is forever ceased,  
> Then there isn’t any feeling, either.

> If feeling is forever ceased,  
> Then there isn’t any craving.  
> If craving is forever ceased,  
> Then there isn’t any clinging, either.

> If clinging is forever ceased,  
> Then there isn’t any existence.  
> If existence is forever ceased,  
> Then there isn’t any birth, either.

> If birth is forever ceased,  
> There’s no old age, illness, or mass of suffering.  
> The complete and eternal end of this,  
> That’s what’s taught by the wise.

> These twelve conditions are profound,  
> Hard to see, and hard to recognize.  
> Only a buddha can fully realize:  
> ‘Depending on that, this exists or doesn’t exist.’

> If someone can examine this themselves,  
> Then they won’t have various senses.  
> Deeply seeing dependent origination,  
> They won’t seek teachers outside themselves.

> Regarding the aggregates, elements, and senses,  
> They’re secluded from desire and undefiled.  
> They’re worthy of all gifts  
> And grace their benefactors with pure rewards.

> Attaining four techniques of discernment,  
> They win the realization of certainty.  
> They free themselves from many bonds,  
> Eliminating them with carefulness.

> Form, feeling, conception, volition, and consciousness  
> Are like a rotten, old cart.  
> Carefully observing this principle,  
> They achieve the correct and complete awakening.

> He was like a bird flying through the sky  
> As it follows the wind east or west,  
> The Bodhisattva broke the many bonds;  
> He was like a light cloth flapping in the wind.

> Vipaśyin in quietude  
> Examined these principles:  
> ‘What’s the condition for old age and death to exist?  
> What would cause them to cease?’

> After those investigations,  
> Pure wisdom arose in him.  
> He knew old age and death come from birth,  
> And old age and death cease when birth does.

“When Buddha Vipaśyin first achieved awakening, he often cultivated two contemplations: First was contemplation of safety, and second was contemplation of escape.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “The Tathāgata, being equal to the unequaled,  
> Often cultivated two contemplations:  
> That of safety and escape.  
> He was a sage who crossed to the other shore.

> His mind gained its freedom,  
> Having broken the many bonds.  
> He climbed the mountain and looked all around,  
> So he was called Vipaśyin.

> The light of great wisdom dispels darkness  
> Like seeing oneself with a mirror.  
> He eliminated anguish for the world,  
> Ended the pains of birth, old age, and death.

“While in a quiet place, Buddha Vipaśyin also had this thought: ‘Now, I’ve attained this unsurpassed teaching that’s profound, subtle, hard to understand, hard to see, calming, pure, known by the wise, and not within the reach of ordinary fools. This is because sentient beings of different tenets and different views who accept different things, and have different trainings. Based on their different views, they each pursue their delights and work for their livelihood. They therefore can’t understand this profound dependent origination, but Nirvāṇa’s end of craving is doubly hard to know. If I were to teach it, they surely wouldn’t understand, and I’d be troubled by it.’ After having this thought, he remained silent and didn’t go on to teach the Dharma.

“Knowing what the Buddha Vipaśyin was thinking, the Brahma King thought to himself, ‘Now, it’ll be very sad when this world is destroyed. Buddha Vipaśyin has attained knowledge of this profound and subtle teaching, but he doesn’t want to teach it!’ In the time it takes a strong man to flex his arm, Brahmā instantly came down from his Brahma Heaven palace to stand in front of the Buddha. He bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet and withdrew to stand to one side.

“The Brahma King knelt on his right knee and saluted the Buddha with his palms together. He said, ‘Please, Bhagavān, use this time to teach the Dharma! These sentient beings today have weakened their defilements, their faculties are strong, they’re respectful, and they are readily educated. Fearing the afterlife and having no salvation from misdeeds, they can desist from their evil ways and be born in good destinies.’

“That Buddha told the Brahma King, ‘So it is, so it is! It’s as you say. I just thought to myself while in a quiet place, “The correct Dharma that I’ve attained is profound and subtle. If I taught it to others, they surely wouldn’t understand, and I’d be troubled by it. So, I’ll remain silent, not wanting to teach the Dharma. I’ve gone through countless eons of hardship without quitting and cultivated the unsurpassed practice. Now, I’ve won this hard to get Dharma for the first time. If I taught it to lustful, hateful, and ignorant sentient beings, they surely wouldn’t put it into practice. It would be pointless and wearisome. This teaching is subtle and contradicts the world. Sentient beings who are defiled by desire and benighted by foolishness can’t be confident about it. Brahma King, I observe this to be so. That’s why I’ve remained silent and don’t want to teach the Dharma.’

“The Brahma King repeated his entreaty three times in earnest: ‘Bhagavān, if the Dharma isn’t taught now, then it’ll be very sad when the world is destroyed. Please, Bhagavān, take this time to expound it. Don’t let sentient beings fall to other destinies!’

“The Bhagavān listened to the Brahma King repeat his entreaty three times, and then he looked at the world with his buddha eye. Sentient beings had weakened their defilements whether their faculties were sharp and dull, so teaching them would be hard with some and easy with others. Those who easily accepted the teaching feared their misdeeds in the afterlife, so they could desist from their evil ways and be born in good destinies. They were like _utpala_ flowers, _padma_ flowers, _kumuda_ flowers, and _puṇḍarīka_ flowers. Whether they’re beginning to grow from the muck but haven’t emerged from the water, they’ve grown enough to emerged from the water, or they’ve emerged from the water but have yet to bloom, they’ll easily bloom once they don’t have the water’s [muck] clinging to them. The world’s sentient beings were likewise.

“The Bhagavān told the Brahma King, ‘I do pity all of you. I will disclose the Dharma entrance of ambrosia now. This teaching is profound, subtle, and difficult to understand, but I will teach those who’ll believe, accept, and enjoy listening to it. I won’t teach those who’ll be troublesome or gain nothing from it.’

“When the Brahma King recognized that that Buddha had accepted his request, he rejoiced and celebrated. He circled the Buddha three times, bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet, and instantly disappeared.

“Not long after he was gone, the Tathāgata then thought to himself, ‘Now, who will be the first person I teach the Dharma?’ Then he thought, ‘I’ll go to Bandhuvatī. The King’s son Tiṣya and the prime minister’s son Khaṇḍa will be the first to whom I’ll reveal the Dharma entrance of ambrosia.’

“Thereupon, in the time it takes a strong man to flex his arm, the Bhagavān instantly disappeared from that tree of awakening and went to King’s deer preserve near Bandhuvatī. He prepared a seat there and sat down.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “Like a lion living in the forest,  
> Wandering wherever it pleases,  
> That Buddha was likewise:  
> His travels were unimpeded.

“The Buddha Vipaśyin addressed the park’s warden, ‘Please go to the city and tell the King’s son Tiṣya and the prime minister’s son Khaṇḍa, “Did you know? The Buddha Vipaśyin is residing in the deer preserve. He would like to see you. It would be a good time for it.”

“The park’s warden accepted this instruction and left. He went to those two men and told them both what the Buddha had said. When the two had heard this, then went to the Buddha, bowed their heads at his feet, and withdrew to sit to one side.

“The Buddha gradually taught the Dharma, teaching, instructing, profiting, and delighting them. He discussed generosity, precepts, how to be born in heaven, that desire was bad and impure, and the trouble of the higher contaminants. He praised their escape as the most subtle, pure, and supreme.

“The Bhagavān then saw that those two men’s minds were softened, joyous, confident, and ready to accept the correct teaching. He taught them the noble truth of suffering, expounding and disclosing it. He discerned and interpreted the noble truth of suffering’s formation, the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, and the noble truth of suffering’s escape.

“The King’s son Tiṣya and the prime minister’s son Khaṇḍa were freed from dust and defilement right there on their seats, and their vision of the Dharma was purified. They were like a white cloth ready to accept a dye.

“At that moment, the spirit of the earth announced, ‘In the deer preserve of Bandhuvatī, the Tathāgata Vipaśyin has turned the unsurpassed Dharma wheel that couldn’t be turned by ascetics or priests, gods such as Māra and Brahmā, or any other worldly person.’ Thus, as it made the rounds, its voice was clearly heard by the four god kings … the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods. In an instant, its voice reached the Brahma heavens.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “Rejoicing and celebrating,  
> [The gods] praised the Tathāgata:  
> ‘Vipaśyin became a buddha  
> And turned the unsurpassed Dharma wheel!’

> First rising from the king of trees,  
> He went to Bandhuvatī.  
> For Khaṇḍa and Tiṣya,  
> He turned the Dharma wheel of four truths.

> Khaṇḍa and Tiṣya  
> Accepted the Buddha’s teaching and converted.  
> From that pure Dharma wheel,  
> There was no higher religious life.

> The host of the Trāyastriṃśa gods  
> And Śakra the Lord of Gods  
> Rejoiced at its turning and said,  
> ‘There’s no god who hasn’t heard:  
> “A Buddha has arisen in the world  
> And turned the unsurpassed Dharma wheel!”  
> The host of gods will increase,  
> And that of asuras will diminish!’

> His name went up to be heard everywhere;  
> His skillful wisdom left the limits of the world.  
> Having mastered the teachings,  
> He turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

> Investigating the equal Dharma,  
> His calmed heart was unpolluted.  
> Free of the yoke of birth and death,  
> He turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

> To cease pain and part with many evils,  
> He escaped desire and attained freedom.  
> Having left the prison of love,  
> He turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

> Being a completely awakened sage among humans,  
> The exalted trainer of bipeds,  
> He freed himself from all bonds  
> And turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

> He was a teacher and skilled guide  
> Who vanquished the Māra foe.  
> Having departed from all evils,  
> He turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

> His uncontaminated power defeated Māra,  
> His faculties focused and not neglectful.  
> Contamination ended, Māra’s bonds gone,  
> He turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

> He learned that certain principle,  
> Knowing that all things are not self.  
> With this the best of principles,  
> He turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

> He didn’t do it for profit,  
> Nor was he looking for renown.  
> It was out of pity for other sentient beings,  
> That he turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

> He saw sentient beings’ pain and disaster;  
> They were oppressed by old age, illness, and death.  
> Because of these three bad destinies,  
> He turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

> Ending greed, anger, and delusion,  
> He pulled up the root of craving.  
> Unmoved and liberated,  
> He turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

> He’d won the hard victory over self;  
> After that, he’d mastered himself.  
> Having won that and the hard victory over Māra,  
> He turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

> This unsurpassed Dharma wheel  
> Can only be turned by a Buddha.  
> The gods like Māra, Śakra, and Brahmā  
> Are incapable of setting it in motion.

> Being near when the Dharma wheel turns  
> Is a blessing to the host of gods and humans.  
> This Teacher of Gods and Humans  
> Discovered the way to cross to the other shore.

“At that point, the King’s son Tiṣya and the prime minister’s son Khaṇḍa saw the Dharma and obtained its fruit truly and without pretense, and they became confident. They then said to Buddha Vipaśyin, ‘We’d like to cultivate the pure religious practice in the Tathāgata’s teaching!’

“The Buddha said, ‘Welcome, monks! My Dharma is pure and free. Cultivating it will bring an end to suffering.’

“Those two men then were given the full precepts. They hadn’t had those precepts long before the Tathāgata taught them three subjects: First was miraculous abilities, second was observing others’ minds, and third was admonishment. They then attained the freedom of the uncontaminated heart, and unshakable knowledge arose in them.

“At the time, a great many people in the city of Bandhuvatī heard about those two men who had left home to train on the path, put on Dharma robes, carried bowls, and purely cultivated the religious life. They said to each other, ‘That path must be genuine to make them both give up their stations of worldly prosperity. That’s a serious thing to discard!’

“In that city, there were 84,000 people who visited Buddha Vipaśyin in the deer preserve. They bowed their heads at his feet and withdrew to sit at one side. The Buddha gradually taught the Dharma, teaching, instructing, profiting, and delighting them. He discussed generosity, precepts, how to be born in heaven, that desire was bad and impure, and the trouble of the higher contaminants. He praised their escape as the most subtle, pure, and supreme.

“That Bhagavān then saw that the minds of this great assembly were softened, joyous, confident, and ready to accept the correct teaching. He then taught them the noble truth of suffering, expounding and disclosing it. He discerned and interpreted the noble truth of suffering’s formation, the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, and the noble truth of suffering’s escape.

“Those 84,000 people then became free of dust and defilement right there on their seats, and their vision of the Dharma was purified. They were like a white cloth ready to accept a dye. They saw the Dharma and obtained its fruit truly and without pretense, and they became confident. They said to the Buddha, ‘We’d like to cultivate the pure religious practice in the Tathāgata’s teaching!’

“The Buddha said, ‘Welcome, monks! My Dharma is pure and free. Cultivating it will bring an end to suffering.’

“Those 84,000 people then were given the full precepts. They hadn’t had those precepts long before the Tathāgata taught them three subjects: First was miraculous abilities, second was observing others’ minds, and third was admonishment. They then attained the freedom of the uncontaminated heart, and unshakable knowledge arose in them.

“Another 84,000 people heard that the Buddha was in the deer preserve and had turned the unsurpassed Dharma wheel that couldn’t be turned by ascetics or priests, gods such as Māra and Brahmā, or any other worldly person. They then went to Bandhuvatī to visit Buddha Vipaśyin, bowed their heads at his feet, and withdrew to sit to one side.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> To help someone whose head is on fire,  
> One looks quickly for a way to extinguish it.  
> Those people were likewise;  
> They went quickly to the Tathāgata.

“The Buddha taught the Dharma in the same way. Then, there were 168,000 people in Bandhuvatī who formed a great assembly of monks. The monks Tiṣya and Khaṇḍa rose up into the sky over that great assembly, and fire and water issued from their bodies. They performed such miracles and then taught the subtle Dharma for the assembly.

“The Tathāgata then thought to himself, ‘Now, there’s a great assembly of 168,000 monks in this city. They ought to travel from place to place in pairs for six years. When they return to the city, I’ll teach them the full precepts.’

“The Śuddhāvāsa gods then knew what the Tathāgata was thinking. In the time it takes a strong man to flex his arm, they disappeared from their heaven and instantly reappeared in front of the Bhagavān. They bowed their heads at his feet and withdrew to stand to one side. That instant, they said to the Buddha, ‘So it is, Bhagavān! There’s a great assembly of monks in this city. They ought to travel from place to place in pairs for six years. When they return to the city, teach them the full precepts. We will keep them safe and prevent anyone from taking advantage of them.’

“When he heard what the gods said, the Tathāgata silently accepted it.

“The Śuddhāvāsa gods saw the Buddha silently give his consent. They bowed at the Buddha’s feet and instantly disappeared, returning to their heaven above. Not long after they left, the Buddha told the monks, ‘Now, there’s a great assembly of monks in the city. You ought to each go out traveling and teaching. After six years, return and gather for the teaching of the precepts.’

“After accepting the Buddha’s teaching, the monks then took their robes and bowls, bowed to the Buddha, and departed.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “All that Buddha’s assembly was undisturbed,  
> Being without desire or attachments.  
> Majestic like _garuḍa_ birds,  
> They took off like cranes from a lake.

“A year later, the Śuddhāvāsa gods told the monks, ‘Since you’ve been traveling a year has passed. Five years remain. Remember, after six years have passed, you are to return to the city for the teaching of the precepts.’

“In this way, the sixth year arrived, and the gods again told them, ‘A full six years have passed. You should return for the teaching of the precepts.’

After hearing what the gods said, the monks gathered up their robes and bowls and returned to Bandhuvatī. They went to Buddha Vipaśyin in the deer preserve, bowed their heads at his feet, and withdrew to sit to one side.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “Like well-trained elephants that do  
> Whatever the handler wishes,  
> That great assembly was likewise  
> As they returned as instructed.

“That Tathāgata then rose into the air above the great assembly in a cross-legged sitting posture and taught them the Precepts Sūtra: ‘Tolerance is best. The Buddha teaches that Nirvāṇa is the highest. One doesn’t become an ascetic by cutting off their hair and beard and then harming others.’

“They hadn’t gone far from the Buddha when the Śuddhāvāsa gods spoke these verses:

> “‘The Tathāgata’s great wisdom  
> Is sublime and uniquely venerable.  
> He perfected calm observation  
> And achieved the supreme, complete awakening.

> Out of pity for all beings,  
> He achieving awakening in the world.  
> Using the four truths,  
> He taught his disciples:

> Suffering, suffering’s cause,  
> The truth of its cessation,  
> And the noble eightfold path  
> Arrive at the place of safety.

> Buddha Vipaśyin  
> Appeared in the world;  
> In the midst of a great assembly,  
> He was as dazzling as the sun.’

“After reciting these verses, they instantly disappeared.”

The Bhagavān then told the monks, “I thought to myself, ‘Once, I was on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa at Rājagṛha, and this thought occurred to me, “I’ve been born everywhere but the Śuddhāvāsa Heaven. If I were born in that heaven, I wouldn’t return to this world.”’

“Monks, I’ve also had this thought: ‘I want to go up to the Avṛha Heaven above.’ In the time it takes for a strong man to flex his arm, I then disappeared here and appeared in that heaven.

“When they saw me arrive, the gods there bowed their heads and stood to one side. They said to me, ‘We were disciples of Tathāgata Vipaśyin. We were reborn here because that Buddha’s instruction. We recite the history of that buddha as well as that of Buddha Śikhin, Buddha Viśvabhū, Buddha Krakucchanda, Buddha Kanakamuni, Buddha Kāśyapa, and Buddha Śākyamuni. They were our teachers. We were reborn here because of their training.’

“They also recited the history of buddhas, those gods who were born … in the Akaniṣṭha Heaven. It was the same there.”

The Buddha then spoke in verse:

> “In the time it takes a strong man  
> To flex his arm for a moment,  
> I used my miraculous abilities  
> To go to the Avṛha Heaven.

> I was the seventh great sage  
> To defeat the two Māras;  
> When the Atapa gods saw me,  
> They saluted and venerated me.

> Like the pārijāta tree,  
> The Śākya teacher was famous far and wide.  
> Having all the signs and excellencies,  
> I arrived at the Sudarśana Heaven.

> I was like a lotus flower  
> With no water clinging to it.  
> The Bhagavān was undefiled  
> When he arrived at Mahāsudarśana.

> I was like the sun at daybreak,  
> Clear, without specks or blurriness.  
> Bright like the autumn moon,  
> I visited Akaniṣṭha once.

> These are the five dwelling places  
> Of purified sentient beings  
> Born there because of their hearts were pure;  
> I visited the unafflicted.

> Those pure hearts who are born there  
> Were disciples of buddhas.  
> They discarded defiled clinging,  
> Were happy clinging to nothing.

> Seeing the Dharma with certainty,  
> Those disciples of Vipaśyin  
> With pure hearts welcomed  
> A visit from the great sage of humans.

> The disciples of Buddha Śikhin  
> Were unsullied and unconditioned.  
> They welcomed with pure hearts  
> A visit from the sage who left existence.

> The disciples of Viśvabhū  
> Fully possessed the faculties.  
> With pure hearts, they visited me  
> Like the sun shining in the sky.

> The disciples of Krakucchanda  
> Had renounced their desires.  
> With pure hearts, they visited me  
> Resplendent with sublime light.

> The disciples of Kanakamuni  
> Were unsullied and unconditioned.  
> With pure hearts, they visited me  
> Bright like the full moon.

> The disciples of Kāśyapa  
> Fully possessed the faculties.  
> With pure hearts, they visited me  
> As though thinking of the northern sky.

> Those undisturbed great sages  
> Were supreme in miraculous abilities.  
> With steadfast minds,  
> They were disciples of those buddhas.

> Those pure hearts reborn  
> Who were disciples of buddhas,  
> They venerated the Tathāgata  
> And fully informed the sage of humans:

> ‘Such were their births that achieved the path,  
> Their names, surnames, and types of tribes,  
> The profound teachings they saw and knew,  
> And their achievement of unsurpassed awakening.

> Dwelling in quietude, their monks  
> Were freed from dust and defilement.  
> Earnest and not neglectful,  
> They broke the bonds of existence.’

> These were the buddhas’  
> Histories from beginning to end.  
> The Tathāgata of the Śākyas  
> Has expounded them.”

After he had taught this Sūtra of the Great Legend, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
