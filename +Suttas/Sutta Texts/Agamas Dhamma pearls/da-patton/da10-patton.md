### 10. Going Up to Ten

1. Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha traveled to Aṅga accompanied by a great assembly of 1,250 monks. They went to the city of Campā and stayed near Lake Gargarā.

2. On the fifteenth-day full moon, the Bhagavān sat in an open area with a great assembly surrounding him. After teaching the Dharma all night, he addressed Śāriputra, “The monks have gathered today from the four directions. They’ve all diligently shaken off their sleepiness and want to listen to a Dharma teaching, but I’m suffering from back pain. I’m going to take a break. You can teach the Dharma for the monks now.”

3. Śāriputra accepted the Buddha’s instruction. The Bhagavān then folded his outer robe four times and laid on his right side like a lion with his feet together.

4. The senior Śāriputra then addressed the monks, “I will teach the Dharma now. Its words are true in the beginning, middle, and end, its content and meaning are complete, and it purifies the religious life. All of you, listen closely, and consider it well. I will teach it for you.”

The monks accepted his instructions and listened.

5. Śāriputra told the monks, “There are teachings that go up to ten which remove the manifold bonds, reach _nirvāṇa_, and completely end suffering. They also perfect 550 things. Now, I will discern them. All of you, listen well!

What are the five? [1] If a monk hears the Buddha teach Dharma, hears a teaching by a religious practitioner, or hears a teaching by a senior teacher, he considers, investigates, and discerns the teaching and its meaning, and his heart rejoices. Once he rejoices, he gains a love of Dharma. Once he gains a love of Dharma, his body and mind become peaceful. Once his body and mind are peaceful, he attains _samādhi_.

He’s only mindful of escaping them and enjoys being far from them. He befriends non-negligence and disciplines his mind. Escaping and being free of desires, the arising of contaminants caused by those desires is also entirely abandoned and ceased, and he becomes liberated. This is the escape from desire. _[2] The escape from anger, [3] escape from jealousy, [4] escape from form, and [5] escape from belief in the individual are likewise._

Don’t misrepresent the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata doesn’t say, “I’d like to cultivate the liberation of kindness, but then notions of anger arise.” That’s impossible. The Buddha says, “Once anger is gone, then one becomes kind afterward.”’

61. “Suppose a monk says, [2] ‘I’d practice the liberation of compassion, but then I have hateful thoughts.’… [3] ‘practice the liberation of joy, but then I have sorrowful thoughts.’ … [4] ‘practice the liberation of equanimity, but then I have thoughts of like or dislike.’ … [5] ‘cultivate the practice of non-self, but then I have suspicious thoughts’ … [6] ‘cultivate the practice without conception, but then I have many distracting notions.’ _Those cases are likewise._

[1] The Tathāgata, the Arhat, arises in the world and teaches the sublime teaching that’s quiescent, unconditioned, and leads to the path of awakening. A person who’s born in hell has no opportunity there to cultivate the religious practice.

106. “[2] The Tathāgata, the Arhat, arises in the world and teaches the sublime teaching that’s quiescent, unconditioned, and leads to the path of awakening. There are sentient beings born among animals … [3] among hungry ghosts … [4] among long-lived gods … [5] in border lands where they are unaware of it. The Buddha’s teaching doesn’t exist in such places, so there’s no opportunity to cultivate the religious practice.

107. “[6] The Tathāgata, the Arhat, arises in the world and teaches the sublime teaching that’s quiescent, unconditioned, and leads to the path of awakening. Some sentient beings are born in a central country, but they have wrong views, harbor deluded thoughts, and commit evil deeds. They’ll surely go to hell where there’s no opportunity to cultivate the religious practice.

108. “[7] The Tathāgata, the Arhat, arises in the world and teaches the sublime teaching that’s quiescent, unconditioned, and leads to the path of awakening. Some sentient beings are born in a central country, but they’re deaf, blind, or mute and can’t learn the teaching. They have no opportunity to cultivate the religious practice.

109. “[8] The Tathāgata, the Arhat, doesn’t arise in the world, and no one teaches the sublime teaching that’s quiescent, unconditioned, and leads to the path of awakening. Some sentient beings are born in a central country, and their faculties are complete. They are worthy of the noble teaching, but they don’t meet a buddha, so they can’t cultivate the religious practice. This is the eighth case of having no opportunity.

The path should be a focused mind; a distracted mind is not the path. The path should be wise; foolishness is not the path.

114. “Without an inner perception of form, one observes external form to be measureless. Whether it’s beautiful or ugly, they continuously observe and attend to it. This is the fourth change to the senses.

115. “Without an inner perception of form, one observes external form to be blue. The blue form, blue reflection, and blue sight are like a blue lotus flower or a blue Vārāṇasī cloth. They are completely blue forms, blue reflections, and blue sights. Creating such a perception, one continuously observes and attends to it. This is the fifth change to the senses.

116. “Without an inner perception of form, one observes external form to be yellow. The yellow form, yellow reflection, and yellow sight are like a yellow flower or a yellow Vārāṇasī cloth. They are completely yellow forms, yellow reflections, and yellow sights. Creating such a perception, one continuously observes and attends to it. This is the sixth change to the senses.

117. “Without an inner perception of form, one observes external form that’s red. The red form, red reflection, and red sight are like a red flower or a red Vārāṇasī cloth. They are completely red forms, red reflections, and red sights. Creating such a perception, one continuously observes and attends to it. This is the seventh change to the senses.

118. “Without an inner perception of form, one observes external form to be white. The white form, white reflection, and white sight are like a white flower or a white Vārāṇasī cloth. They are completely white forms, white reflections, and white sights. Creating such a perception, one continuously observes and attends to it. This is the eighth change to the senses.

119. “What are eight things to be realized? The eight liberations: Form observed to be form is the first liberation. Observing external form without an internal perception of form is the second liberation. The liberation of purity is the third liberation. Going beyond notions of form, ceasing notions of anger, and abiding in the abode of space is the fourth liberation. Going beyond the abode of space and abiding in the abode of awareness is the fifth liberation. Going beyond the abode of awareness and abiding in the abode of nothingness is the sixth liberation. Going beyond the abode of nothingness and abiding in the abode with and without conception is the seventh liberation. Going beyond the abode with and without conception and abiding in the cessation of concepts and perceptions is the eighth liberation.

120. “Monks, these eighty things are true and not false. They’ve been known by the Tathāgata who teaches the Dharma equally.
