# The Long Discourses
Translated by Charles Patton
## Part II

### 11. Increasing One by One

1. Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī. He was accompanied by a great assembly of 1,250 monks.

2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will give you a discourse on the sublime teaching in which all the words in the beginning, middle, and end are true, the content and expression are pure, and the religious life is perfected. It’s called the teaching that increases one by one. All of you, listen closely and consider it well! I will teach it for you.”

The monks then accepted the teaching and listened.

#### The Ones

3. The Buddha told the monks, “This is the teaching that increases one by one: There’s one thing to be achieved, one thing to be cultivated, one thing to be recognized, one thing to be ceased, and one thing to be realized.

4. “What’s the one thing to be achieved? It’s not abandoning the good Dharma. What’s the one thing to be cultivated? Constant mindfulness of oneself. What’s the one thing to be recognized? Contaminated contact. What’s the one thing to be ceased? The conceit of having a self. What’s the one thing to be realized? It’s the freedom of an unobstructed mind.

#### The Twos

5. “There are also two things to be achieved, two things to be cultivated, two things to be recognized, two things to be ceased, and two things to be realized.

6. “What are two things to be achieved? Knowing conscience and modesty. What are two things to be cultivated? Calm and contemplation. What are two things to be recognized? Name and form. What are two things to be ceased? Ignorance and craving for existence. What are two things to be realized? Insight and liberation.

#### The Threes

7. “There are also three things to be achieved, three things to be cultivated, three things to be recognized, three things to be ceased, and three things to be realized.

8. “What are three things to be achieved? First is making good friends. Second is listening to the voice of Dharma. Third is accomplishing [consecutive] teachings.

9. “What are three things to be cultivated? They are the three _samādhi_s: the _samādhi_ of emptiness, the _samādhi_ without attributes, and the _samādhi_ without actions.

10. “What are three things to be recognized? They are the three feelings: painful feelings, pleasant feelings, and feelings that are neither painful or pleasant.

11. “What are three things to be ceased? They are three cravings: craving of desires, craving for existence, and craving to not exist.

12. “What are three things to be realized? They are the three insights: the knowledge of past lives, the knowledge of the heavenly eye, and the knowledge that the contaminants are ended.

#### The Fours

13. “There are also four things to be achieved, four things to be cultivated, four things to be recognized, four things to be ceased, and four things to be realized.

14. “What are four things to be achieved? First is living in a central country. Second is staying close to good friends. Third is guarding oneself. Fourth is having planted roots of goodness in the past.

15. “What are four things to be cultivated? The four abodes of mindfulness: [1] A monk observes internal body as body diligently and not negligently. He doesn’t lose that recollection and abandons worldly greed and sorrow. He observes internal and external body as body, diligently and not negligently. He doesn’t lose that recollection and abandons worldly greed and sorrow. _He likewise observes [2] feelings, [3] mind, and [4] teachings._

#### The Fives
