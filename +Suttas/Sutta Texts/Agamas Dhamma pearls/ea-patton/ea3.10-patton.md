## Chapter 3: Broader Explanations

10. Recollecting Death
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “One should cultivate one thing and disseminate one thing. After cultivating this one thing, they’ll become well known and achieve a great reward and all good and complete attainments. They’ll attain the sweet-tasting dew and arrive at the unconditioned state. They then will achieve spiritual knowledge, dispel their confused ideas, win the fruits of the ascetic, and bring about _nirvāṇa_ themselves. What’s this one thing? It’s called recollecting death.”
3. The Buddha addressed the monks, “How does someone who cultivates the recollection of death become well known, achieve a great reward and all good and complete attainments, attain the sweet-tasting dew, and arrive at the unconditioned state? How do they achieve spiritual knowledge, dispel their confused ideas, win the fruits of the ascetic, and bring about _nirvāṇa_ themselves?”
The monks then said to the Bhagavān, “What the Tathāgata says is the source of the teachings. Please, Bhagavān, explain the wonderful meaning of this for the monks. After we hear it from the Tathāgata, the monks will accept and retain it.”
4. The Bhagavān then told the monks, “Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well. I will discern this for you in detail.”
They replied, “Yes, Bhagavān.”
5. Once the monks had accepted the teaching, the Bhagavān told them, “Suppose a monk sits cross-legged with correct posture and thought and fixes his attention on what’s in front of him. With no other idea, he focuses on recollecting death.
6. “‘Death’ means disappearing here and being born there, rebirth among the destinies, life departing and being unstable, and the limbs crumbling like rotten wood. The life faculty comes to an end, and one leaves tribe and clan without shape, echo, or appearance.
7. “This is how someone who cultivates the recollection of death will become well known,<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] achieve a great reward and all good and complete attainments, attain the sweet-tasting dew, and arrive at the unconditioned state. They’ll achieve spiritual knowledge, dispel their confused ideas, win the fruits of the ascetic, and bring about _nirvāṇa_ themselves.
8. “Therefore, monks, one should constantly recollect death and not part from it. Then, they’ll win these good virtues. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
9. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
Summary Verse
- [1] The Buddha, [2] Dharma, and [3] noble Saṅgha    
    … _up to_ … the last [10] recollection of death.    
    Although they share the same name,    
    Their meanings each are special.

### Notes

[^1]: For the source text, cf. [T125.2.556c13-7a9]. This _sūtra_ is an expanded explanation of [EĀ 2.10](../02/EA_02_10.html). [↩︎](#fnref1)

[^2]: _This is how … well known._ C. 如是，諸比丘，名曰念死。便得具足⋯. The Taisho edition appears to be corrupt, for it omits mention of becoming well known. Lit., it reads: “Thus, monks, is called ‘recollecting death.’ Then, attaining its perfection …”. I’ve translated the passage assuming that the original followed the format of the initial _sūtra_s in this chapter (i.e., 「是謂，諸比丘，若念死者便有名譽⋯」).
