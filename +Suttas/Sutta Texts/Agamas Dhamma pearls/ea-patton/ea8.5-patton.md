## Chapter 8: Asura

5. The Darkness
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There’s one person who appears in the world and destroys the great darkness of ignorance himself. At the time, ordinary deluded men are bound up by this ignorance. They don’t truly know the destinations of birth and death, and they cycle through present and later lives. Having gone from eon to eon without understanding, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, and the Correctly and Perfectly Awakened One appears in the world and destroys the great darkness of ignorance himself.
3. “Therefore, monks, always be mindful and obey the Tathāgata. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
4. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
