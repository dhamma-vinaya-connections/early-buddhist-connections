### Translating Classical Buddhism to Modern English
### Translator: Charles Patton

## Chapter 8: Asura

6. The Factors of the Path
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks: “When one person appears in the world, the thirty-seven factors of the path appear in the world. What are the thirty-seven factors of the path? It’s the four abodes of mindfulness,<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] four mental abandonments,<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3] four spiritual abilities, five faculties, five powers, seven factors of awakening,and eight true practices<a id="fnref4"></a>[^4] that then appear in the world. Who is that one person? He is called the Tathāgata, the Arhat, and the Correctly and Perfectly Awakened One.
3. “Therefore, monks, always obey the Buddha. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
4. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

[^1]: For the source text, cf. [T125.2.561b18-25]. [↩︎](#fnref1)

[^2]: _four abodes of mindfulness_. C. 四意止, G. _cadu spaduvaṭ́hana_, S. _catvāri smṛty-upasthānāni_, P. _cattāro satipaṭṭhāna_. This is an older C. translation that lit. means four “mental calmings,” or perhaps “mental stops.” [↩︎](#fnref2)

[^3]: _four mental abandonments_. C. 四意斷, S. _catvāri samyakprahāṇāni_, P. _cattāro sammappadhāna_. It would appear that a phonetic change of S. _pradhāna_ (P. _padhāna_) resulted in the equiv. of S. _prahāṇa_ (G. _prahana_) being adopted in many Buddhist texts. As a result, early C. translations often interpreted “four right efforts” as “four right abandonments,” as this was the literal meaning of S. _prahāṇa_. Here, the term 意 has been added by the C. translator to convey the psychological nature of the concept, which involves avoiding bad things and nurturing good ones that arise in one’s mind. [↩︎](#fnref3)

[^4]: _eight true practices_. C. 八真行. This may be an alterate epithet for the eightfold path, perhaps equiv. to S. _aṣṭa sucaritāni_. _Sucarita_ (“practiced well”) was often translated to C. as “wonderful conduct” (妙行), so it’s conceivable that 真行 could translate this term, too. Elsewhere in EĀ, the noble eightfold path is translated as we would expect (C. 賢聖八品道).
