## Chapter 8: Asura

3. The Single-File Path
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “When one person appears in the world, the single-entry path<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] arises in the world. … the two truths … the three gateways to liberation … the true teaching of four truths … the five faculties … the cessation of six wrong views … the seven factors of awakening … the eightfold noble path … the nine abodes of sentient beings … the ten powers of the Tathāgata … the eleven liberations of kindnesss<a id="fnref3"></a>[^3] arise in the world. Who is that one person? He is called the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Correctly and Perfectly Awakened One. He is known as the one person who appears in the world, and then the single-entry path arises in the world. … the two truths … the three gateways to liberation … the true teaching of four truths … the five faculties … the cessation of six wrong views … the seven factors of awakening … the eightfold noble path … the nine abodes of sentient beings … the ten powers of the Tathāgata … the eleven liberations of kindness arise in the world.
3. “Therefore, monks, always pay respect to the Tathāgata. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
4. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

[^1]: For the source text, cf. [T125.2.561a17-29]. [↩︎](#fnref1)

[^2]: _single-entry path_. C. 一入道, P. _ekāyana magga_. Lit. “one-entry path.” In S. this term appears to mean a narrow path that allows only one person to walk at a time (Edgerton, 154). Pali interpreters seem to prefer “one-way path.” Cf. the notes to [EĀ 12.1](../12/EA_12_1.html) for more indepth comments about this term. [↩︎](#fnref2)

[^3]: _eleven liberations of kindness_. Cf. [AN 8.1], [AN 11.15], [EĀ 49.10], and [T138]. The “eleven liberations” must refer to the eleven rewards of developing kindness given in these parallels.
