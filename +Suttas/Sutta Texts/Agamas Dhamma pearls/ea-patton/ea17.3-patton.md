### Translating Classical Buddhism to Modern English

## Chapter 17: Breathing

3. Two People (2)
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, "Two people appear in the world who are very difficult to become. Who are these two people? The _pratyeka buddha_ appears in the world and is very difficult to become. The Tathāgata’s disciple who is an _arhat_ who has ended the contaminants appears in the world and is very difficult to become. These, monks, are two people who appear in the world and are very difficult to become.
3. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

[^1]: For the source text, cf. [T125.2.583a3-9]. It’s similar to [AN 2.52]-[59], but it lacks a direct parallel.
