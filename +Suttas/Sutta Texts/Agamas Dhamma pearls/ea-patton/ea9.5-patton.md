### Translating Classical Buddhism to Modern English
### Translator: Charles Patton

## Chapter 9: The Only Son

5. Downfall
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “When I continuously examine the things that a person thinks about in their mind, I see: ‘This person will fall to hell<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] in the time it takes to flex their arm.’ Why is that? Because of their evil thoughts, their mind becomes ill, and they fall down into hell.”
3. The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:
- “Suppose that a person    
    Harbors hateful notions in their heart.    
    Now, I’ll tell you monks    
    The meaning of this in detail.
- Supposing their life were to end    
    Right at this moment in time,    
    Then they would be sent to hell    
    Because of their mind’s defiled conduct.
4. “Therefore, monks, one should control their mind and not do defiled conduct. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
5. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

[^1]: For the source text, cf. [T125.2.562c18-29]. This _sūtra_ is parallel to [AN 1.43] and [Iti 20]. [↩︎](#fnref1)

[^2]: _hell_. C. 泥㴝 or 泥犂 (MC. nei-lei = G. _nara[ga]_), P/S. _naraka_. The Chinese transliterates the Indic word that was equivalent to English “hell” as a place of punishment in the afterlife. _Naraka_ literally means a pit, so a literal translation to English could be “the pit.” The next occurrence of “hell,” however, translates the Indic name to Chinese as 地獄 (lit. “earth prison”).
