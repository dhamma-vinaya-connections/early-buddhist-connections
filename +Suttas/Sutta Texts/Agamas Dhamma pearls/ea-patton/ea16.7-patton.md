## Chapter 16: The Fire Extinguished

7. The Candle
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān told the monks, “Now, I will teach you the principle of candlelight, and I’ll teach you the deeds of the path along which that candle leads. Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well.”
The monks replied, “Yes, Bhagavān.” [The monks then accepted the Buddha’s teaching.]
3. The Bhagavān then told the monks, “What is it that’s called candlelight? That refers to ending lust, anger, and delusion. What is it that’s called the deeds of the path along which that candle leads? They are right view, right control, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right method, right mindfulness, and right _samādhi_. These are called the deeds of the path along which that candle leads. I’ve taught the monks about the candlelight and also taught them about the deeds of the path along which that candle leads as a Tathāgata should. Now, I am finished. Remember and recite it well, and don’t be lazy about it. If this isn’t done now, there’ll be no comparison for your regret later.”
4. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
