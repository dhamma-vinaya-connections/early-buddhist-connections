## Chapter 9: The Only Son

6. Birth in Heaven
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “When I continuously examine the things that a person thinks about in their mind, I see: ‘This person will be born up in heaven in the time it takes to flex their arm.’ Why is that? It’s because of their good mind. Having given rise to a good mind, they’ll be born up in heaven.”
3. The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:
- “Suppose that a person    
    Produces a good and wonderful mind.    
    Now, I’ll tell you monks    
    The meaning of this in detail.
- Supposing their life were to end    
    Right at this moment in time,    
    They would be born up in heaven    
    Because of their mind’s good conduct.
4. “Therefore, monks, one should purify their thinking and not produce defiled conduct. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
5. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

[^1]: For the source text, cf. [T125.2.563a01-12]. This _sūtra_ is similar to [AN 1.44] and [Iti 21]. It’s closer to Iti 21 in format, and the concluding are also very similar to the Iti version, but this _sūtra_ adds a conclusion that was standard for EĀ. AN 1.44 includes only the prose portion of the _sūtra_.
