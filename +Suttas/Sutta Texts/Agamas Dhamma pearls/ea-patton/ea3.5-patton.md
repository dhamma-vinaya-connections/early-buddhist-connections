## Chapter 3: Broader Explanations

5. Recollecting Generosity
1. Thus I have heard:<a id="fnref1"></a>[^1] One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “One should cultivate one thing and disseminate one thing. After cultivating this one thing, they’ll become well known and achieve a great reward and all good and complete attainments. They’ll attain the sweet-tasting dew and arrive at the unconditioned state. They then will achieve spiritual knowledge, dispel their confused ideas, win the fruits of the ascetic, and bring about _nirvāṇa_ themselves. What’s this one thing? It’s called recollecting generosity.”
3. The Buddha addressed the monks, “How does someone who cultivates the recollection of generosity become well known, achieve a great reward and all good and complete attainments, attain the sweet-tasting dew, and arrive at the unconditioned state? How do they achieve spiritual knowledge, dispel their confused ideas, win the fruits of the ascetic, and bring about _nirvāṇa_ themselves?”
The monks then said to the Bhagavān, “What the Tathāgata says is the source of the teachings. Please, Bhagavān, explain the wonderful meaning of this for the monks. After we hear it from the Tathāgata, the monks will accept and retain it.”
4. The Bhagavān then told the monks, “Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well. I will discern this for you in detail.”
They replied, “Yes, Bhagavān.”
5. Once the monks had accepted the teaching, the Bhagavān told them, “Suppose a monk sits cross-legged with correct posture and thought and fixes his attention on what’s in front of him. With no other idea, he focuses on recollecting generosity.
6. “‘Now, my gift is the highest of gifts. I’ll always get its good benefits gladly without regret or ideas of compensation. If someone criticizes me, I’ll never respond in kind. Suppose someone were to hurt me by punching me, hitting me with a stick, or throwing rocks or bricks at me. I will think kindly of them and not become angry. My gift will be a generous attitude that doesn’t stop.’
7. “This is how someone who cultivates the recollection of generosity will become well known,<a id="fnref2"></a>[^2] achieve a great reward and all good and complete attainments, attain the sweet-tasting dew, and arrive at the unconditioned state. They’ll achieve spiritual knowledge, dispel their confused ideas, win the fruit of the ascetic, and bring about _nirvāṇa_ themselves.
8. “Therefore, monks, one should constantly recollect generosity and not part from it. Then, they’ll win these good virtues. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
9. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

[^1]: For the source text, cf. [T125.2.555a29-b24]. This _sūtra_ is an expanded explanation of [EĀ 2.5](../02/EA_02_05.html). [↩︎](#fnref1)

[^2]: _This is how … well known._ C. 是謂，比丘，名曰大施. The Taisho edition appears to be corrupt, for it omits mention of a recollection or becoming well known. Lit., it reads: “This, monks, is called ‘great generosity.’”. I’ve translated the passage assuming that the original followed the format of the other _sūtra_s in this chapter (i.e., 「是謂，諸比丘，若念施者便有名譽⋯」).
