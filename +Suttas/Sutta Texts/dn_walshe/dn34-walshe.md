What does this mean?” Thus his venerable teachers can reveal what is hidden and clarify obscurities, in this way helping him to solve his problems. (c) Then, having heard Dhamma from them, he achieves withdrawal (vūpakāsa), of body and mind. (d) Further, a monk is moral, he lives restrained according to the restraint of the discipline, persisting in right behaviour, seeing danger in the slightest fault, and keeping to the rules of training. Also, (e) a monk, having learnt much, remembers and bears in mind what he has learnt, and those things that are beautiful in the beginning, in the middle and in the ending, which in spirit and letter proclaim the absolutely perfected and purified holy life, he remembers and reflects on, and penetrates them with vision. Again, (f) a monk, having stirred up energy, continues to dispel unwholesome states, striving strongly and firmly, and not casting off the yoke of the wholesome. \[286\] Again, (g) a monk is mindful, with the highest mindfulness and discrimination, remembering and bearing in mind what has been done or said in the past. Also, (h) a monk continually contemplates the rise and fall of the five aggregates of grasping, thinking: “Such is material form, its arising and passing; such are feelings, such are perceptions, such are the mental formations, such is consciousness, its arising and passing.”
