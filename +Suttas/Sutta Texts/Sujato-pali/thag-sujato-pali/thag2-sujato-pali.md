## Khuddaka Nikāya - The Minor Texts

## Theragatha - The Verses of the Senior Monks

### Chapter 2: Pairs of Verses

- Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato and Jessica Walton

##### Uttarā (1st)

121No life is permanent,  
and no conditions last forever.  
The aggregates are reborn  
And pass away, again and again.

122Knowing this danger,  
I have no need for another life.  
I’ve escaped all sensual pleasures,  
and attained the end of defilements.

##### Piṇḍolabhāradvāja

123You can’t live by fasting,  
but food doesn’t lead to peace of heart.  
Seeing how this bag of bones is sustained by food,  
I wander, seeking.

124They know it’s just a swamp,  
this homage and veneration in respectable families;  
Honor is a subtle dart, hard to extract,  
and hard for a siner to give up.

##### Valliya

125A monkey went up to the little hut  
with five doors.  
He circles around, knocking  
on each door, again and again.

126Stand still monkey, don’t run!  
Things are different now;  
you’ve been caught by wisdom —  
you won’t go far.

##### Gangātīriya

127My hut on the bank of the Ganges  
is made from three palm leaves.  
my alms-bowl is a funeral pot,  
My robe is castoff rags.

128In my first two rainy seasons  
I spoke only one word.  
In my third rainy season,  
The mass of darkness was shattered.

##### Ajina

129Even a master of the three knowledges,  
undefiled, conquerer of death,  
is looked down on for being unknown  
by ignorant fools.

130But any person here  
who gets food and drink  
is honored by them,  
even if they are of bad character.

##### Meḷajina

131When I heard the Teacher  
Speaking Dhamma,  
I wasn’t aware of any doubt  
In the all-knowing, unconquered one,

132The caravan leader, the great hero  
The most excellent of charioteers.  
I have no doubt  
In the path or practice.

##### Rādha

133Just as rain seeps into  
a poorly roofed house,  
lust seeps into  
an undeveloped mind.

134Just as rain doesn’t seep into  
A well roofed house,  
lust doesn’t seep into  
a well-developed mind.

##### Surādha

135Rebirth is ended for me;  
The victor’s instruction is fulfilled,  
what they call a "net" is given up,  
The conduit to rebirth is eradicated.

136I’ve reached the goal  
for the sake of which I went forth  
From the lay life into homelessness:  
the ending of all fetters.

##### Gotama

137Sages sleep at ease  
when they’re not bound to women;  
For the truth is hard to find among them,  
And one must always be guarded.

138Sensual pleasure, you’ve been slain!  
We’re not in your debt any more.  
Now we go to extinguishment,  
where there is no sorrow.

##### Vasabha

139First one kills oneself,  
then one kills others.  
One kills oneself, really dead,  
like one who kills birds using a dead bird as a decoy.

140A holy man’s color is not on the outside;  
A holy man is colored on the inside.  
Whoever harbors bad deeds  
is a truly dark one, Sujampati.

##### Mahācunda

141It is from eagerness to learn that learning grows;  
when you're learned, wisdom grows;  
by wisdom, you know the goal;  
knowing the goal brings happiness.

142You should frequent remote lodgings  
and practice to be released from fetters.  
If you don’t find enjoyment there,  
live in the Saṅgha, self-guarded and mindful.

##### Jotidāsa

143People who act harshly —  
attacking people,  
binding them with rope,  
Hurting them in all kinds of ways —  
They’re treated in the same way;  
their deeds don’t vanish.

144Whatever deeds a person does,  
whether good or bad,  
they are the heir to each  
and every deed that they do.

##### Heraññakāni

145The days and nights rush by,  
aAnd then life is cut short.  
The life of mortals wastes away,  
like the water in tiny streams.

146But while doing bad deeds  
The fool doesn’t realize —  
It’ll be bitter later on;  
for the result will be bad for them.

##### Somamitta

147If you're lost in the middle of a great sea,  
and you clamber up on a little log, you'll sink;  
So too, a person who lives well  
sinks by relying on a lazy person.  
Hence you should avoid such  
a lazy person who lacks energy.

148Dwell with the noble ones  
who are secluded and determined  
And always energetic;  
the astute who practice absorption.

##### Sabbamitta

149People are attached to people;  
People are depend on people;  
People are hurt by people;  
And people hurt people.

150What’s the point of people,  
or those born of people?  
Go, abandon these people,  
Who’ve hurt so many people.

##### Mahākāḷa

151There’s a big black woman who looks like a crow.  
She broke off thigh-bones, first one then another;  
She broke off arm-bones, first one then another;  
She broke off a skull like a curd-bowl, and then  
arranged them and sat nearby.

152When an ignorant person builds up attachments,  
that idiot returns to suffering again and again.  
So let one who understands not build up attachments:  
may I never again lie with a broken skull!

##### Tissa (3rd)

153A shaven one wrapped in the outer robe,  
gets many enemies  
when they receive food and drink,  
clothes and bedding.

154Knowing this danger,  
this great fear in honours,  
a mendicant should wander mindful,  
with few possessions, not festering.

##### Kimila (2nd)

155In the Eastern Bamboo Park  
the Sakyan friends,  
having given up great wealth,  
are happy with the scraps in their bowls.

156Energetic, resolute,  
always staunchly vigorous;  
having given up mundane delights,  
they enjoy the delights of the Dhamma.

##### Nanda

157Because of focusing on the wrong things,  
I was addicted to ornamentation.  
I was vain, fickle,  
racked by desire for pleasures of the senses.

158But with the help of the Buddha,  
the Kinsman of the Sun, so skilled in means,  
I practiced rationally and extracted  
attachment to continued existence from my mind.

##### Sirimā

159If others praise one  
who has no immersion,  
they praise in vain,  
as one has no immersion.

160If others criticize one  
who does have immersion,  
they criticize in vain,  
as one does have immersion.

##### Uttarā (2nd)

161I’ve fully understood the aggregates,  
I’ve eradicated craving;  
I’ve developed the factors of awakening,  
I’ve attained the ending of defilements.

162Having fully understood the aggregates,  
having plucked out the weaver of the web,  
having developed the factors of awakening,  
being undefiled, I will be fully quenched.

##### Bhaddaji

163That king was named Panāda,  
wWho had a sacrificial post all golden.  
Its height was sixteen times its width,  
and the top was a thousand-fold.

164It had a thousand panels, and a hundred ball-caps,  
all adorned with banners, made of yellow gold;  
There danced the centaurs,  
numbering seven times six thousand.

##### Sobhita

165As a monk, mindful and wise,  
empowered and full of energy,  
I recollected five hundred aeons  
in a single night.

166Developing the four mindfulness meditations,  
The seven factors of awakening and the eightfold path,  
I recollected five hundred aeons  
in a single night.

##### Valliya (3rd)

167The duty of one whose energy is strong;  
The duty of who longs to wake up:  
that I’ll do, I won’t fail —  
see my energy and vigor!

168Teach me the path,  
the direct route that culminates in freedom from death.  
I’ll know it with wisdom,  
as the Ganges knows the ocean.

##### Vītasoka

169The barber approached  
to shave my head.  
I picked up a mirror  
and examined my body.

170My body appeared hollow;  
I once was blind, but the darkness disappeared.  
My fancy hairdo has been cut off:  
now there'll be no more future lives.

##### Puṇṇamāsa (2nd)

171I gave up the five hindrances  
for the sake of finding sanctuary from the yoke.  
I took Dhamma as a mirror,  
for knowing and seeing myself.

172I examined this body  
all of it, inside and out.  
Internally and externally,  
my body looked hollow.

##### Nandaka (1st)

173Though a fine thoroughbred may stumble  
it soon stands firm again.  
It gains even more urgency,  
and draws its load undeterred.

174Even so is one accomplished in vision,  
a disciple of the Buddha!  
Remember me as a thoroughbred,  
the Buddha’s rightful son.

##### Bharata

175Come, Nandaka, let’s go  
to visit our preceptor.  
We’ll roar the lion’s roar  
before of the best of Buddhas.

176The sage gave us the going forth  
out of compassion, so we could realize  
the ending of all fetters —  
now we have reached that goal.

##### Bhāradvāja

177This is how the wise roar:  
like lions in mountain caves,  
heroes, triumphant in battle,  
having vanquished Māra and his mount.

178I’ve served the teacher;  
I’ve honoured the Dhamma and the Saṅgha;  
I’m happy and joyful,  
because I’ve seen my son free of defilements.

##### Kaṇhadinna

179I regularly sat close to true persons,  
and learnt the teaching.  
What I learned, I practiced,  
the direct route that culminates in freedom from death.

180I’ve slain the desire to be reborn,  
it won’t be found in me again.  
It was not, and it won’t be in me,  
and it isn’t found in me now.

##### Migasira

181When I had gone forth  
in the teaching of the Buddha,  
while letting go, I rose up;  
escaping the sensual realm.

182Then, as the supreme one looked on,  
my mind was freed.  
My freedom is unshakeable,  
with the ending of all fetters.

##### Sivaka

183Houses are impermanent—  
on and on, life after life.  
I’ve been searching for the house-builder —  
painful is birth again and again.

184I’ve seen you, house-builder!  
You won’t build a house again.  
All your rafters are all broken,  
Your ridgepole is shattered.  
My mind is released from limits:  
in this very life it will dissipate.

##### Upavāṇa

185The perfected one, the Holy One in the world,  
The sage is afflicted by winds.  
If there’s hot water,  
give it to the sage, brahmin.

186I wish to bring it to the one  
who is esteemed by the estimable,  
honored by the honorable,  
and venerated by the venerable.

##### Isidinna

187I’ve seen lay disciples who have memorized discourses,  
Saying "Sensual pleasures are impermanent".  
But they're obsessed with jeweled earrings,  
concerned for their partners and children.

188To be honest, they don’t know Dhamma,  
even though they say "Sensual pleasures are impermanent".  
They don’t have the power to cut their lust,  
so they cling to children, wives, and wealth.

##### Sambulakaccāna

189The heavens rain, the heavens pour,  
I’m staying alone in a frightful hole.  
But while I’m staying alone in that frightful hole,  
I’ve no fear, no dread, no goosebumps.

190This is my normal state,  
While staying alone in a frightful hole:  
I’ve no fear,  
no dread, no goosebumps.

##### Nitaka

191Whose mind is like a rock,  
steady, never trembling—  
free of desire for desirable things,  
not getting annoyed when things are annoying?  
From where will suffering strike one  
whose mind is developed like this?

192_My_ mind is like a rock,  
steady, never trembling—  
free of desire for desirable things,  
not getting annoyed when things are annoying.  
From where will suffering strike me  
whose mind is developed like this?

##### Soṇapoṭiriya

193Night, with its garland of stars,  
is not only for sleeping.  
Those who know  
this night is really for waking.

194Were I to fall from the back of an elephant,  
trampled by the tuskers that follow,  
better for me to die in battle,  
than to live on in defeat.

##### Nisabha

195One who’s given up the five sensual titillations,  
so pleasing and delightful,  
and who’s left the home life out of faith—  
let them make an end to suffering!

196I don’t long for death;  
I don’t long for life;  
I await my time,  
aware and mindful.

##### Usabha (2nd)

197Arranging a robe over my shoulder,  
the color of young mango sprouts,  
I entered the village for alms  
sitting on an elephant’s neck!

198But when I dismounted from the elephant,  
I was struck with a sense of urgency.  
I burned with shame, but then I found peace,  
and attained the ending of defilements.

##### Kappaṭakura

199This fellow, "Rag-rice", he sure is a rag!  
Into the vase of freedom from death, polished and overflowing,  
sufficient teaching has been poured;  
the path to build up absorptions has been laid out.

200Don’t nod off, Rag —  
I’ll smack your ear!  
Nodding off in the middle of the Saṅgha?  
You know no bounds.

##### Kumārakassapa

201Oh, the Buddhas! Oh, the Dhammas!  
Oh, the acomplishments of the Teacher!  
Where a disciple may realize  
Such a teaching for themselves.

202Through countless aeons  
They obtained substantial forms.  
This is their last,  
Their final body  
in the transmigrating through births and deaths,  
now there are no more future lives.

##### Dhammapāla

203The young monk  
who is devoted to the teaching of the Buddha,  
wakeful while others sleep —  
his life is not in vain.

204So let the wise devote themselves  
to faith, ethical behaviour,  
confidence, and insight into the teaching,  
remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.

##### Brahmāli

205Whose faculties have become serene,  
like horses tamed by a charioteer?  
With conceit and defilements given up,  
who is such as envied by even the gods?

206_My_ faculties have become serene,  
like horses tamed by a charioteer.  
With conceit and defilements given up,  
I am such as envied by even the gods.

##### Mogharāja

207“Your skin is nasty but your heart is good;  
Mogharājā, you’re always immersed in samādhi.  
But in the nights of winter, so dark and cold,  
how will you get by, monk?”

208“I’ve heard that all the Magadhans  
have an abundance of grain.  
I’ll make my bed under a thatched roof,  
just like those who live in comfort.”

##### Visākhapañcālaputta

209One should not suspend others from the Saṅgha, nor raise objections against them;  
and neither disparage nor raise one’s voice against one who has crossed to the further shore.  
One should not praise oneself among the assemblies,  
not restless, measured in speech, and true to your vows.

210For one who sees the meaning so very subtle and fine,  
who is skilled in thought and humble in manner,  
who has cultivated mature ethics—  
it’s not hard to gain extinguishment.

##### Cūḷaka

211The peacocks cry out with their fair crests and tails,  
their lovely blue necks and fair faces, their beautiful song and their call.  
This broad earth is lush with grass and dew,  
and the firmament is full of beautiful clouds.

212One practicing absorption is happy in mind, and their appearance is uplifting;  
going forth in the teaching of the Buddha is easy for a good person.  
You should realize that supreme state that does not pass,  
so very pure, subtle, and hard to see.

##### Anūpama

213The conceited mind, addicted to pleasure,  
impales itself on its own stake.  
It goes only where  
there’s a stake, a chopping board.

214I declare you the loser mind!  
I declare you the insidious mind!  
You’ve found the teacher so hard to find —  
don’t lead me away from the goal.

##### Vajjita

215Transmigrating for such a long time,  
I’ve proceded through various states of rebirth,  
not seeing the noble truths,  
a blind, unenlightened person.

216But when I became heedful  
transmigrations were mown down.  
All states of rebirth are cut off;  
now there are no more future lives.

##### Sandhita

217Beneath the Bodhi Tree,  
bBright green and growing,  
being mindful, my perception  
became one with the Buddha.

218It's been thirty one aeons  
since I gained that perception;  
and it's due to that perception  
that I’ve attained the ending of defilements.
