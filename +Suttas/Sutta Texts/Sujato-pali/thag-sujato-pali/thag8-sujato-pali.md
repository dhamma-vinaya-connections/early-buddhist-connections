## Khuddaka Nikāya - The Minor Texts

## Theragatha - The Verses of the Senior Monks

### Chapter 8: Groups of Eight Verses

- Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato and Jessica Walton

##### Mahākaccāyana

494Don’t get involved in lots of work,  
avoid people, and don’t try to acquire things.  
If you’re eager and greedy for flavors,  
you’ll miss the goal that brings such happiness.

495They know it really is a bog,  
this homage and veneration in respectable families.  
Honor is a subtle dart, hard to extract,  
and hard for a sinner to give up.

496The deeds of a mortal aren’t bad  
because of what others do.  
You yourself should not do bad,  
for mortals have deeds as their kin.

497You’re not a bandit because of what someone says,  
you’re not a sage because of what someone says;  
but as you know yourself,  
so the gods will know you.

498When others do not understand,  
let us, who do understand this,  
restrain ourselves in this regard;  
for that is how conflicts are laid to rest.

499A wise person lives on  
even after loss of wealth;  
but without gaining wisdom,  
even a rich person doesn’t really live.

500All is heard with the ear,  
all is seen with the eye;  
the wise ought not forsake  
all that is seen and heard.

501Though you have eyes, be as if blind;  
though you have ears, be as if deaf;  
though you have wisdom, be as if dumb;  
though you have strength, be as if feeble.  
And when issues come up  
lie as still as a corpse.

##### Sirimitta

502Free of anger and acrimony,  
free of deceit, and rid of slander;  
that’s how such a mendicant  
doesn’t grieve after passing away.

503Free of anger and acrimony,  
free of deceit, and rid of slander;  
that’s how a mendicant with sense doors always guarded  
doesn’t grieve after passing away.

504Free of anger and acrimony,  
free of deceit, and rid of slander;  
that’s how a mendicant of good morals  
doesn’t grieve after passing away.

505Free of anger and acrimony,  
free of deceit, and rid of slander;  
that’s how a mendicant with good friends  
doesn’t grieve after passing away.

506Free of anger and acrimony,  
free of deceit, and rid of slander;  
that’s how a mendicant of good wisdom,  
doesn’t grieve after passing away.

507Whoever has faith in the Realized One,  
unwavering and well grounded;  
whose ethical conduct is good,  
praised and loved by the noble ones;

508who has confidence in the Saṅgha,  
and correct view:  
they’re said to be prosperous;  
their life is not in vain.

509So let the wise devote themselves  
to faith, ethical behavior,  
confidence, and insight into the teaching,  
remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.

##### Mahāpanthaka

510When I first saw the Teacher  
who fears nothing from any quarter,  
I was struck with a sense of urgency,  
seeing the supreme among men.

511Anyone who, having found such a Teacher,  
would lose them again,  
is like one who, when approached by Lady Luck,  
would ward her off with their hands and feet.

512Then I left behind my children and wives,  
my riches and my grain;  
I had my hair and beard cut off,  
and went forth to homelessness.

513Endowed with the monastic training and livelihood,  
my sense faculties well-restrained,  
paying homage to the Buddha,  
I meditated undefeated.

514Then a wish occurred to me,  
my heart’s truest wish:  
I wouldn’t sit down, not even for a minute,  
until the dart of craving was plucked.

515As I meditate like this,  
see my energy and vigor!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

516I know my past lives,  
my clairvoyance is clarified;  
I’m perfected, worthy of offerings,  
liberated, free of attachments.

517Then, at the end of the night,  
as the rising of the sun drew near,  
all craving was dried up,  
so I sat down cross-legged.
