## Khuddaka Nikāya - The Minor Texts

## Theragatha - The Verses of the Senior Monks

### Chapter 17: Groups of Thirty Verses

- Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato and Jessica Walton

##### Phussa

949Seeing many who inspire confidence,  
evolved and well-restrained,  
the seer of the Paṇḍara clan,  
asked the one known as Phussa:

950“In future times,  
what desire and motivation  
and behavior will people have?  
Please answer my question.”

951“Listen to my words,  
O seer known as a Paṇḍara,  
and remember them carefully,  
I will describe the future.

952In the future many will be  
angry and hostile,  
offensive, stubborn, and devious,  
jealous, holding divergent views.

953Imagining they understand the depths of the teaching,  
they remain on the near shore.  
Superficial and disrespectful towards the teaching,  
they lack respect for one another.

---

954In the future  
many dangers will arise in the world.  
Idiots will defile  
the Dhamma that was taught so well.

955Though bereft of good qualities,  
unlearned prattlers, too sure of themselves,  
will become powerful  
in running Saṅgha proceedings.

956Though possessing good qualities,  
the conscientious and unbiased, acting in the proper spirit,  
will become weak  
in running Saṅgha proceedings.

957In the future, fools will accept  
money, gold, and silver,  
fields and land, goats and sheep,  
and bonded servants, male and female.

958Fools looking for fault in others,  
but unsteady in their own ethics,  
will wander about, insolent,  
like cantankerous beasts.

959They’ll be haughty,  
wrapped in robes of blue;  
deceivers and flatterers, pompous and fake,  
they’ll wander as if they were noble ones.

960With hair sleeked back with oil,  
fickle, their eyes painted with eye-liner,  
they’ll travel on the high-road,  
wrapped in robes of ivory color.

961The deep-dyed ocher robe,  
worn without disgust by the free,  
they will come to loathe,  
besotted by white clothes.32

962They’ll want lots of possessions,  
and be lazy, lacking energy.  
Weary of the forest,  
they’ll stay within villages.

963Being unrestrained, they’ll keep company with  
those who acquire profit,  
and who always enjoy wrong livelihood,  
following their example.

964They won’t respect those  
who don’t get lots of stuff,  
and they won’t associate with the wise,  
even though they’re very amiable.

965Disparaging their own banner,  
dyed a vermilion color,  
some will wear the white banner  
of those of other religions.

966Then they’ll have no respect  
for the ocher robe.  
The mendicants will not reflect  
on the nature of the ocher robe.

967This awful lack of reflection  
was unthinkable to the elephant,  
who was overcome by suffering,  
injured by an arrow strike.

968Then the six-tusked elephant,  
seeing the deep-dyed banner of the perfected ones,  
straight away spoke these verses  
connected with the goal.

969‘One who, not free of stains themselves,  
would wear the robe stained in ocher,  
bereft of self-control and truth:  
they are not worthy of the ocher robe.

970One who’s purged all their stains,  
steady in ethics,  
possessing truth and self-control:  
they are truly worthy of the ocher robe.’

971Devoid of virtue, unintelligent,  
wild, doing what they like,  
their minds astray, indolent:  
they are not worthy of the ocher robe.

972One accomplished in ethics,  
free of greed, serene,  
their heart’s intention pure:  
they are truly worthy of the ocher robe.

973The restless, insolent fool,  
who has no ethics at all,  
is worthy of a white robe—  
what use is an ocher robe for them?

974In the future, monks and nuns  
with corrupt hearts, lacking regard for others,  
will disparage those  
with hearts of loving-kindness.

975Though trained in wearing the robe  
by senior monks,  
the unintelligent will not listen,  
wild, doing what they like.

976With that kind of attitude to training,  
those fools won’t respect each other,  
or take any notice of their mentors,  
like a wild colt with its charioteer.

977Even so, in the future,  
this will be the practice  
of monks and nuns  
when the latter days have come.

978Before this frightening future arrives,  
be easy to admonish,  
courteous in speech,  
and respect one another.

979Have hearts of love and compassion,  
and please do keep your precepts.  
Be energetic, resolute,  
and always staunchly vigorous.

980Seeing negligence as fearful,  
and diligence as a sanctuary,  
develop the eightfold path,  
realizing the state free of death.”

##### Sāriputta

981“One who’s mindful as per their conduct and mindfulness,  
diligent as per their intentions and meditation,  
happy inside, serene, solitary, contented:  
that is what they call a mendicant.

982When eating fresh or dried food,  
one shouldn’t be overly replete.  
A mendicant should wander mindfully,  
with empty stomach, taking limited food.

983Four or five mouthfuls before you’re full,  
drink some water;  
this is enough for a resolute mendicant  
to live in comfort.

984If they cover themselves with a robe  
that’s allowable and fit for purpose;  
this is enough for a resolute mendicant  
to live in comfort.

---

985When sitting cross-legged,  
the rain doesn’t fall on the knees;  
this is enough for a resolute mendicant  
to live in comfort.”

986“When you’ve seen happiness as suffering,  
and suffering as a dart,  
and that there’s nothing between the two—  
what keeps you in the world? What would you become?

---

987Thinking, ‘May I have nothing to do with those of bad wishes,  
lazy, lacking energy,  
unlearned, lacking regard for others’—  
what keeps you in the world? What would you become?”

---

988“An intelligent, learned person,  
steady in ethics,  
devoted to serenity of heart—  
let them stand at the head.”

---

989“A beast who likes to proliferate,  
enjoying proliferation,  
fails to win extinguishment,  
the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.

990But one who gives up proliferation,  
enjoying the state of non-proliferation,  
wins extinguishment,  
the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.”

991“Whether in the village or the wilderness,  
in a valley or the uplands,  
wherever the perfected ones live  
is a delightful place.”

992“Delightful are the wildernesses  
where no people delight.  
Those free of greed will delight there,  
not those who seek sensual pleasures.”

---

993“Regard one who sees your faults  
as a guide to a hidden treasure.  
Stay close to one so wise and astute  
who corrects you when you need it.  
Sticking close to such an impartial person,  
things get better, not worse.”

994“Advise and instruct;  
curb wickedness:  
for you shall be loved by the good,  
and disliked by the bad.”

995“The Blessed One, the Buddha, the seer  
was teaching Dhamma to another.  
As he taught the Dhamma,  
I lent an ear to get the meaning.  
My listening wasn’t wasted:  
I’m freed, without defilements.”

996“Not for knowledge of past lives,  
nor even for clairvoyance;  
not for psychic powers, or reading the minds of others,  
nor for knowing people’s passing away and being reborn;  
not for purifying the power of clairaudience,  
did I have any wish.”

---

997“His only shelter is the foot of a tree;  
shaven, wrapped in his outer robe,  
the senior monk foremost in wisdom,  
Upatissa himself practices absorption.

998When in a meditation free of placing the mind,  
a disciple of the Buddha  
is at that moment blessed  
with noble silence.

---

999As a rocky mountain  
is unwavering and well grounded,  
so when delusion ends,  
a monk, like a mountain, doesn’t tremble.”

1000“To the man who has not a blemish,  
who is always seeking purity,  
even a hair-tip of evil  
seems as big as a cloud.”

1001“I don’t long for death;  
I don’t long for life;  
I will lay down this body,  
aware and mindful.

---

1002I don’t long for death;  
I don’t long for life;  
I await my time,  
like a worker waiting for their wages.”

1003“Both what came before and what follows after  
are nothing but death, not freedom from death.  
Practice, don’t perish—  
don’t let the moment pass you by.

---

1004Just like a frontier city,  
is guarded inside and out,  
so you should ward yourselves—  
don’t let the moment pass you by.  
For if you miss your moment  
you’ll grieve when sent to hell.”

1005“Calm and still,  
thoughtful in counsel, not restless—  
he shakes off bad qualities  
as the wind shakes leaves off a tree.

1006Calm and still,  
thoughtful in counsel, not restless—  
he plucks off bad qualities  
as the wind plucks leaves off a tree.

1007Calm and free of despair,  
clear and unclouded,  
of good morals, intelligent:  
one would make an end of suffering.”

1008“Some householders, and even some renunciants,  
are not to be trusted.  
Some who were good later become bad;  
while some who were bad become good.”

---

1009“Sensual desire, ill will,  
dullness and drowsiness,  
restlessness, and doubt:  
these are the five mental stains for a monk.”

1010“Whether they’re honored  
or not honored, or both,  
their immersion doesn’t waver  
as they live diligently.

1011They persistently practice absorption  
with subtle view and discernment.  
Rejoicing in the ending of grasping,  
they’re said to be a true person.”

1012“The oceans and the earth,  
the mountains and the wind—  
no simile can do justice  
to the Teacher’s magnificent liberation.”

1013“The senior monk who keeps the wheel rolling,  
he is very wise and serene.  
Like earth, like water, like fire,  
he is neither attracted nor repelled.

---

1014He has attained the perfection of wisdom,  
so intelligent and thoughtful.  
He is bright, but seems to be dull;  
he always wanders, quenched.”

1015“I’ve served the teacher  
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  
The heavy burden is laid down,  
the conduit to rebirth is eradicated.”

---

1016“Persist with diligence:  
this is my instruction.  
Come, I’ll be fully quenched—  
I am everywhere free.”

##### Ānanda

1017"A wise person would not make friends  
With a slanderous or hostile person,  
With a miser, or one who delights in the misfortunes of others;  
Association with a bad person is harmful.

1018The wise would make friends  
With the faithful, the pleasant,  
Those with understanding, who are learned;  
Association with a good person is blessed.

1019See this fancy puppet,  
A heap of sores, a composite body,  
Diseased, obsessed over,  
Having no lasting stability.

1020See this fancy shape,  
With its gems and earrings;  
It is bones wrapped with skin,  
Made pretty by its clothes.

---

1021Rouged feet  
And powdered face  
Is enough to delude a fool,  
But not a seeker of the far shore.

---

1022Hair in eight braids  
And eyeliner applied,  
Is enough to delude a fool,  
But not a seeker of the far shore.

1023Like a newly decorated make-up box,  
The disgusting body all adorned  
Is enough to delude a fool,  
But not a seeker of the far shore.

---

1024Gotama is learned, a brilliant speaker,  
The attendant to the Buddha.  
Unfettered, with burden put aside,  
He lies down to sleep.

1025Unfettered, his defilements have ended,  
He has transcended attachments, and has attained _nibbāna_.  
He bears his final body,  
Gone beyond birth and death.

1026Gotama, in whom the teachings of the Buddha,  
The Kinsman of the Sun, are established,  
Stands on the path  
Leading to _nibbāna_.

1027I learned 82, 000 from the Buddha,  
And 2, 000 from the monks;  
These 84, 000  
Are the teachings I have memorized.

1028A person of little learning  
Ages like an ox —  
Their flesh grows,  
But their wisdom doesn’t.

---

1029A learned person who, on account of their learning,  
Looks down on someone of little learning,  
Seems to me like  
A blind man holding a lamp.

1030You should stay close to a learned person —  
Don’t lose what you’ve learned.  
It is the root of the spiritual life,  
So you should memorize the Dhamma.

1031Knowing the sequence and meaning of the teaching,  
Skilled in the interpretation of terms,  
He makes sure it is well memorized,  
And then examines the meaning.

1032Accepting the teachings, he becomes enthusiastic;  
Making an effort, he scrutinizes the Dhamma;  
Striving at the right time,  
He is serene inside himself.

1033If you want to understand the Dhamma,  
You should associate with the sort of person  
Who is learned, and has memorized the Dhamma,  
A wise disciple of the Buddha.

1034A monk who is learned, and has memorized the Dhamma,  
A keeper of the great sage’s treasury,  
Is a visionary for the entire world,  
Venerable, and learned.

1035Delighting in Dhamma, enjoying Dhamma,  
Reflecting on Dhamma,  
Recollecting Dhamma,  
He doesn’t decline in the true Dhamma.

1036When your body is pampered and heavy,  
While your remaining time is running out;  
Greedy for physical pleasure,  
How can you find happiness as an ascetic?

1037Every direction is unclear!  
The Dhamma does not occur to me!  
With the passing of our good friend,  
It all seems dark.

1038If your friend has passed away,  
And your teacher is past and gone,  
There’s no friend like  
Mindfulness of the body.

1039The old have passed away,  
And I don’t get on with the new.  
Today I meditate alone  
Like a bird snug in its nest."

1040"Many international visitors  
Have come to see.  
Don’t block the audience,  
Let the congregation see me."

1041"Lots of international visitors  
Have come to see.  
The teacher grants them the opportunity,  
The seer doesn’t stop them.

1042For the 25 years  
Since I have been a trainee,  
No sensual perception arose in me:  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!

1043For the 25 years  
Since I have been a trainee,  
No malicious perception arose in me:  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!

1044For 25 years  
I attended on the Blessed One  
With loving deeds,  
Like a shadow that never left.

1045For 25 years  
I attended on the Blessed One  
With loving words,  
Like a shadow that never left.

1046For 25 years  
I attended on the Blessed One  
With loving thoughts,  
Like a shadow that never left.

1047While the Buddha was walking meditation,  
I walked meditation behind him.  
As he taught the Dhamma,  
Knowledge arose in me.

1048I’m a trainee, who has more to do!  
My mind is not perfected!  
Yet the teacher, who was so compassionate to me,  
Has passed into _nibbāna_.

1049Then there was terror!  
Then they had goose-bumps!  
When the Buddha, endowed with all qualities,  
Passed into _nibbāna_."

1050"Ānanda, who was learned, and had memorized the Dhamma,  
A keeper of the great sage’s treasury,  
A visionary for the entire world,  
Has passed into _nibbāna_.

1051He was learned, and had memorized the Dhamma,  
A keeper of the great sage’s treasury,  
A visionary for the entire world,  
When all was black, he dispelled the dark.

1052He is the sage who remembered the teachings,  
And mastered their sequence, holding them firm.  
The senior monk who memorized the Dhamma,  
Ānanda was a mine of gems."

1053"I’ve attended on the teacher  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  
The heavy burden is laid down,  
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn in any state of existence."
