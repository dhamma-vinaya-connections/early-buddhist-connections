## Khuddaka Nikāya - The Minor Texts

## Theragatha - The Verses of the Senior Monks

### Chapter 6: Groups of Six Verses

- Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato and Jessica Walton

##### Uruveḷakassapa

375Seeing the demonstrations  
of the renowned Gotama  
was not enough for me to bow to him—  
I was blinded by jealousy and conceit.

376Knowing my thoughts,  
the trainer of men scolded me.  
I was struck with a sense of urgency,  
so astonishing and hair-raising!

377Rejecting the petty powers  
I had before as a matted-hair ascetic,  
I then went forth  
in the victor’s instruction.

378I used to be content with sacrifice,  
the realm of sensual pleasures was my priority.  
But later I eradicated desire,  
and hatred and also delusion.

379I know my past lives;  
my clairvoyance is clarified;  
I have psychic powers, and know the minds of others;  
I have attained clairaudience.

380I’ve attained the goal  
for the sake of which I went forth  
from the lay life to homelessness—  
the ending of all fetters.

##### Tekicchakāri

381“The rice has been harvested  
and gathered on the threshing-floor—  
but I don’t get any almsfood!  
How will I get by?”

382“In faith, recollect the immeasurable Buddha!  
Your body soaked with rapture, you’ll always be full of joy.

383In faith, recollect the immeasurable teaching!  
Your body soaked with rapture, you’ll always be full of joy.

384In faith, recollect the immeasurable Saṅgha!  
Your body soaked with rapture, you’ll always be full of joy.”

385“You stay in the open,  
though these winter nights are cold.  
Don’t perish, overcome with cold;  
enter your dwelling, with door shut fast.”

386“I’ll realize the four immeasurable states,  
and meditate happily in them.  
I won’t perish, overcome with cold;  
I’ll dwell unperturbed.”

##### Mahānāga

387Whoever has no respect  
for their spiritual companions  
falls away from the true teaching,  
like a fish in a little puddle.

388Whoever has no respect  
for their spiritual companions  
doesn’t thrive in the true teaching,  
like a rotten seed in a field.

389Whoever has no respect  
for their spiritual companions  
is far from extinguishment,  
in the teaching of the Dhamma king.

390Whoever does have respect  
for their spiritual companions  
doesn’t fall away from the true teaching,  
like a fish in plenty of water.

391Whoever does have respect  
for their spiritual companions  
thrives in the true teaching,  
like a fine seed in a field.

392Whoever does have respect  
for their spiritual companions  
is close to extinguishment  
in the teaching of the Dhamma king.

##### Kulla

393I, Kulla, went to a charnel ground  
and saw a woman’s body abandoned there,  
discarded in a cemetery,  
full of worms that devoured.

394“See this bag of bones, Kulla—  
diseased, filthy, rotten,  
oozing and trickling,  
a fool’s delight.”

395Taking the teaching as a mirror  
for realizing knowledge and vision,  
I examined this body,  
hollow, inside and out.

396As this is, so is that;  
as that is, so is this.  
As below, so above;  
as above, so below.

397As by day, so by night;  
as by night, so by day.  
As before, so behind;  
as behind, so before.

398Even the music of a five-piece band  
can never give such pleasure  
as when, with unified mind,  
you rightly discern the Dhamma.

##### Mālukyaputta (1st)

399When a person lives heedlessly,  
craving grows in them like a camel’s foot creeper.  
They jump from life to life, like a monkey  
greedy for fruit in a forest grove.

400Whoever is beaten by this wretched craving,  
this attachment to the world,  
their sorrow grows,  
like grass in the rain.

401But whoever prevails over this wretched craving,  
so hard to get over in the world,  
their sorrows fall from them,  
like a drop from a lotus-leaf.

402I say this to you, good people,  
all those who have gathered here:  
dig up the root of craving,  
as you’d dig up the grass in search of roots.  
Don’t let Māra break you again and again,  
like a stream breaking a reed.

403Act on the Buddha’s words,  
don’t let the moment pass you by.  
For if you miss your moment  
you’ll grieve when sent to hell.

404Negligence is always dust;  
dust follows right behind negligence.  
Through diligence and knowledge,  
pluck out the dart from yourself.

##### Sappadāsa

405In the twenty-five years  
since I went forth,  
I have not found peace of mind,  
Even as long as a finger-snap.

406Since I couldn’t get my mind unified,  
I was racked by desire for pleasures of the senses.  
Wailing, with outstretched arms,  
I left my dwelling.

407Shall I … or shall I slit my wrists?  
What’s the point of living?  
For how on earth can one such as me die  
after resigning the training?

408Then I picked up a razor,  
I sat on a cot:  
the razor was ready  
to slice my vein.

409Then the realization  
came upon me—  
the danger became clear,  
and I was firmly disillusioned.

410Then my mind was freed—  
see the excellence of the teaching!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

##### Kātiyāna

411Get up, Kātiyāna, and sit!  
Don’t sleep too much, be wakeful.  
Don’t be lazy and let the kinsman of the negligent,  
the King of Death, catch you in his trap.

412Like a wave in the mighty ocean,  
rebirth and old age sweep you under.  
Make a safe island of yourself,  
for you have no other shelter.

413The teacher has mastered this path,  
which transcends chains, and the fear of birth and old age.  
Be diligent in the first and final watches of the night,  
and dedicate yourself to practice.

414Free yourself from your former bonds!  
Wearing your outer robe, with shaven head, eating almsfood,  
don’t delight in play or sleep,  
dedicate yourself to absorption, Kātiyāna.

---

415Meditate and conquer, Kātiyāna,  
you’re an expert in the path to sanctuary from the yoke.  
Attaining unexcelled purity,  
you’ll be quenched, as a flame by water.

416A lamp of feeble flame  
is bent down by the wind, like a creeper;  
just so, kinsman of Indra,  
shake off Māra, without grasping.  
Free of lust for feelings,  
await your time here, cooled.

##### Migajāla

417It was well-taught by the Clear-eyed One,  
the Buddha, kinsman of the Sun,  
who has transcended all fetters,  
and destroyed all rolling-on.

418Emancipating, it leads across,  
drying up the root of craving,  
and, having cut off the poisonous root, the slaughterhouse,  
it leads to quenching.

419By breaking the root of unknowing,  
it smashes the mechanism of deeds,  
and drops the thunderbolt of knowledge  
on the taking up of consciousnesses.

420It informs us of our feelings,  
releasing us from grasping,  
contemplating with understanding  
all states of existence as a pit of burning coals.

421It’s very sweet and very deep,  
holding birth and death at bay;  
it is the noble eightfold path—  
the stilling of suffering, bliss.

422Knowing deed as deed  
and result as result;  
seeing dependently originated phenomena  
as if they were in a clear light;  
leading to the great sanctuary and peace,  
it’s excellent at the end.

##### Purohitaputtajenta

423I was drunk with the pride of birth  
and wealth and authority.  
I wandered about intoxicated  
with my own gorgeous body.

424No-one was my equal or my better—  
or so I thought.  
I was such an arrogant fool,  
stuck up, waving my own flag.

425I never paid homage to anyone:  
not even my mother or father,  
nor others esteemed as respectable.  
I was stiff with pride, lacking regard for others.

426When I saw the foremost leader,  
the most excellent of charioteers,  
shining like the sun,  
at the fore of the mendicant Saṅgha,

427I discarded conceit and vanity,  
and, with a clear and confident heart,  
I bowed down with my head  
to the most excellent of all beings.

428The conceit of superiority and the conceit of inferiority  
have been given up and eradicated.  
The conceit “I am” is cut off,  
and every kind of conceit is destroyed.

##### Sumana (2nd)

429I was only seven years old  
and had just gone forth  
when I overcame the mighty serpent king  
with my psychic powers.

430I brought water for my mentor  
from the great lake Anotatta.  
When he saw me,  
my teacher declared:

431“Sāriputta, see this  
young boy coming,  
carrying a water pot,  
serene inside himself.

432His conduct inspires confidence,  
he is of lovely deportment:  
he is Anuruddha’s novice,  
assured in psychic powers.

433Made a thoroughbred by a thoroughbred,  
made good by the good,  
educated and trained by Anuruddha,  
who has completed his task.

434"Having attained ultimate peace  
and witnessed the unshakable,  
that novice Sumana has the wish:  
‘May no-one find me out!’”

##### Nhātakamuni

435"Struck by a wind ailment,  
While staying in a forest grove;  
You’ve gone into a tough place for gathering alms:  
How will you get by, monk?"

436“Pervading this bag of bones  
with abundant rapture and happiness,  
putting up with what’s tough,  
I’ll dwell in the forest.

437Developing the seven awakening factors,  
the faculties and the powers,  
endowed with subtle absorptions,  
I’ll dwell without defilements.

438Freed from corruptions,  
my pure mind is unclouded.  
Frequently reviewing this,  
I’ll meditate without defilements.

439Those defilements that were found in me,  
internally and externally,  
are all cut off without remainder,  
and will not arise again.

440The five aggregates are fully understood,  
they remain, but their root is cut.  
I have reached the ending of suffering,  
now there’ll be no more future lives.”

##### Brahmadatta

441From where would come anger for one free of anger,  
tamed, living justly,  
freed by right knowledge,  
peaceful and unaffected?

442When you get angry at an angry person  
you just make things worse for yourself.  
When you don’t get angry at an angry person  
you win a battle hard to win.

443When you know that the other is angry,  
you act for the good of both  
yourself and the other  
if you’re mindful and stay calm.

---

444People unfamiliar with the teaching  
consider one who heals both  
oneself and the other  
to be a fool.

445If anger arises in you,  
reflect on the simile of the saw;  
if craving for flavors arises in you,  
remember the simile of the child’s flesh.

446If your mind runs off  
to sensual pleasures and future lives,  
quickly curb it with mindfulness,  
as one would curb a greedy cow eating grain.

##### Sirimaṇḍa

447The rain saturates things that are covered up;  
it doesn’t saturate things that are open.  
Therefore you should open up a covered thing,  
so the rain will not saturate it.

448The world is beaten down by death  
and surrounded by old age.  
The dart of craving has struck it down,  
and it’s always fuming with desire.

449The world is beaten down by death,  
caged by old age,  
beaten constantly without respite,  
like a thief being flogged.

450Three things are coming, like a wall of flame:  
death, disease, and old age.  
No power can stand before them,  
and no speed’s enough to flee.

451Don’t waste your day,  
a little or a lot.  
Every night that passes  
shortens your life by that much.

452Walking or standing,  
sitting or lying down:  
your final night draws near;  
you have no time to be careless.

##### Sabbakāmi

453This two-legged body is dirty and stinking,  
full of different carcasses,  
and oozing all over the place—  
but still it is cherished!

454Like a lurking deer by a trick,  
like a fish by a hook,  
like a monkey by tar—  
they trap an ordinary person.

455Sights, sounds, tastes, smells,  
and touches so delightful:  
these five kinds of sensual stimulation  
are seen in a woman’s body.>

456Those ordinary people, their minds full of lust,  
who pursue those women:  
they swell the horrors of the charnel ground,  
piling up future lives.

457One who, being mindful,  
avoids them  
like a snake’s head with their foot,  
gets over clinging to the world.

458Seeing the danger in sensual pleasures,  
seeing renunciation as sanctuary,  
I’ve escaped all sensual pleasures,  
and attained the ending of defilements.
