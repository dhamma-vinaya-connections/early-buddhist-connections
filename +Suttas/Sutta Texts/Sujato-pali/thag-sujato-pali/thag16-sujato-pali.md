## Khuddaka Nikāya - The Minor Texts

## Theragatha - The Verses of the Senior Monks

### Chapter 16: Groups of (about) Twenty Verses

- Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato and Jessica Walton

##### Adhimutta

705“Those who we killed in the past,  
whether for sacrifice or for wealth,  
without exception were afraid;  
they trembled and they squealed.

706But you’re not scared;  
you look even calmer than before.  
Why don’t you cry out  
in such a terrifying situation?”

707“There isn’t any mental suffering  
for one without hope, village chief.  
All fears are left behind  
by one whose fetters have ended.

708When the conduit to rebirth is ended,  
and the truth is seen as it is,  
there is no fear of death;  
it’s like laying down a burden.

---

709I’ve lived the spiritual life well,  
and developed the path well, too.  
I do not fear death;  
it’s like the passing of a disease.

710I’ve lived the spiritual life well,  
and developed the path well, too.  
I’ve seen that there’s nothing gratifying in existences,  
like someone who has tasted poison, then thrown it out.

---

711One who has gone beyond, without grasping,  
they’ve completed the task and are free of defilements.  
They are content at the end of life,  
like someone released from execution.

712Having realized the supreme Dhamma,  
without needing anything in the whole world,  
one doesn’t grieve at death;  
for it’s like escaping from a burning house.

---

713Whatever has come to pass,  
wherever life is obtained,  
there is no Lord of all that:  
so said the great seer.

714Whoever understands this  
as it was taught by the Buddha  
doesn’t grab on to any new life,  
like you wouldn’t grab a hot iron ball.

715It doesn’t occur to me, ‘I existed in the past’;  
nor, ‘I will exist in the future’.  
All conditions will disappear—  
why weep over that?

716Seeing truly  
the bare arising of phenomena,  
and the bare process of conditions,  
there is no fear, village chief.

---

717The world is like grass and sticks:  
when this is seen with wisdom,  
not finding anything to be mine,  
you won’t grieve, thinking ‘I don’t have it’.

718I’m fed up with the body;  
I have no need for another life.  
This body will be broken up,  
and there won’t be another.

719Do what you want  
with my corpse.  
I won’t be angry or attached  
on account of that.”

720When they heard these words,  
so astonishing and hair-raising,  
the young men laid down their swords  
and spoke these words:

721“What have you practiced, Venerable?  
And who is your tutor?  
Whose instructions do we follow  
to gain the sorrowless state?”

---

722“The knower of all, the seer of all:  
the victor is my tutor.  
He is a Teacher of great compassion,  
healer of the whole world.

723He taught this Dhamma,  
leading to ending, unsurpassed.  
Following his instructions,  
you can gain the sorrowless state.”

724When the bandits heard the good words of the seer,  
they laid down their swords and weapons.  
Some refrained from their former deeds,  
while others chose the going-forth.

---

725Having gone forth in the teaching of the Holy One,  
those astute ones developed the awakening factors and the powers.  
Elated, happy, their faculties complete,  
they realized the state of extinguishment, the unconditioned.

##### Pārāsariya (2nd)

726This thought came to the ascetic,  
the monk Pārāsariya,  
as he was seated alone  
meditating in seclusion:

727“Following what procedure,  
what observance, what conduct,  
may a person what they need to do for themselves,  
without harming anyone else?

728The faculties of human beings  
can lead to both welfare and harm.  
Unguarded they lead to harm;  
guarded they lead to welfare.

729By protecting the faculties,  
taking care of the faculties,  
I can do what I need to do for myself  
without harming anyone else.

730If your eye wanders  
among sights without check,  
not seeing the danger,  
you’re not freed from suffering.

731If your ear wanders  
among sounds without check,  
not seeing the danger,  
you’re not freed from suffering.

732If, not seeing the escape,  
you indulge in a smell,  
you’re not freed from suffering,  
being besotted by smells.

733Recollecting the sour,  
the sweet and the bitter,  
captivated by craving for taste,  
you don’t understand the heart.

734Recollecting lovely  
and pleasurable touches,  
full of desire, you experience  
many kinds of suffering because of lust.

735Unable to protect  
the mind from such thoughts,  
suffering follows them  
because of all five.

736This body is full of pus and blood,  
it’s home to many carcasses;  
but cunning people decorate it  
like a lovely painted casket.

737You don’t understand that  
the sweetness of honey turns bitter,  
and the bonds to those we love cause pain,  
like a razor’s edge smeared with honey.

738Full of lust for the sight of a woman,  
for the voice and the smells of a woman,  
for a woman’s touch,  
you experience many kinds of suffering.

739All of a woman’s streams  
flow from five to five.  
Whoever, being energetic,  
is able to curb these,

740purposeful and firm in principle,  
is clever and clear-seeing.  
Though he might enjoy himself,  
his duty is connected with the teaching and its goal.

741One who’s diligent and discerning,  
thinking, “This ought not be done”,  
would avoid a useless task  
that’s doomed to failure.

742Whatever is meaningful,  
and whatever happiness is principled,  
let one undertake and follow that:  
this is the best happiness.

743They want to get hold of what belongs to others  
by any means, fair or foul.  
They kill, injure, and torment,  
violently plundering what belongs to others.

744Just as a strong person when building  
knocks out a peg with a peg,  
so the skillful person  
knocks out the faculties with the faculties.

745Developing faith, energy, immersion,  
mindfulness, and wisdom;  
destroying the five with the five,  
the brahmin walks on untroubled.

746Purposeful and firm in principle,  
having fulfilled in every respect  
the instructions spoken by the Buddha,  
that person prospers in happiness.”

##### Telakāni

747For a long time, sadly,  
though I keenly contemplated the teaching,  
I gained no peace of mind.  
So I asked this of ascetics and brahmins:

748“Who in the world have crossed over?  
Whose attainment culminates in freedom from death?  
Whose teaching do I accept  
to understand the ultimate goal?

749I was hooked inside,  
like a fish gulping bait;  
bound like the titan Vepaciti  
in Mahinda’s trap.

750Dragging it along, I’m not free  
from grief and lamentation.  
Who will free me from bonds in the world,  
so that I may know awakening?

751What ascetic or brahmin  
points out what is frail?  
Whose teaching do I accept  
to sweep away old age and death?

752Tied up with uncertainty and doubt,  
secured by the power of aggression,  
stiff as a mind beset by anger;  
the arrow of covetousness,

753propelled by the bow of craving,  
is stuck in my twice-fifteen ribcage—  
see how it stands in my breast,  
breaking my strong heart.

754Speculative views are not abandoned,  
they are sharpened by memories and intentions;  
and pierced by this I tremble,  
like a leaf blowing in the wind.

755Having arisen within,  
what belongs to me burns quickly,  
in that place where the body always heads  
with its six sense-fields of contact.

756I don’t see a healer  
who can pull out my dart of doubt  
without a lance  
or some other blade.

757Without knife or wound,  
who will pull out this dart  
that’s stuck inside me,  
without harming any part of my body?

758He really would be the Lord of the Dhamma,  
the best one to cure the damage of poison;  
when I have fallen into deep waters,  
he would show me his hand and the shore.

759I’ve plunged into a lake,  
and I can’t wash off the mud and dirt.  
It’s full of fraud, jealousy, aggression,  
and dullness and drowsiness.

760Like a thunder-cloud of restlessness,  
like a rain cloud of fetters;  
lustful thoughts are winds  
that sweep off a person with bad views.

761The streams flow everywhere;  
a weed springs up and remains.  
Who will block the streams?  
Who will cut the weed?”

762“Venerable sir, build a dam  
to block the streams.  
Don’t let your mind-made streams  
cut you down suddenly like a tree.”

763That is how, when I was full of fear,  
seeking the far shore from the near,  
my shelter was the teacher whose weapon is wisdom,  
surrounded by the Saṅgha of seers.

764As I was being swept away,  
he gave me a strong, simple ladder,  
made of the heartwood of Dhamma,  
and he said to me: “Do not fear.”

765I climbed the tower of mindfulness meditation,  
and checked back down  
at people delighting in substantial reality,  
as I had obsessed over in the past.

766When I saw the path,  
as I was embarking on the ship,  
without fixating on the self,  
I saw the supreme landing-place.

767The dart that arises in oneself,  
and that which stems from the conduit to rebirth:  
he taught the supreme path  
for the canceling of these.

768For a long time it had lain within me;  
for a long time it was fixed in me:  
the Buddha cast off the knot,  
curing the damage of poison.

##### Raṭṭhapāla

769“See this fancy puppet,  
a body built of sores,  
diseased, obsessed over,  
in which nothing lasts at all.

770See this fancy figure,  
with its gems and earrings;  
it is bones encased in skin,  
made pretty by its clothes.

771Rouged feet  
and powdered face  
may be enough to beguile a fool,  
but not a seeker of the far shore.

772Hair in eight braids  
and eyeshadow  
may be enough to beguile a fool,  
but not a seeker of the far shore.

773A rotting body all adorned  
like a freshly painted makeup box  
may be enough to beguile a fool,  
but not a seeker of the far shore.

774The hunter laid his snare,  
but the deer didn’t spring the trap.  
I’ve eaten the bait and now I go,  
leaving the trapper to lament.

775The hunter’s snare is broken,  
but the deer didn’t spring the trap.  
I’ve eaten the bait and now I go,  
leaving the deer-hunter to grieve.”

776“I see rich people in the world who,  
because of delusion, give not the wealth they’ve earned.  
Greedily, they hoard their riches,  
yearning for ever more sensual pleasures.

---

777A king who conquered the earth by force,  
ruling the land from sea to sea,  
unsatisfied with the near shore of the ocean,  
would still yearn for the further shore.

778Not just the king, but others too,  
reach death not rid of craving.  
They leave the body still wanting,  
for in this world sensual pleasures never satisfy.

779Relatives lament, their hair disheveled,  
saying ‘Ah! Alas! They’re not immortal!’  
They take out the body wrapped in a shroud,  
heap up a pyre, and burn it there.

780It’s poked with stakes while being burnt,  
in just a single cloth, all wealth gone.  
Relatives, friends, and companions  
can’t help you when you’re dying.

781Heirs take your riches,  
while beings fare on according to their deeds.  
Riches don’t follow you when you die;  
nor do children, wife, wealth, nor kingdom.

782Longevity isn’t gained by riches,  
nor does wealth banish old age;  
for the wise say this life is short,  
it’s perishable and not eternal.

783The rich and the poor feel its touch;  
the fool and the wise feel it too.  
But the fool lies stricken by their own folly,  
while the wise don’t tremble at the touch.

784Therefore wisdom’s much better than wealth,  
since by wisdom you reach consummation in this life.  
But if because of delusion you don’t reach consummation,  
you’ll do evil deeds in life after life.

---

785One who enters a womb and the world beyond,  
will transmigrate from one life to the next.  
While someone of little wisdom, placing faith in them,  
also enters a womb and the world beyond.

786As a bandit caught in a window  
is punished for his own bad deeds;  
so after departing, in the world beyond,  
people are punished for their own bad deeds.

---

787Sensual pleasures are diverse, sweet, delightful,  
appearing in disguise they disturb the mind.  
Seeing danger in sensual stimulations,  
I went forth, O King.

788As fruit falls from a tree, so people fall,  
young and old, when the body breaks up.  
Seeing this, too, I went forth, O King;  
the ascetic life is unfailingly better.”

789“I went forth out of faith  
joining the victor’s dispensation.  
My going forth wasn’t wasted;  
I enjoy my food free of debt.

---

790I saw sensual pleasures as burning,  
gold as a cutting blade,  
conception in a womb as suffering,  
and the hells as very fearful.

791Knowing this danger,  
I was struck with a sense of urgency.  
I was stabbed, but then I found peace,  
attaining the end of defilements.

792I’ve served the teacher  
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  
The heavy burden is laid down,  
the conduit to rebirth is eradicated.

793I’ve reached the goal  
for the sake of which I went forth  
from the lay life to homelessness—  
the ending of all fetters.”

##### Sela

818“O Blessed One, your body’s perfect,  
you’re radiant, handsome, lovely to behold;  
golden colored,  
with teeth so white; you’re strong.

819The characteristics  
of a handsome man,  
the marks of a great man,  
are all found on your body.

---

820Your eyes are clear, your face is fair,  
you’re formidable, upright, majestic.  
In the midst of the Saṅgha of ascetics,  
you shine like the sun.

821You’re a mendicant fine to see,  
with skin that shines like lustrous gold.  
But with such excellent appearance,  
what do you want with the ascetic life?

822You’re fit to be a king,  
a wheel-turning monarch, chief of charioteers,  
victorious in the four quarters,  
lord of the Black Plum Tree Land.

823Aristocrats, nobles, and kings  
ought follow your rule.  
Gotama, you should reign  
as king of kings, lord of men!”

824“I am a king, Sela”,  
said the Buddha to Sela,  
“the supreme king of the teaching.  
By the teaching I roll forth the wheel  
which cannot be rolled back.”

825“You claim to be awakened,”  
said Sela the brahmin,  
“the supreme king of the teaching.  
‘I roll forth the teaching’:  
so you say, Gotama.

826Then who is your general,  
the disciple who follows the Teacher’s way?  
Who keeps rolling the wheel  
of the teaching you rolled forth?”

827“By me the wheel was rolled forth,”  
said the Buddha,  
“the supreme wheel of the teaching.  
Sāriputta, taking after the Realized One,  
keeps it rolling on.

---

828I have known what should be known,  
and developed what should be developed,  
and given up what should be given up:  
and so, brahmin, I am a Buddha.

829Dispel your doubt in me—  
make up your mind, brahmin!  
The sight of a Buddha  
is hard to find again.

830I am a Buddha, brahmin,  
the supreme surgeon,  
one of those whose appearance in the world  
is hard to find again.

831A manifestation of divinity, unequaled,  
crusher of Māra’s army;  
having subdued all my opponents,  
I rejoice, fearing nothing from any quarter.”

832“Pay heed, sirs, to what  
is spoken by the Clear-eyed One.  
The surgeon, the great hero,  
roars like a lion in the jungle.

833A manifestation of divinity, unequaled,  
crusher of Māra’s army;  
who would not be inspired by him,  
even one born in a dark class?

---

834Those who wish may follow me;  
those who don’t may go.  
Right here, I’ll go forth in his presence,  
the one of such splendid wisdom.”

835“Sir, if you endorse  
the teaching of the Buddha,  
we’ll also go forth in his presence,  
the one of such splendid wisdom.”

836“These three hundred brahmins  
with joined palms held up, ask:  
‘May we lead the spiritual life  
in your presence, Blessed One?’”

837“The spiritual life is well explained,”  
said the Buddha,  
“apparent in the present life, immediately effective.  
Here the going forth isn’t in vain  
for one who trains with diligence.”

838“This is the eighth day since  
we went for refuge, O Clear-eyed One.  
In these seven days, Blessed One,  
we’ve become tamed in your teaching.

---

839You are the Buddha, you are the Teacher,  
you are the sage who has overcome Māra;  
you have cut off the underlying tendencies,  
you’ve crossed over, and you bring humanity across.

840You have transcended attachments,  
your defilements are shattered;  
by not grasping, like a lion,  
you’ve given up fear and dread.

841These three hundred mendicants  
stand with joined palms raised.  
Stretch out your feet, great hero:  
let these giants bow to the Teacher.”

Bhaddiya son of Godhā  
practices absorption without grasping.

---

862Giving up a valuable bronze bowl,  
and a precious golden one, too,  
I took a bowl made of clay:  
this is my second initiation.

863I used to live in a citadel with walls so high,  
with battlements strong and gates,  
all guarded by swordsmen—  
and yet I trembled with fear.

---

864Today I am fortunate, free of cowardice,  
with fear and dread given up.  
Bhaddiya son of Godhā  
has plunged into the forest and practices absorption.

865Established in the entire spectrum of ethics,  
developing mindfulness and wisdom,  
gradually I attained  
the ending of all fetters.

##### Angulimāla

866“While walking, ascetic, you say ‘I’ve stopped.’  
And I have stopped, but you tell me I’ve not.  
I’m asking you this, ascetic:  
how is it you’ve stopped and I have not?”

867“Aṅgulimāla, I have forever stopped—  
I’ve laid aside violence towards all creatures.  
But you can’t stop yourself from harming living creatures;  
that’s why I’ve stopped, but you have not.”

868“Oh, at long last a renowned great seer,  
an ascetic has followed me into this deep wood.  
Now that I’ve heard your verse on Dhamma,  
I shall discard a thousand evils.”

869With these words, the bandit hurled his sword and weapons  
down a cliff into an abyss.  
He venerated the Holy One’s feet,  
and asked the Buddha for the going forth right away.

870Then the Buddha, the compassionate great seer,  
the teacher of the world with its gods,  
said to him, “Come, monk!”  
And with that he became a monk.

871“He who once was heedless,  
but turned to heedfulness,  
lights up the world,  
like the moon freed from clouds.

872Someone whose bad deed  
is supplanted by the good,  
lights up the world,  
like the moon freed from clouds.

873A young mendicant  
devoted to the Buddha’s teaching,  
lights up the world,  
like the moon freed from clouds.

874May even my enemies hear a Dhamma talk!  
May even my enemies devote themselves to the Buddha’s teaching!  
May even my enemies associate with those good people  
who establish others in the Dhamma!

875May even my enemies hear Dhamma at the right time,  
from those who teach acceptance,  
praising acquiescence;  
and may they follow that path!

876For then they’d never wish harm  
upon myself or others.  
Having arrived at ultimate peace,  
they’d look after creatures firm and frail.

877For irrigators guide the water,  
and fletchers straighten arrows;  
carpenters carve timber—  
but the astute tame themselves.

---

878Some tame by using the rod,  
some with goads, and some with whips.  
But the unaffected one tamed me  
without rod or sword.

879My name is ‘Harmless’,  
though I used to be harmful.  
The name I bear today is true,  
for I do no harm to anyone.

880I used to be a bandit,  
the notorious Aṅgulimāla.  
Swept away in a great flood,  
I went to the Buddha for refuge.

881I used to have blood on my hands,  
the notorious Aṅgulimāla.  
See the refuge I’ve found—  
the conduit to rebirth is eradicated.

882I’ve done many of the sort of deeds  
that lead to a bad destination.  
The result of my deeds has already struck me,  
so I enjoy my food free of debt.

883Fools and half-wits  
devote themselves to negligence.  
But the wise protect diligence  
as their best treasure.

884Don’t devote yourself to negligence,  
or delight in sexual intimacy.  
For if you’re diligent and practice absorption,  
you’ll attain ultimate happiness.

885It was welcome, not unwelcome,  
the advice I got was good.  
Of the well-explained teachings,  
I arrived at the best.

886It was welcome, not unwelcome,  
the advice I got was good.  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.”

887“In the wilderness, at a tree’s root,  
on mountains, or in caves—  
it used to be that wherever I stood,  
my mind was anxious.

888But now I lie down happily and stand up happily,  
I live my life happily,  
out of Māra’s reach;  
the teacher had sympathy for me.

889I used to be of brahmin birth,  
highborn on both sides,  
now I’m a son of the Holy One,  
the Teacher, King of Dhamma.

890I am rid of craving, free of grasping,  
my sense doors are guarded and well-restrained.  
I’ve destroyed the root of misery,  
and attained the ending of defilements.

891I’ve served the teacher  
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  
The heavy burden is laid down,  
the conduit to rebirth is eradicated.”

##### Anuruddha

892Leaving my mother and father behind,  
as well as sisters, kinsmen, and brothers;  
having given up the five sensual titillations,  
Anuruddha practices absorption.

893Surrounded by song and dance,  
awakened by cymbals and gongs,  
he did not find purification  
while delighting in Māra’s domain.

894But he has gone beyond all that,  
and delights in the Buddha’s teaching.  
Having crossed over the entire flood,  
Anuruddha practices absorption.

895Sights, sounds, tastes, smells,  
and touches so delightful:  
having crossed over these as well,  
Anuruddha practices absorption.

896Returning from almsround,  
alone, without companion,  
seeking rags from the dust heap,  
Anuruddha is without defilements.

897The thoughtful sage  
selected rags from the dust heap;  
he picked them up, washed, dyed, and wore them;  
Anuruddha is without defilements.

898The principles of someone  
who has many wishes and is not content,  
who socializes and is conceited,  
are wicked and corrupting.

899But someone who is mindful, few of wishes,  
content and untroubled,  
delighting in seclusion, joyful,  
always resolute and energetic;

900their principles are skillful,  
leading to awakening;  
they are without defilements—  
so said the great seer.

901“Knowing my thoughts,  
the supreme Teacher in the world  
came to me in a mind-made body,  
using his psychic power.

902He taught me more  
than I had thought of.  
The Buddha who loves non-proliferation  
taught me non-proliferation.

903Understanding that teaching,  
I happily did his bidding.  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
and have fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

904For the last fifty-five years  
I have not lain down to sleep.  
Twenty-five years have passed  
since I eradicated drowsiness.”

905“There was no more breathing  
for the unaffected one of steady heart.  
Imperturbable, committed to peace,  
the Clear-eyed One became fully quenched.

906He put up with painful feelings  
without flinching.  
The liberation of his heart  
was like the extinguishing of a lamp.”

907“Now these touches and the other four  
are the last to be experienced by the sage;  
nor will there be other phenomena  
since the Buddha became fully quenched.

908O Penelope, weaver of the web—  
there’s no more abodes in the host of gods.  
Transmigration through births is finished,  
now there are no more future lives.”

909“That mendicant, knowing in an hour the galaxy,  
together with the age of Brahmā;  
master of psychic properties, and passing away and rebirth,  
sees the gods at that time.”

910“In the past I was Annabhāra,  
a poor carrier of fodder.  
I practiced as an ascetic,  
the renowned Upariṭṭha.

911Then I was reborn in the Sakyan clan,  
where I was known as ‘Anuruddha’.  
Surrounded by song and dance,  
I was awakened by cymbals and gongs.

912Then I saw the Buddha,  
the Teacher, fearing nothing from any quarter;  
filling my mind with confidence in him,  
I went forth to homelessness.

913I know my past lives,  
the places I used to live.  
I was born as Sakka,  
and stayed among the thirty-three gods.

914Seven times I was a king of men  
ruling a kingdom,  
victorious in the four quarters,  
lord of the Black Plum Tree Land.  
Without rod or sword,  
I governed by principle.

915Seven from here, seven from there—  
fourteen transmigrations in all.  
I shall remember my past lives:  
at that time I stayed in the realm of the gods.

916I have gained complete tranquility  
in immersion with five factors.  
Peaceful, serene,  
my clairvoyance is purified.

917Steady in five-factored absorption, I know the passing away and rebirth of beings,  
their coming and going,  
their lives in this state and that.

918I’ve served the teacher  
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  
The heavy burden is laid down,  
the conduit to rebirth is eradicated.

919In the Vajjian village of Veḷuva,  
my life will come to an end.  
Beneath a thicket of bamboos,  
being undefiled, I will be fully quenched.”

##### Pārāpariya (3rd)

920This thought came to the ascetic  
in the forest full of flowers,  
as he was seated alone  
meditating in seclusion:

921“The behavior of the mendicants  
these days seems different  
from when the protector of the world,  
the best of men, was still here.

922Their robes were only for covering the private parts,  
and protection from the cold and wind.  
They ate in moderation,  
content with whatever they were offered.

923Whether food was refined or rough,  
a little or a lot,  
they ate only for sustenance,  
without greed or gluttony.

924They weren’t so very eager  
for the requisites of life,  
such as tonics and other necessities,  
as they were for the ending of defilements.

925In the wilderness, at a tree’s root,  
in caves and caverns,  
fostering seclusion,  
they lived with that as their final goal.

926They were used to simple things, unburdensome,  
gentle, not pompous at heart,  
unsullied, not scurrilous,  
their thoughts were intent on the goal.

927That’s why they inspired confidence,  
in their movements, eating, and practice;  
their deportment was as smooth  
as a stream of oil.

928With the utter ending of all defilements,  
those senior monks have now been quenched.  
They were great meditators and great benefactors—  
there are few like them today.

929With the ending  
of good principles and understanding,  
the victor’s teaching,  
full of all excellent qualities, has fallen apart.

930This is the season  
for bad principles and defilements.  
Those who are ready for seclusion  
are all that’s left of the true Dhamma.

931As they grow, the defilements  
possess most people;  
they play with fools, it seems to me,  
like monsters with the mad.

932Overcome by defilements,  
they run here and there  
among the bases for defilement,  
as if they had declared war on themselves.

933Having abandoned the true teaching,  
they argue with each other.  
Following wrong views  
they think, ‘This is better.’

934They cut off their wealth,  
children, and wife to go forth.  
But then they do what they shouldn’t,  
for the sake of a measly spoon of almsfood.

935They eat until their bellies are full,  
and then they lie to sleep on their backs.  
When they wake up, they keep on chatting,  
the kind of talk that the teacher criticized.

936Valuing all the arts and crafts,  
they train themselves in them.  
Not being settled inside, they think,  
‘This is the goal of the ascetic life.’

937They provide clay, oil, and talcum powder,  
water, lodgings, and food  
for householders,  
expecting more in return.

938And in addition, tooth-picks, portia flowers,  
flowers, food to eat,  
well-cooked almsfood,  
mangoes and myrobalans.

939In medicine they are like doctors,  
in business like householders,  
in makeup like prostitutes,  
in sovereignty like lords.

940Cheats, frauds,  
false witnesses, sly:  
using multiple plans,  
they enjoy things of the flesh.

941Pursuing shams, contrivances, and plans,  
by such means  
they accumulate a lot of wealth  
for the sake of their own livelihood.

942They assemble the community  
for business rather than Dhamma.  
They teach the Dhamma to others  
for gain, not for the goal.

943Those outside the Saṅgha  
quarrel over the Saṅgha’s property.  
Lacking conscience, they do not care  
that they live on the earnings of others.

944Some with shaven head and robe  
are not devoted to practice,  
but wish only to be honored,  
besotted with property and reverence.

945When things have come to this,  
it’s not easy these days  
to realize what has not yet been realized,  
or to preserve what has been realized.

946When shoeless on a thorny path,  
one would walk  
very mindfully;  
that’s how a sage should walk in the village.

947Remembering the meditators of old,  
and recollecting their conduct,  
even in the latter days,  
it’s still possible to realize freedom from death.”

948That is what the ascetic, whose faculties  
were fully developed, said in the sāl tree grove.  
The brahmin, the seer, became fully extinguished,  
putting an end to all future lives.
