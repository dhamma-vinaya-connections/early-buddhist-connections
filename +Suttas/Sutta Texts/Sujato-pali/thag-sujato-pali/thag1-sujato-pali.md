## Khuddaka Nikāya - The Minor Texts

## Theragatha - The Verses of the Senior Monks

- Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato and Jessica Walton

##### Subhūti

1My little hut is roofed and pleasant,  
Sheltered from the wind:  
so rain, heavens, as you please!  
My mind is serene and freed,  
I practice wholeheartedly: so rain, heavens!

That is how this verse was recited by the senior venerable Subhūti.

##### Mahākoṭṭhika

2Calm and still,  
thoughtful in counsel, not restless;  
he shakes off bad qualities,  
as the wind shakes leaves off a tree.

That is how this verse was recited by the senior venerable Mahākoṭṭhika.

##### Kankhārevata

3See this wisdom of the Realized Ones!  
Like a fire blazing in the night,  
giving light, giving vision,  
they dispel the doubt of those who’ve come here.

That is how this verse was recited by the senior venerable Revata the doubter.

##### Puṇṇa

4Associate only with the virtuous,  
those astute one wo see the goal.  
The wise ones, diligent and clear-seeing,  
realize the goal  
so great and profound,  
hard to see, subtle, and fine.

That is how this verse was recited by the senior venerable Puṇṇa son of Mantāṇī.

##### Dabba

5Once hard to tame, now tamed himself,  
clever, content, with doubt overcome.  
victorious since his fears have vanished,  
Dabba is steadfast, and has become fully quenched.

That is how this verse was recited by the senior venerable Dabba.

##### Sītavaniya

6The monk who went to the Cool Grove is solitary,  
content and serene,  
victorious, with goosebumps vanished,  
guarding mindfulness of the body, steadfast.

That is how this verse was recited by the senior venerable Sītavaniya.

##### Bhalliya

7He has swept away the army of the King of Death,  
as a fragile bridge of reeds by a great flood.  
Victorious since his fears have vanished,  
tame and steadfast, he has become quenched.

That is how this verse was recited by the senior venerable Bhalliya.

##### Vīra

8Once hard to tame, now tamed himself,  
a hero, content, with doubt overcome,  
victorious, with goosebumps vanished,  
Vīra is steadfast and has become fully quenched.

That is how this verse was recited by the senior venerable Vīra.

##### Pilindavaccha

9It was welcome, not unwelcome,  
The advice I got was good.  
Of the well-explained teachings,  
I arrived at the best.

That is how this verse was recited by the senior venerable Pilindavaccha.

##### Puṇṇamāsa

10A knowledge master, peaceful and self-controlled,  
is rid of concern for this world and the world beyond.  
Unsullied in the midst of all things,  
they'd know the arising and passing of the world.

That is how this verse was recited by the senior venerable Puṇṇamāsa.

##### Cūḷavaccha

11A monk full of joy  
In the teaching proclaimed by the Buddha  
would realise the peaceful state:  
the blissful stilling of conditions.

##### Mahāvaccha

12Empowered by wisdom, with precepts and observances intact,  
serene, loving absorption, mindful,  
eating just the needed food,  
one should await one’s time here, free of desire.

##### Vanavaccha

13Glistening, they look like blue storm clouds,  
with waters cool and streams so clear,  
and covered all in ladybugs:  
these rocky crags delight me!

##### Novice Sivaka

14My mentor said to me:  
"Let’s leave here, Sīvaka."  
My body lives in the village,  
but my mind has gone to the wilderness.  
I go there even when lying down;  
you can't snare those who know.

##### Kuṇḍadhāna

15Five to cut off, five to drop, and five more to develop.  
When a mendicant slips five chains  
they're said to have crossed the flood.

##### Belaṭṭhasīsa

16Just as a fine thoroughbred  
proceeds with ease,  
tail and mane flying in the wind;  
so my days and nights  
proceed with ease,  
full of joy not of the flesh.

##### Dāsaka

17One who gets drowsy from overeating,  
fond of sleep, rolling round the bed,  
like a great hog stuffed with grain:  
that idiot is reborn again and again.

##### Siṅgālapitu

18There was an heir of the Buddha,  
a monk in Bhesakaḷā forest,  
who suffused the entire earth  
with the perception of bones.  
I think he will quickly  
get rid of sensual desire.

##### Kula

19Irrigators guide water,  
fletchers shape arrows,  
carpenters carve timbere;  
those true to their vows tame themselves.

##### Ajita

20I do not fear death;  
nor do I long for life.  
I’ll lay down this body,  
aware and mindful.

##### Nigrodha

21I’m not afraid of fear.  
for our teacher is expert in freedom from death;  
Mendicants advance by the path  
where no fear remains.

##### Cittaka

22Crested peacocks with beautiful blue necks  
cry out in Karaṁvī.  
Stirred by a cool breeze,  
they wake the sleeper to practice absorption.

##### Gosāla

23I’ll eat honey and milk-rice  
in Veḷugumba,  
And then, skilfully scrutinizing  
the rise and fall of the aggregates,  
I’ll return to my forest hill,  
and foster seclusion.

##### Sugandha

24See the excellence of the teaching!  
Just one raint season after I went forth,  
I attained the three knowledges  
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

##### Nandiya

25Dark One, if you attack such a monk,  
one who has arrived at the fruit,  
and whose mind is always full of light,  
you’ll fall into suffering.

##### Abhaya

26Having heard the fine words  
of the Buddha, the Kinsman of the Sun,  
I penetrated the subtle truth,  
like a hair-tip with an arrow.

##### Lomasakangiya

27With my chest I’ll thrust aside  
the grasses, vines,  
reeds and creepers,  
and foster seclusion.

##### Jambugāmikaputta

28Aren’t you obsessed with clothes?  
Don’t you just love jewellery?  
Is it not you — and no-one else —  
who spreads the scent of virtue?

##### Hārita

29Straighten yourself,  
like a fletcher straightens an arrow.  
when your mind is upright, Hārita,  
break ignorance to bits!

##### Uttiya

30When I was ill in the past,  
mindfulness arose in me  
Now I am ill once more —  
it’s time for me to be heedful.

##### Gahvaratīriya

31Pestered by flies and mosquitoes  
in the wilds, the formidable forest;  
one should mindfully endure,  
like an elephant at the head of the battle.

##### Suppiya

32I’ll swap old age for the un-aging,  
burning for quenching:  
the ultimate peace,  
the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.

##### Sopāka

33Just as a mother would be good  
To her beloved only child;  
so, to creatures all and everywhere,  
let one be good.

##### Posiya

34It's always better for a smart person  
to avoid sharing a seat with such women.  
I went from the village to the wilderness;  
from there I entered a house.  
Though I was there to be fed,  
I got up and left without taking leave.

##### Sāmaññakāni

35Seeking happiness, they find it through this practice,  
They get a good reputation and grow in fame:  
those who develop the direct route:  
the noble eightfold path to realize freedom from death.

##### Kumāputta

36Learning is good, living well is good,  
the life without abode is always good.  
If they lose their meditation,  
Questions on the meaning, actions that are skillful:  
this is the ascetic life for one who has nothing.

##### Kumāputtasahāyaka

37Some travel to different countries,  
Wandering undisciplined.  
If they lose their meditation,  
what will such rotten conduct achieve?  
So you should dispel aggression,  
practising absoption undistracted.

##### Gavampati

38His psychic power made the river Sarabhu stand still;  
Gavampati is unbound and unperturbed.  
The gods bow to that great sage, who has slipped all chains,  
and gone beyond rebirth.

##### Tissa

39Like they're struck by a sword,  
like their head was on fire,  
a mendicant should wander mindful,  
to give up desire for sensual desire.

##### Vaḍḍhamāna

40Like they're struck by a sword,  
like their head was on fire,  
a mendicant should wander mindful,  
to give up desire for rebirth.

##### Sirivaḍḍha

41Lightning flashes down  
on the cleft of Vebhāra and Paṇḍava.  
But in the mountain cleft he is absorbed in jhāna—  
the son of the Buddha, inimitable and unaffected.

##### Khadiravaniya

42Cāla, Upacāla and Sīsupacāla  
meditate mindfully!  
I’ve come to you like a hair-splitter.

##### Sumaṅgala

43Well freed! Well freed!  
I’m very well freed from three crooked things:  
My sickles, my ploughs,  
and my little hoes.  
Even if they were here, right here —  
I’d be done with them, done!  
Practice absorbtion Sumaṅgala! Practice absorbtion Sumaṅgala!  
Stay heedful, Sumaṅgala!

##### Sānu

44Mum, they weep for the dead,  
or for one who's alive but has disappeared.  
I’m alive and you can see me,  
so mum, why do you weep for me?

##### Ramaṇīyavihāri

45Though a fine throroughbred may stumble,  
it soon stands firm again.  
Even so is one accomplished in vision,  
a disciple of the Buddha.

##### Samiddhi

46I went forth out of faith  
from the lay life to homelessness.  
My mindfulness and wisdom have grown,  
my mind is serene.  
Make whatever illusions you want,  
it doesn’t bother me.

##### Ujjaya

47Homage to you, O Buddha, O hero,  
freed in every way.  
Meditating in the fruits of your practice,  
I live without defilements.

##### Sañjaya

48Since I went forth  
from the lay life into homelessness,  
I’ve not been aware of any thought  
that is ignoble and hateful.

##### Rāmaṇeyyaka

49Even with all the sounds,  
the chirping and cheeping of birds,  
my mind doesn’t waver,  
for I’m devoted to oneness.

##### Vimala

50The rain falls and the wind blows on mother Earth,  
while lightning flashes across the sky!  
But my thoughts are stilled,  
My mind is serene.

##### Godhika

51The heavens rain like a sweet song;  
My little hut is roofed and pleasant, sheltered from the wind.  
My mind is serene:  
so rain forth heavens, if you wish.

##### Subāhu

52The heavens rains like a sweet song,  
My little hut is roofed and pleasant, sheltered from the wind.  
My mind is immersed in my body:  
So rain forth, heavens, if you wish.

##### Valliya

53The heavens rain like a sweet song.  
My little hut is roofed and pleasant, sheltered from the wind.  
I meditate there, diligent:  
So rain forth, heavens, if you wish.

##### Uttiya

54The heavens rain like a sweet song.  
My little hut is roofed and pleasant, sheltered from the wind.  
I dwell there without a partner:  
So rain forth, heavens, if you wish.

##### Añjanavaniya

55I plunged into the Añjana forest  
and made a little hut to live in.  
I’ve attained the three knowledges  
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

##### Kuṭivihāri

56“Who is in this little hut?” “A monk is in this little hut,  
free of lust, his mind serene.  
My friend, you should know this:  
your little hut wasn’t built in vain."

##### Dutiyakuṭivihāri

57This was your old hut,  
but you still want a new hut.  
Let go of hope for a hut, monk!  
A new hut will only bring more suffering.

##### Ramaṇīyakuṭika

58My little hut is pleasing, delightful,  
a gift given in faith.  
I’ve no need of girls:  
go, ladies, to those in need!

##### Kosalavihāri

59I went forth out of faith  
and built a little hut in the wilderness.  
I’m heedful, ardent,  
aware, and mindful.

##### Sīvali

60My wishes—the purpose I had  
for entering this hut—came true.  
Abandoning the tendency to conceit,  
I’ll realize knowledge and liberation.

##### Vappa

61One who sees  
sees those who see and those who don’t.  
One who doesn’t see  
sees neither.

##### Vajjiputta

62We dwell alone in the wilderness,  
like a log rejected in a forest.  
Lots of people are jealous of me,  
as beings in hell are of one going to heaven.

##### Pakkha

63They fall, collapsed and fallen;  
greedy, they return.  
The work is done, the joyful is enjoyed,  
happiness is found through happiness.

##### Vimalakoṇḍañña

64I arose from the one named after a tree,  
I was born of the one whose banner shines.  
The banner killer has destroyed the great banner,  
by means of the banner itself.

##### Ukkhepakatavaccha

65Vaccha has tossed away  
What he built over many years.  
Sitting comfortably, uplifted with joy,  
he teaches this to householders.

##### Meghiya

66He counselled me, the great hero,  
the one who has gone beyond all things.  
When I heard his teaching  
I stayed close by him, mindful.  
I’ve attained the three knowledges  
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

##### Ekadhammasavanīya

67My defilements have been burnt away by practising absorption—  
rebirth into all states of existence is eradicated,  
transmigraton through births is finished,  
now there'll be no more future lives.

##### Ekudāniya

68A sage with higher consciousness, diligent,  
training in the ways of sagacity:  
there are no sorrows for the unaffected,  
calm and ever mindful.

##### Channa

69Hearing the sweet Dhamma taught by the master,  
all-knowing, of superb knowledge,  
I’ve entered the path to realize freedom from death—  
he is the expert on the road to safety from the yoke.

##### Puṇṇa

70Ethical conduct is best in this life,  
but one with wisdom is supreme.  
Someone with both virtue and wisdom  
is victorious among men and gods.

##### Vacchapāla

71For one who sees the meaning so very subtle and fine;  
who is skilled in thought and humble in manner;  
who has cultivated mature ethics,  
it’s not hard to gain extinguishment.

##### Ātuma

72A young bamboo is hard to extract  
when the point is grown and it’s become woody;  
That’s how I feel with the wife who was arranged for me.  
Give me permission — now I’ve gone forth.

##### Māṇava

73Seeing an old person, and one suffering from disease,  
and a corpse come to the end of life,  
I went forth, becoming a wanderer,  
and giving up the pleasures of the senses.

##### Suyāmana

74Sensual desire, ill will,  
dullness and drowsiness,  
restlessness, and doubt  
are not found in a monk at all.

##### Susārada

75Good is the sight of those who’ve practised well;  
dubt is cut off and intelligence grows.  
even a fool grows wise!  
That’s why it’s good to meet good people.

##### Piyañjaha

76Settle down when others spring up;  
spring up when others settle down;  
Remain when others have departed;  
don't delight when others delight.

##### Hatthārohaputta

77In the past my mind wandered  
How it wished, where it liked, as it pleased.  
Now I’ll carefully guide it,  
as a trainer with a hook guides a rutting elephant.

##### Meṇḍasira

78Transmigrating through countless rebirths,  
I’ve journeyed without reward.  
I’ve suffered, but now  
the mass of suffering has fallen away.

##### Rakkhita

79All my lust is given up,  
All my hate is eradicated,  
all my delusion is gone;  
I’m cooled, quenched.

##### Ugga

80Any deeds I have done,  
a little or a lot,  
are all completely exhausted;  
Now there are no more future lives.

##### Samitigutta

81Any bad things I’ve done  
in previous lives,  
are to be experienced right here,  
not in any other place.

##### Kassapa

82Go, child, to any place  
where there’s plenty of food,  
where it's safe and free of peril —  
may you not be overcome by sorrow!

##### Sīha

83Meditate diligently, Sīha,  
tireless all day and night.  
Develop skilful qualities,  
and quickly discard this bag of bones.

##### Nīta

84Sleeping all night,  
happily socializing by day,  
when will the fool  
make an end of suffering?

##### Sunāga

85Skilled in the patterns of the mind,  
understanding the nectar of seclusion,  
practicing absorbtion, alert, mindful:  
such a person would realize pleasure not of the flesh.

##### Nāgita

86Elsewhere there are many other doctrines;  
paths that, unlike this, don't lead to extinguishment.  
For the Buddhas himself instructs the Saṅgha;  
the Teacher shows the palms of his hands.

##### Paviṭṭha

87The aggregates are seen as they truly are;  
all rebirths are shattered,  
transmigration through births is finished,  
now there are no more future lives.

##### Ajjuna

88I was able to lift myself up  
from the water to the shore.  
While being swept away by the great flood,  
I penetrated the truths.

##### Devasabha

89I’ve crossed the bogs,  
I’ve avoided the cliffs,  
I’m freed from floods and ties,  
and I've wiped out all conceit.

##### Sāmidatta

90The five aggregates are fully understood;  
They remain, but their root is cut.  
Transmigration through births is finished,  
now there'll be no more future lives.

##### Paripuṇṇaka

91What I consumed today is considered better  
Than delicious grain of a hundred flavors—  
the Dhamma taught by the Buddha,  
Gotama of infinite vision.

##### Vijaya

92One whose defilements are ended;  
who’s not attached to food;  
whose resort is the liberation  
of the signless and the empty:  
their track is hard to trace,  
like birds in the sky.

##### Eraka

93Sensual pleasures are suffering, Eraka!  
Sensual pleasures aren’t happiness, Eraka!  
One who enjoys sensual pleasures  
enjoys suffering, Eraka!  
One who doesn’t enjoy sensual pleasures  
Doesn’t enjoy suffering, Eraka!

##### Mettaji

94Homage to that Blessed One,  
The glorious Sakyan!  
Having reached the best,  
he beautifully taught the best teaching. .

##### Cakkhupāla

95I’m blind, my eyes are ruined,  
I’m travelling a desolate road.  
Even if I have to crawl I’ll keep going —  
though not with wicked companions.

##### Khaṇḍasumana

96I offered a single flower,  
and then amused myself in heavens  
For 800 million years;  
with what’s left over I’ve become quenched.

##### Tissa

97Giving up a valuable bronze bowl,  
and a precious golden one, too,  
I took a bowl made of clay:  
this is my second initiation.

##### Abhaya

98When you see a sight, mindfulness is lost  
as you focus on a pleasant feature.  
Experiencing it with a mind full of desire,  
you keep clinging to it.  
Your defilements grow,  
leading to the root of rebirth.

##### Uttiya

99When you hear a sound, mindfulness is lost  
as you focus on a pleasant feature  
Experiencing it with a mind full of desire,  
you keep clinging to it.  
Your defilements grow,  
Leading to transmigration.

##### Devasabha

100Accomplished in the four right efforts,  
mindfulness meditation is your territory;  
festooned with the flowers of liberation,  
undefiled, you’ll be fully quenched.

##### Belaṭṭhānika

101He’s given up the household life, but he has no purpose,  
Living for his belly, lazy, he uses his snout as a plow,  
like a great hog stuffed with grain.  
That idiot is reborn again and again.

##### Setuccha

102Deceived by conceit,  
defiled among conditions,  
oppressed by gain and loss,  
they don’t reach immersion.

##### Bandhura

103I have no need of this —  
I’m happy and satisfied with the sweet teaching.  
I’ve drunk the best, the supreme nectar:  
I won’t go near poison.

##### Khitaka

104Hey! My body is light,  
full of so much rapture and happiness.  
My body feels like it’s floating,  
like cotton on the wind.

##### Malitavambha

105Dissatisfied, one should not stay;  
and even if happy, one should depart.  
One who sees clearly wouldn’t stay  
In a place that was not conducive to the goal.

##### Suhemanta

106Though the meaning has a hundred facets,  
and bears a hundred characteristics,  
the fool sees only one factor,  
while the sage sees a hundred.

##### Dhammasava

107After investigating, I went forth  
From the lay life into homelessness.  
I’ve attained the three knowledges  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

##### Dhammasavapitu

108At 120 years old  
I went forth to homelessness.  
I’ve attained the three knowledges  
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

##### Saṁgharakkhita

109Even on retreat he doesn’t heed the counsel  
of the one with supreme compassion for his welfare.  
He lives with unrestrained faculties,  
like a young deer in the woods.

##### Usabha

110The trees on the mountain-tops have grown tall,  
freshly sprinkled by towering clouds.  
For Usabha, who loves seclusion, and who thinks only of wilderness,  
goodness flourishes more and more.

##### Jenta

111Going forth is hard; living at home is hard;  
Dhamma is profound; money is hard to come by.  
Getting by is difficult for we who accept whatever comes,  
so we should always think about impermanence.

##### Vacchagotta

112I am a master of the three knowledges, I’m a great meditator,  
an expert in serenity of heart.  
I’ve realized my own true goal,  
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

##### Vanavaccha

113The water's clear and the rocks are broad,  
monkeys and deer are all around;  
festooned with dewy moss,  
these rocky crags delight me!

##### Adhimutta

114Your body is uncomfortably heavy,  
and life is running out;  
greedy for physical pleasure,  
how can you find happiness as an ascetic?

##### Mahānāma

115By Mount Nesādaka,  
with its famous covering  
of abundant shrubs and trees,  
you’re found deficient.

##### Pārāpariya

116I’ve given up the six spheres of sense-contact,  
My sense-doors are guarded and well restrained;  
I’ve ejected the root of misery,  
And attained the end of defilements.

##### Yasa

117I’m well-anointed and well-dressed,  
adorned with all my jewellery.  
I’ve attained the three knowledges  
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

##### Kimila

118Old age falls like a curse;  
It’s the same body, but it seems like someone else’s.  
I remember myself as if I were someone else,  
but I’m still the same, I haven’t been away.

##### Vajjiputta

119You’ve left for the jungle, the root of a tree,  
with extinguishment in your heart.  
Practice absorption, Gotama, don’t be negligent.  
What is this hullabaloo to you?

##### Isidatta

120The five aggregates are fully understood,  
they remain, but their root is cut.  
I have reached the end of suffering  
and attained the ending of defilements.
