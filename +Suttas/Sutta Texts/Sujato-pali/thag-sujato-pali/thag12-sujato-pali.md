## Khuddaka Nikāya - The Minor Texts

## Theragatha - The Verses of the Senior Monks

### Chapter 12: Groups of Twelve Verses

- Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato and Jessica Walton

##### 12.1 Sīlava

608One should train just in ethical conduct,  
for in this world, when ethical conduct is  
cultivated and well-trained,  
it provides all success.

609Wishing for three kinds of happiness—  
praise, prosperity,  
and to delight in heaven after passing away—  
the wise would take care of their ethics.

---

610The well-behaved have many friends,  
because of their self-restraint.  
But one lacking ethics, of bad conduct,  
drives away their friends.

611A person whose ethics are bad has  
ill-repute and infamy.  
A person whose conduct is ethical always has  
a good reputation, fame, and praise.

612Ethical conduct is the starting point and foundation;  
the mother at the head  
of all good things:  
that’s why you should purify your ethics.

613Ethics provide a boundary and a restraint,  
an enjoyment for the mind;  
the ford where all the Buddhas cross over:  
that’s why you should purify your ethics.

---

614Ethics are the matchless power;  
ethics are the ultimate weapon;  
ethics are the best ornament;  
ethics are a marvelous coat of armor.

615Ethics are a mighty bridge;  
ethics are the unsurpassed scent;  
ethics are the best perfume,  
that float from place to place.

616Ethics are the best provision;  
ethics are the unsurpassed supply for a journey;  
ethics are the best vehicle  
that take you from place to place.

617In this life they’re criticized;  
after departing they grieve in a lower realm;  
a fool is unhappy everywhere,  
because they are unsteady in ethics.

---

618In this life they’re renowned;  
after departing they’re happy in heaven;  
a wise one is happy everywhere,  
because they are steady in ethics.

619Ethical conduct is best in this life,  
but one with wisdom is supreme.  
Someone with both virtue and wisdom  
is victorious among men and gods.

##### 12.2 Sunīta

620I was born in a low-class family.  
We were poor, with little to eat.  
My job was lowly—  
I threw out the old flowers.

621Shunned by people,  
I was disregarded and held in contempt.  
I humbled my heart  
and paid respects to many people.

622Then I saw the Buddha  
at the fore of the mendicant Saṅgha;  
the great hero  
was entering the capital city of the Magadhans.

623I dropped my flail  
and approached to pay homage.  
Out of sympathy for me,  
the supreme man stood still.

624When I had paid homage at the Teacher’s feet,  
I stood to one side  
and asked the supreme being  
for the going-forth.

625Then the Teacher, being sympathetic,  
and having sympathy for the whole world,  
said to me, “Come, monk!”  
That was my ordination.

626Staying alone in the wilderness,  
meditating tirelessly,  
I have completed what the Teacher taught,  
just as the victor advised me.

627In the first watch of the night,  
I recollected my past lives.  
In the middle watch,  
I purified my clairvoyance.  
In the last watch,  
I shattered the mass of darkness.

628At the end of the night,  
as the sunrise drew near,  
Indra and Brahmā came  
and revered me with joined hands.

629“Homage to you, O thoroughbred!  
Homage to you, supreme among men!  
Since your defilements are ended,  
you, sir, are worthy of a religious donation.”

630When he saw me honored  
by the assembly of gods,  
the teacher smiled  
and said the following:

631“By fervor and spiritual practice,  
by restraint and by self-control:  
that’s how to become a brahmin,  
this is the supreme brahmin.”
