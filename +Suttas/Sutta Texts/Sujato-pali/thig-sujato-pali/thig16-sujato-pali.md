##### Sumedhā

450 In Mantāvatī city, Sumedhā,  
the daughter of King Koñca’s chief queen,  
was converted by those  
who practice the Buddha’s teaching.

451 She was virtuous, a brilliant speaker,  
learned, and trained in the Buddha’s instructions.  
She went up to her mother and father and said:  
“Pay heed, both of you!

452 I delight in extinguishment!  
No life is eternal, not even that of the gods;  
what then of sensual pleasures, so hollow,  
offering little gratification and much anguish.

453 Sensual pleasures are bitter as the venom of a snake,  
yet fools are infatuated by them.  
Sent to hell for a very long time,  
they are beaten and tortured.

454 Those who grow in wickedness  
always sorrow in the underworld due to their own bad deeds.  
They’re fools, unrestrained in body,  
mind, and speech.

455 Those witless, senseless fools,  
obstructed by the origin of suffering,  
are ignorant, not understanding the noble truths  
when they are being taught.

456 Most people, mum, ignorant of the truths  
taught by the excellent Buddha,  
look forward to the next life,  
longing for rebirth among the gods.

457 Yet even rebirth among the gods  
in an impermanent state is not eternal.  
But fools are not scared  
of being reborn time and again.

458 Four lower realms and two other realms  
may be gained somehow or other.  
But for those who end up in a lower realm,  
there is no way to go forth in the hells.

459 May you both grant me permission to go forth  
in the dispensation of him of the ten powers.  
Living at ease, I shall apply myself  
to giving up rebirth and death.

460 What’s the point in hope, in a new life,  
in this useless, hollow body?  
Grant me permission, I shall go forth  
to make an end of craving for a new life.

461 A Buddha has arisen, the time has come,  
the unlucky moment has passed.  
As long as I live I’ll never betray  
my ethical precepts or my celibate path.”

462 Then Sumedhā said to her parents:  
“So long as I remain a lay person,  
I’ll refuse to eat any food,  
until I’ve fallen under the sway of death.”

463 Upset, her mother burst into tears,  
while her father, though grieved,  
tried his best to persuade her  
as she lay collapsed on the longhouse roof.

464 “Get up child, why do you grieve so?  
You’re already betrothed to be married!  
King Anīkaratta the handsome  
is in Vāraṇavatī: he is your betrothed.

465 You shall be the chief queen,  
wife of King Anīkaratta.  
Ethical precepts, the celibate path—  
going forth is hard to do, my child.

466 As a royal there is command, wealth, authority,  
and the happiness of possessions.  
Enjoy sensual pleasures while you’re still young!  
Let your wedding take place, my child!”

467 Then Sumedhā said to him:  
“Let this not come to pass! Existence is hollow!  
I shall either go forth or die,  
but I shall never marry.

468 Why cling to this rotting body so foul,  
stinking of fluids,  
a horrifying water-bag of corpses,  
always oozing, full of filth?

469 Knowing it like I do, what’s the point?  
A carcass is vile, smeared with flesh and blood,  
food for birds and swarms of worms—  
why have we been given it?

470 Before long the body, bereft of consciousness,  
is carried out to the charnel ground,  
to be tossed aside like an old log  
by relatives in disgust.

471 When they’ve tossed it away in the charnel ground,  
to be eaten by others, your own parents  
bathe themselves, disgusted;  
what then of people at large?

472 They’re attached to this hollow carcass,  
this mass of sinews and bone;  
this rotting body  
full of saliva, tears, feces, and pus.

473 If anyone were to dissect it,  
turning it inside out,  
the unbearable stench  
would disgust even their own mother.

474 Properly examining  
the aggregates, elements, and sense fields  
as conditioned, rooted in birth, suffering—  
why would I wish for marriage?

475 Let three hundred sharp swords  
fall on my body everyday!  
Even if the slaughter lasted 100 years  
it’d be worth it if it led to the end of suffering.

476 One who understands the Teacher’s words  
would put up with this slaughter:  
‘Long for you is transmigration  
being killed time and time again.’

477 Among gods and humans,  
in the realm of animals or that of demons,  
among the ghosts or in the hells,  
endless killings are seen.

---

478 The hells are full of killing,  
for the corrupt who have fallen to the underworld.  
Even among the gods there is no shelter,  
for no happiness excels extinguishment.

479 Those who are committed to the dispensation  
of him of the ten powers attain extinguishment.  
Living at ease, they apply themselves  
to giving up rebirth and death.

480 On this very day, dad, I shall renounce:  
what’s to enjoy in hollow riches?  
I’m disillusioned with sensual pleasures,  
they’re like vomit, made like a palm stump.”

481 As she spoke thus to her father,  
Anīkaratta, to whom she was betrothed,  
approached from Vāraṇavatī  
at the time appointed for the marriage.

482 Then Sumedhā took up a knife,  
and cut off her hair, so black, thick, and soft.  
Shutting herself in the longhouse,  
she entered the first absorption.

483 And as she entered it there,  
Anīkaratta arrived at the city.  
Then in the longhouse, Sumedhā  
well developed the perception of impermanence.

484 As she investigated in meditation,  
Anīkaratta quickly climbed the stairs.  
His limbs adorned with gems and gold,  
he begged Sumedhā with joined palms:

485 “As a royal there is command, wealth, authority,  
and the happiness of possessions.  
Enjoy sensual pleasures while you’re still young!  
Sensual pleasures are hard to find in the world!

486 I’ve handed royalty to you—  
enjoy riches, give gifts!  
Don’t be sad;  
your parents are upset.”

487 Sumedhā, having no use for sensual pleasures,  
and having done away with delusion, spoke right back:  
“Do not take pleasure in sensuality!  
See the danger in sensual pleasures!

488 Mandhātā, king of four continents,  
foremost in enjoying sensual pleasures,  
died unsated,  
his desires unfulfilled.

489 Were the seven jewels to rain from the sky  
all over the ten directions,  
there would be no sating of sensual pleasures:  
people die insatiable.

490 Like a butcher’s knife and chopping block,  
sensual pleasures are like a snake’s head.  
They burn like a fire-brand,  
they resemble a skeleton.

491 Sensual pleasures are impermanent and unstable,  
they’re full of suffering, a terrible poison;  
like a hot iron ball,  
the root of misery, their fruit is pain.

492 Sensual pleasures are like fruits of a tree,  
like lumps of meat, painful,  
they trick you like a dream;  
sensual pleasures are like borrowed goods.

493 Sensual pleasures are like swords and stakes;  
a disease, a boil, misery and trouble.  
Like a pit of glowing coals,  
the root of misery, fear and slaughter.

494 Thus sensual pleasures have been explained  
to be obstructions, so full of suffering.  
Please leave! As for me,  
I have no trust in a new life.

495 What can someone else do for me  
when their own head is burning?  
When stalked by old age and death,  
you should strive to destroy them.”

496 She opened the door  
and saw her parents with Anīkaratta,  
sitting crying on the floor.  
And so she said this:

497 “Transmigration is long for fools,  
crying again and again at that with no known beginning—  
the death of a father,  
the killing of a brother or of themselves.

498 Remember the ocean of tears, of milk, of blood—  
transmigration with no known beginning.  
Remember the bones piled up  
by beings transmigrating.

499 Remember the four oceans  
compared with tears, milk, and blood.  
Remember bones piled up high as Mount Vipula  
in the course of a single eon.

500 Transmigration with no known beginning  
is compared to this broad land of India;  
if divided into lumps the size of jujube seeds,  
they’d still be fewer than his mother’s mothers.

501 Remember the grass, sticks, and leaves,  
compare that with no known beginning:  
if split into pieces four inches in size,  
they’d still be fewer than his father’s fathers.

502 Remember the one-eyed turtle and the yoke with a hole  
blown in the ocean from east to west—  
sticking the head in the hole  
is a metaphor for gaining a human birth.

503 Remember the form of this unlucky body,  
insubstantial as a lump of foam.  
See the aggregates as impermanent,  
remember the hells so full of anguish.

504 Remember those swelling the charnel grounds  
again and again in life after life.  
Remember the threat of the marsh crocodile!  
Remember the four truths!

505 When the deathless is there to be found,  
why would you drink the five bitter poisons?  
For every enjoyment of sensual pleasures  
is so much more bitter than them.

506 When the deathless is there to be found,  
why would you burn for sensual pleasures?  
For every enjoyment of sensual pleasures  
is burning, boiling, bubbling, seething.

507 When there is freedom from enmity,  
why would you want your enemy, sensual pleasures?  
Like kings, fire, robbers, flood, and people you dislike,  
sensual pleasures are very much your enemy.

508 When liberation is there to be found,  
what good are sensual pleasures that kill and bind?  
For though unwilling, when sensual pleasures are there,  
they are subject to the pain of killing and binding.

509 As a blazing grass torch  
burns one who grasps it without letting go,  
sensual pleasures are like a grass torch,  
burning those who do not let go.

510 Don’t give up abundant happiness  
for the trivial joys of sensual pleasure.  
Don’t fret later,  
like a catfish on a hook.

511 Deliberately control yourself among sensual pleasures!  
You’re like a dog fixed to a chain:  
sensual pleasures will surely devour you  
as hungry outcasts would a dog.

512 Harnessed to sensual pleasure,  
you undergo endless pain,  
along with much mental anguish:  
relinquish sensual pleasures, they don’t last!

513 When the unaging is there to be found,  
what good are sensual pleasures in which is old age?  
All rebirths everywhere  
are bonded to death and sickness.

514 This is the ageless, this is the deathless!  
This is the ageless and deathless, the sorrowless state!  
Free of enmity, unconstricted,  
faultless, fearless, without tribulations.

515 This deathless has been realized by many;  
even today it can be obtained  
by those who properly apply themselves;  
but it’s impossible if you don’t try.”

516 So said Sumedhā,  
lacking delight in conditioned things.  
Soothing Anīkaratta,  
Sumedhā cast her hair on the ground.

517 Standing up, Anīkaratta  
raised his joined palms to her father and begged:  
“Let go of Sumedhā, so that she may go forth!  
She will see the truth of liberation.”

518 Released by her mother and father,  
she went forth, afraid of grief and fear.  
While still a trainee nun she realized the six direct knowledges,  
along with the highest fruit.

519 The extinguishment of the princess  
was incredible and amazing;  
on her deathbed, she declared  
her several past lives.

520 “In the time of the Buddha Koṇāgamana,  
we three friends gave the gift  
of a newly-built dwelling  
in the Saṅgha’s monastery.

521 Ten times, a hundred times,  
a thousand times, ten thousand times,  
we were reborn among the gods,  
let alone among humans.

522 We were mighty among the gods,  
let alone among humans!  
I was queen to a king with the seven treasures—  
I was the treasure of a wife.

523That was the cause, that the origin, that the root,  
that was the acceptance of the dispensation;  
that first meeting culminated in extinguishment  
for one delighting in the teaching.

524 So say those who have faith in the words  
of the one unrivaled in wisdom.  
They’re disillusioned with being reborn,  
and being disillusioned they become dispassionate.”
