##### Ambapālī

252 My hair was as black as bees,  
graced with curly tips;  
now old, it has become like hemp bark—  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

253 Crowned with flowers,  
my head was as fragrant as a perfume box;  
now old, it smells like dog fur—  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

254 My hair was as thick as a well-planted forest,  
it shone, parted with brush and pins;  
now old, it’s patchy and sparse—  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

255 With plaits of black and ribbons of gold,  
it was so pretty, adorned with braids;  
now old, my head’s gone bald—  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

256 My eyebrows used to look so nice,  
like crescents painted by an artist;  
now old, they droop with wrinkles—  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

257 My eyes shone brilliant as gems,  
wide and deepest blue;  
ruined by age, they shine no more—  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

258 My nose was like a perfect peak,  
lovely in my bloom of youth;  
now old, it’s shriveled like a pepper;  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

259 My ear-lobes were so pretty,  
like lovingly crafted bracelets;  
now old, they droop with wrinkles—  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

260 My teeth used to be so pretty,  
bright as a jasmine flower;  
now old, they’re broken and yellow—  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

261 My singing was sweet as a cuckoo  
wandering in the forest groves;  
now old, it’s patchy and croaking—  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

262 My neck used to be so pretty,  
like a polished shell of conch;  
now old, it’s bowed and bent—  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

263 My arms used to be so pretty,  
like rounded cross-bars;  
now old, they droop like a trumpet-flower tree—  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

264 My hands used to be so pretty,  
adorned with lovely golden rings;  
now old, they’re like red radishes—  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

265 My breasts used to be so pretty,  
swelling, round, close, and high;  
now they droop like water bags—  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

266 My body used to be so pretty,  
like a polished slab of gold;  
now it’s covered with fine wrinkles—  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

267 Both my thighs used to be so pretty,  
like an elephant’s trunk;  
now old, they’re like bamboo—  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

268 My calves used to be so pretty,  
adorned with cute golden anklets;  
now old, they’re like sesame sticks—  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

269 Both my feet used to be so pretty,  
plump as if with cotton-wool;  
now old, they’re cracked and wrinkly—  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

270 This bag of bones once was such,  
but now it’s withered, home to so much pain;  
like a house in decay with plaster crumbling—  
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

##### Rohinī

271 “You fell asleep saying ‘ascetics’;  
you woke up saying ‘ascetics’;  
you only praise ascetics, madam—  
surely you’ll become an ascetic.

>

272 You provide ascetics  
with abundant food and drink.  
I ask you now, Rohiṇī:  
why do you like ascetics?

273 They don’t like to work, they’re lazy,  
they live on charity;  
always on the lookout, greedy for sweets—  
so why do you like ascetics?”

274 “Dad, for a long time now  
you’ve questioned me about ascetics.  
I shall extol for you  
their wisdom, ethics, and vigor.

275 They like to work, they’re not lazy;  
by giving up greed and hate,  
they do the best kind of work—  
that’s why I like ascetics.

276 As for the three roots of evil,  
by pure deeds they shake them off.  
They have given up all wickedness—  
that’s why I like ascetics.

277 Their bodily actions are pure;  
their actions of speech likewise;  
their actions of mind are pure—  
that’s why I like ascetics.

278 Immaculate as a conch-shell,  
they’re pure inside and out,  
full of bright qualities—  
that’s why I like ascetics.

279 They’re learned and memorize the teaching,  
noble, living righteously,  
teaching the text and its meaning:  
that’s why I like ascetics.

280 They’re learned and memorize the teaching,  
noble, living righteously,  
unified in mind, and mindful—  
that’s why I like ascetics.

281 Traveling afar, and mindful,  
thoughtful in counsel, and stable,  
they understand the end of suffering—  
that’s why I like ascetics.

282 When they leave a village,  
they don’t look back with longing,  
but proceed without concern—  
that’s why I like ascetics.

283 They hoard no goods in storerooms,  
nor in pots or baskets.  
They seek food prepared by others—  
that’s why I like ascetics.

284 They don’t receive silver,  
or gold whether coined or uncoined;  
feeding on whatever comes that day,  
that’s why I like ascetics.

285 They have gone forth from different families,  
even different countries,  
and yet they all love one another—  
that’s why I like ascetics.”

286 “Dear Rohinī, it was truly for our benefit  
that you were born in our family!  
You have faith and such keen respect  
for the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha.

287 For you understand this  
supreme field of merit.  
These ascetics will henceforth  
receive our religious donation, too.

288 For there we will place our sacrifice,  
and it shall be abundant.”  
“If you fear suffering,  
if you don’t like suffering,

289 go for refuge to the Buddha, the poised,  
to his teaching and to the Saṅgha.  
Undertake the precepts,  
that will be good for you.”

290 “I go for refuge to the Buddha, the poised,  
to his teaching and to the Saṅgha.  
I undertake the precepts,  
that will be good for me.

291 In the past I was related to Brahmā,  
now I genuinely am a brahmin.  
Possessing the three knowledges, I’m a genuine scholar,  
I’m a knowledge master, a bathed initiate.”

##### Cāpā

292 “Once I carried a hermit’s staff,  
but these days I hunt deer.  
My desires have made me unable to cross  
from the awful marsh to the far shore.

293 Thinking me so in love with her,  
Cāpā kept our son happy.  
Having cut Cāpā’s bond,  
I’ll go forth once again.”

294 “Don’t be mad at me, great hero!  
Don’t be mad at me, great sage!  
If you’re mired in anger you can’t stay pure,  
let alone practice austerities.”

295 “I’m going to leave Nālā!  
For who’d stay here at Nālā!  
With their figures, the women trap  
ascetics who live righteously.”

296 “Please, Kāḷa, come back to me.  
Enjoy pleasures like you did before.  
I’ll be under your control,  
along with any relatives I have.”

297 “Cāpā, if even a quarter  
of what you say were true,  
it would be a splendid thing  
for a man in love with you!”

298 “Kāḷa, I am like a sprouting iris  
flowering on a mountain top,  
like a blossoming pomegranate,  
like a trumpet-flower tree on an isle;

299 my limbs are anointed with yellow sandalwood,  
and I wear the finest Kāsi cloth:  
when I am so very beautiful,  
how can you abandon me and leave?”

300 “You’re like a fowler  
who wants to catch a bird;  
but you won’t trap me  
with your captivating form.”

301 “But this child, my fruit,  
was begotten by you, Kāḷa.  
When I have this child,  
how can you abandon me and leave?”

302 “The wise give up  
children, family, and wealth.  
Great heroes go forth  
like elephants breaking their bonds.”

303 “Now, this son of yours:  
I’ll strike him to the ground right here,  
with a stick or with a knife!  
Grieving your son, you will not leave.”

304 “Even if you feed our son  
to jackals and dogs,  
I’d never return again, you bitch,  
not even for the child’s sake.”

305 “Well then, sir, tell me,  
where will you go, Kāḷa?  
To what village or town,  
city or capital?”

306 “Last time we had followers,  
we weren’t ascetics, we just thought we were.  
We wandered from village to village,  
to cities and capitals.

307 But now the Blessed One, the Buddha,  
on the bank of the Nerañjara River,  
teaches the Dhamma so that living creatures  
may abandon all suffering.  
I shall go to his presence,  
he shall be my Teacher.”

308 “Now please convey my respects  
to the supreme protector of the world.  
Circling him to your right,  
dedicate my religious donation.”

309 “This is the proper thing to do,  
just as you have said to me.  
I’ll convey your respects  
to the supreme protector of the world.  
Circling him to my right,  
I’ll dedicate your religious donation.”

310 Then Kāḷa set out  
for the bank of the Nerañjara River.  
He saw the Awakened One  
teaching the deathless state:

---

311 suffering, suffering’s origin,  
suffering’s transcendence,  
and the noble eightfold path  
that leads to the stilling of suffering.

312 He paid homage at his feet,  
circling him to his right,  
and conveyed Cāpā’s dedication;  
then he went forth to homelessness.  
He attained the three knowledges,  
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

##### Sundarī

313 “Before, when your children passed away,  
you would expose them to be eaten.  
All day and all night  
you’d be racked with despair.

314 Today, brahmin lady, you have exposed  
seven children in all to be eaten;  
Vāseṭṭhī, what is the reason why  
you’re not so filled with despair?”

315 “Many hundreds of children,  
hundreds of family circles,  
both mine and yours, brahmin,  
have been eaten in the past.

316 Having known the escape  
from rebirth and death  
I neither grieve nor lament,  
nor do I despair.”

---

317 “Wow, Vaseṭṭhī, the words you speak  
really are amazing!  
Whose teaching did you understand  
that you say these things?”

318 “Brahmin, the Awakened One  
at the city of Mithilā,  
teaches the Dhamma so that living creatures  
may abandon all suffering.

319 After hearing the perfected one’s teaching,  
brahmin, which is free of all attachments,  
having understood the true teaching there,  
I’ve swept away grief for children.”

W

320 “I too shall go  
to the city of Mithilā.  
Hopefully the Buddha may release me  
from all suffering.”

321 The brahmin saw the Buddha,  
liberated, free of attachments.  
He taught him the Dhamma,  
the sage gone beyond suffering:

322 suffering, suffering’s origin,  
suffering’s transcendence,  
and the noble eightfold path  
that leads to the stilling of suffering.

323 Having understood the true teaching there,  
he chose to go forth.  
Three days later  
Sujāta realized the three knowledges.

324 “Please, charioteer, go;  
take back this carriage.  
Bidding my brahmin lady good health, say:  
‘The brahmin has now gone forth.  
After three days,  
Sujāta realized the three knowledges.’”

325 Then taking the carriage,  
along with a thousand coins, the charioteer  
bade the brahmin lady good health, and said:  
“The brahmin has now gone forth.  
After three days,  
Sujāta realized the three knowledges.”

326 Hearing that the brahmin had the three knowledges, the lady replied:  
“I present to you this horse and carriage,  
O charioteer, along with 1000 coins,  
and a full bowl as a gift.”

327 “Keep the horse and carriage, lady,  
along with the thousand coins.  
I too shall go forth in his presence,  
the one of such splendid wisdom.”

328 “Elephants, cattle, jeweled earrings,  
such opulent domestic wealth:  
having given it up, your father went forth,  
enjoy these riches Sundarī,  
you are the family heir.”

329 “Elephants, cattle, jeweled earrings,  
such delightful domestic wealth:  
having given it up, my father went forth,  
racked by grief for his son.  
I too shall go forth,  
racked by grief for my brother.”

330 “Sundarī, may the wish you desire  
come true.  
Leftovers as gleanings,  
and cast-off rags as robes—  
make do with these,  
free of defilements regarding the next life.”

331 “Ma’am, while I am still a trainee nun,  
my clairvoyance is clarified;  
I know my past lives,  
the places I used to live.

332 Relying on a fine lady like you,  
a senior nun who beautifies the Saṅgha,  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

>

333 Give me permission ma’am,  
I wish to go to Sāvatthī,  
where I shall roar my lion’s roar  
before the best of Buddhas.”

>

334 “Sundarī, see the Teacher!  
Golden colored, golden skinned,  
tamer of the untamed,  
the Awakened One who fears nothing from any quarter.”

335 “See Sundarī coming,  
liberated, free of attachments.  
desireless, detached,  
her task completed, without defilements.”

336 “Having set forth from Bārāṇasī  
and come to your presence, great hero,  
your disciple Sundarī  
bows at your feet.

337 You are the Buddha, you are the Teacher,  
I am your rightful daughter, brahmin,  
born of your mouth.  
I’ve completed the task and am free of defilements.”

338 “Then welcome, good lady,  
you’re by no means unwelcome.  
For this is how the tamed come  
bowing at the Teacher’s feet;  
desireless, detached,  
the task completed, without defilements.”

##### Subhā, the Smith’s Daughter

339 “I was so young, my clothes so fresh,  
at that time I heard the teaching.  
Being diligent,  
I comprehended the truth;

340 and then I became profoundly dispassionate  
towards all sensual pleasures.  
Seeing fear in identity,  
I longed for renunciation.

341 Giving up my family circle,  
bonded servants and workers,  
and my flourishing villages and lands,  
so delightful and pleasant,

342 I went forth;  
all that is no small wealth.  
Now that I’ve gone forth in faith like this,  
in the true teaching so well proclaimed,

343 since I desire to have nothing,  
it would not be appropriate  
to take back gold and money,  
having already got rid of them.

344 Money or gold  
doesn’t lead to peace and awakening.  
It doesn’t befit an ascetic,  
it’s not the wealth of the noble ones;

345 it’s just greed and vanity,  
confusion and growing decadence,  
dubious, troublesome—  
there is nothing lasting there.

346 Depraved and heedless,  
unenlightened folk, their hearts corrupt,  
fight each other,  
creating conflict.

347 Killing, caging, misery,  
loss, grief, and lamentation;  
those sunk in sensual pleasures  
see many disastrous things.

348 My family, why do you urge me on  
to pleasures, as if you were my enemies?  
You know I’ve gone forth,  
seeing fear in sensual pleasures.

349 It’s not due to gold, coined or uncoined,  
that defilements come to an end.  
Sensual pleasures are enemies and murderers,  
hostile forces that bind you to thorns.

350 My family, why do you urge me on  
to pleasures, as if you were my enemies?  
You know I’ve gone forth,  
shaven, wrapped in my outer robe.

351 Leftovers as gleanings,  
and cast-off rags as robes—  
that’s what’s fitting for me,  
the essentials of the homeless life.

352 Great hermits expel sensual pleasures,  
both human and divine.  
Safe in their sanctuary, they are freed,  
having found unshakable happiness.

353 May I not encounter sensual pleasures,  
for no shelter is found in them.  
Sensual pleasures are enemies and murderers,  
as painful as a bonfire.

354 Greed is an obstacle, a threat,  
full of anguish and thorns;  
it is out of balance,  
a great gateway to confusion.

355 Hazardous and terrifying,  
sensual pleasures are like a snake’s head,  
where fools delight,  
the blind ordinary folk.

356 Stuck in the swamp of sensuality,  
there are so many ignorant in the world.  
They know nothing of the end  
of rebirth and death.

357 Because of sensual pleasures,  
people jump right on to the path that goes to a bad place.  
So many walk the path  
that brings disease onto themselves.

358 That’s how sensual pleasures create enemies;  
they are so tormenting, so corrupting,  
trapping beings with the world’s material delights,  
they are nothing less than the bonds of death.

  

359 Maddening, enticing,  
sensual pleasures derange the mind.  
They’re a snare laid by Māra  
for the corruption of beings.

  

360 Sensual pleasures are infinitely dangerous,  
they’re full of suffering, a terrible poison;  
offering little gratification, they’re makers of strife,  
withering bright qualities away.

361 Since I’ve created so much ruination  
because of sensual pleasures,  
I will not relapse to them again,  
but will always delight in quenching.

362 Fighting against sensual pleasures,  
longing for that cool state,  
I shall meditate diligently  
for the ending of all fetters.

363 Sorrowless, stainless, secure:  
I’ll follow that path,  
the straight noble eightfold way  
by which the hermits have crossed over.”

---

364 “Look at this: Subhā the smith’s daughter,  
standing firm in the teaching.  
She has entered the imperturbable state,  
meditating at the root of a tree.

364 It’s just eight days since she went forth,  
full of faith in the beautiful teaching.  
Guided by Uppalavaṇṇā,  
she is master of the three knowledges, conqueror of death.

365 This one is freed from slavery and debt,  
a nun with faculties developed.  
Detached from all attachments,  
she has completed the task and is free of defilements.”

367Thus did Sakka, lord of all creatures,  
along with a host of gods,  
having come by their psychic powers,  
honor Subhā, the smith’s daughter.
