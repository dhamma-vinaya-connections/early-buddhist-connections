## 4:4 Eight on the Pure

788 “I see a pure being of ultimate wellness;  
it is vision that grants a person purity.”  
Recalling this notion of the ultimate,  
they believe in the notion that there is one who observes purity.

789 If a person were granted purity through vision,  
or if by a notion they could give up suffering,  
then one with attachments is purified by another:  
their view betrays them as one who asserts thus.

790 The brahmin speaks not of purity from another  
in terms of what is seen, heard, or thought; or by precepts or vows.  
They are unsullied in the midst of good and evil,  
letting go what was picked up, without creating anything new here.

---

791 Having let go the last they lay hold of the next;  
following impulse, they don’t get past the snare.  
They grab on and let go like a monkey  
grabbing and releasing a branch.

792 Having undertaken their own vows, a person  
visits various teachers, being attached to perception.  
One who knows, having comprehended the truth through the knowledges,  
does not visit various teachers, being of vast wisdom.

793 They are remote from all things  
seen, heard, or thought.  
Seeing them living openly,  
how could anyone in this world judge them?

794 They don’t make things up or promote them,  
or speak of the uttermost purity.  
After untying the tight knot of grasping  
they long for nothing in the world.

795 The brahmin has stepped over the boundary;  
knowing and seeing, they adopt nothing.  
Neither in love with passion nor besotted by dispassion,  
there is nothing here they adopt as the ultimate.

## Suddhaṭṭhakasutta

788Passāmi suddhaṁ paramaṁ arogaṁ,  
Diṭṭhena saṁsuddhi narassa hoti;  
Evābhijānaṁ paramanti ñatvā,  
Suddhānupassīti pacceti ñāṇaṁ.

789 Diṭṭhena ce suddhi narassa hoti,  
Ñāṇena vā so pajahāti dukkhaṁ;  
Aññena so sujjhati sopadhīko,  
Diṭṭhī hi naṁ pāva tathā vadānaṁ.

790 Na brāhmaṇo aññato suddhimāha,  
Diṭṭhe sute sīlavate mute vā;  
Puññe ca pāpe ca anūpalitto,  
Attañjaho nayidha pakubbamāno.

791 Purimaṁ pahāya aparaṁ sitāse,  
Ejānugā te na taranti saṅgaṁ;  
Te uggahāyanti nirassajanti,  
Kapīva sākhaṁ pamuñcaṁ gahāyaṁ.

792 Sayaṁ samādāya vatāni jantu,  
Uccāvacaṁ gacchati saññasatto;  
Vidvā ca vedehi samecca dhammaṁ,  
Na uccāvacaṁ gacchati bhūripañño.

793 Sa sabbadhammesu visenibhūto,  
Yaṁ kiñci diṭṭhaṁ va sutaṁ mutaṁ vā;  
Tameva dassiṁ vivaṭaṁ carantaṁ,  
Kenīdha lokasmi vikappayeyya.

794 Na kappayanti na purekkharonti,  
Accantasuddhīti na te vadanti;  
Ādānaganthaṁ gathitaṁ visajja,  
Āsaṁ na kubbanti kuhiñci loke.

795 Sīmātigo brāhmaṇo tassa natthi,  
Ñatvā va disvā va samuggahītaṁ;  
Na rāgarāgī na virāgaratto,  
Tassīdha natthi paramuggahītanti.

Suddhaṭṭhakasuttaṁ catutthaṁ.
