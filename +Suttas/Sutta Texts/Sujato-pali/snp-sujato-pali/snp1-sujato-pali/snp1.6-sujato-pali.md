## 1.6 Downfalls for a Lay Follower

So I have heard:

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, that deity addressed the Buddha in verse:

---

Deva

91“We ask Gotama  
about a man’s downfall.  
We have come to ask you sir:  
what leads to downfall?”

Buddha

92 “It’s easy to know success,  
and downfall is just as easy.  
One who loves the teaching succeeds,  
but a hater of the teaching meets their downfall.”

Deva

93 “We get what you’re saying,  
this is the first downfall.  
Tell us the second, Blessed One:  
what leads to downfall?”

Buddha

94 “The bad are dear to him,  
he has no love for the good.  
He believes the teaching of the bad;  
and that leads to his downfall.”

---

Deva

95 “We get what you’re saying,  
this is the second downfall.  
Tell us the third, Blessed One:  
what leads to downfall?”

Buddha

96 “Fond of sleep, fond of company,  
a man who does no work;  
he’s lazy, marked by anger,  
and that leads to his downfall.”

Deva

97 “We get what you’re saying,  
this is the third downfall.  
Tell us the fourth, Blessed One:  
what leads to downfall?”

Buddha

98 “Though able, he does not look after  
his mother and father  
when elderly, past their prime,  
and that leads to his downfall.”

Deva

99 “We get what you’re saying,  
this is the fourth downfall.  
Tell us the fifth, Blessed One:  
what leads to downfall?”

Buddha

100 “He deceives with lies  
ascetics and brahmins  
and other renunciates,  
and that leads to his downfall.”

Deva

101 “We get what you’re saying,  
this is the fifth downfall.  
Tell us the sixth, Blessed One:  
what leads to downfall?”

Buddha

102 “A man with plenty of wealth—  
gold and food—  
eats delicacies alone,  
and that leads to his downfall.”

Deva

103“We get what you’re saying,  
this is the sixth downfall.  
Tell us the seventh, Blessed One:  
what leads to downfall?”

Buddha

104“Vain of caste, wealth,  
and clan, a man  
looks down on his own family,  
and that leads to his downfall.”

Deva

105“We get what you’re saying,  
this is the seventh downfall.  
Tell us the eighth, Blessed One:  
what leads to downfall?”

Buddha

106“In womanizing, drinking,  
and gambling, a man  
wastes all that he has earned,  
and that leads to his downfall.”

Deva

107“We get what you’re saying,  
this is the eighth downfall.  
Tell us the ninth, Blessed One:  
what leads to downfall?”

Buddha

108“Not content with his own partners,  
he debauches himself with prostitutes,  
and with others’ partners,  
and that leads to his downfall.”

Deva

109“We get what you’re saying,  
this is the ninth downfall.  
Tell us the tenth, Blessed One:  
what leads to downfall?”

Buddha

110“A man well past his prime  
marries a girl with budding breasts;  
he cannot sleep for jealousy,  
and that leads to his downfall.”

---

Deva

111“We get what you’re saying,  
this is the tenth downfall.  
Tell us the eleventh, Blessed One:  
what leads to downfall?”

Buddha

112“He places in authority  
a woman or a man  
who’s a drunkard and a wastrel,  
and that leads to his downfall.”

Deva

113“We get what you’re saying,  
this is the eleventh downfall.  
Tell us the twelfth, Blessed One:  
what leads to downfall?”

Buddha

114“A man of little wealth and strong craving,  
born into an aristocratic family,  
sets his sights on kingship,  
and that leads to his downfall.

115Seeing these downfalls in the world,  
an astute and noble person,  
accomplished in vision,  
will enjoy a world of grace.”
