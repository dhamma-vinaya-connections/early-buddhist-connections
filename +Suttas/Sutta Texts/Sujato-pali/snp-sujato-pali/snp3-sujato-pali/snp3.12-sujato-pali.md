## 3:12 Contemplating Pairs

So I have heard:

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks. Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were so very silent. He addressed them:

“Suppose, mendicants, they questioned you thus: ‘There are skillful teachings that are noble, emancipating, and lead to awakening. What is the real reason for listening to such teachings?’ You should answer: ‘Only so as to truly know the pairs of teachings.’

---

And what pairs do they speak of?

‘This is suffering; this is the origin of suffering’: this is the first contemplation. ‘This is the cessation of suffering; this is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates rightly contemplating a pair of teachings in this way—diligent, keen, and resolute—they can expect one of two results: enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.”

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:

---

730 “There are those who don’t understand suffering  
and suffering’s cause,  
and where all suffering  
ceases with nothing left over.  
And they don’t know the path  
that leads to the stilling of suffering.

731 They lack the heart’s release,  
as well as the release by wisdom.  
Unable to make an end,  
they continue to be reborn and grow old.

732 But there are those who understand suffering  
and suffering’s cause,  
and where all suffering  
ceases with nothing left over.  
And they understand the path  
that leads to the stilling of suffering.

733 They’re endowed with the heart’s release,  
as well as the release by wisdom.  
Able to make an end,  
they don’t continue to be reborn and grow old.”

---

“Suppose, mendicants, they questioned you thus: ‘Could there be another way to contemplate the pairs?’ You should say, ‘There could.’ And how could there be?

‘All the suffering that originates is caused by attachment’: this is one contemplation. ‘With the utter cessation of attachment there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.” Then the Teacher went on to say:

“‘Whatever suffering arises, all is caused by attachments’, this is one observation. ‘With the complete ending of all attachments there is no arising of suffering’, this is a second observation. Rightly observing this duality, a monk who meditates diligent, ardent, and resolute may expect one of two results: final knowledge in this very life, or is there is anything left over, non-return."

This is what the Buddha said. Having said this, the Teacher, the Sublime One, said further:

---

734 “Attachment is the source of suffering  
in all its countless forms in the world.  
When an ignorant person builds up attachments,  
that idiot returns to suffering again and again.  
So let one who understands not build up attachments,  
contemplating the origin of suffering and rebirth.”

---

“Suppose, mendicants, they questioned you thus: ‘Could there be another way to contemplate the pairs?’ You should say, ‘There could.’ And how could there be?

‘All the suffering that originates is caused by ignorance’: this is one contemplation. ‘With the utter cessation of ignorance there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”

Then the Teacher went on to say:

---

735 “Those who journey again and again,  
transmigrating through birth and death;  
they go from this state to another,  
destined only for ignorance.

736 For ignorance is the great delusion  
because of which we have long transmigrated.  
Those beings who have arrived at knowledge  
do not proceed to a future life.”

---

“‘Could there be another way?’ … And how could there be?

‘All the suffering that originates is caused by choices’: this is one contemplation. ‘With the utter cessation of choices there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”

Then the Teacher went on to say:

---

737 “All the suffering that originates  
is caused by choices.  
With the cessation of choices,  
there is no origination of suffering.

738 Knowing this danger,  
that suffering is caused by choices;  
through the stilling of all choices,  
and the stopping of perceptions,  
this is the way suffering ends.  
For those who truly know this,

739 rightly seeing, knowledge masters,  
the astute, understanding rightly,  
having overcome Māra’s bonds,  
do not proceed to a future life.”

---

“‘Could there be another way?’ … And how could there be?

‘All the suffering that originates is caused by consciousness’: this is one contemplation. ‘With the utter cessation of consciousness there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”

Then the Teacher went on to say:

---

740 “All the suffering that originates  
is caused by consciousness.  
With the cessation of consciousness,  
there is no origination of suffering.

741 Knowing this danger,  
that suffering is caused by consciousness,  
with the stilling of consciousness a mendicant  
is hungerless, extinguished.”

---

“‘Could there be another way?’ … And how could there be?

‘All the suffering that originates is caused by contact’: this is one contemplation. ‘With the utter cessation of contact there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”

Then the Teacher went on to say:

---

742 “Those mired in contact,  
swept down the stream of rebirths,  
practicing the wrong way,  
are far from the ending of fetters.

743 But those who completely understand contact,  
who, understanding, delight in peace;  
by comprehending contact  
they are hungerless, extinguished.”

---

“‘Could there be another way?’ … And how could there be?

‘All the suffering that originates is caused by feeling’: this is one contemplation. ‘With the utter cessation of feeling there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”

Then the Teacher went on to say:

---

744 “Having known everything that is felt—  
whether pleasure or pain,  
as well as what’s neutral,  
both internally and externally—

745as suffering,  
deceptive, falling apart;  
they see it vanish with every touch:  
that’s how they understand it.  
With the ending of feelings, a mendicant  
is hungerless, extinguished.”

---

“‘Could there be another way?’ … And how could there be?

‘All the suffering that originates is caused by craving’: this is one contemplation. ‘With the utter cessation of craving there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”

Then the Teacher went on to say:

---

746 “Craving is a person’s partner  
as they transmigrate on this long journey.  
They go from this state to another,  
but don’t escape transmigration.

747 Knowing this danger,  
that craving is the cause of suffering—  
rid of craving, free of grasping,  
a mendicant would wander mindful.”

---

“‘Could there be another way?’ … And how could there be?

‘All the suffering that originates is caused by grasping’: this is one contemplation. ‘With the utter cessation of grasping there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”

Then the Teacher went on to say:

---

748 “Grasping is the cause of continued existence;  
one who exists falls into suffering.  
Death comes to those who are born—  
this is the origination of suffering.

749 That’s why with the end of grasping,  
the astute, understanding rightly,  
having directly known the end of rebirth,  
do not proceed to a future life.”

---

“‘Could there be another way?’ … And how could there be?

‘All the suffering that originates is caused by instigating karma’: this is one contemplation. ‘With the utter cessation of instigation there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”

Then the Teacher went on to say:

---

750 “All the suffering that originates  
is caused by instigating karma.  
With the cessation of instigation,  
there is no origination of suffering.

751 Knowing this danger,  
that suffering is caused by instigating karma,  
having given up all instigation,  
one is freed with respects to instigation.

752 For the mendicant with peaceful mind,  
who has cut off craving for continued existence,  
transmigration through births is finished;  
there are no future lives for them.”

---

“‘Could there be another way?’ … And how could there be?

‘All the suffering that originates is caused by sustenance’: this is one contemplation. ‘With the utter cessation of sustenance there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”

Then the Teacher went on to say:

---

453 “All the suffering that originates  
is caused by sustenance.  
With the cessation of sustenance,  
there is no origination of suffering.

754 Knowing this danger,  
that suffering is caused by sustenance,  
completely understanding all sustenance,  
one is independent of all sustenance.

755Having rightly understood the state of health,  
through the ending of defilements,  
using after reflection, firm in principle,  
a knowledge master cannot be reckoned.”

---

“‘Could there be another way?’ … And how could there be?

‘All the suffering that originates is caused by perturbation’: this is one contemplation. ‘With the utter cessation of perturbation there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”

Then the Teacher went on to say:

---

756 “All the suffering that originates  
is caused by perturbation.  
With the cessation of perturbation,  
there is no origination of suffering.

757 Knowing this danger,  
that suffering is caused by perturbation,  
that’s why, having relinquished perturbation,  
and stopped making karmic choices,  
imperturbable, free of grasping,  
a mendicant would wander mindful.”

---

“‘Could there be another way?’ … And how could there be?

‘For the dependent there is agitation’: this is the first contemplation. ‘For the independent there’s no agitation’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”

Then the Teacher went on to say:

---

758 “For the independent there’s no agitation.  
The dependent, grasping,  
goes from this state to another,  
without escaping transmigration.

759 Knowing this danger,  
the great fear in dependencies,  
independent, free of grasping,  
a mendicant would wander mindful.”

---

“‘Could there be another way?’ … And how could there be?

‘Formless states are more peaceful than states of form’: this is the first contemplation. ‘Cessation is more peaceful than formless states’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”

Then the Teacher went on to say:

---

760 “There are beings in the realm of luminous form,  
and others stuck in the formless.  
Not understanding cessation,  
they return in future lives.

761 But the people who completely understand form,  
not stuck in the formless,  
released in cessation—  
they are conquerors of death.”

---

“‘Could there be another way?’ … And how could there be?

‘What this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—focuses on as true, the noble ones have clearly seen with right wisdom to be actually false’: this is the first contemplation. ‘What this world focuses on as false, the noble ones have clearly seen with right wisdom to be actually true’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”

Then the Teacher went on to say:

---

762 “See how the world with its gods  
imagines not-self to be self;  
habituated to name and form,  
imagining this is truth.

763 For whatever you imagine it is,  
it turns out to be something else.  
And that is what is false in it,  
for the ephemeral is deceptive by nature.

764 Extinguishment has an undeceptive nature,  
the noble ones know it as truth.  
Having comprehended the truth,  
they are hungerless, extinguished.”

---

“Suppose, mendicants, they questioned you thus: ‘Could there be another way to contemplate the pairs?’ You should say, ‘There could.’ And how could there be?

‘What this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—focuses on as happiness, the noble ones have clearly seen with right wisdom to be actually suffering’: this is the first contemplation. ‘What this world focuses on as suffering, the noble ones have clearly seen with right wisdom to be actually happiness’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates rightly contemplating a pair of teachings in this way—diligent, keen, and resolute—they can expect one of two results: enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:

---

765 “Sights, sounds, tastes, smells,  
touches, and thoughts, the lot of them—  
they’re likable, desirable, and pleasurable  
as long as you can say that they exist.

766 For all the world with its gods,  
this is what they agree is happiness.  
And where they cease  
is agreed on as suffering for them.

767 The noble ones have seen as happiness  
the ceasing of identity.  
This insight by those who see  
contradicts the whole world.

768 What others say is happiness  
the noble ones say is suffering.  
What others say is suffering  
the noble ones know as happiness.

769 See, this teaching is hard to understand,  
it confuses the ignorant.  
There is darkness for the shrouded;  
blackness for those who don’t see.

770 But the good are open;  
like light for those who see.  
Though close, they do not understand,  
those fools inexpert in the teaching.

771 They’re mired in desire to be reborn,  
flowing along the stream of lives,  
mired in Māra’s sway:  
this teaching isn’t easy for them to understand.

772 Who, apart from the noble ones,  
is qualified to understand this state?  
Having rightly understood this state,  
the undefiled become fully extinguished.”

---

That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of sixty mendicants were freed from defilements by not grasping.
