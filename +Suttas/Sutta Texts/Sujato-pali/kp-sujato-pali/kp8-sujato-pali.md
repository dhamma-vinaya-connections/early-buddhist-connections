## The Discourse on the Amount of Savings

  

1A man stores his savings  
in a deep pit close to water thinking:  
"When a duty or need has arisen  
it will be there to help me,

2to free me from a king if slandered, or from molestation  
from a thief, or from a debt, or famine, or accident."  
For this kind of help, savings are stored up in the world.

3Although it is well stored  
in a deep pit, close to water,  
still, it cannot help him in all things on every occasion,

4for perhaps those savings are removed from that place,  
or he forgets the signs telling where they lie,  
or nāgas take them away,  
or yakkhas carry them off,

5or the heirs he dislikes  
extract them unseen,  
and when his merit comes to an end  
all of it will be destroyed.

6But that woman or man who through giving, virtue,  
restraint, and self-control has well stored up his savings,  
placing them in a shrine, or in the Saṅgha,  
or in an individual, or a guest,

7or in his mother or father,  
also in an elder brother,  
those savings are well stored up,  
they follow one, they do not decay.

8Riches he gives up when he has to leave this life  
but this goes along with him.  
It is not shared with others,  
no thief carries those savings away,

9the wise man should make merit,  
for those savings follow one along.  
These savings satisfy every desire of gods and men,  
whatever they wish for,  
through this merit they receive all.

10A good appearance, a good voice,  
a good shape, a good form,  
sovereignty, and a retinue,  
through this merit they receive all.

11A local kingship, an empire,  
and whatever happiness a Wheel-Rolling King has,  
also godly kingship in the heavens,  
through this merit they receive all.

12Human good fortune,  
delight in the world of the gods,  
even the attainment of Emancipation,  
through this merit they receive all.

13With the attainment of good friends,  
devotion to systematic thought,  
there is the power of understanding and freedom,  
through this merit they receive all.

14The discriminations, and the liberations,  
and whatever perfections the disciples have,  
Independent Awakening, the Buddhas’ ground,  
through this merit they receive all.

15So this is of great benefit,  
that is to say, the attainment of merit,  
therefore the wise and intelligent always praise the making of merit.
