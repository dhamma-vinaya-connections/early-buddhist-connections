## 22. Khandhasaṁyutta: On the Aggregates

### III. The Burden — SN22.31: The Root of Misery
#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato.  

1At Sāvatthī.

“Mendicants, I will teach you misery and the root of misery. Listen …

And what is misery? Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are misery. This is called misery.

And what is the root of misery? It’s the craving that leads to future lives, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking pleasure in various different realms. That is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving to continue existence, and craving to end existence. This is called the root of misery.”
