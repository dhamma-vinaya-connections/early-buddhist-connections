#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato.  

1“Just now, reverend, as I was descending from Vulture’s Peak Mountain I saw a man whose body hairs were needles flying through the air. The needles bored into his head and out his mouth, into his mouth and out his chest, into his chest and out his belly, into his belly and out his thighs, into his thighs and out his calves, and into his calves and out his feet. And he screamed in pain. …” …

“That being used to be an informant right here in Rājagaha. …”

1"Idhāhaṁ, āvuso, gijjhakūṭā pabbatā orohanto addasaṁ sūcilomaṁ purisaṁ vehāsaṁ gacchantaṁ. Tassa tā sūciyo sīse pavisitvā mukhato nikkhamanti; mukhe pavisitvā urato nikkhamanti; ure pavisitvā udarato nikkhamanti; udare pavisitvā ūrūhi nikkhamanti; ūrūsu pavisitvā jaṅghāhi nikkhamanti; jaṅghāsu pavisitvā pādehi nikkhamanti; so sudaṁ aṭṭassaraṁ karoti … pe …

eso, bhikkhave, satto imasmiṁyeva rājagahe sūcako ahosi … pe … .

Navamaṁ.
