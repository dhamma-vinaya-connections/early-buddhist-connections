## MN1: The Root of All Things - Mūlapariyāya Sutta

## Sujato 

1So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā, in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal tree. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”


“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:

“Mendicants, I will teach you the explanation of the root of all things. Listen and apply your minds well, I will speak.”

“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:


2“Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons. They perceive earth as earth. Having perceived earth as earth, they conceive it to be earth, they conceive it in earth, they conceive it as earth, they conceive that ‘earth is mine’, they take pleasure in earth. Why is that?
