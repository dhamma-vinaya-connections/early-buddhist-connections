### 179–188. The Noble Dhamma, Etc.
#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato. 

(179) "Bhikkhus, I will teach you the noble Dhamma and the ignoble Dhamma … (180) … the wholesome and the unwholesome … … (181) … what is beneficial and what is harmful … (182) … the Dhamma and what is non-Dhamma … (183) … the tainted Dhamma and the taintless one … … (184) … the blameworthy Dhamma and the blameless one … (185) … the tormenting Dhamma and the untormenting one … (186) … the Dhamma that leads to building up and the one that leads to dismantling … … (187) … the Dhamma with suffering as its outcome and the one with happiness as its outcome … (188) … the Dhamma that results in suffering and the one that results in happiness … .

"And what, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma that results in suffering? The destruction of life … and wrong view. This is called the Dhamma that results in suffering.

"And what, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma that results in happiness? Abstention from the destruction of life … and right view. This is called the Dhamma that results in happiness."
