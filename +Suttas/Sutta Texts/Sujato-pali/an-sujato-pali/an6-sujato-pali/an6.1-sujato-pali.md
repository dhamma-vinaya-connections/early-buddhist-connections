## Aṅguttara Nikāya - The Numerical Discourses

## 6: The Book of the Sixes

### I. Worthy of Offerings — AN 6.1: Worthy of Offerings (1st)
#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato. 

1So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants!”

“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:


2“Mendicants, a mendicant with six factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. What six?

It’s a mendicant who, when they see a sight with their eyes, is neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware.


When they hear a sound with their ears …

When they smell an odor with their nose …

When they taste a flavor with their tongue …

When they feel a touch with their body …

When they know a thought with their mind, they’re neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware.

A mendicant with these six factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”

3That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.

#### Pali

1Evaṁ me sutaṁ — ​   ekaṁ samayaṁ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṁ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi:  "bhikkhavo"ti.

"Bhadante"ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṁ. Bhagavā etadavoca: 


2"Chahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu āhuneyyo hoti pāhuneyyo dakkhiṇeyyo añjalikaraṇīyo anuttaraṁ puññakkhettaṁ lokassa. Katamehi chahi?

Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu cakkhunā rūpaṁ disvā neva sumano hoti na dummano, upekkhako viharati sato sampajāno.


Sotena saddaṁ sutvā …

ghānena gandhaṁ ghāyitvā …

jivhāya rasaṁ sāyitvā …

kāyena phoṭṭhabbaṁ phusitvā …

manasā dhammaṁ viññāya neva sumano hoti na dummano, upekkhako viharati sato sampajāno.

Imehi kho, bhikkhave, chahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu āhuneyyo hoti pāhuneyyo dakkhiṇeyyo añjalikaraṇīyo anuttaraṁ puññakkhettaṁ lokassā"ti.

3Idamavoca bhagavā. Attamanā te bhikkhū bhagavato bhāsitaṁ abhinandunti.

Paṭhamaṁ.
