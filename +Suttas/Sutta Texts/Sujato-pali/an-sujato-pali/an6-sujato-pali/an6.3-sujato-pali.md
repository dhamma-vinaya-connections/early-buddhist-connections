## Aṅguttara Nikāya - The Numerical Discourses

## 6: The Book of the Sixes

### I. Worthy of Offerings — AN 6.3: Faculties
#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato. 

1“Mendicants, a mendicant with six factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. What six? The faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. And they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. A mendicant with these six factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”

1"Chahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu āhuneyyo hoti … pe … anuttaraṁ puññakkhettaṁ lokassa. Katamehi chahi? Saddhindriyena, vīriyindriyena, satindriyena, samādhindriyena, paññindriyena, āsavānaṁ khayā anāsavaṁ cetovimuttiṁ paññāvimuttiṁ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṁ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharati. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, chahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu āhuneyyo hoti pāhuneyyo dakkhiṇeyyo añjalikaraṇīyo anuttaraṁ puññakkhettaṁ lokassā"ti.

Tatiyaṁ.
