## Aṅguttara Nikāya - The Numerical Discourses

## 3: The Book of the Threes

### 184–352
#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato. 

1"Bhikkhus, for full understanding of lust … for the utter destruction … for the abandoning … for the destruction … for the vanishing … for the fading away … for the cessation … for the giving up … For the relinquishment of lust, these three things are to be developed.

"Bhikkhus, for direct knowledge … for full understanding … for the utter destruction … for the abandoning … for the destruction … for the vanishing … for the fading away … for the cessation … for the giving up … for the relinquishment of hatred … delusion … anger … hostility … denigration … insolence … envy … miserliness … deceitfulness … craftiness … obstinacy … vehemence … conceit … arrogance … intoxication … heedlessness, three things are to be developed. What three? Emptiness concentration, markless concentration, and wishless concentration. For the relinquishment of heedlessness, these three things are to be developed."

This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One's statement.

The Book of the Threes is finished.
