### XII. Bound for Loss — AN 3.115: Immeasurable
#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato. 

1“Mendicants, these three people are found in the world. What three? Someone easy to measure, someone hard to measure, and someone who is immeasurable.

And who is the person easy to measure?

It’s a person who is restless, insolent, fickle, gossipy, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties. This is called ‘a person easy to measure’.


2And who is the person hard to measure?

It’s a person who is not restless, insolent, fickle, gossipy, or loose-tongued. They have established mindfulness, situational awareness and immersion, with unified mind and restrained faculties. This is called ‘a person hard to measure’.


3And who is the immeasurable person?

It’s a mendicant who is perfected, and has ended defilements. This is called ‘an immeasurable person’.

These are the three people found in the world.”

1"Tayome, bhikkhave, puggalā santo saṁvijjamānā lokasmiṁ. Katame tayo? Suppameyyo, duppameyyo, appameyyo.

Katamo ca, bhikkhave, puggalo suppameyyo?

Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo uddhato hoti unnaḷo capalo mukharo vikiṇṇavāco muṭṭhassati asampajāno asamāhito vibbhantacitto pākatindriyo. Ayaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, puggalo suppameyyo.


2Katamo ca, bhikkhave, puggalo duppameyyo?

Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo anuddhato hoti anunnaḷo acapalo amukharo avikiṇṇavāco upaṭṭhitassati sampajāno samāhito ekaggacitto saṁvutindriyo. Ayaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, puggalo duppameyyo.


3Katamo ca, bhikkhave, puggalo appameyyo?

Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu arahaṁ hoti khīṇāsavo. Ayaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, puggalo appameyyo.

Ime kho, bhikkhave, tayo puggalā santo saṁvijjamānā lokasmin"ti.

Tatiyaṁ.
