## Aṅguttara Nikāya - The Numerical Discourses

## 3: The Book of the Threes

### IX. Ascetics — AN 3.90: Three Trainings (2nd)
#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato. 

1“Mendicants, these are the three trainings. What three? The training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.

2And what is the training in the higher ethics? It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the code of conduct, with good behavior and supporters. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. This is called the training in the higher ethics.

3And what is the training in the higher mind? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. This is called the training in the higher mind.

4And what is the training in the higher wisdom? It’s when a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is called the training in the higher wisdom. These are the three trainings.


5The higher ethics, the higher mind,  
and the higher wisdom should be practiced  
by those energetic, strong, and resolute,  
practicing absorption, mindful, with guarded senses.

6As before, so after;  
as after, so before.  
As below, so above;  
as above, so below.

7As by day, so by night;  
as by night, so by day.  
Having mastered every direction  
with limitless immersion,

8they call them a ‘trainee on the path’,  
and ‘one living a pure life’.  
But a wise one who has gone to the end of the path  
they call a ‘Buddha’ in the world.

9With the cessation of consciousness,  
freed by the ending of craving,  
the liberation of their heart  
is like a lamp going out.”

1"Tisso imā, bhikkhave, sikkhā. Katamā tisso? Adhisīlasikkhā, adhicittasikkhā, adhipaññāsikkhā.

2Katamā ca, bhikkhave, adhisīlasikkhā? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sīlavā hoti … pe … samādāya sikkhati sikkhāpadesu. Ayaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, adhisīlasikkhā.

3Katamā ca, bhikkhave, adhicittasikkhā? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vivicceva kāmehi … pe … catutthaṁ jhānaṁ upasampajja viharati. Ayaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, adhicittasikkhā.

4Katamā ca, bhikkhave, adhipaññāsikkhā? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu āsavānaṁ khayā anāsavaṁ cetovimuttiṁ paññāvimuttiṁ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṁ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharati. Ayaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, adhipaññāsikkhā. Imā kho, bhikkhave, tisso sikkhāti.


5Adhisīlaṁ adhicittaṁ,  
adhipaññañca vīriyavā;  
Thāmavā dhitimā jhāyī,  
sato guttindriyo care.

6Yathā pure tathā pacchā,  
yathā pacchā tathā pure;  
Yathā adho tathā uddhaṁ,  
yathā uddhaṁ tathā adho.

7Yathā divā tathā rattiṁ,  
yathā rattiṁ tathā divā;  
Abhibhuyya disā sabbā,  
appamāṇasamādhinā.

8Tamāhu sekhaṁ paṭipadaṁ,  
atho saṁsuddhacāriyaṁ;  
Tamāhu loke sambuddhaṁ,  
dhīraṁ paṭipadantaguṁ.

9Viññāṇassa nirodhena,  
taṇhākkhayavimuttino;  
Pajjotasseva nibbānaṁ,  
vimokkho hoti cetaso"ti.

Dasamaṁ.
