### X. With Kakudha — AN 5.96: Remembering What You’ve Learned
#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato. 

1“Mendicants, a mendicant cultivating mindfulness of breathing who has five things will soon penetrate the unshakable. What five?

It’s when a mendicant has few requirements and duties, and is easily looked after and contented with life’s necessities.

They eat little, not devoted to filling their stomach.

They are rarely drowsy, and are dedicated to wakefulness.

They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.


They review the extent of their mind’s freedom.

A mendicant cultivating mindfulness of breathing who has these five things will soon penetrate the unshakable.”

1"Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu ānāpānassatiṁ āsevanto nacirasseva akuppaṁ paṭivijjhati. Katamehi pañcahi?

Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu appaṭṭho hoti appakicco subharo susantoso jīvitaparikkhāresu;

appāhāro hoti anodarikattaṁ anuyutto;

appamiddho hoti jāgariyaṁ anuyutto;

bahussuto hoti sutadharo sutasannicayo, ye te dhammā ādikalyāṇā majjhekalyāṇā pariyosānakalyāṇā sātthaṁ sabyañjanaṁ kevalaparipuṇṇaṁ parisuddhaṁ brahmacariyaṁ abhivadanti, tathārūpāssa dhammā bahussutā honti dhātā vacasā paricitā manasānupekkhitā diṭṭhiyā suppaṭividdhā;


yathāvimuttaṁ cittaṁ paccavekkhati.

Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu ānāpānassatiṁ āsevanto nacirasseva akuppaṁ paṭivijjhatī"ti.

Chaṭṭhaṁ.
