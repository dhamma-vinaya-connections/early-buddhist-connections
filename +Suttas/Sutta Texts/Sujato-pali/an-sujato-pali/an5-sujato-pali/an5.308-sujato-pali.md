## Aṅguttara Nikāya – The Numerical Discourses

## 1: The Book of the Ones

### XXIX. Abbreviated Texts Beginning With Greed — AN 5.308-1152:
#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato. 

“For the complete understanding … finishing … giving up … ending … vanishing … fading away … cessation … giving away … letting go of greed, five things should be developed.”

“Of hate … delusion … anger … hostility … offensiveness … contempt … jealousy … stinginess … deceit … deviousness … obstinacy … aggression … conceit … arrogance … vanity … negligence … for insight … complete understanding … finishing … giving up … ending … vanishing … fading away … cessation … giving away … letting go … five things should be developed.

What five? The powers of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. For the letting go of negligence, these five things should be developed.”

The Book of the Fives is finished.
