## Aṅguttara Nikāya – The Numerical Discourses

## 1: The Book of the Ones

### XIX. Wilderness Dwellers — AN 5.184: Charnel Ground Dwellers
#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato. 

1“Mendicants, there are these five kinds of people who dwell in a charnel ground. What five? A person may dwell in a charnel ground because of stupidity … bad desires … madness … because it is praised by the Buddhas … or for the sake of having few wishes … These are the five kinds of people who dwell in a charnel ground.”
