## Aṅguttara Nikāya - The Numerical Discourses

## 5: The Book of the Fives

### V. With King Muṇḍa — AN 5.47: Wealth
#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato. 

1“Mendicants, there are these five kinds of wealth. What five? The wealth of faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.


2And what is the wealth of faith? It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ This is called the wealth of faith.

3And what is the wealth of ethics? It’s when a noble disciple doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. This is called the wealth of ethics.

4And what is the wealth of learning? It’s when a noble disciple is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s totally full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reciting them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. This is called the wealth of learning.


5And what is the wealth of generosity? It’s when a noble disciple lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share. This is called the wealth of generosity.

6And what is the wealth of wisdom? It’s when a noble disciple is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. This is called the wealth of wisdom.

These are the five kinds of wealth.


7Whoever has faith in the Realized One,  
unwavering and well grounded;  
whose ethical conduct is good,  
praised and loved by the noble ones;

8who has confidence in the Saṅgha,  
and correct view:  
they’re said to be prosperous,  
their life is not in vain.

9So let the wise devote themselves  
to faith, ethical behavior,  
confidence, and insight into the teaching,  
remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.”

1"Pañcimāni, bhikkhave, dhanāni. Katamāni pañca? Saddhādhanaṁ, sīladhanaṁ, sutadhanaṁ, cāgadhanaṁ, paññādhanaṁ.


2Katamañca, bhikkhave, saddhādhanaṁ? Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako saddho hoti, saddahati tathāgatassa bodhiṁ:  ‘itipi so bhagavā … pe … satthā devamanussānaṁ buddho bhagavā’ti. Idaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, saddhādhanaṁ.

3Katamañca, bhikkhave, sīladhanaṁ? Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako pāṇātipātā paṭivirato hoti … pe … surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā paṭivirato hoti. Idaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, sīladhanaṁ.

4Katamañca, bhikkhave, sutadhanaṁ? Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako bahussuto hoti … pe … diṭṭhiyā suppaṭividdho. Idaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, sutadhanaṁ.


5Katamañca, bhikkhave, cāgadhanaṁ? Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako vigatamalamaccherena cetasā agāraṁ ajjhāvasati muttacāgo payatapāṇi vosaggarato yācayogo dānasaṁvibhāgarato. Idaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, cāgadhanaṁ.

6Katamañca, bhikkhave, paññādhanaṁ? Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako paññavā hoti, udayatthagāminiyā paññāya samannāgato ariyāya nibbedhikāya sammā dukkhakkhayagāminiyā. Idaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, paññādhanaṁ.

Imāni kho, bhikkhave, pañca dhanānīti.


7Yassa saddhā tathāgate,  
acalā suppatiṭṭhitā;  
Sīlañca yassa kalyāṇaṁ,  
ariyakantaṁ pasaṁsitaṁ.

8Saṅghe pasādo yassatthi,  
ujubhūtañca dassanaṁ;  
Adaliddoti taṁ āhu,  
amoghaṁ tassa jīvitaṁ.

9Tasmā saddhañca sīlañca,  
pasādaṁ dhammadassanaṁ;  
Anuyuñjetha medhāvī,  
saraṁ buddhāna sāsanan"ti.

Sattamaṁ.
