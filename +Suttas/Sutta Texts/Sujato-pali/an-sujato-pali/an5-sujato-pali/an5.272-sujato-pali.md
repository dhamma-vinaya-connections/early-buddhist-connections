### XXVII. Abbreviated Texts on Appointments — AN 5.272: A Meal Assigner
#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato. 

1“Mendicants, a person with five qualities should not be appointed as meal assigner. What five? They make decisions prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, and cowardice. And they don’t know if a meal has been assigned or not. A person with these five qualities should not be appointed as meal assigner.

2A person with five qualities should be appointed as meal assigner. What five? They don’t make decisions prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, and cowardice. And they know if a meal has been assigned or not. A person with these five qualities should be appointed as meal assigner.

3A person with five qualities who has been appointed as meal assigner should not be called upon … should be called upon … should be known as a fool … should be known as astute … they keep themselves broken and damaged … they keep themselves unbroken and undamaged … is cast down to hell … is raised up to heaven. What five? They don’t make decisions prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, and cowardice. And they know if a meal has been assigned or not. A meal assigner with these five qualities is raised up to heaven.”

3Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhattuddesako sammato na pesetabbo … pe … sammato pesetabbo … bālo veditabbo … paṇḍito veditabbo … khataṁ upahataṁ attānaṁ pariharati … akkhataṁ anupahataṁ attānaṁ pariharati … yathābhataṁ nikkhitto evaṁ niraye … yathābhataṁ nikkhitto evaṁ sagge. Katamehi pañcahi? Na chandāgatiṁ gacchati, na dosāgatiṁ gacchati, na mohāgatiṁ gacchati, na bhayāgatiṁ gacchati, uddiṭṭhānuddiṭṭhaṁ jānāti.
