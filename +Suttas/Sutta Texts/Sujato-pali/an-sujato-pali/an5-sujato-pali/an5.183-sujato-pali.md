### XIX. Wilderness Dwellers — AN 5.183: Dwelling at the Root of a Tree
#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato. 

1“Mendicants, there are these five kinds of people who dwell at the root of a tree. What five? A person may dwell at the root of a tree because of stupidity … bad desires … madness … because it is praised by the Buddhas … or for the sake of having few wishes … These are the five kinds of people who dwell at the root of a tree.”
