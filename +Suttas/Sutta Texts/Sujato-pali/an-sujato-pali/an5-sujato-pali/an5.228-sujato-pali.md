### XXIII. Long Wandering — AN 5.228: Eating Late
#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato. 

1“Mendicants, there are these five drawbacks for a family who takes their meals late in the day. What five? When guests visit, they are not served on time. The deities who accept spirit-offerings are not served on time. Ascetics and brahmins who eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night, and from food at the wrong time are not served on time. Bondservants, workers, and staff do their duties neglectfully. A meal eaten during the wrong period is not nutritious. These are the five drawbacks for a family who takes their meals late in the day.

2There are these five benefits for a family who takes their meals at a proper time. What five? When guests visit, they are served on time. The deities who accept spirit-offerings are served on time. Ascetics and brahmins who eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night, and from food at the wrong time are served on time. Bondservants, workers, and staff do their duties attentively. A meal eaten during the proper period is nutritious. These are the five benefits for a family who takes their meals at a proper time.”

1"Pañcime, bhikkhave, ādīnavā ussūrabhatte kule. Katame pañca? Ye te atithī pāhunā, te na kālena paṭipūjenti; yā tā balipaṭiggāhikā devatā, tā na kālena paṭipūjenti; ye te samaṇabrāhmaṇā ekabhattikā rattūparatā viratā vikālabhojanā, te na kālena paṭipūjenti; dāsakammakaraporisā vimukhā kammaṁ karonti; tāvatakaṁyeva asamayena bhuttaṁ anojavantaṁ hoti. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca ādīnavā ussūrabhatte kule.

2Pañcime, bhikkhave, ānisaṁsā samayabhatte kule. Katame pañca? Ye te atithī pāhunā, te kālena paṭipūjenti; yā tā balipaṭiggāhikā devatā, tā kālena paṭipūjenti; ye te samaṇabrāhmaṇā ekabhattikā rattūparatā viratā vikālabhojanā, te kālena paṭipūjenti; dāsakammakaraporisā avimukhā kammaṁ karonti; tāvatakaṁyeva samayena bhuttaṁ ojavantaṁ hoti. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca ānisaṁsā samayabhatte kule"ti.

Aṭṭhamaṁ.
