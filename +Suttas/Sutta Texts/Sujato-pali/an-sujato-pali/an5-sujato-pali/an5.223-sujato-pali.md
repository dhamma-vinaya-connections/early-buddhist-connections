### XXIII. Long Wandering — AN 5.223: Overstaying
#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato. 

1“Mendicants, there are these five drawbacks of overstaying. What five? You have a lot of stuff and store it up. You have a lot of medicine and store it up. You have a lot of duties and responsibilities, and become capable in whatever needs to be done. You mix closely with laypeople and renunciates, socializing inappropriately like a layperson. And when you leave that monastery, you miss it. These are the five drawbacks of overstaying.

2There are these five benefits of staying for a reasonable length of time. What five? You don’t have a lot of stuff and store it up. You don’t have a lot of medicine and store it up. You don’t have a lot of duties and responsibilities, or become capable in whatever needs to be done. You don’t mix closely with laypeople and renunciates, socializing inappropriately like a layperson. And when you leave that monastery, you don’t miss it. These are the five benefits of staying for a reasonable length of time.”

1"Pañcime, bhikkhave, ādīnavā atinivāse. Katame pañca? Bahubhaṇḍo hoti bahubhaṇḍasannicayo, bahubhesajjo hoti bahubhesajjasannicayo, bahukicco hoti bahukaraṇīyo byatto kiṅkaraṇīyesu, saṁsaṭṭho viharati gahaṭṭhapabbajitehi ananulomikena gihisaṁsaggena, tamhā ca āvāsā pakkamanto sāpekkho pakkamati. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca ādīnavā atinivāse.

2Pañcime, bhikkhave, ānisaṁsā samavatthavāse. Katame pañca? Na bahubhaṇḍo hoti na bahubhaṇḍasannicayo, na bahubhesajjo hoti na bahubhesajjasannicayo, na bahukicco hoti na bahukaraṇīyo na byatto kiṅkaraṇīyesu, asaṁsaṭṭho viharati gahaṭṭhapabbajitehi ananulomikena gihisaṁsaggena, tamhā ca āvāsā pakkamanto anapekkho pakkamati. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca ānisaṁsā samavatthavāse"ti.

Tatiyaṁ.
