### XVI. The True Teaching — AN 5.153: Inevitability Regarding the Right Path (3rd)
#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato. 

1“Mendicants, someone with five qualities is unable to enter the sure path with regards to skillful qualities even when listening to the true teaching. What five? They listen to the teaching bent only on putting it down. They listen to the teaching with a hostile, fault-finding mind. They’re antagonistic to the teacher, planning to attack them. They’re witless, dull, and stupid. And they think they know what they don’t know. Someone with these five qualities is unable to enter the sure path with regards to skillful qualities even when listening to the true teaching.

2Someone with five qualities is able to enter the sure path with regards to skillful qualities when listening to the true teaching. What five? They don’t listen to the teaching bent only on putting it down. They don’t listen to the teaching with a hostile, fault-finding mind. They’re not antagonistic to the teacher, and not planning to attack them. They’re wise, bright, and clever. And they don’t think they know what they don’t know. Someone with these five qualities is able to enter the sure path with regards to skillful qualities when listening to the true teaching.”

1"Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato suṇantopi saddhammaṁ abhabbo niyāmaṁ okkamituṁ kusalesu dhammesu sammattaṁ. Katamehi pañcahi? Makkhī dhammaṁ suṇāti makkhapariyuṭṭhito, upārambhacitto dhammaṁ suṇāti randhagavesī, dhammadesake āhatacitto hoti khīlajāto, duppañño hoti jaḷo eḷamūgo, anaññāte aññātamānī hoti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato suṇantopi saddhammaṁ abhabbo niyāmaṁ okkamituṁ kusalesu dhammesu sammattaṁ.

2Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato suṇanto saddhammaṁ bhabbo niyāmaṁ okkamituṁ kusalesu dhammesu sammattaṁ. Katamehi pañcahi? Amakkhī dhammaṁ suṇāti na makkhapariyuṭṭhito, anupārambhacitto dhammaṁ suṇāti na randhagavesī, dhammadesake anāhatacitto hoti akhīlajāto, paññavā hoti ajaḷo aneḷamūgo, na anaññāte aññātamānī hoti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato suṇanto saddhammaṁ bhabbo niyāmaṁ okkamituṁ kusalesu dhammesu sammattan"ti.

Tatiyaṁ.
