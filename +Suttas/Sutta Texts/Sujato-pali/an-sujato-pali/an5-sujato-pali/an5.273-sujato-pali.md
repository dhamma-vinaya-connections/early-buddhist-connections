## Aṅguttara Nikāya – The Numerical Discourses

## 1: The Book of the Ones

### XXVII. Abbreviated Texts on Appointments — AN 5.273-285: A Lodgings Assigner
#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato. 

“Mendicants, a person with five qualities should not be appointed as lodgings assigner … they don’t know if a lodging has been assigned or not … A person with five qualities should be appointed as lodgings assigner … they know if a lodging has been assigned or not …

A person should not be appointed as lodgings allocator … they don’t know if a lodging has been allocated or not … A person should be appointed as lodgings allocator … they know if a lodging has been allocated or not …

A person should not be appointed as storeperson … they don’t know if stores are protected or not … A person should be appointed as storeperson … they know if stores are protected or not …

… robe receiver …

… robe distributor …

… porridge distributor …

… fruit distributor …

… cake distributor …

… dispenser of minor accessories …

… allocator of bathing cloths …

… bowl allocator …

… supervisor of monastery staff …

… supervisor of novices …

What five? They don’t make decisions prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, and cowardice. And they know if a novice has been supervised or not. A supervisor of novices with these five qualities is raised up to heaven.”
