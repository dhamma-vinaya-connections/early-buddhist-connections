1“When one thing is developed and cultivated there is the penetration of many elements … the penetration of diverse elements … the analysis of many elements. What one thing? Mindfulness of the body. When this one thing is developed and cultivated there is the penetration of many elements … the penetration of diverse elements … the analysis of many elements.”
