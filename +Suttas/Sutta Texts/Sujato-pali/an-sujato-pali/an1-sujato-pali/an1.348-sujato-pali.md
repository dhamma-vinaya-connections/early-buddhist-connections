348-350“Just as, mendicants, in India the delightful parks, woods, meadows, and lotus ponds are few, while the hilly terrain, inaccessible riverlands, stumps and thorns, and rugged mountains are many; so too, those who die as humans and are reborn as humans are few, while those who die as humans and are reborn in hell, or the animal realm, or the ghost realm are many.”

351–353" … so too those beings are few who, when they pass away as human beings, are reborn among the devas. More numerous are those who, when they pass away as human beings, are reborn in hell … in the animal realm … in the sphere of afflicted spirits."

354–356" … so too those beings are few who, when they pass away as devas, are reborn among the devas. More numerous are those who, when they pass away as devas, are reborn in hell … in the animal realm … in the sphere of afflicted spirits."

357–359" … so too those beings are few who, when they pass away as devas, are reborn among human beings. More numerous are those who, when they pass away as devas, are reborn in hell … in the animal realm … in the sphere of afflicted spirits."

360–362" … so too those beings are few who, when they pass away from hell, are reborn among human beings. More numerous are those who, when they pass away from hell, are reborn in hell … in the animal realm … in the sphere of afflicted spirits."

363–365" … so too those beings are few who, when they pass away from hell, are reborn among the devas. More numerous are those who, when they pass away from hell, are reborn in hell … in the animal realm … in the sphere of afflicted spirits."

366–368" … so too those beings are few who, when they pass away from the animal realm, are reborn among human beings. More numerous are those who, when they pass away from the animal realm, are reborn in hell … in the animal realm … in the sphere of afflicted spirits."

369–371" … so too those beings are few who, when they pass away from the animal realm, are reborn among the devas. More numerous are those who, when they pass away from the animal realm, are reborn in hell … in the animal realm … in the sphere of afflicted spirits."

372–374" … so too those beings are few who, when they pass away from the sphere of afflicted spirits, are reborn among human beings. More numerous are those who, when they pass away from the sphere of afflicted spirits, are reborn in hell … in the animal realm … in the sphere of afflicted spirits."

375–377" … so too those beings are few who, when they pass away from the sphere of afflicted spirits, are reborn among the devas. More numerous are those who, when they pass away from the sphere of afflicted spirits, are reborn in hell … in the animal realm … in the sphere of afflicted spirits."
