- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato. 

151“Mendicants, those mendicants who explain an offense as non-offense are acting for the hurt and unhappiness of the people, for the harm, hurt, and suffering of gods and humans. Those mendicants make much bad karma and make the true teaching disappear.”

152-159“Those mendicants who explain a light offense as a serious offense … a serious offense as a light offense … an offense committed with corrupt intention as an offense not committed with corrupt intention … an offense not committed with corrupt intention as an offense committed with corrupt intention … an offense requiring rehabilitation as an offense not requiring rehabilitation … an offense not requiring rehabilitation as an offense requiring rehabilitation … an offense with redress as an offense without redress … an offense without redress as an offense with redress are acting for the hurt and unhappiness of the people, for the harm, hurt, and suffering of gods and humans. Those mendicants make much bad karma and make the true teaching disappear.”
