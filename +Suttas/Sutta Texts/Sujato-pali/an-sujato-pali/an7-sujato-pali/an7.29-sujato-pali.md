### III. The Vajji Seven — AN 7.29: Non-decline for a Lay Follower
#### B. Sujato


- © Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato. 

1“These seven things lead to the decline of a lay follower. What seven? They stop seeing the mendicants. They neglect listening to the true teaching. They don’t train in higher ethical conduct. They’re very suspicious about mendicants, whether senior, junior, or middle. They listen to the teaching with a hostile, fault-finding mind. They seek outside of the Buddhist community for those worthy of religious donations. And they serve them first. These seven things lead to the decline of a lay follower.

2These seven things don’t lead to the decline of a lay follower. What seven? They don’t stop seeing the mendicants. They don’t neglect listening to the true teaching. They train in higher ethical conduct. They’re very confident about mendicants, whether senior, junior, or middle. They don’t listen to the teaching with a hostile, fault-finding mind. They don’t seek outside of the Buddhist community for those worthy of religious donations. And they serve the Buddhist community first. These seven things don’t lead to the decline of a lay follower.”

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:


3“A lay follower stops seeing  
those who have developed themselves  
and listening to the teaching of the noble ones.  
They don’t train in higher ethical conduct,

4and their suspicion about mendicants  
just grows and grows.  
They want to listen to the true teaching  
with a fault-finding mind.

5They seek outside the Buddhist community  
for someone else worthy of religious donations,  
and that lay follower  
serves them first.

6These seven principles leading to decline  
have been well taught.  
A lay follower who practices them  
falls away from the true teaching.

7A lay follower doesn’t stop seeing  
those who have developed themselves  
and listening to the teaching of the noble ones.  
They train in higher ethical conduct,

8and their confidence in mendicants  
just grows and grows.  
They want to listen to the true teaching  
without a fault-finding mind.

9They don’t seek outside the Buddhist community  
for someone else worthy of religious donations,  
and that lay follower  
serves the Buddhist community first.

10These seven principles that prevent decline  
have been well taught.  
A lay follower who practices them  
doesn’t fall away from the true teaching.”

1"Sattime, bhikkhave, dhammā upāsakassa parihānāya saṁvattanti. Katame satta? Bhikkhudassanaṁ hāpeti, saddhammassavanaṁ pamajjati, adhisīle na sikkhati, appasādabahulo hoti, bhikkhūsu theresu ceva navesu ca majjhimesu ca upārambhacitto dhammaṁ suṇāti randhagavesī, ito bahiddhā dakkhiṇeyyaṁ gavesati, tattha ca pubbakāraṁ karoti. Ime kho, bhikkhave, satta dhammā upāsakassa parihānāya saṁvattanti.

2Sattime, bhikkhave, dhammā upāsakassa aparihānāya saṁvattanti. Katame satta? Bhikkhudassanaṁ na hāpeti, saddhammassavanaṁ nappamajjati, adhisīle sikkhati, pasādabahulo hoti, bhikkhūsu theresu ceva navesu ca majjhimesu ca anupārambhacitto dhammaṁ suṇāti na randhagavesī, na ito bahiddhā dakkhiṇeyyaṁ gavesati, idha ca pubbakāraṁ karoti. Ime kho, bhikkhave, satta dhammā upāsakassa aparihānāya saṁvattantī"ti.

Idamavoca bhagavā. Idaṁ vatvāna sugato athāparaṁ etadavoca satthā: 


3"Dassanaṁ bhāvitattānaṁ,  
Yo hāpeti upāsako;  
Savanañca ariyadhammānaṁ,  
Adhisīle na sikkhati.

4Appasādo ca bhikkhūsu,  
bhiyyo bhiyyo pavaḍḍhati;  
Upārambhakacitto ca,  
saddhammaṁ sotumicchati.

5Ito ca bahiddhā aññaṁ,  
dakkhiṇeyyaṁ gavesati;  
Tattheva ca pubbakāraṁ,  
yo karoti upāsako.

6Ete kho parihāniye,  
satta dhamme sudesite;  
Upāsako sevamāno,  
saddhammā parihāyati.

7Dassanaṁ bhāvitattānaṁ,  
Yo na hāpeti upāsako;  
Savanañca ariyadhammānaṁ,  
Adhisīle ca sikkhati.

8Pasādo cassa bhikkhūsu,  
bhiyyo bhiyyo pavaḍḍhati;  
Anupārambhacitto ca,  
saddhammaṁ sotumicchati.

9Na ito bahiddhā aññaṁ,  
dakkhiṇeyyaṁ gavesati;  
Idheva ca pubbakāraṁ,  
yo karoti upāsako.

10Ete kho aparihāniye,  
Satta dhamme sudesite;  
Upāsako sevamāno,  
Saddhammā na parihāyatī"ti.

Navamaṁ.
