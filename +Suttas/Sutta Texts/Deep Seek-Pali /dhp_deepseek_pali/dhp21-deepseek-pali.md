# Dhp 21. Pakiṇṇakavaggo
## 

290.
Mattāsukhapariccāgā, passe ce vipulaṃ sukhaṃ;Caje mattāsukhaṃ dhīro, sampassaṃ vipulaṃ sukhaṃ.

If by renouncing a limited happiness one might see an abundant happiness, the wise one should renounce the limited happiness, having seen the abundant happiness.

291.
Paradukkhūpadhānena, attano [yo attano (syā. pī. ka.)] sukhamicchati;Verasaṃsaggasaṃsaṭṭho, verā so na parimuccati.

He who seeks his own happiness by inflicting suffering on others, being entangled in the bonds of hatred, is not freed from hatred.

292.
Yañhi kiccaṃ apaviddhaṃ [tadapaviddhaṃ (sī. syā.)], akiccaṃ pana kayirati;Unnaḷānaṃ pamattānaṃ, tesaṃ vaḍḍhanti āsavā.

What should be done is neglected, what should not be done is done; for the arrogant and heedless, their taints increase.

293.
Yesañca susamāraddhā, niccaṃ kāyagatā sati;Akiccaṃ te na sevanti, kicce sātaccakārino;Satānaṃ sampajānānaṃ, atthaṃ gacchanti āsavā.

But for those whose mindfulness directed to the body is always well established, who do not pursue what should not be done and are persistent in doing what should be done—for such mindful and clearly comprehending ones, the taints go to destruction.

294.
Mātaraṃ pitaraṃ hantvā, rājāno dve ca khattiye;Raṭṭhaṃ sānucaraṃ hantvā, anīgho yāti brāhmaṇo.

Having slain mother and father, and two warrior kings, and having destroyed the kingdom with its retinue, the brahmin goes untroubled.

295.
Mātaraṃ pitaraṃ hantvā, rājāno dve ca sotthiye;Veyagghapañcamaṃ hantvā, anīgho yāti brāhmaṇo.

Having slain mother and father, and two brahmin kings, and having slain the tiger as the fifth, the brahmin goes untroubled.

296.
Suppabuddhaṃ pabujjhanti, sadā gotamasāvakā;Yesaṃ divā ca ratto ca, niccaṃ buddhagatā sati.

The disciples of Gotama are always well-awakened, they whose mindfulness by day and by night is constantly directed to the Buddha.

297.
Suppabuddhaṃ pabujjhanti, sadā gotamasāvakā;Yesaṃ divā ca ratto ca, niccaṃ dhammagatā sati.

The disciples of Gotama are always well-awakened, they whose mindfulness by day and by night is constantly directed to the Dhamma.

Suppabuddhaṃ pabujjhanti, sadā gotamasāvakā;Yesaṃ divā ca ratto ca, niccaṃ saṅghagatā sati.

The disciples of Gotama are always well-awakened, they whose mindfulness by day and by night is constantly directed to the Sangha.

299.
Suppabuddhaṃ pabujjhanti, sadā gotamasāvakā;Yesaṃ divā ca ratto ca, niccaṃ kāyagatā sati.

The disciples of Gotama are always well-awakened, they whose mindfulness by day and by night is constantly directed to the body.

300.
Suppabuddhaṃ pabujjhanti, sadā gotamasāvakā;Yesaṃ divā ca ratto ca, ahiṃsāya rato mano.

The disciples of Gotama are always well-awakened, they whose minds by day and by night delight in harmlessness.

301.
Suppabuddhaṃ pabujjhanti, sadā gotamasāvakā;Yesaṃ divā ca ratto ca, bhāvanāya rato mano.

The disciples of Gotama are always well-awakened, they whose minds by day and by night delight in mental development.

302.
Duppabbajjaṃ durabhiramaṃ, durāvāsā gharā dukhā;Dukkhosamānasaṃvāso, dukkhānupatitaddhagū;Tasmā na caddhagū siyā, na ca [tasmā na caddhagū na ca (ka.)] dukkhānupatito siyā [dukkhānupātito (?)].

Difficult is the going forth, difficult to delight in. Difficult and painful is the household life. Painful is association with those unequal. The wayfarer is beset by suffering. Therefore, do not be a wayfarer; do not be one beset by suffering.

303.
Saddho sīlena sampanno, yasobhogasamappito;Yaṃ yaṃ padesaṃ bhajati, tattha tattheva pūjito.

One who has faith, is accomplished in virtue, and is endowed with fame and wealth, is honored wherever he goes.

304.
Dūre santo pakāsenti, himavantova pabbato;Asantettha na dissanti, rattiṃ khittā yathā sarā.

The good shine from afar like the Himalaya mountain; but the wicked are not seen here, like arrows shot in the night.

305.
Ekāsanaṃ ekaseyyaṃ, eko caramatandito;Eko damayamattānaṃ, vanante ramito siyā.

Sitting alone, lying down alone, wandering alone and unwearied, one who tames himself alone should find delight in the forest.
Pakiṇṇakavaggo ekavīsatimo niṭṭhito.
The Miscellaneous Chapter, the twenty-first, is concluded.
