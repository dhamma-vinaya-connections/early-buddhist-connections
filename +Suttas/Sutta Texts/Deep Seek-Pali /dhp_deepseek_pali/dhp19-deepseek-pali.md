# Dhp 19. Dhammaṭṭhavaggo
## 

256.
Na tena hoti dhammaṭṭho, yenatthaṃ sāhasā [sahasā (sī. syā. ka.)] naye;Yo ca atthaṃ anatthañca, ubho niccheyya paṇḍito.

One is not thereby just because one settles a case hastily. The wise person is one who investigates both what is right and what is wrong.

257.
Asāhasena dhammena, samena nayatī pare;Dhammassa gutto medhāvī, ‘‘dhammaṭṭho’’ti pavuccati.

He who guides others impartially and non-violently, in accordance with the Dhamma—that wise one, guarded by the Dhamma, is called 'one who is just.'

258.
Na tena paṇḍito hoti, yāvatā bahu bhāsati;Khemī averī abhayo, ‘‘paṇḍito’’ti pavuccati.

One is not wise merely because one speaks much. He who is secure, without hate, and fearless is called 'a wise one.'

259.
Na tāvatā dhammadharo, yāvatā bahu bhāsati;Yo ca appampi sutvāna, dhammaṃ kāyena passati;Sa ve dhammadharo hoti, yo dhammaṃ nappamajjati.

One is not a bearer of the Dhamma merely because one speaks much. But whoever, having heard even a little, personally experiences the Dhamma and is not heedless of it, he is truly called a bearer of the Dhamma.

260.
Na tena thero so hoti [thero hoti (sī. syā.)], yenassa palitaṃ siro;Paripakko vayo tassa, ‘‘moghajiṇṇo’’ti vuccati.

He is not an elder just because his head is gray; ripe is his age, but he is called "one grown old in vain."

261.
Yamhi saccañca dhammo ca, ahiṃsā saṃyamo damo;Sa ve vantamalo dhīro, ‘‘thero’’ iti [so theroti (syā. ka.)] pavuccati.

He in whom there are truth, Dhamma, non-harming, restraint, and self-control—that steadfast one, who has cast out impurities, is called an 'elder.'

262.
Na vākkaraṇamattena, vaṇṇapokkharatāya vā;Sādhurūpo naro hoti, issukī maccharī saṭho.

Not by mere eloquence, nor by a beautiful complexion, does an envious, selfish, and deceitful person become a person of good character.

263.
Yassa cetaṃ samucchinnaṃ, mūlaghaccaṃ samūhataṃ;Sa vantadoso medhāvī, ‘‘sādhurūpo’’ti vuccati.

But he in whom this is utterly cut off, destroyed at the root, eradicated—that wise one, who has cast out faults, is called 'a person of good character.'

264.
Na muṇḍakena samaṇo, abbato alikaṃ bhaṇaṃ;Icchālobhasamāpanno, samaṇo kiṃ bhavissati.

Not by a shaven head is one a Samaṇa, if undisciplined and speaking falsehood; filled with desire and greed, how can one be a Samaṇa?

265.
Yo ca sameti pāpāni, aṇuṃ thūlāni sabbaso;Samitattā hi pāpānaṃ, ‘‘samaṇo’’ti pavuccati.

But he who has pacified evils altogether, both small and great—he is called a 'recluse' because he has pacified evils.

266.
Na tena bhikkhu so hoti, yāvatā bhikkhate pare;Vissaṃ dhammaṃ samādāya, bhikkhu hoti na tāvatā.

One is not a monk merely by begging from others; by adopting a corrupt practice, one does not on that account become a monk.

267.
Yodha puññañca pāpañca, bāhetvā brahmacariyavā [brahmacariyaṃ (ka.)];Saṅkhāya loke carati, sa ve ‘‘bhikkhū’’ti vuccati.

He who in this world has set aside both merit and evil, and lives the holy life, faring with full understanding—he, indeed, is called a 'monk.'

268.
Na monena munī hoti, mūḷharūpo aviddasu;Yo ca tulaṃva paggayha, varamādāya paṇḍito.

One does not become a sage by observing silence if one is deluded and ignorant. The wise one is he who, as if holding a scale, takes up what is best.

269.
Pāpāni parivajjeti, sa munī tena so muni;Yo munāti ubho loke, ‘‘muni’’ tena pavuccati.

And avoids evils—by that he is a sage. He who comprehends both worlds is on that account called a 'sage'.

270.
Na tena ariyo hoti, yena pāṇāni hiṃsati;Ahiṃsā sabbapāṇānaṃ, ‘‘ariyo’’ti pavuccati.

One is not noble because one harms living beings. Through non-harming toward all living beings, one is called 'noble.'

271.
Na sīlabbatamattena, bāhusaccena vā pana;Atha vā samādhilābhena, vivittasayanena vā.

Not merely by virtue and observances, nor by much learning, nor by the attainment of concentration, nor by dwelling in seclusion,

272.
Phusāmi nekkhammasukhaṃ, aputhujjanasevitaṃ;Bhikkhu vissāsamāpādi, appatto āsavakkhayaṃ.

(Thinking,) 'I experience the bliss of renunciation, not enjoyed by worldlings'—O monk, do not be confident so long as you have not attained the destruction of the taints.
Dhammaṭṭhavaggo ekūnavīsatimo niṭṭhito.
The Chapter on the Just, the Nineteenth, is concluded.
