# Ud 3.10 Lokasuttaṃ

## Ud 3.10 The Discourse on the World

30. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā uruvelāyaṃ viharati najjā nerañjarāya tīre bodhirukkhamūle paṭhamābhisambuddho. Tena kho pana samayena bhagavā sattāhaṃ ekapallaṅkena nisinno hoti vimuttisukhapaṭisaṃvedī.

30.Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Uruvelā, on the bank of the Nerañjarā River, at the foot of the Bodhi tree, just after his full enlightenment. For seven days the Blessed One sat in a single cross-legged posture, experiencing the bliss of liberation.

Atha kho bhagavā tassa sattāhassa accayena tamhā samādhimhā vuṭṭhahitvā buddhacakkhunā lokaṃ volokesi. Addasā kho bhagavā buddhacakkhunā volokento satte anekehi santāpehi santappamāne, anekehi ca pariḷāhehi pariḍayhamāne – rāgajehipi, dosajehipi, mohajehipi [mohajehipīti (sabbattha)].

Then, at the end of those seven days, the Blessed One arose from that concentration and surveyed the world with his Buddha-eye. As he surveyed the world with his Buddha-eye, the Blessed One saw beings tormented by many afflictions, burning with many distresses—those born of lust, those born of hatred, those born of delusion.

Atha kho bhagavā etamatthaṃ viditvā tāyaṃ velāyaṃ imaṃ udānaṃ udānesi –

Then, understanding this matter, the Blessed One uttered this inspired utterance:

‘‘Ayaṃ loko santāpajāto,Phassapareto rogaṃ vadati attato;Yena yena hi maññati [yena hi maññati (syā. pī.)],Tato taṃ hoti aññathā.

"This world is tormented. Overcome by contact, it calls itself a disease. Whatever it conceives, that turns out otherwise."

‘‘Aññathābhāvī bhavasatto loko,Bhavapareto bhavamevābhinandati;Yadabhinandati taṃ bhayaṃ,Yassa bhāyati taṃ dukkhaṃ;Bhavavippahānāya kho panidaṃ brahmacariyaṃ vussati’’.

"The world, attached to becoming, is prone to change. Overcome by becoming, it delights only in becoming. What it delights in is fear; what it fears is suffering. But this holy life is lived for the abandoning of becoming."

‘‘‘Ye hi keci samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā bhavena bhavassa vippamokkhamāhaṃsu, sabbe te avippamuttā bhavasmā’ti vadāmi. ‘Ye vā pana keci samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā vibhavena bhavassa nissaraṇamāhaṃsu, sabbe te anissaṭā bhavasmā’ti vadāmi.

"Whoever, whether ascetics or brahmins, have declared liberation from becoming by means of becoming, I say they are not liberated from becoming. And whoever, whether ascetics or brahmins, have declared escape from becoming by means of non-becoming, I say they have not escaped from becoming."

‘‘Upadhiñhi paṭicca dukkhamidaṃ sambhoti, sabbupādānakkhayā natthi dukkhassa sambhavo. Lokamimaṃ passa; puthū avijjāya paretā bhūtā bhūtaratā aparimuttā; ye hi keci bhavā sabbadhi sabbatthatāya sabbe te bhavā aniccā dukkhā vipariṇāmadhammā’’ti.

"Indeed, this suffering arises dependent on acquisitions; with the destruction of all clinging, there is no arising of suffering. Behold this world: beings, overcome by ignorance, delight in becoming, unreleased. Whatever states of becoming there are, in every respect, in every way, all those states of becoming are impermanent, suffering, and subject to change."

‘‘Evametaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, sammappaññāya passato;Bhavataṇhā pahīyati, vibhavaṃ nābhinandati.

Seeing this as it actually is with right wisdom, craving for becoming is abandoned, and one does not delight in non-becoming.

‘‘Sabbaso taṇhānaṃ khayā,Asesavirāganirodho nibbānaṃ;Tassa nibbutassa bhikkhuno,Anupādā [anupādānā (sī.)] punabbhavo na hoti;Abhibhūto māro vijitasaṅgāmo,Upaccagā sabbabhavāni tādī’’ti. dasamaṃ;

"Through the utter destruction of craving, Nibbāna is the cessation, the fading away without remainder. For that monk who is cooled, there is no renewed becoming without clinging. Māra is overcome, the battle is won; such a one has transcended all states of becoming." The tenth.

Nandavaggo tatiyo niṭṭhito.

The Chapter on Delight, the Third, is finished.

Tassuddānaṃ –

Its summary is:

Kammaṃ nando yasojo ca, sāriputto ca kolito;Pilindo [pilindi (sī.)] kassapo piṇḍo, sippaṃ lokena te dasāti.

Kamma, Nanda, Yasojā, and Sāriputta; Kolita, Pilinda, Kassapa, Piṇḍola; Skill and the World, these are the ten.
