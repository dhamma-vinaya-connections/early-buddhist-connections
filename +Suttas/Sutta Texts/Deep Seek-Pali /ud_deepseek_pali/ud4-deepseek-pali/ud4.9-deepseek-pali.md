# Ud 4.9 Upasenasuttaṃ

## Ud 4.9 Upasena Sutta

39. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā rājagahe viharati veḷuvane kalandakanivāpe. Atha kho āyasmato upasenassa vaṅgantaputtassa rahogatassa paṭisallīnassa evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – ‘‘lābhā vata me, suladdhaṃ vata me, satthā ca me bhagavā arahaṃ sammāsambuddho; svākkhāte camhi dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajito; sabrahmacārino ca me sīlavanto kalyāṇadhammā; sīlesu camhi paripūrakārī; susamāhito camhi ekaggacitto; arahā camhi khīṇāsavo; mahiddhiko camhi mahānubhāvo. Bhaddakaṃ me jīvitaṃ, bhaddakaṃ maraṇa’’nti.

39.Thus have I heard: At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. Then, while the Venerable Upasena, the son of Vaṅganta, was in seclusion and withdrawn, this thought arose in his mind: "It is a gain for me, it is well gained for me, that my Teacher is the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One; that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness in the well-proclaimed Dhamma and Discipline; that my fellow celibates are virtuous and of excellent qualities; that I am one who fulfills the precepts; that I am well concentrated, with a unified mind; that I am an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed; that I am one of great psychic power, of great might. Good is my life, good is my death."

Atha kho bhagavā āyasmato upasenassa vaṅgantaputtassa cetasā cetoparivitakkamaññāya tāyaṃ velāyaṃ imaṃ udānaṃ udānesi –

Then, having known with his mind the mental thought-process of the Venerable Upasena, the son of Vaṅganta, the Blessed One on that occasion uttered this inspired utterance:

‘‘Yaṃ jīvitaṃ na tapati, maraṇante na socati;Sa ve diṭṭhapado dhīro, sokamajjhe na socati.

"Whose life does not torment him, / Who does not grieve at death’s approach, / That wise one, who has seen the state, / Does not grieve in the midst of sorrow."

‘‘Ucchinnabhavataṇhassa, santacittassa bhikkhuno;Vikkhīṇo jātisaṃsāro, natthi tassa punabbhavo’’ti. navamaṃ;

"For the bhikkhu whose craving for existence is cut off, / Whose mind is tranquil, / The cycle of births is exhausted; / There is no further becoming for him."
