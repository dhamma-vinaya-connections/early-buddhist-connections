# Ud 6.3 Paccavekkhaṇasuttaṃ

## Ud 6.3 The Discourse on Re-examination

53. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena bhagavā attano aneke pāpake akusale dhamme pahīne paccavekkhamāno nisinno hoti, aneke ca kusale dhamme bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gate.

53.Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Monastery. At that time the Blessed One was seated, reflecting on the many evil, unwholesome qualities he had abandoned and on the many wholesome qualities that had reached full maturity through development.

Atha kho bhagavā [etamatthaṃ viditvā (sī. ka.)] attano aneke pāpake akusale dhamme pahīne viditvā aneke ca kusale dhamme bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gate [etamatthaṃ viditvā (sī. ka.)] tāyaṃ velāyaṃ imaṃ udānaṃ udānesi –

Then the Blessed One, knowing that many evil, unwholesome qualities had been abandoned in himself and that many wholesome qualities had reached full development, on that occasion uttered this inspired utterance:

‘‘Ahu pubbe tadā nāhu, nāhu pubbe tadā ahu;Na cāhu na ca bhavissati, na cetarahi vijjatī’’ti. tatiyaṃ;

“It was formerly, then it was not; formerly it was not, then it was. It neither was nor will be, nor is it found now.” Third.
