## 33. The Great Cowherd Discourse

346. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘bhikkhavo’’ti. ‘‘Bhadante’’ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca –

346.Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Monastery. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus.” “Venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

‘‘Ekādasahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgato gopālako abhabbo gogaṇaṃ pariharituṃ phātiṃ kātuṃ [phātikattuṃ (sī. pī.), phātikātuṃ (syā. kaṃ.)]. Katamehi ekādasahi? Idha, bhikkhave, gopālako na rūpaññū hoti, na lakkhaṇakusalo hoti, na āsāṭikaṃ hāretā [sāṭetā (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] hoti, na vaṇaṃ paṭicchādetā hoti, na dhūmaṃ kattā hoti, na titthaṃ jānāti, na pītaṃ jānāti, na vīthiṃ jānāti, na gocarakusalo hoti anavasesadohī ca hoti. Ye te usabhā gopitaro gopariṇāyakā te na atirekapūjāya pūjetā hoti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, ekādasahi aṅgehi samannāgato gopālako abhabbo gogaṇaṃ pariharituṃ phātiṃ kātuṃ. Evameva kho, bhikkhave, ekādasahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu abhabbo imasmiṃ dhammavinaye vuddhiṃ virūḷhiṃ vepullaṃ āpajjituṃ. Katamehi ekādasahi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na rūpaññū hoti, na lakkhaṇakusalo hoti, na āsāṭikaṃ hāretā hoti, na vaṇaṃ paṭicchādetā hoti, na dhūmaṃ kattā hoti, na titthaṃ jānāti, na pītaṃ jānāti, na vīthiṃ jānāti, na gocarakusalo hoti, anavasesadohī ca hoti. Ye te bhikkhū therā rattaññū cirapabbajitā saṅghapitaro saṅghapariṇāyakā te na atirekapūjāya pūjetā hoti.

“Monks, a cowherd endowed with eleven factors is incapable of maintaining and prospering a herd of cattle. What are the eleven? Here, monks, a cowherd is not one who knows forms, is not skilled in characteristics, is not one who removes the festering, is not one who covers wounds, is not one who makes smoke, does not know the watering place, does not know what has been drunk, does not know the way, is not skilled in pasturage, and is one who milks them dry. He is not one who honors with extra respect those bulls who are fathers and leaders of the herd. Monks, a cowherd endowed with these eleven factors is incapable of maintaining and prospering a herd of cattle. In the same way, monks, a bhikkhu endowed with eleven qualities is incapable of growth, progress, and abundance in this Dhamma and Discipline. What are the eleven? Here, monks, a bhikkhu is not one who knows forms, is not skilled in characteristics, is not one who dispels unwholesome thoughts, is not one who covers wounds, is not one who makes smoke, does not know the watering place, does not know what has been drunk, does not know the way, is not skilled in pasturage, and is one who milks dry. He is not one who honors with extra respect those bhikkhus who are elders, long experienced, long gone forth, fathers of the Saṅgha, leaders of the Saṅgha.

347. ‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na rūpaññū hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu yaṃ kiñci rūpaṃ sabbaṃ rūpaṃ ‘cattāri mahābhūtāni, catunnañca mahābhūtānaṃ upādāyarūpa’nti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na rūpaññū hoti.

347.“And how, monks, is a bhikkhu not one who knows forms? Here, monks, a bhikkhu does not truly understand whatever form there is, all form, as it really is: ‘The four great elements and the form derived from the four great elements.’ Thus, monks, a bhikkhu is not one who knows forms.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na lakkhaṇakusalo hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ‘kammalakkhaṇo bālo, kammalakkhaṇo paṇḍito’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na lakkhaṇakusalo hoti.

“And how, monks, is a bhikkhu not skilled in characteristics? Here, monks, a bhikkhu does not truly understand as it actually is that ‘a fool is characterized by his actions, a wise person is characterized by his actions.’ Thus, monks, a bhikkhu is not skilled in characteristics.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na āsāṭikaṃ hāretā hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu uppannaṃ kāmavitakkaṃ adhivāseti, nappajahati na vinodeti na byantī karoti na anabhāvaṃ gameti. Uppannaṃ byāpādavitakkaṃ…pe… uppannaṃ vihiṃsāvitakkaṃ…pe… uppannuppanne pāpake akusale dhamme adhivāseti, nappajahati na vinodeti na byantī karoti na anabhāvaṃ gameti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na āsāṭikaṃ hāretā hoti.

“And how, monks, is a bhikkhu not one who removes the festering? Here, monks, a bhikkhu tolerates an arisen sensual thought; he does not abandon it, does not dispel it, does not terminate it, and does not obliterate it. He tolerates an arisen thought of ill will… an arisen thought of harm… and any arisen evil unwholesome states; he does not abandon them, does not dispel them, does not terminate them, and does not obliterate them. Thus, monks, a bhikkhu is not one who removes the festering.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na vaṇaṃ paṭicchādetā hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu cakkhunā rūpaṃ disvā nimittaggāhī hoti anubyañjanaggāhī. Yatvādhikaraṇamenaṃ cakkhundriyaṃ asaṃvutaṃ viharantaṃ abhijjhādomanassā pāpakā akusalā dhammā anvāssaveyyuṃ, tassa saṃvarāya na paṭipajjati, na rakkhati cakkhundriyaṃ, cakkhundriye na saṃvaraṃ āpajjati. Sotena saddaṃ sutvā…pe… ghānena gandhaṃ ghāyitvā…pe… jivhāya rasaṃ sāyitvā…pe… kāyena phoṭṭhabbaṃ phusitvā…pe… manasā dhammaṃ viññāya nimittaggāhī hoti anubyañjanaggāhī. Yatvādhikaraṇamenaṃ manindriyaṃ asaṃvutaṃ viharantaṃ abhijjhādomanassā pāpakā akusalā dhammā anvāssaveyyuṃ, tassa saṃvarāya na paṭipajjati, na rakkhati manindriyaṃ, manindriye na saṃvaraṃ āpajjati. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na vaṇaṃ paṭicchādetā hoti.

“And how, monks, is a bhikkhu not one who covers wounds? Here, monks, a bhikkhu, having seen a form with the eye, grasps at its signs and details. Because, if he were to dwell with the eye faculty unrestrained, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and displeasure might invade him, he does not practice for its restraint, he does not guard the eye faculty, and he does not undertake restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard a sound with the ear… Having smelled an odor with the nose… Having tasted a flavor with the tongue… Having touched a tangible with the body… Having cognized a mental object with the mind, he grasps at its signs and details. Because, if he were to dwell with the mind faculty unrestrained, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and displeasure might invade him, he does not practice for its restraint, he does not guard the mind faculty, and he does not undertake restraint of the mind faculty. Thus, monks, a bhikkhu is not one who covers wounds.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na dhūmaṃ kattā hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ na vitthārena paresaṃ desetā hoti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na dhūmaṃ kattā hoti.

“And how, monks, is a bhikkhu not one who makes smoke? Here, monks, a bhikkhu does not teach the Dhamma in detail to others as he has heard and mastered it. Thus, monks, a bhikkhu is not one who makes smoke.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na titthaṃ jānāti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ye te bhikkhū bahussutā āgatāgamā dhammadharā vinayadharā mātikādharā, te kālena kālaṃ upasaṅkamitvā na paripucchati, na paripañhati – ‘idaṃ, bhante, kathaṃ? Imassa ko attho’ti? Tassa te āyasmanto avivaṭañceva na vivaranti, anuttānīkatañca na uttānī karonti, anekavihitesu ca kaṅkhāṭhānīyesu dhammesu kaṅkhaṃ na paṭivinodenti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na titthaṃ jānāti.

“And how, monks, does a bhikkhu not know the watering place? Here, monks, a bhikkhu does not, from time to time, approach those bhikkhus who are learned, who have come down through the tradition, upholders of the Dhamma, upholders of the Vinaya, upholders of the mātikā, and ask them questions, does not inquire of them: ‘How is this, venerable sir? What is its meaning?’ Those venerable ones do not reveal what is unrevealed, do not make plain what is not plain, and do not dispel his doubt about the many points that cause doubt. Thus, monks, a bhikkhu does not know the watering place.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na pītaṃ jānāti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye desiyamāne na labhati atthavedaṃ, na labhati dhammavedaṃ, na labhati dhammūpasaṃhitaṃ pāmojjaṃ. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na pītaṃ jānāti.

“And how, monks, does a bhikkhu not know what has been drunk? Here, monks, when the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata are being taught, a bhikkhu does not gain the sense of the meaning, does not gain the sense of the Dhamma, and does not gain joy associated with the Dhamma. Thus, monks, a bhikkhu does not know what has been drunk.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na vīthiṃ jānāti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ariyaṃ aṭṭhaṅgikaṃ maggaṃ yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na vīthiṃ jānāti.

“And how, monks, is a bhikkhu not one who knows the way? Here, monks, a bhikkhu does not understand the noble eight-factored path as it really is. Thus, monks, a bhikkhu is not one who knows the way.”

“And how, monks, is a bhikkhu not skilled in pasturage? Here, monks, a bhikkhu does not truly understand the four establishments of mindfulness. Thus, monks, a bhikkhu is not skilled in pasturage.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu anavasesadohī hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhuṃ saddhā gahapatikā abhihaṭṭhuṃ pavārenti cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhārehi, tatra bhikkhu mattaṃ na jānāti paṭiggahaṇāya. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu anavasesadohī hoti.

“And how, monks, is a bhikkhu one who milks dry? Here, monks, faithful householders offer a bhikkhu robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites for the sick. But that bhikkhu does not know moderation in accepting them. Thus, monks, a bhikkhu is one who milks dry.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ye te bhikkhū therā rattaññū cirapabbajitā saṅghapitaro saṅghapariṇāyakā te na atirekapūjāya pūjetā hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ye te bhikkhū therā rattaññū cirapabbajitā saṅghapitaro saṅghapariṇāyakā, tesu na mettaṃ kāyakammaṃ paccupaṭṭhāpeti āvi ceva raho ca; na mettaṃ vacīkammaṃ paccupaṭṭhāpeti āvi ceva raho ca; na mettaṃ manokammaṃ paccupaṭṭhāpeti āvi ceva raho ca. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ye te bhikkhū therā rattaññū cirapabbajitā saṅghapitaro saṅghapariṇāyakā te na atirekapūjāya pūjetā hoti.

“And how, monks, is a bhikkhu not one who honors with extra respect those bhikkhus who are elders, long experienced, long gone forth, fathers of the Saṅgha, leaders of the Saṅgha?

Thus, monks, a bhikkhu is not one who honors with extra respect those bhikkhus who are elders, long experienced, long gone forth, fathers of the Saṅgha, leaders of the Saṅgha.”

‘‘Imehi kho bhikkhave ekādasahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu abhabbo imasmiṃ dhammavinaye vuddhiṃ virūḷhiṃ vepullaṃ āpajjituṃ.
