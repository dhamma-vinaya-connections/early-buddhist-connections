Water... fire... air... beings... gods... Pajāpati... Brahmā... the Ābhassara gods... the Subhakiṇha gods... the Vehapphala gods... the Abhibhū... the dimension of infinite space... the dimension of infinite consciousness... the dimension of nothingness... the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception... the seen... the heard... the sensed... the known... oneness... diversity... all... Nibbāna—he directly knows Nibbāna as Nibbāna. Directly knowing Nibbāna as Nibbāna, he does not conceive himself as Nibbāna, he does not conceive himself in Nibbāna, he does not conceive himself from Nibbāna, he does not conceive 'Nibbāna is mine,' he does not delight in Nibbāna. Why is that? Because of the destruction of aversion; he is without aversion.

The section delineating the fifth stage of understanding, based on the destruction of the taints, is concluded.

11. "Even that monk, bhikkhus, who is an arahant, with taints destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, attained his own welfare, utterly destroyed the fetters of being, and is liberated through perfect knowledge—he too directly knows earth as earth. Having directly known earth as earth, he does not conceive himself as earth, he does not conceive himself in earth, he does not conceive himself from earth, he does not conceive 'earth is mine,' he does not delight in earth. Why is that? Because of the destruction of delusion; he is without delusion."

Here ends the delineation of the sixth methodological ground, in terms of the one whose taints are destroyed.

12. ‘‘Tathāgatopi, bhikkhave, arahaṃ sammāsambuddho pathaviṃ pathavito abhijānāti; pathaviṃ pathavito abhiññāya pathaviṃ na maññati, pathaviyā na maññati, pathavito na maññati, pathaviṃ meti na maññati, pathaviṃ nābhinandati. Taṃ kissa hetu? ‘Pariññātantaṃ tathāgatassā’ti vadāmi.

12. "Even the Tathāgata, bhikkhus, who is an arahant, a perfectly enlightened Buddha, directly knows earth as earth. Having directly known earth as earth, he does not conceive himself as earth, he does not conceive himself in earth, he does not conceive himself from earth, he does not conceive 'earth is mine,' he does not delight in earth. Why is that? 'It has been fully understood by the Tathāgata,' I say."

Tathāgatavasena sattamanayabhūmiparicchedo niṭṭhito.

Here ends the delineation of the seventh methodological stage with reference to the Tathāgata.

13. ‘‘Tathāgatopi, bhikkhave, arahaṃ sammāsambuddho pathaviṃ pathavito abhijānāti; pathaviṃ pathavito abhiññāya pathaviṃ na maññati, pathaviyā na maññati, pathavito na maññati, pathaviṃ meti na maññati, pathaviṃ nābhinandati.

13. "Monks, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, directly knows earth as earth. Having directly known earth as earth, he does not conceive himself as earth, he does not conceive himself in earth, he does not conceive himself from earth, he does not conceive earth as 'mine,' he does not delight in earth. Why is that? Because he knows that delight is the root of suffering, and that with being as condition, birth arises, and that for what has come to be, there is aging and death. Therefore, monks, through the utter destruction, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishment of all cravings, the Tathāgata is fully awakened to unsurpassed Perfect Enlightenment, I say."

‘‘Āpaṃ …pe… tejaṃ… vāyaṃ… bhūte… deve… pajāpatiṃ… brahmaṃ… ābhassare… subhakiṇhe… vehapphale… abhibhuṃ… ākāsānañcāyatanaṃ… viññāṇañcāyatanaṃ… ākiñcaññāyatanaṃ… nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṃ… diṭṭhaṃ… sutaṃ… mutaṃ… viññātaṃ… ekattaṃ… nānattaṃ… sabbaṃ… nibbānaṃ nibbānato abhijānāti; nibbānaṃ nibbānato abhiññāya nibbānaṃ na maññati, nibbānasmiṃ na maññati, nibbānato na maññati, nibbānaṃ meti na maññati, nibbānaṃ nābhinandati.

He directly knows water as water... fire... air... beings... gods... Pajāpati... Brahmā... the Ābhassara gods... the Subhakiṇha gods... the Vehapphala gods... the Abhibhū... the dimension of infinite space... the dimension of infinite consciousness... the dimension of nothingness... the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception... the seen... the heard... the sensed... the known... oneness... diversity... all...

The eighth chapter on the exposition of the grounds in terms of the Tathāgata is completed.

Idamavoca bhagavā. Na te bhikkhū [na attamanā tebhikkhū (syā.), te bhikkhū (pī. ka.)] bhagavato bhāsitaṃ abhinandunti.

That is what the Blessed One said. Those monks did not rejoice in the Blessed One's words.

Mūlapariyāyasuttaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ paṭhamaṃ.

The Root Exposition Discourse, the first, is concluded.
