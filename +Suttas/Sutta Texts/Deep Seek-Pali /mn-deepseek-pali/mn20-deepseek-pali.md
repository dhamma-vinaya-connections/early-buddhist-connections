## 20. The Discourse on the Stilling of Thoughts

216. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘bhikkhavo’’ti. ‘‘Bhadante’’ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca –

216.Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!” “Venerable sir,” they replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

‘‘Adhicittamanuyuttena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā pañca nimittāni kālena kālaṃ manasi kātabbāni. Katamāni pañca? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno yaṃ nimittaṃ āgamma yaṃ nimittaṃ manasikaroto uppajjanti pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṃhitāpi dosūpasaṃhitāpi mohūpasaṃhitāpi, tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā tamhā nimittā aññaṃ nimittaṃ manasi kātabbaṃ kusalūpasaṃhitaṃ. Tassa tamhā nimittā aññaṃ nimittaṃ manasikaroto kusalūpasaṃhitaṃ ye pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṃhitāpi dosūpasaṃhitāpi mohūpasaṃhitāpi te pahīyanti te abbhatthaṃ gacchanti. Tesaṃ pahānā ajjhattameva cittaṃ santiṭṭhati sannisīdati ekodi hoti [ekodibhoti (syā. ka.)] samādhiyati. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, dakkho palagaṇḍo vā palagaṇḍantevāsī vā sukhumāya āṇiyā oḷārikaṃ āṇiṃ abhinihaneyya abhinīhareyya abhinivatteyya [abhinivajjeyya (sī. pī.)]; evameva kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno yaṃ nimittaṃ āgamma yaṃ nimittaṃ manasikaroto uppajjanti pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṃhitāpi dosūpasaṃhitāpi mohūpasaṃhitāpi, tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā tamhā nimittā aññaṃ nimittaṃ manasi kātabbaṃ kusalūpasaṃhitaṃ. Tassa tamhā nimittā aññaṃ nimittaṃ manasikaroto kusalūpasaṃhitaṃ ye pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṃhitāpi dosūpasaṃhitāpi mohūpasaṃhitāpi te pahīyanti te abbhatthaṃ gacchanti. Tesaṃ pahānā ajjhattameva cittaṃ santiṭṭhati sannisīdati ekodi hoti samādhiyati.

Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu devoted to the higher mind should from time to time attend to five themes. What are the five? Here, bhikkhus, if, when a bhikkhu attends to a certain theme, evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, aversion, or delusion still arise in him, then that bhikkhu should attend to another theme connected with what is wholesome. When he attends to another theme connected with what is wholesome, those evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, aversion, or delusion are abandoned and subside. With their abandonment, his mind becomes settled internally, composed, unified, and concentrated. Just as, bhikkhus, a skilled carpenter or his apprentice would use a fine peg to drive out a coarse one, so too, bhikkhus, if, when a bhikkhu attends to a certain theme, evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, aversion, or delusion still arise in him, then that bhikkhu should attend to another theme connected with what is wholesome. When he attends to another theme connected with what is wholesome, those evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, aversion, or delusion are abandoned and subside. With their abandonment, his mind becomes settled internally, composed, unified, and concentrated.

217. ‘‘Tassa ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno tamhā nimittā aññaṃ nimittaṃ manasikaroto kusalūpasaṃhitaṃ uppajjanteva pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṃhitāpi dosūpasaṃhitāpi mohūpasaṃhitāpi, tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā tesaṃ vitakkānaṃ ādīnavo upaparikkhitabbo – ‘itipime vitakkā akusalā, itipime vitakkā sāvajjā, itipime vitakkā dukkhavipākā’ti. Tassa tesaṃ vitakkānaṃ ādīnavaṃ upaparikkhato ye pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṃhitāpi dosūpasaṃhitāpi mohūpasaṃhitāpi te pahīyanti te abbhatthaṃ gacchanti. Tesaṃ pahānā ajjhattameva cittaṃ santiṭṭhati sannisīdati ekodi hoti samādhiyati. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, itthī vā puriso vā daharo yuvā maṇḍanakajātiko ahikuṇapena vā kukkurakuṇapena vā manussakuṇapena vā kaṇṭhe āsattena aṭṭiyeyya harāyeyya jiguccheyya; evameva kho, bhikkhave, tassa ce bhikkhuno tamhāpi nimittā aññaṃ nimittaṃ manasikaroto kusalūpasaṃhitaṃ uppajjanteva pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṃhitāpi dosūpasaṃhitāpi mohūpasaṃhitāpi, tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā tesaṃ vitakkānaṃ ādīnavo upaparikkhitabbo – ‘itipime vitakkā akusalā, itipime vitakkā sāvajjā, itipime vitakkā dukkhavipākā’ti. Tassa tesaṃ vitakkānaṃ ādīnavaṃ upaparikkhato ye pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṃhitāpi dosūpasaṃhitāpi mohūpasaṃhitāpi te pahīyanti te abbhatthaṃ gacchanti. Tesaṃ pahānā ajjhattameva cittaṃ santiṭṭhati sannisīdati ekodi hoti samādhiyati.

217.Bhikkhus, if, when that bhikkhu is attending to another theme connected with what is wholesome, evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, aversion, or delusion still arise in him, then that bhikkhu should examine the drawbacks of those thoughts: ‘These thoughts are unwholesome, these thoughts are blameworthy, these thoughts result in suffering.’ As he examines the drawbacks of those thoughts, the evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, aversion, or delusion are abandoned and subside. With their abandonment, his mind becomes settled internally, composed, unified, and concentrated. Just as, bhikkhus, a young woman or man fond of adornment would be horrified, humiliated, and disgusted if the carcass of a snake, a dog, or a human were hung around their neck, so too, bhikkhus, if, when that bhikkhu is attending to another theme connected with what is wholesome, evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, aversion, or delusion still arise in him, then that bhikkhu should examine the drawbacks of those thoughts: ‘These thoughts are unwholesome, these thoughts are blameworthy, these thoughts result in suffering.’ As he examines the drawbacks of those thoughts, the evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, aversion, or delusion are abandoned and subside. With their abandonment, his mind becomes settled internally, composed, unified, and concentrated.

218. ‘‘Tassa ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno tesampi vitakkānaṃ ādīnavaṃ upaparikkhato uppajjanteva pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṃhitāpi dosūpasaṃhitāpi mohūpasaṃhitāpi, tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā tesaṃ vitakkānaṃ asatiamanasikāro āpajjitabbo. Tassa tesaṃ vitakkānaṃ asatiamanasikāraṃ āpajjato ye pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṃhitāpi dosūpasaṃhitāpi mohūpasaṃhitāpi te pahīyanti te abbhatthaṃ gacchanti. Tesaṃ pahānā ajjhattameva cittaṃ santiṭṭhati sannisīdati ekodi hoti samādhiyati. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, cakkhumā puriso āpāthagatānaṃ rūpānaṃ adassanakāmo assa; so nimīleyya vā aññena vā apalokeyya. Evameva kho, bhikkhave, tassa ce bhikkhuno tesampi vitakkānaṃ ādīnavaṃ upaparikkhato uppajjanteva pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṃhitāpi dosūpasaṃhitāpi mohūpasaṃhitāpi, te pahīyanti te abbhatthaṃ gacchanti. Tesaṃ pahānā ajjhattameva cittaṃ santiṭṭhati sannisīdati ekodi hoti samādhiyati.

218.Bhikkhus, if, when that bhikkhu is examining the drawbacks of even those thoughts, evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, aversion, or delusion still arise in him, then that bhikkhu should apply non-attention to those thoughts. As he applies non-attention to those thoughts, the evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, aversion, or delusion are abandoned and subside. With their abandonment, his mind becomes settled internally, composed, unified, and concentrated. Just as, bhikkhus, a man with eyes, if he did not wish to see forms that had come into range, would close his eyes or look away, so too, bhikkhus, if, when that bhikkhu is examining the drawbacks of even those thoughts, evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, aversion, or delusion still arise in him, they are abandoned and subside. With their abandonment, his mind becomes settled internally, composed, unified, and concentrated.

219. ‘‘Tassa ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno tesampi vitakkānaṃ asatiamanasikāraṃ āpajjato uppajjanteva pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṃhitāpi dosūpasaṃhitāpi mohūpasaṃhitāpi, tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā tesaṃ vitakkānaṃ vitakkasaṅkhārasaṇṭhānaṃ manasikātabbaṃ. Tassa tesaṃ vitakkānaṃ vitakkasaṅkhārasaṇṭhānaṃ manasikaroto ye pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṃhitāpi dosūpasaṃhitāpi mohūpasaṃhitāpi te pahīyanti te abbhatthaṃ gacchanti. Tesaṃ pahānā ajjhattameva cittaṃ santiṭṭhati sannisīdati ekodi hoti samādhiyati. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, puriso sīghaṃ gaccheyya. Tassa evamassa – ‘kiṃ nu kho ahaṃ sīghaṃ gacchāmi? Yaṃnūnāhaṃ saṇikaṃ gaccheyya’nti. So saṇikaṃ gaccheyya. Tassa evamassa – ‘kiṃ nu kho ahaṃ saṇikaṃ gacchāmi? Yaṃnūnāhaṃ tiṭṭheyya’nti. So tiṭṭheyya. Tassa evamassa – ‘kiṃ nu kho ahaṃ ṭhito? Yaṃnūnāhaṃ nisīdeyya’nti. So nisīdeyya. Tassa evamassa – ‘kiṃ nu kho ahaṃ nisinno? Yaṃnūnāhaṃ nipajjeyya’nti. So nipajjeyya. Evañhi so, bhikkhave, puriso oḷārikaṃ oḷārikaṃ iriyāpathaṃ abhinivajjetvā [abhinissajjetvā (syā.)] sukhumaṃ sukhumaṃ iriyāpathaṃ kappeyya. Evameva kho, bhikkhave, tassa ce bhikkhuno tesampi vitakkānaṃ asatiamanasikāraṃ āpajjato uppajjanteva pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṃhitāpi dosūpasaṃhitāpi mohūpasaṃhitāpi te pahīyanti te abbhatthaṃ gacchanti. Tesaṃ pahānā ajjhattameva cittaṃ santiṭṭhati sannisīdati ekodi hoti samādhiyati.

219.Bhikkhus, if, when that bhikkhu is applying non-attention to even those thoughts, evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, aversion, or delusion still arise in him, then that bhikkhu should attend to the source of the thought-formations of those thoughts. As he attends to the source of the thought-formations of those thoughts, the evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, aversion, or delusion are abandoned and subside. With their abandonment, his mind becomes settled internally, composed, unified, and concentrated. Just as, bhikkhus, if a man were walking quickly, he might think: ‘Why am I walking quickly? Suppose I were to walk slowly.’ So he would walk slowly. He might think: ‘Why am I walking slowly? Suppose I were to stand.’ So he would stand. He might think: ‘Why am I standing? Suppose I were to sit down.’ So he would sit down. He might think: ‘Why am I sitting? Suppose I were to lie down.’ So he would lie down. In this way, bhikkhus, that man, giving up the coarser postures, would adopt the more refined postures. So too, bhikkhus, if, when that bhikkhu is applying non-attention to even those thoughts, evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, aversion, or delusion still arise in him, they are abandoned and subside. With their abandonment, his mind becomes settled internally, composed, unified, and concentrated.

220. ‘‘Tassa ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno tesampi vitakkānaṃ vitakkasaṅkhārasaṇṭhānaṃ manasikaroto uppajjanteva pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṃhitāpi dosūpasaṃhitāpi mohūpasaṃhitāpi.

Tesaṃ pahānā ajjhattameva cittaṃ santiṭṭhati sannisīdati ekodi hoti samādhiyati. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, balavā puriso dubbalataraṃ purisaṃ sīse vā gale vā khandhe vā gahetvā abhiniggaṇheyya abhinippīḷeyya abhisantāpeyya; evameva kho, bhikkhave, tassa ce bhikkhuno tesampi vitakkānaṃ vitakkasaṅkhārasaṇṭhānaṃ manasikaroto uppajjanteva pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṃhitāpi dosūpasaṃhitāpi mohūpasaṃhitāpi.

Tesaṃ pahānā ajjhattameva cittaṃ santiṭṭhati sannisīdati ekodi hoti samādhiyati.

220."If, bhikkhus, while a bhikkhu is attending to the stilling of thought formations regarding those thoughts, unwholesome thoughts associated with desire, aversion, or delusion still arise in him, then, bhikkhus, that bhikkhu should clench his teeth, press his tongue against the roof of his mouth, and restrain, subdue, and crush his mind with his mind. As he clenches his teeth, presses his tongue against the roof of his mouth, and restrains, subdues, and crushes his mind with his mind, those unwholesome thoughts associated with desire, aversion, or delusion are abandoned and come to an end. With their abandonment, his mind becomes steadied internally, settles down, becomes unified, and becomes concentrated. Just as a strong man might seize a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder, and restrain, subdue, and crush him, so too, bhikkhus, if while a bhikkhu is attending to the stilling of thought formations regarding those thoughts, unwholesome thoughts associated with desire, aversion, or delusion still arise in him, then that bhikkhu should clench his teeth, press his tongue against the roof of his mouth, and restrain, subdue, and crush his mind with his mind. As he clenches his teeth, presses his tongue against the roof of his mouth, and restrains, subdues, and crushes his mind with his mind, those unwholesome thoughts associated with desire, aversion, or delusion are abandoned and come to an end. With their abandonment, his mind becomes steadied internally, settles down, becomes unified, and becomes concentrated."

221."When, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, by attending to a certain sign, has unwholesome thoughts associated with desire, aversion, or delusion arise in him, then, by attending to another sign associated with the wholesome, those unwholesome thoughts associated with desire, aversion, or delusion are abandoned and come to an end. With their abandonment, his mind becomes steadied internally, settles down, becomes unified, and becomes concentrated. By examining the drawbacks of those thoughts, those unwholesome thoughts associated with desire, aversion, or delusion are abandoned and come to an end. With their abandonment, his mind becomes steadied internally, settles down, becomes unified, and becomes concentrated. By paying no attention to those thoughts, those unwholesome thoughts associated with desire, aversion, or delusion are abandoned and come to an end. With their abandonment, his mind becomes steadied internally, settles down, becomes unified, and becomes concentrated. By attending to the stilling of thought formations regarding those thoughts, those unwholesome thoughts associated with desire, aversion, or delusion are abandoned and come to an end. With their abandonment, his mind becomes steadied internally, settles down, becomes unified, and becomes concentrated. By clenching his teeth, pressing his tongue against the roof of his mouth, and restraining, subduing, and crushing his mind with his mind, those unwholesome thoughts associated with desire, aversion, or delusion are abandoned and come to an end. With their abandonment, his mind becomes steadied internally, settles down, becomes unified, and becomes concentrated. This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who is a master of the ways of thought. He thinks whatever thought he wishes to think and does not think whatever thought he does not wish to think. He has cut off craving, unraveled the fetter, and by rightly overcoming conceit, he has made an end of suffering."

Idamavoca bhagavā. Attamanā te bhikkhū bhagavato bhāsitaṃ abhinandunti.

Thus spoke the Blessed One. The bhikkhus, delighted, rejoiced at the Blessed One's words.
