## 74. The Dīghanakha Sutta

201. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā rājagahe viharati gijjhakūṭe pabbate sūkarakhatāyaṃ. Atha kho dīghanakho paribbājako yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavatā saddhiṃ sammodi. Sammodanīyaṃ kathaṃ sāraṇīyaṃ vītisāretvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi. Ekamantaṃ ṭhito kho dīghanakho paribbājako bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘ahañhi, bho gotama, evaṃvādī evaṃdiṭṭhi – ‘sabbaṃ me nakkhamatī’’’ti. ‘‘Yāpi kho te esā, aggivessana, diṭṭhi – ‘sabbaṃ me nakkhamatī’ti, esāpi te diṭṭhi nakkhamatī’’ti? ‘‘Esā ce [esāpi (ka.)] me, bho gotama, diṭṭhi khameyya, taṃpassa tādisameva, taṃpassa tādisamevā’’ti. ‘‘Ato kho te, aggivessana, bahū hi bahutarā lokasmiṃ ye evamāhaṃsu – ‘taṃpassa tādisameva, taṃpassa tādisamevā’ti. Te tañceva diṭṭhiṃ nappajahanti aññañca diṭṭhiṃ upādiyanti. Ato kho te, aggivessana, tanū hi tanutarā lokasmiṃ ye evamāhaṃsu – ‘taṃpassa tādisameva, taṃpassa tādisamevā’ti. Te tañceva diṭṭhiṃ pajahanti aññañca diṭṭhiṃ na upādiyanti. Santaggivessana, eke samaṇabrāhmaṇā evaṃvādino evaṃdiṭṭhino – ‘sabbaṃ me khamatī’ti; santaggivessana, eke samaṇabrāhmaṇā evaṃvādino evaṃdiṭṭhino – ‘sabbaṃ me nakkhamatī’ti; santaggivessana, eke samaṇabrāhmaṇā evaṃvādino evaṃdiṭṭhino – ‘ekaccaṃ me khamati, ekaccaṃ me nakkhamatī’ti. Tatraggivessana, ye te samaṇabrāhmaṇā evaṃvādino evaṃdiṭṭhino – ‘sabbaṃ me khamatī’ti tesamayaṃ diṭṭhi sārāgāya santike, saññogāya santike, abhinandanāya santike ajjhosānāya santike upādānāya santike; tatraggivessana ye te samaṇabrāhmaṇā evaṃvādino evaṃdiṭṭhino – ‘sabbaṃ me nakkhamatī’ti tesamayaṃ diṭṭhi asārāgāya santike, asaññogāya santike, anabhinandanāya santike, anajjhosānāya santike, anupādānāya santike’’ti.

201.Thus have I heard—at one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, on Vulture Peak, at Sūkarakhatā. Then the wanderer Dīghanakha approached the Blessed One; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Blessed One. When the courteous and friendly talk was concluded, he stood to one side. Standing to one side, the wanderer Dīghanakha said this to the Blessed One: “I, Venerable Gotama, hold such a view and such a doctrine—‘Nothing is acceptable to me.’” “Aggivessana, even this view of yours—‘Nothing is acceptable to me’—is that view acceptable to you?” “If, Venerable Gotama, this view were acceptable to me, then that would be just so, then that would be just so.” “Aggivessana, there are many, indeed, a great many, in the world who say thus—‘Then that would be just so, then that would be just so.’ They do not abandon that view and they grasp another view. Aggivessana, there are few, indeed, very few, in the world who say thus—‘Then that would be just so, then that would be just so.’ They abandon that view and do not grasp another view. Aggivessana, there are some ascetics and brahmins who hold such a view and such a doctrine—‘All is acceptable to me.’ Aggivessana, there are some ascetics and brahmins who hold such a view and such a doctrine—‘Nothing is acceptable to me.’ Aggivessana, there are some ascetics and brahmins who hold such a view and such a doctrine—‘Some things are acceptable to me, some things are not acceptable to me.’ Here, Aggivessana, those ascetics and brahmins who hold such a view and such a doctrine—‘All is acceptable to me’—their view is near to passion, near to fettering, near to delight, near to clinging, near to grasping. Here, Aggivessana, those ascetics and brahmins who hold such a view and such a doctrine—‘Nothing is acceptable to me’—their view is near to non-passion, near to non-fettering, near to non-delight, near to non-clinging, near to non-grasping.”

202. Evaṃ vutte, dīghanakho paribbājako bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘ukkaṃseti [ukkaṃsati (sī. pī. ka.)] me bhavaṃ gotamo diṭṭhigataṃ, samukkaṃseti [sampahaṃsati (ka.)] me bhavaṃ gotamo diṭṭhigata’’nti. ‘‘Tatraggivessana, ye te samaṇabrāhmaṇā evaṃvādino evaṃdiṭṭhino – ‘ekaccaṃ me khamati, ekaccaṃ me nakkhamatī’ti. Yā hi tesaṃ khamati sāyaṃ diṭṭhi sārāgāya santike, saññogāya santike, abhinandanāya santike, ajjhosānāya santike, upādānāya santike; yā hi tesaṃ nakkhamati sāyaṃ diṭṭhi asārāgāya santike, asaññogāya santike, anabhinandanāya santike, anajjhosānāya santike, anupādānāya santike. Tatraggivessana, ye te samaṇabrāhmaṇā evaṃvādino evaṃdiṭṭhino – ‘sabbaṃ me khamatī’ti tattha viññū puriso iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘yā kho me ayaṃ diṭṭhi – sabbaṃ me khamatīti, imañce ahaṃ diṭṭhiṃ thāmasā parāmāsā abhinivissa vohareyyaṃ – idameva saccaṃ moghamaññanti; dvīhi me assa viggaho – yo cāyaṃ samaṇo vā brāhmaṇo vā evaṃvādī evaṃdiṭṭhi – sabbaṃ me nakkhamatīti, yo cāyaṃ samaṇo vā brāhmaṇo vā evaṃvādī evaṃdiṭṭhi – ekaccaṃ me khamati, ekaccaṃ me nakkhamatīti – imehi assa dvīhi viggaho. Iti viggahe sati vivādo, vivāde sati vighāto, vighāte sati vihesā’. Iti so viggahañca vivādañca vighātañca vihesañca attani sampassamāno tañceva diṭṭhiṃ pajahati aññañca diṭṭhiṃ na upādiyati. Evametāsaṃ diṭṭhīnaṃ pahānaṃ hoti, evametāsaṃ diṭṭhīnaṃ paṭinissaggo hoti.

202.When this was said, the wanderer Dīghanakha said to the Blessed One: “The Venerable Gotama praises my view, the Venerable Gotama thoroughly praises my view.” “Aggivessana, those ascetics and brahmins who hold such a view and such a doctrine—‘Some things are acceptable to me, some things are not acceptable to me’—whatever is acceptable to them, that view is near to passion, near to fettering, near to delight, near to clinging, near to grasping. Whatever is not acceptable to them, that view is near to non-passion, near to non-fettering, near to non-delight, near to non-clinging, near to non-grasping. Here, Aggivessana, regarding those ascetics and brahmins who hold such a view and such a doctrine—‘All is acceptable to me’—a wise person reflects thus: ‘If I were to cling firmly, adhere to, and insist upon this view—"All is acceptable to me"—and declare, "This alone is true, all else is false," then I would have a quarrel with two others: with that ascetic or brahmin who holds such a view and such a doctrine—"Nothing is acceptable to me," and with that ascetic or brahmin who holds such a view and such a doctrine—"Some things are acceptable to me, some things are not acceptable to me." Thus, when there is a quarrel, there is dispute; when there is dispute, there is vexation; when there is vexation, there is harassment.’ Seeing within himself the quarrel, the dispute, the vexation, and the harassment, he abandons that view and does not grasp another view. In this way, these views are abandoned; in this way, these views are relinquished.

203. ‘‘Tatraggivessana, ye te samaṇabrāhmaṇā evaṃvādino evaṃdiṭṭhino – ‘sabbaṃ me nakkhamatī’ti tattha viññū puriso iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘yā kho me ayaṃ diṭṭhi – sabbaṃ me nakkhamatī’ti, imañce ahaṃ diṭṭhiṃ thāmasā parāmāsā abhinivissa vohareyyaṃ – idameva saccaṃ moghamaññanti; dvīhi me assa viggaho – yo cāyaṃ samaṇo vā brāhmaṇo vā evaṃvādī evaṃdiṭṭhi – sabbaṃ me khamatīti, yo cāyaṃ samaṇo vā brāhmaṇo vā evaṃvādī evaṃdiṭṭhi – ekaccaṃ me khamati ekaccaṃ me nakkhamatīti – imehi assa dvīhi viggaho. Iti viggahe sati vivādo, vivāde sati vighāto, vighāte sati vihesā’. Iti so viggahañca vivādañca vighātañca vihesañca attani sampassamāno tañceva diṭṭhiṃ pajahati aññañca diṭṭhiṃ na upādiyati. Evametāsaṃ diṭṭhīnaṃ pahānaṃ hoti, evametāsaṃ diṭṭhīnaṃ paṭinissaggo hoti.

203.Here, Aggivessana, regarding those ascetics and brahmins who hold such a view and such a doctrine—‘Nothing is acceptable to me’—a wise person reflects thus: ‘If I were to cling firmly, adhere to, and insist upon this view—"Nothing is acceptable to me"—and declare, "This alone is true, all else is false," then I would have a quarrel with two others: with that ascetic or brahmin who holds such a view and such a doctrine—"All is acceptable to me," and with that ascetic or brahmin who holds such a view and such a doctrine—"Some things are acceptable to me, some things are not acceptable to me." Thus, when there is a quarrel, there is dispute; when there is dispute, there is vexation; when there is vexation, there is harassment.’ Seeing within himself the quarrel, the dispute, the vexation, and the harassment, he abandons that view and does not grasp another view. In this way, these views are abandoned; in this way, these views are relinquished.

204. ‘‘Tatraggivessana, ye te samaṇabrāhmaṇā evaṃvādino evaṃdiṭṭhino – ‘ekaccaṃ me khamati, ekaccaṃ me nakkhamatī’ti tattha viññū puriso iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘yā kho me ayaṃ diṭṭhi – ekaccaṃ me khamati, ekaccaṃ me nakkhamatīti, imañce ahaṃ diṭṭhiṃ thāmasā parāmāsā abhinivissa vohareyyaṃ – idameva saccaṃ moghamaññanti; dvīhi me assa viggaho – yo cāyaṃ samaṇo vā brāhmaṇo vā evaṃvādī evaṃdiṭṭhi – sabbaṃ me khamatīti, yo cāyaṃ samaṇo vā brāhmaṇo vā evaṃvādī evaṃdiṭṭhi – sabbaṃ me nakkhamatīti – imehi assa dvīhi viggaho. Iti viggahe sati vivādo, vivāde sati vighāto, vighāte sati vihesā’. Iti so viggahañca vivādañca vighātañca vihesañca attani sampassamāno tañceva diṭṭhiṃ pajahati aññañca diṭṭhiṃ na upādiyati. Evametāsaṃ diṭṭhīnaṃ pahānaṃ hoti, evametāsaṃ diṭṭhīnaṃ paṭinissaggo hoti.

204.Here, Aggivessana, regarding those ascetics and brahmins who hold such a view and such a doctrine—‘Some things are acceptable to me, some things are not acceptable to me’—a wise person reflects thus: ‘If I were to cling firmly, adhere to, and insist upon this view—"Some things are acceptable to me, some things are not acceptable to me"—and declare, "This alone is true, all else is false," then I would have a quarrel with two others: with that ascetic or brahmin who holds such a view and such a doctrine—"All is acceptable to me," and with that ascetic or brahmin who holds such a view and such a doctrine—"Nothing is acceptable to me." Thus, when there is a quarrel, there is dispute; when there is dispute, there is vexation; when there is vexation, there is harassment.’ Seeing within himself the quarrel, the dispute, the vexation, and the harassment, he abandons that view and does not grasp another view. In this way, these views are abandoned; in this way, these views are relinquished.

205. ‘‘Ayaṃ kho panaggivessana, kāyo rūpī cātumahābhūtiko [cātummahābhūtiko (sī. syā.)] mātāpettikasambhavo odanakummāsupacayo aniccucchādanaparimaddanabhedanaviddhaṃsanadhammo, aniccato dukkhato rogato gaṇḍato sallato aghato ābādhato parato palokato suññato anattato samanupassitabbo.

205.“Furthermore, Aggivessana, this body, which is material, composed of the four great elements, born of mother and father, nourished by rice and gruel, subject to rubbing away, massaging, breaking up, and disintegration—it should be regarded as impermanent, as suffering, as a disease, as a boil, as a dart, as a misfortune, as an affliction, as alien, as decaying, as empty, as not-self. When one regards this body thus—as impermanent, as suffering, as a disease, as a boil, as a dart, as a misfortune, as an affliction, as alien, as decaying, as empty, as not-self—whatever desire for the body, affection for the body, or attachment to the body there is, that is abandoned.

‘‘Tisso kho imā, aggivessana, vedanā – sukhā vedanā, dukkhā vedanā, adukkhamasukhā vedanā. Yasmiṃ, aggivessana, samaye sukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedeti, neva tasmiṃ samaye dukkhaṃ vedanaṃ vedeti, na adukkhamasukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedeti; sukhaṃyeva tasmiṃ samaye vedanaṃ vedeti. Yasmiṃ, aggivessana, samaye dukkhaṃ vedanaṃ vedeti, neva tasmiṃ samaye sukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedeti, na adukkhamasukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedeti; dukkhaṃyeva tasmiṃ samaye vedanaṃ vedeti. Yasmiṃ, aggivessana, samaye adukkhamasukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedeti, neva tasmiṃ samaye sukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedeti, na dukkhaṃ vedanaṃ vedeti; adukkhamasukhaṃyeva tasmiṃ samaye vedanaṃ vedeti. Sukhāpi kho, aggivessana, vedanā aniccā saṅkhatā paṭiccasamuppannā khayadhammā vayadhammā virāgadhammā nirodhadhammā; dukkhāpi kho, aggivessana, vedanā aniccā saṅkhatā paṭiccasamuppannā khayadhammā vayadhammā virāgadhammā nirodhadhammā; adukkhamasukhāpi kho, aggivessana, vedanā aniccā saṅkhatā paṭiccasamuppannā khayadhammā vayadhammā virāgadhammā nirodhadhammā. Evaṃ passaṃ, aggivessana, sutavā ariyasāvako sukhāyapi vedanāya nibbindati, dukkhāyapi vedanāya nibbindati, adukkhamasukhāyapi vedanāya nibbindati; nibbindaṃ virajjati, virāgā vimuccati. Vimuttasmiṃ, vimuttamiti ñāṇaṃ hoti. ‘Khīṇā jāti, vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ, kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ, nāparaṃ itthattāyā’ti pajānāti. Evaṃ vimuttacitto kho, aggivessana, bhikkhu na kenaci saṃvadati, na kenaci vivadati, yañca loke vuttaṃ tena voharati, aparāmasa’’nti.

“These, Aggivessana, are the three feelings: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. When, Aggivessana, one feels a pleasant feeling, at that time one does not feel a painful feeling or a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling; at that time one feels only a pleasant feeling. When, Aggivessana, one feels a painful feeling, at that time one does not feel a pleasant feeling or a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling; at that time one feels only a painful feeling. When, Aggivessana, one feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, at that time one does not feel a pleasant feeling or a painful feeling; at that time one feels only a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Pleasant feeling, Aggivessana, is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, subject to vanishing, subject to fading away, and subject to cessation. Painful feeling, Aggivessana, is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, subject to vanishing, subject to fading away, and subject to cessation. Neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, Aggivessana, is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, subject to vanishing, subject to fading away, and subject to cessation. Seeing thus, Aggivessana, a well-instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with pleasant feeling, disenchanted with painful feeling, disenchanted with neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate; through dispassion, he is liberated. When liberated, there comes the knowledge that he is liberated. He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’ A bhikkhu with a mind thus liberated, Aggivessana, does not quarrel with anyone, does not dispute with anyone; he uses the current language of the world without adhering to it.”

206. Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā sāriputto bhagavato piṭṭhito ṭhito hoti bhagavantaṃ bījayamāno [vījayamāno (sī. pī.)]. Atha kho āyasmato sāriputtassa etadahosi – ‘‘tesaṃ tesaṃ kira no bhagavā dhammānaṃ abhiññā pahānamāha, tesaṃ tesaṃ kira no sugato dhammānaṃ abhiññā paṭinissaggamāhā’’ti. Iti hidaṃ āyasmato sāriputtassa paṭisañcikkhato anupādāya āsavehi cittaṃ vimucci. Dīghanakhassa pana paribbājakassa virajaṃ vītamalaṃ dhammacakkhuṃ udapādi – ‘‘yaṃ kiñci samudayadhammaṃ sabbaṃ taṃ nirodhadhamma’’nti. Atha kho dīghanakho paribbājako diṭṭhadhammo pattadhammo viditadhammo pariyogāḷhadhammo tiṇṇavicikiccho vigatakathaṃkatho vesārajjappatto aparappaccayo satthusāsane bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘abhikkantaṃ, bho gotama, abhikkantaṃ, bho gotama! Seyyathāpi, bho gotama, nikkujjitaṃ vā ukkujjeyya, paṭicchannaṃ vā vivareyya, mūḷhassa vā maggaṃ ācikkheyya, andhakāre vā telapajjotaṃ dhāreyya – cakkhumanto rūpāni dakkhantīti – evameva kho bhotā gotamena anekapariyāyena dhammo pakāsito. Esāhaṃ bhavantaṃ gotamaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi dhammañca bhikkhusaṅghañca. Upāsakaṃ maṃ bhavaṃ gotamo dhāretu ajjatagge pāṇupetaṃ saraṇaṃ gata’’nti.

206.Now at that time, the Venerable Sāriputta was standing behind the Blessed One, fanning him. Then this thought occurred to the Venerable Sāriputta: ‘The Blessed One declares the abandoning of these and those things through direct knowledge; the Fortunate One declares the relinquishment of these and those things through direct knowledge.’ As the Venerable Sāriputta reflected thus, his mind was liberated from the taints through non-clinging. But for the wanderer Dīghanakha arose the dust-free, stainless Dhamma-eye: ‘Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.’ Then the wanderer Dīghanakha, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, plunged into the Dhamma, crossed beyond doubt, got rid of perplexity, gained assurance, and became independent of others in the Teacher’s dispensation, said to the Blessed One: ‘Excellent, Master Gotama, excellent! Just as one might set upright what was overturned, reveal what was hidden, show the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes could see forms—in the same way, Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life.’

Dīghanakhasuttaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ catutthaṃ.

The Dīghanakha Sutta, the fourth, is concluded.
