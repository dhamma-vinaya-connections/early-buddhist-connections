## 46. The Greater Discourse on the Undertaking of Practices.

473. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘bhikkhavo’’ti. ‘‘Bhadante’’ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca – ‘‘yebhuyyena, bhikkhave, sattā evaṃkāmā evaṃchandā evaṃadhippāyā – ‘aho vata aniṭṭhā akantā amanāpā dhammā parihāyeyyuṃ, iṭṭhā kantā manāpā dhammā abhivaḍḍheyyu’nti. Tesaṃ, bhikkhave, sattānaṃ evaṃkāmānaṃ evaṃchandānaṃ evaṃadhippāyānaṃ aniṭṭhā akantā amanāpā dhammā abhivaḍḍhanti, iṭṭhā kantā manāpā dhammā parihāyanti. Tatra tumhe, bhikkhave, kaṃ hetuṃ paccethā’’ti? ‘‘Bhagavaṃmūlakā no, bhante, dhammā, bhagavaṃnettikā, bhagavaṃpaṭisaraṇā. Sādhu vata, bhante, bhagavantaññeva paṭibhātu etassa bhāsitassa attho; bhagavato sutvā bhikkhū dhāressantī’’ti. ‘‘Tena hi, bhikkhave, suṇātha, sādhukaṃ manasi karotha, bhāsissāmī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti kho te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca –

473.Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi, in Jeta Grove, Anathapindika's Monastery. There the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks.” “Venerable sir,” those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this: “For the most part, monks, beings have such desires, such wishes, such intentions: ‘Oh, that unwished-for, disliked, and disagreeable things would diminish, and wished-for, liked, and agreeable things would increase!’ But for those beings, monks, having such desires, such wishes, such intentions, unwished-for, disliked, and disagreeable things increase, and wished-for, liked, and agreeable things diminish. What reason do you see for this, monks?” “Venerable sir, our teachings have the Blessed One as their root, the Blessed One as their guide, and the Blessed One as their refuge. It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One himself would reveal the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the monks will remember it.” “Then listen, monks, pay close attention, I will speak.” “Yes, venerable sir,” those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

474. ‘‘Idha, bhikkhave, assutavā puthujjano, ariyānaṃ adassāvī ariyadhammassa akovido ariyadhamme avinīto, sappurisānaṃ adassāvī sappurisadhammassa akovido sappurisadhamme avinīto, sevitabbe dhamme na jānāti asevitabbe dhamme na jānāti, bhajitabbe dhamme na jānāti abhajitabbe dhamme na jānāti. So sevitabbe dhamme ajānanto asevitabbe dhamme ajānanto, bhajitabbe dhamme ajānanto abhajitabbe dhamme ajānanto, asevitabbe dhamme sevati sevitabbe dhamme na sevati, abhajitabbe dhamme bhajati bhajitabbe dhamme na bhajati. Tassa asevitabbe dhamme sevato sevitabbe dhamme asevato, abhajitabbe dhamme bhajato bhajitabbe dhamme abhajato aniṭṭhā akantā amanāpā dhammā abhivaḍḍhanti, iṭṭhā kantā manāpā dhammā parihāyanti. Taṃ kissa hetu? Evañhetaṃ, bhikkhave, hoti yathā taṃ aviddasuno.

474.“Here, monks, an uninstructed ordinary person, who has not seen the noble ones, is unskilled in the noble Dhamma, untrained in the noble Dhamma; who has not seen the good people, is unskilled in the Dhamma of the good people, untrained in the Dhamma of the good people—does not know what should be cultivated and what should not be cultivated, does not know what should be associated with and what should not be associated with. Not knowing what should be cultivated and what should not be cultivated, not knowing what should be associated with and what should not be associated with, they cultivate what should not be cultivated and do not cultivate what should be cultivated, they associate with what should not be associated with and do not associate with what should be associated with. For them, cultivating what should not be cultivated and not cultivating what should be cultivated, associating with what should not be associated with and not associating with what should be associated with, unwished-for, disliked, and disagreeable qualities increase and wished-for, liked, and agreeable qualities decline. Why is that? Because that is how it is for one who is unwise.”

‘‘Sutavā ca kho, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako, ariyānaṃ dassāvī ariyadhammassa kovido ariyadhamme suvinīto, sappurisānaṃ dassāvī sappurisadhammassa kovido sappurisadhamme suvinīto, sevitabbe dhamme jānāti asevitabbe dhamme jānāti, bhajitabbe dhamme jānāti abhajitabbe dhamme jānāti. So sevitabbe dhamme jānanto asevitabbe dhamme jānanto, bhajitabbe dhamme jānanto abhajitabbe dhamme jānanto, asevitabbe dhamme na sevati sevitabbe dhamme sevati, abhajitabbe dhamme na bhajati bhajitabbe dhamme bhajati. Tassa asevitabbe dhamme asevato sevitabbe dhamme sevato, abhajitabbe dhamme abhajato bhajitabbe dhamme bhajato, aniṭṭhā akantā amanāpā dhammā parihāyanti, iṭṭhā kantā manāpā dhammā abhivaḍḍhanti. Taṃ kissa hetu? Evañhetaṃ, bhikkhave, hoti yathā taṃ viddasuno.

“Indeed, monks, a learned noble disciple, who has seen the noble ones and is skilled in the noble Dhamma, well-trained in the noble Dhamma, who has seen the good people and is skilled in the Dhamma of the good people, well-trained in the Dhamma of the good people, knows what qualities are to be cultivated and what qualities are not to be cultivated, knows what qualities are to be associated with and what qualities are not to be associated with. Knowing what qualities are to be cultivated and what qualities are not to be cultivated, knowing what qualities are to be associated with and what qualities are not to be associated with, he does not cultivate what qualities should not be cultivated and cultivates what qualities should be cultivated, he does not associate with what qualities should not be associated with and associates with what qualities should be associated with. Because he does not cultivate what qualities should not be cultivated and cultivates what qualities should be cultivated, does not associate with what qualities should not be associated with and associates with what qualities should be associated with, unwished-for, disliked, and disagreeable qualities decline, while wished-for, liked, and agreeable qualities increase. Why is that? Because, monks, that is how it is for one who is discerning.”

475. ‘‘Cattārimāni, bhikkhave, dhammasamādānāni. Katamāni cattāri? Atthi, bhikkhave, dhammasamādānaṃ paccuppannadukkhañceva āyatiñca dukkhavipākaṃ; atthi, bhikkhave, dhammasamādānaṃ paccuppannasukhaṃ āyatiṃ dukkhavipākaṃ; atthi, bhikkhave, dhammasamādānaṃ paccuppannadukkhaṃ āyatiṃ sukhavipākaṃ; atthi, bhikkhave, dhammasamādānaṃ paccuppannasukhañceva āyatiñca sukhavipākaṃ.

475.“Monks, there are these four undertakings of practices. What four? There is, monks, an undertaking of practices that is presently painful and results in future pain; there is, monks, an undertaking of practices that is presently pleasant but results in future pain; there is, monks, an undertaking of practices that is presently painful but results in future pleasure; there is, monks, an undertaking of practices that is presently pleasant and results in future pleasure.

476. ‘‘Tatra, bhikkhave, yamidaṃ [yadidaṃ (sī.)] dhammasamādānaṃ paccuppannadukkhañceva āyatiñca dukkhavipākaṃ, taṃ avidvā avijjāgato yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti – ‘idaṃ kho dhammasamādānaṃ paccuppannadukkhañceva āyatiñca dukkhavipāka’nti.

Taṃ kissa hetu? Evañhetaṃ, bhikkhave, hoti yathā taṃ aviddasuno.

476.“Here, monks, an unwise person, overcome by ignorance, does not understand as it actually is regarding that undertaking of practices which is presently painful and results in future pain: ‘This undertaking of practices is presently painful and results in future pain.’ Not understanding it as it actually is, overcome by ignorance, they pursue it and do not avoid it. As they pursue it and do not avoid it, unwished-for, disliked, and disagreeable qualities increase, while wished-for, liked, and agreeable qualities decline. Why is that? It is because that is how it is for one who is unwise.

‘‘Tatra, bhikkhave, yamidaṃ dhammasamādānaṃ paccuppannasukhaṃ āyatiṃ dukkhavipākaṃ taṃ avidvā avijjāgato yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti – ‘idaṃ kho dhammasamādānaṃ paccuppannasukhaṃ āyatiṃ dukkhavipāka’nti.

By pursuing it and not avoiding it, unwished-for, disliked, and disagreeable qualities increase, while wished-for, liked, and agreeable qualities decrease. Why is that? Because, monks, it is like that for one who is unwise.

‘‘Tatra, bhikkhave, yamidaṃ dhammasamādānaṃ paccuppannadukkhaṃ āyatiṃ sukhavipākaṃ, taṃ avidvā avijjāgato yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti – ‘idaṃ kho dhammasamādānaṃ paccuppannadukkhaṃ āyatiṃ sukhavipāka’nti.

As they do not cultivate it and avoid it, unwished-for, disliked, and disagreeable qualities grow, while wished-for, liked, and agreeable qualities decline. Why is that? It is because this is so for one who is unwise.”

477. ‘‘Tatra, bhikkhave, yamidaṃ dhammasamādānaṃ paccuppannadukkhañceva āyatiñca dukkhavipākaṃ taṃ vidvā vijjāgato yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti – ‘idaṃ kho dhammasamādānaṃ paccuppannadukkhañceva āyatiñca dukkhavipāka’nti.

477.“Here, monks, regarding that undertaking of practices which is presently painful and results in future pain, the wise and endowed with true knowledge understands it as it actually is: ‘This undertaking of practices is presently painful and results in future pain.’ Understanding it as it actually is, being wise and endowed with true knowledge, they do not cultivate it, they avoid it. By not cultivating it and avoiding it, unwished-for, disliked, and disagreeable qualities diminish, while wished-for, liked, and agreeable qualities increase. Why is that? Because, monks, that is how it is for the discerning.”

‘‘Tatra, bhikkhave, yamidaṃ dhammasamādānaṃ paccuppannasukhaṃ āyatiṃ dukkhavipākaṃ taṃ vidvā vijjāgato yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti – ‘idaṃ kho dhammasamādānaṃ paccuppannasukhaṃ āyatiṃ dukkhavipāka’nti.

“Here, bhikkhus, a wise person, endowed with knowledge, understands as it actually is that undertaking of practices which is pleasant in the present but ripens painfully in the future: ‘This undertaking of practices is pleasant in the present but ripens painfully in the future.’ Understanding it thus as it actually is, a wise person, endowed with knowledge, does not cultivate it, avoids it. As that person does not cultivate it and avoids it, undesirable, unpleasant, and disagreeable qualities decline, while desirable, pleasant, and agreeable qualities grow. Why is that? Because it is thus, bhikkhus, for one who discerns.

‘‘Tatra, bhikkhave, yamidaṃ dhammasamādānaṃ paccuppannadukkhaṃ āyatiṃ sukhavipākaṃ taṃ vidvā vijjāgato yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti – ‘idaṃ kho dhammasamādānaṃ paccuppannadukkhaṃ āyatiṃ sukhavipāka’nti.

478.“And what, bhikkhus, is the undertaking of practices which is painful in the present and ripens painfully in the future? Here, bhikkhus, some person, even while experiencing pain and distress, takes life; and because of taking life, they experience pain and distress. Even while experiencing pain and distress, they take what is not given; and because of taking what is not given, they experience pain and distress. Even while experiencing pain and distress, they engage in sexual misconduct; and because of sexual misconduct, they experience pain and distress. Even while experiencing pain and distress, they speak falsely; and because of false speech, they experience pain and distress. Even while experiencing pain and distress, they speak divisively; and because of divisive speech, they experience pain and distress. Even while experiencing pain and distress, they speak harshly; and because of harsh speech, they experience pain and distress. Even while experiencing pain and distress, they engage in idle chatter; and because of idle chatter, they experience pain and distress. Even while experiencing pain and distress, they are covetous; and because of covetousness, they experience pain and distress. Even while experiencing pain and distress, they have a mind of ill will; and because of ill will, they experience pain and distress. Even while experiencing pain and distress, they have wrong view; and because of wrong view, they experience pain and distress. Upon the breakup of the body, after death, they are reborn in a state of loss, a bad destination, the downfall, hell. This, bhikkhus, is called the undertaking of practices which is painful in the present and ripens painfully in the future.

Here, bhikkhus, some person refrains from taking life, even while experiencing pain and distress, and because of refraining from taking life, they experience pain and distress. They refrain from taking what is not given, even while experiencing pain and distress, and because of refraining from taking what is not given, they experience pain and distress.

They refrain from idle chatter, even while experiencing pain and distress, and because of refraining from idle chatter, they experience pain and distress. They are without covetousness, even while experiencing pain and distress, and because of being without covetousness, they experience pain and distress. They have a mind free from ill will, even while experiencing pain and distress, and because of having a mind free from ill will, they experience pain and distress. They have right view, even while experiencing pain and distress, and because of having right view, they experience pain and distress. Upon the breakup of the body, after death, they are reborn in a good destination, a heavenly world. This, bhikkhus, is called the undertaking of practices which is painful in the present but ripens with a pleasant result in the future.

481."And what, Bhikkhus, is the undertaking of practices that is pleasant in the present and has a pleasant result in the future? Here, Bhikkhus, some person abstains from the destruction of life, accompanied by pleasure and joy, and because of this abstention from the destruction of life, he experiences pleasure and joy. He abstains from taking what is not given, accompanied by pleasure and joy, and because of this abstention from taking what is not given, he experiences pleasure and joy. He abstains from sexual misconduct, accompanied by pleasure and joy, and because of this abstention from sexual misconduct, he experiences pleasure and joy. He abstains from false speech, accompanied by pleasure and joy, and because of this abstention from false speech, he experiences pleasure and joy. He abstains from malicious speech, accompanied by pleasure and joy, and because of this abstention from malicious speech, he experiences pleasure and joy. He abstains from harsh speech, accompanied by pleasure and joy, and because of this abstention from harsh speech, he experiences pleasure and joy. He abstains from frivolous talk, accompanied by pleasure and joy, and because of this abstention from frivolous talk, he experiences pleasure and joy. He is not covetous, accompanied by pleasure and joy, and because of not being covetous, he experiences pleasure and joy. He is without ill will, accompanied by pleasure and joy, and because of being without ill will, he experiences pleasure and joy. He has right view, accompanied by pleasure and joy, and because of having right view, he experiences pleasure and joy. With the breakup of the body, after death, he reappears in a good destination, in a heavenly world. This, Bhikkhus, is called the undertaking of practices that is pleasant in the present and has a pleasant result in the future. These, Bhikkhus, are the four undertakings of practices."

482. ‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, tittakālābu visena saṃsaṭṭho. Atha puriso āgaccheyya jīvitukāmo amaritukāmo sukhakāmo dukkhappaṭikūlo.

482."Bhikkhus, suppose there was a bitter gourd mixed with poison. Then a person would come along, desiring to live, not wishing to die, desiring happiness, averse to suffering. They would say to him: 'Good man, this bitter gourd is mixed with poison. If you wish, drink it. As you drink it, it will not please you in color, smell, or taste. But having drunk it, you will meet with death or deadly suffering.' Without reflecting, he would drink it, and not give it up. As he drinks it, it would not please him in color, smell, or taste.

483."Bhikkhus, suppose there were a cup of sweet drink, endowed with color, endowed with scent, endowed with taste. But it was mixed with poison. Then a person would come along, desiring to live, not wishing to die, longing for happiness, averse to suffering. They would say to him: 'Good man, this cup of sweet drink is endowed with color, scent, and taste. But it is mixed with poison. If you wish, drink it. As you drink it, it will gratify you with its color, scent, and taste. But having drunk it, you will meet death or deadly suffering.' Without reflecting, he would drink it and not reject it. As he drinks it, it would gratify him with its color, scent, and taste. But having drunk it, he would meet death or deadly suffering.

484."Bhikkhus, suppose there was foul urine mixed with various medicines. Then a person would come along suffering from jaundice. They would say to him: 'Good man, this foul urine is mixed with various medicines. If you wish, drink it. As you drink it, it will not please you with its color, scent, or taste. But having drunk it, you will be happy.' Reflecting carefully, he would drink it and not reject it. As he drinks it, it would not please him with its color, scent, or taste.

485."Bhikkhus, suppose curd, honey, ghee, and treacle were mixed together. Then a person would come along suffering from dysentery. They would say to him: ‘Good man, this curd, honey, ghee, and treacle are mixed together. If you wish, drink it. As you drink it, it will please you with its color, scent, and taste. And after drinking it, you’ll be happy.’ Reflecting carefully, he would drink it, and not refuse it. As he drinks it, it would please him with its color, scent, and taste. And after drinking it, he’d be happy. In the same way, Bhikkhus, I declare this undertaking of practices to be comparable to that, namely, the undertaking of practices that is pleasant in the present and has a pleasant result in the future."

486. ‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, vassānaṃ pacchime māse saradasamaye viddhe vigatavalāhake deve ādicco nabhaṃ abbhussakkamāno sabbaṃ ākāsagataṃ tamagataṃ abhivihacca bhāsate ca tapate ca virocate ca; evameva kho, bhikkhave, yamidaṃ dhammasamādānaṃ paccuppannasukhañceva āyatiñca sukhavipākaṃ tadaññe puthusamaṇabrāhmaṇaparappavāde abhivihacca bhāsate ca tapate ca virocate cā’’ti.

486."Bhikkhus, just as in the last month of the rainy season, in autumn, when the sky is clear and free of clouds, the sun, rising in the sky, having overcome all darkness in the sky, shines, blazes, and glows; even so, Bhikkhus, this undertaking of practices that is pleasant in the present and has a pleasant result in the future, having overcome the doctrines of other ascetics and brahmins, shines, blazes, and glows."

Idamavoca bhagavā. Attamanā te bhikkhū bhagavato bhāsitaṃ abhinandunti.

This the Blessed One said. Those Bhikkhus were pleased and rejoiced at the Blessed One's words.

Mahādhammasamādānasuttaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ chaṭṭhaṃ.
