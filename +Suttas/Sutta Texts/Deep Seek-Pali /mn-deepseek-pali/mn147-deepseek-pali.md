# 147. Mahāsaḷāyatanikasuttaṃ

## 147. The Great Discourse on the Six Sense Bases

428. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘bhikkhavo’’ti. ‘‘Bhadante’’ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca – ‘‘mahāsaḷāyatanikaṃ vo, bhikkhave, desessāmi. Taṃ suṇātha, sādhukaṃ manasi karotha; bhāsissāmī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti kho te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca –

428.Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” “Venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this: “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the Great Sixfold Base. Listen to it, attend closely, and I will speak.” “Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One then said this:

429. ‘‘Cakkhuṃ, bhikkhave, ajānaṃ apassaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, rūpe ajānaṃ apassaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, cakkhuviññāṇaṃ ajānaṃ apassaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, cakkhusamphassaṃ ajānaṃ apassaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, yamidaṃ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi ajānaṃ apassaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, cakkhusmiṃ sārajjati, rūpesu sārajjati, cakkhuviññāṇe sārajjati, cakkhusamphasse sārajjati, yamidaṃ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tasmimpi sārajjati.

429.“Bhikkhus, not knowing and not seeing the eye as it really is, not knowing and not seeing forms as they really are, not knowing and not seeing eye-consciousness as it really is, not knowing and not seeing eye-contact as it really is, not knowing and not seeing whatever feeling arises conditioned by eye-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant—as it really is, one is impassioned by the eye, impassioned by forms, impassioned by eye-consciousness, impassioned by eye-contact, impassioned by whatever feeling arises conditioned by eye-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant.

‘‘Tassa sārattassa saṃyuttassa sammūḷhassa assādānupassino viharato āyatiṃ pañcupādānakkhandhā upacayaṃ gacchanti. Taṇhā cassa ponobbhavikā nandīrāgasahagatā tatratatrābhinandinī, sā cassa pavaḍḍhati.

So kāyadukkhampi [kāyikadukkhampi (syā. kaṃ.), kāyikaṃ dukkhampi (ka.)] cetodukkhampi paṭisaṃvedeti.

For one who is impassioned, fettered, and deluded, dwelling contemplating gratification, the five aggregates subject to clinging accumulate for the future. And their craving, which leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, finding delight here and there, increases. Their bodily distresses increase, and their mental distresses increase; their bodily torments increase, and their mental torments increase; their bodily fevers increase, and their mental fevers increase. They experience both bodily suffering and mental suffering.”

‘‘Sotaṃ, bhikkhave, ajānaṃ apassaṃ yathābhūtaṃ…pe… ghānaṃ, bhikkhave, ajānaṃ apassaṃ yathābhūtaṃ…pe… jivhaṃ, bhikkhave, ajānaṃ apassaṃ yathābhūtaṃ…pe… kāyaṃ, bhikkhave, ajānaṃ apassaṃ yathābhūtaṃ…pe… manaṃ, bhikkhave, ajānaṃ apassaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, dhamme, bhikkhave, ajānaṃ apassaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, manoviññāṇaṃ, bhikkhave, ajānaṃ apassaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, manosamphassaṃ, bhikkhave, ajānaṃ apassaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, yamidaṃ manosamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi ajānaṃ apassaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, manasmiṃ sārajjati, dhammesu sārajjati, manoviññāṇe sārajjati, manosamphasse sārajjati, yamidaṃ manosamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tasmimpi sārajjati.

“Bhikkhus, not knowing and not seeing the ear as it really is, not knowing and not seeing sounds as they really are, not knowing and not seeing ear-consciousness as it really is, not knowing and not seeing ear-contact as it really is, not knowing and not seeing whatever feeling arises conditioned by ear-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant—as it really is; not knowing and not seeing the nose as it really is, not knowing and not seeing odours as they really are, not knowing and not seeing nose-consciousness as it really is, not knowing and not seeing nose-contact as it really is, not knowing and not seeing whatever feeling arises conditioned by nose-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant—as it really is; not knowing and not seeing the tongue as it really is, not knowing and not seeing tastes as they really are, not knowing and not seeing tongue-consciousness as it really is, not knowing and not seeing tongue-contact as it really is, not knowing and not seeing whatever feeling arises conditioned by tongue-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant—as it really is; not knowing and not seeing the body as it really is, not knowing and not seeing tactile objects as they really are, not knowing and not seeing body-consciousness as it really is, not knowing and not seeing body-contact as it really is, not knowing and not seeing whatever feeling arises conditioned by body-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant—as it really is; not knowing and not seeing the mind as it really is, not knowing and not seeing mental phenomena as they really are, not knowing and not seeing mind-consciousness as it really is, not knowing and not seeing mind-contact as it really is, not knowing and not seeing whatever feeling arises conditioned by mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant—as it really is, one is impassioned by the mind, impassioned by mental phenomena, impassioned by mind-consciousness, impassioned by mind-contact, impassioned by whatever feeling arises conditioned by mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant.

Their bodily distresses increase, and their mental distresses increase; their bodily torments increase, and their mental torments increase; their bodily fevers increase, and their mental fevers increase.

430. ‘‘Cakkhuñca kho, bhikkhave, jānaṃ passaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, rūpe jānaṃ passaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, cakkhuviññāṇaṃ jānaṃ passaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, cakkhusamphassaṃ jānaṃ passaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, yamidaṃ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi jānaṃ passaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, cakkhusmiṃ na sārajjati, rūpesu na sārajjati, cakkhuviññāṇe na sārajjati, cakkhusamphasse na sārajjati, yamidaṃ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tasmimpi na sārajjati.

So kāyasukhampi cetosukhampi paṭisaṃvedeti.

For one who is unimpassioned, unfettered, and undeluded, dwelling contemplating danger, the five aggregates subject to clinging diminish for the future. And their craving, which leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, finding delight here and there, is abandoned. Their bodily distresses are abandoned, their mental distresses are abandoned; their bodily torments are abandoned, their mental torments are abandoned; their bodily fevers are abandoned, their mental fevers are abandoned. They experience bodily happiness and mental happiness.”

431. ‘‘Yā tathābhūtassa [yathābhūtassa (sī. pī.)] diṭṭhi sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi; yo tathābhūtassa [yathābhūtassa (sī. pī.)] saṅkappo svāssa hoti sammāsaṅkappo; yo tathābhūtassa [yathābhūtassa (sī. pī.)] vāyāmo svāssa hoti sammāvāyāmo; yā tathābhūtassa [yathābhūtassa (sī. pī.)] sati sāssa hoti sammāsati; yo tathābhūtassa [yathābhūtassa (sī. pī.)] samādhi svāssa hoti sammāsamādhi. Pubbeva kho panassa kāyakammaṃ vacīkammaṃ ājīvo suparisuddho hoti. Evamassāyaṃ ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gacchati.

431.For such a one, his view is right view; his thought is right thought; his effort is right effort; his mindfulness is right mindfulness; his concentration is right concentration. But earlier, his bodily action, verbal action, and livelihood were already perfectly purified. In this way, his Noble Eightfold Path goes to the fulfillment of development.”

‘‘Tassa evaṃ imaṃ ariyaṃ aṭṭhaṅgikaṃ maggaṃ bhāvayato cattāropi satipaṭṭhānā bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gacchanti, cattāropi sammappadhānā bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gacchanti, cattāropi iddhipādā bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gacchanti, pañcapi indriyāni bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gacchanti, pañcapi balāni bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gacchanti, sattapi bojjhaṅgā bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gacchanti.

“When he thus develops this Noble Eightfold Path, the four foundations of mindfulness go to the fulfillment of development, the four right exertions go to the fulfillment of development, the four bases of spiritual power go to the fulfillment of development, the five faculties go to the fulfillment of development, the five powers go to the fulfillment of development, and the seven factors of enlightenment go to the fulfillment of development.

‘‘Tassime dve dhammā yuganandhā [yuganaddhā (sī. syā. kaṃ.)] vattanti – samatho ca vipassanā ca. So ye dhammā abhiññā pariññeyyā te dhamme abhiññā parijānāti. Ye dhammā abhiññā pahātabbā te dhamme abhiññā pajahati. Ye dhammā abhiññā bhāvetabbā te dhamme abhiññā bhāveti. Ye dhammā abhiññā sacchikātabbā te dhamme abhiññā sacchikaroti.

For him, these two qualities proceed in tandem—serenity and insight. He fully understands by direct knowledge those qualities that should be fully understood. He fully abandons by direct knowledge those qualities that should be fully abandoned. He fully develops by direct knowledge those qualities that should be fully developed. He fully realizes by direct knowledge those qualities that should be fully realized.

‘‘Katame ca, bhikkhave, dhammā abhiññā pariññeyyā? ‘Pañcupādānakkhandhā’ tissa vacanīyaṃ, seyyathidaṃ – rūpupādānakkhandho, vedanupādānakkhandho, saññupādānakkhandho, saṅkhārupādānakkhandho, viññāṇupādānakkhandho. Ime dhammā abhiññā pariññeyyā.

And what, bhikkhus, are the qualities that should be fully understood by direct knowledge? It should be said: ‘The five aggregates subject to clinging,’ namely, the form aggregate subject to clinging, the feeling aggregate subject to clinging, the perception aggregate subject to clinging, the volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging, the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging. These are the qualities that should be fully understood by direct knowledge.

‘‘Katame ca, bhikkhave, dhammā abhiññā pahātabbā? Avijjā ca bhavataṇhā ca – ime dhammā abhiññā pahātabbā.

And what, bhikkhus, are the qualities that should be abandoned by direct knowledge? Ignorance and craving for existence—these are the qualities that should be abandoned by direct knowledge.”

‘‘Katame ca, bhikkhave, dhammā abhiññā bhāvetabbā? Samatho ca vipassanā ca – ime dhammā abhiññā bhāvetabbā.

“And what, bhikkhus, are the qualities that should be developed by direct knowledge? Serenity and insight—these are the qualities that should be developed by direct knowledge.”

‘‘Katame, bhikkhave, dhammā abhiññā sacchikātabbā? Vijjā ca vimutti ca – ime dhammā abhiññā sacchikātabbā.

“And what, bhikkhus, are the qualities that should be realized by direct knowledge? True knowledge and liberation—these are the qualities that should be realized by direct knowledge.”

432. ‘‘Sotaṃ, bhikkhave, jānaṃ passaṃ yathābhūtaṃ…pe… ghānaṃ bhikkhave, jānaṃ passaṃ yathābhūtaṃ…pe… jivhaṃ, bhikkhave, jānaṃ passaṃ yathābhūtaṃ… kāyaṃ, bhikkhave, jānaṃ passaṃ yathābhūtaṃ… manaṃ, bhikkhave, jānaṃ passaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, dhamme jānaṃ passaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, manoviññāṇaṃ jānaṃ passaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, manosamphassaṃ jānaṃ passaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, yamidaṃ manosamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi jānaṃ passaṃ yathābhūtaṃ, manasmiṃ na sārajjati, dhammesu na sārajjati, manoviññāṇe na sārajjati, manosamphasse na sārajjati, yamidaṃ manosamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tasmimpi na sārajjati.

432.“Bhikkhus, knowing and seeing the ear as it really is, knowing and seeing sounds as they really are, knowing and seeing ear-consciousness as it really is, knowing and seeing ear-contact as it really is, and knowing and seeing whatever feeling arises conditioned by ear-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant—as it really is; knowing and seeing the nose as it really is, knowing and seeing odours as they really are, knowing and seeing nose-consciousness as it really is, knowing and seeing nose-contact as it really is, and knowing and seeing whatever feeling arises conditioned by nose-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant—as it really is; knowing and seeing the tongue as it really is, knowing and seeing tastes as they really are, knowing and seeing tongue-consciousness as it really is, knowing and seeing tongue-contact as it really is, and knowing and seeing whatever feeling arises conditioned by tongue-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant—as it really is; knowing and seeing the body as it really is, knowing and seeing tactile objects as they really are, knowing and seeing body-consciousness as it really is, knowing and seeing body-contact as it really is, and knowing and seeing whatever feeling arises conditioned by body-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant—as it really is; knowing and seeing the mind as it really is, knowing and seeing mental phenomena as they really are, knowing and seeing mind-consciousness as it really is, knowing and seeing mind-contact as it really is, and knowing and seeing whatever feeling arises conditioned by mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant—as it really is, one is not impassioned by the mind, is not impassioned by mental phenomena, is not impassioned by mind-consciousness, is not impassioned by mind-contact, and is not impassioned by whatever feeling arises conditioned by mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant.

‘‘Tassa asārattassa asaṃyuttassa asammūḷhassa ādīnavānupassino viharato āyatiṃ pañcupādānakkhandhā apacayaṃ gacchanti. Taṇhā cassa ponobbhavikā nandīrāgasahagatā tatratatrābhinandinī, sā cassa pahīyati. Tassa kāyikāpi darathā pahīyanti, cetasikāpi darathā pahīyanti; kāyikāpi santāpā pahīyanti, cetasikāpi santāpā pahīyanti; kāyikāpi pariḷāhā pahīyanti, cetasikāpi pariḷāhā pahīyanti. So kāyasukhampi cetosukhampi paṭisaṃvedeti.

For one who is unattached, unentangled, unconfused, dwelling contemplating the danger, the five aggregates subject to clinging diminish in the future. And that craving of his—which leads to renewed existence, is accompanied by delight and attachment, and finds delight here and there—is abandoned in him. His bodily distresses are abandoned, and his mental distresses are abandoned; his bodily torments are abandoned, and his mental torments are abandoned; his bodily feverishness is abandoned, and his mental feverishness is abandoned. He experiences both bodily pleasure and mental pleasure.

433. ‘‘Yā tathābhūtassa diṭṭhi sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi; yo tathābhūtassa saṅkappo svāssa hoti sammāsaṅkappo; yo tathābhūtassa vāyāmo svāssa hoti sammāvāyāmo; yā tathābhūtassa sati sāssa hoti sammāsati; yo tathābhūtassa samādhi svāssa hoti sammāsamādhi. Pubbeva kho panassa kāyakammaṃ vacīkammaṃ ājīvo suparisuddho hoti. Evamassāyaṃ ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gacchati.

433.The view of one who is such becomes his right view; the intention of one who is such becomes his right intention; the effort of one who is such becomes his right effort; the mindfulness of one who is such becomes his right mindfulness; the concentration of one who is such becomes his right concentration. Prior to that, his bodily action, verbal action, and livelihood are thoroughly purified. Thus, this Noble Eightfold Path of his attains full development through cultivation.

‘‘Tassa evaṃ imaṃ ariyaṃ aṭṭhaṅgikaṃ maggaṃ bhāvayato cattāropi satipaṭṭhānā bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gacchanti, cattāropi sammappadhānā bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gacchanti, cattāropi iddhipādā bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gacchanti, pañcapi indriyāni bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gacchanti, pañcapi balāni bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gacchanti, sattapi bojjhaṅgā bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gacchanti.

As he develops this Noble Eightfold Path in this way, the four foundations of mindfulness attain full development through cultivation, the four right efforts attain full development through cultivation, the four bases of spiritual power attain full development through cultivation, the five faculties attain full development through cultivation, the five powers attain full development through cultivation, and the seven factors of enlightenment attain full development through cultivation.

‘‘Tassime dve dhammā yuganandhā vattanti – samatho ca vipassanā ca. So ye dhammā abhiññā pariññeyyā te dhamme abhiññā parijānāti. Ye dhammā abhiññā pahātabbā te dhamme abhiññā pajahati. Ye dhammā abhiññā bhāvetabbā te dhamme abhiññā bhāveti. Ye dhammā abhiññā sacchikātabbā te dhamme abhiññā sacchikaroti.

These two qualities, serenity and insight, proceed in him yoked together. He fully knows by direct knowledge those things that should be fully known by direct knowledge. He fully abandons by direct knowledge those things that should be fully abandoned by direct knowledge. He fully develops by direct knowledge those things that should be fully developed by direct knowledge. He fully realizes by direct knowledge those things that should be fully realized by direct knowledge.

‘‘Katame ca, bhikkhave, dhammā abhiññā pariññeyyā? ‘Pañcupādānakkhandhā’ tissa vacanīyaṃ, seyyathidaṃ – rūpupādānakkhandho, vedanupādānakkhandho, saññupādānakkhandho, saṅkhārupādānakkhandho, viññāṇupādānakkhandho. Ime dhammā abhiññā pariññeyyā.

And what, bhikkhus, are the things that should be fully understood by direct knowledge? It should be said: ‘The five aggregates subject to clinging,’ namely, the form aggregate subject to clinging, the feeling aggregate subject to clinging, the perception aggregate subject to clinging, the mental formations aggregate subject to clinging, the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging. These are the things that should be fully understood by direct knowledge.

‘‘Katame ca, bhikkhave, dhammā abhiññā pahātabbā? Avijjā ca bhavataṇhā ca – ime dhammā abhiññā pahātabbā.

And what, bhikkhus, are the things that should be abandoned by direct knowledge? Ignorance and craving for existence. These are the things that should be abandoned by direct knowledge.

‘‘Katame ca, bhikkhave, dhammā abhiññā bhāvetabbā? Samatho ca vipassanā ca – ime dhammā abhiññā bhāvetabbā.

And what, bhikkhus, are the qualities that should be developed by direct knowledge? Serenity and insight. These are the qualities that should be developed by direct knowledge.

‘‘Katame ca, bhikkhave, dhammā abhiññā sacchikātabbā? Vijjā ca vimutti ca – ime dhammā abhiññā sacchikātabbā’’ti.

And what, bhikkhus, are the things that should be realized by direct knowledge? Knowledge and liberation. These are the things that should be realized by direct knowledge.

Idamavoca bhagavā. Attamanā te bhikkhū bhagavato bhāsitaṃ abhinandunti.

That is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were pleased and delighted with the Blessed One’s words.

Mahāsaḷāyatanikasuttaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ sattamaṃ.

The Great Sixfold Base Discourse, the seventh, is concluded.
