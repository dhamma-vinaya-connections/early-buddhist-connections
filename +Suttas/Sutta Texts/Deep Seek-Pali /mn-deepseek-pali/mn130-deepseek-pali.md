## 130. The Discourse on the Fortunate One

272. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘bhikkhavo’’ti. ‘‘Bhadante’’ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca – ‘‘bhaddekarattassa vo, bhikkhave, uddesañca vibhaṅgañca desessāmi. Taṃ suṇātha, sādhukaṃ manasi karotha; bhāsissāmī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti kho te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca –

272.Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Monastery. There the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks!” “Venerable sir!” those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this: “Monks, I will teach you the summary and exposition of the Fortunate One. Listen to it, attend carefully, I shall speak.” “Yes, venerable sir,” those monks replied to the Blessed One. He said this:

‘‘Atītaṃ nānvāgameyya, nappaṭikaṅkhe anāgataṃ;Yadatītaṃ pahīnaṃ taṃ, appattañca anāgataṃ.

One should not pursue the past,Nor expect the future.What is past has been abandoned,The future has not been reached.

‘‘Paccuppannañca yo [yaṃ (nettipāḷi)] dhammaṃ, tattha tattha vipassati;Asaṃhīraṃ [asaṃhiraṃ (syā. kaṃ. ka.)] asaṃkuppaṃ, taṃ vidvā manubrūhaye.

One who discerns the present phenomenon, in each and every instance, unwavering, unshakeable—that, a wise one should cultivate.

‘‘Ajjeva kiccamātappaṃ [kiccaṃ ātappaṃ (sī. ka.)], ko jaññā maraṇaṃ suve;Na hi no saṅgaraṃ tena, mahāsenena maccunā.

Today the ardent effort must be made,Who knows if death will come tomorrow?For there is no bargaining with that great army, Death.

‘‘Evaṃ vihāriṃ ātāpiṃ, ahorattamatanditaṃ;Taṃ ve bhaddekarattoti, santo ācikkhate muni’’ [munīti (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)].

One who dwells thus, ardent, tirelessly day and night—that one, truly, the peaceful sage declares to be the Fortunate One.

273. ‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, atītaṃ anvāgameti? ‘Evaṃrūpo ahosiṃ atītamaddhāna’nti tattha nandiṃ samanvāneti, ‘evaṃvedano ahosiṃ atītamaddhāna’nti tattha nandiṃ samanvāneti, ‘evaṃsañño ahosiṃ atītamaddhāna’nti tattha nandiṃ samanvāneti, ‘evaṃsaṅkhāro ahosiṃ atītamaddhāna’nti tattha nandiṃ samanvāneti, ‘evaṃviññāṇo ahosiṃ atītamaddhāna’nti tattha nandiṃ samanvāneti – evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, atītaṃ anvāgameti.

273.“And how, monks, does one pursue the past? Thinking, ‘I was of such a form in the past,’ one delights in it. Thinking, ‘I was of such a feeling in the past,’ one delights in it. Thinking, ‘I was of such a perception in the past,’ one delights in it. Thinking, ‘I was of such volitional formations in the past,’ one delights in it. Thinking, ‘I was of such a consciousness in the past,’ one delights in it. This is how, monks, one pursues the past.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, atītaṃ nānvāgameti? ‘Evaṃrūpo ahosiṃ atītamaddhāna’nti tattha nandiṃ na samanvāneti, ‘evaṃvedano ahosiṃ atītamaddhāna’nti tattha nandiṃ na samanvāneti, ‘evaṃsañño ahosiṃ atītamaddhāna’nti tattha nandiṃ na samanvāneti, ‘evaṃsaṅkhāro ahosiṃ atītamaddhāna’nti tattha nandiṃ na samanvāneti, ‘evaṃviññāṇo ahosiṃ atītamaddhāna’nti tattha nandiṃ na samanvāneti – evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, atītaṃ nānvāgameti.

“And how, monks, does one not pursue the past? One does not delight in it, thinking, ‘I was of such a form in the past.’ One does not delight in it, thinking, ‘I was of such a feeling in the past.’ One does not delight in it, thinking, ‘I was of such a perception in the past.’ One does not delight in it, thinking, ‘I was of such volitional formations in the past.’ One does not delight in it, thinking, ‘I was of such a consciousness in the past.’ That’s how one does not pursue the past.”

274. ‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, anāgataṃ paṭikaṅkhati? ‘Evaṃrūpo siyaṃ anāgatamaddhāna’nti tattha nandiṃ samanvāneti, evaṃvedano siyaṃ…pe… evaṃsañño siyaṃ… evaṃsaṅkhāro siyaṃ… evaṃviññāṇo siyaṃ anāgatamaddhānanti tattha nandiṃ samanvāneti – evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, anāgataṃ paṭikaṅkhati.

274.“And how, monks, does one expect the future? One delights in it, thinking, ‘May I be of such a form in the future.’ One delights in it, thinking, ‘May I be of such a feeling in the future.’ One delights in it, thinking, ‘May I be of such a perception in the future.’ One delights in it, thinking, ‘May I be of such volitional formations in the future.’ One delights in it, thinking, ‘May I be of such a consciousness in the future.’ This is how, monks, one expects the future.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, anāgataṃ nappaṭikaṅkhati? ‘Evaṃrūpo siyaṃ anāgatamaddhāna’nti tattha nandiṃ na samanvāneti, evaṃvedano siyaṃ … evaṃsañño siyaṃ… evaṃsaṅkhāro siyaṃ… ‘evaṃviññāṇo siyaṃ anāgatamaddhāna’nti tattha nandiṃ na samanvāneti – evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, anāgataṃ nappaṭikaṅkhati.

“And how, monks, does one not expect the future? One does not delight in it, thinking, ‘May I be of such a form in the future.’ One does not delight in it, thinking, ‘May I be of such a feeling in the future.’ One does not delight in it, thinking, ‘May I be of such a perception in the future.’ One does not delight in it, thinking, ‘May I be of such volitional formations in the future.’ One does not delight in it, thinking, ‘May I be of such a consciousness in the future.’ This is how, monks, one does not expect the future.”

275. ‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, paccuppannesu dhammesu saṃhīrati? Idha, bhikkhave, assutavā puthujjano ariyānaṃ adassāvī ariyadhammassa akovido ariyadhamme avinīto sappurisānaṃ adassāvī sappurisadhammassa akovido sappurisadhamme avinīto rūpaṃ attato samanupassati, rūpavantaṃ vā attānaṃ, attani vā rūpaṃ, rūpasmiṃ vā attānaṃ; vedanaṃ…pe… saññaṃ… saṅkhāre… viññāṇaṃ attato samanupassati, viññāṇavantaṃ vā attānaṃ attani vā viññāṇaṃ, viññāṇasmiṃ vā attānaṃ – evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, paccuppannesu dhammesu saṃhīrati.

275.“And how, monks, is one shaken regarding present phenomena? Here, an uninstructed ordinary person—who has not seen the noble ones, is unskilled in the noble Dhamma, untrained in the noble Dhamma; who has not seen the good people, is unskilled in the Dhamma of the good people, untrained in the Dhamma of the good people—regards form as self, or self as having form, or form as in self, or self as in form. They regard feeling as self, or self as having feeling, or feeling as in self, or self as in feeling. They regard perception as self, or self as having perception, or perception as in self, or self as in perception. They regard volitional formations as self, or self as having volitional formations, or volitional formations as in self, or self as in volitional formations. They regard consciousness as self, or self as having consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. This is how, monks, one is shaken regarding present phenomena.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, paccuppannesu dhammesu na saṃhīrati? Idha, bhikkhave, sutavā ariyasāvako ariyānaṃ dassāvī ariyadhammassa kovido ariyadhamme suvinīto sappurisānaṃ dassāvī sappurisadhammassa kovido sappurisadhamme suvinīto na rūpaṃ attato samanupassati, na rūpavantaṃ vā attānaṃ, na attani vā rūpaṃ, na rūpasmiṃ vā attānaṃ; na vedanaṃ… na saññaṃ… na saṅkhāre… na viññāṇaṃ attato samanupassati, na viññāṇavantaṃ vā attānaṃ, na attani vā viññāṇaṃ, na viññāṇasmiṃ vā attānaṃ – evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, paccuppannesu dhammesu na saṃhīrati.

“And how, monks, is one not shaken with regard to present phenomena? Here, an instructed noble disciple—who has seen the noble ones, is skilled in the noble Dhamma, well-trained in the noble Dhamma; who has seen the good people, is skilled in the Dhamma of the good people, well-trained in the Dhamma of the good people—does not regard form as self, or self as having form, or form as in self, or self as in form; nor feeling as self, or self as having feeling, or feeling as in self, or self as in feeling; nor perception as self, or self as having perception, or perception as in self, or self as in perception; nor volitional formations as self, or self as having volitional formations, or volitional formations as in self, or self as in volitional formations; nor consciousness as self, or self as having consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. This is how, monks, one is not shaken with regard to present phenomena.”

‘‘Atītaṃ nānvāgameyya, nappaṭikaṅkhe anāgataṃ;Yadatītaṃ pahīnaṃ taṃ, appattañca anāgataṃ.

One should not pursue the past,Nor expect the future.What is past has been abandoned,The future has not been reached.

‘‘Paccuppannañca yo dhammaṃ, tattha tattha vipassati;Asaṃhīraṃ asaṃkuppaṃ, taṃ vidvā manubrūhaye.

One who discerns the present phenomenon, in each and every instance, unwavering, unshakeable—that, a wise one should cultivate.

‘‘Ajjeva kiccamātappaṃ, ko jaññā maraṇaṃ suve;Na hi no saṅgaraṃ tena, mahāsenena maccunā.

Today the ardent effort must be made,Who knows if death will come tomorrow?For there is no bargaining with that great army, Death.

‘‘Evaṃ vihāriṃ ātāpiṃ, ahorattamatanditaṃ;Taṃ ve bhaddekarattoti, santo ācikkhate munī’’ti.

One who dwells thus, ardent, tirelessly day and night—that one, truly, the peaceful sage declares to be the Fortunate One.

‘‘‘Bhaddekarattassa vo, bhikkhave, uddesañca vibhaṅgañca desessāmī’ti – iti yaṃ taṃ vuttaṃ idametaṃ paṭicca vutta’’nti.

“‘Monks, I will teach you the summary and exposition of the Fortunate One’—this is what was said in reference to that.”

Idamavoca bhagavā. Attamanā te bhikkhū bhagavato bhāsitaṃ abhinandunti.

The Blessed One said this. The monks, delighted, rejoiced at the Blessed One's words.

Bhaddekarattasuttaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ paṭhamaṃ.

The Discourse on the Fortunate One is concluded, the first.
