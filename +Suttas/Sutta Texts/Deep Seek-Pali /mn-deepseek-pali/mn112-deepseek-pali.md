## 112. The Discourse on the Good Person

105. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘bhikkhavo’’ti. ‘‘Bhadante’’ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca – ‘‘sappurisadhammañca vo, bhikkhave, desessāmi asappurisadhammañca. Taṃ suṇātha, sādhukaṃ manasi karotha; bhāsissāmī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti kho te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca –

105.Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Monastery. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!” “Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this: “I will teach you, bhikkhus, the qualities of a good person and the qualities of a bad person. Listen to it and attend carefully, I will speak.” “Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

‘‘Katamo ca, bhikkhave, asappurisadhammo? Idha, bhikkhave, asappuriso uccākulā pabbajito hoti. So iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘ahaṃ khomhi uccākulā pabbajito, ime panaññe bhikkhū na uccākulā pabbajitā’ti. So tāya uccākulīnatāya attānukkaṃseti, paraṃ vambheti. Ayaṃ [ayampi (sī. pī.)], bhikkhave, asappurisadhammo. Sappuriso ca kho, bhikkhave, iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘na kho uccākulīnatāya lobhadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, dosadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, mohadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti. No cepi uccākulā pabbajito hoti; so ca hoti dhammānudhammappaṭipanno sāmīcippaṭipanno anudhammacārī, so tattha pujjo, so tattha pāsaṃso’ti. So paṭipadaṃyeva antaraṃ karitvā tāya uccākulīnatāya nevattānukkaṃseti na paraṃ vambheti. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, sappurisadhammo.

“And what, bhikkhus, are the qualities of a bad person? Here, bhikkhus, a bad person has gone forth from a high clan. He reflects thus: ‘I have gone forth from a high clan, but these other bhikkhus have not gone forth from a high clan.’ Because of his high birth, he exalts himself and disparages others. This, bhikkhus, is a quality of a bad person. But a good person, bhikkhus, reflects thus: ‘It is not by high birth that states of greed come to an end, nor states of hatred, nor states of delusion. Even if he has not gone forth from a high clan, if he is one who practices in accordance with the Dhamma, practices properly, and lives in conformity with the Dhamma, he is worthy of veneration there, he is worthy of praise there.’ So, making practice itself the criterion, he neither exalts himself nor disparages others because of his high birth. This, bhikkhus, is a quality of a good person.”

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, asappuriso mahākulā pabbajito hoti…pe… [yathā uccākulavāre tathā vitthāretabbaṃ] mahābhogakulā pabbajito hoti…pe… uḷārabhogakulā pabbajito hoti. So iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘ahaṃ khomhi uḷārabhogakulā pabbajito, ime panaññe bhikkhū na uḷārabhogakulā pabbajitā’ti. So tāya uḷārabhogatāya attānukkaṃseti, paraṃ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, asappurisadhammo. Sappuriso ca kho, bhikkhave, iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘na kho uḷārabhogatāya lobhadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, dosadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, mohadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti. No cepi uḷārabhogakulā pabbajito hoti; so ca hoti dhammānudhammappaṭipanno sāmīcippaṭipanno anudhammacārī, so tattha pujjo, so tattha pāsaṃso’ti. So paṭipadaṃyeva antaraṃ karitvā tāya uḷārabhogatāya nevattānukkaṃseti, na paraṃ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, sappurisadhammo.

“Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bad person has gone forth from a great clan… from a clan with great possessions… from a clan with abundant possessions. He reflects thus: ‘I have gone forth from a clan with abundant possessions, but these other bhikkhus have not gone forth from clans with abundant possessions.’ Because of his abundant possessions, he exalts himself and disparages others. This too, bhikkhus, is a quality of a bad person. But a good person, bhikkhus, reflects thus: ‘It is not by abundant possessions that states of greed come to an end, nor states of hatred, nor states of delusion. Even if he has not gone forth from a clan with abundant possessions, if he is one who practices in accordance with the Dhamma, practices properly, and lives in conformity with the Dhamma, he is worthy of veneration there, he is worthy of praise there.’ So, making practice itself the criterion, he neither exalts himself nor disparages others because of his abundant possessions. This too, bhikkhus, is a quality of a good person.”

106. ‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, asappuriso ñāto hoti yasassī. So iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘ahaṃ khomhi ñāto yasassī, ime panaññe bhikkhū appaññātā appesakkhā’ti. So tena ñattena [ñātena (sī. ka.), ñātattena (syā. kaṃ. pī.)] attānukkaṃseti, paraṃ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, asappurisadhammo. Sappuriso ca kho, bhikkhave, iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘na kho ñattena lobhadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, dosadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, mohadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti. No cepi ñāto hoti yasassī; so ca hoti dhammānudhammappaṭipanno sāmīcippaṭipanno anudhammacārī, so tattha pujjo, so tattha pāsaṃso’ti. So paṭipadaṃyeva antaraṃ karitvā tena ñattena nevattānukkaṃseti, na paraṃ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, sappurisadhammo.

106.“Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bad person is well-known and influential. He reflects thus: ‘I am well-known and influential, but these other bhikkhus are unknown and without influence.’ So he exalts himself because of his being well-known and influential and disparages others. This, too, bhikkhus, is a quality of a bad person. But a good person, bhikkhus, reflects thus: ‘It is not by being well-known and influential that states of greed come to an end, nor states of hatred, nor states of delusion. Even if he is not well-known and influential, if he is one who practices in accordance with the Dhamma, practices properly, and lives in conformity with the Dhamma, he is worthy of veneration there, he is worthy of praise there.’ So, making practice itself the criterion, he neither exalts himself nor disparages others because of his being well-known and influential. This, too, bhikkhus, is a quality of a good person.”

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, asappuriso lābhī hoti cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhārānaṃ. So iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘ahaṃ khomhi lābhī cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhārānaṃ, ime panaññe bhikkhū na lābhino cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhārāna’nti. So tena lābhena attānukkaṃseti, paraṃ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, asappurisadhammo. Sappuriso ca kho, bhikkhave, iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘na kho lābhena lobhadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, dosadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, mohadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti. No cepi lābhī hoti cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhārānaṃ; so ca hoti dhammānudhammappaṭipanno sāmīcippaṭipanno anudhammacārī, so tattha pujjo, so tattha pāsaṃso’ti. So paṭipadaṃyeva antaraṃ karitvā tena lābhena nevattānukkaṃseti, na paraṃ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, sappurisadhammo.

“Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bad person obtains robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites for the sick. He reflects thus: ‘I obtain robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites for the sick, but these other bhikkhus do not obtain robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites for the sick.’ Because of that acquisition, he exalts himself and disparages others. This, too, bhikkhus, is a quality of a bad person. But a good person, bhikkhus, reflects thus: ‘It is not by acquisition that states of greed come to an end, nor states of hatred, nor states of delusion. Even if he does not obtain robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites for the sick, if he is one who practices in accordance with the Dhamma, practices properly, and lives in conformity with the Dhamma, he is worthy of veneration there, he is worthy of praise there.’ So, making practice itself the criterion, he neither exalts himself nor disparages others because of that acquisition. This, too, bhikkhus, is a quality of a good person.”

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, asappuriso bahussuto hoti. So iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘ahaṃ khomhi bahussuto, ime panaññe bhikkhū na bahussutā’ti. So tena bāhusaccena attānukkaṃseti, paraṃ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, asappurisadhammo. Sappuriso ca kho, bhikkhave, iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘na kho bāhusaccena lobhadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, dosadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, mohadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti. No cepi bahussuto hoti; so ca hoti dhammānudhammappaṭipanno sāmīcippaṭipanno anudhammacārī, so tattha pujjo, so tattha pāsaṃso’ti. So paṭipadaṃyeva antaraṃ karitvā tena bāhusaccena nevattānukkaṃseti, na paraṃ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, sappurisadhammo.

“Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bad person is much learned. He reflects thus: ‘I am much learned, but these other bhikkhus are not much learned.’ Because of his much learning, he exalts himself and disparages others. This too, bhikkhus, is a quality of a bad person. But a good person, bhikkhus, reflects thus: ‘It is not by much learning that states of greed come to an end, nor states of hatred, nor states of delusion. Even if he is not much learned, if he is one who practices in accordance with the Dhamma, practices properly, and lives in conformity with the Dhamma, he is worthy of veneration there, he is worthy of praise there.’ So, making practice itself the criterion, he neither exalts himself nor disparages others because of his much learning. This too, bhikkhus, is a quality of a good person.”

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, asappuriso vinayadharo hoti. So iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘ahaṃ khomhi vinayadharo, ime panaññe bhikkhū na vinayadharā’ti. So tena vinayadharattena attānukkaṃseti, paraṃ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, asappurisadhammo. Sappuriso ca kho, bhikkhave, iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘na kho vinayadharattena lobhadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, dosadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, mohadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti. No cepi vinayadharo hoti; so ca hoti dhammānudhammappaṭipanno sāmīcippaṭipanno anudhammacārī, so tattha pujjo, so tattha pāsaṃso’ti. So paṭipadaṃyeva antaraṃ karitvā tena vinayadharattena nevattānukkaṃseti, na paraṃ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, sappurisadhammo.

“Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bad person is a holder of the Discipline. He reflects thus: ‘I am a holder of the Discipline, but these other bhikkhus are not holders of the Discipline.’ He exalts himself because of his being a holder of the Discipline and disparages others. This too, bhikkhus, is a quality of a bad person. But a good person, bhikkhus, reflects thus: ‘It is not by being a holder of the Discipline that states of greed come to an end, nor states of hatred, nor states of delusion. Even if he is not a holder of the Discipline, if he is one who practices in accordance with the Dhamma, practices properly, and lives in conformity with the Dhamma, he is worthy of veneration there, he is worthy of praise there.’ So, making practice itself the criterion, he neither exalts himself nor disparages others because of his being a holder of the Discipline. This too, bhikkhus, is a quality of a good person.”

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, asappuriso dhammakathiko hoti. So iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘ahaṃ khomhi dhammakathiko, ime panaññe bhikkhū na dhammakathikā’ti. So tena dhammakathikattena attānukkaṃseti, paraṃ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, asappurisadhammo. Sappuriso ca kho, bhikkhave, iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘na kho dhammakathikattena lobhadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, dosadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, mohadhammā vā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti. No cepi dhammakathiko hoti; so ca hoti dhammānudhammappaṭipanno sāmīcippaṭipanno anudhammacārī, so tattha pujjo, so tattha pāsaṃso’ti. So paṭipadaṃyeva antaraṃ karitvā tena dhammakathikattena nevattānukkaṃseti, na paraṃ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, sappurisadhammo.

“Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bad person is a Dhamma speaker. He reflects thus: ‘I am a Dhamma speaker, but these other bhikkhus are not Dhamma speakers.’ Because of his being a Dhamma speaker he exalts himself and disparages others. This, too, bhikkhus, is a quality of a bad person. But a good person, bhikkhus, reflects thus: ‘It is not by being a Dhamma speaker that states of greed come to an end, nor states of hatred, nor states of delusion. Even if he is not a Dhamma speaker, if he is one who practices in accordance with the Dhamma, practices properly, and lives in conformity with the Dhamma, he is worthy of veneration there, he is worthy of praise there.’ So, making practice itself the criterion, he neither exalts himself nor disparages others because of his being a Dhamma speaker. This, too, bhikkhus, is a quality of a good person.”

107. ‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, asappuriso āraññiko hoti. So iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘ahaṃ khomhi āraññiko ime panaññe bhikkhū na āraññikā’ti. So tena āraññikattena attānukkaṃseti, paraṃ vambheti.

107."Furthermore, monks, an unprincipled person is a forest-dweller. He reflects thus: ‘I am a forest-dweller, but these other monks are not forest-dwellers.’ He exalts himself because of being a forest-dweller and disparages others. This too, monks, is a quality of an unprincipled person. But a principled person reflects thus: ‘Being a forest-dweller does not lead to the destruction of states of greed, states of hatred, or states of delusion.

"Furthermore, monks, an unprincipled person is a rag-robe wearer. He reflects thus: ‘I am a rag-robe wearer, but these other monks are not rag-robe wearers.’ He exalts himself because of being a rag-robe wearer and disparages others.

"Furthermore, monks, an unprincipled person, having entirely transcended perceptions of form, with the passing away of perceptions of resistance, not attending to perceptions of diversity, [thinking,] ‘Space is infinite,’ enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space. He reflects thus: ‘I am a gainer of the attainment of the base of the infinity of space, but these other monks are not gainers of the attainment of the base of the infinity of space.’ He exalts himself because of that attainment of the base of the infinity of space and disparages others. This too, monks, is a quality of an unprincipled person. But a principled person reflects thus: ‘Non-identification has been spoken of by the Blessed One even in regard to the attainment of the base of the infinity of space. For whatever they conceive, that becomes otherwise.’ Making non-identification the essential point, he neither exalts himself nor disparages others because of that attainment of the base of the infinity of space. This too, monks, is a quality of a principled person."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, asappuriso sabbaso ākāsānañcāyatanaṃ samatikkamma ‘anantaṃ viññāṇa’nti viññāṇañcāyatanaṃ upasampajja viharati. So iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘ahaṃ khomhi viññāṇañcāyatanasamāpattiyā lābhī, ime panaññe bhikkhū viññāṇañcāyatanasamāpattiyā na lābhino’ti. So tāya viññāṇañcāyatanasamāpattiyā attānukkaṃseti, paraṃ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, asappurisadhammo. Sappuriso ca kho, bhikkhave, iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘viññāṇañcāyatanasamāpattiyāpi kho atammayatā vuttā bhagavatā. Yena yena hi maññanti tato taṃ hoti aññathā’ti. So atammayataññeva antaraṃ karitvā tāya viññāṇañcāyatanasamāpattiyā nevattānukkaṃseti, na paraṃ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, sappurisadhammo.

Furthermore, monks, an unworthy person, having completely transcended the base of infinite space, attains and dwells in the base of infinite consciousness, thinking: ‘Infinite is consciousness.’ He reflects thus: ‘I am a gainer of the attainment of the base of infinite consciousness, but these other monks are not gainers of the attainment of the base of infinite consciousness.’ He exalts himself because of that attainment of the base of infinite consciousness and disparages others. This too, monks, is a quality of an unworthy person. But a worthy person reflects thus: ‘The Blessed One has declared non-identification even with regard to the attainment of the base of infinite consciousness. For whatever one conceives, it turns out otherwise.’ Making non-identification the essential point, he neither exalts himself because of that attainment of the base of infinite consciousness nor disparages others. This too, monks, is a quality of a worthy person.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, asappuriso sabbaso viññāṇañcāyatanaṃ samatikkamma ‘natthi kiñcī’ti ākiñcaññāyatanaṃ upasampajja viharati. So iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘ahaṃ khomhi ākiñcaññāyatanasamāpattiyā lābhī, ime panaññe bhikkhū ākiñcaññāyatanasamāpattiyā na lābhino’ti. So tāya ākiñcaññāyatanasamāpattiyā attānukkaṃseti, paraṃ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, asappurisadhammo. Sappuriso ca kho, bhikkhave, iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘ākiñcaññāyatanasamāpattiyāpi kho atammayatā vuttā bhagavatā. Yena yena hi maññanti tato taṃ hoti aññathā’ti. So atammayataññeva antaraṃ karitvā tāya ākiñcaññāyatanasamāpattiyā nevattānukkaṃseti, na paraṃ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, sappurisadhammo.

Furthermore, monks, an unworthy person, having completely transcended the base of infinite consciousness, attains and dwells in the base of nothingness, thinking: ‘There is nothing.’ He reflects thus: ‘I am a gainer of the attainment of the base of nothingness, but these other monks are not gainers of the attainment of the base of nothingness.’ He exalts himself because of that attainment of the base of nothingness and disparages others. This too, monks, is a quality of an unworthy person. But a worthy person reflects thus: ‘The Blessed One has declared non-identification even with regard to the attainment of the base of nothingness. For whatever one conceives, it turns out otherwise.’ Making non-identification the essential point, he neither exalts himself because of that attainment of the base of nothingness nor disparages others. This too, monks, is a quality of a worthy person.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, asappuriso sabbaso ākiñcaññāyatanaṃ samatikkamma nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṃ upasampajja viharati. So iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘ahaṃ khomhi nevasaññānāsaññāyatanasamāpattiyā lābhī, ime panaññe bhikkhū nevasaññānāsaññāyatanasamāpattiyā na lābhino’ti. So tāya nevasaññānāsaññāyatanasamāpattiyā attānukkaṃseti, paraṃ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, asappurisadhammo. Sappuriso ca kho, bhikkhave, iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘nevasaññānāsaññāyatanasamāpattiyāpi kho atammayatā vuttā bhagavatā. Yena yena hi maññanti tato taṃ hoti aññathā’ti. So atammayataññeva antaraṃ karitvā tāya nevasaññānāsaññāyatanasamāpattiyā nevattānukkaṃseti, na paraṃ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, sappurisadhammo.

Furthermore, monks, an unworthy person, having completely transcended the base of nothingness, attains and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. He reflects thus: ‘I am a gainer of the attainment of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, but these other monks are not gainers of the attainment of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.’ He exalts himself because of that attainment of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and disparages others. This too, monks, is a quality of an unworthy person. But a worthy person reflects thus: ‘The Blessed One has declared non-identification even with regard to the attainment of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. For whatever one conceives, it turns out otherwise.’ Making non-identification the essential point, he neither exalts himself because of that attainment of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception nor disparages others. This too, monks, is a quality of a worthy person.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, sappuriso sabbaso nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṃ samatikkamma saññāvedayitanirodhaṃ upasampajja viharati. Paññāya cassa disvā āsavā [ekacce āsavā (ka.)] parikkhīṇā honti. Ayaṃ [ayaṃ kho (syā. kaṃ.)], bhikkhave, bhikkhu na kiñci maññati, na kuhiñci maññati, na kenaci maññatī’’ti.

Furthermore, monks, a worthy person, having completely transcended the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, attains and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling. And his taints are destroyed by his wisdom-seeing. This monk, monks, does not identify himself with anything, anywhere, or by anything.

Idamavoca bhagavā. Attamanā te bhikkhū bhagavato bhāsitaṃ abhinandunti.

The Blessed One said this. The monks, delighted, rejoiced at the Blessed One's words.

Sappurisasuttaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ tatiyaṃ.

The Discourse on the Worthy Person, the third, is finished.
