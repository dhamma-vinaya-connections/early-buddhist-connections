# Iti 82 Pañcapubbanimittasuttaṃ

4.The Discourse on the Five Preliminary Signs
83. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
83.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant; thus I have heard.
‘‘Yadā, bhikkhave, devo devakāyā cavanadhammo hoti, pañcassa pubbanimittāni pātubhavanti – mālā milāyanti, vatthāni kilissanti, kacchehi sedā muccanti, kāye dubbaṇṇiyaṃ okkamati, sake devo devāsane nābhiramatīti. Tamenaṃ, bhikkhave, devā ‘cavanadhammo ayaṃ devaputto’ti iti viditvā tīhi vācāhi anumodenti [anumodanti (sī. syā. pī.)] – ‘ito, bho, sugatiṃ gaccha, sugatiṃ gantvā suladdhalābhaṃ labha, suladdhalābhaṃ labhitvā suppatiṭṭhito bhavāhī’’’ti.
“Monks, when a deva is due to pass away from the host of devas, five preliminary signs appear: his garlands fade, his clothes become soiled, sweat exudes from his armpits, a bad complexion settles on his body, and the deva no longer delights in his own deva-seat. Then, monks, the devas, knowing, ‘This son of the devas is due to pass away,’ encourage him with three statements: ‘Go from here, good sir, to a good destination. Having gone to a good destination, may you obtain a gain that is well-obtained. Having obtained a gain that is well-obtained, may you become well-established.’”
Evaṃ vutte, aññataro bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kinnu kho, bhante, devānaṃ sugatigamanasaṅkhātaṃ; kiñca, bhante, devānaṃ suladdhalābhasaṅkhātaṃ; kiṃ pana, bhante, devānaṃ suppatiṭṭhitasaṅkhāta’’nti?
When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “What, venerable sir, is reckoned as a ‘good destination’ for the devas? What, venerable sir, is reckoned as a ‘gain that is well-obtained’ for the devas? And what, venerable sir, is reckoned as being ‘well-established’ for the devas?”
‘‘Manussattaṃ kho, bhikkhu [bhikkhave (syā. pī.)], devānaṃ sugatigamanasaṅkhātaṃ; yaṃ manussabhūto samāno tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye saddhaṃ paṭilabhati. Idaṃ kho, bhikkhu [bhikkhave (syā. pī.)], devānaṃ suladdhalābhasaṅkhātaṃ; sā kho panassa saddhā niviṭṭhā hoti mūlajātā patiṭṭhitā daḷhā asaṃhāriyā samaṇena vā brāhmaṇena vā devena vā mārena vā brahmunā vā kenaci vā lokasmiṃ. Idaṃ kho, bhikkhu [bhikkhave (syā. pī.)], devānaṃ suppatiṭṭhitasaṅkhāta’’nti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
“Human existence, bhikkhu, is reckoned as a ‘good destination’ for the devas. That, having become a human, one gains faith in the Dhamma and Discipline declared by the Tathāgata: this, bhikkhu, is reckoned as a ‘gain that is well-obtained’ for the devas. And that faith of his is settled, rooted, established, firm, and irremovable by any ascetic, brahmin, deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone else in the world: this, bhikkhu, is reckoned as being ‘well-established’ for the devas.” The Blessed One spoke this matter. In reference to this, it is said:
‘‘Yadā devo devakāyā, cavati āyusaṅkhayā;Tayo saddā niccharanti, devānaṃ anumodataṃ.
“When a deva from the host of devas passes away on the exhaustion of his life-span, three sounds issue forth from the devas who are rejoicing:
‘‘‘Ito bho sugatiṃ gaccha, manussānaṃ sahabyataṃ;Manussabhūto saddhamme, labha saddhaṃ anuttaraṃ.
“‘Go from here, good sir, to a good destination, into human companionship. Having become a human, gain unsurpassed faith in the good Dhamma.’
‘‘‘Sā te saddhā niviṭṭhassa, mūlajātā patiṭṭhitā;Yāvajīvaṃ asaṃhīrā, saddhamme suppavedite.
“‘May that faith of yours be settled, rooted, and established, irremovable for as long as life lasts, in the good Dhamma well-declared.’
‘‘‘Kāyaduccaritaṃ hitvā, vacīduccaritāni ca;Manoduccaritaṃ hitvā, yañcaññaṃ dosasañhitaṃ.
“‘Having abandoned misconduct of body, and misconduct of speech as well, having abandoned misconduct of mind, and whatever else is fraught with fault,
‘‘‘Kāyena kusalaṃ katvā, vācāya kusalaṃ bahuṃ;Manasā kusalaṃ katvā, appamāṇaṃ nirūpadhiṃ.
“‘Do what is wholesome with the body, and much that is wholesome with speech; do what is wholesome with the mind, immeasurable, without acquisitions.
‘‘‘Tato opadhikaṃ puññaṃ, katvā dānena taṃ bahuṃ;Aññepi macce saddhamme, brahmacariye nivesaya’ [nivesaye (sī. syā.)].
“‘Then, with that, by giving, make much merit that leads to new acquisitions, and establish other mortals too in the good Dhamma, in the holy life.’
‘‘Imāya anukampāya, devā devaṃ yadā vidū;Cavantaṃ anumodenti, ehi deva punappuna’’nti.
“It is with such compassion that when the devas know a deva is passing away, they rejoice with him, saying: ‘Come, deva, again and again!’”
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Catutthaṃ.
This matter, too, was spoken by the Blessed One: thus I have heard. The fourth.
