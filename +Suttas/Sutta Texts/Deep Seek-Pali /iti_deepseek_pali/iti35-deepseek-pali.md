# Iti 35 Dutiyanakuhanasuttaṃ

9.The Second Discourse on Deceit
36. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
36.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—so I have heard.
‘‘Nayidaṃ, bhikkhave, brahmacariyaṃ vussati janakuhanatthaṃ, na janalapanatthaṃ, na lābhasakkārasilokānisaṃsatthaṃ, na ‘iti maṃ jano jānātū’ti. Atha kho idaṃ, bhikkhave, brahmacariyaṃ vussati abhiññatthañceva pariññatthañcā’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
"Bhikkhus, this holy life is not lived for the sake of deceiving people, nor for the sake of flattering people, nor for the sake of the rewards of gain, honor, and fame, nor with the thought, 'Let people know me thus.' Rather, Bhikkhus, this holy life is lived for the sake of direct knowledge and for the sake of full understanding." The Blessed One spoke this meaning. On this it is said:
‘‘Abhiññatthaṃ pariññatthaṃ, brahmacariyaṃ anītihaṃ;Adesayi so bhagavā, nibbānogadhagāminaṃ.
"For the sake of direct knowledge, for the sake of full understanding, the holy life, not based on hearsay; the Blessed One taught it, leading to Nibbāna."
‘‘Esa maggo mahattehi, anuyāto mahesibhi;Ye ye taṃ paṭipajjanti, yathā buddhena desitaṃ;Dukkhassantaṃ karissanti, satthusāsanakārino’’ti.
"This is the path followed by the great ones, attended upon by the great seers. Whoever practices it, as taught by the Buddha, those who fulfill the Teacher’s instruction, will make an end of suffering."
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Navamaṃ.
This meaning too was spoken by the Blessed One, so I have heard. The Ninth.
