# Iti 29 Tapanīyasuttaṃ

3.The Tormenting Discourse
30. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
30.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—so I have heard:
‘‘Dveme, bhikkhave, dhammā tapanīyā. Katame dve? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco akatakalyāṇo hoti, akatakusalo, akatabhīruttāṇo, katapāpo, kataluddo, katakibbiso. So ‘akataṃ me kalyāṇa’ntipi tappati, ‘kataṃ me pāpa’ntipi tappati. Ime kho, bhikkhave, dve dhammā tapanīyā’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
"Monks, these two qualities are tormenting. Which two? Here, monks, a certain one has not done good, has not done skillful deeds, has not made a refuge from fear, but has done evil, has been cruel, has committed offenses. He is tormented, thinking, ‘I have done no good,’ and he is tormented, thinking, ‘I have done evil.’ These two qualities, monks, are tormenting." The Blessed One spoke this meaning. On that it is said:
‘‘Kāyaduccaritaṃ katvā, vacīduccaritāni ca;Manoduccaritaṃ katvā, yañcaññaṃ dosasañhitaṃ.
Having done bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct, and whatever else is connected with evil.
‘‘Akatvā kusalaṃ kammaṃ, katvānākusalaṃ bahuṃ;Kāyassa bhedā duppañño, nirayaṃ sopapajjatī’’ti [nirayaṃ so upapajjatīti (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)].
"Not having done a wholesome deed, having done much that is unwholesome, the unwise one, on the dissolution of the body, falls into hell."
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Tatiyaṃ.
This meaning, too, was spoken by the Blessed One—so I have heard. The Third.
