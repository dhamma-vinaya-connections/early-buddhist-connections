# Iti 10 Dosapariññāsuttaṃ
## Iti 10 The Discourse on Full Comprehension of Aversion

10. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
10. This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant; so I have heard:
‘‘Dosaṃ, bhikkhave, anabhijānaṃ aparijānaṃ tattha cittaṃ avirājayaṃ appajahaṃ abhabbo dukkhakkhayāya. Dosañca kho, bhikkhave, abhijānaṃ parijānaṃ tattha cittaṃ virājayaṃ pajahaṃ bhabbo dukkhakkhayāyā’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
"Monks, without directly knowing and fully understanding hate, without dispassioning the mind toward it and abandoning it, one is incapable of ending suffering. But, monks, by directly knowing and fully understanding hate, by dispassioning the mind toward it and abandoning it, one is capable of ending suffering." The Blessed One spoke this meaning. On this it is said:
‘‘Yena dosena duṭṭhāse, sattā gacchanti duggatiṃ;Taṃ dosaṃ sammadaññāya, pajahanti vipassino;Pahāya na punāyanti, imaṃ lokaṃ kudācana’’nti.
"By which aversion beings are corrupted, they fare on to states of woe.
That aversion, having fully understood, those with insight abandon.
Having abandoned it, they never return to this world again."
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Dasamaṃ.
This meaning too was spoken by the Blessed One, so I have heard. Tenth.
Paṭhamo vaggo niṭṭhito.
The first chapter is complete.
Tassuddānaṃ –
The Summary:
Rāgadosā atha moho, kodhamakkhā mānaṃ sabbaṃ;Mānato rāgadosā puna dve, pakāsitā vaggamāhu paṭhamanti.
Greed, hatred, and delusion, anger, contempt, and all forms of conceit;
From conceit, greed and hatred, two again, were declared. They call this the first chapter.
2. Dutiyavaggo
2. The Second Chapter
