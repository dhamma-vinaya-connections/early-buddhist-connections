# Iti 68 Dutiyarāgasuttaṃ

10.The Second Discourse on Passion
69. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
69.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—so I have heard:
‘‘Yassa kassaci, bhikkhave, bhikkhussa vā bhikkhuniyā vā rāgo appahīno, doso appahīno, moho appahīno – ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, na ‘atari [atiṇṇo (ka. sī. ka.)] samuddaṃ saūmiṃ savīciṃ sāvaṭṭaṃ sagahaṃ sarakkhasaṃ’. Yassa kassaci, bhikkhave, bhikkhussa vā bhikkhuniyā vā rāgo pahīno, doso pahīno, moho pahīno – ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, ‘atari samuddaṃ saūmiṃ savīciṃ sāvaṭṭaṃ sagahaṃ sarakkhasaṃ, tiṇṇo pāraṅgato [pāragato (sī. aṭṭha. syā.)] thale tiṭṭhati brāhmaṇo’’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
"Bhikkhus, whatever bhikkhu or bhikkhunī has not abandoned passion, has not abandoned hatred, has not abandoned delusion—this one, bhikkhus, is said not to have ‘crossed the ocean with its waves and billows, its whirlpools, sharks, and demons.’ But whatever bhikkhu or bhikkhunī has abandoned passion, has abandoned hatred, has abandoned delusion—this one, bhikkhus, is said to have ‘crossed the ocean with its waves and billows, its whirlpools, sharks, and demons; has crossed over, gone to the far shore, and stands on high ground, a brahmin.’” This is the meaning the Blessed One spoke. In reference to this, it was said:
‘‘Yassa rāgo ca doso ca, avijjā ca virājitā;Somaṃ samuddaṃ sagahaṃ sarakkhasaṃ, saūmibhayaṃ duttaraṃ accatāri.
"One whose passion, hatred, and ignorance have faded away has crossed over this ocean, hard to cross, with its sharks and demons, with the fear of its waves.
‘‘Saṅgātigo maccujaho nirūpadhi, pahāsi dukkhaṃ apunabbhavāya;Atthaṅgato so na pamāṇameti, amohayi maccurājanti brūmī’’ti.
"Having gone beyond attachment, left death behind, without acquisitions, he has abandoned suffering for the sake of no renewed existence. Gone to his setting, he is beyond measure; he has bewildered the King of Death, I say."
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Dasamaṃ.
This meaning too was spoken by the Blessed One, so I have heard. Tenth.
Dutiyo vaggo niṭṭhito.
The Second Chapter is finished.
Tassuddānaṃ –
The summary:
Puññaṃ cakkhu atha indriyāni [atthindriyā (syā.)], addhā ca caritaṃ duve soci [suci (syā.)];Muno [mune (syā.)] atha rāgaduve, puna vaggamāhu dutiyamuttamanti.
Merit, the eye, and then the faculties, the path and conduct, two on purity; the sage and then two on passion—this they call the supreme second chapter.
3. Tatiyavaggo
