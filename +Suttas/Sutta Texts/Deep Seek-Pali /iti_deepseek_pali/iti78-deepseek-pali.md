# Iti 78 Parihānasuttaṃ

10.Discourse on Decline
79. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
79.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—thus I have heard:
‘‘Tayome, bhikkhave, dhammā sekhassa bhikkhuno parihānāya saṃvattanti. Katame tayo? Idha, bhikkhave, sekho bhikkhu kammārāmo hoti, kammarato, kammārāmatamanuyutto; bhassārāmo hoti, bhassarato, bhassārāmatamanuyutto; niddārāmo hoti, niddārato, niddārāmatamanuyutto. Ime kho, bhikkhave, tayo dhammā sekhassa bhikkhuno parihānāya saṃvattanti.
“Bhikkhus, these three things lead to the decline of a bhikkhu in training. What three? Here, a bhikkhu in training delights in activity, is fond of activity, and is devoted to delighting in activity; he delights in talk, is fond of talk, and is devoted to delighting in talk; he delights in sleep, is fond of sleep, and is devoted to delighting in sleep. These, bhikkhus, are the three things that lead to the decline of a bhikkhu in training.
‘‘Tayome, bhikkhave, dhammā sekhassa bhikkhuno aparihānāya saṃvattanti. Katame tayo? Idha, bhikkhave, sekho bhikkhu na kammārāmo hoti, na kammarato, na kammārāmatamanuyutto; na bhassārāmo hoti, na bhassarato, na bhassārāmatamanuyutto; na niddārāmo hoti, na niddārato, na niddārāmatamanuyutto. Ime kho, bhikkhave, tayo dhammā sekhassa bhikkhuno aparihānāya saṃvattantī’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
“Bhikkhus, these three things lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu in training. What three? Here, a bhikkhu in training does not delight in activity, is not fond of activity, and is not devoted to delighting in activity; he does not delight in talk, is not fond of talk, and is not devoted to delighting in talk; he does not delight in sleep, is not fond of sleep, and is not devoted to delighting in sleep. These, bhikkhus, are the three things that lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu in training.” This the Blessed One said. In reference to this, it was said:
‘‘Kammārāmo bhassārāmo [bhassarato (sabbatha)], niddārāmo ca uddhato;Abhabbo tādiso bhikkhu, phuṭṭhuṃ sambodhimuttamaṃ.
“Delighting in activity, delighting in talk,
Delighting in sleep, and being restless—
Such a bhikkhu is incapable
Of realizing supreme enlightenment.
‘‘Tasmā hi appakiccassa, appamiddho anuddhato;Bhabbo so tādiso bhikkhu, phuṭṭhuṃ sambodhimuttama’’nti.
“Therefore, with few duties,
Not slothful, and not restless,
Such a bhikkhu is capable
Of realizing supreme enlightenment.”
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Dasamaṃ.
This too is the meaning of what was said by the Blessed One, so I have heard. Tenth.
Tatiyo vaggo niṭṭhito.
The Third Chapter is finished.
Tassuddānaṃ –
The summary:
Dve diṭṭhī nissaraṇaṃ rūpaṃ, putto avuṭṭhikena ca;Sukhā ca bhiduro [bhindanā (sabbattha)] dhātu, parihānena te dasāti.
Two on views, escape, and form,
A son, and one on the rainless cloud;
Pleasure, the fragile, an element,
And decline make up the ten.
