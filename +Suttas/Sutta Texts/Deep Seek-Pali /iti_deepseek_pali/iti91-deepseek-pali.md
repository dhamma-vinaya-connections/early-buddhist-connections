# Iti 91 Saṅghāṭikaṇṇasuttaṃ

3.The Corner of the Robe
92. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
92.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—so I have heard:
‘‘Saṅghāṭikaṇṇe cepi, bhikkhave, bhikkhu gahetvā piṭṭhito piṭṭhito anubandho assa pāde pādaṃ nikkhipanto, so ca hoti abhijjhālu kāmesu tibbasārāgo byāpannacitto paduṭṭhamanasaṅkappo muṭṭhassati asampajāno asamāhito vibbhantacitto pākatindriyo; atha kho so ārakāva mayhaṃ, ahañca tassa. Taṃ kissa hetu? Dhammañhi so, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na passati. Dhammaṃ apassanto na maṃ passati [maṃ na passati (syā.)].
“Even if, monks, a monk were to take hold of the corner of my outer robe and follow close behind me, step by step, yet if he is covetous, with intense passion for sensual pleasures, with a mind of ill will, with corrupt mental intentions, of lapsed mindfulness, not clearly comprehending, unconcentrated, with a distracted mind, and with senses unrestrained—then he is far from me, and I am far from him. For what reason? Because, monks, that monk does not see the Dhamma. Not seeing the Dhamma, he does not see me.
‘‘Yojanasate cepi so, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vihareyya. So ca hoti anabhijjhālu kāmesu na tibbasārāgo abyāpannacitto apaduṭṭhamanasaṅkappo upaṭṭhitassati sampajāno samāhito ekaggacitto saṃvutindriyo; atha kho so santikeva mayhaṃ, ahañca tassa. Taṃ kissa hetu? Dhammaṃ hi so, bhikkhave, bhikkhu passati; dhammaṃ passanto maṃ passatī’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
“Even if, monks, that monk were to live a hundred yojanas away, yet if he is not covetous, without intense passion for sensual pleasures, with a mind free of ill will, with uncorrupted mental intentions, with mindfulness established, clearly comprehending, concentrated, with a one-pointed mind, and with senses restrained—then he is near to me, and I am near to him. For what reason? Because, monks, that monk sees the Dhamma; seeing the Dhamma, he sees me.” This is the meaning the Blessed One stated. In connection with this, it was said:
‘‘Anubandhopi ce assa, mahiccho ca vighātavā;Ejānugo anejassa, nibbutassa anibbuto;Giddho so vītagedhassa, passa yāvañca ārakā.
“Though following close behind, one of great wishes, given to vexation; the agitated follower of the unagitated, the unquenched of the quenched, the greedy of the greedless one—see how far away he is!
‘‘Yo ca dhammamabhiññāya, dhammamaññāya paṇḍito;Rahadova nivāte ca, anejo vūpasammati.
“But the wise one who has understood the Dhamma through direct knowledge is untrembling and at peace, like a lake in a windless place.
‘‘Anejo so anejassa, nibbutassa ca nibbuto;Agiddho vītagedhassa, passa yāvañca santike’’ti.
“The unagitated one of the unagitated, the quenched of the quenched, the ungreedy of the one free from greed—see how near he is!”
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Tatiyaṃ.
This meaning too was spoken by the Blessed One, so I have heard. The third.
