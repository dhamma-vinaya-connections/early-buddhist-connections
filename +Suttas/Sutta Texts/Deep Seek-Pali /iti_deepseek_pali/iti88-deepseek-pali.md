# Iti 88 Devadattasuttaṃ

10.The Sutta on Devadatta
89. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
89.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—thus have I heard.
‘‘Tīhi, bhikkhave, asaddhammehi abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto devadatto āpāyiko nerayiko kappaṭṭho atekiccho. Katamehi tīhi? Pāpicchatāya, bhikkhave, abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto devadatto āpāyiko nerayiko kappaṭṭho atekiccho. Pāpamittatāya, bhikkhave, abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto devadatto āpāyiko nerayiko kappaṭṭho atekiccho. Sati kho pana uttarikaraṇīye [uttariṃ karaṇīye (syā.)] oramattakena visesādhigamena [visesādhigamena ca (syā. pī.)] antarā vosānaṃ āpādi. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, tīhi asaddhammehi abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto devadatto āpāyiko nerayiko kappaṭṭho atekiccho’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
“Bhikkhus, overcome and with his mind consumed by three unrighteous qualities, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, to remain for the aeon, incurable. What three? Bhikkhus, overcome and with his mind consumed by evil desires, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, to remain for the aeon, incurable. Bhikkhus, overcome and with his mind consumed by evil friendship, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, to remain for the aeon, incurable. And although there was something further to be done, he came to a standstill midway with a minor attainment of distinction. Bhikkhus, overcome and with his mind consumed by these three unrighteous qualities, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, to remain for the aeon, incurable.” This is the meaning the Blessed One spoke. On that occasion this was said:
‘‘Mā jātu koci lokasmiṃ, pāpiccho udapajjatha;Tadamināpi jānātha, pāpicchānaṃ yathā gati.
“May no one with evil desires ever arise in the world. From this you may know the destination of those with evil desires.
‘‘Paṇḍitoti samaññāto, bhāvitattoti sammato;Jalaṃva yasasā aṭṭhā, devadattoti vissuto [me sutaṃ (pāḷiyaṃ)].
“Known as ‘wise,’ esteemed as ‘one whose self was developed,’ shining with fame, so Devadatta was renowned.
‘‘So pamāṇamanuciṇṇo [pamādamanuciṇṇo (ka. sī. syā. pī.), samānamanuciṇṇo (aṭṭha.)], āsajja naṃ tathāgataṃ;Avīcinirayaṃ patto, catudvāraṃ bhayānakaṃ.
“Practicing heedlessness, having assailed the Tathāgata, he fell into the Avīci hell, the dreadful four-doored.
‘‘Aduṭṭhassa hi yo dubbhe, pāpakammaṃ akubbato;Tameva pāpaṃ phusati [phusseti (syā.)], duṭṭhacittaṃ anādaraṃ.
“Whoever harms a person who is not corrupt, one who does no evil deed, that evil recoils upon that very one—the corrupt-minded, disrespectful fool.
‘‘Samuddaṃ visakumbhena, yo maññeyya padūsituṃ;Na so tena padūseyya, bhesmā hi udadhi mahā.
“Whoever might think to pollute the ocean with a pot of poison would not pollute it thereby, for the great ocean is awesome.
‘‘Evameva [evametaṃ (syā.)] tathāgataṃ, yo vādena vihiṃsati;Sammaggataṃ [samaggataṃ (sī. ka.)] santacittaṃ, vādo tamhi na rūhati.
“So too, one who assails the Tathāgata with words—the one rightly gone, with a peaceful mind—that speech does not take hold of him.
‘‘Tādisaṃ mittaṃ kubbetha, tañca seveyya paṇḍito;Yassa maggānugo bhikkhu, khayaṃ dukkhassa pāpuṇe’’ti.
“A wise person should make such a one a friend and associate with him. A bhikkhu following his path would attain the destruction of suffering.”
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Dasamaṃ.
This meaning too was spoken by the Blessed One, so I have heard. Tenth.
Catuttho vaggo niṭṭhito.
The Fourth Chapter is finished.
Tassuddānaṃ –
The summary:
Vitakkāsakkārasadda, cavanaloke asubhaṃ;Dhammaandhakāramalaṃ, devadattena te dasāti.
Thoughts, honor, sound, decline, the world, the foul; Dhamma, darkness, stain, and Devadatta make ten.
