# Iti 95 Kāmayogasuttaṃ

7.The Discourse on the Yoke of Sensual Desire
96. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
96.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—so I have heard:
‘‘Kāmayogayutto, bhikkhave, bhavayogayutto āgāmī hoti āgantā [āgantvā (syā. ka.)] itthattaṃ. Kāmayogavisaṃyutto, bhikkhave, bhavayogayutto anāgāmī hoti anāgantā itthattaṃ. Kāmayogavisaṃyutto, bhikkhave, bhavayogavisaṃyutto arahā hoti, khīṇāsavo’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
“Bhikkhus, one yoked to the yoke of sensual desire and yoked to the yoke of becoming is a returner, one who comes back to this state of being. Bhikkhus, one disjoined from the yoke of sensual desire but yoked to the yoke of becoming is a non-returner, one who does not come back to this state of being. Bhikkhus, one disjoined from the yoke of sensual desire and disjoined from the yoke of becoming is an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed.” This is the meaning the Blessed One spoke. In reference to this it is said:
‘‘Kāmayogena saṃyuttā, bhavayogena cūbhayaṃ;Sattā gacchanti saṃsāraṃ, jātimaraṇagāmino.
“Yoked by the yoke of sensual desire and by the yoke of becoming, both, beings fare on through saṃsāra, subject to birth and death.”
‘‘Ye ca kāme pahantvāna, appattā āsavakkhayaṃ;Bhavayogena saṃyuttā, anāgāmīti vuccare.
“But those who have abandoned sensual pleasures without having reached the destruction of the taints, being yoked to the yoke of becoming, are called non-returners.”
‘‘Ye ca kho chinnasaṃsayā, khīṇamānapunabbhavā;Te ve pāraṅgatā loke, ye pattā āsavakkhaya’’nti.
“But those who have cut off doubt, whose conceit and renewed existence are destroyed—they have indeed gone beyond in the world, those who have reached the destruction of the taints.”
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Sattamaṃ.
This too is the meaning spoken by the Blessed One, so I have heard. Seventh.
Kalyāṇasīlasuttaṃ
The Discourse on Admirable Virtue
97. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
97.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—so I have heard:
‘‘Kalyāṇasīlo, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kalyāṇadhammo kalyāṇapañño imasmiṃ dhammavinaye ‘kevalī vusitavā uttamapuriso’ti vuccati –
“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu of admirable virtue, admirable qualities, and admirable wisdom is called in this Dhamma and Discipline ‘a perfect one, one who has lived the holy life, a supreme person.’”
‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kalyāṇasīlo hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sīlavā hoti, pātimokkhasaṃvarasaṃvuto viharati, ācāragocarasampanno aṇumattesu vajjesu bhayadassāvī, samādāya sikkhati sikkhāpadesu. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kalyāṇasīlo hoti. Iti kalyāṇasīlo.
“And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu of admirable virtue? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults. He trains by undertaking the training rules. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu is of admirable virtue. Thus he is of admirable virtue.”
‘‘Kalyāṇadhammo ca kathaṃ hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sattannaṃ bodhipakkhiyānaṃ dhammānaṃ bhāvanānuyogamanuyutto viharati. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kalyāṇadhammo hoti. Iti kalyāṇasīlo, kalyāṇadhammo.
“And how is he of admirable qualities? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells devoted to developing the thirty-seven states pertaining to enlightenment. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu is of admirable qualities. Thus he is of admirable virtue and of admirable qualities.”
‘‘Kalyāṇapañño ca kathaṃ hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu āsavānaṃ khayā anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ paññāvimuttiṃ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharati. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kalyāṇapañño hoti.
“And how is he of admirable wisdom? Here, bhikkhus, with the destruction of the taints, a bhikkhu in this very life enters and dwells in the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, having realized it for himself with direct knowledge. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu is of admirable wisdom.”
‘‘Iti kalyāṇasīlo kalyāṇadhammo kalyāṇapañño imasmiṃ dhammavinaye ‘kevalī vusitavā uttamapuriso’ti vuccatī’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
“Thus, being of admirable virtue, admirable qualities, and admirable wisdom, in this Dhamma and Discipline he is called ‘a perfect one, one who has lived the holy life, a supreme person.’” This is the meaning the Blessed One spoke. In reference to this it is said:
‘‘Yassa kāyena vācāya, manasā natthi dukkaṭaṃ;Taṃ ve kalyāṇasīloti, āhu bhikkhuṃ hirīmanaṃ [hirīmataṃ (syā. ka.)].
“One who has done no wrong by body, speech, or mind—that conscientious bhikkhu they call one of admirable virtue.”
‘‘Yassa dhammā subhāvitā, satta [patta (sabbattha)] sambodhigāmino;Taṃ ve kalyāṇadhammoti, āhu bhikkhuṃ anussadaṃ.
“One for whom the qualities are well developed, the seven that lead to full enlightenment—that humble bhikkhu they call one of admirable qualities.”
‘‘Yo dukkhassa pajānāti, idheva khayamattano;Taṃ ve kalyāṇapaññoti, āhu bhikkhuṃ anāsavaṃ.
“One who understands right here the destruction of his own suffering—that taintless bhikkhu they call one of admirable wisdom.”
‘‘Tehi dhammehi sampannaṃ, anīghaṃ chinnasaṃsayaṃ;Asitaṃ sabbalokassa, āhu sabbapahāyina’’nti.
“Endowed with these qualities, untroubled, with doubt cut off, unattached to the entire world, they call him one who has abandoned all.”
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.
This too is the meaning spoken by the Blessed One, so I have heard. Eighth.
