# Iti 15 Paṭhamasekhasuttaṃ
## Iti 15 The First Discourse on the Adept

16. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
16. This was said by the Blessed One; it was said by the Arahant—thus have I heard:
‘‘Sekhassa, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno appattamānasassa anuttaraṃ yogakkhemaṃ patthayamānassa viharato ajjhattikaṃ aṅganti karitvā nāññaṃ ekaṅgampi samanupassāmi yaṃ evaṃ bahūpakāraṃ yathayidaṃ, bhikkhave, yoniso manasikāro. Yoniso, bhikkhave, bhikkhu manasi karonto akusalaṃ pajahati, kusalaṃ bhāvetī’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
"For a monk in higher training, bhikkhus, whose mind has not yet reached the goal, who is dwelling aspiring to the unsurpassed security from bondage, I do not see any other single factor among internal factors that is so helpful as is this, bhikkhus: appropriate attention. For a monk who attends appropriately, bhikkhus, unwholesome states are abandoned and wholesome states are developed." The Blessed One spoke this meaning. On this it is said:
‘‘Yoniso manasikāro, dhammo sekhassa bhikkhuno;Natthañño evaṃ bahukāro, uttamatthassa pattiyā;Yoniso padahaṃ bhikkhu, khayaṃ dukkhassa pāpuṇe’’ti.
“Careful attention is the quality for a trainee monk; there is no other so helpful for the attainment of the highest goal. A monk applying himself with careful attention attains the destruction of suffering.”
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Chaṭṭhaṃ.
This too was said by the Blessed One, so I heard. Sixth.
