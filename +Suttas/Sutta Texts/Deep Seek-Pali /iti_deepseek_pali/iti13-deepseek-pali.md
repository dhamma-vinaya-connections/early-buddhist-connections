# Iti 13 Avijjānīvaraṇasuttaṃ
## Iti 13 The Discourse on the Hindrance of Ignorance

14. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
14. This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—so I have heard:
‘‘Nāhaṃ, bhikkhave, aññaṃ ekanīvaraṇampi samanupassāmi yena [yenevaṃ (?)] nīvaraṇena nivutā pajā dīgharattaṃ sandhāvanti saṃsaranti yathayidaṃ, bhikkhave, avijjānīvaraṇaṃ [avijjānīvaraṇena (?)]. Avijjānīvaraṇena hi, bhikkhave, nivutā pajā dīgharattaṃ sandhāvanti saṃsarantī’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
"Monks, I do not see any other single hindrance by which beings are obstructed, wandering and transmigrating for a long time, as the hindrance of ignorance. Truly, monks, beings obstructed by the hindrance of ignorance wander and transmigrate for a long time." This the Blessed One said. Concerning this, it was said:
‘‘Natthañño ekadhammopi, yenevaṃ [yeneva (sī. pī. ka.)] nivutā pajā;Saṃsaranti ahorattaṃ, yathā mohena āvutā.
"There is no other single thing by which beings are so enveloped;
They wander on day and night, as those covered by delusion."
‘‘Ye ca mohaṃ pahantvāna, tamokhandhaṃ [tamokkhandhaṃ (sī. syā. pī.)] padālayuṃ;Na te puna saṃsaranti, hetu tesaṃ na vijjatī’’ti.
"Those who have abandoned delusion, and dispelled the mass of darkness;
They do not wander in samsara again, for them no cause exists."
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Catutthaṃ.
This too was spoken by the Blessed One; so I have heard. Fourth.
