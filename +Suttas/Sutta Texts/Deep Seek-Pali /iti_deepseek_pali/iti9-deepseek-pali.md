# Iti 9 Lobhapariññāsuttaṃ
## Iti 9 The Discourse on Full Comprehension of Greed

9. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
9. This was said by the Blessed One, and it was said by the Arahant: thus have I heard.
‘‘Lobhaṃ, bhikkhave, anabhijānaṃ aparijānaṃ tattha cittaṃ avirājayaṃ appajahaṃ abhabbo dukkhakkhayāya. Lobhañca kho, bhikkhave, abhijānaṃ parijānaṃ tattha cittaṃ virājayaṃ pajahaṃ bhabbo dukkhakkhayāyā’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
"Monks, without directly knowing and fully understanding greed, without dispassioning the mind toward it and abandoning it, one is incapable of the destruction of suffering. But, monks, by directly knowing and fully understanding greed, by dispassioning the mind toward it and abandoning it, one is capable of the destruction of suffering." The Blessed One spoke this meaning. In connection with this, it is said:
‘‘Yena lobhena luddhāse, sattā gacchanti duggatiṃ;Taṃ lobhaṃ sammadaññāya, pajahanti vipassino;Pahāya na punāyanti, imaṃ lokaṃ kudācana’’nti.
"By whatever greed beings, ensnared, go to a lower destination;
Having fully understood that greed, the discerning abandon it;
Having abandoned it, they never return to this world."
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Navamaṃ.
This meaning, too, was spoken by the Blessed One, thus have I heard. Ninth.
