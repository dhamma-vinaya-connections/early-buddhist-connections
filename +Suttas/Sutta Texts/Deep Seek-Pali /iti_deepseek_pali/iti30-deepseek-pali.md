# Iti 30 Atapanīyasuttaṃ

4.The Untroubled Discourse
31. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
31.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—so I have heard:
‘‘Dveme, bhikkhave, dhammā atapanīyā. Katame dve? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco katakalyāṇo hoti, katakusalo, katabhīruttāṇo, akatapāpo, akataluddo, akatakibbiso. So ‘kataṃ me kalyāṇa’ntipi na tappati, ‘akataṃ me pāpa’ntipi na tappati. Ime kho, bhikkhave, dve dhammā atapanīyā’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
"Monks, these two qualities are not tormenting. Which two? Here, monks, a certain person has done good, has done skillful deeds, has made a refuge from fear, has not done evil, has not been cruel, has not committed offenses. He does not torment himself with the thought, 'I have done good,' nor does he torment himself with the thought, 'I have not done evil.' These, monks, are the two qualities that are not tormenting." The Blessed One spoke this meaning. On that it is said:
‘‘Kāyaduccaritaṃ hitvā, vacīduccaritāni ca;Manoduccaritaṃ hitvā, yañcaññaṃ dosasañhitaṃ.
"Having abandoned bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct, and whatever else is connected with fault."
‘‘Akatvākusalaṃ kammaṃ, katvāna kusalaṃ bahuṃ;Kāyassa bhedā sappañño, saggaṃ so upapajjatī’’ti.
"Having not done unwholesome deeds, but having done much that is wholesome—when the body breaks up, the wise one is reborn in heaven."
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Catutthaṃ.
This meaning, too, was spoken by the Blessed One—so I have heard. The Fourth.
