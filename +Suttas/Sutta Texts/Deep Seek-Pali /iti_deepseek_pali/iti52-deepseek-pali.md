# Iti 52 Dutiyavedanāsuttaṃ

4.The Second Discourse on Feelings
53. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
53.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—so I heard.
‘‘Tisso imā, bhikkhave, vedanā. Katamā tisso? Sukhā vedanā, dukkhā vedanā, adukkhamasukhā vedanā. Sukhā, bhikkhave, vedanā dukkhato daṭṭhabbā; dukkhā vedanā sallato daṭṭhabbā; adukkhamasukhā vedanā aniccato daṭṭhabbā. Yato kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno sukhā vedanā dukkhato diṭṭhā hoti, dukkhā vedanā sallato diṭṭhā hoti, adukkhamasukhā vedanā aniccato diṭṭhā hoti; ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, ‘bhikkhu ariyo sammaddaso acchecchi [acchejji (sī. pī.), acchijji (ka.)], taṇhaṃ, vivattayi [vāvattayi (sī. aṭṭha.)] saṃyojanaṃ, sammā mānābhisamayā antamakāsi dukkhassā’’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
"Bhikkhus, there are these three feelings. Which three? Pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Pleasant feeling, bhikkhus, should be seen as suffering; painful feeling should be seen as a dart; neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling should be seen as impermanent. When, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has seen pleasant feeling as suffering, painful feeling as a dart, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling as impermanent—this, bhikkhus, is called 'a noble bhikkhu, a right-seer, who has cut off craving, loosened the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering.'" The Blessed One said this. In this regard, it is said:
‘‘Yo sukhaṃ dukkhato adda [dakkhi (sī. pī. ka.), adakkhi (syā.)], dukkhamaddakkhi sallato;Adukkhamasukhaṃ santaṃ, adakkhi naṃ aniccato.
"One who sees pleasure as suffering, and suffering as a dart; and the peaceful state that is neither painful nor pleasant as impermanent—
‘‘Sa ve sammaddaso bhikkhu, yato tattha vimuccati;Abhiññāvosito santo, sa ve yogātigo munī’’ti.
"That bhikkhu, a right-seer, is liberated from them; Having accomplished higher knowledge, peaceful, that sage is indeed beyond all bonds."
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Catutthaṃ.
This too was spoken by the Blessed One, so I heard. This is the fourth discourse.
