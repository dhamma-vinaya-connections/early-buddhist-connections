# Iti 11 Mohapariññāsuttaṃ
## Iti 11 The Discourse on the Full Understanding of Delusion

11. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
11. This has been said by the Blessed One; this has been said by the Arahant; so I have heard:
‘‘Mohaṃ, bhikkhave, anabhijānaṃ aparijānaṃ tattha cittaṃ avirājayaṃ appajahaṃ abhabbo dukkhakkhayāya. Mohañca kho, bhikkhave, abhijānaṃ parijānaṃ tattha cittaṃ virājayaṃ pajahaṃ bhabbo dukkhakkhayāyā’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
"Monks, without directly knowing and fully understanding delusion, without dispassion for it and abandoning it, one is incapable of the destruction of suffering. But, monks, directly knowing and fully understanding delusion, with dispassion for it and abandoning it, one is capable of the destruction of suffering." This is what the Blessed One said. About this, it is said:
‘‘Yena mohena mūḷhāse, sattā gacchanti duggatiṃ;Taṃ mohaṃ sammadaññāya, pajahanti vipassino;Pahāya na punāyanti, imaṃ lokaṃ kudācana’’nti.
By the delusion with which they are bewildered, beings go to an unhappy bourn. Having fully known that delusion, the discerning abandon it. Having abandoned it, they never return to this world again.
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Paṭhamaṃ.
This too is a matter that was said by the Blessed One, so I have heard. First.
