# Iti 12 Kodhapariññāsuttaṃ
## Iti 12 The Discourse on the Comprehension of Anger

12. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
12. This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—so I have heard:
‘‘Kodhaṃ, bhikkhave, anabhijānaṃ aparijānaṃ tattha cittaṃ avirājayaṃ appajahaṃ abhabbo dukkhakkhayāya. Kodhañca kho, bhikkhave, abhijānaṃ parijānaṃ tattha cittaṃ virājayaṃ pajahaṃ bhabbo dukkhakkhayāyā’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
"Monks, without directly knowing anger, without fully understanding it, without developing dispassion for it, and without abandoning it, one is incapable of the destruction of suffering. But monks, directly knowing anger, fully understanding it, developing dispassion for it, and abandoning it, one is capable of the destruction of suffering." The Blessed One declared this meaning. In connection with that, it is said:
‘‘Yena kodhena kuddhāse, sattā gacchanti duggatiṃ;Taṃ kodhaṃ sammadaññāya, pajahanti vipassino;Pahāya na punāyanti, imaṃ lokaṃ kudācana’’nti.
By whatever anger, angry beings go to a woeful state;
The discerning, rightly understanding that anger, abandon it;
Having abandoned it, they never come back again to this world.
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Dutiyaṃ.
This meaning too was spoken by the Blessed One; so I have heard. Second.
3.Makkhapariññāsuttaṃ
3. The Discourse on Fully Understanding Disparagement
13. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
13. This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—so I heard:
‘‘Makkhaṃ, bhikkhave, anabhijānaṃ aparijānaṃ tattha cittaṃ avirājayaṃ appajahaṃ abhabbo dukkhakkhayāya. Makkhañca kho, bhikkhave, abhijānaṃ parijānaṃ tattha cittaṃ virājayaṃ pajahaṃ bhabbo dukkhakkhayāyā’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
"Monks, without directly knowing and fully understanding disparagement, without developing dispassion toward it and without abandoning it, one is incapable of destroying suffering. But, monks, by directly knowing and fully understanding disparagement, by developing dispassion toward it and abandoning it, one is capable of destroying suffering." The Blessed One spoke this meaning. On this, it is said:
‘‘Yena makkhena makkhāse, sattā gacchanti duggatiṃ;Taṃ makkhaṃ sammadaññāya, pajahanti vipassino;Pahāya na punāyanti, imaṃ lokaṃ kudācana’’nti.
Through disparagement, by which they are defiled, beings go to a bad destination; having rightly understood that disparagement, the discerning abandon it; having abandoned it, they never return to this world again.
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Tatiyaṃ.
This too was stated by the Blessed One, so I have heard. The Third.
