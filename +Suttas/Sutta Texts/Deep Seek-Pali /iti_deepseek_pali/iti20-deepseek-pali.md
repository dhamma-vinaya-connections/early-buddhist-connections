# Iti 20 Pasannacittasuttaṃ

1.The Discourse on the Serene Mind
21. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
21.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—so I have heard:
‘‘Idhāhaṃ, bhikkhave, ekaccaṃ puggalaṃ pasannacittaṃ evaṃ cetasā ceto paricca pajānāmi – ‘imamhi cāyaṃ samaye puggalo kālaṃ kareyya yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ sagge’. Taṃ kissa hetu? Cittaṃ hissa, bhikkhave, pasannaṃ. Cetopasādahetu kho pana, bhikkhave, evamidhekacce sattā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjantī’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
“Here, monks, I understand by encompassing with my mind the mind of a certain person whose mind is serene, thus: ‘If this person were to die at this time, they would be reborn in heaven as if picked up and put down there.’ For what reason? For, monks, his mind is serene. It is due to serenity of mind, monks, that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a happy destination, in the heavenly world.” The Blessed One spoke this meaning. On this matter, it is said:
‘‘Pasannacittaṃ ñatvāna, ekaccaṃ idha puggalaṃ;Etamatthañca byākāsi, buddho bhikkhūna santike.
“Knowing a person here with a mind serene, the Buddha explained this matter in the presence of the monks.
‘‘Imamhi cāyaṃ samaye, kālaṃ kayirātha puggalo;Sugatiṃ upapajjeyya, cittaṃ hissa pasāditaṃ.
“If this person should die at this time, they would be reborn in a good destination, for his mind is serene.
‘‘Yathā haritvā nikkhipeyya, evameva tathāvidho;Cetopasādahetu hi, sattā gacchanti suggati’’nti.
“Just as one might carry and deposit, even so is such a one. For due to serenity of mind, beings go to a happy destination.”
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Paṭhamaṃ.
This meaning, too, was spoken by the Blessed One, thus I have heard. First.
