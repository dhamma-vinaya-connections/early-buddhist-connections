# Iti 7 Sabbapariññāsuttaṃ
## Iti 7 The Discourse on Complete Understanding of All

7. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
7. This was stated by the Blessed One, stated by the Arahant, so I heard.
‘‘Sabbaṃ, bhikkhave, anabhijānaṃ aparijānaṃ tattha cittaṃ avirājayaṃ appajahaṃ abhabbo dukkhakkhayāya. Sabbañca kho, bhikkhave, abhijānaṃ parijānaṃ tattha cittaṃ virājayaṃ pajahaṃ bhabbo dukkhakkhayāyā’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
"Monks, without fully knowing and completely understanding all, without dispassion and relinquishment of the mind regarding it, one is incapable of the destruction of suffering. But, monks, by fully knowing and completely understanding all, with dispassion and relinquishment of the mind regarding it, one is capable of the destruction of suffering." This matter was stated by the Blessed One. In connection with this, it is said:
‘‘Yo sabbaṃ sabbato ñatvā, sabbatthesu na rajjati;Sa ve sabbapariññā [sabbaṃ pariññā (syā. pī.)] so, sabbadukkhamupaccagā’’ti [sabbaṃ dukkhaṃ upaccagāti (syā.), sabbadukkhaṃ upaccagāti (pī. aṭṭha.)].
One who, having known all in every respect,
In all things is not attached,
That one truly has completely understood all,
Has transcended all suffering.
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Sattamaṃ.
This matter too was stated by the Blessed One; so I heard. Seventh.
