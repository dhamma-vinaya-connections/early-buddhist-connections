# Iti 101 Samaṇabrāhmaṇasuttaṃ

4.Ascetics and Brahmins
103. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
103.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—so I have heard:
‘‘Ye hi keci, bhikkhave, samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānanti; ‘ayaṃ dukkhasamudayo’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānanti; ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodho’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānanti; ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānanti – na me te, bhikkhave, samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā samaṇesu vā samaṇasammatā brāhmaṇesu vā brāhmaṇasammatā, na ca panete āyasmanto sāmaññatthaṃ vā brahmaññatthaṃ vā diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharanti.
“Monks, whatever ascetics or brahmins do not understand as it really is: ‘This is suffering’; do not understand as it really is: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; do not understand as it really is: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; do not understand as it really is: ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering’—I do not consider them, monks, to be ascetics among ascetics or brahmins among brahmins. Nor do those venerable ones, in this very life, dwell having for themselves directly known, realized, and attained the goal of asceticism or the goal of brahminhood.
‘‘Ye ca kho keci, bhikkhave, samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānanti; ‘ayaṃ dukkhasamudayo’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānanti; ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodho’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānanti; ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānanti – te kho me, bhikkhave, samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā samaṇesu ceva samaṇasammatā brāhmaṇesu ca brāhmaṇasammatā, te ca panāyasmanto sāmaññatthañca brahmaññatthañca diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharantī’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
“But, monks, whatever ascetics or brahmins understand as it really is: ‘This is suffering’; understand as it really is: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; understand as it really is: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; understand as it really is: ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering’—I consider them, monks, to be ascetics among ascetics and brahmins among brahmins. And those venerable ones, in this very life, dwell having for themselves directly known, realized, and attained the goal of asceticism and the goal of brahminhood.” This is the meaning the Blessed One spoke. In reference to this, it is said:
‘‘Ye dukkhaṃ nappajānanti, atho dukkhassa sambhavaṃ;Yattha ca sabbaso dukkhaṃ, asesaṃ uparujjhati;Tañca maggaṃ na jānanti, dukkhūpasamagāminaṃ.
“Those who do not understand suffering, and the origin of suffering, and where suffering entirely, without remainder, ceases, and do not know the path that leads to the stilling of suffering—
‘‘Cetovimuttihīnā te, atho paññāvimuttiyā;Abhabbā te antakiriyāya, te ve jātijarūpagā.
“—deficient in liberation of mind and also in liberation by wisdom, they are incapable of making an end; they are indeed subject to birth and aging.
‘‘Ye ca dukkhaṃ pajānanti, atho dukkhassa sambhavaṃ;Yattha ca sabbaso dukkhaṃ, asesaṃ uparujjhati;Tañca maggaṃ pajānanti, dukkhūpasamagāminaṃ.
“But those who understand suffering, and the origin of suffering, and where suffering entirely, without remainder, ceases, and who know the path that leads to the stilling of suffering—
‘‘Cetovimuttisampannā, atho paññāvimuttiyā;Bhabbā te antakiriyāya, na te jātijarūpagā’’ti.
“—endowed with liberation of mind and also with liberation by wisdom, they are capable of making an end; they are not subject to birth and aging.”
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Catutthaṃ.
This too is the meaning that was spoken by the Blessed One, so I have heard. Fourth.
