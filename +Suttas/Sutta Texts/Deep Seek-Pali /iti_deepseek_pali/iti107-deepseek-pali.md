# Iti 107 Nadīsotasuttaṃ

10.The River Current
109. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
109.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—so I have heard:
‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, puriso nadiyā sotena ovuyheyya piyarūpasātarūpena. Tamenaṃ cakkhumā puriso tīre ṭhito disvā evaṃ vadeyya – ‘kiñcāpi kho tvaṃ, ambho purisa, nadiyā sotena ovuyhasi piyarūpasātarūpena, atthi cettha heṭṭhā rahado saūmi sāvaṭṭo sagaho sarakkhaso yaṃ tvaṃ, ambho purisa, rahadaṃ pāpuṇitvā maraṇaṃ vā nigacchasi maraṇamattaṃ vā dukkha’nti. Atha kho so, bhikkhave, puriso tassa purisassa saddaṃ sutvā hatthehi ca pādehi ca paṭisotaṃ vāyameyya.
“Suppose, bhikkhus, a man was being carried along by a river’s current, which seems pleasant and delightful. A man with good sight standing on the bank would see him and say: ‘Good man, though you are being carried along by a river’s current, which seems pleasant and delightful, further down there is a pool with waves and whirlpools, with monsters and demons. On reaching that pool, you will come to death or to suffering equal to death.’ Then, bhikkhus, on hearing that man’s words, that man would struggle against the current with his hands and feet.
‘‘Upamā kho me ayaṃ, bhikkhave, katā atthassa viññāpanāya. Ayaṃ cettha [ayaṃ cevettha (syā.)] attho – ‘nadiyā soto’ti kho, bhikkhave, taṇhāyetaṃ adhivacanaṃ.
“Bhikkhus, I have created this simile to illustrate the meaning. And this is the meaning here: ‘The river’s current,’ bhikkhus, is a term for craving.
‘‘‘Piyarūpaṃ sātarūpa’nti kho, bhikkhave, channetaṃ ajjhattikānaṃ āyatanānaṃ adhivacanaṃ.
“‘Pleasant and delightful,’ bhikkhus, is a term for the six internal sense bases.
‘‘‘Heṭṭhā rahado’ti kho, bhikkhave, pañcannaṃ orambhāgiyānaṃ saṃyojanānaṃ adhivacanaṃ;‘‘‘Ūmibhaya’nti kho [sañīmīti kho (bahūsu)], bhikkhave, kodhupāyāsassetaṃ adhivacanaṃ;‘‘‘Āvaṭṭa’nti kho [sāvaṭṭoti kho (bahūsu)], bhikkhave, pañcannetaṃ kāmaguṇānaṃ adhivacanaṃ;‘‘‘Gaharakkhaso’ti kho [sagaho sarakkhasoti kho (bahūsu)], bhikkhave, mātugāmassetaṃ adhivacanaṃ;‘‘‘Paṭisoto’ti kho, bhikkhave, nekkhammassetaṃ adhivacanaṃ;‘‘‘Hatthehi ca pādehi ca vāyāmo’ti kho, bhikkhave, vīriyārambhassetaṃ adhivacanaṃ;
“‘The pool below,’ bhikkhus, is a term for the five lower fetters. ‘The fear of waves,’ bhikkhus, is a term for anger and vexation. ‘The whirlpool,’ bhikkhus, is a term for the five cords of sensual pleasure. ‘The monsters and demons,’ bhikkhus, is a term for womankind. ‘Against the current,’ bhikkhus, is a term for renunciation. ‘Striving with hands and feet,’ bhikkhus, is a term for the arousal of energy.
‘‘‘Cakkhumā puriso tīre ṭhitoti kho, bhikkhave, tathāgatassetaṃ adhivacanaṃ arahato sammāsambuddhassā’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
“‘The man with good sight standing on the bank,’ bhikkhus, is a term for the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One.” The Blessed One spoke this matter. On this it is said:
‘‘Sahāpi dukkhena jaheyya kāme, yogakkhemaṃ āyatiṃ patthayāno;Sammappajāno suvimuttacitto, vimuttiyā phassaye tattha tattha;Sa vedagū vūsitabrahmacariyo, lokantagū pāragatoti vuccatī’’ti.
One should abandon sensual pleasures even if with pain, aspiring for future security from bondage. With right understanding, with mind well-liberated, one would touch liberation in every respect. One who has the final knowledge, has lived the spiritual life, has gone to the world’s end, is called ‘one gone beyond.’
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Dasamaṃ.
This matter, too, was spoken by the Blessed One: so I have heard. Tenth.
