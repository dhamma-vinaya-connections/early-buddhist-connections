# Iti 75 Sukhapatthanāsuttaṃ

7.The Sutta on Wishing for Happiness
76. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
76.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, and so I have heard:
‘‘Tīṇimāni, bhikkhave, sukhāni patthayamāno sīlaṃ rakkheyya paṇḍito. Katamāni tīṇi? Pasaṃsā me āgacchatūti [āgacchantūti (syā.)] sīlaṃ rakkheyya paṇḍito, bhogā me uppajjantūti sīlaṃ rakkheyya paṇḍito, kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjissāmīti sīlaṃ rakkheyya paṇḍito. Imāni kho, bhikkhave, tīṇi sukhāni patthayamāno sīlaṃ rakkheyya paṇḍito’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
"Monks, a wise person, wishing for three kinds of happiness, should guard his virtue. What are the three? 'May praise come to me,' a wise person should guard his virtue. 'May wealth arise for me,' a wise person should guard his virtue. 'With the breakup of the body, after death, may I be reborn in a good destination, a heavenly world,' a wise person should guard his virtue. These, monks, are the three kinds of happiness for which a wise person, wishing for them, should guard his virtue." The Blessed One spoke this matter. In connection with this, it is said:
‘‘Sīlaṃ rakkheyya medhāvī, patthayāno tayo sukhe;Pasaṃsaṃ vittalābhañca, pecca sagge pamodanaṃ.
A wise person, aspiring for three kinds of happiness, should guard their virtue: praise, the acquisition of wealth, and rejoicing in heaven after death.
‘‘Akarontopi ce pāpaṃ, karontamupasevati;Saṅkiyo hoti pāpasmiṃ, avaṇṇo cassa rūhati.
Though one does no evil, if one associates with an evildoer, one is suspected of evil, and a bad reputation grows.
‘‘Yādisaṃ kurute mittaṃ, yādisaṃ cūpasevati;Sa ve tādisako hoti, sahavāso hi [sahavāsopi (sī. ka.)] tādiso.
Whatever kind of friend one makes, whatever person one associates with, one becomes just like them, for such is the nature of companionship.
‘‘Sevamāno sevamānaṃ, samphuṭṭho samphusaṃ paraṃ;Saro diddho kalāpaṃva, alittamupalimpati;Upalepabhayā [upalimpabhayā (ka.)] dhīro, neva pāpasakhā siyā.
Associating with another, in contact with another, one who is unstained is smeared, like a poisoned arrow smearing the quiver. Fearing contamination, the wise person should not have a wicked friend.
‘‘Pūtimacchaṃ kusaggena, yo naro upanayhati;Kusāpi pūti vāyanti, evaṃ bālūpasevanā.
The person who wraps a rotten fish in a blade of kusa grass makes the grass smell rotten too: such is association with fools.
‘‘Tagarañca palāsena, yo naro upanayhati;Pattāpi surabhi vāyanti, evaṃ dhīrūpasevanā.
The person who wraps tagara powder in a leaf makes the leaf smell fragrant too: such is association with the wise.
‘‘Tasmā pattapuṭasseva [palāsapuṭasseva (pī. ka.)], ñatvā sampākamattano;Asante nupaseveyya, sante seveyya paṇḍito;Asanto nirayaṃ nenti, santo pāpenti suggati’’nti.
Therefore, knowing this consequence for oneself as for a container of leaves, a wise person should not associate with the bad but should associate with the good. The bad lead to hell; the good help one reach a good destination.
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Sattamaṃ.
This matter, too, was spoken by the Blessed One, so I have heard. Seventh.
