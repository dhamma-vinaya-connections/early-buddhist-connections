# Iti 62 Addhāsuttaṃ

4.The Sutta on Time
63. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
63.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—so I have heard:
‘‘Tayome, bhikkhave, addhā. Katame tayo? Atīto addhā, anāgato addhā, paccuppanno addhā – ime kho, bhikkhave, tayo addhā’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
"Bhikkhus, there are these three periods of time. What three? The past, the future, and the present. These, bhikkhus, are the three periods of time." The Blessed One spoke this meaning. In connection with this, it is said:
‘‘Akkheyyasaññino sattā, akkheyyasmiṃ patiṭṭhitā;Akkheyyaṃ apariññāya, yogamāyanti maccuno.
"Beings perceive by way of designations, are established in designations; not fully understanding designations, they come under the yoke of Death.
‘‘Akkheyyañca pariññāya, akkhātāraṃ na maññati;Phuṭṭho vimokkho manasā, santipadamanuttaraṃ.
"But having fully understood designation, one does not conceive of an expounder. One has been touched by mental liberation, the unsurpassed state of peace.
‘‘Sa ve [sace (ka.)] akkheyyasampanno, santo santipade rato;Saṅkhāyasevī dhammaṭṭho, saṅkhyaṃ nopeti vedagū’’ti.
"He, accomplished in regard to designation, peaceful, delighting in the state of peace; resorting to comprehension, grounded in the Dhamma, the one who has attained knowledge goes beyond classification."
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Catutthaṃ.
This meaning, too, was spoken by the Blessed One, so I have heard. Fourth.
