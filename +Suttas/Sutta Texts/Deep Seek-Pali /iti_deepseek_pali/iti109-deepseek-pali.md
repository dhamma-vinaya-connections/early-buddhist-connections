# Iti 109 Sampannasīlasuttaṃ

12.The Discourse on Being Accomplished in Virtue
111. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
111.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, and so I have heard:
‘‘Sampannasīlā, bhikkhave, viharatha [hotha (syā.)] sampannapātimokkhā; pātimokkhasaṃvarasaṃvutā viharatha ācāragocarasampannā aṇumattesu vajjesu bhayadassāvino; samādāya sikkhatha sikkhāpadesu.
“Bhikkhus, dwell accomplished in virtue, accomplished in the Pātimokkha. Dwell restrained by the restraint of the Pātimokkha, accomplished in conduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults. Having undertaken them, train in the training rules.
‘‘Sampannasīlānaṃ vo, bhikkhave, viharataṃ [bhavataṃ (syā.)] sampannapātimokkhānaṃ pātimokkhasaṃvarasaṃvutānaṃ viharataṃ ācāragocarasampannānaṃ aṇumattesu vajjesu bhayadassāvīnaṃ samādāya sikkhataṃ sikkhāpadesu kimassa uttari karaṇīyaṃ [kimassa bhikkhave uttari karaṇīyaṃ (sabbattha)]?
“For you, bhikkhus, who dwell accomplished in virtue, accomplished in the Pātimokkha; who dwell restrained by the restraint of the Pātimokkha, accomplished in conduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults; and who, having undertaken them, train in the training rules—what more is there to be done?
‘‘Carato cepi, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno [abhijjhā byāpādo vigato (a. ni. 4.12) aṭṭhakathāya sameti] bhijjhā vigatā [abhijjhā byāpādo vigato (a. ni. 4.12) aṭakathāya sameti] hoti, byāpādo vigato hoti [thinamiddhaṃ uddhaccakukkuccaṃ vicikicchā (a. ni. 4.12)], thinamiddhaṃ vigataṃ hoti, uddhaccakukkuccaṃ vigataṃ hoti, vicikicchā [thinamiddhaṃ uddhaccakukkuccaṃ vicikiccā (a. ni. 4.12)] pahīnā hoti, āraddhaṃ hoti vīriyaṃ asallīnaṃ, upaṭṭhitā sati asammuṭṭhā [appamuṭṭhā (syā.)], passaddho kāyo asāraddho, samāhitaṃ cittaṃ ekaggaṃ. Carampi, bhikkhave, bhikkhu evaṃbhūto ātāpī ottāpī satataṃ samitaṃ āraddhavīriyo pahitattoti vuccati.
“Bhikkhus, if for a bhikkhu who is walking, covetousness is gone, ill will is gone, sloth and torpor are gone, restlessness and remorse are gone, and doubt is abandoned; if his energy is aroused and unflagging, his mindfulness is established and unbewildered, his body is tranquil and undisturbed, and his mind is concentrated and one-pointed—then such a bhikkhu, even while walking, is called ardent, scrupulous, constantly and perpetually with energy aroused, resolute.
‘‘Ṭhitassa cepi, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno abhijjhā vigatā hoti byāpādo…pe… thinamiddhaṃ… uddhaccakukkuccaṃ… vicikicchā pahīnā hoti, āraddhaṃ hoti vīriyaṃ asallīnaṃ, upaṭṭhitā sati asammuṭṭhā, passaddho kāyo asāraddho, samāhitaṃ cittaṃ ekaggaṃ. Ṭhitopi, bhikkhave, bhikkhu evaṃbhūto ātāpī ottāpī satataṃ samitaṃ āraddhavīriyo pahitattoti vuccati.
“Bhikkhus, if for a bhikkhu who is standing, covetousness is gone, ill will is gone, sloth and torpor are gone, restlessness and remorse are gone, and doubt is abandoned; if his energy is aroused and unflagging, his mindfulness is established and unbewildered, his body is tranquil and undisturbed, and his mind is concentrated and one-pointed—then such a bhikkhu, even while standing, is called ardent, scrupulous, constantly and perpetually with energy aroused, resolute.
‘‘Nisinnassa cepi, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno abhijjhā vigatā hoti, byāpādo…pe… thinamiddhaṃ… uddhaccakukkuccaṃ… vicikicchā pahīnā hoti, āraddhaṃ hoti vīriyaṃ asallīnaṃ, upaṭṭhitā sati asammuṭṭhā, passaddho kāyo asāraddho, samāhitaṃ cittaṃ ekaggaṃ. Nisinnopi, bhikkhave, bhikkhu evaṃbhūto ātāpī ottāpī satataṃ samitaṃ āraddhavīriyo pahitattoti vuccati.
“Bhikkhus, if for a bhikkhu who is sitting, covetousness is gone, ill will is gone, sloth and torpor are gone, restlessness and remorse are gone, and doubt is abandoned; if his energy is aroused and unflagging, his mindfulness is established and unbewildered, his body is tranquil and undisturbed, and his mind is concentrated and one-pointed—then such a bhikkhu, even while sitting, is called ardent, scrupulous, constantly and perpetually with energy aroused, resolute.
‘‘Sayānassa cepi, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno jāgarassa abhijjhā vigatā hoti byāpādo…pe… thinamiddhaṃ… uddhaccakukkuccaṃ… vicikicchā pahīnā hoti, āraddhaṃ hoti vīriyaṃ asallīnaṃ, upaṭṭhitā sati asammuṭṭhā, passaddho kāyo asāraddho, samāhitaṃ cittaṃ ekaggaṃ. Sayānopi, bhikkhave, bhikkhu jāgaro evaṃbhūto ātāpī ottāpī satataṃ samitaṃ āraddhavīriyo pahitattoti vuccatī’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
“Bhikkhus, if for a bhikkhu who is lying down awake, covetousness is gone, ill will is gone, sloth and torpor are gone, restlessness and remorse are gone, and doubt is abandoned; if his energy is aroused and unflagging, his mindfulness is established and unbewildered, his body is tranquil and undisturbed, and his mind is concentrated and one-pointed—then such a bhikkhu, even while lying down awake, is called ardent, scrupulous, constantly and perpetually with energy aroused, resolute.” The Blessed One spoke this matter. On this it is said:
‘‘Yataṃ care yataṃ tiṭṭhe, yataṃ acche yataṃ saye;Yataṃ samiñjaye [sammiñjaye (sī. syā.)] bhikkhu, yatamenaṃ pasāraye.
“Restrained a bhikkhu should walk, restrained he should stand;
restrained he should sit, restrained he should lie down;
restrained he should flex his limbs, restrained he should extend them.
‘‘Uddhaṃ tiriyaṃ apācīnaṃ, yāvatā jagato gati;Samavekkhitā ca dhammānaṃ, khandhānaṃ udayabbayaṃ.
“Upward, across, and downward,
as far as the world extends,
he should properly investigate phenomena:
the rise and fall of the aggregates.
‘‘Evaṃ vihārimātāpiṃ, santavuttimanuddhataṃ;Cetosamathasāmīciṃ, sikkhamānaṃ sadā sataṃ;Satataṃ pahitattoti, āhu bhikkhuṃ tathāvidha’’nti.
“One who dwells thus, ardent,
of peaceful conduct, not arrogant,
training always mindful for the fitness of mental calm—
they call such a bhikkhu one who is constantly resolute.”
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Dvādasamaṃ.
This, too, is the meaning of what was said by the Blessed One, and so I have heard. The Twelfth.
