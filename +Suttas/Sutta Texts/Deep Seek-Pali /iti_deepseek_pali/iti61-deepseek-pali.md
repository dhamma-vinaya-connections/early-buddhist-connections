# Iti 61 Indriyasuttaṃ

3.The Sutta on the Faculties
62. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
62.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—so I have heard:
‘‘Tīṇimāni, bhikkhave, indriyāni. Katamāni tīṇi? Anaññātaññassāmītindriyaṃ, aññindriyaṃ, aññātāvindriyaṃ – imāni kho, bhikkhave, tīṇi indriyānī’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
"Bhikkhus, there are these three faculties. What three? The faculty of 'I shall come to know the unknown,' the faculty of final knowledge, and the faculty of one who has final knowledge. These, bhikkhus, are the three faculties." The Blessed One spoke this meaning. In connection with this, it is said:
‘‘Sekhassa sikkhamānassa, ujumaggānusārino;Khayasmiṃ paṭhamaṃ ñāṇaṃ, tato aññā anantarā.
"For a trainee who is training, following the direct path, first comes knowledge in destruction, and immediately after, final knowledge.
‘‘Tato aññā vimuttassa, ñāṇaṃ ve hoti tādino;Akuppā me vimuttīti, bhavasaṃyojanakkhayā.
"Then for one liberated through final knowledge, for such a one, there is the knowledge: ‘My liberation is unshakeable,’ due to the destruction of the fetter of existence.
‘‘Sa ve [sace (sī. syā.)] indriyasampanno, santo santipade rato;Dhāreti antimaṃ dehaṃ, jetvā māraṃ savāhini’’nti.
"He, endowed with the faculties, peaceful, delighting in the state of peace, bears his final body, having conquered Māra with his army."
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Tatiyaṃ.
This meaning, too, was spoken by the Blessed One, so I have heard. Third.
