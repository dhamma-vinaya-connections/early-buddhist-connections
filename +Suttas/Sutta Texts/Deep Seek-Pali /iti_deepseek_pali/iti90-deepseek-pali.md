# Iti 90 Jīvikasuttaṃ

2.The Sutta on Livelihood
91. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
91.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—thus have I heard:
‘‘Antamidaṃ, bhikkhave, jīvikānaṃ yadidaṃ piṇḍolyaṃ. Abhisāpoyaṃ [abhisāpāyaṃ (sī.), abhilāpāyaṃ (syā. pī.), abhisapāyaṃ (ka.)], bhikkhave, lokasmiṃ – ‘piṇḍolo vicarasi pattapāṇī’ti. Tañca kho etaṃ, bhikkhave, kulaputtā upenti atthavasikā, atthavasaṃ paṭicca; neva rājābhinītā, na corābhinītā, na iṇaṭṭā, na bhayaṭṭā, na ājīvikāpakatā. Api ca kho ‘otiṇṇamhā jātiyā jarāya maraṇena sokehi paridevehi dukkhehi domanassehi upāyāsehi dukkhotiṇṇā dukkhaparetā, appeva nāma imassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa antakiriyā paññāyethā’ti. Evaṃ pabbajito cāyaṃ, bhikkhave, kulaputto so ca hoti abhijjhālu kāmesu tibbasārāgo, byāpannacitto paduṭṭhamanasaṅkappo, muṭṭhassati asampajāno asamāhito vibbhantacitto pākatindriyo. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, chavālātaṃ ubhatopadittaṃ majjhe gūthagataṃ neva gāme kaṭṭhatthaṃ pharati na araññeः tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi gihibhogā parihīno sāmaññatthañca na paripūretī’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
“Bhikkhus, this is the lowest of livelihoods, that is, living on alms. This is a curse in the world, bhikkhus: ‘You wander about as an alms-gatherer with a bowl in your hand!’ Yet, bhikkhus, sons of good family undertake this for a reason, based on a reason; not because they have been driven to it by kings or robbers, not because they are in debt or live in fear, not because they have lost their livelihood. Rather, they go forth thinking: ‘We are beset by birth, aging, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair. We are beset by suffering, oppressed by suffering. Surely an end of this whole mass of suffering can be discovered!’ But if, having gone forth thus, that son of good family is covetous, with intense lust for sensual pleasures, with a mind of ill will and corrupt intentions, of confused mindfulness and not clearly comprehending, unconcentrated, with a bewildered mind, with faculties unrestrained—I say that person is like a firebrand from a funeral pyre, burning at both ends and smeared with dung in the middle, which serves as timber neither in the village nor in the forest. Just so, I say, is this person: he has fallen short of the householder’s enjoyments and does not fulfill the purpose of recluseship.” This is the meaning the Blessed One spoke. About this it is said:
‘‘Gihibhogā parihīno, sāmaññatthañca dubbhago;Paridhaṃsamāno pakireti, chavālātaṃva nassati.
“Fallen short of the householder's enjoyments and unfortunate in the goal of recluseship, he wastes away and scatters his gains, perishing like a firebrand from a pyre.
‘‘Kāsāvakaṇṭhā bahavo, pāpadhammā asaññatā;Pāpā pāpehi kammehi, nirayaṃ te upapajjare.
“Many with saffron robes around their necks are of evil character and unrestrained. The evil, through their evil deeds, are reborn in hell.
‘‘Seyyo ayoguḷo bhutto, tatto aggisikhūpamo;Yañce bhuñjeyya dussīlo, raṭṭhapiṇḍamasaññato’’ti.
“Better to eat an iron ball, heated and like a flame of fire, than that an immoral, unrestrained person should eat the country’s alms-food.”
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Dutiyaṃ.
This meaning too was spoken by the Blessed One, so I have heard. Second.
