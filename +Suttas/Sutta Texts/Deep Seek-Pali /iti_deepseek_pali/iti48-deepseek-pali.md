# Iti 48 Diṭṭhigatasuttaṃ

12.The Discourse on Views
49. Vuttañhetaṃ bhagavatā, vuttamarahatāti me sutaṃ –
49.This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant—so I have heard:
‘‘Dvīhi, bhikkhave, diṭṭhigatehi pariyuṭṭhitā devamanussā olīyanti eke, atidhāvanti eke; cakkhumanto ca passanti.
Monks, beings are beset by two views: some shrink back, some rush ahead, and those with vision see.
‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, olīyanti eke? Bhavārāmā, bhikkhave, devamanussā bhavaratā bhavasammuditā tesaṃ bhavanirodhāya dhamme desiyamāne cittaṃ na pakkhandati na pasīdati na santiṭṭhati nādhimuccati. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, olīyanti eke.
And how, monks, do some shrink back? Beings delight in existence, are enamored of existence, rejoice in existence. When the Dhamma is taught for the cessation of existence, their minds do not leap forward, are not pleased, do not settle down, do not gain confidence. Thus, monks, some shrink back.
‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, atidhāvanti eke? Bhaveneva kho paneke aṭṭīyamānā harāyamānā jigucchamānā vibhavaṃ abhinandanti – yato kira, bho, ayaṃ attā [satto (sī. ka.)] kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā ucchijjati vinassati na hoti paraṃ maraṇā; etaṃ santaṃ etaṃ paṇītaṃ etaṃ yāthāvanti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, atidhāvanti eke.
And how, monks, do some rush ahead? Some, weary of existence, humiliated by existence, and disgusted with existence, welcome non-being: 'When this self, at the dissolution of the body after death, is annihilated, perishes, and does not exist after death—that is peaceful, that is excellent, that is as it should be!' Thus, monks, some rush ahead.
‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, cakkhumanto passanti? Idha bhikkhu bhūtaṃ bhūtato passati; bhūtaṃ bhūtato disvā bhūtassa nibbidāya virāgāya nirodhāya paṭipanno hoti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, cakkhumanto passantī’’ti. Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –
And how, monks, do those with vision see? Here, a monk sees what has come to be as what has come to be. Having seen what has come to be as what has come to be, he practices for disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation of what has come to be. Thus, monks, those with vision see." The Blessed One spoke this meaning. In reference to this, it is said:
‘‘Ye [yo (syā. ka.)] bhūtaṃ bhūtato disvā, bhūtassa ca atikkamaṃ;Yathābhūte vimuccanti, bhavataṇhā parikkhayā.
Those who see what has come to be as it actually is, and transcend what has come to be, are freed in accordance with reality, through the destruction of craving for existence.
‘‘Sa ve [sace (ka. sī. syā. pī.)] bhūtapariñño, so vītataṇho bhavābhave;Bhūtassa vibhavā bhikkhu, nāgacchati punabbhava’’nti.
Having fully understood what has come into being, he is without craving for becoming and non-becoming; that monk, through the destruction of becoming, does not come to renewed existence.
Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti. Dvādasamaṃ.
This too is the meaning spoken by the Blessed One, so I have heard. The Twelfth.
Dutiyo vaggo niṭṭhito.
The second chapter is finished.
Tassuddānaṃ –
Its summary:
Dve indriyā dve tapanīyā, sīlena apare duve;Anottāpī kuhanā dve ca, saṃvejanīyena te dasa.
Two faculties, two torments, two others by virtue, two without shame, two by deceit—those ten inspire reflection.
Vitakkā desanā vijjā, paññā dhammena pañcamaṃ;Ajātaṃ dhātusallānaṃ, sikkhā jāgariyena ca;Apāyadiṭṭhiyā ceva [yeva (sī. syā.)], bāvīsati pakāsitāti.
Consideration, teaching, knowledge, wisdom, and the fifth by Dhamma; the unborn, elemental darts, training, and vigilance; and also Apāyika and Diṭṭhigata—thus twenty-two are explained.
Dukanipāto niṭṭhito.
The Duka Nipāta is finished.
