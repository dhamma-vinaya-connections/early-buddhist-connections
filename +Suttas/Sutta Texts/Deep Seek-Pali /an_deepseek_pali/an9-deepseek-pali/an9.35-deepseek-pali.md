35. ‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, gāvī pabbateyyā bālā abyattā akhettaññū akusalā visame pabbate carituṃ. Tassā evamassa – ‘yaṃnūnāhaṃ agatapubbañceva disaṃ gaccheyyaṃ, akhāditapubbāni ca tiṇāni khādeyyaṃ, apītapubbāni ca pānīyāni piveyya’nti.

Taṃ kissa hetu? Tathā hi sā, bhikkhave, gāvī pabbateyyā bālā abyattā akhettaññū akusalā visame pabbate carituṃ.

35.“Bhikkhus, suppose there was a mountain cow—foolish, inexperienced, unfamiliar with the terrain, and unskilled in roaming on rugged mountains. It might occur to her: ‘What if I were to go to a region I have never gone to before, eat grass I have never eaten before, and drink water I have never drunk before?’ Without having firmly planted her front foot, she would lift her back foot. She would not get to go to a region she had never gone to before, nor get to eat grass she had never eaten before, nor get to drink water she had never drunk before. And from the spot where she stood when it occurred to her, ‘What if I were to go to a region I have never gone to before, eat grass I have never eaten before, and drink water I have never drunk before?,’ she would not return safely to that same spot. For what reason? Because that mountain cow is foolish, inexperienced, unfamiliar with the terrain, and unskilled in roaming on rugged mountains. So too, bhikkhus, some bhikkhu here—foolish, inexperienced, unfamiliar with the terrain, and unskilled—quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by directed thought and evaluation, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion. He does not cultivate that sign, develop it, make much of it, or establish it well.”

‘‘Tassa evaṃ hoti – ‘yaṃnūnāhaṃ vitakkavicārānaṃ vūpasamā ajjhattaṃ sampasādanaṃ cetaso ekodibhāvaṃ avitakkaṃ avicāraṃ samādhijaṃ pītisukhaṃ dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja vihareyya’nti. So na sakkoti vitakkavicārānaṃ vūpasamā…pe… dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharituṃ. Tassa evaṃ hoti – ‘yaṃnūnāhaṃ vivicceva kāmehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja vihareyya’nti. So na sakkoti vivicceva kāmehi…pe… paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharituṃ. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, ‘bhikkhu ubhato bhaṭṭho ubhato parihīno, seyyathāpi sā gāvī pabbateyyā bālā abyattā akhettaññū akusalā visame pabbate carituṃ’’’.

“It occurs to him: ‘What if, with the stilling of directed thought and evaluation, I were to enter and dwell in the second jhāna, which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is without directed thought and evaluation, and has rapture and happiness born of concentration?’ But he is unable, with the stilling of directed thought and evaluation… to enter and dwell in the second jhāna. It occurs to him: ‘What if, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states… I were to enter and dwell in the first jhāna?’ But he is unable, quite secluded from sensual pleasures… to enter and dwell in the first jhāna. This bhikkhu, bhikkhus, is said to have fallen from both and lost both, just like that foolish, inexperienced, unfamiliar, and unskilled mountain cow roaming on rugged mountains.”

‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, gāvī pabbateyyā paṇḍitā byattā khettaññū kusalā visame pabbate carituṃ. Tassā evamassa – ‘yaṃnūnāhaṃ agatapubbañceva disaṃ gaccheyyaṃ, akhāditapubbāni ca tiṇāni khādeyyaṃ, apītapubbāni ca pānīyāni piveyya’nti. Sā purimaṃ pādaṃ suppatiṭṭhitaṃ patiṭṭhāpetvā pacchimaṃ pādaṃ uddhareyya. Sā agatapubbañceva disaṃ gaccheyya, akhāditapubbāni ca tiṇāni khādeyya, apītapubbāni ca pānīyāni piveyya. Yasmiṃ cassā padese ṭhitāya evamassa – ‘yaṃnūnāhaṃ agatapubbañceva disaṃ gaccheyyaṃ, akhāditapubbāni ca tiṇāni khādeyyaṃ, apītapubbāni ca pānīyāni piveyya’nti tañca padesaṃ sotthinā paccāgaccheyya. Taṃ kissa hetu? Tathā hi sā, bhikkhave, gāvī pabbateyyā paṇḍitā byattā khettaññū kusalā visame pabbate carituṃ.

So taṃ nimittaṃ āsevati bhāveti bahulīkaroti svādhiṭṭhitaṃ adhiṭṭhāti.

“Bhikkhus, suppose there was a mountain cow—wise, competent, familiar with the terrain, and skilled in roaming on rugged mountains. It might occur to her: ‘What if I were to go to a region I have never gone to before, eat grass I have never eaten before, and drink water I have never drunk before?’ Having firmly planted her front foot, she would lift her back foot. She would get to go to a region she had never gone to before, get to eat grass she had never eaten before, and get to drink water she had never drunk before. And from the spot where she stood when it occurred to her, ‘What if I were to go to a region I have never gone to before…,’ she would return safely to that same spot. For what reason?

So too, bhikkhus, some bhikkhu here—wise, competent, familiar with the terrain, and skilled—quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by directed thought and evaluation, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion.

So dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ anabhihiṃsamāno vitakkavicārānaṃ vūpasamā… dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati. So taṃ nimittaṃ āsevati bhāveti bahulīkaroti svādhiṭṭhitaṃ adhiṭṭhāti.
