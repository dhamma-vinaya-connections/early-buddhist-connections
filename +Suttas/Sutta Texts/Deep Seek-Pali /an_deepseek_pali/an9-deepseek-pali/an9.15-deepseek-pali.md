## AN 9.15 The Boil Sutta

15. ‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, gaṇḍo anekavassagaṇiko. Tassassu gaṇḍassa nava vaṇamukhāni nava abhedanamukhāni. Tato yaṃ kiñci pagghareyya – asuciyeva pagghareyya, duggandhaṃyeva pagghareyya, jegucchiyaṃyeva [jegucchiyeva (ka.)] pagghareyya; yaṃ kiñci pasaveyya – asuciyeva pasaveyya, duggandhaṃyeva pasaveyya, jegucchiyaṃyeva pasaveyya.

15.“Monks, suppose there were a boil that had lasted many years. And that boil had nine wound-openings, nine discharge-openings. Whatever would seep from it—only impurity would seep, only foul odor would seep, only repugnance would seep; whatever would discharge from it—only impurity would discharge, only foul odor would discharge, only repugnance would discharge.

‘‘Gaṇḍoti kho, bhikkhave, imassetaṃ cātumahābhūtikassa [cātummahābhūtikassa (sī. syā. pī.)] kāyassa adhivacanaṃ mātāpettikasambhavassa odanakummāsūpacayassa aniccucchādanaparimaddanabhedanaviddhaṃsanadhammassa. Tassassu gaṇḍassa nava vaṇamukhāni nava abhedanamukhāni. Tato yaṃ kiñci paggharati – asuciyeva paggharati, duggandhaṃyeva paggharati, jegucchiyaṃyeva paggharati; yaṃ kiñci pasavati – asuciyeva pasavati, duggandhaṃyeva pasavati, jegucchiyaṃyeva pasavati. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, imasmiṃ kāye nibbindathā’’ti. Pañcamaṃ.

“‘Boil’ is a designation for this body, monks, composed of the four great elements, born of mother and father, nourished by rice and gruel, subject to being rubbed down, massaged, broken apart, and disintegrated. Now this boil has nine wound-openings, nine discharge-openings. Whatever oozes from it oozes what is impure, oozes what is foul-smelling, oozes what is disgusting. Whatever flows from it flows what is impure, flows what is foul-smelling, flows what is disgusting. Therefore, monks, be repelled by this body.” The fifth.
