## AN 9.41 Tapussa

41. Ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā mallesu viharati uruvelakappaṃ nāma mallānaṃ nigamo. Atha kho bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya uruvelakappaṃ piṇḍāya pāvisi. Uruvelakappe piṇḍāya caritvā pacchābhattaṃ piṇḍapātapaṭikkanto āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ āmantesi – ‘‘idheva tāva tvaṃ, ānanda, hohi, yāvāhaṃ mahāvanaṃ ajjhogāhāmi divāvihārāyā’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti kho āyasmā ānando bhagavato paccassosi. Atha kho bhagavā mahāvanaṃ ajjhogāhetvā aññatarasmiṃ rukkhamūle divāvihāraṃ nisīdi.

41.At one time the Blessed One was dwelling among the Mallas, in a town of the Mallas named Uruvelakappa. Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe and entered Uruvelakappa for alms. Having walked for alms in Uruvelakappa, after the meal, on returning from his alms round, he addressed the Venerable Ānanda: 'Stay here for now, Ānanda, while I enter the Great Wood for the day's abiding.' 'Yes, venerable sir,' the Venerable Ānanda replied to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One entered the Great Wood and sat down at the foot of a certain tree for the day's abiding.

Atha kho tapusso gahapati yenāyasmā ānando tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho tapusso gahapati āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ etadavoca –

Then the householder Tapussa approached the Venerable Ānanda; having approached, he paid homage to the Venerable Ānanda and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the householder Tapussa said this to the Venerable Ānanda:

‘‘Mayaṃ, bhante ānanda, gihī kāmabhogino kāmārāmā kāmaratā kāmasammuditā. Tesaṃ no, bhante, amhākaṃ gihīnaṃ kāmabhogīnaṃ kāmārāmānaṃ kāmaratānaṃ kāmasammuditānaṃ papāto viya khāyati, yadidaṃ nekkhammaṃ. Sutaṃ metaṃ, bhante, ‘imasmiṃ dhammavinaye daharānaṃ daharānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ nekkhamme cittaṃ pakkhandati pasīdati santiṭṭhati vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato’ [passataṃ (?)]. Tayidaṃ, bhante, imasmiṃ dhammavinaye bhikkhūnaṃ bahunā janena visabhāgo, yadidaṃ nekkhamma’’nti.

'Venerable Ānanda, we are householders enjoying sensual pleasures, delighting in sensual pleasures, rejoicing in sensual pleasures, and enraptured by sensual pleasures. For us, venerable sir, householders enjoying sensual pleasures, delighting in sensual pleasures, rejoicing in sensual pleasures, and enraptured by sensual pleasures, this renunciation seems like a precipice. But we have heard, venerable sir: ‘In this Dhamma and Discipline, the minds of very young bhikkhus leap up to renunciation, become confident, settled, and are released into it, seeing it as peace.’ This, venerable sir, is the great dissimilarity between the bhikkhus in this Dhamma and Discipline and the multitude, that is, renunciation.'

‘‘Atthi kho etaṃ, gahapati, kathāpābhataṃ bhagavantaṃ dassanāya. Āyāma, gahapati, yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamissāma; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocessāma. Yathā no bhagavā byākarissati tathā naṃ dhāressāmā’’ti.

'This is a fitting topic of conversation, householder, to bring to the Blessed One for an audience. Come, householder, let us approach the Blessed One. Having approached him, we will report this matter to the Blessed One. As the Blessed One explains it to us, so we will bear it in mind.'

‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti kho tapusso gahapati āyasmato ānandassa paccassosi. Atha kho āyasmā ānando tapussena gahapatinā saddhiṃ yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā ānando bhagavantaṃ etadavoca –

'Yes, venerable sir,' the householder Tapussa replied to the Venerable Ānanda. Then the Venerable Ānanda, together with the householder Tapussa, approached the Blessed One; having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Ānanda said this to the Blessed One:

‘‘Ayaṃ, bhante, tapusso gahapati evamāha – ‘mayaṃ, bhante ānanda, gihī kāmabhogino kāmārāmā kāmaratā kāmasammuditā, tesaṃ no bhante, amhākaṃ gihīnaṃ kāmabhogīnaṃ kāmārāmānaṃ kāmaratānaṃ kāmasammuditānaṃ papāto viya khāyati, yadidaṃ nekkhammaṃ’. Sutaṃ metaṃ, bhante, ‘imasmiṃ dhammavinaye daharānaṃ daharānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ nekkhamme cittaṃ pakkhandati pasīdati santiṭṭhati vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato. Tayidaṃ, bhante, imasmiṃ dhammavinaye bhikkhūnaṃ bahunā janena visabhāgo yadidaṃ nekkhamma’’’nti.

'Venerable sir, this householder Tapussa says as follows: ‘Venerable Ānanda, we are householders enjoying sensual pleasures, delighting in sensual pleasures, rejoicing in sensual pleasures, and enraptured by sensual pleasures. For us, venerable sir, householders enjoying sensual pleasures, delighting in sensual pleasures, rejoicing in sensual pleasures, and enraptured by sensual pleasures, this renunciation seems like a precipice. But we have heard, venerable sir: “In this Dhamma and Discipline, the minds of very young bhikkhus leap up to renunciation, become confident, settled, and are released into it, seeing it as peace.” This, venerable sir, is the great dissimilarity between the bhikkhus in this Dhamma and Discipline and the multitude, that is, renunciation.’'

‘‘Evametaṃ, ānanda, evametaṃ, ānanda! Mayhampi kho, ānanda, pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato etadahosi – ‘sādhu nekkhammaṃ, sādhu paviveko’ti. Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, nekkhamme cittaṃ na pakkhandati nappasīdati na santiṭṭhati na vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato. Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, etadahosi – ‘ko nu kho hetu ko paccayo, yena me nekkhamme cittaṃ na pakkhandati nappasīdati na santiṭṭhati na vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato’? Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, etadahosi – ‘kāmesu kho me ādīnavo adiṭṭho, so ca me abahulīkato, nekkhamme ca ānisaṃso anadhigato, so ca me anāsevito. Tasmā me nekkhamme cittaṃ na pakkhandati nappasīdati na santiṭṭhati na vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato’. Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, etadahosi – ‘sace kho ahaṃ kāmesu ādīnavaṃ disvā taṃ bahulaṃ kareyyaṃ [bahulīkareyyaṃ (sī. syā. pī.)], nekkhamme ānisaṃsaṃ adhigamma tamāseveyyaṃ, ṭhānaṃ kho panetaṃ vijjati yaṃ me nekkhamme cittaṃ pakkhandeyya pasīdeyya santiṭṭheyya vimucceyya etaṃ santanti passato’. So kho ahaṃ, ānanda, aparena samayena kāmesu ādīnavaṃ disvā taṃ bahulamakāsiṃ, nekkhamme ānisaṃsaṃ adhigamma tamāseviṃ. Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, nekkhamme cittaṃ pakkhandati pasīdati santiṭṭhati vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato. So kho ahaṃ, ānanda, vivicceva kāmehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharāmi. Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, iminā vihārena viharato kāmasahagatā saññāmanasikārā samudācaranti. Svassa me hoti ābādho. Seyyathāpi, ānanda, sukhino dukkhaṃ uppajjeyya yāvadeva ābādhāya; evamevassa me kāmasahagatā saññāmanasikārā samudācaranti. Svassa me hoti ābādho.

'So it is, Ānanda! So it is, Ānanda! For I too, Ānanda, before my enlightenment, while I was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta, thought: ‘Renunciation is good; seclusion is good.’ But my mind did not leap up to renunciation, did not become confident, did not settle upon it, and was not released into it, though I saw it as ‘peace.’ It occurred to me, Ānanda: ‘What is the cause, what is the reason, why my mind does not leap up to renunciation, does not become confident, does not settle upon it, and is not released into it, though I see it as “peace”?’ Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in sensual pleasures, and I have not made much of it; and I have not gained the benefit of renunciation, and I have not pursued it. That is why my mind does not leap up to renunciation, does not become confident, does not settle upon it, and is not released into it, though I see it as “peace.”’ Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘If I were to see the danger in sensual pleasures and make much of it, and if I were to gain the benefit of renunciation and pursue it, it is possible that my mind would leap up to renunciation, become confident, settle upon it, and be released into it, seeing it as “peace.”’ Then, Ānanda, at a later time, having seen the danger in sensual pleasures, I made much of it; having gained the benefit of renunciation, I pursued it. Then my mind leaped up to renunciation, became confident, settled upon it, and was released into it, seeing it as ‘peace.’ Then, Ānanda, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I entered and dwelled in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. But while I was dwelling thus, perceptions and attentions accompanied by the sensual still arose in me. That was an affliction for me. Just as pain might arise for one who is happy, solely for his affliction, so too those perceptions and attentions accompanied by the sensual arose in me as an affliction.'

‘‘Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, etadahosi – ‘yaṃnūnāhaṃ vitakkavicārānaṃ vūpasamā…pe… dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja vihareyya’nti. Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, avitakke cittaṃ na pakkhandati nappasīdati na santiṭṭhati na vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato. Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, etadahosi – ‘ko nu kho hetu ko paccayo, yena me avitakke cittaṃ na pakkhandati nappasīdati na santiṭṭhati na vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato’? Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, etadahosi – ‘vitakkesu kho me ādīnavo adiṭṭho, so ca me abahulīkato, avitakke ca ānisaṃso anadhigato, so ca me anāsevito. Tasmā me avitakke cittaṃ na pakkhandati nappasīdati na santiṭṭhati na vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato’. Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, etadahosi – ‘sace kho ahaṃ vitakkesu ādīnavaṃ disvā taṃ bahulaṃ kareyyaṃ, avitakke ānisaṃsaṃ adhigamma tamāseveyyaṃ, ṭhānaṃ kho panetaṃ vijjati yaṃ me avitakke cittaṃ pakkhandeyya pasīdeyya santiṭṭheyya vimucceyya etaṃ santanti passato’. So kho ahaṃ, ānanda, aparena samayena vitakkesu ādīnavaṃ disvā taṃ bahulamakāsiṃ, avitakke ānisaṃsaṃ adhigamma tamāseviṃ. Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, avitakke cittaṃ pakkhandati pasīdati santiṭṭhati vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato. So kho ahaṃ, ānanda, vitakkavicārānaṃ vūpasamā…pe… dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharāmi. Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, iminā vihārena viharato vitakkasahagatā saññāmanasikārā samudācaranti. Svassa me hoti ābādho. Seyyathāpi, ānanda, sukhino dukkhaṃ uppajjeyya yāvadeva ābādhāya; evamevassa me vitakkasahagatā saññāmanasikārā samudācaranti. Svassa me hoti ābādho.

'Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘What if, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, I were to enter and dwell in the second jhāna?’ But my mind did not leap up to the state without applied thought, did not become confident, did not settle upon it, and was not released into it, though I saw it as ‘peace.’ It occurred to me, Ānanda: ‘What is the cause, what is the reason, why my mind does not leap up to the state without applied thought...?’ Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in applied thought, and I have not made much of it; and I have not gained the benefit of the state without applied thought, and I have not pursued it. That is why my mind does not leap up to the state without applied thought....’ Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘If I were to see the danger in applied thought and make much of it, and if I were to gain the benefit of the state without applied thought and pursue it, it is possible that my mind would leap up to the state without applied thought...’ Then, Ānanda, at a later time, having seen the danger in applied thought, I made much of it; having gained the benefit of the state without applied thought, I pursued it. Then my mind leaped up to the state without applied thought, became confident, settled upon it, and was released into it, seeing it as ‘peace.’ Then, Ānanda, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought... I entered and dwelled in the second jhāna. But while I was dwelling thus, perceptions and attentions accompanied by applied thought still arose in me. That was an affliction for me. Just as pain might arise for one who is happy, solely for his affliction, so too those perceptions and attentions accompanied by applied thought arose in me as an affliction.'

‘‘Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, etadahosi – ‘yaṃnūnāhaṃ pītiyā ca virāgā upekkhako ca vihareyyaṃ sato ca sampajāno sukhañca kāyena paṭisaṃvedeyyaṃ yaṃ taṃ ariyā ācikkhanti – upekkhako satimā sukhavihārīti tatiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja vihareyya’nti. Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, nippītike cittaṃ na pakkhandati nappasīdati na santiṭṭhati na vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato. Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, etadahosi – ‘ko nu kho hetu ko paccayo, yena me nippītike cittaṃ na pakkhandati nappasīdati na santiṭṭhati na vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato’?

So kho ahaṃ, ānanda, aparena samayena pītiyā ādīnavaṃ disvā taṃ bahulamakāsiṃ, nippītike ānisaṃsaṃ adhigamma tamāseviṃ. Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, nippītike cittaṃ pakkhandati pasīdati santiṭṭhati vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato. So kho ahaṃ, ānanda, pītiyā ca virāgā…pe… tatiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharāmi. Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, iminā vihārena viharato pītisahagatā saññāmanasikārā samudācaranti. Svassa me hoti ābādho. Seyyathāpi, ānanda, sukhino dukkhaṃ uppajjeyya yāvadeva ābādhāya; evamevassa me pītisahagatā saññāmanasikārā samudācaranti. Svassa me hoti ābādho.

Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘What if, with the fading away of rapture, I were to dwell equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending, and experience happiness with the body, entering and dwelling in the third jhāna, of which the noble ones declare: “Equanimous and mindful, one dwells happily”?’ But, Ānanda, my mind did not leap up to the state without rapture, did not find confidence in it, did not settle upon it, and was not liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘What is the cause, what is the reason, why my mind does not leap up to the state without rapture, find confidence in it, settle upon it, or become liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in rapture, nor have I made much of it; I have not realized the benefit of the state without rapture, nor have I developed it. That is why my mind does not leap up to the state without rapture, does not find confidence in it, does not settle upon it, and is not liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.’ Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘If I were to see the danger in rapture and make much of it, and realize the benefit of the state without rapture and develop it, it is possible that my mind would leap up to the state without rapture, find confidence in it, settle upon it, and be liberated in it, seeing it as peaceful.’ So, Ānanda, on a later occasion, having seen the danger in rapture, I made much of it; having realized the benefit of the state without rapture, I developed it. Then, Ānanda, my mind leapt up to the state without rapture, found confidence in it, settled upon it, and was liberated in it, seeing it as peaceful. With the fading away of rapture… I enter and dwell in the third jhāna. While I am dwelling in this attainment, perceptions and thoughts accompanied by rapture arise in me. That is an affliction for me. Just as, Ānanda, pain might arise as an affliction for a person who is happy, so too those perceptions and thoughts accompanied by rapture arise as an affliction for me.

‘‘Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, etadahosi – ‘yaṃnūnāhaṃ sukhassa ca pahānā dukkhassa ca pahānā pubbeva somanassadomanassānaṃ atthaṅgamā adukkhamasukhaṃ upekkhāsatipārisuddhiṃ catutthaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja vihareyya’nti.

Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘What if, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and displeasure, I were to enter and dwell in the fourth jhāna, which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant and has purity of mindfulness due to equanimity?’ But, Ānanda, my mind did not leap up to the neither-painful-nor-pleasant state, did not find confidence in it, did not settle upon it, and was not liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘What is the cause, what is the reason, why my mind does not leap up to the neither-painful-nor-pleasant state, find confidence in it, settle upon it, or become liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in the happiness of equanimity, nor have I made much of it; I have not realized the benefit in the neither-painful-nor-pleasant state, nor have I developed it. That is why my mind does not leap up to the neither-painful-nor-pleasant state, does not find confidence in it, does not settle upon it, and is not liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.’ Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘If I were to see the danger in the happiness of equanimity and make much of it, and realize the benefit in the neither-painful-nor-pleasant state and develop it, it is possible that my mind would leap up to the neither-painful-nor-pleasant state, find confidence in it, settle upon it, and be liberated in it, seeing it as peaceful.’ So, Ānanda, on a later occasion, I saw the danger in the happiness of equanimity and made much of it; I realized the benefit in the neither-painful-nor-pleasant state and developed it. Then, Ānanda, my mind leapt up to the neither-painful-nor-pleasant state, found confidence in it, settled upon it, and was liberated in it, seeing it as peaceful. With the abandoning of pleasure and pain… I enter and dwell in the fourth jhāna. While I am dwelling in this attainment, perceptions and thoughts accompanied by equanimity arise in me. That is an affliction for me. Just as, Ānanda, pain might arise as an affliction for a person who is happy, so too those perceptions and thoughts accompanied by equanimity arise as an affliction for me.

Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘What if, by completely transcending perceptions of form, with the passing away of perceptions of resistance, and by not attending to perceptions of diversity, aware that “Space is infinite,” I were to enter and dwell in the base of infinite space?’ But, Ānanda, my mind did not leap up to the base of infinite space, did not find confidence in it, did not settle upon it, and was not liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘What is the cause, what is the reason, why my mind does not leap up to the base of infinite space, find confidence in it, settle upon it, or become liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in forms, nor have I made much of it; I have not realized the benefit in the base of infinite space, nor have I developed it.

Then, Ānanda, my mind leapt up to the base of infinite space, found confidence in it, settled upon it, and was liberated in it, seeing it as peaceful. By completely transcending perceptions of form… I enter and dwell in the base of infinite space. While I am dwelling in this attainment, perceptions and thoughts accompanied by form arise in me. That is an affliction for me. Just as, Ānanda, pain might arise as an affliction for a person who is happy, so too those perceptions and thoughts accompanied by form arise as an affliction for me.

Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘Suppose that by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, I might enter and dwell in the base of the infinity of consciousness, aware that “consciousness is infinite.”’ But my mind did not enter into, find confidence in, become steady in, or become liberated in the base of the infinity of consciousness, when I saw it as peaceful. Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘What is the cause, what is the reason, why my mind does not enter into, find confidence in, become steady in, or become liberated in the base of the infinity of consciousness, when I see it as peaceful?’ Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in the base of the infinity of space, nor have I made much of it. And I have not realized the benefit in the base of the infinity of consciousness, nor have I developed it. That is why my mind does not enter into, find confidence in, become steady in, or become liberated in the base of the infinity of consciousness, when I see it as peaceful.’ Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘If I were to see the danger in the base of the infinity of space and make much of it, and if I were to realize the benefit in the base of the infinity of consciousness and develop it, then it is possible that my mind would enter into, find confidence in, become steady in, and become liberated in the base of the infinity of consciousness, when I see it as peaceful.’ So then, Ānanda, on a later occasion, I saw the danger in the base of the infinity of space and made much of it, and I realized the benefit in the base of the infinity of consciousness and developed it. Then, Ānanda, my mind entered into, found confidence in, became steady in, and became liberated in the base of the infinity of consciousness, when I saw it as peaceful. Thus, Ānanda, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, I entered and dwelled in the base of the infinity of consciousness, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite.’ But while I was dwelling with this attainment, perceptions and instances of attention accompanied by the base of the infinity of space arose in me. This was an affliction for me. Just as, Ānanda, pain might arise for a person who is happy, serving only as an affliction, so too, perceptions and instances of attention accompanied by the base of the infinity of space arose in me. This was an affliction for me.

“Ānanda, so long as I had not entered upon and emerged from these nine successive meditative attainments in forward and reverse order, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect self-enlightenment in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, with its devas and humans.

Knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘My liberation of mind is unshakable; this is the last birth; now there is no further becoming.’” The tenth.
