## AN 9.22 Unruly Horses

22. [a. ni. 3.141] ‘‘Tayo ca, bhikkhave, assakhaḷuṅke desessāmi tayo ca purisakhaḷuṅke tayo ca assaparasse [assasadasse (sī. syā. pī.) a. ni. 3.142] tayo ca purisaparasse [purisasadasse (sī. syā. pī.)] tayo ca bhadde assājānīye tayo ca bhadde purisājānīye. Taṃ suṇātha.

22.Bhikkhus, I will teach you the three kinds of unruly horses and the three kinds of unruly persons; the three kinds of superior horses and the three kinds of superior persons; and the three kinds of fine thoroughbred horses and the three kinds of fine thoroughbred persons. Listen to that.

‘‘Katame ca, bhikkhave, tayo assakhaḷuṅkā? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco assakhaḷuṅko javasampanno hoti, na vaṇṇasampanno, na ārohapariṇāhasampanno. Idha pana, bhikkhave, ekacco assakhaḷuṅko javasampanno ca hoti vaṇṇasampanno ca, na ārohapariṇāhasampanno. Idha pana, bhikkhave, ekacco assakhaḷuṅko javasampanno ca hoti vaṇṇasampanno ca ārohapariṇāhasampanno ca. Ime kho, bhikkhave, tayo assakhaḷuṅkā.

And what, bhikkhus, are the three unruly horses? Here, bhikkhus, some unruly horse is endowed with speed, but not with beauty nor with stature and build. Then, bhikkhus, some unruly horse is endowed with speed and beauty, but not with stature and build. Then, bhikkhus, some unruly horse is endowed with speed, beauty, and stature and build. These, bhikkhus, are the three unruly horses.

‘‘Katame ca, bhikkhave, tayo purisakhaḷuṅkā? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco purisakhaḷuṅko javasampanno hoti, na vaṇṇasampanno, na ārohapariṇāhasampanno. Idha pana, bhikkhave, ekacco purisakhaḷuṅko javasampanno ca hoti vaṇṇasampanno ca, na ārohapariṇāhasampanno. Idha pana, bhikkhave, ekacco purisakhaḷuṅko javasampanno ca hoti vaṇṇasampanno ca ārohapariṇāhasampanno ca.

And what, bhikkhus, are the three unruly persons? Here, bhikkhus, some unruly person is endowed with speed, but not with beauty nor with stature and build. Then, bhikkhus, some unruly person is endowed with speed and beauty, but not with stature and build. Then, bhikkhus, some unruly person is endowed with speed, beauty, and stature and build.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, purisakhaḷuṅko javasampanno hoti, na vaṇṇasampanno na ārohapariṇāhasampanno? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti, ‘ayaṃ dukkhasamudayo’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti, ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodho’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti, ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Idamassa javasmiṃ vadāmi. Abhidhamme kho pana abhivinaye pañhaṃ puṭṭho saṃsādeti [saṃsāreti (ka.) a. ni. 1.3.141], no vissajjeti. Idamassa na vaṇṇasmiṃ vadāmi. Na kho pana lābhī hoti cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhārānaṃ. Idamassa na ārohapariṇāhasmiṃ vadāmi. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, purisakhaḷuṅko javasampanno hoti, na vaṇṇasampanno na ārohapariṇāhasampanno.

And how, bhikkhus, is an unruly person endowed with speed, but not with beauty nor with stature and build? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: ‘This is suffering’; he understands as it really is: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; he understands as it really is: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; he understands as it really is: ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’ This, I say, is his speed. But when asked a question on the higher Dhamma and the higher Vinaya, he gets bogged down and cannot answer. This, I say, is not his beauty. And he is not a recipient of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. This, I say, is not his stature and build. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that an unruly person is endowed with speed, but not with beauty nor with stature and build.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, purisakhaḷuṅko javasampanno ca hoti vaṇṇasampanno ca, na ārohapariṇāhasampanno? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti…pe… ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Idamassa javasmiṃ vadāmi. Abhidhamme kho pana abhivinaye pañhaṃ puṭṭho vissajjeti, no saṃsādeti. Idamassa vaṇṇasmiṃ vadāmi. Na kho pana lābhī hoti cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhārānaṃ. Idamassa na ārohapariṇāhasmiṃ vadāmi. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, purisakhaḷuṅko javasampanno ca hoti vaṇṇasampanno ca, na ārohapariṇāhasampanno.

And how, bhikkhus, is an unruly person endowed with speed and beauty, but not with stature and build? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’ This, I say, is his speed. And when asked a question on the higher Dhamma and the higher Vinaya, he answers and does not get bogged down. This, I say, is his beauty. But he is not a recipient of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. This, I say, is not his stature and build. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that an unruly person is endowed with speed and beauty, but not with stature and build.

Abhidhamme kho pana abhivinaye pañhaṃ puṭṭho vissajjeti, no saṃsādeti. Idamassa vaṇṇasmiṃ vadāmi. Lābhī kho pana hoti cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhārānaṃ. Idamassa ārohapariṇāhasmiṃ vadāmi. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, purisakhaḷuṅko javasampanno ca hoti vaṇṇasampanno ca ārohapariṇāhasampanno ca. Ime kho, bhikkhave, tayo purisakhaḷuṅkā.

It is in this way, bhikkhus, that an unruly person is endowed with speed, beauty, and stature and build. These, bhikkhus, are the three unruly persons.

‘‘Katame ca, bhikkhave, tayo assaparassā? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco assaparasso…pe… javasampanno ca hoti vaṇṇasampanno ca ārohapariṇāhasampanno ca. Ime kho, bhikkhave, tayo assaparassā.

And what, bhikkhus, are the three superior horses? There is the case where a superior horse is endowed with speed; another is endowed with speed and beauty; and another is endowed with speed, beauty, and stature and build. These, bhikkhus, are the three superior horses.

Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu pañcannaṃ orambhāgiyānaṃ saṃyojanānaṃ parikkhayā opapātiko hoti, tattha parinibbāyī anāvattidhammo tasmā lokā. Idamassa javasmiṃ vadāmi. Abhidhamme kho pana abhivinaye pañhaṃ puṭṭho vissajjeti, no saṃsādeti. Idamassa vaṇṇasmiṃ vadāmi. Lābhī kho pana hoti cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhārānaṃ. Idamassa ārohapariṇāhasmiṃ vadāmi. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, purisaparasso javasampanno ca hoti vaṇṇasampanno ca ārohapariṇāhasampanno ca. Ime kho, bhikkhave, tayo purisaparassā.

And how, bhikkhus, is a superior person endowed with speed, beauty, and stature and build? Here, bhikkhus, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, a bhikkhu is reborn spontaneously, due to attain final Nibbāna there, not subject to return from that world. This, I say, is his speed. When asked a question on the higher Dhamma and the higher Vinaya, he answers and does not get bogged down. This, I say, is his beauty. He is a recipient of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. This, I say, is his stature and build. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a superior person is endowed with speed, beauty, and stature and build. These, bhikkhus, are the three superior persons.

‘‘Katame ca, bhikkhave, tayo bhaddā assājānīyā? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco bhaddo assājānīyo…pe… javasampanno ca hoti vaṇṇasampanno ca ārohapariṇāhasampanno ca. Ime kho, bhikkhave, tayo bhaddā assājānīyā.

And what, bhikkhus, are the three fine thoroughbred persons? There is the case where a fine thoroughbred person is endowed with speed; another is endowed with speed and beauty; and another is endowed with speed, beauty, and stature and build.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhaddo purisājānīyo…pe… javasampanno ca hoti vaṇṇasampanno ca ārohapariṇāhasampanno ca? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu āsavānaṃ khayā anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ paññāvimuttiṃ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharati. Idamassa javasmiṃ vadāmi.

And how, bhikkhus, is an excellent thoroughbred man…pe… endowed with speed, beauty, and stature? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, by the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and enters and dwells in it. This, I say, is his speed. Moreover, when asked a question on the higher Dhamma and the higher discipline, he answers and does not falter. This, I say, is his beauty. He is a recipient of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites for the sick. This, I say, is his stature. Thus, bhikkhus, an excellent thoroughbred man is endowed with speed, beauty, and stature. These, bhikkhus, are the three excellent thoroughbred men.
