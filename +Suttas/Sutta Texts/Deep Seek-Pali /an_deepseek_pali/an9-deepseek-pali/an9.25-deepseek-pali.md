# AN 9.25 Paññāsuttaṃ

## AN 9.25 Wisdom

25. ‘‘Yato kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno paññāya cittaṃ suparicitaṃ hoti, tassetaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno kallaṃ vacanāya – ‘khīṇā jāti, vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ, kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ, nāparaṃ itthattāyāti pajānāmī’’’ti.

25.“Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu’s mind is well imbued with wisdom, it is fitting for that bhikkhu to declare: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno paññāya cittaṃ suparicitaṃ hoti? ‘Vītarāgaṃ me citta’nti paññāya cittaṃ suparicitaṃ hoti; ‘vītadosaṃ me citta’nti paññāya cittaṃ suparicitaṃ hoti; ‘vītamohaṃ me citta’nti paññāya cittaṃ suparicitaṃ hoti; ‘asarāgadhammaṃ me citta’nti paññāya cittaṃ suparicitaṃ hoti; ‘asadosadhammaṃ me citta’nti paññāya cittaṃ suparicitaṃ hoti; ‘asamohadhammaṃ me citta’nti paññāya cittaṃ suparicitaṃ hoti; ‘anāvattidhammaṃ me cittaṃ kāmabhavāyā’ti paññāya cittaṃ suparicitaṃ hoti; ‘anāvattidhammaṃ me cittaṃ rūpabhavāyā’ti paññāya cittaṃ suparicitaṃ hoti; ‘anāvattidhammaṃ me cittaṃ arūpabhavāyā’ti paññāya cittaṃ suparicitaṃ hoti. Yato kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno paññāya cittaṃ suparicitaṃ hoti, tassetaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno kallaṃ vacanāya – ‘khīṇā jāti, vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ, kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ, nāparaṃ itthattāyāti pajānāmī’’’ti. Pañcamaṃ.

“And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu’s mind well imbued with wisdom? His mind is well imbued with wisdom thus: ‘My mind is devoid of lust.’ His mind is well imbued with wisdom thus: ‘My mind is devoid of hatred.’ His mind is well imbued with wisdom thus: ‘My mind is devoid of delusion.’ His mind is well imbued with wisdom thus: ‘My mind is not of a nature to be lustful.’ His mind is well imbued with wisdom thus: ‘My mind is not of a nature to be hateful.’ His mind is well imbued with wisdom thus: ‘My mind is not of a nature to be deluded.’ His mind is well imbued with wisdom thus: ‘My mind is not of a nature to return to the sensual realm of existence.’ His mind is well imbued with wisdom thus: ‘My mind is not of a nature to return to the form realm of existence.’ His mind is well imbued with wisdom thus: ‘My mind is not of a nature to return to the formless realm of existence.’ When, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu’s mind is thus well imbued with wisdom, it is fitting for that bhikkhu to declare: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’”
