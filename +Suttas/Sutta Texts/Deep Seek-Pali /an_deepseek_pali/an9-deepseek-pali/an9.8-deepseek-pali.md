# AN 9.8 Sajjhasuttaṃ

## AN 9.8 The Sajjha Sutta

8. Ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā rājagahe viharati gijjhakūṭe pabbate. Atha kho sajjho paribbājako yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavatā saddhiṃ sammodi. Sammodanīyaṃ kathaṃ sāraṇīyaṃ vītisāretvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho sajjho paribbājako bhagavantaṃ etadavoca –

8.On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, on Vulture Peak Mountain. Then the wanderer Sajjha approached the Blessed One; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Blessed One. Having exchanged courteous and amiable talk, he sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the wanderer Sajjha said to the Blessed One:

‘‘Ekamidāhaṃ, bhante, samayaṃ bhagavā idheva rājagahe viharāmi giribbaje. Tatra me, bhante, bhagavato sammukhā sutaṃ sammukhā paṭiggahitaṃ – ‘yo so, sajjha, bhikkhu arahaṃ khīṇāsavo vusitavā katakaraṇīyo ohitabhāro anuppattasadattho parikkhīṇabhavasaṃyojano sammadaññāvimutto, abhabbo so pañca ṭhānāni ajjhācarituṃ – abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu sañcicca pāṇaṃ jīvitā voropetuṃ, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu adinnaṃ theyyasaṅkhātaṃ ādātuṃ, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu methunaṃ dhammaṃ paṭisevituṃ, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu sampajānamusā bhāsituṃ, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu sannidhikārakaṃ kāme paribhuñjituṃ seyyathāpi pubbe agāriyabhūto’ti. Kacci metaṃ, bhante, bhagavato sussutaṃ suggahitaṃ sumanasikataṃ sūpadhārita’’nti?

“Venerable sir, I recall one time when the Blessed One was dwelling right here in Rājagaha, at Giribbaja. There, venerable sir, I heard this in the Blessed One’s presence, received it in his presence: ‘Sajjha, a monk who is an arahant—with taints destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, attained his own true goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, and is completely liberated through right knowledge—is incapable of committing these five things: an arahant monk is incapable of deliberately depriving a living being of life; an arahant monk is incapable of taking what is not given, which is called stealing; an arahant monk is incapable of engaging in sexual intercourse; an arahant monk is incapable of knowingly speaking falsehood; an arahant monk is incapable of enjoying sensual pleasures by storing them up, as he did formerly when he was a householder.’ Venerable sir, did I hear this well from the Blessed One, grasp it well, attend to it well, and remember it well?”

‘‘Taggha te etaṃ, sajjha, sussutaṃ suggahitaṃ sumanasikataṃ sūpadhāritaṃ. Pubbe cāhaṃ, sajjha, etarahi ca evaṃ vadāmi – ‘yo so bhikkhu arahaṃ khīṇāsavo vusitavā katakaraṇīyo ohitabhāro anuppattasadattho parikkhīṇabhavasaṃyojano sammadaññāvimutto, abhabbo so nava ṭhānāni ajjhācarituṃ – abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu sañcicca pāṇaṃ jīvitā voropetuṃ…pe… abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu sannidhikārakaṃ kāme paribhuñjituṃ seyyathāpi pubbe agāriyabhūto, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu buddhaṃ paccakkhātuṃ, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu dhammaṃ paccakkhātuṃ, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu saṅghaṃ paccakkhātuṃ, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu sikkhaṃ paccakkhātuṃ’. Pubbe cāhaṃ, sajjha, etarahi ca evaṃ vadāmi – ‘yo so bhikkhu arahaṃ khīṇāsavo vusitavā katakaraṇīyo ohitabhāro anuppattasadattho parikkhīṇabhavasaṃyojano sammadaññāvimutto, abhabbo so imāni nava ṭhānāni ajjhācaritu’’’nti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

“Indeed, Sajjha, you have heard that well, grasped it well, attended to it well, and remembered it well. In the past, Sajjha, and now too, I say this: ‘A monk who is an arahant—with taints destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, attained his own true goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, and is completely liberated through right knowledge—is incapable of committing these nine things: an arahant monk is incapable of deliberately depriving a living being of life… an arahant monk is incapable of enjoying sensual pleasures by storing them up, as he did formerly when he was a householder; an arahant monk is incapable of rejecting the Buddha; an arahant monk is incapable of rejecting the Dhamma; an arahant monk is incapable of rejecting the Saṅgha; an arahant monk is incapable of rejecting the training.’ In the past, Sajjha, and now too, I say this: ‘A monk who is an arahant—with taints destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, attained his own true goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, and is completely liberated through right knowledge—is incapable of committing these nine things.’” The eighth.
