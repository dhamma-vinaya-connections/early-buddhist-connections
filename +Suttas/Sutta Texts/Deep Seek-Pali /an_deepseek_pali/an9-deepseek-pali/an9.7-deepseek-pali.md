## AN 9.7 The Sutavā Sutta

7. Ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā rājagahe viharati gijjhakūṭe pabbate. Atha kho sutavā paribbājako yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavatā saddhiṃ sammodi. Sammodanīyaṃ kathaṃ sāraṇīyaṃ vītisāretvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho sutavā paribbājako bhagavantaṃ etadavoca –

7. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, on Vulture Peak Mountain. Then the wanderer Sutavā approached the Blessed One; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Blessed One. Having exchanged courteous and amiable talk, he sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the wanderer Sutavā said to the Blessed One:

‘‘Ekamidāhaṃ, bhante, samayaṃ bhagavā idheva rājagahe viharāmi giribbaje. Tatra me, bhante, bhagavato sammukhā sutaṃ sammukhā paṭiggahitaṃ – ‘yo so, sutavā [sutava (syā.)], bhikkhu arahaṃ khīṇāsavo vusitavā katakaraṇīyo ohitabhāro anuppattasadattho parikkhīṇabhavasaṃyojano sammadaññāvimutto, abhabbo so pañca ṭhānāni ajjhācarituṃ – abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu sañcicca pāṇaṃ jīvitā voropetuṃ, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu adinnaṃ theyyasaṅkhātaṃ ādātuṃ, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu methunaṃ dhammaṃ paṭisevituṃ, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu sampajānamusā [sampajānaṃ musā (ka. sī.)] bhāsituṃ, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu sannidhikārakaṃ kāme paribhuñjituṃ seyyathāpi pubbe agāriyabhūto’ti. Kacci metaṃ, bhante, bhagavato sussutaṃ suggahitaṃ sumanasikataṃ sūpadhārita’’nti?

"Venerable sir, on one occasion I was dwelling right here in Rājagaha, at Giribbaja. There, venerable sir, I heard and received directly from the Blessed One: 'That monk, Sutavā, who is an arahant, whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, attained his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, and is completely liberated through final knowledge, is incapable of committing these five things: a monk whose taints are destroyed is incapable of deliberately depriving a living being of life; a monk whose taints are destroyed is incapable of taking what is not given, which is called stealing; a monk whose taints are destroyed is incapable of engaging in sexual intercourse; a monk whose taints are destroyed is incapable of knowingly speaking falsehood; a monk whose taints are destroyed is incapable of consuming stored-up sensual pleasures, as he did formerly when he was a householder.' Venerable sir, did I hear that correctly from the Blessed One, grasp it rightly, attend to it properly, and well retain it?"

‘‘Taggha te etaṃ, sutavā, sussutaṃ suggahitaṃ sumanasikataṃ sūpadhāritaṃ. Pubbe cāhaṃ, sutavā, etarahi ca evaṃ vadāmi – ‘yo so bhikkhu arahaṃ khīṇāsavo vusitavā katakaraṇīyo ohitabhāro anuppattasadattho parikkhīṇabhavasaṃyojano sammadaññāvimutto, abhabbo so nava ṭhānāni ajjhācarituṃ – abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu sañcicca pāṇaṃ jīvitā voropetuṃ, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu adinnaṃ theyyasaṅkhātaṃ ādātuṃ, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu methunaṃ dhammaṃ paṭisevituṃ, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu sampajānamusā bhāsituṃ, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu sannidhikārakaṃ kāme paribhuñjituṃ seyyathāpi pubbe agāriyabhūto, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu chandāgatiṃ gantuṃ, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu dosāgatiṃ gantuṃ, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu mohāgatiṃ gantuṃ, abhabbo khīṇāsavo bhikkhu bhayāgatiṃ gantuṃ’. Pubbe cāhaṃ, sutavā, etarahi ca evaṃ vadāmi – ‘yo so bhikkhu arahaṃ khīṇāsavo vusitavā katakaraṇīyo ohitabhāro anuppattasadattho parikkhīṇabhavasaṃyojano sammadaññāvimutto, abhabbo so imāni nava ṭhānāni ajjhācaritu’’’nti. Sattamaṃ.

“Indeed, Sutavā, you have heard that well, grasped it well, attended to it well, and remembered it well. In the past, Sutavā, and now too, I say this: ‘A monk who is an arahant—with taints destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, attained his own true goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, and is completely liberated through right knowledge—is incapable of committing nine things: an arahant monk is incapable of deliberately depriving a living being of life; an arahant monk is incapable of taking what is not given, which is called stealing; an arahant monk is incapable of engaging in sexual intercourse; an arahant monk is incapable of knowingly speaking falsehood; an arahant monk is incapable of enjoying sensual pleasures by storing them up, as he did formerly when he was a householder; an arahant monk is incapable of acting out of desire; an arahant monk is incapable of acting out of hatred; an arahant monk is incapable of acting out of delusion; an arahant monk is incapable of acting out of fear.’ In the past, Sutavā, and now too, I say this: ‘A monk who is an arahant—with taints destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, attained his own true goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, and is completely liberated through right knowledge—is incapable of committing these nine things.’” The seventh.
