## AN 9.6 The Association Discourse

6. Tatra kho āyasmā sāriputto bhikkhū āmantesi…pe… āyasmā sāriputto etadavoca –

6. Thereupon, the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks… The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

‘‘Puggalopi, āvuso, duvidhena veditabbo – sevitabbopi asevitabbopi. Cīvarampi, āvuso, duvidhena veditabbaṃ – sevitabbampi asevitabbampi. Piṇḍapātopi, āvuso, duvidhena veditabbo – sevitabbopi asevitabbopi. Senāsanampi, āvuso, duvidhena veditabbaṃ – sevitabbampi asevitabbampi. Gāmanigamopi, āvuso, duvidhena veditabbo – sevitabbopi asevitabbopi. Janapadapadesopi āvuso, duvidhena veditabbo – sevitabbopi asevitabbopi.

Friend, a person should be understood in two ways—as one to be associated with and as one not to be associated with. Friend, robes should be understood in two ways—as something to be used and as something not to be used. Friend, alms-food should be understood in two ways—as something to be used and as something not to be used. Friend, a lodging should be understood in two ways—as something to be used and as something not to be used. Friend, a village or town should be understood in two ways—as a place to be frequented and as a place not to be frequented. Friend, a region or district should be understood in two ways—as a place to be frequented and as a place not to be frequented.

‘‘‘Puggalopi, āvuso, duvidhena veditabbo – sevitabbopi asevitabbopī’ti, iti kho panetaṃ vuttaṃ. Kiñcetaṃ paṭicca vuttaṃ? Tattha yaṃ jaññā puggalaṃ – ‘imaṃ kho me puggalaṃ sevato akusalā dhammā abhivaḍḍhanti, kusalā dhammā parihāyanti; ye ca kho me pabbajitena jīvitaparikkhārā samudānetabbā cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhārā te ca kasirena samudāgacchanti; yassa camhi atthāya agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajito so ca me sāmaññattho na bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gacchatī’ti, tenāvuso, puggalena so puggalo rattibhāgaṃ vā divasabhāgaṃ vā saṅkhāpi anāpucchā pakkamitabbaṃ nānubandhitabbo.

"'Friend, a person should be understood in two ways—as one to be associated with and as one not to be associated with.' So it was said. With reference to what was this said? Here, one should recognize a person thus: 'If I associate with this person, unwholesome qualities increase in me, and wholesome qualities decline; and the requisites of life—robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicinal requisites for the sick—that a renunciate must gather are obtained with difficulty; and the ascetic goal for which I went forth from the household life into homelessness does not reach fulfillment through development.' Therefore, friend, one should depart from that person, whether by night or by day, even without bidding farewell or informing them, and one should not follow them."
