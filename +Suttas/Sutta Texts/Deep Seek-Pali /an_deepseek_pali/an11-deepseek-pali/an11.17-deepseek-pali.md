Idha, bhikkhave, gopālako na rūpaññū hoti, na lakkhaṇakusalo hoti, na āsāṭikaṃ hāretā [sāṭetā (sī. syā. pī.)] hoti, na vaṇaṃ paṭicchādetā hoti, na dhūmaṃ kattā hoti, na titthaṃ jānāti, na pītaṃ jānāti, na vīthiṃ jānāti, na gocarakusalo hoti, anavasesadohī ca hoti, ye te usabhā gopitaro gopariṇāyakā te na atirekapūjāya pūjetā hoti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, ekādasahi aṅgehi samannāgato gopālako abhabbo gogaṇaṃ pariharituṃ phātiṃ kātuṃ.

17.“Bhikkhus, a cowherd endowed with eleven factors is incapable of managing a herd of cattle and making it prosper. What eleven? Here, bhikkhus, a cowherd does not know forms, is not skilled in marks, does not remove flies’ eggs, does not dress wounds, does not make a smudge, does not know the ford, does not know when the cattle have drunk, does not know the road, is not skilled in pastures, milks the cows dry, and does not show special veneration for the bulls that are the fathers and leaders of the herd. Bhikkhus, a cowherd endowed with these eleven factors is incapable of managing a herd of cattle and making it prosper.”

‘‘Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, ekādasahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu abhabbo imasmiṃ dhammavinaye vuddhiṃ virūḷhiṃ vepullaṃ āpajjituṃ. Katamehi ekādasahi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na rūpaññū hoti, na lakkhaṇakusalo hoti, na āsāṭikaṃ hāretā hoti, na vaṇaṃ paṭicchādetā hoti, na dhūmaṃ kattā hoti, na titthaṃ jānāti, na pītaṃ jānāti, na vīthiṃ jānāti, na gocarakusalo hoti, anavasesadohī ca hoti, ye te bhikkhū therā rattaññū cirapabbajitā saṅghapitaro saṅghapariṇāyakā te na atirekapūjāya pūjetā hoti.

“So too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu endowed with eleven qualities is incapable of achieving growth, progress, and expansion in this Dhamma and Discipline. What eleven? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not know forms, is not skilled in marks, does not remove flies’ eggs, does not dress wounds, does not make a smudge, does not know the ford, does not know what has been drunk, does not know the road, is not skilled in the pastures, milks dry, and does not show special veneration for those bhikkhus who are elders, of long standing, long gone forth, fathers of the Saṅgha, leaders of the Saṅgha.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na rūpaññū hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu yaṃ kiñci rūpaṃ ( ) [(sabbaṃ rūpaṃ) ma. ni. 1.347 ( ) katthaci dissati] ‘cattāri mahābhūtāni, catunnañca mahābhūtānaṃ upādāyarūpa’nti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na rūpaññū hoti.

“And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu not a knower of form? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not understand as it really is any kind of form as: ‘The four great elements and the form derived from the four great elements.’ In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is not a knower of form.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na lakkhaṇakusalo hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ‘kammalakkhaṇo bālo, kammalakkhaṇo paṇḍito’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na lakkhaṇakusalo hoti.

“And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu not skilled in marks? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not understand as it really is: ‘A fool is characterized by his action, a wise person is characterized by his action.’ In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is not skilled in marks.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na āsāṭikaṃ hāretā hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu uppannaṃ kāmavitakkaṃ adhivāseti nappajahati na vinodeti na byantīkaroti na anabhāvaṃ gameti, uppannaṃ byāpādavitakkaṃ… uppannaṃ vihiṃsāvitakkaṃ… uppannuppanne pāpake akusale dhamme adhivāseti nappajahati na vinodeti na byantīkaroti na anabhāvaṃ gameti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na āsāṭikaṃ hāretā hoti.

“And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu not one who removes flies’ eggs? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu tolerates an arisen thought of sensual desire and does not abandon it, dispel it, eliminate it, or bring it to an end. He tolerates an arisen thought of ill will… an arisen thought of cruelty… He tolerates arisen evil unwholesome states and does not abandon them, dispel them, eliminate them, or bring them to an end.

Sotena saddaṃ sutvā… ghānena gandhaṃ ghāyitvā… jivhāya rasaṃ sāyitvā… kāyena phoṭṭhabbaṃ phusitvā… manasā dhammaṃ viññāya nimittaggāhī hoti anubyañjanaggāhī; yatvādhikaraṇamenaṃ manindriyaṃ asaṃvutaṃ viharantaṃ abhijjhādomanassā pāpakā akusalā dhammā anvāssaveyyuṃ, tassa saṃvarāya na paṭipajjati; na rakkhati manindriyaṃ, manindriye saṃvaraṃ nāpajjati. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na vaṇaṃ paṭicchādetā hoti.

“And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu not one who dresses a wound? Here, bhikkhus, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu grasps its signs and features. Since, if he were to leave the eye faculty unrestrained, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and displeasure might assail him, he does not practice restraint over it, he does not guard the eye faculty, he does not undertake restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard a sound with the ear… Having smelt an odor with the nose… Having tasted a flavor with the tongue… Having felt a tangible with the body… Having cognized a mental object with the mind, he grasps its signs and features. Since, if he were to leave the mind faculty unrestrained, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and displeasure might assail him, he does not practice restraint over it, he does not guard the mind faculty, he does not undertake restraint of the mind faculty.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na titthaṃ jānāti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ye te bhikkhū bahussutā āgatāgamā dhammadharā vinayadharā mātikādharā, te kālena kālaṃ upasaṅkamitvā na paripucchati na paripañhati – ‘idaṃ, bhante, kathaṃ, imassa ko attho’ti? Tassa te āyasmanto avivaṭañceva na vivaranti, anuttānīkatañca na uttānīkaronti, anekavihitesu ca kaṅkhāṭhāniyesu dhammesu kaṅkhaṃ na paṭivinodenti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na titthaṃ jānāti.

“And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu not know the ford? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not from time to time approach those bhikkhus who are very learned, who have memorized the teachings, bearers of the Dhamma, bearers of the Vinaya, and bearers of the mātikās, to question and query them: ‘Venerable sirs, how is this? What is its meaning?’ Those venerable ones do not reveal to him what has not been revealed, do not make plain what has not been made plain, and do not dispel his perplexity about many perplexing points in the Dhamma. In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not know the ford.”

Here, bhikkhus, when the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata is being taught, a bhikkhu does not gain inspiration in the meaning, does not gain inspiration in the Dhamma, and does not gain gladness connected with the Dhamma. In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not know what has been drunk.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na vīthiṃ jānāti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ariyaṃ aṭṭhaṅgikaṃ maggaṃ yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na vīthiṃ jānāti.

“And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu one who milks dry? Here, bhikkhus, faithful householders invite a bhikkhu with offerings of robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicinal requisites for the sick. There the bhikkhu does not know the proper measure for acceptance. In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is one who milks dry.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ye te bhikkhū therā rattaññū cirapabbajitā saṅghapitaro saṅghapariṇāyakā, te na atirekapūjāya pūjetā hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ye te bhikkhū therā rattaññū cirapabbajitā saṅghapitaro saṅghapariṇāyakā, tesu na mettaṃ kāyakammaṃ paccupaṭṭhāpeti āvi ceva raho ca, na mettaṃ vacīkammaṃ… na mettaṃ manokammaṃ paccupaṭṭhāpeti āvi ceva raho ca.

Idha, bhikkhave, gopālako rūpaññū hoti, lakkhaṇakusalo hoti, āsāṭikaṃ hāretā hoti, vaṇaṃ paṭicchādetā hoti, dhūmaṃ kattā hoti, titthaṃ jānāti, pītaṃ jānāti, vīthiṃ jānāti, gocarakusalo hoti, sāvasesadohī ca hoti, ye te usabhā gopitaro gopariṇāyakā te atirekapūjāya pūjetā hoti – imehi kho, bhikkhave, ekādasahi aṅgehi samannāgato gopālako bhabbo gogaṇaṃ pariharituṃ phātiṃ kātuṃ.
