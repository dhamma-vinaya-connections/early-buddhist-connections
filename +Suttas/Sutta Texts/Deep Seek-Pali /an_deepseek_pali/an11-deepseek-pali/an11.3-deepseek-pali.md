## AN 11.3 The First Discourse on the Supporting Conditions

3. [a. ni. 5.24; 10.3] ‘‘Dussīlassa, bhikkhave, sīlavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti avippaṭisāro. Avippaṭisāre asati avippaṭisāravipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti pāmojjaṃ. Pāmojje asati pāmojjavipannassa hatūpanisā hoti pīti. Pītiyā asati pītivipannassa hatūpanisā hoti passaddhi. Passaddhiyā asati passaddhivipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti sukhaṃ. Sukhe asati sukhavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti sammāsamādhi. Sammāsamādhimhi asati sammāsamādhivipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ. Yathābhūtañāṇadassane asati yathābhūtañāṇadassanavipannassa hatūpanisā hoti nibbidā. Nibbidāya asati nibbidāvipannassa hatūpaniso hoti virāgo. Virāge asati virāgavipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ.

3. "For an unvirtuous person, monks, one whose virtue is corrupted, remorse is undermined. When there is no remorse, for one whose remorse is corrupted, joy is undermined. When there is no joy, for one whose joy is corrupted, rapture is undermined. When there is no rapture, for one whose rapture is corrupted, tranquility is undermined. When there is no tranquility, for one whose tranquility is corrupted, happiness is undermined. When there is no happiness, for one whose happiness is corrupted, right concentration is undermined. When there is no right concentration, for one whose right concentration is corrupted, the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is undermined. When there is no knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one whose knowledge and vision of things as they really are is corrupted, disillusionment is undermined. When there is no disillusionment, for one whose disillusionment is corrupted, dispassion is undermined. When there is no dispassion, for one whose dispassion is corrupted, the knowledge and vision of liberation are undermined."

‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, rukkho sākhāpalāsavipanno. Tassa papaṭikāpi na pāripūriṃ gacchati, tacopi… pheggupi… sāropi na pāripūriṃ gacchati. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, dussīlassa sīlavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti avippaṭisāro, avippaṭisāre asati avippaṭisāravipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti pāmojjaṃ…pe… vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ.

"Just as, monks, a tree deprived of branches and leaves does not come to full development in its outer bark, nor in its inner bark, nor in its sapwood, nor in its heartwood. In the same way, monks, for an unvirtuous person, one whose virtue is corrupted, remorse is undermined. When there is no remorse, for one whose remorse is corrupted, joy is undermined... up to the knowledge and vision of liberation."

‘‘Sīlavato, bhikkhave, sīlasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti avippaṭisāro, avippaṭisāre sati avippaṭisārasampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti pāmojjaṃ, pāmojje sati pāmojjasampannassa upanisasampannā hoti pīti, pītiyā sati pītisampannassa upanisasampannā hoti passaddhi, passaddhiyā sati passaddhisampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti sukhaṃ, sukhe sati sukhasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti sammāsamādhi, sammāsamādhimhi sati sammāsamādhisampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ, yathābhūtañāṇadassane sati yathābhūtañāṇadassanasampannassa upanisasampannā hoti nibbidā, nibbidāya sati nibbidāsampannassa upanisasampanno hoti virāgo, virāge sati virāgasampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ.

"For a virtuous person, monks, one accomplished in virtue, non-remorse is well-founded. When non-remorse is present, for one accomplished in non-remorse, joy is well-founded. When joy is present, for one accomplished in joy, rapture is well-founded. When rapture is present, for one accomplished in rapture, tranquility is well-founded. When tranquility is present, for one accomplished in tranquility, happiness is well-founded. When happiness is present, for one accomplished in happiness, right concentration is well-founded. When right concentration is present, for one accomplished in right concentration, the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is well-founded. When the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is present, for one accomplished in the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, disenchantment is well-founded. When disenchantment is present, for one accomplished in disenchantment, dispassion is well-founded. When dispassion is present, for one accomplished in dispassion, the knowledge and vision of liberation is well-founded."

‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, rukkho sākhāpalāsasampanno. Tassa papaṭikāpi pāripūriṃ gacchati, tacopi… pheggupi… sāropi pāripūriṃ gacchati. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, sīlavato sīlasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti avippaṭisāro, avippaṭisāre sati avippaṭisārasampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti…pe… vimuttiñāṇadassana’’nti. Tatiyaṃ.

"Just as, monks, a tree endowed with branches and foliage reaches fullness in its outer bark, its inner bark, its sapwood, and its heartwood. In the same way, monks, for a virtuous person, one accomplished in virtue, non-remorse is well-founded. When non-remorse is present, for one accomplished in non-remorse, joy is well-founded… up to… the knowledge and vision of liberation."
