# AN 11.1 Kimatthiyasuttaṃ

## AN 11.1 What Is the Purpose?

1. [a. ni. 10.1] Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Atha kho āyasmā ānando yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā ānando bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kimatthiyāni, bhante, kusalāni sīlāni kimānisaṃsānī’’ti? ‘‘Avippaṭisāratthāni kho, ānanda, kusalāni sīlāni avippaṭisārānisaṃsānī’’ti.

1. Thus have I heard: At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. Then the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: "What is the purpose, venerable sir, what is the benefit, of wholesome virtues?" "Wholesome virtues, Ananda, have non-remorse as their purpose and non-remorse as their benefit."

‘‘Avippaṭisāro pana, bhante, kimatthiyo kimānisaṃso’’? ‘‘Avippaṭisāro kho, ānanda, pāmojjattho pāmojjānisaṃso’’.

"But what, venerable sir, is the purpose of non-remorse, what is its benefit?" "Non-remorse, Ananda, has gladness as its purpose and gladness as its benefit."

‘‘Pāmojjaṃ pana, bhante, kimatthiyaṃ kimānisaṃsaṃ’’? ‘‘Pāmojjaṃ kho, ānanda, pītatthaṃ pītānisaṃsaṃ’’.

"And what, venerable sir, is the purpose of gladness, what is its benefit?" "Gladness, Ānanda, has rapture as its purpose and rapture as its benefit."

‘‘Pīti pana, bhante, kimatthiyā kimānisaṃsā’’? ‘‘Pīti kho, ānanda, passaddhatthā passaddhānisaṃsā’’.

"And what, venerable sir, is the purpose of rapture, what is its benefit?" "Rapture, Ananda, has tranquillity as its purpose and tranquillity as its benefit."

‘‘Passaddhi pana, bhante, kimatthiyā kimānisaṃsā’’? ‘‘Passaddhi kho, ānanda, sukhatthā sukhānisaṃsā’’.

"And what, venerable sir, is the purpose of tranquillity, what is its benefit?" "Tranquillity, Ananda, has happiness as its purpose and happiness as its benefit."

‘‘Sukhaṃ pana, bhante, kimatthiyaṃ kimānisaṃsaṃ’’? ‘‘Sukhaṃ kho, ānanda, samādhatthaṃ samādhānisaṃsaṃ’’.

"And what, venerable sir, is the purpose of happiness, what is its benefit?" "Happiness, Ananda, has concentration as its purpose and concentration as its benefit."

‘‘Samādhi pana, bhante, kimatthiyo kimānisaṃso’’? ‘‘Samādhi kho, ānanda, yathābhūtañāṇadassanattho yathābhūtañāṇadassanānisaṃso’’.

"And what, venerable sir, is the purpose of concentration, what is its benefit?" "Concentration, Ānanda, has true knowledge and vision as its purpose and true knowledge and vision as its benefit."

‘‘Yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ pana, bhante, kimatthiyaṃ kimānisaṃsaṃ’’? ‘‘Yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ kho, ānanda, nibbidatthaṃ nibbidānisaṃsaṃ’’.

"And what, venerable sir, is the purpose of true knowledge and vision, what is its benefit?" "True knowledge and vision, Ānanda, has disenchantment as its purpose and disenchantment as its benefit."

‘‘Nibbidā, pana, bhante, kimatthiyā kimānisaṃsā’’? ‘‘Nibbidā kho, ānanda, virāgatthā virāgānisaṃsā ’’.

"And what, venerable sir, is the purpose of disenchantment, what is its benefit?" "Disenchantment, Ananda, has dispassion as its purpose and dispassion as its benefit."

‘‘Virāgo pana, bhante, kimatthiyo kimānisaṃso’’? ‘‘Virāgo kho, ānanda, vimuttiñāṇadassanattho vimuttiñāṇadassanānisaṃso.

"And what, venerable sir, is the purpose of dispassion, what is its benefit?" "Dispassion, Ānanda, has knowledge and vision of freedom as its purpose and knowledge and vision of freedom as its benefit."

‘‘Iti kho, ānanda, kusalāni sīlāni avippaṭisāratthāni avippaṭisārānisaṃsāni, avippaṭisāro pāmojjattho pāmojjānisaṃso, pāmojjaṃ pītatthaṃ pītānisaṃsaṃ, pīti passaddhatthā passaddhānisaṃsā, passaddhi sukhatthā sukhānisaṃsā, sukhaṃ samādhatthaṃ samādhānisaṃsaṃ, samādhi yathābhūtañāṇadassanattho yathābhūtañāṇadassanānisaṃso, yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ nibbidatthaṃ nibbidānisaṃsaṃ, nibbidā virāgatthā virāgānisaṃsā, virāgo vimuttiñāṇadassanattho vimuttiñāṇadassanānisaṃso. Iti kho, ānanda, kusalāni sīlāni anupubbena aggāya parentī’’ti. Paṭhamaṃ.

"Thus, Ānanda, skillful virtues have non-regret as their purpose, non-regret as their benefit. Non-regret has joy as its purpose, joy as its benefit. Joy has rapture as its purpose, rapture as its benefit. Rapture has tranquility as its purpose, tranquility as its benefit. Tranquility has happiness as its purpose, happiness as its benefit. Happiness has concentration as its purpose, concentration as its benefit. Concentration has true knowledge and vision as its purpose, true knowledge and vision as its benefit. True knowledge and vision has disenchantment as its purpose, disenchantment as its benefit. Disenchantment has dispassion as its purpose, dispassion as its benefit. Dispassion has knowledge and vision of freedom as its purpose, knowledge and vision of freedom as its benefit. Thus, Ānanda, skillful virtues lead step by step to the highest." The First.
