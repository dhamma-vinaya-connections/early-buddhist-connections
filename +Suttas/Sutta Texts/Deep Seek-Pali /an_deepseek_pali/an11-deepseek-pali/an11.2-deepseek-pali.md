# AN 11.2 Cetanākaraṇīyasuttaṃ

## AN 11.2 The Discourse on Things to Be Done by Volition

2. [a. ni. 10.2] ‘‘Sīlavato, bhikkhave, sīlasampannassa na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘avippaṭisāro me uppajjatū’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ sīlavato sīlasampannassa avippaṭisāro uppajjati.

2. For one of virtuous conduct, bhikkhus, one accomplished in virtue, there is no need to make a volitional effort: ‘May freedom from remorse arise in me.’ It is natural, bhikkhus, that freedom from remorse arises in one of virtuous conduct, one accomplished in virtue.

‘‘Avippaṭisārissa, bhikkhave, na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘pāmojjaṃ me uppajjatū’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ avippaṭisārissa pāmojjaṃ uppajjati.

Bhikkhus, for one free from remorse, there is no need to make a volitional effort: ‘May joy arise in me.’ It is natural, bhikkhus, that joy arises in one free from remorse.

‘‘Pamuditassa, bhikkhave, na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘pīti me uppajjatū’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ pamuditassa pīti uppajjati.

‘‘Bhikkhus, for one who is gladdened, there is no need to make a volitional effort: ‘May joy arise in me.’ It is natural, bhikkhus, that joy arises in one who is gladdened.

‘‘Pītimanassa, bhikkhave, na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘kāyo me passambhatū’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ pītimanassa kāyo passambhati.

For one filled with joy, bhikkhus, there is no need to make a volitional effort: ‘May my body become tranquil.’ It is natural, bhikkhus, that the body becomes tranquil for one filled with joy.

‘‘Passaddhakāyassa, bhikkhave, na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘sukhaṃ vediyāmī’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ passaddhakāyo sukhaṃ vediyati.

For one with a tranquil body, bhikkhus, there is no need to make a volitional effort: ‘May I experience happiness.’ It is natural, bhikkhus, that one with a tranquil body experiences happiness.

‘‘Sukhino, bhikkhave, na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘cittaṃ me samādhiyatū’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ sukhino cittaṃ samādhiyati.

For one who is happy, bhikkhus, there is no need to make a volitional effort: ‘May my mind become concentrated.’ It is natural, bhikkhus, that the mind of one who is happy becomes concentrated.

‘‘Samāhitassa, bhikkhave, na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘yathābhūtaṃ jānāmi passāmī’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ samāhito yathābhūtaṃ jānāti passati.

For one who is concentrated, bhikkhus, there is no need to make a volitional effort: ‘May I know and see things as they really are.’ It is natural, bhikkhus, that one who is concentrated knows and sees things as they really are.

‘‘Yathābhūtaṃ, bhikkhave, jānato passato na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘nibbindāmī’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ yathābhūtaṃ jānaṃ passaṃ nibbindati.

For one who knows and sees things as they really are, bhikkhus, there is no need to make a volitional effort: ‘May I become disenchanted.’ It is natural, bhikkhus, that one who knows and sees things as they really are becomes disenchanted.

‘‘Nibbinnassa, bhikkhave, na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘virajjāmī’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ nibbinno virajjati.

For one who is disenchanted, bhikkhus, there is no need to make a volitional effort: ‘May I become dispassionate.’ It is natural, bhikkhus, that one who is disenchanted becomes dispassionate.

‘‘Virattassa, bhikkhave, na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ sacchikaromī’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ viratto vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ sacchikaroti.

For one who is dispassionate, bhikkhus, there is no need to make a volitional effort: ‘May I realize the knowledge and vision of liberation.’ It is natural, bhikkhus, that one who is dispassionate realizes the knowledge and vision of liberation.

‘‘Iti kho, bhikkhave, virāgo vimuttiñāṇadassanattho vimuttiñāṇadassanānisaṃso, nibbidā virāgatthā virāgānisaṃsā, yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ nibbidatthaṃ nibbidānisaṃsaṃ, samādhi yathābhūtañāṇadassanattho yathābhūtañāṇadassanānisaṃso, sukhaṃ samādhatthaṃ samādhānisaṃsaṃ, passaddhi sukhatthā sukhānisaṃsā, pīti passaddhatthā passaddhānisaṃsā, pāmojjaṃ pītatthaṃ pītānisaṃsaṃ, avippaṭisāro pāmojjattho pāmojjānisaṃso, kusalāni sīlāni avippaṭisāratthāni avippaṭisārānisaṃsāni. Iti kho, bhikkhave, dhammā dhamme abhisandenti, dhammā dhamme paripūrenti apārā pāraṃ gamanāyā’’ti. Dutiyaṃ.

Thus, bhikkhus, dispassion has the knowledge and vision of liberation as its purpose and benefit. Disenchantment has dispassion as its purpose and benefit. The knowledge and vision of things as they really are has disenchantment as its purpose and benefit. Concentration has the knowledge and vision of things as they really are as its purpose and benefit. Happiness has concentration as its purpose and benefit. Tranquillity has happiness as its purpose and benefit. Rapture has tranquillity as its purpose and benefit. Joy has rapture as its purpose and benefit. Non-remorse has joy as its purpose and benefit. Wholesome virtues have non-remorse as their purpose and benefit. Thus, bhikkhus, qualities flow into qualities, qualities fulfill qualities, for going from this shore to the far shore.
