# AN 8.81 Satisampajaññasuttaṃ

## AN 8.81 The Discourse on Mindfulness and Clear Comprehension

81. ‘‘Satisampajaññe, bhikkhave, asati satisampajaññavipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti hirottappaṃ. Hirottappe asati hirottappavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti indriyasaṃvaro. Indriyasaṃvare asati indriyasaṃvaravipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti sīlaṃ. Sīle asati sīlavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti sammāsamādhi. Sammāsamādhimhi asati sammāsamādhivipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ. Yathābhūtañāṇadassane asati yathābhūtañāṇadassanavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti nibbidāvirāgo. Nibbidāvirāge asati nibbidāvirāgavipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, rukkho sākhāpalāsavipanno. Tassa papaṭikāpi na pāripūriṃ gacchati, tacopi… pheggupi… sāropi na pāripūriṃ gacchati. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, satisampajaññe asati satisampajaññavipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti hirottappaṃ; hirottappe asati hirottappavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti…pe… vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ.

81."Bhikkhus, when mindfulness and clear comprehension are absent, for one deficient in mindfulness and clear comprehension, moral shame and moral dread are lost. When moral shame and moral dread are absent, for one deficient in moral shame and moral dread, sense restraint is lost. When sense restraint is absent, for one deficient in sense restraint, virtue is lost. When virtue is absent, for one deficient in virtue, right concentration is lost. When right concentration is absent, for one deficient in right concentration, knowledge and vision of things as they really are are lost. When knowledge and vision of things as they really are are absent, for one deficient in knowledge and vision of things as they really are, disenchantment and dispassion are lost. When disenchantment and dispassion are absent, for one deficient in disenchantment and dispassion, the knowledge and vision of liberation are lost. Just as, bhikkhus, a tree deficient in branches and foliage, its outer bark does not reach fullness, nor its inner bark, nor its sapwood, nor its heartwood. In the same way, bhikkhus, when mindfulness and clear comprehension are absent, for one deficient in mindfulness and clear comprehension, moral shame and moral dread are lost... the knowledge and vision of liberation are lost."

‘‘Satisampajaññe, bhikkhave, sati satisampajaññasampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti hirottappaṃ. Hirottappe sati hirottappasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti indriyasaṃvaro. Indriyasaṃvare sati indriyasaṃvarasampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti sīlaṃ. Sīle sati sīlasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti sammāsamādhi. Sammāsamādhimhi sati sammāsamādhisampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ. Yathābhūtañāṇadassane sati yathābhūtañāṇadassanasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti nibbidāvirāgo. Nibbidāvirāge sati nibbidāvirāgasampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, rukkho sākhāpalāsasampanno. Tassa papaṭikāpi pāripūriṃ gacchati, tacopi… pheggupi… sāropi pāripūriṃ gacchati. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, satisampajaññe sati satisampajaññasampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti hirottappaṃ; hirottappe sati hirottappasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti…pe… vimuttiñāṇadassana’’nti. Paṭhamaṃ.

"Mindfulness and clear comprehension, bhikkhus, for one accomplished in mindfulness and clear comprehension, the supporting condition is fulfilled for moral shame and moral dread. When moral shame and moral dread are fulfilled, for one accomplished in moral shame and moral dread, the supporting condition is fulfilled for sense restraint. When sense restraint is fulfilled, for one accomplished in sense restraint, the supporting condition is fulfilled for virtue. When virtue is fulfilled, for one accomplished in virtue, the supporting condition is fulfilled for right concentration. When right concentration is fulfilled, for one accomplished in right concentration, the supporting condition is fulfilled for knowledge and vision of things as they really are. When knowledge and vision of things as they really are are fulfilled, for one accomplished in knowledge and vision of things as they really are, the supporting condition is fulfilled for disenchantment and dispassion. When disenchantment and dispassion are fulfilled, for one accomplished in disenchantment and dispassion, the supporting condition is fulfilled for knowledge and vision of liberation. Just as, bhikkhus, with a tree possessed of branches and foliage, its outer bark also reaches fullness, and its inner bark... its sapwood... its heartwood also reaches fullness. Just so, bhikkhus, when mindfulness and clear comprehension are present, for one accomplished in mindfulness and clear comprehension, the supporting condition is fulfilled for moral shame and moral dread... up to knowledge and vision of liberation." The First.
