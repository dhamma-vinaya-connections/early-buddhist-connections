## AN 8.67 The Discourse on Ignoble Speech

67. ‘‘Aṭṭhime, bhikkhave, anariyavohārā. Katame aṭṭha? Adiṭṭhe diṭṭhavāditā, asute sutavāditā, amute mutavāditā, aviññāte viññātavāditā, diṭṭhe adiṭṭhavāditā, sute asutavāditā, mute amutavāditā, viññāte aviññātavāditā. Ime kho, bhikkhave, aṭṭha anariyavohārā’’ti. Sattamaṃ.

67."Monks, there are these eight ignoble ways of speaking. What eight? Declaring as seen what was not seen; declaring as heard what was not heard; declaring as sensed what was not sensed; declaring as known what was not known; declaring as unseen what was seen; declaring as unheard what was heard; declaring as unsensed what was sensed; declaring as unknown what was known. These, monks, are the eight ignoble ways of speaking." The seventh.
