## AN 8.22 The Second Ugga Discourse

22. Ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā vajjīsu viharati hatthigāme. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘aṭṭhahi, bhikkhave, acchariyehi abbhutehi dhammehi samannāgataṃ uggaṃ gahapatiṃ hatthigāmakaṃ dhārethā’’ti. Idamavoca bhagavā. Idaṃ vatvāna sugato uṭṭhāyāsanā vihāraṃ pāvisi.

22.On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Vajjis at Hatthigāma. There the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks, remember Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma as possessing eight wonderful and amazing qualities.” This the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Atha kho aññataro bhikkhu pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena uggassa gahapatino hatthigāmakassa nivesanaṃ tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi. Atha kho uggo gahapati hatthigāmako yena so bhikkhu tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā taṃ bhikkhuṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho uggaṃ gahapatiṃ hatthigāmakaṃ so bhikkhu etadavoca – ‘‘aṭṭhahi kho tvaṃ, gahapati, acchariyehi abbhutehi dhammehi samannāgato bhagavatā byākato. Katame te, gahapati, aṭṭha acchariyā abbhutā dhammā, yehi tvaṃ samannāgato bhagavatā byākato’’ti?

Then a certain bhikkhu, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, went to the residence of Ugga, the householder of Hatthigāma. Having approached, he sat down on the prepared seat. Then Ugga, the householder of Hatthigāma, approached that bhikkhu, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, that bhikkhu said to Ugga: “You, householder, have been declared by the Blessed One as possessing eight wonderful and amazing qualities. What are those eight wonderful and amazing qualities, householder, with which you are endowed and by which the Blessed One has declared you?”

‘‘Na kho ahaṃ, bhante, jānāmi – katamehi aṭṭhahi acchariyehi abbhutehi dhammehi samannāgato bhagavatā byākatoti. Api ca, bhante, ye me aṭṭha acchariyā abbhutā dhammā saṃvijjanti, taṃ suṇāhi, sādhukaṃ manasi karohi; bhāsissāmī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, gahapatī’’ti kho so bhikkhu uggassa gahapatino hatthigāmakassa paccassosi. Uggo gahapati hatthigāmako etadavoca – ‘‘yadāhaṃ, bhante, nāgavane paricaranto bhagavantaṃ paṭhamaṃ dūratova addasaṃ; saha dassaneneva me, bhante, bhagavato cittaṃ pasīdi, surāmado ca pahīyi. Ayaṃ kho me, bhante, paṭhamo acchariyo abbhuto dhammo saṃvijjati.

“Venerable sir, I do not know which eight wonderful and amazing qualities the Blessed One has declared (he possesses). However, venerable sir, listen to the eight wonderful and amazing qualities which exist in me; pay close attention; I will speak.” “Very well, householder,” the monk replied to Ugga, the householder of Hatthigāma. Ugga, the householder of Hatthigāma, said this: “When I, venerable sir, while walking in Nāgavana, first saw the Blessed One from afar, as soon as I saw him, venerable sir, my mind became serene, and my intoxication with liquor disappeared. This, venerable sir, is the first wonderful and amazing quality that exists in me.

‘‘So kho ahaṃ, bhante, pasannacitto bhagavantaṃ payirupāsiṃ. Tassa me bhagavā anupubbiṃ kathaṃ kathesi, seyyathidaṃ – dānakathaṃ sīlakathaṃ saggakathaṃ; kāmānaṃ ādīnavaṃ okāraṃ saṃkilesaṃ, nekkhamme ānisaṃsaṃ pakāsesi. Yadā maṃ bhagavā aññāsi kallacittaṃ muducittaṃ vinīvaraṇacittaṃ udaggacittaṃ pasannacittaṃ, atha yā buddhānaṃ sāmukkaṃsikā dhammadesanā taṃ pakāsesi – dukkhaṃ, samudayaṃ, nirodhaṃ, maggaṃ. Seyyathāpi nāma suddhaṃ vatthaṃ apagatakāḷakaṃ sammadeva rajanaṃ paṭiggaṇheyya; evamevaṃ kho me tasmiṃyeva āsane virajaṃ vītamalaṃ dhammacakkhuṃ udapādi – ‘yaṃ kiñci samudayadhammaṃ, sabbaṃ taṃ nirodhadhamma’nti. So kho ahaṃ, bhante, diṭṭhadhammo pattadhammo viditadhammo pariyogāḷhadhammo tiṇṇavicikiccho vigatakathaṃkatho vesārajjappatto aparappaccayo satthusāsane tattheva buddhañca dhammañca saṅghañca saraṇaṃ agamāsiṃ, brahmacariyapañcamāni ca sikkhāpadāni samādiyiṃ. Ayaṃ kho me, bhante, dutiyo acchariyo abbhuto dhammo saṃvijjati.

“Then, venerable sir, with a serene mind, I attended upon the Blessed One. The Blessed One gave me a graduated discourse, namely: a talk on generosity, on virtue, on the heavens; he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in sensual pleasures and the benefit of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that my mind was amenable, pliable, free from hindrances, uplifted, and serene, then he revealed to me the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth, free from stains, would perfectly take dye, so too in that very seat there arose in me the dust-free, stainless vision of the Dhamma: ‘Whatever is subject to arising is all subject to cessation.’ Then, venerable sir, I became one who has seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, known the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma, crossed over doubt, free from perplexity, attained to assurance, and independent of others in the Teacher’s dispensation. Right there I went for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and undertook the five precepts, with celibacy as the fifth. This, venerable sir, is the second wonderful and amazing quality found in me.

‘‘Tassa mayhaṃ, bhante, catasso komāriyo pajāpatiyo ahesuṃ. Atha khvāhaṃ, bhante, yena tā pajāpatiyo tenupasaṅkamiṃ; upasaṅkamitvā tā pajāpatiyo etadavacaṃ – ‘mayā kho, bhaginiyo, brahmacariyapañcamāni sikkhāpadāni samādinnāni. Yā icchati sā idheva bhoge ca bhuñjatu puññāni ca karotu, sakāni vā ñātikulāni gacchatu. Hoti vā pana purisādhippāyo, kassa vo dammī’ti? Evaṃ vutte sā, bhante, jeṭṭhā pajāpati maṃ etadavoca – ‘itthannāmassa maṃ, ayyaputta, purisassa dehī’ti. Atha kho ahaṃ, bhante, taṃ purisaṃ pakkosāpetvā vāmena hatthena pajāpatiṃ gahetvā dakkhiṇena hatthena bhiṅgāraṃ gahetvā tassa purisassa oṇojesiṃ. Komāriṃ kho panāhaṃ, bhante, dāraṃ pariccajanto nābhijānāmi cittassa aññathattaṃ. Ayaṃ kho me, bhante, tatiyo acchariyo abbhuto dhammo saṃvijjati.

“Venerable sir, I had four young wives. Then, venerable sir, I approached those wives and said to them: ‘Sisters, I have undertaken the five training precepts that are the foundation of the holy life. Whoever among you wishes may remain here enjoying wealth and doing merit, or return to her own family and relatives. Or if there is any man you desire, to whom shall I give you?’ When this was said, venerable sir, my eldest wife said to me: ‘Young master, give me to such-and-such a man.’ Then, venerable sir, I had that man summoned and, taking my wife with my left hand and the ceremonial pitcher with my right hand, I presented her to that man. Venerable sir, I do not recall any alteration of mind when giving away my young wife. This, venerable sir, is the third wonderful and amazing quality found in me.

‘‘Saṃvijjanti kho pana me, bhante, kule bhogā. Te ca kho appaṭivibhattā sīlavantehi kalyāṇadhammehi. Ayaṃ kho me, bhante, catuttho acchariyo abbhuto dhammo saṃvijjati.

“Venerable sir, there are indeed riches in my family, and they are shared in common with virtuous people of good character. This, venerable sir, is the fourth wonderful and amazing quality found in me.

‘‘Yaṃ kho panāhaṃ, bhante, bhikkhuṃ payirupāsāmi; sakkaccaṃyeva payirupāsāmi, no asakkaccaṃ. So ce me āyasmā dhammaṃ deseti; sakkaccaṃyeva suṇomi, no asakkaccaṃ. No ce me so āyasmā dhammaṃ deseti, ahamassa dhammaṃ desemi. Ayaṃ kho me, bhante, pañcamo acchariyo abbhuto dhammo saṃvijjati.

“Venerable sir, when I attend upon a monk, I attend upon him respectfully, not disrespectfully. If that venerable one teaches me the Dhamma, I listen respectfully, not disrespectfully. If that venerable one does not teach me the Dhamma, I teach him the Dhamma. This, venerable sir, is the fifth wonderful and amazing quality found in me.

‘‘Anacchariyaṃ kho pana, bhante, saṅghe nimantite devatā upasaṅkamitvā ārocenti – ‘asuko, gahapati, bhikkhu ubhatobhāgavimutto asuko paññāvimutto asuko kāyasakkhī asuko diṭṭhippatto [diṭṭhappatto (ka.)] asuko saddhāvimutto asuko dhammānusārī asuko saddhānusārī asuko sīlavā kalyāṇadhammo asuko dussīlo pāpadhammo’ti. Saṅghaṃ kho panāhaṃ, bhante, parivisanto nābhijānāmi evaṃ cittaṃ uppādento – ‘imassa vā thokaṃ demi imassa vā bahuka’nti. Atha khvāhaṃ, bhante, samacittova demi. Ayaṃ kho me, bhante, chaṭṭho acchariyo abbhuto dhammo saṃvijjati.

“It is no surprise, venerable sir, that when the Saṅgha has been invited, deities approach and inform me: ‘Householder, such-and-such a monk is liberated both ways, such-and-such a monk is liberated by wisdom, such-and-such a monk is a body-witness, such-and-such a monk is attained to view, such-and-such a monk is liberated by faith, such-and-such a monk is a Dhamma-follower, such-and-such a monk is a faith-follower, such-and-such a monk is virtuous, with good qualities, such-and-such a monk is unvirtuous, with bad qualities.’ But, venerable sir, when I serve the Saṅgha, I do not recall producing such a thought as: ‘I will give a little to this one or a lot to that one.’ Rather, venerable sir, I give with an even mind. This, venerable sir, is the sixth wonderful and amazing quality found in me.

‘‘Anacchariyaṃ kho pana maṃ, bhante, devatā upasaṅkamitvā ārocenti – ‘svākkhāto, gahapati, bhagavatā dhammo’ti. Evaṃ vutte ahaṃ, bhante, tā devatā evaṃ vademi – ‘vadeyyātha vā evaṃ kho tumhe devatā no vā vadeyyātha, atha kho svākkhāto bhagavatā dhammo’ti. Na kho panāhaṃ, bhante, abhijānāmi tatonidānaṃ cittassa unnatiṃ – ‘maṃ tā devatā upasaṅkamanti, ahaṃ vā devatāhi saddhiṃ sallapāmī’ti. Ayaṃ kho me, bhante, sattamo acchariyo abbhuto dhammo saṃvijjati.

“It is no surprise, venerable sir, that deities approach me and announce: ‘Householder, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One.’ When this is said, venerable sir, I say to those deities: ‘Whether you deities say so or not, the Dhamma is indeed well proclaimed by the Blessed One.’ But, venerable sir, I do not recognize any mental elevation arising from that reason, thinking: ‘The deities approach me, and I converse with the deities.’ This, venerable sir, is the seventh wonderful and amazing quality found in me.

‘‘Sace kho panāhaṃ, bhante, bhagavato paṭhamataraṃ kālaṃ kareyyaṃ, anacchariyaṃ kho panetaṃ yaṃ maṃ bhagavā evaṃ byākareyya – ‘natthi taṃ saṃyojanaṃ yena saṃyutto uggo gahapati hatthigāmako puna imaṃ lokaṃ āgaccheyyā’ti. Ayaṃ kho me, bhante, aṭṭhamo acchariyo abbhuto dhammo saṃvijjati. Ime kho me, bhante, aṭṭha acchariyā abbhutā dhammā saṃvijjanti. Na ca kho ahaṃ jānāmi – katamehi cāhaṃ aṭṭhahi acchariyehi abbhutehi dhammehi samannāgato bhagavatā byākato’’ti.

“Venerable sir, if I were to die before the Blessed One, it would not be surprising if the Blessed One were to declare of me thus: ‘There is no fetter by which Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma is bound that would bring him back to this world.’ This, venerable sir, is the eighth wonderful and amazing quality that exists in me. These, venerable sir, are the eight wonderful and amazing qualities that exist in me. But I do not know by which eight wonderful and amazing qualities I am endowed and have been declared so by the Blessed One.”

‘‘Atha kho so bhikkhu uggassa gahapatino hatthigāmakassa nivesane piṇḍapātaṃ gahetvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkāmi. Atha kho so bhikkhu pacchābhattaṃ piṇḍapātapaṭikkanto yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho so bhikkhu yāvatako ahosi uggena gahapatinā hatthigāmakena saddhiṃ kathāsallāpo, taṃ sabbaṃ bhagavato ārocesi.

Then that monk, having received almsfood at the residence of Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma, rose from his seat and departed. Then, after the meal, returning from the almsround, that monk approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, that monk reported to the Blessed One the entire conversation he had with Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma.

‘‘Sādhu sādhu, bhikkhu! Yathā taṃ uggo gahapati hatthigāmako sammā byākaramāno byākareyya, imeheva kho bhikkhu, aṭṭhahi acchariyehi abbhutehi dhammehi samannāgato uggo gahapati hatthigāmako mayā byākato. Imehi ca pana, bhikkhu, aṭṭhahi acchariyehi abbhutehi dhammehi samannāgataṃ uggaṃ gahapatiṃ hatthigāmakaṃ dhārehī’’ti. Dutiyaṃ.

“Good, good, monk! Just as Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma would rightly declare, so it is. Indeed, monk, Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma has been declared by me as possessing these eight wonderful and amazing qualities. And therefore, monk, remember Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma as endowed with these eight wonderful and amazing qualities.” This is the second.
