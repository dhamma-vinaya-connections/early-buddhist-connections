78. [a. ni. 8.62] Tatra kho āyasmā sāriputto bhikkhū āmantesi…pe… chahāvuso, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu alaṃ attano, alaṃ paresaṃ. Katamehi chahi? Idhāvuso, bhikkhu khippanisanti ca hoti kusalesu dhammesu; sutānañca dhammānaṃ dhāraṇajātiko hoti; dhātānañca dhammānaṃ atthūpaparikkhitā hoti; atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya dhammānudhammappaṭipanno ca hoti; kalyāṇavāco ca hoti kalyāṇavākkaraṇo, poriyā vācāya samannāgato vissaṭṭhāya anelagaḷāya atthassa viññāpaniyā; sandassako ca hoti samādapako samuttejako sampahaṃsako sabrahmacārīnaṃ. Imehi kho, āvuso, chahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu alaṃ attano, alaṃ paresaṃ.

78.Then the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: “Friends, a bhikkhu endowed with six qualities is sufficient for himself and sufficient for others. What six? Here, friends, a bhikkhu is quick in discerning wholesome qualities; he is one who retains the teachings he has heard; he is one who examines the meaning of the teachings he has retained; having understood the meaning and the Dhamma, he practices in accordance with the Dhamma; he has good speech and good expression, is endowed with cultured speech that is clear, unhesitating, and capable of making the meaning understood; and he is an instructor, an inciter, an encourager, and a gladdener of his spiritual companions. A bhikkhu endowed with these six qualities, friends, is sufficient for himself and sufficient for others.”

‘‘Pañcahāvuso, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu alaṃ attano, alaṃ paresaṃ. Katamehi pañcahi? Idhāvuso, bhikkhu na heva kho khippanisanti ca hoti kusalesu dhammesu; sutānañca dhammānaṃ dhāraṇajātiko hoti; dhātānañca dhammānaṃ atthūpaparikkhitā hoti; atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya dhammānudhammappaṭipanno ca hoti; kalyāṇavāco ca hoti…pe… sandassako ca hoti…pe… sabrahmacārīnaṃ. Imehi kho, āvuso, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu alaṃ attano, alaṃ paresaṃ.

“Friends, a bhikkhu endowed with five qualities is sufficient for himself and sufficient for others. What five? Here, friends, a bhikkhu is not quick in discerning wholesome qualities; but he is one who retains the teachings he has heard; he is one who examines the meaning of the teachings he has retained; having understood the meaning and the Dhamma, he practices in accordance with the Dhamma; he has good speech and good expression, is endowed with cultured speech that is clear, unhesitating, and capable of making the meaning understood; and he is an instructor, an inciter, an encourager, and a gladdener of his spiritual companions. A bhikkhu endowed with these five qualities, friends, is sufficient for himself and sufficient for others.”

‘‘Catūhāvuso, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu alaṃ attano, nālaṃ paresaṃ. Katamehi catūhi? Idhāvuso, bhikkhu khippanisanti ca hoti kusalesu dhammesu; sutānañca dhammānaṃ dhāraṇajātiko hoti; dhātānañca dhammānaṃ atthūpaparikkhitā hoti; atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya dhammānudhammappaṭipanno ca hoti; no ca kalyāṇavāco hoti…pe… no ca sandassako hoti…pe… sabrahmacārīnaṃ. Imehi kho, āvuso, catūhi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu alaṃ attano, nālaṃ paresaṃ.

“Friends, a bhikkhu endowed with four qualities is sufficient for himself, but not for others. What four? Here, friends, a bhikkhu is quick in discerning wholesome qualities; he is one who retains the teachings he has heard; he is one who examines the meaning of the teachings he has retained; having understood the meaning and the Dhamma, he practices in accordance with the Dhamma; but he does not have good speech and good expression, is not endowed with cultured speech that is clear, unhesitating, and capable of making the meaning understood; and he is not an instructor, an inciter, an encourager, or a gladdener of his spiritual companions. A bhikkhu endowed with these four qualities, friends, is sufficient for himself, but not for others.”

‘‘Catūhāvuso, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu alaṃ paresaṃ, nālaṃ attano. Katamehi catūhi? Idhāvuso, bhikkhu khippanisanti ca hoti kusalesu dhammesu; sutānañca dhammānaṃ dhāraṇajātiko hoti; no ca dhātānaṃ dhammānaṃ atthūpaparikkhitā hoti; no ca atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya dhammānudhammappaṭipanno hoti; kalyāṇavāco ca hoti…pe… sandassako ca hoti…pe… sabrahmacārīnaṃ. Imehi kho, āvuso, catūhi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu alaṃ paresaṃ, nālaṃ attano.

“Friends, a bhikkhu endowed with four qualities is sufficient for others, but not for himself. What four? Here, friends, a bhikkhu is quick in discerning wholesome qualities; he is one who retains the teachings he has heard; but he does not examine the meaning of the teachings he has retained; nor does he, having understood the meaning and the Dhamma, practice in accordance with the Dhamma; but he has good speech and good expression, is endowed with cultured speech that is clear, unhesitating, and capable of making the meaning understood; and he is an instructor, an inciter, an encourager, and a gladdener of his spiritual companions. A bhikkhu endowed with these four qualities, friends, is sufficient for others, but not for himself.”

‘‘Tīhāvuso, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu alaṃ attano, nālaṃ paresaṃ. Katamehi tīhi? Idhāvuso, bhikkhu na heva kho khippanisanti ca hoti kusalesu dhammesu; sutānañca dhammānaṃ dhāraṇajātiko hoti; dhātānañca dhammānaṃ atthūpaparikkhitā hoti; atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya dhammānudhammappaṭipanno ca hoti; no ca kalyāṇavāco hoti…pe… no ca sandassako hoti…pe… sabrahmacārīnaṃ. Imehi kho, āvuso, tīhi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu alaṃ attano, nālaṃ paresaṃ.

“Friends, a bhikkhu endowed with three qualities is sufficient for himself, but not for others. What three? Here, friends, a bhikkhu is not quick in discerning wholesome qualities; but he is one who retains the teachings he has heard; he is one who examines the meaning of the teachings he has retained; having understood the meaning and the Dhamma, he practices in accordance with the Dhamma; but he does not have good speech and good expression, is not endowed with cultured speech that is clear, unhesitating, and capable of making the meaning understood; and he is not an instructor, an inciter, an encourager, or a gladdener of his spiritual companions. A bhikkhu endowed with these three qualities, friends, is sufficient for himself, but not for others.”

Imehi kho, āvuso, tīhi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu alaṃ paresaṃ, nālaṃ attano.

A bhikkhu endowed with these three qualities, friends, is sufficient for others, but not for himself.”

‘‘Dvīhāvuso, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu alaṃ attano, nālaṃ paresaṃ. Katamehi dvīhi? Idhāvuso, bhikkhu na heva kho khippanisanti ca hoti kusalesu dhammesu; no ca sutānaṃ dhammānaṃ dhāraṇajātiko hoti; dhātānañca dhammānaṃ atthūpaparikkhitā hoti; atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya dhammānudhammappaṭipanno ca hoti; no ca kalyāṇavāco hoti…pe… no ca sandassako hoti…pe… sabrahmacārīnaṃ. Imehi kho, āvuso, dvīhi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu alaṃ attano, nālaṃ paresaṃ.

“Friends, a bhikkhu endowed with two qualities is sufficient for himself, but not for others. What two? Here, friends, a bhikkhu is not quick in discerning wholesome qualities; nor is he one who retains the teachings he has heard; but he is one who examines the meaning of the teachings he has retained; and having understood the meaning and the Dhamma, he practices in accordance with the Dhamma; but he does not have good speech and good expression, is not endowed with cultured speech that is clear, unhesitating, and capable of making the meaning understood; and he is not an instructor, an inciter, an encourager, or a gladdener of his spiritual companions.

Idhāvuso, bhikkhu na heva kho khippanisanti ca hoti kusalesu dhammesu; no ca sutānaṃ dhammānaṃ dhāraṇajātiko hoti; no ca dhātānaṃ dhammānaṃ atthūpaparikkhitā hoti; no ca atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya dhammānudhammappaṭipanno hoti; kalyāṇavāco ca hoti kalyāṇavākkaraṇo, poriyā vācāya samannāgato vissaṭṭhāya anelagaḷāya atthassa viññāpaniyā; sandassako ca hoti samādapako samuttejako sampahaṃsako sabrahmacārīnaṃ. Imehi kho, āvuso, dvīhi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu alaṃ paresaṃ, nālaṃ attano’’ti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.
