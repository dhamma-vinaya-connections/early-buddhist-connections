# AN 8.7 Devadattavipattisuttaṃ

## AN 8.7 The Discourse on Devadatta's Ruin

7. Ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā rājagahe viharati gijjhakūṭe pabbate acirapakkante devadatte. Tatra bhagavā devadattaṃ ārabbha bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘sādhu, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kālena kālaṃ attavipattiṃ paccavekkhitā hoti. Sādhu, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kālena kālaṃ paravipattiṃ paccavekkhitā hoti. Sādhu, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kālena kālaṃ attasampattiṃ paccavekkhitā hoti. Sādhu, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kālena kālaṃ parasampattiṃ paccavekkhitā hoti. Aṭṭhahi, bhikkhave, asaddhammehi abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto devadatto āpāyiko nerayiko kappaṭṭho atekiccho’’.

7. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on the Vulture Peak Mountain, not long after Devadatta had departed. There the Blessed One, concerning Devadatta, addressed the bhikkhus: "It is good, bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu to review his own downfall from time to time. It is good, bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu to review the downfall of others from time to time. It is good, bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu to review his own accomplishment from time to time. It is good, bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu to review the accomplishment of others from time to time. Bhikkhus, Devadatta, overwhelmed and with his mind obsessed by eight unrighteous conditions, is headed for misery, for hell, to remain for an eon, incurable."

[cūḷava. 348] ‘‘Katamehi aṭṭhahi? Lābhena hi, bhikkhave, abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto devadatto āpāyiko nerayiko kappaṭṭho atekiccho. Alābhena, bhikkhave…pe… yasena, bhikkhave… ayasena, bhikkhave… sakkārena, bhikkhave… asakkārena, bhikkhave… pāpicchatāya, bhikkhave… pāpamittatāya, bhikkhave, abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto devadatto āpāyiko nerayiko kappaṭṭho atekiccho. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, aṭṭhahi asaddhammehi abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto devadatto āpāyiko nerayiko kappaṭṭho atekiccho.

"By what eight things? Indeed, bhikkhus, Devadatta, overwhelmed and with his mind obsessed by gain, is headed for misery, for hell, to remain for an eon, incurable. By loss, bhikkhus… By fame, bhikkhus… By lack of fame, bhikkhus… By honor, bhikkhus… By lack of honor, bhikkhus… By evil desire, bhikkhus… By evil friendship, bhikkhus, Devadatta, overwhelmed and with his mind obsessed, is headed for misery, for hell, to remain for an eon, incurable. Indeed, bhikkhus, Devadatta, overwhelmed and with his mind obsessed by these eight unrighteous conditions, is headed for misery, for hell, to remain for an eon, incurable."

‘‘Sādhu, bhikkhave, bhikkhu uppannaṃ lābhaṃ abhibhuyya abhibhuyya vihareyya, uppannaṃ alābhaṃ…pe… uppannaṃ yasaṃ… uppannaṃ ayasaṃ… uppannaṃ sakkāraṃ … uppannaṃ asakkāraṃ… uppannaṃ pāpicchataṃ… uppannaṃ pāpamittataṃ abhibhuyya abhibhuyya vihareyya.

It is good, bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu to dwell having overcome arisen gain again and again, having overcome arisen loss… arisen fame… arisen lack of fame… arisen honor… arisen lack of honor… arisen evil desire… arisen evil friendship again and again.

‘‘Kiñca [kathañca (ka.)], bhikkhave, bhikkhu atthavasaṃ paṭicca uppannaṃ lābhaṃ abhibhuyya abhibhuyya vihareyya, uppannaṃ alābhaṃ…pe… uppannaṃ yasaṃ… uppannaṃ ayasaṃ… uppannaṃ sakkāraṃ… uppannaṃ asakkāraṃ… uppannaṃ pāpicchataṃ… uppannaṃ pāpamittataṃ abhibhuyya abhibhuyya vihareyya?

What, bhikkhus, is the purpose for which a bhikkhu should dwell having overcome arisen gain again and again, having overcome arisen loss… arisen fame… arisen lack of fame… arisen honor… arisen lack of honor… arisen evil desire… arisen evil friendship again and again?

‘‘Yaṃ hissa, bhikkhave, uppannaṃ lābhaṃ anabhibhuyya [anabhibhūyya anabhibhūyya (ka.)] viharato uppajjeyyuṃ āsavā vighātapariḷāhā, uppannaṃ lābhaṃ abhibhuyya [abhibhūyya abhibhūyya (ka.)] viharato evaṃsa te āsavā vighātapariḷāhā na honti. Yaṃ hissa, bhikkhave, uppannaṃ alābhaṃ…pe… uppannaṃ yasaṃ… uppannaṃ ayasaṃ… uppannaṃ sakkāraṃ… uppannaṃ asakkāraṃ… uppannaṃ pāpicchataṃ… uppannaṃ pāpamittataṃ anabhibhuyya viharato uppajjeyyuṃ āsavā vighātapariḷāhā, uppannaṃ pāpamittataṃ abhibhuyya viharato evaṃsa te āsavā vighātapariḷāhā na honti. Idaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu atthavasaṃ paṭicca uppannaṃ lābhaṃ abhibhuyya abhibhuyya vihareyya, uppannaṃ alābhaṃ…pe… uppannaṃ yasaṃ… uppannaṃ ayasaṃ … uppannaṃ sakkāraṃ… uppannaṃ asakkāraṃ… uppannaṃ pāpicchataṃ… uppannaṃ pāpamittataṃ abhibhuyya abhibhuyya vihareyya.

"Bhikkhus, if, when gain has arisen, one dwells without overcoming it, taints, vexations, and feverishness would arise in him. But if, when gain has arisen, one dwells having overcome it, those taints, vexations, and feverishness do not arise in him. If, bhikkhus, when loss has arisen…fame has arisen…lack of fame has arisen…honor has arisen…lack of honor has arisen…evil desire has arisen…evil friendship has arisen, one dwells without overcoming it, taints, vexations, and feverishness would arise in him. But if, when evil friendship has arisen, one dwells having overcome it, those taints, vexations, and feverishness do not arise in him. This, bhikkhus, is the purpose for which a bhikkhu should dwell having overcome arisen gain again and again, having overcome arisen loss… having overcome arisen fame… having overcome arisen lack of fame… having overcome arisen honor… having overcome arisen lack of honor… having overcome arisen evil desire… having overcome arisen evil friendship again and again."

‘‘Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, evaṃ sikkhitabbaṃ – ‘uppannaṃ lābhaṃ abhibhuyya abhibhuyya viharissāma, uppannaṃ alābhaṃ…pe… uppannaṃ yasaṃ… uppannaṃ ayasaṃ… uppannaṃ sakkāraṃ… uppannaṃ asakkāraṃ… uppannaṃ pāpicchataṃ… uppannaṃ pāpamittataṃ abhibhuyya abhibhuyya viharissāmā’ti. Evañhi vo, bhikkhave, sikkhitabba’’nti. Sattamaṃ.

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will dwell having repeatedly overcome any gain that arises, any loss... fame... lack of fame... honor... lack of honor... evil desire... evil friendship that arises.' Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves." The seventh.
