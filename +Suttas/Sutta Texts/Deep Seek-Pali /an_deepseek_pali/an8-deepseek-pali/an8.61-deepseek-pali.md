## AN 8.61 The Discourse on Desire

61. [a. ni. 8.77] ‘‘Aṭṭhime, bhikkhave, puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ. Katame aṭṭha? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno pavivittassa viharato nirāyattavuttino icchā uppajjati lābhāya. So uṭṭhahati ghaṭati vāyamati lābhāya. Tassa uṭṭhahato ghaṭato vāyamato lābhāya lābho nuppajjati. So tena alābhena socati kilamati paridevati, urattāḷiṃ kandati, sammohaṃ āpajjati. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave – ‘bhikkhu iccho viharati lābhāya, uṭṭhahati ghaṭati vāyamati lābhāya, na ca lābhī, socī ca paridevī ca, cuto ca saddhammā’’’.

61.“Bhikkhus, these eight persons are found existing in the world. Which eight? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwelling in seclusion, living independently, a desire arises in him for gain. He rises up, strives, and exerts himself for gain. As he rises up, strives, and exerts himself for gain, gain does not arise for him. Because of that lack of gain, he sorrows, is weary, laments, beats his breast, and falls into confusion. This, bhikkhus, is called: ‘a bhikkhu who lives desiring gain, rises up, strives, and exerts himself for gain, but does not obtain gain; he is sorrowful and lamenting, and has fallen away from the true Dhamma.’”

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno pavivittassa viharato nirāyattavuttino icchā uppajjati lābhāya. So uṭṭhahati ghaṭati vāyamati lābhāya. Tassa uṭṭhahato ghaṭato vāyamato lābhāya lābho uppajjati. So tena lābhena majjati pamajjati pamādamāpajjati. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave – ‘bhikkhu iccho viharati lābhāya, uṭṭhahati ghaṭati vāyamati lābhāya, lābhī ca madī ca pamādī ca, cuto ca saddhammā’’’.

“Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwelling in seclusion, living independently, a desire arises in him for gain. He rises up, strives, and exerts himself for gain. As he rises up, strives, and exerts himself for gain, gain arises for him. He becomes intoxicated by that gain, negligent, and falls into heedlessness. This, bhikkhus, is called: ‘a bhikkhu who lives desiring gain, rises up, strives, and exerts himself for gain, obtains gain, and is intoxicated and heedless, and has fallen away from the true Dhamma.’”

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno pavivittassa viharato nirāyattavuttino icchā uppajjati lābhāya. So na uṭṭhahati na ghaṭati na vāyamati lābhāya. Tassa anuṭṭhahato aghaṭato avāyamato lābhāya lābho nuppajjati. So tena alābhena socati, kilamati, paridevati, urattāḷiṃ kandati, sammohaṃ āpajjati. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave – ‘bhikkhu iccho viharati lābhāya, na uṭṭhahati na ghaṭati na vāyamati lābhāya, na ca lābhī, socī ca paridevī ca, cuto ca saddhammā’’’.

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno pavivittassa viharato nirāyattavuttino icchā uppajjati lābhāya. So na uṭṭhahati, na ghaṭati, na vāyamati lābhāya. Tassa anuṭṭhahato, aghaṭato, avāyamato lābhāya lābho uppajjati. So tena lābhena majjati, pamajjati, pamādamāpajjati. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave – ‘bhikkhu iccho viharati lābhāya, na uṭṭhahati na ghaṭati na vāyamati lābhāya, lābhī ca madī ca, pamādī ca, cuto ca saddhammā’’’.
