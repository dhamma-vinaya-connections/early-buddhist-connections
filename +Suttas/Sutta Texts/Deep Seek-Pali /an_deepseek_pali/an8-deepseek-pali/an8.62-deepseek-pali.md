62."Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu endowed with six qualities is competent for himself and competent for others. What six? Here, Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is quick in comprehension regarding wholesome qualities; he is one who retains the teachings he has heard; he is one who examines the meaning of the teachings he has retained; understanding the meaning and the Dhamma, he practices in accordance with the Dhamma; he is good in speech and good in utterance, endowed with a refined, clear, articulate, and meaningful voice; and he is one who shows, encourages, arouses, and gladdens his fellow monks in the holy life.
