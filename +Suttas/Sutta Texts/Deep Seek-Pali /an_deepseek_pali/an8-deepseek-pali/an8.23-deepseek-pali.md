## AN 8.23 The First Hatthaka Discourse

23. Ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā āḷaviyaṃ viharati aggāḷave cetiye. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘sattahi, bhikkhave, acchariyehi abbhutehi dhammehi samannāgataṃ hatthakaṃ āḷavakaṃ dhāretha. Katamehi sattahi? Saddho hi, bhikkhave, hatthako āḷavako; sīlavā, bhikkhave, hatthako āḷavako; hirīmā, bhikkhave, hatthako āḷavako; ottappī, bhikkhave, hatthako āḷavako; bahussuto, bhikkhave, hatthako āḷavako; cāgavā, bhikkhave, hatthako āḷavako; paññavā, bhikkhave, hatthako āḷavako – imehi kho, bhikkhave, sattahi acchariyehi abbhutehi dhammehi samannāgataṃ hatthakaṃ āḷavakaṃ dhārethā’’ti. Idamavoca bhagavā. Idaṃ vatvāna sugato uṭṭhāyāsanā vihāraṃ pāvisi.

23.At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Shrine. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, bear in mind that Hatthaka of Āḷavī is endowed with seven wonderful and marvelous qualities. What seven? Bhikkhus, Hatthaka of Āḷavī is faithful; he is virtuous; he is conscientious; he is scrupulous; he is learned; he is generous; he is wise. Bhikkhus, bear in mind that Hatthaka of Āḷavī is endowed with these seven wonderful and marvelous qualities.” This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Sugata rose from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Atha kho aññataro bhikkhu pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena hatthakassa āḷavakassa nivesanaṃ tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi. Atha kho hatthako āḷavako yena so bhikkhu tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā taṃ bhikkhuṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho hatthakaṃ āḷavakaṃ so bhikkhu etadavoca –

Then a certain bhikkhu, having dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe and went to the residence of Hatthaka of Āḷavī. Having approached, he sat down on the seat prepared for him. Then Hatthaka of Āḷavī approached that bhikkhu; having approached, he paid homage to the bhikkhu and sat down to one side. As Hatthaka of Āḷavī was sitting to one side, that bhikkhu said to him:

‘‘Sattahi kho tvaṃ, āvuso, acchariyehi abbhutehi dhammehi samannāgato bhagavatā byākato. Katamehi sattahi? ‘Saddho, bhikkhave, hatthako āḷavako; sīlavā…pe… hirimā… ottappī… bahussuto… cāgavā… paññavā, bhikkhave, hatthako āḷavako’ti. Imehi kho tvaṃ, āvuso, sattahi acchariyehi abbhutehi dhammehi samannāgato bhagavatā byākato’’ti. ‘‘Kaccittha, bhante, na koci gihī ahosi odātavasano’’ti? ‘‘Na hettha, āvuso, koci gihī ahosi odātavasano’’ti. ‘‘Sādhu, bhante, yadettha na koci gihī ahosi odātavasano’’ti.

“Friend, you have been declared by the Blessed One as possessing seven wonderful and marvelous qualities. What seven? ‘Bhikkhus, Hatthaka of Āḷavī is faithful; he is virtuous; he is conscientious; he is scrupulous; he is learned; he is generous; he is wise.’ Friend, you have been declared by the Blessed One as possessing these seven wonderful and marvelous qualities.” “Venerable sir, was there no layperson dressed in white there?” “No, friend, there was no layperson dressed in white there.” “Good, venerable sir, that there was no layperson dressed in white there.”

Atha kho so bhikkhu hatthakassa āḷavakassa nivesane piṇḍapātaṃ gahetvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkāmi. Atha kho so bhikkhu pacchābhattaṃ piṇḍapātapaṭikkanto yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho so bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca –

Then that bhikkhu, having taken almsfood at the residence of Hatthaka of Āḷavī, rose from his seat and departed. Then that bhikkhu, after the meal, returning from his alms round, approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One:

‘‘Idhāhaṃ, bhante, pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena hatthakassa āḷavakassa nivesanaṃ tenupasaṅkamiṃ; upasaṅkamitvā paññatte āsane nisīdiṃ. Atha kho, bhante, hatthako āḷavako yenāhaṃ tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā maṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho ahaṃ, bhante, hatthakaṃ āḷavakaṃ etadavacaṃ – ‘sattahi kho tvaṃ, āvuso, acchariyehi abbhutehi dhammehi samannāgato bhagavatā byākato. Katamehi sattahi? Saddho, bhikkhave, hatthako āḷavako; sīlavā…pe… hirimā… ottappī… bahussuto… cāgavā… paññavā, bhikkhave, hatthako āḷavakoti. Imehi kho tvaṃ, āvuso, sattahi acchariyehi abbhutehi dhammehi samannāgato bhagavatā byākato’ti.

“Venerable sir, this morning, having dressed and taken my bowl and robe, I went to the residence of Hatthaka of Āḷavī. Having arrived, I sat down on the prepared seat. Then, venerable sir, Hatthaka of Āḷavī approached me; having approached, he paid homage to me and sat down to one side. As he was sitting to one side, venerable sir, I said to Hatthaka of Āḷavī: ‘Friend, you have been declared by the Blessed One as possessing seven wonderful and marvelous qualities. What seven? “Bhikkhus, Hatthaka of Āḷavī is faithful; he is virtuous; he is conscientious; he is scrupulous; he is learned; he is generous; he is wise.” Friend, you have been declared by the Blessed One as possessing these seven wonderful and marvelous qualities.’ ”

‘‘Evaṃ vutte, bhante, hatthako maṃ etadavoca – ‘kaccittha, bhante, na koci gihī ahosi odātavasano’ti? ‘Na hettha, āvuso, koci gihī ahosi odātavasano’ti. ‘Sādhu, bhante, yadettha na koci gihī ahosi odātavasano’’’ti.

“When this was said, venerable sir, Hatthaka said to me: ‘Venerable sir, was there no layperson dressed in white there?’ ‘No, friend, there was no layperson dressed in white there.’ ‘Good, venerable sir, that there was no layperson dressed in white there.’ ”

‘‘Sādhu sādhu, bhikkhu! Appiccho so, bhikkhu, kulaputto. Santeyeva attani kusaladhamme na icchati parehi ñāyamāne [paññāpayamāne (ka.)]. Tena hi tvaṃ, bhikkhu, imināpi aṭṭhamena acchariyena abbhutena dhammena samannāgataṃ hatthakaṃ āḷavakaṃ dhārehi, yadidaṃ appicchatāyā’’ti. Tatiyaṃ.

“Good, good, bhikkhu! That clansman, bhikkhu, is of few desires. Though he possesses wholesome qualities, he does not wish them to be known by others. Therefore, bhikkhu, you should bear in mind that Hatthaka of Āḷavī is endowed with this eighth wonderful and marvelous quality, namely, being of few desires.” The Third.
