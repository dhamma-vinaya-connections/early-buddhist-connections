# AN 1.227

331. … Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, appakā te sattā ye saṃvejaniyesu ṭhānesu saṃvijjanti; atha kho eteva sattā bahutarā ye saṃvejaniyesu ṭhānesu na saṃvijjanti.

331.… Just so, monks, few are those beings who are roused to spiritual urgency at occasions for spiritual urgency; but many more are those beings who are not roused to spiritual urgency at occasions for spiritual urgency.
