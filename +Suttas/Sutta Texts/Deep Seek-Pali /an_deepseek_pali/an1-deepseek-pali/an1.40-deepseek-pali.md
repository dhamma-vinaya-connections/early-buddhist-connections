# AN 1.40

44. ‘‘Idhāhaṃ, bhikkhave, ekaccaṃ puggalaṃ pasannacittaṃ evaṃ cetasā ceto paricca pajānāmi – ‘imamhi ce ayaṃ samaye puggalo kālaṃ kareyya, yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ sagge’. Taṃ kissa hetu? Cittaṃ hissa, bhikkhave, pasannaṃ. ‘‘Cetopasādahetu pana, bhikkhave, evamidhekacce sattā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjantī’’ti. Catutthaṃ.

44. Here, monks, I discern, having encompassed with my mind the mind of a certain person whose mind is serene: ‘If this person were to die at this time, they would be cast into heaven as if carried there.’ Why is that? Because, monks, their mind is serene. Monks, it is due to serenity of mind that some beings here, after the breakup of the body, at death, are reborn in a good destination, a heavenly world. The fourth.

45. ‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, udakarahado āvilo luḷito kalalībhūto tattha cakkhumā puriso tīre ṭhito na passeyya sippisambukampi [sippikasambukampi (ka.)] sakkharakaṭhalampi macchagumbampi carantampi tiṭṭhantampi. Taṃ kissa hetu? Āvilattā, bhikkhave, udakassa. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, so vata bhikkhu āvilena cittena attatthaṃ vā ñassati paratthaṃ vā ñassati ubhayatthaṃ vā ñassati uttariṃ vā manussadhammā alamariyañāṇadassanavisesaṃ sacchikarissatīti netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati. Taṃ kissa hetu? Āvilattā, bhikkhave, cittassā’’ti. Pañcamaṃ.

45. "Suppose, monks, there is a pool of water that is turbid, stirred up, and muddy. A person with good eyesight standing on the bank would not see the shells, gravel and pebbles, or the schools of fish swimming about or staying still. Why is that? Because of the turbidity of the water. In the same way, monks, it is not possible that a monk with a turbid mind can know what is for his own good, or what is for the good of others, or what is for the good of both, or that he will realize a superior human state, the special knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. Why is that? Because of the turbidity of the mind." This is the fifth.
