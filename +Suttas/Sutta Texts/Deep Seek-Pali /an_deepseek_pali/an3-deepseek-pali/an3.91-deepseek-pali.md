## AN 3.91 The Discourse at Saṅkavā

92. Ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā kosalesu cārikaṃ caramāno mahatā bhikkhusaṅghena saddhiṃ yena saṅkavā [paṅkadhā (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] nāma kosalānaṃ nigamo tadavasari.

Atha kho kassapagottassa bhikkhuno bhagavati sikkhāpadapaṭisaṃyuttāya dhammiyā kathāya bhikkhū sandassente samādapente samuttejente sampahaṃsente ahudeva akkhanti ahu appaccayo – ‘‘adhisallikhatevāyaṃ [adhisallekhatevāyaṃ (syā. kaṃ. ka.)] samaṇo’’ti. Atha kho bhagavā saṅkavāyaṃ yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena rājagahaṃ tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena rājagahaṃ tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā rājagahe viharati.

92.At one time the Blessed One was traveling through the Kosala country with a large company of bhikkhus when he arrived at Saṅkavā, a Kosalan market town. There the Blessed One stayed at Saṅkavā. Now at that time a bhikkhu named Kassapagotta was a resident at Saṅkavā. There the Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with the training rules. But while the Blessed One was instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with the training rules, the bhikkhu Kassapagotta felt impatience and displeasure, thinking, "This ascetic is being too exacting." Then, after staying at Saṅkavā as long as he pleased, the Blessed One set out on tour for Rājagaha. Traveling by stages, he arrived at Rājagaha and stayed there.

Atha kho kassapagottassa bhikkhuno acirapakkantassa bhagavato ahudeva kukkuccaṃ ahu vippaṭisāro – ‘‘alābhā vata me, na vata me lābhā; dulladdhaṃ vata me, na vata me suladdhaṃ; yassa me bhagavati sikkhāpadapaṭisaṃyuttāya dhammiyā kathāya bhikkhū sandassente samādapente samuttejente sampahaṃsente ahudeva akkhanti ahu appaccayo – ‘adhisallikhatevāyaṃ samaṇo’ti. Yaṃnūnāhaṃ yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkameyyaṃ; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavato santike accayaṃ accayato deseyya’’nti. Atha kho kassapagotto bhikkhu senāsanaṃ saṃsāmetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena rājagahaṃ tena pakkāmi. Anupubbena yena rājagahaṃ yena gijjhakūṭo pabbato yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho kassapagotto bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca –

Then, not long after the Blessed One had left, Kassapagotta the bhikkhu experienced unease and remorse: "It is truly my loss, indeed no gain for me; it is truly my misfortune, indeed no good fortune for me, that when the Blessed One was instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with the training rules, I felt impatience and displeasure, thinking, 'This ascetic is being too exacting.' What if I were to go to the Blessed One and, having approached, confess my transgression as a transgression in his presence?" Then Kassapagotta the bhikkhu, having put his lodging in order and taking his bowl and robe, set out for Rājagaha. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Rājagaha, then went to Vulture Peak Mountain, to the Blessed One. Approaching, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, Kassapagotta the bhikkhu said to the Blessed One:

‘‘Ekamidaṃ, bhante, samayaṃ bhagavā saṅkavāyaṃ viharati, saṅkavā nāma kosalānaṃ nigamo. Tatra, bhante, bhagavā sikkhāpadapaṭisaṃyuttāya dhammiyā kathāya bhikkhū sandassesi samādapesi samuttejesi sampahaṃsesi. Tassa mayhaṃ bhagavati sikkhāpadapaṭisaṃyuttāya dhammiyā kathāya bhikkhū sandassente samādapente samuttejente sampahaṃsente ahudeva akkhanti ahu appaccayo – ‘adhisallikhatevāyaṃ samaṇo’ti. Atha kho bhagavā saṅkavāyaṃ yathābhirantaṃ viharitvā yena rājagahaṃ tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. ( ) [(anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena rājagahaṃ tadavasari. tatra sudaṃ bhagavā rājagahe viharati. atha kho (ka.)] Tassa mayhaṃ, bhante, acirapakkantassa bhagavato ahudeva kukkuccaṃ ahu vippaṭisāro – alābhā vata me, na vata me lābhā; dulladdhaṃ vata me, na vata me suladdhaṃ; yassa me bhagavati sikkhāpadapaṭisaṃyuttāya dhammiyā kathāya bhikkhū sandassente samādapente samuttejente sampahaṃsente ahudeva akkhanti ahu appaccayo – ‘adhisallikhatevāyaṃ samaṇo’ti.

"Venerable sir, on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Saṅkavā, a Kosalan market town. There, venerable sir, the Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with the training rules. While the Blessed One was instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with the training rules, I felt impatience and displeasure, thinking, 'This ascetic is being too exacting.' Then, after the Blessed One had departed from Saṅkavā, I felt unease and remorse: 'It is truly my loss, indeed no gain for me; it is truly my misfortune, indeed no good fortune for me, that when the Blessed One was instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with the training rules, I felt impatience and displeasure, thinking, "This ascetic is being too exacting." What if I were to go to the Blessed One and, having approached, confess my transgression as a transgression in his presence?' A transgression, venerable sir, has overcome me, like a fool, like one deluded, like one unskillful, in that when the Blessed One was instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with the training rules, I felt impatience and displeasure, thinking, 'This ascetic is being too exacting.' May the Blessed One accept my transgression as a transgression, venerable sir, for future restraint."

‘‘Taggha taṃ [taggha tvaṃ (sī. pī.)], kassapa, accayo accagamā yathābālaṃ yathāmūḷhaṃ yathāakusalaṃ, yassa te mayi sikkhāpadapaṭisaṃyuttāya dhammiyā kathāya bhikkhū sandassente samādapente samuttejente sampahaṃsente ahudeva akkhanti ahu appaccayo – ‘adhisallikhatevāyaṃ samaṇo’ti. Yato ca kho tvaṃ, kassapa, accayaṃ accayato disvā yathādhammaṃ paṭikarosi, taṃ te mayaṃ paṭiggaṇhāma. Vuddhihesā, kassapa, ariyassa vinaye yo accayaṃ accayato disvā yathādhammaṃ paṭikaroti, āyatiṃ saṃvaraṃ āpajjati.

"Indeed, Kassapa, a transgression has overcome you—foolishly, deludedly, unskillfully—in that when I was instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with the training rules, you felt impatience and displeasure, thinking, 'This ascetic is being too exacting.' But since you, Kassapa, have seen your transgression as a transgression and confessed it according to the Dhamma, we accept it from you. For it is growth, Kassapa, in the Noble Discipline when one sees a transgression as a transgression, confesses it according to the Dhamma, and undertakes future restraint."

‘‘Thero cepi, kassapa, bhikkhu hoti na sikkhākāmo na sikkhāsamādānassa vaṇṇavādī, ye caññe bhikkhū na sikkhākāmā te ca na sikkhāya samādapeti, ye caññe bhikkhū sikkhākāmā tesañca na vaṇṇaṃ bhaṇati bhūtaṃ tacchaṃ kālena, evarūpassāhaṃ, kassapa, therassa bhikkhuno na vaṇṇaṃ bhaṇāmi. Taṃ kissa hetu? Satthā hissa vaṇṇaṃ bhaṇatīti aññe naṃ [taṃ (sī. pī.)] bhikkhū bhajeyyuṃ, ye naṃ bhajeyyuṃ tyāssa diṭṭhānugatiṃ āpajjeyyuṃ, yyāssa diṭṭhānugatiṃ āpajjeyyuṃ tesaṃ taṃ assa dīgharattaṃ ahitāya dukkhāyāti. Tasmāhaṃ, kassapa, evarūpassa therassa bhikkhuno na vaṇṇaṃ bhaṇāmi.

"If, Kassapa, an elder bhikkhu is not desirous of the trainings and does not advocate the undertaking of the trainings, and does not encourage those other bhikkhus who are not desirous of the trainings to undertake the trainings, and does not speak truthfully, accurately, and at the right time in praise of those other bhikkhus who are desirous of the trainings—such an elder bhikkhu, Kassapa, I do not praise. Why is that? Because if the Teacher were to praise him, other bhikkhus might associate with him, and those who associate with him might follow his example, and their following his example would lead to their detriment and suffering for a long time. Therefore, Kassapa, I do not praise such an elder bhikkhu."

‘‘Majjhimo cepi, kassapa, bhikkhu hoti…pe… navo cepi, kassapa, bhikkhu hoti na sikkhākāmo na sikkhāsamādānassa vaṇṇavādī, ye caññe bhikkhū na sikkhākāmā te ca na sikkhāya samādapeti, ye caññe bhikkhū sikkhākāmā tesañca na vaṇṇaṃ bhaṇati bhūtaṃ tacchaṃ kālena, evarūpassāhaṃ, kassapa, navassa bhikkhuno na vaṇṇaṃ bhaṇāmi. Taṃ kissa hetu? Satthā hissa vaṇṇaṃ bhaṇatīti aññe naṃ bhikkhū bhajeyyuṃ, ye naṃ bhajeyyuṃ tyāssa diṭṭhānugatiṃ āpajjeyyuṃ, yyāssa diṭṭhānugatiṃ āpajjeyyuṃ tesaṃ taṃ assa dīgharattaṃ ahitāya dukkhāyāti. Tasmāhaṃ, kassapa, evarūpassa navassa bhikkhuno na vaṇṇaṃ bhaṇāmi.

"If, Kassapa, there is a middle bhikkhu…If, Kassapa, a new bhikkhu is not desirous of the trainings and does not advocate the undertaking of the trainings, and does not encourage those other bhikkhus who are not desirous of the trainings to undertake the trainings, and does not speak truthfully, accurately, and at the right time in praise of those other bhikkhus who are desirous of the trainings—such a new bhikkhu, Kassapa, I do not praise. Why is that? Because if the Teacher were to praise him, other bhikkhus might associate with him, and those who associate with him might follow his example, and if they follow his example, that would lead to their detriment and suffering for a long time. Therefore, Kassapa, I do not praise such a new bhikkhu."

‘‘Thero cepi, kassapa, bhikkhu hoti sikkhākāmo sikkhāsamādānassa vaṇṇavādī, ye caññe bhikkhū na sikkhākāmā te ca sikkhāya samādapeti, ye caññe bhikkhū sikkhākāmā tesañca vaṇṇaṃ bhaṇati bhūtaṃ tacchaṃ kālena, evarūpassāhaṃ, kassapa, therassa bhikkhuno vaṇṇaṃ bhaṇāmi. Taṃ kissa hetu? Satthā hissa vaṇṇaṃ bhaṇatīti aññe naṃ bhikkhū bhajeyyuṃ, ye naṃ bhajeyyuṃ tyāssa diṭṭhānugatiṃ āpajjeyyuṃ, yyāssa diṭṭhānugatiṃ āpajjeyyuṃ tesaṃ taṃ assa dīgharattaṃ hitāya sukhāyāti. Tasmāhaṃ, kassapa, evarūpassa therassa bhikkhuno vaṇṇaṃ bhaṇāmi.

"If, Kassapa, an elder bhikkhu is desirous of the trainings and advocates the undertaking of the trainings, and encourages those other bhikkhus who are not desirous of the trainings to undertake the trainings, and speaks truthfully, accurately, and at the right time in praise of those other bhikkhus who are desirous of the trainings—such an elder bhikkhu, Kassapa, I praise. Why is that? Because if the Teacher were to praise him, other bhikkhus might associate with him, and those who associate with him might follow his example, and their following his example would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time. Therefore, Kassapa, I praise such an elder bhikkhu."

‘‘Majjhimo cepi, kassapa, bhikkhu hoti sikkhākāmo…pe… navo cepi, kassapa, bhikkhu hoti sikkhākāmo sikkhāsamādānassa vaṇṇavādī, ye caññe bhikkhū na sikkhākāmā te ca sikkhāya samādapeti, ye caññe bhikkhū sikkhākāmā tesañca vaṇṇaṃ bhaṇati bhūtaṃ tacchaṃ kālena, evarūpassāhaṃ, kassapa, navassa bhikkhuno vaṇṇaṃ bhaṇāmi. Taṃ kissa hetu? Satthā hissa vaṇṇaṃ bhaṇatīti aññe naṃ bhikkhū bhajeyyuṃ, ye naṃ bhajeyyuṃ tyāssa diṭṭhānugatiṃ āpajjeyyuṃ, yyāssa diṭṭhānugatiṃ āpajjeyyuṃ tesaṃ taṃ assa dīgharattaṃ hitāya sukhāyāti. Tasmāhaṃ, kassapa, evarūpassa navassa bhikkhuno vaṇṇaṃ bhaṇāmī’’ti. Ekādasamaṃ.

"Even if a monk is of middle standing, Kassapa, desirous of training... or even if a newly ordained monk, Kassapa, is desirous of training, a speaker in praise of undertaking the training, and he encourages those other monks who are not desirous of training to train, and he speaks truthfully and at the right time in praise of those monks who are desirous of training—such a newly ordained monk, Kassapa, I praise. Why is that? Because other monks would associate with him thinking 'the Teacher praises him,' and those who associate with him would follow his example, and their following his example would be for their long-term welfare and happiness. Therefore, Kassapa, I praise such a newly ordained monk." The eleventh.
