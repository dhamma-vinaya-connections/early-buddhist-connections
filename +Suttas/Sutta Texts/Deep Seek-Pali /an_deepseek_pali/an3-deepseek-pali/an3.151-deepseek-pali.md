## AN 3.151 The Second Damaged Discourse

152. ‘‘Tīhi, bhikkhave…pe… sāvajjena kāyakammena, sāvajjena vacīkammena, sāvajjena manokammena…pe….

152.“Monks, one endowed with three qualities—a foolish, incompetent, ignoble person—maintains himself in a damaged and injured state, is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise, and generates much demerit. What three? Blameworthy bodily action, blameworthy verbal action, and blameworthy mental action. Monks, one endowed with these three qualities—a foolish, incompetent, ignoble person—maintains himself in a damaged and injured state, is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise, and generates much demerit.”

‘‘Tīhi, bhikkhave…pe… anavajjena kāyakammena, anavajjena vacīkammena, anavajjena manokammena…pe…. Chaṭṭhaṃ.

“Monks, one endowed with three qualities—a wise, competent, noble person—maintains himself in an undamaged and uninjured state, is blameless and irreproachable by the wise, and generates much merit. What three? Blameless bodily action, blameless verbal action, and blameless mental action. Monks, one endowed with these three qualities—a wise, competent, noble person—maintains himself in an undamaged and uninjured state, is blameless and irreproachable by the wise, and generates much merit.” Sixth.
