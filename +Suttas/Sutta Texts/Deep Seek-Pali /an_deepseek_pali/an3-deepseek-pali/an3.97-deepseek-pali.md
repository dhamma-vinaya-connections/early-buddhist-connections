# AN 3.97 Dutiyaājānīyasuttaṃ

## AN 3.97 The Second Thoroughbred Discourse.

98. ‘‘Tīhi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgato rañño bhadro assājānīyo rājāraho hoti rājabhoggo, rañño aṅganteva saṅkhayaṃ gacchati. Katamehi tīhi? Idha, bhikkhave, rañño bhadro assājānīyo vaṇṇasampanno ca hoti balasampanno ca javasampanno ca. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, tīhi aṅgehi samannāgato rañño bhadro assājānīyo rājāraho hoti rājabhoggo, rañño aṅganteva saṅkhyaṃ gacchati. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, tīhi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu āhuneyyo hoti…pe… anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassa. Katamehi tīhi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vaṇṇasampanno ca hoti balasampanno ca javasampanno ca.

98."Monks, endowed with three qualities, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is fit for a king, a king's asset, and reckoned as a limb of the king. What are the three? Here, monks, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is accomplished in appearance, accomplished in strength, and accomplished in speed. Endowed with these three qualities, monks, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is fit for a king, a king's asset, and reckoned as a limb of the king. In the same way, monks, a monk endowed with three qualities is worthy of offerings... an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What are the three? Here, monks, a monk is accomplished in appearance, accomplished in strength, and accomplished in speed."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vaṇṇasampanno hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sīlavā hoti…pe… samādāya sikkhati sikkhāpadesu. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vaṇṇasampanno hoti.

"And how, monks, is a monk accomplished in appearance? Here, monks, a monk is virtuous... he trains himself, undertaking the training rules. It is in this way, monks, that a monk is accomplished in appearance."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu balasampanno hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu āraddhavīriyo viharati akusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ pahānāya kusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ upasampadāya thāmavā daḷhaparakkamo anikkhittadhuro kusalesu dhammesu. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu balasampanno hoti.

"And how, monks, is a monk accomplished in strength? Here, monks, a monk dwells with energy aroused for abandoning unwholesome qualities and attaining wholesome qualities; firm in strength, with steadfast exertion, not neglecting the duty in regard to wholesome qualities. It is in this way, monks, that a monk is accomplished in strength."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu javasampanno hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu pañcannaṃ orambhāgiyānaṃ saṃyojanānaṃ parikkhayā opapātiko hoti tattha parinibbāyī anāvattidhammo tasmā lokā. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu javasampanno hoti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, tīhi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu āhuneyyo hoti…pe… anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassā’’ti. Chaṭṭhaṃ.

"And how, monks, is a monk accomplished in speed? Here, monks, a monk, through the destruction of the five lower fetters, is one who is reborn spontaneously, attaining final Nibbāna there, not liable to return from that world. It is in this way, monks, that a monk is accomplished in speed. Monks, a monk endowed with these three qualities is worthy of offerings... an unsurpassed field of merit for the world." The sixth.
