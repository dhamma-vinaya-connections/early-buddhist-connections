## AN 3.93 The Seclusion Discourse

94. ‘‘Tīṇimāni, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyā paribbājakā pavivekāni paññāpenti. Katamāni tīṇi? Cīvarapavivekaṃ, piṇḍapātapavivekaṃ, senāsanapavivekaṃ.

94."Monks, wanderers of other sects advocate these three kinds of seclusion. What three? Seclusion in robes, seclusion in almsfood, and seclusion in lodging."

‘‘Tatridaṃ, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyā paribbājakā cīvarapavivekasmiṃ paññāpenti, sāṇānipi dhārenti, masāṇānipi dhārenti, chavadussānipi dhārenti, paṃsukūlānipi dhārenti, tirīṭānipi dhārenti, ajinampi dhārenti, ajinakkhipampi dhārenti, kusacīrampi dhārenti, vākacīrampi dhārenti, phalakacīrampi dhārenti, kesakambalampi dhārenti, vālakambalampi dhārenti, ulūkapakkhikampi dhārenti. Idaṃ kho, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyā paribbājakā cīvarapavivekasmiṃ paññāpenti.

"Here, monks, wanderers of other sects define seclusion regarding robes: they wear hempen cloths, mixed cloths, shrouds, cast-off cloths, cloths of bark, antelope hides, strips of antelope hide, kusa-grass garments, bark garments, garments of splinters, hair blankets, horsehair blankets, or garments made of owl feathers. This, monks, is how wanderers of other sects define seclusion regarding robes."

‘‘Tatridaṃ, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyā paribbājakā piṇḍapātapavivekasmiṃ paññāpenti. Sākabhakkhāpi honti, sāmākabhakkhāpi honti, nīvārabhakkhāpi honti, daddulabhakkhāpi honti, haṭabhakkhāpi honti, kaṇabhakkhāpi honti, ācāmabhakkhāpi honti, piññākabhakkhāpi honti, tiṇabhakkhāpi honti, gomayabhakkhāpi honti, vanamūlaphalāhārā yāpenti pavattaphalabhojī. Idaṃ kho, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyā paribbājakā piṇḍapātapavivekasmiṃ paññāpenti.

"Here, monks, wanderers of other sects define seclusion regarding almsfood. They may eat greens, millet, wild rice, leather scraps, resin, bran, rice gruel, oil-cake, grass, or cow dung. They live on forest roots and fruits, eating fallen fruits. This, monks, is how wanderers of other sects define seclusion regarding almsfood."

‘‘Tatridaṃ, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyā paribbājakā senāsanapavivekasmiṃ paññāpenti araññaṃ rukkhamūlaṃ susānaṃ [rukkhamūlaṃ bhusāgāraṃ susānaṃ (ka.)] vanapatthaṃ abbhokāsaṃ palālapuñjaṃ bhusāgāraṃ [suññāgāraṃ (ka.)]. Idaṃ kho, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyā paribbājakā senāsanapavivekasmiṃ paññāpenti. Imāni kho, bhikkhave, tīṇi aññatitthiyā paribbājakā pavivekāni paññāpenti.

"Here, monks, wanderers of other sects define seclusion based on lodging. They define it as: the wilderness, the foot of a tree, a charnel ground, a forest thicket, open air, a heap of straw, or a barn. This, monks, is how wanderers of other sects define seclusion based on lodging. These, monks, are the three kinds of seclusion defined by wanderers of other sects."

‘‘Tīṇi kho panimāni, bhikkhave, imasmiṃ dhammavinaye bhikkhuno pavivekāni. Katamāni tīṇi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sīlavā ca hoti, dussīlyañcassa pahīnaṃ hoti, tena ca vivitto hoti; sammādiṭṭhiko ca hoti, micchādiṭṭhi cassa pahīnā hoti, tāya ca vivitto hoti; khīṇāsavo ca hoti, āsavā cassa pahīnā honti, tehi ca vivitto hoti. Yato kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sīlavā hoti, dussīlyañcassa pahīnaṃ hoti, tena ca vivitto hoti; sammādiṭṭhiko ca hoti, micchādiṭṭhi cassa pahīnā hoti, tāya ca vivitto hoti; khīṇāsavo ca hoti, āsavā cassa pahīnā honti, tehi ca vivitto hoti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, ‘bhikkhu aggappatto sārappatto suddho sāre patiṭṭhito’’’.

"But there are, monks, these three kinds of seclusion for a monk in this Dhamma and Discipline. What are the three? Here, monks, a monk is virtuous and has abandoned unvirtuous behavior, and is secluded from it; he has right view and has abandoned wrong view, and is secluded from it; he is one whose taints are destroyed and has abandoned the taints, and is secluded from them. When, monks, a monk is virtuous and has abandoned unvirtuous behavior, and is secluded from it; has right view and has abandoned wrong view, and is secluded from it; is one whose taints are destroyed and has abandoned the taints, and is secluded from them—he is called, monks, ‘a monk who has reached the peak, reached the essence, is pure and established in the essence.’"

‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, kassakassa gahapatissa sampannaṃ sālikkhettaṃ. Tamenaṃ kassako gahapati sīghaṃ sīghaṃ [sīghasīghaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] lavāpeyya. Sīghaṃ sīghaṃ lavāpetvā sīghaṃ sīghaṃ saṅgharāpeyya. Sīghaṃ sīghaṃ saṅgharāpetvā sīghaṃ sīghaṃ ubbahāpeyya [ubbāhāpeyya (syā. kaṃ.)]. Sīghaṃ sīghaṃ ubbahāpetvā sīghaṃ sīghaṃ puñjaṃ kārāpeyya. Sīghaṃ sīghaṃ puñjaṃ kārāpetvā sīghaṃ sīghaṃ maddāpeyya. Sīghaṃ sīghaṃ maddāpetvā sīghaṃ sīghaṃ palālāni uddharāpeyya. Sīghaṃ sīghaṃ palālāni uddharāpetvā sīghaṃ sīghaṃ bhusikaṃ uddharāpeyya. Sīghaṃ sīghaṃ bhusikaṃ uddharāpetvā sīghaṃ sīghaṃ opunāpeyya. Sīghaṃ sīghaṃ opunāpetvā sīghaṃ sīghaṃ atiharāpeyya. Sīghaṃ sīghaṃ atiharāpetvā sīghaṃ sīghaṃ koṭṭāpeyya. Sīghaṃ sīghaṃ koṭṭāpetvā sīghaṃ sīghaṃ thusāni uddharāpeyya. Evamassu [evassu (ka.)] tāni, bhikkhave, kassakassa gahapatissa dhaññāni aggappattāni sārappattāni suddhāni sāre patiṭṭhitāni.

"Just as, monks, a farmer householder has a rice field that is ripe. That farmer householder would quickly have it harvested. Having quickly had it harvested, he would quickly have it gathered together. Having quickly had it gathered together, he would quickly have it carried to the threshing floor. Having quickly had it carried to the threshing floor, he would quickly have it piled up. Having quickly had it piled up, he would quickly have it threshed. Having quickly had it threshed, he would quickly have the stalks removed. Having quickly had the stalks removed, he would quickly have the chaff removed. Having quickly had the chaff removed, he would quickly have it winnowed. Having quickly had it winnowed, he would quickly have it brought in. Having quickly had it brought in, he would quickly have it pounded. Having quickly had it pounded, he would quickly have the husks removed. Thus, monks, those grains of the farmer householder would reach the highest point, reach the essence, be pure, and be established in the essence."

‘‘Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, yato bhikkhu sīlavā ca hoti, dussīlyañcassa pahīnaṃ hoti, tena ca vivitto hoti; sammādiṭṭhiko ca hoti, micchādiṭṭhi cassa pahīnā hoti, tāya ca vivitto hoti; khīṇāsavo ca hoti, āsavā cassa pahīnā honti, tehi ca vivitto hoti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, ‘bhikkhu aggappatto sārappatto suddho sāre patiṭṭhito’’’ti. Dutiyaṃ.

"Just so, monks, when a monk is virtuous and immorality is abandoned in him, and he is secluded from it; has right view and wrong view is abandoned in him, and he is secluded from it; is with taints destroyed and the taints are abandoned in him, and he is secluded from them. This, monks, is called a monk who has reached the highest, reached the essence, is pure, and is established in the essence." The second.
