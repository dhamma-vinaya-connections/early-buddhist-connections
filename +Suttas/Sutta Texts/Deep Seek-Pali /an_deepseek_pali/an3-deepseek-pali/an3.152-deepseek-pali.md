## AN 3.152 The Third Damaged Discourse

153. ‘‘Tīhi, bhikkhave…pe… visamena kāyakammena, visamena vacīkammena, visamena manokammena…pe….

153.“Monks, one endowed with three qualities—a foolish, incompetent, ignoble person—maintains himself in a damaged and injured state, is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise, and generates much demerit. What three? Uneven bodily action, uneven verbal action, and uneven mental action. Monks, one endowed with these three qualities—a foolish, incompetent, ignoble person—maintains himself in a damaged and injured state, is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise, and generates much demerit.”

‘‘Tīhi, bhikkhave…pe… samena kāyakammena, samena vacīkammena, samena manokammena…pe…. Sattamaṃ.

“Monks, one endowed with three qualities—a wise, competent, noble person—maintains himself in an undamaged and uninjured state, is blameless and irreproachable by the wise, and generates much merit. What three? Even bodily action, even verbal action, and even mental action. Monks, one endowed with these three qualities—a wise, competent, noble person—maintains himself in an undamaged and uninjured state, is blameless and irreproachable by the wise, and generates much merit.” Seventh.
