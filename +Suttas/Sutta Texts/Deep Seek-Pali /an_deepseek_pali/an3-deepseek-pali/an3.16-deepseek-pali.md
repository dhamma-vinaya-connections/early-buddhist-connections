# AN 3.16 Apaṇṇakasuttaṃ

## AN 3.16 The Sure Thing Discourse

16. ‘‘Tīhi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu apaṇṇakapaṭipadaṃ [apaṇṇakataṃ paṭipadaṃ (sī. pī.) ṭīkāya pana sameti] paṭipanno hoti, yoni cassa āraddhā hoti āsavānaṃ khayāya. Katamehi tīhi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu indriyesu guttadvāro hoti, bhojane mattaññū hoti, jāgariyaṃ anuyutto hoti.

16. Monks, a bhikkhu endowed with three qualities has entered upon the sure-thing practice, and the proper course for the destruction of the taints has been undertaken by him. What three? Here, monks, a bhikkhu is one who guards the doors of his sense faculties, is moderate in eating, and is devoted to wakefulness.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu indriyesu guttadvāro hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu cakkhunā rūpaṃ disvā na nimittaggāhī hoti nānubyañjanaggāhī. Yatvādhikaraṇamenaṃ [yatvādhikaraṇametaṃ (sī.)] cakkhundriyaṃ asaṃvutaṃ viharantaṃ abhijjhādomanassā pāpakā akusalā dhammā anvāssaveyyuṃ tassa saṃvarāya paṭipajjati, rakkhati cakkhundriyaṃ, cakkhundriye saṃvaraṃ āpajjati. Sotena saddaṃ sutvā… ghānena gandhaṃ ghāyitvā… jivhāya rasaṃ sāyitvā… kāyena phoṭṭhabbaṃ phusitvā… manasā dhammaṃ viññāya na nimittaggāhī hoti nānubyañjanaggāhī. Yatvādhikaraṇamenaṃ manindriyaṃ asaṃvutaṃ viharantaṃ abhijjhādomanassā pāpakā akusalā dhammā anvāssaveyyuṃ tassa saṃvarāya paṭipajjati, rakkhati manindriyaṃ, manindriye saṃvaraṃ āpajjati. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu indriyesu guttadvāro hoti.

And how, monks, does a monk guard the doors of the senses? Here, monks, having seen a form with the eye, a monk is not a taker of signs, not a taker of details. Because if he were to dwell unrestrained in the eye-faculty, evil, unwholesome qualities, covetousness and displeasure, would invade him, he practices for its restraint, he guards the eye-faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye-faculty. Having heard a sound with the ear... Having smelled an odor with the nose... Having tasted a flavor with the tongue... Having felt a tactile sensation with the body... Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, he is not a taker of signs, not a taker of details. Because if he were to dwell unrestrained in the mind-faculty, evil, unwholesome qualities, covetousness and displeasure, would invade him, he practices for its restraint, he guards the mind-faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the mind-faculty. It is in this way, monks, that a monk guards the doors of the senses.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu bhojane mattaññū hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu paṭisaṅkhā yoniso āhāraṃ āhāreti – ‘neva davāya na madāya na maṇḍanāya na vibhūsanāya, yāvadeva imassa kāyassa ṭhitiyā yāpanāya vihiṃsūparatiyā brahmacariyānuggahāya, iti purāṇañca vedanaṃ paṭihaṅkhāmi, navañca vedanaṃ na uppādessāmi, yātrā ca me bhavissati anavajjatā ca phāsuvihāro cā’ti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu bhojane mattaññū hoti.

And how, monks, is a monk moderate in eating? Here, monks, reflecting wisely, a monk consumes food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for personal charm nor for beautification, but only for the support and maintenance of this body, for keeping it free from harm, for assisting the holy life, thinking: 'Thus I shall put an end to old feelings and shall not arouse new feelings, and I shall be sustained, blameless, and dwell at ease.' It is in this way, monks, that a monk is moderate in eating.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu jāgariyaṃ anuyutto hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu divasaṃ caṅkamena nisajjāya āvaraṇīyehi dhammehi cittaṃ parisodheti, rattiyā paṭhamaṃ yāmaṃ caṅkamena nisajjāya āvaraṇīyehi dhammehi cittaṃ parisodheti, rattiyā majjhimaṃ yāmaṃ dakkhiṇena passena sīhaseyyaṃ kappeti pāde pādaṃ accādhāya sato sampajāno uṭṭhānasaññaṃ manasi karitvā, rattiyā pacchimaṃ yāmaṃ paccuṭṭhāya caṅkamena nisajjāya āvaraṇīyehi dhammehi cittaṃ parisodheti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu jāgariyaṃ anuyutto hoti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, tīhi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu apaṇṇakapaṭipadaṃ paṭipanno hoti, yoni cassa āraddhā hoti āsavānaṃ khayāyā’’ti. Chaṭṭhaṃ.

And how, monks, is a monk devoted to wakefulness? Here, monks, during the day, while walking back and forth and sitting, a monk purifies his mind of obstructive qualities. In the first watch of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind of obstructive qualities. In the middle watch of the night he adopts the lion posture, lying on his right side, placing one foot on top of the other, mindful and fully aware, having fixed his mind on the perception of rising. In the last watch of the night, having risen, while walking back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind of obstructive qualities. It is in this way, monks, that a monk is devoted to wakefulness. Endowed with these three qualities, monks, a monk has entered upon the infallible practice, and the basis for him is established for the destruction of the taints." The sixth.
