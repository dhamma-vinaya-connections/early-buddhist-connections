## AN 3.69 The Roots of Unwholesomeness

70. ‘‘Tīṇimāni, bhikkhave, akusalamūlāni. Katamāni tīṇi? Lobho akusalamūlaṃ, doso akusalamūlaṃ, moho akusalamūlaṃ.

70.“Monks, these are the three roots of unwholesomeness. Which three? Greed is a root of unwholesomeness, hatred is a root of unwholesomeness, delusion is a root of unwholesomeness.

‘‘Yadapi, bhikkhave, lobho tadapi akusalamūlaṃ [akusalaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)]; yadapi luddho abhisaṅkharoti kāyena vācāya manasā tadapi akusalaṃ [akusalamūlaṃ (ka.)]; yadapi luddho lobhena abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto parassa asatā dukkhaṃ uppādayati [upadahati (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] vadhena vā bandhanena vā jāniyā vā garahāya vā pabbājanāya vā balavamhi balattho itipi tadapi akusalaṃ [idaṃ pana sabbatthapi evameva dissati]. Itissame lobhajā lobhanidānā lobhasamudayā lobhapaccayā aneke pāpakā akusalā dhammā sambhavanti.

“Whatever, monks, is greed—that is an unwholesome root. Whatever a greedy person, being greedy, fabricates by body, speech, or mind—that too is unwholesome. Whatever suffering a greedy person, overcome by greed, with mind overwhelmed, inflicts upon another untruthfully, by means of killing, imprisonment, deprivation of property, censure, or banishment, [thinking,] ‘I am strong, I want strength’—that too is unwholesome. Thus, many evil, unwholesome states are born of greed, originate from greed, arise from greed, and are conditioned by greed.

‘‘Yadapi, bhikkhave, doso tadapi akusalamūlaṃ; yadapi duṭṭho abhisaṅkharoti kāyena vācāya manasā tadapi akusalaṃ; yadapi duṭṭho dosena abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto parassa asatā dukkhaṃ uppādayati vadhena vā bandhanena vā jāniyā vā garahāya vā pabbājanāya vā balavamhi balattho itipi tadapi akusalaṃ. Itissame dosajā dosanidānā dosasamudayā dosapaccayā aneke pāpakā akusalā dhammā sambhavanti.

“Whatever, monks, is hatred—that is an unwholesome root. Whatever a hateful person, being hateful, fabricates by body, speech, or mind—that too is unwholesome. Whatever suffering a hateful person, overcome by hatred, with mind overwhelmed, inflicts upon another untruthfully, by means of killing, imprisonment, deprivation of property, censure, or banishment, [thinking,] ‘I am strong, I want strength’—that too is unwholesome. Thus, many evil, unwholesome states are born of hatred, originate from hatred, arise from hatred, and are conditioned by hatred.

‘‘Yadapi, bhikkhave, moho tadapi akusalamūlaṃ; yadapi mūḷho abhisaṅkharoti kāyena vācāya manasā tadapi akusalaṃ; yadapi mūḷho mohena abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto parassa asatā dukkhaṃ uppādayati vadhena vā bandhanena vā jāniyā vā garahāya vā pabbājanāya vā balavamhi balattho itipi tadapi akusalaṃ. Itissame mohajā mohanidānā mohasamudayā mohapaccayā aneke pāpakā akusalā dhammā sambhavanti. Evarūpo cāyaṃ, bhikkhave, puggalo vuccati akālavādītipi, abhūtavādītipi, anatthavādītipi, adhammavādītipi, avinayavādītipi.

“Whatever, monks, is delusion—that is an unwholesome root. Whatever a deluded person, being deluded, fabricates by body, speech, or mind—that too is unwholesome. Whatever suffering a deluded person, overcome by delusion, with mind overwhelmed, inflicts upon another untruthfully, by means of killing, imprisonment, deprivation of property, censure, or banishment, [thinking,] ‘I am strong, I want strength’—that too is unwholesome. Thus, many evil, unwholesome states are born of delusion, originate from delusion, arise from delusion, and are conditioned by delusion. Such a person, monks, is called a speaker of what is untimely, a speaker of what is untrue, a speaker of what is unbeneficial, a speaker of what is contrary to the Dhamma, and a speaker of what is contrary to the Vinaya.

‘‘Kasmā cāyaṃ, bhikkhave, evarūpo puggalo vuccati akālavādītipi, abhūtavādītipi, anatthavādītipi, adhammavādītipi, avinayavādītipi? Tathāhāyaṃ, bhikkhave, puggalo parassa asatā dukkhaṃ uppādayati vadhena vā bandhanena vā jāniyā vā garahāya vā pabbājanāya vā balavamhi balattho itipi. Bhūtena kho pana vuccamāno avajānāti, no paṭijānāti; abhūtena vuccamāno na ātappaṃ karoti, tassa nibbeṭhanāya itipetaṃ atacchaṃ itipetaṃ abhūtanti. Tasmā evarūpo puggalo vuccati akālavādītipi, abhūtavādītipi, anatthavādītipi, adhammavādītipi, avinayavādītipi.

“And why, monks, is such a person called a speaker of what is untimely, a speaker of what is untrue, a speaker of what is unbeneficial, a speaker of what is contrary to the Dhamma, and a speaker of what is contrary to the Vinaya? Because, monks, such a person causes suffering to another untruthfully, by means of killing, imprisonment, deprivation of property, censure, or banishment, [thinking,] ‘I am strong, I want strength.’ But when spoken to truthfully, he scorns and does not acknowledge it. When spoken to untruthfully, he makes no effort to refute it, saying, ‘This is not so, this is untrue.’ Therefore, such a person is called a speaker of what is untimely, a speaker of what is untrue, a speaker of what is unbeneficial, a speaker of what is contrary to the Dhamma, and a speaker of what is contrary to the Vinaya.

‘‘Evarūpo, bhikkhave, puggalo lobhajehi pāpakehi akusalehi dhammehi abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto diṭṭhe ceva dhamme dukkhaṃ viharati, savighātaṃ saupāyāsaṃ sapariḷāhaṃ. Kāyassa ca bhedā paraṃ maraṇā duggati pāṭikaṅkhā.

“Monks, such a person, overcome by evil, unwholesome states born of greed, with mind overwhelmed, dwells in suffering in this very life, with vexation, with distress, and with fever. And upon the breakup of the body, after death, a bad destination is to be expected.

‘‘Dosajehi…pe… mohajehi pāpakehi akusalehi dhammehi abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto diṭṭhe ceva dhamme dukkhaṃ viharati, savighātaṃ saupāyāsaṃ sapariḷāhaṃ. Kāyassa ca bhedā paraṃ maraṇā duggati pāṭikaṅkhā. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, sālo vā dhavo vā phandano vā tīhi māluvālatāhi uddhasto pariyonaddho anayaṃ āpajjati, byasanaṃ āpajjati, anayabyasanaṃ āpajjati; evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, evarūpo puggalo lobhajehi pāpakehi akusalehi dhammehi abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto diṭṭhe ceva dhamme dukkhaṃ viharati, savighātaṃ saupāyāsaṃ sapariḷāhaṃ. Kāyassa ca bhedā paraṃ maraṇā duggati pāṭikaṅkhā.

“Overcome by evil, unwholesome states born of hatred... overcome by evil, unwholesome states born of delusion, with mind overwhelmed, one dwells in suffering in this very life, with vexation, with distress, and with fever. And upon the breakup of the body, after death, a bad destination is to be expected. Just as, monks, a sal tree, a dhava tree, or a phandana tree is overthrown and enveloped by three māluvā creepers, meets with misfortune, meets with disaster, meets with misfortune and disaster; in the same way, monks, such a person—overcome by evil, unwholesome states born of greed, with mind overwhelmed—dwells in suffering in this very life, with vexation, with distress, and with fever. And upon the breakup of the body, after death, a bad destination is to be expected.

‘‘Dosajehi…pe… mohajehi pāpakehi akusalehi dhammehi abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto diṭṭhe ceva dhamme dukkhaṃ viharati savighātaṃ saupāyāsaṃ sapariḷāhaṃ. Kāyassa ca bhedā paraṃ maraṇā duggati pāṭikaṅkhā. Imāni kho, bhikkhave, tīṇi akusalamūlānīti.

“Overcome by evil, unwholesome states born of hatred... overcome by evil, unwholesome states born of delusion, with mind overwhelmed, one dwells in suffering in this very life, with vexation, with distress, and with fever. And upon the breakup of the body, after death, a bad destination is to be expected. These, monks, are the three roots of unwholesomeness.

‘‘Tīṇimāni, bhikkhave, kusalamūlāni. Katamāni tīṇi? Alobho kusalamūlaṃ, adoso kusalamūlaṃ, amoho kusalamūlaṃ.

“Monks, these are the three roots of wholesome qualities. Which three? Non-greed is a root of wholesome qualities, non-hatred is a root of wholesome qualities, non-delusion is a root of wholesome qualities.

‘‘Yadapi, bhikkhave, alobho tadapi kusalamūlaṃ [kusalaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)]; yadapi aluddho abhisaṅkharoti kāyena vācāya manasā tadapi kusalaṃ [kusalamūlaṃ (ka.)]; yadapi aluddho lobhena anabhibhūto apariyādinnacitto na parassa asatā dukkhaṃ uppādayati vadhena vā bandhanena vā jāniyā vā garahāya vā pabbājanāya vā balavamhi balattho itipi tadapi kusalaṃ. Itissame alobhajā alobhanidānā alobhasamudayā alobhapaccayā aneke kusalā dhammā sambhavanti.

“Whatever, monks, is non-greed—that is a root of wholesome qualities. Whatever a non-greedy person, being non-greedy, fabricates by body, speech, or mind—that too is wholesome. Whatever suffering a non-greedy person, not overcome by greed, with mind not overwhelmed, does not inflict upon another untruthfully, by means of killing, imprisonment, deprivation of property, censure, or banishment, [thinking,] ‘I am strong, I want strength’—that too is wholesome. Thus, many wholesome states are born of non-greed, originate from non-greed, arise from non-greed, and are conditioned by non-greed.

‘‘Yadapi, bhikkhave, adoso tadapi kusalamūlaṃ; yadapi aduṭṭho abhisaṅkharoti kāyena vācāya manasā tadapi kusalaṃ; yadapi aduṭṭho dosena anabhibhūto apariyādinnacitto na parassa asatā dukkhaṃ uppādayati vadhena vā bandhanena vā jāniyā vā garahāya vā pabbājanāya vā balavamhi balattho itipi tadapi kusalaṃ. Itissame adosajā adosanidānā adosasamudayā adosapaccayā aneke kusalā dhammā sambhavanti.

“Whatever, monks, is non-hatred—that is a root of wholesome qualities. Whatever a non-hateful person, being non-hateful, fabricates by body, speech, or mind—that too is wholesome. Whatever suffering a non-hateful person, not overcome by hatred, with mind not overwhelmed, does not inflict upon another untruthfully, by means of killing, imprisonment, deprivation of property, censure, or banishment, [thinking,] ‘I am strong, I want strength’—that too is wholesome. Thus, many wholesome states are born of non-hatred, originate from non-hatred, arise from non-hatred, and are conditioned by non-hatred.

‘‘Yadapi, bhikkhave, amoho tadapi kusalamūlaṃ; yadapi amūḷho abhisaṅkharoti kāyena vācāya manasā tadapi kusalaṃ; yadapi amūḷho mohena anabhibhūto apariyādinnacitto na parassa asatā dukkhaṃ uppādayati vadhena vā bandhanena vā jāniyā vā garahāya vā pabbājanāya vā balavamhi balattho itipi tadapi kusalaṃ. Itissame amohajā amohanidānā amohasamudayā amohapaccayā aneke kusalā dhammā sambhavanti. Evarūpo cāyaṃ, bhikkhave, puggalo vuccati kālavādītipi, bhūtavādītipi, atthavādītipi, dhammavādītipi, vinayavādītipi.

“Whatever, monks, is non-delusion—that is a root of wholesome qualities. Whatever a non-deluded person, being non-deluded, fabricates by body, speech, or mind—that too is wholesome. Whatever suffering a non-deluded person, not overcome by delusion, with mind not overwhelmed, does not inflict upon another untruthfully, by means of killing, imprisonment, deprivation of property, censure, or banishment, [thinking,] ‘I am strong, I want strength’—that too is wholesome. Thus, many wholesome states are born of non-delusion, originate from non-delusion, arise from non-delusion, and are conditioned by non-delusion. Such a person, monks, is called a speaker of what is timely, a speaker of what is true, a speaker of what is beneficial, a speaker of what is Dhamma, and a speaker of what is Vinaya.

‘‘Kasmā cāyaṃ, bhikkhave, evarūpo puggalo vuccati kālavādītipi, bhūtavādītipi, atthavādītipi, dhammavādītipi, vinayavādītipi? Tathāhāyaṃ, bhikkhave, puggalo na parassa asatā dukkhaṃ uppādayati vadhena vā bandhanena vā jāniyā vā garahāya vā pabbājanāya vā balavamhi balattho itipi. Bhūtena kho pana vuccamāno paṭijānāti no avajānāti; abhūtena vuccamāno ātappaṃ karoti tassa nibbeṭhanāya – ‘itipetaṃ atacchaṃ, itipetaṃ abhūta’nti. Tasmā evarūpo puggalo vuccati kālavādītipi, atthavādītipi, dhammavādītipi, vinayavādītipi.

“And why, monks, is such a person called a speaker of what is timely, a speaker of what is true, a speaker of what is beneficial, a speaker of what is Dhamma, and a speaker of what is Vinaya? Because, monks, such a person does not inflict suffering upon another untruthfully, by means of killing, imprisonment, deprivation of property, censure, or banishment, [thinking,] ‘I am strong, I want strength.’ But when spoken to truthfully, he acknowledges it and does not scorn it. When spoken to untruthfully, he makes an effort to refute it, saying, ‘This is not so, this is untrue.’ Therefore, such a person is called a speaker of what is timely, a speaker of what is beneficial, a speaker of what is Dhamma, and a speaker of what is Vinaya.

‘‘Evarūpassa, bhikkhave, puggalassa lobhajā pāpakā akusalā dhammā pahīnā ucchinnamūlā tālāvatthukatā anabhāvaṃkatā āyatiṃ anuppādadhammā. Diṭṭheva dhamme sukhaṃ viharati avighātaṃ anupāyāsaṃ apariḷāhaṃ. Diṭṭheva dhamme parinibbāyati.

“For such a person, monks, evil, unwholesome states born of greed are abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, brought to an end, and incapable of arising again in the future. He dwells happily in this very life, without vexation, without distress, and without fever. In this very life, he attains Nibbāna.

‘‘Dosajā…pe… parinibbāyati. Mohajā…pe… parinibbāyati. Seyyathāpi bhikkhave, sālo vā dhavo vā phandano vā tīhi māluvālatāhi uddhasto pariyonaddho. Atha puriso āgaccheyya kuddāla-piṭakaṃ [kuddālapiṭakaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] ādāya. So taṃ māluvālataṃ mūle chindeyya, mūle chetvā palikhaṇeyya, palikhaṇitvā mūlāni uddhareyya, antamaso usīranāḷimattānipi [usīranāḷamattānipi (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)]. So taṃ māluvālataṃ khaṇḍākhaṇḍikaṃ chindeyya, khaṇḍākhaṇḍikaṃ chetvā phāleyya, phāletvā sakalikaṃ sakalikaṃ kareyya, sakalikaṃ sakalikaṃ karitvā vātātape visoseyya, vātātape visosetvā agginā ḍaheyya, agginā ḍahitvā masiṃ kareyya, masiṃ karitvā mahāvāte vā ophuṇeyya nadiyā vā sīghasotāya pavāheyya. Evamassa [evamassu (sī.), evassu (ka.)] tā, bhikkhave, māluvālatā ucchinnamūlā tālāvatthukatā anabhāvaṃkatā āyatiṃ anuppādadhammā. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, evarūpassa puggalassa lobhajā pāpakā akusalā dhammā pahīnā ucchinnamūlā tālāvatthukatā anabhāvaṃkatā āyatiṃ anuppādadhammā. Diṭṭheva dhamme sukhaṃ viharati avighātaṃ anupāyāsaṃ apariḷāhaṃ. Diṭṭheva dhamme parinibbāyati.

Born of hatred, the evil unwholesome states... are abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise again in the future. He dwells happily in this very life, free from affliction, free from distress, free from fever. In this very life, he attains Nibbāna. Born of delusion, the evil unwholesome states... are abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise again in the future. He dwells happily in this very life, free from affliction, free from distress, free from fever. In this very life, he attains Nibbāna. Just as, bhikkhus, a sal tree, a dhavala tree, or a phandana tree is overwhelmed and entangled by three māluvā creepers. Then a man might come along with a hoe and basket. He would cut those māluvā creepers at the root, and having cut them at the root, he would dig around them. Having dug around them, he would pull out the roots, even down to the smallest blade of usira grass. He would chop those māluvā creepers into pieces, and having chopped them into pieces, he would split them. Having split them, he would reduce them to fragments. Having reduced them to fragments, he would dry them in the wind and sun. Having dried them in the wind and sun, he would burn them with fire. Having burned them with fire, he would reduce them to ashes. Having reduced them to ashes, he would scatter them in a strong wind or let them be carried away by a swift-flowing river. Thus, bhikkhus, those māluvā creepers would be cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise again in the future. In the same way, bhikkhus, for such a person, the evil unwholesome states born of greed are abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise again in the future. He dwells happily in this very life, free from affliction, free from distress, free from fever. In this very life, he attains Nibbāna.

‘‘Dosajā …pe… mohajā pāpakā akusalā dhammā pahīnā ucchinnamūlā tālāvatthukatā anabhāvaṃkatā āyatiṃ anuppādadhammā. Diṭṭheva dhamme sukhaṃ viharati avighātaṃ anupāyāsaṃ apariḷāhaṃ. Diṭṭheva dhamme parinibbāyati. Imāni kho, bhikkhave, tīṇi kusalamūlānī’’ti. Navamaṃ.

Born of hatred, the evil unwholesome states... born of delusion, the evil unwholesome states are abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise again in the future. One dwells happily in this very life, free from affliction, free from distress, free from fever. In this very life, one attains Nibbāna. These, bhikkhus, are the three roots of the wholesome.” Ninth.
