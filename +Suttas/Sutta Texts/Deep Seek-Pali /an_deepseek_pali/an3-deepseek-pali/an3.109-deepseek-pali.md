## AN 3.109 The Discourse on the Unguarded

110. Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho anāthapiṇḍikaṃ gahapatiṃ bhagavā etadavoca – ‘‘citte, gahapati, arakkhite kāyakammampi arakkhitaṃ hoti, vacīkammampi arakkhitaṃ hoti, manokammampi arakkhitaṃ hoti. Tassa arakkhitakāyakammantassa arakkhitavacīkammantassa arakkhitamanokammantassa kāyakammampi avassutaṃ hoti, vacīkammampi avassutaṃ hoti, manokammampi avassutaṃ hoti. Tassa avassutakāyakammantassa avassutavacīkammantassa avassutamanokammantassa kāyakammampi pūtikaṃ hoti, vacīkammampi pūtikaṃ hoti, manokammampi pūtikaṃ hoti. Tassa pūtikāyakammantassa pūtivacīkammantassa pūtimanokammantassa na bhaddakaṃ maraṇaṃ hoti, na bhaddikā kālaṅkiriyā.

110.Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika as he sat to one side: "Householder, when the mind is unguarded, bodily action is also unguarded, verbal action is also unguarded, and mental action is also unguarded. For one whose bodily action is unguarded, whose verbal action is unguarded, and whose mental action is unguarded, bodily action also flows out, verbal action also flows out, and mental action also flows out. For one whose bodily action flows out, whose verbal action flows out, and whose mental action flows out, bodily action becomes putrid, verbal action becomes putrid, and mental action becomes putrid. For one whose bodily action is putrid, whose verbal action is putrid, and whose mental action is putrid, there is no good death, no fortunate passing away."

‘‘Seyyathāpi, gahapati, kūṭāgāre ducchanne kūṭampi arakkhitaṃ hoti, gopānasiyopi arakkhitā honti, bhittipi arakkhitā hoti; kūṭampi avassutaṃ hoti, gopānasiyopi avassutā honti, bhittipi avassutā hoti; kūṭampi pūtikaṃ hoti, gopānasiyopi pūtikā honti, bhittipi pūtikā hoti.

"Just as, householder, in a house with a poorly roofed peak, the peak is unprotected, the eaves are unprotected, the walls are unprotected; the peak is leaking, the eaves are leaking, the walls are leaking; the peak is rotten, the eaves are rotten, the walls are rotten.

‘‘Evamevaṃ kho, gahapati, citte arakkhite kāyakammampi arakkhitaṃ hoti, vacīkammampi arakkhitaṃ hoti, manokammampi arakkhitaṃ hoti. Tassa arakkhitakāyakammantassa arakkhitavacīkammantassa arakkhitamanokammantassa kāyakammampi avassutaṃ hoti, vacīkammampi avassutaṃ hoti, manokammampi avassutaṃ hoti. Tassa avassutakāyakammantassa avassutavacīkammantassa avassutamanokammantassa kāyakammampi pūtikaṃ hoti, vacīkammampi pūtikaṃ hoti, manokammampi pūtikaṃ hoti. Tassa pūtikāyakammantassa pūtivacīkammantassa pūtimanokammantassa na bhaddakaṃ maraṇaṃ hoti, na bhaddikā kālaṅkiriyā.

"Just so, householder, when the mind is unguarded, bodily action is unguarded, verbal action is unguarded, and mental action is unguarded. For one whose bodily action is unguarded, whose verbal action is unguarded, and whose mental action is unguarded, bodily action flows out, verbal action flows out, and mental action flows out. For one whose bodily action flows out, whose verbal action flows out, and whose mental action flows out, bodily action becomes putrid, verbal action becomes putrid, and mental action becomes putrid. For one whose bodily action is putrid, whose verbal action is putrid, and whose mental action is putrid, there is no good death, no fortunate passing away."

‘‘Citte, gahapati, rakkhite kāyakammampi rakkhitaṃ hoti, vacīkammampi rakkhitaṃ hoti, manokammampi rakkhitaṃ hoti. Tassa rakkhitakāyakammantassa rakkhitavacīkammantassa rakkhitamanokammantassa kāyakammampi anavassutaṃ hoti, vacīkammampi anavassutaṃ hoti, manokammampi anavassutaṃ hoti. Tassa anavassutakāyakammantassa anavassutavacīkammantassa anavassutamanokammantassa kāyakammampi apūtikaṃ hoti, vacīkammampi apūtikaṃ hoti, manokammampi apūtikaṃ hoti. Tassa apūtikāyakammantassa apūtivacīkammantassa apūtimanokammantassa bhaddakaṃ maraṇaṃ hoti, bhaddikā kālaṅkiriyā.

"Householder, when the mind is guarded, bodily action is also guarded; verbal action is also guarded; mental action is also guarded. For one whose bodily action is guarded, whose verbal action is guarded, whose mental action is guarded, bodily action is also without outflow; verbal action is also without outflow; mental action is also without outflow. For one whose bodily action is without outflow, whose verbal action is without outflow, whose mental action is without outflow, bodily action is also uncorrupted; verbal action is also uncorrupted; mental action is also uncorrupted. For one whose bodily action is uncorrupted, whose verbal action is uncorrupted, and whose mental action is uncorrupted, there is a good death, a fortunate passing away."

‘‘Seyyathāpi, gahapati, kūṭāgāre succhanne kūṭampi rakkhitaṃ hoti, gopānasiyopi rakkhitā honti, bhittipi rakkhitā hoti; kūṭampi anavassutaṃ hoti, gopānasiyopi anavassutā honti, bhittipi anavassutā hoti; kūṭampi apūtikaṃ hoti, gopānasiyopi apūtikā honti, bhittipi apūtikā hoti.

"Just as, householder, in a well-roofed house, the roof peak is protected, the eaves are protected, and the walls are protected; the roof peak is not leaky, the eaves are not leaky, and the walls are not leaky; the roof peak is not rotten, the eaves are not rotten, and the walls are not rotten.

Evamevaṃ kho, gahapati, citte rakkhite kāyakammampi rakkhitaṃ hoti, vacīkammampi rakkhitaṃ hoti, manokammampi rakkhitaṃ hoti. Tassa rakkhitakāyakammantassa rakkhitavacīkammantassa rakkhitamanokammantassa kāyakammampi anavassutaṃ hoti, vacīkammampi anavassutaṃ hoti, manokammampi anavassutaṃ hoti. Tassa anavassutakāyakammantassa anavassutavacīkammantassa anavassutamanokammantassa kāyakammampi apūtikaṃ hoti, vacīkammampi apūtikaṃ hoti, manokammampi apūtikaṃ hoti. Tassa apūtikāyakammantassa apūtivacīkammantassa apūtimanokammantassa bhaddakaṃ maraṇaṃ hoti, bhaddikā kālaṅkiriyā’’ti. Sattamaṃ.

In the same way, householder, when the mind is guarded, bodily action is guarded, verbal action is guarded, and mental action is guarded. For one whose bodily action is guarded, whose verbal action is guarded, and whose mental action is guarded, bodily action is without outflow, verbal action is without outflow, and mental action is without outflow. For one whose bodily action is without outflow, whose verbal action is without outflow, and whose mental action is without outflow, bodily action is uncorrupted, verbal action is uncorrupted, and mental action is uncorrupted. For one whose bodily action is uncorrupted, whose verbal action is uncorrupted, and whose mental action is uncorrupted, there is a good death, a fortunate passing away.” The seventh.
