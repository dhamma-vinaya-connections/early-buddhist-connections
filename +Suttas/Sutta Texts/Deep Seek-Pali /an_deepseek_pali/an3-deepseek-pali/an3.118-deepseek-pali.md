## AN 3.118 The Incontrovertible Discourse

119. ‘‘Tisso imā, bhikkhave, vipattiyo. Katamā tisso? Sīlavipatti, cittavipatti, diṭṭhivipatti. Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sīlavipatti? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco pāṇātipātī hoti…pe… samphappalāpī hoti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, sīlavipatti.

119."Monks, there are these three failures. What three? Failure in moral conduct, failure in mind, and failure in view. And what, monks, is failure in moral conduct? Here, monks, someone is a killer of living beings… engages in frivolous talk. This is called, monks, failure in moral conduct."

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, cittavipatti? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco abhijjhālu hoti byāpannacitto. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, cittavipatti.

"And what, monks, is failure in mind? Here, a certain person is covetous, with a mind of ill will. This is called, monks, failure in mind."

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, diṭṭhivipatti? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco micchādiṭṭhiko hoti viparītadassano – ‘natthi dinnaṃ, natthi yiṭṭhaṃ…pe… ye imañca lokaṃ parañca lokaṃ sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedentī’ti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, diṭṭhivipatti. Sīlavipattihetu vā, bhikkhave…pe… diṭṭhivipattihetu vā, bhikkhave, sattā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā apāyaṃ duggatiṃ vinipātaṃ nirayaṃ upapajjanti. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, apaṇṇako maṇi uddhaṃ khitto yena yeneva patiṭṭhāti suppatiṭṭhitaṃyeva patiṭṭhāti; evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, sīlavipattihetu vā sattā…pe… upapajjanti. Imā kho, bhikkhave, tisso vipattiyoti.

"And what, monks, is failure in view? Here, monks, someone has wrong view, a distorted perspective: ‘There is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed... nor are there ascetics or brahmins in the world who are rightly practicing and rightly proclaiming, having realized this world and the next world by direct knowledge.’ This, monks, is called failure in view. Due to failure in moral conduct, monks… due to failure in view, monks, beings, on the dissolution of the body, after death, are reborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower realms, in hell. Just as, monks, an infallible gem, when thrown upwards, settles firmly wherever it lands; in the same way, monks, due to failure in moral conduct… beings are reborn in hell. These, monks, are the three kinds of failure."

‘‘Tisso imā, bhikkhave, sampadā. Katamā tisso? Sīlasampadā, cittasampadā, diṭṭhisampadā. Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sīlasampadā? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco pāṇātipātā paṭivirato hoti…pe… ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, sīlasampadā.

"Monks, there are these three accomplishments. What three? Accomplishment in moral conduct, accomplishment in mind, and accomplishment in view. And what, monks, is accomplishment in moral conduct? Here, monks, a certain person abstains from the destruction of life… (and so forth)… This is called accomplishment in moral conduct."

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, cittasampadā? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco anabhijjhālu hoti abyāpannacitto. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, cittasampadā.

"And what, monks, is accomplishment of mind? Here, monks, someone is without covetousness, with a mind free of ill will. This is called accomplishment of mind."

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, diṭṭhisampadā? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco sammādiṭṭhiko hoti aviparītadassano – ‘atthi dinnaṃ, atthi yiṭṭhaṃ…pe… ye imañca lokaṃ parañca lokaṃ sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedentī’ti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, diṭṭhisampadā. Sīlasampadāhetu vā, bhikkhave, sattā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjanti. Cittasampadāhetu vā…pe… diṭṭhisampadāhetu vā, bhikkhave, sattā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjanti. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, apaṇṇako maṇi uddhaṃ khitto yena yeneva patiṭṭhāti suppatiṭṭhitaṃyeva patiṭṭhāti; evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, sīlasampadāhetu vā sattā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjanti, cittasampadāhetu vā sattā…pe… diṭṭhisampadāhetu vā sattā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjanti. Imā kho, bhikkhave, tisso sampadā’’ti. Chaṭṭhaṃ.

"And what, monks, is the accomplishment of view? Here, monks, someone has right view, undistorted vision: ‘There is what is given, what is offered, what is sacrificed... those who proclaim this world and the next, having directly known and realized them by themselves.’ This, monks, is called the accomplishment of view. Monks, beings, on the dissolution of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, a heavenly world, due to the accomplishment of moral conduct. Or due to the accomplishment of mind... or due to the accomplishment of view, monks, beings, on the dissolution of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, a heavenly world. Just as, monks, a flawless jewel thrown upwards lands firmly wherever it falls; in the same way, monks, monks, beings, on the dissolution of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, a heavenly world, due to the accomplishment of moral conduct... or beings... due to the accomplishment of mind... or beings, on the dissolution of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, a heavenly world, due to the accomplishment of view. These, monks, are the three accomplishments." The sixth.
