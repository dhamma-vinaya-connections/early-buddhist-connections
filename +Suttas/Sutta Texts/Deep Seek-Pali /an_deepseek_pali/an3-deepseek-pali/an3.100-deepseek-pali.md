## AN 3.100 The Discourse on the Lump of Salt

101. ‘‘Yo [yo kho (syā. kaṃ.), yo ca kho (ka.)], bhikkhave, evaṃ vadeyya – ‘yathā yathāyaṃ puriso kammaṃ karoti tathā tathā taṃ paṭisaṃvediyatī’ti, evaṃ santaṃ, bhikkhave, brahmacariyavāso na hoti, okāso na paññāyati sammā dukkhassa antakiriyāya. Yo ca kho, bhikkhave, evaṃ vadeyya – ‘yathā yathā vedanīyaṃ ayaṃ puriso kammaṃ karoti tathā tathāssa vipākaṃ paṭisaṃvediyatī’ti, evaṃ santaṃ, bhikkhave, brahmacariyavāso hoti, okāso paññāyati sammā dukkhassa antakiriyāya. Idha, bhikkhave, ekaccassa puggalassa appamattakampi pāpakammaṃ [pāpaṃ kammaṃ (sī. pī.)] kataṃ tamenaṃ nirayaṃ upaneti. Idha pana, bhikkhave, ekaccassa puggalassa tādisaṃyeva appamattakaṃ pāpakammaṃ kataṃ diṭṭhadhammavedanīyaṃ hoti, nā’ṇupi khāyati, kiṃ bahudeva.

101."Bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'Just as this person performs an action, just so does he experience its result,' in that case, Bhikkhus, there would be no living of the holy life, no opportunity would be seen for the complete ending of suffering. But if someone were to say: 'Just as this person performs an action that is to be experienced, just so does he experience its result,' in that case, Bhikkhus, there is the living of the holy life, and the opportunity is seen for the complete ending of suffering. Here, Bhikkhus, for a certain individual a trifling evil deed done leads him to hell. But here, Bhikkhus, for another individual just such a trifling evil deed done is to be experienced in this very life; not even a trace remains, how much less a lot."

‘‘Kathaṃrūpassa, bhikkhave, puggalassa appamattakampi pāpakammaṃ kataṃ tamenaṃ nirayaṃ upaneti? Idha pana, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo abhāvitakāyo hoti abhāvitasīlo abhāvitacitto abhāvitapañño paritto appātumo appadukkhavihārī. Evarūpassa, bhikkhave, puggalassa appamattakampi pāpakammaṃ kataṃ tamenaṃ nirayaṃ upaneti.

"What kind of person, Bhikkhus, is it for whom even a trifling evil deed, if done, leads to hell? Here, Bhikkhus, a certain person is undeveloped in body, undeveloped in virtue, undeveloped in mind, and undeveloped in wisdom. They are limited, of little account, and dwell miserably. For such a person, Bhikkhus, even a trifling evil deed, if done, leads him to hell."

‘‘Kathaṃrūpassa, bhikkhave, puggalassa tādisaṃyeva appamattakaṃ pāpakammaṃ kataṃ diṭṭhadhammavedanīyaṃ hoti, nā’ṇupi khāyati, kiṃ bahudeva? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo bhāvitakāyo hoti bhāvitasīlo bhāvitacitto bhāvitapañño aparitto mahatto [mahattā (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] appamāṇavihārī. Evarūpassa, bhikkhave, puggalassa tādisaṃyeva appamattakaṃ pāpakammaṃ kataṃ diṭṭhadhammavedanīyaṃ hoti, nāṇupi khāyati, kiṃ bahudeva.

"What kind of person, Bhikkhus, is it for whom just such a trifling evil deed, if done, is to be experienced in this very life, and not even a trace remains, how much less a lot? Here, Bhikkhus, a certain person has developed the body, developed virtue, developed the mind, and developed wisdom; they are boundless, of great account, and dwell in the immeasurable. For such a person, Bhikkhus, just such a trifling evil deed, if done, is to be experienced in this very life, and not even a trace remains, how much less a lot."

‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, puriso loṇakapallaṃ [loṇaphalaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] paritte udakamallake [udakakapallake (ka.)] pakkhipeyya. Taṃ kiṃ maññatha, bhikkhave, api nu taṃ parittaṃ udakaṃ [udakamallake udakaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] amunā loṇakapallena loṇaṃ assa apeyya’’nti? ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’. ‘‘Taṃ kissa hetu’’? ‘‘Aduñhi, bhante, parittaṃ udakakapallake udakaṃ, taṃ amunā loṇakapallena loṇaṃ assa apeyya’’nti. ‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, puriso loṇakapallakaṃ gaṅgāya nadiyā pakkhipeyya. Taṃ kiṃ maññatha, bhikkhave, api nu sā gaṅgā nadī amunā loṇakapallena loṇaṃ assa apeyyā’’ti? ‘‘No hetaṃ, bhante’’. ‘‘Taṃ kissa hetu’’? ‘‘Asu hi, bhante, gaṅgāya nadiyā mahā udakakkhandho so amunā loṇakapallena loṇo na assa apeyyo’’ti [loṇaṃ nevassa apeyyanti (sī.), na loṇo assa apeyyoti (pī.)].

"Suppose, Bhikkhus, a man were to drop a lump of salt into a small pot of water. What do you think, Bhikkhus? Would that small amount of water become salty and undrinkable because of that lump of salt?" "Yes, Venerable Sir." "Why is that?" "Because, Venerable Sir, the amount of water in the small pot is little, so it would become salty and undrinkable because of that lump of salt." "Suppose, Bhikkhus, a man were to drop a lump of salt into the River Ganges. What do you think, Bhikkhus? Would the River Ganges become salty and undrinkable because of that lump of salt?" "No, Venerable Sir." "Why is that?" "Because, Venerable Sir, the mass of water in the River Ganges is vast, so it would not become salty and undrinkable because of that lump of salt."

‘‘Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, idhekaccassa puggalassa appamattakampi pāpakammaṃ kataṃ tamenaṃ nirayaṃ upaneti. Idha, bhikkhave, ekaccassa puggalassa tādisaṃyeva appamattakaṃ pāpakammaṃ kataṃ diṭṭhadhammavedanīyaṃ hoti, nāṇupi khāyati, kiṃ bahudeva.

"In the same way, Bhikkhus, here for a certain individual even a trifling evil deed done leads him to hell. But here, Bhikkhus, for another individual just such a trifling evil deed done is to be experienced in this very life; not even a trace remains, how much less a lot."

‘‘Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco aḍḍhakahāpaṇenapi bandhanaṃ nigacchati, kahāpaṇenapi bandhanaṃ nigacchati, kahāpaṇasatenapi bandhanaṃ nigacchati. Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco aḍḍhakahāpaṇenapi na bandhanaṃ nigacchati, kahāpaṇenapi na bandhanaṃ nigacchati, kahāpaṇasatenapi na bandhanaṃ nigacchati.

"Here, Bhikkhus, a certain individual falls into bondage for half a kahāpaṇa, for a kahāpaṇa, or for even a hundred kahāpaṇas. Here, Bhikkhus, another individual does not fall into bondage for half a kahāpaṇa, for a kahāpaṇa, or for even a hundred kahāpaṇas."

‘‘Kathaṃrūpo, bhikkhave, aḍḍhakahāpaṇenapi bandhanaṃ nigacchati, kahāpaṇenapi bandhanaṃ nigacchati, kahāpaṇasatenapi bandhanaṃ nigacchati? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco daliddo hoti appassako appabhogo.

"Here, Bhikkhus, a certain person has developed the body, developed virtue, developed the mind, and developed wisdom; they are boundless, of great account, and dwell in the immeasurable. For such a person, Bhikkhus, just such a trifling evil deed, if done, is to be experienced in this very life, and not even a trace remains, how much less a lot. Just as, Bhikkhus, a sheep owner or a sheep butcher can kill, bind, make him pay, or do as he pleases with a certain sheep that he has stolen, but cannot kill, bind, make him pay, or do as he pleases with a certain other sheep that he has stolen."

‘‘Kathaṃrūpaṃ, bhikkhave, orabbhiko vā urabbhaghātako vā urabbhaṃ adinnaṃ ādiyamānaṃ pahoti hantuṃ vā bandhituṃ vā jāpetuṃ vā yathāpaccayaṃ vā kātuṃ?

"What kind of person, Bhikkhus, is a sheep owner or a sheep butcher unable to kill, bind, make him pay, or do as he pleases with a sheep that he has stolen? Here, Bhikkhus, a certain individual is rich, with great wealth and great possessions—a king or a royal minister. Such a person, Bhikkhus, is a sheep owner or a sheep butcher unable to kill, bind, make him pay, or do as he pleases with a sheep that he has stolen. Instead, he merely entreats him with folded hands: 'Please, good sir, give me the sheep or the price of the sheep.' In the same way, Bhikkhus, here for a certain individual just such a trifling evil deed done leads him to hell. But here, Bhikkhus, for another individual just such a trifling evil deed done is to be experienced in this very life; not even a trace remains, how much less a lot."

Bhikkhus, for what sort of person does even a small, trifling evil deed done ripen in this very life, so that not even a particle of it is experienced, what to speak of much? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person has cultivated the body, cultivated virtue, cultivated the mind, cultivated wisdom; is not limited, is of great measure, and dwells with the immeasurable. For such a person, bhikkhus, even a small, trifling evil deed done ripens in this very life, so that not even a particle of it is experienced, what to speak of much.

‘‘Yo, bhikkhave, evaṃ vadeyya – ‘yathā yathāyaṃ puriso kammaṃ karoti tathā tathā taṃ paṭisaṃvedetī’ti, evaṃ santaṃ, bhikkhave, brahmacariyavāso na hoti, okāso na paññāyati sammā dukkhassa antakiriyāya. Yo ca kho, bhikkhave, evaṃ vadeyya – ‘yathā yathā vedanīyaṃ ayaṃ puriso kammaṃ karoti tathā tathā tassa vipākaṃ paṭisaṃvedetī’ti, evaṃ santaṃ, bhikkhave, brahmacariyavāso hoti, okāso paññāyati sammā dukkhassa antakiriyāyā’’ti. Navamaṃ.

Bhikkhus, if someone were to say: ‘Just as this person performs an action, just so does he experience its result,’ in that case, bhikkhus, living the holy life would be impossible, and no opportunity would be apparent for rightly making an end of suffering. But if someone were to say: ‘In whatever way this person performs an action that is to be experienced, in that way he experiences its result,’ in that case, bhikkhus, living the holy life is possible, and an opportunity is apparent for rightly making an end of suffering.” The ninth.
