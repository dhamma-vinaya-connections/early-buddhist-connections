# AN 3.119 Kammantasuttaṃ

## AN 3.119 The Discourse on Actions

120. ‘‘Tisso imā, bhikkhave, vipattiyo. Katamā tisso? Kammantavipatti, ājīvavipatti, diṭṭhivipatti. Katamā ca, bhikkhave, kammantavipatti? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco pāṇātipātī hoti…pe… samphappalāpī hoti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, kammantavipatti.

120."Monks, there are these three failures. What three? Failure in action, failure in livelihood, and failure in view. And what, monks, is failure in action? Here, monks, someone is a killer of living beings... indulges in idle chatter. This is called, monks, failure in action."

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, ājīvavipatti? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco micchāājīvo hoti, micchāājīvena jīvikaṃ [jīvitaṃ (syā. kaṃ. ka.)] kappeti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, ājīvavipatti.

"And what, monks, is failure in livelihood? Here, monks, someone has wrong livelihood, earns a living by wrong livelihood. This, monks, is called failure in livelihood."

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, diṭṭhivipatti? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco micchādiṭṭhiko hoti viparītadassano – ‘natthi dinnaṃ, natthi yiṭṭhaṃ…pe… ye imañca lokaṃ parañca lokaṃ sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedentī’ti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, diṭṭhivipatti. Imā kho, bhikkhave, tisso vipattiyoti.

"And what, monks, is the failure of view? Here, monks, someone holds wrong view, a distorted vision: 'There is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed... no ascetics or brahmins who have realized this world and the other world by direct knowledge and proclaim it.' This, monks, is called the failure of view. These, monks, are the three failures."

‘‘Tisso imā, bhikkhave, sampadā. Katamā tisso? Kammantasampadā, ājīvasampadā, diṭṭhisampadā. Katamā ca, bhikkhave, kammantasampadā? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco pāṇātipātā paṭivirato hoti…pe… samphappalāpā paṭivirato hoti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, kammantasampadā.

"Monks, there are these three accomplishments. What three? Accomplishment in action, accomplishment in livelihood, and accomplishment in view. And what, monks, is accomplishment in action? Here, monks, someone abstains from killing living beings... abstains from frivolous talk. This, monks, is called accomplishment in action."

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, ājīvasampadā? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco sammāājīvo hoti, sammāājīvena jīvikaṃ kappeti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, ājīvasampadā.

"And what, monks, is the accomplishment of livelihood? Here, monks, a certain person has right livelihood, and makes a living by right livelihood. This is called the accomplishment of livelihood."

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, diṭṭhisampadā? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco sammādiṭṭhiko hoti aviparītadassano – ‘atthi dinnaṃ, atthi yiṭṭhaṃ…pe… ye imañca lokaṃ parañca lokaṃ sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedentī’ti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, diṭṭhisampadā. Imā kho, bhikkhave, tisso sampadā’’ti. Sattamaṃ.

"And what, monks, is the accomplishment of view? Here, monks, someone has right view, vision that’s not distorted: ‘There is what is given, what is offered, what is sacrificed... those who proclaim this world and the next, having directly known and realized them by themselves.’ This, monks, is called the accomplishment of view. These, monks, are the three accomplishments." Seventh.
