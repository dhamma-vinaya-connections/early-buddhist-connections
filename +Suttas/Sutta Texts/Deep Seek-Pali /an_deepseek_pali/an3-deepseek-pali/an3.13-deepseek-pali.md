## AN 3.13 Āsaṃsasuttaṃ

13. ‘‘Tayome, bhikkhave, puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ. Katame tayo? Nirāso, āsaṃso, vigatāso. Katamo ca, bhikkhave puggalo nirāso? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo nīce kule paccājāto hoti, caṇḍālakule vā venakule [veṇakule (syā. kaṃ. pī.)] vā nesādakule vā rathakārakule vā pukkusakule vā dalidde appannapānabhojane kasiravuttike, yattha kasirena ghāsacchādo labbhati. So ca hoti dubbaṇṇo duddasiko okoṭimako bavhābādho [bahvābādho (syā. kaṃ. pī. ka.)] kāṇo vā kuṇī vā khañjo vā pakkhahato vā, na lābhī annassa pānassa vatthassa yānassa mālāgandhavilepanassa seyyāvasathapadīpeyyassa. So suṇāti – ‘itthannāmo kira khattiyo khattiyehi khattiyābhisekena abhisitto’ti. Tassa na evaṃ hoti – ‘kudāssu nāma mampi khattiyā khattiyābhisekena abhisiñcissantī’ti! Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, puggalo nirāso.

13. Monks, these three kinds of people are found existing in the world. Which three? The hopeless, the hopeful, and the one free from hope. And who, monks, is the hopeless person? Here, monks, a certain person is reborn in a low family—a family of outcastes, bamboo-workers, hunters, cart-makers, or scavengers—poor, with little food and drink, living miserably, where food and clothing are obtained with difficulty. And he is ugly, unpleasant to look at, deformed, sickly—blind, crippled, lame, or paralyzed. He does not obtain food, drink, clothing, vehicles, garlands, perfumes, ointments, beds, dwellings, or lamps. He hears: ‘So-and-so noble has been anointed as king by the nobles.’ But it does not occur to him: ‘When will the nobles anoint me too as king?’ This, monks, is called the hopeless person.

‘‘Katamo ca, bhikkhave, puggalo āsaṃso? Idha, bhikkhave, rañño khattiyassa muddhāvasittassa jeṭṭho putto hoti ābhiseko anabhisitto acalappatto [macalappatto (sī. pī.)]. So suṇāti – ‘itthannāmo kira khattiyo khattiyehi khattiyābhisekena abhisitto’ti. Tassa evaṃ hoti – ‘kudāssu nāma mampi khattiyā khattiyābhisekena abhisiñcissantī’ti! Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, puggalo āsaṃso.

And who, monks, is the hopeful person? Here, monks, an anointed Khattiya king has an eldest son, an heir apparent, who is unanointed but firmly established. He hears: ‘So-and-so, it seems, a Khattiya, has been anointed by the Khattiyas with the Khattiya anointing.’ It occurs to him: ‘When, I wonder, will the Khattiyas anoint me too with the Khattiya anointing?’ This, monks, is called the hopeful person.

‘‘Katamo ca, bhikkhave, puggalo vigatāso? Idha, bhikkhave, rājā hoti khattiyo muddhāvasitto. So suṇāti – ‘itthannāmo kira khattiyo khattiyehi khattiyābhisekena abhisitto’ti. Tassa na evaṃ hoti – ‘kudāssu nāma mampi khattiyā khattiyābhisekena abhisiñcissantī’ti! Taṃ kissa hetu? Yā hissa, bhikkhave, pubbe anabhisittassa abhisekāsā sā [sāssa (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] paṭippassaddhā. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, puggalo vigatāso. Ime kho, bhikkhave, tayo puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ.

And who, monks, is the one free from hope? Here, monks, a Khattiya king who has been anointed. He hears: ‘So-and-so, it seems, a Khattiya, has been anointed by the Khattiyas with the Khattiya anointing.’ But it does not occur to him: ‘When, I wonder, will the Khattiyas anoint me too with the Khattiya anointing?’ Why is that? For, monks, his hope for anointing, which he had previously when unanointed, has subsided. This, monks, is called the one free from hope. These, monks, are the three persons found existing in the world.

‘‘Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, tayo puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā bhikkhūsu. Katame tayo? Nirāso, āsaṃso, vigatāso. Katamo ca, bhikkhave, puggalo nirāso? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo dussīlo hoti pāpadhammo asuci saṅkassarasamācāro paṭicchannakammanto assamaṇo samaṇapaṭiñño abrahmacārī brahmacāripaṭiñño antopūti avassuto kasambujāto. So suṇāti – ‘itthannāmo kira bhikkhu āsavānaṃ khayā anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ paññāvimuttiṃ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharatī’ti. Tassa na evaṃ hoti – ‘kudāssu nāma ahampi āsavānaṃ khayā anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ paññāvimuttiṃ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharissāmī’ti! Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, puggalo nirāso.

Just so, monks, these three kinds of persons are found existing among the monks. Which three? The hopeless, the hopeful, and the one free from hope. And what, monks, is a hopeless person? Here, monks, a certain person is immoral, of bad character, impure, of suspicious behavior, secretive in his actions, not a renunciate though claiming to be one, not a celibate though claiming to be one, rotten inside, full of corruption, a refuse heap. He hears: 'A monk named such and such, it seems, through the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having attained it, dwells in it.' But it does not occur to him: 'When, I wonder, will I too, through the destruction of the taints, realize for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having attained it, dwell in it?' This is called, monks, a hopeless person.

‘‘Katamo ca, bhikkhave, puggalo āsaṃso? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sīlavā hoti kalyāṇadhammo. So suṇāti āsavānaṃ khayā anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ paññāvimuttiṃ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharatī’ti. Tassa evaṃ hoti – ‘kudāssu nāma ahampi āsavānaṃ khayā anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ paññāvimuttiṃ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharissāmī’ti! Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, puggalo āsaṃso.

"And what, monks, is a person with hope? Here, monks, a monk is virtuous, of good character. He hears: 'Through the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having attained it, dwells in it.' And it occurs to him: 'When, I wonder, will I too, through the destruction of the taints, realize for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having attained it, dwell in it?' This is called, monks, a person with hope.

‘‘Katamo ca, bhikkhave, puggalo vigatāso? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu arahaṃ hoti khīṇāsavo. So suṇāti – ‘itthannāmo kira bhikkhu āsavānaṃ khayā anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ paññāvimuttiṃ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharatī’ti. Tassa na evaṃ hoti – ‘kudāssu nāma ahampi āsavānaṃ khayā…pe… sacchikatvā upasampajja viharissāmī’ti! Taṃ kissa hetu? Yā hissa, bhikkhave, pubbe avimuttassa vimuttāsā sā paṭippassaddhā. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, puggalo vigatāso. Ime kho, bhikkhave, tayo puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā bhikkhūsū’’ti. Tatiyaṃ.

"And what, monks, is a person free from hope? Here, monks, a monk is an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed. He hears: 'Such and such a monk, it seems, through the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having attained it, dwells in it.' But it does not occur to him: 'When, I wonder, will I too, through the destruction of the taints, realize for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having attained it, dwell in it?' Why is that? Because his hope for liberation, which he had when not yet liberated, has subsided. This is called, monks, a person free from hope. These, monks, are the three kinds of persons found existing among the monks." The third.
